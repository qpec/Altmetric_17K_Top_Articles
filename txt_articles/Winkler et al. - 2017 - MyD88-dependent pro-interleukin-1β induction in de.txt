Abstract
Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized first-line sensors of foreign materials invading the organism. These
sentinel cells rely on pattern recognition receptors such as Nod-like or Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to launch immune
reactions against pathogens, but also to mediate tolerance to self-antigens and, in the intestinal milieu, to nutrients
and commensals. Since inappropriate DC activation contributes to inflammatory diseases and immunopathologies, a
key question in the evaluation of orally ingested nanomaterials is whether their contact with DCs in the intestinal
mucosa disrupts this delicate homeostatic balance between pathogen defense and tolerance. Here, we generated
steady-state DCs by incubating hematopoietic progenitors with feline McDonough sarcoma-like tyrosine kinase 3
ligand (Flt3L) and used the resulting immature DCs to test potential biological responses against food-grade synthetic
amorphous silica (SAS) representing a common nanomaterial generally thought to be safe.
Results: Interaction of immature and unprimed DCs with food-grade SAS particles and their internalization by
endocytic uptake fails to elicit cytotoxicity and the release of interleukin (IL)-1α or tumor necrosis factor-α, which were
identified as master regulators of acute inflammation in lung-related studies. However, the display of maturation
markers on the cell surface shows that SAS particles activate completely immature DCs. Also, the endocytic uptake of
SAS particles into these steady-state DCs leads to induction of the pro-IL-1β precursor, subsequently cleaved by the
inflammasome to secrete mature IL-1β. In contrast, neither pro-IL-1β induction nor mature IL-1β secretion occurs upon
internalization of TiO2 or FePO4 nanoparticles. The pro-IL-1β induction is suppressed by pharmacologic inhibitors of
endosomal TLR activation or by genetic ablation of MyD88, a downstream adapter of TLR pathways, indicating that
endosomal pattern recognition is responsible for the observed cytokine response to food-grade SAS particles.
Conclusions: Our results unexpectedly show that food-grade SAS particles are able to directly initiate the endosomal
MyD88-dependent pathogen pattern recognition and signaling pathway in steady-state DCs. The ensuing activation of
immature DCs with de novo induction of pro-IL-1β implies that the currently massive use of SAS particles as food
additive should be reconsidered.

 Background
Dendritic cells (DCs) develop from hematopoietic pro-
genitors of the bone marrow under the direction of
feline McDonough sarcoma-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand
(Flt3L, Additional file 1: Figure S1). This growth factor is
required to generate steady-state DCs that, under homeo-
static conditions, reside in lymphoid organs like spleen and
migrate to non-lymphoid organs including skin, lung and
intestines [1, 2]. Steady-state DCs are dispersed throughout
the intestinal mucosa where, in their dual antigen-
presenting role, they initiate immune reactions in response
to pathogenic agents while maintaining tolerance to self-
antigens, innocuous food constituents and the beneficial
microbiome [3, 4]. To detect foreign structures and
distinguish them from self-antigens, DCs are equipped
with a plethora of innate sensors such as Toll-like re-
ceptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs). These
pattern recognition receptors are strategically posi-
tioned to simultaneously monitor the cell surface,
endosomes and cytoplasm [5]. For almost all TLRs
(except TLR3), an adapter protein known as myeloid
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) medi-
ates activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which in turn
leads to upregulation of cell surface maturation markers
and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [6, 7].
Although the respiratory toxicity of inhaled nanomater-
ials gained much attention [8, 9], the gastrointestinal tract
is exposed to comparably larger amounts of inorganic
particles including nanostructured food additives [10–13].
Silica has currently the highest production volume of all
engineered
nanomaterials
worldwide
[14].
Common
applications in the food industry use silica in the amorph-
ous rather than crystalline form. In particular, synthetic
amorphous silica (SAS) is widely employed as anticaking
agent in powdered products, as defoaming agent in
beverages, as a thickener in pastes or carrier of flavor-
ings [15, 16]. TiO2, containing a minor proportion of
particles with a size <100 nm, serves as whitening
agent in food and toothpastes [17]. New emerging uses
in food include FePO4 particles for iron fortification
[18, 19]. Both crystalline and amorphous silica lead to
acute adverse reactions of the lung after inhalation
involving the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β [9, 20, 21],
and synergism between silica and TiO2 particles has
been reported to exacerbate toxicity in lung macro-
phages [22]. Because of its potent pro-inflammatory
action, IL-1β biogenesis is tightly regulated. First, an
inactive pro-IL-1β precursor is synthesized, which is
subsequently cleaved by the inflammasome complex
(comprising caspase 1 and NLRP3) to yield biologic-
ally active IL-1β for extracellular secretion [23–25].
The actual regulator of pro-IL-1β induction remains
unclear, but in acute lung inflammation a case has
been made for IL-1α, released mainly from necrotic
macrophages, being a trigger of pro-IL-1β expression
[26]. Another previous report implicated tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) as a pro-IL-1β inducer [27].
SAS particles withstand gastrointestinal digestion [16],
reach the intestinal mucosa, penetrate through the
mucus and epithelial barriers and accumulate in under-
lying tissues [28]. Consequently, particle aggregates
containing silicon are detected in the gut-associated
lymphoid tissue of humans [29, 30]. In addition, silica
levels up to 300 μg g−1 tissue (a value converted from
the measured silicon concentration), were found in the
spleen of rodents after repeated oral administration of
SAS particles [31]. The intestine is less sensitive to irrita-
tion compared with lung, but it has been proposed that
a life-long contact of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue
with deposits of exogenous particles may lead to harmful
long-term reactions responsible for chronic inflamma-
tory diseases of the intestinal tract [11, 28]. To address
this potential hazard, we tested the response of steady-
state DCs, representing exquisitely sensitive sentinels of
foreign materials, to two kinds of food-grade SAS parti-
cles currently available on the market. As comparators,
we assessed TiO2 and FePO4 nanoparticles of different
sizes. This study was instigated by the notion that
steady-state DCs, in view of their specialized function
and repertoire of pattern recognition receptors, may
respond to nanomaterials by different mechanisms than
macrophages or other previously tested cell types.
Results
Characterization of particles
High-production examples of commercially available SAS
particles intended for the use in food are Aerosil 380F and
Aerosil 200F [15, 16, 31]. These food-grade SAS particles
were analyzed in depth to determine their shape, specific
surface area and hydrodynamic diameter (Table 1 and
Additional file 1: Figure S2). Under the conditions used
for the testing of cellular responses, i.e., in cell culture
medium, the two nanostructured SAS materials display
primary particle sizes of 7 and 13 nm, but form aggregates
with very similar mean diameters of 147 and 127 nm.
Nanoparticles of TiO2 or FePO4 were included in order to
have at hand a range of defined probes for the comparison
of DC reactivity towards different nanomaterials. These
reference particles of TiO2 or FePO4 form aggregates ran-
ging in size between 67 and 352 nm. The dissolution of
FePO4 nanoparticles in aqueous solutions is very low (<
5%) at pH ≥ 2 [19]. Traceable 100-nm polystyrene
(PS) particles were used exclusively as a size standard
for hydrodynamic diameter measurements. Based on a
sensitive Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay, all nano-
materials listed in Table 1 were free of endotoxin
contamination except a batch of commercial 50-nm PS
particles not used for subsequent biological assays.

 Steady-state DCs internalize food-grade nanomaterials
Mouse bone marrow cells were incubated with Flt3L to
generate immature DCs (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
The in vivo correlates of these Flt3L-generated popula-
tions are lymphoid tissue-resident DCs found under
steady-state conditions [2, 32, 33]. These immature DCs
were maintained in culture flasks or wells as cell suspen-
sions and their interaction with SAS particles (displaying
a primary particle size of 13 nm), FePO4 particles (with
a primary size of 11 nm) and TiO2 particles (with a
primary size of 33 nm), also suspended in cell culture
medium, was monitored by flow cytometry. The result-
ing side scatter (SSC) has been reported to reflect in-
ternal cellular structures due to particle uptake whereas
the front scatter (FSC) represents cell size [34, 35].
Upon incubation with SAS particles, the proportion
of DCs with elevated SSC values indicative of particle
uptake was increased in a dose-dependent manner
(Figs. 1a-c). In contrast, the front scatter (FSC) and,
hence, cell dimensions remained unchanged when
the DCs were exposed to SAS particles. Similar re-
sponses with elevated SSC and unchanged FSC were
observed upon incubation of DCs with FePO4 and TiO2
nanoparticles (Fig. 1d, Additional file 1: Figure S3). These
findings indicate that immature DCs readily interact with
all three types of nanomaterials resulting in particle in-
ternalization. Fig. 1a and d show that a lower concentra-
tion (125 μg ml−1) of FePO4 and TiO2 nanoparticles is
needed to achieve the same SSC shift as with 250 μg ml−1
SAS particles.
The uptake of food-grade SAS particles by immature
DCs was further investigated by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) after high-pressure cryo-fixation to
immobilize biological processes and visualize cellular
components, including membranes, at nanometer reso-
lution (Fig. 2a). This technique allows to confirm that
the interaction of DCs with particles leads to true in-
ternalization as compared to adsorption on the cell
surface. This electron microscopy approach showed that
the irregularly shaped SAS particles form extracellular
and intracellular aggregates. The electron micrographs
also revealed multiple protruding dendrites on the cell
surface (Fig. 2b) indicative of actin-dependent uptake
mechanisms [36, 37]. By closure of these membrane pro-
trusions, the SAS particle aggregates become trapped in
cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicles that have the ap-
pearance of endosomes (Fig. 2c). Analysis of membrane-
enclosed particle aggregates by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) on a scanning TEM instrument
confirmed their expected elemental composition, i.e.
mainly silicon and oxygen (Fig. 2d and Additional file 1:
Figure S4). As a control, analysis of the cellular back-
ground, not containing any SAS particles, revealed
signals of carbon (a normal biological constituent and
part of the embedding resin) and copper (from the TEM
specimen support grid). Analogous images showed that
immature DCs also internalize FePO4 and TiO2 nano-
particles and, as observed for SAS particles, localize
them to membrane-bound vesicles with the appearance
of endosomes (Additional file 1: Figure S5).

 Food-grade SAS particles cause induction of IL-1β in
steady-state DCs
To assess functional consequences of this nanomaterial
uptake into immature DCs, we determined cell viability
and secreted cytokine levels as biomarkers of inflamma-
tory reactions. Propidium iodide staining demonstrated
that immature DCs retained cell membrane integrity
when incubated with SAS particles at concentrations up
to 250 μg ml−1 (Additional file 1: Figure S6). However,
SAS particles are able to initiate secretion of mature IL-1β
from immature DCs even without any pre-stimulation,
usually referred to as “priming”, with an inflammatory
trigger (Fig. 3a). After 18-h incubations, we measured a
low background IL-1β release (< 100 pg ml−1) in control
reactions containing immature DCs and culture medium.
The addition of 13-nm SAS particles was sufficient to in-
crease this IL-1β production to levels of nearly 300 pg ml
−1 or higher. All subsequent assays were performed with
these more reactive 13-nm SAS particles.
Dose dependence experiments, again without DC
priming, revealed a significantly increased IL-1β secre-
tion into the cell culture medium at a SAS concentration
of 100 μg ml−1 (Fig. 3b), corresponding to a surface-
related nanomaterial density of 50 μg cm−2. In time
course experiments, again without priming, significantly
increased IL-1β secretion could be detected already
following 6 h after the addition of SAS particles (Fig. 3c).
Using small-molecule inhibitors, we next tested whether
the observed intracellular particle uptake (Figs. 1 and 2)
is necessary to induce cytokine release. IL-1β secretion
was reduced to baseline levels upon co-treatment of
DCs with SAS particles and cytochalasin D, which is a
broad inhibitor of actin-dependent processes [12], or
rottlerin, a selective inhibitor of macropinocytosis
(Fig. 3d) [37]. These inhibitor effects support the
conclusion that the IL-1β response to SAS particles
requires prior endocytic uptake by actin-mediated
mechanisms, primarily macropinocytosis. In contrast,

concentrations of SAS (13-nm primary diameter), 11-nm FePO4 or 33-nm TiO2 particles, and analyzed by flow cytometry. In culture medium, the
SAS particles form aggregates with a mean diameter of 127 nm. The forward scatter (FSC) depends on cell size whereas the side scatter (SSC)
reflects intracellular contents like granules [34, 35]. a Flow cytometry distributions demonstrating a SAS dose-dependent increase of DCs with

 despite their cellular uptake (Additional file 1: Figure S5),
FePO4 and TiO2 nanoparticles elicit no IL-1β secretion
(Fig. 3a). Thus, the observed initiation of cytokine release
is a response that is specific to certain particles like
food-grade SAS materials. In contrast to previous
studies [26, 27], the extracellular secretion of IL-1β in
response to SAS particles took place without any de-
tectable release of the cytokines IL-1α (Fig. 3e) and
TNF-α (Fig. 3f). Since contamination of the SAS
batches with endotoxin was excluded by a sensitive
Limulus amoebocyte lysate test (Table 1), it is con-
cluded that food-grade SAS particles are sufficient to
activate immature DCs and induce both the synthesis
and release of a potent inflammatory cytokine even
without preceding priming.
Mechanism of IL-1β induction by SAS particles
Because of its potent inflammatory action, IL-1β biogen-
esis is tightly regulated. First, an inactive pro-IL-1β pre-
cursor is synthesized, which is then cleaved by the
intracellular inflammasome complex (involving NLRP3
and caspase 1) to yield biologically active IL-1β (Fig. 4a)
[23–25]. In line with this well-known process, the release
of IL-1β upon stimulation with SAS particles was reduced
partially by co-treatment of DCs with the caspase inhibi-
tor Z-VAD (Fig. 3d), thus confirming that pro-IL-1β is
caspase-cleaved to yield mature IL-1β [9, 21].
Next, we analyzed whole cell lysates for the presence of
pro-IL-1β to understand whether this protein precursor
occurs constitutively in immature DCs or is newly induced
following SAS particle uptake. Immunoblot analyses using

 monoclonal antibodies against mouse pro-IL-1β showed
that, in their immature state, steady-state DCs contain low
levels of pro-IL-1β migrating in polyacrylamide gels as a
band with an expected size of 31 kDa. In incubations of
18 h, however, SAS particles were able like lipopolysacchar-
ide (LPS), a well-known inducer of pro-IL-1β used as posi-
tive control, to stimulate the de novo production of pro-
IL-1β (Fig. 4b). Dose dependence experiments revealed a
significantly increased pro-IL-1β level at a SAS concentra-
tion of 30 μg ml−1 (Fig. 4c), equivalent to a surface-related
nanomaterial density of 15 μg cm−2. Pro-IL-1β was also
induced upon a SAS treatment of immature DCs lacking
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4; Additional file 1: Figure S7). As
this particular pattern recognition receptor mediates DC
activation by endotoxin [5], the retained pro-IL-1β induc-
tion observed in its absence confirms that the response is
not due to endotoxin contamination. Further experiments
showed that pro-IL-1β was equally induced upon SAS
treatment of immature DCs lacking simultaneously TLR2,
TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 (Fig. 4d). As these pattern
recognition receptors mediate DC activation by pathogen
constituents like endotoxin (TLR2 and TLR4) or nucleic

 acids (TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9) [5], the retained pro-IL-1β
induction observed in their absence confirms that this re-
sponse is not due to microbial contamination. In remark-
able contrast but consistent with the results observed from
the IL-1β secretion experiments (Fig. 3a), pro-IL-1β is not
induced by FePO4 and TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 4e).
Considering that the particles are detected in vesicles
with the appearance of endosomes (Fig. 2), the mechanism
of pro-IL-1β induction by SAS was further delineated
using endosomal acidification inhibitors. Pro-IL-1β induc-
tion by SAS particles was reduced to baseline levels upon
co-treatment with chloroquine (Fig. 4f) or bafilomycin A1
(Additional file 1: Figure S8), which both inhibit the endo-
somal acidification process that is essential for TLR activa-
tion by pathogen-associated molecular patterns [38].
Stimulation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB in
response to endosomal TLR activation, except for TLR3,
further depends on the MyD88 adapter [5]. Therefore, we
next tested the response of immature DCs lacking MyD88
(MyD88−/−) in comparison to wild type (MyD88+/+) con-
trols. These experiments demonstrated that DCs lose the
ability to induce pro-IL-1β in response to SAS exposure in
the absence of MyD88 (Fig. 4g). To validate this finding,
we needed to confirm that, like wild-type counterparts,
Fig. 4 Induction of pro-IL-1β by food-grade SAS particles depends on MyD88. Immature DCs were incubated (18 h, 37 °C) with particles to test for
IL-1β induction. Asterisks denote significant differences between SAS treatments and controls (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). a

 MyD88-deficient DCs retained the ability to express IL-1β
in response to an appropriate stimulus. This proof was
provided
by
incubating
these
MyD88−/−
DCs
with
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic ana-
log of double-stranded RNA that activates TLR3, whose
downstream signaling is independent of MyD88 [5]. A
side-by-side quantification demonstrated that the induc-
tion of pro-IL-1β upon SAS exposure is totally missing in
MyD88−/− DCs (Fig. 4h). In combination, these experi-
ments link for the first time an endosomal pattern recog-
nition process to SAS particles.
Display of maturation markers
Immature DCs are distinguishable from those emerging
during inflammation by their molecular phenotype [39].
For example, immature DCs are characterized by low
surface expression of CD69, but the presentation of this
maturation marker is increased upon incubation with
SAS particles. CD69 up regulation occurs with both
major subsets of steady-state DCs, i.e., with conventional
and plasmacytoid DCs (Fig. 5a). Conventional DCs are
further characterized by low CD40, which is increased
upon exposure to SAS particles (Fig. 5b). Plasmacytoid
DCs are further characterized by low CD40/CD86 and
high CD62L, but incubation with SAS particles in-
creased CD40 and CD86 on their surface, whereas
CD62L levels were reduced (Fig. 5c and d). Thus, in re-
sponse to SAS particles, immature DCs not only induce
the synthesis of pro-IL-1β but also undergo a dose-
dependent maturation program involving shifts in mul-
tiple surface markers exemplified by CD69, CD40, CD86
and CD62L. This finding confirms the ability of SAS parti-
cles to activate immature DCs.
Discussion
This study is fundamentally different from earlier reports
describing the interaction of DCs with nanomaterials in
four main aspects. First, the ability of nanomaterials to
trigger IL-1β secretion from DCs was previously demon-
strated after pro-inflammatory priming of these cells to
induce expression of the pro-IL-1β precursor. Conse-
quently, these previous reports demonstrated that certain
nanomaterials activate the inflammasome, which is an
enzymatic complex that cleaves preformed pro-IL-1β to

 liberate active IL-1β [9, 12]. In contrast, we found that
completely immature (unprimed) DCs respond to food-
grade SAS particles by a de novo induction of the pro-IL-
1β precursor. This response was absent when unprimed
DCs were exposed to FePO4 and TiO2 nanoparticles.
Second, we show that the newly discovered pro-IL-1β
induction in response to food-grade SAS particles is sup-
pressed by pharmacologic inhibitors of endosomal TLR
activation. Third, our study reveals that pro-IL-1β induc-
tion in response to food-grade SAS particles is dependent
on MyD88, an adapter protein essential for signaling
downstream of members of the TLR family. So far, a role
of MyD88 had been described for the inflammatory
response to crystalline silica [40] but not to amorphous
silica. Fourth, earlier reports were limited to inflammatory
DCs derived from blood or bone marrow cultures stimu-
lated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) [9, 12]. However, GM-CSF drives the
differentiation of monocytes towards a special DC subset
that sustains inflammation during exceptionally high
demand like sepsis [1, 4, 41]. These inflammatory DCs
differ from the Flt3L-derived immature DCs used in our
study, whose function is to maintain tissue homeostasis by
tuning immunologic responses [1, 2, 32]. It is known that
particle sedimentation rates influence the amount of ma-
terial that comes in contact with cells. Existing simulation
models [42, 43] are limited to the exposure of cell mono-
layers and not suited to estimate effective doses in cell
suspensions. Therefore, we experimentally compared the
cellular dose by exploiting shifts of the SSC parameter in
flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 1). This comparison shows
that the reactions elicited by SAS particles, but not
by FePO4 and TiO2 particles, cannot be explained by
dosimetric
considerations,
since
a
slightly
higher
concentration of the SAS material was required to
reach the same cell exposure as that reached with
FePO4 and TiO2 particles.
Protective immunity is supported by IL-1β but, if not
controlled, this highly inflammatory cytokine may con-
tribute to autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases
[25]. Normally, IL-1β production is regulated by two
independent signals. A first stimulus, such as LPS, mi-
crobial nucleic acids, IL-1α or TNF-α, prompts the syn-
thesis of inactive pro-IL-1β by transcriptional induction
[26, 27]. A second stimulus leads to the assembly of a
large multiprotein complex termed inflammasome that,
upon sensing exogenous pathogen-associated molecular pat-
terns or endogenous stress-associated danger signals, cleaves
pro-IL-1β to release mature IL-1β [9, 12, 21, 23, 24]. In a
model of acute pulmonary inflammation, Rabolli et al. de-
scribe a sequential mechanism in which lung-injected silica
is taken up by macrophages, thus leading to cytotoxicity
[26]. The following release of IL-1α and TNF-α from nec-
rotic macrophages stimulates the expression of pro-IL-1β,
which is then cleaved upon silica-dependent inflammasome
activation for the secretion of active IL-1β [26]. In contrast
to this sequential scenario, our present analysis with imma-
ture DCs (reflecting steady-state DCs in tissues) reveals a
one-hit mechanism whereby food grade SAS particles in-
duce pro-IL-1β expression in the absence of cytotoxic reac-
tions and IL-1α or TNF-α bursts.
This direct pro-IL-1β induction depends on MyD88,
which is the central adapter that conveys endosomal
TLR-signaling to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines via
NFκB activation [6, 7], but pro-IL-1β induction is not
dependent on the pattern recognition receptors TLR2,
TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9. The acidification of endo-
somal contents is an essential process for TLR activation
by pathogens [38]. Thus, the finding that endosomal
acidification inhibitors like chloroquine or bafilomycin A
completely abrogate pro-IL-1β induction by food-grade
SAS particles indicates that an endosomal pattern recog-
nition receptor, likely another TLR, must constitute their
molecular sensor. In any case, this proven dependence
on endosomal acidification and MyD88 signaling argues
against other mechanisms for example associated with
cytotoxicity or increased K+ efflux through the cell
membrane [44, 45].
As summarized in Fig. 6, our findings indicate that
steady-state DCs take up nanostructured SAS particles
by actin-dependent macropinocytosis, inhibited by cyto-
chalasin and rottlerin (Fig. 3d), and localize the particles
to endosomal vesicles (Fig. 2). Upon endosomal acidifi-
cation, inhibited by chloroquine or bafilomycin A (Fig.
4g), the unique nanostructured surface pattern of SAS
particle aggregates is recognized by TLRs on endosomal
membranes.
This
unexpected
TLR
engagement
is
highlighted by the finding that the SAS particle-induced
pro-IL-1β synthesis is suppressed upon deletion of
MyD88 (Fig. 4g and h), which for most TLRs constitutes
the
obligate
mediator of
downstream
signaling.
In
steady-state DCs, the tested food-grade SAS particles
mimic both the signal for inducing pro-IL-1β expression
(Fig. 4) and the signal for activating pro-IL-1β cleavage
to release IL-1β (Fig. 3). With respect to the concentra-
tion used for in vitro experiments, it is important to
consider the effective local dose of particles that comes
in contact with target cells in the organism [46]. We
used a realistic range because, even if only a small frac-
tion of daily ingested SAS materials accumulates over
time in lymphoid tissues [28, 29, 31], persisting particles
may reach locally in the intestinal lymphoid tissue the
15 μg cm−2 density that in our experiments is sufficient
for a marked IL-1β induction.
Conclusion
Nanostructured SAS particles initiate the endosomal
MyD88 pathogen pattern recognition and signaling

 pathway in steady-state DCs. The resulting de novo DC
activation and pro-IL-1β induction, without the need for
any concomitant cytotoxic or inflammatory trigger, sug-
gests that SAS particles should be used in food more cau-
tiously than current practice. Based on studies in rodents
not assessing immunological endpoints, a lifelong dietary
intake of 1.5 g SAS daily (Additional file 1: Figure S9) per
adult is currently considered safe (reviewed in [47]). It has
been suggested that a disruption of the gatekeeping func-
tion of DCs may trigger long-term inflammatory re-
sponses that contribute to the increased incidence of
inflammatory bowel disease or other chronic intestinal
disorders [11, 28]. It is still necessary to carefully ascertain,
in animal studies focused on reactions of the gut-
associated lymphoid tissue, whether the newly discovered
DC activation and pro-IL-1β induction by food-grade SAS
particles occurs in vivo and causes adverse effects. It is for
example possible that a particle-induced IL-1β release is
counteracted in the context of the intestinal mucosa by
the presence of IL-1β receptor antagonist. In any case, in
view of the unexpected one-hit mechanism of cytokine
production elicited by food-grade SAS particles in
steady-state DCs, we advocate a prudent use of these
and related nanomaterials to avoid excessive human
exposure from food.
Methods
Particles and Characterization
Food-grade SAS particles, produced by flame hydrolysis
according to the Aerosil method [48], were obtained
from Evonik (formerly Degussa). Their mean primary
particle sizes are 7 and 13 nm based on measured BET
surface areas of 326 m2 g−1 and 175 m2 g−1, respectively.
These same SAS particles were also characterized thor-
oughly by others [15, 16]. TiO2 anatase with an average
particle size of 33 nm (based on a measured BET surface
area of 47 m2 g−1) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Food-grade
TiO2 anatase with an average particle size of 140 nm
(based on a measured BET surface area of 11 m2 g−1)
was from Sachtleben. FePO4 nanoparticles with an aver-
age particle size of 11 and 21 nm (based on measured
BET surface areas of 188 m2 g−1 and 98 m2 g−1, respect-
ively) were produced by flame spray pyrolysis according to
a published method [19] with minor adaptations to obtain
the desired particle sizes. Iron nitrate nonahydrate (purity
≥97.0%,
Riedel-de-Haën/Sigma-Aldrich)
and
tributyl
phosphate (purity 97%; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in a
1:1 (vol/vol) mixture of ethanol (abs. Denat. 2% 2-
butanone, Alcosuisse) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (purity
≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich) at a total metal concentration of
0.5 mol l−1 or 0.4 mol l−1 for 21-nm FePO4 and 11-nm
FePO4, respectively. This precursor solution was fed at 3
or 7 ml min−1 into the FSP spray nozzles by a syringe
pump (Lambda, VIT-FIT) and atomized with 5 or 7 l min
−1 oxygen (pressure drop 1.5 bar). The spray was ignited
by a methane/oxygen (2.5 l min−1 each) ring-shaped
flame. Additionally, 5 l min−1 (sheath) O2 was supplied.
All gas flow rates were regulated by mass flow controllers
(Bronkhorst, EL-FLOW). Using a vacuum pump (Busch,
Mink MM1202 AV), particles were collected on water-
cooled
teflon
membrane-filters
(BHA Technologies
AG) placed at least 65 cm above the burner. Amino-
modified PS particles with a primary particle diameter
of 50 nm were obtained from Bangs Laboratories.
The detailed characterization of all nanomaterials is
summarized in Table 1.
For visualization of particle shape by TEM, the nano-
material were dispersed in H2O, deposited on a parlo-
dion foil supported on a copper grid and analyzed on a
CM12 microscope (FEI, operated at an acceleration volt-
age of 100 kV). For endotoxin analyses, particles were
suspended in endotoxin-free water (Charles River) by
Fig. 6 Scheme summarizing the single-hit mechanism of IL-1β secretion by steady-state DCs exposed to food-grade SAS particles. In immature
DCs, pro-IL-1β is not expressed, but its induction takes place upon uptake of SAS particles into endosomes and MyD88-dependent TLR signaling.
Cleavage of the newly expressed pro-IL-1β precursor by the inflammasome-associated caspase leads to IL-1β secretion. In addition, the immature
DCs undergo maturation involving shifts in multiple surface markers. IL-1β secretion in response to SAS particles is suppressed by cytochalasin or
rottlerin (inhibitors of actin-dependent macropinocytosis), by chloroquine or bafilomycin A (inhibitors of endosomal TLR activation), by genetic
ablation of MyD88 (the central adapter of TLR signaling) and by Z-VAD (an inhibitor of the inflammasome-associated caspase)

 mixing for 30 s on a vortex followed by sonication for
10 min in a Sonorex Digitec waterbath (Bandelin Elec-
tronic) at 35 kHz and 80 W. Then particle suspension
was assayed using the Endosafe-PTS system (Charles
River) equipped with highest sensitivity cartridges with a
limit of detection of 0.005 endotoxin units (EU) ml–1.
This validated test controls for interferences with colori-
metric measurements using two internal endotoxin
spikes according to guidelines of the Food and Drug
Administration. In particular, the acceptance range for
spike recovery of 50–200% excludes that the tested
particles interfere with the assay by assuring that there is
no signal inhibition or enhancement due to particles
[49]. For exposure of cells, particles were suspended in
complete cell culture medium [RPMI-1640 GlutaMAX,
10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (from
PAA), 100 U ml–1 penicillin, 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin
and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (all from Invitrogen)] by
mixing and sonication as described above. Fresh particle
suspensions were prepared for every experiment and
used within 15 min after sonication. SAS suspensions in
complete medium remained stable for 24 h, as assessed
by hydrodynamic size measurements.
Stimulation of Immature DCs
Immature DCs were generated from mouse bone mar-
row [33]. Briefly, femurs and tibiae of C57BL/6 wild-type
mice (or MyD88- and TLR-deficient mice in a C57BL/6
background) were flushed with culture medium and the
released progenitor cells were filtered through a 70-μm
cell strainer (BD Falcon), centrifuged, reconstituted in
complete medium and incubated for 8 days in the pres-
ence of 200 ng ml−1 Flt3L (BioXcell). For each culture,
the amount of live CD11c+ DCs, the proportion of plas-
macytoid DCs (CD11c+B220+) and conventional DCs
(CD11c+B220−CD11bhighSIRPα+
and
CD11c+
B220
−CD11bintermediateSIRPα−) were verified by flow cytome-
try (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Stimulation assays were
conducted as previously published [50]. Immature DCs,
which grow as cell suspensions, were transferred to 96-
well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) containing complete cell
culture medium (200 μl/well) and challenged with the
indicated
concentrations
of
particles
suspended
in
medium for the time indicated. Realistic SAS particle
dose concentrations (30 to 250 μg ml−1) were derived
from a recent publication, where silica concentrations of
up to 300 μg g−1 tissue in the spleen of rodents after re-
peated oral administration of SAS particles were re-
ported [31].
Control incubations were carried out with ultra-pure
LPS (from Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich),
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C, InvivoGen) or
unmethylated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligonucleo-
tides containing a CpG motif (ODN1668, TIB Molbiol).
The inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (InvivoGen), cytochalasin
D (Enzo Life Sciences), rottlerin (Sigma-Aldrich) and Z-
VAD-FMK (Bachem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfox-
ide and added as indicated. Chloroquine diphosphate
salt (Sigma-Aldrich) was added as indicated.
DC Phenotype and Maturation
DCs were stained on ice with conjugated antibodies
against CD11c (N418, PE-labeled), CD11b (M1/70, PE-
Cy7-labeled), B220 (RA3-6B2, APC-eFluor 780-labeled),
SIRPα (P84, APC-labeled), CD40 (1C10, PE-labeled),
CD62L (MEL-14, APC-labeled), CD69 (H1.2F3, APC-
labeled) and CD86 (GL1, PE-labeled) purchased from
eBioscience. A FACSCanto II flow cytometry instrument
(BD Biosciences) was employed to acquire 50,000 events.
Dead cells were stained and excluded from analyses
using propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich). Single-color
and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls were pre-
pared and analyzed along with multi-color samples. Flow
cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo (Version 10,
TreeStar).
Cryo-fixation and Electron Microscopy
Immature
DCs
were
transferred
to
12-well
plates
(3 × 106 cells/well) containing cell culture medium
(1 ml/well). After incubation with particles (250 μg ml
−1), cells were prefixed with 0.25% (vol/vol) glutaralde-
hyde and immediately high-pressure frozen in capillary
cellulose tubes using an EM HPM 100 device (Leica). Fro-
zen cells were transferred into a substitution unit (EM-
AFS2, Leica) precooled to −90 °C for substitution with
acetone containing 5% water. The subsequent fixation was
carried out with 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetraoxide, 0.25%
(vol/vol) glutaraldehyde raising the temperature to 20 °C,
then the cells were embedded in epon. Ultrathin (70 nm)
sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead cit-
rate for 1 or 15 min [51] and examined in a transmission
electron microscope (CM12, Philips) equipped with a
CCD camera (Ultrascan 1000, Gatan) at an acceleration
voltage of 100 kV. Elemental analysis of selected samples
was conducted on a scanning transmission electron
microscope (G2 Spirit, FEI Tecnai) equipped with a high
angle annular dark field detector (HAADF) and an X-Max
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detection sys-
tem for elemental analysis (Oxford). Gatan digital micro-
graph was used for image acquisition and Oxford INCA
for EDX operation and control.
Immunoassays
IL-1β concentrations in cell culture supernatants were
detected using the IL-1β DuoSet kit (R&D Systems) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was
measured at 405-nm wavelength (reference wavelength
492 nm) with a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader
Winkler et al. Particle and Fibre Toxicology  (2017) 14:21 
Page 11 of 13
 (Molecular Devices). Mouse IL-1α and TNF-α concen-
trations in cell culture supernatants were detected using
the IL-1α and TNF-α Ready-SET-Go kits (eBioscience)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance
was measured at 450-nm wavelength (reference wave-
length 570 nm) with a Epoch 2 microplate reader (Bio-
Tek). For Western blotting, cells were washed three
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and whole
cell lysates were prepared using M-PER buffer (Life-
Technologies). Equal volumes of cell lysate were resolved
on 4–20% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gradient gels (TGX
Stainfree) and the separated proteins were transferred to
TurboBlot PVDF membranes (both from BioRad). For
immunodetection, membranes were blocked with 10%
(wt/vol) milk in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.1% (vol/
vol) Tween-20, for 1 h at room temperature and probed
overnight with monoclonal antibodies against mouse IL-
1β (Cell Signaling) and actin (Millipore). After incubation
with matching secondary antibodies, chemiluminescence
was detected using the ChemiDoc MP gel documentation
instrument (BioRad).
Statistical Analysis
Mean and standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) were cal-
culated for all quantitative parameters using GraphPad
Prism 6.0. Results were expressed as mean ± s.e.m. of
multiple determinations with independent DC cultures.
Comparisons were conducted by one-way ANOVA with
Dunnet’s correction or unpaired two-tailed t-test, as indi-
cated in the figure legends. A statistically significant differ-
ence was assumed for p < 0.05.
