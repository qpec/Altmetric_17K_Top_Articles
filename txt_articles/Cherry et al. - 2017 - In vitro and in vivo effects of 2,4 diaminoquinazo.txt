Abstract
C5-substituted 2,4-diaminoquinazoline inhibitors of the decapping scavenger enzyme DcpS
(DAQ-DcpSi) have been developed for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),
which is caused by genetic deficiency in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. These
compounds are claimed to act as SMN2 transcriptional activators but data underlying that
claim are equivocal. In addition it is unclear whether the claimed effects on SMN2 are a
direct consequence of DcpS inhibitor or might be a consequence of lysosomotropism, which
is known to be neuroprotective. DAQ-DcpSi effects were characterized in cells in vitro utiliz-
ing DcpS knockdown and 7-methyl analogues as probes for DcpS vs non-DcpS-mediated
effects. We also performed analysis of Smn transcript levels, RNA-Seq analysis of the tran-
scriptome and SMN protein in order to identify affected pathways underlying the therapeutic
effect, and studied lysosomotropic and non-lysosomotropic DAQ-DCpSi effects in 2B/- SMA
mice. Treatment of cells caused modest and transient SMN2 mRNA increases with either
no change or a decrease in SMNΔ7 and no change in SMN1 transcripts or SMN protein.

 RNA-Seq analysis of DAQ-DcpSi-treated N2a cells revealed significant changes in expres-
sion (both up and down) of approximately 2,000 genes across a broad range of pathways.
Treatment of 2B/- SMA mice with both lysomotropic and non-lysosomotropic DAQ-DcpSi
compounds had similar effects on disease phenotype indicating that the therapeutic mecha-
nism of action is not a consequence of lysosomotropism. In striking contrast to the findings
in vitro, Smn transcripts were robustly changed in tissues but there was no increase in SMN
protein levels in spinal cord. We conclude that DAQ-DcpSi have reproducible benefit in
SMA mice and a broad spectrum of biological effects in vitro and in vivo, but these are com-
plex, context specific, and not the result of simple SMN2 transcriptional activation.
Introduction
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an inherited, autosomal recessive neuromuscular condition
and a common genetic cause of mortality in infants and children. The disease is characterized
by loss of function and ultimately degeneration of lower motor neurons whose cell bodies are
located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. At a genetic level SMA is caused by deletion or
(less commonly) other loss-of-function mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1)
gene [1, 2]. Duplication and inversion of a region of chromosome 5q13 encompassing this and
several other genes occurred in H.sapiens’ distant evolutionary past but the acquisition of the
characteristic nucleotide differences between SMN1 and SMN2 occurred only since the diver-
gence of chimpanzees and man from their common ancestor [3]. A C/T substitution in exon 7
of SMN2 disrupts an exon splicing enhancer sequence with the result that the majority of tran-
scripts produced from this gene are alternatively spliced, missing exon 7, and produce a trun-
cated, unstable SMN protein. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of SMN2 transcripts are full
length and encode a fully functional 294 amino acid SMN protein identical to that produced
from the SMN1 gene. For this reason, and because it exists in the population in variable copy
number, SMN2 functions as a disease modifier gene such that higher copy number tends to be
associated with milder disease [4]. All SMA patients have at least one copy of SMN2, presum-
ably because complete absence of SMN protein is embryonic lethal in humans, as is the case in
mice [5].
The presence of the SMN2 gene in all SMA patients provides an attractive opportunity for
therapeutic approaches aimed at increasing the amount of full length SMN protein produced
from this gene. This philosophy underpinned the use of a SMN2 promoter β-lactamase
(βLAC) reporter gene assay to screen a library of over half a million compounds for transcrip-
tional activators [6]. After hit confirmation, removal of false positives due to fluorescence, and
dose-response determination, this effort resulted in 17 unique compounds belonging to 9 dif-
ferent structural scaffolds, one of which (C5-substituted 2,4 diaminoquinazolines, DAQ)
formed the basis for medicinal chemistry optimization using the βLAC assay. This effort
resulted in two compounds that have demonstrated efficacy in 3 different mouse models of
SMA [7–9]. In parallel, a protein microarray experiment identified the decapping scavenger
enzyme DcpS as a binding partner of these compounds, which bind to the DcpS active site and
inhibit catalytic activity with a potency correlated with their activity in the βLAC assay [10].
These findings led to the proposal that DcpS inhibition is responsible for the activity of these
compounds in the βLAC assay. The mechanism(s) whereby DcpS inhibition could result in an
apparent increase in SMN2 promoter activity have been speculated as being secondary to an
accumulation of methylated nucleotide levels causing sequestration of cap binding proteins

 and thereby inhibition of one or more of the cap-dependent processes such as pre-mRNA
splicing or 5’-3’ exonucleolytic decay. However, direct evidence to support such a mechanistic
link between DcpS and SMN2 promoter activity is lacking. Furthermore, the evidence that the
therapeutic effect of such diaminoquinazoline DcpS inhibitor (DAQ-DcpSi) compounds is the
result of elevation of SMN is equivocal. It has been reported that compound 11a (subsequently
designated as D156844) elevated the endogenous mouse Smn mRNA in NSC-34 cells, raised
SMN protein levels and dramatically increased the numbers of SMN-positive nuclear foci
(gems) in SMA patient fibroblasts [11]. However, when dosed to SMA Δ7 mice, the same com-
pound had no statistically significant effect on either SMN2 or SMNΔ7 transcript levels or
SMN protein in CNS tissues, nor did it have any statistically significant effect on snRNP
assembly, a function of the Smn complex that is defective in SMA [9]. More recently [8] the
compound RG3039 (also known as D157495) was shown to improve survival, motor function,
neuromuscular junction architecture and electrophysiology in 2B/- SMA mice, causing pro-
found and prolonged inhibition of tissue DcpS activity. However these beneficial effects also
occurred in the absence of any change in SMN protein levels in the CNS or any of the periph-
eral tissues studied. In contrast, in the same study the SMN-containing nuclear bodies known
as Gems were reported to increase in the nuclear compartment of choline acetyltransferase-
positive neurons from the spinal cord. A similar study did report modest but statistically sig-
nificant elevations of both full length and Δ7 SMN transcripts in SMAΔ7 mice treated with
RG3039, but no detectable change in SMN protein or snRNP assembly [7]. Therefore the
assumption based on their mode of discovery that DAQ-DcpSi exert their therapeutic benefit
in SMA mice via positive modulation of SMN is not consistently supported by the totality of
the evidence, nor is it clear what effects may be due to DcpS inhibition per se versus other
properties of the compounds such as lysosomotropism.
Therefore the current studies were undertaken to provide a comprehensive survey of the
effects of DAQ-DcpSi in cells, study the role of DcpS inhibition and test whether non-lysoso-
motropic DAQ-DCpSi have beneficial effects in SMA mice.
Materials and methods
Synthesis of DAQ-DcpSi and their 7-methyl derivatives and in vitro DcpS
inhibition assay
A separate report describes the synthesis of novel diaminoquinazoline compounds [12]. The
inhibitory potency of compounds was performed in an assay volume of 20 μl containing 0.05
nM recombinant human DcpS, varying amounts of compound in a buffer of composition 50
mM Tris, 20 mM MgCl2, 60 mM (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.9. Incubations were initiated by the addi-
tion of 50 nM m7GpppA-biotin substrate and proceeded for 45 min at room temperature
before being terminated by the addition of 1 μM D156844 [11]. Production of ADP-biotin was
quantitated by transferring 18 μl of the quenched reaction (or biotin-ADP standard) to a
streptavidin-coated plate (Pierce), incubating for 2 hours then washing 3 times followed by
detection using an anti-ADP mouse antibody (Bellbrook lab) and an HRP-conjugated Goat
anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).
Cell culture
SMA patient lymphoblasts (GM23689 or GM23686, Coriell Institute biorepository) were
grown in Advanced RPMI supplemented with 2% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37˚C in
5% CO2. Cells are maintained in suspension at a density of between 200,000–1,000,000 cells
per mL. For drug treatment, cells were plated in 24-well dishes at 500,000 cells per well (1 mL

 at 0.5 million cells per mL). 1μL of each compound or DMSO was added to each well (0.1%
DMSO final) and incubated for 24 hours. SMA patient and carrier-derived fibroblasts
(GM03813 and GM03814, respectively, Coriell Institute biorepository) were grown in Cascade
106 media supplemented with low serum growth supplement (LSGS) at 37˚C in 5% CO2. For
drug treatment, cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 20,000–40,000 cells per well. Two wells
were collected for each data point and pooled to generate a single lysate. Compounds were
added as appropriate to reach desired final concentration and incubated for 72 hours or 6–7
days with fresh media and compound added every 24 hours. Neural progenitor cell (NPC) cul-
tures (GM24468, Corriell Institute biorepository) were generated and maintained according to
Reinhardt et al [13]. For treatment, NPCs were plated on geltrex coated 6-well dishes at a den-
sity of 60,000 cells per cm2 then incubated overnight. Compound or DMSO was included as
appropriate to reach the desired concentration (final DMSO of 0.2%) with fresh media every
24 hrs. HEK-293T (ATCC- CRL-3216) and Hela-S3 (ATCC CCL-2.2) cells were grown as
described for HEK-293T below.
Knockdown experiments
HEK-293T cells were grown in DMEM high glucose Glutamax (Life Technologies #10569010)
supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37˚C in 8% CO2. For lentivirus
infection by spinoculation, 50,000 cells in growth DMEM were mixed with 1 μL of polybrene
at 8 mg/mL and 100 μL of virus at 1 x 106 TDU/mL in a final volume of 1 mL. This gave an
MOI of 2. The samples were spun at 800 xg for 30 minutes at RT. Media was removed and
cells were replated in 48 well dishes and incubated over the weekend. Puromycin was used for
4 days at 2 mg/mL to select for stable cell lines. Lentiviruses were from Sigma MISSION collec-
tion and in the pLKO.1 vector -TRC version 2 -Puro marker (details provided in S1 Table).
For compound treatment studies, cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 300,000 cells per well
and incubated overnight. The cells were then treated for 24 hours with DMSO or RG3039 at a
final concentration of 10 nM and 100 nM.
Reporter gene assays
The SMN2 reporter cell line [14, 15] was cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin. Reporter cells media was
supplemented with hygromycin during maintenance. All cells were maintained at 37˚C and
5˚C CO2. After seeding in 96-well white tissue culture plates at 25,000 per well, cells were incu-
bated overnight before being exposed to different doses of compounds or DMSO for 24 hrs.
The final DMSO concentration was kept constant at 0.1% (v/v). Firefly and renilla luciferase
expression were assayed with DualGlo (Promega E2920) and measured on a PHERAstar FS
microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Relative light units are normalized to DMSO control and
expressed as a percentage.
Western blot analysis
Cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH.7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 6M
Urea, and protease inhibitor). Lysates were incubated at 95˚C for 5 minutes and cleared at
14,000 RPM for 15 minutes. Cleared lysates were quantified by BCA assay. A total of 5 μg of
each lysate was mixed with NuPage LDS sample buffer with 100uM DTT and loaded and sepa-
rated on a NuPage 10% Bis-Tris gel. Proteins were transferred to 0.2 micron nitrocellulose
using the BioRad Turbo Transfer system. Protein bands were visualized using HPA039632
mouse anti-DcpS (Sigma Prestige), 2F1 mouse anti-SMN1(Cell Signalling), and DM1a mouse

 anti-alpha tubulin (Cell Signaling) antibodies and imaged and quantified using the GE Health-
care ImageQuant LAS4000.
Cell experiments: RNA isolation, quantitation, cDNA synthesis, and
analysis by ddPCR
Cell pellets were lysed in RLT and the RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen
with modifications to the protocol. 700μl of RPE buffer was used instead of 500μl and the col-
umns were mixed by tilting to wash the leftover RW1 Buffer from the cap. RNA was quantified
using the NanoDrop 8000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer and confirmed using the Readiplate 96
RiboGreen RNA quantification kit. A260/A230 ratios were typically 1.8 or above. 500 ng RNA
was used to synthesize cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). The cDNA was
diluted to 5 ng/μL. Taqman assays were set-up using 5 μL of cDNA (25 ng of total RNA) with
the 2x droplet PCR Supermix (BioRad). Droplets were generated using the QX200 Droplet
Generator (BioRad) and a two-step PCR reaction (95˚C for 5 min; 95˚C for 30 sec and 59˚C
for 1 min for 40 cycles; 98˚C for 10 min; and 4˚C hold). Droplets were read on the QX200
Droplet reader and quantified using the Quantasoft software (BioRad). Details of primer/
probe sets are provided in supplementary data (S2 and S3 Tables).
Preparation of RNA, miRNA, cDNA library preparation and RNA-Seq
profiling of N2a cells treated with RG3039 or PF-06738066
N2a cells (ATCC- CCL-131) were cultured in DMEM high glucose Glutamax (Life Technolo-
gies #10569010) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37˚C in 5% CO2.
3 x 106 cells were plated in 10 cm dishes (4 replicates per condition) and incubated overnight
before being treated for 24 hours with 1 μM RG3039, 1 μM PF-06802336, or DMSO vehicle
control. Cells were then pelleted and lysed in RLT and the RNA was purified according to the
protocol for the Qiagen miRNeasy kit to separate and enrich small RNA and large (>200 nt)
fractions separately. Large and small RNA was quantified using the NanoDrop 8000 UV/Vis
spectrophotometer and large RNA quality was confirmed using Bioanalyzer (Aglient). RNA
quality was also validated using qPCR for DcpS responsive genes. RNA fractions were used for
cDNA library preparation which was performed using Truseq mRNA v2 reagents or Tailor-
Mix miRNA reagents (RS-122-2101 Illumina, San Diego CA, USA and TM302 Seqmatic, Fre-
mont CA, USA). Libraries were run on a Nextseq 500 (Illumina) using a paired-end run
(2x75bp) generating ~60 million reads per library for the mRNA-seq and 1x75bp generating
~5 million reads per library for the miRNA-seq. Demultiplexing, alignment, and differential
analysis for the mRNA-seq were performed as described below. For the miRNA alignment,
briefly the sequences between 16 and 35 nucleotides with average phred score � 30 were
retained for analysis. The reads were first mapped to mouse miRNAs using Bowtie [16] with-
out allowing for mismatches. Instead of discarding the remaining reads, we explored the possi-
bilities of RNA editing to include potential isomiRs [17]. These reads were mapped to
miRNAs that have at most 1 base mismatch, a substitution at the 5’ or 3’ ends, or have 1 or 2
extra bases at either ends. Although 1 base mismatch would include 1 base substitution/dele-
tion/addition at the ends, we made sure that 1 base mismatch was inside the miRNA and that
all categories were mutually exclusive. Reads mapping to protein coding exons and other small
RNAs were removed prior to mapping to miRNAs. Reads that uniquely mapped to miRNAs
were considered and were profiled as: 1) identical to miRNAs, 2) perfect match to miRNAs
but are of shorter length (no more than 5 bases short), 3) mapping to miRNAs with 1 substitu-
tion, 1 or 2 extra bases at 3’ and 5’ ends and with those with at most 1 mismatch (occurring
inside the sequence and not on ends), 4) mapping to the precursor miRNA. Thus, steps 2–4

 constitute “IsomiRs”-alternative forms of the mature miRNAs. We merged the counts of reads
identical to a miR and those mapping to isomeric forms as they are found to have identical/
very similar functions [18]. The unaligned reads were mapped to the mouse genome and an
internally developed database of rRNAs from bacteria, fungi, plant and eukaryotes to detect
presence of contaminants. For differential analysis of miRNAs, only those with counts of �5
in at least 1/3rd samples (treatment vs control) were considered for analysis. The counts were
normalized and analyzed using EdgeR [19] packages in R-Bioconductor. The P-values were
corrected by FDR for multiple testing and miRNAs with FDR �15% and |FC|>1.5 were con-
sidered to be differentially expressed.
SMA mouse studies
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was
approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Anne and Robert H.
Lurie Children’s Hospital (IACUC Number: 16–005). No special training in animal handling
or care was required for these studies and all efforts were taken to limit any potential animal
distress as described for housing and humane functional endpoints noted below. Personnel
conducting studies followed the approved standard operating procedures for daily monitoring,
dosing, weaning and euthanasia according to the approved study protocol. All adult mice were
monitored at least weekly for health and housed in a pathogen-free controlled animal facility,
fed ad libitum water and food (chow NIH-31) with a 12 hr light:12 hr dark photoperiod. Smn
+/- mice in an FVB/N congenic background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar
Harbor, Maine (strain # 6214). Line maintenance was maintained by interbreeding of the con-
genic line and every 4th generation mice were outbred to wild type FBV/N mice (jax # 001800)
to reduce the possibility of new mutations within the line. Smn 2B mice were internally devel-
oped and maintained in the DiDonato laboratory. To generate the SMA mice used in this
study an intercross between Smn 2B/2B and Smn +/- mice was performed. This generated lit-
ters in which 50% of the offspring were control (2B/+) and 50% SMA (2B/-). The day of birth
was considered to be P0. If pups were born after 3pm, the following day was considered P0. At
P1, pups were counted. If greater than 10 pups to a cage, pups were randomly chosen and
moved to another cage to increase litter size, culled to reduce litter size or genotyped at P1 and
culled at P2 to reduce litter size to 10 or fewer pups. Thereafter, no culling of pups was per-
formed for drug studies. Individual mice were genotyped from DNA obtained from tail snips
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All mice were weaned at P21 and separated into male
and female cages. In total, 412 mice were used (132 mice for single dose PK analysis of adult
wild type (Smn+/+) and P13 2B/+ and 2B/- with the results reported in supplemental file 1;
205 mice were generated for the survival study and 115 were generated to be used for PK and
tissue harvest from P4-P16 drug dosing). All compounds were provided to the investigator as
pre-prepared dosing solutions once/week during study. The investigator was blinded to com-
pound/vehicle identity. The vehicle was 2% Polyvinyl pyrrolidone/1% Poloxamer (Pluronic
F108) and the drugs PF-06687859 (RG3039) and PF-06738066 (nanosuspension) were pre-
pared in the same. Dosing solutions were prepared to deliver the indicated dose using a dosing
volume of 2.5 μL/g body weight. For the PK single dose studies a single ip injection was used.
For survival studies drug level and tissue harvest mice from P4-P16 treatment, mice were
treated twice daily (b.i.d.) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection starting on P4 and continuing
until P20 or the sacrifice of the animals, whichever occurred sooner. The dosing interval was
12 hours ± 90 minutes. Body weights were recorded daily in the AM and dosing volume was
adjusted accordingly. The survival and multi-day drug dosing analysis study was conducted in

 two parts. The first part was a survival study to investigate the effect of investigational drugs on
survival and motor function in SMA (2B/-) mice in a FVB/N genetic background. Three inves-
tigational drugs (PF-06687859 (RG3039), Vehicle and PF-06738066 were provided in coded
vials and administered to SMA and control mice from postnatal day 4–20 (P4-P20). A 4th
cohort, control mice (2B/+), received vehicle as a study control. Functional assessment began
at P10 and every other day thereafter using a 55˚ negative geotaxis/climb test. Mice were placed
facing the bottom of the incline and their ability to reorient themselves facing up the incline,
and their ability to climb to the top of the incline within 1 minute were assessed. Mice were
weaned at P21 and the study was terminated at P35 with euthanasia of any surviving animals.
Survival was monitored daily from P2-P4 (AM); P4-P20 twice daily at dosing times; P21-P35
at least once per day at time of weight (AM) or twice on those days (AM and PM) in which
incline plane testing occurred. At P4, litters were randomized across treatment arms to uni-
formly control litter size and litter weight as appropriate. Litter size entry was a minimum of 6
and maximum of 10. Litters with average weights at P4 that were greater or less than two stand
deviations below the average P4 litter weight of untreated litters were also excluded from study
entry. All mice within a litter were dosed with only one test article or received no dose at all.
Dosers/phenotypic testers were blinded to the test articles being administered. At P21, all mice
were weaned and followed for survival, weight and function until the study endpoint at P35. A
small group of untreated SMA mice (siblings to vehicle treated controls) were also followed in
this study to ensure the baseline survival of untreated SMA mice did not differ from prior
work [8]. All SMA mice weaned at P21 received 1 nesting pad and at least 1 control mouse in
their cage. Additionally, each SMA cage was also provided with water soaked food pellets that
were ground to a watery paste (porridge) and placed in the cage bottom. Cage bottoms were
changed 3X /week (M, W, F). Additional food porridge was provided as needed between cage
bottom changes. Mice meeting humane functional endpoints (30 percent loss of weight for
two consecutive days and/or an inability to right within 1 minute or obvious state of distress)
were immediately euthanized with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary mea-
sure. In total, 29 litters were born that corresponded to 205 mice (PF-06687859 [RG3039] used

female], PF-06738066 used 7 litters, 21 SMA mice [11male/10 female] and vehicle control 2B/
+ treatment cohort used 5 litters, 24 2B/+ control mice (12 male/12 female). The other litters
did not fulfill study entry criteria and were euthanized. There were 29 SMA mice across these
cohorts that did not reach the P35 study endpoint, presumably dying from disease manifesta-
tion, and of these, only 1 SMA mouse at time of cage observation met the humane functional
endpoint as described above. For the second part of the study, animals were dosed from
P4-P16 using the same dosing regimen as described above, but 12 hours following the last dose
were euthanized and tissues harvested for analysis of drug levels, DcpS activity, RNA and pro-
tein analysis as follows. No mice died prior to P16 harvest and a total of 96 mice were used for
this portion of the study from the 115 that were generated from breeding. Those not used for
analyses were also euthanized using CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation as a sec-
ondary measure.

 purified using the Fibrous Tissue RNAeasy mini kit. All RNA was quantified using the Nano-
Drop 8000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer and large RNA quality was confirmed using Bioanaly-
zer (Agilent). RNA analysis by ddPCR was performed as described above.
RNA-Seq analysis on spinal cord tissue from 2B/- and 2B/+ mice treated
with RG3039, PF-06738066 or vehicle
Six animals from each condition were selected at random for preparation of RNA from spinal
cord tissues. Total RNA was extracted with miRNeasy kits (217004, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and
1 μg of RNA was used for cDNA library preparation which was performed at Seqmatic (Fre-
mont, CA) using Illumina (San Diego, CA) Truseq mRNA v2 reagents (RS-122-2101, Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were run on a Nextseq 500 (Illumina) using a paired-end run
(2x75bp) generating ~60 million reads per library and demultiplexed using the Bcl2fastq algo-
rithm (Illumina, San Diego, CA). RNA-Seq alignment and differential analysis were performed
using open source tools implemented as an in-house pipeline as follows: The mouse genome
(mm10) and gene annotation were used for mapping and read counting. Reads were mapped
using STAR v2.4.0h [20] on the Pfizer high performance computing cluster and read counts
were performed utilizing featureCounts [21]. Genes with expression less than 1 CPM were
considered low expression and if a gene had no or low expression across all sample it was omit-
ted from further analysis. Differential analysis was performed using the R package edgeR 3.8.5
[19] and all genes with a Benjamini-Hochberg P-value less than 0.05 were reported as differen-
tially expressed.
Ingenuity pathway analysis
The differentially regulated gene lists for both the spinal cord mRNA-seq and the N2a mRNA-
seq results with a corrected P-value less than 0.05 were loaded into IPA and analyzed against
the Ingenuity Knowledgebase, Ingenuity Expert Information, and with experimentally
observed confidence.
Western blot analysis of mouse tissues
All tissues were resuspended in RIPA buffer supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease
inhibitor (Roche) and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Tissues were homogenized
using the TissueLyzer (QIAgen) at a frequency of 30 Hz for 30 seconds (liver and spinal cord)
and 1 minute (skeletal muscle). Protein gel electrophoresis and Western blot transfer were per-
formed as described above for cells using 10 μg of tissue lysates. Mouse monoclonal 8/SMN
(BD, 610647) and rabbit polyclonal anti-alpha tubulin (abcam, ab15246) were used for protein
detection and bands were imaged and quantified in a LI-COR Odyssey CLX system.
Statistical analysis
Except where specified otherwise, statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
software (version 6.0). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated from the data and ana-
lyzed using Mantel-Cox or Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests. The motor function task of com-
bined 55˚ negative geotaxis and climb test were analyzed using a Fisher’s Exact test.
Determination of statistical significance for normally distributed datasets was performed using
student’s unpaired T-test in GraphPad Prism; for non-normally distributed datasets, the
Mann-Whitney test was used when comparing two groups or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post hoc comparison if comparing against multiple groups.

Characterization of 7-methyl analogues of C5-substituted 2,4
diaminoquinazolines as probes of DcpS inhibition-dependent effects
To generate experimental tools to probe those effects of DAQ-DcpSi resulting from DcpS inhi-
bition, we designed and synthesized the 7-methyl analogues of several potent DcpS inhibitors
based on co-crystal structures of DcpS and DAQ-DcpSi [12]. As predicted, these were found
to be more than a thousand-fold less active as inhibitors of purified DcpS than the parent mol-
ecules (Fig 1). Therefore we utilized these 7-methyl analogues in further experiments as a
means of distinguishing the effects of compounds that were chemotype-driven from those due
to intrinsic DcpS inhibition with the objective to identify and validate DcpS-sensitive genes
(see below).
Selection of reference transcript for use in droplet digital PCR
As previously reported effects of DAQ-DcpS on SMN transcripts have been modest in magni-
tude and not necessarily statistically significant, we chose to use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)
as the most appropriate methodology to detect and quantitate any small changes occurring.
Initial data obtained from cells treated with DAQ-DcpSi were significantly noisy which we
speculated might be improved by employing more stringent RNA quality criteria. As the
ddPCR method is exquisitely sensitive, being capable of detecting a change of as little as 20%

 or less in a given transcript, it is therefore also likely to be highly sensitive to variations in salt
content of RNA samples, which is known to inhibit the reverse transcription step in cDNA
preparation. We found that by re-purifying RNA, there was a significant improvement in the
data quality and consistency. Proteasome 26S Subunit, Non-ATPase 14 (PSMD14) was chosen
as the reference gene for comparing the expression level of all transcripts reported herein
because unlike a number of other commonly used housekeeping genes that were considered, it
was clearly unaffected in cells exposed to DAQ-DcpSi treatment in any experiment. With
these technical improvements, we were able to obtain extremely consistent data with very low
inter-replicate variation.
Validation of DAQ-DcpSi-sensitive transcripts: DPM3 and PAQR8 are
DcpS-sensitive genes
A number of gene transcripts have been observed to change in response to DAQ-DcpSi [22].
Thus we sought to determine whether some of these were responsive to DcpS inhibition per se
or some other effect(s) of these compounds unrelated to DcpS. Knockdown experiments were
performed by infecting HEK-293T cells with DcpS shRNA lentiviral vectors and isolating
puromycin-resistant clones for analysis (Fig 2). Successful knockdown of DcpS mRNA and
protein was confirmed by ddPCR and Western blot and was almost complete in clones 24 and
71 but only partial in clone 70 (Fig 2A). No changes in SMN transcripts were observed in any
clone (Fig 2B). Testing the DcpS-sensitive transcripts reported by Zhou et al. (2015) [22], the
pattern of changes in Dolichyl-Phosphate Mannosyltransferase Subunit 3(DPM3) and Proges-
tin and AdipoQ Receptor Family Member 8 (PAQR8) was consistent with their being DcpS-
sensitive genes, both qualitatively (same direction of change as induced by pharmacological
DcpS inhibition) and quantitatively (because the degree of modulation was related to the
degree of DcpS knockdown). The lack of effect in clone 70 suggests that greater than 50% loss
of DcpS activity is required to cause a change in either DPM3 or PAQR8. The data did not vali-
date Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class W (PIGW) or Protein Phospha-
tase 4 Regulatory Subunit 2 (PPP4R2) as being DcpS-sensitive genes (Fig 2C and 2D). In
addition to these knockdown data, 7-methyl substitution ablated the ability of DAQ com-
pounds to change the expression of PAQR8 and DPM3 in SMA-derived lymphoblasts, also
consistent with these being DcpS-sensitive genes (Fig 3). It was noted that these genes exhib-
ited different temporal responses to DAQ-DcpSi treatment: PAQR8 was consistently down-
regulated after 4 hours whereas the DPM3 response required significantly longer treatment
time with DAQ-DcpSi.
Effect of DcpS inhibition on SMN2 and SMNΔ7 transcripts
We utilized ddPCR to study the effect of RG3039 on SMN transcripts in a variety of different
cell types—human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), HEK283T, HelaS3, SMA lym-
phoblasts, SMA iPS-derived neural progenitor cells, and motor neurons. Typically (Fig 4),
HEK293T cells responded with a small (~20%) increase in SMN2 transcript after 4h of treat-
ment with RG3039 which was much reduced or absent at later time points (Fig 4B and 4C):
similar changes in SMN2 were observed in HelaS3 and SMA lymphoblasts but no SMN2
response was seen in any experiment conducted in PBMC or motor neurons. A small but sus-
tained decrease in SMNΔ7 transcripts was observed in all cells except PBMC. There were no
changes in SMN1 mRNA in response to treatment in any experiment in any cell type. We then
went on to compare the effects of active DAQ-DcpSi (RG3039 and PF-06738066) with their
7-methyl inactive analogues (PF-06802336 and PF-06832344, respectively) and determined
that the modest changes in SMN transcripts only occurred in response to active DAQ-DcpSi,

 but not 7-methyl analogues, consistent with these effects being a consequence of DcpS inhibi-
tion (Fig 5). In the particular example experiment illustrated in Fig 5 using SMA lymphoblasts,
there was no decrease in SMNΔ7 transcripts in response to RG3039, suggesting that this could
be a cell-type specific response. However, in other experiments also performed in SMA lym-
phoblasts, as well as those done in SMA fibroblasts, a decrease in SMNΔ7 transcripts was seen,
so the lack of response is the result of experiment-to-experiment variation rather than a differ-
ence from one cell-type to another. No increase in SMNΔ7 transcripts in response to
DAQ-DcpSi was ever observed in any cell type in vitro.
Effect of DAQ-DcpSi on SMN protein in SMA cells
The effect of RG3039 on SMN protein was tested on a number of different SMA cell types
under varying conditions (Fig 6). To validate our ability to detect the increase in SMN protein

 we included the compound SMN-C2, a SMN2 splice-corrector [23], as a control and were able
to clearly and reproducibly observe a positive SMN response to this compound in SMA fibro-
blasts, SMA lymphoblasts, and SMA iPS-derived neural progenitor cells (Fig 6). However, in
no experimental condition tested were we able to detect an increase in SMN protein induced
by RG3039 or any other DAQ-DcpSi after periods of incubation ranging from 24 hours to 7
days.
DAQ-DcpSi effects in reporter gene assays are not specific to the SMN2
promoter
A number of DAQ-DcpSi and their inactive 7-methyl analogues were profiled in a reporter
assay described previously in which firefly luciferase is driven by the SMN2 promoter and reg-
ulated by an SMN2 splicing cassette [14]. This construct is present in an Epstein Barr virus vec-
tor maintained episomally in a stable cell line. This assay system is sensitive to SMN2
transcriptional activators, splice correctors and compounds that stabilize either SMN-

 luciferase fusion transcripts or protein. Renilla luciferase driven by the CMV promoter in the
same construct is employed as a useful comparator. As expected, the positive controls LDN-
75654 [15] and SMN-C2 [23] had a strong positive effect on SMN2-driven firefly luciferase
activity and had either a much weaker (LDN-75654) or no effect (SMN-C2) on CMV-driven
Renilla luciferase activity (Fig 7). All 3 DAQ-DcpSi tested (RG3039, PF-06738066, and
D156844 [9]) had a strong effect on Renilla luciferase activity. In contrast, the effect of the
DAQ-DcpSi compounds on SMN2-firefly luciferase was of a smaller magnitude than their
effect on Renilla luciferase (maximal activation ~20–50% compared to ~150–300% effect) but
did appear concentration-dependent. In addition there was no effect of the inactive 7-methyl
DAQ analog, PF-06802336 on the expression of either SMN2-firefly luciferase or CMV renilla,
suggesting that the effect is a consequence of DcpS inhibition. These data are consistent with
previous findings in a similar assay system in which early members of the DAQ series were
found to have activity in a number of reporter gene assays in addition to (and in some cases
greater than) that driven by the SMN2 promoter [6]. They suggest that the primary effect of
the DAQ-DcpSi are either non-specific promoter activation, or that these apparent promoter
effects are either downstream of (or epiphenomena resulting from) some other primary

 pharmacological effect. These possibilities are consistent with the observation that members of
this chemical series also caused activation of thymidine kinase promoter-driven β-lactamase
activity [6]. It should also be noted that transcriptional activation of the SMN2 gene would be
predicted to increase SMNΔ7 transcript levels; however, as described above, the small

 elevations in SMN2 transcript that were observed in cells in vitro are accompanied by either
decreased SMNΔ7 or no change (see Figs 4 and 5).
RNA Seq analysis of DAQ-DcpSi effects in N2a neuroblastoma cell
In order to more broadly characterize the effects of DcpS inhibition on the transcriptome, N2a
mouse neuroblastoma cells were treated for 24 hours with either 1 μM RG3039, 1 μM PF-
06802336 or an equivalent concentration (1 μM) of DMSO vehicle. RNA-Seq analysis on a
polyA RNA library prepared from these cells revealed 2,104 genes differentially expressed in
RG3039-treated cells compared to DMSO-treated controls out of 18,409 detectable genes
(P < 0.05). Of these, 1,225 genes (58.3%) were upregulated and 878 (41.7%) were down-
regulated (Fig 8). It was noted that neither Smn nor DcpS itself were differentially expressed in

 response to RG3039 treatment by these significance criteria. In contrast, only 7 detectable
genes were differentially regulated in PF-06802336-treated cells in comparison to DMSO con-
trols. Four of these 7 genes were also differentially regulated by RG3039, and all 4 changed in
the same direction with both compounds (all upregulated) indicating regulation by the chemo-
type independent of DcpS inhibition for this small set of genes (RNA Component of Mito-
chondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease (Rmrp); predicted gene 15564 (Gm15564); 7SK
Small Nuclear RNA (Rn7sk); and mmu-miR-6236). After removal of these 4, a complete list of
the genes differentially regulated by RG3039 in Neuro2a cells is provided in S4 Table. 1,489
(70.9%) of these genes changed by less than one Log2 units (2-fold) in either direction, and
only 80 genes (3.8%) changed by more than 2 log2 units (4-fold) in either direction. Thus a
substantial proportion (>11%) of the detectable genes in these cells are affected by RG3039
but the vast majority change only modestly. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated that
the affected genes were distributed broadly, with no pathway(s) standing out as being a selec-
tive target for the action of the compound in providing therapeutic benefit in SMA. 53

 pathways were significantly affected (P < 0.05) (S1 Fig). Of these, the great majority had
approximately equal representation of genes that were up-regulated and those that were
down-regulated, making it unclear what the likely overall effect on the pathway was likely to
be. The only exceptions to this general pattern were pathways that had very few genes anno-
tated (S1 Fig) which is likely a statistical anomaly. When viewed in terms of disease and bio-
function annotations, differentially affected genes were also broadly distributed, also with
approximately even distribution of directionality of change (S2 Fig). Thus no obvious hypothe-
ses for therapeutic mechanism emerged from this RNA-Seq analysis. Consistent with our
ddPCR findings in human cells reported above, in these mouse neuroblastoma cells treated
with DAQ-DcpSi, Paqr8 was decreased (log2 fold change 0.657, P = 0.00251), Dpm3 was
increased (log2 fold change 0.884, P = 0.000012), as was Pigw (log2 fold change 1.54, P = 1.89 x
10−30; S4 Table). Due to the implication of miRNA dysregulation in SMA and a role for DcpS
in miRNA stability, we hypothesized that DAQ-DcpSi may regulate gene expression via
changes in miRNA levels. However, RNA-Seq analysis on miRNA isolated from treated and
untreated N2a cells found no miR species (out of approximately 700 detectable) that were dif-
ferentially regulated by RG3039 but not its inactive 7-methyl analog PF-06802336. These data
suggest either that DAQ-DcpSi do not regulate miRNA levels, or that any changes are too sub-
tle to be detected using RNA-Seq methodology. The latter interpretation appears most likely
based on a demonstrable effect of DAQ-DcpSi reported recently [24].
DAQ-DcpSi therapeutic benefit in SMA mice is not the result of
lysosomotropism and is accompanied by significant and substantial
increases in Smn transcripts but no change in Smn protein
The 2 DAQ-DCpSi compounds that have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in SMA
mice in vivo (RG3039 and D156844) are both highly lipophilic and dibasic [7–9]. Compounds
with these physicochemical properties accumulate in tissues as the result of partitioning into
membranes and sequestration within the lysosomal compartment due to the formation of pro-
tonated membrane-impermeable species at low pH [25]. As so-called lysosomotropes have
been found to be neuroprotective [26], we wanted to determine if the DAQ-DcpS inhibitors
could show therapeutic benefit for SMA mice without accumulating to the lysosome. PF-
06738066, an analog of RG3039 that we have previously shown to be a potent DAQ-DcpSi but
non-lysosomotrope [12], was tested in the 2B/- SMA mouse model. Preliminary pharmacoki-
netic (PK) profiling of PF-06738066 [30 mg/kg i.p.] (S3 Fig) was performed in adult FVB/N
(wild type, Smn+/+) mice and showed moderate brain penetration—free drug levels in brain
and CSF were approximately 2.5-fold lower than in plasma. This profiling was extended to
2B/- SMA mice and 2B/+ littermate controls at P13 using a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. (S4 Fig). It
was determined that drug exposures were somewhat higher in SMA pups compared to their
healthy littermates (S4B Fig), and that pups have higher CNS drug exposures as a function of
dose compared to adult mice. Free drug levels in 2B/- SMA pup brains were 3–4 fold lower
than in plasma. These PK data indicated that 12 hr following a 10 mg/kg dose free drug levels
in brain were approximately 7 nM which we expect to result in significant DcpS inhibition if
given b.i.d. (S4 Fig). These CNS distribution characteristics of PF-06738066 are in marked
contrast to those of RG3039 that (as expected from its physicochemical characteristics) signifi-
cantly accumulates in all tissues compared to plasma [7]. We then studied the effects of dosing
PF-06738066 (10mg/kg b.i.d. i.p.) or RG3039 (6 mg/kg b.i.d. i.p.) to 2B/- SMA mice on sur-
vival, motor function, and Smn transcripts in muscle and spinal cord. The study was powered
to detect a survival benefit and the dosing regimens were selected to maximize the likelihood
of achieving a maximal degree of DcpS inhibition in CNS tissues over the dosing cycle. Both

 PF-06738066 and RG3039 had a statistically significant beneficial effect on survival of SMA
mice compared to vehicle-treated SMA mice (P < 0.0001 by either Mantel-Cox or Gehan-Bre-

(P < 0.05 by either test) (Fig 9). Males tended to survive longer than females in all groups but

Mantel-Cox or Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests). RG3039 had a slightly greater effect on survival than PF-
06738066 (P < 0.05 by either test).

 reported for RG3039, animals treated with either DAQ-DcpSi compound had a decline in
weight around the time of weaning and then gained weight thereafter but were nevertheless
always significantly lower in their body weight than healthy 2B/+ control animals (Fig 9).
To assess motor function and endurance, mice were monitored every other day from
P10-P34 for their ability to simultaneously pass a 55˚ negative geotaxis and climb test (Fig 10).
By P16, 100% of the vehicle-treated control 2B/+ mice were able to simultaneously pass the
combined assay, while at the same age, less than 40% of SMA mice (combined sexes) treated
with vehicle that were still alive were able to pass. In contrast, those SMA mice that received
either PF-06738066 or RG3039 had a simultaneous pass rate of about 78%- almost a 40%
improvement in their ability to pass the combined assay, but this did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (Fisher’s exact test, P-value = 0.0708). This assay amongst the SMA groups had a
43% power to detect a significant change because of the small n-value available at P16 and the
mixed responses among the SMA groups (compared to >99% power between control and
SMA because of the 100% pass rate in control mice). Post-dosing SMA drug-treated mice
demonstrated a gradual decline in strength and endurance. It is unknown whether this loss
would have occurred if drug dosing had been maintained beyond P20. In the second part of
this study, plasma drug levels were measured 12 hours following the last dose (Tmin) on P16
and after conversion for plasma protein binding these equated to plasma free drug concentra-
tions of 4.24 ± 1.13 nM RG3039 (n = 13) and 184 ± 76 nM PF-06738066 (n = 18) respectively
with no obvious sex differences apparent on subgroup analysis, confirming that the achieved
drug levels equaled or exceeded the targeted range for each drug based on the preliminary PK
analysis in both adult wild type and younger SMA pups.
Smn transcript and protein analysis on tissues from DAQ-DcpSi-treated
mice by ddPCR
As expected, 2B/- SMA mice had lower levels of exon 5/6 and exon 7/8 containing Smn tran-
scripts in all tissues compared to 2B/+ controls (Fig 11). Levels of SmnΔ7 transcripts (defined
by contiguous exons 6 and 8) were identical between the 2B/- SMA mice and their healthy 2B/
+ littermates, presumably because each bears a single copy of the 2B allele that is the source of
Fig 10. Effect of DAQ-DcpSi on the performance of 2B/- SMA mice in a combined 55˚ negative geotaxis/ climb test. Data presented
represent combined sexes for RG3039 (n = 20); vehicle (n = 21), PF-06738066 (n = 21) and vehicle treated healthy 2B/+ littermates (n = 24).
The percent of mice able to pass the 55˚ negative geotaxis and climb tests simultaneously is shown. At P16, while a predominant number of
vehicle treated SMA were alive, PF-06738066 or RG3039 showed improvement over vehicle SMA mice that did not reach statistical
significance (Fisher’s exact test, P-value = 0.0708; 43% power to detect a benefit amongst SMA groups).

 this transcript. 2B/+ mice were used for these analyses as they produce ~65% Smn protein, are
phenotypically normal and were littermate controls to the SMA mice analyzed from the breed-
ing scheme that was utilized. In contrast to the modest effects observed in cells treated in vitro,
both RG3039 and PF-06738066 caused significant increases in Smn transcripts in all tissues of
2B/- SMA mice with the exception that SmnΔ7 trended to increase in spinal cord of
RG3039-treated 2B/- mice but this apparent effect did not achieve statistical significance.
These increases were observed in exons 5/6-containing Smn, exons 7/8-containing Smn, and
SmnΔ7 transcripts. It is notable that in spinal cord and muscle, exon 7-containing transcripts
were fully normalized to the levels observed in healthy 2B/+ mice but the increase in liver
achieved only partial normalization. While 2B/+ control mice similarly responded to
DAQ-DcpSi with an increase in exons 5/6-containing Smn and SmnΔ7, there was no increase
in exons 7/8-containing Smn transcripts. In spinal cord PF-06738066 treatment actually
caused a significant decrease in these Smn exons 7/8 and a similar trend was apparent in skele-
tal muscle but did not achieve statistical significance. These data suggest that the Smn response
to DAQ-DcpSi treatment in vivo is more complex than a simple increase in expression as
might be expected by increased promoter activity. In addition RG3039 caused no statistically
significant change in Smn protein levels in spinal cord or muscle tissues from 2B/- SMA
whereas PF-06738066 caused a significant decrease in spinal cord (P< 0.0001) and a small but
significant increase in muscle (P< 0.05) from these mice (Fig 12, and S5 Fig for representative
blots). Thus the observed changes in Smn transcripts were not associated with elevation of
Smn protein and the mechanism(s) of therapeutic benefit of these compounds remain cryptic
but not due simply to overall increases in Smn protein.
RNA-Seq analysis of gene expression changes induced by RG3039 in
SMA mice
Following the observations described above, we went on to more completely characterize the
pattern of changes across the transcriptome by performing RNA-Seq analysis on polyA RNA
libraries from spinal cord tissues from the in vivo experiment described above. Spinal cord tis-
sue from 2B/- SMA and 2B/+ control mice treated with vehicle or RG3039 (6 mice per condi-
tion) was used for RNA-Seq analysis. Comparison of vehicle-treated animals (2B/- SMA vs 2B/
+ control) was used to identify those genes whose expression was altered in diseased vs healthy
animals. Two of the 6 samples from vehicle-treated 2B/+ mice had markedly higher expression
of skeletal muscle specific genes which we interpreted as likely contamination of these spinal
cord tissues with skeletal muscle during the dissection process and therefore these individual
animals were excluded from the analysis. We found 2,558 genes were differentially expressed
in spinal cord from 2B/- SMA mice compared to healthy 2B/+ littermates with a slight prepon-
derance of genes that were lower in 2B/- SMA vs 2B/+ (7.12% vs 5.35% upregulated) (Fig 13A
and 13E and S5 Table for underlying data). Transcripts previously identified as being dysregu-
lated in SMA tissues in general as well as in 2B/- SMA mice were also confirmed in this data
set [eg. Cdkn1a (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (P21), Pmaip1, (phorbol-12-myristate-
13-acetate-induced protein 1) and Fas (TNF receptor superfamily member 6)] [27]. The top 20
up and down differentially expressed transcripts are given in the S6 Table. As expected, vehi-
cle-treated 2B/- mice had 2.33-fold lower Smn transcript levels compared to vehicle-treated
2B/+ mice (Log2 fold change = -1.224, P = 1.72 x 10−16). Strikingly, dosing of 2B/- SMA mice
with RG3039 resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) altered expression of 5,497 genes compared to
vehicle-treated 2B/- mice SMA mice (approximately 26.8% of the measurable genes), which
was a significantly greater proportion than the 11.4% of measurable genes found to be modu-
lated in the N2a cell RNA-Seq analysis (Fig 13B & 13E. and S7 Table for underlying data). The

 top 20 up and down differentially expressed transcripts are found in the S8 Table. RG3039
treatment did not appear to increase Smn transcripts as detected by RNA-Seq, possibly reflect-
ing the lower sensitivity of RNA-Seq compared to ddPCR in ability to detect changes in low-
abundance transcripts.
In marked contrast to the data in 2B/- SMA animals, less than 0.5% of detectable genes
were modulated by RG3039 in 2B/+ control mice (Fig 13C and 13E and S9 Table for underly-
ing data). Based on these findings we hypothesized that the therapeutic benefit of RG3039
could be either due to, or at least reflected by, the modulation of a subset of genes that were
affected in one direction by disease and in the opposite direction by RG3039 treatment of
SMA mice, returning the tissue to a more “healthy” gene expression profile. To investigate this
hypothesis we compared differential expression between RG3039-treated 2B/- mice and vehi-
cle-treated 2B/+ controls (Fig 13D). Contrary to our hypothesis, which would have predicted
fewer differential genes, we found a much greater number of genes were different in this com-
parison than between vehicle treated 2B/- and vehicle-treated 2B/+ (compare Fig 13A and
13D), indicating that compound treatment actually made 2B/- tissue less “similar” to healthy
tissue than the untreated 2B/- tissue (see S10 Table for underlying data). 591 genes were
affected in opposite directions by disease and by compound treatment (see S11 Table for list of
genes). Pathway analysis performed in IPA software indicated a significant number of pluripo-
tency and cancer-related genes in this list. As a final hypothesis we also looked at the expres-
sion of transcripts such as ZPR1 whose overexpression has been shown to increase the number
of SMN containing gems in SMA patient cells [28]. The idea being that Smn levels may not
change, but subcellular distribution of Smn may, which we previously reported within SMA
motor neurons of 2B/- SMA mice treated with RG3039 [8]. We found no difference in ZPR1
expression in whole spinal cord by RNA-seq in SMA vs. Control 2B+ vehicle treated mice or
amongst vehicle and RG3039 treated SMA mice (S5–S8 Tables).
Discussion
Based on the mode of discovery of the DAQ-DcpSi in a screen utilizing an SMN2 promoter-
driven reporter assay and reported effects on SMN2 transcripts, SMN protein levels and
nuclear gem counts, this class of compound have been assumed to exert their therapeutic
effects in SMA mice via elevation of SMN consequent to SMN2 promoter induction. However,
close examination of the published evidence indicates that the data underpinning this claim is
equivocal at best. Firstly, the original hits in the quinazoline series were also active in a mini-
mal thymidine kinase promoter-driven reporter assay, and were actually more potent in this
context than they were in the SMN2 promoter assay [6]. The reporter gene assay data reported
in the current work replicates this finding in yet another unrelated (CMV) promoter-driven
reporter assay and indicates that DAQ-DcpS are either not simple transcriptional activators of
the SMN2 gene, or if so, they are extremely non-selective transcriptional activators of a number
of promoters or act via stabilization of transcripts. Secondly, although we have confirmed the
observation of others that DAQ-DcpSi increases the ratio of full length SMN2 transcript to
SMNΔ7 transcript in cells in vitro, we show that the changes in either individual transcript are
extremely modest and in the case of full length SMN2, are generally not sustained beyond 4
hours. It should be noted that expression of these changes in terms of the ratio between full
length SMN2 and SMNΔ7 transcripts as used by some authors is likely to exaggerate the mag-
nitude of the potential beneficial effect, the significance of which is questionable especially
given the observation that introduction of a SMNΔ7 transgene actually improves the pheno-
type of SMA mice [29]. The modest effects of DAQ-DcpSi on full length SMN2 transcripts that
we have demonstrated in vitro are possible to detect using the exquisitely sensitive ddPCR

 methodology that we have used, but are unlikely to be reliably measured using more tradi-
tional qPCR techniques, possibly accounting for the inconsistency of the literature in this
regard. ddPCR is an extremely powerful single molecule counting technique, is capable of
quantitating minute quantities of low abundance transcripts, and is essentially linear in
response (as opposed to the logarithmic responsiveness of traditional qPCR). This makes
ddPCR uniquely suitable for detecting small compound effects on transcript levels. Another
crucial aspect of the methodology is the choice of reference gene with which to normalize
expression data. As illustrated by our RNA-Seq data, many genes are affected by DAQ-DcpSi
treatment, including some commonly used as “housekeeping” reference genes. In addition, it
is clear that ddPCR is more sensitive than RNA-Seq for detecting changes in low-abundance
transcripts. Therefore it is vital that carefully controlled preliminary experiments are per-
formed to select an appropriate reference gene to avoid exaggerating, underestimating, or even
negating the effects of compounds such as DAQ-DcpSi treatment which clearly have very
broad effects across the transcriptome. Using this approach we selected PSMD14 as an appro-
priate reference gene because it was reliably unaffected by DAQ-DcpSi treatment in vitro.
Using these methodological approaches we are confident that the small changes that we
observed in SMN transcripts are genuine, but seem very unlikely to be significant to the thera-
peutic mechanism of action of DAQ-DcpSi. The small effects of DAQ-DcpSi on SMN tran-
scripts we describe in our in vitro experiments are in marked contrast to the robust changes
caused by small molecule SMN2 splice correctors reported by others [23], which reduce the
SMNΔ7 transcript to undetectable levels and double full length SMN2 levels. Increases in SMN
protein in SMA fibroblasts in vitro in response to DAQ-DcpSi have been claimed by others
but not quantitated. The contrast with the data we report in this paper could arguably be
related to a different incubation period employed by other investigators (5 days) compared to
our own studies. However this seems unlikely as we employed incubation periods both shorter
and longer than this (up to 6 days) in our studies.
Lipophilic and basic DAQ-DcpSi accumulate within the lysosomal compartment due to the
combination of being able to freely enter this organelle by virtue of high membrane permeabil-
ity but then becoming positively charged by protonation at low pH, reducing membrane per-
meability and causing entrapment. This property (known as lysosomotropism) is likely
responsible at least in part for the high degree of tissue accumulation of these compounds in
tissues [8]. As lysosomotropes have previously been reported to be neuroprotective we sought
to develop DAQ-DcpSi that had reduced lysosomotropism to test whether they retained their
ability to improve disease phenotype in SMA mice [12]. In the current study our characteriza-
tion of these mice was limited to survival and performance in a motor function task, but previ-
ous studies [7, 8] have shown improvement in electrophysiological parameters and
neuromuscular junction architecture by RG3039, which are highly relevant to the pathology of
SMA in humans. Therefore measurements of survival and motor function in these mice are an
appropriate surrogate endpoint for neuromuscular function in this mouse model. The finding
that a non-lysosomotropic DAQ-DcpSi has a beneficial effect similar to RG3039 excludes lyso-
somotropism as a potential therapeutic mechanism.
A striking finding in the present study was that despite our inability to demonstrate robust
changes in SMN transcripts in cultured cells in vitro, DAQ-DcpSi treatment of SMA mice
caused marked upregulation of exon 7-containing transcripts in spinal cord and skeletal mus-
cle tissues, and to a lesser extent in liver. In these tissues, exon 5 & 6 containing and SmnΔ7
transcripts (in contrast to our in vitro findings) also generally increased. At present it is not
possible to distinguish whether the difference between our in vitro and in vivo findings is the
result of a difference in the length of exposure to the drug (24 hours in vitro vs. 12 days in

 vivo), cell type differences, or non-cell autonomous effects in vivo which are not mimicked in
vitro.
In previous studies performed in SMA mouse models treated with therapeutically beneficial
doses of DAQ-DcpSi, SMN full length transcripts have been reported to either increase mod-
estly [7], or not to change [8, 9]. In contrast to this, and to our findings in vitro, we found rela-
tively robust in vivo increases in Smn transcripts containing contiguous exons 7 and 8, as well
as significant increases in those containing contiguous exons 5 and 6, and Δ7 transcripts (con-
tiguous exons 6 and 8).
No statistically significant increases in SMN protein have been reported in SMA mouse
models treated with DAQ-DcpSi under conditions where the compounds have been demon-
strated to have a survival and functional benefit [7–9]. Overall our own data are consistent
with DAQ-DcpSi causing no change in tissue levels of SMN protein. However it should be
noted that nuclear gems do appear to increase both in SMA cells in vitro and in tissues from
SMA mice dosed in vivo [8]. Indeed the intriguing suggestion has been made that this results
from redistribution of SMN into the nucleus caused by DAQ-DcpSi, suggesting that although
an elevation in total cellular SMN protein levels is widely assumed to result in an increase in
nuclear gem counts it does not necessarily follow that an increase in nuclear gem counts must
therefore reflect an increase in cellular SMN.
Recent literature reports have described a new role for DcpS that is suggestive of the mecha-
nism of action of DAQ-DcpSi in SMA. In both yeast [30] and C.elegans [31], the orthologs of
DcpS promote the exonucleolytic activity of Xrn1 and could therefore influence the stability of
mRNA both directly and indirectly via altered miRNA levels. Some catalytically-inactive DcpS
mutants can also promote Xrn1 activity, indicating that this effect is independent of enzyme
activity of DcpS [31]. These observations have now been extended to human cells showing that
DcpS regulates miRNA stability and that although this is a non-catalytic activity function of
DcpS it is inhibited by DAQ-DcpSi, possibly due to allosteric modulation of the interaction
with XRN2 [24].
We note that others [32] have reported that PAQR8 is modulated by RG3039 in a DcpS-
independent manner based on the lack of effect of DcpS knockdown on the levels of this tran-
script. This is in marked contrast to our findings in which down-regulation of PAQR8 was
both proportional to the degree of DcpS knockdown, and the ability of RG3039 to reduce
PAQR8 transcripts was lost by 7-methyl substitution. It is possible that transcripts may exhibit
differential sensitivities to DcpS knockdown, and that the degree of knockdown achieved by
other investigators was insufficient to affect PAQR8 transcripts. Consistent with this, compari-
son of the Western blot data presented by these authors [32] and our own suggests that our
clones 24 and 71 had a greater degree of knockdown than the DcpSKD cells.
Overall, the effects of DAQ-DcpSi such as RG3039 on the cellular transcript profile are
widespread and highly complex. To date, it is not clear why a given transcript is regulated by
DAQ-DcpSi and of those transcripts that change there may be multiple mechanisms underly-
ing their response, as RG3039 influences the stability of some transcripts that change but not
others [32]. To some extent, the multitude of changes observed in DAQ-DcpSi-treated cells
and tissues may reflect the choice of relatively long incubation/treatment times, and more
detailed characterization of changes at early time points may help discriminate between pri-
mary effects and downstream sequelae.
DcpS was first identified as the putative target for DAQ compounds using a protein array of
approximately 5,000 proteins [10]. We have also validated DcpS as the putative target of DAQ
compounds in live cells using chemical probe and thermal stabilization assays [33]. Extending
the work of Singh et al. to 9,000 proteins [34] has so far confirmed DcpS as the only identifiable
binding partner of this class of compound to-date. Therefore, the diverse effects of

 DAQ-DcpSi may well reflect the breadth of effects of raising free m7G cap-containing species
in cells, stabilizing miRNA and potentially other roles of DcpS that may not be fully under-
stood currently.
Conclusions
The effects of DAQ-DcpSi are subtle and complex and not consistent with direct activation of
the SMN2 promoter as expected from their mode of discovery. The compounds invoke a
broad array of gene expression changes, with lack of bias in direction, and distribution across
many pathways and functions. The data clearly support DcpS inhibition as the mode of action
of the compounds, but the link between DcpS inhibition and improvement of disease pheno-
type in SMA mice is as yet unclear.
