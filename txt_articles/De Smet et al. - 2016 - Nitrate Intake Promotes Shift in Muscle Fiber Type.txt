Purpose:
We investigated the effect of sprint interval training (SIT) in normoxia, vs.
SIT in hypoxia alone or in conjunction with oral nitrate intake, on buffering capacity of
homogenized muscle (βhm) and fiber type distribution, as well as on sprint and endurance
performance.
Methods: Twenty-seven moderately-trained participants were allocated to one of three
experimental groups: SIT in normoxia (20.9% FiO2) + placebo (N), SIT in hypoxia
(15% F
+
iO2)
placebo (H), or SIT in hypoxia + nitrate supplementation (HN). All
participated in 5 weeks of SIT on a cycle ergometer (30-s sprints interspersed by 4.5
min recovery-intervals, 3 weekly sessions, 4–6 sprints per session). Nitrate (6.45 mmol
NaNO3) or placebo capsules were administered 3 h before each session. Before and
after SIT participants performed an incremental VO2max-test, a 30-min simulated cycling
time-trial, as well as a 30-s cycling sprint test. Muscle biopsies were taken from m. vastus
lateralis.
Results: SIT decreased the proportion of type IIx muscle fibers in all groups (P < 0.05).
The relative number of type IIa fibers increased (P < 0.05) in HN (P < 0.05 vs. H), but
not in the other groups. SIT had no significant effect on βhm. Compared with H, SIT
tended to enhance 30-s sprint performance more in HN than in H (P = 0.085). VO2max
and 30-min time-trial performance increased in all groups to a similar extent.
Conclusion:
SIT in hypoxia combined with nitrate supplementation increases the
proportion of type IIa fibers in muscle, which may be associated with enhanced
performance in short maximal exercise. Compared with normoxic training, hypoxic SIT
does not alter βhm or endurance and sprinting exercise performance.

Nitrate Supplementation during Hypoxic SIT
INTRODUCTION
Interest in intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) to boost
endurance and high-intensity exercise performance in athletes
is growing (Hoppeler et al., 2008; McLean et al., 2014). This
might partly be explained by the commercialization of user-
friendly, normobaric hypoxicators to simulate altitude within the
normal lowland habitat. Well-controlled studies have provided
evidence that high-intensity hypoxic endurance training can
enhance muscle mitochondrial and capillary density (Geiser
et al., 2001; Vogt et al., 2001; Schmutz et al., 2010; Desplanches
et al., 2014), as well as stimulate other markers of mitochondrial
metabolism and biogenesis (Terrados et al., 1990; Melissa et al.,
1997; Green et al., 1999; Zoll et al., 2006). IHT in the form of
both endurance training (Vogt et al., 2001; Zoll et al., 2006) and
sprint training (Faiss et al., 2013b; Puype et al., 2013) elevated
muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK) mRNA and/or activity, as
well as other markers of glycolytic metabolism and pH regulation.
Nonetheless, research into the effects of IHT on sea-level exercise
performance is equivocal, with the current literature suggesting
higher training intensities involving anaerobic energy input to be
more favorable than predominantly aerobic workouts (Hoppeler
et al., 2008; Faiss et al., 2013a; McLean et al., 2014). This
might be explained by impaired workload in endurance training
due to inhibition of oxidative energy provision, resulting in
higher glycolytic energy contribution and premature fatigue
development (Weyand and Lee, 1999; Calbet et al., 2003; Wehrlin
and Hallén, 2006).
Attention has recently shifted toward IHT in the form of
sprint training (Faiss et al., 2013b, 2015; Galvin et al., 2013;
Puype et al., 2013), because maximal power (Calbet et al.,
2003) and anaerobic capacity (Friedmann et al., 2007) are
well-maintained in hypoxia. This may allow for more explicit
systemic and muscular adaptations due to elevated hypoxic and
oxidative stress in conjunction with pertinent neuromuscular and
neuromechanical loading (Morales-Alamo et al., 2012; McGinnis
et al., 2014). Support for such a contention comes from recent
studies showing that repeated sprint training in hypoxia (RSH),
characterized by several short (<30 s) sprints interspersed
with incomplete recovery (exercise-to-rest ratio <1:4), increased
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) mRNA (Faiss et al.,
2013b), and repeated-sprint ability (RSA) performance (Faiss
et al., 2013b, 2015; Galvin et al., 2013) more than identical
repeated sprint training in normoxia. However, the beneficial
effect of RSH on exercise performance (Faiss et al., 2015) has been
debated (Montero and Lundby, 2015), and needs to be confirmed.
HIF-1α is implicated in the regulation of the genes controlling the
expression of proteins involved in glycolysis and pH regulation
(Porporato et al., 2011). In line with this, RSH has been shown
to increase gene transcription of monocarboxylate transporter
4 (MCT-4) and carbonic anhydrase III (CA3) in muscle (Faiss
et al., 2013b). We have shown that 6 weeks of sprint interval
training (SIT), characterized by 30-s sprints interspersed with
long recovery periods of 4–5 min, increases muscle MCT-1, but
not MCT-4 protein content, irrespective of whether the training
was performed in normoxia or in hypoxia (Puype et al., 2013).
SIT in hypoxia but not in normoxia also elevated PFK activity
(Puype et al., 2013), presumably due to increased glycolytic ATP
turnover to compensate for impaired aerobic energy production
during the hypoxic training workouts (Weyand and Lee, 1999;
Calbet et al., 2003). Given that post-exercise phosphocreatine
(PCr) resynthesis is impaired under hypoxic conditions (Haseler
et al., 1999; Holliss et al., 2013; Vanhatalo et al., 2014), long
recovery time between sprints is required to allow substantial
recovery of PCr prior to each sprint (Bogdanis et al., 1996; Parolin
et al., 1999) and may assist maintenance of high power output
throughout the training session.
As the contribution of glycolysis to energy provision increases,
buffering capacity becomes a pivotal determinant of the capacity
to maintain high muscle power outputs. Counter-intuitively, the
extent of H+ accumulation in muscle fibers during training
does not seem to be the primary stimulus for the development
of higher buffering capacity of homogenized muscle (βhm).
Indeed, rat (Thomas et al., 2007) and human (Edge et al.,
2006a) studies have shown that bicarbonate-induced myocellular
alkalosis during work-matched interval training did not inhibit
adaptations in βhm. Furthermore, a large acidic load (pH <
6.8) during training has been reported to reduce βhm, possibly
due to cumulative transient decreases in βhm during consecutive
training sessions (Bishop et al., 2008). In line with this rationale,
performing SIT in hypoxic conditions might even impair βhm
compared with similar training in normoxia. Alternatively,
however, both “live high–train high” (Mizuno et al., 1990; Saltin
et al., 1995) and “live high–train low” experiments (Gore et al.,
2001) have shown that “live high” compared to “live low”
enhances βhm. However, these findings have also been recently
debated (Clark et al., 2004; Nordsborg et al., 2012), and the
specific effect of IHT on βhm during “live low” conditions
remains unclear.
Oral nitrate supplementation can enhance endurance exercise
performance in hypoxia (Vanhatalo et al., 2011; Masschelein
et al., 2012; Muggeridge et al., 2014), presumably by enhancing
mitochondrial efficiency (Larsen et al., 2011) and/or by reducing
the energy cost of muscle contraction (Bailey et al., 2010). It is
well-documented that the fraction of aerobic energy provision
gradually increases during intermittent sprints due to impaired
re-activation of glycolysis (Parolin et al., 1999). Recent data
indicate that nitrate intake increases blood flow and contractility
to a greater extent in fast-glycolytic than in slow-oxidative whole
muscle and muscle fibers (Hernández et al., 2012; Ferguson
et al., 2013). This may explain the more explicit effects of nitrate
supplementation on performance during high-intensity exercise
requiring greater input of type II fibers for production of high
power outputs at high contraction velocities (Vanhatalo et al.,
2011; Breese et al., 2013; Bailey et al., 2015; Coggan et al.,
2015). Higher muscle blood flow during recovery (Alvares
et al., 2012) could conceivably facilitate the clearance of waste
metabolites during intermittent maximal exercise bouts and
could, amongst the other aforementioned mechanism, contribute
to increased total work output during resistance training (Mosher
et al., 2016). Furthermore, nitrate supplementation in hypoxia
was shown to stimulate the rate of post-exercise muscle PCr
resynthesis (Vanhatalo et al., 2011, 2014). Taken together, these
results suggest that oral nitrate supplementation could enhance

performance during SIT in hypoxia and by this means potentiate
training adaptations.
We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether SIT performed
in hypoxic conditions elicited greater muscular and performance
adaptations compared to similar training performed in normoxic
conditions. Secondly, we aimed to investigate whether oral
nitrate supplementation during training enhanced the effects of
SIT in hypoxia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Thirty healthy men were recruited from the student population
at the KU Leuven by word of mouth and via announcements
on social media. To avoid confounding effects due to prior
altitude acclimatization, participants who were exposed to
altitudes higher than 1500 m during the 6 months prior to
the study were excluded from participation. From the initial
sample of 30 eligible participants, one did not complete the
study due to SIT intolerance, and two withdrew from the
study for reasons unrelated to the study protocol. Twenty-
seven participants completed the full study protocol and were
included in the final data analyses (for general characteristics
see Table 1). Participants were recreationally active [2.7 ± 1.6
h (SD) exercise participation per week; i.e., soccer, basketball,
cycling, running, swimming, strength training], but had not
engaged in a consistent training program or any sport at a
competitive level. Participants were non-smokers and did not
use medication or dietary supplements in the 3 months prior
to the study or during the period of the study. They were
instructed to maintain their habitual physical activity level
and normal diet throughout the study. Participants received
a summary table of nitrate-rich foods and were instructed to
avoid these foods throughout the study period. The study was
approved by the KU Leuven Biomedical Ethics Committee
(B322201316517) and was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written
informed consent after clearing medical screening and being fully
informed about the content of the experiments and the risks
involved.
Study Protocol
The study involved a test before (pretest) and after (posttest)
a 5-week controlled SIT program. The pretest and posttest

consisted of two experimental sessions separated by a 2-day
interval. Between 3 and 2 weeks prior to the start of the study,
participants completed two sessions of familiarization with the
experimental procedures. In the first familiarization session,
participants performed a maximal incremental VO2max-test on
a cycle ergometer (Avantronic Cyclus II, Leipzig, Germany).
The initial workload was set at 70 W and was increased by
30 W per min until volitional exhaustion. Respiratory gas
exchange was measured continuously during the test (Cortex
MetaLyzer II, Leipzig, Germany), and the highest oxygen uptake
measured over a 30-s period was defined as the maximal oxygen
uptake rate (VO2max). Participants then cycled for 15 min at
50 W to recover, after which a 30-s modified Wingate test
(W30s) was performed. To avoid limitations of power output
by co-ordination problems due to excessive cadence increase
(cadence > 120 rev·min−1), cadence during W30s was fixed at
100 rev·min−1 by using the isokinetic mode setting of the cycle
ergometer. In the second familiarization session, participants
completed a 30-min simulated time-trial (TT30min). They were
instructed to keep their cadence between 80 and 100 rev·min−1,
and adjust the resistance to develop the highest possible mean
power output (W). Following familiarization, participants were
matched into triplets by VO2max, mean power output during
TT30min, mean power output during W30s, as well as body mass
and height. Thereafter, the triplets were randomly assigned to
one of three experimental groups. One group performed the SIT
program in normoxia (FiO2 = 20.9%, n = 10) and received a
placebo supplement (N). All other participants trained in hypoxia
(FiO2 = 15.0%, ∼2750 m), with eight participants receiving a
placebo (H) and nine participants receiving a nitrate (HN, n =
9) supplement. Participants were not blinded for the normoxic
vs. hypoxic training conditions. Supplements were ingested 3 h
prior to each training session so as to produce high plasma nitrite
levels during the training in HN(Webb et al., 2008). Nitrate
was administered in the form of capsules containing 6.45 mmol
NaNO3 (∼400 mg molecular NO−
3 ). Placebo capsules contained
an equivalent amount of sodium (6.45 mmol) in the form of
NaCl. All supplements were identical in appearance, and were
administered single-blinded in N and double-blinded in H and
HN.
SIT Training Program
All SIT sessions were performed in the same normobaric hypoxic
facility (SportingEdge, Sherfield on London, UK) set at either
20.9% FiO2 (N), or 15.0% FiO2 (∼2750 m; H and HN). The
ambient O2 fraction was checked before the start of each training
session (MaxO+
2 A Scuba, Maxtec, Utah). Participants cycled
on cycle ergometers (Avantronic Cyclus II, Leipzig, Germany)
that were calibrated prior to the start of the study. Participants
completed three training sessions per week, with each separated
by 48-h of recovery. Each session consisted of intermittent 30-s
maximal sprints, interspersed by 4.5 min active recovery intervals
at 50 W. Cadence during the sprints was fixed at ∼100 rev·min−1
by using the isokinetic operation mode of the ergometers. The
number of sprints was increased from four in weeks 1–2, to
five in weeks 3–4, and six in the final week. Including 5-min
warm-up and cool-down @50 Watt, the training sessions lasted

Nitrate Supplementation during Hypoxic SIT
30 min in week 1, increasing to 40 min in week 5. During
each session participants were given verbal encouragement to
perform maximally during each sprint. To evaluate the effect of
SIT on arterial oxygenation, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2)
was monitored in the final week of the training period by pulse
oximetry (Nellcor OxiMax N-600x, Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, MO)
with a sensor placed 2 cm above the eyebrow.
Pretest and Posttest
All exercise testing was performed in normoxia. Participants were
instructed to refrain from any strenuous physical activity for at
least 48 h prior to the pretest. In order to minimize potential diet-
induced variations in muscle metabolism, participants received
a standardized carbohydrate-rich dinner (∼1500 kcal; 65%
carbohydrate, 15% fat, 20% protein) on the evening before
each experimental day. For the first session they reported
to the laboratory between 12:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. All
participants received a standardized breakfast (∼750 kcal, 70%
carbohydrate, 10% fat, 20% protein) between 7:00 and 10:30 a.m.
Participants completing sessions beyond 1:30 p.m. also received a
standardized lunch (∼650 kcal, 70% carbohydrate, 10% fat, 20%
protein), with the last meal consistently being served between
3 and 2.5 h prior to the start of the experiments. Following a
1-h rest in a comfortable chair, a percutaneous needle biopsy
(100–200 mg) was taken from the middle portion of the belly
of the right m. vastus lateralis using a 5-mm Bergström-type
needle under suction. Muscle samples were dissected in two
parts. One part was rapidly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at
−80◦C until subsequent biochemical analyses. The other part
was frozen in isopentane on liquid N2 and stored at −80◦C for
later histochemical analyses. Following the biopsy, participants
warmed up for 20 min at incremental workloads corresponding
to 70% (10 min) and then 90% (10 min) of their average power
output recorded during the TT30min familiarization session.
During TT30min heart rate was monitored continuously (Polar,
Kempele, Finland) and blood lactate concentration was measured
(Lactate Pro1, Arkray, Japan) at 10-min intervals from an
earlobe capillary blood sample. Participants were allowed to
drink water ad libitum and received on-line feedback about
the time remaining to completion. No verbal encouragement
was given. At the end of the experimental session, participants
were instructed to refrain from any strenuous physical activity,
before returning to the laboratory for the second session 2
days later. For this second session they arrived between 6 a.m.
and 11 a.m. after an overnight fast. Following a 20-min rest
period, they performed a maximal incremental VO2max-test on
the cycle ergometer (Avantronic Cyclus II, Leipzig, Germany).
Initial workload was set at 70 W and was increased by 30 W
every 3 min until volitional exhaustion. Thereafter participants
cycled for 15 min at 50 W to recover, whereupon the W30s
commenced. The cycle ergometer was set in the isokinetic mode
with cadence fixed at 100 rev·min−1. During both tests heart
rate was monitored continuously (Polar, Kempele, Finland).
Standardized verbal encouragement was given only during W30s.
Respiratory gas exchange was continuously measured (Cortex
MetaLyzer II, Leipzig, Germany) during the incremental test,
VO2max was determined as the highest oxygen uptake rate
measured over a 30-s period. Maximal power output (MPO)
was calculated by summing the workload during the last full
stage, plus 30 W multiplied by the fraction of the final stage
completed. Capillary blood samples for lactate determination
(Lactate Pro1, Arkray, Japan) were taken from the earlobe at the
end of each workload during the incremental test, and power
outputs corresponding to 2 and 4 mmol·L−1 blood lactate levels
were extrapolated on the lactate-power curve. Blood lactate was
also determined 1, 2, and 3 min after the W30s. Room temperature
(18–20◦C), oxygen content (20.9%), air humidity (40%) as well
as air ventilation were standardized. Pretests and the posttests
were performed on the same days of the week and time of the
day within each participant. The posttest commenced 3 or 4 days
following the last training session to eliminate acute physiological
effects due to the prior training session.
Analysis of Muscle Samples
Citrate Synthase Activity
Enzymatic activity of citrate synthase (CS) was measured by
standard colorimetric method. Briefly, 5 mg of wet muscle
tissue was dissolved in 400 µL of ice-cold homogenization
buffer (5 mM Hepes, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM
Dithiothreitol, pH 8.7). Protein concentration was determined
with a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). After dilution to 0.5 µg·µL−1,
samples and standards were loaded on a 96 well plate to
perform the assay in triplicate. CS catalyzes the reaction between
acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetic acid resulting in citric acid
and CoA with a thiol group (CoA-SH). Measurement of its
activity is based on the binding of CoA-SH to 5,5′-dithio-bis-
(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to form 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate
(TNB). The spectrophotometric absorbance intensity of TNB was
measured at 412 nm and CS activity was calculated and expressed
as µmol·min−1·g−1. The average coefficient of variation (CV) as
determined from the triplicate measures was 4.4%.
Buffering Capacity of Homogenized Muscle (βhm)
Details of the titration method for analysis of βhm have been
described elsewhere (Edge et al., 2006b). Briefly, freeze-dried
muscle samples (1.7–2.5 mg dm) were dissected from blood
and connective tissue and homogenized on ice in a sodium
fluoride containing buffer (33.3 µl 10 mM NaF per mg dm).
The homogenates were warmed in a hot water bath at 37.4◦C
for 5 min. Basal pH measurement was performed with a glass
microelectrode (MI-410, Microelectrodes, Bedford, NH, USA)
connected to a pH meter (Lab 850, Schott Instruments GmbH,
Mainz, Germany). The homogenates were first adjusted to
pH ∼7.2 with sodium hydroxide (0.02 M NaOH). Then a serial
addition of 2 µL hydrochloric acid (0.01 M HCl) was titrated until
a pH of ∼6.1 was reached. After each titration, the homogenates
were briefly vortexed to ensure a homogeneously mixed solution.
The number of moles of H+ per kg dry muscle required to change
pH from 7.1 to 6.5 was interpolated from the fitted titration trend
line and expressed as mmol H+ per kg dm per unit pH as a unit
for βhm. Each sample was measured in duplicate from which
the mean was taken. The average CV as determined from the
duplicate measures was 5.1%.

Muscle Carnosine Concentration
Details of muscle carnosine concentration determination by
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have been
described elsewhere (Mora et al., 2007). Briefly, about 5 mg of
dry muscle was dissected from blood and connective tissue and
extracted in a buffer containing perchloric acid (0.5 M PCA) and
1 mM EDTA. After centrifuging the samples for 4 min at 13,000
rev·min−1 at 4◦C, the supernatant was collected and neutralized
with a potassium bicarbonate containing buffer (2.1 M KHCO).
Samples were placed on ice for 5 min to allow CO2 to escape, after
which they were centrifuged at 5000 rev·min−1 for 4 min at 4◦C.
The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane
filter where after 20 µL of supernatant was injected into a Perkin-
Elmer HPLC system with an Atlantis HILIC Silica column (4.6 ×
150 mm, 3 µm). Mobile phase A contained 0.65 mM ammonium
acetate in ultrapure water/acetonitrile (25:75 ratio) at a pH of
5.5. Mobile phase B contained 4.55 mM ammonium acetate in
ultrapure water/acetonitrile (70:30 ratio) at a pH of 5.5. A linear
gradient from 100% phase A to 100% phase B in 13 min at a
flow rate of 1.4 mL·min−1 was used for separation. Separation
was monitored at a wavelength of 214 nm with a UV detector.
The average CV as calculated from 12 duplicate injections in the
HPLC system was 1.5%.
Muscle Fiber Type Composition
Serial 7-µm-thick cryosections were cut with a cryostat at −20◦C.
Cryosections were blocked for 60 min in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) containing 1% BSA. Hereafter they were incubated
in primary antibodies for myosin heavy chain I (MHCI) (BA-
F8, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and MHCIIa (SC-
71, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) dissolved in PBS
with 0.5% BSA for 120 min. Dilutions of primary antibodies
for MHCI and MHCII were 1:50 and 1:100, respectively. After
washing in PBS, cryosections were incubated in appropriate
conjugated secondary antibodies (type I: Alexa 647 goat anti-
mouse IgG2b, Invitrogen, diluted 1:300 in PBS with 0.5% BSA;
type IIa: Alexa 350 goat anti-mouse IgG1, Invitrogen, diluted
1:300 in PBS with 0.5% BSA) for 60 min. Additionally, together
with the secondary antibodies, membranes were stained using
wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) Texas Red (Life Technologies).
Slides were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon E1000,
Nikon, Boerhavedorp, Germany). The epifluorescence signal
was recorded using Cy5, DAPI, and Texas Red excitation
filters for visualization of type I fibers, type IIa fibers, and
cell membranes, respectively. Muscle fibers were classified
as type I, type IIa, or type IIx (unstained fibers). Photos
of the slides were analyzed with ImageJ software (version
1.41, National Institutes of Health, USA). Only fibers with
adequate cross-sections showing no signs of distortion or
folding were counted. 225 ± 27 (SD) fibers were analyzed per
biopsy.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in baseline values between N and H and between H
and HN were tested using a Student’s t-test. Main and interaction
effects were evaluated by two-way (group × time) repeated
measures ANOVA (SigmaStat and SigmaPlot software, Chicago,
IL, USA). We performed two separate ANOVA’s to test the two a
priori hypotheses: N was compared with H to evaluate whether
SIT yielded different effects in hypoxia vs. normoxia; H was
compared with HN to evaluate whether nitrate administration
was able to potentiate the effects of training in hypoxia. Tukey’s
honestly significant difference post hoc-test was run whenever
appropriate to identify specific effects. A probability level P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data are expressed
as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise
stated.
RESULTS
Arterial O2-Saturation during Training
(Figure 1)
Arterial O2-saturation (SpO2) was continuously measured
during the SIT sessions in week 5. In N, resting SpO2-values were
98.7 ± 0.4 and 97.6 ± 0.5% at the start and at the end of the
sessions (n.s.). Corresponding values in H were lower, both at the
start (91.0 ± 0.8%) and at the end of the sessions (89.3 ± 1.4%;
P < 0.05). Compared with sprint 1, post-exercise SpO2-values
were lower in the latter sprints of the session in both groups.
Each sprint also reduced SpO2 more in H (–6.0 ± 0.6%) than
in N (−1.9 ± 0.2%, P < 0.05). SpO2-values were not significantly
different between H and HN: average SpO2 during SIT was 85.0 ±
0.6% in H vs. 86.7 ± 0.3% in HN (P = 0.20).
Training Performance (Figure 2)
The number of sprints per session was increased from four
in weeks 1–2, to five in weeks 3–4, and to six in week 5.
Irrespective of the experimental group, mean power output in

W in the final sprint of the session. There were no significant
differences in power output between experimental groups at
any time during training. Average total work done (kJ) per

total work output over the 5-week training period was 1340 ±
39 kJ in N, 1311 ± 52 kJ in H, and 1261 ± 51 kJ in HN
(P > 0.50). Blood lactate concentrations at the end of the
training sessions peaked at ∼14–15 mmol·L−1 on average in all
groups.
Exercise Performance (Table 2)
Baseline values of the incremental exercise test, TT30min and
W30s were not significantly different between N and H (P >
0.05) or H and HN (P > 0.05). Compared with the pretest,
VO2max in the posttest was increased (P < 0.05) by ∼16% in
N vs. ∼11% in both H and HN (P < 0.05), but there were no
significant differences in VO2max or change in VO2max between
N and H (P = 0.26) or between H and HN. Similarly, SIT

Data are mean ± SEM and represent average total work output (kJ) per

from four in weeks 1–2, to five in weeks 3–4, and six in the final week. One
group trained in normoxia (FiO2 = 20.9%) while receiving placebo (N, open

increased (P < 0.05) time to exhaustion (10–11%), peak power
output (8–10%), and power output corresponding to 4 mmol·L−1
blood lactate concentrations (5–11%) in the three experimental
groups without significant differences between N and H or H
and HN. Mean power output during the TT30min in the pretest
was, on average, ∼200 W. Training tended to increase mean
power output during the TT30min in N (+4%, P = 0.062) and
significantly increased power output during the TT30min in H and
HN (+8%, P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences
between N and H or H and HN. Blood lactate concentrations
during the TT30min were, on average, ∼6 mmol·L−1 at a heart
rate of ∼174 b·min−1 in each group in both the pretest and the
posttest (data not shown). Mean power output during W30s in
the pretest also was similar between the groups (660–670 W).
SIT increased power output by ∼6% in N and H (P < 0.05), vs.
+12% in HN (P < 0.05), yet differences between H and HN were
not significant (HN, P = 0.085). Accordingly, W30s produced
similar peak blood lactate concentrations (∼10–12 mmol·L−1)
in the three experimental groups in both the pretest and the
posttest.
Muscle Fiber Type Composition (Table 3)
The relative number of type I (∼45–50%), type IIa (∼40–45%),
and type IIx fibers (∼10%) in m. vastus lateralis in the pretest was
similar between N and H (P > 0.05 for all fiber types) as well as
between H and HN (P > 0.05 for all fiber types). SIT reduced
the proportion of type IIx fibers in all the groups (P < 0.05). In
the posttest the proportion of type IIa fibers was higher in HN
than in H (P < 0.05), with training significantly increasing the
proportion of IIa fibers from 45 to 56% in HN (P < 0.05), but
not in N (main effect of time P = 0.07) or H (P = 0.40). Similar
changes occurred for fiber-specific CSAs, which also were similar

between N and H or H and HN in the pretest (P > 0.05 for
all fiber types). SIT reduced the relative CSA of type IIx fibers
in all the groups (P < 0.05). Conversely, type IIa relative CSA
increased in HN (+11%, P < 0.05) only and was significantly
greater in HN compared to H in the posttest (P < 0.05). SIT
did not alter mean fiber CSA (µm2) of the different fiber types,
except for type IIx mean fiber CSA in H which increased from
the pretest to the posttest (P < 0.05). However, type IIx fibers
were observed in only half of the participants in H (n = 4), in
which only few type IIx fibers were observed in the pretest [44 ±
33(SD)] and in the posttest [30 ± 28 (SD)]. Hence interpretation
should be performed with caution. Mean fiber-specific CSAs were
not significantly different between N and H or H and HN at any
time.
Muscle Biochemistry (Table 4)
Baseline values for muscular buffering capacity, carnosine
content, and maximal citrate synthase activity measured in
homogenized muscle tissue were not significantly different
between N and H or H and HN (P > 0.05). Buffering capacity
of homogenized muscle was unaffected by SIT irrespective of
the experimental condition. SIT on average increased muscle
carnosine content by ∼13% in H and HN (main effect of
time P < 0.05, no significant post hoc time effects within H
(P = 0.11) or HN (P = 0.13)), but not in N (+6%, P =
0.072). Nonetheless, the increase in carnosine content was not
significantly different between N and H (P = 0.48), and there
were no significant differences in muscle carnosine between the
groups in either the pretest or the posttest. Maximal citrate
synthase activity increased by 54% in N (P < 0.05) and by
just under half that in H (22%) and HN (25%) (P < 0.05), yet
changes were not significantly different between N and H (P =
0.10).
DISCUSSION
The most striking results from the current study are that (a)
5 weeks of SIT, performed in hypoxic conditions, significantly
increased the fraction of type IIa muscle fibers, but only when
completed with concomitant dietary nitrate supplementation and
(b) SIT performed in hypoxic conditions does not ameliorate
physiological adaptations yielding enhanced aerobic or anaerobic
endurance exercise performance.

 De Smet et al.
Nitrate Supplementation during Hypoxic SIT
We administered 400 mg of molecular nitrate ∼3 h before
each SIT session in HN, which has previously been shown to
significantly increase the plasma nitrite concentration (Wylie
et al., 2013) and improve oxygen-efficiency of the skeletal muscle
during exercise (Bailey et al., 2010; Larsen et al., 2011). We
postulated that this might delay fatigue development and thereby
attenuate the reduced training intensity often shown during
hypoxic sprint training (Kelly et al., 2014; Thompson et al.,
2015). Training workloads were, however, similar between all
groups, regardless of whether the training was performed in
normoxia (N) or in hypoxia, either with (HN) or without (H)
nitrate supplementation. Thus, the degree of neuromechanical
activation during training was similar between all experimental
conditions.
Even in the absence of fiber hypertrophy, fiber type transition
from IIx to IIa might be expected during short-term SIT
involving 30-s sprints in healthy volunteers (for review, see
Ross and Leveritt, 2001). In keeping with the published findings
(Allemeier et al., 1994), 5 weeks of SIT did not induce muscle
fiber hypertrophy in the current study. Consistent with this,
SIT in normoxia reduced the relative type IIx fiber number,
whilst the proportion of type IIa fibers tended to increase. SIT
in hypoxia (H) also reduced type IIx fiber number, but did
not alter the fraction of type IIa fibers. Interestingly, when
nitrate supplementation was provided during SIT in hypoxic
conditions (HN), relative type IIa fiber number increased from
45 to 56%.
Previous evidence indicates that nitric oxide (NO) plays a
pivotal role in MHC-based muscle fiber type transition (Smith
et al., 2002; Martins et al., 2012; Suwa et al., 2015). NO is
suggested to increase inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen
synthase kinase (GSK)-3β in rat fast-twitch muscle, promoting
nuclear factor of activated T-cell c1 (NFATc1) dephosphorylation
and nuclear accumulation, resulting in a fast-to-slow fiber type
transition (Martins et al., 2012). Furthermore, pharmacological
inhibition of NO-synthase (NOS) activity by NG-nitro-L-
arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) negated overload-induced type
II to I fiber type transition (Smith et al., 2002). Results from
both rodent (Hernández et al., 2012; Ferguson et al., 2013) and
human (Bailey et al., 2015; Coggan et al., 2015) exercise studies
indicated that oral nitrate intake exerts its actions primarily in
type II muscle fibers by increasing blood flow (Ferguson et al.,
2013), by elevating sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and
the expression of calcium handling proteins such as calsequestrin
1 and the dihydropyridine receptor (Hernández et al., 2012), as
well as by reducing muscle metabolic perturbation (Vanhatalo
et al., 2011). Nitrate supplementation also stimulated rate of
force development (Hernández et al., 2012) and power output
(Bailey et al., 2015; Coggan et al., 2015) during high-intensity
and high-velocity muscle contractions. Thus, while endogenous
NO production during acute exposure of lowlanders to hypoxia
is reduced, due to inhibition of the L-arginine–NOS pathway
(Lundberg et al., 2008), exogenous nitrate provides an alternative
pathway to stimulate NO production via nitrate to nitrite to NO
conversion (Lundberg et al., 2008). Given that NO probably plays
an important role in exercise-induced MHC-based adult fiber
type transitions, it is plausible that oral nitrate intake during SIT
in hypoxia served as an adequate back-up mechanism for NO-
induced muscle fiber transformation to compensate for impaired
NOS activity. However, in contrast to what could be expected
from the current literature, i.e., stimulation of type IIx to IIa and
IIa to type I fiber type transition (Smith et al., 2002; Martins
et al., 2012; Suwa et al., 2015), nitrate supplementation during
hypoxic SIT did not stimulate the transition of type IIa to type
I muscle fibers. Follow-up studies are needed to elucidate the
cellular mechanisms by which oral nitrate intake can stimulate
the conversion to type IIa muscle fibers during SIT in hypoxia.
Despite a decrease in the fraction of IIx muscle fibers in all
conditions and an increase in the fraction of IIa muscle fibers in
HN, there was no change in βhm with training in any of the three
groups. We postulated that SIT in hypoxia, due to an enhanced
contribution of glycolysis to ATP production, might impair βhm
compared with identical training in normoxia. Contrary to our
hypothesis, however, SIT did not alter βhm, regardless of whether
the training was completed in normoxia or hypoxia. Our data
shows that SIT is not an adequate strategy to improve βhm,
at least in healthy recreationally active volunteers during short-
term training. Findings from the present and earlier studies
support the opinion that high-intensity interval training (HIT)
at workloads corresponding to 120–170% of the lactate threshold
(Edge et al., 2006a,b) is probably more effective to raise βhm
than explicit “glycolytic training” via SIT (Nevill et al., 1989;
Harmer et al., 2000; Baguet et al., 2011). Adaptations of βhm
during long-term SIT in elite sprinters may be different, given
their substantially higher proportion of type II fibers and higher
glycolytic capacity.
The physicochemical buffer capacity of muscle (∼ βhm)
is composed of proteins, inorganic phosphate, bicarbonate,
and the histidine-containing dipeptide carnosine. The histidine
containing dipeptide content of muscle (carnosine in human
muscle) contributes ∼7–8% to total βhm (Harris et al.,
1990; Mannion et al., 1992; Hill et al., 2007), and elevations
through training or dietary supplementation remain a plausible
mechanism for increasing βhm. Accordingly, we determined
the effect of SIT on muscle carnosine content and observed
no significant effect in normoxic conditions. However, a main
effect of time (pretest vs. posttest), though without significant
post hoc effects, was found for the increase in muscle carnosine
content following training in hypoxic conditions (H and HN),
yet the training-induced changes were not significantly different
between N and H. Earlier experiments in our laboratory
(Puype et al., 2013) have shown that SIT in hypoxia did not
increase muscle carnosine content (unpublished observations),
suggesting some equivocality in the findings across our own
studies. This would seem in line with the existing literature,
given that SIT has previously been shown to substantially
increase muscle carnosine content in one study (Suzuki et al.,
2004), although no such training-effect has been shown in
any other longitudinal intervention study using SIT (Baguet
et al., 2011) or resistance training involving either short (∼10
s) (Kendrick et al., 2009) or longer (∼20–45 s) series of
maximal muscle contractions in normoxia (Mannion et al.,
1994). Future studies performing single-fiber determination
of muscle carnosine are warranted for clear interpretation of

training-induced changes in fiber-specific myocellular carnosine
content.
Buffering capacity of homogenized muscle, as measured in the
present study, is different to muscle buffering capacity in vivo
and reflects the altered state and chemistry of muscle after
homogenization. Assuming that there would be no change in any
other source of myocellular buffering, it could be estimated that a
13% increase in muscle carnosine content (i.e., 4 mmol·kg dm−1)
would increase homogenized muscle buffering capacity over the
titration pH range of 7.1 to 6.5 by 2.21 mmol H+·kg dm−1·pH−1,
given that at pH 7.1 and pH 6.5 34.9 and 68.1% of the additional
carnosine content is already in the protonated form, respectively
(Harris et al., 1990). This represents an increase of ∼1.7% of the
initial βhm in the present study and falls below the detection
limit of the titration assay used. However, as we don’t know what
muscle buffering capacity in vivo is over this range, we cannot
calculate the importance of this increase.
We also evaluated the effect of SIT on muscle oxidative
capacity by measuring citrate synthase (CS) maximal activity.
SIT substantially elevated CS activity (+25–50%), independent of
whether the training was performed in normoxia or in hypoxia.
These findings are in contrast with reports from single-leg studies
reporting greater increases in CS activity following endurance
training (30 min at 65–75% maximal work capacity) in hypoxic
conditions compared to training at similar absolute workloads
in normoxic conditions (Terrados et al., 1990; Melissa et al.,
1997; Green et al., 1999). However, if the training workloads
are matched for relative intensity, endurance training in hypoxic
conditions abolishes rather than augments training-induced
changes in muscle oxidative function (Bakkman et al., 2007).
Training workloads during SIT in the present study were similar
between normoxic and hypoxic conditions in both absolute and
relative terms. In line with previous reports, SIT in normoxic
conditions increased CS activity (for review see Sloth et al.,
2013), but sprint training in hypoxic conditions did not augment
adaptations in muscle oxidative capacity (Faiss et al., 2013a;
Puype et al., 2013).
The hypothesis driving the current study was underpinned
by the notion that performing SIT in hypoxic conditions,
alone or in combination with oral nitrate intake, might yield
specific physiological adaptations to boost exercise performance.
Anaerobic glycolysis accounts for about 50% of the total ATP
production during a 30-s maximal exercise bout (Putman et al.,
1995). It is therefore reasonable to postulate that a higher
proportion of type IIa muscle fibers, providing a higher capacity
for glycolytic ATP production, should be ergogenic during a 30-s
all-out exercise. As discussed above, hypoxic SIT in conjunction
with oral nitrate supplementation increased relative type IIa
muscle area compared with hypoxic SIT alone. Interestingly, this
also tended to translate into a greater gain in power output during
W30s (+12% in HN vs. +6% in H, P = 0.08), which indicates that
short-term oral nitrate supplementation in conjunction with SIT
may be a valid strategy to enhance performance in “glycolytic”
exercise events such as a 400-meter dash, by contributing to
a beneficial fiber type shift. Future studies should seek to
confirm this possibility. It is also important to emphasize that
we did not study the effect of nitrate intake during SIT in
normoxia, neither did we study exercise performance in hypoxia.
Thus, we cannot extrapolate our findings to these conditions.
Contrary to 30-s sprint performance, determinants of aerobic
exercise capacity were similar between the groups. Five weeks
of SIT enhanced cycling power output corresponding to 2 and
4 mmol·L−1 blood lactate levels, VO2max, and 30-min cycling
time-trial performance, independent of whether the training
was performed in normoxia, or in hypoxia with or without
oral nitrate supplementation. These findings indicate that short-
term SIT in hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions is not
an advantageous strategy for enhancing normoxic endurance
exercise performance in recreationally active individuals.
In conclusion, the current experiment demonstrated that
oral nitrate supplementation during short-term sprint-interval
training increased the proportion of type IIa muscle fibers in
muscle, which may contribute to enhanced performance in short
maximal exercise events requiring a very high glycolytic rate.
Compared with SIT in normoxia, SIT in hypoxia did not generate
beneficial physiological adaptations yielding enhanced aerobic or
anaerobic endurance exercise performance.
