Abstract
Background—Many physicians believe that advanced practice clinicians (APCs [nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants]) provide care of relatively lower value.
Objective—To compare use of low-value services among U.S. APCs and physicians.
Design—Service use after primary care visits was evaluated for 3 conditions after adjustment for 
patient and provider characteristics and year. Patients with guideline-based red flags were 
excluded and analyses stratified by office-versus hospital-based visits, acute versus nonacute 
presentations, and whether clinicians self-identified as the patient’s primary care provider (PCP).

 Setting—National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), 1997 to 2011.
Patients—Patients presenting with upper respiratory infections (URIs), back pain, or headache.
Measurements—Use of guideline-discordant antibiotics (for URIs), radiography (for URIs and 
back pain), computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (for headache and 
back pain), and referrals to other physicians (for all 3 conditions).
Results—12 170 physician and 473 APC office-based visits and 13 359 physician and 2947 APC 
hospital-based visits were identified. Although office-based clinicians saw similar patients, 
hospital-based APCs saw younger patients (mean age, 42.6 vs. 45.0 years; P < 0.001), and 
practiced in urban settings less frequently (49.7% vs. 81.7% of visits; P < 0.001) than hospital-
based physicians. Unadjusted and adjusted results revealed that APCs ordered antibiotics, CT or 
MRI, radiography, and referrals as often as physicians in both settings. Stratification suggested 
that self-identified PCP APCs ordered more services than PCP physicians in the hospital-based 
setting.
Limitation—NHAMCS reflects hospital-based APC care; NAMCS samples physician practices 
and likely underrepresents office-based APCs.
Conclusion—APCs and physicians provided an equivalent amount of low-value health services, 
dispelling physicians’ perceptions that APCs provide lower-value care than physicians for these 
common conditions.

The U.S. health care system faces a looming shortage of primary care providers (PCPs) (1, 
2), and estimates suggest that it might reach up to 20 000 physicians by 2020 (3). The causes 
of the projected shortage include both demand- and supply-related factors, such as an 
increased demand for primary care services from the millions of newly insured patients after 
passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as fewer trainees electing 
to enter primary care (2, 4–7).
In response to these trends, many have advocated for expanding the role of advanced 
practice clinicians (APCs [nurse practitioners and physician assistants]) in primary care as a 
potential policy solution to mitigate the workforce shortage (1, 8–10). These practitioners 
represent the fastest-growing segment of the primary care workforce, and they are more 
likely to serve minority and underserved patients (1). Studies suggest that APCs may be a 
cost-saving alternative to physicians in primary care, even after adjustment for case 
complexity and productivity, mainly because of their lower salaries (10–13). Although 
previous research and systematic reviews suggest that APCs provide care of the same quality 
as that of physicians (14–17), little is known about their effect on providing wasteful or low-
value health services. According to a recent national survey, most physicians believe that 
APCs provide lower-quality care than they do, and nearly one quarter think that expanding 
nurse practitioners’ roles in U.S. practice would decrease the efficiency and value of health 
care (18).

 Despite these perceptions, no previous research compared APCs and physicians directly 
with regard to ordering potentially guideline-discordant and low-value health services, 
which has important implications for the quality and efficiency of care delivery in the U.S. 
health care system. For example, an estimated 30% of U.S. health care spending is wasteful 
(19), and much of this waste is driven by use of low-value health services, which is defined 
as patient care that typically portends a greater probability of harm than benefit (20–22). In 
this context, we used national data on ambulatory visits to providers to compare the use of 
potentially low-value health services between APCs and physicians in the management of 
common conditions in the primary care setting.
Methods
Data Sources
We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the 
National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) on ambulatory visits to 
clinicians from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2011. The NAMCS comprises 
probability samples of outpatient visits to nonfederal, office-based physician practices, 
whereas the NHAMCS contains data on visits to nonfederal, hospital-based outpatient 
departments, including outpatient clinics and emergency departments. Developed in parallel, 
the NAMCS and NHAMCS have common designs, variables, and visit weights. They both 
are structured to represent ambulatory visits to physicians across the United States, but they 
also contain data on visits to APCs (23, 24). Importantly, the NAMCS samples physician 
practices, some of which include APCs, but does not include independently practicing 
APCs. The NHAMCS samples hospital-based outpatient departments, which more 
commonly include APCs, including those who practice independently. Thus, APCs in our 
sample are represented predominantly by the NHAMCS data. Further details on the 
NAMCS and NHAMCS are available in the Methods section in the Appendix (including 
Appendix Figures 1 and 2, available at www.annals.org) and from the National Center for 
Health Statistics (23).
Data Collection Procedures
The data are collected by a standardized survey form, which the provider or other staff 
completes soon after each ambulatory visit. The NAMCS and NHAMCS both collect 
information on the patient’s primary reason for the visit (for example, the chief symptom); 2 
other nonprimary reasons for the visit; up to 3 diagnoses, derived from the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM); the payer for 
the visit (for example, commercial or Medicare insurance); whether the provider self-
identified as the patient’s PCP; patient and provider demographic information; tests and 
treatments ordered; and medications listed during the visit.
Study Sample
We selected outpatient visits (excluding those to the emergency department) for 3 common 
conditions seen in the primary care setting (for example, general medicine, family medicine, 
or internal medicine physician offices or outpatient hospital departments; see the Methods 
section in the Appendix for more details) that frequently are associated with use of low-

 value services, namely upper respiratory infections (URIs [such as acute bronchitis and 
pharyngitis]), back pain, and headache.
For all chief symptoms, the NAMCS and NHAMCS provide information on the reasons for 
patient visits, divided into 5 categories: new-onset symptoms (<3 months duration), acute-
on-chronic flare-up, chronic routine visit, routine or preventive care, and pre- or 
postoperative visit. We defined acute visits by combining the categories new-onset 
symptoms and acute-on-chronic flare-up.
APCs
Both the NAMCS and NHAMCS identify the clinician who provided care during the visit as 
a physician, a nurse practitioner, a physician assistant, a nurse midwife, a registered or 
licensed practical nurse, or another provider. For this study, we excluded registered and 
licensed practical nurses, other providers, and midwives (see the Appendix for details on 
excluding midwives), because they typically do not have the authority to order such services 
as antibiotic treatment, imaging, and referrals. For our primary analysis, we classified nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants as APCs. As a secondary analysis, we also evaluated 
results by APC visit subtype (for example, APCs seeing the patient alone vs. alongside the 
physician) and profession subtype (for example, nurse practitioner vs. physician assistant) 
and compared them with results from physicians seeing patients without an APC, who made 
up the reference group (Appendix). Although training of nurse practitioners and physician 
assistants, as well as the regulatory environment in which they practice, differs between 
these groups and among the states in which they practice, we chose a combined APC 
variable, because both types of clinicians often play similar roles in the primary care setting 
(25) and because it made interpretation easier. In addition, the findings of the subgroup 
categories described earlier largely were consistent with our overall results.
Outcome Measures
We studied 3 types of outcomes widely considered to be low-value services in most cases, as 
identified in previous studies or guidelines—use of antibiotics (for URIs); plain radiography 
(for URIs and back pain); and advanced imaging, including both magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) (for back pain and headache)—as well as 1 
overall outcome that applied to all 3 conditions. Our cohort excluded visits from patients 
with red flags (for example, symptoms or diagnoses of neurologic deficit in those with back 
pain or headache, concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or HIV in those with 
acute bronchitis) and was derived from previous research by our group and others using 
NAMCS and NHAMCS data (20, 21, 26, 27), which were based on relevant clinical and 
regulatory agency guidelines during the study period (28–32). In addition, we evaluated 
referrals to other physicians (for all 3 conditions), which generally are not required for these 
illnesses and might indicate more unnecessary downstream utilization.
Potential Confounders
From the data recorded for each visit, we assessed for patient age (measured as a continuous 
variable), sex, race or ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity count (33), symptom acuity, 
insurance status, urban location, geographic region, and year. The clinicians who completed

 the survey defined race and ethnicity as 2 separate variables; we reclassified patients to a 
single 4-level race or ethnicity variable (white, black, Hispanic, and other).
We also considered whether the clinician self-identified as the patient’s PCP, which we 
determined as follows: From 1997 through 2004, the NAMCS and NHAMCS asked, “Are 
you the patient’s primary care physician?” From 2005 through 2011, the NAMCS changed 
the question to “Are you the patient’s primary care physician/provider?” During 2005 and 
2006, the NHAMCS asked, “Are you the patient’s primary care physician/provider?” 
Finally, in 2007 to 2011, the NHAMCS changed the question to “Is this clinic the patient’s 
primary care provider?”
For the NAMCS analyses, we also identified practice setting types, which we combined into 
3 main categories: private solo or group continuity practices; noncontinuity, freestanding 
clinics or urgent care centers; and other continuity-type clinics (such as federally qualified 
health centers, community health centers, and nonfederal government clinics).
Statistical Analysis
We pooled all years and conducted separate analyses for our NAMCS and NHAMCS 
samples because they each use distinct sampling approaches with regard to APC practice, as 
explained earlier. All analyses were weighted and accounted for the complex sampling. We 
used chi-square tests and unadjusted linear regression to compare visit characteristics among 
APCs and physicians, respectively. For our unadjusted analysis, we pooled all years within 
each outcome category and used unadjusted logistic regression models for each outcome, 
focusing on APC provider as the exposure of interest. For adjusted analyses, we estimated 
similar models but included the aforementioned demographic, clinical, and provider 
variables to control for potential confounders. We also controlled for year.
To evaluate important potential effect modification based on symptom acuity and whether 
the clinician self-identified as the PCP, we also stratified our results by symptom acuity and 
PCP status. Because of the wording change associated with the PCP variable, as noted 
earlier, we conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure that stratified results were similar when 
we compared data after 2005 with our main findings (see the Appendix for details). Finally, 
we also evaluated practice settings in which APCs predominantly practiced independently 
versus those in which physicians practiced alone (Appendix).
We performed all our analyses with SAS-Callable SUDAAN, version 11.0 (RTI 
International), using SUDAAN subpopulation procedures. These functions use information 
from the entire NAMCS and NHAMCS sample to account for the complex study design and 
sampling weights to produce national estimates (24).
The Harvard Medical School Committee on Human Studies determined that this study was 
exempt from review.

Results
We identified 28 949 U.S. primary care visits for the 3 conditions, including 25 529 
physician and 3420 APC visits, representing an estimated 681 million total visits from 1997 
to 2011. Of these, 89.9% reflected visits to clinicians in office-based physician practices 
(data from the NAMCS) and 10.1% to those practicing in hospital-based outpatient clinics 
(data from the NHAMCS). Table 1 presents relevant patient and visit characteristics by 
clinician subtype, and Appendix Tables 1 and 2 (available at www.annals.org) present these 
characteristics by additional APC subgroupings. Although office-based APCs and 
physicians saw largely similar patients, hospital-based APCs treated younger patients (mean 
age, 42.6 vs. 45.0 years; P < 0.001) and delivered care in an urban setting less frequently 
(49.7% vs. 81.7% of visits; P < 0.001) than hospital-based physicians.
Unadjusted Frequencies of Use
In the unadjusted analyses (Table 2), APCs were not significantly more likely to order 
antibiotics, CT or MRI, or radiography, or to refer patients to other physicians, than 
physicians in office- or hospital-based settings, although the rates of these outcomes differed 
across these settings. We also examined visits among the APC subgroups (Appendix Tables 
3 and 4, available at www.annals.org), which revealed few differences.
Multivariable-Adjusted and Stratified Results
After multivariable adjustment, practice patterns among APCs and physicians remained 
consistent with the unadjusted findings in both office- and hospital-based settings (Table 3). 
Appendix Tables 5 and 6 (available at www.annals.org) present multivariable-adjusted 
results by visit and profession category.
Table 4 presents results stratified by PCP versus non-PCP visits. Hospital-based PCP APCs 
ordered more antibiotics (52.8% vs. 46.0%; P = 0.043) and made more referrals (11.8% vs. 
8.3%; P = 0.018) than hospital-based PCP physicians. However, only referral differences 
remained significant in a sensitivity analysis of data recorded in the surveys from 2005 to 
2011, after the wording change in the question regarding clinicians self-identifying as PCPs 
(see the Appendix for details). Test results for interaction were positive only for antibiotic 
use (P = 0.019 for interaction), suggesting that differences in antibiotic use between PCP 
APCs and PCP physicians were greater than those between non-PCP APCs and non-PCP 
physicians in the hospital setting. Table 5 presents results stratified by acute versus nonacute 
visits. Symptom-acuity stratification demonstrated that hospital-based APCs referred 
patients to other physicians for nonacute care more often than hospital-based physicians 
(20.3% vs. 11.4%; P = 0.022). Tests for interaction between acuity and APCs were 
nonsignificant for all outcomes. Practice settings with more independent APCs had results

 that were not substantively different from our main findings. Detailed results are presented 
in Appendix Table 7 (available at www.annals.org).
Discussion
This large national comparison between APCs and physicians on the use of potentially low-
value health services revealed that APCs and physicians in both office- and hospital-based 
primary care settings provided equivalent amounts of guideline-discordant low-value care, 
including antibiotics, CT or MRI, plain radiography, and referrals to other physicians. 
Moreover, our results remained largely consistent when stratified by important potential 
effect modifiers, such as symptom acuity and whether the clinician self-identified as the 
PCP, although results did suggest that self-identified PCP APCs used more services than 
PCP physicians in the hospital-based setting. These findings have important implications for 
ongoing efforts to improve the quality and value of health care delivered in the United States 
as well as for the expanding role of APCs in primary care delivery.
Previous studies and meta-analyses showed that APC-provided care is similar in quality to 
that of physician-provided care, with equal or better outcomes (15). Despite this evidence, a 
recent national survey revealed that most physicians believe APCs provide lower-quality 
care than physicians, and nearly one quarter of those surveyed think expanding nurse 
practitioners’ role in U.S. practice would decrease the efficiency and value of care (18). Few 
studies, however, have compared APCs and physicians specifically in providing inefficient 
or low-value care. The existing literature is limited and shows mixed results, with some 
studies showing increased value and others showing no net change or lower value associated 
with APCs (15, 34, 35). Moreover, these studies focused mainly on health care costs, and 
few investigated the use of guideline-discordant and low-value health services as we did in 
our study. As debate continues over whether APCs’ scope of practice should expand (36), 
our analysis adds important data to the literature, suggesting that U.S. APCs seem to provide 
care equal to that of physicians in value and efficiency of delivery.
Our finding that APCs order antibiotics, CT or MRI, radiography, and referrals as frequently 
as physicians is reassuring given recent efforts to expand the number of APCs, as well as 
their role, to meet the increasing demand for primary care while the primary care physician 
workforce continues to shrink. Our results on antibiotic use among APCs and physicians are 
consistent with those of studies from a decade ago (37, 38). Our study builds on previous 
work by also demonstrating the similarities between APCs and physicians regarding 
potentially low-value referrals they make for conditions commonly encountered in primary 
care. The NAMCS and NHAMCS data we used also provide better clinical granularity and 
validity than earlier claims-based research, which frequently underrepresented APCs, who 
often bill under a physician’s name (39). The lack of differences in imaging use between 
APCs and physicians contrasts with recent research using Medicare claims data that showed 
greater imaging use among APCs than physicians (40). That study, however, included 
patients with multiple different presenting complaints of varying complexity. Consistent 
with our study, the authors found little to no difference among patients presenting with back 
pain or URI, which are relatively straightforward conditions with clearly defined guidelines. 
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that APCs order imaging more frequently

 for patients whose conditions might be more complex than those we studied or for which 
guidelines are lacking.
Our analysis is subject to several limitations. First, because the NAMCS samples ambulatory 
visits to physician practices, it may exclude visits to more independent APCs or to APC-led 
practices, clearly underrepresenting APC care. However, we note that by law, physician 
assistants cannot practice without physician supervision, and previous research suggests that 
few nurse practitioners lead their own practices nationally (39). In addition, because the 
NHAMCS samples visits to outpatient departments rather than to physicians, it is considered 
more nationally representative of APCs in those settings and should be generalizable to 
APCs who practice at nonfederal outpatient hospital clinics (41). Moreover, although the 
NHAMCS represents a smaller proportion of care than office-based visits, our finding that 
NAMCS results were consistent with our NHAMCS results is reassuring.
Second, we could not identify low-value care precisely because we lacked granular clinical 
data. Thus, in some instances, such care might be justified. However, prominent clinical 
guidelines, specialty societies, and regulatory bodies previously identified these measures as 
being low-value in most circumstances. Moreover, our analyses excluded clinical red flags 
and controlled for age, symptom acuity, and comorbid conditions; thus, it is unlikely that 
variations in case complexity are confounding our results.
Third, we lacked longitudinal data at the patient level, as the NAMCS and NHAMCS are 
cross-sectional, visit-based surveys; thus, we could not assess whether various tests or 
referrals ordered were completed. However, we have no reason to suspect that completion 
rates would differ between APCs and physicians.
Fourth, we also could not account for variations in state-level scope-of-practice laws across 
the United States, which may limit an APC’s ability to order diagnostic tests (40, 42, 43). 
However, controlling for larger geographic regions did not affect our findings, and 
importantly, a recent rigorous analysis of the effect of state scope-of-practice laws on APC 
utilization revealed only a modest association at best (44).
We found that APCs and physicians ordered potentially guideline-discordant and low-value 
health services with similar frequency, dispelling physicians’ perceptions that APCs provide 
lower-value care than they do. We also acknowledge, however, that attributes of specific 
clinicians or practice settings might lead to practice patterns that differ from those we 
observed overall. As APCs rapidly expand their role in primary care, these findings have 
important implications for clinicians, practice leaders, and policymakers who have a stake in 
improving access to primary care services and ensuring the delivery of high-value care.

Appendix: Further Details and Subanalyses
Methods
Complex Design of the NAMCS and NHAMCS
The NAMCS and NHAMCS both use a multistage probability sample design to acquire 
nationally representative samples of U.S. ambulatory visits to physicians (45). During the 
first stage, 112 geographic primary sampling units were selected from among those 
originally used in the National Health Interview Survey. For the second stage, physician 
office practices (NAMCS) or hospitals (NHAMCS) were chosen within these primary 
sampling units. In the last stage, a subset of visits to these office practices or outpatient 
departments was sampled during a prespecified period. This complex design allowed 
calculation of national-level estimates for physician visits and associated SEs by using the 
survey weights provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. See Appendix Figures 
1 and 2 for details on imputation methods to handle missing values.
Excluding Midwives
From 1997 through 2000, the NAMCS and NHAMCS included midwives and nurse 
practitioners as separate variables; from 2001 through 2011, they were combined into a 
single element. We examined visits to midwives and nurse practitioners for the selected

 conditions from 1997 to 2000 in our cohort and identified 14 midwife and 709 nurse 
practitioner visits, suggesting that the combined variable from 2001 to 2011 captures 
predominantly nurse practitioner visits in our primary care–focused cohort.
NAMCS and NHAMCS Wording Change on Whether Clinician Self-Identified as the PCP
From 1997 through 2004, the NAMCS and NHAMCS asked, “Are you the patient’s primary 
care physician?” Therefore, some APCs may have answered “no” because they were not 
physicians. From 2005 through 2011, the NAMCS question was changed to “Are you the 
patient’s primary care physician/provider?” In addition, from 2005 through 2006, the 
NHAMCS question became “Are you the patient’s primary care physician/provider?” 
Finally, from 2007 through 2011, the NHAMCS asked, “Is this clinic the patient’s primary 
care provider?” We therefore compared the frequency of APCs self-identifying as the PCP 
from 1997 to 2004 versus 2005 to 2011. We found that the frequency increased on both the 
NAMCS (59.5% from 1997 to 2004, to 78.3% from 2005 to 2011; P = 0.21) and NHAMCS 
(42.4% from 1997 to 2004, to 59.6% from 2005 to 2011; P = 0.030). Therefore, we 
evaluated whether our findings that PCP APCs ordered more antibiotics and referrals than 
PCP physicians in the hospital setting remained true after the surveys’ wording change 
starting in 2005. We found that although differences in referral patterns remained significant 
(18.2% among PCP APCs vs. 10.5% among PCP physicians; P < 0.001), differences in 
antibiotic use no longer were significant (47.8% among PCP APCs vs. 50.9% among PCP 
physicians; P = 0.60) in the hospital setting from 2005 to 2011.
Selecting Generalists in the Primary Care Setting by Using NAMCS and NHAMCS Data
The NAMCS provides detailed specialty data, allowing us to restrict our analysis to general, 
family, and internal medicine physicians and APCs. Although the NHAMCS does not 
provide detailed specialty information on the physician or APC, it does allow restriction of 
the analysis to “general medical clinics” as opposed to surgical or other specialty clinics. 
General medical clinics exclude most specialists who treat URIs (such as otolaryngologists), 
back pain (such as orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists, and pain 
specialists), and headache (such as neurologists and pain specialists).
To confirm that general medicine clinics excluded relevant specialists (general medical 
clinics include some other medical subspecialists), we used the NAMCS to examine all 
visits for the identified symptoms to determine the extent to which these symptoms were 
seen by specialists. Most patients presenting with back pain, headache, and URIs were 
treated by generalists, internists, and family physicians, with the rest being seen 
predominantly by orthopedic/neurosurgeons; neurologists; and ear, nose, and throat 
physicians, respectively, none of whom are part of the NHAMCS general medical clinics 
(rather, they are part of “surgical” and “other” clinics).
Results
Subcategory Analysis
Findings in the subcategory analysis were not substantively different from our main results, 
with few exceptions (see Appendix Tables 3 to 6 for details). For example, nurse

 practitioners seeing patients alongside physicians were less likely to order antibiotics (with 
multivariable-adjusted rates of 27.3% vs. 49.2%; P = 0.034) than physicians alone in the 
office-based setting (Appendix Table 5). However, nurse practitioners seeing patients 
alongside physicians were more likely to refer patients to other physicians (multivariable-
adjusted rates of 23.5% vs. 14.8%; P = 0.044) than physicians in the hospital-based setting 
(Appendix Table 6).
Practice Setting Sensitivity Analyses
Adding the practice setting variable to our NAMCS multivariable models did not change our 
results, and interacting practice setting with APC provider in our NAMCS subset revealed 
no significant findings, suggesting that practice setting in the NAMCS was not associated 
with differences in provider behavior. In addition, when we evaluated physician practices or 
hospitals in which nurse practitioners and physician assistants predominantly practiced 
independently (Appendix Table 7; see columns for “Nurse Practitioners: Always Alone” and 
“Physician Assistants: Always Alone”), our findings were consistent with our overall results, 
with few exceptions. For example, physician assistants who predominantly see patients 
alone ordered antibiotics more frequently than physicians practicing alone (71.6% vs. 
49.1%; P = 0.020).
We note, however, that these subanalyses are imperfect because of small sample sizes, and 
we remain concerned about multiple testing and potential bias in creating these categories. 
Hence, we limit these results to the Appendix.

*Values are sample numerator/sample denominator (percentages). Boldface values indicate comparisons with P < 0.05. Of 
note, categories are created on the basis of whether there are at least 4 observations occurring with each physician 
(NAMCS) or hospital (NHAMCS) clinic. The cutoff of 4 was chosen because it represents the median number of advanced 
practice clinician providers in each provider setting. For example, if a physician or hospital has >4 visits with nurse 
practitioners seeing patients alone (and 0 patients in shared visits), then this practice and its visits would fall under the first 
column (Nurse Practitioners Always Alone). Or if a practice has >4 nurse practitioner alone visits and >4 nurse practitioner 
shared visits, then we conclude that this practice allows for discretionary sharing. Also, percentages may differ from 
numerator/denominator proportion because of sample weighting. Finally, mixed-practice settings in this table occur only in 
the hospital clinic setting (NHAMCS data).
