BACKGROUND: The Physician Payments Sunshine Act,
part of the Affordable Care Act, requires pharmaceutical
and medical device firms to report payments they make to
physicians and, through its Open Payments program,
makes this information publicly available.
OBJECTIVE: To establish estimates of the exposure of the
American patient population to physicians who accept
industry payments, to compare these population-based
estimates to physician-based estimates of industry con-
tact, and to investigate Americans’ awareness of industry
payments.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in late
September and early October 2014, with data linkage of
respondents’ physicians to Open Payments data.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3542 adults drawn from a
large, nationally representative household panel.
MAIN MEASURES: Respondents’ contact with physicians
reported in Open Payments to have received industry pay-
ments; respondents’ awareness that physicians receive
payments from industry and that payment information is
publicly available; respondents’ knowledge of whether
their own physician received industry payments.
KEY RESULTS: Among the 1987 respondents who could
be matched to a specific physician, 65% saw a physician
who had received an industry payment during the previ-
ous 12 months. This population-based estimate of expo-
sure to industry contact is much higher than physician-
based estimates from the same period, which indicate that
41% of physicians received an industry payment. Across
the six most frequently visited specialties, patient contact
with physicians who had received an industry payment
ranged from 60 to 85%; the percentage of physicians with
industry contact in these specialties was much lower (35–
56%). Only 12% of survey respondents knew that payment
information was publicly available, and only 5% knew
whether their own doctor had received payments.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients’ contact with physicians who
receive industry payments is more prevalent than
physician-based measures of industry contact would sug-
gest. Very few Americans know whether their own doctor
has received industry payments or are aware that pay-
ment information is publicly available.
KEY WORDS: financial conflicts of interest; physician-industry
relationships; industry payments; physician payments sunshine act;
open payments.

INTRODUCTION
As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA), pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers
are now required to report gifts and payments that they make
to health care providers. In particular, in a section known as the
Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the law states that begin-
ning August 2013, manufacturers must regularly report to the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) payments
and transfers of value that they make to physicians.1,2 CMS
makes this information available to the public through its
Open Payments website.3
This legal provision was motivated in part by concerns that
industry payments could lead physicians to make decisions
that were not in the best interest of their patients, and that
patients ought to be able to choose physicians and make
medical decisions with this knowledge about industry pay-
ments in mind.1,2,4 The impact of the Sunshine Act, however,
will depend on how aware Americans are of the prevalence of
industry payments, whether their own physicians receive pay-
ments, and potential biasing effects of these payments.5–14 In
addition to affecting patient decision-making, public disclo-
sure of payments could also deter physicians from accepting
payments from industry.2,15 Accurately estimating the scope
and scale of industry payments and monitoring the effects of
payment disclosure will be important as CMS refines imple-
mentation of its Open Payments reporting system.

 Previous research on the prevalence of physician payments
has relied on surveys of physicians, or more recently—with the
availability of Open Payments and state-mandated disclosure of
industry payments—estimates of the percentage of physicians
reported as having received payments. A 2004 survey of phy-
sicians in six specialties found high rates of self-reported indus-
try contact; 84% of physicians reported, for example, having
received free food and drink.16 More recent studies using Open
Payments data have found the prevalence of industry payments
among physicians to be around 40%, with variation across
specialties ranging from 20% (pathology) to 80–90% (cardiol-
ogy and orthopaedics).17–22
These estimates provide information about industry contact
among physicians, but may give a partial or misleading picture
of the reach of industry payments in relation to patients. As
Figure 1 schematically illustrates, even if only a minority of
physicians receive industry payments, it is possible for much
higher percentages of patients to be regularly exposed to
physicians who receive these payments. This could happen if
physicians who accept industry payments care for more pa-
tients than those who do not accept payments, or if patients
frequently visit physicians in specialties that have more indus-
try contact, even though these specialists constitute a small
part of the medical profession. Distinguishing between patient
exposure to physicians with industry contact and physician
exposure to industry is important, because the reach of indus-
try influence in clinical care could be much greater than the
prevalence of payments among physicians would suggest.
To our knowledge, no studies have taken a population-
based approach to estimating the reach of industry payments.
To investigate patient-level exposure and gather background
information on patients’ knowledge of industry payments, we
fielded a nationally representative survey of Americans shortly
before the first release of the Open Payments data in
September 2014. We asked respondents about their awareness
of and knowledge about industry payments, and about the
physician they saw most frequently during the previous
12 months. We linked these named physicians to the newly
released Open Payments data to ascertain how frequently
patients saw physicians who accepted industry payments.
We then compared patient-based industry exposure measures
to physician-based measures.
This survey of American adults provides information on
patient-level exposure to physicians who accept industry pay-
ments and describes Americans’ awareness of industry pay-
ments. Because it was fielded shortly before the Open
Payments data release, the survey also establishes baseline
estimates of the reach of industry payments in the US popula-
tion prior to the public dissemination of payment information.
METHODS
Sample
A sample of 7718 adults aged 18 and older residing in the USA
was selected from KnowledgePanel® (KP), a large, nationally
representative household panel (including non-Internet house-
holds) maintained by the research firm GfK. Details on survey
methodology are provided in online Appendices S1 and S2.
The study protocol was reviewed by the Colorado Multiple
Institutional Review Board.
Survey Design
GfK administered a 6-min online survey. Respondents were
asked about their knowledge of industry payments in general,
whether they were aware this information was publicly avail-
able, and if they knew whether the physician they had seen
most frequently during the past 12 months (who they were
asked to name) had received industry payments. GfK provided
information, collected within the previous 6 months, on re-
spondents’ sociodemographic and self-reported health
characteristics.
Survey Fielding
Surveys were fielded in late September and early October
2014. Almost all surveys (94%) were completed by the
Open Payments data release date of September 30, 2014.
Physician Matching
In the survey, approximately 84% of respondents (2972/3542)
named a specific health care provider that they had seen most
frequently in the past 12 months. Using manual matching and
probabilistic matching algorithms (details in online
Appendix S1), we matched named providers to those assigned
a National Provider Identifier (NPI) and listed in the CMS
National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).
Combined, the two algorithms were able to match 1971
Figure 1 Industry reach among patients versus industry reach
among physicians.

JGIM
 physicians named by 1987 respondents (some respondents
named the same physician). Overall, 66% of the 3542 respon-
dents could be matched to an NPI-registered provider and 56%
could be matched to an NPI-registered physician. We call the
subgroup of respondents with matched physicians our verified
sample.
Open Payments Data
Using NPI identifiers, we then matched the physicians
named by respondents to providers reported to have re-
ceived payments in the Open Payments system. We fo-
cused on the subset of payments classified as "general
payments," which included payments related to consulting,
education, entertainment, food and beverage, gifts, hono-
raria, royalties or licenses, serving as faculty or speaker in
continuing education or other programs, and travel and
lodging.
Because respondents were asked about the doctor they had
seen most frequently in the past 12 months, we focused on
payments made to providers between September 1, 2013 and
August 30, 2014, the 12-month period preceding the survey.
Physician-Based Measures of Industry Contact
To measure physician contact with industry, we calculated
the percentage of physicians overall and in each of six
major specialties—family medicine, internal medicine, ob-
stetrics and gynecology, orthopaedic surgery, pediatrics,
and psychiatry and neurology—who had been reported in
Open Payments to have received an industry payment
between September 1, 2013, and August 30, 2014. The
total number of physicians (overall and in each specialty)
was obtained from counts of physicians listed in the
NPPES NPI Registry.
Statistical Analysis
We used bivariate analyses to examine associations between
respondent characteristics and (1) awareness of industry pay-
ments, and (2) whether the respondent’s named physician had
received an industry payment. Respondent characteristics in-
cluded sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, educa-
tion, race/ethnicity, household income, whether they resided in
an urban area and/or a Sunshine state, employment status, and
type of health insurance), and health status (previous diag-
noses of chronic conditions, cancer, stroke or heart attack,
or mental health disorders). All analyses used GfK-
constructed weights that adjusted for non-coverage, nonre-
sponse, and oversampling. Because of the weighting, we
applied the Rao-Scott correction of the χ2 statistic to test
for independence. To account for multiple testing of 13
respondent characteristics, we report the Bonferroni cor-
rection for statistical significance at α = 0.01 and α = 0.05.
All analyses were conducted using Stata 14 software
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The survey completion rate was 45.9% (3542/7718), higher
than average for web and telephone public opinion surveys
and within the norm for paper-based surveys.23–25 Table 1
presents weighted and unweighted sample characteristics. In
the remainder of the paper, we report weighted results unless
otherwise specified.
Physician-Based vs. Population-Based
Estimates of Industry Payments Reach
Figure 2 shows the percentage of physicians, among all
NPI-registered physicians, reported in Open Payments to
have received industry payments in the past year, com-
pared to the percentage of survey respondents whose
physician was reported in Open Payments. Consistent
with previous studies using physician-based measures,
41% of physicians had received an industry payment of
some type. Yet in the survey subgroup for which we could
verify physician identity (Bverified sample^), a higher
proportion—about 65%—of respondents had seen a phy-
sician who had accepted an industry payment.
We also compared industry contact measures for various
medical specialties. Figure 2 reports population-based and
physician-based industry contact measures for the six special-
ty areas most frequently encountered by survey respondents.
In the most frequently visited specialty, family practice, 42%
of NPI-registered physicians had received industry payments,
but 63% of verified sample respondents who had seen a family
medicine physician saw a doctor who had received payments.
Forty-seven percent of physicians specializing in obstetrics
and gynecology had received payments, but almost double
that percentage—77%—of respondents who named an
obstetrician/gynecologist as their most frequently visited phy-
sician named a doctor who had received payments. This
pattern of patient exposure to higher levels of industry pay-
ments compared to physician-based measures of industry pay-
ments is consistent across all of the major specialties.
Median industry payment amounts were higher among
physicians identified by survey respondents than among all
physicians listed in Open Payments (Table 2). Across all
specialties, the median payment received by physicians named
by respondents was more than 2.5 times as high as the median
among all Open Payments physicians ($510 vs. $193).
Similarly, for the six specialties most frequently visited by
survey respondents, the median payment amounts received
by physicians named by respondents were higher than the
median amounts received among all Open Payments physi-
cians in these same specialties. Thus, the physicians that
patients frequently visited were more likely to have received
industry payments and, when they received payments, re-
ceived amounts greater than were typical of physicians report-
ed in Open Payments.

 Public Awareness and Knowledge of Industry
Payments
Despite respondents’ extensive contact with physicians who
received industry payments, public awareness of industry
payments was limited. Overall, 45% of respondents reported
that they were aware of industry payments being made to
physicians. Twelve percent were aware that payment informa-
tion was publicly available. Only 5% of respondents reported
knowing whether their own doctor had received payments.
We compared actual Open Payments data with respondents’
beliefs about payments their doctors had received. Among the
74 (of 3542) respondents who reported knowing whether their
doctor had received payments and provided a physician’s
name that we could verify, most (70% unweighted) believed
that their doctor had not received payments in the past
12 months. Of these, 41% were incorrect in that belief: Open
Payments data indicated that their physician had actually
accepted an industry payment.
Bivariate Analyses of Public Awareness
and Physician Receipt of Payments
In Table 3, we report results from bivariate analyses examining
relationships between respondent characteristics and the pro-
portion of respondents who were aware of industry payments
(second column), and whether their physician had received an
industry payment (fourth column). Because we conducted 13
different comparisons, the appropriate p values—Bonferroni-
corrected for multiple comparisons—are 0.0008 for α = 0.01
and 0.0038 for α = 0.05.
Respondents with more education and higher income were
more likely to be aware of physician payments than those with
lower education and income (p < 0.0001 for both). Individuals
who had been diagnosed with chronic conditions or cancer
were significantly more likely to be aware of physician pay-
ments (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively). In addition,
respondents living in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Vermont–
states that had pre-existing laws requiring public disclosure of
physician payments (BSunshine states^)– had a greater aware-
ness of physician payments (58% vs. 47%, p < 0.0001).
In contrast, there were few significant bivariate associations
between respondents’ demographic or health characteristics
and whether their physician had received industry payments.
We did find, however, that a far lower percentage of respon-
dents in Sunshine states reported seeing a physician who
received payments, compared to respondents in non-
Sunshine states (34% vs. 66%, p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
About two thirds of American adults in our national survey
saw a physician in 2013–2014 who had accepted payments
from industry within the past year, indicating that the reach of
industry payments into patient care is extensive.

 To our knowledge, this is the first nationally representative
study examining the prevalence of industry payments among
the general patient population. Prior studies using payment
data have calculated the percentage of physicians, overall and
by specialty, who received industry payments.17–22 Our
physician-based estimates of industry contact, based on the
percentage of physicians receiving industry payments, were
similar to those in these earlier studies, but we found that these
estimates understated the prevalence of patient contact with
industry. Although 4 of every 10 physicians had received a
payment during the 12 months under study, almost 7 of 10
respondents were seen over the same period by a physician
who had received a payment.
The physicians whom patients visited also tended to have
received unusually high payments. The median payment re-
ceived by these physicians was 1.2–2.7 times greater, depend-
ing on the specialty, than the median payment among all
physicians in Open Payments in the same specialty.
These findings suggest that although physicians who accept
industry payments are in the minority, they are caring for a
very substantial portion of America’s adult patient population.
These estimates are, moreover, likely to be an underestimate of
Americans’ exposure to doctors with industry ties. Although
we did not examine the professional or social status of recip-
ient physicians, drug and device companies tend to pursue
relationships with Bkey opinion leaders^ in medicine because
of these leaders’ potential to influence the clinical practice of
others, even those who themselves do not accept industry
payments.26 Our analysis also did not include research pay-
ments, an additional route of industry contact for physicians.
Despite the broad reach of industry payments and substan-
tial previous literature documenting patients’ interest in and
concern about their physicians’ conflicts of interest,8 few
respondents knew about the contact that their physicians had
with industry. Only 12% had heard about industry payments,
and only 5% knew whether their own doctor had received
payments. We anticipate that these percentages will increase as
Open Payments becomes more widely known and accessed.
We found that the proportion of respondents who saw phy-
sicians who received industry payments was about twice as high
in states that had not made payment data public (66%) than in
the few states that had (34%). Our cross-sectional data do not
allow us to pinpoint the causes of this difference—whether
payment disclosure affected patients’ choice of physicians,
leading them to choose physicians without industry ties, or
perhaps acted as a deterrent for some doctors, leading them to
shun industry ties—but the difference in the prevalence of
industry payments across these two types of states is striking
and will be important to monitor with the expansion of payment
disclosure at a national level.
Our study has several limitations. First, we focused on general
payments and did not include research payments, primarily be-
cause public concern about the effects of industry ties on patient
care appears to be lower for research grants than for personal
income.8 Because of this research payment exclusion, our esti-
mates should be considered a lower bound for consumer expo-
sure to physicians who accept industry payments. Second, we
used a conservative and very high threshold (see online
Appendix S1 for details) in determining whether the physicians
that respondents named were indeed a match to the physicians
reported in Open Payments. Because of this high threshold, some
physicians who may have received payments were classified as

payments in 2013–2014.

 not having received them, which may have led us to underesti-
mate the prevalence of payments. Third, our estimates were
based on our verified sample, the subgroup of respondents who
named physicians whose identity we could verify based on the
physician’s name and location. Individuals in our verified sample
were similar along many dimensions to those whose named
physicians could not be verified at our match threshold, although
our verified sample does appear to be older, sicker, wealthier, and
more likely to have health insurance (see online Appendix S1,
Table A1, for a detailed comparison of these two groups). Finally,

Pham-Kanter et al.: Public Awareness Industry Payments National Survey
JGIM
 although our survey response rate was good relative to other
consumer and web surveys, there may be nonresponse bias. In
our nonresponse analysis (online Appendix S1, Table A2), we
found that respondents were more likely to have health insurance
than nonrespondents. Most other characteristics, including edu-
cation and health status, were similar.
These findings provide a new, population-based view of the
reach of the industry. Our estimates point to a far greater
industry reach at the population level than physician-based
estimates of industry contact have suggested. They also illu-
minate the prevalence of industry payments and awareness of
industry-physician ties at the moment Open Payments became
the national standard, providing a useful baseline by which to
evaluate the law’s effects.
Our results raise important questions about what
policymakers can do to improve patients’ awareness of indus-
try payment information. Perhaps CMS, which also collects
other information on providers, could establish a one-stop
shop website where patients could view industry payments
along with other information about their providers. It could
require physicians to notify patients about this website, as they
do with privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act. Payers, who also benefit from their
patients being more knowledgeable about their doctors, could
include industry payment information in the descriptive infor-
mation they provide online about physicians in their network.
Given patients’ stated interest in this kind of information,8 it
seems important to preserve transparency initiatives like Open
Payments even if other aspects of the Affordable Care Act are
repealed.
The extent to which and the way in which patients and
providers use this information should also be investigated
more thoroughly. Some patients will want to initiate conver-
sations with their doctors, whereas others may view industry
ties as unimportant relative to other considerations. In other
areas of health care quality, such as cardiac surgery outcomes
reporting, transparency initiatives appear to have had little
effect on consumer decisions, yet have had interesting effects
on providers.27,28 How Open Payments implementation will
unfold remains to be seen, but it will—and should—be closely
watched.
