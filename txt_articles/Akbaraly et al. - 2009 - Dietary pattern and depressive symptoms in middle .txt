 Research on the association between diet and depression has
focused primarily on nutrients such as fatty acids,1–4 and nutrients
involved in the homocysteine pathway such as vitamins B6, B9 and
B12,2,5–7 with inconclusive results. Recent years have seen a move
away from analysing associations between isolated nutrients and
health to consideration of the effects of dietary patterns.8 For
example, a meta-analysis published in 2008 showed that greater
adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern (high intake of
fruits, vegetables and fish, and low intake of meat and dairy
products) was associated with a lower incidence of Parkinson’s
and Alzheimer’s diseases.9 However, the health outcomes of that
meta-analysis did not include depression and, to the best of our
knowledge, no previous prospective study has investigated the
association between dietary patterns and the occurrence of
depressive symptoms. Thus, the objective of this study was to
examine the association between dietary patterns, derived from
a
food
frequency questionnaire using
factor
analysis,
and
depression in a large British middle-aged population, the
Whitehall II study participants. We were able to control for a large
range of sociodemographic variables, health behaviours and health
parameters including chronic diseases and cognitive functioning.
Method
The target population for the Whitehall II study was all London-
based office staff, aged 35–55 years, working in 20 civil service
departments.10 Baseline screening (phase 1) took place during
1985–8 (n = 10 308), and involved a clinical examination and a
self-administered questionnaire containing sections on demo-
graphic characteristics, health, lifestyle factors, work characteristics,
social support and life events. The clinical examination included
measures of blood pressure, anthropometric and biochemical
factors, neuroendocrine function and subclinical markers of
cardiovascular disease. Subsequent phases of data collection
alternated between postal questionnaire alone – phases 2 (1989–
90), 4 (1995–6), 6 (2001) and 8 (2006) – and postal questionnaire
accompanied by a clinical examination – phases 3 (1991–3), 5
(1997–9) and 7 (2002–4). Analyses reported in this study were
restricted to the 3486 White European participants with data on
dietary patterns and all covariates at phase 5 and depression at
phase 7. Black (n = 175) and Asian (n = 331) participants were
excluded owing to differences in eating patterns.
After complete description of the study to the participants,
written informed consent was obtained; the University College
London ethics committee approved the study.
Dietary assessment at phase 5 and determination
of dietary pattern
A machine-readable Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ),11
based on the one used in the US Nurses Health Study,12 was sent
to the participants. The food list (127 items) from the original
questionnaire was anglicised, and foods commonly eaten in the
UK were added.13 A common unit or portion size for each food
was specified, and participants were asked how often, on average,
they had consumed that amount of the item during the previous
year. Response to all items was on a nine-point scale, ranging from
‘never, or less than once per month’ to ‘six or more times per day’.
The selected frequency category for each food item was converted
to a daily intake.
According to nutrient profile and culinary use of food items,
the 127 items of the FFQ were grouped into 37 predefined food
groups by adding food items within each group (online Table
DS1).14
Dietary

Background
Studies of diet and depression have focused primarily on
individual nutrients.
Aims
To examine the association between dietary patterns and
depression using an overall diet approach.
Method
Analyses were carried on data from 3486 participants
(26.2% women, mean age 55.6 years) from the
Whitehall II prospective cohort, in which two dietary
patterns were identified: ‘whole food’ (heavily loaded
by vegetables, fruits and fish) and ‘processed food’
(heavily loaded by sweetened desserts, fried food,
processed meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy
products). Self-reported depression was assessed 5 years
later using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression
(CES–D) scale.
Results
After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the
highest tertile of the whole food pattern had lower odds of
CES–D depression (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.99) than those in
the lowest tertile. In contrast, high consumption of processed
food was associated with an increased odds of CES–D
depression (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.11–2.23).
Conclusions
In middle-aged participants, a processed food dietary pattern
is a risk factor for CES–D depression 5 years later, whereas a
whole food pattern is protective.

 interpretability. Two dietary patterns were identified using multi-
ple criteria: the diagram of eigenvalues, the scree plot, the inter-
pretability
of
the
factors
and
the
percentage
of
variance
explained by the factors (online Table DS2). The factor score for
each pattern was calculated by summing intakes of all food groups
weighted by their factor loadings. Factor loadings represent corre-
lation coefficients between the food groups and the dietary
pattern. The first pattern was heavily loaded by high intake of
vegetables, fruits and fish, labelled the ‘whole food’ pattern. The
second pattern, labelled ‘processed food’, was heavily loaded by
high consumption of sweetened desserts, chocolates, fried food,
processed meat, pies, refined grains, high-fat dairy products and
condiments. Each participant received a factor score for each iden-
tified pattern. Factor analysis does not group individuals into
clusters; instead, all individuals contribute to both factors and it
is the homogeneity between food items that defines the factors.
The validity and the reliability of this version of the FFQ in terms
of nutrient and food consumption have been documented in
detail both in our cohort and in another UK cohort.11,13 To assess
the validity of the dietary patterns resulting from this a posteriori
food grouping, we reran the principal component analyses using
the 127 individual food items, with similar results.
Depression measurement at phase 7
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression scale (CES–D)
is a short self-report scale designed to measure depressive
symptoms in the general population.15 The 20 items of the scale
measure symptoms associated with depression and have been
validated against longer scales.15 Participants were asked to score
the frequency of occurrence of specific symptoms during the
previous week on a four-point scale (0, ‘less than 1 day’; 1, ‘1–2
days’; 2, ‘3–4 days’; and 3, ‘5–7 days’). These were summed to
yield a total score between 0 and 60. Participants scoring more
than 15 were categorised as cases of CES–D depression.15
Covariates at phase 5
Sociodemographic variables
Sociodemographic variables consisted of age, gender, marital
status, employment grade and education. The British civil service
employment grade, defined on the basis of salary, social status and
level of responsibility, consisted of three levels, with grade 1
representing the highest level and grade 3 the lowest. Highest
educational attainment was grouped into five levels (no academic
qualification,
lower
secondary
education,
higher
secondary
education, university degree, higher university degree).
Health behaviours
Health behaviours measured were smoking (non-smoker, former
smoker, current smoker) and physical activity, converted to
metabolic equivalent (MET) scores,16 categorised as ‘mildly
energetic’ (MET values below 3), ‘moderately energetic’ (MET
values ranging from 3 to 6) and ‘vigorous’ (MET values of 6 or
above) physical activity.
Health status
Health status was ascertained using a number of measures:
prevalence of coronary heart disease, based on clinically verified
events, including non-fatal myocardial infarction and definite
angina; self-reported stroke or transient ischaemic attack; diabetes
(defined by a fasting glucose 57.0 mmol/l or a 2-hour post-load
glucose 511.1 mmol/l or reported doctor diagnosed diabetes or
use of diabetes medication);17 hypertension (systolic or diastolic
blood pressure 5140 mmHg or 590 mmHg respectively, or use
of hypertensive drugs); use of antidepressants; and cognitive func-
tioning assessed by the Alice Heim reasoning test 4–I,18 a series of
65 verbal and mathematical reasoning items of increasing diffi-
culty: low cognitive score was defined as a performance in the low-
est quintile. For sensitivity analyses we used the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ),19 assessed at both phase 3 and phase 5 of
the study, which captured common mental disorders and included
the four-item depression subscale. All items were scored from 0 to
3 and then summed; cut-off points of 4 out of 12 were used to
identify depression cases.
Statistical analysis
Neither natural thresholds nor clinically based thresholds are
defined for the factor score measures of the two dietary patterns.
We divided both scores into thirds based on their distribution in
order to allow a robust estimation of self-reported depression
across levels of dietary patterns that was not driven by extreme
values. Logistic regression was used to model the association
between the tertiles of the two dietary patterns and CES–D
depression. In the first model the analyses were adjusted for age,
gender and energy intake; in the second model they were also
adjusted for employment grade, educational level, marital status,
smoking and physical activity; and in the final model the analyses
were further adjusted for health measures. Interactions between
each dietary pattern and the covariates were tested and were found
not to be statistically significant. To examine whether the
association between dietary pattern and CES–D depression was
robust, we ran two sensitivity analyses, the first adjusting for
additional covariates such as dyslipidaemia (low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol 54.1 mmol/l or use of lipid-lowering drugs)
and body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) in a subsample for whom
these data were available, and the second excluding individuals
receiving antidepressive treatment or who had GHQ-defined
depression at phase 5. All analyses were conducted using SAS
software (version 9.1 for Windows).
Results
Compared with the 6943 individuals still alive at phase 7, the 3486
participants included in the analyses were more likely to be men
(73.8% v. 66.7%), and less likely to be in the low occupational
grade (8.3% v. 18.0%) or have no academic qualification (8.0%
v. 10.0%). A total of 5990 individuals had a CES–D assessment
at phase 7; compared with those excluded from the analyses, the
prevalence of CES–D depression was lower in our study sample
(11.9%
v.
19.2%).
Concerning
dietary
habits,
participants
included in analyses were more likely to be in the highest tertile
of both whole food and processed food dietary patterns. At phase
7, a total of 416 participants were categorised as CES–D cases
(score 415). Characteristics of the participants as a function of
the presence of CES–D depression are presented in Table 1.
Factors associated with tertiles of the two dietary patterns (whole
food and processed food) at phase 5 are shown in Table 2.
Table 3 shows the association between the two dietary pattern
scores categorised in tertiles at phase 5 and CES–D depression at
phase 7. Participants with the highest intake of whole food were
less likely to report CES–D depression: OR = 0.64 (95% CI 0.49–
0.83)
after
adjusting
for
age,
gender
and
energy
intake
(model 1). This association was not much attenuated after
adjustment for all covariates (model 3): OR = 0.74 (95% CI
0.56–0.99). In contrast, in the fully adjusted analyses participants
with a high intake of processed food had higher odds of CES–D
depression
compared
with
those
with
the
lowest
intake:
OR = 1.58 (95% CI 1.11–2.23).

Sensitivity analyses
Additional analyses were undertaken on a subsample with data on
BMI and dyslipidaemia (n = 2702) at phase 5. Among them, 323
participants had CES–D depression at phase 7. High whole food
intake at phase 5 remained associated with lower odds of
subsequent CES–D depression at phase 7 (OR = 0.75, 95% CI
0.54–1.03),
whereas
participants
with
high
processed
food
scores had higher odds of CES–D depression (OR = 1.76, 95%
CI 1.19–2.62) after adjustment for all potential confounders,
including BMI and dyslipidaemia.
In an attempt to elucidate whether the association shown in
Table 3 was due to an effect of diet on depression and not the
reverse, the analysis was repeated after excluding the 427 parti-
cipants who identified themselves as having depression at phase 5.
As CES–D scores were not available at phase 5, self-reported
depression was identified on the basis of a score of 4 or more
on the GHQ depression subscale (n = 374) or reported anti-
depressant treatment (n = 81). As can be seen in Table 4, among
the remaining 3059 individuals of whom 265 had CES–D
depression at phase 7, the results are comparable to those reported
in Table 3, reinforcing our original observation that poor diet is a
risk factor for self-reported depression.
A further test of the reverse causality hypothesis examined
GHQ depression at phase 3 (n = 397) as a predictor of dietary
pattern at phase 5. We found no evidence (P = 0.24 for the whole
food pattern and P = 0.92 for the processed food pattern) to
suggest that dietary patterns at phase 5 were worse among
participants who met criteria for GHQ depression at phase 3.
Discussion
We examined associations between two distinct dietary patterns,
whole food (rich in fruit, vegetables and fish) and processed food
(rich in processed meat, chocolates, sweet desserts, fried food,
refined
cereals
and
high-fat
dairy
products),
and
CES–D
depression 5 years later in a middle-aged population. The whole
food pattern was associated with lower odds of subsequent
CES–D depression and the processed food pattern with higher
odds of CES–D depression. These associations were robust to
adjustments for a range of health parameters and behavioural
factors. Dietary patterns have been investigated in relation to
many health outcomes, but the research on depression has mostly
focused on the risk of depression associated with single nutrients.
Our results suggest a protective effect of an overall diet rich in
fruits, vegetables and fish, whereas an overall diet rich in processed
meat, chocolates, sweetened desserts, fried food, refined cereals
and
high-fat
dairy
products
seems
to
be
deleterious
for
depression. These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis

 Diet and depressive symptoms
showing that adherence to a diet characterised by a high intake of
fruits, vegetables and fish and a low intake of meat and dairy
products (‘Mediterranean’ diet) was associated with lower overall
mortality, lower mortality from cancer and cardiovascular disease,
and lower incidence of neurodegenerative diseases.9
Plausible mechanisms
There are several plausible mechanisms underlying the association
we observed between the whole food pattern and self-reported
depression. The high content of antioxidants in fruits and
vegetables could be protective,20 as some studies have shown
higher antioxidant levels to be associated with lower depression
risk.21 The potential protective effect of the whole food diet could
also come from folate found in large amounts in some cruciferous
vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts), leafy vegetables
(spinach), other green vegetables (asparagus, avocado) and dried
legumes (lentil, chickpea).22 It has been suggested that low levels
of folate might increase the risk of depression and result in
reduced availability of S-adenosylmethionine, a universal methyl
donor, which can result in impaired formation of myelin, neuro-
transmitters and membrane phospholipids.23 In line with this, a
large study of Finnish middle-aged men found an increased risk
of depression in participants with lower dietary intake of folate.7
However, some studies have found no association between folate
levels and depression in elderly populations.6 A further plausible
mechanism involves fish consumption. The whole food dietary
pattern includes a high intake of fish and there is evidence
suggesting an association between high levels of fish consumption
and low incidence of depression.24 This protective effect of fish
consumption has been traditionally attributed to its high content
of long-chain o-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.25 These are a
major component of neuron membranes and have vascular and
anti-inflammatory properties. Evidence of this association has
come from observational studies that have shown an inverse
association between o-3 fatty acid levels measured in blood or
estimated from intake and depression.3,4 Finally, it is also possible
that the protective effect of diet on depression comes from the
cumulative and synergic effect of nutrients from different sources
of foods rather than from the effect of one isolated nutrient.
The deleterious effect of processed food on self-reported
depression is a novel finding. A previous cross-sectional study
has shown a correlation between sugar consumption and the
annual rate of depression in six countries.26 Furthermore, the
processed food diet is very close to the ‘Western’ pattern defined
in the American population,8 which has been shown to be
associated with higher risk of coronary heart disease and
inflammation.8,27 Several lines of investigation have suggested that
coronary heart disease and inflammation are involved in the
pathogenesis of depression.28,29 However, further studies are
needed to improve our understanding of the association between
processed food intake, the inflammation process and depression.
Limitations of the study
There are several limitations to our study. First, reverse causation
– with depression affecting the dietary pattern rather than the
other way around – remains an alternative interpretation of the

observed associations. To test this issue, we undertook sensitivity
analyses and found no significant association between previous re-
ports of depression (phase 3, 1991–3) using the GHQ depression
subscale and dietary patterns assessed 6 years later. This suggests
that depression did not predict dietary behaviour in our study.
Furthermore, we also showed that our main finding – the associa-
tion between dietary patterns (phase 5, 1997–9) and CES–D
depression at phase 7 (2002–4) – remains significant after
excluding participants who reported depression at phase 5,
assessed using the GHQ depression subscale and report of anti-
depressant treatment. We were not able to use the CES–D to
exclude prior depression as it was only introduced at phase 7 of
the study. Even if the use of different tools to assess self-reported
depression may decrease sensitivity of these analyses, results using
the GHQ to exclude participants with prior depression show that
the estimates of the association between dietary patterns and
subsequent CES–D depression were similar to those reported in
this paper. Thus, reverse causation seems an unlikely explanation
for our findings.
Second, some bias owing to selective retention of participants
is possible as we found socioeconomic position, depression and
dietary patterns to be associated with the likelihood of being
included in the analyses. If anything, this could contribute to an
overestimation of the association between a whole food pattern
and self-reported depression on account of the overrepresentation
of individuals without depression who follow a health-conscious
diet.
Third, is the use of a semi-quantitative food questionnaire
that only covered specific foods and is recognised to be less precise
than dietary assessment by diary questionnaire. However, we have
shown previously in this study population that nutrient intake
estimated by the FFQ method is well correlated with biomarker
levels and with intake estimates from the generally more accurate
7-day diary.11 The factor analyses approach used to identify these
patterns involves several arbitrary decisions, such as the consolida-
tion of food items into food groups, the number of factors
extracted, the methods of rotation and the labelling of the factors.
However, the two major eating patterns identified – the whole
food and processed food diets – were similar to the ‘prudent’
and Western patterns determined in large American prospective
cohorts.8
Fourth, the study participants were mainly office-based civil
servants, not fully representative of the British population, and
analyses were restricted to White participants, which may limit
the generalisability of the findings. Finally, we cannot exclude
the possibility of residual confounding in the analysis due to
unmeasured or imprecisely measured factors. It is possible, for
example, that a healthy diet is only one component of an overall
healthy lifestyle which affords protection against depression.
However, the effects of dietary patterns on depressive symptoms
did not substantially attenuate after adjustment for other
indicators of a healthy lifestyle, such as smoking, physical activity
and body mass, and a range of other potential confounders. This
provides evidence against the interpretation that we have found a
spurious association that is simply a by-product of an overall
healthy lifestyle.
Diet pattern and depression
Despite these limitations, our study is unique in expanding
the focus in this field of research from single nutrients and
single foods to overall diet patterns. Our study provides evidence
of a robust association between two dietary patterns, the whole
food and the processed food patterns, and depressive symptoms
in a large prospective cohort of White, middle-aged British
participants. The results suggest that consumption of fruits,
vegetables and fish affords protection against the onset of
depressive symptoms 5 years later, whereas a diet rich in processed
meat, chocolates, sweet desserts, fried food, refined cereals and
high-fat dairy products increases vulnerability. These findings
suggest
that
existing
healthy
eating
policies
will
generate
additional benefits to health and well-being, and that diet should
be considered as a potential target for the prevention of depressive
disorders.
