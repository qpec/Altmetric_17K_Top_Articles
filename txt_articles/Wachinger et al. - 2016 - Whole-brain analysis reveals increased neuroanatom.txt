Structural magnetic resonance imaging data are frequently analysed to reveal morphological changes of the human brain in dementia.
Most contemporary imaging biomarkers are scalar values, such as the volume of a structure, and may miss the localized morpho-
logical variation of early presymptomatic disease progression. Neuroanatomical shape descriptors, however, can represent complex
geometric information of individual anatomical regions and may demonstrate increased sensitivity in association studies. Yet, they
remain largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce a novel technique to study shape asymmetries of neuroanatomical structures
across subcortical and cortical brain regions. We demonstrate that neurodegeneration of subcortical structures in Alzheimer’s disease
is not symmetric. The hippocampus shows a significant increase in asymmetry longitudinally and both hippocampus and amygdala
show a significantly higher asymmetry cross-sectionally concurrent with disease severity above and beyond an ageing effect. Our
results further suggest that the asymmetry in these structures is undirectional and that primarily the anterior hippocampus becomes
asymmetric. Based on longitudinal asymmetry measures we subsequently study the progression from mild cognitive impairment to
dementia, demonstrating that shape asymmetry in hippocampus, amygdala, caudate and cortex is predictive of disease onset. The
same analyses on scalar volume measurements did not produce any significant results, indicating that shape asymmetries, potentially
induced by morphometric changes in subnuclei, rather than size asymmetries are associated with disease progression and can yield a
powerful imaging biomarker for the early presymptomatic classification and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease. Because literature has
focused on contralateral volume differences, subcortical disease lateralization may have been overlooked thus far.

 Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia
with incidence rates further increasing in the future due to
increasing life expectancy. Currently approved treatments
for Alzheimer’s disease relieve symptoms but do not
target the underlying causes of the disease. It is expected
that new treatment options will become available in the
future that directly interfere with disease pathways (e.g.
the amyloid cascade). Such treatment, however, requires
the early identification of individuals with an elevated risk
for developing dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
is associated with isolated memory loss, a common precur-
sor to dementia in Alzheimer’s disease. The neuropatho-
logical substrates of MCI are heterogeneous (Schneider
et al., 2009) and, despite the high rate of progression to
Alzheimer’s disease, a significant number of patients with
MCI remain stable (Petersen et al., 2009). A more accurate
prediction of the likelihood for progression and the early
detection of the disease requires a better understanding of
disease trajectories. Longitudinal neuroimaging provides
unique opportunities for studying trajectories because the
measured atrophy correlates with neuron loss; imaging can
therefore indicate the onset of the impairment in close tem-
poral proximity (Jack et al., 2013).
A key aspect for studying dementia trajectories is to map
the spatial atrophy pattern across time. Early on, 18F-fluor-
odeoxyglucose PET indicated significant right/left and fron-
tal/parietal
metabolic
asymmetries
in
mild
Alzheimer’s
disease (Grady et al., 1988; Haxby et al., 1990). This
in vivo pattern of hypometabolism is found in the vast
majority of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease patients
and in over 85% of pathologically confirmed Alzheimer’s
disease cases (Silverman et al., 2001). Furthermore, as
Alzheimer’s disease progresses, right/left asymmetries are
directionally stable and become more pronounced with
time (Haxby et al., 1990). Recent PET studies with
11C-Pittsburgh compound B showed an asymmetric spatial
distribution of amyloid-b and the positive correlation be-
tween asymmetries in amyloid-b deposition and hypometa-
bolism (Frings et al., 2015). Interestingly, disease severity
was neither related to asymmetries of amyloid-b load nor
to hypometabolism, suggesting that lateralization of path-
ology and neurodegeneration is not confined to disease
onset, but a core feature throughout disease stages. The
asymmetry in Alzheimer’s disease was further confirmed
in histopathological data (Stefanits et al., 2012). On MRI,
it was demonstrated that cortical atrophy occurred earlier
and progressed faster in the left hemisphere than in the
right in Alzheimer’s disease patients (Thompson et al.,
2007; Long et al., 2013). For subcortical structures the
effect of the progression of Alzheimer’s disease on anatom-
ical asymmetry has only been investigated for the hippo-
campus and is less clear. Fox et al. (1996) reported an
asymmetrical atrophy of the hippocampus that developed
for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, whereas more recent
studies reported a decrease or sign flip in volume asym-
metry for patients with dementia (Barnes et al., 2005; Shi
et al., 2009).
We believe that stronger anatomical asymmetries have so
far not been detected in MRI because volume measure-
ments have been used, which only provide a crude simpli-
fication of the full anatomical information. Instead, we
propose a measure of brain asymmetry that is based on
spectral shape descriptors from the BrainPrint (Wachinger
et al., 2015). Shape vectors are more sensitive to anatom-
ical variations and consequently have the potential to detect
finer localized variations, e.g. early morphological changes
in subnuclei. Different effects of Alzheimer’s disease on the
anterior versus the posterior hippocampus have, for in-
stance, been reported in Woolard and Heckers (2012),
supporting
the
assumption
of
increasing
shape
asym-
metry
without
any
substantial
volumetric
differences.
Furthermore, recent analyses on high-field MRI suggest
focal insults in the hippocampal region caused by ageing
and dementia, where the subfields subiculum and CA1 are
associated with Alzheimer’s disease and the subfields CA3
and dentate gyrus are associated with ageing (Pievani et al.,
2011; Jagust, 2013). While the subfield segmentation is
challenging due to small intensity differences between sub-
fields, low resolution of in vivo MRI and partial volume
effects, neuroanatomical shape analysis is potentially sensi-
tive to such heterogeneous changes.
Next to retaining more geometrical information, the pro-
posed asymmetry measure offers several advantages: (i) it
completely avoids lateral processing bias as it works on
both hemispheres independently; (ii) it does not require
prior spatial alignment; (iii) it is not restricted to a specific
anatomical structure, supporting a brain-wide analysis; and
(iv) it presents a within-subject measure that identifies dir-
ectional and undirectional asymmetry. Directional asym-
metry
refers
to
hemispheric
differences
that
show
a
stronger effect on one of the hemispheres, e.g. higher
changes on the left than on the right. Undirectional asym-
metry does not have a consistent hemispheric effect and
therefore refers to the magnitude of asymmetry independent
of direction. Our results suggest a strong increase in shape
asymmetry with the progression of dementia that is undir-
ectional. Alternative approaches, such as voxel-wise tech-
niques or statistical shape models compute statistics across
the population and are well suited for measuring direc-
tional asymmetry, but they cannot detect undirectional
asymmetry. We believe that the sensitive representation of
geometry together with ability to identify undirectional
asymmetry are key aspects for revealing increased asymme-
tries with the progression of dementia.
Longitudinal trajectories during

To derive disease trajectories of brain asymmetry, indivi-
duals should be ideally followed for the full time period of

 interest. This, however, creates numerous practical pro-
blems
related
to
technology,
funding,
and
logistics
(Thompson et al., 2011). One possible alternative is to
use cross-sectional designs, but they can confound within-
and
between-individual
variation
(Schaie
and
Caskie,
2005). This is especially problematic for neurodegenerative
diseases where premature dropout may be caused by
advanced disease progression. The unstructured multi-
cohort longitudinal
design
in
the Alzheimer’s
Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) presents an attractive alter-
native. On the one hand, it covers a wide age range by
collecting data from multiple age cohorts. On the other
hand, it can identify within-subject effects by following
individuals longitudinally for a certain time period, which
is typically only a fraction of the total age range of the
study (Thompson et al., 2011). Here we use mixed effects
models (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2009; Thompson et al.,
2011; Fitzmaurice et al., 2012; Bernal et al., 2013) to dif-
ferentiate across- and within-individual variations in brain
asymmetry.
Survival analysis for predicting
progression to Alzheimer’s disease
In addition to the analysis of disease trajectories, we inves-
tigate whether brain asymmetry is significantly associated
with the progression of MCI patients to Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. This helps in understanding the nature of neurobiolo-
gical changes at a critical phase in the disease and in
assessing the response to treatment. Formulating the differ-
entiation
between
progressors
and
non-progressors
as
group comparison is one possibility (Chetelat et al., 2005;
Jack et al., 2008a; Cuingnet et al., 2011), but it requires the
selection of an arbitrary time frame of progression (e.g. 18
or 36 months) and it does not account for censoring or
drop-out of individuals. Survival analysis (also time-to-
event analysis) presents an appropriate statistical treatment
of the progression to Alzheimer’s disease by explicitly mod-
elling the timing of the event and by considering the finite
follow-up time. Most prior studies in neuroimaging that
apply time-to-event analysis work with time-independent
explanatory variables (Devanand et al., 2007; Marcus
et al., 2007; Geerlings et al., 2008; Desikan et al., 2009,
2010; Vemuri et al., 2011; Da et al., 2014). Such models
only use the information from a single baseline scan and do
not integrate the information from follow-up assessments in
longitudinal studies, thus ignoring valuable data. A recent
approach proposes the application of survival analysis with
time-dependent variables (Sabuncu et al., 2014) to investi-
gate hippocampal volume and cortical thickness in a mass-
univariate analysis. In contrast, here we use time-varying
shape asymmetry measures derived from the BrainPrint for
studying progression to Alzheimer’s disease. We overcome
the challenge of integrating time-dependent variables that
require observations at all event time points by using the
previously mentioned mixed effects models for inference.
Materials and methods
Overview
Figure 1 presents a graphical overview of the computation of
brain asymmetry with the BrainPrint, which is an ensemble of
shape descriptors that are computed on cortical and subcortical
structures. The Mahalanobis distance between lateralized shapes
yields the measure of shape asymmetry. Due to the holistic
representation of brain morphology in the BrainPrint, we com-
pute shape asymmetries on 11 lateralized brain structures,
which is in contrast to previous studies on shape analysis in
Alzheimer’s disease that typically focused on the hippocampus
(Ferrarini et al., 2009; Gerardin et al., 2009; Costafreda et al.,
2011; Lindberg et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2012). The extensive
characterization of neuroanatomy is a promising avenue for
diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease, considering that it is associated
with global atrophy across the entire brain (Fjell et al., 2013).
Recent results for the prediction of dementia at an international
challenge (Bron et al., 2015) indicate the potential of BrainPrint
for studying Alzheimer’s disease (Wachinger et al., 2014;
Wachinger and Reuter, 2016). BrainPrint naturally extends
the contemporary region of interest-based volume and thickness
analysis with shape information. The significance of a descrip-
tive representations of the data is highlighted by results in pat-
tern recognition suggesting that it is less the classifier but rather
the representation that primarily impacts the performance of a
predictive model (Dickinson, 2009).
The brain descriptor BrainPrint
The BrainPrint (Wachinger et al., 2015) description is based
on the automated segmentation of anatomical brain structures
with FreeSurfer (Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999;
Fischl et al., 1999a, b, 2002). Images are processed with the
longitudinal framework in FreeSurfer (Reuter et al., 2012),
which increases intraindividual measurement reliability while
avoiding potential processing bias (Reuter and Fischl, 2011).
After image segmentation, geometric representations (surface
and volumetric meshes) are extracted for the identified cortical
and subcortical structures via the marching cubes algorithm.
shapeDNA (Reuter et al., 2006) is used as the shape descriptor
of the individual structures, which performed among the best
in a comparison of methods for non-rigid 3D shape retrieval
(Lian et al., 2012). shapeDNA is based on the (normalized)
eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and, therefore,
isometry invariant (including rigid motion and reflections).
Eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator � can be com-
puted via finite element analysis by solving the Laplacian
eigenvalue problem (Helmholtz equation) on the given shape:
�f ¼ ��f
ð1Þ
The solution consists of eigenvalue �i 2 R and eigenfunction fi
pairs, sorted by eigenvalues, 0 � �1 � �2 � . . . (a positive
diverging sequence). The first l non-zero eigenvalues are com-
puted using the finite element methods and form the shape
DNA: � ¼ ð�1; . . . ; �lÞ, where we set l ¼ 50 in this study. To
achieve scale independence, we normalize the eigenvalues:

 where vol is the Riemannian volume of the D-dimensional
manifold (Reuter et al., 2006), i.e. the surface area for 2D
manifolds, or the volume for 3D solids.
A key property of the eigenvalues is their isometry invariance,
i.e. length-preserving deformations will not change the spectrum.
Isometry invariance includes rigid body motion as well as reflec-
tions and, therefore, permits the comparison of shapes across
individuals
or
hemispheres
by
directly
comparing
the
shapeDNA without any complex and potentially error-prone
image or geometry registration. A second property is that the
spectrum continuously changes with topology-preserving defor-
mations of the boundary of the object. These properties make
the shapeDNA well suited for comparing shapes, as initial align-
ment of the shapes can be completely avoided and similar shapes
will have a similar spectrum. We compute the spectra for all
subcortical structures on the 2D boundary surfaces (triangle
meshes) and for cortical structures on the full 3D solid (tetra-
hedra meshes created from white and pial surfaces), forming the
BrainPrint � ¼ ð�1; . . . ; ��Þ (Wachinger et al., 2015).
Figure 2 illustrates the first six non-constant eigenfunctions of
the hippocampus. The eigenfunctions show natural vibrations of
the shape when oscillating at a frequency specified by the square
root of the eigenvalue. For localizing shape changes of the hip-
pocampus, we use the level set analysis for the first eigenfunc-
tion as proposed for the caudate in Reuter et al. (2009).
Figure 2 illustrates level sets as green curves. We compute the
circumference of 100 level sets and average among 10 to
increase robustness to noise, yielding 10 length measurements
per hippocampus. The first eigenfunction presents a natural
parameterization of the hippocampus, which we use to localize
asymmetry by computing the difference of circumferences across
hemispheres and by computing statistics across the population.
Brain asymmetry from BrainPrint
Based on the BrainPrint, we measure the asymmetry of later-
alized brain structures. As shapeDNA is invariant to reflec-
tions, we can directly compute the Mahalanobis distance
between the descriptors of a lateralized brain structure s
Ys ¼ k �
left
s
� �
right
s
k�s;
ð3Þ
with �s the covariance matrix across all individuals for struc-
ture s (Wachinger et al., 2015). The Mahalanobis distance
accounts for the covariance pattern in the data and supports
an equal contribution of all eigenvalues in the sequence. This
approach completely avoids lateral processing bias as it works
on both hemispheres independently. Due to the pose invar-
iance of spectral shape descriptors we can directly measure
shape asymmetry by computing the distance in a symmetric
fashion—a task that can be rather involved for most other
shape representations that first require the construction of
local correspondences. In fact, choosing a target hemisphere
for
registration can potentially
bias subsequent analyses.
When both hemispheres are not treated exactly the same,
e.g. one hemisphere remains untouched while the other gets
aligned and resampled, resulting interpolation artefacts can
easily cause spurious effects (Reuter and Fischl, 2011; Reuter
et al., 2012).
The asymmetry measure presents a within-subject measure
that can identify directional and undirectional asymmetry. The
difference of eigenvalues can be used to differentiate direc-
tional and undirectional asymmetry. We compute the asymme-
try for 11 lateralized structures: cerebral white matter, pial
region, cerebellum white/grey matter, lateral ventricles, hippo-
campus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate, putamen, and accum-
bens. For white matter and pial region, the analysis is
performed on volumetric meshes.
Mixed effects models
We used linear mixed effects models (Verbeke and Molenberghs,
2009; Thompson et al., 2011; Fitzmaurice et al., 2012; Bernal
et al., 2013) to study cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of
brain asymmetry. We denote the age at baseline for individual i
with Bi, the years-from-baseline at follow-up scan j with Xij,
and the diagnosis with Di. The linear model for the lateral
shape distance Yij as dependent variable is
Yij ¼ b0 þ b1Bi þ b2Xij þ b3Di þ b0i þ b1iXij;
ð4Þ
where b0; b1; b2; b3 are fixed effects regression coefficients and
b0i; b1i are random effects regression coefficients. The random
effects enable modelling individual-specific intercept and slope

lateralized structures, e.g. the hippocampus. The computation of the shape descriptor shapeDNA yields the characteristic spectrum of the shape,

 with respect to the time from the baseline. We also consider an
extended model with the addition of the interaction between
diagnosis and years-from-baseline (Xij � Di) to Equation 4,
allowing the longitudinal slopes to vary across the different
disease groups. Furthermore, we evaluated the interactions
between diagnosis and cognitive decline as well as diagnosis
and age, but they were not significant. Similarly, a quadratic
age term was not significant and a quadratic term for years-
from-baseline in the random effect was rejected based on
model comparison with AIC (Akaike information criterion)
and BIC (Bayesian information criterion). The following addi-
tional parameters are included as fixed effects (not shown in
Equation 4): years of education, sex, intracranial volume
(ICV), and presence of an APOE4 risk allele. The linear
mixed effects model is also used for the statistical analysis of
the level sets, where the dependent variable is the absolute
difference of the circumferences of level sets between left and
right hippocampus.
To analyse regional association of cortical atrophy with
increasing hippocampal asymmetry we use a linear model for
cortical thickness Tij
Tij ¼ b0 þ b1Yij þ b2Bi þ b0i;
ð5Þ
where b0; b1; b2 are fixed effects regression coefficients for
intercept, time-varying hippocampal asymmetry Yij and base-
line age Bi of subject i. Again the fixed effects of sex, years of
education and presence of APOE4 risk allele are included (not
shown in the equation). b0i are random effects regression coef-
ficients for subject-specific offsets. The mass-univariate analysis
on the cortex is performed as described in Bernal-Rusiel et al.
(2013). P-values are false discovery rate (FDR) thresholded by
q ¼ 0:05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 2000).
Cox proportional hazards model
We use the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) for
analysing the progression to Alzheimer’s disease. Cox regres-
sion is a semi-parametric model; the baseline hazard function
is not specified and can therefore vary for each unique event
time adding flexibility. The hazard function hðtÞ represents the
instantaneous potential for an event at time t, given that no
event occurred up to time t. The classical Cox model assumes
time-independent explanatory variables and, therefore, only
relies on information from baseline scans. For integrating long-
itudinal data in the analysis, we consider an extended Cox
model that combines time-independent variables X and time-
dependent variables YðtÞ
hðt; X; YðtÞÞ ¼ h0ðtÞ � exp

;
ð6Þ
where �1; . . . ; �p are coefficients of the time-independent vari-
ables and �1; . . . ; �q are coefficients of the time-dependent vari-
ables. The baseline hazard function h0ðtÞ is not explicitly
modelled in Cox, which requires partial likelihood maximiza-
tion for inferring the model coefficients. In contrast, parametric
hazard regression models can employ the more efficient max-
imum-likelihood estimates but involve making potentially arbi-
trary assumptions about the baseline hazard. With the Cox
model, we account for left truncation and right censoring of
the data.
As noted by Sabuncu et al. (2014), the fundamental chal-
lenge for using longitudinal data in a Cox regression model
with time-dependent variables is the necessity to observe all
time-dependent variables at each event time. Event times are
all time points where events occur across the entire population.
Consequently, we require observations for an individual at all
event times until he or she experiences the event or is censored.
However, scans are not available for all event times in typical
longitudinal neuroimaging studies. We therefore need to esti-
mate the imaging markers at times of the clinical events, for
which we use the mixed effects models. The improvement of
using mixed effects models for Cox regression in comparison
to line fitting is described in Sabuncu et al. (2014).
For the Cox proportional hazards model in Equation 6, we
include the following time-independent covariates: baseline
age, sex, ICV, APOE genotype status (true if carrier of e4

 risk allele), and education. Time-varying variables are years-
from-baseline and lateral asymmetry. Testing the proportional
hazards assumption using Schoenfeld’s residuals results in a
significant violation for APOE4 (P 5 0.05). We add the inter-
action between APOE4 and years-from-baseline to resolve the
violation. This interaction is supported by the assumption that
APOE4 accelerates atrophy during the prodromal phases of
Alzheimer’s disease (Jack et al., 2008b) and has also been
added in Sabuncu et al. (2014).
ADNI data
We use data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI, adni.loni.usc.edu), which was launched in
2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National
Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB),
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceu-
tical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million,
5-year public–private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI
has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological
markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can
be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early
Alzheimer’s disease. Determination of sensitive and specific
markers of very early Alzheimer’s disease progression is
intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treat-
ments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the
time and cost of clinical trials. The principal investigator of
this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center
and University of California, San Francisco. ADNI is the result
of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of
academic institutions and private corporations, and individuals
have been recruited from over 50 sites across the USA and
Canada. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in
the protocol for ADNI. For up-to-date information, see www.

Results
Within- and across-individual changes
in asymmetry
Cases with at least three scans are selected from the ADNI
cohort, yielding n = 697 individuals with summary statistics
listed in Supplementary Table 1.
We use a mixed effects model that includes a global
intercept b0, age at baseline b1, years-from-baseline b2
and diagnosis [categorical variable b3 with four groups:
controls, MCI stable (MCI-s), MCI progressor (MCI-p)
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)], where both the intercept
and years-from-baseline are modelled as random effects.
Years of education, sex, ICV, and presence of an APOE4
risk allele are included as additional fixed control variables.
The model is explicitly shown in Equation 4. Table 1
reports standardized regression coefficients and P-values
for the model. For the diagnosis variable, Table 1 shows
changes between adjacent diagnostic groups together with
the change from controls to Alzheimer’s disease. The asym-
metry of brain structures is the dependent variable, with
results for volume asymmetry (absolute lateral volume dif-
ference) on the top and for shape (BrainPrint) asymmetry
on the bottom. P-values that survive FDR correction
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 2000) (at q = 0.05) are printed
in bold.
Compared
to
volume
asymmetry,
shape
asymmetry
demonstrates a stronger association with age, years from
baseline, and diagnosis for most structures. For volume
asymmetry, a substantial number of structures is significant
for the comparison of controls and Alzheimer’s disease yet,
almost no structure reaches significance for the more chal-
lenging differentiation between adjacent diagnostic groups,
with the exception of white matter and pial surfaces for
MCI-s ! MCI-p.
When working with shapes, white matter, cerebellum
cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate and
putamen
show
a
significant
lateral
shape
asymmetry
increase with age b1. For the longitudinal increase of
shape asymmetry with years-from-baseline b2, also the ven-
tricle and accumbens exhibit a significant effect. The long-
itudinal increase is usually two to five times stronger than
the cross-sectional, indicating that asymmetry tends to
increase faster as a function of within-individual change
in age than as a function of cohort age. The strongest long-
itudinal effects of shape asymmetry are present in hippo-
campus, amygdala and putamen.
Shape asymmetries of the hippocampus and amygdala
differ significantly across all diagnostic groups. Other
structures with significant effects across adjacent diagnostic
groups are white matter, pial, and caudate. Especially when
comparing controls and Alzheimer’s disease (CN ! AD)
shape asymmetries of almost all structures are significantly
different, except for ventricle and thalamus. To further
evaluate the association between asymmetry and cognitive
decline, we replaced the diagnosis in the mixed effects
models
with
outcomes
from
cognitive
tests.

we see higher asymmetry for advanced cognitive decline.
We visualize the change in asymmetry for hippocampus,
amygdala, and caudate in Fig. 3, which displays the esti-
mated intra- and interindividual change of the lateral shape
asymmetry. Solid lines depict the global age effect, where
the offset is determined by the diagnostic group variable.
Short line ticks depict the longitudinal intraindividual effect
which, except for Fig. 3B, is fixed across age and group.

 The plots confirm the higher intraindividual increase in
asymmetry compared to across the age effect. We further
see a separation of disease groups for hippocampus and
amygdala, consistent with the significant effected reported
in Table 1. The model in Equation 4 (used for Fig. 3A, C
and D) assumes a constant slope for the intraindividual
change across all disease groups. The extended model con-
tains the interaction between years-from-baseline and diag-
nosis (Xij � Di), which increases its flexibility and permits
estimating different slopes for each disease group. In the
extended model, we only detect a significant impact of
the
interaction
for
the
hippocampus
[MCI-c:
0.12
(P = 0.005); AD: 0.12 (P = 0.020)], with the corresponding
model plotted in Fig. 3B. Note, that the intraindividual
increase for MCI progressor and Alzheimer’s disease is
similar and much steeper than for MCI stable. The control
group shows almost no intraindividual increase in asymme-
try, only with respect to age. The interaction between age
and disease (different slopes of the permanent lines) was
not significant.
The Mahalanobis distance measures the magnitude in
shape asymmetry, but does not indicate the direction. To
investigate whether the asymmetry is directional, we eval-
uated
the
linear
mixed
effects
model
for
eigenvalue
differences across hemispheres of the hippocampus and
the amygdala. Table 2 reports the model coefficients for
the eigenvalue difference and absolute eigenvalue differ-
ence. Results are shown for six eigenvalues of the hippo-
campus, corresponding to the six eigenfunctions shown in
Fig. 2, and for three eigenvalues of the amygdala. The
results indicate that there are significantly higher associa-
tions for the absolute differences than for the differences,
indicating that the pattern of asymmetry is not directional.
This is consistent with our results on volume asymmetry,
where also the absolute volume difference showed stronger
associations than the volume difference. For the interpreta-
tion of the eigenvalues, it is instructive to consider the
eigenfunctions in Fig. 2, which capture different shape
characteristics of the hippocampus, such as length, curva-
ture, thickness, and width.
To localize the part of the hippocampus asymmetry
that shows the strongest association with Alzheimer’s
disease, we use the level-set analysis. We compute the
mixed effects model on the absolute difference of level
set lengths across hemispheres. Figure 2 illustrates the
level sets as green curves of the first eigenfunction.

ing controls and Alzheimer’s disease (CN ! AD). The

Results are shown for volume (top) and shape/BrainPrint (bottom) asymmetry of neuroanatomical structures. The diagnostic label b3 is a categorical variable with four groups: controls
(CN), MCI stable (MCI-s), MCI progressor (MCI-p), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The coefficient b1 is associated to baseline age and b2 to years-from-baseline. P-values are rounded
to three decimal places.

 posterior region is not significantly associated with diag-
nosis, while the anterior region shows the strongest asso-
ciation (P 5 10�5).
To further investigate connections between increasing
asymmetry and cortical thickness changes, we estimate a
slightly different mixed effects model (Equation 5) on the
cortex for the mass-univariate analysis of thickness as the
dependent variable employing all available subjects and
time points. Here, we include a global intercept b0 and
the
time-varying
hippocampal
asymmetry
measure
b1.
Further, baseline age, sex, years of education, and presence
of an APOE4 risk allele are again included as additional
fixed control variables. The intercept is modelled as a
random effect. Figure 4 shows the significance map for
the longitudinal effect b1 of hippocampal asymmetry after
FDR thresholding, highlighting cortical regions where grey
matter atrophy is significantly associated with within-sub-
ject increases in hippocampal asymmetry, when controlling
for age, sex, education, and APOE4 status.
Progression from mild cognitive
impairment to Alzheimer’s disease
For studying the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s
disease, we used n = 374 individuals with MCI, with
diagnostic
and
demographic
information
reported
in
Supplementary Table 2.
For the Cox proportional hazards model with time-vary-
ing variables in Equation 3, we evaluate the lateral asym-
metry for each of the 11 brain structures with respect to
shape (BrainPrint) and size (volume). In addition, we com-
pute a classical Cox model on baseline measurements of the
BrainPrint, yielding 33 Cox models in total. Table 3
reports hazard ratios (HR), confidence intervals (CI), and
estimates of statistical significance with the Wald test for
the asymmetry component in each model. Figure 5 visua-
lizes the significance for subcortical structures with the
BrainPrint. The only component that exhibits a significant
effect for all models is the interaction between APOE4 and
Figure 3 Longitudinal analysis of standardized lateral asymmetry measures of the hippocampus (A and B), amygdala (C), and
caudate (D). Lines and ticks illustrate estimates of the different linear mixed effects models. The global age effect (fixed across groups) is
depicted by the slope of the long solid lines, the group effect is the offset showing increased asymmetry with advanced disease stage. Short line
ticks depict longitudinal slopes. They are parallel across time and group (in A, C and D) and can vary across group (in B), depicting the model for
the hippocampus with an additional (significant) interaction term between years-from-baseline and diagnosis, showing increasing asymmetry
slopes across groups concordant with disease stage. Diagnostic groups are shown in colour and the order of the lines follows the order of the
legend from top to bottom. AD = Alzheimer’s disease; MCI-P = MCI progressor; MCI-S = MCI stable; CN = controls.

 years-from-baseline. In addition to the significance of sepa-
rate variables in the model, tests of the overall goodness of
fit with the Wald test showed significance for all models.
Structures that show significant results for the BrainPrint
are cortical structures, hippocampus, amygdala, and cau-
date. For volume asymmetry measurements, none of the
structures demonstrate a significant effect in the model.
For the model with BrainPrint baseline measurements, hip-
pocampus, amygdala, and putamen have P-values below
0.05, but they are not significant after FDR correction.
All significant structures have a hazard ratio 41, which
means that the increase in asymmetry raises the risk for
progression to Alzheimer’s disease.
Discussion
Here we present the first method for shape-based asymme-
try analysis of dementia. Our method does not require
registration, and avoids interpolation artefacts and lateral
processing bias by treating both hemispheres exactly the
same. We, furthermore, analyse a variety of different sub-
cortical and cortical structures.
Previous studies on hippocampal asymmetry based on
volumetry
and
small
sample
sizes
have
not
found
significant increases with dementia (Fox et al., 1996;
Barnes et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2009). Here we demonstrate
a clear increase in shape asymmetry of the hippocampus
and
amygdala
concurrent
with
disease
progression
(Table 1). We report significant differences in asymmetry
across all four diagnostic categories (CN, MCI-s, MCI-p,
AD) and observe a similar spacing in baseline asymmetry
across diagnostic groups, with MCI progressors about half-
way between MCI stable and Alzheimer’s disease patients
(Fig. 3). These results are further supported by the signifi-
cant association between asymmetry and cognitive test
scores
(MMSE,
CDR-SB,
ADAS11,
ADAS13)
(Supplementary Table 3) and by within-subject associations
of hippocampal asymmetry increase with cortical atrophy
(Fig. 4), notably in the temporal lobe (both hemispheres)
and superior frontal regions (left hemisphere). The detected
increase of subcortical asymmetry is consistent with pre-
vious findings from PET imaging that demonstrated asym-
metric hypometabolism (Grady et al., 1988; Haxby et al.,
1990) and an asymmetric distribution of amyloid-b (Frings
et al., 2015), as well as cortical asymmetries (Thompson
et al., 2007; Long et al., 2013). The lack of significant
asymmetry findings from previous volumetric studies sug-
gests a heterogeneous effect of neurodegenerative mechan-
isms on subcortical structures that causes neuroanatomical

The model is similar to the one in Table 1 with the dependent variable replaced by the (absolute) difference of the eigenvalues. The diagnostic label b3 is a categorical variable with
four groups: controls (CN), MCI stable (MCI-s), MCI progressor (MCI-p), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The coefficient b1 is associated to baseline age and b2 to years-from-baseline.
P-values are rounded to three decimal places. The six eigenfunctions of the hippocampus corresponding to the eigenvalues are shown in Fig. 2.

 shape variations. This view is supported by findings that
Alzheimer’s disease is more prominent in specific subfields
of the hippocampus (Pievani et al., 2011; Jagust, 2013) and
subnuclei of the amygdala (Mukai et al., 1994). Due to an
increase in sensitivity to local shape changes, our shape
asymmetry analysis can detect these subtle effects earlier
than volumetry.
Our results on the difference of eigenvalues for the hip-
pocampus and amygdala indicate that the increase in asym-
metry is undirectional (Table 2). These results are further
supported by results of volume asymmetry, where absolute
volume differences show a more significant association to
diagnosis than plain differences. These results support the
notion that there is no dominant direction of hemispheric

that shows significant association with dementia progres-
sion. This objects a tentative explanation of higher asym-
metry
from
a
possible
bias
in
clinically
diagnosing
Alzheimer’s
disease
from
symptoms
potentially
more
related to left hemisphere atrophy (language-based tests
for memory assessment), which could result in directional
asymmetry. Alternative approaches, such as voxel-based
techniques (VBM, TBM) and statistical shape models, are
not well suited for identifying undirectional asymmetry
because they average across the population on each hemi-
sphere. In contrast, the proposed shape asymmetry presents
a within-subject measure of asymmetry that identifies direc-
tional and undirectional asymmetry.
Previous studies on hippocampal asymmetry mainly con-
sidered cross-sectional data. Here we find a two to five
times higher longitudinal intraindividual increase in asym-
metry relative to the cross-sectional age effect (Table 1).
These results are in line with previous longitudinal results
on cortical thickness (Thompson et al., 2011). Multiple
sources of between-patient variation can cause these differ-
ences. Most prominent is the healthy survivor effect: indi-
viduals with advanced disease progression or low cognitive
performance may be more likely to drop-out, thus causing
cross-sectional results to be overly optimistic. Sampling var-
iations can further be amplified by non-linear disease tra-
jectories that cause spurious effects in linear models.
Evidence for non-linearity is visible in the hippocampus,
where the differences in slopes across diagnostic groups is
especially pronounced. With the availability of longer
follow-up
periods
and
additional
time
points
in
the
future, the integration of non-linear models may therefore
be appropriate. The slope of the MCI progressors is sub-
stantially higher than for those that remain stable, as
shown by the results of the extended model with the inter-
action term (Fig. 3B). The longitudinal change of MCI
progressors
is
close
to
Alzheimer’s
disease
patients,
indicating that progressors are on a similar disease trajec-
tory of cognitive decline as Alzheimer’s disease patients.
The pronounced longitudinal increase in shape asymmetry
of progressors allows improved differentiations of progres-
sors from non-progressors when incorporating intraindivi-
dual asymmetry changes into the predictive model.
The differentiation between stable MCI and those who
progress to Alzheimer’s disease is of high clinical relevance,
e.g. for selection into disease-modifying therapies or drug
trials. Our results from the time-to-event analysis demon-
strate that asymmetry is predictive for progression from
MCI to Alzheimer’s disease for hippocampus, amygdala,
caudate and cortex (Table 3 and Fig. 5). Shape asymmetry
in these structures may therefore serve as a sensitive bio-
marker for the progression to Alzheimer’s disease. So far,
brain
asymmetry
has
not
been
used
for
predicting
Alzheimer’s disease in a time-to-event analysis. A compar-
ison of models with time-varying variables and with base-
line
measurements
shows
the
advantage
of
including
follow-up measurements in the prediction.
Our results show that shape asymmetry is more predictive
of Alzheimer’s disease than volume asymmetry. In addition
to the results in the mixed effects model, the benefit of
shape asymmetry is highlighted in the comparison to
volume asymmetry for the progression to Alzheimer’s
disease in the Cox model, where volumetry did not yield
any significant results. This suggests that the coarse repre-
sentation of a structure by only its volume neglects impor-
tant information for modelling the onset of dementia. Note,
that the asymmetry measure enters all our statistical models
as a single scalar value, independent of whether the distance
is computed on a high-dimensional shape signature or on
the one-dimensional volume. This allows a direct compar-
ison of the BrainPrint and the volume-based models and
clearly highlights the importance of a discriminative geo-
metric representation for quantifying brain asymmetry.
The advantage of shape representations is also underlined

Increased asymmetries in dementia

 by the level set analysis of the hippocampus, which shows
a
heterogeneous
disease
effect
across
the
structure
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The anterior hippocampus is pri-
marily implicated by the increase in asymmetry as dementia
progresses, consistent with findings from Woolard and
Heckers (2012). Such focal effects are likely to be missed
by volumetry but high-dimensional shape vectors are sensi-
tive to such localized changes.
Ageing is characterized by a multifaceted set of neurobio-
logical cascades that occur at different rates in different
people together with complex and often interdependent
effects on cognitive decline (Buckner, 2004). It is therefore
not surprising that we detect increasing shape asymmetry in
ageing in addition to cognitive decline. The distinction
between ageing and dementia-related processes is difficult
because regions that accommodate neural systems with
high susceptibility to deleterious factors are likely affected
by both (Jagust, 2013). While there is a certain overlap, our
results also indicate that hippocampus and amygdala show
high disease-related effects. In contrast, putamen, thalamus,
and white matter show strong ageing associations while
being only weakly associated to cognitive decline. Our
whole-brain asymmetry analysis, which is in contrast to
previous studies that focused on the hippocampus alone,
offers new opportunities for disentangling ageing and
dementia-related asymmetry increase. The change in asym-
metry with age may be a sign of brain plasticity, the adap-
tation of brain structure throughout life, which is critical
for human cognitive evolution (Go
´mez-Robles et al., 2013).
Neuroanatomical
asymmetry
may
be
correlated
with
changes in brain function, which are known to be influ-
enced by a person’s life experience. The discriminative ana-
lysis of neuroanatomical asymmetry for the whole brain
may enable a more detailed analysis of dementia in the
future, e.g. the identification of subgroups.
