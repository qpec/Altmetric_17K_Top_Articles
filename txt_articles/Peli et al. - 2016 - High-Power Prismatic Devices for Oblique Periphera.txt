 High-Power Prismatic Devices for Oblique
Peripheral Prisms

ABSTRACT
Purpose. Horizontal peripheral prisms for hemianopia provide field expansion above and below the horizontal meridian;
however, there is a vertical gap leaving the central area (important for driving) without expansion. In the oblique design,
tilting the bases of both prism segments toward the horizontal meridian moves the field expansion area vertically and
centrally (closing the central gap) while the prisms remain in the peripheral location. However, tilting the prisms results also
in a reduction of the lateral field expansion. Higher prism powers are needed to counter this effect.
Methods. We developed, implemented, and tested a series of designs aimed at increasing the prism power to reduce the central
gap while maintaining wide lateral expansion. The designs included inserting the peripheral prisms into carrier lenses that in-
cluded yoked prism in the opposite direction, combination of two Fresnel segments attached at the base and angled to each other
(bi-part prisms), and creating Fresnel prismYlike segments from nonparallel periscopic mirror pairs (reflective prisms).
Results. A modest increase in lateral power was achieved with yoked-prism carriers. Bi-part combination of 36$ Fresnel
segments provided high power with some reduction in image quality. Fresnel reflective prism segments have potential for
high power with superior optical quality but may be limited in field extent or by interruptions of the expanded field. Ex-
tended apical scotomas, even with unilateral fitting, may limit the utility of very high power prisms. The high-power bi-part
and reflective prisms enable a wider effective eye scanning range (more than 15 degrees) into the blind hemifield.
Conclusions. Conventional prisms of powers higher than the available 57$ are limited by the binocular impact of a wider
apical scotoma and a reduced effective eye scanning range to the blind side. The various designs that we developed may
overcome these limitations and find use in various other field expansion applications.

n 2000, Peli1 proposed the use of peripheral prisms to expand the
visual field of patients with homonymous hemianopia.The prism
segments are placed peripherally on the spectacle carrier lens
above and below the line of sight. They are usually applied unilat-
erallyon thehemianopic(‘‘blind’’)side(Fig.1A)andalwayswiththe
base in the direction of the visual field defect. This method expands
the binocular visual field as measured by perimetry (Fig. 1C) rather
than merely shifting it, which is the case for binocular sector prisms.3
The central part of the spectacle carrier lens is prism-free,
allowing single central binocular vision with the habitual distance
prescription, if needed. It is the peripheral binocular visual
confusion, two different objects seen in the same apparent di-
rection,1,3 that provides the peripheral visual field expansion.
Objects that would otherwise fall in the blind hemifield of the
hemianopia-side eye are shifted to the residual seeing hemifield
and become visible, superimposed on other objects seen by the
corresponding retinal area in the seeing hemifield of the fellow
eye. Although peripheral diplopia (seeing the same object in two
different directions) can occur, it is minimal with this design.
Because of the large apical scotoma associated with the high
power of the peripheral prisms, much of the peripheral diplopia
is avoided.3
The peripheral placement of the prisms enabled the use of
higher-power prisms than in the earlier sector prism designs (usually
G20$4), thereby providing greater field expansion. Initially, 40$,

 (3M Inc., St. Paul, MN) was used,1 resulting in a lateral field
expansion of about 22 degrees. Later, in collaboration with
Chadwick Optical Inc. (Souderton, PA), permanent peripheral
prism glasses using 40$ rigid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)
Fresnel prism segments (Fresnel Prism and Lens Co., Bloomington,
MN) embedded into the carrier lens were developed (Fig. 1A).
Note that we measured (as described below) the press-on prism
rated as 40$ to provide 40$ of deflection at the primary posi-
tion of gaze, whereas the rigid PMMA Fresnel rated at 40$
only provided about 36$. Throughout the rest of the article, we
use these measured values when referring to these two types of
prisms, respectively.
The original ‘‘horizontal’’ design of the peripheral prisms (so
called because they provided only horizontal prismatic effect) was
evaluated in four clinical studies (total 90 patients).1,5Y7 At
least two thirds of the patients perceived the peripheral prism
glasses to be beneficial, usually reported as better ability to avoid
obstacles on the hemianopic side. However, the horizontal pe-
ripheral prisms provide little help for driving, an important re-
habilitation goal for many patients with hemianopia.8 Although
the nominal field expansion of 20 degrees with the 36$ prisms
would cover most of the needed field for driving, there is a vertical
gap of about 30 to 40 degrees between the upper and lower areas of
peripheral field expansion (Fig. 1C). This variability is caused by
individual differences in the distance between the spectacle plane
and the patient’s eye. Thus, the expansion falls largely outside of
the field of view seen through the windshield of a standard pas-
senger car2 ()30 degrees height) as shown in Fig. 1C.
The vertical separation of the expansion areas could be de-
creased by reducing the gap between the two prism segments.
However, as the gap is reduced, central double vision may result
if the prisms intersect the line of sight during head bobbing
motions when walking or sitting in a moving car. This central
visual confusion is annoying, and avoiding it was a major aim of
the peripheral prism design.1 The minimum interprism separation
that could be tolerated when walking was found to be 11 mm
(median) in a multicenter study.6 To accommodate the majority
of patients, the current fitting procedures use a standard interprism
separation of 12 mm (about 33 degrees).9 With this separation, the
view through the car’s windshield falls mostly within the gap be-
tween the two field expansion areas.
A new type of peripheral prism, the oblique design, invented
by Peli,10 closes the gap between the field expansion areas while
still maintaining the prism-free area in the center of the carrier
lens. However, as detailed below, the oblique design reduces the
magnitude of the lateral field expansion relative to that achieved
with the same power of prism in the horizontal design. This
limitation could be counteracted by use of higher-power prisms.
We, therefore, describe and analyze here a number of novel optical
designs for that purpose. In evaluating the various designs, we
considered the impact of the prism power on the lateral field
expansion as well as two other important properties: the apical
prism scotoma and the eyes’ effective scanning range.
Apfelbaum et al.3 pointed out that the scotoma (blind area) that
exists at the apex of a prism can have both positive and negative
effects on the use of peripheral prisms. The apical scotoma reduces
the annoying and useless diplopic effect from a unilaterally fitted
prism. However, if the extent of the apical scotoma is wider than

 the angular distance from the primary direction of gaze to the
apex, it results in a paracentral binocular scotoma.
Patients with hemianopia may compensate for their hemifield
loss by visual scanning with head and eye movements toward the
blind side. In this article, we only analyze the effect of eye scanning
(i.e., the eye-in-head angle). The extent of the scanning range is an
important consideration when evaluating different prism con-
figurations. In the early implementation of the peripheral prism
of moderate power (40$,22 degrees), it was observed that
the peripheral field expansion effect extended farther into the
blind side when the patient’s eye scanned toward that side (up to
13 degrees toward the prism base), a very desirable property. Jung
and Peli11 noted, however, that, with higher-power prisms, the
extent of visual field with eye scanning toward the blind side was
severely limited by total internal reflection (TIR). For example,
the benefit from eye scanning to the blind side with 57$ prisms
is limited to about 5 degrees of scanning. The ideal high-power
oblique prism design would have less restrictive extension with
eye scanning, allowing the patient to combine the benefits of the
prism deflection power and the eye scanning.
OBLIQUE PERIPHERAL PRISM DESIGN
In the oblique peripheral prism design,10 the apex-base axes of
both the upper and lower prism segments are tilted such that the
bases are closer to the horizontal meridian but without changing
the positions of the prism segments or their shape (Fig. 2). The tilt
creates a vertical prismatic effect that moves the field expansion
areas vertically toward the horizontal midline of the visual field
(reducing the central gap between the field expansion areas) while
the prism segments remain in their peripheral location. Although
the expansion is in more central areas of the field than with the
horizontal design, the images shifted by the prisms continue to
fall on approximately the same peripheral retinal locations, leaving
the central retinal area unobstructed and unaffected by central
double vision.
IMPACT OF PRISM POWER AND PRISM TILT ON
VERTICAL SHIFT AND HORIZONTAL EXPANSION
Tilting the prism apex-base axis by angle A- shifts the expanded
field segment vertically toward the center by a visual angle of
pIsin(A-), where p is the rated prism power expressed in degrees.
The same tilt, however, also results in a reduction of the lateral
field expansion by a visual angle of pIcos(A-). The trade-off be-
tween the vertical shift and lateral field reduction is shown in Fig.
3 for 36$ ()20 degrees) and 57$ ()30 degrees) PMMA prisms.
Because the vertical shift and the reduction of lateral field ex-
pansion are not linearly related, a smaller tilt angle can provide
considerable vertical shift with only a small reduction of lateral
field expansion. For example, a prism tilt of 30 degrees of the 36$
prism provides 10 degrees vertical shift with only 3 degrees reduc-
tion (17 degrees) in lateral field expansion. However, 10 degrees
vertical shift (total of 20 degrees for the top and bottom segments)
from a 36$ oblique prism of 30 degrees tilt is not sufficient
to close the gap for prisms at the standard 12-mm (33 degrees)
interprism separation.9

horizontal design (Fig. 1C), but the lateral field expansion effect is a little
smaller. Note that the field in Fig. 1C was measured with 36$ prisms. (C)

 Further increasing of the tilt angle beyond 30 degrees could
also reduce or eliminate the gap, but the magnitude of the lateral
field expansion shrinks rapidly (Fig. 3). Although 56 degrees tilt
of a 36$ prism could close the gap with 16.5 degrees vertical shift
(black open marker), it reduces the lateral expansion to only 11
degrees (black filled marker). The gap could be also reduced by
fitting the prisms closer together on the carrier lens as illustrated
in Fig. 2C for 40$ press-on prisms. In this case, with 30 degrees
tilt and 9 mm interprism separation ()25 degrees separation at
20 mm from the nodal point), there should still be a gap of about
3 degrees as each segment produces a vertical shift of about 11 degrees
(22 degrees total). Fig. 2C suggests total elimination of the gap; this
small difference probably represents a limitation of the perimetric
measurement accuracy. However, reducing the gap by bringing the
two segments closer is not a practical solution. It may result in
occasional central visual confusion as bobbing head movements
swing the line of sight through the prism segments and only a small
minority of participants (13 of 39; 33%) tolerated interprism
separation of 9 mm or less.6 There are three different reference
points that could be applied: the center of rotation of the eye, the
nodal point, and the center of the entrance pupil. However, for
simplicity,weuse thenodalpointasthe reference for allcalculations;
any differences between using the nodal point and the other refer-
ence points are clinically negligible.11 The center of the entrance
pupil is usually used as a reference point when calculating field of
view in object space in camera systems, enabling perspective to be
maintained for panoramic cameras and zoom lenses. However,
because the rotation of the eye does not take place around the center
of the entrance pupil (as in a panoramic camera), the nodal point
that retains angular magnification is a better choice. Furthermore,
we are interested in the perceived (retinal/image space) angular
separation between two prism segments rather than the object-space
field of view. To confirm that the nodal point is the relevant ref-
erence point to use, we perimetrically measured the perceived an-
gular separation between two prism segments from a 1-m distance.
With 12-mm interprism separation and 13-mm back vertex dis-
tance, the subject perceived 35 degrees angular separation. Thus,
the reference point of the angular separation had to be located about
19 mm behind the prism (6 mm behind the cornea). Because the
nodal point is 7.1 mm (6.5 mm when accommodated) and the
entrance pupil is 3 mm (2.7 mm when accommodated) behind
the cornea based on the Gullstrand model eye,12 the eye’s nodal
point seems to be a better choice for the perceptual reference point
of the angular separation than the center of the entrance pupil.
Increasing prism power, p, increases both the lateral field ex-
pansion and the vertical displacement of the expansion areas,
meeting both needs. When the oblique design was first con-
ceived10 and used,13 40$ was the highest power available. With
57$ prisms, the highest power currently available, a 34-degree tilt
angle is required to completely close the gap (blue open marker),
which results in 25 degrees lateral field expansion (blue filled
marker). We usually aim to leave about a 3-degree gap between the
upper and lower field expansion areas to avoid any overlap of
the expanded visual fields. Therefore, approximately 15 degrees
vertical shift is required from each prism segment at a standard
12 mm (33 degrees) interprism separation.
THE OBLIQUE PERIPHERAL PRISM IN
CURRENT USE
Oblique peripheral prisms have been evaluated in a number of
clinical studies providing evidence of their efficacy for walking9
and driving.13,14 In a multicenter randomized crossover trial with
73 patients, there was a clear preference for real (57$) over sham
(G5$) prisms. In a study of on-road driving,13 the proportion of
satisfactory responses to unexpected blind side hazards was better
with the real than sham oblique prisms. Finally, in an ongoing
driving simulator study, detection rates for pedestrian hazards on
the blind side are higher with than without the oblique 57$ rigid
PMMA prism glasses.14
Although the high-power 57$ Fresnel prisms (Fig. 4A) seem to
address the needs of the oblique peripheral design in terms of closing
the gap while still providing substantial lateral expansion (Fig. 4B),
TIR from the high-power prisms may limit the benefit of scanning
into the blind hemifield.11 Therefore, to maintain wide field ex-
pansion with a wide eye scanning range to the blind side, other so-
lutions to achieve high-power oblique prisms need to be considered.
METHODS TO INCREASE PRISM POWER
Because this article focuses on designs for high-power prisms,
all Fresnel prism configurations use outward prism serrations,
with the serrations facing away from the eye. Configurations with
serrations toward the eye are not suitable (see Jung and Peli11 for
detailed consideration).
FIGURE 3.
The trade-off relationship between oblique tilt angle and the lateral expansion
and vertical displacement. Increasing the tilt angle of the base-apex axis in-
creases the vertical shift (dashed curves) but reduces the lateral expansion
(solid curves) for 36$ (black curves) and 57$ (blue curves) PMMA prisms.
For small angles of tilt, the gain in vertical shift (gap reduction) is higher in
magnitude than the loss in lateral expansion. To close the standard 12-mm
interprism separation (equivalent to 33 degrees vertical gap between the
prismexpansionareasor16.5degreesforeachprismsegment),the36$ prisms
require 56 degrees tilt angle (black open marker), which reduces the lateral
expansion to only 11 degrees (black filled marker). However, the 57$ oblique
prisms can close the gap with just 34 degrees tilt (blue open marker) and still
provide 25 degrees lateral expansion (blue filled marker).

 Yoked Prisms in the Carrier Lenses
Yoked prisms are full aperture prisms placed in front of each
eye that have the same power and base direction (e.g., bases both
to the right or the left). Yoked prisms with base in the direction
of the field loss have been proposed as an optical treatment for
hemianopia,4 although they do not expand the field or even shift
it, as eye movements counter their effect.3 However, when yoked
prisms are used as carriers for the rigid peripheral prisms, which
are embedded in a pocket in the carrier lens, and their base is in
the opposite direction to that of the peripheral prisms as shown
in Fig. 5A, then the total prismatic effect of the peripheral prisms
and the carrier lenses is greater than the peripheral prisms
alone. As illustrated in Fig. 5, where yoked carrier prisms [10$
()6 degrees), base right] were combined with the 36$ ()20 degrees)
rigid PMMA Fresnel horizontal peripheral prisms, base left, the
prismatic effects sum up algebraically, resulting in a total lateral
field expansion of 46$ ()26 degrees) (Fig. 5C). The additional
6 degrees of lateral expansion compensates for loss of lateral ex-
tension caused by the increased tilt angle needed to close the gap
between the prism segments. A 36$ Fresnel prism with 39 degrees

grees field expansion and vertical 15 degrees shift were achieved with each
segment; the gap between the prism expansion areas was eliminated. Note
that the far peripheral field of this patient is smaller than a normal visual field
(dashed line), yet the field expansion achieved by the oblique prism covers
the view through the car windshield.

use of the peripheral prism glasses.

 tilt fitted into a 10$ yoked prism provides 20 degrees lateral
expansion with 16.5 degrees vertical displacement. This is suf-
ficient to close the gap even with the standard 12-mm interprism
separation while keeping the lateral expansion and eye scanning
range similar or better than that possible with a 36$ peripheral
prism in the horizontal design. However, the scanning range is
still limited with the higher-power prism even if the additional
lateral field expansion is achieved by the yoked prism in the
carrier lenses. Note that this approach requires drilling of the
yoked carrier lens and embedding a rigid PMMA prism (Fig. 5A).
By comparison, applying press-on prisms to a yoked carrier lens
will not result in any increase in the prismatic effect of the pe-
ripheral prisms.
Bi-Part Double Fresnel Prism
Another way to increase the power of the peripheral prism is to
combine (stack) two Fresnel segments one over the other. If the
two prisms are stacked parallel to each other, the angle of inci-
dence into the second one is negative and high enough to lead to
TIR and loss of transmission.11 Therefore, the two segments have
to be angled relative to each other to reduce the angle of incidence
and enable transmission as shown in Fig. 6.
For convenience, we ray trace through the bi-part prism as if the
rays were emerging from the eye rather than from the object of
regard. This is particularly useful as one can start from the foveal
line of sight that represents the most extreme ray that will fall on
the functioning side of the retina of a person with hemianopia
after deflection by the prism. The deflection angle C1 of the prism
next to the eye, with refractive index n, angle of incidence E1, and
apical angle >, is as follows:

The total deflection angle of the bi-part prism is C = C1 + C2.
We constructed a bi-part prism using two PMMA 36$ rigid
Fresnel prisms with a screw adjustment to vary the angle between
the prism segments (Fig. 7A) and measured the amount of de-
flection for four angles covering a practical range. The rated prism
power is the calculated deflection angle of a prism for a given
refractive index and apical angle, assuming normal incidence at the
first (near eye) surface. The measured prism power is quite sensitive to
variations in the angle of incidence.11 To measure the prism power at
normal incidence, a laser pointer was aligned to be perpendicular to
the flat surface of the Fresnel prism mounted on a rotational stage.
First, the stage was adjusted so that the beam was reflected back to the
pointer from that surface without any lateral deviation. The position
of the deflected ray was then marked and compared with the position
of the undeviated ray when the prism was removed.
FIGURE 6.
The rays’ paths through a bi-part double Fresnel prism. The two Fresnel prism segments with apical angle > are inclined relative to each other at angle 5. The
total deflection of light C is the sum of the deflection powers of the two segments (C = C1 + C2). As with a conventional prism, the effective prism power of the
bi-part prism is increased by a negative angle of incidence and is limited by TIR (blue ray).11 This design offers some flexibility through a trade-off between a
wider eye scanning range and a higher nominal power (see Fig. 9). When the angle of incidence increases, the effective prism power of the bi-part prism
increases (from red rays to blue rays on the left). If the eye scanning angle in the first prism (closer to the eye) is just under the critical angle of incidence (blue
rays), the angle of incidence in the second prism should be higher than the critical angle of incidence to prevent TIR (blue rays).11 This is achieved by
increasing angle 5.

 Fig. 8A shows the calculated prism powers at normal inci-
dence (deflection angles) for bi-part prisms composed of two
36$ Fresnel prisms as a function of the angle between the prisms
as well as four measurement results. The measured deflection
matches the calculated deflection well. With the 36$ prism
segments and an angular separation of 29 degrees, we achieved a
high deflection of about 38 degrees ()78$). With a 13-degree
angular separation, the deflection power increased to 43 degrees
()93$). Note, however, that there is a trade-off between the ef-
fective prism power and the transmittance. As the angle between the
prisms is reduced, the prism power at normal incidence increases
rapidly, but the light transmittance also decreases rapidly. Fig. 8B
shows the required tilt angle to close the gap between the expan-
sion areas for oblique design bi-part prism segments with a standard
12-mminterprism separationcomparedwithconventional57$ and
36$ prisms.
Having calculated and measured that we could achieve a de-
flection of 38 degrees with a bi-part prism, we then calculated3
(Fig. 7C) and also measured (Fig. 7D) the resulting visual field
expansion for a patient with left hemianopia fitted with a unilateral

 bi-part peripheral prism in the horizontal configuration (as shown
in Fig. 7A). Using Goldmann perimetry (V4e target), the measured
lateral visual field expansion was, as expected, about 40 degrees into
the blind left hemifield under binocular viewing conditions.
However, two paracentral scotomas were also apparent within the
areas of visual field expansion (Fig. 7D). These were caused by the
large apical scotoma associated with the high power of the bi-part
prism extending into the visual field expansion areas where it
could not be compensated for by the seeing visual field of the
nonprism eye. The extent of the measured apical scotoma is larger
than the calculated one in part because the lens was constructed with
theapexmountedinto thecarrier toofar temporally (Fig.7A) than it
could and should have been.11
In addition to the high prism power, the bi-part prism enables a
beneficial wider eye scanning range than a conventional prism
with the same high power. Fig. 9 shows a comparison of the extent
of visual field relative to the straight ahead head position as a
function of the eye scanning angle for bi-part versus conventional
prisms; the eye scanning angle is the same as the angle of inci-
dence. For much of the eye scanning range, the extent of visual
field toward the blind hemifield is determined by the summation
of the eye scanning angle and the deflection angle at the foveal line
of sight (which is a nonlinear function of the eye scanning angle).
As the patient looks toward the blind hemifield (negative eye
scanning angles), the extent of field to the blind side increases
rapidly because of the increase in the effective prism power with
the increasingly negative angles of incidence. When the eye
scanning angle exceeds the critical angle of incidence and TIR
occurs (e.g., at about j14 degrees for the bi-part prism), the
extent of visual field saturates at the value obtained at the critical
angle. Any further increase in eye scanning angle just changes the
retinal eccentricity but does not affect the extent of visual field
toward the blind hemifield.
The critical angle of incidence, where TIR occurs, provides the
maximal theoretical effective prism power with the widest field
expansion. However, the transmittance at the critical angle of
incidence is zero. In consideration of the trade-off between the
effective prism power and transmittance (see Fig. 3 in Jung
et al.11), we consider the maximal practical effective prism power
as the effective prism power at the angle of incidence that results in
50% transmittance. This is consistent with the commonly applied
half-maximum luminance rule in calculating the field of view of a
low-vision telescope.15 With 36$ ()20 degrees) conventional
prism, the theoretical maximum prism power is 92$ (43 degrees),
reached at the critical angle of incidence (j15.7 degrees) with
no light transmission. The prism power associated with 50%
transmittance, reached at j15 degrees angle of incidence, is 73$
(36 degrees). The bi-part prism may be thought to have a lower
transmittance than the single conventional prism and, therefore,
a narrower scanning range (up to the angle of incidence that causes

prisms of 36$ as a function of angle, 5, between them. The nominal deflection angle (normal incidence) for a bi-part prism converges to a fixed value of
about 38 degrees (~78$) for angles between the prisms larger than 29 degrees. As the angle between the prisms is reduced, the deflection angle increases
rapidly and the transmittance also decreases rapidly toward the critical angle (angle of TIR). Rated prism powers of conventional 57$ (dotted line) and 36$
(dashed line) are illustrated. (B) The tilt angle for the oblique design (with 12-mm interprism separation) needed to close the gap (33 degrees) between the

(dashed line) are illustrated for comparison.

 50% transmittance) because of transmission losses through two
prisms. However, because the transmittance variation with the
angle of incidence is so steep around the critical angle of incidence,
the effective eye scanning range of the bi-part prism calculated
using the angle of incidence that results in 50% transmittance is
almost the same as the scanning range of the single prism. For the
case shown here (Fig. 9), the effective scanning range is reduced
only from 15 to 14.3 degrees.
As can be seen in Fig. 9, the effective scanning range (up to the
point of TIR) with the 73$ bi-part prism is close to its lower
power 36$ component and wider than the scanning range for a
conventional 73$ prism. The extent of visual field toward the
blind hemifield possible with the bi-part prism is also wider than
with the conventional 73$ prism by about 14 degrees. Thus, a bi-
part prism enables a wider range of scanning and a larger extent
of visual field to the blind side at most positions of eye scanning
angle than a single prism of the same power. The wide expan-
sion with both conventional and bi-part prisms results from the
minification caused by the rapid change of effective prism power
on approach to the critical angle of incidence.11 That high
minification (compression) may limit the visibility of small objects
at the far end of the expanded field. Other configurations of the
bi-part prism are possible by turning one or both of the Fresnel
components so that the serrations are toward rather than away
from the eye. However, none of them is practical because of
either low power or intense spurious reflections.11
Mirror-Based Periscopic Prism
A third approach to increasing the prism power is a Fresnel
prismYlike device constructed of pairs of mirrors, inspired by
a design that Dr. L. Spitzberg proposed (personal communica-
tion) for a prism-like double mirror-image shifting device to be
used as a classical sector prism for hemianopia, as illustrated
in Figs. 10 and 11A. Sector prisms for hemianopia are typically
restricted to 20$ in power because they affect foveal vision. The
reduced optical quality and increased lens thickness of higher-
power ophthalmic prisms limit their use in obtaining a greater
deflection (shift) of the image through the prism.3 Spitzberg
proposed using a pair of mirrors embedded in the spectacle lens in
a periscope-like arrangement but not parallel to each other as in a
typical periscope. The angular shift of the two mirrors results in an
image deflection angle that is about double the angle between
them. We call this design reflective prism. In addition to the large
angle of deviation that could be achieved with such a system, it is
mostly free of chromatic dispersion because of the use of mirrors,
which is considered the main cause of reduced image quality in
ophthalmic prisms.16,17 There is also no image reversal caused by
the two reversing reflections through the system.
Although Spitzberg’s design was inspiring, it had a number
of limitations. The original design considered only the reflections
at the mirror surfaces and ignored the refractions at the two other
surfaces as the light enters and exits the carrier lens (shown
in Fig. 10), which would reduce the total angle of deflection by a
small amount from the angle of deviation caused by the mirrors
alone. A mirrors-only design would be possible only if the mirrors
were in air and suspended somehow at their edges. More impor-
tantly, the design did not consider the physical limitations of the
spectacle lens thickness on the field of view available through
such a device. With a carrier lens as thick as 5 mm, the shifted
field of view through the device would be too small ()5 degrees)
to be of any practical use (Fig. 10). Peli10 proposed to expand the
field of view by combining a series of these limited field-of-view
reflective prism elements into a Fresnel prismYlike device, as
shown in Fig. 11, that could be implemented as peripheral prisms
in either the horizontal or oblique design (shown schematically
in Fig. 11, B and C).
We have considered two implementations of the reflective
Fresnel prisms: one (following Spitzberg’s original concept) con-
structed from mirrors in air connected and held in place by a
structure above and below and the other a solid device constructed
from PMMA with internal mirrored surfaces. The optics of the
former is easier to describe and follow, but it might be harder to
construct, particularly for the oblique design, and may be im-
practical to maintain and clean as a spectacle lens component. As
shown in Fig. 12A, if such an element is constructed from mirrors
FIGURE 9.
A comparison between bi-part and conventional prisms of the calculated
extent of visual field as a function of eye scanning angle. For a patient with
hemianopia, the extent of visual field is from primary gaze (eye scanning
angle = 0 degrees; head direction) toward the blind side or prism base. At
the foveal line of sight, the angle of incidence is equal to the eye scanning
angle. The effective eye scanning range is limited by the angle of incidence,
resulting in 50% transmittance. Within this range, the effective prism power
increases as the patient scans farther toward the blind side. As a result, the
increase in the extent of the visual field is larger than the scanning angle,
representing prism minification (image compression). The increase in the
extent of the visual field saturates when the eye scanning angle exceeds the
critical angle. On eye scanning into the seeing side, the extent of field to-
ward the blind hemifield is largely unchanged with the bi-part prism even
when compared with the conventional 36$ prism, and it is much more
stable than with the conventional high-power prism. Compare with the thin
dashed lines that represent a constant field extent at all scanning angles.

 silvered on both sides (in air), it can be designed to provide a
uniform deflection power with no or minimal field interruptions.
However, the design curves and converges quickly, enabling only a
few Fresnel segments to be constructed, and thus it is also limited in
the field of view that it can provide for the shifted images. This
design was computed by using KSEG Free Interactive Geometry
Software (http://www.mit.edu/)ibaran/kseg.html). A large-scale
prototype implementation of such a design is shown in Fig. 13,
illustrating the layout and demonstrating the shifted view through
such a device, achieving a large shift of 36 degrees, approximately
73$. The addition of PMMA material filling between the mirrors
(Fig.12B)increasesthecomplexityofthedesignbecauseoftheeffect
of refractionand thepossibility of TIR but offersincreased flexibility
of design. Additional PMMA surfaces can be used to expand the
field of view through the device by moderating the convergence of
the elements as shown in Fig. 12B. Such a device would be much
easier to construct and maintain, can be easily cleaned, and is far less
fragile. As a solid piece of plastic, it can be easily cut at different
angles to serve in the oblique design.
DISCUSSION
The horizontal and oblique peripheral prism configurations
improve on prior prism designs for expanding the fields of patients
with hemianopia.3 The oblique design has the advantage of
closing the vertical gap between the upper and lower field ex-
pansion areas that remains with the horizontal peripheral prism
design. This effect is particularly important for use in driving
(Fig. 4B). However, the expansion of the field in the central area
comes at a cost of a reduction in the lateral field expansion. Thus,
higher-power prisms are desirable for the oblique design. However,
higher-power prisms have some optical side effects such as TIR and
a wider apical scotoma. We considered these in analyzing the
higher-power devices proposed here.
In earlier articles, we claimed that the peripheral prisms, be-
cause of their location across the lens midline, provide the same
expansion at any lateral eye scanning angle.1,3 This desirable
property was true for the 40$ that we used first and especially so
for the press-on prisms that were mounted on the eye side of the
spectacle lens.11 Later, we realized and verified that, with higher-
power prisms, the additional expansion achieved with eye scan-
ning toward the blind side (prism base side) may be severely
limited by TIR.11 Some of the designs we presented here address
this limitation and enable further eye scanning with expansion,
even with higher powers. At the other end of the prism, there is the
prism apical scotoma that is generally seen as a limitation of prisms
in field expansion applications. However, in the case of unilateral
peripheral prisms, it has the advantage that it can reduce or even
eliminate peripheral diplopia. Although binocular confusion is
essential for field expansion, diplopia provides no benefit.3 When
the apical scotoma extent matches the angular span of the prism
between primary gaze and the prism apex, the diplopia is com-
pletely eliminated.3 The apical scotoma extent is equal to the power
of the prism at the apex (expressed in degrees). For a standard
ophthalmic prism (or Fresnel prism), this power is affected by the
angle of incidence between the eye’s nodal point and the prism
apex.11 With high-power prisms, the apical scotoma can be so wide
that it may extend toward the base past the optical center of the
spectacle lens and therefore into the patient’s blind hemifield, re-
sulting in a binocular scotoma (as in Figs. 7C & 7D), even with
unilateral fitting and under binocular viewing.
The apical scotoma problem may be addressed by extending the
prism size on the apex side and thus pushing the apex of the prism
farther away from the blind hemianopic side. With the physical
limitation of the interpupillary distance and the typical frame
design that flares away from the nose at cheek level or lower lens
edge, the maximal extent of the peripheral prism is limited to
about 30 degrees for the lower prism segment. Therefore, a pe-
ripheral prism design that extends at least the upper prism segment
farther nasally on the carrier lens on the side of the field loss may
offer more flexibility. Another approach that may resolve this issue
is to fit the prisms on the other lens (i.e., base-in peripheral prism
FIGURE 10.
Spitzberg’s mirror-based periscopic design viewed from above. Together, the two mirrors form a ray-shifting device that is similar to a prism in terms of the
image shift. In this illustration, the thickness of the spectacle lens is 5 mm and the angular difference of the slanted mirror surfaces is 17 degrees, giving a
prism power of about 67$, but the field of view is limited to only about 5 degrees.

 on the right carrier lens for a patient with left hemianopia). In that
case, the prism apexes are on the temporal side of the lens and can
be easily extended much farther in that direction. Such placement
and extension will work with any of the designs described here, but
it will only be needed for prism powers where the horizontal
components are substantially higher than the currently available
57$. For example, a 66$ effective oblique prism with 30 degrees
tilt angle can provide 55$ of lateral expansion and 30$ of vertical
displacement and expand the field laterally without scotoma or
vertical gap. However, to achieve 66$ effective prism power at the
apex, the nominal prism power has to be much higher than 66$,
which will result in no eye scanning range into the blind side.
Adding 10$ yoked prisms to carrier lenses is easy to produce
and adequately compensates for the lateral expansion, which is lost
as a result of the prism tilt. It is consistent with current production
techniques. In addition, the apical scotoma is not enlarged by the
FIGURE 11.
Various configurations of the mirror prism-like elements used as a field
expansion device for homonymous hemianopia. (A) Spitzberg’s mirror
prismatic device was designed as a single element unilateral sector prism
field expander that extends vertically across the whole lens. While the
prismatic deflection angle can be large, the field of view seen through
this ‘‘prism’’ is narrow and constrained by the thickness of the carrier
spectacle lens. (B) The field of view can be expanded by creating a
Fresnel-like structure with segments of these elements placed one next to
the other. Short elements of this type can then be used to implement the
peripheral prism design. (C) Tilting the same series of mirror elements can
be used to implement the oblique peripheral prism design with a higher
deflection power.
FIGURE 12.
Ray tracing of the field of view constraints of a reflective Fresnel prism
design. (A) The mirrors-in-air design is restricted in extent by the limitations
imposed by the field of view of each segment (because of lens thickness)
and the increased angular rotation of the second prism in every pair, which
leads to diminishing size. Shown here for approximately 40 degrees of
deflection. The solid lines are mirror segments, and dashed lines are traced
rays. (B) A solid design in PMMA provides additional flexibility of design,
but with additional complexity. It can result in a larger extent of the Fresnel
prism section than the in-air design (A). In the implementation shown here,
there are very small blind areas (shown here as white gaps) that, because of
their parallel tunnel-field nature,18 result in rapidly diminishing and neg-
ligible effects at the distances of objects of interest.

 carrier power and does not cause the mid-field binocular scotoma.
However, 10$ yoked prisms make the carrier lenses very thick
(where, on the nasal side, it can be physically uncomfortable too),
heavy, and with questionable cosmetic appeal. Although higher
carrier lens prism powers are possible, they are not a practical so-
lution. High-power full-field prism lenses also result in notable
distortion on the base side of the prism.19,20 That distortion falls in
the blind hemifield when yoked prisms are used with the base to the
blind side to treat hemianopia4 (i.e., the distortion is in an area of
the visual field where the prisms do not work3). However, when
used as described here, the base, and thus the distortion, is in the
residual field and therefore may cause discomfort to the user, es-
pecially for people who are prone to motion sickness. The optical
quality centrally through the prism carrier is also somewhat re-
duced by the prism color dispersion.16,17
The bi-part prism can also be constructed with current tech-
nology. It can provide a much higher deflection power than
currently available devices. More computational and experimental
work is needed to determine optimal prism segment shapes and
sizes and the angle between the two segments for an oblique de-
sign. The bi-part prism offers an interesting advantage as it relates
to the range of eye scanning. As we have shown, a bi-part prism
constructed from two 36$ prisms only limits the benefit from
scanning to 14 degrees as slightly less than a single 36$ prism
(15 degrees scanning range), despite the increase in power. The
same increase in power for a conventional prism will severely
restrict the additional field expansion with eye scanning to the
blind side (2 degrees) by reducing the angle of incidence that leads
to TIR. The bi-part prism may be adjusted to trade deflection
power for scanning range to fit a specific design or application
requirements. Of course, if a very high power is generated, the
apical scotoma is similarly increased and the prism may have to be
mounted on the lens contralateral to the field loss and extend
sufficiently far temporally to limit the apical scotoma. In addition,
the higher minification around maximum field expansion in a bi-
part prism may cause a visibility issue.
The optical quality of the bi-part prism is relatively poor be-
cause it involves a double pass through Fresnel segments. Im-
portantly, this design protrudes out of the carrier lens to such an
extent that it is cosmetically poor, difficult to clean and maintain,
and may be fragile. If it breaks when worn, it may even be dan-
gerous, like a number of previously proposed mirror devices.21,22
A larger bi-part prism, as needed to limit the effect of the apical
scotoma, will also protrude farther from the lens and will be more
prone to breakage.
The reflective periscopic prism elements are simple to manu-
facture. Single segments of the system can be produced as a piece
of PMMA machined to the required shape, two of the surfaces
mirrored, and the assembly of all segments glued together to create
the structure shown in Fig. 12B. This Fresnel prismYlike structure
can be cut to the required prism either horizontal or oblique at any
tilt. The deflection power possible with this system is substantially
higher than currently available prisms, making this design suitable
for the oblique design with minimal tilt and with the additional
advantages of a higher-power prism. Because most of the light
shift is achieved with mirror deflections rather than refraction, the
color dispersion is limited and therefore the optical quality is
higher than that of refractive prisms. Whereas the system shown in
Fig. 12B is not completely free of the limitation of TIR, the
impact of the TIR is highly reduced. Therefore, the ability to scan
with the eyes to the blind side while continuing to gain field
expansion farther into the periphery is only slightly restricted
with this design. However, this functionality requires that the
peripheral prism extends to the blind side beyond the optical
center of the carrier lens. This requires a wider Fresnel structure.
As can be seen in Fig. 12, the basic design of this system curls and
as a result may be limited in the number of segments that can be
put together practically. This effect can be controlled to some
extent by separating the elemental segments and rotating them
slightly relative to each other. This will result in nonimaging
sections (small gaps) between the periscopic mirror prisms. Yet
such a high-power and highYimage quality design may be effective
despite these field interruptions. The limited size of the periscopic
Fresnel system also reduces the ability to extend the prism into the
apex side to reduce the impact of the apical scotoma. Here too,
further design and experimental work is needed to determine the
best option for specific applications.
The oblique peripheral prism is emerging as the solution of
choice for field expansion in hemianopia, especially in considering
the use in driving. For this application, a higher-power prismatic
element is desirable. We have presented a number of options, each
with its own limitations but also with numerous advantages in
relation to secondary aspects of the main field expansion utility.
The ideal design would provide wide lateral field expansion in

 areas of the field surrounding the horizontal meridian, would
permit field expansion to follow when the user scans into the blind
side, and would avoid, as much as possible, creating paracentral
binocular scotomas secondary to the apical scotoma. These con-
siderations apply to the current preferred mode of unilateral fitting
with binocular viewing, which uses binocular multiplexing. Other
modes for peripheral prism field expansion are possible,3 but with
any mode, the full set of considerations needs to be reevaluated.
The high-power prism devices we introduced here in consider-
ation of treating homonymous hemianopia may find use in other
field expansion applications.23,24
