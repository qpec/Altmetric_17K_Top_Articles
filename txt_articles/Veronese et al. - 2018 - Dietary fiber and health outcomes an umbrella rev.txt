ABSTRACT
Background: Several studies have suggested that higher consump-
tion of dietary fiber is beneficial for a variety of health outcomes.
However, many results have been inconclusive and, to our knowl-
edge, there has been no attempt to systematically capture the breadth
of outcomes associated with dietary fiber intake or to systematically
assess the quality and the strength of the evidence on the associa-
tions of dietary fiber intake and different health outcomes or medical
conditions.
Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the diverse health
outcomes convincingly associated with dietary fiber consumption.
Design: This was an umbrella review of systematic reviews
with meta-analysis of observational studies. For each association,
random-effects summary effect size, 95% CIs, and 95% prediction
intervals were estimated. We also assessed heterogeneity, evidence
for small-study effect, and evidence for excess significance bias. We
used these metrics to evaluate the credibility of the identified evi-
dence.
Results: Our literature search identified 1351 abstracts. Of these,
18 meta-analyses including a total of 298 prospective observa-
tional studies and 21 outcomes were included. Outcomes studied in-
cluded cancer and precancer lesions (n = 12), cardiovascular dis-
eases (CVDs; n = 3), all-cause and specific-cause mortality (n = 4),
type 2 diabetes (n = 1), and Crohn disease (n = 1). Overall, 6
(29%) of the 21 eligible outcomes reported highly significant sum-
mary results (P < 1 × 10−6); these included CVD and CVD mor-
tality, coronary artery disease, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer.
Overall, 3 of 21 (14%) outcomes presented convincing evidence
(pancreatic cancer, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality), but
only CVD and all-cause mortality were based on prospective stud-
ies. Two other outcomes (10%), CVD and coronary artery dis-
ease, presented highly suggestive evidence based on prospective
studies.
Conclusion: Our results support dietary recommendations that pro-
mote higher fiber intake as part of a healthy diet.

INTRODUCTION
Dietary fiber is believed to be a key component of a healthy
diet as recommended by several nutritional guidelines (1, 2). Di-
etary fiber is defined as the edible parts of plants or analogous
carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the
human small intestine (3) and comes in 2 main forms depending
on its solubility in water (i.e., soluble and insoluble fiber).
Epidemiologic evidence has consistently shown that a higher
intake of dietary fiber is associated with a reduced risk of several
chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), can-
cer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (4). Many potential mechanisms
through which fibers may act have been postulated, including the
following:1) reduced absorption of glucose and LDL cholesterol;
2) satiation and satiety effect, which may promote weight loss; 3)
gut microbiome–induced production of short-chain fatty acids,

which have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory proper-
ties; 4) trapping of bile acids and carcinogenic substances; and 5)
increased intake of biologically active compounds, such as phy-
tochemicals and antioxidants (5). Indeed, experiments in animal
models indicate that dietary fiber intake is associated with lower
concentrations of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers
(6, 7), which, in turn, are associated with several health outcomes
including several cancers and CVD (8–11).
Despite the aforementioned intensive research efforts on nu-
tritional epidemiology, many questions on the role of fibers in
disease remain unanswered and causality has been difficult to
prove. Previous efforts to systematically appraise the evidence
on dietary fiber have been focused on single disease endpoints
(e.g., CVD). Here we used the umbrella review methodology (i.e.,
the syntheses of existing systematic reviews with meta-analyses)
(12–14) to capture the breadth of outcomes associated with di-
etary fiber intake and to systematically assess the quality and
strength of the evidence across all health outcomes or medical
conditions to highlight those with the strongest evidence.
METHODS
Literature search and selection criteria
We followed standardized procedures to perform an umbrella
review as previously described (i.e., a systematic review of
multiple meta-analyses conducted on a specific research topic)
(15, 16). Umbrella reviews provide a ready means for de-
cision makers in health care to gain a clear understanding
of a broad topic area, particularly when several outcomes
are considered (16). We systematically searched the MED-
LINE/PubMed
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed),
Sco-
pus
(https://www.scopus.com),
and
Embase
(https://www.
embase.com) databases from inception until 21 October 2017
by using the following search keys: (Meta-Analysis[ptyp] OR
metaanaly*[tiab] OR meta-analy*[tiab]) AND (fiber*[tiab] OR
fibre* [tiab]) in the title or abstract of potential references. In
addition, we hand-searched the reference lists of eligible articles.
We included formal meta-analyses of observational studies,
which investigated dietary fibers as a putative factor for any
health outcome. No language restrictions were applied.
Three authors (NV, BS, and MS) performed the primary
screening (i.e., title and abstract screening). Disagreements were
resolved through consensus with a fourth author (IT). The full
texts of all potentially eligible articles were retrieved, and con-
sensus between 2 investigators (MS and NV) determined the fi-
nal eligibility of each reference. Conference abstracts were also
considered.
We included peer-reviewed meta-analyses of observational
studies (case-control or prospective cohort studies) that investi-
gated the association of dietary fiber intake at baseline by us-
ing different questionnaires (e.g., food frequency questionnaire,
24-h recall, 7-d questionnaire, etc.) with any health-related out-
come (e.g., CVD, cancer, death, obesity or overweight, severe
mental illness, diabetes, and metabolic diseases). We included
studies that reported effect sizes with the examined outcome such
as ORs, RRs, or HRs at follow-up. When standardized mean dif-
ferences were reported, we planned to transform these estimates
in ORs according to the formula suggested by da Costa et al. (17).
We excluded systematic reviews without a quantitative synthe-
sis, meta-analyses based on individual data without systematic
review, or meta-analyses including data from randomized con-
trolled trials. Cross-sectional studies were also excluded.
Data extraction
Three independent investigators (NV, MS, and BS) extracted
the following information for each article: 1) first-author name,
2) year of publication, 3) journal, 4) dietary fiber intake and its
categorization (e.g., quintiles, quartiles), 5) methods of ascertain-
ment of dietary fiber intake (e.g., food-frequency questionnaire,
24-h recall, etc.), 6) the number of included studies and the total
number of individuals included in the meta-analysis, 7) the inclu-
sion criteria for the studied population, 8) the effect size used in
the meta-analysis, 9) study design (case-control or prospective),
and 10) number of cases and controls in each study.
We then extracted the most-adjusted, study-specific estimates
for the health outcome (RR, OR, HR, or incident risk ratio), along
with the 95% CI, and the number of cases for each study by di-
etary fiber intake. Assuming linearity for the association between
dietary fibers and health outcomes, the lowest and highest quan-
tiles were considered in the overall analyses and consequently
extracted. If 2 meta-analyses were available for the same associ-
ation, we included the one with the largest number of studies.
Data analysis
For each meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size
and its 95% CI through both fixed- and random-effects models
(18, 19). We also estimated the prediction intervals and their 95%
CI, which further accounts for between-study effects and esti-
mates the certainty of the association if a new study addresses
that same association (20). For the largest data set of each meta-
analysis, we calculated the SE of the effect size. If the SE was
<0.10, the 95% CI would be <0.20 (which is less than the mag-
nitude of a small effect size). Between-study association was es-
timated with the I2 metric; values ≥50% were indicative of high
heterogeneity, whereas values >75% suggest very high hetero-
geneity (21, 22).
In addition, we calculated the evidence of small-study effects
(i.e., whether small studies would have inflated effect sizes com-
pared with larger ones). To this end, we used the regression asym-
metry test developed by Egger et al. (23). A P value <0.10 with
more conservative effects in larger studies than in random-effects
meta-analysis was considered indicative of small-study effects
(24).
Finally, we applied the excess significance test (25), which
evaluates whether the number of studies with nominally signifi-
cant results (i.e., with P < 0.05) among those included in a meta-
analysis is too large based on the power that these data sets have
to detect effects at α = 0.05. For this analysis, the power esti-
mate for each data set was calculated. The sum of the power es-
timates of each study provides the expected number of data sets
with nominal significance. As described elsewhere, the number of
expected “positive”(i.e., significant data sets) studies can be com-
pared with the observed number of significant studies through a
chi-square–based test (25). The larger the difference between ob-
served and expected, the higher the degree of excess of signifi-
cance bias. The true effect size of a meta-analysis is unknown.
We considered the effect size of the largest data set (i.e., with the
lower SE), and on the basis of this, we estimated the effect sizes

of each constituent study with an algorithm by using a noncen-
tral t distribution. Excess significance for a single meta-analysis
was considered whenever P < 0.10. The observed to expected
comparison was done separately for each meta-analysis but was
also extended to groups including many meta-analyses after sum-
ming the observed and expected values of each individual meta-
analysis.
Credibility assessment
We used credibility assessment criteria, which are based on
established tools for observational evidence, as summarized pre-
viously (12, 15, 26). We classified evidence from meta-analyses
of observational studies with nominally significant summary re-
sults (P < 0.05) into 4 categories (class I, II, III, and IV). We
considered as convincing the associations with a significance of
P < 10−6, that included >1000 cases (or >20,000 participants
for continuous outcomes), that had the largest component study
reporting a significant result (P < 0.05), that had a 95% predic-
tion interval that excluded the null, that did not have large hetero-
geneity (I2 < 50%), and that showed no evidence of small-study
effects (P > 0.10) and of excess significance bias (P > 0.10).
Highly suggestive (class II) evidence was assigned to associations
that reported a significance of P < 0.001, included >1000 cases
(or >20,000 participants for continuous outcomes), and had the
largest component study reporting a significant result (P < 0.05).
Suggestive (class III) evidence was assigned to associations that
reported a significance of P < 0.01 with >1000 cases (or >20,000
participants for continuous outcomes). Weak (class IV) evidence
was assigned to the remaining significant associations with P val-
ues <0.05. Due to the inherent limitations of case-control studies
to examine temporal associations, we provided the classification
of evidence on the basis of the following order: 1) meta-analyses
of prospective studies and 2) meta-analyses of prospective and
retrospective case-control studies. Finally, for meta-analyses with
prospective studies classified as convincing evidence, we further
abstracted information by using the AMSTAR tool to study the
quality of their reporting (27).

of these, 18 meta-analyses (28–45) corresponding to 21 differ-
ent outcomes were finally included in our umbrella review. One
meta-analysis (40) included data on 2 outcomes (i.e., CVD mor-
tality and inflammatory disease mortality) and another one (44)
included data on 3 outcomes (Barrett’
s esophagus, squamous
esophageal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma).
Among the 29 articles excluded after full-text screening, 25
investigated the same outcome as other larger meta-analyses al-
ready included (with 7 of them on type 2 diabetes), 2 did not
include any assessment of dietary fiber, one was a systematic re-
view without proceeding to quantitative synthesis of the results,
and the last was a Cochrane review of randomized controlled
trials. Full details of the articles we excluded are reported in
Supplemental Table 1.
Meta-analyses of observational studies
As reported in Table 1, the median number of studies in-
cluded for each outcome was 13 (range: 3–26), the median
number of participants was 342,437 (1381–3,662,691), and the
median number of cases was 7770 (557–67,019). All of the out-
comes (except for one that reported dietary fibers as increase of
7 g/d) reported the comparison between the highest and the low-
est quantile of dietary fiber intake.
A range of outcomes were examined: cancer and precancer le-
sions (n = 12), CVDs (n = 3), all-cause and specific-cause mor-
tality (n = 4), type 2 diabetes (n = 1), and Crohn disease (n = 1)
(Table 1).
Overall, 18 (86%) out of the 21 outcomes reported nominally
significant summary results (P < 0.05), and of these, 6 of 21
(29%) associations survived the application of a more stringent
P value (P < 1 × 10−6). These included associations with inci-
dent CVD, CVD mortality, all-cause mortality, coronary artery
disease, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer.
The study with the largest sample size of each database had an
SE of <0.10 for 2 outcomes and a more conservative effect than
did the random-effects model in 17 of 21 (81%) outcomes, glob-
ally indicating the presence of a small effect size (Supplemental
Table 2). Heterogeneity among studies was modest; the majority
of outcomes (14 of 21; 67%) did not show a large heterogeneity
(I2 < 50%). Only 6 associations (all-cause mortality, CVD mor-
tality, CVD, coronary artery disease, and pancreatic cancer) pre-
sented 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value. The ev-
idence for excess significance (i.e., whether smaller studies tend
to give substantially larger estimates of effect size than larger
studies) was present for 2 outcomes, including breast cancer and
coronary artery disease outcomes. The 3 outcomes with no sig-
nificant results were inflammatory disease mortality, hyperplastic
polyps/serrated polyps unspecified, and prostate cancer (Table 1).
On the basis of the above, 3 of 21 (14%) outcomes presented
convincing evidence (class I: pancreatic cancer, CVD mortality,
and all-cause mortality), 2 (10%) outcomes presented highly sug-
gestive evidence (class II: CVD and coronary artery disease), and
9 (43%) outcomes presented suggestive evidence (class III: gas-
tric cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, colon cancer, colorectal
adenoma, type 2 diabetes, stroke, endometrial cancer, breast can-
cer, renal cell carcinoma) (Table 1). All of the outcomes with class
I and II evidence were limited to prospective studies, with the ex-
ception of pancreatic cancer for which 13 case-control studies
and only 1 prospective study were included. For the 2 outcomes
that showed convincing evidence, the quality was good overall (8
of 11 by using the AMSTAR tool), with limited information on
protocol, studies excluded, and conflict of interest included for
each study.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of reported
associations between dietary fiber intake and a wide range of
health outcomes by incorporating evidence from systematic re-
views with meta-analyses of observational studies. We also fur-
ther evaluated the reported evidence by criteria previously applied
to appraise the epidemiologic credibility in other research spe-
cialties (14, 46). This critical appraisal of the literature is neces-
sary because researchers widely use a nominal significance level
at P < 0.05 to claim novel associations. However, findings based
on this threshold can only constitute weak evidence in several
cases, and there are ongoing debates on redefining the level of
significance by using more stringent criteria (47). In our study,
even though 85% of the associations were significant, a higher
intake of dietary fibers was convincingly associated only with a
decreased likelihood of early mortality and CVD (including coro-
nary artery disease and specific-cause mortality).
The potential positive benefits of dietary fiber on the above-
mentioned health outcomes might be explained by several hy-
potheses. First, a higher consumption of fibers seems to be
associated with lower concentrations of serum inflammatory
biomarkers (48, 49), and inflammation is associated with a higher
risk of mortality (50), cancer (10, 51, 52), and CVD (53). Second,
dietary fibers are known to alter intestinal microbiota composi-
tion and function (54), which play pivotal roles in modulating
the immune system and might affect CVD and cancer risk (55).
Finally, the consumption of fibers (particularly from vegetables)
is associated with higher intakes of vitamins (56), minerals (57),
and phytoestrogens (58). These micronutrients seem to decrease
the risk of the chronic diseases for which we observed a signifi-
cant reduction.
Overall, we found that higher dietary fiber intake was associ-
ated with a lower risk of CVD, and in particular of coronary artery
disease and CVD-related death. Other than the reasons mentioned
above, it was hypothesized that dietary fiber may inhibit choles-
terol synthesis and consequently reduce serum cholesterol con-
centrations by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids
and the rate of bile excretion, promote weight loss by regulating
energy intake, and slow glucose absorption and thus improve in-
sulin sensitivity (4, 59). Fiber viscosity has also been proposed to
improve glycemic control and cholesterol concentrations because
viscous properties of soluble fibers could inhibit cholesterol and
glucose absorption (60). In support of this, evidence from a meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that intake of
konjac glucomannan, a viscous soluble fiber, is associated with
reductions in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (61).
We found suggestive evidence that higher dietary intakes are
associated with a lower risk of several cancers (i.e., pancreatic,
gastric, esophageal adenocarcinoma, colon, endometrial, breast,
and renal), stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The meta-analyses of these
outcomes had some limitations, including the use of retrospective
case-control studies for all cancer outcomes studied, the presence
of high or very high heterogeneity, a small-study effect of ex-
cess significance bias, or prediction intervals containing the null

2Evidence class criteria—class I (convincing): statistical significance at P < 10−6, >1000 cases (or >20,000 participants for continuous outcomes), the largest component study reported a significant effect
(P < 0.05); the 95% prediction interval excluded the null, no large heterogeneity (I2 < 50%), no evidence of small-study effects (P > 0.10) and excess significance bias (P > 0.10); class II (highly suggestive):
significance at P < 10−6, >1000 cases (or >20,000 participants for continuous outcomes), the largest component study reported a significant effect (P < 0.05); class III (suggestive): statistical significance at
P < 10−3, >1000 cases (or >20,000 participants for continuous outcomes); and class IV (weak): the remaining significant associations at P < 0.05.

value. Compared with previous umbrella reviews, which stud-
ied associations between single risk factors and health outcomes
(46, 62), these studies failed only one of our criteria and not mul-
tiple, indicating that the presence of bias in this literature may
be relatively modest. Of particular interest is the association be-
tween dietary fiber and gastrointestinal cancers. These associa-
tions included only moderate biases, which nearly failed our cri-
teria for strong evidence, mainly due to prediction intervals not
including the null value, but at the same time were largely based
on case-control studies that suffer inherent limitations including
recall bias and inability to examine temporal associations (63).
Nonetheless, the wide prediction intervals may just indicate the
heterogeneity of the response to fibers in different settings.
In animal models, it has been reported that dietary fibers pro-
mote the onset of the bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which
ferments fibers into short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate.
Butyrate is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, an essential
mechanism in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling for
the epigenetic control of gene expression (64–66). A positive
modulation on such processes may consequently generate advan-
tages for cells with normal DNA, hampering the reproduction of
tumor cells (63, 67). For colorectal cancer and for its classical
precancerous lesion (i.e., colorectal adenoma), more studies are
warranted, mainly due to the presence of the high heterogeneity
of these results. However, our findings are in agreement with a
Cochrane review of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled
trials in which the authors found that increased dietary fiber intake
did not reduce the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps
in ∼5000 participants (68). We were also unable to discriminate
whether fiber intake may have a more favorable and protective
effect if colon and rectum cancer are considered separately. Al-
though tumors in these 2 locations have been typically staged
under the same system [the TNM staging system of colorectal
cancer (69)], the faster transit in the bowel of food rich in fibers,
the specific modulation of fibers on cecal microbiota, and their
bulking effect may play a more significant role in colonic (e.g.,
cecal) than in rectal-only carcinogenesis (70). Last, in one large
meta-analysis involving 359,167 participants and 14,065 cases of
incident diabetes, higher dietary fiber intake was associated with
a significant 19% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (35), but again, this
finding was affected by modest heterogeneity and the prediction
intervals did not include the null value.
The findings of our work should be interpreted within its limi-
tations. First, we adopted credibility assessment criteria, which
were based on already established tools for observational evi-
dence (26). Although none of the components of these criteria
provides definitive proof of lack of reliability, they cumulatively
suggest that the results are susceptible to bias and uncertainty. Be-
cause the meta-analyses included studies with differences in de-
sign, population, and other basic characteristics, one might claim
that large heterogeneity may not necessarily be worrisome. How-
ever, we used an I2 < 50% as one of the criteria for class I evi-
dence (convincing) in order to assign the best evidence grade only
to robust associations and without suspicion of bias. In fact, in
most cases, I2 ≥ 50% indicates the presence of single studies with
opposite effects or without significant associations. However, 7
meta-analyses of observational studies classified as class II, III,
or IV had an I2 ≥ 50%, with all of the single studies reporting
a significant association in the same direction. Second, another
limitation of the umbrella review approach is the use of exist-
ing meta-analyses. Meta-analyses are known to have important
shortcomings (71), and their results may also depend on choices
made about what estimates to select from each primary study and
how to represent them in the meta-analysis (e.g., in our umbrella
review, several meta-analyses did not report any information on
the population included in the research). This may be a relevant
issue when the factor of interest is continuous, and when different
comparisons of levels of the risk factor may be selected to express
risk (72).
In conclusion, we found convincing and suggestive evidence
for associations between dietary fiber intake and a range of
chronic diseases, including CVD, type 2 diabetes, and pancreatic
cancer. Our results support dietary recommendations that pro-
mote a higher fiber intake as part of a healthy diet. However, fu-
ture randomized controlled trials in large sample sizes are needed
to confirm these observational findings and to study the effects of
different fiber subtypes.
The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—NV, MS, and BS: per-
formed the screening and extraction; NV, MS, BS, IT, MGC, GG, and ARO:
drafted the manuscript; NV, MS, SM, and EE: performed the statistical anal-
ysis; and all authors: critically revised the manuscript, and read and approved
the final manuscript. None of the authors declared a conflict of interest.
