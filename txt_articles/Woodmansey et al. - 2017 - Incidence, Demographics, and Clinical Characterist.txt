of the Exocrine Pancreas (Type 3c):
A Retrospective Cohort Study
Diabetes Care 2017;40:1486–1493 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-0542
OBJECTIVE
This study was conducted to describe the incidence of diabetes following pancreatic
disease, assess how these patients are classified by clinicians, and compare clinical
characteristics with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Primary care records in England (n = 2,360,631) were searched for incident cases of
adult-onset diabetes between 1 January 2005 and 31 March 2016. We examined
demographics, diabetes classification, glycemic control, and insulin use in those with
and without pancreatic disease (subcategorized into acute pancreatitis or chronic
pancreatic disease) before diabetes diagnosis. Regression analysis was used to
control for baseline potential risk factors for poor glycemic control (HbA1c ‡7%
[53 mmol/mol]) and insulin requirement.
RESULTS
We identified 31,789 new diagnoses of adult-onset diabetes. Diabetes following pan-
creatic disease (2.59 [95% CI 2.38–2.81] per 100,000 person-years) was more common
than type 1 diabetes (1.64 [1.47–1.82]; P < 0.001). The 559casesofdiabetes following
pancreatic disease were mostly classified by clinicians as type 2 diabetes (87.8%) and
uncommonly as diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (2.7%). Diabetes following pan-
creatic disease was diagnosed at a median age of 59 years and BMI of 29.2 kg/m2.
Diabetes following pancreatic disease was associated with poor glycemic control
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 [1.3–2.2]; P < 0.001) compared with type 2 diabetes. Insulin
use within 5 years was 4.1% (3.8–4.4) with type 2 diabetes, 20.9% (14.6–28.9) with
diabetes following acute pancreatitis, and 45.8% (34.2–57.9) with diabetes following
chronic pancreatic disease.
CONCLUSIONS
Diabetesofthe exocrinepancreas isfrequentlylabeled type2 diabetesbut has worse
glycemic control and a markedly greater requirement for insulin.
Diabetes of the exocrine pancreas is thought to constitute 9% of diabetes in hospital-
ized patients (1). This form of diabetes results when a process, such as inflammation,
neoplasia, or surgical resection, disrupts the global architecture or physiology of the
pancreas, often resulting in both exocrine and endocrine dysfunction (2,3). Diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas is now the suggested universal nomenclature (4); terms such as
type 3c diabetes and secondary pancreatic diabetes have previously been used. To our

 knowledge, preceding pancreatic disease
has never been systematically identified
in a cohort of people with diabetes in
primary care, and thus the comparative
incidence and clinical characteristics of
diabetes of the exocrine pancreas remain
uncertain.
Recognizing the role of pancreatic
damage in the development of a patient’s
diabetes is vital to inform appropriate
management plans. In diabetes of the
exocrine pancreas, the production of in-
sulin is usually reduced. This is caused by
b-cell dysfunction following pancreatic
inflammation or by absolute b-cell loss
(5,6). In addition, pancreatic polypeptide
upregulates insulin receptor expression in
the liver, and its loss can lead to hepatic
insulin resistance (7), an important phys-
iological difference between diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas and type 1 diabe-
tes. Glucagon production from pancreatic
a-cells is also diminished, which may ex-
plain the episodes of severe hypoglyce-
mia that are reported in some patients
(8,9). Failure to recognize this altered
physiology may result in suboptimal
treatment. Newer incretin-based agents,
such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor
agonists (“incretins”) and dipeptidyl pep-
tidase 4 inhibitors (“gliptins”), would usu-
ally be considered contraindicated because
of the presence of pancreatic damage (10).
Insulinopenic patients with diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas could be unfairly
labeled as poorly compliant if they are
misclassified as type 2 diabetes and
show resistance to oral antihyperglyce-
mic agents. Malabsorption secondary
to pancreatic exocrine dysfunction is
common, and pancreatic enzyme and vi-
tamin D replacement is required to pre-
vent malnutrition and osteoporotic bone
disease (11–13).
Few studies have investigated how
the distinct pathophysiology of diabetes
of the exocrine pancreas manifests clini-
cally. Limited evidence on the likelihood
ofsignificanthyperglycemiaindiabetesof
the exocrine pancreas makes deciding
when to escalate antihyperglycemic ther-
apy difficult. Retinopathy screening of pa-
tients with diabetes following chronic
pancreatitis has suggested that when
poor glycemic control is present in diabe-
tes of the exocrine pancreas, the risk of
microvascular disease is as high as with
type 1 diabetes (14).
It has been suggested that 40% of hos-
pital inpatients with diabetes of the
exocrine pancreas are misdiagnosed as
type 2 diabetes (1). Whether all diabetes
that occurs following pancreatic disease
should be considered diabetes of the exo-
crine pancreas is not clear, and there are
currently no validated diagnostic criteria
for diabetes of the exocrine pancreas.
b-Cell failure does occur in adults with
type 2 diabetes, but usually after a period
of sustained insulin resistance (15), and
only 1.7% ofpeoplewith newly diagnosed
type 2 diabetes required insulin as a first
line therapy in a recent large U.K. retro-
spective cohort (16). If insulin is com-
monly required early in the course of
diabetes in adults with prior pancreatic
disease, it would imply that type 2 diabe-
tes is not the usual explanation for diabe-
tes in this patient group.
There is scarce evidence on how the
clinical characteristics of diabetes follow-
ingacutepancreatitiscomparewith those
of diabetes following chronic pancreatic
disease. Hypothetically, acute pancreati-
tis may have a lower propensity toward
diabetes if an attack results in less sig-
nificant organ damage than occurs with
chronic pancreatic disease. However, a
recent systematic review of cohorts of
patients with acute pancreatitis found a
prevalence of diabetes of 23% and that
27 of 108 patients with diabetes following
severe acute pancreatitis were using in-
sulin if monitored beyond 5 years (17).
Furthermore, a study of the prevalence
of diabetes following pancreatitis or pan-
creatic cancer in New Zealand identified
the largest cohort of cases of diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas described in the
literature thus far and found acute pan-
creatitis was the most frequent preceding
disease (18). Comparison of diabetes fol-
lowing acute pancreatitis with both dia-
betes following chronic pancreatic disease
and diabetes in the absence of preceding
pancreatic disease would help confirm that
diabetes of the exocrine pancreas routinely
follows acute pancreatitis and ascertain to
what extent diabetes of the exocrine pan-
creas is a homogenous group.
We aimed to describe the incidence of
diabetes following pancreatic disease in
the general population and to assess
whether this patient group is more com-
monly classified by doctors as type 1 di-
abetes, as type 2 diabetes, or as diabetes
of the exocrine pancreas. We also as-
sessed whether the clinical course of di-
abetes following pancreatic disease
differs from type 1 diabetes and type 2
diabetes by comparing trends in glycemic
control and insulin use over time.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design
We identified new diagnoses (incident
cases) of diabetes and then performed
a retrospective cohort study comparing
those with preceding pancreatic dis-
ease to those without. Our comparative
groups were adults with a new diagnosis
of A) type 1 diabetes with no prior pan-
creatic disease, B) type 2 diabetes with no
prior pancreatic disease, and C) diabetes
following pancreatic disease, which we sub-
divided into i) diabetes following acute
pancreatitis and ii) diabetes following
chronic pancreatic disease. We report the
baseline characteristics and population inci-
dence for each group along with the diabe-
tes classification, assigned by treating
physicians, of those with diabetes following
pancreatic disease. Clinical outcome mea-
sureswereglycemiccontroland insulinuse.
Setting and Data Source
We searched routinely collected elec-
tronic records from patients in England
whowere registeredat primary care prac-
tices participating in the Royal College of
GeneralPractitionersResearchandSurveil-
lance Centre (RCGP RSC) (19). The study
period was 1 January 2005 to 31 March
2016, inclusive.
The RCGP RSC extracts data once
weekly from the primary care records of
more than 2 million patients. All patients
in the U.K. are registered with a primary
care practice and have a unique National
Health Service number that prevents
“double-counting” in research. U.K. pri-
mary care is fully computerized. Consul-
tations with secondary care specialists (in
the large majority via the public National
Health Service, but on occasion in the pri-
vate sector) occurs by referral from the
primary care doctor, and the specialist
will write back to the primary care doctor
with the findings of each consultation.
The events of any acute hospital admis-
sions are also fed back to patients’ pri-
mary care practices. This information is
then coded into the patient’s primary
care record. Data in U.K. primary care sys-
tems are encoded using Read codes.Read
codes can be considered as equivalent to
ICD codes but provide a more compre-
hensive coding system that allows the re-
cording of diagnoses, problems, clinical
findings, and treatments (20). The RCGP

 RSC was initially established in 1964 for
surveillance of influenza and respiratory
infections (21) but has since expanded its
scope to allow more detailed research.
Participants and Study Groups
Diabetes
We used Read codes to identify adults
with diabetes. Adulthood was defined as
age 18 years or older in accordance with
national U.K. diabetes guidelines (22,23).
We excluded all those whose diagnosis of
diabetesprecededourstudy period(Read
code ofdiagnosis before the studyperiod,
oral antihyperglycemic medication or in-
sulin use before the study period, first di-
abetes Read code less than 1 year after
registration at a practice). We excluded
from our primary analysis those who
had a conflicted coding of both type 1
and type 2 diabetes but no history of pan-
creatic disease but reanalyzed them as
part of a secondary sensitivity analysis.
Pancreatic Disease
We also used Read codes to identify all
those with a diagnosis of pancreatic dis-
ease preceding their diagnosis of diabe-
tes. This group was subdivided into those
with a history of acute pancreatitis only
and those with any history of chronic pan-
creatic disease.The chronic conditions we
identified were chronic pancreatitis, pan-
creatic cancer, hemochromatosis, cystic
fibrosis, and surgical pancreatic resection.
We included single and repeated epi-
sodes of acute pancreatitis in the acute
pancreatitis group. However, a patient
who was ever diagnosed with a chronic
pancreatic condition before developing
diabetes was included in the chronic pan-
creatic disease group and excluded from
the acute pancreatitis group.
Baseline Characteristics and Outcome
Measures
Baseline Characteristics
The baseline characteristics of age, sex, eth-
nicity, index of multiple deprivation score,
smoking status, and BMI were extracted
from the time of diagnosis of diabetes.
Thesebaselinecharacteristicswerelaterad-
justed for as possible confounders of glyce-
mic control and insulin use (for which we
also adjusted for HbA1c at diagnosis) in the
statistical models as described below.
Classification of Diabetes Following
Pancreatic Disease
We examined whether those with diabetes
following pancreatic disease were coded by
their treating physicians as type 1 diabetes,
type 2 diabetes, or diabetes of the exocrine
pancreas. Any coding containing any pos-
sible synonymous term such as “second-
ary pancreatic diabetes mellitus” or
“secondary diabetes mellitus” we defined
as consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes
of the exocrine pancreas.
Glycemic Control
We extracted HbA1c values at diagnosis,
at 1 year, and at 5 years for each group.
Weuseda 12-month window of6 months
before to 6 months after the 1-year and
5-year times, during which if a measure-
ment of HbA1c was made, we extracted it
for analysis. We used the HbA1c value
closest to the desired time point when
more than one value was measured in
the window. We determined the num-
ber with poor glycemic control at 1 year
and at 5 years. We defined poor glycemic
control as HbA1c $7% (53 mmol/mol),
according to the generic target of the
American Diabetes Association and the
European Association for the Study of
Diabetes hyperglycemia guidelines (24).
We calculated the likelihood of poor gly-
cemic control at both 1 and 5 years for
diabetes following pancreatic disease and
for type 1 diabetes, with type 2 diabetes
as the reference group.
Insulin Use
We assessed the number of patients who
started insulin within 1 year and within
5 years of diabetes diagnosis and the pro-
portion of those with sufficient follow-up
who had started insulin at each time
point. Wecalculated the likelihood ofpro-
gression to insulin therapy for diabetes
following pancreatic disease at both
1 and 5 years, with type 2 diabetes as the
reference group.
Statistical Methods
We calculated incidence rates as the
number of new diagnoses per the total
study group person-years. We used the
Pearson x2 test with Yates correction for
continuity to test for significant differ-
ences between incidence rates, the pro-
portion of people taking insulin, and the
proportion of people with poor glycemic
control (25). We created logistic regres-
sion models for odds of poor glycemic
control at 1 year and at 5 years (26). To
analyze time to insulin use, we produced
Kaplan-Meier curves comparing type 2
diabetes without preceding pancreatic
disease, diabetes following acute pancre-
atitis, and diabetes following chronic
pancreatic disease (27). We initially cre-
ated Cox proportional hazards models to
assess the hazard of progression to insu-
lin; however, these failed proportional
hazards testing (28,29). We therefore cre-
ated logistic regression models for odds
of progression to insulin at 1 year and
5 years. For all the statistical models we
report unadjusted odds ratios and odds
ratios after adjustment for baseline char-
acteristics. Our null hypothesis for all
statistical tests was that there was no dif-
ference between the compared groups,
and we set a confidence level of 95%
such that a P value of ,0.05 would lead
us to reject our null hypothesis. All statis-
tical testing was performed using R 3.2.5
statistical software.
RESULTS
We identified 31,789 new diagnoses (in-
cident cases) of adult-onset diabetes,
with a median follow-up time of 4.5 years
(interquartile range [IQR] 2.0–7.4) from
the date of diabetes diagnosis (Fig. 1); of
these, 559 cases were of diabetes follow-
ing pancreatic disease. We subdivided this
group into 361 cases of diabetes following
acute pancreatitisand198casesofdiabetes
following chronic pancreatic disease.
Incidence
The incidence of adult-onset diabetes fol-
lowing pancreatic disease was higher than
the incidence of adult-onset type 1 diabetes
(2.59 [95% CI 2.38–2.81] per 100,000
person-years vs. 1.64 [1.47–1.82] per
100,000 person-years; P , 0.001) in our
population. Adult-onset type 2 diabe-
tes had the highest incidence (142.89
[41.31–144.50] per 100,000 person-
years). The proportion of diabetes following
pancreatic disease among adult-onset
diabetes was 1.8% compared with a pro-
portion of 1.1% for type 1 diabetes.
Demographics
Diabetes following pancreatic disease
wasdiagnosedatamedianageof59years
(IQR 49–70) in patients with a median
BMI of 29.2 kg/m2 (IQR 25.7–34.3). Full
characteristics for each of the groups at
baseline (diagnosis of diabetes) are pro-
vided in Table 1.
Classification of Diabetes Following
Pancreatic Disease
Diabetes following pancreatic disease
was rarely classified as diabetes of the
exocrine pancreas (2.7% [95% CI 1.6–
4.5]). A proportion was classified as
1488
Diabetes of the Exocrine Pancreas

 type 1 diabetes (7.7% [5.7–10.3]), but di-
abetes following pancreatic disease was
most commonly diagnosed as type 2 di-
abetes (87.8% [84.8–90.4]) (Table 2).
Glycemic Control
MeanHbA1c levels(Supplementary Table 1)
were higher in people with diabetes fol-
lowing pancreatic disease than in people
with type 2 diabetes. HbA1c levels were
higher at presentation (P = 0.002) and
remained higher at 1 year (P , 0.001)
and 5 years (P , 0.001) after diagno-
sis. Mean HbA1c levels in people with
diabetes following pancreatic disease
were 8.3% (67 mmol/mol) at diagnosis,
7.1% (54 mmol/mol) at 1 year, and 7.6%
(60 mmol/mol) at 5 years. Mean HbA1c lev-
els in people with type 2 diabetes were
7.9% (63 mmol/mol) at diagnosis, 6.8%
(51 mmol/mol) at 1 year, and 7.2%
(55 mmol/mol) at 5 years. HbA1c levels
were also higher in type 1 diabetes than
in type2 diabetes, withmeanHbA1clevels
of 12.1% (109 mmol/mol) at diagnosis,
7.6% (60 mmol/mol) at 1 year, and 8.6%
(70 mmol/mol) at 5 years. Mean HbA1c
levels in diabetes following acute pancreati-
tis were no different from the mean HbA1c
levels in diabetes following chronic pancre-
atic disease at presentation (P = 0.214), at
1 year (P = 0.642), orat 5 years (P = 0.779).
People with diabetes following pancre-
atic disease had a greater likelihood of
poor glycemic control (Supplementary
Table 2) than those with type 2 diabetes.
Diabetesfollowing pancreatic disease had
poor control in 40.3% (95% CI 35.7–45.1)
of cases compared with 32.5% (31.9–
33.1) of cases of type 2 diabetes at
1 year after diagnosis (P , 0.001). Diabe-
tes following pancreatic disease had an
unadjusted odds ratio for poor control
at 1 year of 1.4 (1.1–1.7) compared
with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001). After
adjustment for baseline characteristics,
the odds ratio for poor control was 1.3
(1.1–1.6; P = 0.005). At 5 years after di-
agnosis, diabetes following pancreatic
disease had poor control in 61.9% (54.8–
68.5) of cases compared with 46.3%
(45.5–47.2) of cases of type 2 diabetes
(P , 0.001). Diabetes following pancre-
atic disease had an unadjusted odds ra-
tio for poorcontrolat5yearsof1.7(1.3–2.2)
compared with type 2 diabetes (P ,
0.001).Afteradjustmentforbaselinechar-
acteristics,theoddsratioforpoorcontrolwas
1.7 (1.3–2.2; P , 0.001). People with
type 1 diabetes also had worse control
than those with type 2 diabetes, with ad-
justed odds ratios for poor glycemic con-
trol of 1.4 (1.1–1.8) at 1 year (P = 0.007)
and 2.5 (1.7–3.7) at 5 years (P , 0.001).

Data are presented as n (%). Groups are split into type 1 diabetes with no prior history of pancreatic disease, type 2 diabetes with no prior history of
pancreatic disease, and diabetes that developed following pancreatic disease. Diabetes following pancreatic disease is subdivided into diabetes following
acute pancreatitis and diabetes following any chronic pancreatic disease. IMD, index of multiple deprivation. *Alcohol consumption was divided into
four categories based on Read code data: “none” (current nondrinker), “safe” (,14 units per week or only occasional consumption), “hazardous” (.14

 with type 2 diabetes. At 1 year after di-
agnosis, 1.4% (95% CI 1.3–1.6) of those
with type 2 diabetes required insulin, ris-
ing to 4.1% (3.8–4.4) at 5 years. In com-
parison, insulin use in diabetes following
pancreatic disease was 16.3% (13.1–20.0)
at 1 year (P , 0.001), rising to 29.6%
(23.6–36.4) at 5 years (P , 0.001). Diabe-
tes following pancreatic disease had an
unadjusted odds ratio for insulin use at
1 year of 13.5 (10.3–17.5) compared
with type 2 diabetes (P , 0.001). After
adjustment for baseline characteristics,
the odds ratio for insulin use was 9.6
(7.0–13.2; P , 0.001). Diabetes following
pancreatic disease had an unadjusted
odds ratio for insulin use at 5 years of
9.9 (7.2–13.4) compared with type 2 di-
abetes (P , 0.001). After adjustment
for baseline characteristics, the odds
ratio for insulin use was 7.4 (5.2–10.4;
P , 0.001).
Diabetes following chronic pancreatic
disease had a higher rate of insulin use
than diabetes following acute pancreati-
tis (Fig. 2); however, patients in both of
these subgroups had a greater require-
ment for insulin than those with type 2
diabetes (Supplementary Table 3). At
1 year after diagnosis, 9.7% (95% CI 6.8–
13.7) of those with diabetes following
acute pancreatitis were using insulin, ris-
ing to 20.9% (14.6–28.9) at 5 years.
At 1 year after diagnosis, 28.9% (22.2–
36.7) of those with diabetes following
chronic pancreatic disease were using in-
sulin, rising to 45.8% (34.2–57.9) at 5 years
(all P , 0.001 compared with type 2
diabetes).
Supplementary Analyses
A summary of the patient characteristics
and outcomes further subdivided by indi-
vidual pancreatic diseases is provided
in Supplementary Table 4. We also
performed a sensitivity analysis that dem-
onstrated that inclusion of patients with
conflicted type 1 and type 2 diabetes di-
agnoses did not affect our findings (data
not shown).
CONCLUSIONS
Diabetes following pancreatic disease is
frequently labeled type 2 diabetes but
follows a different clinical course, with
worse glycemic control and a markedly
greater requirement for insulin. This is
the largest study to include all forms of
diabetes ofthe exocrine pancreas todate,
and to our knowledge, the only study to
systematically identify pancreatic disease
in a cohort of people with newly diag-
nosed diabetes.
We show that diabetes following pan-
creatic disease has a higher incidence in
adults than type 1 diabetes. We were un-
able to find any other primary evidence
comparing the incidence, prevalence, or
demographics of diabetes of the exocrine
pancreas with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in
the general population. This finding, how-
ever, is in keeping with a large epidemio-
logical study of the prevalence of diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas in New Zealand, in
which the researchers hypothesized that

 at a rate of 1.13 per 1,000 general popula-
tion, the prevalence of diabetes of the exo-
crine pancreas may be not dissimilar to
type 1 diabetes (18).
Important limitations when interpret-
ing our findings are the retrospective col-
lection of data and the use of Read codes
to identify pancreatic disease and to clas-
sify diabetes. This method can result in
misclassification and selection bias (30).
The RCGP RSC has been shown to be a
source of high-quality data and is repre-
sentative of the population of England
(19). However, generalizability of our
data to other countries may be limited,
especiallyinthose with a differentburden
of pancreatic disease. This is of particular
significance when considering ethnic
groups of low prevalence in the U.K. For
example, Pendharkar et al. (31) found
people of M¯
aori and Pacific ethnicity
had an incidence of diabetes following
pancreatitis that was three times that of
people with New Zealand European ethnic-
ity. It islikely that our findingsregarding the
glycemic control and insulin requirements
of those with diabetes following pancreatic
disease relate to the pathophysiology of
diabetes of the exocrine pancreas and so
can be generalized. A limitation of these
findings is the varied availability of HbA1c
data for patients. Data were missing for
13.6% of cases of diabetes following pan-
creatic disease at 1 year and for 13.7% of
cases at 5 years (Supplementary Table 1).
The absence of HbA1c data was adjusted
for as a potential confounder in the logistic
regression models.
Our study indicates that many people
with diabetes of the exocrine pancreas
are currently misdiagnosed. We found
that only 2.7% of people with diabetes
following pancreatic disease are diag-
nosed with diabetes of the exocrine pan-
creas. Most patients were labeled type 2
diabetes, despite a sevenfold increased
insulin requirement within 5 years, by
which time 45.8% of patients with diabe-
tes following chronic pancreatic disease
are using insulin. Ewald et al. (1) used di-
agnostic criteria, including the presence
of both exocrine pancreatic dysfunction
and pathological pancreatic imaging, to ret-
rospectivelyidentifydiabetesoftheexocrine
pancreas in their hospital’s inpatients and
found 49% were initially misclassified.
Whether all diabetes that develops fol-
lowing pancreatic disease should be man-
aged according to recommendations for
diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (32) or
whether some patients would be appro-
priate for standard type 1 or type 2 dia-
betes management pathways is an area
that requires further study. In our popu-
lation, people with type 2 diabetes and peo-
ple with diabetes following pancreatic
disease were both most frequently diag-
nosed with diabetes between the ages of
50 and 69 years and at a BMI ($30.0
kg/m2) compatible with obesity. This
may partially explain why diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas is often mistaken
for type 2 diabetes. However, a higher
percentage of people with diabetes fol-
lowing pancreatic disease were diag-
nosed when younger than 50 years old
and at a BMI compatible with being un-
derweight (,18.5 kg/m2) or at a healthy
weight ($18.5–24.9 kg/m2), and it is not
possible to tell from our retrospective
study whether diagnosis was more com-
mon at higher age and BMI because this
was the context in which diabetes first
developed, or because of another factor
such as more frequent screening for di-
abetes in that demographic.
Acute pancreatitis was the most com-
mon pancreatic disease preceding diabe-
tes in our population. This may be the
result of a higher background prevalence
of acute pancreatitis than the other pan-
creatic diseases. Considering the variety
of pathological processes that cause pan-
creatic injury, diabetes of the exocrine
pancreas is likely to be heterogeneous in
nature. Patients may lie along a spectrum
ranging from those with an underlying
predisposition toward type 2 diabe-
tes, in whom an additional pancreatic in-
sult becomes diabetogenic, to those in
whom a total pancreatectomy removes
all endogenous insulin production. There
is some evidence that the greater the se-
verity of pancreatic damage the greater
the failure of insulin production (33,34).
In our study, diabetes following acute
pancreatitis displayed HbA1c levels
equivalent to those of diabetes following
chronic pancreatic disease but was asso-
ciated with a lower rate of insulin use. A
possible explanation for this could be that
although acute pancreatitis alters insulin
production (33), diabetes following acute
pancreatitis involves comparatively less
failure of insulin production and more in-
sulin resistance than diabetes following
chronic pancreatic disease. One study of
acute pancreatitis found HOMA-insulin
resistance levels (a calculation of insulin
resistance) had a stronger association
with the presence of prediabetes or dia-
betes than did the HOMA-%b reduction
(a calculation of b-cell function) (35). We
note that the pathways that result in
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and di-
abetes of the exocrine pancreas need not
be mutually exclusive. When adipocyto-
kines implicated in the development of
type 2 diabetes were studied as a possible
mechanism for chronic hyperglycemia
after acute pancreatitis, a suggested role
was found for interleukin-6 (36). Clinical
differences should not be disregarded,
however, because we found diabetes fol-
lowing acute pancreatitis had significantly
worse glycemic control (at 1 year and
5 years) and higher rates of insulin pre-
scription than type 2 diabetes.
The combination of increased likeli-
hood of poor glycemic control and
accelerated requirement for insulin sug-
gests that patients with diabetes follow-
ing pancreatic disease may benefit from
more frequent review than is normally
necessitated in type 2 diabetes. Given
the complexity of both classifying and
managing diabetes following pancreatic
disease, these patients may benefit from
management in a specialist setting or
with multidisciplinary dietitian and gas-
troenterology input. However, it is not
possible from our observational study to
draw inferences about whether the in-
creased likelihood of poor glycemic
control could be prevented with more
frequent recognition of diabetes of the
exocrine pancreas or whether compara-
tively poor glycemic control is unavoidable
as a result of the underlying pathophysiol-
ogy.Interventionalstudiesmayhelptoelu-
cidate the risk-benefit profile of various
antihyperglycemic agents and whether
more frequent review reduces complica-
tions or hospitalizations.
In summary, diabetes that develops
following pancreatic disease is signifi-
cantly associated with poor glycemic con-
trol and early insulin therapy but is rarely
identified as diabetes ofthe exocrine pan-
creas. Clinicians should elicit whether a
patient has any history of pancreatic dis-
ease when they first present with diabe-
tes and consider the diagnosis of diabetes
of the exocrine pancreas. Diabetes of
the exocrine pancreas must be appropri-
ately recognized to tailor management,
including choice of antihyperglycemic
therapy, and consideration of malabsorp-
tion requiring pancreatic enzyme and vi-
tamin D prescription. Greater awareness
