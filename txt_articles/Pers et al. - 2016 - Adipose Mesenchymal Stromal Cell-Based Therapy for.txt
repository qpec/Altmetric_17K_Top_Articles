ABSTRACT
Osteoarthritis (OA)isthemost widespreadmusculoskeletaldisorder in adults. It leads to
cartilage damage associated with subchondral bone changes and synovial inflamma-
tion, causing pain and disability. The present study aimed at evaluating the safety of
a dose-escalation protocol of intra-articular injected adipose-derived stromal cells
(ASCs) in patients with knee OA, as well as clinical efficacy as secondary endpoint. A
bicentric, uncontrolled, open phase I clinical trial was conducted in France and Germany
with regulatory agency approval for ASC expansion procedure in both countries. From
April 2012 to December 2013, 18 consecutive patients with symptomatic and severe
knee OA were treated with a single intra-articular injection of autologous ASCs. The
study design consisted of three consecutive cohorts (six patients each) with dose esca-
lation: low dose (2 3 106 cells), medium dose (10 3 106), and high dose (50 3 106). The
primary outcome parameter was safety evaluated by recording adverse events through-
out the trial, and secondary parameters were pain and function subscales of the West-
ern Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index. After 6 months of follow-up, the
procedure was found to be safe, and no serious adverse events were reported. Four pa-
tients experienced transient knee joint pain and swelling after local injection. Interest-
ingly, patients treated with low-dose ASCs experienced significant improvements in
pain levels and function compared with baseline. Our data suggest that the intra-
articular injection of ASCs is a safe therapeutic alternative to treat severe knee OA pa-
tients. A placebo-controlled double-blind phase IIb study is being initiated to assess clin-
ical and structural efficacy. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2016;5:847–856
SIGNIFICANCE
Although this phase I study included a limited number of patients without a placebo
arm, it showed that local injection of autologous adipose-derived stem cells was safe
and well tolerated in patients with knee osteoarthritis. This study also provides en-
couraging preliminary evidence of efficacy. Larger and controlled long-term studies
are now mandatory to confirm whether this new strategy of cell therapy can improve
pain and induce structural benefit in osteoarthritis.
INTRODUCTION
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial, slowly
progressive degenerative disorder of the
joints leading to irreversible damage of the
cartilage, sclerosis of subchondral bone, and
synovial inflammation [1]. As a consequence
of increasing longevity and obesity, the cost
of OA to the health care system rapidly
grows. Current treatment strategies have
no impact on the progressive degeneration
of joint tissues. In this context, the use of
mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) is
an attractive therapeutic option thanks to

 their chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory properties [2]. Adipose
tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) share similar properties with bone
marrow-derived MSCs but are easier to collect for clinical applica-
tion, with higher isolation yields. Indeed, intra-articular (IA) injec-
tion of ASCs prevented OA onset in a collagenase-induced murine
knee OA model and reduced synovitis, osteophyte formation, and
cartilage degeneration [3]. Furthermore, intra-articular injection
of 2 or 6 million autologous ASCs improved the cartilage degrada-
tionscoreandsignificantlyreducedkneesynovitisinabiomechan-
ical induced OA rabbit model [4].
Using an established Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
procedure based on ASCs expanded for 2 weeks in the presence
of platelet lysate [5], we conducted a proof-of-concept phase I
clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of intra-articular
injection of autologous ASCs in patients with active and severe
knee OA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
A phase I, prospective, bicentric, single-arm, open-label, dose-
escalating clinical trial of a single injection of autologous ASCs
in patients with severe primary knee OA was conducted from
March 2012 to April 2014 in two hospitals: CHRU Montpellier
(France) and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Uni-
versity of W¨
urzburg (Germany). No placebo group was scheduled
because of ethical issues (including late-stage knee OA patients
associated with liposuction procedure without active therapy
benefit). The study protocol was approved by the local ethics
committees of both institutions (Comit´
e de Protection des Per-
sonnes of Montpellier [UF8606-120203] and Ethik-Kommission
bei der Medizinischen of W¨
urzburg) and by the national compe-
tent authorities (TC301; EudraCT no. 2011-000183-10).
Patient Selection and Enrollment
A total of 48 outpatients with knee OA were screened (Fig. 1).
Eighteen consecutive patients with primary femorotibial knee
OA diagnosed according to the clinical and radiological criteria
of the American College of Rheumatology were enrolled in this
study after written informed consent was obtained [6].
Inclusion Criteria
Patients 50–75 years of age with symptomatic primary knee OA
and radiographic changes of grade 3 to 4 according to the
Kellgren-Lawrence scale in the targeted knee were included [7].
To obtain histologic analysis for safety issues, the medical board
required end-stage knee OA patients with an indication of knee
prosthesis in the year after inclusion. Symptomatic primary knee
OA was defined by daily knee pain for at least 12 months before
study inclusion.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients were excluded if they had secondary arthritis (related to
rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, previous articular frac-
tures, postinfectious arthritis, and crystal arthropathies), autoim-
mune disorders, or previous malignancies in the past 5 years.
Previous administration of oral/intra-articular corticosteroids
and injection of hyaluronic acid derivatives within 6 months be-
fore screening examination were also exclusion criteria.
Treatment Allocation
Eligible patients were consecutively allocated to the treatment
groups, three arms with different doses (2 3 106, 10 3 106,
and 50 3 106 cells) (Fig. 1). The starting dose of 2 3 106 cells
has been defined based on the No Observed Adverse Effect Level
obtained after IA administration determined in preclinical studies

 performed in goat and rabbit models of OA, adjusted by allome-
tric factors (weight and size of the knee joint compared with hu-
man) [4] (data not shown).
First, thepatientsunderwentoutpatient liposuction underlo-
calanesthesia,andautologousASCswereproducedandprepared
at a single GMP facility (Etablissement Français du Sang Midi-
Pyr´
enn´
ees, France), as summarized in the supplemental online
data. Fourteen days after isolation, ASCs were recovered and un-
derwent defined quality control before shipping (supplemental
online data). A single IA dose of ASCs was injected into the knee
joint (volume, 5 ml) under ultrasound control.
Cell Preparation and Expansion of ASCs
The procedure has been described [5]. The stromal vascular
fraction (SVF) was obtained by means of collagenase digestion. Al-
iquots of 10 g of adipose tissue were mixed with 34 ml of
collagenase solution (NB6; Coger, Paris, France, http://www.
cogerbio.com) and incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes. Enzymatic di-
gestion was stopped by the addition of complete culture medium
(CCM) containing minimum essential medium (MacoPharma,
Tourcoing, France, http://www.macopharma.com), human plate-
let growth factor-enriched plasma, 10 mg/ml ciprofloxacin,
and 1U/mlheparin.After homogenization, thedigested suspen-
sion was passed through sterile 100-mm filters. The cells were
centrifuged at room temperature for 10 minutes at 600g. The
supernatant was discarded, and the SVF was resuspended in
20 ml ofCCM.An aliquotof theSVF was removed for qualitycon-
trol: cell count, viability, phenotyping (CD34, CD45, and CD14),
and sterility.
Cells from the SVF were then seeded in a 1,270-cm2 CellStack
culture chamber (MacoPharma) at a density of 4 3 103 cells per
cm2 in CCM, by use of a seeding kit (MacoPharma), at 37°C in an
atmosphere saturated with moisture and 5% CO2. After an initial
24-hour incubation, the nonadherent cells were removed. The
adherent cells were washed once with Dulbecco’s phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), and CCM medium was added for 7 days.
Themediumwascompletelyreplacedatdays4and6ofculturewith
the use of medium exchange kits (MacoPharma). At day 8 (primary
culture, P0), the cells were harvested with the use of a detachment
kit (MacoPharma) according to the following protocol. After aspi-
ration of the medium and washing with Dulbecco’s PBS, 50 ml
of irradiated trypsin solution was added for 5 minutes at room
temperature. After inhibition of trypsin activity by the addition
ofCCM, thecellswerecollected ina transferbag (MacoPharma).
Analiquotofthecellsuspensionwasasepticallyremovedforcell
count, viability, phenotyping (CD34, CD45, and CD14), measures
of hTERT messenger RNA contents by quantitative reverse-
transcription polymerase chain reaction, and assessment of
microbial testing.
The cells were seeded in 1,270-cm2 CellStack culture cham-
bers at a density of 2 3 103 cells per cm2 and incubated for 6 days.
The CCM was completely replaced at days 11 and 13. At day 11,
an aliquot of culture medium was aseptically removed for my-
coplasma and endotoxin testing. At day 14, the cells were har-
vested according to the procedure described above. The cell
suspension was placed in a transfer bag (MacoPharma) and
washed with Dulbecco’s PBS. The ASCs were then resus-
pended in a solution containing 3.6% human albumin (pro-
vided by Laboratoire Français du Fractionnement et des
Biotechnologies, Courtaboeuf, France) and a polyionic solu-
tion containing glucose. An aliquot of the ASC suspension
was aseptically removed for cell count, and its quality was
evaluated as described above.
Flow cytometry analyses were performed as follows. Briefly,
ASCs (2 3 105 cells) were stained with saturating amounts of

Release Criteria of ASCs
Release criteria were defined as negative for microbial testing
on SVF, intermediate product (P0), and final product (P1);
negative for mycoplasma testing on adipose tissue and cul-
ture medium at day 11; endotoxin testing negative on culture
medium at day 11; and absence of hTERT detection by quan-
titative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction on

than 2%, and for mesenchymal markers, higher than 90%
for CD90 and CD73 and higher than 80% for CD105. The per-
centage of positive cells for CD34 had to be less than 10%.
Karyotype analyses were performed, on final product, for
15 productions. Because of the time required for performing
the karyotype analysis, results were obtained after release.
Karyotype analyses revealed no clonal abnormalities. Results

Outcome Measures
Primary Endpoint
Incidence, relatedness, and severity of treatment-emergent sus-
pected unexpected serious adverse reactions, serious adverse
events, and adverse events (AEs) were documented at each visit
throughout the study. Laboratory tests (hematology, blood chem-
istry, and urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations of the
patients were assessed systematically. A 12-week safety period
was implemented between subject 1 and subject 2 of the first co-
hort receiving the low dose, and the safety medical board autho-
rized continuation with patients 2 to 6. A further 4-week safety
period was scheduled between the other two cohorts.
Secondary Endpoints
Secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed by measuring the
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index
(WOMAC), pain visual analog scale (VAS), the Patient Global As-
sessment (PGA), the Short Arthritis Assessment Scale (SAS), and
the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS index)
[8]. A 0- to 100-mm VAS was used to assess WOMAC pain (5 ques-
tions),physicalfunction(17questions),andstiffness(2questions)
subscales. Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI)/
Outcome Measures in Rheumatology response was defined as
20% improvement compared with baseline VAS and WOMAC
[9]. Quality of life was measured by the short-form 36 (SF-36)
questionnaire [10].
Secondary imaging endpoints included delayed gadolinium-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC)
and T1rho MRI for selected German patients at 3–4 months after
ASC injection [11]. MRIs were evaluated by a radiologist blinded
to the administered dose. dGEMRIC and T1rho maps were motion
corrected and zerofilled and then derived using anatomical land-
marks and an automated fit algorithm [12].
Histology
Upon request of the ethics committee, a total knee arthroplasty
(TKA) was originally scheduled 3 months after ASC injection for all
patients to obtain histologic analysis. However, if a patient re-
fused TKA, knee arthroscopy with biopsy could be performed.
No standardized protocol was planned for biopsies. Cartilage
and synovial samples were fixed for 24 hours in 10% neutral for-
mol and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5-mm thickness were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, or Toluidine
blue. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Benchmark Ul-
tra Ventana automat with the following antibodies: protein S100
(1:3,200, polyclonal; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, http://www.dako.
com), CD34 (1:100, QBEND/10; Dako), and Ki67 (1:100, mono-
clonal mouse, clone Mib-1; Dako). The OARSI cartilage OA histo-
pathology grading system was performed by an experienced
anatomopathologist who was blinded to the treatments [13].
Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as mean 6 SD. The significance of differ-
ences was assessed by Wilcoxon test or one-way analysis of var-
iance and corresponding nonparametric tests. A value of p , .05
was considered statistically significant. All analyses were per-
formed using GraphPad Prism software version 6.0 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, http://www.graphpad.com).
RESULTS
Characteristics of Patients
All three cohorts had similar baseline characteristics for age, sex,
and body mass index, and 83% of patients were grade IV on the
Kellgren-Lawrence scale (Table 1). Eleven patients were included
in France and seven in Germany. Baseline levels for pain and func-
tion (WOMAC, KOOS, SAS scores) were different between the co-
horts (Table 1). Disease activity at baseline was higher in the
group of patients injected with the low dose of ASCs, with higher
VAS and WOMAC values. All patients completed the 6-month
follow-up. Only one patient with persistent joint swelling and
knee pain underwent TKA surgery at 6 months.
Safety and Tolerance Profile of IA Injection of
Autologous ASCs
No AE associated with liposuction and IA injection was observed in
thisstudy(Table2).NoseriousinfectiousAEsrelatedtoASCinjection

ASC injection. The patient’s risk factors included hypertension and
hyperlipidemia. Five minor AEs reported by four patients were

 potentially related to the procedure: slight knee pain/joint ef-
fusion occurred during the first week after ASC injection that
resolved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in three
patients and spontaneously (without medication) in one patient
(Table 2).
Otherwise, a small increase in creatinine phosphokinase was
observed in two patients and in alanine aminotransferase in one
patient. There was also a milddecrease of neutrophil count in one
patient who presented with a low baseline count (1,500/mm3)
and high variability of neutrophil count, independent of IA injec-
tion, during follow-up.
Efficacy Profile of Autologous ASC Injection on OA
Clinical Outcomes
Mean changes from baseline to 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months in
clinical outcomes are summarized in Table 3. Improvement for all
clinical outcome parameters (pain, function, and mobility) regard-
less of the injected dose was observed (Fig. 2). However, statistical
significance was detected only for patients treated with the low
dose. Finally, all patients except one refused to have the previ-
ously scheduled TKA.
MRI Evaluation
Among the 7 patients included in Germany, quantitative dGEM-
RIC (6 patients) and T1rho (5 patients) maps were acquired and
analyzed before and 4 months after therapy (Fig. 3). In these
parameter maps, the dGEMRIC index increased in three se-
lected patients with time, whereas the T1rho values decreased
at the same time. For the other three patients, the opposite
effect was observed. Thus, the positive changes were only lim-
ited and suggested a possible cartilage improvement in three
of six patients. In conclusion, within this small number of pa-
tients, we did not observe any correlation between MRI and
clinical changes.
Histologic Analysis
Histologic analysis of cartilage and synovium at 3 months was
available for 11 of 18 patients after arthroscopy. All samples
showed signs of severe OA (OARSI histologic grading .3). Oste-
oarthritic chondrocytes stained positive for PS100 and negative
forCD34orKi67(Fig.4).Significantsynovialinflammationwasab-
sent in two cases, whereas weak or moderate inflammation and
synovial hyperplasia with diffuseinterstitial lymphocytic infiltrate
were observed in five and four cases, respectively. In one pa-
tient (case 2) who received a low dose of ASCs, we observed a
sheet of cells that could be interpreted as a stem cell graft on
cartilage surface (Fig. 4). These cells showed rare Ki67 nuclear
staining and weak PS100 staining and were CD34 negative. Fi-
nally, none of the synovial or cartilage samples showed any
tumor proliferation.

 DISCUSSION
This pilot trial reached its predetermined primary outcome pa-
rameters, i.e., safety of IA injection of ASCs in patients with knee
OA. Our results are similar to those reported from other studies,
incritical limb ischemia orfistulae in inflammatory bowel disease,
where ASCs have been injected locally without reported side ef-
fects [5, 14]. Additionally, we report clinical improvement with a
reduction in pain levels and WOMAC score in all three groups,
even though statistically significant results were obtained only
in the low-dose group. Actually, the large variability in the range
of the initial clinical parameters as well as the limited sample size
may explain why statistical significance was not reached at 6
months. However, when compared with historical control stud-
ies, our approach seems very encouraging. For example, in a thor-
oughly double-blind study on hyaluronic acid treatment into the
knee, the WOMAC pain score decreased by 22.9 6 1.4 mm be-
tween baseline and 6 months [15]. In the present study, WOMAC
pain score decreased by 30.7 6 10.7 mm in the group receiving
low-dose ASCs. Furthermore, the average difference from base-
line to 6 months on the WOMAC subscale scores (pain, function,
and stiffness) is higher than the recommended minimal percep-
tible clinical improvement of 10 mm [16]. Additionally, a study
comparing hyaluronic acid with saline solution reported 54.6%
OARSI responders in the saline group after 13 weeks [17]. This
score is lower than the OARSI response obtained with the three
different ASC doses at the same time point in the present study,
with 83.3% in low-dose, 60% in medium-dose, and 60% in high-
dose groups. In a recent controlled study with steroid as compar-
ator, the magnitude of the placebo effect led to a decrease in
WOMAC pain score of 20 mm at 6 months versus baseline [18].
They recorded 52.1% OARSI responders at 6 months, which is
lower than obtained in our groups. These studies suggest that
ASC therapy might be more efficient than a possible placebo
effect.
Our results are also consistent with those obtained in a recent
studyinpatientswithalargerheterogeneityinageandlesssevere
forms of OA [11]. In a recent similar study from Jo et al., the high-
est efficiency was found at the highest dose (100 3 106 cells) in
patients whopresented the highest levels of pain atbaseline (VAS
and WOMAC) [19]. In our study, the group of patients injected
with 2 3 106 cells exhibited the best response to ASC treatment,
whereas they had higher baseline pain and WOMAC scores com-
pared with those receiving higher doses. One possible reason for

 level of pain at baseline. The inflammatory milieu might have
primed the injected ASCs to exert their immunomodulatory func-
tions more efficiently than in the groups where the inflammation
was lower. We therefore cannot rule out that the treatment re-
sponse was partly dependent on the initial disease activity.
Orozco et al. published another interesting study on the treat-
ment of knee OA with autologous MSCs derived from bone mar-
row [20]. They injected 40 3 106 cells into the knee joint.
Improvement of cartilage morphology and quality was observed
in almost all patients using MRI T2 mapping, suggesting a possible
structural benefit of stem cell therapy.
The potential mode of action of ASCs for the treatment of OA
includes at least three different biological effects. The first is di-
rect differentiation of ASCs into chondrocytes, whereas the
others are related to a possible paracrine effect of secreted
bioactive molecules, including anti-inflammatory and chondro-
protective mediators. However, the capacity of MSCs to differen-
tiate into chondrocytes is probably not critical in the observed
therapeutic effect. Preliminary studies in rabbits and goats have
shown that cartilage regeneration did not occur at the expense of
chondrogenic differentiation of the injected cells but may be
strongly related to a secondary stimulation of endogenous pro-
genitor cells through paracrine effects [21]. MSCs contributed
to the repair of damaged articular cartilage through homing,
engraftment, production of cartilage matrix, and reduction of lo-
cal inflammation [22–25]. Stromal cells have been shown to pos-
sess immunomodulatory and antifibrotic properties, to protect
cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis, and to stimulate prolif-
eration and chondrogenic differentiation in coculture through se-
cretion of growth factors [23]. In preclinical models of OA or
experimental models of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis
and experimental encephalitis, the benefit of ASC injection was
related to secretion of anti-inflammatory factors including hepa-
tocytegrowthfactor,humanleukocyteantigenG5,orinterleukin-
1 receptor antagonist [26]. The immunomodulatory properties of
adipose-derived MSCs are even stronger than those from other
tissuesources[27].Whether theinvitrocapabilities ofMSCsfrom
different tissue sources reflect the in vivo situation has still to be
elucidated. Nevertheless, there is an obvious variation among do-
nors that could be related to differences in isolation, expansion,
and freezing/thawing procedures. Altogether, these data suggest
that MSCs can reduce synovitis and favor an appropriate environ-
ment for tissue regeneration through expression of active growth
factors or recruitment of endogenous progenitors.
CONCLUSION
Although this phase I study included a limited number of patients
without a placebo arm, we were able to show that this innovative
treatment was safe and well tolerated in patients with knee OA.
We also provided encouraging preliminary evidence of efficacy.
Larger and controlled long-term studies are now mandatory to
confirm whether this new strategy of cell therapy can improve
pain and induce structural benefit. Moreover, it is likely that sim-
ilar therapeutic procedures based on autologous ASCs can be
extended in the future to other joints, such as the hip joint, or in-
dications such as intervertebral disc degeneration.
