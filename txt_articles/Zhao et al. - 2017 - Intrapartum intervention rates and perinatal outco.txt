Background: Induction of labor (IOL) is a common obstetric intervention, yet its 
impact on intervention rates and perinatal outcomes is conflicting.
Aims: To evaluate the impact of IOL on intrapartum intervention rates and peri-
natal outcomes in women with singleton pregnancies at term.
Material and methods: This was a retrospective, cross- 
sectional study of term 
singleton deliveries at the Mater Mother’s Hospital in Brisbane, Australia in 2007–
2013. The IOL cohort was compared to an expectantly managed group.
Results: Of the final cohort (44 698 women), 64.4% had expectant management 
and 35.6% had IOL. Multivariate analyses showed that IOL was associated with 
lower odds of spontaneous vaginal delivery from ≥37 weeks gestation. The risk of 
emergency caesarean for non- 
reassuring fetal status was also higher in the IOL 
cohort at 40 and 41 weeks gestation. For women who were managed expect-
antly, the highest rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery and the lowest rate of 
emergency caesareans occurred at 39 weeks gestation. For women who under-
went IOL, the nadir emergency caesarean rate and the highest spontaneous vagi-
nal delivery rate was also at 39 weeks. Rates of neonatal intensive car unit 
admission were higher in the IOL group at 37 weeks (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
3.11, 95% CI: 2.62–3.68) and 38 weeks (aOR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.55–2.04) and lower at 
>42 weeks (OR 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14–0.81) respectively.
Conclusion: IOL compared to expectant management is associated with lower 
spontaneous vaginal delivery rates and increased risk of emergency caesarean 
for intrapartum fetal compromise with broadly comparable perinatal outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Induction of labor (IOL) is a common obstetric intervention in 
many countries. In 2011, the rate of IOL was 23.2% in the state 
of Queensland and 26% in Australia.1 Globally, IOL accounts for 
more than 20% of all births in the United States and England2 and 
almost one in three births in some parts of Europe.3 The most 
common indication for IOL is prolonged pregnancy, mainly to ob-
viate some of the increased risks associated with post- 
term preg-
nancies4 with many international guidelines now recommending 
IOL between 41 and 42 weeks.5–7 Regardless of this, many women 
undergo IOL between 37 and 42 weeks for a variety of reasons,

including pre- 
labour rupture of membranes, diabetes mellitus or 
hypertension, previous poor obstetric outcome and increasingly 
for social reasons.
Although a recent Cochrane review8 as well as several other 
publications provide good evidence that IOL in the late tem and 
post- 
term cohort improves certain perinatal outcomes,4,8–11 the 
evidence is less clear for pregnancies <41 weeks gestation.12 This 
is important as there is increasing evidence that early term de-
livery (37–38 weeks) is associated with a higher risk of adverse 
neonatal and childhood outcomes compared with birth later at 
term.13 Nevertheless, in broad terms,14 term IOL appears to result 
in reduced odds of caesarean delivery regardless of parity and im-
proved perinatal outcomes.14–16 However, the available data tends 
to aggregate intrapartum intervention into broad categories with-
out more detailed sub- 
analyses. In particular, data regarding the 
indication for emergency caesarean section is often lacking. Given 
this background, we aimed to examine the relationship between 
IOL and intrapartum intervention rates; specifically, intervention 
for non- 
reassuring fetal status and associated perinatal outcomes 
between an IOL cohort and one managed expectantly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective, cohort study at the Mater Mothers’ 
Hospital in Australia between January 2007 and December 2013 
using previous prospectively collected data from the institution’s 
maternal and perinatal database. The Mater Mothers’ Hospital 
is the largest maternity hospital in Australia and a major tertiary 
centre in the state of Queensland. Ethics and governance ap-
proval were granted by the institution’s Human Research Ethics 
Committee (Reference number HREC/14/MHS/63). All women 
with non- 
anomalous, singleton pregnancies ≥37 weeks were eli-
gible for inclusion in this study. Exclusion criteria included gesta-
tion <37 weeks, multiple pregnancy, and women with planned 
caesarean section, known aneuploidy or genetic syndrome. 
Gestational age was calculated from either the last menstrual 
period or the earliest ultrasound examination, or correlation 
with both.
Maternal demographic data and perinatal outcome data 
were collected from the hospital’s maternity database and cross- 
referenced with the maternal and fetal medicine and neonatol-
ogy databases. Demographic data collected included maternal 
age, parity, body mass index (BMI), indication for IOL, maternal 
medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension/pre- 
eclampsia), eth-
nicity and insurance status. Intrapartum outcomes and neonatal 
variables assessed included length of labour, method of birth and 
indication for emergency caesarean section. Perinatal outcome 
data included gestation at delivery to the nearest week, birth 
weight, Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, cord artery 
pH < 7 or lactate >6 mmol/L, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress, 
seizure, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and neona-
tal death up to 28 days.
As some women who were expectantly managed could have 
delivered within the same week, and that to exclude these women 
might artificially inflate the benefit of induction of labour on cae-
sarean section, we chose to use as our comparator only women 
delivering at or beyond the gestation of induction of labour (Fig. 
2). This method of analysis has previously been recommended for 
evaluation of outcomes following IOL.17
Statistics
Statistical analysis for this study was performed using the R and the 
R commander program (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria). Normally distributed variables were compared 
using a two- 
sample t- 
test. Non- 
normally distributed variables were 
compared using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Frequencies were com-
pared using a χ2 test or Fisher exact test if frequencies were less than 
or equal to five. The level of significance was set at 0.05. Summary 
statistics are reported as mean (standard deviation (SD)) or median 
(interquartile range (IQR)) for continuous normally distributed and 
non- 
normally distributed data, respectively. The effect of IOL was 
reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all 
parameters of perinatal outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis was performed to determine the impact of induction of la-
bour on emergency caesarean rates and perinatal outcomes.
RESULTS
During the study period, there were 68 054 births at Mater 
Mothers’ Hospital. Of these, 9449 (13.9%) were excluded due 
to multiple pregnancy and birth <37 weeks. A further 13 904 
(20.4%) births were excluded due to planned caesareans before 
onset of labour. Three women were also excluded for having in-
complete birth outcome data, leaving 44 698 women in the final 
study cohort (Fig. 1). Women were classified into IOL and expect-
ant management groups for each gestational age. The IOL cohort 
comprised of 15 894/44 698 women who underwent induction at 
a given gestational week. The expectant management cohort con-
sisted of women who had spontaneous labour at or beyond that 
particular gestational week, plus women who underwent induc-
tion of labour at a later gestational week (Fig. 2).
Compared to the whole cohort, women who had IOL were 
more likely to be older, of Caucasian ethnicity, privately in-
sured and nulliparous. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension/pre- 
eclampsia were more prevalent in the IOL group (Table 1). The 
most common indications for IOL were prolonged pregnancies 
≥41 weeks, pre- 
labour rupture of membranes, advanced mater-
nal age and social reasons (Table 2).
Intrapartum outcomes
Following multivariate analyses controlling for maternal age, BMI, 
birth weight, parity, diabetes and hypertension/pre- 
eclampsia, 
 42 
Intrapartum intervention rates following induction of labour at term
gestational age and insurance status, IOL was associated with 
lower odds of spontaneous vaginal delivery from ≥37 weeks ges-
tation. Furthermore, it was associated with higher odds of instru-
mental delivery from 37 to 40 weeks gestation and for emergency 
caesarean delivery from 37 to 41 weeks. The risk of emergency 
caesarean for non- 
reassuring fetal status (‘fetal distress’) was also 
higher in the IOL cohort at 40 and 41 weeks gestation. The odds 
of emergency caesarean section for failure to progress were sim-
ilarly elevated in the IOL cohort from 37 to 41 weeks gestation 
(Table 3).
Perinatal outcomes
Broadly overall, there were no significant differences in most peri-
natal outcomes between the two groups. Rates of NICU admission 
were higher in the IOL group at 37 weeks (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.11, 
95% CI: 2.62–3.68) and 38 weeks (aOR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.55–2.04) and 
lower at ≥42 weeks (aOR 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14–0.81) respectively. 
There were no differences in neonatal mortality rates between 
both groups at any gestation. Acidosis at birth was also lower in 
the IOL cohort at 38, 39 and 40 weeks (Table 4).
Figure 3 illustrates rates of various methods of birth in each 
gestation week for both the IOL and expectant management 
group. Note that significant differences between two groups all 
arise after 39 weeks.
DISCUSSION
The key and perhaps somewhat controversial finding from this 
study is the observation that compared to expectant manage-
ment, IOL at term is associated with a decreased incidence of 
spontaneous vaginal delivery and an overall increased risk of 
emergency caesarean, particularly for non- 
reassuring fetal sta-
tus and failure to progress. The risk of caesarean birth for non- 
reassuring fetal status was almost doubled at 41 weeks in the IOL 
group. Although overall vaginal delivery rates (spontaneous vagi-
nal and instrumental) were high in both groups, after multivariate

FIGURE 2 Methods. At each gestation in the induction of labour (IOL) cohort, the comparison group (expectant management 
cohort) consisted of women who either had spontaneous labour at or beyond that gestation as well as those who were induced at a 
later gestation. This methodology was modified from a recent review article.17

logistic regression, IOL was still associated with lower rates of 
spontaneous vaginal delivery from 37 gestational weeks and on-
wards. However, reassuringly, our results also indicate that IOL 
was not associated with overall poorer perinatal outcomes de-
spite the higher operative delivery rates.
In spite of our relatively large sample size from a single in-
stitution, our results are at variance with other, often cited 
publications14,15 which show that IOL is not associated with in-
creased rates of caesarean section. However, there are some 
differences between our study and that of Darney et al.14 who 
compared caesarean section rates following elective non- 
medically indicated IOL and found that it was associated with a 
lower risk of caesarean birth for each gestational week between 
37 and 40 weeks. In contrast, our study analysed all cases of IOL at 
term regardless of indication. Given that a proportion of women 
in our cohort were induced for medical reasons such as hyper-
tension/pre- 
eclampsia or diabetes mellitus, it is possible that this 
may have resulted in higher rates of intrapartum fetal compro-
mise. Stock et al.15 in a large study from Scotland found that al-
though caesarean rates at or beyond the gestation for IOL were 
increased from 37 to 41 weeks, after multivariate analysis this re-
lationship remained significant only from 40 to 41 weeks.
Clearly any estimate of the relationship between IOL and 
obstetric intervention may be biased because of confounding 
due to indications for induction. Danilack et al.18 in a recent 
publication used propensity scoring to assess the risk of IOL on 
caesarean delivery and found that before matching, IOL was gen-
erally associated with a higher rate of primary caesarean birth. 
However, after controlling for demographic factors, maternal 
conditions and other pregnancy complications, IOL was associ-
ated with a reduced risk at 34–39 weeks and an elevated risk at 
40–42 weeks. A secondary analysis of the HYPITAT and DIGITAT

Intrapartum intervention rates following induction of labour at term
trials showed that there was no evidence that IOL increased the 
rates of caesarean section or adverse neonatal outcomes com-
pared with expectant management in a cohort of women with 
an unfavourable cervix (Bishop’s Score <3) at commencement of 
induction.19 In contrast, another study of women with diabetes20 
demonstrated that caesarean rates were higher in multiparous 
women with unfavourable cervices at particular term gestations 
(aOR 7.47 95% CI 1.6–34.8).
Previous studies have not always controlled for confounding 
factors that could influence obstetric outcomes and indeed one re-
cent systematic review pointed out that most observational studies 
did not even control for something as basic as gestational age.12 In 
our study, we performed multivariate logistic regression controlling 
for maternal age, BMI, parity, diabetes/hypertension, gestational 
age and insurance status, and yet still found an elevated risk of 
emergency caesarean delivery for both non- 
reassuring fetal status

Intrapartum intervention rates following induction of labour at term
and failure to progress from 37 to 41 weeks gestation. Methods for 
IOL can also be a confounding variable in the analysis of caesar-
ean rates. One meta- 
analysis from China found that the use of oral 
misoprostol was associated with lower caesarean section rates.16 
Moreover, a study in Canada found that non- 
biomedical factors 
such as income, being uninsured, day of delivery and immigration 
class also affects the rate of emergency caesareans.21
We also found that women who were managed expectantly, 
the highest rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery and the lowest 
rate of emergency caesareans occurred at 39 weeks gestation. 
For women who underwent IOL, the nadir emergency caesarean 
rate and the highest spontaneous vaginal delivery rate was also 
at 39 weeks (Fig. 3). Importantly, the emergency caesarean sec-
tion rate for non- 
reassuring fetal status appeared to diverge more 
sharply upward from 39 weeks gestation. Furthermore, it appears 
that maternal and infant outcomes are also optimal in women un-
dergoing IOL at this gestation.22 Thus, this observation may have 
clinical implications as it implies that intrapartum and birth out-
comes may be optimized by scheduling IOL around 38–39 weeks 
gestation (Figs 3, 4).

Although IOL is a very common obstetric management and 
generally considered to be safe, there is an inherent concern 
among many obstetric healthcare providers that it increases the 
risk of caesarean birth. Certainly, observational studies compar-
ing IOL to spontaneous labour do demonstrate an increased risk 
of caesareans in the IOL cohort.22–25 However, when the compar-
ator is women managed expectantly, the converse is found with 
lower or no different rates of caesarean delivery between both 
groups.8,14,26–28 From a clinical perspective, using an expectantly 
managed cohort is more appropriate because the only relevant 
choice for women and healthcare providers is either IOL or not, 
as a woman cannot be in spontaneous labour when faced with 
that management option. In a recent publication, Danilack et al.29 
using 166 559 mother- 
newborn dyads, found that after con-
trolling for confounders, IOL was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of caesarean birth compared to a spontaneous 
labour cohort for weeks 37–41 but only for weeks 40–41 when 
compared to an expectantly managed cohort. We too found that 
the highest rate of emergency caesarean delivery occurred at 
40–41 weeks gestation.
There are several potential limitations in our study. This was 
a retrospective study using previous prospectively collected data, 
which has its inherent limitations. First, errors in coding are a po-
tential source of bias with some data entered incorrectly or in-
consistently. This is particularly relevant for possible confounding 
factors such as gestational age, maternal BMI, presence of med-
ical conditions, parity and indication for emergency caesarean 
birth. Our database did not consistently distinguish between fail-
ure to progress and failed induction and it is likely that most cases 
of failed induction were classified as failure to progress in labour. 
We were also unable to stratify outcomes according to method 
of IOL or the favourability of the cervix at commencement of IOL. 
The main strength of this study is in its large sample size from a 
single tertiary institution with consistent intrapartum guidelines. 
We also controlled for confounders that are known to influence 
mode of birth. Nevertheless, our results and that of other inves-
tigators mentioned earlier, highlight the challenge that different 
methods for calculating the risk of caesarean birth can result in 
contradictory answers to what may seem like similar, yet inher-
ently different questions.
