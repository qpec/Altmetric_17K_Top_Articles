Abstract
Objective—To conduct the first longitudinal study examining whether trauma exposure and 
PTSD are associated with increased risk of incident SLE in a civilian cohort.
Methods—We examined the association of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms with SLE 
incidence over 24 years of follow-up in a U.S. longitudinal cohort of women (N=54,763). Incident 
SLE with ≥4 American College of Rheumatology criteria was ascertained by self-report and 
confirmed by medical record review. PTSD and trauma exposure were assessed with the Short 
Screening Scale for DSM-IV PTSD and the Brief Trauma Questionnaire. Women were 
categorized as having: no trauma, trauma and no PTSD symptoms, subclinical PTSD (1-3 
symptoms), or probable PTSD (4-7 symptoms). We examined whether longitudinally assessed

 health risk factors (e.g., smoking, body mass index (BMI), oral contraceptive (OC) use) accounted 
for increased SLE risk among women with versus without trauma exposure and PTSD.
Results—During follow-up, 73 cases of SLE occurred. Compared to women with no trauma, 
probable PTSD was associated with increased SLE risk (HR4-7 symptoms =2.94, 95% CI=1.19-7.26, 
p<0.05). Subclinical PTSD was associated with increased SLE risk, though this did not reach 
statistical significance (HR1-3 symptoms =1.83, 95% CI=0.74-4.56, p=0.19). Smoking, BMI and OC 
use slightly attenuated associations (e.g., probable PTSD adjusted HR=2.62, 95% CI=1.09-6.48, 
p<0.05). Trauma exposure, regardless of PTSD symptoms, was strongly associated with incident 
SLE (HR=2.87, 95% CI=1.31, 6.28, p<0.01).
Conclusions—This study contributes to growing evidence that psychosocial trauma and 
associated stress responses may lead to autoimmune disease.
Psychosocial stress exposure may alter immune function, and exposure to severe stressors, 
as well as high levels of distress after stressor exposure, have been implicated in 
autoimmune disease pathogenesis1-3 and associated with subsequent development of 
autoimmune disease4,5. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the sentinel stress-related 
disorder and indicates severe psychological distress occurring in response to a traumatic 
stressor. Epidemiologic research has suggested that PTSD may increase risk for autoimmune 
disease6,7, including rheumatoid arthritis,7-10 autoimmune thyroiditis9,10, inflammatory 
bowel disease, multiple sclerosis9 and psoriasis10. Thus, PTSD may also be associated with 
increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
SLE is an autoimmune disorder associated with renal failure11, myocardial infarction12,13, 
fatal infection14,15, and premature mortality (standardized mortality ratio=2.4)14 which has 
an incidence 3 to 13 times higher among women than men16. High prevalence of anxiety and 
psychological distress are well documented among individuals with SLE17-19, and stress and 
emotional distress are often implicated by SLE patients as triggers of their disease flares20. 
However, evidence regarding whether traumatic experiences, stress or PTSD increase SLE 
risk is sparse as just one study comprised of predominantly male military veterans has 
specifically examined SLE risk association with PTSD. In a study using computer medical 
records of individuals enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system, war 
veterans with a PTSD diagnosis had significantly higher risk of subsequent SLE diagnosis 
(adjusted relative risk, RR=1.85)9 than those without a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorders 
over a median of 4 years of follow-up. Moreover, the association of PTSD with SLE (as well 
as other autoimmune diseases) was stronger than those of other psychiatric disorders. This 
sample was 88% male, and the median time elapsed between psychiatric diagnosis and 
immune disorder diagnosis was just over 7 months (220 days), raising concerns about 
potential confounding or reverse causation due to undetected autoimmune disease.
No longitudinal studies of SLE risk in association with PTSD or traumatic events among 
civilians have been conducted. Additionally, no studies have examined whether trauma 
exposure alone, irrespective of psychological sequelae, is associated with increased risk of 
SLE. Finally, lifestyle factors that are more common in persons with PTSD have been 
identified as possible risk factors for increased systemic inflammation and autoimmune 
disease, including smoking, obesity, and oral contraceptive use16,21-26. These behavioral

 factors may partially account for the relationship between trauma, PTSD, and autoimmune 
disease, yet their role has not been examined.
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that trauma and PTSD are associated with 
increased risk of incident SLE in a large longitudinal cohort of civilian women. We further 
examined whether higher prevalence of health risk behaviors, namely, smoking, sedentary 
lifestyle, obesity, alcohol use and oral contraceptive use, might account for possible 
increased risk of SLE in women with versus without PTSD and trauma exposure. Finally, as 
depression has been associated with SLE18 and is frequently co-morbid with PTSD27, we 
ascertained the association of PTSD with SLE independently of depression.
Methods
Participants
The Nurses' Health Study II is an ongoing cohort of 116,430 female nurses initially enrolled 
in 1989 and followed with biennial questionnaires. The present study included follow-up 
through 2013. This study included women who returned a supplementary 2008 
questionnaire on trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (N=54,763). This questionnaire was 
sent to a subsample of participants (N=60,804, response rate=90.1%). To retain participation 
in the ongoing longitudinal cohort, only women who have already returned their biennial 
questionnaire are sent supplementary questionnaires. Women missing data on trauma or 
PTSD symptoms (N=3,930) were excluded. This study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of Brigham and Women's Hospital. Return of the questionnaire via US mail 
constitutes implied consent.
Case ascertainment
Methods for SLE case identification and validation according to ACR 1997 Classification 
Criteria have been reported.28,29 Nurses were asked to report all new physician-diagnosed 
SLE on each questionnaire. Women who self-reported new cases were then asked to 
complete the connective tissue disease screening questionnaire (CSQ)28, to provide the name 
and address of the health care provider who had diagnosed SLE, and to sign a medical 
records release. For all women who scored positive for symptoms of SLE on the CSQ, we 
attempted to obtain medical records from the time of diagnosis. These records were 
independently reviewed by two board-certified rheumatologists for all ACR criteria for SLE 
and other features consistent with SLE.
We excluded participants who reported an existing diagnosis of SLE at baseline, and 
censored those who self-reported connective tissue disease in follow-up without SLE 
confirmation by medical record review (N=531). The sensitivity and specificity of this two-
stage screening procedure have been shown to be high.30
PTSD and trauma ascertainment
Trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were assessed on a supplementary 2008 
questionnaire. The 16-item Brief Trauma Questionnaire queried lifetime exposure to 15 
types of traumatic events (e.g., serious car accident, sexual assault) and an additional item 
Roberts et al.

 queried any traumatic event not covered in the other questions31. Respondents were asked to 
identify which trauma was their worst or most distressing; they were then asked their age at 
this worst trauma as well as their age at their first trauma. PTSD symptoms were assessed in 
relation to their worst trauma with the 7-item Short Screening Scale for DSM-IV PTSD32. 
Four or more symptoms on this scale have been associated with PTSD diagnosis 
(sensitivity=80%, specificity=97%, positive predictive value=71%, negative predictive 
value=98%)32.
For each year of follow-up, participants were characterized as: trauma unexposed, trauma 
exposed/no PTSD symptoms, trauma/1-3 PTSD symptoms (subclinical PTSD), or 
trauma/4-7 PTSD symptoms (probable PTSD). Trauma and PTSD status were time-updated 
over the follow-up period, with date of onset of trauma and PTSD symptoms determined as 
follows. A respondent was considered trauma unexposed for each year of follow-up before 
her age at first trauma. For each year of follow-up after her age at first trauma, she was 
considered trauma exposed/no PTSD symptoms. For each year of follow-up after her age at 
worst trauma, she was characterized as having no symptoms, 1-3 symptoms, or 4-7 PTSD 
symptoms based on her responses to the PTSD screen. If a woman reported only one trauma, 
her age at first and age at worst trauma were considered the same. For example, a woman 
who reported experiencing her first trauma at age 40, her worst trauma at age 50 and 6 
PTSD symptoms in relation to this worst trauma would be coded as: trauma unexposed 
before age 40, trauma exposed with no PTSD symptoms after age 40, and trauma exposed 
with 4-7 PTSD symptoms after age 50. To mitigate concerns about reverse causality, women 
who reported illness as their worst trauma were excluded from analyses of PTSD and SLE to 
avoid including women whose SLE could have induced PTSD symptoms (N=2129, N=18 
SLE cases).
For analyses of the association of any lifetime trauma with SLE risk (irrespective of PTSD 
symptoms), we coded trauma exposure according to a woman's age at her first trauma. For 
each year of follow-up, a woman was considered trauma exposed if she was older than her 
reported age at first trauma and was considered trauma unexposed if she was younger than 
her age at first trauma or reported never experiencing a traumatic event. Women whose first 
trauma was illness were excluded (N=408, N=4 SLE cases).
Health risk behaviors and demographic covariates
We selected covariates that have been related to either PTSD or SLE or 
both16,21-23,25,26,29,33. Covariates were time-updated, such that for each year of follow-up 
the most recent report was used (Supplemental Figure). Oral contraceptive use, current 
smoking, and weight were queried on each biennial questionnaire, 1989-2013. Body mass 
index (BMI) was calculated in kg/m2 based on weight reported on the biennial 
questionnaires and self-reported height as reported on the baseline questionnaire (1989). 
Self-reported weight was highly reliable (r=0.97) in a validation study34. Physical activity 
was queried in 7 waves (1989-2013) and was characterized as 0-9 or 10+ metabolic 
equivalent (mets)/week. Alcohol use was queried in 1989, 1995, 2005 and 2009. Lifetime 
history of depression was assessed in 2001. Indicators of socioeconomic status included U.S. 
Census tract median household income obtained from geocoded home addresses and

 maximum of parents' education when respondents were infants, reported in 2005 as: high 
school or less, some college, or college or more. Self-reported race was coded as white or 
non-white. As race has been strongly associated with SLE risk16, we included race in all 
models.
Statistical analyses
We examined prevalence of all covariates by trauma/PTSD status at baseline in 1989.
To ascertain the association of trauma exposure and PTSD with incident SLE, we calculated 
hazard ratios for each level of trauma/PTSD symptoms using Cox proportional hazards 
regressions with age in months as the measure of time (time metameter), with trauma 
unexposed as the referent. We additionally examined the association of PTSD symptoms 
coded as a continuous variable (0 to 7) with SLE incidence.
We evaluated census tract median income and parents' education in infancy as possible 
demographic covariates; as we found they were not associated with SLE and did not alter the 
association of trauma or PTSD with SLE, we did not include them in models. We separately 
examined the association of each health risk factor, e.g., smoking, sedentary behavior, 
obesity, alcohol use, and oral contraceptive use, with SLE incidence using Cox proportional 
hazards models. To ascertain the extent to which higher prevalence of health risk factors in 
women with PTSD could account for any observed elevated risk of SLE, we calculated 
hazard ratios for SLE for each level of trauma/PTSD symptoms in models including as 
covariates all health factors associated with SLE, using Cox models. We did not conduct 
formal mediation analyses, as the health risk factors we examined could be either 
confounders, to the extent they were present prior to trauma or PTSD onset, or mediators, to 
the extent they increased following onset of trauma or PTSD. Given the rarity of SLE, and 
that these health risk factors typically initiate prior to the age of most women at our study 
enrollment, we did not have sufficient power to distinguish confounding from mediation. 
Thus, these analyses address the question, “Does potentially higher prevalence of health risk 
factors in women with trauma/PTSD account for any observed elevated risk of SLE?” 
without distinguishing whether the factors are confounders or mediators of the PTSD-SLE 
relation.
To examine whether trauma exposure per se confers increased risk of SLE, regardless of 
whether women subsequently developed PTSD, we calculated hazard of incident SLE in 
relation to any lifetime trauma exposure using Cox models with age in months as the 
measure of time, with trauma unexposed as the referent.
Although we established the date of onset of PTSD, because PTSD assessment was in 2008, 
we conducted careful tests of the possibility of reverse causality in the relationship between 
PTSD and SLE. That is, we assessed the likelihood that pre-diagnosis SLE symptoms might 
either elicit PTSD symptoms or increase likelihood of reporting PTSD symptoms, in three 
sensitivity analyses. First, we conducted analyses excluding any SLE cases occurring within 
2 years of PTSD onset/trauma from analyses. Next, we examined the association of PTSD 
status at cohort enrollment in 1989 (i.e., without updating PTSD status over time) in relation 
to incident SLE over follow-up, to ensure that PTSD likely occurred well before SLE onset,

 given that women who reported SLE at cohort enrollment were excluded. Finally, we tested 
whether SLE incidence was associated with increased subsequent risk of PTSD; for this 
analysis we excluded women with PTSD symptom onset prior to developing SLE or prior to 
cohort enrollment and conducted Cox models with age as the time measure, adjusted for 
race. In these models, women were considered SLE-unexposed before their SLE diagnosis 
or if they did not report SLE and SLE-exposed in the year of their confirmed SLE diagnosis 
and for subsequent years. To ascertain whether PTSD was associated with SLE 
independently of depression, we conducted analyses excluding women with depression prior 
to PTSD onset. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analyses including only women who: 1) 
reported no depression prior to 2001, when lifetime history of depression was assessed, and 
2) had their worst trauma prior to 2001 or did not experience a traumatic event.
Results
Compared to women with no trauma exposure, women with 4-7 PTSD symptoms at baseline 
were of similar age, were more likely to have ever used oral contraceptives and to have ever 
smoked, and were less likely to have a healthy BMI (Table 1). Over the 24-year follow-up 
period, 73 women developed SLE. In time-updated models, smoking, oral contraceptive use, 
and BMI were each associated with increased risk of developing SLE, while alcohol use and 
sedentary behavior were not (Table 2). Nearly all women with SLE in our sample had seen 
an ACR member rheumatologist and were anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive (Table 3).
In models adjusted only for race and age, high PTSD symptoms (4-7 symptoms) were 
associated with increased SLE risk. This association was somewhat attenuated in models 
further adjusted for smoking, oral contraceptive use, and BMI (Figure, panel A). One to 
three PTSD symptoms were associated with elevated risk of SLE, however this did not reach 
statistical significance. Continuous PTSD symptoms were associated with increased risk of 
incident SLE in models adjusted for race and age with borderline statistical significance (per 
symptom, HR=1.11, 95% CI=0.99, 1.24). Any versus no trauma exposure was strongly 
associated with increased SLE risk (Figure, panel B). This association was slightly 
attenuated after accounting for smoking, BMI, and oral contraceptive use.
In sensitivity analyses excluding the first two years of follow-up, results were similar to 
those in the main analyses (race- and age-adjusted models: HRPTSD 4-7= 3.26, 95% CI=1.32, 
8.05; HRtrauma exposure=2.73, 95% CI=1.25, 6.00). In models examining risk of incident SLE 
in association with trauma and PTSD status at baseline in 1989, there was a strong 
association of trauma and PTSD with SLE incidence (race- and age-adjusted models: 
HRtrauma, no PTSD=2.41, 95% CI=1.21, 4.81; HRPTSD 1-3=2.13, 95% CI=0.81, 5.63; 
HRPTSD 4-7=3.83, 95% CI=1.65, 8.91). In sensitivity analyses we did not find evidence that 
SLE increased risk of subsequently developing PTSD (HRSLE=0.92, 95% CI=0.29, 2.93).
In analyses restricted to women without a diagnosis of depression prior to 2001 and with 
their worst event occurring prior to 2001 (N=42,677, N SLE cases=22), the association of 
trauma and PTSD symptoms with SLE risk was slightly stronger than in the main analyses, 
though confidence intervals were wide and estimates did not reach statistical significance,

 perhaps because there were relatively few cases (HRtrauma, no PTSD=3.30, 95% CI=0.72, 
15.12; HRPTSD 1-3=2.87, 95% CI=0.58, 14.3; HRPTSD 4-7=4.06, 95% CI=0.74, 22.35).
Conclusion
In this large longitudinal study of civilian women, trauma exposure and PTSD were strongly 
associated with increased risk of incident SLE. We found a nearly three-fold elevated risk of 
incident SLE among women with probable PTSD and more than two-fold higher risk of 
incident SLE among women who had experienced any traumatic event compared with 
trauma-unexposed women.
These associations do not appear to result from either confounding or reverse causality in the 
association, whereby SLE caused trauma exposure or PTSD. We excluded trauma caused by 
illness, and findings were consistent when trauma and PTSD exposure were time lagged and 
when trauma and PTSD were characterized at baseline, substantially prior to most SLE 
diagnoses. Results were also largely similar when excluding women who had received a 
diagnosis of depression. Moreover, we found that SLE diagnosis itself did not predict risk of 
subsequently developing PTSD. These results strengthen evidence that the experience of 
trauma and PTSD may increase risk of subsequent SLE.
We examined whether several health risk factors accounted for the association between 
trauma or PTSD and SLE and found that an elevated risk of SLE in women with trauma or 
PTSD remained after accounting for these factors. These results recommend taking a closer 
look at biological changes subsequent to trauma and PTSD as potentially important 
mechanisms by which trauma and PTSD increase risk for SLE. To date, much of the 
research on biological changes associated with trauma and PTSD has been conducted 
examining whether higher levels of inflammation are evident35-43 and considering 
alterations to the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis44-46. As 
both HPA-axis functioning and dysregulated inflammatory processes and have been 
implicated in SLE, they are promising candidates for underlying mechanisms linking 
trauma-PTSD with subsequent SLE1. PTSD has been associated with dysregulation of the 
HPA-axis44-46. HPA-axis function differs in persons with versus without SLE47, although it 
is unknown whether these abnormalities precede SLE onset.
Animal models have demonstrated a link between PTSD and increased systemic 
inflammation. For example, in rats exposed to predator-induced PTSD, inflammatory micro-
RNA were up-regulated in the brain, adrenal glands, and blood48. In humans, numerous 
studies have found associations of PTSD and trauma exposure with elevated circulating 
inflammatory molecules, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein 
(CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)35-43. Additionally, persons with versus without PTSD have a 
more hyperactive immune response and higher circulating immunoglobulin-M levels10,49 It 
is also possible that additional health risk factors that we did not measure may be relevant. 
For example, sleep disturbance has been associated with PTSD50 and is prevalent among 
patients with SLE51. In a mouse model of SLE, sleep deprivation induced earlier disease 
onset52.

 Our findings are subject to several limitations. Our sample was predominantly white; 
therefore, this association should be studied in women of other races. Because of the timing 
of our PTSD assessment, lifetime exposure to trauma and PTSD symptoms were reported 
after many SLE cases had occurred (N=65 of 73). Moreover, our trauma and PTSD 
assessment was in 2008, thus, women may have experienced trauma and PTSD between 
2008 and the end of follow-up in 2013. Misclassification of trauma and PTSD-exposed 
women as unexposed is likely to have biased results towards the null hypothesis. Although 
we conducted multiple analyses to assess if our associations might be a result of SLE 
leading to trauma and PTSD, and did not find evidence to support this, nonetheless, our 
study design cannot definitively rule out this possibility. Although our sample was large, the 
number of incident SLE cases was moderate, limiting statistical power. Moreover, the 
women who enrolled in the NHS2 cohort were nurses and likely more interested in health-
protective behaviors than women in the general population, and this difference may have 
biased our results. Our study has a number of important strengths. It is the first longitudinal 
study to examine this question among a healthy civilian cohort with incident SLE validated 
by medical record review. Participants were not selected on the basis of trauma or PTSD 
status, thus results are more generalizable than clinic-based studies.
Our study contributes to growing evidence that psychosocial trauma and associated stress 
responses lead to autoimmune disease. Identification of the biological pathways by which 
psychosocial trauma may increase risk for autoimmune disease is crucial and may provide 
greater insight into disease etiology, as well as strategies for prevention. In addition, 
identification of mechanisms by which trauma and PTSD are associated with increased risk 
of SLE may indicate mechanisms for the association of PTSD and trauma exposure with 
other chronic diseases. Future studies are needed to determine whether treatment for PTSD 
affects these pathways, and whether lifestyle interventions can reduce the risk of 
autoimmune disease subsequent to trauma or PTSD.
