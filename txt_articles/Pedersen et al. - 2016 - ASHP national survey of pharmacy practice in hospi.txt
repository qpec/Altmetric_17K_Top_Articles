Purpose. The results of the 2015 ASHP national survey of pharmacy prac-
tice in hospital settings are presented.
Methods. A stratified random sample of pharmacy directors at 1432 U.S. 
general and children’s medical–surgical hospitals were surveyed using a 
mixed-mode method. IMS Health supplied data on hospital characteris-
tics; the survey sample was drawn from IMS’s hospital database.
Results. The survey response rate was 22.7%. Since the 2000 survey, the 
proportion of hospitals reporting that pharmacists monitor at least 75% of 
patients has increased from 20.3% to 57.8%. The use of therapeutic drug 
monitoring has increased from 63.0% to 70.6% since the 2012 survey. The 
percentage of hospitals reporting that pharmacists have primary respon-
sibility for discharge counseling has increased from 1.2% to 7.3% since 
the 2012 survey, with 33.8% of hospitals reporting pharmacist counsel-
ing of at-risk patients. Virtually all hospitals (97.5%) have partially or com-
pletely implemented electronic health records; most have computerized 
prescriber-order-entry (84.1%) and barcode-assisted medication adminis-
tration (93.7%) systems. At an increasing percentage of hospitals (86.2% 
in the 2015 survey), medication orders are reviewed by a pharmacist be-
fore a dose is made available and administered to a patient. 
Conclusion. The role of pharmacists in measuring, monitoring, and  
managing medication use in health systems continues to be significant, 
important, and growing. The evolution of electronic health information and 
technologies that make this information more readily available to patients 
is transforming healthcare in a positive way and enabling pharmacists to 
more efficiently contribute to improving medication use.

T
he ASHP national survey of phar-
macy practice in hospital settings 
focuses on practices and technolo-
gies for managing and improving the 
medication-use system and the role 
that pharmacists play in this effort. 
The national surveys are organized 
according to six components of the 
medication-use system: prescribing, 
transcribing, dispensing, administra-
tion, monitoring, and patient educa-
tion. The survey focuses on two com-
ponents in the medication-use system 
each year. The 2015 survey evaluated 
practices and technologies related 
to monitoring and patient educa-
tion. The most recent three surveys 
therefore represent a composite pic-
ture of the ways hospitals and health 
systems are managing and improv-
ing the entire medication-use system 
and current roles of pharmacists in 
medication-use system management.
In assessing monitoring and pa-
tient education practices, the 2015 
survey provided data to describe cur-
rent practices and trends in phar-
macists’ medication therapy moni-
toring activities, inpatient therapeutic 
drug monitoring activities, drug ther-
apy management activities, methods 
used to monitor and report adverse 
drug events (ADEs), antimicrobial 
stewardship activities, responsibility

for medication reconciliation, patient 
education and counseling activities, 
implementation of medication-use sys-
tem technologies, outpatient dispens-
ing pharmacy operations, methods of 
providing specialty pharmacy prod-
ucts and services to patients, and use 
of key metrics to track pharmacy de-
partment performance.
The data gathered in the 2015 
survey also describe human resource 
commitments, national vacancy rates 
for hospital pharmacist and pharmacy 
technician positions, acquisition costs 
of pharmaceuticals, and the scope of 
medication order review and entry.
Methods
An evaluation of monitoring and 
patient education practices in U.S. 
hospitals and health systems was 
conducted using methods similar 
to those used in past ASHP national 
surveys.1-14
Questionnaire development. The 
2015 questionnaire was developed us-
ing procedures suggested by Dillman.15 
Questions from previous surveys that 
pertained to topics of interest in this 
survey were evaluated for clarity and 
response. As with past surveys, data 
about hospital characteristics (i.e., 
number of beds, U.S. Census Bureau 
region, ownership, and U.S. Bureau of 
Census metropolitan statistical area 
status)16 were obtained from the IMS 
Health hospital database.17
Survey sample. From the IMS 
database of 7053 hospitals, a sam-
pling frame of 4893 general and chil-
dren’s medical–surgical hospitals in 
the United States was constructed. 
Specialty, federal, and Veterans Af-
fairs hospitals were excluded from 
this sampling frame. Hospitals were 
stratified by size before sampling, and 
random samples of hospitals within 
these strata were taken to select the 
sample of 1439 hospitals. We sampled 
300 hospitals with fewer than 50 beds 
to account for historically lower re-
sponse rates in hospitals of this size. 
We sampled all hospitals with 600 or 
more staffed beds (n = 139) to collect 
data from enough of these very large 
KEY POINTS
• The percentage of patients be-
ing monitored by pharmacists 
has increased significantly.
• Pharmacists routinely pro-
vide medication management 
services in more than half of 
hospitals.
• Pharmacists and pharmacy 
technicians are becoming more 
involved in patient education 
and medication reconciliation.
• The rapid adoption of electronic 
health information is transform-
ing medication-use systems.
hospitals to provide reliable estimates. 
Two hundred hospitals were sampled 
in each of the other hospital size cat-
egories. After eliminating closed hos-
pitals, the adjusted sample was 1432 
hospitals (Table 1).
Data collection. A mixed-mode 
survey method was used. Respon-
dents were offered a choice of com-
pleting a paper survey or an online 
survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Phar-
macy directors in the sample were 
contacted up to six times during the 
survey period. An announcement 
letter was sent in July 2015. This first 
contact letter explained the survey 
and directed respondents preferring 
to complete the survey online to the 
online data collection site. Direc-
tors opting for online data collection 
received e-mail reminders, whereas 
those not completing the online con-
tact option received mailed paper sur-
veys and reminders. Two weeks after 
the announcement letter was mailed, 
the first survey mailing was distribut-
ed. Two weeks after the initial survey 
mailing (in August 2015), respondents 
received a reminder postcard. The sur-
veys was distributed a second time 
to nonrespondents one week later. 
The survey was sent a third time to 
the remaining nonrespondents at 
the end of August. A final telephone 
contact asking nonrespondents to 
complete the survey was made dur-
ing September 2015.
Data analysis. Each hospital in 
the sample was assigned a unique 
identification number. This number 
allowed the survey response to be 
matched with the hospital character-
istics in the IMS Health database. 
As with past surveys, data are 
presented here by categories of 
staffed beds to more closely align 
with data from the American Hospital 
Association.18
Because of the stratified random 
sampling procedure, it was necessary 
to employ a design-based analysis.19 
This technique results in popula-
tion estimates that are more accurate 
than those derived from unweighted 
results.
Data were entered into SPSS, ver-
sion 19 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, 
NY). Data were converted to an Inter-
cooled Stata, version 8 (Stata Corp LP
, 
College Station, TX)–readable format 
using DBMS Copy, version 7 (Con-
ceptual Software Inc., Houston, TX). 
All non–design-based analyses were 
conducted using SPSS 19. All design-
based analyses were conducted with 
Stata 8 using the set of survey com-
mands. To account for the sampling 
method, weights were assigned to 
adjust for each respondent’s contribu-
tion to the population estimate. The 
assigned weights were as follows: 
25.57 for hospitals with fewer than 
50 staffed beds, 14.54 for hospitals 
with 50–99 beds, 27.39 for hospitals 
with 100–199 beds, 14.14 for hos-
pitals with 200–299 beds, 8.14 for 
hospitals with 300–399 beds, 6.04 
for hospitals with 400–599 beds, and 
4.09 for hospitals with 600 or more 
staffed beds. The strata were the cat-
egories for number of staffed beds, 
and the finite population correction 
was the total number of hospitals in 
the population (4893).
Descriptive statistics were used 
extensively. Chi-square analysis and 
analysis of variance or regression were 
used to examine how responses dif-

acteristics. The a priori level of signifi-
cance was set at 0.05.
Results
Overall, 228 individuals elected to 
receive the survey electronically; of 
those, 154 provided usable responses 
via online survey submission. Paper 
surveys were completed by an addition-
al 171 respondents. A total of 325 hospi-
tals submitted usable data for analysis. 
The overall response rate was 22.7%.

dent and nonrespondent institutions 
were statistically different in regional 
location.
Medication therapy monitoring. 
For the purposes of the survey, medi-
cation therapy monitoring was de-
fined as monitoring that occurs after a 
patient receives a medication. Medica-
tion therapy monitoring activities in-
cluded but were not limited to the fol-
lowing: monitoring therapeutic drug 
levels, monitoring patient outcomes, 
monitoring patient laboratory results, 
ADE monitoring, adjusting medica-
tion regimens due to organ function 
changes or changes in clinical status, 
and monitoring medication errors. 
Pharmacist activities performed be-
fore medication administration (e.g., 
identification of medication-selection 
issues, order review) are part of the 
prescribing process and were not 
included in the survey definition of 
monitoring.
Overall, 57.8% of hospitals had 
pharmacists monitor 75% or more of 
patients, 18.9% of hospitals had phar-
macists monitor 51–75% of patients, 
14.0% of hospitals had pharmacists 
monitor 26–50% of patients, and 9.3% 
of hospitals had pharmacists monitor 
less than 26% of patients (Table 2 and 
Figure 1). The proportion of hospitals 
having pharmacists monitor more 
than 75% of patients has increased 
over the past 16 years, from 20.3% in 
200020 to 57.8% in 2015.

findings in this area varied by staffed-
bed count; smaller hospitals were the 
most likely to have pharmacists moni-
tor all patients, and the largest hospi-
tals were the most likely to use com-
puterized data-mining functionality 
as a method to identify patients in 
need of daily monitoring by pharma-
cists (p < 0.0001).
Hospitals used many criteria to 
select patients for daily medication 
therapy monitoring by pharmacists. 
Overall, 75.8% of hospitals identified 
patients for monitoring using abnor-
mal laboratory values that prompted 
dosage adjustments. The use of this 
practice varied significantly based 
on staffed-bed size; smaller hospitals 
were the least likely to use abnor-

1312  AM J HEALTH-SYST PHARM | VOLUME 73 | NUMBER 17 | SEPTEMBER 1, 2016
and 74.5% of hospitals with 50–99 
staffed beds used a list of medications.
Patients were also identified for 
monitoring on the basis of disease 
state (47.5%), directives from a hos-
pital committee (46.6%), care being 
provided by specific medical or surgi-
cal services (39.0%), and use of high-
cost medications (36.2%). The prac-
tice of focusing on specific disease 
states as a method to identify patients 
for medication therapy monitoring 
has increased from 30.7% in 2012, 
whereas use of the other methods 
has remained relatively constant over 
the past three years.3 Larger hospitals 
have been more likely to use these 
methods.
Data collection for pharma-
cist monitoring. The most common 
process used to compile clinical infor-
mation used for daily monitoring by 
pharmacists was data-mining func-
tionality within the EHR (58.6%), fol-
lowed by a manual process in which 
pharmacists 
abstracted 
pertinent 
data from the patient record (54.6%) 
(Table 4). Overall, 28.4% of hospitals 
had clinical surveillance software that 
assisted pharmacists with compiling 
clinical information. Relative to larg-
er hospitals, smaller hospitals were 
more likely to use a manual process 
(p = 0.0074) and less likely to use data-
mining functionality within the EHR 
(p = 0.0092) or clinical surveillance 
software (p < 0.0001).
Therapeutic drug monitoring. 
Overall, 94.6% of hospitals had pharma-
cists routinely monitor serum medica-
tion concentrations or their surrogate 
markers (Figure 2). In 82.3% of hospi-
tals, pharmacists had authority by pro-
tocol to order initial measurement of a 
serum medication concentration, and 
81.7% of hospitals allowed pharmacists 
to adjust the dosage of a medication 
being monitored. Over the past three 
years, therapeutic drug monitoring by 
pharmacists and their authority to or-
der measurement of serum medication 
concentrations and to adjust dosages 
have remained stable.3
Drug therapy management. Drug 
therapy management was defined in 
the survey as a multidisciplinary team 
process for selecting appropriate drug 
therapies, educating patients, moni-
toring patients, and continually assess-
ing outcomes of therapy. Pharmacist 
activities in drug therapy management 
may include but are not limited to the 
following: initiating, modifying, and 
monitoring a patient’s drug therapy; 
ordering and performing laboratory 
and related tests; assessing a patient’s 
response to therapy; counseling and 
educating a patient about medications; 
and administering medications.
Overall, 53.2% of hospitals routine-
ly had pharmacists assigned to provide 
drug therapy management services to 
a majority of patients in the hospital 
at least eight hours per day, five days 
per week (Table 5 and Figure 3). The 
use of this practice varied significantly 
by hospital size; larger hospitals were 
more likely than smaller hospitals to 
have pharmacists assigned to provide 
drug therapy management services. 
The practice of having pharmacists 
routinely assigned to provide drug 
therapy management services to a 
majority of patients in the hospital for 
at least eight hours per day and five 
days per week has increased, from 
34.2% in 2011 to 53.2% in 2015.1-4
Areas where pharmacists were 
most 
frequently 
assigned 
were 
medical–surgical units (43.5%), criti-
cal care units (43.5%), oncology units 
(37.5%), and cardiology units (32.9%).

these types of units varied significant-
ly by hospital size; hospitals with 300 
beds or more were more likely than 
smaller hospitals to have pharmacists 
assigned to specific areas and services 
to provide drug therapy management 
services.
Overall, 47.1% of hospitals had 
pharmacists actively involved in de-
veloping a plan of care with the in-
terdisciplinary team for a majority of 
inpatients; the use of this practice did 
not vary by hospital size.
Methods to identify ADEs. Be-
cause operational definitions for ADEs 
vary, the following definition was pro-
vided: “An adverse drug event is an in-
jury resulting from the use of, or not 
using, a needed medication. For the 
purposes of this survey, consider ad-
verse drug events to include both ad-
verse drug reactions and medication 
errors, including both errors of com-
mission and omission that result in 
adverse clinical outcomes.”21
Hospital pharmacy directors were 
asked which methods pharmacists 
use to routinely monitor patients for 
ADEs. The most common methods

were notification by nursing staff 
(86.6%), an ADE incident reporting 
system (84.1%), alerting orders or 
trigger medications (73.0%), thera-
peutic drug monitoring (70.6%), and 
routine review of laboratory values 
(67.2%). Less common methods 
were chart review (41.1%), an ADE 
hotline (26.5%), pharmacist rounds 
with physicians to assess ADEs 
(23.6%), pharmacist rounds without 
physicians (23.5%), patient coun-
seling (21.7%), and medical record 
“e-codes” (18.9%). Larger hospitals 
were more likely than smaller ones 
to use each of these methods, with 
the exception of the use of alerting 
orders or trigger medications, noti-
fication by nursing staff, and chart 
review. Hospitals, regardless of size, 
used notification by nursing staff 
consistently as a method to moni-
tor patients for ADEs. The use of all 
these methods remained stable or 
increased over the last three years. 
The use of therapeutic drug moni-
toring increased from 63.0% in 20123 
to 70.6% in 2015 during that period, 
the use of routine review of labora-
tory values increased from 52.7% to 
67.2%, and the use of the practice 
of identifying ADEs through patient 
counseling sessions increased from 
11.7% to 21.7%.
Review of ADEs. Most hospitals 
(84.8%) had a multidisciplinary com-
mittee (including physicians, phar-
macists, and nurses) responsible for 
review, analysis, education, policy 
formulation, and corrective action 
related to ADEs (Table 6). The small-
est hospitals were least likely to have a 
multidisciplinary committee to review 
ADEs.
Quality improvement. Overall, 
53.1% of hospitals had conducted 
at least one prospective medication 
safety–related analytical process us-
ing a technique such as failure modes 
and effects analysis (FMEA) during the 
preceding year (Table 6). The use of 
this practice varied significantly with 
hospital size; larger hospitals were 
more likely than smaller hospitals to 
have completed an FMEA in the prior 
year. Overall, 71.2% of hospitals had 
conducted at least one retrospective 
medication safety–related root-cause

analysis (RCA) in the previous year, 
with significant variation by hospital 
size; larger hospitals were more likely 
than smaller hospitals to have com-
pleted an RCA in the preceding year.
Over half (57.4%) of hospitals used 
a 
systematic 
quality-improvement 
process (e.g., Lean, Six Sigma) to make 
improvements to the medication-use 
system, with significant variation by 
hospital size; larger hospitals were 
more likely than smaller hospitals to 
use a systematic quality-improvement 
process.
The use of prospective FMEA has 
declined slightly since 20123 while the 
use of retrospective RCA has remained 
stable.
External ADE reporting. Over-
all, 83.6% of hospitals reported ADEs 
externally. The use of this practice 
varied significantly by hospital size;

larger hospitals were more likely than 
smaller hospitals to report ADEs exter-
nally (uncorrected c2 = 12.6402, df = 6, 
design-based F[4.28, 1321.20] = 2.6023, 
p = 0.0311). For example, 97.0% of hos-
pitals with 600 or more staffed beds 
reported ADEs externally, as com-
pared with 95.7% of hospitals with 
400–599 beds, 86.0% of hospitals 
with 300–399 beds, 93.0% of hos-
pitals with 200–299 beds, 81.6% of 
hospitals with 100–199 beds, 89.4% 
of hospitals with 50–99 beds, and 
75.4% of hospitals with fewer than 50 
staffed beds. In 2009, 60.7% of hospitals 
reported ADEs externally, as compared 
with 80.6% of hospitals in 2012.3,6
Antimicrobial stewardship pro-
grams. Overall, 65.5% of hospitals 
had an antimicrobial stewardship 
program (Table 7). The use of such 
programs varied by hospital size.
Pharmacists most commonly had 
a leadership and accountability role 
(57.3%) in their institution’s antimi-
crobial stewardship program; in sub-
stantial percentages of institutions, 
pharmacists had a clinical support 
role (26.6%) or a data analysis role 
(14.3%) (Figure 4). It was uncommon 
for pharmacists to not be actively in-
volved in their institution’s antimi-
crobial stewardship program if one 
existed (1.8% of respondents reported 
lack of active involvement). The phar-
macist role varied by hospital size; 
pharmacists were most commonly in 
a leadership and accountability role 
in larger hospitals, whereas in smaller 
hospitals, pharmacists most com-
monly provided clinical support to the 
antimicrobial stewardship program.
Various strategies were used in an-
timicrobial stewardship programs to

influence and improve antimicrobial 
prescribing. The most frequently used 
strategy was conducting a daily review 
of targeted antimicrobials for appro-
priateness and contacting prescribers 
with recommendations for alternative 
therapy (86.9%), followed by educa-
tion of prescribers using national or 
local guidelines (80.8%), restricting 
dispensing of targeted antimicrobi-
als to approved indications (76.5%), 
and use of clinical decision support 
systems (disease-specific order sets or 
clinical surveillance software) that dis-
seminate patient-specific recommen-
dations during order entry (66.7%). 
Education and guidelines, formulary 
restrictions, and information technol-
ogy strategies were more commonly 
used in larger hospitals.
The most common way hospitals 
assessed the impact of an antimicrobi-
al stewardship program was by evalu-
ation of resistance trends (79.0%), fol-
lowed by evaluation of expenditures 
on antimicrobial agents (77.4%), com-
pliance with evidence-based guide-
lines (77.0%), and the incidence of 
Clostridium difficile infection (76.6%); 
other commonly used strategies were 
reducing unnecessary antimicrobial 
therapy (75.3%) and evaluating anti-
microbial utilization patterns (75.1%) 
and the rate of i.v.-to-oral conversions 
(67.3%). Less common ways included 
evaluation of infection-related read-
missions (40.4%), infection-related 
length of stay (40.4%), and infection-
related mortality (32.3%).
For those hospitals that assessed 
the impact of the antimicrobial stew-
ardship program, 81.4% had docu-
mented improvements in adherence 
to evidence-based guidelines, 80.7% 
had improvements in the i.v.-to-oral 
conversion rate, and 79.6% had re-

Medication reconciliation. Nurs-
es had primary responsibility in about 
two thirds of hospitals for collect-
ing medication regimen information 
at admission (Table 8). Physicians, 
pharmacists, and pharmacy techni-
cians were not commonly responsi-
ble for collecting medication regimen 
information at admission. Respon-
sibility for collecting medication 
regimen information on admission 
varied by hospital size; nurses in the 
largest hospitals were less likely than 
those at smaller hospitals to have re-
sponsibility for collecting medication 
regimen information at admission. In 
recent years, the reported rate of as-
signment of primary responsibility 
for collecting medication regimen in-
formation at admission decreased for 
nurses (from 79.4% in 2012 to 67.1% 
in 2015) and increased for pharma-
cists and pharmacy technicians (from 
2.0% and 2.9%, respectively, in 2012 
to 5.5% and 10.4%, respectively, in 
2015).3
Nurses had primary responsibil-
ity in about four fifths of hospitals for 
disseminating medication regimen 
information at discharge (Table 8). 
Physicians and pharmacists were not 
commonly responsible for dissemi-
nating medication regimen informa-
tion at discharge. Responsibility for 
disseminating medication regimen 
information at discharge varied by 
hospital size; nurses in the largest hos-
pitals were less likely than those at 
smaller hospitals to have responsi-
bility for disseminating medication 
regimen information at discharge. In 
recent years, the percentage of hos-
pitals reporting that pharmacists had 
primary responsibility for disseminat-
ing medication regimen information 
at discharge has increased, from 1.6% 
in 2012 to 7.3% in 2015.3
Patient medication education 
and counseling. Overall, 33.8% of 
hospitals had pharmacists routinely 
conduct discharge medication coun-
seling for at-risk patient groups (Table 
9), with significant variation by hospi-
tal size; larger hospitals were more like-
ly than smaller hospitals to have phar-
macists provide discharge medication 
counseling to at-risk groups. Further-
more, 10.6% of hospitals routinely had 
pharmacists follow up with selected 
high-risk patient groups on appropri-
ate medication use after discharge 
(e.g., through phone calls); use of this 
practice also varied by hospital size, 
with the largest hospitals most likely to 
conduct postdischarge follow-up.
In 35.5% of hospitals, pharmacists 
routinely provided either discharge 
medication counseling or postdis-
charge follow-up through telephone 
calls to at-risk patient groups; this 
figure was substantially higher than 
that documented in the 2011 survey 
(20.3%).4
Health information technolo-
gies. Overall, 97.5% of hospitals had 
partially or completely implemented 
an EHR (Table 10 and Figure 5). Fully 
37.5% of hospitals had a complete 
EHR system, with no paper records; 
60.0% of hospitals had a partial EHR, 
with some components still using pa-
per; and 2.5% had an all-paper sys-
tem and no EHR. From 2003 to 2015, 
the percentage of hospitals having 
paper-only health records declined 
from 69.4% to 2.5%, with a significant 
decline seen since 2012, when 18.5% 
of hospitals still reported the use of 
paper-only records.1-6,8,9,11,12 There has 
been a corresponding increase in the 
use of complete EHR systems over the 
last four years.
Overall, 84.1% of hospitals had 
computerized prescriber-order-entry

(CPOE) systems (Table 10), a major in-
crease from 2.7% of hospitals in 2003, 
with substantial increases reported in 
each of the last five surveys.1-12
Overall, 93.7% of hospitals had 
barcode-assisted medication admin-
istration (BCMA) systems to verify pa-
tient identity and electronically check 
doses administered by nurses (Table 
10); that marks a dramatic increase 
from the 1.5% rate of BCMA use report-
ed in 2002, with significant increases 
seen in each of the last five surveys.1-13
Mobile devices. In 40.3% of hos-
pitals responding to the 2015 survey, 
pharmacists routinely used a mobile 
device (a tablet computer or smart-
phone) while providing patient care 
(Table 11). The use of this practice 
varied significantly by hospital size; 
larger hospitals were more likely 
than smaller hospitals to have phar-
macists using mobile devices. Activi-
ties that pharmacists using mobile 
devices most commonly performed 
included accessing drug informa-
tion (93.6%), communicating with 
other healthcare providers (51.0%), 
accessing laboratory data (47.9%), 
reviewing or entering orders (43.6%), 
and 
documenting 
interventions 
(37.4%). Less commonly performed 
activities included medication rec-
onciliation and transitions-of-care 
activities (24.4%), ADE reporting 
(23.6%), drug shortage monitoring 
(13.9%), receiving notifications re-
garding patients in need of pharma-
cist assessment (10.4%), and remote

prescription counseling at discharge 
(3.1%). These findings varied signifi-
cantly by hospital size; larger hos-
pitals were more likely than smaller 
hospitals to have pharmacists using 
mobile devices for collection of labo-
ratory data, documentation of inter-
ventions (including medication rec-
onciliation and transitions-of-care 
activities), receiving notifications re-
garding patients in need of pharma-
cist assessment, ADE reporting, and 
remote discharge counseling.
Outpatient dispensing pharmacy. 
Overall, 27.7% of surveyed hospitals 
and health systems had an outpatient 
dispensing pharmacy, with significant 
variation by hospital size; larger hos-
pitals were more likely than smaller 
hospitals to have an outpatient dis-
pensing pharmacy (uncorrected c2 = 
67.6880, df = 6, design-based F[4.36, 
1339.74] = 13.1373, p < 0.0001). For 
example, 87.9% of hospitals with 600 
or more staffed beds had an outpa-
tient dispensing pharmacy, as com-
pared with 68.1% of hospitals with 
400–599 beds, 63.6% of hospitals 
with 300–399 beds, 38.1% of hospi-
tals with 200–299 beds, 24.3% of hos-
pitals with 100–199 beds, 17.4% of 
hospitals with 50–99 beds, and 10.8% 
of hospitals with fewer than 50 staffed 
beds. The proportion of hospitals in-
dicating that they have an outpatient 
dispensing pharmacy has remained 
stable since 2009.3,6
Overall, 70.2% of hospitals with 
outpatient 
dispensing 
pharmacies 
had the inpatient hospital pharmacy 
department operate the outpatient 
pharmacy, 19.9% had a separate out-
patient division in the organization 
operate the outpatient pharmacy, and 
11.9% outsourced operations to an-
other company.
Among hospitals that had an out-
patient dispensing pharmacy, 51.1% 
offered a discharge prescription ser-
vice (e.g., a “meds-to-bed” service) 
through their outpatient pharmacy, 
11.6% offered this service through a 
contracted 
community 
pharmacy, 
and 37.2% did not offer a discharge 
prescription service. Larger hospitals 
were more likely than smaller hospitals 
to offer a discharge prescription ser-
vice (uncorrected c2 = 33.7083, df = 12, 
design-based F[8.17, 988.43] = 2.0891, 
p = 0.0331). For example, 86.2% of hos-
pitals with 600 or more staffed beds of-
fered a discharge prescription service 
through the outpatient pharmacy, 
as compared with 71.0% of hospitals 
with 400–599 beds, 60.7% of hospi-
tals with 300–399 beds, 43.8% of hos-
pitals with 200–299 beds, 44.4% of 
hospitals with 100–199 beds, 50.0% 
of hospitals with 50–99 beds, and

14.3% of hospitals with fewer than 
50 staffed beds.
Specialty pharmacy. The most 
common approach to providing spe-
cialty pharmacy products and services 
was to serve patients on a case-by-
case basis, with no formal specialty 
pharmacy business model (83.7%), 
followed by outsourcing to an exter-
nal specialty pharmacy (8.6%) and 
operating a health system–owned 
specialty pharmacy located within 
health-system pharmacy space (4.2%) 
or a standalone health system–owned 
specialty pharmacy (3.6%) (Table 12). 
These findings varied significantly by 
hospital size; compared with smaller 
hospitals, larger hospitals were more 
likely to provide specialty pharmacy 
products and services to patients 
through a health system–owned spe-
cialty pharmacy.
Performance measurement. Over-
all, 69.7% of hospitals used key metrics 
(sometimes referred to as a dashboard 
or a balanced scorecard) to measure 
performance (Table 13). The use of 
metrics varied by hospital size. For 
example, 50.0% of hospitals with 
fewer than 50 staffed beds were using 
key metrics, compared with 76.1% of 
hospitals with 50–99 beds, 75.7% of 
hospitals with 100–199 beds, 85.7% 
of hospitals with 200–299 beds, 
84.1% of hospitals with 300–399 
beds, 87.2% of hospitals with 400–
599 beds, and 84.8% of hospitals 
with 600 or more staffed beds.
At hospitals reporting the use of 
administrative and operational met-
rics, pharmacy departments tracked 
and monitored trends in financial 
metrics (84.2%); pharmacists’ clini-
cal interventions (73.7%); workload 
and productivity measures (72.5%); 
dispensing and distribution mea-
sures, including turnaround times, 
missing doses, and dispensing er-
rors (54.5%); inventory measures, 
including 
shortages, 
“stockouts,” 
and turnover (52.7%); and metrics 
recommended by the ASHP Practice 
Advancement Initiative (formerly 
called the Pharmacy Practice Model 
Initiative) (11.0%).
With regard to quality and out-
comes metrics, pharmacy depart-
ments reported tracking and moni-
toring trends in Hospital Consumer 
Assessment of Healthcare Provid-
ers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores 
(64.5%), national quality goals (e.g., 
National Patient Safety Goals, Partner-
ship for Patients Goals) (58.5%), pa-
tient satisfaction (50.3%), and 30-day 
readmissions (48.2%).
Hospitals reporting the use of 
medication safety metrics indicated 
that pharmacy departments tracked 
and monitored trends in ADEs or 
medication errors reported by staff or 
patients (91.9%), technology utiliza-

Medication order review. Over-
all, 86.2% of hospitals responding to 
the 2015 national survey had a meth-
od for pharmacists to review and enter 
medication orders on demand (Table 
14 and Figure 6). Having the phar-
macy department open and staffed 24 
hours a day, seven days a week was the 
most common method (41.6%), fol-
lowed by using an affiliated hospital 
with 24-hour services (16.8%), having 
a telepharmacy company provide af-
terhours medication order review and 
entry (16.6%); 11.2% of hospitals had 
an employee pharmacist on call or 
at a remote location to provide these 
services, and 13.8% of hospitals re-
ported that orders were not reviewed 
by a pharmacist when the pharmacy 
department was closed. Smaller hos-
pitals were more likely than larger 
ones to not provide for order review 
when the pharmacy department was 
closed (Table 14). Regardless of the 
method used, the percentage of hos-
pitals in which medication orders 
are not reviewed by a pharmacist has 
declined. The percentage of hospitals 
not reviewing orders afterhours has 
declined annually since 2005, when 
59.6% of hospitals did not provide af-
terhours order review.1-5,7-10
Overall, 19.7% of hospitals re-
ported providing remote order review 
to an affiliated hospital. This statistic 
differed significantly by hospital size, 
with 34.5% of the largest hospitals (600 
or more staffed beds) providing the ser-
vice, as compared with 41.3% of hospi-
tals with 400–599 beds, 35.7% of those 
with 300–399 beds, 26.8% of those with 
200–299 beds, 17.6% of those with 100–
199 beds, 22.7% of those with 50–99 
beds, and 8.3% of those with fewer 
than 50 staffed beds (uncorrected 
c2 = 20.3457, df = 6, design-based 
F[4.39, 1268.91] = 3.8348, p = 0.0031). 
The percentage of hospitals provid-
ing remote order review to an affili-
ated hospital increased from 14.6% in 
2014 to 19.7% in 2015.1
Pharmacy operations. Informa-
tion about pharmacy operations col-
lected through the survey provided 
useful data for pharmacy managers. 
However, caution should be exercised 
when reviewing and interpreting these 
data. The numbers presented are aver-
ages of available reported data. Every 
hospital offered unique services, and 
these data are not benchmarks or best 
practices.

Acquisition cost. Per definitions 
used in the national survey, inpatient 
pharmaceutical acquisition costs in-
cluded all drug products, blood prod-
ucts, and diagnostic agents but ex-
cluded i.v. fluids and administration 
sets. Larger hospitals had higher in-
patient and outpatient expenditures. 
The mean ± S.E. inpatient acquisi-
tion cost per patient-day was $155.79 
± $8.26. The mean ± S.E. inpatient 
acquisition cost per admission was 
$663.61 ± $36.11.
Staffing. The number of phar-
macist full-time equivalents (FTEs) 
per hospital averaged 11.4 and varied 
by hospital size (Table 15); the larger 
the hospital, the higher the number 
of pharmacist FTEs. The number of 
pharmacy technician FTEs averaged 
11.0 and also varied by hospital size, 
with larger hospitals having a higher 
mean number of technician FTEs.
The average number of pharmacist 
FTEs per 100 occupied beds (average 
daily census) among all hospitals was 
15.6 (Table 15); the average number of 
pharmacy technician FTEs per 100 oc-
cupied beds among all hospitals was 
14.8. These statistics varied by hos-
pital size, with the smallest hospitals 
having more pharmacist and pharma-
cy technician FTEs per 100 occupied 
beds.
A given hospital’s staffing levels 
can be compared with the national av-
erage for comparably sized hospitals 
by finding the average number of FTEs 
per 100 occupied beds for the corre-
sponding size category, multiplying 
that number by the hospital’s average 
daily census, and dividing by 100. 
Staff vacancies. The survey data 
indicate that at the time of the survey, 
2.3% of pharmacist FTE positions and 
5.1% of pharmacy technician FTE po-
sitions were vacant (Table 15); these 
percentages were calculated as the 
ratio of vacant to budgeted FTE posi-
tions overall and within each hospital 
size category.
Staff credentials. Respondents 
to the 2015 survey indicated that 
24.0% of inpatient hospital pharma-
cists had completed a postgraduate 
year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residency, 
5.9% had completed a postgraduate 
year 2 (PGY2) pharmacy residency, 
and 16.6% of inpatient hospital phar-
macists had earned board certifica-
tion through the Board of Pharmacy 
Specialties (BPS) (Table 16). Fur-
thermore, 77.5% of pharmacy tech-
nicians were certified through the 
Pharmacy Technician Certification 
Board, and 17.5% had completed an 
ASHP-accredited technician train-
ing program. Relative to pharmacists

Staff time allocation. Phar-
macy directors participating in the 
survey were asked to estimate cur-
rent and future pharmacist and

36.0% to clinical activities, 8.4% to 
administrative management, 7.9% to

0.5% to other activities; such a reallo-
cation would represent an increased 
emphasis on clinical activities, with 
relative decreases in amounts of 
time spent on order review and veri-
fication and drug distribution.
The survey data indicated that, on 
average, pharmacy technicians de-
voted 3.2% of their time to order proc-
essing and entry, 77.5% to traditional 
drug preparation and distribution, 
10.1% to nontraditional activities, 
8.8% to administrative activities, and 
0.5% to other activities (Table 17). The 
reported allocation of pharmacy tech-
nicians’ time has not changed sub-
stantially since 2010, when surveyed 
pharmacy 
directors 
reported 
that 
technicians spent 6.9% of their time on 
processing and entry, 76.6% on tradi-
tional drug preparation and distribu-
tion, 7.7% on nontraditional activities, 
8.1% on administrative activities, and 
0.6 on other activities.5 However, there 
has been a small increase in techni-
cian time devoted to nontraditional 
activities, with an associated decrease 
in time spent on order-entry activi-
ties. When asked about a desired future 
time allocation, directors reported that 
pharmacy technicians would ideally 
spend 5.5% of their time on order pro-
cessing and entry, 64.9% on traditional 
drug preparation and distribution, 
20.2% on nontraditional activities, 
9.0% on administrative activities, and 
0.4% on other activities; that realloca-
tion would represent an increase in 
nontraditional activities and a decrease 
in time spent on traditional drug prep-
aration and distribution.

Discussion
The survey response rate was low-
er than in past years and has been de-
clining in recent years despite chang-
es made to make the survey easier for 
respondents. For example, the num-
ber of questions has been reduced 
by more than half since the 2012–14 
surveys. An option to respond to the 
survey electronically was made avail-
able. Accepted methods for survey 
research continued to be employed, 
including contacting prospective re-
spondents before, at the time of, and 
after distribution of the survey in-
strument. Despite the lower response 
rate, we feel the 2015 survey results 
are a valid reflection of the current

state of medication-use management 
and the role that pharmacists play in 
that area.
The monitoring of drug therapy is 
important after a treatment decision is 
made. While this is a shared responsi-
bility, pharmacists have an important 
role, and the results of the survey show 
that the percentage of patients moni-
tored by pharmacists is increasing. 
During the past 12 years, the propor-
tion of surveyed hospitals in which 
pharmacists were monitoring medi-
cation therapy in the majority of pa-
tients increased from 20.3% to 57.8%. 
The growth of electronic health infor-
mation has likely contributed to this 
increase, as more than 40% of hospi-
tals in the 2015 survey reported us-
ing computerized data-mining func-
tionality to identify patients in need 
of pharmacist monitoring. Abnormal

laboratory values that should prompt 
dosage adjustment were the most 
common trigger used.
A more comprehensive approach 
to improving medication use is drug 
therapy management. In addition to 
monitoring, this approach includes 
selecting appropriate drug therapies, 
educating patients, and continually 
assessing outcomes of therapy. It is 
impressive that more than half (53.2%) 
of hospitals reported having phar-
macists routinely assigned to provide 
drug therapy management services at 
least eight hours per day, five days per 
week—a major increase from 34.2% in 
2011.
Direct interaction between phar-
macists and patients, including pa-
tient education and (more recently) 
medication reconciliation, has always 
been a challenge; nurses have often 
performed these activities because 
they are greater in number and their 
workplace is routinely closer to pa-
tients. Despite that, pharmacists and 
pharmacy technicians are becoming 
more involved in patient education 
and medication reconciliation. For 
example, while two thirds of hospi-
tals participating in the 2015 survey 
reported that nurses were primarily 
responsible for collecting medication 
regimen information at admission, 
that figure had declined from 79.4% 
in 2012; in contrast, this is a growing 
area of responsibility for pharmacy 
staff, with the percentages of hospitals 
reporting primary roles for pharma-
cists and pharmacy technicians in-
creasing from 2.0% to 5.5% and from 
2.9% to 10.4%, respectively, during 
the same time frame. The proportion 
of hospitals indicating primary phar-
macist responsibility for disseminat-
ing medication regimen information 
at discharge increased from 1.6% to 
7.3% from 2012 to 2015. In the 2015 
survey, a third of hospitals reported 
that pharmacists routinely conducted 
discharge medication counseling for 
at-risk patients. 
The Health Information Technol-
ogy for Economic and Clinical Health 
(HITECH) Act promoted the adoption 
and meaningful use of health infor-
mation technology.22 The federal in-
vestment in fostering the implemen-
tation of electronic health information 
systems through the HITECH Act ap-
pears to have accelerated adoption 
of tools that can improve medication 
use. Almost all hospitals represented 
in the current survey had partially 
or completely implemented EHRs. 
Integral parts of electronic health in-
formation systems that have the po-
tential to improve medication use are 
CPOE and BCMA systems. These two 
medication safety systems were in use 
in the majority of U.S. hospitals in the 
2015 survey regardless of hospital size.
Another positive change result-
ing from electronic health informa-
tion systems and related technologies 
is the increase in the percentage of 
medication orders that are reviewed

by a pharmacist before a dose is avail-
able for administration to a patient. 
In the past, this required the presence 
of a pharmacist in the hospital and, 
ideally, a 24-hour pharmacy service. 
Prescriptions and clinical informa-
tion about the patient are now avail-
able electronically so that medication 
order review can take place remotely. 
With the use of automated dispens-
ing cabinets, access to a medication 
can be restricted until after a phar-
macist has reviewed the prescription. 
As a result, the percentage of medica-
tion orders that are not reviewed by a 
pharmacist has declined dramatically, 
from almost 60% to less than 14%, in 
the past 10 years.
Mobile devices have the poten-
tial to facilitate access to informa-
tion, improve communication among 
caregivers and with patients, enhance 
medication order entry and review, 
and streamline documentation of pa-
tient care activities. Pharmacists were 
using tablet computers and smart-
phones to provide patient care in 40% 
of hospitals represented in the cur-
rent survey. 
Specialty pharmacies constitute an 
emerging channel of the supply chain 
that grew out of the unique needs 
of transplant patients for expensive 
medications not widely available 
from pharmacies. The rapid growth 
in the use of costly medications, in-
cluding biologicals, has resulted in 
the rapid growth of this new type of 
pharmacy. Hospitals are just getting 
started developing their strategies for 
distribution of specialty pharmaceu-
ticals. More than 80% of hospitals in 
the 2015 survey did not have a formal 
specialty pharmacy business model. 
The most commonly used model 
was outsourcing of specialty phar-
macy services to an outside vendor, 
but that practice was reported by less 
than 10% of hospitals. An even smaller 
proportion of hospitals had their own 
specialty pharmacy operating either 
within existing pharmacy space or as 
a standalone, health system–owned 
pharmacy. Those percentages could 
be expected to increase as the num-
ber of expensive medications in use 
increases and as hospitals and health 
systems develop strategies for manag-
ing these drugs.
Conclusion
The role of pharmacists in measur-
ing, monitoring, and managing medi-
cation use in health systems contin-
ues to be significant, important, and 
growing. The evolution of electronic 
health information and technolo-
gies that make this information more 
readily available to patients is trans-
forming healthcare in a positive way 
and enabling pharmacists to more 
efficiently contribute to improving 
medication use.
