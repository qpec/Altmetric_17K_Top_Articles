Mountcastle and colleagues proposed that the posterior parietal
cortex contains a “command apparatus” for the operation of the hand
in immediate extrapersonal space [Mountcastle et al. (1975)
J Neurophysiol 38(4):871–908]. Here we provide three lines of con-
verging evidence that a lateral region within area 5 has corticospinal
neurons that are directly linked to the control of hand movements.
First, electrical stimulation in a lateral region of area 5 evokes finger
and wrist movements. Second, corticospinal neurons in the same region
of area 5 terminate at spinal locations that contain last-order interneu-
rons that innervate hand motoneurons. Third, this lateral region of area
5 contains many neurons that make disynaptic connections with hand
motoneurons. The disynaptic input to motoneurons from this portion
of area 5 is as direct and prominent as that from any of the premotor
areas in the frontal lobe. Thus, our results establish that a region within
area 5 contains a motor area with corticospinal neurons that could
function as a command apparatus for operation of the hand.

n a landmark paper, Mountcastle and his colleagues proposed
that the posterior parietal cortex contains “a command appa-
ratus for operation of the limbs, hands and eyes within immediate
extrapersonal space” (1, p. 871). This hypothesis was based, in
part, on the observation that some neurons in areas 5 and 7 were
activated not by sensory stimuli but by the animal reaching for or
manipulating a desired object. These “arm-projection” and “hand-
manipulation” neurons were not active during other movements in
which the same muscles were used. Instead, their activity was
“conditional in nature” and dependent on the animal’s intention
to explore the immediate surrounding space manually.
The development of the command hypothesis led Mountcastle
and colleagues to reinterpret some of the consequences of parietal
lobe damage: “We propose that several of the abnormalities of
function that occur in humans and in monkeys after lesions of the
parietal lobe can be understood as deficits of volition, of the will to
explore with hand and eye the contralateral half-field of space ... ”
(1, p. 905) and “We infer that these defects reflect the loss of a
particular source of commands for movement” (1, p. 901).
The command hypothesis represented a fundamental paradigm
shift in concepts about the function of the posterior parietal cortex.
The prevailing view at the time was that the cortical areas within the
posterior parietal cortex were part of the “association cortex.”
These cortical regions were thought to construct higher-order sen-
sory representations based on input from primary and secondary
sensory areas. In addition, they were thought to play a role in the
integration of information from multiple sensory modalities. The
results of this integration then could be used by other cortical areas
and subcortical motor centers to guide movement. The command
hypothesis was novel in viewing the posterior parietal cortex as
containing a mechanism to construct and issue motor command
signals for movements made to objects of interest in the imme-
diate extrapersonal space. The command hypothesis was sup-
ported by the demonstration of inputs from the posterior parietal
cortex to motor areas in the frontal lobe that could mediate the
parietal commands to the spinal cord for execution (2–5).
Here we show that a lateral region within area 5 has a disy-
naptic projection to hand motoneurons in the spinal cord. We
provide evidence that this disynaptic connection is mediated
by corticospinal connections with last-order interneurons that
project to distal hand motoneurons. This connection provides
the posterior parietal cortex with the potential to control mo-
toneuron activity directly at the spinal level.
Results
Intracortical Stimulation in Lateral Area 5. In two rhesus monkeys,
we used intracortical stimulation (0.2-ms cathodal pulses, 333 Hz,
100- to 200-ms train duration, 10–300 μA) to map the motor
representation in a lateral region of area 5. We explored cortex in
the anterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus (PEip) and on the
adjacent cortical surface (PE) along a 5-mm region beginning at
the lateral edge of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) (Fig. 1 A and B).
We mapped this region because prior studies have shown it
projects to the spinal cord (6–9) and because cortical neurons
with disynaptic input to hand motoneurons are located there
(see below).
Stimulation in this lateral region of area 5 reliably evoked
movements of the contralateral hand in 25 of 35 sites tested (Fig.
1B). The threshold for evoking movement was as low as 50 μA
(in two sites) but generally was higher (166 ± 55 μA, mean ±
SD). In most instances, stimulation evoked movements of the
thumb and finger in isolation (22 sites). Combined thumb and
finger movements were evoked at two sites, and combined wrist
and finger movements were evoked at one site. These results are
consistent with the many prior studies that have been able to
Significance
The primate hand has evolved into a specialized sensorimotor
device that can grasp, explore, and manipulate objects with
extraordinary skill. The frontal lobe is generally thought to be
the exclusive source of descending commands to the spinal cord
to control hand movements. Here, we identify a region within
the parietal lobe that could also contribute commands to control
hand movements directly at spinal levels. Intracortical stimulation
in a lateral region in area 5 of posterior parietal cortex reliably
evokes hand movements. Corticospinal neurons in this region
make disynaptic connections with hand motoneurons. These
observations suggest that a region within lateral area 5 contains
a unique command apparatus that could assist in generating
dexterous finger movements required during haptic behavior.

 evoke a range of limb, eye, or face movements by intracortical
stimulation in regions of the posterior parietal cortex (5, 10–14).
One of these prior studies demonstrated that finger and grasping
movements could be evoked by stimulation in a lateral portion of
area 2 on the cortical surface of macaques (5). Our results extend
this observation by demonstrating a distal hand representation in
a lateral region of area 5 within the IPS.
Spinal Termination of Efferents from Lateral Area 5. We placed
multiple, small injections of cholera-toxin subunit B [CTb, 2%
(vol/vol) in distilled water] into the hand representation defined
by intracortical stimulation (shaded region in Fig. 1B). Then we
used anterograde transport of the tracer to define the pattern of
termination of efferents in cervical segments (C2–T2) of the spinal
cord (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). We observed labeling exclusively on
the side of the spinal cord that was contralateral to the cortical
injection. We found CTb labeling throughout segments C2–T2 in
portions of Rexed laminae II–VII (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). The
labeling was densest at C8 medially in portions of laminae IV–VI.
The pattern of spinal terminations that we observed is similar to
findings reported for efferents from “area 2/5” (15) but is different
from another study of terminations from “area 5” (16). The
variation in these findings likely results from the involvement of
different portions of areas 2 and 5 in the injection sites.
Last-Order Interneurons Innervating Hand Motoneurons. We injected
single hand muscles of two rhesus monkeys with rabies virus (N2c
strain) and used retrograde transneuronal transport of the virus
to identify the last-order interneurons in the spinal cord with
monosynaptic input to hand motoneurons. One of these animals
received an injection of rabies virus into the abductor pollicis
longus (APL), and the other received an injection into the
extensor digitorum communis (EDC). The survival time in
these animals was just long enough to allow virus transport to
second-order neurons in the spinal cord (Fig. 2A, filled neurons
designated “2 IN” in the diagram) but was not long enough
to allow transport to other second-order neurons at more
remote sites, such as the red nucleus and cerebral cortex (Fig.
2A, filled neurons designated “2 RM” and “2 CM,” respectively, in
the diagram).
The distribution of second-order neurons in the spinal cord was
comparable in these two animals. In both, we found labeled inter-
neurons bilaterally mainly in spinal segments C4–T3 (Fig. 3 and Fig.
S1A). However, the great majority (90–95%) of the labeled inter-
neurons were located in spinal gray matter ipsilateral to the injected
muscle. We found labeled interneurons distributed throughout
Rexed laminae IV–VIII (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1A). Dense clusters of
labeled interneurons were present in both the dorsal horn, espe-
cially medially, and in the intermediate zone of the spinal cord.
Along the rostro–caudal axis, labeled interneurons displayed a
unimodal distribution that peaked in C8 but extended as far rostrally
as mid C2 and as far caudally as mid T4 (Fig. 3B, small filled circles).
Even so, 91–96% of all labeled interneurons were found in segments
C5–T2. The peak in the distribution of interneurons is slightly rostral
to the peak in the distribution of APL and EDC motoneurons in
lamina IX (Fig. 3B, small filled squares; also see ref. 17).
We next compared the distribution of corticospinal termina-
tions from the injection sites in lateral area 5 with the distribution

Circuits mediating retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus
from single muscles. (A) Labeling of second-order neurons. After an injection
of rabies virus into a single muscle, virus is transported in the retrograde
direction to infect first-order neurons (1) that innervate the muscle (moto-
neurons, MNs). Then, virus moves transsynaptically in the retrograde di-
rection
to infect second-order neurons (2) that make
monosynaptic
connections with the infected motoneurons. These neurons include spinal
interneurons (IN), rubromotoneuronal (RM) cells, dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
cells that innervate muscle spindle afferents, and corticomotoneuronal cells
(CM) in New M1 layer V (18, 19). (B) Labeling of third-order neurons. At
longer survival times, rabies virus undergoes another stage of retrograde,
transneuronal transport to infect third-order neurons (3) that make mono-
synaptic connections with the infected second-order neurons. Labeled third-
order neurons include corticospinal neurons in layer V of cortical areas such
as the Old M1 (ref. 19), corticorubral neurons in layer V of the cerebral
cortex, and neurons in layer III of New M1. CST, corticospinal tract.

 of last-order spinal interneurons innervating APL and EDC mo-
toneurons (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1). Although these experiments were
performed in different animals, it is clear that the medial region of
the dorsal horn where corticospinal terminations are the densest
(Rexed laminae IV–VI) also contains last-order interneurons that
innervate hand motoneurons (Fig. 4C). For example, the overlap
between corticospinal terminations and last-order interneurons is
clearly evident at C8. CTb terminations from the injection site into
lateral area 5 were especially dense medially in the dorsal horn
(Fig. 4B). The same region of the dorsal horn contains substantial
numbers of second-order neurons infected through retrograde
transneuronal transport of rabies virus from a virus injection into
APL (Fig. 4A). In the next section we provide evidence that this
overlap reflects synaptic input from corticospinal efferents in lateral
area 5 to last-order interneurons innervating hand motoneurons.
Disynaptic Connection from Lateral Area 5 to Hand Motoneurons. In
seven monkeys, we used transneuronal transport of rabies virus
from single muscles to define regions of the cerebral cortex that
contained neurons with disynaptic input to motoneurons. To do
so, we adjusted the survival time to label third-order neurons in
the cerebral cortex (designated “3” in Fig. 2B). We placed virus
injections into single hand (EDC; n = 2; APL; n = 1), elbow
(long head of biceps, BIC; n = 2), and shoulder (spinodeltoid,
SPD; n = 2) muscles.
Cortical areas with third-order neurons included the portion
of area 4 on the surface of the precentral gyrus (“Old M1”), the
portion of area 4 in the anterior bank of the central sulcus (“New
M1”), several premotor areas in the frontal lobe, and, notably, a
lateral region of area 5 (Figs. 5 and 6) (see also refs. 18 and 19).
Third-order neurons in area 5 were found in lateral parts of
areas PE and PEip on the convexity of the post central gyrus and
in the anterior bank of the IPS (Figs. 5 and 6). Small numbers of
labeled neurons also were present in adjacent portions of so-
matosensory area 2. As expected from our prior studies, labeled
neurons in the New M1 were located in supra- and infra-granular
layers as well as in layer V (see figure 5 in ref. 19). In contrast,
the labeled neurons in all other cortical areas, including the
lateral portion of area 5, were confined to layer V.
The absolute number of third-order neurons labeled in different
cortical areas varied from animal to animal (Table S1). In general,
we found more third-order neurons labeled in the Old M1 and in
the dorsal premotor area (PMd) after virus transport from proxi-
mal muscles than after transport from distal muscles (Table S1). In
contrast, we found many more third-order neurons labeled in the
lateral portion of area 5 after virus transport from distal muscles
than after transport from proximal muscles (Figs. 5 and 6).
For comparisons across animals (Table S1), we grouped ani-
mals according to the muscle injected: proximal or distal (Fig. 7).
Then we normalized the data from animals relative to the
number of neurons labeled in the Old M1. This analysis revealed
that virus transport from proximal and distal muscles labeled
comparable percentages of third-order neurons in the PMd. On
the other hand, the percentage of labeled neurons in the lateral
region of area 5 after virus injections into distal muscles was
20 times greater than the percentage labeled after transport from
proximal muscles (Fig. 7). Thus our results indicate that a lateral
region of area 5 has representations of the proximal and the

 distal forelimb, but the distal representation is clearly larger both
in terms of its size (Figs. 5 and 6) and the number of output
neurons (Figs. 5–7). In addition, although the relative number of
third-order neurons in the hand representation in lateral area
5 is less than half that in Old M1, the relative number in the hand
representation of lateral area 5 is more than 1.5 times that in the
PMd. This result raises the possibility that a lateral region of area
5 has a more substantial influence over the generation of hand
movements (at the spinal level) than the PMd.
Discussion
Overall, we provide three lines of converging evidence that a
lateral region within area 5 has corticospinal neurons that are
directly linked to the control of hand movements. First, electrical
stimulation in a lateral region of area 5 evokes finger and wrist
movements. Second, corticospinal neurons in the same region of
area 5 terminate at spinal locations that contain last-order in-
terneurons that innervate hand motoneurons. Third, the lateral
region of area 5 contains many neurons that make disynaptic
connections with hand motoneurons. The disynaptic input to
motoneurons from area 5 is as direct and prominent as that from
any of the premotor areas in the frontal lobe. Thus, our results
establish that a lateral region of area 5 contains a motor area
with corticospinal neurons that could function as a command
apparatus for operation of the hand.
In support of the concept that a portion of posterior parietal
cortex contains a motor area, Gardner and colleagues have found
neurons in the lateral region of area 5 that discharge during the
manipulation of objects (20–22). In fact, the firing rates of many
neurons at this site increase before the hand makes contact with
an object, peak at object contact, and decline when grasp of an
object is secure (21, 23). These observations suggest that neurons
in this lateral region of area 5 contribute to the initiation of hand
movements required for grasping and manipulating objects.
Lateral area 5 is not the only region in the parietal cortex that
is involved in motor control of the hand and arm. Other portions
of areas 5 and 7 in the superior and inferior parietal lobules
contain regions that are involved in different aspects of reaching
and grasping (for references and reviews see 24, 25, 26, and 27).
In addition, Gharbawie et al. (5) found that hand movements can
be evoked from a region of area 2 that is just rostral to the motor
area we identified. However, the motor area in lateral area 5 is
unique among these parietal modules in having relatively direct
access to motor output via corticospinal neurons that make
disynaptic connections with hand motoneurons.
It is noteworthy that corticospinal neurons in lateral area 5 gain
access to motoneurons in a manner comparable to other motor
areas in the frontal lobe. Specifically, the region of medial lamina
V–VI that receives corticospinal input from lateral area 5 also re-
ceives corticospinal input from M1, the supplementary motor area,
and the caudal cingulate motor areas on the dorsal and ventral
banks of the cingulate sulcus (28). Thus, this spinal region may be a
site where multiple descending systems converge on a set of last-
order interneurons that influence the control of hand movements.
In the cat, the same region of medial lamina V–VI contains
interneurons that receive input from cutaneous afferents (29).

 Many of these interneurons receive excitatory input from corti-
cospinal (and rubrospinal) efferents and are last-order interneu-
rons that excite or inhibit motoneurons that innervate distal
forelimb muscles (30). It is tempting to speculate that cortico-
spinal efferents from lateral area 5 of the monkey are activating
this system of interneurons. If so, the input from lateral area
5 could function to regulate the flow of somatosensory in-
formation to hand motoneurons and assist in the command of
finger movements involved in active touch during haptic behavior.
This proposal fits with the consequences of posterior parietal
lesions in humans at sites potentially homologous to the motor
area in lateral area 5. The lesions in humans typically induce
tactile apraxia, which is characterized by “severe abnormalities of
exploratory finger movements, despite normal frequencies of
repetitive finger movements and almost normal force pro-
duction” (31). The deficit in tactile apraxia appears to represent
an isolated disturbance of the fine dexterous hand movements
that are required to interact with an object. A similar, although
less dramatic, deficit has been observed in the monkey following
lesions to lateral area 5 (32). Tactile apraxia in humans is gen-
erally accompanied by an impairment of tactile gnosis (aster-
eognosis). Thus, corticospinal signals originating from lateral
area 5 could be part of a command system for active touch that
requires the tight interplay between tactile perception and fine
finger movement.
The existence of a motor area in lateral area 5 is surprising
given the classical view that the central sulcus represents the
functional dividing line between motor and sensory cortex.
According to this view, cortical areas anterior to the central
sulcus are involved in the generation of movement and are the
main source of descending motor commands to the spinal cord.
In contrast, cortical areas posterior to the central sulcus are in-
volved in processing sensory information and are the target of as-
cending signals about events occurring in the periphery (however,
see ref. 33). Mountcastle’s command hypothesis clearly violated
this functional subdivision because it proposed that the posterior
parietal cortex generates commands for movements in immediate
extrapersonal space (1). Subsequent studies demonstrated the
presence of dense projections from the posterior parietal cortex to
motor areas in the frontal lobe that could mediate the parietal

 commands to the spinal cord for execution (2–5). Our findings are
noteworthy because they show that a localized region within the
posterior parietal cortex has a direct anatomical route to access
motor output at the spinal level. In fact, the access to motor output
from lateral area 5 is comparable to that from the premotor areas
in the frontal lobe. These data clearly fit Mountcastle’s view that
the posterior parietal cortex has a command function. This view
also is supported by the classic observations of Fleming and Crosby
(34) that the motor responses evoked by electrical stimulation of
the posterior parietal cortex persist even after removal of the motor
cortex. Our results provide further support for the perspective that
the central generation and control of movement depends on
descending commands from multiple cortical motor areas, now
including a portion of lateral area 5 (35). Indeed, Mountcastle and
colleagues emphasized that the “concept of command centers ex-
plicitly assumes that there exist within the central nervous system
many sources of commands to the motor apparatus” (1, p. 902).
Materials and Methods
This report is based on 11 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). In two
animals (JA65: male, 13 y old, 10.4 kg, and JA67: female, 4.4 y old, 4.8 kg),
we used intracortical stimulation to map a lateral region in area 5 before an
injection of a conventional anatomical tracer, CTb. In the remaining nine
animals (five males and four females, 2.9–4.9 y old, 3.3–5.7 kg), we injected
rabies virus into a single forelimb muscle.
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with National
Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the relevant Institutional
Animal Care and Use and Biosafety Committees. The procedures for handling
rabies virus and animals infected with rabies have been described previously (36,
37) and are in accordance with or exceed the recommendations from the De-
partment of Health and Human Services (Biosafety in Microbiological and
Biomedical Procedures). Most of our procedures have been described fully in
prior publications (for intracortical stimulation and tracer injections, see refs.
38–41; for injections of rabies virus into single muscles, see refs. 18 and 19) and
are summarized in SI Materials and Methods. The data that support the find-
ings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.
