IMPORTANCE Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to bone, and bone metastases are
associated with pathologic fractures, pain, and reduced survival. Bone disease is routinely
visualized using the technetium Tc 99m (99mTc) bone scan; however, the standard
interpretation of bone scan data relies on subjective manual assessment of counting
metastatic lesion numbers. There is an unmet need for an objective and fully quantitative
assessment of bone scan data.
OBJECTIVE To clinically assess in a prospectively defined analysis plan of a clinical trial the
automated Bone Scan Index (aBSI) as an independent prognostic determinant of overall
survival (OS) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a prospectively planned analysis
of the aBSI in a phase 3 multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
of tasquinimod (10TASQ10). Men with bone metastatic chemotherapy-naïve CRPC were
recruited at 241 sites in 37 countries between March 2011 and August 2015. The statistical
analysis plan to clinically evaluate the aBSI was prospectively defined and locked before
unmasking of the 10TASQ10 study. The analysis of aBSI was conducted between May 25,
2016, and June 3, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The associations of baseline aBSI with OS, radiographic
progression-free survival (rPFS), time to symptomatic progression, and time to opiate use for
cancer pain.
RESULTS Of the total 1245 men enrolled, 721 were evaluable for the aBSI. The mean (SD) age
(available for 719 men) was 70.6 (8.0) years (age range, 47-90 years). The aBSI population
was representative of the total study population based on baseline characteristics. The aBSI
(median, 1.07; range, 0-32.60) was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.20;
95% CI, 1.14-1.26; P < .001). The median OS by aBSI quartile (lowest to highest) was 34.7, 27.3,
21.7, and 13.3 months, respectively. The discriminative ability of the aBSI (C index, 0.63) in
prognosticating OS was significantly higher than that of the manual lesion counting (C index,
0.60) (P = .03). In a multivariable survival model, a higher aBSI remained independently
associated with OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .03). A higher aBSI was also independently
associated with time to symptomatic progression (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23; P < .001) and
time to opiate use for cancer pain (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To date, this investigation is the largest prospectively
analyzed study to validate the aBSI as an independent prognostic imaging biomarker of
survival in mCRPC. These data support the prognostic utility of the aBSI as an objective
imaging biomarker in the design and eligibility of clinical trials of systemic therapies for
patients with mCRPC.

 M
ore than 90% of men with lethal metastatic castra-
tion-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have bone
metastasis.1 Bone scanning of preinjected techne-
tium Tc 99m (99mTc) is the standard imaging modality for bone
metastases in prostate cancer and is ubiquitously used in clini-
cal trials to stage and monitor the course of skeletal disease
burden. This technique measures tumor activity indirectly
based on osteoblastic activity in the tumor microenviron-
ment. The current standard of bone scan assessment relies on
manual assessment of counting metastatic lesion numbers,2
which remains semiquantitative and open to variability be-
cause of subjective interpretation. Variability in the assess-
mentoftumorburdencanlimittheclinicalutilityofbonescans
in accurate staging of mCRPC. As the therapeutic options in
mCRPC increase, more accurate and reproducible assess-
ment of total skeletal disease burden is needed.
The Bone Scan Index (BSI) is a quantitative assessment of
bone scan data that represents the total tumor burden as the
fraction of total skeleton weight.3 The BSI methods were de-
veloped to represent the total pathophysiology of bone in-
volvement in prostate cancer as a single numeric index, which
can be objective in staging and monitoring of disease. In pre-
liminary studies,4,5 the BSI has shown clinical utility as a prog-
nostic and progression biomarker to assess the association be-
tweentherapyandboneburden.Despitedemonstratingclinical
utility, the application and dissemination of the BSI in clini-
cal practice have been limited because of the laborious manual
calculations, which have been reported to take up to 30 min-
utes per scan in patients with extensive bone metastasis.6
The BSI methods have been automated with artificial neu-
ral networks to detect and classify metastatic hot spots in bone
scans, with minimal manual supervision.6 Analytical valida-
tiondemonstratedthattheautomatedBSI(aBSI)platformgives
accurate and reproducible assessments in low-burden to high-
burden disease (r = 0.99; P < .001) and minimizes interopera-
tor variability (κ = 0.96; P < .001).7,8 Compared with manual
BSI calculation, the output from the aBSI platform is several
magnitudes faster (5 seconds per scan), and it is 100% repro-
ducible in repeated testing of the same scan, irrespective of
the reader.
Several preliminary studies9-13 have shown aBSI assess-
ment to be a prognostic biomarker for mCRPC. However, the
scope of all previous studies in demonstrating the clinical util-
ity of the aBSI as a prognostic biomarker has been limited be-
cause of the nature of retrospective ad hoc analyses. In addi-
tion, previous investigations of the independent association
of the aBSI with overall survival (OS) have lacked predictive
models that include all known significant prognostic biomark-
ers in mCRPC.14
The primary objective of the present study was to per-
form a prospectively defined analysis to clinically assess the
aBSI as an independent prognostic determinant of OS in men
with mCRPC. In the multivariable setting, the aBSI was also
evaluated against all known prognostic biomarkers and clini-
cal end points in mCRPC. The aBSI analysis was incorporated
into a phase 3 multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial of tasquinimod (10TASQ10 study) in
mCRPC.
Methods
Study Design
This investigation was a prospectively planned analysis of the
aBSI in a phase 3 multicenter randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlledclinicaltrialoftasquinimod(10TASQ10study),
a small-molecule inhibitor of myeloid suppressor cell activity
and immune-mediated angiogenesis. The 10TASQ10 study15
has been previously described in detail. Briefly, men with bone
metastatic chemotherapy-naive CRPC were recruited at 241
sitesin37countriesbetweenMarch2011,andAugust2015,and
were assigned 2:1 to receive tasquinimod or placebo until pro-
gression or toxic effects. The analysis of aBSI was conducted
between May 25, 2016, and June 3, 2017.
The statistical analysis plan to clinically evaluate the aBSI
was prospectively defined and locked before unmasking of the
10TASQ10 study. As the primary objective of this statistical
analysis plan, baseline aBSI was evaluated against OS, de-
fined as time from random assignment to death. The aBSI was
also associated with the following other clinical end points: (1)
prostatecancer–specificsurvival;(2)radiographicprogression-
free survival (rPFS), defined as time from random assign-
ment to radiologic progression or death, where radiographic
progression was defined as soft-tissue progression (Re-
sponseEvaluationCriteriainSolidTumors[RECIST]1.1),16bone
progression detected with confirmatory bone scans (Prostate
Cancer Working Group 2-3 [PCWG2-3]),2 or radiographically
confirmed spinal cord compression or fracture resulting from
malignant progression; (3) time to symptomatic progression;
and (4) time to opiate use for cancer pain.
The 10TASQ10 study was approved by the institutional re-
viewboardorethicscommitteeateachparticipatingcenterand
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Key Points
Question Is the automated Bone Scan Index an independent
prognostic determinant of overall survival in men with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer?
Findings In this secondary analysis of 721 participants in a
randomized clinical trial, the automated Bone Scan Index was
significantly associated with overall survival and remained
independently associated with overall survival in a multivariable
survival model. The automated Bone Scan Index was also
significantly associated with additional clinical end points.
Meaning This study supports the prognostic utility of the
automated Bone Scan Index in the design and eligibility of clinical
trials of systemic therapies for patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer.

 were saved in the standard Digital Imaging and Communica-
tions in Medicine (DICOM) format with uncompressed pixel
data. Image files failing one or more of these criteria were ex-
cluded from the analysis. The aBSI analysis was performed
using the automated platform developed by EXINI Diagnos-
tics AB, Lund, Sweden, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceu-
ticals, Inc (New York, New York). The aBSI was assessed ac-
cording to the software provider’
s instructions by an
experienced bone scan reviewer (L.E.) masked to study treat-
ment, other scan data, biomarker data, and clinical outcome.
The methods for the aBSI analysis of bone scans have been de-
scribed previously.6 Briefly, the different anatomic regions of
the skeleton are segmented, and abnormal hot spots are de-
tected and classified as metastatic or benign lesions. The mass
fraction of the skeleton for each metastatic hot spot is deter-
mined, and the aBSI is calculated as the sum of all such
fractions.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan to evaluate the aBSI was prospec-
tively defined and locked before unmasking of the 10TASQ10
study. Baseline statistics included percentages for categori-
caldataandmediansforcontinuousdataforthestudy,theaBSI
population, and each aBSI quartile.
Spearman rank correlation was used to evaluate the asso-
ciationofbaselineaBSIwithotherbaselineprognosticbiomark-
ers. These comprised (1) tumor pain using a visual analog scale
(VAS); (2) Karnofsky performance status (KPS); and (3) blood-
based disease biomarkers, including albumin, prostate-
specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-
reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb), alkaline phosphatase
(ALP),bone-specificALP(BAP),neutrophils,lymphocytes,and
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR).
Coxproportionalhazardsregressionmodelsbasedonstrati-
ficationfactorsforrandomization(KPS,visceralmetastases,and
geographic region) were used to analyze the associations of the
aBSIwithOSandothertime-to-eventendpoints.Covariatesthat
had a skewed distribution were log2 transformed. In addition,
the aBSI was split into 4 quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). Quartile
was used as a reference to evaluate linearity and stratification
of clinical end points.
An explorative analysis was performed to assess the dis-
criminatory ability to predict the survival outcome for the aBSI
and the standard assessment of lesion number at baseline. The
manual lesion counting denoted with “greater than 20 or too
many metastases to count” was assigned a value of 25. To ac-
commodate a comparative analysis between the aBSI and le-
sion number, the aBSI data were truncated at 15 to avoid a large
influence for extreme values. The concordance index by Uno
et al17 was used to compare the 2 variables. To further evalu-
ate the influence of the aBSI on OS, adapted subpopulation
treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP)18 was performed as an
exploratoryanalysis.Thepopulationwasdividedinto15groups
based on baseline aBSI, with 5% overlap resulting in sub-
groups of approximately 17% of the patients, to describe the
approximate median survival from low to high aBSI.
TheaBSIwasalsoevaluatedinaprospectivelydefinedmul-
tivariable survival model that was generated through back-
ward selection, where factors with P > .001 were removed and
the aBSI was always included. The Akaike information crite-
rion (AIC) and the Uno concordance index were used to evalu-
ate the prognostic model with and without the aBSI to assess
whether the aBSI has an additive prognostic influence on OS.
TheAICandtheconcordanceindexestimatethequalityofeach
survival model, relative to each of the other models, and thus
provide a means for selecting the best model (the one with the
lowest AIC score and the highest concordance index). A sen-
sitivity analysis with more standard covariates was per-
formed. P < .05 was regarded as significant hazard ratios
(HRs), and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated for each model.
No correction for multiplicity was performed. All statistical
analyses were conducted using a software program (SAS, ver-
sion 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Ofthe1245menenrolledinthephase3trial,739hadvalidbone
scans for quantitative aBSI analysis; 506 of the 1245 (40.6%)
were excluded because of the lack of a suitable bone scan in
the standard DICOM format. Another 18 men had superscans
and were excluded because of the inability of the aBSI to cap-
ture diffused high bone burden, leaving 721 men evaluable for
this analysis (Figure 1). The mean (SD) age (available for 719
men) was 70.6 (8.0) years (age range, 47-90 years).
Patient characteristics of the total population, the aBSI
population, and the aBSI quartiles are summarized in eTable
1 in the Supplement. Of the 721 aBSI-evaluable patients, 402
had 10 or more bone lesions, with the median aBSI being 1.07
(range, 0-32.60). Patients were divided into the following 4
equally sized nonoverlapping aBSI quartiles: 180 in Q1 (me-
dian,0.05;range,0-0.27),181inQ2(median,0.58;range,0.28-
1.07), 180 in Q3 (median, 2.06; range, 1.08-3.96), and 180 in
Q4 (median, 6.72; range, 3.97-32.60). Representative anterior
and posterior bone scans from each of the aBSI quartiles are
shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement.

 Associations of the aBSI With Clinical Prognostic Factors
Baseline aBSI correlated strongly with the number of bone le-
sionsatstudyentry(Spearmanrankcorrelation,0.68;P < .001),
indicating a strong association with the standard measure of
bone burden. The aBSI also had strong correlations (0.67-
0.69) with serum levels of ALP and BAP at baseline. The cor-
relation between the aBSI and PSA level was moderate at 0.48.
Correlations of the aBSI with LDH, CRP, and Hb levels and with
tumor-related pain (VAS score) were all weak (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Primary Outcome of the Association
of Baseline aBSI With OS
In the prospectively defined univariate analyses to deter-
mine the association of baseline aBSI with OS, the risk of death
(from any cause) was found to increase by 20% per doubling
of the aBSI (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26; P < .001). Estimated
median OS for aBSI Q1 was 34.7 months; for aBSI Q2, 27.3
months;foraBSIQ3,21.7months;andforaBSIQ4,13.3months.
The median OS values corresponded to a 65% reduction in the
risk of death for patients in aBSI Q1, 56% reduction in Q2, and
40%reductioninQ3comparedwithpatientsinQ4(Figure2A).
The exploratory STEPP (subpopulation treatment effect
pattern plot) analysis showed longer OS in patients with low
aBSI at baseline (eTable 3 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
The patients in subgroups with a mean baseline aBSI of 0.2 or
lower had a median OS longer than 30 months, while the pa-
tients in subgroups with a mean baseline aBSI of 5.6 or higher
had a median OS shorter than 15 months. In addition, the dis-
criminative ability of the aBSI (C index, 0.63) in prognosticat-
ing OS was significantly higher than that of the manual lesion
counting (C index, 0.60) (P = .03) among 709 men. The uni-
variate and bivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
model analysis and the corresponding concordance index are
summarized in Table 1.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression mod-
els for OS using all the significant univariate covariates were
generated through backward selection. Factors that were
dropped from the model were (in order): pain (VAS score), Hb
levels, visceral metastases, geographic region (all but Eastern
Europe), historical PSA slope, NLR, ALP levels, and KPS. The
multivariable survival model resulted in the following 5 vari-
ables that were independently associated with OS: Eastern Eu-
rope as the geographic region, values for albumin, serum PSA,
LDH, and CRP (Table 2). The aBSI remained independently as-
sociated with OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .03) after ad-
justment for these significant variables. The AIC score for the
survival model with the aBSI was 3 U lower than the AIC score
for the regression model that excluded the aBSI. The concor-
dance index was 0.01 U higher for the model with the aBSI. An

that included VAS score of 4 to 10, albumin and LDH values
exceeding 281 U/L (upper limit of normal), Hb, KPS of 80 or
less, and PSA showed similar results (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-
1.12 per log2 aBSI change; P = .03), with the AIC score improv-
ing 3 U and a concordance index of 0.71 for both models. (To
convert LDH level to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167.)
Secondary Outcomes
Finally, we evaluated baseline aBSI for associations with other
clinically important outcomes. Table 3 lists associations with
theaBSIasacontinuousvariableandbyquartilesfortheseout-
comes. The aBSI was associated with prostate cancer–
specific survival (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26; P < .001)
(Figure 2B), time to symptomatic progression (HR, 1.18; 95%
CI, 1.13-1.23; P < .001) (Figure 2C), and time to opiate use for
cancer pain (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30; P < .001) (Figure 2D).
As expected, baseline aBSI was not associated with risk of soft-
tissueprogression(HR,0.96;95%CI,0.90-1.03;P = .25);hence,
there was a moderate association with rPFS (HR, 1.08; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.13; P = .002). Multivariable analyses on the second-
ary end points using the significant covariates in Table 2
strengthened the aBSI as an independent variable for time to
symptomaticprogressionandtimetoopiateuseforcancerpain
(HR, 1.18 and 1.21, respectively; P < .001), with the concor-
dance index increasing 0.02 U for both.
Discussion
Our study met the primary objective of the prospective analy-
sis plan and demonstrated a strong prognostic association of
the aBSI with OS, and we confirmed this independent asso-
ciation of the aBSI with OS in a multivariable model with other
clinical, serological, and geographic prognostic factors. We
found that the aBSI was strongly associated with bone dis-
ease burden and osteoblastic serum bone biomarkers, such as
ALP level, but was only modestly associated with other clini-
cal factors, such as LDH and PSA values. While the number of
bone metastases is strongly correlated with the aBSI, we found
thattheaBSIprovidesadditionalprognosticdiscriminationbe-
yondlesioncounting.Forexample,apatientwithasinglelarge-
bone metastasis with a high aBSI may have a worse prognosis
than a patient with 3 small-volume bone metastases, corre-
spondingtoaloweraBSI.Notably,painscoreswereonlyweakly
associatedwiththeaBSI,reflectingtheclinicalobservationthat
some men with a high degree of skeletal metastasis may ex-
hibit little to no pain, while other men with oligometastatic
bonemetastasesmayhavesubstantialpain.Therefore,theaBSI
provides a rapid quantitative measure of bone burden with
clear prognostic utility and is strongly associated with time to
new bone metastases, time to symptomatic progression, and
time to opiate use for cancer pain.
A number of therapies in mCRPC have demonstrated sig-
nificant OS benefit, including the approved radiopharmaceu-
tical radium 223, which incorporates into hydroxyapatite and
targets areas with high bone turnover. The availability of and
exposuretosucheffectivetherapiesinmCRPCnecessitatemore
accurate staging tools for effective sequencing of available
therapies in clinical practice and for evaluating the efficacy of
novel therapeutic agents. The aBSI together with other estab-
lished clinical prognostic factors and potential predictive
biomarkers19,20 may improve our ability to identify subgroups
of men with more homogeneous outcomes for clinical trial de-
sign and stratification and for patient management.
The results for our primary objective agree with previous
retrospectiveadhocanalysesthathavedemonstratedtheprog-
nostic significance of the aBSI in mCRPC.9-13 The prospec-
tively defined evaluation in the present phase 3 study vali-
dated the independent association of the aBSI with OS in a
multivariable analysis and demonstrated the additive value of
the aBSI to the prognostic model, with a significant improve-
ment in the AIC, a measure of predictive discrimination.
The exploratory STEPP analysis demonstrated the clini-
cal value of the aBSI as a continuous quantitative radio-
graphic biomarker that is associated with OS. The aBSI has the
potential to build on the current standard of bone scan assess-
mentatbaselineeligibilityandaftertreatmentmonitoring.The
current standard of assessment by PCWG (Prostate Cancer
Working Group) criteria is semiquantitative (assessment of 2
new lesions) and unidirectional because it defines only pro-
gression and not response. As a continuous quantitative as-
sessment, the aBSI can inherently account for the increase in
the total tumor burden by quantitating the increase both of ex-
isting lesions and of new lesions. Subsequent analyses are on-
going to define and validate the aBSI increase as a progres-
sionendpointbiomarkerfordeterminingresponseandbenefit
to systemic therapies in men with bone mCRPC.
In addition, our study demonstrated stratification of OS
and other clinical end points based on the aBSI quartiles. In
the OS analysis, using patients in Q4 as a reference, the risk of
death increased with decreasing quartile. As summarized in
Table 3, patients in Q1, Q2, and Q3 had a 65%, 56%, and 40%
reduction in risk of dying, respectively, compared with

fied the risk of prostate cancer–specific survival, time to symp-
tomatic progression, and time to opiate use for cancer pain.
The aBSI quartiles presented herein—Q1 (0.00-0.27), Q2 (0.28-
1.07), Q3 (1.08-3.96), and Q4 (3.97-32.60)—can be evaluated
prospectively as a baseline prognostic factor to assess re-
sponse to novel therapies. These data support the clinical util-
ity of the aBSI given its association with clinically relevant out-
comes that are critically important in patient care.
Limitations and Strengths
Our study had some limitations. Forty-one percent (506 of
1245) of bone scans were not evaluable because of image qual-
ity issues, including missing anterior or posterior images, lack
of DICOM format, and poor image quality. This confirms the
lack of due diligence in obtaining imaging data in standard-
quality format for standardized analysis like that of the aBSI.
However, baseline characteristics and the follow-up OS data
of the aBSI and total trial populations were determined to be
similar, suggesting that the missing bone scans did not result
in any systematic bias. While the phase 3 trial did not demon-
strate a survival benefit of therapy,15 permitting both treat-
ment arms to be combined for this biomarker analysis,

 further prospective studies of the clinical utility in commu-
nity settings are needed, with close attention to standard
DICOM format digital bone scans for software interpretation
and scoring.
AninherentlimitationoftheaBSIisthenatureofbonescan-
ning,whichreflectstheincreaseintheosteoblasticactivity,and
thus is an indirect tracer of bone tumor burden. In response to
an effective treatment, the bone scan can show a temporary in-
creaseintraceractivity,reflectingthehealingprocessduringthe
first 8 to 12 weeks. This temporary increase in activity, com-
monly referred to as the flare phenomenon, is not distinguish-
able from the early disease progression. In recognition of the
limitations of bone scintigraphy, PCWG2-3 advocated shifting
the focus of clinical trials from response assessments to time
toradiographicprogression.OngoingworkwilldeveloptheaBSI
bidirectional response and progression criteria similar to
PCWG2-3 that define the need for metrics to define clinically
relevant improvements or increases in the aBSI that are most
associated with clinical outcomes, and which account for the
need for confirmatory scans demonstrating further progres-
sion from the initial postbaseline scan if new lesions develop
over time. Confirmatory aBSI metrics should help to better dif-
ferentiate the aBSI flare phenomenon from true aBSI progres-
sion. Finally, the automated platform fails in the setting of very
high tumor burden, as in 18 patients herein who had super-
scans. In such bone scans, the neural network of the aBSI plat-
formstrugglestofindareferencevalueforthenormalbonethat
allows segmenting of the tumor. Assigning these scans a high
aBSI threshold value, rather than excluding them, may be rea-
sonable given the poor outcomes in patients with superscans.
Our study had multiple strengths that suggest clinical ap-
plications and utility. First, this is the largest study to date to
evaluate the aBSI and the only prospective one based, to our
knowledge, on a predefined statistical plan. The study was suf-
ficiently powered to demonstrate an independent prognostic
association with OS after adjustment for standard clinical
prognostic factors. However, further work is needed in com-
munitysettingsinvestigatingtheeffectivenessandclinicalutil-
ity of the aBSI assessment in changing patient management,
identifying patients appropriate for novel or bone-targeting
therapies, and determining patient response to therapy. Sec-
ond, we developed defined aBSI quartiles that may be pro-
spectively used as eligibility criteria for clinical trials of sys-
temic therapies and bone-targeted outcomes based on the risk
of death and skeletal-related events. Clinical trials may stratify
based on aBSI values at baseline and other clinical factors
or may select patients more likely to benefit from bone-
targeted approaches based on the aBSI. Third, we provide an
informed and accurate quantitative imaging report from the
bone scan, which may be monitored over time. Efforts are on-
going to perform the prospectively defined analysis of
on-treatment change in the aBSI as a determinant of OS.
Conclusions
This study offers strong evidence that the aBSI provides prog-
nostic information for OS, prostate cancer–specific survival,
and time to symptomatic progression to patients and health
care providers. The aBSI is only moderately or weakly associ-
ated with standard clinical biomarkers, such as tumor pain and
LDH and PSA values, and thus has independent clinical value
for determining prognosis and is strongly associated with bone
metastatic burden and risk of future bone metastases. Incor-
porating the aBSI into clinical practice to supplement nuclear
medicine reports may permit a more objective analysis of bone
scan changes over time and their clinical relevance to patient
care. Finally, this study could be a part of an evidentiary pro-
cess qualifying the aBSI as an imaging biomarker in the con-
text of mCRPC studies.

Reliably Quantifying Bone Metastases
in Prostate Cancer—Are We Finally There?
Fred Saad, MD, FRCS
Although bone is the most common site of distant metasta-
ses in prostate cancer,1 reliably evaluating the extent of meta-
static burden is a challenge and has been a limiting factor for
clinical decision making as well as in clinical trials. Although
limited in terms of specific-
ity and sensitivity, bone scan
remains the most often used
imaging modality for diagnosing and following bone metas-
tases in prostate cancer. One of the objectives of the Prostate
CancerWorkingGroup(PCWG)wastoestablishcriteriaforpro-
gression in the bone,1 which could help level the playing field
among clinical trials when establishing radiographic progres-
sion-free survival (PFS). The PCWG criteria have aided in mak-
ing clinical trial results comparable with each other. How-
ever, the difficulty in establishing burden of metastases at
baseline and evaluating response and progression with the
same level of precision as for visceral and measurable disease
has slowed down the speed at which clinical trials are able to
report conclusive results. This difficulty has likely delayed the
establishment of new therapeutic options and may have pre-
vented some potentially active agents being brought to mar-
ket and available to patients.
The limitation of precisely establishing response and PFS
explains why most regulatory agencies want to see improve-
ments in overall survival before approving new therapeutic
agents for advanced prostate cancer. Adequately estimating
the burden of bone metastases when patients are seen in the
clinic or enrolled in clinical trials is also a challenge. At pres-
ent, counting the number of lesions and describing the sites
remains the standard. This leads to relatively crude esti-
mates of metastatic burden. More reliable and reproducible
methods of evaluating bone metastases are needed. Bone Scan
Index (BSI) has been described as one possible method of
more reliably quantifying bone metastases.2,3 The study by
Armstrong et al4 in this issue of JAMA Oncology prospectively
validates the potential utility of an automated BSI (aBSI) sys-
tem to evaluate the burden of bone metastases seen on bone
scan and establish its prognostic value. Armstrong et al4 found
