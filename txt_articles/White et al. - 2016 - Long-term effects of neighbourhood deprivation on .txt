SUMMARY
Background—While numerous studies have shown associations between neighborhood quality 
and chronic disease outcomes, such correlations are potentially confounded by selection of 
different types of people into different neighborhood environments. We sought to identify the 
causal effects of neighborhood deprivation on type 2 diabetes risk, by comparing refugees to 
Sweden who were actively dispersed by government policy to low-, moderate-, or high-deprivation 
neighborhoods.
Methods—We studied national register data on N=61,386 refugees who arrived in Sweden at age 
25–50 during 1987–1991, a period of quasi-random dispersal of refugees to Swedish 
neighborhoods varying in poverty, unemployment levels, schooling, and social welfare 
participation. Individuals in our sample were assigned to one of 4,833 neighborhoods, categorized 
as high-deprivation” (≥1 SD above the mean), “moderate deprivation” (within 1 SD of the mean), 
or “low-deprivation” (≥1 SD below the mean). The primary outcome was diagnosis with type 2 
diabetes measured through 2010. We used multivariate logistic and linear regressions to assess the 
effects of neighborhood deprivation on diabetes risk, controlling for potential confounders

 affecting neighborhood assignment and assessing effects of cumulative exposure to different 
neighborhood conditions.
Findings—Being assigned to an area deemed high-deprivation versus low-deprivation was 
associated with an increased risk of diabetes among refugees (OR 1·22, 95% CI: 1·07, 1·38; 
p=0·001). In analyses that included fixed effects for assigned municipality, the increased diabetes 
risk was estimated to be 0·85 percentage points (−0·030, 1·728; p=0·058). Neighborhood effects 
grew over time, such that 5 years of additional exposure to high-deprivation versus low-
deprivation neighborhoods was associated with a 9% increase in diabetes risk.
Interpretation—This study leverages a natural experiment to show that neighborhood 
deprivation increased the risk of diabetes among refugees to Sweden. This finding has heightened 
significance in the context of the current refugee crisis in Europe.

INTRODUCTION
Studies have documented that adverse neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics are 
associated with worse chronic disease outcomes.3 Of note, several studies have shown a 
strong association between disadvantaged neighborhood environment and the incidence of 
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D).4–7 Hypothesized mediating pathways include 
reduced employment and income opportunities resulting in the purchase of cheaper 
unhealthy food, reduced psychosocial resources resulting in higher chronic stress, and 
poorer food availability and walkability.8 Unfortunately, most existing studies on 
neighborhoods and health have been correlational and unable to account for several 
methodological challenges: selection bias, in that less healthy individuals may move to more 
disadvantaged neighborhoods; confounding by unobserved individual factors such as family 
socioeconomic status; and an inability to disentangle individual- and area-level factors.9–11 
The only randomized trial was the Moving to Opportunity study, which found that 
individuals randomized to receive a housing voucher in five U.S. cities had small but 
significant improvements in obesity and T2D.1 Moving to Opportunity has been criticized 
on methodological grounds, such as residual selection bias and limited generalizability.12, 13
In this study, we overcome persistent challenges in the neighborhood effects literature by 
means of a novel quasi-experiment. We take advantage of a policy in Sweden during 1985–
1994 that assigned incoming refugees in a quasi-random fashion to neighborhoods 
throughout the country. The policy’s goal was to ease labor market conditions in heavily 
settled areas and promote better integration of refugees. The dispersal policy was most 
strictly applied from 1987 through 1991,14 creating a unique natural experiment that enables 
us to examine how neighborhood environment affects the onset of T2D. As a result of the 
dispersal policy, refugees were spread more evenly across the country during this period 
(Figure 1). Several studies have examined the impact of European refugee dispersal policies 
on labor markets, crime, and educational outcomes.14–16 Only one has examined health, 
finding that neighborhood income inequality was not associated with risk of

 hospitalization.2 A significant contribution of the present study is the follow-up period of 
more than 20 years, longer than existing experimental or quasi-experimental studies of 
neighborhoods and health.
Neighborhood effects are particularly important for vulnerable populations such as 
immigrants. Studies have consistently shown that immigrants to Sweden, as elsewhere, have 
an elevated risk of diabetes and mortality compared to the native population and higher 
incident diabetes following migration from a lower-income country.6, 17, 18 Moreover, 
incidence may be higher among refugees than among immigrants more generally.19 In recent 
years, the European Union has experienced the largest inflow of immigrants and refugees 
since the end of the Second World War. The current wave of immigration includes a majority 
of individuals from the Middle East and North Africa, where T2D prevalence is the highest 
of any region worldwide: 11% among adults aged 20–79 in 2013.20 While policymakers 
have focused on the economic, political, and cultural implications of absorbing a large 
number of immigrants, the mass migration also has ramifications for the health and welfare 
of the newly settled immigrants. This study therefore has the potential to provide critical 
insights into the design of community-level interventions to influence the long-term health 
of refugees in Europe, testing the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation affects the 
development of T2D.
METHODS
Data sources
We drew on data from multiple national registers on the entire Swedish population, 
including immigrants (Table 1). We linked the data sets using personal identification 
numbers assigned to all permanent residents in Sweden. Individual-level socio-demographic 
characteristics and aggregated statistics representing the neighborhood-level variables, 
described below, were available in the Total Population Register. Health outcome data, 
including the date of each health encounter, were available in the inpatient register (1987–
2010), outpatient register (2001–2010), and prescription drug register (2005–2010). These 
data included roughly 11·8 million individuals and were more than 99% complete for all 
Swedish residents.
Sample selection
Our analytic sample consisted of immigrants who 1) obtained a Swedish residence permit 
during 1987–1991, 2) originated from a refugee-sending country, and 3) were age 25–50 at 
the time of entry into Sweden. In this manuscript, we refer to immigrants as any foreign-
born person and refugees as the subset of immigrants who were forced to flee from 
persecution, entitled to protections under international law. We excluded persons belonging 
to a household with an adult already residing in Sweden, since they were likely to have 
resettled with family members and, consequently, were not assigned to a residence by a 
placement officer. A total of 61,386 individuals met the selection criteria.

 Summary of Swedish dispersal policy
During 1985–1994, the Swedish Immigration Board assigned refugees arriving in Sweden to 
neighborhoods across the country. By 1989, 277 of 284 municipalities were participating in 
the program. All refugees, except those reuniting with family members living in Sweden or 
those having the financial resources to support themselves, were subjected to the dispersal 
policy. Our study focuses on the period 1987–1991 when the dispersal policy was strictly 
followed. From 1987–1991, about 90% of incoming refugees were assigned to an initial 
municipality according to official reports, indicating high participation in the placement 
program.14 During this time period, Sweden experienced a large influx of refugees (Figure 
2). The Middle East was the most common sending region for refugees in our sample (Table 
2), resembling immigrants entering during the current wave of immigration and making this 
study relevant to today’s refugee crisis.21
The Immigration Board assigned refugees to one of the refugee centers distributed 
nationwide, where individuals awaited a response on whether a residential permit had been 
approved. The typical duration spent in the refugee centers was 3 to 12 months.22 Once a 
refugee received a residential permit, placement officers assigned the person to an 
apartment. Placement officers did not have any direct interaction with refugees, meaning that 
any selection bias must be on the observed characteristics available to the officers in the 
application: refugees’ language, formal schooling, and family size.14 After refugees were 
placed in an initial residence, the Immigration Board offered Swedish language and training 
courses and social welfare support, lasting for about 18 months depending on municipality 
and year. There were no restrictions on mobility if refugees found a residence independently, 
and receipt of welfare was not conditional on remaining in the assigned residence. 
Therefore, our study design is akin to a randomized encouragement design in which 
participants are randomly encouraged to be exposed to a given neighborhood, and represents 
a lower bound on the health effects of neighborhood deprivation. In this study, our focus is 
on estimating the effect of initial quasi-random neighborhood placement. We therefore do 
not estimate the subsequent effects of relocation, as these are likely subject to selection bias.
From 1987–1991, a thriving housing market in Sweden made it difficult for incoming 
refugees to find an apartment in a desirable area.14 Consequently, placement officers based 
their assignment even more strictly on housing availability. Refugees had limited ability to 
influence their initial place of residence during this period. In this study, we therefore 
assume that refugee placement during this narrower time frame of 1987–1991 was 
essentially random, conditional on observed factors available to placement officers, all of 
which are available in Swedish register data. This is a strategy employed in and supported by 
prior research.14, 15, 23 In essence, there were no unobserved factors that could have 
influenced neighborhood placement, overcoming the challenge of confounding present in 
the existing literature on neighborhood effects.
Study variables
Health outcome: type 2 diabetes—The primary outcome measure was diagnosis with 
T2D during 2002–2010, the years in which outcome data were available. Cases were 
identified in the inpatient and outpatient registers from 2002–2010 according to ICD-10

 codes E11–E14 and in the prescription drug register from 2005–2010 according to 
individuals who were prescribed or filled a prescription of insulin, insulin analogs, or oral 
antidiabetic agents (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes A10B and A10X). The 
prescription drug register alone has been shown to capture 90% of all diabetic cases in 
Sweden.24, 25 Validation studies have also found Sweden’s clinical registers to have broad 
coverage and high quality.26
We excluded individuals diagnosed with other types of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes 
(ICD-10 codes E8–E10). To capture only incident disease, we used inpatient register data 
dating back to 1987 to exclude individuals who were diagnosed with any form of diabetes 
(ICD-10 codes E8–E14) within five years of arrival in Sweden, as these individuals likely 
had pre-existing clinical or pre-clinical disease. For example, if a refugee arrived in 1987, he 
or she would not be considered an incident case if diagnosed with diabetes during 1987–
1992.
Neighborhood deprivation measures—We defined neighborhoods on the basis of 
small-area market statistics (SAMS) that use boundaries determined by homogeneous 
building types (e.g., high-rise buildings). SAMS have been a common neighborhood 
definition in prior studies in Sweden.27, 28 The average population in each SAMS was about 
2,000 residents in Stockholm and 1,000 residents elsewhere in Sweden.15 After excluding 
areas with fewer than 50 residents because of unstable statistical estimates, our analysis 
included individuals who were initially assigned to 4,833 different SAMS.
We created a summary measure to characterize neighborhood deprivation in 1987, following 
the approach adopted by prior Swedish studies.6, 29 Specifically, we used a principal 
components analysis that included four variables for all residents aged 25–64 in each SAMS, 
each measured in percentages in the year of initial placement: low education status (<10 
years of formal schooling), low income (<50% of individual median income from all 
sources), unemployment (not employed, excluding full-time students, military, and retirees), 
and social welfare assistance. We calculated a Z-score for each SAMS, weighted by the 
coefficients on the eigenvectors. We then classified neighborhoods into three categories, 
established in prior studies: low (≥1 standard deviation (SD) below the mean), moderate 
(within 1 SD of the mean), and high (≥1 SD above the mean).29 We also considered a 
second measure that trichotomizes the component score into tertiles to achieve an equal 
number of individuals from the study population in each category, resulting in similar 
findings (results available upon request).
Covariates—To improve the validity and precision of our estimates, our analyses adjusted 
for several individual characteristics measured in the year of initial placement. These 
included: 5-year age categories (e.g., 25–29, 30–34), sex, educational attainment (≤9 years, 
10–12 years, >12 years), marital status (married/cohabitating versus not), region of initial 
placement (large cities in southern Sweden, other areas in southern Sweden, northern 
Sweden), family size (0, 1, 2, 3, ≥4 children), and region of origin (Iran, Middle East/North 
Africa, other Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America). We also included indicator 
variables for year of arrival to adjust for secular trends.

 Statistical analyses
We assumed that initial neighborhood assignment within a municipality was quasi-random, 
conditional on all observed factors available to placement officers: refugees’ language, 
formal schooling, and family size. This assumption is not directly testable, although studies 
have found increased dispersal of refugees during the policy period, no evidence of sorting 
by ethnic group, and covariate balance by neighborhood type.14, 15, 23 We also investigated 
the balance of covariates by neighborhood deprivation level as a guide to the validity of this 
assumption.
We next conducted unadjusted logistic regressions to determine the association of 
neighborhood deprivation with diabetes risk. We then adjusted for individual-level baseline 
characteristics described in the Covariates section above, including the factors that may have 
affected the initial placement assignment by officials.
We then conducted linear probability models (ordinary least squares, OLS) to more precisely 
estimate the causal effect of neighborhood deprivation on diabetes risk. To do so, we 
included fixed effects (i.e., indicator variables) for assigned municipality, which adjusted for 
all time-invariant factors at the municipality level. Thus, we identified the neighborhood 
effects using socioeconomic variation across neighborhoods within a municipality. In other 
words, we considered the difference in outcomes for refugees placed in a given municipality 
who were assigned to a high-deprivation neighborhood as opposed to a low-deprivation 
neighborhood. We chose a fixed effects approach over a multilevel modeling approach, 
because we are substantively interested in identifying a causal effect, and multilevel models 
do not perform as well as fixed effects models in controlling for omitted variables bias.30
Finally, to analyze how the effects of exposure to neighborhood deprivation accumulate over 
time, we estimated the covariate-adjusted OLS models for outcomes reported in each year 
from 2002–2010.
In order to account for correlated outcomes among individuals assigned to the same 
municipality, robust standard errors in all models were clustered by municipality (N = 288).
The analyses used an intent-to-treat approach that included all refugees who arrived in 
Sweden from 1987–1991. Individuals who emigrated from Sweden prior to follow-up were 
classified as non-cases. We obtain similar results when we excluded emigrants from our 
analysis (results available upon request).

 RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
Table 2 displays the characteristics of the sample at the time of arrival. A large fraction of 
refugees in the sample were initially assigned to deprived neighborhoods: 45% to a 
moderate-deprivation area and 47% to a high-deprivation area. This reflects that housing was 
most readily available in more deprived areas during the arrival period. About two-thirds of 
the sample was under age 35. About three-quarters were married, and 83% had children. 
Most were settled in the three largest cities. The refugees arrived from a diverse set of 
geographic regions, with almost half from Iran and the Middle East or North Africa.
The last three columns of Table 2 show the balance of baseline characteristics by 
neighborhood deprivation level. The placement officers only had information about 
refugees’ language, formal schooling, and family size, so we would expect these variables 
might vary by deprivation level, and we are able to adjust for these observed characteristics 
in our analyses. Most baseline characteristics do not vary greatly by neighborhood 
deprivation level. This supports our assumption that initial neighborhood assignment within 
a municipality is quasi-random conditional on observed variables. Any other imbalance in 
unobserved factors should be due to random chance, as in a randomized study.
The cumulative prevalence of T2D at follow-up is 7·4% in our sample. The last row of Table 
2 demonstrates a deprivation-diabetes gradient, with cumulative prevalence of diabetes 
increasing by deprivation level. By comparison, overall diabetes prevalence in Sweden is 
estimated at 4–6%.31, 32
Association between neighborhood deprivation and diabetes risk
In order to further analyze the association between T2D prevalence and neighborhood 
deprivation, we estimate two sets of logistic regression models (Figure 3). In unadjusted 
models (top panel), being assigned to a moderate-deprivation or high-deprivation SAMS 
increased the odds of T2D diagnosis by 25% or 39%, relative to a low-deprivation SAMS. In 
adjusted models controlling for the covariates listed in Table 2 (bottom panel), there remains 
an increase, though somewhat attenuated: 15% for moderate-deprivation and 22% for high-
deprivation areas.
Neighborhood effects on diabetes risk
In the second half of the analysis, we estimated linear probability models with fixed effects 
for initial municipality (Table 3). As described above, the municipality fixed effects 
accounted for any sorting that occurred in which refugees were assigned to different 
municipal refugee centers while awaiting residential permits. Diabetes risk increased for 
refugees initially assigned to a high-deprivation vs. low-deprivation area by 0·8–1·7 
percentage points, depending on adjustment for covariates. This translates to a 15–30% 
increase in diabetes risk. Coefficients for moderate deprivation were not statistically 
significant in these models, although they did suggest higher diabetes risk than in low-
deprivation areas. The coefficients were less precisely estimated because of added 
parameters for the 288 municipality fixed effects.

 Cumulative effects
Diabetes risk accumulated over time, rather than occurring immediately after arrival (Figure 
4). Five years of additional exposure to high-deprivation versus low-deprivation 
neighborhoods was associated with a 9% increase in diabetes risk.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we tracked the effects of neighborhood deprivation on refugees’ diabetes risk 
two decades after arrival in Sweden, using comprehensive national register data. The results 
indicate that refugees initially assigned to highly deprived neighborhoods experienced an 
increased risk of T2D of 1·7 percentage points. Covariate adjustment attenuated the 
magnitude of the association to 0·8 percentage points. This represents a relative increase of 
15–30%. The accumulation of this effect over time is consistent with hypothesized 
mediating pathways, such as chronic stress, employment and income opportunities, and food 
environment, all of which may take years to influence health. Moreover, the results suggest a 
gradient, such that high-deprivation areas have worse outcomes than moderate-deprivation 
areas. In the absence of the policy, greater numbers of refugees would have continued to 
settle in areas with higher proportions of immigrants, which have higher deprivation on 
average. Therefore, this policy likely reduced the cumulative prevalence of diabetes among 
refugees in this sample.
A strength of our study design is that we leverage a natural policy experiment. Our estimates 
are not subject to selection bias and unobserved confounding that have plagued the 
neighborhood effects literature. One prior study using traditional correlational methods 
estimated the association of neighborhoods with diabetes risk among the full population in 
Sweden, with odds ratios of 1·28 (95% CI: 1·23,1·35) and 1·67 (95% CI: 1·57,1·77) for 
moderate- and high-deprivation areas, respectively.6 The corresponding estimates in our 
study were 1·15 (95% CI: 1·01,1·31) and 1·22 (1·07,1·38). Although the study populations 
differ, this comparison highlights the importance of gathering additional experimental and 
quasi-experimental evidence on neighborhood effects to reduce potential bias.
Our estimates are likely to be a lower bound on the true effects of neighborhoods on diabetes 
risk. The dispersal policy did not restrict mobility away from initial neighborhood 
assignment. If refugees moved to wealthier areas, it could undo some or all of the negative 
effects of being assigned to a deprived neighborhood. In this respect, the dispersal policy is 
analogous to a randomized encouragement design in which participants are randomly 
encouraged or not encouraged to be exposed to a deprived neighborhood, a situation in 
which nonadherence can play a role.33 In our study, about half of participants left their 
assigned municipality after 10 years. This likely weakened the estimated effect size. Yet, 
even in the presence of high relocation rates, our study nevertheless demonstrated a long-
term impact on refugee health. Possible mechanisms include poor employment opportunities 
in the initial assigned area that altered housing and income trajectories. In our sample, initial 
neighborhood deprivation was highly correlated with the deprivation of neighborhood 
residence after 5, 10, and 15 years (Supp. Table S2), suggesting that initial assignment had 
long-term consequences on residential decisions and may be a mediating pathway through 
which initial neighborhood placement affected diabetes risk.

 This study has several limitations. First, register data do not indicate which immigrants were 
refugees that would have been subject to this policy. Instead, we followed prior research in 
which the sample was identified based on the year and region of migration to Sweden.2, 14 
Government statistics show that most immigrants to Sweden during the study period were 
refugees (46.5%) or those moving to rejoin family members (i.e., “tied movers”) (47.7%), 
compared to labor immigrants (0.6%), guest students (2.4%), or adopted children (2.7%). 
Adopted children and many students would not meet our age inclusion criterion, and we 
exclude tied movers. Consequently, a large majority of our sample consisted of refugees, and 
misclassification is likely to be limited. Second, Sweden provided relatively comprehensive 
social welfare assistance to refugees. It is possible that neighborhoods exert a stronger effect 
in settings where social support is more limited. It is striking that even in a context renowned 
for its strong public safety net, we still observed large neighborhood effects. As a result, 
however, our analyses may not generalize to other waves of immigrants or to contexts 
beyond Sweden. Our estimates may also not generalize to areas with fewer than 50 
residents, as these were excluded from our sample due to unstable estimates. In addition, we 
do not have data on the length of time that refugees spent in refugee centers before being 
assigned housing by a placement officer; it is possible that those with longer wait times were 
more likely to find housing independently, which could bias the results. As mentioned 
previously, however, compliance with the policy was above 90%. Further, we do not adjust 
for neighborhood-level differences in access to care, the presence of which would bias our 
estimates toward the null if health care utilization is worse in more deprived neighborhoods. 
However, this bias is likely negligible, as studies have found that access to care was no 
worse for immigrants from refugee-sending countries during the study period.34 Finally, we 
rely only on the inpatient register to exclude pre-existing cases of T2D during the first years 
after immigration, as the outpatient register was not established until 2001; this may miss 
less severe cases. As long as these cases are randomly distributed across neighborhoods, as 
we would expect, this will not bias our estimates.
Our study has direct relevance to the ongoing wave of immigration to Europe. Due to the 
historically high numbers of incoming refugees combined with already high unemployment 
rates, the new entrants are encountering less hospitable environments. Our findings indicate 
that decisions that affect the settlement and integration of immigrants can have long-term 
consequences for the health of the new arrivals. Refugees are among the most vulnerable 
populations in any society, and as such deserve special attention from governments in 
crafting policies that protect and promote their health. Further investigation of the pathways 
through which neighborhoods affect the risk of diabetes and other diseases may shed light 
on how best to buffer immigrants against the consequences of neighborhood deprivation. 
Future studies should also consider the impacts of these factors on other outcomes, such as 
mental health, which may be adversely affected by dispersal policies of this nature.

 RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
We searched the PubMed database for articles about neighborhood characteristics and 
type 2 diabetes. Our search terms included “diabetes” and “neighborhoods” or 
“neighbourhoods.” We restricted the search to articles published in English prior to 
November 31, 2015. We identified more than a dozen observational studies that 
investigated the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the prevalence or 
incidence of type 2 diabetes. Most found an association between increased diabetes risk 
and various measures of neighborhood deprivation. However, we found only one 
randomized trial, the Moving to Opportunity experiment.1 It found that women whose 
family received a voucher to relocate to a low-poverty neighborhood had a 4-percentage-
point reduction in having glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5% at follow-up 10–15 years later. We 
did not find any quasi-experimental evidence on the topic. In our search of the broader 
literature on neighborhood health effects, we found no other randomized trials and one 
quasi-experimental study, which found no relationship between neighborhood-level 
income inequality and hospitalization risk.2
Added value of this study
In this study, we took advantage of a unique quasi-experiment to assess the causal 
relationship between neighborhood deprivation and type 2 diabetes risk. To our 
knowledge, it is the first quasi-experiment involving neighborhood deprivation and any 
health outcome, building on existing correlational and experimental evidence. Our 
follow-up period of more than 20 years is longer than Moving to Opportunity and the 
majority of existing observational studies of neighborhoods and type 2 diabetes. Our 
results suggest that exposure to neighborhood deprivation increased diabetes risk in our 
sample.
Implications of all the available evidence
In combination with the existing evidence, our study indicates that the association 
between neighborhood deprivation and type 2 diabetes risk is not driven solely by 
selection of families into neighborhoods or other confounding. Neighborhood 
environments exert a causal influence on diabetes risk, which accumulates over time. 
Policy efforts to reduce area-level socioeconomic disparities may contribute to lowering 
the risk of type 2 diabetes. The focus of our study is the effects of neighborhoods on 
refugees who arrived in Sweden 25–30 years ago. While policymakers should be cautious 
about generalizability, these findings nevertheless have critical implications for the 
unprecedented current wave of migrants to Europe.
