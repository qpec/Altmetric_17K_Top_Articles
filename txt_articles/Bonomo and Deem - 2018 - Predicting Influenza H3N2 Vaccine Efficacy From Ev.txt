We predict vaccine efficacy with a measure of antigenic dis-
tance between influenza A(H3N2) and vaccine viruses based 
on amino acid substitutions in the dominant epitope. In 2016–
2017, our model predicts 19% efficacy compared with 20% 
observed. This tool assists candidate vaccine selection by pre-
dicting human protection against circulating strains.

Seasonal influenza constitutes a significant disease burden world-
wide, with 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and an estimated 
annual death toll of 290 000 to 650 000; however, vaccination can 
provide protection [1]. The vaccine component against influenza 
A(H3N2) is especially important, because increased morbidity 
and mortality rates are associated with this most commonly 
predominant subtype [2]. Influenza type A viruses are primarily 
recognized by the immune system via 2 proteins on their sur-
face, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase [3]. These viruses 
constantly evolve to evade human antibodies, most notably by 
introducing amino acid substitutions into the HA-binding sites, 
designated epitopes A through E in A(H3N2) (Supplementary 
Figure 1). Some epitopes seem to play a more dominant role 
during infection than others, and the epitope under the greatest 
immune pressure in a given season will have the highest per-
centage of amino acid substitutions, computed by dividing the 
number of substitutions by the total number of amino acids in 
that epitope [4]. Increased antigenic distance between the vac-
cine and infecting virus leads to decreased vaccine efficacy. 
Owing to virus evolution, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) recommends the composition of the seasonal influenza 
vaccine twice a year based on the dominant influenza strains 
from the previous northern or southern hemisphere season [5]. 
Several antigenically similar candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) 
and associated reassortants are made available. Generally, the 
reassorted viruses used in manufacturing the vaccine are anti-
genically identical to their CVV prototypes in the HA region 
[6]. For the 2016–2017 northern hemisphere influenza season, 
WHO recommended A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like 
CVVs [5]. However, mean vaccine efficacy against A(H3N2) 
influenza for adults aged 18–64 years was only 20% (standard 
error [SE], 8%) [2] (Supplementary Methods). Rather than an 
increased antigenic distance due to virus evolution, the 2016–
2017 vaccine may have diverged from circulating viruses due 
to substitutions acquired during isolation of the CVV strains in 
eggs [7]. Passaging-related adaptations have posed an issue for 
A(H3N2) CVVs in particular [8, 9] (Supplementary Table 1).
We have previously derived a statistical mechanics model that 
captures the dynamics of human antibody-mediated response 
to viral infection following vaccination [10]. In a recent appli-
cation of our theory, we used the evolution of the dominant HA 
epitope to predict vaccine efficacy, the ability of the vaccine to 
reduce the disease attack rate [4]. Here we generalize the model 
to A(H3N2) data both from the 1971–1972 to 2015–2016 influ-
enza seasons and from highly consistent, laboratory-confirmed 
studies over the past decade. In addition, we expand the pre-
diction to encompass mean efficacy against an abundance of 
diverse A(H3N2) strains for a given season. We apply this novel 
approach to quantify antigenic distance and expected efficacy of 
the egg-adapted CVVs against all strains circulating during the 
2016–2017 and early 2017–2018 seasons.
METHODS
The epitope-based dependence of vaccine efficacy in our model 
comes from a measure of antigenic distance termed pepitope, 
where

In ferret models, the typical measure of antigenic distance d1 is 
the log2 difference between vaccine antiserum titer against itself 
and the vaccine antiserum titer against a strain representative 
of the dominant circulating viruses [11]. A second measure d2 
is the square-root ratio of the product of the homologous titers 
to the product of the heterologous titers [12]. We perform lin-
ear regression with vaccine efficacy data reported by WHO 
collaborating centers to compare the predictive power of pepitope 
with these ferret-based distances. We then use our model to 
evaluate the primary protein structure of egg-adapted A/Hong

Kong/4801/2014 CVV in the context of the 2016–2017 season 
[5] and to predict efficacy of the egg-adapted CVV for the newly 
recommended A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 (H3N2)-
like vaccine [13]. Finally, we calculate the mean efficacy of the 
CVVs against 6610 circulating A(H3N2) strains collected from 
September 2016 to November 2017, a unique capability of our 
pepitope measure of antigenic distance in comparison to other 
clinical studies.
RESULTS
Our use of pepitope to correlate antigenic distance with vaccine 
efficacy yields a coefficient of determination r2 = 0.77 on both 
data since 1971 and data over just the past 10 years (Figure 1). 
Conventional ferret d1 has r2 = 0.42 on data since 1971 and 
has dropped to r2 = 0.23 on data over the past 10 years. The 
extracted equation to predict vaccine efficacy VE is

where the SE is 0.254 on the slope and 0.032 on the y-intercept 
(Supplementary Methods).
We calculate pepitope = 0.095 between the egg-adapted A/Hong 
Kong CVV and A/Colorado/15/2014, a representative clade 
3C.2a strain [7], and find that the dominant epitope is B, with 
amino acid substitutions T160K and L194P. The reassorted 
CVVs contain some additional substitutions (Supplementary 
Figure 2), but because these substitutions are outside the domin-
ant epitope, we focus on the nonreassorted CVV for our analysis. 
Using Equation 2, we predict the mean vaccine efficacy against 
this A/Colorado strain to be 23% (SE, 4%) (Supplementary 
Table 2). The hemagglutination inhibition titers from postinfec-
tion ferret antisera reported for the 2016–2017 season [14] and 
our linear regressions of d1 and d2 predict mean (SE) vaccine 
efficacy to be 27% (5%) and 28% (4%), respectively. Analysis of 
the reference A/Hong Kong strain, which was the clinical spec-
imen collected from humans and expected to dominate in the 
population, reveals that this strain did not exhibit the epitope B 
substitutions. We predict it would have had a high mean (SE) 
efficacy against A/Colorado, 47% (3%).
When comparing the CVVs to all circulating strains during 
the 2016–2017 and early 2017–2018 seasons, we considered 
both pepitope (Equation 1) and the Hamming distance, which is 
the number of differing amino acids between each pair of strains 
in HA subunit 1 divided by the total 328 amino acids of the sub-
unit. Whereas the Hamming distance between the reference A/
Hong Kong specimen and the consensus sequence of the cir-
culating strains is 0.006, that of the egg-adapted CVVs is 0.015 
(Supplementary Figure 3). For the egg-adapted A/Hong Kong 
CVV, the mean pepitope is 0.111 owing to substitutions in dom-
inant epitope B, with a predicted mean vaccine efficacy of 19% 
(SE, 4%). The reference A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 
specimen has a Hamming distance of 0.003 to the consensus 
strain, smaller than the reference A/Hong Kong specimen has, 
and that of its egg-adapted CVV is 0.012. We calculate that the 
egg-passaged A/Singapore CVV has a mean pepitope of 0.118, 
leading to a predicted mean vaccine efficacy of 18% (4%).

logical studies [11, 12], and the corresponding vaccine efficacy values for each influenza season. Linear regression of data from each measure of antigenic distance is shown 
for the past 45 years (solid lines) and for laboratory-confirmed studies in the past 10 years (dotted lines). The coefficients of determination (r2) are listed in the legend. Data for 
the 2016–2017 season are plotted separately (diamond points). The strong and consistent r2 between pepitope and vaccine efficacy indicates that this model accurately predicts 
the data. We determined a mean efficacy of 19% (standard error, 4%) for the 2016–2017 egg-adapted A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine, whereas 20% (8%) was observed [2].

DISCUSSION
We quantify influenza virus evolution and predict the abil-
ity of the CVV to reduce the disease attack rate using our 
pepitope measure of antigenic distance. Although other factors 
influence real-world vaccine efficacy in humans, pepitope has 
accounted for much of the variance in CVV efficacy over the 
past 10 and 45 years (r2 = 0.77). The low vaccine performance 
against A(H3N2) during 2016–2017 seems to have been 
caused by the T160K and L194P substitutions that occurred 
in the dominant epitope B during egg isolation of the A/
Hong Kong CVV. Indeed, human antiserum studies showed 
that individuals who had received the Flublok recombinant 
influenza vaccine (containing T160 and L194) that had been 
passaged in insect cells produced more effective antisera than 
did those who had received the inactivated influenza vaccines 
Fluzone or Flucelvax (containing K160 and P194) [7], which 
were both made from CVVs initially isolated in eggs [9]. 
Arguably, HA stability did not account for the larger response 
induced by Flublok, because all 3 vaccines induced a simi-
lar antiserum response when challenged by K160-containing 
viruses [7].
It is critical to choose a vaccine strain with the minimal anti-
genic distance from all circulating A(H3N2) strains. While the 
reference A/Singapore specimen minimizes the Hamming dis-
tance, the reference A/Hong Kong specimen minimizes pepitope 
(Supplementary Figure 3). WHO changed the recommended 
CVVs for the southern hemisphere because the egg-passaged 
A/Singapore CVV contains an N121K substitution that matches 
the majority of recent viruses, and ferret antisera were more suc-
cessfully raised [13]. However, the egg-passaged A/Singapore 
CVV has 2 substitutions in residue B (T160K and L194P) that 
do not match the majority of circulating strains. We predict 
that this A/Singapore CVV will have comparable efficacy to the 
egg-passaged A/Hong Kong CVVs in humans.
The pepitope of a pair of strains can be calculated nearly instan-
taneously or averaged for 1 strain against 6000 in seconds. By 
contrast, ferret models are restricted to a few analysis pairs, 
antisera production takes 3–5 weeks, and there is added diffi-
culty owing to strict biocontainment measures [9]. Moreover, 
pepitope theory suggests which sequence discrepancies are con-
tributing most to a lowered vaccine efficacy. We currently do 
not explicitly consider N-linked glycosylation, though pepitope 
implicitly incorporates this, given that discrepancies in gly-
cosylation between 2 strains are generally due to amino acid 
substitutions, for example, T160K caused an observed lack of 
glycosylation site in the A/Hong Kong CVV compared with cir-
culating 3C.2a strains [7]. Our model can rapidly narrow down 
clinical specimens representative of viruses that will dominate 
the upcoming flu season. It can then be used in cooperation 
with ferret models to confirm that the CVVs and their associ-
ated reassortants have not acquired critical antigenic changes 
before the vaccine is manufactured and administered to the 
human population worldwide.
