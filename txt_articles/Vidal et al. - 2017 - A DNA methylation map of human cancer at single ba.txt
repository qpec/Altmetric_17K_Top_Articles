Although single base-pair resolution DNA methylation landscapes for embryonic and different somatic cell types provided
important insights into epigenetic dynamics and cell-type specificity, such comprehensive profiling is incomplete across human
cancer types. This prompted us to perform genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 22 samples derived from normal tissues and
associated neoplasms, including primary tumors and cancer cell lines. Unlike their invariant normal counterparts, cancer samples
exhibited highly variable CpG methylation levels in a large proportion of the genome, involving progressive changes during tumor
evolution. The whole-genome sequencing results from selected samples were replicated in a large cohort of 1112 primary tumors
of various cancer types using genome-scale DNA methylation analysis. Specifically, we determined DNA hypermethylation of
promoters and enhancers regulating tumor-suppressor genes, with potential cancer-driving effects. DNA hypermethylation events
showed evidence of positive selection, mutual exclusivity and tissue specificity, suggesting their active participation in neoplastic
transformation. Our data highlight the extensive changes in DNA methylation that occur in cancer onset, progression and
dissemination.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, genetic research has moved on from the use
of targeted approaches to the routine application of exome and
genome sequencing. The wealth of genomic data has yielded
profound insights into human variation and disease biology.
However, screening the genome at base-pair resolution has also
shown that the naked genetic code alone is not sufficient to
explain the complexity of life. Hence, focus has shifted toward
gene regulation and the mechanisms controlling gene expression
and post-transcriptional activity.1 DNA methylation participates in
this closely connected regulatory network by covalently modifying
the genetic code, thereby forming the epigenetic code.2
Despite an identical genomic blueprint, cells develop into
phenotypically distinct cell types to form the human organism. In
somatic tissues, the DNA methylation profile defines tissue
identity3 and is largely conserved over a lifetime, although
specific changes occur as life progresses.4 In addition, external
stimuli, such as lifestyle and environment, are capable of
introducing DNA methylation alterations associated with pheno-
typic changes, including disease susceptibility.5 Accordingly,
aberrant DNA methylation has been reported for diverse diseases,
with cancer being associated with the most profound changes.6
Specific DNA methylation changes and genome-wide alterations
are involved in all steps of tumorigenesis.7 In particular, the
epigenetic silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) is generally
thought to be of great importance to cancer onset and to driving
tumorigenesis.
However, to date, technical restrictions have meant that the
extent of DNA methylation alterations in human cancers could
only be estimated. For this reason, comprehensive whole-genome
efforts are required to evaluate the complexity of DNA methyla-
tion landscapes in tumors and their contribution to oncogenesis.
Accordingly, in this study, we comprehensively profiled the DNA
methylation landscape of 41000 normal and cancer samples
genome wide or at genome scale. Here, landscape features
obtained from few comprehensively profiled samples, including
cancer cell lines, could be replicated in large primary tumor
cohorts and genome-scale technologies, narrowing candidate
regions down to specific cancer-related aberrations. We recently
showed the value of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling for
the
identification
of
functional
variance
at
super-enhancer
regions.8 Here, we extend this work by enlarging the number of
cancer types and performing an unbiased interpretation in a data-
driven manner. This work expands previously reported findings by
cancer-specific studies3,9–17 or The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
efforts and extends these studies by the genome-wide profiling
for putative epigenetic cancer driver events across a broad
spectrum of cancer types.

 RESULTS
Genome-wide changes of DNA methylation in cancer
In order to gain a comprehensive insight into the variation in
DNA methylation between normal tissue types and alterations
occurring in different cancer contexts, we performed genome-
wide profiling of 22 human samples using whole-genome
bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). WGBS creates DNA methylation
profiles at base-pair resolution to give an unbiased overview
of the DNA methylation landscape. The analyzed samples
included normal tissue types and their associated neoplasms,
which are among the most abundant cancer types worldwide.
In particular, we used WGBS with eight normal tissue types
and 13 associated cancer samples (Table 1). Thirteen of these
cases
were
publicly
available
from
our
in-house
WGBS
pipeline.8 Normal samples included brain, blood, breast, prostate,
liver, lung, colon and placenta specimens. Brain tissue was
represented by matched white and gray matter frontal cortex
samples to account for different cell-type compositions. To
analyze DNA methylation variation from different perspectives,
we produced reference data sets for cancer samples that included
primary tumors and cancer cell lines. Changes during tumor
progression were analyzed using matched primary and metastatic
samples for breast and colorectal cancer specimens. The latter in
particular were a source of highly valuable information, as the
sequenced triplet (normal, primary cancer and liver metastasis)
was donor matched.
Bisulfite sequencing reads (median ~ 600 million per sample)
were mapped to the references genome (HG19) using the
BISMARK algorithm, which gave a median coverage of 13x per
sample (range 6 × to 25 × , Table 1). Consistent with a previous
report,3 normal tissue samples had an average CpG methylation
level of 70–80%, whereas cancer samples displayed severe losses
in this context (Figures 1a and b, Table 1). Global DNA methylation
was significantly lower in primary cancer samples compared with
normal tissues, and even lower in cancer cell lines (Po0.01;
Figure 1c). Cancer cell lines were previously described to harbor
specific epigenetic peculiarities,3–11 likely introduced by culture
and selection processes, and consequently our WGBS-derived
findings were extensively validated using larger cohorts of primary
cancer samples.
It is of note that the 58% global CpG methylation level in
placenta tissue differed markedly from that in other normal tissue
types (Figure 1a), this result being in line with a previous studies
reporting the existence of large partially methylated domains in
this tissue type.18,19 Principal component analysis indicated that
46% of the total variance was explained by the first three principal
components, which clearly separated normal from cancer samples
and primary tumors from cancer cell lines (Figure 1d). Whereas
normal samples clustered close together, cancer samples were
highly variable even within the same cancer types (Supplementary
Figure S1). Consistently, we observed less variance at single CpG
sites among normal tissue types (34%, s.d.40.1, Figure 1e) than in
cancer samples (64.8%, s.d.40.1, Figure 1f).20,21 In line with
previous studies, we detected a significant decrease in DNA
methylation
levels
in
the
majority
of
repetitive
elements
(RepeatMasker,
Student’s
t-test,
Po0.01;
Supplementary
Figure S2).
We found a progressive decrease in global DNA methylation
from healthy tissues to the primary tumors and, in turn, to their
associated metastases, suggesting a successive loss of DNA
methylation during tumorigenesis (Figure 1g; Supplementary
Figure S3a). This phenomenon was further underlined by principal
component analysis, which revealed increasing distances as
cancer progressed (Supplementary Figure S1). The decrease in
the level of DNA methylation resulted in a more heterogeneously
methylated genome, illustrated by the loss of the association
between methylation levels of neighboring CpG sites, indicating
that hypomethylation occurred randomly rather than at distinct
consecutive CpG sites (Figure 1h; Supplementary Figure S3b). The
oncogenic progression in the colon triplet could also be observed
at
loci
that
gain
DNA
methylation,
such
as
differentially
methylated regions hypermethylated in the primary tumor
compared with the matched healthy tissue, which further gained
methylation intensities in the metastasis (Figure 1i). Despite the
increase in DNA methylation intensity, the number of hyper-
methylated
differentially
methylated
regions
increased
only

 marginally, from 12 364 to 15 373, between the samples taken
from the primary colon tumor or the matched liver metastases.
Considering that the number of hypomethylated differentially
methylated regions more than doubled from the primary colon
tumor to the metastasis (87 663–205 459), resulting in global DNA
hypomethylation,
we hypothesize
that DNA
methylation is
progressively lost during tumorigenesis, whereas DNA hyper-
methylation
may
underlie
positive
clonal
selection
in
the
metastatic process.
DNA methylation-based segmentation of the human genome
Functional alterations of DNA methylation in human cancer
overlap with regulatory important regions, such as the transcription
start site or enhancers. Given the impact of DNA methylation on
transcriptional activity and hence cellular phenotypes, we aimed
to comprehensively profile the DNA methylation landscape for
regions actively contributing to gene regulation in normal tissues
and to determine their variation among cancers. Although
genome wide, the majority of CpGs are highly methylated,
distinct regions display strikingly lower methylation levels at
consecutive CpG sites. These hypomethylated regions (HMRs) are
associated with the accessibility of the transcriptional machinery
and transcription factors, and mark epigenetically active sites
within the DNA methylome.15,22–25 Promoters of transcribed
genes consistently harbor HMRs, and beyond the promoter
context HMRs are believed to mark cis-regulatory elements.
Hence, we suggest that the DNA methylation landscape is an
informative genomic feature that facilitates the interpretation of

 the genetic code and the identification of functional alterations in
human cancers.
We assembled a comprehensive HMR catalog using our WGBS
data sets, creating a genome-wide map of loci active in regulation.
In total, we identified 116 628 unique HMRs in normal tissue
samples, ranging from 43 259 to 66 711 in lung and prostate,
respectively (Table 1). With a geometric mean of 830 bp, HMRs
covered 2% of the entire genome. In all, 31.1% (36 229) of the
HMRs were located within gene promoters (GENCODE v16.0,
Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK), 36.4% (42 398) were intragenic and
32.8% (38 001) were located outside of the transcriptional context.
The relationship of HMRs to active regulatory sites was underlined
by the fact that ⩾ 95% of active and poised promoters and 60% of
strong enhancers overlapped with focal hypomethylated loci in
breast tissue with similar trends were seen in blood and liver cell
types (Supplementary Figure S4).
Surprisingly, only 23.0% of the HMRs (26 855) were common for
all cell types (c-HMR) and additional 25.7% (29 960) were
frequently observed (450% samples). In total, 57.8% (15 510) of
c-HMRs colocalized with gene promoters, including human
housekeeping
genes,
such
as
GAPDH,
TBP
and
PPIA
(Supplementary Figure S5). Conversely, 46.4% (54 134) of HMRs
were tissue-specific HMR (t-HMR) with B cells presenting the
highest
(14 092)
and
lung
(1226)
the
lowest
number
(Supplementary Table S1). The t-HMRs were of smaller size and
presented less CpG density compared with their common
counterparts (Figure 2a). By integrating histone modifications
data, enabling a genome-wide categorization of regulatory
regions and activity states,26 we observed that c-HMRs were
mainly
located
in
gene
promoters,
whereas
t-HMRs
were
frequently present at distal cis-regulatory enhancers regions
(Figures 2b and c). The unequal distribution between c- and
t-HMRs suggests that the epigenetic identity of distinct tissues
mainly
to
be
defined
outside
the
promoter
context
and
specifically at hypomethylated distal enhancer sites, which is in
line with previous studies analyzing different normal tissue and
cell types.

 Functionally, t-HMRs in gene promoters were significantly
enriched in genes presenting tissue-specific expression in the
respective tissue types (TiGER, Fisher’s test, Po0.01). Also, we
detected a compelling enrichment of t-HMR-related genes in
biological processes directly associates to their respective cell-type
and function. For examples, blood, liver and brain-specific
promoter-associated t-HMRs were enriched for leukocyte activa-
tion, organic acid metabolic processes and neurogenesis, respec-
tively (Bonferroni adjusted Po0.05, Figure 2d). Importantly,
functional enrichment was not only identified for t-HMRs located
in promoters, but also for those present outside (o10kb from
TSS) the direct regulatory context and supporting the importance
of proximal and distal t-HMRs for tissue-specific functions
(Supplementary Figure S6). We further reasoned that distal t-HMRs
are associated with active genes in their proximity. Accordingly,
we determined the degree of co-activation between t-HMRs and
proximal genes within the different tissue types, considering
hypomethylated promoters as potentially active. Consistent with
their suspected function t-HMR revealed co-activation of neigh-
boring genes more likely within their respective tissue context
than within unrelated types (Figure 2e).
In order to confirm the presence of c- and t-HMRs, we analyzed
a larger set of normal tissue types on the HumanMethylation450
BeadChip, an array-based DNA methylation platform interrogating
more than 450 000 CpG sites.27 Herein, the BeadChip analyzes
DNA methylation levels of 99% of gene promoters and additional
intra- and intergenic regulatory loci. Technically, 38.2% (44 547) of
WGBS-derived HMRs from normal tissues were represented on the
array platform. We integrated DNA methylation profiles from 114
normal specimens, representing the entire set of tissue types in
the analysis. Importantly, 495% of c-HMRs were confirmed to be
hypomethylated throughout all tissue types (45 probes, average
DNA methylation r30%, Supplementary Figure S7a). Also t-HMRs
could be identified with a sensitivity of up to 85% (false positive
rate o10%, 42 probes; area under the curve = 0.95), however,
with strong differences between tissue types (Supplementary
Figure S7b). In particular, only 33% and 20% of breast and prostate
specific HMRs could be validated (false positive rate o10%),
respectively, suggesting a high degree of inter-individual variation
and possibly related to the hormone-responsive nature the
tissues. Nevertheless, hierarchical clustering of the 9391 t-HMRs
interrogated by the BeadChip were capable the separate the
analyzed normal samples in respect to their tissue of origin
(Supplementary Figure S8).
Chasing functional DNA hypermethylation events in cancer
In an attempt to comprehensively describe the variability among
human cancer HMRs, we further interrogated DNA methylation at
the genome scale in 1112 primary samples using the Human-
Methylation450 BeadChip. This set of primary samples repre-
sented cancer types directly related to previously interrogated
tissue types. Overall, we analyzed 12 tumor types, with a median
representation of 59 samples (ranging from 19 to 321, Figure 3a).
In order to detect cancer-specific variance in this sample cohort,
we focused on c-HMR considering their potential role in tissue
maintenance and homeostasis. From the 19 686 c-HMRs that were
consistently hypomethylated in normal tissues, 11.6% (2279)
exhibited frequent DNA hypermethylation events in the 1112
cancer specimens (average DNA methylation 433% in at least
25% of the samples) (Supplementary Figure S9a). Analyzing
similarities within promoter-associated c-HMRs between tumor
samples revealed that cancer samples clustered with respect to
their tissues of origin, suggesting the existence of specific
cancer-type DNA methylation signatures (Figure 3b). This was
equally
true
for
c-HMRs
outside
the
promoter
context
(Supplementary Figure S10a), where there was an even higher
variance in cancer samples compared with promoter-related
HMRs (Supplementary Figure S9b). However, we also detected
substantial differences within the cancer types, whereby the
subgroups were clearly separated by the cluster approach. These
findings were in line with the previous observation that subsets of
tumor samples have elevated DNA hypermethylation frequencies.
In regard to their genomic location and putative functional
impact, we observed DNA methylation gains at c-HMRs mainly
occurred at poised promoters and repressed chromatin sites,
being
a
consistent
phenomenon
across
cancer
types
(Supplementary Figure S11). In line, the 100 most frequently
hypermethylated genes were significantly enriched in develop-
mental processes (gene ontology, biological processes, false
discovery rateo0.01) and homeobox structures (INTERPRO, false
discovery rateo0.01) (Supplementary Table S2), which is con-
sistent with previous cancer studies that reported a gain of DNA
methylation in genes related to development and differentiation,
such as Polycomb target genes. Hypermethylation events in
developmental genes are thought to promote a more undiffer-
entiated cell state by stably blocking genes that regulate the
transition from stem cell configuration to somatic differentiation.28
As these events are likely to be involved in the formation of a
tumor-promoting environment, they are considered to support
rather than to drive cells into uncontrolled growth.
To identify the functional epigenetic events that actively
contribute to cancer cell transformation, we interrogated the data
set using strategies specifically tailored to epigenetic data mining.
In particular, we assumed that functional DNA methylation events
follow similar rules to those of cancer-driving genetic alterations:
(1) known TSGs are silenced by promoter hypermethylation; (2)
functional hypermethylation events of TSG can be mutually
exclusive and (3) enriched in a cancer-type-specific manner.
We screened genes previously reported as being cancer genes
(COSMIC Cancer Gene census) for variation in promoter-associated
c-HMRs (rule 1). Consistent with their suspected guardian function,
protecting cells from oncogenic transformation, we detected
several TSG promoters that were hypermethylated in human
cancer samples (Figure 3c). Although genes like WT1, GATA3 and
PHOX2B were frequently hypermethylated in several cancer types,
others
were
restricted
to
certain
tissue
types.
Specifically,
promoter
hypermethylation
of
PIK3R1,
a
repressor
of
the
mitogenic AKT pathway,29 was mainly restricted to lung cancer
subtypes. PIK3R1 is frequently mutated in lung cancer and its
hypermethylation was significantly associated with gene repres-
sion in primary lung cancer samples (TCGA, LUAD, Pearson’s
correlation,
rho = –0.29,
Po0.01).
Taking
advantage
of
our
comprehensive segmentation of the DNA methylation landscape,
we further investigated c-HMR outside the promoter context
(o50-kb distant from TSS). Our examination of these distal
regulatory loci enabled us to identify additional DNA hypermethy-
lation events in c-HMRs near TSGs, such as FANCC, CYLD, MSH2,
PRDM1, ARID1A and BCOR (Supplementary Figure S10b). The gain
of DNA methylation near the DNA repair gene MSH2 (–31 972 bp)
was almost exclusively restricted to, and highly frequent in, liver
cancer specimens. However, other variations were present in a
broader spectrum of affected tissue types.
In a second approach to identify functional epigenetic events
(rule 2), we analyzed the mutual exclusivity of the DNA
hypermethylation events of putative TSGs that are frequently
altered by mutations,30 deletions31 or hypermethylation.32 To
avoid tissue-related biases, we analyzed hypermethylated gene
promoters separately for each cancer type. Genes involved in non
small cell lung cancer pathogenesis (KEGG ID: hsa05223) were
mutually
exclusive
in
lung
carcinomas
(Supplementary
Figure S12a). In particular, hypermethylation of PIK3R5, CDKN2A
and two retinoid X receptors (RXRG and RXRG) occurred in a non-
redundant manner in the non small cell lung cancer subtypes
(Z score = 2.82, empirical Po0.01). We also noticed that hyper-
methylation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase subunits was mutually
Cancer DNA methylomes

 exclusive in all three lung cancer subtypes (Z score = 4.14,
empirical Po0.01, Supplementary Figure S12b), suggesting a
disease-driving effect of the single alterations within the apoptosis
signaling cascade in lung cancer. As lung cancer susceptibility is
closely related to the smoking status of patients, we were
interested to assess the involvement of epigenetic alteration in
detoxifying enzymes in disease biology. We observed mutually
exclusive
hypermethylation
of
genes
involved
in
chemical
carcinogenesis
(KEGG
ID:
hsa05204).
In
particular,
frequent
alteration in GSTT1, ALDH3A3, CBR1 and GSTM3 showed non-
redundant events in the three lung cancer subtypes (Z score =
2.00, empirical Po0.05, Supplementary Figure S12c). Hence, we
suggest epigenetic alteration displays similar characteristics to
genetic aberration and that mutual exclusivity analysis is a
powerful method for identifying functional epigenetic events in
cancer.
In another attempt to identify novel cancer-driving events
(rule 3), we performed enrichment analysis of DNA hypermethyla-
tion events in putative TSGs30–32 for the cancer types, assuming
that
tissue-specific
events
have
a
role
in
the
oncogenic
transformation of their respective tissue types. We were able to
validate previous findings describing frequent hypermethylation
events of EPHA7, MGMT and MLH1 in colorectal cancer patients,
RARB in prostate tumors, and CASP8 in glioblastoma (Supplemen-
tary Figure S13). We identified additional, yet poorly recognized
relationships between epigenetic silencing and tissue-specific
carcinogenesis.
For
example,
colorectal
patients
harbored
recurrent hypermethylation of extracellular matrix components
of the TSGs CDM2, COL18A1 and MMP2,33 and lymphoma patients
frequently exhibited elevated promoter methylation levels of
CAST,
NCOA4,
LYN
and
DNMT3A.
Interestingly,
DNMT3A
is
frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia patients and so
its epigenetic silencing in lymphoma patients could also drive
tumorigenesis in this context.34 In addition, as LYN functions as a
B-cell receptor regulator, its repression could directly participate in
altered B-cell behavior and tumor formation.35
Finally, we hypothesized that owing to the selection process
during tumorigenesis resulting in an outgrowth of tumor sub-
clones, important functional epigenetic changes can be identified
by assuming an overrepresentation of positively selected signals
within the tumor mass. Consequently, putative epigenetic driver
events could present elevated DNA methylation intensities,
reflecting the greater abundance of cells harboring the respective
alterations. Therefore, we selected c-HMRs containing gene
promoters with recurrent (41% frequency) promoter hyper-
methylation at high intensities (average HMR methylation level
450%) and represented by at least two detection probes on
the BeadChip. Further, we focused on solid tumor types, as
clonal selection in leukemia potentially follows different dynamics.
This alternative approach highlighted potential epigenetic driver-
gene candidates that were highly depleted in developmental
genes, underlining the value of this identification strategy. In total,
we identified 231 HMRs with elevated DNA methylation levels in
cancer (average HMR methylation level 450%). Candidate genes

Cancer DNA methylomes

 included several known TSGs (Supplementary Table S3), including
MLH1, which is frequently hypermethylated in colorectal cancer.
Also, CDKN2A and XRCC5, which are TSGs involved in DNA repair,
displayed high hypermethylation intensities and, unlike MLH1,
were altered in all tumor types. Other HMRs exhibiting substantial
DNA methylation gains included genes involved in cell motility
(DCDC2), senescence (SRF) and differentiation (ADHFE1), as well as
the colorectal biomarker SEPT9.
The form and function of cancer DNA methylomes
Following the interpretation of specific functional regions within
the genome, we extended the analysis to the genome-wide
characterization of cancer-related alterations of the DNA methyla-
tion landscape. Consistent with previous studies of single cancer
types,10,11 we observed the formation of large intermediately
methylated blocks in all the cancer samples analyzed, which
defines an epigenetic hallmark of human cancers (Figure 4a;
Supplementary
Figure
S14).
These
regions
were
previously
described as partially methylated domains and likely display
distinct effects on genome regulation compared with HMRs,
unmethylated
regions
or
lowly
methylated
regions
(Supplementary Figure S15).24,36 There were large differences
between the samples even within cancer types, whereby HMRs
covered only 16.9% of all base pairs in the small cell lung cancer
genome, but 38.2% of base pairs in the lung squamous cell
carcinoma sample (Table 1). From the regulatory point of view,
cancer-specific HMRs (41,500 bp) were depleted in HMRs as
determined in a matched healthy context (Fisher’s exact test,
Po0.01), implying that global loss of DNA methylation in cancer
occurs in regions of weak regulatory activity, such as highly
methylated sites in normal tissues and being in line with previous
observations in partially methylated domains in cancer.9 This was
further supported by the fact that HMRs formed de novo were
enriched
in
intergenic
regions
compared
with
transcribed
sequences, and in intronic loci compared with exons (Fisher’s
exact test, Po0.01). It is of note that we detected progressive
DNA methylation variance events during the progression from
primary to metastatic colorectal tumors. Specifically, the meta-
static sample presented an additional set of de novo-formed HMRs
that covered 4% of the genome (Figure 4a). However, the
biological relevance of these mainly partially methylated domains
is poorly understood.

 To pinpoint variation in DNA methylation that is relevant to
regulation, we analyzed the variation occurring at HMRs and
assessed their potential role in tumorigenesis. Initially, we
determined the epigenetic variation present in c-HMRs, assuming
that these loci regulate housekeeping and TSGs. Intriguingly, we
noted a substantial increase in variation and DNA methylation
level in c-HMRs over all cancer types (47.9%, s.d.40.1) compared
with the normal samples (11.2%, s.d.40.1; Figures 4b and c).
Within hypermethylated c-HMRs, we detected previously reported
frequent DNA hypermethylation at gene promoters such as MGMT
in glioblastoma, NSD1 in neuroblastoma, ESR1 in breast cancer,
GSTP1 in prostate cancer and the promoter hypermethylation of
RASSF1 in various cancer contexts (Figure 4d, Supplementary
Figures S16a–d). Despite noting a global loss of DNA methylation,
regions flanking c-HMR did not present noticeable differences in
DNA methylation levels, indicating that these loci are protected
from global hypomethylation (Figure 4c). We had previously
described a similar phenomenon in a DNMT3B mutant ICF
patient.37 Despite losing 41% of DNA methylation genome-wide,
regions flanking CpG-rich promoters maintained their architec-
ture, suggesting that the HMR structure is important for its
regulatory activity.
An important aspect of our approach is that it was able to identify
additional aberrations beyond the promoter context that may be
involved in altered transcriptional regulation. By screening potential
regulatory regions of established cancer genes (COSMIC Cancer Gene
census), we determined, for example, that a c-HMR upstream of the
TSG and DNA repair pathway component FANCC was hypermethy-
lated in various cancer types (Figure 4e), results that were validated
using the DNA methylated array-based approach and hundreds of
cancer samples (Supplementary Figure S10). Subsequently, we aimed
to assess the extent to which the epigenetic cell identity is preserved
in cancer samples. Unlike the structural addition observed for
c-HMRs, t-HMRs of related cancer types frequently lost their unique
characteristics (Supplementary Figure S17). Substantial variation was
observed between t-HMRs in cancer samples from unrelated tissue
types, resulting in an inappropriate loss of DNA methylation in a non-
tissue-specific manner (Figure 4b). The loss of epigenetic control of
tissue-restricted gene expression may contribute to the loss of cell
identity and the greater variability of expression seen in tumor cells.10
DISCUSSION
DNA methylation is altered in cancer. However, owing to the lack
of genome-wide profiling studies, we have so far only been able to
speculate about its magnitude. Therefore, we comprehensively
profiled the DNA methylation landscape at base-pair resolution of
numerous normal samples and cancer samples representing the
most frequent cancer types. In line with previous studies using
equivalent technologies, we observed a general consistency of
DNA methylation levels in a large proportion of normal somatic
cells.3 The variation in DNA methylation was very much greater in
tumor samples in which two-thirds of the genome was affected by
potential consequences for gene expression10 and tumor cell
heterogeneity.38 From a functional perspective, we identified
distinct HMRs with common and tissue-specific characteristics,
which are probably essential for cell maintenance and cell-type-
specific functions, respectively. Both types were greatly altered in
the cancer context, with probable consequences for cell integrity
and identity.39 In particular, DNA hypermethylation proved to be a
very frequent event in all cancer types, and is probably involved in
neoplastic transformation as a disease-driving event. Genetically
defined
cancer
genes
were
epigenetically
silenced
in
an
unselective or cancer-type-specific manner. Potentially positively
selected alterations were consistently mutually exclusive, suggest-
ing that they actively contribute to neoplastic transformation and
progression.38,39
Overall, our study identified a large-scale loss and a focal gain of
DNA methylation as being a hallmark of human cancer based on
the extensive characterization of numerous normal and cancer
samples. The provided cancer DNA methylomes at the single
base-pair resolution highlight the massive and, at the same time,
specific
aberrant
DNA
methylation
changes
that
occur
in
tumorigenesis and suggest that they are likely to contribute to
the onset, progression and dissemination of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and primary tumor samples
Cancer cell lines were provided by the American Type Culture
Collection
(ATCC,
Manassas,
VA,
USA).
All
cell
lines
were
characterized by short tandem repeat analysis profiling (LGS
Standards SLU) within 6 months after receipt. Cell lines were also
tested for mycoplasma contamination. The used primary samples
received approval by the corresponding ethic committees. The
Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Bellvitge University
Hospital approved the current study under the reference PR055-
/10. All patients who supplied the primary tumor samples have
given written informed consent. The experimental methods
comply with the Helsinki Declaration.
DNA methylation analyses
WGBS was performed as previously described.8 Genomic DNA
libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Sample Preparation kit
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Following adaptor ligation,
DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Adaptor-ligated DNA was enriched
using the PfuTurboCx Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene,
San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end DNA sequencing (two 100 bp
reads) was developed using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000. WGBS was
performed de novo for 9 samples and for the remaining 13 we
used the reads available from our previous determination.8
Sequencing quality was determined by the Illumina Sequencing
Analysis Viewer and the FastQC software (Babraham Bioinfor-
matics, Cambridge, UK). Positional quality along the reads was
confirmed, and biases toward specific motifs or GC enriched
regions were excluded. Sequences alignment and DNA methyla-
tion
calling
was
developed
using
Bismark
software
V.0.7.4 (Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK).40 SAM/BAM
and BED files handling was perfomed by SAMtools,41 bedtools42
and Tabix.43 Statistical analysis and graphic representation was
obtained with R (http://www.R-project.org), libraries multicore and
ggplot2. We smoothed the DNA methylation as previously
described.44 Principal component analysis was carried out with
the R princomp routine. Circular plots were obtained using CIRCOS
software (Vancouver, BC, Canada).45 HG19 was used as reference
genome
and
retrieved
genomic
information
from
Biomart
(Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK)46 and Gencode V.16.47 Differentially
methylated regions were identified screening for regions present-
ing more than five consecutive CpG sites that showed a consistent
difference between the 95% confidence interval of the smoothed
methylation
profile.44
HMRs
were
identified
as
previously
described.23 The source code is available at GitHub (https://
github.com/mesteller-bioinfolab/meth_map_cancer.git). For the
identification of HMRs common to all analyzed tissue types (c-
HMRs), we obtained the genomic regions that were strictly
covered by HMRs in all normal tissues. Further, we merged regions
with a maximal genomic distance of 100 bp. t-HMRs were defined
as HMRs that did not present any overlap with HMR identified in
other normal tissue types. We defined frequent HMRs as HMRs
present in 450% of the normal tissues analyzed and not
overlapping c-HMRs. Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
assays were performed as previously described8,27 and the
data
was
processed
using
the
Bioconductor
minfi
package (Baltimore, MD, USA).48 Hierarchical clustering was
computed using Jaccard distance and the Ward clustering
method. In the cases continuous data points (that is, average

 DNA methylation), the values were dichotomized. In order to
validate the WGBS-associated t-HMRs, we computed the array-
based average DNA methylation level of the t-HMRs tissue-wise.
Then, given a threshold, true positives events were assigned when
the average DNA methylation was below the threshold for the
corresponding tissue. False positives were assigned when the
average DNA methylation was below the threshold for samples of
unrelated tissue origin. DNA methylation and expression data
are available at the SRA and GEO repositories under accession
numbers
SRP033252,

and
GSE52272. The source code of all computational analysis is
available at GitHub (https://github.com/mesteller-bioinfolab/meth
_map_cancer.git).
Mutual exclusivity analysis
A mutually exclusive alteration pattern reflects that the genes are
selectively targeted by cancer, as more than a single hit does
hypothetically not provide any further benefit for the tumor cell
and the tumorigenic process. The significance of the mutually
exclusive pattern has been measured by the empirical P-value
obtained from comparing the coverage of the observed gene set
(that is, the number of samples exhibiting methylation alterations
across these genes) to a background model obtained by 1 × 105
simulations. Each simulation was performed by a random
generation of altered samples per gene in which the number of
observed number of altered samples per gene and the overall
observed alteration burden per sample was respected by assign-
ing weights to the alteration probability in each of them, following
the rationale of the CDOCOCA method.49 The method is available
in the Gitools software (Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain).50
