IMPORTANCE The 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication is the copy number variant most frequently
associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and comorbidities such as
decreased body mass index (BMI).
OBJECTIVES To characterize the effects of the 16p11.2 duplication on cognitive, behavioral,
medical, and anthropometric traits and to understand the specificity of these effects by
systematically comparing results in duplication carriers and reciprocal deletion carriers, who
are also at risk for ASD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This international cohort study of 1006 study
participants compared 270 duplication carriers with their 102 intrafamilial control individuals,
390 reciprocal deletion carriers, and 244 deletion controls from European and North
American cohorts. Data were collected from August 1, 2010, to May 31, 2015 and analyzed
from January 1 to August 14, 2015. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of
the duplication and deletion on clinical traits by comparison with noncarrier relatives.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Findings on the Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), Nonverbal IQ, and
Verbal IQ; the presence of ASD or other DSM-IV diagnoses; BMI; head circumference; and
medical data.
RESULTS Among the 1006 study participants, the duplication was associated with a mean
FSIQ score that was lower by 26.3 points between proband carriers and noncarrier relatives
and a lower mean FSIQ score (16.2-11.4 points) in nonproband carriers. The mean overall
effect of the deletion was similar (–22.1 points; P < .001). However, broad variation in FSIQ
was found, with a 19.4- and 2.0-fold increase in the proportion of FSIQ scores that were very
low (�40) and higher than the mean (>100) compared with the deletion group (P < .001).
Parental FSIQ predicted part of this variation (approximately 36.0% in hereditary probands).
Although the frequency of ASD was similar in deletion and duplication proband carriers
(16.0% and 20.0%, respectively), the FSIQ was significantly lower (by 26.3 points) in the
duplication probands with ASD. There also were lower head circumference and BMI
measurements among duplication carriers, which is consistent with the findings of previous
studies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The mean effect of the duplication on cognition is similar to
that of the reciprocal deletion, but the variance in the duplication is significantly higher, with
severe and mild subgroups not observed with the deletion. These results suggest that
additional genetic and familial factors contribute to this variability. Additional studies will be
necessary to characterize the predictors of cognitive deficits.

T
he 600-kilobase (kb) break points 4 and 5 (BP4-BP5)
16p11.2 deletion and duplications (chr16; 29.6-30.2
megabase) are among the most frequent genetic causes
of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and other
neurodevelopmental disorders.1-5 These reciprocal copy num-
ber variants (CNVs) are associated with mirror phenotypes of
obesity and being underweight and with increased and de-
creased global and regional brain volumes in deletion and du-
plicationcarriers,respectively.6-8Previousstudies5,9havedem-
onstrated that ASD is diagnosed in approximately 18% of
deletion carriers and that this CNV affects global cognition by
shifting the IQ approximately 2 SDs without altering the vari-
ance. To our knowledge, such studies have not been con-
ducted for the reciprocal duplication. Akin to duplications of
other genomic regions, case series10-18 have reported variable
expressivity and suggested incomplete penetrance; how-
ever, incomplete penetrance was recently ruled out after re-
callingcarriersidentifiedinunselectedpopulations.19Thisphe-
notypic variability and the limited available data underscore
the need to systematically characterize the clinical impact of
the duplication with standardized assessments in large num-
bers of carriers.
The goal of this study was to characterize and elucidate
the effects of the 16p11.2 duplication on cognitive, behav-
ioral, medical, and anthropometric traits and to understand
the specificity of these effects by systematically comparing re-
sults in duplication carriers and reciprocal deletion carriers,
who are also at risk for ASD. To this end, we established, to our
knowledge, the largest cohort of duplication (n = 270) and de-
letion (n = 390) carriers to date from the 16p11.2 European and
Simons Variation in Individuals Project (Simons VIP) consor-
tia and the Cardiff University Experiences of Children With
CopyNumberVariants(ECHO)Study.Wepresentherethenatu-
ral history and phenotypic variation among the 16p11.2 dupli-
cation carriers and compare their results with those of their
intrafamilial control individuals (n = 102) and of individuals
with the reciprocal 16p11.2 deletion ascertained by similar
methods.
Methods
Patients
This study was reviewed and approved by the ethical commit-
tee or institutional review board for the European consortium
(http://www.cer-vd.ch/). Written informed consent and, when
appropriate,assentwereobtainedfromtheparticipantswhoun-
derwent full clinical assessments.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
This study describes only the proximal 600-kb recurrent
16p11.2CNVdelineatedbyBP4andBP5(29.6-30.2–Hg19).5Car-
riers have the same BP4-BP5 duplication (or deletion). Con-
trol participants were family members of the carriers who do
not carry the 16p11.2 duplication or deletion. Individuals with
anadditionaldeleteriousCNVwereexcluded.DeleteriousCNVs
were defined as (1) a known recurrent genomic disorder, (2) a
CNV encompassing a published critical genomic region or dis-
rupting a gene that is a known cause of neurodevelopmental
disorders, or (3) rare (<1 of 1000) and large (>500 kb) CNVs. The
percentages of additional deleterious CNVs were compared be-
tween duplication probands and deletion probands similarly
ascertained on the basis of a neurodevelopmental disorder
(eMethods in the Supplement). Ascertainment is detailed in
eTable 1 and the eMethods in the Supplement. Data were col-
lected from August 1, 2010, to May 31, 2015.
Cognitive Functioning, Psychiatric,
and Behavioral Assessments
PhenotypicevaluationsfortheSimonsVIPparticipantsandthe
16p11.2 European Consortium were performed as previously
reported.5TheWechslerAbbreviatedScalesofIntelligencewas
used to assess IQ for the ECHO Study participants.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from January 1 to August 14, 2015. We ex-
amined differences in the Full Scale (FSIQ), Verbal (VIQ), and
Nonverbal (NVIQ) IQs and z scores for body mass index (BMI)
(calculatedonheightandweight)andheadcircumference(HC)
between 16p11.2 duplication carriers and their noncarrier fa-
milial controls. The IQ values were derived from age and
developmentally appropriate standardized measures (Differ-
ential Ability Scales,20 Mullen Scales for Early Learning–AGS
Edition,21 and Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence22).
Cognitivemeasuresarestandardizedtoamean(SD)of100(15),
with higher scores indicating more developed cognitive abili-
ties. For participants performing out of normative range on
instruments,wegeneratedratioIQscoresbasedonsubtestraw
score age equivalencies (mental age/chronological age × 100)
so that an accurate IQ estimate was established for each par-
ticipant. The BMI z scores were estimated based on age and
sex norms, and HC z scores were estimated based on age- and
sex-normed orbitofrontal HC measurements obtained during
laboratory visits.
Carriers were stratified into the following 3 groups: pro-
bands, pediatric carrier relatives (<18 years of age), and adult
carrier relatives (≥18 years of age). These groups were com-
pared with noncarriers. We also compared differences in phe-
notypes between probands whose inheritance status (de novo
and inherited) was documented and their noncarrier familial
controls. The same analyses were performed with the dele-
tion carriers and their noncarrier familial controls.
We used linear mixed models to compare differences in
phenotypes between carrier or inheritance groups while ac-
countingforcorrelatedmeasureswithinfamilies(familialclus-
tering) to estimate the effect of the 16p11.2 duplication or de-
letiononthephenotype.Thegroupdifferenceswerecontrolled
for by study cohort (European vs United States), age, and sex.
Additional contrasts were included for multilevel categorical
variables to allow for pairwise comparison among all levels of
the variable. To examine whether the group differences were
drivenbyotherdiagnosticfactors,additionallinearmixedmod-
els were fitted by adding ASD, seizure diagnosis, and, when ap-
plicable, NVIQ to the existing models as covariates.
We used the Levene test23 to assess equality of variance
and the Fisher exact test to assess the association between bi-

Global Cognitive Functioning
The mean FSIQ across the 270 duplication carriers was 78.8.
Forty-seven of 154 carriers (30.5%) met criteria for intellec-
tual disability. When controlling for cohort, age, and sex, the
FSIQ was significantly lower in duplication carriers com-
paredwithintrafamilialcontrols(18.0points;P < .001;Table3).
The largest effect was observed in probands (decrease in mean
FSIQ, 26.3 points) followed by pediatric and adult carrier rela-
tives (decreases, approximately 16.2 and 11.4 points, respec-
tively) relative to intrafamilial controls. When controlling for
the same covariates, the effect of the reciprocal deletion was
similar,withameandecreaseincarriersof22.1points(P < .001;
eTable 2 in the Supplement) in FSIQ compared with intrafa-
milial controls.
The effect of cohort on FSIQ was the same in both CNV
groups, with significantly lower FSIQ in the European vs the
US cohort (by 13.3 points in the duplication group and 13.9
pointsinthedeletiongroup;P < .001).TheeffectsofbothCNVs
on FSIQ, VIQ, and NVIQ remained similar after additionally
controlling for ASD and seizures (eTables 3-8 in the Supple-
ment), which were associated with IQ in the duplication but
not the deletion groups (see the Neurologic Findings and Psy-
chiatric Symptoms subsections in this Results section).
Variability of the Effect on Global Cognition
The variance of FSIQ in duplication carriers was significantly
higherthanobservedindeletioncarriers(Levenetest,P < .001).
We found a 19.4-fold excess (Fisher exact test, P < .001) of very
low FSIQ (≤40; 15 of 154 [9.7%]) in the duplication compared
with the deletion carriers (1 of 200 [0.5%]) and a 2.0-fold en-
richment (Fisher exact test, P = .01) of the duplication carri-
ers greater than the population mean FSIQ compared with de-
letion carriers (>100; 30 of 154 [19.5%] vs 20 of 200 [10.0%])
whowereascertainedbythesameinvestigatorsusingthesame
methods (Figure 1). The European and US duplication co-
horts contributed (albeit not equally) to the lower- and higher-
functioning participants (eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supple-
ment). The large variance of FSIQ among duplication probands
was not driven by cohort, the presence of ASD, seizure status,
or HC (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

Another factor underlying increased variation in IQ may
have been additional undetected genetic variants. When we
combined the European, Simons VIP, and Signature Genom-
icsLaboratoriesdatasets(describedineMethodsintheSupple-
ment), the odds of an additional deleterious CNV were 2.5-
fold higher in duplication compared with deletion carriers
ascertained for neurodevelopmental disorders (P = .006)
(eMethods and eTable 9 in the Supplement). The median size
and the mean number of genes included in additional CNVs
are similar for 16p11.2 deletion and duplication carriers
(eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Global Cognition of De Novo and Inherited
Duplication Carriers
TheFSIQ,NVIQ,andVIQwerenotsignificantlydifferentinpro-
bands with de novo vs inherited duplications but were signifi-
cantly greater in probands with de novo vs inherited deletions
(eTables 10 and 11 in the Supplement). In families with inher-
itedduplications,approximately36.0%oftheIQvarianceinpro-
bands was accounted for by the IQ of the transmitting parent
(eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Too few de novo carriers were
available for this analysis (n = 13). For deletion carriers, less of
the variability was explained by parental IQ (11.0% for inher-
ited and de novo cases; eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Neurologic Findings
Epilepsy was reported in 35 of 180 of duplication probands
(19.4%) and 2 of 90 of their carrier relatives (2.2%) (eTable 12
in the Supplement). We found a broad spectrum of severity
ranging from benign focal epilepsy to severe epileptic syn-
dromes, with focal epilepsies being the most frequent type (16
of 37 [43.2%]). In the reciprocal deletion group, the fre-

and 4 of 73 relatives (5.5%) (P = .56 and P = .39, respectively).
The clinical spectrum was broad, with a predominance of gen-
eralized seizures (eTable 13 in the Supplement).
In a subset of 86 duplication carriers with a magnetic reso-
nance image of the brain, enlarged ventricles and cerebellar
hypoplasia were the most frequent findings (13 [15.1%] and 10
[11.6%], respectively). In deletion carriers, posterior fossa ab-

(eResults and eTables 12 and 13 in the Supplement).
The median age at first walking was delayed in 82 dupli-
cation proband carriers compared with 164 reciprocal dele-
tionprobandcarriers(18vs16months;Wilcoxonranksumtest,
P = .009). This difference was mainly driven by the increased
proportion (2.6-fold) of very-late-onset walking (>24 months)
among the duplication probands compared with the deletion
probands (P = .02) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Psychiatric Symptoms
Diagnostic criteria for ASD were met in 36 of 180 duplication
probands (20.0%) and 2 of 90 of their carrier relatives (2.2%).
In the deletion group, the proportion of probands with a
diagnosis of ASD was similar (51 of 317 [16.1%]; P = .27). How-
ever, among those with an ASD diagnosis, duplication pro-
bands were significantly more impaired in cognition than
deletion probands by 26.3 points (2-sided unpaired t test,
P < .001). Duplication probands with ASD also had signifi-
cantly lower cognition than those without an ASD diagnosis
(mean FSIQ, 52.8 vs 75.4; t test, P < .001; Figure 1E). Other
DSM-IV diagnoses were reported in 25 of 38 of duplication car-
riers with ASD (65.8%), 71 of 143 probands (49.7%), and 38 of
86 of their carrier relatives without a diagnosis of ASD (44.2%).
Among deletion carriers, other DSM-IV-TR diagnoses were re-
ported in 45 of 55 with ASD (81.8%), 157 of 266 probands
(59.0%), and 31 of 69 of their carrier relatives without ASD
(44.9%)(eTables14and15intheSupplement).Wedidnotiden-
tify cases of schizophrenia beyond the 4 duplication carriers
ascertained from a schizophrenia cohort.
Body Mass Index
The mean BMI z score was approximately 0.6 points lower
(P = .003) in duplication carriers compared with intrafamilial
controls (Table 3 and Figure 2A); this decrease was consistent
across all carrier groups, including probands, pediatric car-
rier relatives, and adult carrier relatives (P = .004, P = .09, and
P = .01, respectively. The relative risk for obesity (BMI z score
≥2 SDs above the 98th percentile in children; BMI raw score
[calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared] ≥30 in adults) decreased 3-fold in pediatric and
adult duplication carriers when compared with the control
group (Fisher exact test, P < .001). In the reciprocal deletion
carriers, BMI z score increased by 0.7 points in carriers com-
pared with intrafamilial controls (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Body mass index was not associated with ASD, sei-
zures, or NVIQ in duplications or deletions (eTables 16 and 17
in the Supplement). In the longitudinal analysis, BMI in-
creased with age in deletion carriers, whereas it remained rela-
tively stable from 0 to −1 SD in duplication carriers (Figure 2B).
Head Circumference
The HC z score was a mean of 1.1 points lower in duplication
carriers (P < .001; Table 3 and Figure 2C) and 0.5 points higher
(P = .002) in deletion carriers compared with noncarriers
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Similar to BMI and in contrast
to IQ, this effect on HC z score was consistent across pro-

bands and relatives. Forty-eight of 215 duplication carriers
(22.3%) were microcephalic (HC z score, less than −2 SDs be-
low the 2th percentile). Head circumference was signifi-
cantly associated with NVIQ in duplications (P = .03) but not
deletions (P = .28), and we found a marginal association be-
tween HC and ASD in deletions (P = .07) but no association in
duplications (P = .16). Seizures were not associated with HC
in duplications or deletions (eTables 18 and 19 in the Supple-
ment). Head circumference and BMI z scores were correlated
within the deletion and duplication probands (for both groups,
r = 0.4; P < .001). In the longitudinal analysis, the significant
decrease in HC z scores during the first 2 years of life mirrored
the increasing HC z scores during the same period observed
in deletion carriers (Figure 2D). Malformations, medical prob-
lems, and sex differences are detailed in the eResults and
eTables 20 to 23 in the Supplement.
Discussion
We present here a comprehensive phenotypic characteriza-
tion of the 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication and deletion ascer-
tained in US and European cohorts to understand their spe-
cificeffectsonneurocognitive,behavioral,andanthropometric
phenotypes. The large variance in FSIQ is an important fea-
ture of the duplication, with increased proportions of indi-
viduals at both extremes of the FSIQ distribution when com-
paredwiththedeletiongroup.Unlikethedeletiongroup,which

showed a consistent effect of 16p11.2 deletion on FSIQ across
carrier groups and a normal distribution consistent with what
is observed in the general population, the duplication was as-
sociated with a multimodal distribution in FSIQ and different
effect sizes for probands and other carriers in the family. The
mean IQ decrement in duplication probands (26.3 points) was
likely influenced by the clinical ascertainment for neurode-
velopmental disorders. In contrast, the 11.4-point mean de-
crease observed in adult carriers was most likely an underes-
timate of the duplication effect because most of these adults
are transmitting parents ascertained for higher functional sta-
tus. The mean effect of the duplication may therefore lie be-
tween these 2 estimates. Differences in IQ observed in the Eu-
ropean and US cohorts did not influence these estimates. This
finding was also in agreement with that of a recent adult popu-
lation-based study from Iceland25 that reported a 15- to 19-
point decrease in VIQ and NVIQ in 7 duplication carriers
(P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). We suspect that the sub-
population of low-functioning duplication carriers with FSIQ
of 40 or less harbors additional factors that are not tolerated
and possibly lethal before birth in deletion carriers, who al-
most never present such severe cognitive impairment.
Participants with second pathogenic CNVs, other identi-
fied monogenic disorders, prematurity, fetal alcohol syn-
drome,andneonatalhypoxiawereintentionallyexcludedfrom
the main analyses, but other undetected factors may have in-
fluenced the severity of the clinical presentation in the pro-
bands. The 2- to 3-fold increase of additional deleterious CNVs
in duplication compared with deletion probands ascertained
for neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that the duplica-
tion requires additional factors to reach the threshold for clini-
cal evaluation compared with the deletion. Some of these

unknowngeneticfactorsmaybeinheritedfromparentsassug-
gested by the correlation between FSIQ in probands and their
parents (r = 0.4, similar to previously published studies esti-
matingtheheritabilityofIQinthegeneralpopulation26,27).The
remaining unexplained variation was substantial, making the
use of parental IQ alone as a predictor insufficient (eFigure 4
in the Supplement). The significant decrease in IQ in pro-
bands with an inherited vs a de novo deletion confirmed our
hypothesis that families with an inherited deletion may be en-
richedinadditionalgeneticorenvironmentalfactorsthataffect
cognition. We did not observe this phenomenon for inherited
duplications.
Differences in the European vs US cohorts may be the con-
sequence of access to clinical chromosome microarrays that
differ by health care system. Recruitment methods also dif-
feredinbothcohorts.ProbandsfromtheEuropeancohortwere
directly referred from genetic units to the research center,
whereas the Simons VIP participants required active partici-
pation of the proband’
s family. Nonetheless, these differ-
ences between cohorts did not influence the effect of the
duplication on IQ.
The frequency of ASD was similar in deletion and dupli-
cation probands and was consistent with previous case-
control association studies28-30 that have demonstrated that
both reciprocal CNVs equally predispose to ASD. However, our
study suggests that the duplication is associated with a form
of low-functioning ASD, whereas cognition in deletion carri-
ers with ASD is mostly within the normal range. This finding
also applies in epilepsy, equally frequent in duplication and
deletion probands but only associated with lower FSIQ in the
duplication group. This finding suggests that these neuropsy-
chiatric diagnoses may occur in the presence of additional fac-
tors with a negative effect on IQ. Similar to ASD cohorts, an ex-
cess of male participants and lower IQ in female participants
were observed in the duplication and deletion carriers ascer-
tained for neurodevelopmental disorders.
The low frequency of schizophrenia in the duplication co-
hort is discordant with the association reported in prior
studies.4 This discordance is likely in part owing to the youth
of our participants (mean ages, 18.2 years in the US and 26.7
years in the European cohorts) and the fact that adults were
ascertained as parents. Following up our probands is
required to estimate the risk for schizophrenia accurately.
Although the penetrance of obesity is higher in the dele-
tion group compared with being underweight in the duplica-
tion group, the effect sizes of both variants appear to be simi-
lar when compared with intrafamilial controls. The effect of
the duplication mirrors that of the deletion with the excep-
tion of the age-related effect.5 As expected, geographic loca-
tion influences BMI, but the effect of the duplication is simi-
lar in both cohorts.
The 1-point decrease in mean HC z score in duplication
carriers occurs during the first two years of life and mirrors the
early increased growth observed in the deletion carriers
(Figure 2D). Head circumference, which is highly correlated
with brain volume,7,8 is associated with NVIQ in the duplica-
tion carriers (albeit with a small effect size) and a trend was
observed for ASD in deletion carriers. The main limitation of
this study is the ascertainment bias in the probands who
came to clinical attention and underwent clinical testing with
a chromosome microarray. We attempted to minimize this
bias by performing cascade genetic testing within families to
identify additional duplication carriers and include all dupli-
cations carriers within the study.
Conclusions
The 16p11.2 duplication has a consistent effect on some
traits, such as HC and BMI. The duplication may interact with
additional factors that lead to different severities of neurobe-
havioral phenotypes, including a subgroup of low-
functioning duplication carriers with ASD, which is absent in
the deletion group. The estimated effect size of the duplica-
tion on IQ suggests that this CNV contributes to approxi-
matelyhalfofthecognitivedeficitincarrierswithmildtomod-
erate intellectual disability. Additional factors may contribute
to the neurodevelopmental outcome in some individuals. Fu-
ture studies will aim to quantify the contribution of addi-
tional genetic and environmental factors to the phenotype.
