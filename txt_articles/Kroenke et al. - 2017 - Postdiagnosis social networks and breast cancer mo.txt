BACKGROUND: Large social networks have been associated with better overall survival, though not consistently with breast cancer
(BC)–specific outcomes. This study evaluated associations of postdiagnosis social networks and BC outcomes in a large cohort.
METHODS: Women from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project (n 5 9267) provided data on social networks within approximately 2
years of their diagnosis. A social network index was derived from information about the presence of a spouse/partner, religious ties,
community ties, friendship ties, and numbers of living first-degree relatives. Cox models were used to evaluate associations, and a
meta-analysis was used to determine whether effect estimates differed by cohort. Stratification by demographic, social, tumor, and
treatment factors was performed. RESULTS: There were 1448 recurrences and 1521 deaths (990 due to BC). Associations were similar
in 3 of 4 cohorts. After covariate adjustments, socially isolated women (small networks) had higher risks of recurrence (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.77), BC-specific mortality (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.33-2.03), and total mortality (HR, 1.69; 95%
CI, 1.43-1.99) than socially integrated women; associations were stronger in those with stage I/II cancer. In the fourth cohort, there
were no significant associations with BC-specific outcomes. A lack of a spouse/partner (P 5.02) and community ties (P 5.04) pre-
dicted higher BC-specific mortality in older white women but not in other women. However, a lack of relatives (P 5.02) and friendship
ties (P 5.01) predicted higher BC-specific mortality in nonwhite women only. CONCLUSIONS: In a large pooled cohort, larger social
networks were associated with better BC-specific and overall survival. Clinicians should assess social network information as a marker
of prognosis because critical supports may differ with sociodemographic factors. Cancer 2017;123:1228-37. V

INTRODUCTION
Social networks are defined as the web of social relationships surrounding an individual.1 It is well established that larger
social networks predict lower overall mortality in healthy populations2 and in breast cancer (BC) patients.3-8 However,
associations with BC-specific outcomes have been mixed. In 2835 postmenopausal BC survivors in the Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS), Kroenke et al3 found that socially isolated women (ie, women with small networks) assessed before their di-
agnosis were twice as likely to die of BC than socially integrated women. Reynolds et al7 found suggestive but nonsignifi-
cant associations of social network size assessed at diagnosis with BC-specific survival in 1011 women with both ductal
carcinoma in situ and invasive BC from the Black and White Study. Two larger studies in women with invasive BC found
significant associations with overall mortality but not BC-specific mortality. However, each of these studies included BC
survivors years after the initial diagnosis: 2 years on average after the diagnosis in one cohort (n 5 2264) and 6 years after
the diagnosis in a second cohort of 4589 BC survivors.4,6 It is unclear whether discrepancies in associations are due to dif-
ferences in study size, population characteristics, methodological differences, or other factors.
Determining whether and in whom social networks influence BC-specific outcomes is necessary for developing ef-
fective social and clinical interventions. Therefore, we examined associations between postdiagnosis social networks and
prognosis in a pooled cohort of 4 cohorts of 9267 women with invasive BC from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project

time since diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and levels of
social support or social strain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ABCPP
The ABCPP is an international collaboration of 4 pro-
spective cohorts including 18,333 women9 from multiple
US sites and Shanghai, China, who were diagnosed with
stages I to IV invasive BC. The goal of the collaboration
was to examine the roles of physical activity, adiposity, di-
etary factors, supplement use, and quality of life in BC
prognosis. Three of the cohorts—the Shanghai Breast
Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS),10 the Life After Cancer
Epidemiology
(LACE)
study,11
and
the
Women’s
Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) study12—specifically
recruited BC patients. The fourth cohort included BC
patients diagnosed in the NHS, a prospective study of fe-
male nurses.13 Each study collected data on clinical, so-
cial, reproductive, and lifestyle factors. Data were
harmonized into a common data set. Individual study in-
vestigators received institutional review board approval
from their respective institutions to participate in this
collaboration.
Study sample
We have described the derivation of the cohort (including
the LACE, NHS, SBCSS, and WHEL cohorts) previous-
ly.14 Briefly, data on social factors were collected approxi-
mately 6 months after diagnosis in SBCSS and on average
1.8 years after diagnosis in the WHEL and LACE studies.
In the NHS, we used data collected within the 2 years
(median, 0.9 years) after diagnosis. Women were excluded
if they were missing data for more than 2 social ties (n 5
485 or 5%). Otherwise, we assumed that missing data sig-
nified a lack of a social tie. We included 1947 women
from the LACE cohort, 2221 from the NHS cohort, 2127
from the SBCSS cohort, and 2972 from the WHEL co-
hort (n 5 9267).
Data Collection
Social networks
The ABCPP social network index14 used in this analysis
was adapted from the Berkman-Syme social network in-
dex,15 which is frequently used in epidemiological re-
search and includes 5 components: spouse/intimate
partner, number of relatives, friendship ties, religious/so-
cial ties, and community ties. Women were assigned 1 or
0 points according to whether or not they were married/in
an intimate relationship, were engaged in volunteer work,
or were engaged in religious participation and 1, 2, or 3
points for cohort-specific (approximate) tertiles of the sum
of relatives or friends. A higher score signified greater so-
cial integration. We calculated the ABCPP social network
index separately in each cohort and divided the index into
cohort-specific tertiles of women who were socially isolat-
ed, moderately integrated, and socially integrated. We also
standardized the continuous social network score and cre-
ated a z score (mean, 0; standard deviation, 1) for analyses
of trends. The ABCPP social network index was developed
and validated previously against the Berkman-Syme social
network index and showed good agreement (r 5 0.72; P
< .001; j 5 0.60).14
Sociodemographic and reproductive
characteristics
Available sociodemographic and reproductive data in-
cluded the following: race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Asian, Hispanic, or other), education
(less than high school, high school, some college, or col-
lege graduate), menopausal status at diagnosis (premeno-
pausal, postmenopausal, or unknown), parity, and age at
first birth.
Lifestyle factors and body mass index
Lifestyle factors were measured at the same time as the so-
cial variable assessments. Smoking history was self-
reported (never, past, or current). Recreational physical
activity in metabolic equivalents (MET-hours per week)
was determined from validated semiquantitative question-
naires.16 Height and weight were self-reported in LACE
and NHS; in SBCSS and WHEL, height and weight were
measured during study visits. The body mass index (kg/
m2) was derived from the weight and height. Information
on alcohol intake (g/d) was derived from validated food
frequency questionnaires.17
Clinical characteristics and BC treatment
Available clinical and treatment data included the age at
diagnosis (years), American Joint Committee on Cancer
stage (I, II, III, or IV), estrogen receptor/progesterone re-
ceptor status, nodal status, human epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and comorbidity status
(defined as diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction,
or stroke). Treatment information included data on sur-
gery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormonal
therapy.
Ascertainment of BC outcomes
The main outcomes were BC recurrence, BC-specific
mortality, and total mortality. Recurrence was defined as

 recurrence/metastasis or the development of new primary
BC. Each study followed participants to ascertain BC out-
comes. Detailed methods were previously published for
each study9; in brief, outcomes were ascertained through a
combination of self-reporting, medical record review, and
linkage to vital statistics registries.
Statistical Analyses
Using analysis of covariance and Mantel-Haenszel chi-
square tests, we examined age-adjusted associations be-
tween social network categories and potential confound-
ing variables.
Analyses of social networks and outcomes
We examined associations between social networks
assessed within approximately 2 years of diagnosis and
outcomes. Each analysis involved 3 steps. First, Cox pro-
portional hazard regression models were used to estimate
study-specific adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) for associations of social networks
with each outcome (ie, recurrence, BC-specific mortality,
total mortality, and non-BC mortality). Second, a meta-
analysis was conducted that combined study-specific HRs
with inverse-variance weights in random effects models.18
The Q statistic was used to assess heterogeneity in relative
risk estimates across cohorts.19 When there was no evi-
dence for heterogeneity (P > .10), cohorts were pooled,
and associations between social networks and outcomes
were evaluated with proportional hazards regression ad-
justed for the cohort in addition to covariates listed later.
When associations differed across cohorts, we reported
the Q statistic and separately reported associations for dif-
fering groups. Tests for linear trend of social network size
were
conducted
with
the
standardized
continuous
measure.
We conducted initial models adjusted for age and
time between diagnosis and social assessment (lag time).
We additionally adjusted a second set of models for the
following: cohort, American Joint Committee on Cancer
stage, race/ethnicity, education, parity, menopausal status
at diagnosis, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and
comorbidity. Covariates were chosen based on a priori de-
termination from a literature review. We allowed missing
categories for covariates. However, we compared results
from this approach against complete case ascertainment.
In a recent article on the ABCPP,14 we reported that
socially isolated women had more adverse lifestyle charac-
teristics and a lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy.
Therefore, we also considered a final set of models adjust-
ed additionally for treatment, smoking, physical activity,
alcohol, and the postdiagnosis body mass index to deter-
mine whether treatment and lifestyle factors explained
associations between social networks and survival. We de-
termined the degree to which adjustments for these varia-
bles attenuated associations by evaluating the percent
changes in effect estimates. We also conducted sensitivity
analyses with complete case ascertainment and with the
exclusion of data provided <6 months since the diagnosis
because associations might have differed in women under-
going initial treatment (n 5 8001). We conducted tests of
proportionality with variable-by-time interactions.
We evaluated analyses stratified by demographic, so-
cial, BC tumor, and treatment variables, including social
support levels, as well as caregiving obligations and social
strain levels because these can have negative effects on
health.20-22 We computed interaction terms based on the
cross-product of the continuous social network variable
and each of the dichotomous stratification variables and
evaluated interactions with Wald chi-square tests when
analyses suggested differences in associations across strata.
We also evaluated associations between each type of social
tie and outcomes stratified by the median age (�56.1 vs
>56.1 y), race (white vs nonwhite), and country (United
States vs Shanghai, China). Associations with reported P
values < .05 were statistically significant. All statistical
tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Among 9267 women, there were 1448 recurrences and
1521 deaths, with 990 due to BC. The follow-up from di-
agnosis ranged from 0.2 to 20.9 years (median, 10.6
years). Socially isolated women were more likely to be
Caucasian, college-educated, and nulliparous. Socially
isolated women were also more likely to have lower levels
of physical activity, be current smokers, drink more than
recommended, and be obese. Finally, social isolation was
associated with a lower likelihood of receiving chemother-
apy or hormonal therapy and a higher likelihood of lump-
ectomy (Table 1). Age, menopausal status at diagnosis,
cancer stage, and treatment with radiation were not relat-
ed to social network size.
Social Networks and Outcomes
In meta-analysis, associations for non-BC mortality did
not differ by cohort, so we pooled all 4 cohorts. Women
with smaller social networks had a higher risk of non-BC
mortality (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.44-2.30; P for trend
< .001). In contrast, associations between social isolation
(vs social integration) and recurrence (Q 5 6.31, P 5
.10), BC-specific mortality (Q 5 7.69, P 5 .05), and total

 mortality (Q 5 6.17, P 5 .10) differed statistically and/or
qualitatively by cohort, so data were not pooled; associa-
tions were highly similar in the LACE, NHS, and SBCSS
cohorts and differed in the WHEL cohort.
After adjustment for potential confounding varia-
bles in LACE, NHS, and SBCSS, socially isolated women
had higher risks of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43;
95% CI, 1.18-1.74; P for trend < .001), BC-specific
mortality (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.33-2.03; P for trend <
.001), and total mortality (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.43-1.99;
P for trend < .001) in comparison with socially integrated
women (Table 2). Adjusting for lifestyle and treatment
factors attenuated the results for the linear social network
variable by 13% for recurrence, by 18% for BC mortality,
and by 26% for total mortality, but associations remained
significant after adjustment for these potential mediating
factors. In the WHEL cohort, those in the middle tertile
of social networks had nonsignificantly lower risks of out-
comes in fully adjusted models (Table 2). Results were
similar in analyses with complete case ascertainment or
when we restricted analyses to women with data provided
�6 months after their diagnosis. In proportional hazards
tests, treatment effects varied with time. However, model-
ing these effects did not materially influence associations
of interest, so we retained the original variables, which
represent time-averaged treatment effects.
In stratified analyses, in the LACE-NHS-SBCSS co-
hort, associations with recurrence and BC mortality were
stronger for those with stage I/II cancer versus stage III
cancer (recurrence) or stage III/IV cancer (BC-specific
mortality), although only the interaction term for BC
mortality was statistically significant (P 5 .02; Table 3).
Associations did not differ by age, time since diagnosis, es-
trogen receptor/progesterone receptor status, HER2 sta-
tus, or treatment (data not shown). Qualitatively,
associations appeared stronger for nonwhite women ver-
sus white women, although differences were not statisti-
cally significant (data not shown).
Types of Social Ties and Outcomes
Being unmarried/unpartnered was associated with worse
BC-specific mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.77)
and total mortality (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21-1.74) in
older white women, but it was not associated with out-
comes in nonwhite or younger white women. Small
friendship and relative networks predicted significantly
worse recurrence, BC-specific mortality, and total mortal-
ity in nonwhite women but not white women. Religious
participation was not associated with outcomes. Commu-
nity ties predicted lower risks of BC-specific mortality
(HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.99) and total mortality (HR,
0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92) in older white and Asian wom-
en but not in other women (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In the LACE, NHS, and SBCSS cohorts, socially isolated
BC survivors had higher risks of recurrence, BC-specific
mortality, and total mortality; associations were stronger
in those with earlier stage disease. Controlling for treat-
ment and lifestyle factors attenuated effect estimates but
did not fully account for the observed associations. In con-
trast, in the WHEL cohort, associations between social
networks and BC-specific outcomes were generally non-
significant. Smaller social networks predicted higher non-
BC mortality in all cohorts. Ties to family and relatives
predicted lower mortality in nonwhite women, whereas a
spouse predicted lower mortality in older white women.
Community ties predicted better outcomes in older
whites and Asians. To our knowledge, this is the largest
study examining associations between social networks and
BC survival in a diverse population of BC survivors with
extensive data on potential confounding and mediating
variables.
In agreement with previous studies,4,6,23,24 smaller
social networks were strongly related to non-BC outcomes
in all 4 cohorts. Associations with BC-specific outcomes
were more complex. Our main effect associations were
strikingly similar in the LACE, NHS, and SBCSS cohorts
and consistent with the previous NHS study3; this sug-
gests that most BC survivors do benefit from larger net-
works. Findings differed in the WHEL cohort and were
similar to those reported by Beasley et al,6 who also
showed a U-shaped association between social connected-
ness and BC-specific mortality. The authors did not dis-
cuss this association, but 2 other studies may provide
insights. In the Black and White Study, Reynolds et al7
found stronger evidence of an association of social net-
work size and BC mortality in whites than blacks. Al-
though neither association was significant, the effect size
of the association reported in whites was similar to that in
our findings (HR, �1.4). In the NHS data, although
numbers of close friends and relatives predicted lower
BC-specific mortality, community ties, religious ties, and
spouses were not related to this outcome.3 Religious ties,4
marital ties,25 ties to relatives,3 and community ties4 have
each been related to a better cancer prognosis. However,
taken together, these findings suggest that not all ties are
equally helpful to all women.
In fact, there were substantial differences in associa-
tions between specific social ties and outcomes in

b The age- and lag time–adjusted model was adjusted for age (continuous) and time between diagnosis and social network assessment (continuous).
c Model II was adjusted additionally for the following covariates: cohort (LACE, NHS [reference], WHEL, or SBCSS), education (less than high school, high
school, some college, or college degree or greater [reference]), race (white [reference], black, Asian, Hispanic, or other), stage (I [reference], II, III, or IV), estro-

pregnancy > 20 weeks and age at first birth � 20 years, � 2 pregnancies and age at first birth < 20 years, or � 2 pregnancies and age at first birth � 20 years),
menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal [reference]), and comorbidity (no [reference] vs yes).
d Model III was adjusted additionally for the following possible mediating (lifestyle and treatment) variables: chemotherapy (no [reference] vs yes), radiation (no

alcohol intake (0 [reference], > 0 to < 1.7, 1.7 to < 15, or � 15 g/d), smoking (never [reference], past, or current), physical activity (<3 MET h/wk, 3 to <10 MET

e The association between social isolation and outcomes differed in WHEL for recurrence (Q 5 6.31, P 5.10), breast cancer–specific mortality (Q 5 7.69,

 subgroups by age, race/ethnicity, and country of origin.
Similar to the results reported in Table 4, which include
the WHEL participants, we noted that associations with
BC-specific outcomes within the WHEL cohort also dif-
fered by sociodemographic factors such as race and age
(data not shown). Differences in associations may be due
to population differences in social networks as well as dif-
ferences in the characteristics of informal caregivers. In
the National Survey of Families and Households, blacks,
Asians, and Hispanics were shown to rely more on rela-
tives than whites26; Asians and whites were more likely
than others to participate in recreational groups.26 The
marital benefit seen in the older white women in this
study may be due in part to the higher likelihood of
spouses assuming caregiving roles among whites,27 where-
as nonwhite informal caregivers are more likely to be
friends and family.27-29 It is unclear why there were no
significant associations between any social tie and

 outcomes in younger white women, although possible rea-
sons include sufficient levels of support from proximal ties
when networks are small,30 inadequate support from im-
portant ties (eg, if a spouse cannot take off time from
work to provide care), and diminished strength of ties in
white women, who are more likely to move away from ex-
tended families than women of other racial/ethnic
groups.31,32 Future research in diverse cancer populations
should clarify these findings. Nonetheless, similar main
effects associations in 3 cohorts, with subgroup differences
as to which ties were most predictive, provide evidence
that women depend differently on their social networks
according to their demographic, cultural, and tumor char-
acteristics.33 This suggests that a social network index may

 not be the optimal summary measure of the influence of
social relationships on outcomes in certain sociodemo-
graphic groups. These novel findings were facilitated by
the large pooled cohort.
Because patient needs differ by stage, needs for, and
the influence of, social support may also differ by stage.
Weaker associations in late-stage cancer patients suggest
that resources provided within naturally occurring net-
works may not be well-matched to the needs of those with
late-stage cancer.34 Managing relationships with family
and friends providing caregiving may be difficult when
both patients and caregivers are coping with feelings of
high distress,35 and expectations regarding needs differ.36
In the Pathways Study, Kroenke et al37 found that tangi-
ble support was most important to quality of life in wom-
en with late-stage cancer but that affectionate support,
though related to a higher quality of life in earlier stage
patients, predicted lower quality of life in later stage
patients. Specific training could be needed to assist late-
stage cancer patients. However, because previous random-
ized studies have shown little effect of social support inter-
ventions in metastatic patients,38,39 the impact of social
relationships on survival for women with late-stage disease
may be limited, and social interventions might best target
women with earlier stage cancer.
A major strength of the current analysis was its abili-
ty to examine associations in a large cohort of ethnically
and geographically diverse BC survivors. Another strength
was the ability to harmonize the studies to develop a con-
sistent postdiagnosis social network measure. In addition,
we minimized confounding by making adjustments for
variables related to BC severity, including stage, hormone
receptor status, and HER2 status, as well as reproductive
history,
lifestyle,
demographic,
and
socioeconomic
variables.
One limitation was the lack of complete social net-
work information across cohorts, although study-specific
social network categories helped us to address this. Wom-
en of lower socioeconomic status were not well-
represented in this population, and this may have led to
underestimation of the association because women of low
socioeconomic status tend to have smaller social net-
works40 and poorer survival. Furthermore, African Ameri-
can and Hispanic women were also not well-represented
in the cohort. Future studies should include larger num-
bers of these women and should validate social network
measures for them; this is important because most previ-
ous studies have been conducted in primarily white popu-
lations. However, this study supports the use of a social
network measure in a Chinese population.
We considered the idea that disease severity could
influence social network size. However, older women’s so-
cial networks have been shown to be relatively stable
across diagnoses;3,41 although the fact that younger wom-
en’s networks are less stable41 could help to explain the
lack of association in younger white women in the current
study. Studies should examine changes in social networks
over time and outcomes. Other limitations include the
somewhat different timing of social network measures in
the cohorts and missing covariate data. However, com-
plete case ascertainment and sensitivity analyses by the
time of the social network measures with respect to the di-
agnosis resulted in similar associations (data not shown).
In summary, smaller social networks were related to
higher risks of recurrence and mortality in BC survivors
and particularly in women with earlier stage cancer.
Health care providers need to assess information on social
networks at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up
because this may be a potential marker of prognosis.
