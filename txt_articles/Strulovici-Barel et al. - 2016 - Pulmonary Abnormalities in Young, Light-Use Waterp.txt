Abstract
Rationale: Waterpipes, also called hookahs, are currently used by
millions of people worldwide. Despite the increasing use of waterpipe
smoking, there is limited data on the health effects of waterpipe
smoking and there are no federal regulations regarding its use.
Objectives:Toassesstheeffectsofwaterpipesmokingonthehuman
lung using clinical and biological parameters in young, light-use
waterpipe smokers.
Methods: We assessed young, light-use, waterpipe-only smokers in
comparison with lifelong nonsmokers using clinical parameters of
cough and sputum scores, lung function, and chest high-resolution
computed tomography as well as biological parameters of lung
epithelial lining fluid metabolome, small airway epithelial (SAE) cell
differential and transcriptome, alveolar macrophage transcriptome,
and plasma apoptotic endothelial cell microparticles.
Measurements and Main Results: Compared with nonsmokers,
waterpipe smokers had more cough and sputum as well as a
lower lung diffusing capacity, abnormal epithelial lining fluid
metabolome profile, increased proportions of SAE secretory
and intermediate cells, reduced proportions of SAE ciliated and
basal cells, markedly abnormal SAE and alveolar macrophage
transcriptomes, and elevated levels of apoptotic endothelial cell
microparticles.
Conclusions: Young, light-use, waterpipe-only smokers have a
variety of abnormalities in multiple lung-related biological and
clinical parameters, suggesting that even limited waterpipe use has
broad consequences on human lung biology and health. We suggest
that large epidemiological studies should be initiated to investigate
the harmful effects of waterpipe smoking.

The waterpipe, also called hookah, shisha,
or narghile, an instrument for smoking
fruit-flavored tobacco, is used by millions
of people worldwide (1–4). The tobacco is
placed in a bowl surrounded by burning
charcoal; when the smoker inhales, air is
pulled through the charcoal and into the
bowl holding the tobacco (3, 5). The
resulting smoke is bubbled through water,
carried through a hose, and inhaled. It
includes volatilized and pyrolyzed tobacco
products, equivalent in a single bowl
waterpipe session over 45–60 minutes to
one pack of cigarettes, together with carbon
monoxide and charcoal components. In

Strulovici-Barel, Shaykhiev, Salit, et al.: Effects of Waterpipe Smoking
587
 addition to nicotine and its metabolites,
urinalyses of waterpipe smokers have
identified a variety of compounds that
overlap with, but also differ from, those of
cigarette smokers (3, 6).
While waterpipe smoking is commonly
associated with the Middle East, the
use of waterpipes is becoming more
prevalent in the United States and
worldwide (4, 5, 7). In the United States,
9–20% of young adults report that they
have used waterpipes (5, 8), and waterpipe
“bars” have become common in many
U.S. cities, with increasing waterpipe use
among young adults (4, 5). Many waterpipe
smokers believe that the water filters
out “toxins” from the smoke, making the
waterpipe a safer smoking alternative to
cigarettes (9, 10). Despite the increasing
prevalence of waterpipe smoking, there is a
paucity of data on the health effects of
waterpipe smoking and there are no federal
regulations regarding its use (5, 7, 11).
On the basis of knowledge that the
first abnormalities associated with cigarette
smoking are found in lung cells long
before there are abnormalities in clinical
parameters such as lung function and lung
imaging (12–17), we hypothesized that
even light-use waterpipe smoking for only a
few years, exposing the smoker not only to
tobacco smoke but also to the flavorings
added to the tobacco and the volatile
components of the heated charcoal
surrounding the tobacco, likely mediates
abnormalities relevant to lung health.
To assess this hypothesis, we compared
young, light-use waterpipe smokers with
nonsmokers matched for sex and ethnicity,
using a variety of lung-related parameters,
including (1) blood carboxyhemoglobin,
cough and sputum scores, lung function,
and chest high-resolution computed
tomography (HRCT); (2) metabolites
present in the lower respiratory tract epithelial
lining fluid (ELF); (3) cell differentials and
transcriptome of the small airway epithelium
(SAE); (4) cellular composition of the ELF
of the lower respiratory tract recovered
by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and
transcriptome of alveolar macrophages (AMs);
and (5) plasma levels of circulating endothelial
microparticles (EMPs) derived from
pulmonary capillaries undergoing apoptosis.
Some of the results presented in this
article have been reported previously in the
form of abstracts (18, 19).
Methods
Self-reported never smokers
(“nonsmokers”; n = 19) and self-reported
waterpipe-only smokers (“waterpipe
smokers”; n = 21) were recruited from the
general population in New York City by
posting advertisements in local newspapers,
electronic bulletin boards, and waterpipe
bars. All subjects were evaluated at the
Weill Cornell National Institutes of Health
Clinical and Translational Science Center
and Department of Genetic Medicine
Clinical Research Facility using institutional
review board–approved clinical protocols.
All subjects were determined to be
healthy on the basis of their medical
history, physical examination, and
detailed laboratory assessments (Table 1;
for full inclusion and exclusion criteria,
see METHODS section in the online
supplement). Urine nicotine and cotinine
levels were determined using liquid
chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (ARUP Laboratories, Salt
Lake City, UT) (20). All subjects were
recruited from the New York metropolitan
area. The two study groups had similar
environmental exposures; no subject had
any industrial exposures; and only one
nonsmoker and one waterpipe smoker
had a history of exposure to secondhand
cigarette smoke. Even though recruitment
was open for all waterpipe smokers at
least 18 years of age, the waterpipe smokers
who volunteered were young and light-use
waterpipe smokers, representative of the
rise in waterpipe smoking prevalence in
the young adult population in the
United States.
All subjects underwent pulmonary
function tests performed according to
American Thoracic Society guidelines
(21, 22), and their cough and sputum scores
were based on the St. George’s Respiratory
Questionnaire (23). Chest HRCT was
used to quantify emphysema (24).
Pulmonary function and HRCT
quantification are detailed in the
METHODS section in the online supplement.
The SAE, AM, and ELF samples were
collected using fiberoptic bronchoscopy
as previously described (25, 26). The
metabolites in the lower respiratory tract
ELF of waterpipe smokers and nonsmokers
were compared in BAL fluid collected
from a random subset of the nonsmokers
(n = 5) and waterpipe smokers (n = 8).
Total RNA was extracted from the SAE of
all subjects, and AM samples were obtained
from all nonsmokers and from 19 of the
21 waterpipe smokers (two missing samples
due to technical issues during the collection
procedure) using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and RNeasy
(RNeasy MinElute RNA Purification Kit;
QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and stored
in Ambion RNAsecure reagent (Life
Technologies) at 2808C. Total RNA
processing on Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA), quality control, and analyses were
performed as previously described (16).
Processing of plasma EMPs as well as
quantification and analysis of total EMPs
(CD42b2CD311), pulmonary-derived
EMPs (CD42b2CD311ACE1), and
apoptotic EMPs (ratio of CD42b2CD621
to CD42b2CD311 ,2 SD below the
average level in nonsmokers) were
performed as previously described (27) and
as detailed in the METHODS section of the
online supplement.
Transcriptome Analyses
Transcriptome analyses were performed as
detailed in the METHODs section in the
online supplement. SAE and AM
waterpipe-responsive gene lists were
created with all genes differentially
expressed in waterpipe smokers versus
nonsmokers using the following criteria:
genes expressed in at least 20% of subjects
in each group with a fold change greater
than or equal to 1.5 (P , 0.05 with
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Waterpipe smoking is
increasing worldwide, mainly among
young adults. It is second only to
cigarette smoking. Researchers in most
studies have assessed older, heavy-use
waterpipe smokers with disease
manifestation and not young, light-use
waterpipe smokers.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: We evaluated multiple lung
components, including clinical and
biologic abnormalities, in several
anatomic components in the lungs of
young, light-use waterpipe smokers
with no clinical manifestation of
disease.

 Benjamini-Hochberg correction [28]).
The number of differentially expressed
waterpipe-responsive genes expressed
outside the nonsmoker mean expression
level (62 SD) divided by the total
number of waterpipe-responsive genes
was summarized as a percentage and
calculated for each subject as a waterpipe
transcriptome response score. For both the
SAE and AM transcriptomes, the data were
depicted (1) using principal component
analysis (PCA), collapsing the expression
levels of all probe sets present in at least
20% of the subjects’ data into a set of linear
variables (principal components [PCs])
that summarized the variability between
the subjects, with the three components
collapsing the largest variability between
the groups displayed in a three-dimensional
plot; (2) as an SAE and AM waterpipe
transcriptome response score of each subject;
and (3) as a fold change of the average
expression level in waterpipe smokers
compared with nonsmokers of all SAE and
AM waterpipe-responsive genes displayed in
Gene Ontology functional categories.
Global Index Analysis
To summarize the differences observed
in waterpipe smokers compared with
nonsmokers, a global index was created
that included cough and sputum scores,
diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
monoxide (DLCO), SAE PCs, SAE
transcriptome response score, AM PCs,
AM transcriptome response score, plasma
apoptotic EMP levels, and SAE cell
differentials. See the METHODS section of the
online supplement for index calculations.
Statistical Analysis
For comparison of numerical data (e.g., age,
urine nicotine levels, total and apoptotic
EMP levels, relative gene expression, lung
function, and percentage of emphysema
in waterpipe smokers vs. nonsmokers),
a two-tailed Student’s t test was used. Gene
expression levels were corrected for false
discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg
correction [28]). For comparison of
categorical data (e.g., sex, ethnicity, and
number of subjects with abnormal cough
and sputum scores, low DLCO, or apoptotic
EMP levels), a x2 test was used with the
Yates correction for low number of subjects
when applicable. The differential metabolite
profile of the lung ELF samples was
assessed using MassHunter Profinder
software (Agilent Technologies, Santa

online supplement.
Results
The study population of nonsmokers and
waterpipe smokers was comparable in
terms of sex, ethnicity, body mass index,
and alpha-1 antitrypsin levels (P . 0.3,
all comparisons) (Table 1). The
waterpipe smokers were younger than
the nonsmokers (mean difference, 8 yr)
(Table 1). In prior studies, we observed that
there were no age-related modifications
to cough and sputum scores, SAE cell
differentials, DLCO levels, SAE and AM
gene expression, or plasma EMP levels
in nonsmokers (r2 < 0.1, correlation of
all parameters with age) (see METHODS
section and Figure E1 in the online
supplement) (16, 27). Waterpipe smokers
smoked an average of 3.5 6 2.5 sessions per
week for an average of 4.1 6 2.5 years.
Carboxyhemoglobin levels were significantly
higher in waterpipe smokers than in
nonsmokers (P , 0.02).
Lung-related Clinical Parameters
Cough and sputum scores were significantly
higher in waterpipe smokers than in
nonsmokers (P , 0.008, both comparisons).
Thirty-three percent of waterpipe
smokers had an abnormal cough score
(>2) compared with 5% of nonsmokers
(P , 0.03), and 19% of waterpipe
smokers had abnormal sputum production
(>2) compared with 0% of nonsmokers
(P , 0.04) (Table 1, Figure 1A). DLCO
percentage of predicted value, corrected for
hemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin levels,
was lower in waterpipe smokers than
in nonsmokers (P , 0.04). None of the
nonsmokers had a low DLCO level (,80%
predicted and below the 95% range of
normal DLCO calculated per subject based
on sex, age, and height using a dataset
comprising 405 healthy nonsmokers [29]).
In contrast, 38% of the waterpipe
smokers had a low DLCO level (P , 0.009)
(Figure 1B). The HRCT percentage of
emphysema was not significantly different
between the groups (P . 0.07).
Metabolite Analysis
Metabolic profiling provided quantification
for 1,675 features in the lower respiratory
tract ELF; of these, 31 features with
significantly different abundance in
waterpipe smokers versus nonsmokers were
structurally identified (P , 0.05) (Table E1;
see Figures E2A–E2F for examples).
Small Airway Epithelium
The number of SAE cells recovered and the
percentage of total epithelial and
inflammatory cells were comparable in
waterpipe smokers and nonsmokers
(P . 0.6, both comparisons) (Table 1).
However, the SAE of waterpipe smokers
had an altered cellular composition, with a
higher percentage of secretory cells and
intermediate cells and a lower percentage
of ciliated cells and basal cells (P , 0.005,
all comparisons).
The SAE transcriptome of waterpipe
smokers was significantly modified
compared with that of nonsmokers, with a
marked segregation of the groups based on
the genome-wide PCA (Figure 2A). There
were 212 probe sets representing 159
unique, annotated genes significantly
different between waterpipe smokers and
nonsmokers (Figure E3A). Of those, 35%
were downregulated and 65% were
upregulated (“SAE waterpipe-responsive
genes”) (Table E2).
The SAE waterpipe transcriptome
response score, a measure of the number
of SAE waterpipe-responsive genes
differentially expressed in a subject, was
significantly higher in waterpipe smokers
than in nonsmokers (P , 10212)
(Figure 2B). Gene Ontology analysis of the
categories of the SAE waterpipe-responsive
genes showed a broad distribution
dominated by genes related to metabolism,
signal transduction, transcription, and
transport (Figure 2C). Interestingly, while
the SAE transcriptome of cigarette smokers
is characterized by upregulation of many
oxidative stress-related genes (13–17),
very few genes in this category were
upregulated in the SAE of waterpipe
smokers (categorized as functional
category “other” due to the low number
of oxidant-related genes) (see DISCUSSION in
the online supplement and Table E2).
Alveolar Macrophages
The cell differentials of the lower respiratory
tract ELF (AMs, lymphocytes, neutrophils,
eosinophils) recovered from the lower
respiratory tract by BAL were not
statistically different between the groups
(P . 0.05, all comparisons), and the
number of recovered AM cells was
also comparable (P . 0.08) (Table 1).

transcriptome demonstrated a segregation

samples in each group, 239 probe sets
representing 181 unique, annotated

analysis of the categories of the AM
waterpipe-responsive genes showed a
broad distribution; that is, as with the
SAE, they were dominated by genes
related to metabolism, signal transduction,
transcription, and transport (Figure 2F).
Among these downregulated genes were
many linked to lung inflammation and
host defense (see Discussion section in the
online supplement and Table E3).
Endothelial Microparticles
Waterpipe smokers showed an increase
in plasma total EMP levels compared with
the nonsmokers (P , 0.04) (Figure 3A).
On average, 77 6 8% of the plasma
EMPs in the waterpipe smokers were of
pulmonary origin (CD42b2CD311ACE1),
a percentage comparable to that of
nonsmokers (P . 0.1) (Figure 3B). The
level of EMPs derived from apoptotic cells
was increased in the waterpipe smokers
compared with nonsmokers (P , 0.05),
with 45% of waterpipe smokers having
apoptotic EMPs (,2 SD) below the
average level in nonsmokers compared
with 0% of nonsmokers (P , 0.008)
(Figure 3C). For global assessment of all
parameters compared in waterpipe
smokers and nonsmokers, see the RESULTS
section in the online supplement and
Figure E4.
Discussion
Despite the assumption among waterpipe
users that smoking waterpipe is “safer” than
smoking cigarettes (9, 10), evaluation of
multiple lung components demonstrated
a significant number of lung clinical and
biological abnormalities in light-use,
waterpipe-only smokers compared with
healthy lifelong nonsmokers. The waterpipe
smokers had increased cough and sputum
scores and lower diffusing capacity, as
well as biological abnormalities in
several anatomic components in the lung,
including (1) in the lower respiratory tract
ELF, differentially present metabolites;
(2) in the SAE, the cell population where
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and most lung cancers are
initiated (30–33), disarray of the
proportions of cell types, with increased
numbers of secretory and intermediate
cells and decreased numbers of ciliated and
basal cells and an abnormal transcriptome;
(3) in AMs, the pulmonary representative
of the mononuclear phagocyte system,
functioning as the scavenger cell in the
lower respiratory tract (34, 35), abnormal
transcriptome; and (4) in the pulmonary
capillary endothelium, an increased
proportion of circulating apoptosis-derived
EMPs (27, 36).
Clinical Consequences
The use of waterpipes to smoke tobacco
is increasing worldwide, mainly among
young adults and teens, reaching a global
epidemic second only to cigarette smoking.
Epidemiological studies suggest that
10–48% of adolescents and young persons
in middle school, high school, or
universities in the United States, Europe,
and other countries admit to ever smoking
waterpipes and that 10–35% admit to
being current waterpipe smokers (2–5, 7).
However, most studies of the long-term
effects of waterpipe smoking on pulmonary
function, cancer prevalence, and other
clinical symptoms have studied older
(ages 40–60 yr), heavy-use waterpipe
smokers (30–60 waterpipe-year history),
mostly in waterpipe smokers who already
have disease manifestation (2, 4, 11, 37–39).
Researchers in a number of studies
have assessed lung function in older,
heavy-use waterpipe users and found
evidence of reduced lung function
parameters, including reduced FVC,
FEV1, maximal midexpiratory flow, peak
expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow,
and midexpiratory phase levels, as well as
FEV1/FVC, compared with nonsmokers,
with a correlation between the duration and
quantity of waterpipe smoking and the
abnormalities of pulmonary function
(3, 11, 37, 38). These older, heavy-use
waterpipe smokers have a high frequency of
cough and sputum compared with
nonsmokers, and these symptoms appear at
an earlier age than in cigarette smokers
(37, 40, 41). An important observation in
the present study is that a significant
proportion of young waterpipe smokers
with a history of fewer than four waterpipe
sessions per week for less than 5 years have
clinical abnormalities, including an increase
in cough frequency and sputum
production, and, strikingly, 38% have
reduced diffusing capacity. The subgroup of
waterpipe smokers with normal HRCT and
normal spirometry but low DLCO are of
interest, as we have recently demonstrated
that cigarette smokers with the same
clinical phenotype (normal HRCT and
normal spirometry but low DLCO) are at a
sevenfold greater risk of developing COPD
within 4 years than are those with the same
phenotype but with normal DLCO (29).
Biological Changes
There have been a number of analyses
identifying compounds that are inhaled in
waterpipe smoke, likely placing a significant
stress on lung biology (3, 6). Compared
with one cigarette, one waterpipe session
exposes the smoker to 2–4 times the
amount of nicotine, 7–11 times the amount
of carbon monoxide, 100 times more tar,

 17 times the amount formaldehyde,
2–5 times the amount of high molecular
weight carcinogenic polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, and 3 times the amount of
phenol (3). In addition, high levels of
benzene, volatile aldehydes, and other
toxins originating from flavoring have been
detected in waterpipe smoke (3, 6).
Consistent with the concept that at least
some components of waterpipe smoke
reach the lower respiratory tract,
metabolomic profiling of lung epithelial
fluid demonstrated a variety of metabolites
in the lower respiratory tract ELF of
waterpipe smokers, with a differential
abundance compared with nonsmokers.
The SAE and AM transcriptomes of
waterpipe smokers could easily be
differentiated from those of nonsmokers,
with hundreds of genes up- and
downregulated, indicating potential
dysregulation of these lung cell populations
in response to waterpipe smoking.
Waterpipe transcriptome response scores
summarizing the waterpipe-modified gene
effect on the SAE and AM transcriptomes
distinguished not only light-use waterpipe
smokers from nonsmokers but also
waterpipe smokers with normal spirometry
and normal DLCO from those with normal
spirometry but reduced DLCO. For
both the SAE and AMs, most of these
dysregulated genes were metabolism,
transcription, and signal transduction
related, some of which were previously
associated with the pathogenesis of COPD
and/or cancer.
Interestingly, there was little overlap
among the SAE genes dysregulated in
waterpipe smokers compared with the
overlap described for cigarette smokers,
suggesting that the SAE pathologic
phenotypes may be different from
those induced in classic cigarette
smoking–induced disorders. In this regard,
the SAE of waterpipe smokers had an
altered cellular composition with a pattern
that combined features both similar to and
distinct from those commonly observed
in cigarette smokers. Similar to SAE
changes in cigarette smokers, there was a
decrease in the proportion of ciliated cells,
the mediator of mucociliary clearance (42),
as well as increased numbers of secretory
cells resembling mucous cell hyperplasia,
in smokers (43). These morphological
alterations may be responsible for higher
levels of cough and sputum scores observed
in waterpipe smokers. However, in contrast
to basal cell hyperplasia commonly
observed in the airways of healthy smokers,
in the SAE of waterpipe smokers there
was a significant decrease in the proportion
of basal cells, the stem/progenitor cell
population of the airway epithelium (44).
This was accompanied by an increased
proportion of intermediate undifferentiated
cells, which are basal cell–derived
precursors of the differentiated cell
populations (44). The decreased proportion
of basal stem/progenitor cells in the airway
epithelium is a rather unique phenotype,
previously described only in bronchiolitis
obliterans (45) and airway epithelial aging
(46). This suggests that waterpipe
smoking–induced changes in the SAE
transcriptome may have important
consequences with regard to the structural
organization and maintenance of this
anatomic compartment.
While the SAE transcriptome of
cigarette smokers is characterized by
upregulation of oxidative stress–related
genes (13–17), very few genes related to this
category were upregulated in the waterpipe
smokers, suggesting that passage through
water filters out many of the oxidants in
waterpipe smoke. Interestingly, while the
majority of differentially expressed genes in
the SAE were upregulated, the majority of
differentially expressed genes in the AMs
were downregulated. However, similarly
to its effect on the SAE transcriptome,
waterpipe smoking induced a unique gene
expression pattern in the AMs not
previously reported to be evoked by
cigarette smoking or other known
modulators of the macrophage phenotype
(47, 48). Among the downregulated genes
were a variety of genes critical for
inflammation and host defense functions
(see DISCUSSION section in the online
supplement for details regarding the
specific SAE and AM dysregulated genes).
In contrast to cigarette smokers, in whom
there is a higher percentage of macrophages
recovered compared with nonsmokers (48),
there was no significant difference in the
proportions of macrophages or other cell
types recovered from the BAL of waterpipe
smokers compared with nonsmokers, an

 observation that may be explained in part
by the marked difference in the inhaled
smoke composition of waterpipe versus
cigarette smoke.
Endothelial cells respond to cell
activation, injury, and/or apoptosis by
shedding submicron membrane vesicles
from their plasma membranes, known as
EMPs (27, 49). Apoptotic loss of pulmonary
capillaries occurs in association with
cigarette smoking (50), and analysis
of lung sections of individuals with
COPD demonstrates increased DNA
fragmentation and endothelial apoptosis in
the pulmonary capillaries, representing
early lung destruction (50, 51). We have
previously shown that cigarette smokers
undergo pulmonary endothelial apoptosis
as measured by high levels of total EMPs
and an increased proportion of apoptotic
EMPs in their plasma (27). The observation
that the total level of circulating EMPs and
the proportion of apoptotic EMPs were
significantly higher in waterpipe smokers
than in nonsmokers suggests the possibility
of ongoing lung capillary endothelial
apoptosis associated with light-use
waterpipe smoking.
Implications
The data we present regarding abnormalities
in all clinical and lung-related biological
parameters used to compare waterpipe
smokers with nonsmokers suggests that even
light-use waterpipe smoking in young
individuals significantly affects lung biology
and health. On the basis of this evidence in the
context of the increasing use of waterpipe
smoking, together with the accumulating
evidence in the literature that older, heavy-use
waterpipe smokers have loss of lung function
compared with nonsmokers, our findings
support efforts to regulate and reduce
waterpipe smoking, especially among the
young population, and to initiate large
epidemiological studies on the harmful effects
of waterpipe smoking. n
