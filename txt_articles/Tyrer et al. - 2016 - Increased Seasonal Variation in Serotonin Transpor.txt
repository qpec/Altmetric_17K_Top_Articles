Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent with rates of 1–6% and greater prevalence at more extreme latitudes; however, there
are almost no direct brain investigations of this disorder. In health, serotonin transporter binding potential (5-HTT BPND), an index of
5-HTT levels, is greater throughout the brain in fall-winter compared with spring-summer. We hypothesized that in SAD, this seasonal
variation would be greater in brain regions containing structures that regulate affect such as the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices
(PFC and ACC). Furthermore, given the dimensional nature of SAD symptoms, it was hypothesized that seasonal fluctuation of 5-HTT
BPND in the PFC and ACC would be greatest in severe SAD. Twenty SAD and twenty healthy participants underwent [11C]DASB
positron emission tomography scans in summer and winter to measure seasonal variation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND. Seasonal increases
in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND were greater in SAD compared with healthy in the PFC and ACC, primarily due to differences between severe
SAD and healthy (severe SAD vs healthy; Mann–Whitney U, U = 42.5 and 37.0, p = 0.005 and 0.003, respectively; greater magnitude in
severe SAD of 35.10 and 14.23%, respectively), with similar findings observed in other regions (U = 40.0–62.0, p = 0.004–0.048; greater
magnitude in severe SAD of 13.16–17.49%). To our knowledge, this is the first brain biomarker identified in SAD. This creates a new
opportunity for phase 0 studies to target this phenotype and optimize novel prevention/treatment strategies for SAD.

INTRODUCTION
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a subtype of major
depressive disorder (MDD) characterized by recurrent
winter major depressive episodes (MDEs) with full remission
in spring-summer, poses a heavy burden: among the
subtypes of MDD, it has the highest frequency of MDEs
being almost yearly, and 40% of cases progress to non-
seasonal MDEs (Faedda et al, 1993; Rosenthal et al, 1984a;
Schwartz et al, 1996). The annual prevalence of SAD is
typically 1–6%, with the highest rates occurring at more
extreme latitudes (Magnusson, 2000). Although information
about SAD is accumulating, a critical gap is the lack of direct
brain investigations of this illness. Biological abnormalities of
SAD include, in winter, increased duration and/or delay of
nocturnal
melatonin secretion,
blunted
norepinephrine,
cortisol, and prolactin response to challenge with the
non-selective
serotonin
receptor
agonist
m-CPP,
and
decreased rod sensitivity to light as measured by flash
electroretinography (Lavoie et al, 2009; Levitan et al, 1998;
Schwartz et al, 1997; Wehr et al, 2001). Vulnerability
markers include altered polymorphism frequencies for clock
genes NPAS and PER3, as well as a variable number tandem
repeat on exon 3 of the DRD4 gene (Johansson et al, 2003;
Levitan et al, 2006). Given the substantial burden of SAD, its
high prevalence, and the lack of knowledge regarding the
brain phenotypes of this disorder, there is a clear need to
identify neurochemical and neuropathological markers in
the central nervous system of SAD.
One strategy for selecting a target to investigate in SAD is
to choose a functionally relevant brain marker that is
sensitive to seasonal effects in healthy humans. Brain
markers influenced by season in health include greater
striatal L-Dopa uptake in the fall-winter, decreased 5-HT1A
receptor binding in limbic regions in winter, altered whole-
brain serotonin turnover, and greater 5-HTT BPND, an index
related to 5-HTT density, in the fall-winter as compared with
spring-summer (Buchert et al, 2006; Eisenberg et al, 2010;
Kalbitzer et al, 2010; Lambert et al, 2002; Ruhé et al, 2009;
Spindelegger et al, 2012; Praschak-Rieder et al, 2008). In
regards to seasonal variation of 5-HTT BPND, neuroimaging
studies of reasonably large sample size consistently report
this finding in a high proportion of brain regions sampled: a
[11C]DASB PET study of 88 subjects at Toronto, Canada,
found seasonal variation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND across

 all examined brain regions including the prefrontal cortex,
anterior cingulate cortex (PFC and ACC, respectively), and
hippocampus (Praschak-Rieder et al, 2008). Similarly, an
independent [11C]DASB PET study of 57 participants
at Copenhagen, Denmark found evidence of seasonal
fluctuation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in 3 of 4 brain
regions with significant change in the caudate and putamen,
a trend in the thalamus and no effect in the midbrain
(Kalbitzer et al, 2010). Two additional studies in Amsterdam,
Netherlands and Hamberg Germany, applying [123I]β-CIT
SPECT and [11C]McN5652 PET, respectively, investigated
the thalamus and midbrain and both found seasonal
variation in 5-HTT BPND in the midbrain (the Amsterdam
study included both healthy and non-SAD MDD patients)
(Buchert et al, 2006; Ruhé et al, 2009). The 5-HTT is also an
important target for controlling affect given that polymorph-
isms in the 5-HTT promoter are associated with risk toward
MDD, medications that affect the 5-HTT influence both
cognitive recall of emotionally valent material and negative
cognitive interpretations of life events; and that overexpres-
sion of 5-HTT in regions controlling affect are associated
with depressive behaviors in rodents (Caspi et al, 2010;
Harmer et al, 2004; Line et al, 2014; Meyer et al, 2003; Mouri
et al, 2012).
Given the consistency of seasonal change in 5-HTT BPND
in health and the importance of the role of 5-HTT in affect
regulation, the aim of the present study was to investigate
seasonal fluctuation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in SAD as
compared to health. We prioritized the PFC and ACC as
these regions had considerable seasonal variation in previous
study, contain structures with key roles in mood regulation
and cognitive processing of emotion, and are the regions for
which 5-HTT overexpression is associated with depressive
behaviors (Line et al, 2014; Mouri et al, 2012; Praschak-
Rieder et al, 2008; Ressler and Mayberg, 2007).
The first hypothesis was that the magnitude of seasonal
variation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in the PFC and ACC
would be greater in SAD as compared to health. The second
hypothesis was that seasonal variation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT
BPND in the PFC and ACC would be associated with severity
of SAD symptoms. The rationale for the second hypothesis is
that SAD is well known to be a dimensional illness with a
continuous distribution within health (such that 25% of
healthy individuals experience mild seasonal symptoms)
through to SAD of moderate to high severity (Bartko and
Kasper, 1989; Kasper et al, 1989; Rohan et al, 2011); and in
MDD the magnitude of brain biomarker abnormalities is
often correlated with severity, reflecting that MDD is a
complex neuropsychiatric illness for which any individual
pathology is more likely to present when MDD is more
severe (Chiuccariello et al, 2014; Deschwanden et al, 2011;
Fujita et al, 2012; Meyer, 2012; Sanacora et al, 2004; Setiawan
et al, 2015).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants
Twenty SAD participants (14 women and 6 men; mean [SD]
age: 31.3 [4.8] years; age range: 24–39) and twenty healthy
volunteers (13 women and 7 men; mean [SD] age: 30.5 [4.2]
years; age range: 24–39) were recruited from the Greater
Toronto Area between June 2012 and July 2015. Healthy
subjects were age-matched to SAD subjects within 3 years.
Demographics are listed in Table 1.
Criteria for all included being age 18–40, non-smoking and
in good physical health, no history of alcohol or substance
abuse, no antidepressant use within the past 6 months, and
no use of prescription medications or herbal supplements
within the past 2 months. In addition, as light exposure has
been found to reduce [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND during the
winter months and [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND has been shown
to be inversely correlated with duration of daily sunshine,
both use of light therapy within the past 3 months and travel
to more southern latitudes during the study period were
exclusionary (Harrison et al, 2015; Praschak-Rieder et al,
2008). Exclusion criteria for female subjects included the use
of oral contraceptives, current pregnancy, postpartum or
recent abortion (within one year), and in perimenopause or
menopause. Subjects were asked not to take over the counter
medications 1 week before scanning, to avoid alcohol 4 days
before scanning, and not to consume caffeinated beverages
within 2 days of the PET scan. In addition, lifetime history of
Axis I or Axis II disorders was exclusionary for healthy
subjects,
and
comorbid
Axis
I
or
Axis
II
disorders
were exclusionary for SAD subjects. Screening instruments

 included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR
(SCID-I/II); and all SAD subjects received a consultation
with a psychiatrist (JHM or RDL) to verify diagnosis. Urine
drug screening was performed at initial assessment and on
each PET scanning day to rule out recent drug and
medication use. Urine toxicology was performed using gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the CAMH
clinical laboratory (drug screening sensitive to ethanol, drugs
of abuse, all classes of antidepressants, antipsychotics,
anticonvulsants,
benzodiazepines,
narcotics,
NSAIDs,
anthelmintics, statins, β-blockers, muscle relaxants, and
anti-allergy medications).
Participants also completed the Seasonal Pattern Assess-
ment Questionnaire (SPAQ) from which a summed global
seasonality score (SPAQ GSS) was calculated to determine
the degree of seasonality (ie, seasonal change in sleep, mood,
energy, appetite, weight, and social activity) (Rosenthal et al,
1984b). The SPAQ was administered in randomized order in
accordance
with
the
season
in
which
subjects
were
scanned (summer: 10 healthy, 8 SAD; winter: 10 healthy,
12 SAD; χ(1)
2 = 0.40, p = 0.53). Subjects were defined cate-
gorically as healthy (with no seasonality) for SPAQ scores
below 12, moderate SAD for scores between 12 and 16, and
severe SAD for scores equal to or greater than 16 (Bartko and
Kasper, 1989). All healthy participants had SPAQ scores of
less than 7 (mean [SD]: 2.1 [1.7], range 0–6, Table 1). On
each scan day, the Structured Interview Guide for the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with Seasonal Affective
Disorder Supplement (SIGH-SAD) was also administered.
For each participant, written informed consent was obtained
after the procedures were fully explained. The study and
recruitment procedures were approved by the Research
Ethics Board for Human Subjects at the Centre for Addiction
and Mental Health, University of Toronto.
Scanning
All participants underwent two [11C]DASB PET and MRI
scans: one in spring-summer and the other in fall-winter, in
randomized order, to measure the seasonal percent change in
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND. Scan dates of healthy controls were
matched to SAD participants within 4 weeks. To minimize any
potential effects of circadian rhythm, all scans were scheduled
in the morning and took place at either 0930 h or 1130 h. All
participants were non-smoking and on each PET scan day
underwent laboratory tests (plasma sampling for cotinine,
calcium and thyroid hormones, complete blood cell count) to
verify non-smoking status and ensure physical health.
Synthesis of [11C]DASB has been described previously
(Ginovart et al, 2001; Wilson et al, 2000). Briefly, [11C]-CH3I
was trapped in a high-performance liquid chromatography
sample loop coated with a solution of the N-normethyl
precursor (1 mg) in dimethylformamide (80 μl). After 5 min
at ambient temperature, the contents of the sample loop were
injected
onto
a
reverse-phase
high-performance
liquid
chromatography column, and the fraction containing the
product was collected, evaporated to dryness, formulated in
saline, and filtered through a 0.2-μ filter. Before each scan, an
intravenous bolus of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of [11C]DASB was
injected. The [11C]DASB was of high radiochemical purity
(98.10 ± 5.16%) and high specific activity (65.62 ± 26.36 GBq/
μmol) at the time of injection. PET images were obtained
using a high-resolution PET/CT Siemens-Biograph HiRez
XVI scanner (81 axial sections of 2 mm; Siemens Molecular
Imaging, Knoxville, TN). The emission scan was recon-
structed in 15 frames of 1 min, followed by 15 frames of
5 min, totaling to a scan duration of 90 min in length. The
images were corrected for attenuation using a germanium
68-labeled transmission scan and reconstructed using 2D
filtered back projection algorithms with a ramp filter.
Subsequent to the initial PET scan, each participant also
underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan (GE 3.0-T
scanner, fast spin echo –XL sequence, proton density-
weighted image, x, y, and z voxel dimensions; 0.37, 0.37,
and 0.90 mm, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI).
Regions of interest (ROIs) on the MRI were determined
using a semi-automated method in which regions of a
template MRI are transformed onto the individual MRI
based on a series of transformations and deformations that
matched the template image to the individual co-registered
MRI, as well as segmentation of the individual MRI to
select gray-matter voxels as previously described (Meyer
et al, 2009; Rusjan et al, 2006). ROIs on the MRI were
subsequently located on the PET image using the rigid body
transformations from co-registration of the MRI to PET
image via a mutual information algorithm. ROIs included
the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, ventral
striatum, dorsal caudate, dorsal putamen, thalamus, hippo-
campus, midbrain, and cerebellar cortex. The location of the
ROIs was verified by visual assessment of their display on
the integral [11C]DASB PET image. The cerebellar cortex
reference region was defined as the posterior half of the
cerebellar cortex, excluding the vermis and cerebellar white
matter. Reference tissue methods have been validated for
[11C]DASB to calculate [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND (Ginovart
et al, 2001; Ichise et al, 2003). We applied the non-invasive
Logan method, which has a modest underestimate, but the
advantage of having the lowest coefficient of variation
(ie, standard deviation/mean) of calculated BPND values
(Logan et al, 1996). An additional analysis was conducted
using the simplified reference tissue method 2 (SRTM2),
which has a negligible underestimate but a higher coefficient
of variation (Wu and Carson, 2002). Test-retest variability of
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND values using the non-invasive
Logan method have been reported to have a mean regional
change of 0% with a standard deviation of ± 4.75% in the
prefrontal cortex, ± 3.7% in the anterior cingulate cortex,
± 1.6% in the bilateral caudate, ± 2.6% in the bilateral
putamen, ± 2.5% in the thalamus, and ± 0.3% in the
midbrain/superior raphe nuclei, with similar results obtained
using the SRTM2 method (Praschak-Rieder et al, 2005).
Statistical Analyses
Seasonal percent change in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND (% Δ
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND) was calculated in each region for
each subject [(winter [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND − summer
[11C]DASB
5-HTT
BPND)/summer
[11C]DASB
5-HTT
BPND)] and, as one value pertaining to a severe SAD case
was slightly outside the normal distribution, non-parametric
tests were used for all statistical analyses. The % Δ [11C]
DASB 5-HTT BPND in the PFC and ACC was compared
between SAD and healthy groups using the Mann–Whitney
U-test. To assess the relationship of % Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT
Season and serotonin transporter binding in SAD

Neuropsychopharmacology
 BPND to severity, the primary method was to categorize SAD
into two groups, moderate and severe, applying a cutoff of
greater than 16 on the SPAQ as previously described (Bartko
and Kasper, 1989). To determine whether a difference was
present among healthy, moderate SAD, and severe SAD
groups, the Kruskal–Wallis H-test was applied to assess % Δ
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in the PFC and ACC, and then the
Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare healthy with
severe SAD. As a secondary approach, all analyses were
applied in the other ROIs.
As an additional analysis, the effect of severity of SAD upon
seasonal change in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND was investigated.
Seasonal change in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND (Δ [11C]DASB 5-
HTT BPND) was calculated for each participant (winter [11C]
DASB 5-HTT BPND− summer [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND). To
determine whether a difference was present among healthy,
moderate SAD, and severe SAD groups, the Kruskal–Wallis
H-test was applied to assess Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in the
PFC and ACC and other examined regions, followed by the
Mann–Whitney U-test to compare healthy with severe and
moderate SAD groups. The Kruskal–Wallis H-test was also
used to determine whether [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND values
differed across groups in winter and in summer.
Further assessments of the relationship to severity of
symptoms were to determine the Spearman correlation
coefficients between % Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in the
PFC and ACC and seasonal depressive symptoms, as
measured by the SPAQ. These correlations were also
determined for other ROIs. Finally, as an exploratory analysis,
Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the
relationship between Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND and seasonal
depressive symptoms in all brain regions assayed.

(Mann–Whitney U, U = 126.5 and 114.0, p = 0.046 and

was a main effect of group (healthy, moderate SAD, and
severe SAD) upon seasonal fluctuation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT
BPND
in
the
PFC
and
ACC
(Kruskal–Wallis

χ(2)
2 = 8.82, p = 0.01 and χ(2)
2 = 9.62, p = 0.008, respectively,
Figure 1 and Table 3). Similar findings were present across
other ROIs (χ(2)
2 = 7.01–10.45, p = 0.005–0.03, Figure 1 and
Table 3), excepting the hippocampus in which a trend-level
effect was observed (χ(2)
2 = 5.26, p = 0.07; Figure 1 and
Table 3). These findings were primarily explained by greater
seasonal % Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in the PFC and ACC
of severe SAD cases relative to healthy volunteers (Mann–
Whitney
U,
U = 42.5
and
37.0,
p = 0.005
and
0.003,
respectively, Figure 1 and Table 3), an effect also observed
in other ROIs (U = 40.0–62.0, p = 0.004–0.048, Figure 1 and
Table 3), excepting the midbrain for which seasonal % Δ
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND was significantly greater across all
SAD participants relative to healthy volunteers (U = 96.0,
p = 0.005; Figure 1 and Table 2). In contrast, seasonal % Δ
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in moderate SAD subjects was
similar to healthy individuals with no difference in any
ROI
(Mann–Whitney
U,
U = 51.0–106.0,
p = 0.07–0.96;
Figure 1 and Table 3). Seasonal % Δ 5-HTT BPND was
consistent within individuals across brain regions (Cron-
bach’s alpha, α = 0.89).
Seasonal % Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND measured applying
the SRTM2 was similar to that of the non-invasive Logan
method (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = 0.93–0.98,
po0.0001, across regions) and yielded similarly consistent
main results.
Effect of SAD and Severity Category on Δ [11C]DASB
5-HTT BPND
The effects of SAD and severity on Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT
BPND were consistent with those on % Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT
BPND. A main effect of group was observed on Δ [11C]DASB
5-HTT BPND in the PFC and ACC (Kruskal–Wallis H-test,
χ(2)
2 = 8.32, p = 0.016 and χ(2)
2 = 9.00, p = 0.01, respectively)
and across other ROIs (χ(2)
2 = 6.45–10.56, p = 0.005–0.04).
These findings were similarly driven by increased Δ [11C]
DASB 5-HTT BPND of severe SAD cases relative to healthy
volunteers (Mann–Whitney U, U = 38.5–52.5, p = 0.003–
0.018) with no difference in Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND
values upon comparison of moderate SAD and healthy
groups
(U = 60.0–108.0,
p = 0.16–0.91,
Supplementary
Figure S2). In comparison with healthy and moderate SAD
groups, mean regional [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND values of
severe SAD cases were greater in fall-winter by 0–7.89% and
lower in spring-summer by 11.47–20.83%; however, these
differences were not statistically significant (Kruskal–Wallis
H-test, fall-winter: χ(2)
2 = 0.01–1.59, p = 0.45–0.99; spring-
summer:

p = 0.08–0.45,

correlation coefficient, ϼ = 0.52, p = 0.018) and trend level in
the ACC (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, ϼ = 0.42,
p = 0.07). Similar relationships were observed in other
examined brain regions (ϼ = 0.44–0.55, p = 0.012–0.055),
with the exception of the midbrain, in which no significant
correlation was observed (ϼ = 0.25, p = 0.29; Table 4). How-
ever, in healthy participants, for which the range in SPAQ
GSS scores was narrow, no significant correlations were
observed between seasonal % Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND
and SPAQ GSS in any brain region (ϼ = − 0.18–0.36,
p = 0.12–0.92; Table 4). Correlations between SPAQ scores
and Δ [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in SAD and healthy groups
were comparable to those of seasonal % Δ [11C]DASB
5-HTT BPND in all examined brain regions (Supplementary
Figure S3, Supplementary Table S6).
In SAD, post hoc exploratory analyses comparing a
breakdown of the GSS by mood, energy, and appetite

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to investigate seasonal change in [11C]
DASB 5-HTT BPND in SAD. Although greater seasonal
variation of [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in SAD as compared to
health was observed across most brain regions sampled,
including the PFC and ACC, the strongest finding was a
more pronounced seasonal fluctuation of [11C]DASB 5-HTT
BPND in severe SAD across all brain regions relative to
moderate SAD and asymptomatic healthy groups. These
results indicate that 5-HTT BPND, as measured with [11C]
DASB PET, is detecting a brain phenotype of SAD and
suggests new opportunities for applying this neuroimaging
method in biomarker-based approaches to develop new
strategies for both prevention and treatment.
Greater seasonal fluctuation of [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND
across all examined brain regions, including the PFC and
ACC, has important implications for SAD pathophysiology,
particularly in regards to severe SAD. [11C]DASB has a
strong preferential binding to 5-HTT on the cell surface
where functional 5-HTT are located and the binding of [11C]
DASB is insensitive to competition by endogenous serotonin
as demonstrated by the lack of effect of physiologically
tolerable serotonergic manipulations in humans, such as

Open (healthy, n = 20) and grey (moderate SAD, n = 9) and black (severe SAD, n = 11) triangles represent individual subject % Δ 5-HTT BPND. Black bars

healthy; Mann–Whitney U, U = 42.5 and 37.0, p = 0.005 and 0.003, respectively; greater magnitude in severe SAD of 35.10% and 14.23%, respectively) with
similar findings observed in other regions (U = 40.0–62.0, p = 0.004–0.048; greater magnitude in severe SAD of 13.16–17.49%). To compare groups, the
Kruskal–Wallis H-test was also applied at each region of interest. ap-value ⩽ 0.005; bp-value ⩽ 0.01; cp-value ⩽ 0.05. Seasonal % Δ 5-HTT BPND was consistent

 acute tryptophan depletion (Praschak-Rieder et al, 2005;
Quelch et al, 2012; Talbot et al, 2005). As such, the changes
in 5-HTT BPND observed in vivo using [11C]DASB PET
reflect greater availability of the 5-HTT to clear serotonin
from extracellular space in the winter, thereby lowering levels
of extracellular serotonin. This is a key issue, given that
overexpression of 5-HTT in the PFC is associated with
decreased stimulation-induced release of 5-HT from seroto-
nergic neurons and differential expression of the 5-HTT is
associated with magnitude of response to anxiogenic stimuli
(Jennings et al, 2010; Lesch et al, 1996; Mouri et al, 2012). In
addition, while greater seasonal variation in [11C]DASB
5-HTT BPND was observed in severe SAD relative to health,
[11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND values did not differ across groups
in summer and winter seasons, suggesting that, in SAD,
change across seasons is more relevant than the [11C]DASB
5-HTT BPND levels, themselves. Taken together, these
findings suggest that across the shift from summer to winter,
seasonal change in 5-HTT levels and/or affinity may alter the
dynamics of extracellular 5-HT release within the PFC, ACC,
and subcortical structures thereby dysregulating systems
adversely affected in severe SAD, including mood, energy,
and appetite.
Identifying a new brain biomarker in SAD is critical for
therapeutic advances because brain biomarkers are an
essential
guide
for
developing
treatments
of
complex
neuropsychiatric
illnesses
with
multiple
phenotypes.
Although it is well accepted that novel therapeutics require
target engagement, it is a newer direction in therapeutic
development to assess the effects of treatment on the target
biomarker itself. Knowledge that the biomarker has been
engaged then allows for assessment of whether an adequate
number of phenotypes have been targeted in clinical trials
with symptom burden as the primary outcome. In the
present investigation, the biomarker identified provides
opportunities to create novel prevention methods for SAD:
it is clear that the environmental combination of seasonal
variables,
including
light,
temperature,
and
humidity,
influence [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in those with severe
SAD. Future studies could identify combinations of specific
environmental factors and their exposure thresholds that
induce seasonal change in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND so that
by staying below such thresholds or adding other preventa-
tive interventions, such as light therapy, the winter elevation
in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND could be avoided. Avoidance of
environmental qualities and exposure thresholds that induce
seasonal fluctuations in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND could then
be incorporated into larger scale clinical studies as preven-
tion strategies in high-risk communities, such as those
in Northern latitudes where SAD prevalence exceeds 6%
(Magnusson, 2000).
There are some limitations of this study typical of SAD
investigations and human brain studies of neuropsychiatric
disease. First, it was not always possible to scan SAD
participants when their winter MDE was at its most severe.
As such, completion of winter scanning before the sympto-
matic nadir may have underestimated the strength of the
relationship between severity of SAD and seasonal % Δ [11C]
DASB 5-HTT BPND. Second, exposure to different seasonal
environmental influences are highly inter-correlated and
does not allow for the differentiation of their individual
effects. Third, while [11C]DASB has strong preferential
binding to 5-HTT on outer cell membranes, 5-HTT BPND
is a measure of both 5-HTT density and its affinity for [11C]
DASB (Quelch et al, 2012). Thus, it is not possible to
differentiate between changes in 5-HTT density and affinity,
although it would be expected that when the affinity of the
serotonin transporter is altered there is a similar functional
effect on the dynamics of extracellular serotonin concentra-
tions. Finally, as our approach was to determine whether the
severity of SAD was related to seasonal change in [11C]DASB
5-HTT BPND, we deliberately chose healthy volunteers with
negligible severity of seasonal symptoms for comparison

 with SAD subjects with more extreme symptoms, and this
may have reduced our ability to detect seasonal differences in
healthy subjects (see Supplementary Discussion for further
explanation). Since
25% of
healthy
people
experience
seasonal
variation
in
mood
symptoms,
an
additional
interesting future direction would be to assess % Δ [11C]
DASB 5-HTT BPND in a group of healthy subjects with
substantial seasonality to further characterize this brain
phenotype (Kasper et al, 1989).
In summary, this is the first investigation to compare
seasonal variation in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND in SAD
participants, across a spectrum of illness severity, to a group
of healthy volunteers, asymptomatic for seasonal changes in
mood and behavior. The primary finding is that, across brain
regions sampled, including the PFC and ACC, [11C]DASB
5-HTT
BPND
was
significantly
elevated
in
winter
as
compared
to
summer
in
SAD,
particularly
in
severe
SAD. Given that [11C]DASB binds preferentially to the
5-HTT on the cell surface, this has important pathophysio-
logical implications for the dynamics of serotonin release and
is best interpreted as reflecting a key phenotype of SAD
(Quelch et al, 2012). As a brain biomarker, greater seasonal
% change in [11C]DASB 5-HTT BPND is an important
breakthrough because it can be applied to develop interven-
tions to reduce environmental impact on this target and
create very specific prevention strategies for SAD.
