Physical fitness (PF) is a construct of health- and skill-
related
attributes
which
have
been
associated
with
academic performance (AP) in youth. This study aimed to
review the scientific evidence on the association among
components of PF and AP in children and adolescents. A
systematic review of articles using databases PubMed/
Medline, ERIC, LILACS, SciELO, and Web of Science
was undertaken. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
examining the association between at least one component
of PF and AP in children and adolescents, published
between 1990 and June 2016, were included. Independent
extraction of articles was carried out by the two authors
using predefined data fields. From a total of 45 studies
included,
25
report
a
positive
association
between
components of PF with AP and 20 describe a single
association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and
AP. According to the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines: 12 were
classified as low, 32 as medium risk, and 1 as high risk of
bias. Thirty-one studies reported a positive association
between AP and CRF, six studies with muscular strength,
three studies with flexibility, and seven studies reported a
positive association between clustered of PF components
and AP. The magnitude of the associations is weak to
moderate (b = 0.10–0.42 and odds = 1.01–4.14). There is
strong evidence for a positive association between CRF
and cluster of PF with AP in cross-sectional studies; and
evidence
from
longitudinal
studies
for
a
positive
association between cluster of PF and AP; the relationship
between muscular strength and flexibility with AP remains
uncertain.
Physical fitness (PF) is operationalized as a set of
measurable
health-
and
skill-related
attributes
including cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscular
strength and endurance, body composition, flexibil-
ity, balance, agility, coordination, reaction time, and
power (Caspersen et al., 1985; American College of
Sports Medicine, 2010).
Besides the well-described association between PF
with a cluster of metabolic risk factors in children,
adolescents, and adults (Ruiz et al., 2006; Ortega
et al., 2008; Kvaavik et al., 2009; Zagout et al.,
2016), there is increasing evidence of an association
between PF and academic performance (AP) (Gris-
som, 2005; Chomitz et al., 2009). This could be due
to PF’s positive effects on cognitive function and
performance in attention tasks, or by its effects on
depression, stress, and sleep quality (Blumenthal
et al., 2009; Chang & Chen, 2015; Latorre et al.,
2015). Cognition and motor skills in children have
several
common
underlying
processes,
such
as
sequencing, monitoring, and planning which may
positively influence AP (Roebers & Kauer, 2009;
Van der Fels et al., 2015).
AP refers to a child’s success and performance in
school and can be measured by grade point averages,
as a cluster of achievement tests or, using specific
tests for reading or arithmetic skills, such as reading
speed, fluency and comprehension, and the ability to
solve logical/arithmetic problems (Donnelly et al.,
2016).
The components of PF with documented potential
for improving health are CRF, muscular strength,
and motor ability, each of which may have different
effects on the brain (Ruiz et al., 2009, 2011). CRF is
supposed to induces angiogenesis in the motor cortex
and increases blood flow, improving brain vascular-
ization which could affect cognitive performance
(Hillman et al., 2008). Muscular strength may alter
spinal motoneuron excitability and induce synapto-
genesis within spinal cord (Adkins et al., 2006). It is
probable that these adaptations in brain may be
mediated by physical activity (PA; Hillman et al.,

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd
 2008). Some studies have examined the association
of CRF and muscular strength with AP separately
(Aberg et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2010; Chen et al.,
2013; Coe et al., 2013) or clustered (Grissom, 2005;
Castelli et al., 2007; Chomitz et al., 2009). However,
the results are conflicting and have not been system-
atically reviewed until now. It has been postulated
that body composition is associated with AP (Sch-
wimmer et al., 2003; Huizinga et al., 2008). It is not
clear if AP can be directly mediated by fatness or if it
is influenced by factors associated with excessive fat-
ness, such as poor self-esteem (Fan et al., 2010), anx-
iety∕depression (Goldfield et al., 2010), teasing and
social rejection (Gunnarsdottir et al., 2011), poor
attendance in school classes (Pan et al., 2013), and
poor PF (Datar et al., 2004; Shore et al., 2008).
Keeley and Fox (2009) reviewed the impact of PA
and fitness on academic achievement and cognitive
performance in children and found a weak relation-
ship between PF (mainly CRF) and academic
achievement. It is important to note that only seven
studies were reviewed and a qualitative analysis of
the studies was not performed. Recently, Haapala
(2013) in a narrative review described a positive asso-
ciation between CRF and AP in children. However,
this review was not systematic and did not consid-
ered all components of PF. Therefore, the aim of this
systematic review was to examine the scientific evi-
dence on the associations between PF’s components
and AP in children and adolescents.
Materials and methods
This systematic review was reported according to the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses criteria (Moher et al., 2009).
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were considered for
this review. Eligible studies were as follows: (a) published in
English; (b) conducted among children and adolescents aged
<20 years; (c) those that reported an association between
CRF, muscle strength or endurance (assessed either field tests
or in a laboratory), flexibility and AP (assessed by objective
measures, such as, grade point average, standardized test
scores, and teacher rated achievement); and (d) published
prior to June 2016. Review articles, meta-analysis, validation
studies, conference abstracts, monographs, dissertations, the-
ses, commentaries, brief reports, and studies conducted with
special populations, such as children or adolescents with
developmental disabilities, developmental delays or cognitive
impairment were not included.
Search methods for identification of studies
A two-phase search strategy was used to identify potential
studies. First, five electronic data bases were systematically
searched: PubMed/Medline, ERIC, LILACS, SciELO, and
Web of Science. The search for descriptors and terms was
performed with the MeSH – Medical Subject Headings,
through the portal of the U.S. National Library of Medicine
and DeCS – Descriptors in Health Science from the database
Virtual Health Library (Biblioteca Virtual da Sa�
ude- BVS).
Search strategies included the combination of variations
between two groups of key-words/terms including, but not
limited to the following examples: (a) PF (“physical fitness,”
“physical endurance,” “cardiorespiratory fitness,” “physical
conditioning,” “muscular strength,” “muscular endurance,”
“muscular resistance,” flexibility, pliability); and (b) AP (“aca-
demic achievement,” “academic performance,” “school per-
formance,” “educational status” and “attendance school”).
Terms were combined using the logical operators available as
search tools. A detailed description of the Pubmed/Medline
search is shown in Appendix. The search strategy was adapted
for the other databases.
In the second phase, the titles and abstracts for potentially
relevant articles were screened by two researchers (CCA and
LPA). Afterward, a full copy of the papers was obtained for
those that met the initial screening criteria and then were fully
examined by two researchers. If the two reviewers were unable
to reach a consensus a third researcher (WLP) was consulted.
Furthermore, we examined references cited by each of these
articles in an attempt to identify other potential studies for
inclusion.
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from all eligible articles: (a)
year of publication, (b) study design, (c) location, (d) sample
size, (e) age, (f) school year (grades), (g) main outcomes (PF
components and AP), (h) the main finding and (i) control vari-
ables including socioeconomic status (SES), educational level
of parents, PA level, health status, and others.
Risk of bias
The risk of bias within studies was assessed using the adapted
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology statement according to Lubans et al. (2010). A
score of 0 (absent or inadequately described) or 1 (present and
explicitly described) was assigned to each of the following
questions: (a) Does the study describe the eligibility criteria
for participant selection? (b) Are participants randomly cho-
sen from the population? (c) Does the study report the sources
and details of the method for measuring AP and did the
instrument have acceptable reliability? (d) Does the study
report the sources and details of the assessment methods for
measuring obesity and did the instrument have acceptable reli-
ability? (e) Does the study report the power calculation and
use a statistical method that is adequate to test the hypothesis?
(f) Does the study report the number of participants for each
outcome measurement and does this number represent at least
80% of the total sample?
A score for each article ranged from zero to six points.
Studies with ≤2 were considered high risk of bias, studies that
achieved 3–4 points were classified as medium risk and those
that had scores of 5–6 were classified as low risk of bias. Two
independent researchers performed the quality assessment
(CCAS and LPA), and disagreements were solved by the lead
researcher (WLP).
The judgment of overall scientific evidence was based on
Lubans et al. (2010) using the percentage of studies that
reported statistically significant relationship but also taking
into account the risk of bias: (a) No Association, if less than
33% of the studies indicate a significant association between
2

 variables; (b) Uncertain association, if 34–59% of the studies
indicate a significant association between variables; (c) Posi-
tive (or negative) association, if 60–100% of the studies indi-
cated a significant association (in the same direction); (d)
Strong evidence of positive (or negative) association, if 60–
100% of the studies indicated a significant association
between variables (in the same direction) and more than 59%
of the studies deemed low risk of bias (score ≥5) found a
significant association.
Results
Study selection
The initial search identified a total of 1404 potential
papers.
After
adjusting
for
duplicates,
1369
remained. Of these, 1315 studies did not meet the cri-
teria after examination of the title and abstract. The
full texts of the 54 remaining papers were examined.
Reference tracking identified two additional studies
(Kantomaa et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2014), result-
ing in total of 56 papers. Of these, 11 studies did not
meet the inclusion criteria. Two papers did not use
an objective measure for AP (Padilla-Moledo et al.,
2012; Raine et al., 2013). Two papers were con-
ducted in adults (Saavedra et al., 2008; Valkeinen
et al., 2013). One paper was a meta-analysis (Fedewa
& Ahn, 2011). Two papers were commentaries (Fei-
den, 2011; Hupert, 2015). Three were dissertations
(Hanna,
2009;
Hannigan,
2010;
Mobilia-Jones,
2010). One paper was published in Spanish (Cumillaf
et al., 2015). Therefore, 45 studies met all inclusion
criteria and were included in this systematic review
(Fig. 1).
Characteristics of included studies
Table 1 shows that 77.8% of the studies had a cross-
sectional design, 22.2% had prospective design and
51.1% of the studies were conducted in the United
States.
Risk of bias assessment indicated that a single
study (2.2%) was classified as high risk (Du Toit
et al., 2011), 32 (71.1%) as medium risk (Kim et al.,
2003; Castelli et al., 2007; Chomitz et al., 2009; Eve-

For the younger cohort, students who go on to
pass in physical fitness tests and students
who fail in the first year but pass in the
second have higher math scores in the fourth
grade compared to students who go on to fail
both tests (b = 0.244; P = <0.001 and
b = 0.147; P = <0.01, respectively). Similarly,
both these 2 groups of students have
significantly higher scores on the reading than
those who fail both tests (b = 0.115;
P = <0.05 and b = 0.129; P = <0.05,
respectively). For the older cohort, an initial
CST gap is present between those passing and
failing both tests (b = 0.218; P = <0.001 in
math, b = 0.154; P = <0.01 in reading).
Models that focus on the most challenging of
the tests-the mile run and the push-up test
and find no conclusive evidence that one of
these tests, rather than the combination of all
of them, is responsible for the link with
academic achievement. There were no
associations between BMI and academic
performance

In 6th, Muscular strength and endurance were
significantly associated with performance in
math (r = 0.149; P = <0.001), English (0.106;
P = <0.001), and social studies (r = 0.144;
P = <0.001). However, compared with all
other variables, SES had the strongest
association with academic achievement in 6th
and 9th, respectively (r = 0.183–0.324;
P = <0.05). Regression analysis yielded
similar results, with SES accounting for a large
portion of the variance in standardized test
percentiles (18.6–32.2%; P = <0.001). This
was true for all subject areas in all grades,
except for Math in ninth-grade students. In
this group, curl-ups were the best predictor of
academic achievement (accounting for 20.9%
of the variance; P = <0.001), but SES was
also significant in this model (accounting for
6.2% of the variance; P = <0.001)

the end of their academic
year, in math, language
(Portuguese), foreign
language (English) and
sciences. Student marks
range from 1 to 5 (very
poor to very good)
Gender, weight status,
and different cohorts
CRF and weight status were independently and
combined related to academic achievement
independent of the different cohorts. The odds
of having high or average academic
achievement vs low academic achievement of
normal weight students was higher than
overweight in both unadjusted (OR = 4.98; CI:
2.53–9.81) and adjusted analysis (OR = 3.72;
CI: 1.85–7.49). Fit students, compared with
unfit students, had higher odds for having a
high academic achievement, in both the
unadjusted (OR = 2.27; CI: 1.57–3.26), and
adjusted model (OR = 2.27; CI: 1.46–3.52)

CRF was related to AP in both genders
independent of potential confounders.
However, these associations did not remain
significant after adjusting for screen time. CRF
was positively associated with language
(b = 0.272, CI = 0.658–2.365, b = 0.153;
CI = 0.048–1.885 in boys and girls,
respectively) and mean academic attainment
(b = 0.192; CI = 0.021–0.210, b = 0.156,
CI = 0.049–0.251 in boys and girls,
respectively), however, after adjusting by
screen time these associations disappeared

Reporting how participants were randomly chosen
from the population was the main limiting factor in
terms of risk of bias, a criterion that only eight
(17.8%) studies fulfilled (Dwyer et al., 2001; Kim
et al., 2003; Kwak et al., 2009; Lambourne et al.,
2013; Hansen et al., 2014; Sardinha et al., 2014,
2016; Kalantari & Esmaeilzadeh, 2016). This was fol-
lowed by reporting statistical power as only 13
(28.9%) studies fulfilled this criterion (Dwyer et al.,
2001; Kwak et al., 2009; Welk et al., 2010; Wittberg

Santana et al.
 All studies present acceptable standards of quality of
reliable measurement from both exposure and out-
come variables. However, no study fulfilled all crite-
ria to achieve the maximum quality score.
Participants
The sample size ranged from 42 to 2 550 114 stu-
dents. Participants were enrolled in 1st grade to
senior high school and aged from 6 to 18 years old.
Seven studies did not report the age of participants
(Blom et al., 2011; Wittberg et al., 2012; Coe et al.,
2013; Rauner et al., 2013; Bezold et al., 2014; Janak
et al., 2014; Pellicer-Chenoll et al., 2015). Studies
were conducted in both genders, except Kalantari
and Esmaeilzadeh (2016) which was conducted in
boys.
Dependent variable outcome: AP
AP was measured by standardized tests to assess
knowledge in reading, writing, mathematics, and
general knowledge in 37 studies (82.2%). Seven stud-
ies (16.7%) used measures of AP through by scores
given by the teachers (Kim et al., 2003; Kwak et al.,
2009; Chen et al., 2013; Kantomaa et al., 2013;
Kalantari & Esmaeilzadeh, 2016; Morita et al., 2016;
Sardinha et al., 2016). One study (2.4%) only uti-
lized a math test (Huang et al., 2015).
Independent variable outcomes
Ten studies (22.2%) used the FITNESSGRAM
test to assess body composition, CRF, muscular
strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility (Cas-
telli et al., 2007; Chomitz et al., 2009; Wittberg
et al., 2009; Blom et al., 2011; Du Toit et al.,
2011; London & Castrechini, 2011; Van Dusen
et al., 2011; Bass et al., 2013; Coe et al., 2013;
Bezold et al., 2014). Three studies (6.7%) utilized
the Alpha battery tests to asses CRF, agility, and
muscular
fitness
(Esteban-Cornejo
et al.,
2014;
Torrijos-Ni~
no
et al.,
2014;
Garc�
ıa-Hermoso,
2016). Thirty-seven studies (82.2%) examined the
association between CRF and AP, seven (15.6%)
looked
at
the
association
between
muscular
strength and AP, 10 studies (22.2%) between flex-
ibility and AP, and eight studies (17.8%) exam-
ined
the
association
between
PF
components
clustered and AP.
Twenty studies (44.4%) assessed only CRF (Kwak
et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2010; Welk et al., 2010;
Wittberg et al., 2010, 2012; Davis & Cooper, 2011;
Telford et al., 2012; Kantomaa et al., 2013; Lam-
bourne et al., 2013; Rauner et al., 2013; Haapala
et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2014; Janak et al., 2014;
Sardinha et al., 2014, 2016; Scudder et al., 2014;
Srikanth
et al.,
2014;
Chaddock-Heyman
et al.,
2015; Huang et al., 2015; Pindus et al., 2016).
Some studies also measured motor skills. Three
studies (6.7%) assessed motor proficiency (Du Toit
et al., 2011), static balance or manual dexterity
(Haapala et al., 2014), and motor ability (Esteban-
Cornejo et al., 2014) and 1 study added measures of
gross motor skills (Kantomaa et al., 2013).
Main results
According to established criteria of overall scientific
evidence (Lubans et al., 2010), 27/30 cross-sectional
studies (90%), and 4/7 longitudinal studies (57%)
report a positive association between CRF and AP
(Table 3). The results suggest strong evidence of pos-
itive associations between CRF and AP for cross-
sectional studies and uncertain evidence for longitu-
dinal ones.
Sixteen studies (35.5%) investigated the associa-
tion between muscular strength and AP, 5/14 cross-
sectional studies (35.7%), and 1/2 longitudinal stud-
ies (50%) reported a positive association between
muscular strength with AP. There is uncertain evi-
dence
about
the
association
between
muscular
strength and AP for both cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal studies. Ten studies focused on the associa-
tion between flexibility and AP (22.2%), 2/8 cross-
sectional studies (25%), and 1/2 longitudinal (50%)
described a positive association between flexibility
and AP. There is no evidence from cross-sectional,
and uncertain evidence for longitudinal association
between flexibility and AP. Eight studies (17.8%)
investigated the association between a clustered of
PF components and AP, from this, 4/5 cross-sec-
tional studies (80%) and 3/3 longitudinal studies
(100%) reported a positive association. For cross-
sectional studies there is a positive association
between cluster of PF and AP, for longitudinal stud-
ies there is a strong evidence of positive association
(Table 3).
Three studies found that the association between
CRF and AP is stronger in girls than boys. Eveland-
Sayers et al. (2009) verified that time in a 1-mile run
test was negatively associated with performance in
reading/language (r = �0.31) and math (r = �0.36)
in girls. Du Toit et al. (2011) found that relationship
between PF components and AP was stronger
among girls (CRF r = 0.63; knee push-ups r = 0.62;
wall sitting r = 0.54; strength total r = 0.62) than
boys (CRF r = 0.40; knee push-ups r = 0.45; wall sit-
ting r = 0.16; strength total r = 0.51). Van Dusen
et al. (2011) showed a higher effect size in the associ-
ation between CRF and reading skills in girls (effect
size = 0.27; CI: 0.25–0.29) compared to boys (effect
size = 0.17; CI: 0.15–0.19). A single study described
an
association
between
anaerobic

 flexibility with AP only in girls (Liao et al., 2013).
Four studies found no or weak association between
PF and CRF with AP after adjusting for SES, BMI,
motor performance, and screen time (Wingfield
et al., 2011; Haapala et al., 2014; Janak et al., 2014;
Aguilar et al., 2015). Kantomaa et al. (2013) did not
find a relationship between compromised motor
function in childhood, CRF, and AP in adolescents.
The association between PF with AP was assessed
by multivariate linear regression analyses in 21 stud-
ies (46.6%) (Dwyer et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003;
Castelli et al., 2007; Kwak et al., 2009; Roberts
et al., 2010; London & Castrechini, 2011; Wingfield
et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013; Coe et al., 2013; Liao
et al., 2013; Esteban-Cornejo et al., 2014; Greeff
et al., 2014; Haapala et al., 2014; Janak et al., 2014;
Srikanth et al., 2014; Aguilar et al., 2015; Huang
et al., 2015; Garc�
ıa-Hermoso, 2016; Kalantari &
Esmaeilzadeh, 2016; Morita et al., 2016; Pindus
et al., 2016), eight (17.8%) used logistic binomial
regression (Chomitz et al., 2009; Welk et al., 2010;
Blom et al., 2011; Bass et al., 2013; Sardinha et al.,
2014, 2016; Torrijos-Ni~
no et al., 2014; Desai et al.,
2015). Five (11.1%) studies utilized mixed models
regression (Van Dusen et al., 2011; Telford et al.,
2012; Lambourne et al., 2013; Rauner et al., 2013;
Bezold et al., 2014). One study (2.4%) utilized struc-
tural equation to test mediation (Kantomaa et al.,
2013), and one study (2.2%) used multilevel regres-
sion (Hansen et al., 2014). Three studies (6.6%) uti-
lized analyses of variance (Wittberg et al., 2009,
2012; Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2015). Four studies
(8.9%) did simple correlation (Eveland-Sayers et al.,
2009; Wittberg et al., 2010; Davis & Cooper, 2011;
Du Toit et al., 2011). One (2.2%) study utilized Stu-
dent’s t-test (Scudder et al., 2014), and one study
(2.2%) utilized the SOM equation (Pellicer-Chenoll
et al., 2015).
Few studies provided details of the statistical anal-
ysis, when using linear regression analysis and logis-
tic regression (Dwyer et al., 2001; Castelli et al.,
2007; Chomitz et al., 2009; Kwak et al., 2009; Lon-
don & Castrechini, 2011; Chen et al., 2013; Liao
et al., 2013; Esteban-Cornejo et al., 2014; Greeff
et al., 2014; Sardinha et al., 2014; Morita et al.,
2016; Pindus et al., 2016). Another important con-
sideration about the analysis was how the covariates
were incorporated in the final model. Considering
that the covariates are potentially related to one
another, only the study of Esteban-Cornejo et al.
(2014) performed the final model analysis using mul-
ticollinearity using variance inflation factors. Two
studies reported analysis of normal distribution of
error terms and outliers; however, the authors do not
report details of the analysis, such as, influence anal-
ysis of the fitted model, studentized residuals, Cook’s
Distance
and
distributions
of
unweighted
and
weighted models (London & Castrechini, 2011; Pin-
dus et al., 2016).
Most population-based studies showed an associa-
tion between PF and AP, and these findings can be
extrapolated to other populations due external valid-
ity. However, the magnitude and power of the results
were small in some studies (Dwyer et al., 2001;
Roberts et al., 2010; Welk et al., 2010; Blom et al.,
2011; Van Dusen et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2013; Rau-
ner et al., 2013; Bezold et al., 2014). Van Dusen
et al. (2011) with a sample size of 254 743 students
found an association between CRF and performance
in reading (effect size = 0.27) and performance in
math (effect size = 0.33) in girls, for boys the
reported effect size was 0.17 for reading and for
math 0.34, respectively. Liao et al. (2013) with size
sample of 149, 240 students verified that a 1 SD
increase on the anaerobic power and flexibility Z-
scores from high school in girls was associated with
an increase in the university entrance exam score by
0.018 and 0.010 SD, respectively. Dwyer et al. (2001)
found a very weak correlation between time to com-
plete the 50-m run (r = �0.15), sit-ups repetitions
(r = 0.14), and distance leaped in the standing long
jump (r = 0.10) and AP. Welk et al. (2010) with a
sample size of 36 835 students also found a weak
association between CRF and AP (OR = 1.014;
CI = 1.011–1.016), indicating that for each 1%
increase in CRF, AP increases.
Regarding studies with lower size sample, some
utilized direct measure to asses CRF and added
measures
of
cognition,
electroencephalographic,
and magnetic resonance imaging, which increases
the
internal
validity
of
the
studies
(Davis
&
Cooper,
2011;
Haapala
et al.,
2014;
Scudder
et al., 2014; Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2015; Pin-
dus et al., 2016). Although some studies did not
use more elaborate statistical tests due to limited
sample size, the authors found significant associa-
tions between CRF and performance in reading
(r = 0.29) and math (r = 0.25) (Davis & Cooper,
2011). Scudder et al. (2014) verified that more fit
children had greater reading achievement scores
(123.1 � 2.8)
compared
to
less
fit
children
(112.9 � 2.1), with a larger effect size d = 0.8. A
similar finding was observed for spelling (higher
fit: 117.6 � 2.6; lower fit: 108.0 � 3.0; d = 0.7).
Chaddock-Heyman
et al.
(2015)
reported
that
higher
fit
children
showed
decreased
cortical
thickness
in
the
superior
frontal
cortex
(3.76 � 0.15; d = 0.62), superior temporal cortex
(3.17 � 0.24; d = 0.64), and lateral occipital cor-
tex (2.46 � 0.10; d = 0.68) when compared with
lower
fit
children
(3.85 � 0.14;
3.11 � 0.18;
2.56 � 0.19),
respectively.
Therefore,
these
methodological discrepancies should be considered
when interpreting the results.

Physical fitness and academic performance
 Discussion
From this systematic review, we conclude that there
was
strong
evidence
for
a
positive
association
between CRF and AP in cross-sectional studies; a
positive association with the cluster of PF and AP;
and a strong evidence from longitudinal studies for a
positive association between cluster of PF and AP.
These results support the conclusion of a recent
review from Donnelly et al. (2016) demonstrating
cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between
PF, AP, and cognition in youth. However, those
authors state that these conclusions should be cau-
tiously interpreted as they are based on cross-sec-
tional, acute/short-term, nonrandomized trials and
from randomized trials with a high risk of bias.
Many of the studies had relatively small samples or
used correlational methodologies that cannot pro-
vide evidence of cause and effect. Because most of
the existing studies are cross-sectional or correla-
tional, there is a need for intervention studies to
determine whether this relationship is causal. If the
relationship is causal, there would be a strong reason
to promote PA in schools as a means of increasing
academic achievements.
The quality of existing studies was uneven and
future studies could be strengthened by longitudinal
research and follow-up assessments for RCT designs
to provide a better understanding of the longevity of
PF effects on cognition and academic achievement.
Although the best evidence will come from RCT
designs, in cases where cross-sectional data are still
collected, it is recommended that researchers study
the contribution of each component of PF on AP to
determine whether another component of PF is
really more important than other.
Most of the studies showed weak to moderate
associations between PF and AP; the magnitude ran-
ged from 0.10 (Kim et al., 2003) to 0.42 (Castelli
et al., 2007) and odds ratio from 1.01 (Welk et al.,
2010) to 4.14 (Blom et al., 2011). The magnitude of
the association might not be clinically meaningful at
individual level, but might be at population level.
This systematic review expands a previous review by
Keeley & Fox by including studies since 2009, and
by including a qualitative assessment of the studies.
We found 45 studies that met our criteria for inclu-
sion in the systematic review. Of these, 30 (66.6%)
with medium and low risk reported a positive associ-
ation between CRF with AP and seven studies that
measured PF as cluster found a positive association
between PF and AP.
PF has been associated with improvement in cog-
nitive function in children and better performance in
attention tasks. It is possible that those children who
have higher cognitive ability may have both better
AP and better PF compared to those with lower level
of cognitive ability (Hillman et al., 2005, 2009). This
may be related to parents’ cognitive ability and SES
(Tucker-Drob & Harden, 2012; Heberle & Carter,
2015), which are not taken into account in some
studies (Eveland-Sayers et al., 2009; Wittberg et al.,
2010, 2012; Du Toit et al., 2011; Pellicer-Chenoll
et al., 2015).
The mechanism of the association between AP and
CRF
remains
unclear.
It
is
hypothesized
that
improvements in CRF, as induced by changes in PA
levels, may have a positive influence on cognition
mediated by increased levels of brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor (BDNF) (Hillman et al., 2008). In a
systematic review, Knaepen et al. (2010) suggested
that the BDNF response to exercise is most probably
a phenomenon of what happens centrally, and exer-
cising regularly could induce central effects without
elevating peripheral basal BDNF concentration.
However, the association between CRF and AP
might be influenced by a number of confounding fac-
tors affecting CRF. Some studies reported an inverse
association between obesity and CRF (Pahkala
et al., 2013; D�
ıez-Fern�
andez et al., 2014), and others
suggested that due to growth and maturation the
relationship between these two variables might be
more complex in children and adolescents (Rowland,
2013). It has been reported that CRF and body fat
contribute equally to endurance performance in field
tests (Rowland et al., 1999).
The relationship between CRF and AP has been
investigated mainly by CRF field-based exercise tests
(Roberts et al., 2010; Welk et al., 2010; Wittberg
et al., 2010; Telford et al., 2012; Lambourne et al.,
2013; Rauner et al., 2013; Janak et al., 2014; Sar-
dinha et al., 2014, 2016; Srikanth et al., 2014; Huang
et al., 2015). There is evidence that the association
between CRF and AP might be protocol/test depen-
dent (Dwyer et al., 2001), however it’s suggested that
this association may be influenced by motor skills
and running efficiency (Haapala et al., 2014; Van
Der Niet et al., 2014) rather than CRF itself (Kan-
tomaa et al., 2011, 2013).
The different association between boys and girls
were also explored in a few studies. Kwak et al.
(2009) found that fitness was associated with AP in
boys but not in girls. On the other hand, others
reported strong associations in girls (Eveland-Sayers
et al., 2009; Du Toit et al., 2011; Van Dusen et al.,
2011; Liao et al., 2013).
Haapala et al. (2014)
reported that in girls maturation may, at least partly,
explain the relationships of shuttle run performance
and AP. Differences could be attributed to the age of
the subjects, such as, adolescents (Kwak et al., 2009;
Van Dusen et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2013), children
(Eveland-Sayers et al., 2009; Du Toit et al., 2011;
Haapala et al., 2014), or assessment of PF and sex
(Kalantari & Esmaeilzadeh, 2016).
20
Santana et al.
 Considering the results presented in this review,
studies are needed to develop effective strategies for
improving AP in school age children. Nevertheless,
education
professionals
are
under
pressure
to
improve the AP of students and historically, the
physical education classes are supposed to be less
valuable than other disciplines in an education set-
ting. As a result, many schools have reduced or
neglected children’s opportunities for PA at school
(Chaddock et al., 2010). Reductions in time devoted
to PA and an increased amount of time in sedentary
behaviors may not only affect weight status but
could also reduce PF, which could negatively affect
AP (Tokmakidis et al., 2006; Brunet et al., 2007;
Korsten-Reck et al., 2007; Cantell et al., 2008; Nevill
et al., 2009).
This study has some limitations that should be
considered. A literature search was performed only
in journals indexed in the electronic databases ERIC,
PubMed/Medline, LILACS, Web of Science and
SciELO. Therefore, it is possible that some studies
were not retrieved. Besides, the inherent limitations
of cross-sectional study designs, which were noted
the most in this review, preclude making definitive
conclusions regarding causality relating to the devel-
opment of AP and PF. Another important limitation
to consider is publication bias (e.g., studies which
found no association may not been published),
which might affect the findings of this review.
Finally, there was only a small proportion of the
studies (28.9%) meeting the criterion of estimating
statistical power.
In summary, the findings encourage carefully con-
trolled intervention studies to determine if increasing
PF could improve AP of students.
Perspectives
The present review aimed to examine the scientific
evidence on the association between PF and AP in
children and adolescents. On the basis of the results
of this review, we suggest the focus of future inter-
ventions should be directed at promoting PF in an
environment that is developmentally appropriate for
children and adolescents as this may be the most
advantageous path to promote overall functional
capabilities, as well as improvements on motor skill
due to gender-specific games, equipment, and spaces
(Hardy et al., 2012). Both PF and motor skill may
promote positive and sustainable trajectories of
health, cognition, and AP leading to long-term posi-
tive health outcomes.
