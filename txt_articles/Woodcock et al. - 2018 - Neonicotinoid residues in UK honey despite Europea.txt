Abstract
Due to concerns over negative impacts on insect pollinators, the European Union has imple-
mented a moratorium on the use of three neonicotinoid pesticide seed dressings for mass-
flowering crops. We assessed the effectiveness of this policy in reducing the exposure risk
to honeybees by collecting 130 samples of honey from bee keepers across the UK before
(2014: N = 21) and after the moratorium was in effect (2015: N = 109). Neonicotinoids were
present in about half of the honey samples taken before the moratorium, and they were
present in over a fifth of honey samples following the moratorium. Clothianidin was the most
frequently detected neonicotinoid. Neonicotinoid concentrations declined from May to Sep-
tember in the year following the ban. However, the majority of post-moratorium neonicotinoid
residues were from honey harvested early in the year, coinciding with oilseed rape flowering.
Neonicotinoid concentrations were correlated with the area of oilseed rape surrounding the
hive location. These results suggest mass flowering crops may contain neonicotinoid resi-
dues where they have been grown on soils contaminated by previously seed treated crops.
This may include winter seed treatments applied to cereals that are currently exempt from
EU restrictions. Although concentrations of neonicotinoids were low (<2.0 ng g-1), and posed
no risk to human health, they may represent a continued risk to honeybees through long-term
chronic exposure.
Introduction
Neonicotinoid pesticides are the most widely used class of insecticides and account for around
one third of the worldwide market [1]. They are most commonly applied as prophylactic seed
coatings on a wide variety of flowering (e.g. oilseed rape and sunflower) and non-flowering
(e.g. wheat and maize) crops [2, 3]. Their systemic expression in the tissues of plants provides
targeted protection against herbivorous pests, including those that show resistance to previ-
ously developed pesticides, such as pyrethroids [2, 3]. However, their systemic nature also

 means that neonicotinoids are found in the pollen and nectar of mass-flowering crops attrac-
tive to pollinating insects, including honeybees and wild bees [4, 5]. A considerable body of
recent research has linked this route of exposure to negative impacts on insect pollinators [4,
6–9]. These concerns have resulted in a European Union (EU) temporary moratorium on the
application of three classes of neonicotinoid seed treatments–imidacloprid, clothianidin and
thiamethoxam [10]. This restriction in the EU is for mass flowering crops (principally oilseed
rape and sunflower) and does not include winter sown cereals. This moratorium came into
effect for crops sown in the spring of 2014 and is still in place [10–12] (Table A in S1
Appendix).
Typically 2–20% of neonicotinoid seed coatings are absorbed into the germinating crop,
which leaves a potentially large proportion of the pesticides as residues in the soil [13]. Soil
degradation times of neonicotinoids are also highly variable, with DT50 (soil half-life) values
ranging from 200 to over 1000 days for clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid [5].
Both of these factors are likely to contribute to the identification of soil contamination follow-
ing the use of neonicotinoids on crops. For example, under typical field conditions concentra-
tions as high as 13.6 μg kg-1 were reported in arable soils before the moratorium [14]. There is
considerable potential for neonicotinoids to persist in soils, even after cessation of their use on
mass flowering crops [5, 13]. Where this occurs they may continue to be found in mass flower-
ing crops grown on the same soils, thus posing a risk of exposure for bees feeding on their pol-
len and nectar [5]. A further exposure pathway for pollinators is through drift of dust or
movement in surface water from cereal crops into field edges which can result in neonicoti-
noid residues being found in wild flowers and shrubs growing in these areas [5, 15–18].
Despite the EU moratorium on neonicotinoid seed dressing use in mass flowering crops,
there has been no systematic monitoring to determine how effective this has been in reducing
exposure risk to insect pollinators. We report the findings of a national survey of neonicoti-
noid residues found in honey collected in Great Britain. Honey samples were sourced from
amateur beekeepers both before (2014) and after (2015) the implementation of the EU morato-
rium on neonicotinoid use. The residues in honey were then related to the areas of both oilseed
rape, winter sown cereals and total arable cover that surrounded the sampled apiaries. We
hypothesized that: 1) residues of neonicotinoids would be detected in honey stored by honey-
bees at higher rates before the moratorium that after it; 2) following the moratorium residues
of neonicotinoids would be detected in honey as a result of bees foraging on flowering plants
grown on soils containing persisting neonicotinoid residues; 3) where these residues persisted
the most likely mechanism of exposure would be untreated mass flowering crops (oilseed
rape) sown into soils contaminated by previous neonicotinoid use [14, 15]. In line with
hypothesis 3), we predicted that despite the moratorium, residues of neonicotinoids in honey
would remain correlated with the area of oilseed rape (the principal mass flowering crop
grown in the UK) around each apiary.
Materials and methods
Honey samples
The use of stored hive products (pollen, nectar or honey) has been used to assess exposure
risks to pesticides for honeybees [19–23]. This including a worldwide survey of neonicotinoid
residues [24]. Here we expand on this previous research by using similar approaches to quan-
tify neonicotinoid persistence following a ban on its use in mass flowering crops and linking
this exposure to local cropping patterns. Although large commercial apiaries produce the
majority of consumed honey in the UK, there are c. 24,000 amateur apiarists. Typically ama-
teur apiarists keep only one to five hives during a season with honey production for either

 personal consumption or small scale commerce. Honey samples were solicited from these
amateur apiarists from 23/2/2016 until 20/5/2016 through a request advertised in the newslet-
ter of The British Beekeepers Association as well as the “The Scottish Beekeeper” magazine.
The provision of honey samples was on an entirely voluntary basis and resulted in 122 apiarists
providing samples from one or more years from 2014 (N = 23), 2015 (N = 147). In all cases
postage costs were covered, although no direct payment was made to beekeepers. It should be
noted that the study was not designed to make inferences about the decision making process
for why beekeepers provided us with samples, which were likely specific to each individual.
The impact of such factors was beyond the scope of the current study, however, there is no a
priori reason to expect this to influence the results. The voluntary provision of honey samples
have been used to assess pesticide residues in previous studies [22, 24].
Each sample comprised blended honey originated from a harvest from a single location of
the supers (frames) of individual hives or hives (typically 2–3). Insufficient records are kept to
distinguish between honey samples originating from single or multiple hives. However within
a single site hives would be within 5–10 m of each other. Where honey was blended from hives
in several locations this was excluded from the analysis. Samples from 2012–2013 were ex-
cluded due both to their age and limited replication. Further samples were removed from the
data set where exact information could not be provided as to the location of the original hive
(for example where honey was amalgamated from hives in multiple locations). A small num-
ber of samples from Ireland were also excluded as they were outside of the geographical range
for spatial information on crop coverage. This resulted in a sub-set of 130 samples from indi-
vidual beekeepers (N2014 = 21, N2015 = 109). There was a good spatial distribution of samples,
with honey collected from over 20 counties (Fig 1).
The modal month of honey collection was August, although samples were collected from
May to September (Table B in S1 Appendix). It should be noted that while many beekeepers
regularly remove honey from hives through the season (to increases the total yield) this is not a
universal practice. It is possible that honey samples collected from periods after oilseed rape

 flowering ended may have included honey originating from while it was in flower [25]. For
this reason the harvest month reported for individual honey samples should be considered
only as an indication of the time of year when it was sourced.
Residue analysis
Samples of honey were analysed to quantify concentrations of clothianidin, thiamethoxam
(UKAS accredited ISO17025:2005 standards) and imidacloprid. In all cases honey had been
collected using normal bee keeping practice, whereby honey was spun from hive supers
(frames containing honey combs). This collected honey that was homogenized and stored for
subsequent human consumption. From this honey a 1.5 ml sub-sample was collected and
stored at -80˚C, although prior to this it was kept under conditions typical for food storage and
so not frozen.
Determination of the wet weight concentration of the three neonicotinoid compounds was
undertaken using liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole ‘Quantum Ultra TSQ’
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hemsptead; UK). This was interfaced
using an ion max electrospray ionisation (ESI). Analyte separation was performed on a Phe-
nomenex Synergi Fusion column (2.5 μm particle size, 50 mm x 2mm I.D., Phenomenex)
using a H2O:MeOH mobile phase gradient. In each case residues were compared to spiked
samples (0.1g) labelled with internal neonicotinoid standards (Thiamethoxam, Clothianidin,
Imidacloprid). Quantification of neonicotinoid residues were based on their respective re-
sponse factor to these internal standards. Chromatographic peaks were integrated using the
ICIS algorithm, which was also used to generate linear calibration curves based on a 1/X
weighting (R2>0.99). The performance of the method was assessed in terms of the limit of
detection (LoD = 0.38 ng g-1) and recovery of the internal standards for the analytes. The LoD
was derived as three times the signal to noise ratio including an assessment of the expanded
uncertainty of the method [26]. The LoQ (limit of quantification) was calculated as the LoD
plus the calculated expanded uncertainty of the method (LoQ = 0.53 ng g-1). Honey residue
that contained neonicotinoids above the limit of quantification were given a value equal to
their detected concentration. When honey samples contained residues below the limit of quan-
tification, but greater than the limit of detection they were allocated a fixed values equivalent
to the limit of detection (LoD = 0.38 ng g-1). We used this approach as within this range neoni-
cotinoid residues are detectable (i.e. above the LoD), but are at concentration too low to pro-
vide an exact residue value (i.e. below the LoQ). This approach follows the same principals as
that used in comparable studies looking at pesticide residues in honeybee colonies [19, 20, 22].
Residues below the limit of detection were considered to have a zero neonicotinoid residues,
although it is possible that some very low levels of neonicotinoids were present in the range of
0.0–0.38 ng g-1. It should be noted that neonicotinoid concentrations in honey would not be
the same as that found in the nectar (e.g. from oilseed rape or wild flowers) which the bees col-
lected and used to create it. When stored as honey the water content of nectar is reduced as
part of the preservation process. In addition, the mixing of contaminated and uncontaminated
nectar by bees may lead to the dilution of neonicotinoid residues in stored honey [27].
Agricultural land use as a predictor of neonicotinoid exposure risk
Oilseed rape is the principal mass flowering crop grown in the UK to which neonicotinoid
seed treatments have been applied and as such represents the most likely mechanisms through
which honeybees would be exposed to these pesticides before the EU moratorium [4, 6–8, 28,
29]. We focus on this crop as in addition to is dominant land cover it also provides a function-
ally homogenous mechanism of exposure in terms of flower type and broad levels of attraction

 to honeybees [30]. In 2014 (the final pre-moratorium year) a total of 674,580 hectares of oil-
seed rape (98% winter sown in 2013) were harvested in the UK. Of this 95.0% received some
form of seed treatment (including non-neonicotinoid products), with thiamethoxam (50.9%
of seed treated crop) and clothianidin (33.3% of seed treated crop) being the most frequently
used [31]. The use of imidacloprid in the UK had largely stopped by 2014, so that only 0.3% of
seed treated oilseed rape was treated with imidacloprid in this year [31]. With the exception of
small areas of experimentally treated crops [9], neonicotinoids were not applied as seed treat-
ments in 2015 to any mass flowering crop in the UK (Table A in S1 Appendix). None of these
areas were within 10 km of any of the collected honey samples. It should be noted that other
mass flowering crops are sown in the UK, although all are much less frequently grown than oil-
seed rape. For example field beans (Vicia faba) grown on only 3.0% of the cropped area [29].
Also, neonicotinoid seed treatments were applied only to oilseed rape and not field beans [27,
32].
While there is a reasonable expectation that residues of neonicotinoids in honey would be
predicted by the cover of oilseed rape in years prior to the EU moratorium (Table B in S1
Appendix, Fig A in S1 Appendix), the extent to which soil contamination resulted in post-
moratorium contamination of honey remains unclear. If neonicotinoids persist in soil there is
considerable potential that they may be found in untreated mass flowering crops growing on
land where seed treated crops were grown in previous years (including winter sown cereals).
To assess potential routes of exposure linked to arable land use, we correlated the summed res-
idues of all three neonicotinoid products (clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid) in
honey to the cover of oilseed rape, winter sown cereals and total arable crops. This was done
for honey samples from 2015 when the effective EU moratorium on neonicotinoid use in mass
flowering crops was in place.
To derive information on the cover of crops we used the 2015 CEH Land Cover Plus: Crops
map (NERC CEH) [33] in ESRI ArcGIS v10.4 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). This is the first high reso-
lution map of UK cropping, classifying c. two million land parcels based on the existing UK
Land Cover Map (LCM) (Fig 1). The minimum mapping unit for the crop map is represented
by 2 ha land parcels and is derived from a combination of Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR
(Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Sentinel-2 optical data. Using this map we assessed the cover
of oilseed rape, winter sown cereals and total arable crops for a 2 km radius surrounding the
location of hives from which a honey sample was provided. This radius reflects commonly
reported mean foraging ranges of honeybees, although they are capable of foraging over larger
distances [34, 35].
Statistical analysis
Honey samples where neonicotinoids residues did not exceeded the limit of detection
(LoD = 0.38 ng g-1) were considered to have zero neonicotinoid residues. The resulting residue
data was dominated by these zeroes (72.3% of values were non-detections), although was also
non-negative and continuous. The presence of zero-inflation was potentially the result of two
unquantified factors: 1) a lack of neonicotinoid residues as they were not present in the land-
scape or hive; or 2) a failure to detect residues that were present in the hive, but not the particu-
lar sub-sample of analysed honey, or those that were present but had degraded below the limit
of detection. Modelling such ‘zero-inflation’ is commonplace for discrete data, but has only
recently begun to be performed for continuous distributions [36, 37]. We analysed the zero-
inflated data using a Tweedie distribution [38] modeled within the package FishMod imple-
mented in R version 3.1.2 [32, 36, 39]. The method used a log link function to keep predicted
values above zero and extends the Tweedie distribution so that the expected value of the ith

 observation of the response (μi) predicted by the covariate (yi) is given by the below equations.

Where parameter a relates the neonicotinoid residue values to a vector X of appropriate
covariates. The additional parameters φ and p set the shape of the curve for 1<p<2 and result
in a Poisson mixture of gamma distributions that serves to produce the ‘spike’ at zero [36].
Within this framework we tested for the correlated response of the combined residues of all
three neonicotinoid products detected in honey (NNI = clothianidin + thiamethoxam + imida-
cloprid) to agricultural land uses. Three separate models considered the cover of oilseed rape
(a key foraging crop grown on soils likely to contain neonicotinoid residues), cover of winter
sown cereals (to which neonicotinoid seed treatments could have been applied in 2015) or
total arable cover (total land on which neonicotinoid seed treatments may have been used over
previous years). Strong correlations between the three agricultural land uses prevented their
inclusion in an overall additive model (Table C in S1 Appendix). In addition to the responses
to landscape, we also used the same approach to assess if combined neonicotinoid residues
changed in response to the month from which the honey was harvest in 2015. In each case we
use likelihood ratio tests with a χ2 test statistic to assess if the inclusion of the landscape struc-
ture explained variation in neonicotinoid residues by comparing μ = a0 + a1�X to an intercept
only model of μ = a0, where X = land use cover. To test for underlying spatial structure in the
data we performed a Moran’s I test of the raw neonicotinoid residue data. Goodness of fit was
also assessed by examination of model residuals. Due to the limited availability of samples
from the pre-moratorium year (2014: N = 21) we focus the analysis in the main paper on data
from the 2015 (N = 111) field season. This represents the first year of the neonicotinoid mora-
torium. However, for the 2014 analysis based on this limited data set see Fig A and Table C in
S1 Appendix. By separating the analysis into separate years we account for potential confound-
ing differences in the breakdown of neonicotinoid residues in the honey between 2014 and
2015.
Results
Effectiveness of the moratorium in reducing neonicotinoid residues in
honey
Overall 130 honey samples were analysed (N2014 = 21; N2015 = 109). The small number of sam-
ples from 2014 reflect the availability of honey stocks from older years relative to honey har-
vested in 2015 (Tables 1 & 2). A greater proportion of honey from 2014 had been sold for
consumption and so was not available for analysis. Following the moratorium, average con-
centrations of all neonicotinoid in contaminated honey samples declined through 2015 (χ2
4 =
31.9, p<0.001, Fig 2A), although combined median residues were only above zero in May of
that year (Table 1). Overall the concentrations of clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidaclo-
prid residues within honey were typically low and did not exceed 1.69 ng g-1 for any given
product. The combined residues of all three products did not exceeding 1.99 ng g-1 in a honey
sample in 2015. However, across the three products there was little difference in the maximum
residue concentration in the post moratorium period, with the values ranging from 1.41–1.69
ng g-1 (Table 1). The likelihood of honey containing neonicotinoid residues was higher before
the moratorium than after it, with 52.3% of samples from 2014 containing residues of either
clothianidin, thiamethoxam or imidacloprid, compared to the 22.9% in 2015 (Tables 1 & 2; Fig
2). However, following the implementation of the moratorium in 2015 residues were most

 frequently detected in honey collected from the period of oilseed rape flowering (May to July)
rather than the months following this (Fig 2B). Occasionally, honey samples contained two of
the three neonicotinoid compounds (3.8%), although no sample contained all three (Table B
in S1 Appendix). The most frequently identified neonicotinoid was clothianidin (Table 1),
which was in 72.0% of samples testing positive for neonicotinoids in 2014 (pre-moratorium)
and 38.1% of samples in 2015 (post-moratorium). Thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were less
common, occurring in 14–28% of neonicotinoid-contaminated honey samples in either year.
Oilseed rape crops as a predictor of neonicotinoid residues in honey
following the moratorium
Although neonicotinoid residues declined from May to September in 2015, there were positive
correlations between three types of agricultural land use and the combined neonicotinoid
(clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid) concentrations in all honey samples from that
year (Table 3). Positive correlations were with the cover of oilseed rape (Fig 3A), the cover of

Summary of neonicotinoids residues found in honey. Mean and maximum recorded concentrations for individual compounds (thiamethoxam, clothianidin
and imidacloprid) within honey from 2014–2015 are provided. Due to the zero inflate nature of the data median residue values for individual compounds
were always zero.

the change in average (±SE) combined (clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid) residues found in honey
over time. Due to the limited number of samples the pre-moratorium period is combined into a single value.
The second graph (B) shows how the proportion of honey samples containing neonicotinoid residues
changed over time. Note that residues of more than one neonicotinoid type may appear in a single honey
sample. As such the proportion of samples containing either clothianidin, thiamethoxam or imidacloprid has
been scaled so that when combined it does not exceed the proportion of honey samples containing
neonicotinoid residues of any type. Where N = the number of honey samples for a particular time period.

 included in a single additive model (Table B in S1 Appendix). However, comparing models
using single land use types showed that the model using cover of oilseed rape as a predictor of
neonicotinoid residues in honey had the lowest AICc values and thus the greatest explanatory
power (Table 3). There was no evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the concentrations of neo-
nicotinoids in honey from either the pre-moratorium (Moran’s I test: observed / expected I =
-0.13/-0.05, p = 0.42) or post-moratorium period (Moran’s I: 0.019/-0.009, p = 0.34). A correla-
tion between oilseed rape cover and the residues of neonicotinoids in honey from the pre-mor-
atorium period was also found for the limited number of 2014 samples taken before the
moratorium (Fig A and Table D in S1 Appendix).
Discussion
This national survey detected residues of neonicotinoid in over one fifth of samples originating
from honey harvested in the first year of an EU moratorium on the use of these pesticides on
mass flowering crops. While this represented a reduction in the frequency of honey contami-
nated with neonicotinoids compared to the pre-moratorium period (as identified both here
and from pre-moratorium surveys in France [20]), this suggests that these pesticides remain
prevalent in the farming environment. Indeed the persistence of residues was highlighted by
the detection of imidacloprid in honey at a rate disproportional to its use in 2014; by which
time it had largely been replaced in the UK by clothianidin and thiamethoxam [31]. The
combined concentrations of neonicotinoids residues (imidacloprid, clothianidin and thia-
methoxam) never exceeding 2.0 ng g-1 in samples from either the pre- or post-moratorium
period. This represents comparable concentrations of neonicotinoids to those reported from
worldwide honey surveys of neonicotinoids, although mean concentrations found here were
lower than their reported 1.8 ng g-1 [24]. Importantly, these concentrations pose no risk to
human health being more than two orders of magnitude below the 500 ng g-1 maximum resi-
due level permitted in honey intended for human consumption [40].
Even for honeybees that consume stored honey these concentrations are below those that
cause acute mortality. For example, honeybees exposed to our highest recorded residues
would receive 0.08 ng day-1 bee-1 based on the daily consumption of 40 mg of honey [41]. This
falls well below acute oral LD50 values [12]. Under controlled regulatory conditions quantifica-
tion of long term (> 10 day) chronic effects of neonicotinoids (e.g. LC50 values) are hard to
achieve due to methodological issues relating to keeping control populations of bees alive. For
this reason, the implications of low level residues in honey are not easy to assess in terms of
their impacts under field conditions. However, these neonicotinoid concentration can also be
considered in terms of a hazard quotient (HQ), which provide an indication of the potential

(2015) of the European Union moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids. Combined neonicotinoids residues are correlated with potential agricultural sources
of these pesticides in the form of oilseed rape cover (OSR), winter sown cereal cover and total arable cover. Likelihood Ratio Tests assess whether these

 risk from neonicotinoids consumed in honey relative to acute oral toxicity values [12, 21–23].
When this is derived we detect a peak value of 480, which while an order of magnitude lower
than values for imidacloprid reported by Tosi, Costa (22) (HQ = 5054) and Stoner and Eitzer
(21) (HQ = 17,949), is still equivalent to a bee consuming 12% of its LD50 a day. This suggests
a potential risk of long-term low-level exposure over the course of an entire flowering season
[4, 5]. Importantly, residues in honey and pollen, equivalent to the concentrations identified
here, have been shown to reduce colony viability in overwintering honeybees [9]. Long term
sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids have also been reported in response to concentrations
equivalent to those we found in UK honey [24]. While the impacts of the residue in honey
identified here should be considered with caution, an absence of information on the conse-
quences of long-term chronic effects of neonicotinoids remains a significant evidence gap for
understanding their implications.
An important finding of the study was that concentrations of neonicotinoids in honey did
decline from May to September following the implementation of the moratorium. This could
be due to either the gradual loss of persisting neonicotinoid residues in the soil, or due to the
short early season flowering of oilseed rape providing an important mechanisms of exposure
to honeybees of neonicotinoid soil residues. Ultimately any link to land use presented here is
correlative and as such can only be used to infer possible mechanisms thorough which forag-
ing honeybee may become exposed to neonicotinoid residues following the moratorium.
However, clarification of the mechanisms is required if better stewardship of these pesticides is
to be achieved. We hypothesized two non-exclusive exposure routes in agricultural systems.
These are: 1) the presence of neonicotinoids in mass-flowering crops grown in soils contami-
nated with these compounds, and 2) the presence of neonicotinoids in wildflowers grown on
neonicotinoid contaminated soils though previous use or the drift of contaminated dust or
surface water from treated crops [5, 14–16, 18]. The latter of these hypotheses can also be con-
sidered in terms of the underlying mechanism of soil contamination, which may be driven to a
far greater extent by accidental contamination of non-crop areas though dust when sowing or
movement of surface water from areas of treated crop [5, 14–16, 18]. Note, that the importance
of drift is considered to be very low for winter sown cereals, although contamination risk from
surface water remains a potential issue [10, 18]. Previous work has also suggested that due to
the relatively short flowering period of oilseed rape, wild plants found throughout the growing
season may pose a risk to bees if non-target neonicotinoids are present in their pollen and nec-
tar [15]. However, the current analysis focuses on dominant crops likely to be acting as a pri-
mary source of exposure in terms of total land cover and historical and ongoing practices of
neonicotinoid use. Agricultural systems are complex interacting environments and simple
metrics of land cover as used here can only provide indications of potential routes of exposure
for these pesticides.
While our results do not preclude the potential for wild flowers to provide a risk of exposure
to neonicotinoid for bees, we would argue that our evidence suggests that the identification of
non-target neonicotinoids in mass-flowering crops may pose the greater risk. This reflects the
relatively large areas over which these crops are sown and the continued use of neonicotinoid
seed treatments on cereals that may precede them in a cropping rotation [29]. Further, the
cover of untreated oilseed rape was the better predictor of the relationship between agricultural
land use and neonicotinoid residues in honey when compared to the cover of either total ara-
ble (> 5 AICc difference) or winter sown cereals (>8 AICc difference). The importance of oil-
seed rape as mechanism of continued exposure risk for honeybees is also supported by the
number of samples containing residues predominantly associated with the peak period of oil-
seed rape flowering (May-June). Early season exposure to neonicotinoids, which would occur
where neonicotinoids were found in untreated oilseed rape, may pose a particular risk to

 honeybees as this coincides with the period where colonies are small and queens show their
highest levels of vulnerability [42]. The predominance of early season neonicotinoid residues
interestingly contrasts with an Italian study that found that peak concentrations of all pesticide
residues are associated with the summer months [22]. Although we propose the early season
prevalence of residues as a link to oilseed rape flowering, it should be noted that there is some
evidence that autumn supplementary feeding with sugar syrup (a practice used to promote
greater honey yields the following summer) may cause bees to move syrup stored from brood
chamber into the supers over the winter when they need that space for rearing brood. We
therefore cannot exclude the possibility that some of the honey collected in the spring of 2015
may contain honey from the previous year where it was stored in the brood chamber over the
winter period [25].
Conclusions
The sustainable use of pesticides remains dependent on robust risk assessments that protect
not just human health, but also the environment and associated ecosystem processes [43,
44]. The results of this national survey suggests that the EU moratorium on neonicotinoid
use for mass-flowering crops have been only partially effective in reducing exposure risk to
bees. There was evidence for continued neonicotinoid residues in honey following the mora-
torium, although the occurrence of these residues have declined in the months following the
implementation of the ban. This risk of exposure is likely linked to persistent soil residues in
the extensive areas where oilseed rape is grown. It is important to emphasize that the rela-
tionships presented in this study are correlative. While the presence of residues after the ban
and our identification of a correlation between oilseed rape cover add weight to soil residues
as a mechanism of exposure risk for honeybees to neonicotinoids they cannot confirm it
directly. Research is ultimately required to quantify how long neonicotinoid residues persist
under field conditions, in particular by providing quantification of those conditions or soil
types where degradation rates are reduced. Where the persistence of soil residues following
neonicotinoids use is a problem then restricting application of seed-treatments in crops that
precede a mass flowering species, like oilseed rape, may help to reduce the presence of these
pesticides in pollen and nectar. However, it remains to be seen if residues in honey continue
to persist over time under current permitted neonicotinoid use and agricultural rotations in
the EU.
