BACKGROUND: Lung nodules are a diagnostic challenge, with an estimated yearly incidence of
1.6 million in the United States. This study evaluated the accuracy of an integrated proteomic
classifier in identifying benign nodules in patients with a pretest probability of cancer
(pCA) # 50%.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter observational trial of 685 patients with 8- to 30-mm
lung nodules was conducted. Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry was used to
measure the relative abundance of two plasma proteins, LG3BP and C163A. Results were
integrated with a clinical risk prediction model to identify likely benign nodules. Sensitivity,
specificity, and negative predictive value were calculated. Estimates of potential changes in
invasive testing had the integrated classifier results been available and acted on were made.
RESULTS: A subgroup of 178 patients with a clinician-assessed pCA # 50% had a
16% prevalence of lung cancer. The integrated classifier demonstrated a sensitivity of
97% (CI, 82-100), a specificity of 44% (CI, 36-52), and a negative predictive value of 98% (CI,
92-100) in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules. The classifier performed better
than PET, validated lung nodule risk models, and physician cancer probability estimates
(P < .001). If the integrated classifier results were used to direct care, 40% fewer procedures
would be performed on benign nodules, and 3% of malignant nodules would be misclassified.
CONCLUSIONS: When used in patients with lung nodules with a pCA # 50%, the integrated
classifier accurately identifies benign lung nodules with good performance characteristics. If
used in clinical practice, invasive procedures could be reduced by diverting benign nodules to
surveillance.

 Chest CT imaging has increasingly been used for a
myriad of medical presentations such that the estimated
incidence of pulmonary nodules in the United States is
1.6 million per year.1 Add to that the findings of the
National Lung Screening Trial, which showed low-dose
chest CT imaging led to a nodule detection rate of
25% on the prevalence screen, the evaluation and
management of pulmonary nodules are certain to be an
increasingly common issue needing to be addressed.2
The approach to a pulmonary nodule begins with
estimating the probability of malignancy.3 Depending on
probability of cancer (pCA), patients are managed with
either CT surveillance, additional diagnostic testing
(including PET, CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy
[TTNA], and/or bronchoscopy), or definitive therapy
with surgical excision. All approaches should account for
patient health status and preferences. Although
physicians are skilled at predicting malignancy in
pulmonary nodules, they may not follow guideline-based
care when managing patients with differing risks.4,5
We previously developed a 13-protein blood test to
differentiate benign from malignant lung nodules
using multiple reaction monitoring mass
spectrometry.6 The proteomic classifier was more
accurate than a four-parameter clinical model,
independent of patient age, tobacco use, nodule size,
and the presence of COPD.7 The test was further
refined to improve performance for lower risk nodules
in which the diagnostic dilemma between surveillance
and invasive procedures is most challenging. It was
discovered that the accuracy of two of the proteins,
LG3BP and C163A (independently linked to lung
cancer and the inflammatory response to cancer),8-10
could be optimized for evaluating lower risk nodules
by integrating them with five clinical risk factors.
LG3BP, in particular, has been previously studied in a
network analysis implicating its overexpression to
lung cancer pathways and associated transcription
factors.6 This integrated classifier was trained on an
independent set of 222 prospectively collected plasma
samples from patients with 8- to 20-mm lung
nodules.11 The current article is a second prospective,
multicenter, observational clinical validation study
with retrospective evaluation assessing the
performance characteristics of this integrated classifier
in patients presenting with undiagnosed low to
moderate risk lung nodules.
Patients and Methods
Pulmonary Nodule Plasma Proteomic Classifier Study
Design and Enrollment
The Pulmonary Nodule Plasma Proteomic Classifier (PANOPTIC)
study
is
a
prospective,
multicenter,
observational
study
with
retrospective
evaluation
of
the
performance
of
the
integrated
classifier test comprising two proteins and five clinical risk factors.
Physicians, study subjects, and laboratory and statistical personnel
were blinded to the results of the test and clinical information. The
blinding protocol was strictly followed, and the results of the test did
not direct or influence patient care. Thirty-three sites (31 US and
two Canadian) were included. All sites had institutional review board
approval, and informed written consent was obtained from all
eligible participants (e-Table 1).
Eligible patients were $ 40 years old with pulmonary nodules 8 to
30 mm in diameter presenting within 60 days of the baseline CT
scan to a pulmonologist and/or a thoracic surgeon. Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy was not an exclusion. Patients were ineligible if
they had any of the following: undergone any attempt at a previous
biopsy of the nodule in question; undergone a prior CT scan or
PET/CT
scan
that
had
identified
the
lung
nodule
under
consideration; a current or previous diagnosis of any cancer within 2
years of lung nodule detection (except for nonmelanoma skin
cancer); or received any blood products within 30 days of study
enrollment.
A power analysis was performed to assess the number of benign and
malignant
nodules
required
to
perform
a
statistical
test
of
significance for area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve
(AUC) assuming an a of 0.05, power of 0.80, and an assumed
performance with AUC of 0.70. The number necessary to have
adequate power was 21 benign and 21 malignant nodules.
Data Collection
At
enrollment
and
prior
to
subsequent
testing,
physicians
(pulmonologists or thoracic surgeons to whom the patients had been
referred) assessed nodule pretest pCA as 0% to 5%, 6% to 10%,
11%
to
20%,
and
so
forth.
Physicians
estimated
the
pretest
probability at their own discretion. Patient demographic and nodule
characteristics were collected at baseline and from subsequent CT
imaging studies. Imaging studies were interpreted by site radiologists
as part of usual care, and nodule characteristics (including location,

 size, and edge characteristics) were collected from the reports by site
study personnel. Blood samples were obtained and processed for
storage and shipment. Data on subsequent procedures, including
bronchoscopy,
transthoracic
needle
biopsy,
and
surgery,
were
obtained and entered by the enrolling site until definitive diagnosis,
nodule resolution, or at least 1 year of radiographic stability
according to chest CT imaging. PET results were recorded as
positive for standard uptake values $ 2.5. Pathology reports were
collected from biopsy samples or surgical resection.
Plasma Proteomic Analysis
Proteomic analysis of two plasma proteins, LG3BP and C163A, was
performed by using multiple reaction monitoring mass spectroscopy
as previously described.6,7 These results were integrated with the five
clinical risk factors (age [in years], smoking status [never, current, or
former], nodule diameter [largest diameter], edge characteristics
[smooth, spiculated, or lobulated], and
location]) to yield a
posttest probability of a lung nodule being benign as previously
defined in a separate prospective study (e-Fig 1, e-Table 2).11
Analysis of Integrated Classifier Performance
The performance of the integrated classifier was assessed by using
standard
metrics,
including
AUC,
sensitivity,
specificity,
and
negative predictive value (NPV). These metrics were also used to
compare the performance of the integrated classifier vs other lung
nodule
cancer
risk
stratification
methods,
including
physician
assessment (pCA), clinical prediction models (Mayo and Veterans
Affairs [VA]), and PET. Because the intended use of the integrated
classifier is to identify benign lung nodules and reduce the number
of
invasive
procedures,
the
performance
of
the
test,
and
its
comparators, was assessed by using the NPV as the primary metric.
The threshold at which maximum NPV was observed in the
discovery study was validated in the current study.11 Furthermore,
the NPV at this threshold in the current study is used to report the
performance of the test.
Nodules were defined as benign for any of the following: (1) definitive
pathologic diagnosis; (2) radiographic resolution; or (3) no evidence of
growth according to CT scan over 1 year. Although the standard
surveillance is 2 years of radiologic stability on chest CT imaging,
for this analysis, 1 year of CT imaging stability was chosen based on
a study observing lung nodules/masses by CT scan demonstrating
no growth in nodules stable at 1 year on subsequent 2-year follow-
up.12 A malignant diagnosis was based on histopathologic findings.
Those patients who were treated empirically with radiation and/or
chemotherapy for a suspected malignancy without a confirmatory
diagnosis were excluded from the analysis.
Assessment of Potential Impact of the Integrated
Classifier
In the intended use cohort, those nodules with a “likely benign”
integrated classifier result were stratified according to final diagnosis.
Percentages of benign nodules correctly classified by using the
integrated classifier and malignant nodules incorrectly classified by
using the integrated classifier were calculated. Invasive procedure
utilization directly following initial nodule detection was tabulated and
stratified according to final diagnosis to assess the number and
percentages of invasive testing that could have been avoided had the
integrated classifier test been available and used for nodule management.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by using MATLAB, version
8.3.0.532
(MathWorks),
and
MedCalc,
version
16.4
(MedCalc
Software bvba). A c2 of ANOVA testing was used to compare
groups, and a P value # .05 was considered significant. For
comparison of cancer risk predictors, the McNemar statistical test
was used at a fixed sensitivity or specificity.13
Results
Of 685 patients enrolled prospectively in the
PANOPTIC study from November 2012 to December
2015, a total of 293 were excluded for the reasons listed
in Figure 1, yielding 392 eligible for analysis. The
demographic characteristics for the 392 patients are
presented in e-Table 1. This study of the integrated
classifier’s performance focused on the subgroup of 178
patients having a lung nodule with a pCA # 50%. No
differences were observed in demographic or nodule
characteristics between included and excluded (n ¼ 234)
patients (e-Table 3). Table 1 provides baseline patient
demographic characteristics and radiographic
parameters for nodules having a pCA # 50%, stratified
according to final histologic diagnosis. The prevalence of
malignancy was 16%, with the majority being
adenocarcinoma histology (59%). Both groups had
significant smoking histories. Malignant nodules were
significantly larger (16.5 vs 13.5 mm; P < .01).
The demographic characteristics, outcomes, and
procedure utilization across groups of physician-
assessed risk of malignancy are presented in e-Table 4.
The risk of cancer increases with nodule size (P < .001).
The use of serial imaging decreases, while the use of
PET, biopsy, and surgery all increase, as the risk of
malignancy increases (P < .001).
For all 392 eligible subjects, clinicians assigned a PCA #
50% to the majority with an eventual benign diagnosis,
with only 6% of subjects assigned to the very lowest risk
group with a pCA of 0% to 5% (Fig 2). The performance
of clinician assessments (pCA) was compared with that
of the VA and Mayo Clinic lung nodule risk models.14,15
The AUC for physician assignment of benign nodules
into low to moderate risk (# 50%) or malignant nodules
into moderate to high risk (> 50%) groups was 0.85,
which was greater than the AUCs of 0.75 and 0.78
observed for the VA and Mayo models, respectively.5
Further analyses focused on the pCA # 50% subgroup
(n ¼ 178). The integrated classifier revealed a sensitivity
of 97% (CI, 82-100), a specificity of 44% (CI, 36-52), and
a posttest probability of 98% (CI, 92-100) in
distinguishing benign from malignant nodules. The
integrated classifier demonstrated an AUC of 0.76,
chestjournal.org
493
 whereas the AUCs for physician pCA, the VA and Mayo
models, and PET were 0.69, 0.60, 0.69, and 0.58,
respectively (Fig 3). In e-Figure 2 and e-Table 5, the
relative contribution of the component elements of the
integrated classifier are presented. Using the McNemar
test in which sensitivity was fixed at 90%, the integrated
classifier performed significantly better than physician
pCA, the VA and Mayo models, and PET (P # .001).
Comparison to PET was restricted to the 75 subjects
who had PET performed. Similar performance of the
integrated classifier when stratified according to lung
cancer subtype is shown in e-Table 6. The effects of the
integrated classifier on adjusting pCA in the intended-
use population stratified according to benign and
malignant diagnoses are shown in e-Figure 3.
The potential impact of the integrated classifier was
evaluated in two populations. For intended-use subjects,
66 of 178 were “likely benign” according to the integrated
classifier. Of these, 65 had a benign nodule and 1 had a
malignant lung nodule. Because there are 149 benign lung
nodules and 29 malignant lung nodules in the study,
44% of benign lung nodules (65 of 149) were correctly
labeled “likely benign,” and 3% of malignant nodules

 (1 of 29) were incorrectly labeled “likely benign.” In the
58 subjects who underwent an invasive procedure directly
following the initial nodule detection, 35 nodules were
benign and 23 were malignant. Of the 35 benign lung
nodules, 14 (40%) were identified as “likely benign” by
the integrated classifier, whereas of the 23 malignant lung
nodules, 1 (4%) was incorrectly identified as “likely
benign.” The actual number of malignant nodules routed
initially to surveillance was 13 of 29 (45%) in the
intended-use subjects.

for nodules with pCA # 50% stratified according to
histologic diagnosis, as well as potential reduction of
procedure had the integrated classifier been used in
decision-making. Among surgeries performed as the sole
diagnostic procedure, 7 of 20 (35%) were benign.
Among biopsies performed as the only diagnostic
procedure, 28 of 37 (76%) were benign. Fifty percent of
patients who underwent both biopsy and surgical
procedures received a benign diagnosis.

 proteomics classifier, comprising both proteins and
clinical parameters, in distinguishing benign from
malignant nodules. This large, multicenter observational
study has several important findings. First, over the
entire risk space, physicians perform very well; however,
they are less accurate when the pCA is # 50%. Second,
when the probability of malignancy in a nodule
is # 50%, a “likely benign” integrated proteomic
classifier result accurately identifies patients with benign
nodules. This approach may enable physicians to re-
categorize nodules from a strategy in which further
testing is indicated to one in which CT surveillance is
advisable. Thus, if incorporated into the current
algorithm for managing nodules, the test may reduce
patients’ exposure to the morbidity and cost of avoidable
invasive procedures. In addition, use of the test would
lead to only a small percentage of patients with
malignancy being misclassified as benign, potentially
leading to an inappropriate surveillance strategy. These
findings substantiate the need for a future clinical utility
study to assess how clinical decision-making and use of
invasive procedures are altered with knowledge of the
results of this test in the right clinical setting.
When choosing a strategy for evaluating patients with
lung nodules, clinicians should consider both the
probability that the nodule is malignant and the
advantages and disadvantages of management strategies.
Serial surveillance has the advantage of being
noninvasive and is recommend if the pCA is < 5%.
However, in this study and another, < 10% of nodules $
8 mm fell into this risk category.4 In the latter study, all
patients with a pCA < 5% were ultimately found to have
benign disease. Although this approach avoids the
potential harm of procedures, there is potential for
interval growth of malignant nodules. The penalty for
that growth is unknown and based on the biology of the
tumor. One study of lung cancer experts found that
there was little agreement in the penalty of missing
growth between scans with estimates of stage shift from
a lower stage to higher stage ranging from 1 to 50% with
a resultant reduction in life expectancy.16 On the
opposite end of the spectrum, nodules with a pCA >
65% should be promptly resected in those healthy
enough to tolerate surgery, providing both a diagnosis
and treatment. The harms associated with this strategy
include a morbidity of 5% and a mortality of 0.5%.3
Perhaps the most challenging group to manage are those
with intermediate risk nodules (pCA 5%-65%), in which
a substantial proportion of patients (45%) in this
study are grouped and where 81% of the nodules were
benign. Guidelines suggest further evaluation with PET
scan, TTNA, or bronchoscopy.3 Integrated PET/CT
imaging has good sensitivity (86%- 91%) and specificity
(71%- 81).17 However, false-positive findings

 (eg, granulomatous disease) and false-negative findings
(eg, carcinoid) can mislead the clinician in either
direction. TTNA has a yield between 70% (nodules <
15 mm) and 90% (nodules > 15 mm) but a 1% risk of
hemorrhage and a pneumothorax rate of 16%, in which
6% require a chest tube.3,18 The side-effect profile for
bronchoscopy is acceptably low, but the yield (51%-70%)
for pulmonary nodules even when using navigation is
lower than TTNA.19,20 In addition, a negative score from
a bronchial-airway gene expression classifier of epithelial
cells brushed from normal mucosa at the time of
bronchoscopy improves the NPV in patients with an
intermediate pretest probability for cancer and
nondiagnostic bronchoscopy; however, not all patients
with nodules routinely undergo bronchoscopy.12
Clinicians can be left uncertain in management decisions,
leading to potentially avoidable testing in patients with
benign disease. One analysis found that of the total
diagnostic costs of evaluating nodules, 43.1% was due to
biopsy of patients without lung cancer.21
This intermediate-risk group may be those individuals
in whom an integrated proteomics classifier would be
useful. In patients with a pCA # 50%, a likely benign
test result could reduce the number of invasive
procedures in those with benign nodules by 36% (an
absolute risk reduction of 10.1% for all patients with
benign nodules). This scenario assumes that all patients
with likely benign results would be shifted to a
surveillance strategy. It is important to consider that
3% of the patients with malignant nodules would also be
placed in surveillance. Thus, it is critical for clinicians to
continue to follow up until resolution or an acceptable
period of CT radiographic stability has occurred.
What is unclear from these data is the extent to which
clinicians would change their management based on the
results of this test, although a survey of experienced
pulmonologists found that a hypothetical blood test
resulted in significant alterations in a decision to pursue
invasive testing.22 What is clear is that multiple studies
reveal significant deviation from guideline-based
care.4,5,23 This trial is a clinical validation study that will
need to undergo the clinical utility phase of biomarker
development as outlined in the American Thoracic
Society policy statement.24
The clinical validation phase of biomarker development
establishes the accuracy of the biomarker in the
intended-use population. Biomarker developers can use
this accuracy, as well as an understanding of the
potential benefit of a true result and the harm from a
false result, to estimate whether the biomarker
performs well enough to justify further evaluation in a
clinical utility study. More than one method is
available to help with this estimate.24 One formula
that has been proposed for a rule-out test states the
specificity/(1 – sensitivity) $ (prevalence/1 –
prevalence) � harm/benefit, where harm/benefit is the
number of true negative results required to justify one
false-negative result. If we use the prevalence of
malignancy in the intended-use population in this study
(16.3%) and the specificity (44%) and sensitivity (97%)
reported here, the formula would produce a harm/
benefit of 75.2 (ie, 75 true-negative results for each false-
negative result). If the prevalence in the intended-use
population was 40%, this number would be 22. These
results strongly suggest that assessing the biomarker in a
clinical utility study would be worthwhile.
Another important aspect of determining if the results of
the clinical validation study warrant pursuit of a clinical
utility study is understanding what percentage of tests
ordered will provide a meaningful result. For a rule-out
test, where the negative test result may change
management but the positive test result will not, a test
with the characteristics presented here could lead to
management change in a population with a prevalence
of 16.3% approximately 37% of the time, and in a
population with a prevalence of 40%, approximately
28% of the time. This method provides less convincing
evidence of the potential for clinical utility, but the
implications for those with a negative test result are still
believed to be large enough to support clinical utility
testing. It is only through the results of a well-designed
clinical utility study that we can determine the true
potential value of the test.
The present study has limitations. First, the effect the
plasma protein test might have had on test ordering was
retrospectively analyzed; thus, a prospective study to
assess changes in practice is warranted. Second,
community practices are underrepresented in this trial;
however, based on a previous study,4 the likely benefit in
terms of reduction of invasive testing would be
significantly greater than that reported here. Third,
although there is precedent for reporting 1-year
outcomes for stable nodules, traditionally, 2 years of
nodule stability is what has been required to determine a
nodule is benign. Two-year follow-up data will be
reported in the future once finalized. Fourth, there were
88 patients without follow-up CT scan data at 1 year.
This degree of missing data may not be random, as
patients with a low risk of lung cancer may have been
498

 less likely to be adherent with follow-up
recommendations.
This study has several strengths. First, to the best of our
knowledge, this study is the largest prospective,
multicenter, geographically diverse observational clinical
study to validate an integrated blood biomarker for the
evaluation of pulmonary nodules. Second, test
development was rigorous: the integrated classifier was
developed on an independent set of prospectively
collected samples; the integrated classifier, laboratory
standard operating procedures, and quality control
subjects were all predefined and documented; and
physicians, patients, and laboratory and statistical
personnel were compliant with a blinding protocol.
Finally, by having physicians estimate the probability of
cancer in a pulmonary guideline, concordance with
management decisions could be assessed.
Conclusions
This study is the first we are aware of to assess the
accuracy of an integrated plasma proteomics classifier in
patients with pulmonary nodules in a geographically
diverse population with varying risk of cancer. In those
with low to moderate risk nodules (pCA # 50%), a
“likely benign” test result could safely allow patients to
be followed up by using serial imaging. Further research
is needed to assess the effect of incorporating this test
into the diagnostic algorithm for nodule management in
the hope of reducing unnecessary procedures in patients
without cancer.
