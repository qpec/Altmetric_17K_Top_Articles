BACKGROUND: A key challenge to mining electronic health records for mammography research is the preponderance of unstruc-
tured narrative text, which strikingly limits usable output. The imaging characteristics of breast cancer subtypes have been described
previously, but without standardization of parameters for data mining. METHODS: The authors searched the enterprise-wide data
warehouse at the Houston Methodist Hospital, the Methodist Environment for Translational Enhancement and Outcomes Research
(METEOR), for patients with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 5 mammogram readings performed be-
tween January 2006 and May 2015 and an available pathology report. The authors developed natural language processing (NLP)
software algorithms to automatically extract mammographic and pathologic findings from free text mammogram and pathology
reports. The correlation between mammographic imaging features and breast cancer subtype was analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance and the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The NLP algorithm was able to obtain key characteristics for 543 patients who met
the inclusion criteria. Patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors were more likely to have spiculated margins (P 5.0008), and
those with tumors that overexpressed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were more likely to have heterogeneous
and pleomorphic calcifications (P 5.0078 and P 5.0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic imaging characteristics,
obtained from an automated text search and the extraction of mammogram reports using NLP techniques, correlated with pathologic
breast cancer subtype. The results of the current study validate previously reported trends assessed by manual data collection.
Furthermore, NLP provides an automated means with which to scale up data extraction and analysis for clinical decision support.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States.1 Advances
have been made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Biomarker expres-
sion data are stored in the patient’s electronic health record (EHR). Established molecular markers, including the estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are currently used to
help guide treatment with targeted therapies such as antiestrogen and anti-HER2 therapies.2,3
Mammography is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings
such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis.
The use of mammography data for translational research primarily is hindered by variations in mammographic reporting
and the preponderance of unstructured narrative text, which limit data collection and interpretation.
The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to
standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate cancer risk communication and biopsy decision making.4 The BI-RADS

 lexicon includes 43 descriptors and classifies mammograms
into 1 of 7 assessment categories.4 Despite the BI-RADS
recommendations, substantial interobserver variability in the
application of the BI-RADS lexicon remains, including
inappropriate term usage and missing data.5-9 In addition,
the majority of data are not collected in a structured format
as defined by Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) structured reporting,10 and still are
reported as free text in accessible media such as mammo-
graphic reporting systems or radiology information systems.
Traditional mammographic imaging research has used
manual abstraction to convert information from the free text
report into structured data. Manual abstraction is not feasi-
ble for large sample sizes due to limitations of time as well as
expense. In the era of EHR systems, big data, and machine
learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP) has
emerged as a possible solution with which to overcome the
limitations of manual data abstraction and creates great
opportunities in data mining of breast imaging to facilitate
outcomes research and precision medicine. NLP is a compo-
nent of artificial intelligence and uses algorithms to process
data patterns to make information accessible.11 Public
domain and commercial NLP systems have been tested
extensively in research and clinical settings.11-18 The study
institution uses the PowerScribe radiology dictation system
(Nuance Communications Inc, Burlington, Mass), which
does not allow for structured reports. Because commercial
NLP systems are not readily available for academic and affili-
ated hospitals implementing breast cancer decision support
systems, we developed an NLP-based tool, the Methodist
Hospital text teaser (MOTTE). MOTTE is able to extract
data reliably from millions of free text mammogram reports
archived in our enterprise clinical data warehouse.19
Several retrospective studies and meta-analyses have
described
the
associations
between
specific
tumor
subtypes and mammographic features by using manual
record entry.20-27 The purpose of the current study was to
investigate the usefulness of data mining and NLP in
defining the set of mammographic features correlated
with the molecular subtypes of breast cancer in women
with BI-RADS category 5 mammogram reports.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Study Design
The current study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Houston Methodist Hospital, where
all study patients underwent mammography and biopsy.
Clinical data were sourced from the Methodist Envi-
ronment for Translational Enhancement and Outcomes
Research (METEOR) data warehouse.19 METEOR is an
enterprise-wide clinical data warehouse and analytics envi-
ronment that integrates an existing business data ware-
house with internal and external research databases and
national registries to support clinical research and
outcomes studies for improving the cost-effectiveness of
patient care. METEOR evaluates data queries and has the
ability to process clinical free text documents and perform
advanced analytics and visualization reporting. The
METEOR data warehouse contains records dating back
to January 1, 2006 from approximately 2 million unique
patients with visit encounter and clinical records. In par-
ticular, the METEOR data warehouse contains 135,280
unique patient mammogram reports dating from January
1, 2006 to May 30, 2015. Breast biopsy and pathologic
data also were obtained from METEOR.
MOTTE, the online structured query language
processing tool with NLP capability, was used to identify
patients with BI-RADS category 5 mammograms who
underwent breast biopsy within 3 months of their abnor-
mal mammogram report date between January 2006 and
May 2015. A Java-based NLP tool was then developed
and used to parse out the sentences from the reports to ex-
clude the note section. A total of 717 patients with BI-
RADS category 5 mammograms were identified. Without
a formal chart review of all the records, there may have
been additional BI-RADS category 5 mammograms that
were not included. Next, patients with invasive cancer
were identified among this pool of 717 patients using our
MOTTE NLP tool and applying major keywords for in-
vasive carcinoma and subtype information (ER, PR, and
HER2 status) from the pathology textual reports. Of the
717 patients, 543 patients were found to have invasive dis-
ease and were included in the current study. MOTTE was
used to extract clinical data (age, race, height, weight,
body mass index [BMI], and personal and family history
of breast cancer) from the METEOR data warehouse. For
patients who had undergone surgery within 3 months of
the date of their abnormal mammogram, pathologic
information (tumor stage and ER, PR, and HER2 status)
was extracted by applying NLP to the biopsy and surgical
pathology
reports.
Mammographic
findings
were
extracted using statistical database queries; International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD 9) codes;
and MOTTE, which included clinical symptoms such as
palpable lump, skin changes, and nipple discharge as
well as breast density as a categorical variable and
the presence of a mass, calcifications, architectural dis-
tortion, asymmetric density, and calcification character-
istics as categorical variables.

 MOTTE NLP Analysis
To facilitate NLP analysis, text reports were preprocessed
by determining the general structure of each of the radiol-
ogy or pathology reports. NLP was then applied to search
and retrieve established clinical parameters. MOTTE’s
NLP algorithm contains 5 processing steps including
tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, vector space
modeling, and similarity calculation, as detailed in our
previous publication.19 Tokenization turns each clinical
text report into a stream of tokens. We used a Bayesian
model and defined token “t” as a string of alphanumeric
characters surrounded by white space. The second step
adopted was stemming. A word in a different grammatical
form was converted into the word’s ground form using
the stem class model to remove the phase affixes and other
lexical components and then refreshed as the new token.
For example, we converted the
words diagnosing,
diagnoses, and diagnosed into diagnose. The third step
involved removing stop words. Stop words do not carry
any useful information for the text report analysis and
usually are conjunctions, pronouns, or prepositions such
as the, this, and which. We defined the list of stop words
based on prior publications.18
The next processing step adopted was the modeling
of all tokens in a high-dimensional vector space. We
defined each token as a dimension of the vector space and
the frequency of each token occurring in each sentence as
the position along the axis in the vector space. Hence,
each token has different axis positions for different senten-
ces. The similarity between the requested clinical informa-
tion and the sentence was measured in terms of distances
in this vector space.
Similarity calculation was the final step in the
METEOR’s MOTTE tool. We set up a series of clinical
information key points according to the requirements of
physicians and researchers and then calculated the similar-
ity between the key points and each sentence. We used the
Jaccard similarity coefficient to compare the similarity
and diversity of sample sets,16 with the highest Jaccard
similarity coefficient among all sentences selected as the
return value. For example, one of our clinical information
items was complex cystic mass and in the free text report,
the sentence “there is a new complex cystic mass with in-
ternal septations” contained the highest Jaccard similarity
coefficient, indicating a positive finding.
The free text radiology and pathology reports of the
543 patients with invasive cancer were reviewed and pre-
defined parameters were extracted by applying NLP
MOTTE techniques. We used the approach described
by Buckley et al,28 including creating a bucket list of
keywords of interest and negation, merging addendum
pathology reports, and ordering of diagnosis based on the
level of significance (invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive
lobular carcinoma>ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]>
atypical lobular hyperplasia>atypical ductal hyperpla-
sia>benign).28 Invasive carcinoma was identified using
the following major keywords: //Carcinoma invasive
carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, invasive, invasive ductal car-
cinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, infiltrating, infiltrating
ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, infiltrat-
ing tubular carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, necrotic carcino-
ma, and infiltrative. In addition, variations in the above
keywords (arising majorly from misspellings) were includ-
ed in the bucket list of keywords. Multiple pathology
reports from the same individual were reported as an ad-
dendum to the initial report. The MOTTE program
merged all the addendums with the initial report and then
processed this single report. In cases in which >1 stage of
disease was reported in the merged reports, the MOTTE
program selected the higher stage. MOTTE was not pro-
grammed to distinguish between multiple excisions on
the same side or bilateral excisions. Resulting data were
verified and validated (99% accuracy) by assessing a ran-
dom 10% of records29 against a gold standard of manual
chart review, which was completed by the clinical coau-
thors and took approximately 50 to 70 hours. Further-
more, manual review also was performed for the 174
patients not included in the current study and confirmed
the NLP findings. NLP accurately identified 174 charts as
having incomplete information (HER2 status) for sub-
type determination or benign biopsy findings.
Molecular Subtype Categories
Patients were divided into 3 established breast cancer
prognostic groups based on tumor biomarker expression.
Tumors with ER expression >1% by immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) and negative HER2 expression by IHC and/
or fluorescence in situ hybridization were categorized as
ER positive (ER1). Tumors with HER2 overexpression,
defined as IHC 3 1 or fluorescence in situ hybridization
amplified as per the American Society of Clinical Oncolo-
gy/College of American Pathologists guidelines,3 were
categorized as HER2 positive (HER21) regardless of
ER or PR expression. Tumors with negative ER, PR,
and HER2 expression were categorized as triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC).
Statistical Analysis

and mammographic features. Differences in categorical

 and continuous factors among the breast cancer subtypes
were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and one-way
analysis of variance, respectively. The Tukey-Kramer
method was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons of
continuous factors. All offline statistical analyses were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) at a 5% significance level
(2-sided).
RESULTS
Study Population
A total of 717 patients with BI-RADS category 5 mam-
mograms were identified. The MOTTE NLP algorithm
was applied to mammogram and pathology reports using
major keywords for invasive carcinoma and to extract
information regarding the breast cancer subtype (ER, PR,
and HER2 status). Of the 717 patients, 543 (75.7%) had
invasive carcinoma and breast cancer subtype available.
MOTTE-generated data from these patients were used to
determine the correlation of demographic, clinical, and
mammographic characteristics with breast cancer subtype.
Table 1 shows the frequency of individual BI-RADS
lexicon in the reports. Manual review (ER, PR, and
HER2 status; BMI; and breast density) was performed for
a subset of the 543 patients (10%) to confirm NLP accu-
racy. Characteristics of the study population are shown in
Table 2. Sixty patients with DCIS and therefore unknown
HER2 status (HER2 testing is not performed for patients
with DCIS at the study institution), 35 patients with
benign breast biopsies, 4 patients with atypia, and 75
patients who did not have available pathology reports
were excluded from the study. The mean age of the
patients was 60.9 years (range, 59.7-62 years). With
regard to the breast cancer subtype, 70.7%, 15.8%, and
13.4% of patients, respectively, had ER 1 breast cancer,
HER2 1 breast cancer, and TNBC.
Differences in Demographic Factors
Among the Breast Cancer Subtypes
Age at diagnosis was significantly different among patients
with the 3 subtypes (P 5 .03) (Table 3). The mean age at
diagnosis was lowest in the patients with HER2 1 disease
and highest among those with ER 1 disease.
Data regarding BMI were available for 73.5% of the
patients. The mean BMI was 28.9 (range, 28.4-29.5), in-
dicating that the majority of patients were overweight.
BMI was not found to be significantly different among
the 3 subtypes; however, the group of patients with
TNBC had the highest mean BMI (P 5 .08) (Table 3).
The majority of patients were white (67%), followed
by African American (17%), Asian (4.7%), and Hispanic
(1.3%) (Table 2). The percentage of patients with TNBC
tended to be higher in the African American group
than in the other racial groups, but this difference was not
statistically significant (P 5 .06) (Table 4).
Approximately 62% of patients were postmenopausal
(Table 2). The distribution of breast cancer subtypes did
not appear to differ significantly according to menopausal
status (P 5 .0640) (Table 3). However, postmenopausal
women were more likely to have the ER 1 and TNBC
breast cancer subtypes and less likely to have the HER2 1
subtype compared with premenopausal women.
Only 6.8% of patients had a previous history of
breast cancer (Table 2). Approximately 70% of patients
had no family history of breast cancer, which is consistent
with historical numbers. Personal and family histories
of breast cancer were not associated with breast cancer
subtype (Table 3).
Differences in Clinical Characteristics
Among the Breast Cancer Subtypes
Approximately 44% of patients presented with a palpable
lump, and patients with HER21 and TNBC tumors were
twice as likely to present with a palpable lump compared
with patients with ER 1 tumors (P<.0001) (Table 3)
(Fig. 1). Skin changes were present in <25% of the
patients. Skin changes were twice as likely to be present in

 patients with the HER21 subtype compared with those
with the ER 1 and TNBC subtypes (P<.0001) (Table 3)
(Fig. 1). Nipple discharge was observed infrequently
(1.1%), thereby prohibiting significant differences among
the subtypes.
Differences in Mammographic Features Among
the Breast Cancer Subtypes
Breast density was > 25% in 91.6% of patients (Table 2).
The most common breast density was fibroglandular (den-
sity of 25%-50%), followed by heterogeneous density
(density of 51%-75%). Breast density did not appear to dif-
fer significantly among the subtypes (P 5 .5917) (Table 3).
Nearly all patients (97.8%) had a mass present on
their mammogram. The presence of a mass on mammog-
raphy was not significantly different among the subtypes.
Nearly one-half of patients had spiculated margins, and
those with the ER 1 subtype were 1.5 times as likely to
have spiculated margins compared with patients with the
HER2 1 and TNBC subtypes (P 5 .0008) (Table 3)
(Fig. 2). Approximately 68% of patients had calcifications
present in their tumors. Calcifications were more likely
to be present in patients with the HER2 1 subtype
compared
with
those
with
the
ER 1 and
TNBC
subtypes (P 5 .05) (Table 3). With regard to calcification
morphology, the occurrence of heterogeneous, linear, and
pleomorphic calcifications was significantly higher in
patients with the HER2 1 subtype compared with those
with the ER 1 and TNBC subtypes (P 5 .008, .004, and
.0002, respectively) (Table 3) (Fig. 2). Linearly distribut-
ed calcifications were observed in a negligible number of
patients. Segmentally distributed and clustered calcifica-
tions demonstrated a trend toward increased occurrence
in patients with the HER2 1 subtype (P 5 .16 and .17,
respectively) (Table 3).
Architectural distortion and axillary lymphadenopa-
thy were noted in 18.6% and 37.2% of patients, respec-
tively (Table 2). Although not statistically significant,
architectural distortion was more likely to be associated
with the ER 1 subtype (P 5 .12) (Table 3). Axillary
lymphadenopathy was more likely to be associated with
the HER2 1 and TNBC subtypes compared with the
ER 1 subtype (P<.0001) (Table 3) (Fig. 1).
Differences in Pathologic Stage Among
the Breast Cancer Subtypes
Data regarding pathologic stage were available for 257
patients who underwent surgery within 3 months of
biopsy. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
before surgery were not included in the staging analysis.
Pathologic disease stage did not appear to differ signifi-
cantly among the subtypes (Table 3).

accurately extracts mammographic findings from a large

techniques have been used to extract clinically useful

 study, NLP was used to confirm and validate previously
reported correlations. Specifically, we found that patients
with the ER 1 subtype were more likely to present with
spiculated margins than those with the HER21 and
TNBC subtypes. Spiculated margins are believed to be sec-
ondary to the intense stromal reaction and fibroblastic pro-
liferation observed in ER 1 tumors. Spiculated margins are
less common in TNBCs, which demonstrate a more infil-
trative tumor growth. Patients with HER21 tumors were
more likely to present with heterogeneous, linear, and pleo-
morphic calcifications. Calcification is postulated to be sec-
ondary to rapid growth and central necrosis.
The strength of the current study was the large vol-
ume of free text reports from a relevant patient population
captured in the enterprise data warehouse of the study in-
stitution and the use of NLP and data mining for auto-
mated data extraction, collection, and correlation. The
NLP algorithm of MOTTE surpasses the manual method
for information extraction in terms of consistency, time,
cost, and data preparation. NLP may provide an accurate
automated system with which to create large-scale data re-
positories of breast imaging findings and malignancies for
use in data mining in breast imaging. Secondary studies
are planned to apply our NLP algorithm to define distinct
characteristics of BI-RADS category 4 mammograms.
Such studies would help to refine biopsy recommenda-
tions, thereby decreasing health care costs and morbidity.
The current study was limited by the fact that it was
conducted at a single institution to assess the performance
of a single NLP algorithm. As a result, some of the
descriptors in the BI-RADS lexicon, especially those de-
scribing the distribution of calcifications, were not fre-
quently used. The use of BI-RADS terminology will
improve the ease of use and accuracy of the NLP applica-
tion. Another limitation was that the MOTTE program
was not coded to distinguish between multiple excisions
on the same side and bilateral excisions. Our future plan is
to modify the evaluations to allow the MOTTE program
to differentially extract excisional location (left side vs
right side). Finally, our sample size was determined by the
population of patients who underwent biopsy at the study
institution, which may have potentially introduced an
ascertainment bias into the analysis.
Conclusions
The current retrospective review of mammographic charac-
teristics based on information extracted from diagnostic
reports using the MOTTE NLP algorithm demonstrated
that mammographic features can be used to distinguish
breast cancer subtypes. NLP algorithms can narrow the gap
between the unstructured clinical reports and the detailed
information extraction needed for data mining and deci-
sion support tools. Future studies to apply MOTTE to cre-
ate a predictive model to drive evidence-based biopsy
decision making in clinical practice currently are underway.

Figure 1. Clinical findings found to be significantly correlated
with breast cancer subtype. Axillary lymphadenopathy was
more likely to be associated with the human epidermal

(HER21)
and
triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. A palpable lump

positive (ER1) subtype. Skin changes were more likely to be
observed among patients with the HER2 1 subtype compared
with those with the ER 1 and TNBC subtypes.
Figure 2. Mammographic findings found to be significantly
correlated with breast cancer subtype. Heterogeneous, linear,
and pleomorphic calcifications were more likely to be ob-
served with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-
positive
(HER21)
subtype
compared
with
the
estrogen
receptor-positive (ER1) and triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) subtypes. Spiculated margins occurred more fre-
quently in patients with the ER 1 subtype compared with
those with the HER2 1 and TNBC subtypes.
