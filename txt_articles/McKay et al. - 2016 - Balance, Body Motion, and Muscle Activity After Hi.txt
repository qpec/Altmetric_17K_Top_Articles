Abstract
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE—The objectives of this pilot study were to 1) evaluate the 
feasibility and investigate the efficacy of a 3-week, high volume (450 minutes/week) Adapted 
Tango intervention for community dwelling individuals with mild-moderate PD, and to 2) 
investigate the potential efficacy of Adapted Tango in modifying electromyographic (EMG) 
activity and center of body mass (CoM) displacement during automatic postural responses to 
support surface perturbations.
METHODS—Individuals with PD (n=26) were recruited for high volume Adapted Tango (15 
lessons, 1.5 hour each over 3 weeks). Twenty participants were assessed with clinical balance and 
gait measures before and after the intervention. Nine participants were also assessed with support-
surface translation perturbations.
RESULTS—Overall adherence to the intervention was 77%. At posttest, peak forward CoM 
displacement was reduced (4.0±0.9 cm, pretest, vs. 3.7±1.1 cm, posttest; P=0.03; Cohen’s d=0.30) 
and correlated to improvements on Berg Balance Scale (BBS; rho=−0.68; P=0.04) and Dynamic 
Gait Index (rho=−0.75; P=0.03). Overall antagonist onset time was delayed (27 ms; P=0.02; 
d=0.90) and duration was reduced (56 ms, ≈39%, P=0.02; d=0.45). Reductions in EMG 
magnitude were also observed (P<0.05).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS—Adherence was acceptable and improvements on 
clinical measures of balance and gait were comparable to that obtained with lower volume, 12-
week programs. Following participation in Adapted Tango, changes in kinematic and some EMG 
measures of perturbation responses were observed in addition to improvements in clinical

INTRODUCTION
Balance problems are common in Parkinson disease (PD) and are challenging to treat via 
pharmacotherapy or surgical interventions.1,2 Improvements on clinical measures of balance 
and gait have been demonstrated after several rehabilitative exercise programs for 
individuals with PD,3–6 including Adapted Tango dance.7,8 Adapted Tango elicits clinically-
measured balance improvements that are superior to exercise,9 non-partnered dance,7 other 
dance-based and martial arts-based interventions,10,11 no intervention,8,11 and health 
education.12 Recently, the importance of rehabilitation volume has received increased 
attention.13,14 In PD, high volume rehabilitation may be particularly effective, as individuals 
exhibit superior increases in gait speed after higher volume/low intensity exercise therapy 
(12 weeks, 150 minutes/week, 40%–50% of heart rate reserve) compared to lower volume/
high intensity exercise therapy (12 weeks, 90 minutes/week, 70%–80% of heart rate reserve) 
with comparable overall work.14 Further, exercise therapy of at least 180 minutes/week is 
required to improve gait speed in older adults.15 Recently, 450 minutes/week has been 
demonstrated to be the upper threshold of exercise volume (i.e., the sweet spot) required for 
lowered mortality risk (by 39%), compared to sedentary older adults.16 Previously, 
individuals with PD demonstrated functional improvements after two weeks of high volume 
(450 minutes/week) Adapted Tango training.17 Although these improvements are promising, 
it is unknown if longer-term therapy (i.e., 3 weeks) with similar volume is feasible and 
possibly more effective. Also, it is unknown whether clinical changes after Adapted Tango 
are associated with alterations in responses to postural perturbations assessed in a laboratory 
setting, a common paradigm in human neurophysiology research.18–20
Previous studies in populations other than PD suggest that improvements in clinical 
measures of balance after rehabilitation may be associated with improved kinematic and 
electromyographic measures during balance and gait.21–24 For example, three weeks of high 
volume (450 minutes/week) Tai Chi training advanced agonist muscle activation onset times 
and reduced co-contraction in response to support-surface perturbations during walking in 
mildly balance-impaired older adults whose balance had only slightly improved, as 
measured by a 2 point increase on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS).22 In individuals with post-
stroke hemiparesis, agility exercise therapy (10 weeks, 180 minutes/week) improved gait 
speed, and reduced muscle activation onset times in response to support-surface 
perturbations during standing.23 Locomotor rehabilitation also improved timing of ankle 
plantar flexors during gait in hemiparetic individuals (12 weeks, 120 minutes/week).24 
However, it is unknown whether changes in clinical measures after Adapted Tango, a dance-
based rehabilitation, which may address PD impairments through different mechanisms than

 Tai Chi and agility exercise, 25 would be associated with changes in muscle activity or 
kinematic measures during postural responses.
Electromyographic (EMG) and kinematic abnormalities during responses to support surface 
translation perturbations in PD18,20 differ from those of older adults22 and stroke 
survivors.23,24 During translation perturbations of the support surface, the center of mass is 
displaced and medium- (≥ 80 ms) and long-latency (≥ 100 ms) corrective responses are 
generated in leg and trunk muscles, referred to as the automatic postural response.19 Unlike 
the delayed responses in balance-impaired older adults22 and in individuals with post-stroke 
hemiparesis,23,24 in individuals with PD, automatic postural response onset latency is 
typically normal or earlier than normal in agonist muscles18 and typically earlier than 
normal in antagonist muscles, leading to inappropriate co-contraction.18,20 PD is also 
associated with increased total center of mass displacement during perturbation responses.26 
We initiated this investigation because, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have 
examined changes in postural responses in PD before and after Adapted Tango,.
The primary objectives of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility and investigate 
the efficacy of 3 weeks of high volume (450 minutes/week) Adapted Tango in improving 
clinical measures of balance and gait in community-dwelling individuals with PD. We 
performed a repeated measures observational study of high volume Adapted Tango with 
duration increased to 3 weeks to estimate adherence and investigate efficacy. We predicted 
that 1) three-week high volume Adapted Tango would be feasible for individuals with mild-
moderate PD, as demonstrated by adherence with a 95% confidence interval lower bound of 
≥60%, 2) clinical measures of balance and disease severity would improve from pretest to 
posttest, and be retained for at least one month, based on results from previous studies 
demonstrating retention for three months,8,12 and that 3) clinical measures would be stable 
over the 1 month before pretest, when tested in a subset of participants.
The secondary, exploratory, objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate postural responses 
before and after Adapted Tango to examine the feasibility of and utility of using kinematic 
and electromyographic outcome measures in this type of intervention. We allocated a 
convenience sample of intervention participants to receive additional perturbation response 
testing at pretest and posttest. Muscle onset time measurements have been demonstrated to 
be stable across multiple days in healthy young individuals 27 and across multiple months in 
individuals with PD.28 Thus, we determined that we would consider a randomized trial to be 
feasible and justified if we obtained preliminary efficacy evidence, as determined by 
reductions in CoM displacement or in antagonist muscle onset time, duration, or magnitude. 
In order to further investigate preliminary evidence of efficacy, we also examined 
associations between changes in clinical measures and changes in CoM displacement or in 
muscle activity measures after Adapted Tango.
METHODS
Study design
This study was a repeated measures, observational study without a control group. A double 
baseline procedure was employed to improve internal validity of clinical outcomes. Multiple

 post-test periods were used to assess stability of observed changes in clinical outcome 
measures. A convenience sample of study participants was allocated to additional 
perturbation testing before and after the intervention.
Participants and setting
Participants were recruited at PD outreach events, senior centers, and the Emory Movement 
Disorders clinic.. Participants met the following inclusion criteria: Hoehn & Yahr stage I-IV, 
diagnosis of “definite” idiopathic PD,29 age ≥ 35 years. Exclusion criteria were: deep brain 
stimulation, other significant comorbidities, or significant musculoskeletal impairment as 
determined by the investigators. Participants were observed for outcome measures on three 
separate occasions. All participants were assessed within one week before (pretest) and 
within one week after (posttest) the intervention. Participants recruited early in the trial 
(n=7) were assessed 1 month before the beginning of the intervention (one-month pretest) to 
establish a double baseline for these participants and examine stability of clinical measures. 
Participants recruited later in the trial (n=13) were observed in a follow up appointment, 1 
month after the intervention’s cessation (one-month post). The double baseline was 
conducted to examine the stability of measures between one-month pretest and pretest: a 
time period (~1 month) that was similar to the intervention time period of 3 weeks. The one-
month posttest (follow-up) was used to detect retention (or loss) of changes between posttest 
and one-month posttest also over a period of time that was similar to the interventional time 
period. Adapted Tango classes and clinical assessments were performed in a large 
multipurpose room on a university campus. Perturbation response assessments were 
performed in a dedicated balance laboratory elsewhere on campus. Participants provided 
written informed consent according to protocols approved by institutional review boards at 
Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology.
3-week high volume Adapted Tango intervention
Participants received high volume, moderate intensity Adapted Tango, taught by a 
professional dance instructor,30 and were to complete fifteen 90-minute Adapted Tango 
sessions in three weeks. Classes were designed to induce expenditure of ≥3 Metabolic 
Equivalents of Task (METs) per minute, as per estimates for typical ballroom dance, which 
is considered light-moderate intensity exercise by the United States Center for Disease 
Control.31 Classes began with standing warm-ups to upbeat music, and continued with 
dancing to commercial music selections. Participants spent equal time leading and following 
dance steps, performed in an adapted ballroom frame, holding forearms, and classes were 
progressive. (See Video Abstract, Supplemental Digital Content 1, for an example of the 
adapted ballroom frame.) Individuals with PD were coupled with individuals without PD. 
Participants spent 1/3 of class working on rhythmic entrainment to the beat during the warm-
ups, such as tapping of toes or heels, or sequentially opening and closing the hands. Further, 
the participants spent ample time (i.e., 20–30 minutes) simply walking to various tango 
rhythms intended to enhance their musicality, i.e., the ability to control the gait cycle in a 
more complex rhythm than typical gait. As in previous studies,7,9,10,12 participants were 
allowed to take breaks as needed throughout the classes in order to decrease fatigue.

 Outcome measures
Clinical balance and gait measures—Assessments were administered in the same 
order at each evaluation in order to minimize the effects of fatigue on measurements. 
Participants were assessed for general health, and were observed at each visit with clinical 
measures including: Parkinson’s disease severity (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale 
[UPDRS] motor subscale III32), dyskinesia (total of scores 0–4 for each limb and face), the 
Berg Balance Scale (BBS33), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI34), Fullerton Advanced Balance 
Scale (FAB35,36), the two-footed Jump test, a test of neuromuscular synergies and 
musculoskeletal health,37 6 minute walk test (6MWT38), functional reach (FR39), Single/
Dual Timed Up and Go (TUG34), fast and preferred gait speed and cadence were measured 
using a stopwatch over a 20′ path.40 The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence 
questionnaire (ABC41), and the Freezing of Gait questionnaire (FOG42) were also 
administered. FAB was recently validated in community-dwelling individuals with PD,36 
and was used to avoid BBS ceiling effects. For each participant, all assessments occurred at 
a standardized time of day coinciding with a self-determined optimal ON period to minimize 
pharmacologically-related motor fluctuations. Clinical balance and gait measures were 
performed by an experienced rehabilitation scientist or by trained research assistants. An 
experienced rehabilitation scientist certified by the Movement Disorders Society 
administered the UPDRS-III. To minimize the variability of individual UPDRS items, 
including the retropulsion test,43 the same rehabilitation scientist administered the exam at 
each observation. Clinical data were entered and cross-verified by research assistants.
Response to perturbation—A convenience sample of the study participants was 
allocated to receive additional perturbation response assessments within two weeks before 
(pretest) and within two weeks after (posttest) the intervention. These participants were 
assessed at a standardized time of day (either 9 AM or 1 PM) coinciding as closely as 
possibly to the participants’ self-determined ON time. While wearing a safety harness, 
participants stood with each foot on a 6-axis (3D ground-reaction forces and moments) force 
plate (OR6-6, AMTI, Watertown, MA) embedded in a custom perturbation platform that 
translated in the horizontal plane. They were instructed to cross their arms over their chest, 
to focus on a landscape scene 3 m ahead, and to maintain balance with their feet in place but 
to take protective steps if necessary. Three perturbations were induced in each of the forward 
(displacing the center of mass anterior towards the toes) and backward (displacing the center 
of mass posterior towards the heels) directions of body sway.19 These perturbations were 
induced within a set of 36 perturbations spanning all directions in the horizontal plane and 
delivered in random order. At pretest, three to six test perturbations were delivered to select 
the highest perturbation level each participant could maintain balance without stepping. 
These perturbations were excluded from analysis to control for startle effects.44 Participants 
PR7 and PR9 (“PR” designates “Perturbation Response”) used level 4 (peak displacement 
10 cm; peak velocity 20 cm/s; peak acceleration 0.2 g; 700 ms total duration); all others used 
level 3 (7.5 cm; 15 cm/s; 0.1 g; 700 ms). Self-selected stance width was measured at pretest 
and subsequently enforced at posttest. (See Video Abstract, Supplemental Digital Content 1, 
for video of the perturbation apparatus.)

 Platform kinematics, surface EMG, and ground-reaction forces were sampled at 1080 Hz 
and processed in Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Trials with stepping responses or 
arm movement were excluded from analysis. Ground reaction forces were low-pass filtered 
(100 Hz, third-order zero-lag Butterworth filter), and CoM acceleration in the medial-lateral 
and anterior-posterior directions was calculated by adding horizontal-plane ground reaction 
force components at each foot and dividing by participant mass (acceleration = force/
mass).19,45,46 Because estimates of CoM position from kinematic marker data were 
unreliable, we then integrated the acceleration twice, assuming zero initial velocity and zero 
initial displacement at the onset of the perturbation, to arrive at the displacement of the 
center of mass.47–51 Linear trends were removed from acceleration signals before integration 
to avoid introducing integration constants in velocity signals, and computed velocity and 
displacement signals were set to zero at perturbation onset to enforce the assumed initial 
conditions. Surface EMG (Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, CA) was collected from leg 
and trunk muscles, high-pass filtered (35 Hz, third-order zero-lag Butterworth filter), 
demeaned, rectified, and low-pass filtered (40 Hz).48,52,53 EMG was analyzed from ankle 
muscles tibialis anterior (TA) and medial gastrocnemius (MG), recorded bilaterally.22,54 
During backward sway, agonist TA is lengthened and antagonist MG is shortened. During 
forward sway, agonist MG is lengthened and atagonist TA is shortened. To minimize 
variability in electrode placement between pretest and posttest silver/silver chloride disc 
electrodes were placed at 2-cm interelectrode distance according to standard EMG electrode 
placement guidelines19,55 by the same experimenter at each assessment. EMG records from 
each trial were normalized to the maximum value observed during each assessment after 
averaging across similar trials and across 50 ms bins.
Before statistical analysis, computed CoM displacement signals in the anterior-posterior 
direction and normalized EMG signals from each recorded muscle were averaged across 
similar trials for each participant at each assessment. The peak of each average CoM 
displacement signal was calculated. Onset and offset times of each average EMG signal 
were calculated with a computer program and corrected as necessary (14 records, ≈11%). 
For each average EMG signal, the first sample within a window between 80 ms and 300 ms 
after perturbation onset to cross a threshold of M + 6 × SD was first identified. Onset time 
was then determined as the last sample prior to the threshold-crossing sample for which the 
preceding 10 samples were all below M + 2 × SD. Offset time was determined as the first 
sample subsequent to the threshold-crossing sample for which the following 10 samples 
were all below M + 2 × SD. To avoid including responses to platform deceleration,54 offset 
times were truncated to the earlier of 280 ms after EMG onset or 450 ms after perturbation 
onset. The duration of each average EMG signal was calculated as offset time - onset time. 
The magnitude of each average EMG signal was calculated by averaging over a window 80–
450 ms after perturbation onset after removing background level.18,20 After all processing, 
kinematic and electromyographic data of each participant were summarized as a dataset 
containing 13 variables (CoM displacement, one variable, and 3 variables [Onset, Duration, 
and Magnitude] for each of the 4 muscles analyzed [TA from the left and right leg and MG 
from the left and right leg], for a total of 13 variables) for each level of the independent 
variables Time [pretest, posttest], Perturbation Direction [forward, backward], and 
Perturbation Level [3, 4]).

 Sample size
Sample size for the intervention (n=26) was selected to achieve effect sizes in clinical 
balance and gait measures comparable to a previous 2-week intervention (conducted with 
n=14)17 after allowing for ~40% attrition given the longer term of the intervention. Sample 
size for the group of participants allocated to postural response testing (n=10) was selected 
based on previous literature demonstrating the feasibility of identifying effects of interest in 
electromyographic and kinematic measurements of individuals with PD in cross-sectional56 
and longitudinal57 studies.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses and effect sizes—Descriptive statistics were calculated for all 
outcomes at each timepoint. Magnitude effect sizes representing changes from pretest to 
posttest was calculated with Cohen’s d,58 which describes the difference in means scaled to 
units of standard deviation, in this case taken from pretest.
Sampling and stability of clinical measures at pretest—To test that participants 
allocated to perturbation response testing represented an unbiased sample of the study 
population, baseline demographic characteristics were compared between perturbation 
response participants and the rest of the study participants with 1-way Analyses of Variance 
(ANOVAs) (Group [allocation to perturbation response testing vs. non-allocation to 
perturbation response testing]) or Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVAs on ranks for 
nonparametric data. To establish test-retest stability of clinical balance and gait measures in 
this cohort, intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated between one-month pretest 
(screening) and pretest. Intra-class correlation coefficient values > 0.75 and > 0.40 were 
characterized as “excellent” and “fair to good,” respectively.
Statistical analyses of changes in clinical measures across pretest, posttest, 
and follow-up—To investigate the efficacy of the intervention in improving clinical 
measures of balance and gait, repeated measures ANOVAs (Time [pretest, posttest, follow-
up]), with Holms-Sidak post hoc tests determined significance of changes in clinical 
measures between pretest, posttest, and follow-up. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections to 
degrees of freedom were applied when sphericity was violated as per Mauchly’s Test. The 
last observation was carried forward in cases of missing data. Additional paired t-tests on 
individual UPDRS-III items and on average tremor score (the average of the scores of items 
III.20 and III.21; cf.59) were performed post-hoc to identify items that changed from pretest 
to posttest.
Statistical analyses of changes in postural responses from pretest to posttest
—To investigate the potential efficacy of the intervention in altering CoM displacement and 
muscle activity during perturbation responses, separate repeated measures ANOVAs (Time 
[pretest, posttest], with Perturbation Level [3, 4] included as a covariate) were initially run. 
Perturbation level was entered as a covariate in these analyses to control for the potential 
effects of perturbation level on CoM displacement and muscle activity demonstrated in 
previous studies.19,27 No statistical testing of differences between perturbation level 3 and 4 
was performed. These ANOVAs determined the significance of changes in peak CoM

 displacement and in onset time, duration, and magnitude of each recorded muscle (TA-L, 
TA-R, MG-L, MG-R) in each perturbation direction.
Changes in postural responses based on pooled EMG data—Secondary 
univariate ANOVAs were also conducted on EMG variables onset time, duration, and 
magnitude after recoding data from individual muscles as either TA or MG, or as agonist or 
antagonist. In these analyses: 1) Data from TA-L and TA-R were pooled for analysis as 
“TA,” and data from MG-L and MG-R were pooled for analysis as “MG.” Secondary 
ANOVAs (Time [pretest, posttest] × Perturbation Level [3, 4] × Participant [1–9]; with 
Participant as a nested factor within Perturbation Level, and a Time × Participant interaction 
term) were then conducted to determine significance of changes in onset time, duration, and 
magnitude of TA and MG in each perturbation direction. 2) Data from MG during forward 
CoM perturbations and from TA during backward CoM perturbations were pooled for 
analysis as “agonists,” and data from TA during forward CoM perturbations and from MG 
during backward CoM perturbations were pooled for analysis as “antagonists.” Secondary 
ANOVAs (Time [pretest, posttest] × Perturbation Level [3, 4] × Participant [1–9]; with 
Participant as a nested factor within Perturbation Level, and a Time × Participant interaction 
term) were then conducted to determine significance of changes in onset time, duration, and 
magnitude of agonists and antagonists.
Associations between changes in clinical measures and changes in postural 
responses—To test whether improvements in clinical measures of balance function after 
Adapted Tango were associated with alterations in perturbation responses, and to detect 
possible evidence of efficacy of the intervention in altering CoM displacement and muscle 
activity during perturbation responses, associations between changes on BBS, FAB, and 
DGI and changes in perturbation response measures were determined with Spearman’s 
correlation coefficients in a complete-case analysis. Statistical analyses were performed 
using IBM SPSS 20 software and SAS University Edition. All tests were performed with 2 
tails and considered significant at P < 0.05. Summary statistics are reported as M ± SD 
unless otherwise noted.
RESULTS
Participant flow and recruitment
A flow-chart of participants through the study is presented in Figure 1. Twenty-six 
participants were recruited for the trial. Of these, 4 withdrew before pretest assessment 
(family/health issues, n=1; lack of interest, n=1; loss of contact/unknown, n=1). These 
individuals were excluded from analyses of outcome measures as no data were available, but 
they were included in estimates of adherence to the intervention. Of the remaining 22 
participants, 2 participants withdrew before posttest (family/health issues, n=1; scheduling 
difficulties, n=1); all others completed all planned assessments. Adherence to the 
intervention exceeded previously expected targets (20/26 observed vs. 15/26 expected), 
providing evidence that 3-week high volume Adapted Tango is feasible. Overall adherence 
to the intervention was 77%, with 95% confidence interval (61%, 93%). Adherence was 
higher among those who attended at least 1 class (91% [95% CI 78%–100%]). Posttest and

 one-month post data were unavailable for participants who withdrew before posttest (n=2). 
One-month post data were not collected for those (n=7) allocated to one-month pretest 
(screening) assessments. Participants who completed at least one clinical assessment were 
invited to participate in postural response assessments until the Adapted Tango intervention 
began and enrollment for additional testing was closed. Nine participants were enrolled in 
postural response testing. Demographic characteristics of the 22 participants included in the 
final analysis (68% female, 65.4 ± 12.8 years) are summarized in Table 1. Detailed 
characteristics of the 9 participants allocated to additional postural response testing are 
summarized in Table 2.
During the study no adverse events or deviations from the intervention were observed. Two 
small deviations from the perturbation response assessment protocol occurred. In one 
participant (PR1) self-selected stance width was not correctly enforced. This participant 
used a 9.5 cm wider stance width at posttest. These data were retained in analyses as stance 
width minimally affects forward and backward perturbations.18 Due to equipment failure, 
only MG recorded from the right leg (MG-R) was available at posttest for participants PR4, 
PR5, and PR6. Adapted Tango classes and all assessments were conducted from August 
through October 2011.
Baseline data
At pretest, no significant effects of Group (allocated to perturbation response testing vs. not 
allocated to perturbation response testing) were identified in age, sex, height, weight, disease 
duration, UPDRS-III, Hoehn and Yahr stage, or dyskinesia score. Correlational analyses 
showed very strong correlations between FAB and BBS (r=0.81; P <0.001) and between 
FAB and DGI (r=0.87; P<0.001). Test-retest analyses demonstrated that clinical measures 
were stable over the month before treatment, with “excellent” intra-class correlation 
coefficient values (>0.75) obtained for BBS (0.93), DGI (0.90), FR (0.79), ABC (0.94), and 
FOG (0.88) and intra-class correlation coefficients characterized as “fair to good” (>0.4) 
obtained for 6MWT (0.60).
Clinical measures
Descriptive statistics, change scores, and effect sizes for all clinical measures are tabulated 
in Table 3. At posttest, scores increased on BBS, (P<0.01), FAB (P<0.001), and DGI 
(P=0.01) (Figure 2). All significant increases at posttest remained significant at one-month 
post testing in post-hoc tests (BBS, P<0.001, FAB, P<0.001, DGI, P=0.04). Participants also 
increased preferred and fast cadence (preferred, P<0.01; fast, P=0.03) and exhibited 
decreased UPDRS-III (motor subscale) total scores (P<0.01) from pretest to follow-up. 
Paired t-tests performed post-hoc on individual UPDRS-III items identified significant 
improvements on postural stability (item III.30; 0.95±0.58, pretest, vs. 0.60±0.68, posttest, 
M±SD, P=0.03), and speech (item III.1; 1.18±0.73, pretest vs. 1.00±0.79, posttest; P=0.02). 
No changes were observed on 6MWT (P=0.11), FR (P=0.48), ABC (P=0.22), FOG 
(P=0.38), gait speed (preferred, P=0.69; fast, P=0.18), Jump (P=0.06) or TUG (P=0.30).

 Postural responses
Changes in postural responses from pretest to posttest—Descriptive statistics 
and effect sizes for kinematic and individual EMG measures are tabulated in Table 4. At 
posttest, CoM displacement was reduced during forward CoM perturbations (P=0.03) and 
unchanged during backward CoM perturbations (P=0.39) (Figure 3). Initial analyses of 
individual muscles revealed significant reductions in TA-L magnitude (P=0.02) and MG-R 
magnitude (P=0.01) during forward CoM perturbations and no statistically significant 
changes in onset, duration, or magnitude of any individual muscles during backward CoM 
perturbations.
Secondary analyses using pooled EMG data—Descriptive statistics and effect sizes 
for pooled EMG measures are tabulated in Table 5. Secondary analyses of EMG data pooled 
across legs revealed significant delays in TA onset time (forward CoM perturbations, 
P=0.04; backward, P=0.03), TA duration (forward, P=0.02), and MG onset time (backward, 
P<0.01). Secondary analyses of EMG data pooled across legs and across perturbation 
directions revealed significant delays in antagonist onset time (27 ms; P=0.02), agonist onset 
time (10 ms, P<0.05), and a significant reduction in antagonist duration (56 ms, ≈39%, 
P=0.02).
Associations between clinical changes and changes in postural perturbations
Significant correlations were identified between reductions in forward CoM displacement 
and increased BBS scores (rho =−0.68; P=0.04) and DGI (rho=−0.75; P=0.03). No 
significant correlations were identified between increased BBS scores and delayed 
antagonist onset times (rho=0.78; P=0.07), between reductions in forward CoM 
displacement and increased FAB scores (rho=−0.49; P=0.19), nor between changes in 
backward CoM displacement and improvements in BBS (rho=0.37; P=0.33), FAB 
(rho=0.52; P=0.15), or DGI (rho=0.21; P=0.62).
DISCUSSION
The low attrition observed here (2/22 participants who began the intervention) and 
improvements observed in these individuals with mild-moderate PD on clinical measures of 
balance, gait, and disease severity after 3-week, high volume Adapted Tango demonstrate 
the program volume is feasible and may have efficacy comparable to longer programs with 
similar total doses. This pilot study is the first to measure automatic postural responses 
before and after Adapted Tango. In convenience sample of the study participants, we 
observed reductions in forward CoM displacement and changes in some measures of EMG 
magnitude and timing after Adapted Tango. Based on this, we consider a subsequent 
randomized Adapted Tango trial with kinematic and electromyographic outcome measures 
to be feasible and justified.
Benefits and feasibility of high volume exercise in persons with PD
High volume exercise (> 180 minutes/week) is necessary to improve older adults’ gait 
speed.15 We observed overall adherence to the high volume intervention of 77%, with 95% 
confidence interval 61%–93%, achieving the stated primary feasibility criterion of 60% and

 demonstrating that 3-week, high volume Adapted Tango is feasible in this population. After 
the intervention, we observed improvements in measures of disease severity and balance 
(changes: UPDRS, 2.9; BBS, 3.8) comparable to a previous 2-week high volume Adapted 
Tango trial (UPDRS, 4.6; BBS 2.8)17 and to two previous longer duration trials (i.e., 20 
hours over 13 weeks: UPDRS, 1.6; BBS, 3.9; 20 hours over 10 weeks: BBS, 3.6).7,10 
Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) have not been established for many of the 
outcome measures used in this population. However, clinically significant changes were 
observed in UPDRS-III (2.9 points vs. MCID 2.560) and marginally-significant changes 
were observed in DGI (1.8 points vs. MCID 1.9 in community-dwelling older adults61). 
While these results ostensibly support the benefits of the program, it is important to be 
extremely cautious in any interpretation. The results of this pilot study will require 
replication with a more appropriately powered sample size. Although the participants 
exhibited a 3.4 point improvement on BBS, this change is below the MCID of 7 points 
established in older adults with balance impairments62 and also below the Minimal 
Detectable Change (MDC) of 5 points established in individuals with PD. This cohort was 
relatively higher functioning than the reference population for the MDCs determined for the 
BBS in PD (49.3 ± 6.4 vs. 42 ± 11.2); therefore, there may have been some ceiling effects 
on this measure. Improvements were observed on the more challenging but lesser used FAB, 
and small improvements were observed in the postural stability UPDRS-III item (0.35 
points, comparable to the difference observed in this item between the OFF and ON 
medication states63). However, clearly a similar cohort would need to be recruited and 
examined in comparison to a control group to make definitive conclusions about the efficacy 
of this high volume but short term dose of Adapted Tango. Vigorous ongoing exercise that 
increases heart rate and oxygen uptake could be neuroprotective for individuals with PD;64 
however, high volume/low intensity exercise therapy may be superior to low volume/high 
intensity exercise therapy for changes in gait speed.14 We noted sustained gains 1 month 
after the high volume Adapted Tango treatment ended, consistent with prior work 
demonstrating gains maintained over one month,7 and three months,12 after intervention 
cessation. The 3-week Adapted Tango protocol may be useful in crossover designs that can 
be completed in a short overall time frame, which is beneficial for academic research studies 
that rely on student volunteer personnel over the course of an academic semester.
Electromyographic and kinematic measures from support-surface perturbation as 
rehabilitation outcome measures
Based on the observed reductions in forward CoM displacement and changes in antagonist 
onset and duration, we consider a subsequent randomized trial of Adapted Tango with 
kinematic and electromyographic outcome measures to be feasible and justified. Given the 
limited sample size, the observed changes in muscle activity could be attributed to chance in 
many cases. However, average effect sizes observed in individual muscle analyses were 
moderate (average effect size 0.50), and generally comparable to those observed in UPDRS-
III (0.47), BBS (0.59), FAB (0.56), and DGI (0.53). Particularly because effect sizes are less 
susceptible to the influence of small sample sizes than P-values, we interpret these results as 
evidence that electromyographic and kinematic measures would be feasible and potentially 
useful when applied in a larger sample in this type of intervention. Associations between 
changes in clinical measures observed after the intervention and changes in kinematic

 measures provided additional evidence that laboratory-assessed balance measures are 
feasible as objective rehabilitative outcomes for Adapted Tango.
Generalizability
The feasibility results obtained here appear generalizable to subsequent controlled trials 
without substantial modifications to the basic protocol. We anticipate that a subsequent 
randomized trial would test the hypothesis that CoM displacement would be reduced and 
automatic postural response onset latency would be delayed from pretest to posttest after 
Adapted Tango, compared to standard care. The following modifications could improve the 
precision of subsequent studies. A reduced number of clinical outcomes, all collected at the 
same visit as postural response testing, would improve the precision of correlational 
analyses and reduce the potential for fatigue effects. The postural stability UPDRS item has 
known limitations in discriminating fallers from non-fallers63 and lower inter-rater reliability 
than tests including the Push and Release test.43 Balance outcome measures should be 
evaluated carefully to improve external validity and to reduce participant burden. At posttest, 
we did not observe reductions in backward CoM displacement, despite reductions in forward 
CoM displacement, altered antagonist activity, and improved postural stability as measured 
by the UPDRS. This may reflect the increased difficulty and fewer biomechanical strategies 
available to recover balance when falling backward in individuals with PD, who are 
particularly unstable during backward sway.20,65 Overall, the number of trials delivered in 
which a foot, heel, or toe lift or arm flailing occurred was reduced from 31% at pretest to 
23% at posttest, suggesting that perturbations in both directions were less challenging at 
posttest, possibly due to altered postural strategies that were not captured in our analyses of 
CoM displacement. A more complete kinematic and kinetic dataset including variables such 
as center of pressure and stability margin65 should be collected in order to better 
characterize postural strategies during perturbation responses and investigate this 
asymmetric response. As posterior perturbation responses and the UPDRS postural stability 
item are correlated in the practically-defined 12-hour OFF,65 but not in the ON,66 
medication state, testing should be performed in the practically-defined 12-hour OFF state to 
improve the precision of correlational analyses66 and the discriminatory ability of clinical 
measures.63,67
Limitations
This pilot study has several limitations that should be addressed in subsequent controlled 
trials. Caution should be used in interpreting these results, given the reported small effect 
sizes of most measures, the potential for Type II error and the lack of a control group. 
Further, the small sample size left the study underpowered. Although we provide test-retest 
reliability findings that demonstrate stability of clinical mobility measures within these 
individuals with PD, the absence of a parallel control group for electromyographic and 
kinematic measures prevents us from attributing changes in these measures to the effects of 
the intervention. The study used a large number of outcomes, which increases the likelihood 
of chance findings. In particular, a plausible mechanism for Adapted Tango in improving 
speech (UPDRS-III item 1) is unknown. PD is most often associated with hypokinetic 
dysarthria attributed to decreased range of motion in the speech mechanism.68 We observed 
improved preferred and fast cadence after the intervention, as well as improved speech –

 these changes may reflect a common underlying mechanism. However, it is also possible 
that this unexpected finding is spurious, and should be interpreted with caution. The study 
also used a convenience sample of participants for postural response outcome measures. 
Although these participants did not differ in demographic measures from the other 
participants in the study, unknown selection biases limit the generalizability of these 
findings. Since the Adapted Tango classes represent a form of group exercise, in future 
studies it would be valuable to assess changes in measures of social participation.71
CONCLUSIONS
These results demonstrate that a 3-week, high volume Adapted Tango rehabilitative 
intervention is feasible for individuals with mild-moderate PD and that randomized Adapted 
Tango trials using laboratory-assessed measures of postural responses are feasible and 
justified.

Examples of center of mass (CoM) displacement and muscle activity during automatic 
postural responses to forward (above) and backward (below) perturbations before and after 
the intervention. From left to right in each row, a cartoon describing perturbation direction, 
exemplar data of one participant at pretest and posttest, and group data across participants 
are shown. Shaded regions in exemplar data plots designate area under average EMG curves 
80 ms – 450 ms after perturbation onset. Note scale is reversed for antagonist muscles, and 
absolute CoM displacement is shown as positive for both perturbation directions. Bars and 
error bars in group data designate M ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01; ANOVA.
