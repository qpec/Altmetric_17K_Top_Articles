Study Objectives: To measure differences in functional status between men and women presenting with sleep-related health problems.
Methods: A retrospective clinical audit of 744 Australian patients across 7 private general practices between April 2013 and January 2015 was conducted. 
Patients completed an electronic survey as part of their routine consultation, which included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Functional Outcomes 
of Sleep Questionnaire 10 (FOSQ-10), and other questions relating to the effect of their sleep problem. The proportion of males and females with ESS and 
FOSQ-10 scores associated with disorders of daytime sleepiness and burden of symptoms due to sleepiness, respectively, were compared, as well as 
reported differences between the sexes in memory, concentration, issues with relationships, feeling depressed, and trouble sleeping.
Results: On presentation, females were more likely to have sleeping disorders associated with daytime sleepiness (median ESS score of 9 for females 
versus 8 for males, P = .038; proportion ESS > 9 was 49.0% for females versus 36.9% for males, P = .003). Women were also more likely to report an 
increased burden of symptoms due to sleepiness compared to men, as shown by lower FOSQ-10 scores (P < .001). Secondary outcome measures showed 
that females were more likely to feel excessively tired and depressed, have difficulties with memory and concentration, and have trouble sleeping at 
night. Snoring kept partners awake in roughly the same proportion of males and females, and a larger proportion of the partners of males were forced out 
of the room.
Conclusions: Sleep-related health issues both manifest in and affect the lives of males and females differently. Sleep health professionals should recognize 
these differences on all levels of disease prevention and health promotion from patient education, to diagnosis and management to improve quality of life for 
those with sleep-related health problems.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep disorders significantly affect a patient’s health and well-
being. Sleep-related problems and sleep deficiency can cause 
excessive daytime sleepiness, affect mood and concentration, 
increase the risk of motor vehicle accidents, and lessen one’s 
ability to work effectively and safely.1–3 Sleep disorders also 
can cause a range of neurological, cardiovascular, and men-
tal health problems.1 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most 
common sleep disorder, is associated with hypertension, car-
diovascular disease, and stroke.1–4 However, sleep disorders do 
not exclusively affect the patient and their health. People who 
snore often disrupt their partner’s sleep, leading to relationship 
issues and intimacy problems. In addition to significant per-
sonal and social burden, these factors contribute to an increase 
in health care resource utilization.5
A large body of evidence suggests that sleep disorders, 
particularly OSA, manifest differently in males and fe-
males.3,4,6 These differences exist most notably in the prev-
alence, pathophysiology, signs, symptoms, and severity of 
the disease.3,6 Snoring prevalence increases for females in 
later life, particularly after menopause.7 The reasons for such 
differences are still debated, but are attributed to hormonal 
influences, anatomical and physiological differences in the

Differences are also seen in the way that OSA is managed. 
The ratio of males to females attending sleep laboratories has 
been reported to be between 8:1 and 10:1, despite the ratio of 
cases being estimated at between 2:1 and 3:1.3,7 Traditionally, 
sleep research has predominantly been conducted in male 
populations,3 and consequent evaluative, diagnostic, and man-
agement guidelines have been formulated based on such re-
search. It is postulated that females present with nonspecific 
symptoms that differ from classic symptomatology.4,9 Conse-

BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Men and women experience 
sleep-related health problems differently in terms of symptomatology, 
prevalence, and pathophysiology. The main aim of this study was to 
understand the difference in functional status between sexes when 
they present to general practitioners.
Study Impact: Our research shows that men and women do have 
different functional status on presentation to general practitioners. 
A larger proportion of women reported issues with depression, 
trouble sleeping, concentration, memory, and effect on relationships 
compared to men.

as depression.4 This sex bias may account for some of the un-
derdiagnosis and mismanagement of OSA in females.3 Other 
explanations include that females may present less frequently 
because of the social stigma associated with snoring, as it de-
fies the typical feminine stereotype, or that snoring is more 
severe in males.4
Prior research has investigated specific pathophysiologic 
differences between males and females; however, sex differ-
ences in functional status and quality of life for patients living 
with sleep-related health problems have not been well investi-
gated.3 Yin and Davidson argue the importance of functional 
status because it is valued by the patients themselves and is a 
component of outcome management.4 It informs management 
and treatment, and may enable more patient-centered care. As 
such, they suggest the need for more research addressing this 
component of sleep medicine. For sleep researchers, it also 
provides insight into the differences that go beyond the patho-
physiology of sleep-related problems.
The current study aims to explore the functional status of 
males and females presenting to a general practitioner. Re-
search of this nature has the potential to contribute to better 
understanding, identification, and treatment of differing se-
verities of disease.3 It also highlights the effect of sleep-related 
issues in Australia, and demonstrates the importance of sleep 
health as an emerging medical discipline for general practitio-
ners, researchers, and the community alike.10
METHODS
This study was a retrospective clinical audit of 744 patients who 
attended 8 general practitioners across 7 private general prac-
tices in 2 states (Queensland and New South Wales) in Australia 
for sleep-related health care between April 2013 and January 
2015. Ethics approval, which included a waiver of consent, was 
obtained from Bond University HREC in Queensland (RO1891).
General practitioners received specialized training in sleep 
health care as part of a Royal Australian College of General 
Practitioners-accredited course. This training educated the 
general practitioners in sleep health, extending their history, 
physical examination, investigation, and management skills 
that go beyond the standard curriculum. General practitioners 
were trained in sleep hygiene, interpreting sleep studies and 
a more thorough physical examination including a nasendo-
scopic examination of the upper airway. With the assistance of 
an upskilled technician (often a nurse), the general practitio-
ners initiate, educate, and monitor patients on therapies such 
as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. After 
training, general practitioners designated a specific portion of 
their practice time to sleep health care as part of an enterprise 
called SleepGP. Patients seen by general practitioners, but who 
were not designated SleepGP patients, were not used in this 
research. See Appendix 1 for a description of the Australian 
sleep referral population.
Patient records were collated based on convenience sam-
pling; all patients presenting to general practices as SleepGP 
patients, who completed an electronic health care record 
and associated surveys, were included in the analysis. Three 
patients were excluded because information on their sex was 
not available.
Patient records were completed electronically using Sloom 
(Version 1, 2012, SleepGP, Coolangatta, QLD Australia), a 
software program specifically designed for sleep-related health 
care. Patients completed a comprehensive questionnaire related 
to their sleep health as part of a sleep-related consultation. As 
part of the Sloom questionnaire, patients answered questions 
relating to the their general medical history, family history of 
sleep disorders, sleep hygiene, and presence of comorbidities 
and completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Snor-
ing Severity Scale (SSS), and the Functional Outcomes of Sleep 
Questionnaire 10 (FOSQ-10). Questionnaires were completed 
by patients to aid diagnosis and management and not primarily 
for research purposes. Height, weight, and neck circumference 
measurements were taken and recorded by practice nurses. 
General practitioners reported that most of their patients came 
from their existing practice; however, a small proportion pre-
sented after seeing sleep-related advertising or were referred 
from other general practitioners and sleep physicians.
The data were analyzed with the goal of highlighting the 
differences between males and females in a population seeking 
sleep-related health care in a primary setting. Consequently, 
each variable examined was stratified by sex. ESS scores were 
further categorized into two groups (> 9 or ≤ 9). Scores higher 
than 9 tend to be associated with sleeping disorders that are 
known to affect daytime sleepiness.11 Weaver et al. previously 
used a cutoff of 17.9 to indicate an increased burden of symp-
toms due to sleepiness using the FOSQ,12 and this value was 
adopted in the current study for the FOSQ-10, given that it has 
been established that FOSQ-10 performs in a manner similar to 
that of the complete version of FOSQ.13 For the FOSQ-10, data 
were further categorized into the groups ≥ 18 and < 18. The 
latter category indicates an increased burden of symptoms due 
to sleepiness. Incomplete questionnaires were not considered 
in final analysis.
Responses to three specific questions on the FOSQ-10 were 
also examined individually. These questions were: 
• “Do you have difficulty concentrating on the things 
you do because you are sleepy or tired?”
• “Do you generally have difficulty remembering things 
because you are sleepy or tired?”
• “Has your relationship with family, friends or work 
colleagues been affected because you are sleepy or 
tired?”
Responses to the following freestanding questions were also 
examined:
• “Do you feel excessively tired or sleepy in the 
daytime?” 
• “Do you often have trouble getting to sleep at night?”
• “Do you feel depressed?”
• “Does your snoring keep your partner awake?”
• “If you have a partner, has snoring forced one of you 
out of the room?”
Sleep health-related electronic health records were centralized 
and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version

22.0, 2013, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). 
FOSQ-10 and ESS scores were graded and the median scores 
of each sex category were calculated because the data were not 
normally distributed. To test for evidence of a difference in me-
dian FOSQ-10 and ESS scores between males and females, the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. Two separate chi-square tests 
were performed to test for evidence of a difference in propor-
tion of male and female FOSQ-10 scores < 18 and the propor-
tion of ESS scores > 9. To avoid issues of multiplicity, statistical 
tests were only performed on these primary outcome measures.
RESULTS
For data regarding the age, body mass index (BMI), median 
ESS scores, median FOSQ-10 scores, and severity classifica-
tions for the study population, see Table 1.
For data regarding excessive tiredness, concentration, mem-
ory, trouble sleeping, and feelings of depression, see Table 2.
Effect on Relationships (Table 3)
Of the 744 patients, age was recorded for 98.9% of patients 
(n = 736). BMI was recorded for 94.4% of participants (n = 702); 
82.7% of patients completed the FOSQ-10 (n = 615). We found 
that there was no statistical difference in age (P = .47), BMI 
(P = .2), and sex (P = .6) between those who did and did not 
complete the FOSQ-10. However, there was a statistically sig-
nificant difference in the proportion of patients who reported 
an ESS higher than 9 among those who did and did not com-
plete the FOSQ-10 (26.3%, n = 15 vs. 41.9%, n = 257, P = .02).
There was very strong evidence of a difference in median 
FOSQ-10 scores between males and females (P < .001). There 
was very strong evidence of a difference in proportion of fe-
male and male patients whose FOSQ-10 scores were less than 
18 (P < .001, χ21 = 21.23).
There was evidence of a difference in median ESS scores 
between males and females (P = .038). There was strong evi-
dence of a different in proportion of males and female who had 
ESS scores > 9 (χ21 = 8.61, P = .003).
Of those who reported that their snoring was keeping their 
partner awake (n = 397), 60.4% (n = 240) then also said that it 
had forced one partner of the couple out of the room. When 
comparing by sex, 53.7% of females (n = 51) who reported 
keeping their partner awake also reported forcing either them-
selves or their partners out of the room, whereas this was the 
case for 62.8% of males (n = 189).
DISCUSSION
The mean age of the participants was 52.7 years, which sug-
gests that people tend to present for sleep problems later in life. 
Although females made up only one-third of the study popula-
tion, these estimates mirror the 2:1 ratio of cases reported by 
Larsson et al.7
The mean BMI for this sample was 31.5 kg/m2, which is just 
above the lower limit for class 1 obesity and was the same for 
both sexes. Obesity is a strong risk factor for OSA6 and there-
fore this demonstrates that in a health care-seeking population, 
there is a need for weight management regardless of sex.

Epworth Sleepiness Scale
ESS scores > 9 are associated with sleeping disorders known 
to affect daytime sleepiness.11 Although it was hypothesized 
that those presenting would have ESS scores associated with 
sleep issues (> 9), the median scores were 8 for males and 
9 for females. There was evidence of a statistical difference 
in mean ESS scores between males and females (P = .038); 
however, a difference of one unit has little clinical signifi-
cance. It could be inferred that a significant proportion of 
patients within this category sought sleep health care either 
before the disease had serious effects on daytime sleepiness 
or for reasons other than excessive daytime somnolence, 
such as snoring. However, when comparing the proportion of 
those affected, the results tell a different story. Although the 
median ESS scores were similar, the proportion of patients 
presenting with ESS scores associated with sleepiness pro-
vided better insight into the sex breakdown of those with 
scores more likely to indicate disease. Therefore, the propor-
tions may have been a better measure in this dataset due to 
the data distribution.
By proportion, there was strong evidence that females were 
more likely to have an ESS score associated with sleeping 
disorders linked with daytime sleepiness (> 9) compared to 
males (χ21 = 8.61, P = .003). Almost half of females (49.0%) ob-
tained a score > 9 compared to 36.2% of males. This suggests 
women are more likely to present with a sleeping disorder 
associated with daytime sleepiness. Alternatively, this could 
represent a difference in responses between sexes, as Chervin 
and Aldrich demonstrated that after adjusting for disease se-
verity and age, males consistently predicted a two-point-lower

ESS score.14 Conversely, Baldwin et al.15 observed a reduced 
likelihood of having an ESS score associated with sleepiness 
in females despite reporting similar rates of sleepiness.4 Bald-
win et al. concluded that the ESS may be more sensitive for 
males.15 Lin et al. also suggest that the ways in which women 
report feelings of sleepiness is different than that of men.4 
However, in this sample, 65.5% of males and 77.3% of females 
reported feeling excessively tired or sleepy in the daytime 
showing, that approximately 30% of participants in each sex 
category reported feeling excessively tired but did not have 
ESS scores > 9.
FOSQ-10
In the current study population, there was evidence of a dif-
ference in median FOSQ-10 score between males and females 
(P < .001), whereas women had a median score of 15. This 
was lower than the median score of 16.5 observed for males 
(Table 1). This suggests that females have an increased bur-
den of symptoms due to sleepiness compared to males. There 
was also evidence of a difference in the proportion of males 
and females with FOSQ-10 scores < 18 (P = .001, χ21 = 21.23). 
The proportion of males with FOSQ-10 scores < 18 was 69.2% 
compared to 87.8% of females. This suggest that females are 
more likely to have increased burden of symptoms due to sleep-
iness, which is consistent with what has been reported in other 
studies. Other research has demonstrated that females reported 
lower perceived health status and poorer functional status, as 
measured by the FOSQ-10, compared to males with similar 
OSA severity.3
Excessive Tiredness
As outlined earlier in this article, 77.3% of females reported 
feeling excessively tired or sleepy in the daytime compared 
to 65.5% of males (Table 2). It is plausible that more females 
experience excessive tiredness or sleepiness before present-
ing because the symptoms of the disease are worse in females, 
or females delay seeking sleep-related health care until their 
symptoms are noticeably worse. Larsson et al. reported that 
female snorers reported more daytime sleepiness than male 
snorers, which would suggest the former.7 The current findings 
are limited in their ability to clarify this concept and should be 
repeated using polysomnography results as a confirmation of 
disease severity. However, at presentation, regardless of under-
lying cause, the evidence suggests that women are more likely 
to experience excessive daytime tiredness or sleepiness.
Concentration and Memory
In both males and females, the majority of participants re-
ported some degree of difficulty concentrating due to tired-
ness or sleepiness. However, there was a much greater 
proportion of women reporting some degree of concentration 
difficulty compared to males (88.9% of females versus 73.5% 
of males) (Table 2). Furthermore, females tended to report 
more severe symptoms (Table 2). Females also experienced 
a greater burden of memory issues compared to males. Of fe-
males, 79.3% experienced some degree of memory difficulty 
due to their tiredness compared to 57.5% of males. This sug-
gests that in a health-seeking population, females presenting 
are more likely to have increased difficulty concentrating or

difficulty with remembering things relating to their sleepi-
ness compared to males.
Feeling Depressed
Less than half of the overall population reported feeling de-
pressed either occasionally, frequently, or always (as opposed 
to rarely or never). However, a much larger proportion of 
females reported some level of feeling depressed compared 
to males. The proportion of females reportedly feeling de-
pressed occasionally was 55.7% compared to 38.6% of males. 
The proportion of females reportedly feeling depressed fre-
quently was 12.9% compared to 6.7% of males. The propor-
tion of females reportedly always feeling depressed was 4% 
compared to 0.7% of males (Table 2). These results support 
Lin et al.’s postulation that females present with more symp-
toms of depression compared to males.4 However, as depres-
sion is more prevalent in females than males in the general 
population,16 these differences may not be as a result of sleep-
related health problems. Nevertheless, general practitioners 
should be aware of the increased prevalence of depressive 
symptoms in females seeking sleep-related health care com-
pared to men.
Sleeping at Night
One-third of patients reported trouble getting to sleep at night. 
As seen with many of the other parameters measured, there 
was a larger proportion of females who experienced issues 
sleeping at night. Almost half of the female population (47.8%) 
reported often having trouble sleeping at night compared to 
26.7% of males. This observation is consistent with that of 
Wahner-Roedler et al., who found that difficulty falling asleep 
was observed more frequently in females.9
Snoring and Relationships
More than three-fourths of patients who had partners reported 
that their snoring kept their partner awake, and 48.3% reported 
that their snoring forced either themselves or their partners out 
of the room (Table 3). Overall, both keeping a partner awake 
and forcing a partner out of the bedroom occurred in a greater 
proportion of males (77.6% for keeping partners awake and 
50.3% for forcing one person in the couple out of the room) 
compared to females (75.4% for keeping partners awake and 
42.3% for forcing one person in couple out of the room). Sixty 
percent of patients who reported that their snoring was keeping 
their partner awake then also said that it had forced one part-
ner of the couple out of the room. This proportion was greater 
in males than females (62.8% compared to 53.7%). The rea-
son for this difference can only be speculated, but it is most 
likely due to how the person’s partner tolerates the snoring. If 
it is assumed that these patients have partners of the opposite 
sex, it could be speculated that women are more susceptible 
to their partner’s snoring, or, conversely, that men are more 
likely to tolerate snoring. However, these data highlight the 
burden that sleep-disordered breathing has on those who re-
port symptoms of the disease, and also on those with whom 
they share close proximity. It also demonstrates that regardless 
of sex, sleep-disordered breathing affects other areas of a pa-
tient’s life. Separate bedrooms because of snoring may affect a 
couple’s intimacy and may have the potential to affect overall 
well-being.
Of the parameters measured, this was the only aspect of ef-
fect on lifestyle where prevalence was greater in males. Lars-
son et al.7 found that a greater proportion of males stated that 
relatives had witnessed and were concerned about witnessed 
apneas compared to females in their survey of a representative 
sample of the general population.4
Although the burden of snoring affected a larger propor-
tion of the partners of males, a larger proportion of females 
reported that their relationships with family, friends, or work 
colleagues were affected to some degree because of sleepiness 
or tiredness (Table 3). The proportion who reported that their 
relationship with others was affected “a little” was similar for 
males (26.2%) and females (28.2%), but a larger proportion 
of females reported moderate (17.6% compared to 11.7% of 
males) and extreme effects (5.3% compared to 2.8% of males). 
This suggests that females within a health care-seeking popu-
lation experience a greater burden in their relationships with 
others compared to males. However, different sleep disorders 
may have varying effects on the social lives of patients. In a 
recent case control study, Reishtein et al. found that compared 
to 8% of females with chronic insomnia, 41% of females with 
sleep-disordered breathing attributed their divorce, dissolution 
of a romantic relationship, and/or social isolation to their sleep-
related problem.17
In this SleepGP population, patients presented to designated 
SleepGP clinics. These patients’ primary complaints were 
sleep-related. They were either self-referrers, or they were re-
ferred by other general practitioners in the clinic. This may 
highlight an important moment for patient education. The lit-
erature increasingly describes the nonspecific symptoms that 
women carry when experiencing sleep-disordered breathing 
and other sleep-related problems. Accordingly, it is important 
that sleep-related problems are included in the general prac-
titioner’s differential diagnosis in a patient with nonspecific 
symptoms such as memory or concentration difficulties. Fur-
thermore, increased patient education about sleep disorders 
could empower patients with the knowledge to recognize that 
their sleep may be affecting their health.
Limitations
This research possesses several limitations. Those who 
completed the FOSQ-10 were more likely to have an ESS 
score > 9 that indicates that they also have a problem with 
their sleep. This may have overestimated the severity of 
FOSQ-10 scores. Furthermore, this population is composed 
of health care-seeking individuals who have not yet received 
a diagnosis of OSA or other sleep-related disorders. There-
fore, some people in this sample will have OSA diagnosable 
through polysomnography and others will not. This limits 
the conclusions that can be drawn about the symptoms re-
ported and their relationship to the severity of disease that 
these patients may go on to be diagnosed with. This article 
demonstrates the quality of life and symptomatology of pa-
tients when they first present to a general practitioner. Poten-
tial confounders such as baseline medical conditions were 
also not taken into account. Disease severity and duration

of symptoms were not taken into account; consequently, it 
is difficult to completely understand the reasons for the ob-

should be undertaken.
CONCLUSIONS
As research highlights that males and females experience dif-
ferent symptomatology in sleep disorders such as OSA, this 
article supports the notion that females and males who present 
for sleep-related primary health care also experience different 
effects on their life. At presentation, females are more likely to 
have more severe symptoms of depression, trouble sleeping at 
night, higher ESS scores and lower FOSQ-10 scores, excessive 
daytime sleepiness, and a higher degree of difficulty concen-
trating and remembering things due to sleepiness or tiredness 
compared to males. Females are also more likely to feel that 
their relationship has been negatively affected due to feeling 
sleepy or tired. In contrast, males are more likely to keep their 
partner awake and to have one partner being forced out of the 
room compared to females.
Despite the differences in sex, the aforementioned results 
highlight that sleep medicine is an area of important concern, 
particularly for general practitioners, because of its effects 
on many areas of a person’s physical, emotional, and social 
health.
This article contributes to the current body of evidence in 
several ways. It begins to document characteristics of a sleep 
health-seeking population in an Australian primary health care 
setting. As it is hypothesized that the future of sleep medicine 
involves a substantial primary health care component, this 
article helps elucidate the perceived burden of sleep-related 
health problems for patients when presenting. General prac-
titioners, whether upskilled in sleep health or not, provide the 
gateway to specialist services in Australia. To address the 
known issue of underdiagnosis, general practitioners should 
be informed of the less specific symptoms with which women 
with OSA or other sleep-related problems may present. 
The current study also focuses on the quality of life and 
functional outcome differences by sex, which has received less 
attention in the literature compared to focusing on sex differ-
ences in symptomatology, pathophysiology and other clinical 
measures. This is important because, as Hesselbacher et al.18 
highlight:
“ 
…as the practice of sleep medicine moves out of the 
sleep laboratory, and sometimes out of the sleep center 
entirely, history-taking and personalization of the 
treatment regimen become more important.”
Such personalized treatment undoubtedly includes addressing 
the psychosocial effects of disease and overall wellbeing of a 
patient.
The current study also shows that sleep-related health prob-
lems cause a multitude of symptoms and therefore needs mul-
tifactorial management. This highlights the need to prioritize 
sleep-related health care, to improve quality of life for patients 
with sleep-related problems, particularly for women.

APPENDIX
Appendix 1
The Population
Research for the current study took place within the primary 
care setting. In Australia, there is a gateway referral system 
whereby patients must visit a general practitioner to gain a 
referral for additional specialist care except in an emergency. 
This includes gaining a referral to a sleep clinic for a sleep 
study and/or a sleep physician. Therefore, a general practitio-
ner is often the first point of contact when a patient seeks help 
for their sleep-related problem. Previous research also indi-
cates that only a minor proportion of patients from the health 
care-seeking population are referred to a SleepGP from other 
medical specialists,1 and so referral bias is unlikely. It is there-
fore likely to capture a broader range of patients compared to 
those represented in a sleep clinic population because it also 
includes those who have mild or absent clinical disease but still 
report sleep-related problems. Given the issue of underdiagno-
sis, it is important to examine populations of this kind.
Further, while Australia has a universal health care system, 
there is a two-tiered system whereby patients may seek pri-
vate health care at dedicated private providers. Contrary to the 
United States, Australian health insurance can only be invoked 
for inpatient care. There is no contribution from private health 
insurance for care provided in a doctor’s practice (primary 
care or specialist). In this setting, the government contributes 
a percentage of all consultations under the Medicare benefits 
schemes and the remainder is contributed by the patient. In 
general practice, a patient may attend a “bulk-billing consul-
tation,” which is where Medicare accepts the full benefit for 
service. Otherwise the patient makes a contribution in a pri-
vate clinic while the rest is covered by Medicare. The SleepGP 
clinics do not “bulk-bill.” Those who attend private clinics are 
more likely to be of higher socioeconomic status and so this 
dataset is unlikely to be representative of socioeconomic status 
in the general practice population. A SleepGP population is 
likely to be healthier, older, and have better health literacy than 
the overall general practice population.
