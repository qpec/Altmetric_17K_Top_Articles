Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women
of reproductive age. Hyperandrogenism is the central feature of PCOS. Studies on isolated ovarian
theca-interstitial cells suggest that resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, reduces androgen
production.
Objective: This study was designed to evaluate endocrine and metabolic effects of resveratrol on
PCOS.
Design and Setting: This was a randomized (1:1) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that eval-
uated the effects of resveratrol over a period of 3 months in an academic hospital.
Patients and Other Participants: Subjects with PCOS were identified according to the Rotterdam
criteria. Thirty-four subjects were enrolled and 30 subjects completed the trial. Evaluations were
performed at baseline and repeated after 3 months of treatment.
Intervention: Resveratrol (1,500 mg p.o.) or placebo were administered daily.
Main Outcome Measure: Primary outcome was the change in the serum total T.
Results: Resveratrol treatment led to a significant decrease of total T by 23.1% (P � .01). In parallel,
resveratrol induced a 22.2% decrease of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P � .01), a decrease of
fasting insulin level by 31.8% (P � .007) and an increase of the Insulin Sensitivity Index (Matsuda
and DeFronzo) by 66.3% (P � .04). Levels of gonadotropins, the lipid profile as well as markers of
inflammation and endothelial function were not significantly altered.
Conclusions: Resveratrol significantly reduced ovarian and adrenal androgens. This effect may be,
at least in part, related to an improvement of insulin sensitivity and a decline of insulin level. (J Clin
Endocrinol Metab 101: 4322–4328, 2016)
P
olycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common
endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive
age and is primarily characterized by hyperandrogenism
and ovulatory dysfunction. Depending on the diagnostic
criteria, the prevalence of PCOS has been estimated to be
in the range of 6–18% (1–4). In addition to reproductive
dysfunction, PCOS is associated with a wide range of en-
docrine and metabolic derangements including insulin re-
sistance, dyslipidemia, systemic inflammation, and endo-
thelial dysfunction (5–8). Although the etiology, or more
likely multiple etiologies of PCOS are still poorly under-
stood, extensive evidence points to hyperandrogenism as

 the key aspect of this condition. Excessive ovarian andro-
gen levels are a result of increased production of andro-
gensbythehyperplasticthecacompartmentandthemark-
edly elevated expression and activity of several enzymes
involved in steroidogenesis (9–12). Adrenal glands also
contribute to hyperandrogenism in PCOS, as evidenced by
the enlargement of adrenal glands and increased levels of
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (13–15).
The development of effective treatments of PCOS re-
mains challenging, given that the use of antiandrogens
such as spironolactone, flutamide, or cyproterone acetate
and the suppression of ovarian function (eg, by combina-
tion oral contraceptive [OC] pills) is often clinically un-
acceptable. Ideally, a reduction of androgen production
may be accomplished by decreasing the growth of theca
cells and the inhibition of expression and/or activity of
relevant enzymes regulating steroidogenesis, especially
17�-hydroxylase/C17-20-lyase (CYP17; Cyp17a1), the
key rate-limiting enzyme in androgen biosynthesis.
Our recent in vitro studies identified resveratrol (trans-
3,5,4��-trihydroxystilbene) as a potentially promising
novel treatment of ovarian hyperandrogenism. Resvera-
trol is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, nuts, and
berries with noted anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and
cardioprotective properties. Exposure of rat theca-inter-
stitial cells to resveratrol resulted in a potent concentra-
tion-dependent inhibition of cell growth via a reduction of
DNA synthesis and stimulation executioner caspases
leading to apoptosis (16). These effects were related to a
resveratrol-induced inhibition of mevalonate pathway
through mechanisms partly comparable and partly com-
plementary to the effects of statins (17). Subsequently we
found that resveratrol reduces androgen production by
theca-interstitial cells by inhibition of Cyp17a1 mRNA
expression (18). Importantly, it seems that resveratrol ac-
tions on ovarian steroidogenesis are selective, given that it
has no effect on progesterone production by theca cells. In
granulosa cells, resveratrol has cytostatic but not cytotoxic
effect and reduces the expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor but not anti-Müllerian hormone (19).
In view of the above observations, we proposed that
resveratrol may be effective in treatment of hyperandro-
genism in conditions such as PCOS. This study evaluated
the effects of resveratrol on the endocrine and metabolic
function of women with PCOS during a 3-month placebo-
controlled randomized clinical trial. For the first time we
show that resveratrol significantly reduces T level. Fur-
thermore, resveratrol also decreases adrenal androgen
production, as evidenced by lowering levels of circulating
DHEAS.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
All subjects fulfilled PCOS criteria as defined by the Rotter-
dam consensus and had at least two of the following: 1) clinical
or chemical hyperandrogenism; 2) oligo- or amenorrhea; and/or
3) polycystic ovaries as viewed by transvaginal ultrasound (20).
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia was excluded on the basis of a
morning follicular phase 17-hydroxyprogesterone less than 2
ng/mL. None of the subjects had elevated prolactin, thyroid dis-
ease, Cushing’s disease, or diabetes mellitus. No clinical signs or
symptoms of any other endocrinopathy were identified in any
participants. All subjects had normal baseline renal function
tests, bilirubin, and aminotransferases. During the 3 months be-
fore the study, none of the study subjects used any form of OCs,
other steroid hormones, or any other treatments likely to affect
ovarian function, insulin sensitivity, or lipid profile. All subjects
were recruited at the Poznan University of Medical Sciences be-
tween December 2013 and March 2015. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants. Approval of the study was ob-
tained from the Institutional Review Board at the Poznan Uni-
versity of Medical Sciences and the Institutional Review Board at
the University of California–San Diego. The study was registered
at www.clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT01720459.
Procedures
The flowchart of this study is summarized in Figure 1. A total
of 41 women were screened, and 34 (83%) were randomly as-
signed to two treatment groups: Resveratrol group (receiving
micronized transresveratrol; 1500 mg/d orally) and Placebo
group. Resveratrol was obtained from RevGenetics and the pla-
cebo was provided by Adamed sp. z o.o., Adamed Group. The
resveratrol and placebo pills were identical in appearance. Ran-
domization was performed using a 1:1 allocation ratio with
blocks of set size (six subjects per block). Patient allocation was
obtained using GraphPad QuickCalcs (GraphPad Software
Inc.). Investigators and patients were blinded to treatment and
couldnotidentifytheactualtreatmentthroughoutthestudy.The
primary endpoint was change of total T.
Study design and assays
All participants were evaluated at baseline during the follic-
ular phase of a natural cycle or after medroxyprogesterone-in-
duced menses. All evaluations were performed at baseline and
after 3 months of treatment.
Clinical assessments included determinations of body mass
index (BMI), hirsutism (using Ferriman and Gallwey score), and
acne score. Acne was scored using a four-point scale described
previously (21). Transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluations
were performed using Aloka ProSound �7 (Aloka Co, Ltd.);
ovaries were measured in three perpendicular diameters. Ovar-
ian volume was determined using the prolate ellipsoid formula.
Endocrine and metabolic tests were performed after 3 days of
carbohydrate intake of 300 g/d to standardize conditions before
glucosetolerancetest.Venousbloodwascollectedbetween0700
and 0800 hours after an overnight fast. Serum specimens were
stored at �70°C until analysis was performed. A 2-hour oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed with determina-
tions of glucose and insulin in the fasting state as well as after a
75-g glucose load at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Glucose was

 determined using the enzymatic reference method with hexoki-
nase on Roche Cobas 6000 System (Roche Polska sp z o.o.).
Insulin, total T, LH, FSH, prolactin, SHBG, 17-hydroxypro-
gesterone, DHEAS, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(CRP) (hs-CRP), were determined using specific electrochemi-
luminescence assays (Automated Cobas 6000 System; Roche
Polska sp z o.o.). Evaluation of insulin sensitivity using fasting
measures used the method described by Katz et al (22): Quan-
titative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) � 1/[log(fast-
ing insulin) � log (fasting glucose)]. The insulin sensitivity index
was calculated using glucose and insulin levels obtained during
an OGTT as described by Matsuda and DeFronzo: Insulin Sen-
sitivity Index � 10,000/square root of [(fasting glucose � fasting
insulin) � (mean glucose � mean insulin during OGTT)] (23).
Total cholesterol and triglycerides were determined by enzy-
matic colorimetric assays (Automated Cobas 6000 System;
Roche Polska sp z o.o.). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) was
separated by precipitating apolipoprotein-B (Roche Polska sp z
o.o.). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was calculated using the
Friedwald formula. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
(sVCAM) and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule–1 (sI-
CAM-1) were determined using a human Quantikine ELISA kit
from R&D Systems. Neopterin was determined using ELISA kit
from Demeditec Diagnostics, GmbH.
Statistical analysis
AnalysiswascarriedoutusingJMPpro11statisticalsoftware
(SAS Institute). Power analysis assumed enrollment of 34 sub-
jects with anticipated 15% dropout rate, a coefficient of varia-
tion of primary outcome at 20% (based on previous studies) and
a 25% effect of treatment with power of 0.9 and alpha error of
0.05. Comparisons between groups were performed using un-
paired t test. Comparisons of baseline and follow-up values were
performed using paired t test. In the absence of a normal distri-
bution (tested by Shapiro-Wilk test), logarithmic transforma-
tions or nonparametric testing (Wilcoxon/Kruskal Wallis, Wil-
coxon Signed Rank) was carried out.
Correlations between variables were
evaluated by a determination of the Pear-
son product–moment correlation coeffi-
cient or Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient.
Results
Comparison of groups at
baseline
Table 1 summarizes the baseline
characteristics of 34 subjects en-
rolled onto the study. Hyperandro-
genism (defined as Ferriman and
Gallwey score �8 and/or total T �
0.50 ng/mL) was identified in 68%
of the subjects. Overall, randomiza-
tion in the Resveratrol and Placebo
groups resulted in comparable pop-
ulations of subjects with the excep-
tion of significantly higher total cho-
lesterol in the Resveratrol group. The flow diagram of the
study(Figure1)demonstratesthat30subjects(88%)com-
pleted the 3-month trial.
Effects of treatments
Results of the trial are presented in Table 2 and Table
3. Table 2 presents baseline and post-treatment values for
the Resveratrol group and the Placebo group separately
whereas Table 3 compares the changes between groups.
Total T level (primary outcome) declined only in the Res-
veratrol group (by 23.1%; P � .01), whereas it minimally
increased by 2.9% (P � .78) in the Placebo group; the
difference between groups was statistically significant
(P � .04). In a similar fashion, DHEAS, an androgen
nearly exclusively produced by the adrenals, also signifi-
cantly declined in the Resveratrol group (by 22.2%),
whereas its level in the Placebo group modestly increased
by 10.5% (P � .08); the difference between groups was
significant (P � .002). Improvement of hyperandrogen-
emia in the Resveratrol group was paralleled by a decline
of fasting insulin (by 31.8%; P � .007) and increase of the
Insulin Sensitivity Index (by 66.3%; P � .04). However,
resveratrol had no significant effect on BMI, ovarian vol-
ume, gonadotropins, lipid profile, or markers of inflam-
mation and endothelial function. Notably, when evaluat-
ing baseline vs 3-month data (Table 2), several significant
changes were observed in the Placebo group including a
reduction of ovarian volume and an increase of total cho-
lesterol and HDL cholesterol.

 To determine whether any of the tested baseline pa-
rameters correlated with a change of T level in the Res-
veratrol group, correlations were assessed; the only
variable predicting a reduction of serum T was BMI,
whereby leaner subjects had a significantly greater de-
crease of T in response to resveratrol than subjects with
greater BMI (Spearman’s � � 0.63; P � .01) (Figure 2).

Discussion
This study, to our knowledge, is the first clinical trial eval-
uating the effects of resveratrol on PCOS. It is apparent
that resveratrol significantly reduces serum levels of T and
DHEAS, suggesting an effect on ovarian as well as adrenal
androgen production. The magnitude of improvement of
hyperandrogenemia observed in response to resveratrol is
comparable to or greater than that found in response to
OC pills or metformin, with the exception of preparations
containing cypretorone acetate, which are not available in
the United States. In the present study, a 3-month course
of resveratrol led to a 23.1% decline of total T, whereas a
12-month treatment with OC pill (150 mg desogestrel and
30 �g ethinyl estradiol) resulted in a 19% reduction of T
level;inthesametrialmetforminalonewasalsoassociated
with a 19% decrease of T (24). In another study, 6 months
of metformin treatment resulted in a nonsignificant de-
crease of T by 8.2% (25). A reduction of T following
pharmacological interventions seems usually to occur
gradually over a period of many months; thus, for exam-

 ple, in our previous trial, metformin treatment resulted in
a 13.6% decrease of T after 3 months and a 25.6% de-
crease after 6 months (26, 27). Consequently, a marked
reduction of hyperandrogenemia observed over a period
of 3 months in this trial is encouraging. Also encouraging
is the observation that in contrast with most studies eval-
uating OC pills, resveratrol had no adverse effect on met-
abolic aspects of PCOS and did not significantly alter the
lipid profile or markers of inflammation, but had a posi-
tive effect on insulin sensitivity and a reduction of fasting
insulin level.
Although identification of the mechanisms of action of
resveratrol is not possible in this clinical trial, several pos-
sible mechanisms may be considered, including the direct
inhibition of 17�-hydroxylase/C17-20-lyase enzymatic
activity, a reduction of growth of theca cells, and the im-
provement of insulin sensitivity with consequent reduc-
tion of insulin levels. Indeed, in our previous in vitro stud-
ies using rat theca-interstitial cells, we observed that
resveratrol inhibits proliferation of these cells and reduces
mRNA expression of Cyp17a1 (17, 18). These effects on
the proliferation of theca cells are related to resveratrol-
induced inhibition of mevalonate pathway, at least in part
via inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
reductase expression and activity (17, 28). In contrast, the
effects of resveratrol on Cyp17a1 expression are not due
to an inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, but seem to
be related to the inhibition of Akt/PKB-signaling path-
way (18).
In the present study we did not observe any significant
decline of cholesterol level in the Resveratrol group. How-
ever, in the Placebo group total cholesterol has increased;
hence, one may speculate that resveratrol may have pre-
ventedanincreaseofcholesterolthatwouldhaveoccurred
otherwise over time. The absence of significant inhibition
of cholesterol in this study may also reflect differences
between species (human vs rat), could be due to inherent
difference of in vivo vs in vitro responses to resveratrol, or
may be a consequence of the relatively short duration of
this clinical trial. Nevertheless, the presently observed ef-
fects of resveratrol on androgen levels are unlikely to be
related to significant inhibition of the mevalonate path-
way, and hence are not due to a reduced proliferation of
theca cells, but may be an effect of the inhibition of an-
drogen production by both ovarian and adrenal tissues,
possiblyviaareductionof17�-hydroxylase/C17-20-lyase
enzymatic activity. Furthermore, given that insulin is
known to stimulate androgen production in both ovarian
(29, 30) and adrenal (31) tissues, it is likely that the res-
veratrol-induced reduction of insulin observed in the pres-
ent study may have contributed to a decrease of androgen
levels. An effect of resveratrol on improvement of insulin
sensitivity has been demonstrated previously in some but
not in other studies (32–35).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that resveratrol
reduces serum levels of both T and DHEAS in women with
PCOS, indicating effects at both the ovarian and adrenal
level, and in the absence of significant changes in BMI,
lipid profile, and markers of inflammation/endothelial
function.
