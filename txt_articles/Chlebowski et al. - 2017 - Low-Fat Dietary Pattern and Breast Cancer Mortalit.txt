Purpose
Earlier Women’s Health Initiative Dietary Modification trial findings suggested that a low-fat
eating pattern may reduce breast cancers with greater mortality. Therefore, as a primary
outcome-related analysis from a randomized prevention trial, we examined the long-term in-
fluence of this intervention on deaths as a result of and after breast cancer during 8.5 years
(median) of dietary intervention and cumulatively for all breast cancers diagnosed during 16.1 years
(median) of follow-up.
Patients and Methods
The trial randomly assigned 48,835 postmenopausal women with normal mammograms and
without prior breast cancer from 1993 to 1998 at 40 US clinical centers to a dietary intervention with
goals of a reduction of fat intake to 20% of energy and an increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and
grains (40%; n = 19,541) or to a usual diet comparison (60%; n = 29,294).
Results
In the dietary group, fat intake and body weight decreased (all P , .001). During the 8.5-year
dietary intervention, with 1,764 incident breast cancers, fewer deaths occurred as a result of
breast cancer in the dietary group, which was not statistically significant (27 deaths [0.016%
per year] v 61 deaths [0.024% per year]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.06; P = .08).
During the same period, deaths after breast cancer (n = 134) were significantly reduced (40
deaths [0.025% per year] v 94 deaths [0.038% per year]; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94;
P = .02) by the dietary intervention. During the 16.1-year follow-up, with 3,030 incident breast
cancers, deaths after breast cancer also were significantly reduced (234 deaths [0.085% per
year] v 443 deaths [0.11% per year]; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = .01) in the dietary
group.
Conclusion
Compared with a usual diet comparison group, a low-fat dietary pattern led to a lower incidence of
deaths after breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
In the Women’s Health Initiative Dietary
Modification (WHI DM) trial, 48,835 post-
menopausal women were randomly assigned
to a dietary modification group or usual diet
comparison group to assess low-fat dietary
pattern effects on breast cancer incidence. As
previously reported, the dietary modification
program reduced fat intake; increased fruit,
vegetable, and grain intake; and was associated
with modest weight loss (3% loss after 1 year;
–2.2 kg; P , .001).1 Dietary intake and body
weight differences between randomly assigned
groups were maintained throughout the dietary
intervention period.1,2
At the protocol-specified end of the dietary
intervention, after 8.5 years (median) of follow-
up, although the breast cancer incidence rate was
lower in the dietary group, the difference was not
statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92;
95% CI, 0.84 to 1.01; P = .09). However, a sig-
nificant reduction in estrogen receptor–positive
(ER+), progesterone receptor–negative (PR–)
cancers was observed (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49
to 0.84; P = .04).1 No suggestion of reduced
breast cancer incidence existed during the limited

 postintervention follow-up, but the significant reduction in ER+,
PR– cancers continued (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.88).3 Although
not statistically significant, during the dietary intervention, fewer
deaths as a result of breast cancer were observed in the dietary
group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.22).1
Taken together, these findings suggest that dietary modifi-
cation reduces breast cancers associated with a greater risk of death,
and this possibility has now been examined through 16.1 years
(median) of cumulative follow-up. We present results of dietary
modification influence on deaths as a result of breast cancer (breast
cancer followed by death attributed to the cancer) and on the more
general outcome of deaths after breast cancer (breast cancer fol-
lowed by death as a result of any cause). These end points are
examined first through the end of the 8.5-year (median) dietary
intervention period and then cumulatively for all breast cancers
diagnosed at any time throughout the 16.1-year (median) follow-
up through 2013.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Participants
Design details of the WHI DM trial, which was conducted at 40 US
clinical centers with enrollment from 1993 through 1998, have been
described previously.4,5 Eligible participants were postmenopausal
women between 50 and 79 years of age with no previous breast cancer,
a dietary fat intake . 32% of total energy by food frequency ques-
tionnaire (FFQ),6 and a mammogram not suspicious for cancer. The
trial was approved by institutional review boards of the participating
clinical centers, and participants provided written informed consent.
Random Assignment
Participants were randomly assigned to a low-fat dietary pattern
intervention group or a usual diet comparison group in a two-to-three
ratio for cost efficiency by using a permuted block algorithm stratified by
clinical center and age decade, with allocations developed by the WHI
Clinical Coordinating Center.
Procedure
Baseline characteristics were gathered by interview for medication
use and by questionnaires for other variables. Body weight and height were
measured at baseline and annually, with body mass index calculated as
kilograms per meter squared. Physical activity was assessed by ques-
tionnaire at baseline, year 3, and year 6, with metabolic equivalent tasks
(METs) calculated in MET-hours per week. Mammography screening
was performed every 2 years or annually for the 16% who also par-
ticipated in a WHI hormone therapy trial. Physicians outside the WHI
directed breast cancer therapy.
The low-fat dietary program was designed to reduce fat intake to 20%
of total energy and to increase vegetable, fruit, and grain intake.6,7 Calorie
restriction or weight loss were not intervention targets. Dietary group
participants received 18 group sessions led by centrally trained certified
nutritionists in year 1 and quarterly maintenance sessions throughout
the dietary intervention period. Comparison group participants re-
ceived written diet-related education materials. Participants provided
a 4-day food record at baseline. In addition to a screening FFQ, FFQs
were obtained after 1 year and thereafter from approximately one third
of participants yearly in a rotating sample. Postintervention dietary
intake was also based on 24-hour dietary recall obtained in a subset of
1,311 reconsenting participants. Information on adjuvant chemother-
apy and radiation therapy was based on Medicare findings, whereas
adjuvant endocrine therapy use was based on self-report.
Participants with incident breast cancer continued to partici-
pate in subsequent dietary group meetings and activities. As such,
dietary group participants diagnosed with breast cancer in the first
year after random assignment would have approximately 1 year of
nutritionist contact before and 7 years of contact after diagnosis. In
contrast, participants diagnosed with breast cancer in year 8 after
entry would have had more contact before and less after diagnosis.
The protocol-specified trial completion date of March 31, 2005, was
the end of the 8.5-year dietary intervention period when contact with
study nutritionists ended. Subsequent outcome assessment required
reconsent obtained from 84% versus 81% of surviving comparison
and dietary group participants, respectively, for follow-up through
2010 and 86% of surviving participants from both groups for ad-
ditional follow-up.
Outcome ascertainment was at 6-month intervals throughout the
intervention period, with subsequent updates annually. Initial breast
cancer self-reports were confirmed after medical record review by clinical
center physician-adjudicators. Final adjudication was performed centrally
at the Clinical Coordinating Center.8 Human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2, ER, and PR status was determined at local laboratories. Cause of
death was determined by centralized medical record or death certificate
review and, in some cases, by report from participant relatives. All ad-
judicators were blind to random assignment. National Death Index queries
completed through 2013 provided additional survival information re-
gardless of reconsent status.
Statistical Analysis
The current study primary analysis end points, annualized rates of
deaths as a result of and after breast cancer, during the dietary intervention
period and cumulatively throughout follow-up were assessed by randomly
assigned group by dividing the number of events by the corresponding
person-time in each period. Incidence curves were generated, and HRs,
95% CIs, and P values were calculated from Cox proportional hazards
regression models stratified by age at random assignment, random as-
signment status in the WHI hormone trials, and study period (time
dependent). Analyses of deaths as a result of and after breast cancer in-
cluded all 48,835 study participants measured from random assignment.
The study design and the two analysis periods are outlined in Figure 1.
Because dietary effects in nine subgroups were investigated, fewer
than one statistically significant interaction was expected by chance alone.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used for graphical presentation of death
rates. The amount of the dietary effect on death after breast cancer that

 could be explained by its effect on PR status was assessed by the pro-
portional reduction of the HR, relative to the null, after controlling for PR
status. All statistical tests were two-sided. Analyses were performed with
SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The current report updates,
with long-term follow-up, dietary modification influence on deaths as
a result of breast cancer and provides, for the first time in our knowledge,
findings on deaths after breast cancer. These survival analyses were not
protocol prespecified but provide the final and most accurate assessment of
study findings.
RESULTS
Although no ongoing contact with study nutritionists occurred
during postintervention, the percent energy from fat remained
modestly lower in the dietary group for several years.3 The par-
ticipant flow for those diagnosed with breast cancer during the
dietary intervention period and throughout the cumulative follow-
up period is outlined in Appendix Figure A1 (online only).
For a subset of participants (n = 1,764) with breast cancer
diagnosed during the dietary intervention period, selected
intervention-related characteristics are outlined at baseline and
serially in Appendix Table A1 (online only). Dietary intakes by
randomly assigned group at baseline and 1 year in participants
with breast cancer were similar to those in the overall study
population, and significant differences remained between groups
after breast cancer diagnosis for changes in percent energy from
fat (–11.5% v –1.5%; P , .001) and intake of fruits, vegetables,
and grains (P , .001) on the basis of the first FFQ obtained 1.6
years (mean) after diagnosis. Recreational physical activity after
breast cancer, available in a subset of 330 participants, was 12.8
versus 10.8 MET-hours/week (mean) for the dietary and com-
parison groups, respectively (P = .41). Physical activity was not
assessed postintervention.
As reported previously, during the 8.5-year dietary in-
tervention period, 8% fewer breast cancers were observed in
the dietary group.1,3 In the current report, of all 3,030 breast
cancers diagnosed throughout the 16.1 years of cumulative
follow-up, the HR for breast cancer incidence was 0.97 (95%
CI, 0.90 to 1.04; Fig 1). Most breast cancer characteristics were
balanced between randomly assigned groups. Similar to findings
during the dietary intervention period,1 a larger fraction of
cancers in the dietary group were ER+ and PR– (P = .05; Table 1).
During the 8.5 years of dietary intervention, with 1,764 in-
cident breast cancers, fewer deaths occurred as a result of breast
cancer in the dietary group, which was not statistically significant
(27 deaths [0.016% per year] v 61 deaths [0.024% per year]; HR,
0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.06; P = .08; Figs 2 and 3A). During the same
period, deaths after breast cancer (n = 134) were significantly
reduced (40 deaths [0.025% per year] v 94 deaths [0.038% per
year]; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94; P = .02) by the dietary
intervention (Fig 3B). During the 16.1 years of cumulative follow-
up with 3,030 incident breast cancers, somewhat fewer deaths
occurred as a result of breast cancer in the dietary group (111
deaths [0.035% per year] v 185 deaths [0.039% per year]; HR, 0.91;
95% CI, 0.72 to 1.15; Fig 4A), and deaths after breast cancer were
significantly reduced (234 deaths [0.085% per year] v 443 deaths
[0.11% per year]; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = .01) in the
dietary group (Fig 4B).
The HR for deaths after breast cancer was unchanged by the
addition of baseline weight and time-dependent weight change to
the analysis. Analyses that added a time-dependent variable for PR
status resulted in an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.02) during the
cumulative follow-up period, which corresponded to a 29% ex-
planation of the benefit observed in the unadjusted analyses (Figs
3B and 4B).
Breast cancer therapy information from Medicare was
available in 1,403 of 3,030 participants; no significant differ-
ences between the dietary and comparison groups were seen
for radiation therapy (64% v 65%, respectively) or adjuvant
chemotherapy (25% v 27%, respectively). Endocrine adjuvant
therapy, which was based on self-report (n = 673), also was
similar in the randomly assigned groups (71% v 68% users,
respectively).
Two of nine subgroups examined for dietary modification in-
fluence on deaths after breast cancer were significant at the .05 level

 DISCUSSION
With long-term follow-up of the WHI DM trial, deaths after breast
cancer were significantly reduced in the dietary group both during
the dietary intervention period and throughout the 16.1-year cu-
mulative follow-up period. The lower risk of poor prognosis, ER+,
PR– breast cancers10 in the dietary group contributed to the fa-
vorable dietary effect on death after breast cancer. The findings on
deaths as a result of and after breast cancer presented here arose
from standard intention-to-treat comparisons between randomly
assigned groups in analyses that included all 48,835 participants.
WHI DM is a primary prevention trial; however, in adjuvant breast
cancer trials, death as a result of all causes measured from diagnosis
(breast cancer overall survival) is considered an important clinical
end point.11,12 An additional factor that potentially influenced
deaths after breast cancer could be a favorable dietary influence on
mortality as a result of other causes, including cardiovascular disease.
Although fewer deaths occurred as a result of breast cancer in
the dietary group, the difference was not statistically significant and
perhaps was limited by event number. However, the HR for dietary
influence on deaths as a result of breast cancer during the dietary
intervention period was comparable to that seen for deaths after breast
cancer (HR, 0.67 and 0.65, respectively). In addition, accurate de-
termination of cause of death after breast cancer can be difficult given
the potential interaction between common comorbidities and cancer
therapies, such as cardiac disease after anthracycline, trastuzumab, or
radiation therapy. Thus, the actual breast cancer mortality rate likely
lies between the attributed rate, on the basis of medical record review,
and the rate that considered all deaths after breast cancer.
The subgroup analyses identified postmenopausal women as
more likely to benefit from the dietary intervention. An intervention
effect on deaths after breast cancer was more likely if a woman had
either a lifestyle ($ 36.8% energy from fat) or a consequence of
lifestyle ($ 88 waist circumference) that has been associated with
adverse breast cancer outcome before dietary modification.13 Because
subgroup analysis identified no benefit on deaths after breast cancer
for dietary group participants, with , 27.9% calories from fat at entry,
a notional threshold for effect may be . 28% calories from fat, which
is not far from the current average US intake of postmenopausal
women of 33%.14 A modest reduction in fat intake with minimal
weight loss represents an easily achievable goal by many.

 A substantial number of observational studies have addressed
the issue of dietary intake and breast cancer incidence and outcome,
but the findings were mixed,15-17 with both negative18 and positive19
findings that perhaps reflected observational study limitations. These
limitations include dietary intake measurement error, limited varia-
tion in dietary intake within study populations, and common reliance

Fig 5. Subgroup analysis by a forest plot of hazard ratios (HRs), dietary intervention versus comparison, for death after breast cancer by select subgroups of participants
with an invasive breast cancer diagnosis that occurred anytime throughout the cumulative follow-up period. Annualized percentages are shown for all subgroups except
percent energy from fat, where the numbers of deaths with 4-day food records were reported. Because of expense, baseline food records were scored for only breast
cancers that occurred during the intervention period. For this analysis HRs were estimated in a case-only analysis by using logistic regression of random assignment
stratified by the four ordinal groups of dietary fat. For rare outcomes (eg, , 5% incidence during study follow-up), case-only analyses provided HRs and corresponding 95%
CIs that were essentially equivalent to those that would arise if the subgroups were available for the entire randomly assigned cohort. To illustrate, the corresponding case-
only estimate for the overall effect on death after breast cancer (HR, 0.80) and the usual Cox proportional hazards regression estimate that includes deaths as a result of any
cause that occurred after breast cancer diagnosis during the intervention period only (HR, 0.81) are provided. P values correspond to a test of the interaction between
randomly assigned group and subgroup. (*) Includes deaths as a result of any cause that occurred after breast cancer diagnosis during the intervention or postintervention
periods. (†) Among participants who did not report a prior hysterectomy. Ever used estrogen plus progestin includes random assignment into the Women’s Health Initiative

 on a single dietary intake made before diagnosis. The uncertainty
raised by the observational study findings provided a major impetus to
the conduct of the current randomized clinical trial.
The WHI low-fat dietary program reduced fat and increased
fruit and vegetable intake, changes that potentially influence
breast cancer,20-22 and their effects on study findings cannot be
separated. Although adjustment for weight change during the
intervention did not attenuate the dietary effect on death after
breast cancer, the WHI DM trial evaluated a low-fat eating
pattern, not the influence of any individual factor on study
outcomes. With respect to other lifestyle factors, when measured
in a subgroup, physical activity did not significantly differ be-
tween randomly assigned groups.
At entry, women in the WHI DM trial had no prior breast
cancer and a normal screening mammogram. Nonetheless, results
from a modeling exercise suggest that the WHI dietary intervention
may have primarily affected undiagnosed preclinical breast cancers.
The model23 incorporates cancer doubling time, mammography
detection threshold, and subclinical breast cancer prevalence. When
applied to the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial, which entered
a similarly aged population, after a mean 5.6 years of follow-up, 94%
of the breast cancers were estimated to be preclinical cancers, with
only 6% de novo cases.23
In the WHI DM trial, after 16.1 years of follow-up, no overall
reduction in breast cancer incidence was seen, but a smaller
fraction of cancers in the dietary group were ER+, PR–, which
explains 29% of the difference in deaths after breast cancer. Overall,
9% fewer deaths occurred as a result of breast cancer (n = 296;
P = .41), and 18% fewer deaths occurred after breast cancer (n = 677;
P = .01) in the dietary group. One interpretation could be that
dietary intervention–reduced breast cancers are more likely to be
fatal and favorably influence other causes of death that may or may
not have been specific to the cancer therapy experience of patients
with breast cancer. Because the WHI low-fat dietary intervention
had at least short-term effects of lowering systolic blood pressure,
reducing metabolic syndrome risk, and lowering cholesterol-targeted
and hypertension medicine,24,25 it could have had an influence on
other chronic diseases.
The WHI dietary intervention findings can be compared with
three randomized primary breast cancer prevention trials that
evaluated tamoxifen.26-28 In the P-1 trial in 13,388 participants,
after a median 7 years of follow-up, tamoxifen reduced breast
cancer incidence by 43%, but 10% more deaths occurred after
breast cancer in the tamoxifen group (n = 240; not significant).26 In
the Royal Marsden Prevention Trial in 2,471 participants, after
a median 13 years of follow-up, breast cancer incidence was
somewhat lower in the tamoxifen group (22% lower, P = .1), with
27 deaths after breast cancer in each randomly assigned group.27 In
the International Breast Cancer Intervention Trial 1 in 7,154
participants, after a median 16 years follow-up, tamoxifen reduced
breast cancer incidence by 29% (P , .001), but 19% more deaths
occurred as a result of breast cancer (n = 57; P = .8) and 10% more
deaths after breast cancer (n = 389; P = 0.4) in the tamoxifen
group.28 Favorable effects on mortality may emerge from these
trials with longer follow-up, and differences in study populations
and conduct exist compared with the WHI DM trial. However, one
interpretation of the current tamoxifen findings could be that
tamoxifen reduced breast cancers that were less likely to be fatal
and did not favorably influence other causes of death.29
To our knowledge, only two other full-scale randomized trials
examined dietary change and breast cancer incidence. A low-fat in-
tervention was evaluated in 4,690 women with high breast density but
found no influence on breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.19; 95% CI,
0.91 to 1.55).30 Compared with the WHI DM, the study population
was younger (mean age, 47 years), commonly premenopausal, and
had lower a lower body mass index (mean, 23.3 kg/m2). In the
Prevenci´
on con Dieta Mediterr´
anea trial, 4,152 postmenopausal
women at high cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to two
Mediterranean diets or a control condition (advised to reduce dietary
fat). As a secondary end point, breast cancer incidence (n = 35) was
significantly lower in one Mediterranean diet compared with the
control condition. However, control group counseling was limited,
and participants did not materially reduce fat intake.31
Strengths of the current study include the randomized de-
sign, a large population of 48,835 postmenopausal women, 3,030
incident breast cancers confirmed by medical record review and
677 deaths after breast cancer, serial screening mammography,
and long-term follow-up. National Death Index supplemental
follow-up provided additional survival information independent
of reconsent status. Although no established biomarkers existed
for dietary fat intake, the sustained lower body weight in the
dietary group supports dietary intake differences between ran-
domly assigned groups. Study limitations are associated with post
hoc analyses and lack of comprehensive breast cancer therapy
information.
In summary, women randomly assigned to a low-fat dietary
pattern had a nonsignificantly lower risk of death as a result of
breast cancer and a significantly reduced risk of death after breast
cancer. Future studies of other lifestyle interventions on breast
cancer incidence and outcome could incorporate some form of
a low-fat dietary pattern as a base.
