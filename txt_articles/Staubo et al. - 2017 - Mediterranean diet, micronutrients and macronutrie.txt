Abstract
INTRODUCTION—The Mediterranean diet (MeDi) is associated with reduced risk of cognitive 
impairment, but it’s unclear whether it’s associated with better brain imaging biomarkers.
METHODS—Among 672 cognitively normal participants (mean age: 79.8 years, 52.5% men), we 
investigated associations of MeDi score and MeDi components with magnetic resonance imaging 
measures of cortical thickness for the 4 lobes separately and averaged (average lobar).
RESULTS—Higher MeDi score was associated with larger frontal, parietal, occipital, and 
average lobar cortical thickness. Higher legume and fish intakes were associated with larger

 cortical thickness: legumes with larger superior parietal, inferior parietal, precuneus, parietal,

1. Introduction
The absence of effective disease modifying treatments for cognitive impairment underscores 
the need for preventive measures to reduce the burden of late life cognitive impairment 
including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Certain diets 
show promising, preventive effects on brain aging and cognitive impairment in observational 
studies and in clinical trials [1–3]. Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) is 
associated with a lower risk for AD [4–8]. Prospectively, we showed that a high percentage 
of daily calories derived from protein and fat were associated with a reduced risk of incident 
MCI, whereas a high percentage from carbohydrates was associated with an increased risk 
of incident MCI [9]. We and others showed that cross-sectionally, components of the MeDi 
diet (vegetables, fruit, moderate alcohol intake) and high intake of mono (MUFA) and 
polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids were associated with a reduced odds ratio for mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) [10, 11]. Other investigators report beneficial effects of 
micronutrients (specifically, vitamins) on risk of cognitive impairment [12–14]. Despite 
these beneficial effects of diet on cognition, the associations of dietary measures with 
structural brain changes assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not 
established.
The few published studies on diet and imaging biomarkers suggest that higher adherence to 
a MeDi dietary pattern is associated with a reduced odds ratio for infarctions [15], larger 
cortical thickness, and larger brain volumes [16, 17]. However, further studies are needed to 
better understand the associations of the MeDi pattern and components of the MeDi with 
MRI biomarkers for specific brain regions that are involved in ageing or AD-related 
neurodegeneration and atrophy. Our objective was to study the cross-sectional associations 
of the MeDi and components of the MeDi with global and regional MRI measures of 
cortical thickness.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and participants
The details of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) have previously 
been published [18]. Briefly, all residents from Olmsted County, Minn., USA, aged 70–89 
years on October 1, 2004, were identified using the medical records-linkage system of the

 Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) [19]. Potential participants were selected using an 
age- and sex-stratified random sampling strategy, and eligible participants (without 
dementia, not in hospice or terminally ill) were recruited. From August 2005, MRI imaging 
was offered to participants at the clinical evaluation. Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) 
were mailed to participants beginning in 2006 and were not linked to a particular evaluation. 
This study includes persons who were 70 years and older, cognitively normal when they 
completed the FFQ, and underwent MRI. Ethical considerations: All study protocols were 
approved by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center institutional review boards, and 
participants provided signed informed consent prior to participation.
2.2. Clinical evaluation
Participants underwent a clinical evaluation by a nurse or study coordinator. The interview 
by the study coordinator included questions about education, memory (participant), the 
Functional Activities Questionnaire and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (informant) [20, 21], 
and weight and height were measured. They underwent neuropsychometric testing 
administered by a psychometrist; 9 tests were used to assess performance in memory, 
executive function, visuospatial skills and language domains [18, 22]. A physician 
evaluation included assessment of global cognition using the Short Test of Mental Status 
[23] and a neurologic examination. The nurse or coordinator, psychometrist and physician 
who evaluated the participant and a neuropsychologist reviewed all the information for a 
participant and assigned a diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia by consensus 
using previously published criteria [18, 22, 24]. Medical conditions were abstracted from the 
medical records.
2.3. Measurement of dietary food intake
Participants reported dietary intakes in the prior 12 months using a modified Block 1995 
Revision of the Health habits FFQ [25] which consisted of 128 items [9–11]. Respondents 
indicated the usual portion size (small, medium, large; the medium portion was specified), 
and how often they consumed the food (never or <1 per month, 1–3 per month, 1 per week, 
2–4 per week, 5–6 per week, 1 per day, 2–3 per day, 4–5 per day, 6+ per day). The 
questionnaire data were analyzed using The Food Processor SQL nutrition analysis software 
program (version 10.0.0, ESHA Research, Salem, Oregon, USA). Daily intake of foods, 
micronutrients, macronutrients, total daily caloric intake, and percentage of total caloric 
intake from each macronutrient (% protein, % fat, and % carbohydrate) were computed.
A MeDi score was computed as previously described [7, 9, 10, 26]. Energy-adjusted nutrient 
intakes were computed from the residual of each nutrient regressed on total caloric intake 
(kcal) [27]. Using a sex specific median cutoff, a value of 0 was assigned for consumption 
below, and 1 for values at or above the median for beneficial foods (vegetables, legumes, 
fruit, cereal/grains, and fish). Conversely, a value of 1 was assigned for consumption below, 
and 0 for consumption above the median for foods considered unfavorable in excess (meat, 
dairy products). Fat intake was estimated from the ratio of MUFA to saturated fats (SFA); a 
value of 1 was assigned for a ratio at or above the median and 0 otherwise. Alcohol intake 
was assigned a score of 1 for intake of 5 to < 25 g/day for women and 10 to < 50 g/day for 
men, and 0 otherwise. The total MeDi score ranged from 0 to 9 (maximum adherence).

 2.4. MRI measures
MRI was performed on 3T systems. The cortical surface was parcellated using Freesurfer (v 
5.3). Six summary cortical thickness measures were calculated: an average cortical thickness 
for each of the 4 lobes from regions of interest (ROIs): parietal (ROIs from precuneus, 
superior parietal, inferior parietal, supramarginal, and postcentral cortex), temporal (superior 
temporal, middle temporal, inferior temporal, banks of superior temporal sulcus, transverse 
temporal, fusiform and entorhinal cortex), frontal (ROIs from superior frontal, rostral middle 
frontal, caudal middle frontal, inferior frontal, lateral and medial orbitofrontal, paracentral, 
precentral and frontal pole), and occipital (ROIs from lateral occipital, lingual, cuneus, and 
pericalcrine regions); average lobar cortical thickness (average thickness from the ROIs for 
the 4 lobes); and a composite ROI thickness measure representing an AD signature cortical 
thickness (ROIs from entorhinal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, and fusiform cortex) 
[28]. A priori individual cortical thickness measures of interest included ROIs associated 
with atrophy or AD-related neurodegeneration: entorhinal, inferior parietal, superior parietal, 
posterior cingulate, middle temporal, superior temporal, inferior temporal, temporal pole, 
supramarginal, precuneus, dorsolateral prefrontal (superior frontal, rostral and caudal middle 
frontal), inferior frontal (pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, pars opercularis), fusiform and 
lingual [29–31]. Hippocampal volume (HVa) was estimated from the summed right and left 
volumes from Freesurfer (v 5.3) and adjusted for TIV.
2.5. Statistical analyses
Examination of residuals of regression of total MeDi on summary imaging measures 
suggested a linear association. Therefore, the associations of dietary measures (MeDi score, 
components of MeDi, macro and micronutrients) with summary MRI measures and 
individual ROIs were examined using general linear models for the left and right thickness 
combined. Due to the discrete nature of the total MeDi score and the differences in units and 
distributions of the dietary variables (foods [g/d], macronutrients [g/d or %], micronutrients 
[mg/d or mcg/d]), dietary variables were log-transformed (linolenic acid, linoleic acid, 
vitamin B2, B6, C, B carotene and folate) or square root-transformed (vegetables and whole 
grains/cereal) where necessary (i.e. substantially skewed), and standardized by the mean and 
standard deviation to create z scores.
The basic models were adjusted for age, sex, education, body mass index (BMI), and total 
energy intake. The fully adjusted models additionally included depressive symptoms (from 
Beck’s Depression Inventory II), diabetes, hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, 
congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and dyslipidemia; we 
also examined potential confounding by APOE ε4 allele (ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, or ε4/ε4). The 
associations of dietary measures with thickness measures were examined for left and right 
hemispheres separately, and averaged. The associations for left and right hemispheres were 
very similar and consistent with the average; therefore only results based on the averaged 
thicknesses are reported.
Potential interaction (effect modification) by APOE ε4 allele, sex, and moderate exercise 
(based on self-report at baseline) was examined. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was 
not performed in order to identify potential associations that could be examined in definitive

 prospective studies [32]. Statistical testing was performed at the conventional 2-tailed alpha 
level of P < 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary Institute, NC).
3. Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the participants included in the study (n = 672) vs. those 
who did not participate in MRI studies (n = 398). Participants who completed an MRI had a 
higher education level and a lower frequency of vascular diseases compared to MRI non-
participants, but they did not differ in regard to sex, APOE ε4 allele, diabetes, body mass 
index, history of smoking, dyslipidemia, or total MeDi score. The median [25th, 75th 
interquartile range] time between FFQ and MRI was 6.2 (3.6, 12.7 months); 74% of scans 
were performed after the FFQ. The distribution of the dietary intakes overall and by MeDi 
categories (0–3, 4–5, 6–9) is presented in the Supplementary Table.
3.1. Association of total MeDi score with summary cortical thickness measures
A higher MeDi score was associated with larger frontal, average lobar, parietal, and occipital 
lobe cortical thickness (CT); beta estimates ranged from .007 to .011 (Figure 1A). MeDi was 
marginally associated with temporal (beta, .009, p = .07) and AD signature CT (beta, .009, 
p=.09). A higher MeDi score was also associated with larger CT in several individual ROIs: 
superior temporal, dorsolateral prefrontal, middle temporal, fusiform, precuneus and lingual 
with beta estimates ranging from .010 to .014, and marginally significant associations for 
superior parietal (beta, .011; p = 0.05), inferior parietal (beta, .009; p = .07) and inferior 
frontal (beta, .008, p = .09); Figure 1B). There were no significant interactions of MeDi with 
APOE ε4 allele, sex or moderate exercise in regard to the summary measures and MeDi was 
not associated with hippocampal volume (the data are not presented).
3.2. Association of MeDi components, macro- and micronutrients with cortical thickness 
measures
Four of the five beneficial MeDi components were positively associated with CT measures. 
Specifically, higher fish intake was associated with larger CT summary measures for parietal 
and average lobar CT, and was marginally associated with AD signature CT (p=.06), 
temporal (p = .06) and frontal (p =.08) CT (Figure 2A). Fish intake was also associated with 
several individual CT measures: precuneus, superior parietal, posterior cingulate, 
supramarginal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal, and marginally associated with 
fusiform CT (p =.05). Higher intake of legumes was associated with larger parietal and 
occipital CT, and with larger thickness in ROIs for superior parietal, inferior parietal, 
precuneus and lingual CT (Figure 2B). Higher intake of total vegetables was associated with 
larger dorsolateral prefrontal and superior parietal CT; vegetables without legumes were 
associated with larger middle temporal, superior parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal CT 
(Table 2). Intake of whole grains/cereals was associated with larger temporal pole and 
superior temporal CT in the fully adjusted model (Table 2, model 2). In contrast, fruit intake 
(without fruit juice) was negatively associated with inferior parietal, supramarginal, superior 
parietal, parietal, and precuneus CT (Figure 2C).

 Table 2 presents associations of other MeDi component foods not included in computing the 
MeDi score, percentage macronutrients, and vitamins, with CT measures. Positive 
associations (higher intake with larger CT) were observed for omega-3 fatty acids and 
linolenic acid (an omega-3 PUFA) with superior temporal CT; linoleic acid (an omega-6 
PUFA) with superior temporal, precuneus, middle temporal and parietal CT; vitamins B1 
and B2 with superior temporal and temporal pole CT; vitamin B6 with superior temporal 
and middle temporal; folate with superior temporal; and beta carotene with dorsolateral 
prefrontal and temporal pole CT. Surprisingly, higher red meat was associated with larger 
entorhinal CT. Negative associations (higher intake with lower CT) were observed for % 
carbohydrate and % sugar with entorhinal CT and red meat with inferior and superior 
temporal CT (Table 2, model 1). MUFA/saturated fat ratio and dairy were not associated 
with CT measures. The estimates were unchanged with adjustment for APOE ε4 allele (data 
not presented). Food components that were marginally associated with CT measures (.05 ≤ P 
≤ .10) in the fully adjusted models are presented in Table 3.
4. Discussion
In this population-based sample of elderly participants, higher adherence to a Mediterranean 
dietary pattern was associated with larger cortical thickness of the summary measures and 
with several individual ROIs that undergo age-related or AD-related neurodegeneration. 
Higher intakes of foods that are considered beneficial for cognition as well as B vitamins 
were associated with larger cortical thickness. In contrast, higher intakes of foods that are 
considered non-beneficial at high levels and higher percentages of calories from 
carbohydrates and sugar were associated with lower cortical thickness. These cross-sectional 
findings suggest that a healthy or MeDi dietary pattern is associated with larger cortical 
thickness in several brain regions.
Synaptic dysfunction and loss of synapses may lead to neuronal loss, cortical thinning, and 
cognitive impairment. Although we did not evaluate cognition as an dependent measure in 
the present study, the findings have implications for maintaining cognitive function. Positive 
associations of total MeDi score and beneficial components of MeDi (fish, vegetables, 
legumes, and whole grains/cereals) were observed with average cortical thickness in parietal 
and frontal lobes and with ROIS such as superior temporal, dorsolateral prefrontal, 
entorhinal, and fusiform ROIs that mediate or support memory, executive function, attention 
and language, and are associated with atrophy in dementia [30].
Fish (fatty fish in particular) is an important source of omega-3 fatty acid that is reported to 
have beneficial effects on brain structure and function [33, 34]. Indeed, fish, omega-3 fatty 
acids and linolenic acid (an omega-3 PUFA) were associated with larger cortical thickness in 
the present study. Vegetables and legumes may be important because of their high 
micronutrient content (vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals), anti-oxidant and anti-
inflammatory effects as well as other factors.
Most vegetables (e.g. broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, mushrooms, green beans) consist of 
complex carbohydrates or complex starches that have a zero or low glycemic index and low 
glycemic load, as do legumes (e.g. beans, lentils, and chickpeas). Vegetables are also

 beneficial because they have a low caloric density, increase satiety, and thereby can help 
reduce weight gain. Legumes are also high in plant protein. Thus, in general, vegetables are 
less likely to adversely impact glucose metabolism and neuronal integrity. A few vegetables, 
however, have a high glycemic index and glycemic load (e.g. corn and potatoes) and could 
adversely impact glucose and insulin metabolism and cortical thickness. Fewer yet, have a 
relatively moderate to high glycemic index, but a very low glycemic load (e.g. parsnip, 
carrots, and beets). Overall, our findings are consistent with the anticipated beneficial effect 
of vegetables. Whole grains and cereals may also have beneficial effects for the same 
reasons as described for vegetables.
Fruit on the other hand, is a beneficial MeDi component and a source of antioxidants and 
vitamins, but was negatively associated with cortical thickness. Several fruits have a high 
content of simple sugars and a high glycemic index that may offset the benefits at high 
intakes. Our findings are consistent with a study from the Washington Heights-Inwood 
Community Project, that also reported that higher fruit intake was associated with lower 
temporal and hippocampal volumes [17]. The association of fruit with cortical thickness, 
however, should be interpreted in the context of the study design and the age of study 
participants. Older persons may have a high intake of fruit because it is perceived to be 
healthy, easily digested, requires little preparation, and tastes good. However, moderation of 
fruit intake may be necessary, particularly for diets deficient in other beneficial foods, and 
because older adults are typically less active and the mitigating effects of physical activity or 
exercise may not be realized. The association of fruit with cortical thickness in the present 
study, therefore, may not be applicable to younger age groups who are more active and have 
a more varied and healthy diet. Our findings, however, raise the question that in elderly 
persons, high intake of foods with a high glycemic index or high glycemic load, whether as 
fruit or as highly refined carbohydrates, may disrupt insulin signaling, impair glucose 
metabolism, and thereby contribute to neuronal loss, reduced cortical thickness, and 
cognitive impairment. Indeed, we previously reported that high percentage intakes of daily 
calories derived from carbohydrate and sugar was associated with an increased risk of MCI 
[9].
Our findings are in keeping with other studies on diet and MRI biomarkers. In a cross-
sectional study, higher adherence to the MeDi was associated with larger cortical thickness 
in the entorhinal, orbitofrontal and the posterior cingulate cortex regions [16]. In the 
Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project, higher MeDi score, higher fish 
intake and lower meat intake were positively associated with larger mean cortical thickness, 
and lower red meat intake was associated with larger cortical thickness in the superior-
frontal region [17]. In a clinical trial among older adults, parietal, frontal and cingulate 
cortex volumes increased or were maintained in persons treated with omega-3 fatty acid 
supplementation, exercise and cognitive stimulation, but decreased in the control arm [34]. 
The positive association of MeDi with larger thickness in the frontal lobe suggests that the 
MeDi may favorably modulate cortical thickness through vascular mechanisms; this is 
consistent with the known beneficial effects of the MeDi on cardiovascular health and with 
the reported association of frontal lobe atrophy with cerebrovascular disease [35, 36]. Our 
findings are also consistent with positive associations of micronutrients (vitamins) and 
omega-3 fatty acids with larger total brain volume in non-demented persons [13].
Staubo et al.

 The present findings are also consistent with reported beneficial effects of MeDi and MeDi 
components on risk of mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia in prospective [4, 26, 
37] and cross-sectional studies [10, 11]. Higher plasma levels of omega-3 fatty acid were 
associated with a reduced risk of dementia in the Framingham Heart Study [38] and in the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study [39]. In a clinical trial among MCI patients, B 
vitamins had beneficial effects on cognition in persons with high omega-3 fatty acids [40]. 
Micronutrients (vitamins) have also been positively associated with cognition [26, 41, 42].
In general, associations of non-beneficial components of the MeDI with cortical thickness 
measures were as expected. Saturated and transfats are unhealthy due to adverse 
cardiovascular effects, and have been associated with greater cognitive decline and risk of 
dementia [4, 43–45]. High red meat intake has been shown to be detrimental to cognition 
including dementia [4]. Consistent with this, we observed a negative association of red meat 
with inferior and superior parietal cortical thickness. However, we also unexpectedly 
observed a positive association with larger entorhinal cortex thickness. The potential 
mechanism is unclear; we speculate that it could relate to some beneficial components of 
lean red meat (e.g. iron, protein, MUFA and PUFA) [46] and beneficial effects in increasing 
satiety and reducing weight gain. Fatty red meats and processed meats on the other hand are 
unlikely to be beneficial due to their high saturated fat content. Our findings remain to be 
validated.
In contrast to studies on cognitive impairment [44, 47], we did not find significant beneficial 
associations of MUFA/saturated fat ratio with MRI biomarkers. Failure to observe 
associations of MeDi or MeDi components with hippocampal volume is consistent with 
findings from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative in which presymptomatic 
individuals had significantly reduced cortical thickness in AD vulnerable regions compared 
to controls, but did not differ in regard to hippocampal volume [29].
There are potential limitations to our study. The FFQ was not administered concurrently 
with MRI, but the diet or MRI biomarkers are unlikely to have changed markedly in the 
short time interval between completing the FFQ and imaging. The cross-sectional design 
precludes our ability to make causal inferences; however, it allows us to generate hypotheses 
for future studies. Despite the potential for reporting bias, FFQs assessing intakes over 
longer periods as in this study are reportedly more reliable than short term recall [48]. 
Furthermore, FFQs reliably rank individuals in regard to food intake and are useful for large 
epidemiologic studies, in contrast to daily diaries that are not feasible for large 
epidemiologic studies. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons to reduce the likelihood 
of falsely rejecting potentially relevant associations [32]. Despite this, several observed 
associations are biologically plausible and consistent with the expected associations based 
on published literature. Finally, MRI participants were healthier than non-participants; thus, 
we may have underestimated the strength of the associations.
Our study has several strengths. The population-based design reduced potential selection 
bias. The study consisted of a large sample of participants who were cognitively normal and 
unaware of their brain morphology when completing the FFQ, thereby minimizing potential 
recall bias in reporting of dietary intakes. Participants were characterized as cognitively

 normal by 3 independent evaluators and underwent state of the art MRI. The study assessed 
associations of several dietary measures with MRI biomarkers of atrophy or 
neurodegeneration, generating hypotheses for prospective studies. If validated prospectively, 
the associations will inform the development of non-pharmacologic interventions for 
maintaining cortical thickness and thereby reducing the risk of cognitive impairment and AD 
dementia.

 RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1.
Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using established 
methods (PubMed) to identify abstracts and publications that have 
investigated the associations of dietary measures with brain magnetic 
resonance imaging measures. Despite the abundance of studies on the 
association of the Mediterranean and other dietary pattern or nutrients with 
cognition, few studies examined the association of diet with brain MRI 
measures.
2.
Interpretation: We observed positive associations of higher MeDi Score with 
cortical thickness measures. We hypothesize that a potential mechanism for 
the beneficial association of the Mediterranean diet on cognition is that 
adherence to this diet may maintain cortical thickness. Since cortical thinning 
is associated with late life mild cognitive impairment and dementia, the 
current findings have implications for diet as a lifestyle measure that may 
reduce the risk of these conditions.
3.
Future directions: The current cross-sectional study cannot assess causality. 
Therefore, in a future study, we will prospectively investigate whether persons 
with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet have a reduced risk of 
cortical atrophy assessed from longitudinal changes in cortical thickness 
measures during follow-up in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
