change that did not involve global memory impairments or increased anxiety. Using the neuropeptide oxytocin as a tool to increase
neurogenesis in the hippocampus of disrupted rats restored preference for novel conspecifics to predisruption levels. Conversely,
reducing the number of new neurons by limited inhibition of adult neurogenesis in naive transgenic GFAP–thymidine kinase rats
resulted in social behavior similar to disrupted rats. Together, these results provide novel mechanistic evidence that social disruption
shapes behavior in a potentially adaptive way, possibly by reducing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

Introduction
Social instability is associated with an increased risk of mental
illness, including depression and anxiety disorders in humans
(Vives et al., 2011; Bossarte et al., 2013). Although instability can
be a health risk, social disruption is a normal part of life, because
peer groups and interpersonal relationships change with age and
circumstances. Despite acute risks to mental health, studies show
that humans display long-term resilience and use various coping
strategies even in response to chronic instability (Khoshaba and
Maddi, 1999; Gunnar et al., 2009; Cutuli et al., 2013). Similar to
humans, rodents display negative consequences to short-term
social disruption but often recover completely unless social inter-
actions are predominantly aversive, as in the case of chronic so-
cial defeat (McCormick and Green, 2013; Bourke et al., 2014).
Nonetheless, the vast majority of studies on social instability in
rodents have been designed to ensure negative outcomes, with
relatively little research focused on adaptation and its cellular
mechanisms (McCormick et al., 2012, 2015; Branchi et al.,
2013a,b).
In the wild, rats form social hierarchies in which a period of
intensefightingisfollowedbystabilizationwhenthemostaggressive
ratemergesasthedominant(Kramesetal.,1969).Thisarrangement
coincides with a reduction in fighting, because nondominant mem-
bers of the group adjust their behavior in response to the dominant.
Although hierarchy stability can be lasting, destabilization is com-
mon, occurring as a result of death, aging, or illness of a dominant

Significance Statement
To investigate cellular processes underlying adaptation to social instability, a dominance hierarchy of rats was formed and then
destabilized. Regardless of social position, rats from disrupted hierarchies had fewer new neurons in the hippocampus compared
with rats from control cages and those from stable hierarchies. Unexpectedly, these changes were accompanied by changes in
social strategies without evidence of impairments in cognition or anxiety regulation. Restoring adult neurogenesis in disrupted
rats using oxytocin and conditionally suppressing the production of new neurons in socially naive GFAP–thymidine kinase rats
showed that loss of 6-week-old neurons may be responsible for adaptive changes in social behavior.

 rat, a rogue rat joining the group, or a change in habitat conditions
(Barnett, 1958). Because such behavior is difficult to study in the
wild, the visible burrow system (VBS) was designed to mimic semi-
naturalistic social living for rats in a laboratory setting (Blanchard et
al.,1991,1995,2013).DominantratsinastablehierarchyintheVBS

pared with subordinate rats (Kozorovitskiy and Gould, 2004), but
no previous studies have explored the effects of hierarchy destabili-
zation on the brain and behavior. Because adult neurogenesis in the
hippocampus has been linked to a variety of functions, including
anxiety/stress regulation and cognition (Dupret et al., 2008; Snyder
et al., 2011; Opendak and Gould, 2015), it is likely that changes
related to dominance hierarchy destabilization could have impor-
tant behavioral consequences. To investigate this further, we ex-
plored the effects of living in stable and unstable hierarchies on new
neuron production in the hippocampus and on behaviors that have
been associated with this brain region. We found that differences
between dominants and subordinates in adult neurogenesis were
eliminatedwhenthehierarchywasdisrupted.Wefurtherfoundthat
new neuron production in the hippocampus was consistently lower
after social disruption. Despite suppressed neurogenesis, rats from

chiesprefernoveloverfamiliarratswhileresting,ratsfromdisrupted
hierarchies exhibit the converse preference of familiar over novel
rats.
Next, we used two approaches to investigate whether these
behavioral effects are linked to a reduction in the number of new
neurons. We used the neuropeptide oxytocin to stimulate adult
neurogenesis (Leuner et al., 2012) immediately after social dis-
ruption and tested behavior several weeks later, at a time when
new neurons would have incorporated into the circuitry. We
found that this manipulation had no effect on anxiety-like behav-
ior but prevented the social preference for familiar conspecifics.
Then, we used transgenic conditional neurogenesis knock-out
[GFAP–thymidine kinase (TK)] rats to reduce new neuron num-
ber in rats (Snyder et al., 2016) without social disruption experi-
ence and found that these rats had control levels of anxiety-like
behavior but social resting preference for familiar conspecifics.
Our results show that social disruption produces a resilient phe-
notype, with reduced anxiety, generally preserved cognition, and
a change in social preference and that suppressed neurogenesis in
the hippocampus may play a role in this latter outcome.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the Princeton University Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to guidelines
of the National Research Council. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (6–8
weeks of age, Taconic Farms) were housed on a 12 h light/dark reverse
light cycle with lights off at 7:00 A.M. and ad libitum access to food and
water. Adult female Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic) were used as stimulus
animals in the VBS studies (see below). Sprague Dawley rats were used
because this relatively docile strain can be group-housed in a VBS with-
out risks of injurious fighting. For neurogenesis knock-out experiments
in rats not subjected to VBS living, adult male Long–Evans GFAP-TK
transgenic rats were used (Snyder et al., 2016). Controls for behavioral
studies using neurogenesis knock-out rats were GFAP-TK rats not
treated with the drug that activates the transgene [valganciclovir (GCV)].
Controls for the corticosterone (CORT) study using neurogenesis
knock-out rats were Long–Evans wild-type rats.
Animal housing
Sprague Dawley rats were housed in groups of four males and two fe-
males in a modified version of the VBS (Kozorovitskiy and Gould, 2004;
Fig. 1B). The VBS was made from wood and Plexiglas, with opaque wood
side panels and transparent Plexiglas tunnels and chambers. The VBS
consisted of an open field area (36 � 36 inches), covered by bedding
material lit by an overhead fluorescent light during the light phase and a
red light bulb during the dark phase of the reverse 12 h light/dark cycle.
Red light illumination allowed for videotaping in the dark to determine
dominance status of the rats. Standard laboratory rat cages were used for
controls and the post-VBS housing portions of the experiments.
GFAP-TK rats were also housed in standard cages.
Social disruption manipulation
Rats were marked with black dye in different patterns for identification
on videotapes before placement in the VBS. To determine which rat
emerged as the dominant by the end of 3 d, each colony of four males was
videotaped for 10 h during the dark phase for each day in the VBS. Three
days is sufficient time for establishing dominance hierarchies among
male Sprague Dawley rats (Kozorovitskiy and Gould, 2004). In each
cohort, a dominant rat was selected based on the quantity of offensive
relative to defensive behaviors. Behavioral measurements were sampled
hourly from videotapes, in 10-min-long intervals, adding up to the total
of 300 min per colony. Male-to-male dyadic interactions involving chas-
ing, lateral attacks, boxing, and fighting on ramps were scored as in-
stances of offensive behavior; fleeing the open field and underside
exposure were scored as defensive actions (Blanchard et al., 1995; Kozo-
rovitskiy and Gould, 2004). For each male, the number of defensive acts
was subtracted from the number of offensive acts over the entire 300 min
sampling period, yielding one score. The rat with the highest score was
designated as the dominant, and the other three males in the colony were
considered subordinate. On day 4, the dominant rats were switched be-
tween two VBS communities. After the disruption, rats were videotaped
during the dark phase for 3 more days to determine whether stable hier-
archies re-emerged among the new configurations. Behavior during the
active period was sampled for 300 min as described above, and each rat’s
aggressive and defensive actions were tallied to determine postswitch
changes in aggression and hierarchy dynamics. On day 7, rats were re-
turned to individual home cages until perfusion. Individual housing was
used after the social disruption paradigm to prevent effects of additional
social experience after group living in the VBS.
For comparison purposes with this study, additional cohorts of rats
lived in standard laboratory cages (control) or in nondisrupted hierar-
chies (stable). Rats living in stable hierarchies remained in their initial
cohorts for 6 d before being returned to individual housing. The rats
living in standard cages were housed in pairs for 3 d with ad libitum access
to food and water. On day 4, one rat from each pair was switched with
another from a separate cage to determine whether a change in cage mate
was sufficient to induce social disruption effects. Rats continued to live in
these configurations for 3 d and then were moved to individual housing,
as described above.
Rats from all groups (disrupted VBS, stable VBS, cage control) were
perfused at either a 2 or 6 week time point relative to the start of the
experiment. The first time point was used to examine effects on imma-
ture neuron production, whereas the second time point was selected
because it is sufficient for neurons generated during social experience to
become functionally integrated into the existing hippocampal circuitry
and affect performance on hippocampus-dependent tasks (Snyder et al.,
2009).
Drug treatments and perfusions
Rats received equimolar injections of thymidine analogs iododeoxyuri-
dine (IdU; 57.5 mg/kg, i.p.; MP Biomedicals) on day 3 and chlorode-
oxyuridine (CldU; 42.5 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich) on day 6. Selective
BrdU antibody sensitivities for IdU versus CldU allow for distinct assays
of cell proliferation before and after our manipulation (Vega and Peter-
son, 2005; Leuner et al., 2009).
Separate groups of rats living in disrupted hierarchies were treated
with the neuropeptide oxytocin (1 mg/kg, i.p.; Bachem) for 7 d after
7028 • J. Neurosci., June 29, 2016 • 36(26):7027–7038

 return to individual housing at a dose shown to increase adult neuro-
genesis in the hippocampus (Leuner et al., 2012). Rats were either
perfused at 1 week after the last oxytocin injection (2 weeks after
social disruption) to assess the effects of oxytocin treatment on im-
mature neurons or remained in individual housing until behavioral
testing at a 6 week time point to allow for adult-born neurons to affect
performance on hippocampus-dependent tasks.
For GFAP–TK experiments, beginning at 8 weeks of age, pair-housed
TK rats were treated with 4.0 mg of GCV (Valcyte; Roche) per half-gram
of peanut butter. Previous studies have shown that oral administration is
an effective way to deliver this drug (Snyder et al., 2011; 2016). Rats were
fed the peanut butter treat twice weekly for 2 weeks and received injec-
tions of BrdU (200 mg/kg, i.p.; Roche) after the second drug treatment
each week. The rats remained pair-housed and were perfused 6 weeks
after the first GCV treatment. Control TK rats received peanut butter
without GCV.
Hormone assays
Additional cohorts of rats were used to examine the effects of social
disruption on basal levels of CORT and testosterone. These rats lived in
either cage control or disrupted VBS conditions and received sham in-
jections on day 3, and trunk blood was rapidly collected within 3 min of
capture on day 6 at lights on. After the blood was centrifuged, plasma was
collected, and circulating CORT and testosterone (in nanograms per
milliliter) were measured using a radioimmunoassay (Coat-A-Count;
Siemens). Assay sensitivity was 98.5%. To determine whether GFAP–TK
rats with inhibited neurogenesis have altered baseline stress hormone
levels, additional pair-housed GFAP–TK rats and wild-type controls
were treated with GCV as described above. Blood was collected from the
tail vein within 3 min of cage opening, and the serum was analyzed for
CORT as described above.
Behavioral measures
For behavioral analysis at the 6 week time point, rats were tested on object
location, elevated plus maze, and social recognition/preference. These
tests were used because they are known to involve the hippocampus
and/or appear to be affected by changes in adult neurogenesis (McHugh
et al., 2004; Mak and Weiss, 2010; Morris et al., 2013). Rats were tested on
these three measures over 2 d, with the order of testing counterbalanced.
Rats were perfused the day after the last test. On each testing day, rats
were habituated to the testing room for at least 30 min before the first test
of the day.
Object location. To assess recognition of a novel location for a previ-
ously encountered object, rats were placed in an open field with opaque
walls (17.5 � 17.5 � 17.5 inches) with two identical objects (plastic, each
�36 cubic inches) for 3 min (Barker and Warburton, 2011). Rats were

 removed for 5 min while one of the objects was moved to the opposite
side of the chamber. The left/right position of the moved object was
counterbalanced between each rat. Rats were then returned to the
chamber for 3 min. A discrimination ratio was calculated for time spent
investigating the moved object versus the object that was not moved.
Investigating the moved object more than the nonmoved object is con-
sidered to be evidence for object location memory.
Anxiety testing. To assess anxiety-like behavior, the elevated plus maze
was used (Pellow and File, 1986; Lister, 1987; Walf and Frye, 2007; Staples
and Cornish, 2014). Rats were placed on an elevated plus-shaped track
(44 � 44 � 20 inches). Two of the arms had high walls (13 inches),
whereas the other two arms and central intersection were open. All arms
were 20 inches in length, dimly lit by reflected light. Exploratory behavior
was measured for 5 min and analyzed. Number of entries into the open
and closed arms and time spent in the open arms were measured for each
rat. Because the open arms are more exposed to the light and open air,
more time spent in the open arms is considered a measure of reduced
anxiety (Sun et al., 2013). Total entries into both closed and open arms
are considered a measure of locomotion (File and Aranko, 1988).
Social recognition and novelty preference testing. Social recognition and
novelty preference were tested using an apparatus based on previous
social behavior studies done in mice, with dimensions scaled up to ac-
commodate rats (Engelmann et al., 1995; Moy et al., 2004; Crawley, 2007;
Eagle et al., 2013). This apparatus was made of Plexiglas and was 40 �
10 � 12 inches. Removable Plexiglas dividers perforated with 1-cm-
diameter holes were placed on each side of the apparatus to create two
side chambers that were each 10 � 10 � 10 inches. These walls allowed
the test rat to see, smell, and hear stimulus rats while preventing the
possibility of physical interaction. Before testing, test rats were placed in
a standard cage with a novel rat for 5 min, because this time is sufficient
to produce social recognition 30 min later (Thor and Holloway, 1982;
Popik et al., 1992). Twenty-five minutes after the end of the 5 min expo-
sure, test rats were placed in the social recognition apparatus for a 5 min
habituation; during this period, the side chambers were empty. After this
habituation, the familiar rat was placed in one chamber and a novel rat
was placed in the other chamber. The side of the chamber with the
familiar rat was counterbalanced for each rat. Behavior of the test rat was
recorded and analyzed for grooming, rearing, investigation, and resting
on each half of the apparatus. Investigation was defined as active sniffing
of each Plexiglas wall and was analyzed to assess recognition of the famil-
iar rat (van der Kooij and Sandi, 2012). After a 10 min testing phase, all
rats were returned to home cages. The discrimination ratio of time spent
investigating each rat over the total time investigating both rats was cal-
culated. The discrimination ratio was also calculated for total time spent
resting near each rat, excluding investigation time, to assess rats’ resting
social novelty preference behavior. To assess social novelty preference
behavior in additional detail, resting behavior after investigation (cross-
ing to the other side of the chamber vs staying on the same side) was
measured for each rat. In addition, we assessed incomplete and reversed
crossings from one side of the testing apparatus to the other as a potential
measure of vicarious trial and error (VTE; Redish 2016).
Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were measured for the duration of the
social preference study using the UltraSoundGate 116Hb recorder (116Hb/
41; Avisoft Bioacoustics) and analyzed using Avisoft-RECORDER and
SASLab Lite software. Recordings were analyzed for 22 and 50 kHz vocaliza-
tions, typically associated with threatening and rewarding stimuli, respec-
tively (Brudzynski, 2013).
Histology
At 2 or 6 weeks, rats were anesthetized with Euthasol and perfused with
4.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. At 48 h after fixation,
coronal sections (40 �m) were cut throughout the entire rostrocaudal
extent of the dentate gyrus (DG) on a vibratome into a bath of 0.1 M PBS,
pH 7.5. Brains were analyzed for the following: (1) IdU, to assess the
survival of new neurons generated before social disruption; (2) CldU, to
assess the proliferation and survival of new neurons generated after social
disruption; (3) BrdU, to assess the number of new neurons generated in
GFAP–TK rats fed GCV or vehicle; (4) doublecortin (DCX), to label
immature neurons; (5) GFAP, to determine changes in glial cells; (6)
Sox2, to determine changes in pluripotent progenitors; and (7) Sox2/
GFAP colabeling to assess changes in radial glia-like precursors. Because
receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin are expressed in the hippocampus
(both neuropeptides are involved in social behavior, stress responses,
and neurogenesis; Albeck et al., 1997; Alonso et al., 2004; Leuner et al.,
2012) and oxytocin receptor (OTR) binding has been shown to increase
in the ventral hippocampus with stress (Liberzon and Young, 1997), we
examined OTRs and vasopressin 1a receptors (V1aRs), the main vaso-
pressin receptor type expressed in the hippocampus. We also analyzed
OTR/Ki67 � and V1aR/Ki67 � colabeling to assess the expression pat-
terns of OTRs and V1aRs on proliferating neuronal precursors. All im-
munolabeling was performed on sections from groups to be compared
simultaneously to minimize variability. We also examined the immuno-
labeling pattern for OTR and V1aR in the hypothalamus to verify that
both antibodies produce staining results that are consistent with binding
data (Tribollet et al., 1988; Kremarik et al., 1995). Dorsal and ventral
distinctions were made within hippocampal hemisections according to
published guidelines (Banasr et al., 2006).
For IdU/CldU/BrdU peroxidase staining, a 1:12 series of sections was
mounted onto glass slides and stained according to established protocols
(Leuner et al., 2009). For microscopic data analysis, the slides were coded,
and IdU/CldU/BrdU-labeled cells in the granule cell layer (GCL), sub-
granular zone (SGZ), and the hilus were counted on every 12th half-
section through the DG with 100� oil objective on an Olympus BX-60
microscope. The numbers were tallied for the DG and GCL–SGZ and
multiplied by 24 to obtain a stereological estimate for the brain region.
Double labeling with immunofluorescence for IdU/CldU and the im-
mature neuronal marker DCX or BrdU and the neuronal marker neuro-
nal nuclei (NeuN) was performed on free-floating sections to determine
whether the newly labeled cells were immature neurons according to
established protocols (Kempermann et al., 2003). For double labeling,
the percentage of IdU/CldU-labeled GCL cells expressing DCX was de-
termined by analyzing 25 IdU/CldU-labeled cells per brain using a Zeiss
Axiovert confocal laser scanning microscope (510 LSM; argon 458/488
nm and helium–neon 543 nm). For examining endogenous markers of
immature neurons and progenitor cells, the tissue was incubated in pri-
mary antibodies against DCX, Sox2, Ki67, and GFAP according to pre-
viously published protocols (Suh et al., 2007; Lugert et al., 2010).
For labeling OTRs and V1aRs, free-floating tissue was incubated with
rabbit anti-OTR (1:150; Alpha Diagnostics) and rabbit anti-V1aR (1:150;
Alpha Diagnostics). For cell density measurements, tissue was counter-
stained using Hoechst 33342 (1:1000; Invitrogen), and volume measure-
ments of the DG were taken using StereoInvestigator software (MBF
Bioscience). Total DCX �, Sox2 �, and GFAP � (radial and horizontal
morphologies) were counted on every 12th half-section through the DG
with 100� oil objective on an Olympus BX-60 microscope. The raw
counts for each section were divided by the volume of the DG to obtain a
density measurement. Fifty Sox2 � cells in the DG (25 dorsal, 25 ventral)
per brain were scanned and analyzed for GFAP � colabeling using a Zeiss
Axiovert confocal laser scanning microscope (510 LSM; argon 458/488
nm and helium–neon 543 nm). A distinction was made between GFAP
cells with radial and horizontal morphology because previous studies
have shown that GFAP �/Sox2 � cells with radial morphology represent
radial glia-like precursor cells with stem cell-like properties, whereas
GFAP �/Sox2 � cells with horizontal morphology represent type 2a in-
termediate/transit amplifying progenitor cells that are not yet neuronally
committed (Lugert et al., 2010).
OTR and V1aR expression was measured for mean optical intensity
using 1-�m-thick optical sections of the DG. For these analyses, the DG
within a single hemisection was imaged in its entirety, with 10 images
obtained for each brain. Five representative 1 �m optical slices from the
dorsal and ventral DG were scanned and measured for optical intensity
from each brain using a Zeiss Axiovert confocal laser scanning micro-
scope (510 LSM; argon 458/488 nm and helium–neon 543 nm). Intensity
was calculated using LSM 510 software. Regions of interest (ROIs) were
manually defined to include the dorsal GCL and ventral GCL. The fornix
was used for a measure of background staining because this region had
no OTR or V1aR staining in any of the brains analyzed. Raw ROI inten-
sity values were divided by fornix intensity within the same pixel-size

 ROI on the same scan of each slice to control for variability in staining
intensity between sections. Normalized brightness per ROI was deter-
mined for each pixel of a given ROI as the fractional increase in bright-
ness at that pixel over the mean brightness of the fornix, according to the
following formula: (mean intensity of the region � mean intensity back-
ground)/mean intensity background. To analyze OTR and V1aR staining
on individual Ki67 � proliferating cells, 50 Ki67 � cells were scanned
from the DG within a hemisection (25 dorsal, 25 ventral). Using LSM 510
software, each Ki67 � cell body was traced, and the brightness of OTR or
V1aR pixels was determined within the tracing. This was assessed with
respect to the background brightness within an area of the same size of
the tracing adjacent to each labeled cell (Siegel et al., 1993; Schoenfeld et
al., 2014).
Statistical analysis
Depending on the number of groups in an experiment, unpaired Stu-
dent’s t tests or one or two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s post
hoc comparisons were used.
Results
Social disruption results in increased aggression and
dominance hierarchy destabilization
Throughout the 6 d period of living in the VBS, the overall level of
aggression changed significantly (F(2,14) � 12.97, p � 0.001; Fig.
1C). Between days 1 and 3, the level of aggression decreased for
both groups (stable and disrupted; p � 0.005). In stable cohorts,
aggression did not change from day 3 to 6 (3.87 � 0.56 vs 4.09 �
0.60 acts/rat, t(8) � �0.27, p � 0.821), but in disrupted cohorts,
after the dominant rats were switched between two hierarchies,
the level of aggression increased significantly from day 3 to 6 (p �
0.001; Fig. 1C).
Postdisruption aggression levels were also significantly higher
than day 1 aggression levels (p � 0.0001; Fig. 1C). Switched dom-
inants showed a significant decrease in dominance score (aggres-
sive acts � defensive acts) from 5.7 � 1.6 to 0.2 � 1.5 [two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA, interaction of phase (before switch
vs after switch), and dominance score, F(1,38) � 10.294, p �
0.003]. In every instance, switching dominants led to a loss of
dominant status for these animals. In other words, hierarchy dis-
ruption led to an increase in aggression that exceeded that of
naive rats placed in the VBS for the first time, as well as to a
reorganization of the social hierarchy with no evidence of a clear
dominant, and loss of position by previously dominant rats.
Social disruption suppresses adult neurogenesis in
the hippocampus
Consistent with previous results (Kozorovitskiy and Gould,
2004), we found that dominants in a stable hierarchy had more
new neurons in the ventral DG than subordinates (IdU, 6552 �
840 in dominants vs 4448 � 480 in subordinates, t(13) � 2.41; p �
0.032). However, social disruption eliminated the advantage of
being dominant in dominants (IdU, 3300 � 607 in dominants vs
2762 � 218 in subordinates, t(13) � �1.07, p�0.3). Because the
dominant � subordinate difference in new cell number in stable
groups was no longer present in socially disrupted groups and
was irrelevant for control groups, data were collapsed across
dominance status for subsequent analyses, and experiments fo-
cused on control compared with disrupted hierarchy groups. No
differences were observed between rats that were pair-housed in
standard cages and those that were switched between cages, sug-
gesting that switching location or being housed with a new con-
specific did not alter baseline levels of neurogenesis (e.g., for
ventral DG IdU, 4824 � 363 in switched vs 5580 � 1222 in
nonswitched; t(6) � 0.59; p � 0.57). Furthermore, no differences
were observed between control and stable VBS cohorts (exclud-
ing dominant rats) on any measure of cell proliferation or adult
neurogenesis (p � 0.05 for all comparisons), suggesting that liv-
ing in a VBS, even under stable conditions, did not produce any
measurable change in neurogenesis. As shown previously (Kozo-
rovitskiy and Gould, 2004), cage controls and subordinates in a
stable hierarchy did not differ on measures of adult neurogenesis.
Thus, subsequent comparisons were made between nonswitched
control and disrupted groups.
Social disruption produced a decrease in the numbers of neu-
ronal precursor cells and immature neurons compared with con-
trol groups at the 2 week time point. The number of Sox2 � cells
(t(6) � �2.68, p�0.037) and GFAP � cells with radial morphol-
ogy (t(6) � �3.73, p�0.01) were decreased in the ventral DG after
social disruption compared with control (Fig. 1E,F). No changes
were observed in horizontal GFAP � cells (p � 0.53), the propor-
tion of radial to horizontal cells (p � 0.23), or the degree of
colabeling of Sox2 and GFAP (p � 0.26) with social disruption,
indicating that the observed decreases were in Sox2 �/GFAP �
radial glia-like precursor cells. In addition, no changes were ob-
served on any of these measures in the dorsal DG (p � 0.05 for all
such comparisons). Social disruption also produced a decrease in
the number of immature neurons (labeled with DCX) in the
ventral DG compared with controls at the 2 week time point
(t(6) � 3.07, p � 0.022; Fig. 1E,F). Similar to what was observed
for neuronal precursors, the suppressive effects of social disrup-
tion on DCX � cells were not seen in the dorsal DG (p � 0.21).
Social disruption also decreased the number of new cells in the
ventral DG labeled before the disruption (IdU, t(21) � 4.31, p �
0.002), as well as the number of new cells in the ventral DG
labeled after the disruption (CldU, t(22) � 4.32, p � 0.001) com-
pared with controls at the 2 week time point (Fig. 1D,F). No
differences were observed in the numbers of IdU � or CldU � cells
in the SVZ, suggesting that these effects may have been specific to
the hippocampus (p � 0.05 for all comparisons).
More than 80% of IdU � and CldU � cells colabeled with the
immature neuronal marker DCX. There were no differences in
the percentage of IdU- or CldU-labeled cells that expressed DCX
among any of the groups examined (p � 0.05), suggesting that
the changes in IdU- or CldU-labeled cell number associated with
disruption represent suppressed adult neurogenesis.
At the 6 week time point, the difference between control and
disrupted groups in the ventral DG no longer existed for cells
generated before the disruption (IdU, 3141 � 295 in control vs
2621 � 323 in disrupted, p � 0.05), but a persistent decrease in
the number of cells generated after the disruption (CldU, 3174 �
416 in control vs 1854 � 169 in disrupted; t(6) � �2.94, p�0.026)
remained in this region. At the 6 week time point as well, there
were no persistent differences in the number of DCX � cells in the
ventral DG (4293 � 374 in control vs 5327 � 1129 in disrupted;
t(9) � �0.94, p � 0.372), suggesting that the rate of immature
neuron production had returned to baseline. The lower numbers
of DCX cells in this experiment may be attributable to the switch
in housing from group living to individual living. At the 6
week time point, there were no significant differences between
control and disrupted groups in the dorsal DG for any mea-
sure (p � 0.05).
Social disruption did not alter OTR � or V1aR � labeling in
proliferating cells in the DG
The staining pattern of both OTR and V1aR in the hypothalamus
(Fig. 1F) was similar to what has been reported in binding studies
(Tribollet et al., 1988; Kremarik et al., 1995), including high OTR
labeling in the ventromedial hypothalamus compared with the
Opendak et al. • Lasting Adaptations in Social Behavior
J. Neurosci., June 29, 2016 • 36(26):7027–7038 • 7031
 lateral hypothalamus, as well as high V1aR in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus compared with the surrounding regions, including the
medial preoptic area, suggesting that this labeling reflects recep-
tors for oxytocin and vasopressin. Also consistent with previous
reports showing that OTR binding was increased in the ventral
hippocampus of stressed rats (Liberzon and Young, 1997), we
observed increased optical intensity for OTR in disrupted hierar-
chy rats compared with controls in the ventral DG (t(10) � 2.72,
p � 0.022) but not dorsal DG (p � 0.05; Fig. 1G). There were no
differences in V1aR expression in dorsal or ventral DG between
disrupted and control groups (p � 0.05 for both comparisons).
OTR and V1aR expression was observed on Ki67 � proliferating
cells in the DG, but the proportion of Ki67 � cells that expressed
either of these receptors did not differ between groups in dorsal
or ventral DG (p � 0.05 for all comparisons; Fig. 1G).
Social disruption results in lower baseline levels of CORT
Plasma CORT levels differed among rats living in different
social settings on day 6 but not in a predicted manner. Al-
though we anticipated that social disruption would result in
elevated CORT levels, we found that it did not, at least persis-
tently. Instead, social disruption resulted in decreased baseline
CORT levels (102 � 36.1 ng/ml in control, 31.96 � 22.5 ng/ml
in disrupted; t(12) � 1.96, p � 0.036). Plasma testosterone
levels did not differ significantly between groups (106.1 � 27
ng/ml in control, 243.4 � 88.8 ng/ml in disrupted; p � 0.05).
Social disruption produced lasting changes in social
behavior without impairing performance on some
hippocampus-dependent tasks
Performance on the object location task did not differ between
rats from disrupted hierarchies and rats from standard group
housing (discrimination ratio, t(12) � 0.21, p � 0.05; Fig. 1H).
Preference for resting near objects located in novel versus familiar
locations was not detected in either group. On the elevated plus
maze, rats from disrupted hierarchies entered the open arms
more than controls and spent more time in the open arms than
controls (proportional entries into open arms, t(29) � 3.04, p �
0.004; time in open arms, t(20) � �2.26, p � 0.03; Fig. 1I).
Social recognition did not differ between the control and dis-
rupted groups, with both groups showing more time spent inves-
tigating a novel conspecific compared with a familiar conspecific
(two-way ANOVA of condition vs novelty, main effect of novelty,
F(1,55) � 9.29, p � 0.004), and total number of investigations of
novel or familiar rats did not differ between groups. However,
substantial differences were noted among the groups when social
resting preference was analyzed. Whereas control rats tended to
rest in the proximity of the novel rat, rats from a disrupted hier-
archy preferred to rest in the proximity of a familiar rat (control
preference compared with disrupted preference, t(14) � 2.83, p �
0.013; Fig. 2B). That is, disrupted rats had a greater propensity to
cross the chamber to rest near a familiar rat after investigation of
the novel rat (Fig. 2C). In contrast, control rats preferred to rest
near the novel rat after investigation of the novel rat (propor-
tional crosses to familiar after investigating novel, t(9) � 4.24, p �
0.002; Fig. 2C). We further analyzed the behavior of rats after
investigation of the novel rat and found that control rats often
initiated a movement path toward the opposite side of the social
chamber, in the direction of the familiar rat, but hesitated and
turned back to rest by the novel rat, suggesting a behavior similar
to what has been described as reflecting VTE in maze studies
(Redish, 2016). In contrast, disrupted rats displayed significantly
less VTE-like behavior and most often turned from the novel rat
after investigation and took a direct path to the familiar rat to rest.
In controls, VTE-like behavior occurred to a much lesser extent
after investigation of the familiar rat compared with the novel rat,
and this was unchanged in disrupted rats (see Fig. 5). Thus, com-
pared with controls, disrupted rats exhibited fewer instances of
VTE-like behavior after investigating the novel stimulus rat but
not the familiar stimulus rat (see Fig. 5; social disruption group �
stimulus rat interaction, F(1,16) � 8.67, p � 0.001). These results
appear independent of general anxiety measures within the social
preference apparatus, because we did not observe differences in
behavior during habituation to the social chamber (in the ab-
sence of conspecifics), including center crossing and active time
(Fig. 2D). After addition of conspecifics to the chamber, rearing
and grooming behavior, sometimes used as measures of anxiety
(Daniels et al., 2008), did not vary between control and disrupted
groups in either duration of these behaviors or side preference
(Fig. 2E,F; p � 0.05 for all comparisons). Furthermore, in the
presence of conspecifics, no test rats from either control or dis-
rupted groups emitted USVs in the 22 kHz range, which are
typically associated with threatening stimuli (Fig. 2G,H). Instead,
rats in both groups emitted 50 kHz vocalizations, which are typ-
ically associated with neutral or rewarding stimuli (Brudzynski,
2013). Together, these findings suggest that social disruption al-
ters social resting preference without adversely affecting social
recognition, object location memory, or social anxiety levels.
Oxytocin restored adult neurogenesis and social preference in
socially disrupted rats
As expected from previous findings (Leuner et al., 2012), daily
oxytocin treatment for 1 week after social disruption increased
DCX � cells in the ventral DG (t(16) � 2.37, p � 0.031) but not the
dorsal DG (t(18) � 0.56, p � 0.58; Fig. 3B,C). Four weeks after the
end of oxytocin treatment, oxytocin-treated rats did not show
any difference in anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze
compared with vehicle-treated rats (proportional time in open
arms, 0.21 � 0.06 in disrupted � vehicle vs 0.17 � 0.06 in dis-
rupted � oxytocin; t(14) � 0.44, p�0.66). Likewise, rats preferred
to investigate a novel rat over a familiar rat, regardless of whether
they had been treated with oxytocin (two-way ANOVA of condi-
tion vs novelty; main effect of novelty, F(1,13) � 6.59, p � 0.028).
As previously observed for socially disrupted rats (Fig. 2B), rats
from a disrupted hierarchy that received vehicle injections dis-
played a preference for resting near a familiar, as opposed to
novel, rat (Fig. 3C). This preference was reversed in socially dis-
rupted rats with oxytocin treatment (Fig. 3C). Rats that received
oxytocin lost their preference for familiarity, changing strategy to
rest near the novel, as opposed to the familiar, rat (t(30) � 3.13,
p � 0.003), similar to what was observed in naive rats without
social disruption (compare with Fig. 2B). These differences were
driven by both increased propensity to cross to the familiar side
to rest after novel investigation and remaining on the familiar
side to rest after investigating the familiar rat (Fig. 3D). In addi-
tion, rats that had restored neurogenesis after oxytocin treatment
showed an increase in VTE-like behavior after investigating the
novel stimulus rat that was comparable with controls (see Fig. 5),
whereas no change was observed in VTE-like behavior after in-
vestigating the familiar stimulus rat (see Fig. 5; oxytocin treat-
ment � stimulus rat interaction, F(1,12) � 18.62, p � 0.001).
These findings suggest that oxytocin treatment after social dis-
ruption restores levels of adult neurogenesis, and, 1 month after
oxytocin treatment, social resting preference behavior is restored
to control values without changing social recognition or general
anxiety-like behavior.

 Suppressed adult neurogenesis in socially naive GFAP–TK
rats reversed social preference
GCV treatment was effective in reducing adult neurogenesis in
GFAP–TK rats, because BrdU � cells were lower in both the dor-
sal and ventral DG compared with in GFAP–TK rats treated with
vehicle (t(15) � 2.56, p � 0.022 for dorsal DG; t(15) � 3.18, p �
0.006 for ventral DG; Fig. 4B). There was no effect of GCV treat-
ment on the proportion of BrdU � cells colabeled with NeuN in
the DG (0.91 � 0.04 for TK � vehicle vs 0.88 � 0.01 for TK �
GCV; t(8) � �0.77, p � 0.46), indicating that the number of new
neurons was decreased. Importantly, the decrease in new neu-
rons was not complete with this treatment of GCV and instead
quantitatively resembled the decrease we observed after social
disruption in wild types (compare Figs. 4B, 1D). GCV treatment
also decreased the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the SVZ from
3704 � 240 to 2436 � 180 (t(6) � �4.28, p � 0.008). When tested
behaviorally 6 weeks after the last GCV treatment, no significant
differences were observed between GCV- and vehicle-treated TK
rats on object location (0.22 � 0.19 for TK � vehicle vs 0.36 �
0.31 for TK � GCV; t(17) � 1.21, p � 0.2). There were also no
effects on the proportion of time spent in the open arms of the
elevated plus maze, indicating no difference in anxiety-like be-
havior (0.43 � 0.03 for TK � vehicle vs 0.49 � 0.01 for TK �
GCV; t(20) � 1.46, p � 0.15). In addition, social recognition did
not differ between vehicle- and GCV-treated rats (two-way
ANOVA of condition vs novelty; main effect of novelty, F(1,15) �
6.51, p � 0.03). Like socially disrupted wild-type rats, socially naive
GFAP–TK rats treated with GCV showed a preference for resting
nearafamiliarrat,whereassociallynaiveGFAP–TKratstreatedwith
vehicle showed a preference for resting near a novel rat (t(18) � 2.6,

Discussion
Our results show that disrupting an established dominance hier-
archy changes the rate of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus
and that these changes may be related to lasting adaptations in
social behavior. Social disruption suppressed the numbers of
progenitor cells and new neurons for all members of a dominance
group. At a later time when new neurons generated during social
disruption had time to integrate into the circuitry, rats from a
disrupted hierarchy exhibited a preference for resting near a fa-
miliar, rather than novel, rat, without notable impairments in
social recognition, cognition, or anxiety regulation. Increasing
adult neurogenesis with oxytocin administration after social dis-
ruption restored control-typical social preference behavior, and
suppressing adult neurogenesis with transgenic manipulation
produced a familiar preference in socially naive rats. These data
suggest that social disruption may fine tune subsequent social
behavior, at least in part, by reducing the number of new neurons
in the DG.
The reduction in the number of new neurons with social dis-
ruption was observed regardless of dominance position and may
have occurred as a result of the stressful effects of persistent ag-
gression (Cze
´h et al., 2002). However, somewhat paradoxically,
rats from a disrupted VBS exhibit lower levels of plasma CORT
than rats from stable hierarchies and control conditions. This
may reflect hypocortisolism, a phenomenon wherein chronic
stress downregulates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis
response (Yehuda et al., 1990; Rohleder et al., 2004). Although
this can lead to psychopathology, hypocortisolism may also re-
flect an adaptive response to chronic stress (McEwen, 1998; Fries
et al., 2005). The hippocampus is dense with OTRs, which may
play a role in lowering CORT levels after stress (Gimpl and Fahr-
enholz, 2001). The increase in hippocampal OTR immunolabel-
ing we observed with social disruption may be linked to lower
CORT levels. Along these lines, proactive stress-coping styles can
suppress basal CORT levels (Korte et al., 1996; Koolhaas et al.,
2010); increased aggression after social disruption and sup-
pressed anxiety-like behavior also suggest that our disrupted rats
have developed a proactive phenotype (Veenema and Neumann,
2007). Our observations are consistent with data showing proac-
tive coping (Garrett et al., 2015) and suppressed anxiety (Tsai et
al., 2015) in adult mice with conditional suppression of imma-
ture neurons (but see Snyder et al., 2011; Deng and Gage, 2015).
We used oxytocin administration to stimulate neurogenesis
after social disruption and found a reversal of the social behavior
change. Together with our findings that reduced adult neurogen-
esis in transgenic socially naive rats mimics the social behavior
change we observed with social disruption, these findings suggest
that a similar adult neurogenesis mechanism influences social
behavior in each case. However, we cannot rule out the possibility
that similar changes in social behavior are occurring through
different mechanisms in these conditions. Although oxytocin
manipulation ended 4 weeks before behavioral testing, postdis-

Opendak et al. • Lasting Adaptations in Social Behavior
 ruption oxytocin administration may still produce changes in
social behavior by acting through other mechanisms (Witt et al.,
1992; Lee et al., 2007; Lukas et al., 2011). Additional experiments
will be necessary to determine whether oxytocin treatment would
produce long-term changes in social behavior if adult neurogen-
esis levels were kept constant.
Changes in social preference behavior after social disruption
could reflect one of the following possibilities: (1) an inability to
distinguish novel from familiar conspecifics; (2) a decrease in the
natural preference for novelty; or (3) anxiety that causes stressed
rats to avoid novel rats. These possibilities seem unlikely, given
that socially disrupted rats in our studies showed no impairment
in recognizing novel rats, they investigated novel more than fa-
miliar rats (and for durations of time that were indistinguishable
from controls), and they demonstrated no obvious increase in
general anxiety-like behavior. In fact, socially disrupted rats ap-
peared to be less anxious than control rats on the elevated plus
maze. The possibility that preference for a familiar, rather than a
novel, rat reflects stress-induced social anxiety also seems un-
likely because, if this were the case, we would also expect to see
less investigation of the novel rat during initial exposure, which
was not observed.
A more detailed analysis of behavior in the social apparatus
suggested that disrupted rats may have diminished ability to op-

 timize decision making. This possibility is consistent with litera-
ture suggesting that the hippocampus participates in resolving
conflicts between different goals, particularly when they have
similar value, for use in decision-making (Johnson et al., 2007;
Bannerman et al., 2012; Doll et al., 2015; Palombo et al., 2015). In
our study, after bouts of social investigation, rats either sat with-
out moving to a different location or turned away from the inves-
tigated rat and began to traverse the testing apparatus. When
control rats turned away after investigating the novel rat, rather
than continuing to the other side of the testing apparatus, they
often hesitated and turned back toward the novel rat and re-
turned to rest there. In maze training, movements back and forth
at difficult choice points have been described as VTE behavior
and are considered as a reflection of working memory-dependent
deliberative decision-making (Tolman, 1938; Hu et al., 1997; Re-
dish, 2016). This behavior is diminished by lesions to the hip-
pocampus (Hu and Amsel, 1995; Bett et al., 2012). The turning
back behavior in our study may also reflect the outcome of a VTE
process, in which the rat predicts likely outcomes of different
actions. In controls, this VTE-like behavior was displayed to a
much lesser extent after investigating the familiar rat, suggesting
that its occurrence may reflect a greater difficulty in choosing to
leave the more rewarding novel rat. When rats with reduced levels
of adult neurogenesis (as a result of social disruption or trans-
genic inhibition) turned away from the investigated novel rat,
they engaged in significantly less turning back to rest by the novel
rat; instead, they more frequently continued to traverse the test-
ing apparatus and rested by the familiar rat. This pattern of be-
havior raises the possibility that new neurons may be involved in
choosing between moving back toward the rat that was investi-
gated less recently or returning to the rat that is generally more
novel. Because the investigation rate was higher on the novel side
for both groups, uninterrupted traversals led the experimental
group to rest more frequently near the familiar rat. Some evi-
dence suggests that new neurons can be activated in response to
novelty (Sandoval et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2012; Marrone et al.,
2012; Meconi et al., 2015) and are important in tasks requiring
flexible decision-making (Burghardt et al., 2012; Swan et al.,
2014), which has been associated with VTE (Redish, 2016). It may
be relevant to note that aging, which is associated with reduced
adult neurogenesis (Kuhn et al., 1996; Cameron and McKay,
1999; Heine et al., 2004; McDonald and Wojtowicz, 2005), also
results in diminished VTE maze behavior (Breton et al., 2015),
suggesting that this may be a mechanism that extends beyond
social behavior.
Studies have shown that stress-induced changes in behavior
may be adaptive in many circumstances (Lagace et al., 2010;
Petrik et al., 2012; Blanchard et al., 2013). In this light, a decrease
in novelty preference may signal a “survival-mode” optimization
of hippocampal function through stress-induced changes in
adult neurogenesis (Glasper et al., 2012). It is also possible that
control rats may have an exaggerated focus on novelty given that
their housing conditions lack much of the stimulation that is
typically present when living in the wild. The possibility that
individual housing interacts with the relevance of novelty is also
an additional important consideration. Although we housed rats
individually after the social disruption to avoid interference of
additional social experience, we cannot rule out the possibility
that some of our effects resulted from an interaction between
social disruption and social isolation. However, because our
GFAP–TK rats did not experience social disruption or social iso-
lation at any point in the study, this interpretation seems unlikely.
These findings demonstrate experience-induced change in
behavior after experience-induced suppression of adult neuro-
genesis. Together, these data suggest that suppression in neuro-
genesis in the DG during adulthood may produce lasting changes
in social behavior without causing obvious impairments in hip-
pocampal functions, such as object location memory and anxiety
regulation. The lack of effect on object location memory and
anxiety-like behavior with reduced adult neurogenesis is consis-
tent with data from naive mice lacking immature neurons (Gar-
rett et al., 2015; Seo et al., 2015). Our results challenge the more
established pattern of results wherein negative experiences tend
to suppress adult neurogenesis and impair cognitive perfor-
mance, as well as increase anxiety-like behavior (Leuner and
Gould, 2010). Social disruption indeed produces a suppression in
adult neurogenesis, but this does not appear to globally impair
hippocampal function and instead is associated with a social pref-
erence phenotype that may be adaptive rather than pathological.
Future work will be necessary to determine the mechanisms un-
derlying social disruption-induced suppression of adult neuro-
genesis, as well as the long-term consequences of altered social
preference behavior.
