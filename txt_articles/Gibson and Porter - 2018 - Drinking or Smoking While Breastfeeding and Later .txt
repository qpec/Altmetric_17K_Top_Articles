 Drinking or Smoking While 
Breastfeeding and Later 
Cognition in Children

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although prenatal alcohol and nicotine exposure are associated 
with reduced cognition in children, associations between consumption of alcohol during 
lactation and cognition have not been examined. We aimed to examine whether drinking 
or smoking while breastfeeding lowers children’s cognitive scores. We hypothesized 
that increased drinking or smoking would be associated with dose-dependent cognitive 
reductions.
METHODS: Data were sourced from Growing Up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of 
Australian Children. Participants were 5107 Australian infants recruited in 2004 and 
assessed every 2 years. Multivariable linear regression analyses assessed relationships 
between drinking and smoking habits of breastfeeding mothers and children’s Matrix 
Reasoning, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Third Edition and Who Am I? scores at later 
waves.
RESULTS: Increased or riskier wave 1 maternal alcohol consumption was associated with 
reductions in Matrix Reasoning scores at age 6 to 7 years in children who had been 
breastfed (B = −0.11; SE = 0.03; 95% confidence interval: −0.18 to −0.04; P = .01). This 
relationship was not evident in infants who had never breastfed (B = −0.02; SE = 0.10; 95% 
confidence interval = −0.20 to 0.17; P = .87). Smoking during lactation was not associated 
with any outcome variable.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposing infants to alcohol through breastmilk may cause dose-dependent 
reductions in their cognitive abilities. This reduction was observed at age 6 to 7 years 
but was not sustained at age 10 to 11 years. Although the relationship is small, it may be 
clinically significant when mothers consume alcohol regularly or binge drink. Further 
analyses will assess relationships between alcohol consumption or tobacco smoking during 
lactation and academic, developmental, physical, and behavioral outcomes in children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Although alcohol is a 
known teratogen, studies of maternal alcohol use during 
breastfeeding and infants’ basic developmental scores 
have produced mixed results. No previous study has 
assessed the impact of maternal drinking or smoking on 
cognitive outcomes in the child.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study to directly 
examine cognitive outcomes in relation to lactational 
alcohol and nicotine exposure. Increased or riskier 
maternal alcohol consumption while breastfeeding was 
associated with reduced abstract reasoning ability in the 
child at age 6 to 7 years.

 Although teratogenic effects of 
alcohol are well documented, 
1 
– 
4  
cognitive risks of alcohol and 
breastfeeding are unknown.5 
Likewise, although tobacco smoking 
during pregnancy is associated with 
reductions in childhood cognition, 
6  
cognitive effects from smoking 
tobacco during lactation have not 
been researched. Because alcohol7 
and nicotine8 are available in 
breastmilk after maternal intake, 
understanding whether smoking 
tobacco or drinking alcohol during 
lactation impacts children’s cognitive 
abilities is important.
Although the World Health 
Organization recommends 
avoiding alcohol and drugs while 
breastfeeding, 
9 12% to 83%5, 
 
10 
– 
16  
of breastfeeding women report 
consuming alcohol and 7% to 16%11, 
 
17 
report smoking tobacco. These 
may be underestimates because 
people often underreport alcohol 
drinking habits.18 Older maternal 
age, increased education, and longer 
breastfeeding duration are associated 
with increased alcohol consumption 
during lactation.11 Conversely, 
younger maternal age, lower 
education, and decreased income are 
associated with increased tobacco 
smoking.19
Breastfeeding women report 
drinking alcohol because of the 
lack of harmful evidence20 and a 
mistaken21 belief that alcohol is 
a galactagogue.20 Alcohol passes 
quickly through to breastmilk at 
similar concentrations to maternal 
blood alcohol concentration22 and 
reduces milk production.21 Although 
drinking alcohol immediately after 
feeding minimizes ethanol exposure, 
23 
 
not all women use this technique, 
16, 
 
20  
and unpredictable infant feeding 
can mar such attempts.20 Expressing 
and discarding “contaminated” 
breastmilk does not reduce ethanol 
concentration because this is 
related to maternal blood alcohol 
concentration.7
Nicotine also passes quickly 
through to breastmilk, in which 
concentrations may be higher than 
maternal serum concentrations.8 
Nicotine is associated with reduced 
milk production and changes in 
breastmilk composition and taste.24 
Breastfeeding women report that 
despite a belief that maternal 
tobacco smoking is harmful to 
infants, difficulties curbing addictive 
behaviors interfere with its 
cessation.25
Studies in which alcohol consumption 
or tobacco smoking during lactation 
are assessed are limited, and 
conductors of rat studies generally 
expose dams to larger alcohol 
quantities than consumed by human 
mothers. Despite this, available 
research suggests that alcohol 
exposure through breastmilk may have 
negative cognitive consequences for 
offspring. Research of dams intoxicated 
while pregnant and lactating found 
reduced learning in pups.26 This may 
be because of prenatal exposure alone, 
however, because Gray et al27 found 
no decline when alcohol was only 
given during lactation. Likewise, dam 
offspring who consumed alcohol while 
pregnant and nursing had reduced 
hippocampal neurons, 
28 cerebellar 
neurons, 
29 and increased cerebral 
cortex cell apoptosis and necrosis.30 
Similar neuronal loss and decreased 
myelination in pup cerebellums 
was also found after only lactational 
exposure.31
Human research has largely been 
focused on disrupted infant sleeping 
and feeding patterns.5, 
 
32 The authors 
of a case study from 1978, 
33 however, 
described an infant who developed a 
pseudo-Cushing syndrome after high 
maternal alcohol consumption during 
lactation but not pregnancy. Symptoms 
abated after alcohol cessation. 
Whereas Little et al34, 
35 found reduced 
psychomotor scores at 1 year in infants 
whose mothers drank alcohol while 
breastfeeding, the authors of more 
recent studies found no reduction in 
developmental scores.16
Rat studies of nicotine intake during 
lactation have revealed reversible 
hypothyroidism in offspring.36, 
 
37  
Although hypothyroidism is 
associated with cognitive deficits in 
humans, 
38 Gaworski et al39 found 
that pups exposed to nicotine during 
pregnancy and lactation had intact 
learning and memory.39 In a study 
of dams exposed to nicotine during 
pregnancy and lactation, offspring 
had delayed muscarinic receptor 
development.40 Because decreased 
acetylcholine transmission is 
associated with cognitive decline, 
41  
this could potentially impact 
cognitive development.
Human studies in which relationships 
between tobacco smoking during 
lactation and childhood developmental 
outcomes are assessed are scant.42, 
 
43 
Women who smoke may have infants 
of lower birth weight44 and wean 
infants earlier.45 Because low birth 
weight46 and shorter breastfeeding 
duration47 are associated with 
decreased cognition, these factors 
alone could reduce infant cognition. 
Laurberg et al48 found that smoking 
tobacco while lactating caused dose-
dependent reductions in milk iodine 
content and increased children’s risk 
of iodine deficiency. Although iodine 
deficiency could theoretically result in 
cognitive impairment, 
49 this was not 
examined.48
In the context of available research, 
our aim in the current study was to 
assess whether drinking alcohol or 
smoking tobacco during lactation 
adversely impacts cognitive outcomes 
in children. It was hypothesized that 
alcohol and nicotine use would result 
in lower cognitive scores in a dose-
dependent manner independent of 
pregnancy use.

 Study Design and Data Source
Data were sourced from Growing 
Up in Australia: The Longitudinal 
Study of Australian Children (LSAC). 
Detailed information regarding 
LSAC can be found on the LSAC Web 
site.50 Briefly, LSAC is a longitudinal 
study of Australian children and 
their families, conducted by the 
Australian Government Department 
of Social Services, the Australian 
Institute of Family Studies, and the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics. The 
researchers aim to examine impacts 
of social and cultural variables on a 
range of physical and psychological 
health and developmental 
outcomes.51
Study Cohort
Two cohorts (B and K) were 
recruited into LSAC at wave 1 in 
2004. Cohort K was not included in 
current analyses because the children 
were 4 to 5 years old at recruitment. 
Cohort B comprised 5107 infants and 
caregivers who were managed over 
time every 2 years. Demographic, 
lifestyle, cognitive, academic, and 
developmental variables were 
collected at each of the 6 waves 
available for data analyses52, 
 
53; 
further recruitment details are 
available in LSAC Technical Paper  
No. 1.54
Breastfeeding
Caregivers were asked whether 
infants were being breastfed 
at wave 1 and whether they 
had ever been breastfed.55 This 
allowed stratification into wave 1 
breastfeeding infants and infants who 
had been breastfed at any time.
Predictor Variables
Mothers were asked a modified 
version of the Alcohol Use 
Disorders Identification Test 
Alcohol Con 
sumption Questions 
(AUDIT-C)56, 
 
57  
at wave 1 (Table 1). Respondents 
who answered “never” to question 
1 were assigned a score of 0 for 
question 2. Scores were summed to 
create a total score (range: 1–19). 
Higher scores indicated increased 
or riskier alcohol consumption. 
Pregnancy alcohol was recorded 
retrospectively (Table 1). The 
average number of days pregnant 
mothers drank alcohol per week 
was calculated by averaging 
trimester results. Mothers were 
asked how many cigarettes they 
smoked on average per day at wave 
1 and how many cigarettes they 
smoked on average per day during 
pregnancy.55
Outcome Variables
Outcome variables were as follows:
 
• Transformed scores from 
an adapted Peabody Picture 
Vocabulary Test–Third Edition 
(PPVT-III)58, 
 
59 (waves 3, 4 and 5). 
Higher scores indicated increased 
vocabulary.
 
• Raw scores from the Matrix 
Reasoning (MR) subtest of the 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for 
Children-Fourth Edition60 (waves 
4, 5 and 6). Higher scores indicated 
increased nonverbal reasoning.
 
• Raw scores from the Who Am I? 
test (WAI), 
59, 
 
61, 
 
62 with 1 change to 
item 1163 (wave 3). Higher scores 
indicated increases in cognitive 
processes underlying early literacy 
and numeracy.
Control Variables
Infant sex was controlled for 
because of postulated sex 
differences in cognitive abilities.64 
Infant and maternal age were 
included because maternal age 
is associated with alcohol and 
cigarette use during lactation, 
11, 
 
19  
and cognition varies with age.65 
Because women who smoke 
tend to have lower birth weight 
infants44 and lower birth weight is 
associated with poorer cognition, 
 
46 birth weight was also included 
as a control variable. Breastfeeding 
duration was controlled for because 
earlier weaning is associated with 
lowered cognition47 as well as 
maternal tobacco smoking.45
Combined household income and 
maternal education were included 
because both are associated with 
tobacco smoking and alcohol 
consumption during lactation11, 
 
19  
as well as cognitive outcomes.66 
Learning difficulties (delay relative 
to peers in the context of a medical 
condition) and brain injuries 
(concussion and/or internal head 
injury requiring medical attention) 
were included as control variables 
because both can alter cognitive 
profiles.67, 
68 The primary language 
spoken at home was only included 
for the adapted PPVT-III and WAI 
analyses because both are language 
reliant.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed by using 
IBM SPSS version 24 (IBM SPSS 
Statistics, IBM Corporation). 
Missing data from all included 
variables were imputed by using 
multiple imputation (MI). To 
reduce estimate bias, arithmetically 
derived variables were calculated 
after MI of individual items.69 
Thirty imputations were used 
because the highest proportion of 
missing data for any variable was 
30% (Supplemental Information). 
When missing data are ˂50%, 
matching the imputation number to 
missing data percentage increases 
efficiency and replicability of data.70 
Imputations were constrained to 
variable ranges where applicable 
and were not rounded to integers 
to reduce estimate bias.71 Skewed 
independent variables were not 
transformed before MI because this 
can produce poorer estimates.72
Multivariable linear regression 
analyses were performed including 
each of the predictor and control 
variables. Multicollinearity was 
assessed by using the variance 
inflation factor (VIF). A VIF ˂10 was

 considered acceptable.73 Analyses 
were conducted separately for each 
outcome variable at each wave. 
Only data from biological mothers 
were included. Infants still being 
breastfed at wave 1 and infants 
who had been breastfed at any 
time were analyzed separately. 
The Benjamini and Hochberg74 
procedure was used to correct 
for type I error (α = .05). This 
procedure is superior to the 
Bonferroni correction in preserving 
power.74
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Full descriptive statistics of all 
variables before MI are shown in 
 
Tables 1 and 2.
Power Analyses
Sixteen female caregivers who 
were not biological mothers were 
excluded after MI. This left 2009 
breastfed infants and 4679 infants 
who had been breastfed at some 
time. Power analyses revealed that 
with 2009 subjects, 99.57% (14 
independent variables) and 99.49% 
(15 independent variables) power 
was achieved to detect a small 
effect size (Cohen's d = 0.2, α = .05). 
A sample size of 4679 provided 
˃99% power to detect an effect  
size of Cohen's d = 0.2 (α = .05), 
with 14 or 15 independent 
variables.75, 
 
76
Wave 1 Maternal Alcohol 
Consumption (Before MI)
Modified AUDIT-C scores of wave 1 
breastfeeding mothers (mean = 5.55; 
SD = 2.46; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 5.42 to 5.68) were lower than 
scores for mothers who were not 
breastfeeding (mean = 6.13; SD = 
2.72; 95% CI: 6.02 to 6.24; P ˂ .001; 
Cohen's d = 0.22). There was no 
statistically significant difference in 
modified AUDIT-C scores between

Time
Models explained 2% to 16%, 3% 
to 25%, and 2% to 14% of variance, 
respectively, across waves for each 
imputation. Increased MR wave 4 
scores were predicted by increased 
wave 4 child age. Increased or riskier 
maternal alcohol consumption was 
associated with decreased wave 4 MR 
scores. This relationship remained 
statistically significant after multiple 
comparison adjustments. At wave 
5, only older wave 5 child age was 
associated with increased wave 5  
MR scores. At wave 6, learning 
difficulties predicted lower wave 6 
MR scores. Full results are shown in

Infants Who Had Never Been Breastfed
When assessing infants who had 
never breastfed, only modified 
AUDIT-C scores were included as a 
predictor to maximize power. With 1

size of 412 provided 80% power to 
detect a small effect size (Cohen's 
d = 0.2; α = .05).75,

variance across imputations. Older 
wave 3 child age was associated 
with increased WAI scores. Learning 
difficulties were also associated with 
decreased WAI scores. There was no 
associated between maternal alcohol 
consumption or tobacco smoking and 
WAI scores.
Infants Who Had Been Breastfed at Any 
Time
The model explained 9% to 41% of 
variance across imputations. Older 
wave 3 child age predicted higher 
WAI scores. Learning difficulties 
predicted lower WAI scores. No 
other variables were statistically 
significant.

Models explained 3% to 13%, 2% 
to 14%, and 2% to 18% of variance, 
respectively, across waves for each

were associated with lower wave 
3–adapted PPVT-III scores. Older

higher wave 4 scores. Other variables 
were not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study in which 
associations between alcohol 
exposure through breastmilk and 
cognition in children are examined. 
Greater or riskier maternal 
alcohol intake was associated with 
decreased nonverbal reasoning at 
6 to 7 years in a dose-dependent 
manner. This was independent of 
prenatal alcohol consumption, sex, 
child and maternal age, income, 
birth weight, breastfeeding  
duration, learning delay, head injury, 
and pregnancy and breastfeeding 
tobacco smoking. Although this 
relationship was found in wave 
1 breastfeeding children, with 
multiple comparison adjustment 
it was no longer statistically 
significant. In children who had been 
breastfed at any time, however, this

 association remained statistically 
significant after adjustment.
There was no relationship between 
maternal alcohol consumption and 
MR scores in infants who had never 
breastfed. This suggests that alcohol 
exposure through breastmilk was 
responsible for cognitive reductions 
in breastfed infants rather than 
psychosocial or environmental 
factors surrounding maternal alcohol 
consumption. This supports the 
suggestion that alcohol exposure 
through breastmilk can reduce 
cognition in children.
No relationship between maternal 
tobacco smoking and MR scores 
was found in wave 1 breastfed 
infants or infants who had been 
breastfed at any time at any wave. 
Likewise, no associations were 
observed between maternal alcohol 
or cigarette use and adapted PPVT-
III or WAI scores for either group 
at any wave. The suggestion that 
smoking tobacco during lactation 
reduces cognition in children was 
not supported.
Although no directly comparable 
previous research exists, Little et al34  
found reduced developmental 
scores in children of mothers who 
drank while breastfeeding. The 
authors of a case study of a breastfed 
infant who developed a pseudo-
Cushing syndrome also found that 
symptoms abated once maternal 
alcohol was ceased. Because the 
infant had no prenatal alcohol 
exposure, this suggests that alcohol 
exposure through breastmilk 
can directly impact children’s 
development.33 Additionally, 
prenatal alcohol exposure is more 
consistently associated with 
executive dysfunction than language 
or numeracy impairments.4 This 
is consistent with the observed 
reductions in MR scores but not 
the language- or numeracy-based 
measures.
Although current analyses found an 
association between increased or 
riskier alcohol consumption while 
breastfeeding and MR scores, the 
mechanism is unclear. Consistent 
with animal models, ethanol in 
breastmilk may interfere with 
normal brain development.28 
– 
31 
Increased cerebral cortex apoptosis 
and necrosis, 
30 for example, may 
disrupt higher order executive 
skills relied on in reasoning tasks. 
Likewise, decreased myelination31 
could reduce the processing speed 
needed to problem solve quickly. 
Alternatively, reduced cognition may 
be secondary to changes in feeding 
and sleeping.5, 
 
32 Alterations in 
nutritional intake and sleep patterns 
may modify brain development 
or cause behavioral changes that 
reduce exposure to enriching 
stimuli.
The relationship between increased 
alcohol exposure through breastmilk 
and decreased cognition was not 
evident at waves 5 to 6. Because 
older age also ceased to be predictive 
of wave 6 MR scores, the effects of 
age and alcohol may be mediated by 
factors such as increased education. 
Because learning difficulties were 
associated with lower wave 6 MR 
scores, alcohol may also indirectly 
alter cognition by contributing to 
developmental disorders in older 
children.
Interestingly, despite known 
teratogenic effects, 
1, 
 
3 no association 
between prenatal alcohol exposure 
and children’s cognition was 
observed. This may be related 
to the small quantities and 
infrequency of prenatal alcohol 
consumption. Furthermore, 
prenatal binge drinking of 
alcohol was not recorded and has 
been associated with reduced 
cognition in children.2 The size 
of the observed relationship 
between alcohol exposure through 
breastmilk and cognition was also 
small, and clinical implications 
may be limited unless mothers 
drink large quantities or frequently 
binge drink. Additionally, given 
this small effect, the sample size of 
infants who had never breastfed 
may have been too small to detect 
a relationship, despite attempts to 
maximize power.
There are several other limitations. 
The frequency and quantity of 
milk consumed by infants was not 
recorded, nor was the timing of 
alcohol consumption or the amount 
of ethanol in breastmilk. The impact 
of this is unknown, however, 
because not all women time their 
alcohol consumption to limit alcohol 
exposure, and unpredictable infant 
feeding patterns can interfere with 
timing attempts.20
Although wave 1 alcohol 
consumption was recorded 
contemporaneously, pregnancy 
alcohol measures were 
retrospective. Although both are 
likely to be underestimates, 
18 
retrospective measures may be 
even less accurate. Furthermore, 
measures of wave 1 and pregnancy 
alcohol differed, preventing direct 
comparisons.
Cognitive measures available 
from LSAC were limited. A more 
comprehensive assessment of 
cognition including executive 
functioning, processing speed, 
learning and memory, visuospatial 
abilities, and basic as well as 
complex attention would have been 
beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS
Increased or riskier maternal 
alcohol consumption during 
lactation was associated with dose-
dependent reductions in abstract 
reasoning at age 6 to 7 years. This 
relationship was not observed in 
infants who had never breastfed, 
suggesting a direct relationship 
between alcohol exposure through

 breastmilk and decreased cognition. 
The association was not evident at 
ages 8 to 11 years, which may relate 
to increased education in older 
children. Alternatively, because 
learning difficulties predicted 
lower MR scores at ages 10 to 11 
years, alcohol may be associated 
with developmental disorders that 
contribute to these difficulties. 
Further analyses of LSAC data are 
planned to assess this possibility 
as well as relationships between 
alcohol exposure through breastmilk 
and academic, physical, and 
behavioral outcomes in children. 
Future research should also be 
focused on direct measures of 
alcohol in breastmilk and use 
more comprehensive cognitive 
assessments.
