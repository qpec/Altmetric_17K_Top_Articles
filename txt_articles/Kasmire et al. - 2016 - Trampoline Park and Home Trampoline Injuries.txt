Trampoline Park and Home 
Trampoline Injuries

abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trampoline parks, indoor recreational facilities with wall-to-wall 
trampolines, are increasing in number and popularity. The objective was to identify trends 
in emergency department visits for trampoline park injuries (TPIs) and compare TPI 
characteristics with home trampoline injuries (HTIs).
METHODS: Data on trampoline injuries from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance 
System from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed. Sample weights were applied to estimate yearly 
national injury trends; unweighted cases were used for comparison of injury patterns.
RESULTS: Estimated US emergency department visits for TPI increased significantly, from 581 
in 2010 to 6932 in 2014 (P = .045), whereas HTIs did not increase (P = .13). Patients with TPI 
(n = 330) were older than patients with HTI (n = 7933) (mean 13.3 vs 9.5 years, respectively, 
P < .001) and predominantly male. Sprains and fractures were the most common injuries 
at trampoline parks and homes. Compared with HTIs, TPIs were less likely to involve head 
injury (odds ratio [OR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.89), more likely to involve 
lower extremity injury (OR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.91–2.98), more likely to be a dislocation (OR 
2.12; 95% CI, 1.10–4.09), and more likely to warrant admission (OR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.19–2.61). 
TPIs necessitating hospital admission included open fractures and spinal cord injuries. TPI 
mechanisms included falls, contact with other jumpers, and flips.
CONCLUSIONS: TPI patterns differed significantly from HTIs. TPIs are an emerging concern; 
additional investigation and strategies are needed to prevent injury at trampoline parks.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Trampoline use 
carries signifi
 cant risk of injury to children. Most 
trampoline injuries occur on home trampolines. 
Multiple studies describe injury types and 
mechanisms on home trampolines; little is known 
about trampoline park injuries (TPIs).
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: TPIs increased signifi
 cantly 
from 2010 to 2014. TPIs often involved lower 
extremity sprains and fractures. Serious injuries 
included open fractures and spinal cord injuries. 
TPIs had higher odds of hospital admission than 
home trampoline injuries.

Trampoline use poses significant risk 
of injury to children.

– 
11 Estimates 
from the National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System (NEISS) show 
that trampoline injuries result 
in nearly 100 000 emergency 
department (ED) visits a year. 
11 
Trampoline injuries can occur from 
falls on the trampoline mat, falls 
off a trampoline, impact with the 
trampoline frame or springs, and 
collisions of multiple trampoline 
users.

including cervical spine and skull 
fractures have been reported.

Because of the risks associated 
with trampoline use, trampoline 
use by children is discouraged, but 
its popularity persists.

14 The 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
policy statement on trampoline safety 
recommends against recreational 
trampoline use by children and 
recommends that if trampolines are 
used, safety measures should include 
constant adult supervision, adequate 
protective padding, 1 jumper per 
trampoline, and avoidance of flips 
and somersaults. 
1
Indoor trampoline parks typically 
consist of wall-to-wall connected 
trampolines with padded walls or 
angled trampoline walls. Over the 
past several years, indoor trampoline 
parks have increased in number 
and popularity. 
18, 
 
19 Despite the 
risk of injury with trampoline use, 
trampoline parks are popular for 
children and families. According 
to the International Association of 
Trampoline Parks, in 2011 there 
were only 35 to 40 trampoline 
parks in existence, compared with 
280 in 2014. 
18 Trampoline parks 
continue to spring up at a rate of 5 
or 6 a month, with expectations of 
~450 trampoline parks in the United 
States by the end of 2015. 
18, 
19 Safety 
guidelines vary from park to park; 
some include safety guidelines such 
as discouraging flips and somersaults 
or limiting the number of jumpers 
per trampoline, whereas others allow 
flips. 
20 
– 
22 The design may include 
appropriate padding and setups 
that prevent falling off trampolines, 
such as placement of trampolines 
at ground level and surrounding 
trampolines with padding or 
trampoline walls. However, there are 
often multiple jumpers, a practice 
associated with increased risk for 
injury on trampolines.

To our knowledge, there have been 
no published studies focusing on 
injuries at trampoline parks. This 
study investigates national trends in 
trampoline park injuries (TPIs) and 
compares demographic features and 
injury characteristics between TPIs 
and home trampoline injuries (HTIs). 
These data will aid in promoting safe 
use and developing future policy 
guidelines.
METHODS
A retrospective study of TPIs and 
HTIs from the NEISS database from 
January 1, 2010 to December 31, 
2014 was performed. This start 
date was chosen because only 1 TPI 
was reported to NEISS before 2010. 
The study was approved by our 
institutional review board.
Data Source
The NEISS database of the 
US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission provides data on 
consumer product–related injuries 
treated in US EDs by using a stratified 
probability sample of EDs from 
across the country with 24-hour 
emergency service and at least 
≥6 beds. 
25 At the 100 hospitals 
that make up this statistically 
representative sample of US EDs, 
injury-related ED visits are entered 
in the database daily with injury 
information including age, gender, 
race, injury type, body part injured, 
disposition from the ED, location 
where the injury occurred, and a 
brief narrative description of the 
injury event for each case. Cases 
in the database are given a weight 
based on the inverse probability of 
selection, which can be applied to 
estimate national injury frequency.
Study Design
Product code 1233 for trampoline 
was used to identify trampoline-
related injuries from 2010 to 2014 in 
the NEISS database. Injury location 
is coded in 9 categories: home, farm 
or ranch, street or highway, 
other public property, mobile 
home, industrial place, school, place 
of recreation or sports (hereby 
referred to as recreational facilities), 
and unknown location. The study 
control group consisted of injuries 
occurring at home (sustained at a 
home or in a yard). All cases with 
location “home” were included in 
the control group (n = 7933). We 
identified TPI cases (n = 330) by 
searching narrative comments of 
cases with a location of “recreational 
facility” (which also includes bowling 
alleys, parks, amusement parks, 
sports fields, and other facilities) or 
other public property. Cases were 
included if the narrative included 
“trampoline park, 
” “trampoline 
place, 
” “trampoline playground, 
” 
“trampoline center, 
” “trampoline gym, 
” 
“indoor trampoline party, 
” playing 
dodgeball on a trampoline, the name 
of a trampoline park, or a redacted 
facility name that was confirmed by 
the NEISS to be a trampoline park. 
Cases documented as occurring 
at a “park” or “gym” rather than 
“trampoline park” or “trampoline 
gym” were excluded. Other exclusion 
criteria included gymnastics or 
competitive trampoline injuries 
and cases occurring at a facility that 
does not typically have wall-to-wall 
trampolines (eg, YMCA). A second 
reviewer reviewed TPI cases for 
inclusion and agreed with assignment 
in all cases.
Sample weights were applied to cases 
to estimate national number of TPIs 
and show trends in injuries over 
time. Unweighted cases were used to 
compare features of TPIs and HTIs

because of the small number of TPI 
cases.
Variables
TPIs and HTIs were compared by 
demographics, injury type, body part 
injured, and disposition. Several injury 
types were grouped together for 
analysis into the following categories: 
concussion (concussion, internal 
organ injury to head, headache), 
contusion or abrasion (contusion or 
abrasion, hematoma, crush injury), 
fracture (fracture, nerve damage 
with fracture), laceration (laceration, 
puncture wound, skin avulsion), 
pain (pain or injury to a certain body 
part without other specified injury), 
sprain (sprain or strain), and other 
(all remaining injuries not previously 
specified). Body parts were grouped 
in the following categories: head 
(head, eyeball, face, mouth, ear), 
upper extremity (shoulder or clavicle, 
arm, elbow, hand, wrist, finger), 
lower extremity (ankle, toe, foot, leg, 
knee, hip), neck, chest or trunk, and 
other (internal injury or affecting 
whole body). Mechanism of injury 
was determined from narrative 
comments for TPI cases. Injury type, 
body part injured, and disposition 
were analyzed by age group, with 
pediatric patients divided by age 
<6 years and 6 to 17 years, because 
previous studies have shown higher 
risk for certain types of trampoline 
injuries in children <6 years of age. 
13 
Comparison of TPI and HTI features 
(injury type, body part injured, and 
disposition) was also conducted with 
adult patients excluded; significant 
findings did not differ, with the 
exception of a lack of significance in 
the rate of concussions (P = .087) and 
ED discharges (P = .075).
Statistical Analysis
SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics, 
IBM Corporation) was used for 
statistical analyses. We compared 
estimated TPIs for yearly variation 
by using linear regression. 
Demographics, injury features, and 
hospital admission were compared 
via t tests, χ2, or 2-proportion z tests, 
and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical 
significance was set at α = 0.05 for all 
analyses.
RESULTS
ED Visit Trends
Estimated yearly US ED visits for 
trampoline injuries did not vary 
significantly during the study period 
(P = .44), with an average of 91 750 
injuries per year from 2010 to 2014 
( 
Fig 1). The majority of these injuries 
occurred at homes; the yearly 
number of HTIs did not significantly 
vary (P = .13). TPIs increased 
significantly during the study period 
(P = .045), with 6932 TPIs in 2014, 
accounting for 11% of all trampoline 
injuries that year (among injuries 
where the location was known). 
Since 2011, trampoline parks have 
been the most common location 
of recreational facility trampoline 
injuries ( 
Fig 2).

are summarized in  
Table 1. Patients 
with TPI were older than patients 
with HTI, with a mean age of 13.3 
years (median 12.0 years, range 
19 months–44 years) versus 9.5 
years (median age 8.0 years, range 4 
months–76 years) for HTI (P < .001). 
For both TPIs and HTIs, a higher 
percentage of patients were male 
(58.8% and 53.5%, respectively).
Sprains and fractures were the 
most commonly reported injury 
types at trampoline parks and 
homes ( 
Fig 3). Patients injured at 
trampoline parks were more likely 
to have sprains (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 
1.28–2.02) and dislocations (OR 
2.12; 95% CI, 1.10–4.09). Patients 
with TPI were less likely to have 
concussions (OR 0.49; 95% CI, 
0.26–0.93), lacerations (OR 0.45; 
95% CI, 0.27–0.75), and contusions 
or abrasions (OR 0.59; 95% CI, 
0.41–0.85).
The distributions of body parts 
injured in TPIs and HTIs are 
depicted in  
Fig 4. Compared with 
HTIs, TPIs were less likely to 
involve head injury (OR 0.64; 95% 
CI, 0.46–0.89) and upper extremity 
injury (OR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29–0.54) 
and more likely to involve lower 
extremity injury (OR 2.39; 95% 
CI, 1.91–2.98). The most common 
injury types of each body part at 
trampoline parks were as follows: 
chest or trunk: sprains (57%) and 
contusion or abrasions (23%), head: 
lacerations (39%) and concussions 
(24%), lower extremity: sprains 
(46%) and fractures (35%), neck: 
sprains (71%) and fractures (21%), 
and upper extremity: fractures (64%) 
and sprains (21%). Among head 
injuries, facial bone fractures were 
also common (10%).
Injury types at trampoline parks 
showed several differences by 
age. At trampoline parks, fractures 
were significantly more common in 
younger children than in adolescents 
and adults, accounting for 47.8% 
of injuries in children <6 years old, 
33.5% in children 6 to 17 years, and 
17.5% in adults (P = .003). Children 
<6 years old were less likely to 
sustain sprains (19.6% of injuries) 
compared with children ages 6 to 17 
years old (38.0%) and adults (52.4%) 
(P = .002). Lower extremities 
remained the most common body 
part injured at trampoline parks in 
all age groups. The only significant 
difference in body part injured by 
age was an increase in neck injuries 
with increasing age, with neck 
injuries representing 0% of injuries 
in patients <6 years old, 3.6% in ages 
6 to 17 years, and 9.5% in adults 
(P = .037).

ED Disposition
Patients injured at trampoline parks 
were more often admitted than 
patients with HTIs (OR 1.76; 95% 
CI, 1.19–2.61) ( 
Table 1). Disposition, 
including admission, for patients 
with TPI did not vary significantly 
across age groups (P = .78). The 
most common injuries in admitted 
patients were lower leg fractures for 
TPIs (59% of admissions), compared 
with elbow fractures (34%) and 
forearm fractures (18%) for HTIs. 
TPIs resulting in hospital admission 
included open leg fractures (n = 4), 
a skull fracture (n = 1), and cervical 
spine fractures with spinal cord 
injury (n = 2). Both patients with 
spinal cord injuries (ages 17 and 
20 years old) sustained the injury 
performing a flip, with 1 landing 
on his head on a bar and the other 
jumping into a foam pit. There were 
no definite spinal cord injuries 
recorded among the 7933 HTI cases; 
there was 1 case of “possible nerve 
damage” from an upper back injury 
and 6 cases of cervical spine fracture 
without mention of spinal cord injury 
from home trampolines.
TPI Mechanisms
Injury mechanisms at trampoline 
parks are described in  
Table 2. 
Injuries most often occurred on 
landing (33% of injuries), including 
twisting of the ankle or knee or 
landing on other body parts. A 
number of injuries at trampoline 
parks involved another jumper 
(8%), including a collision with or 
a fall onto another child, or another 
jumper caused a child to be launched 
into the air or to fall. Several severe 
injuries resulted from contact with 
the trampoline frame, the springs, or 
the ground. Multiple injuries were 
associated with performing flips 
(8%), including both cases of cervical 
spine fracture.
DISCUSSION
Our study confirmed that 
injuries at trampoline parks are 
increasing as trampoline parks 
grow in popularity ( 
Figs 1 and 
 
2). 
19 Injuries at trampoline parks 
increased substantially, whereas 
total trampoline injuries in the 
United States remained stable 
( 
Fig 1). Although only a fraction of 
trampoline-related injuries occurred 
at trampoline parks (11% in 2014), 
the trend in TPIs is alarming;

particularly concerning was the 
occurrence of severe and debilitating 
injuries such as spinal cord injuries. 
In addition to the 2 cases of spinal 
cord injuries at trampoline parks 
in the NEISS sample, multiple cases 
of spinal cord injuries have been 
reported in the media, 
26 
 
 
– 
30 as well 
as a traumatic brain injury31 and 
2 deaths at trampoline parks. 
32, 
 
33 
Trampoline parks face significant 
liability challenges, with a lawsuit 
resulting in an $11.5-million 
award, 
 
31 multiple pending 
lawsuits, 
 
29, 
30 and several settled 
suits that led to the closure of 1 
trampoline park. 
34
TPIs and HTIs shared a number of 
common features but showed notable 
differences in several characteristics. 
Both TPIs and HTIs showed a male 
predominance, which is a common 
finding for other pediatric injuries 
as well. 
35, 
 
36 Injuries from both 
trampoline parks and homes often 
involved sprains and fractures. 
Young children (<6 years) more often 
sustained fractures, as previously 
reported. 
2, 
 
7, 
13 Fractures in young 
children include proximal tibia 
fractures from jumping with older 
children, 
 
37, 
 
38 although the frequency 
of this fracture type at trampoline 
parks could not be determined 
from these data. TPIs resulted in a 
higher prevalence of lower extremity 
injuries and fewer upper extremity 
and head injuries when compared 
with HTIs.
Upper extremity and head injuries 
often result from falls off a 
trampoline. 
4, 
 
5, 
 
10, 
 
39 Probably because 
of the wall-to-wall trampoline 
design, there were few falls from 
trampolines at trampoline parks 
(Table 2), which may account for the 
decreased proportion of head and 
arm injuries at trampoline parks. 
Lower extremity injuries were 
common at trampoline parks, and a 
number of serious lower extremity 
injuries were reported, including 
open fractures, dislocations, and 
other leg fractures necessitating 
hospital admission. It is unclear 
from our study whether there is a 
higher inherent risk for leg injury 
at trampoline parks or whether this 
discrepancy results from a larger 
proportion of lower extremity 
injuries due to relative lack of upper 
extremity injuries. It is plausible 
that trampoline parks pose a high 
risk for leg injuries because of the 
high heights or velocities attained in 
jumping and the resulting increase 
in stress on the lower extremities. 
Landing on trampoline park 
trampoline frames also contributed 
to the frequency and severity of 
leg injuries ( 
Table 2). Additional 
investigation is warranted to find 
ways to minimize leg injuries at 
trampoline parks, which could 
include improvements in frame 
padding or design.
Injury mechanisms at trampoline 
parks included similar mechanisms 
to those previously reported on 
home trampolines: landing wrong, 
contact with other jumpers, flips, 
falling off trampolines, and landing 
on the frame or springs. 
3, 
 
6, 
 
12, 
 
13 Falling 
off was a less common mechanism 
at trampoline parks (4%) than has 
been reported on home trampolines 
(27%–39%).3, 
 
6, 
 
12 In addition to 
common injury mechanisms, TPI 
mechanisms included novel injury 
mechanisms such as trampoline-
based sports including trampoline 
dodgeball and volleyball.
Several severe injuries at 
trampoline parks resulted from 
contact with trampoline frames, 
springs, or surrounding structures 
such as poles. The most common 
injury from contact with support 
structures was fracture (36%), 
of which 3 out of 8 were open 
fractures. Although padding over 
trampoline frames and springs 
is recommended, the addition 
of padding has not necessarily 
reduced injuries on home 
trampolines, 
 
12 and our study 
suggests there is also room for 
improvements in trampoline park 
design. One trampoline design that 
has been shown to reduce injury 
is a “soft-edge trampoline” design 
that has no springs on the jumping 
surface and includes a netted 
enclosure without rigid supports. 
40
Falls off trampolines have been 
associated with increased severity 
of injuries, such as fractures 
necessitating surgery, and higher 
admission rates.

the low occurrence of falls off of 
trampolines as the injury mechanism 
at trampoline parks (4% of TPIs), our 
study found higher admission rate 
for TPIs, suggesting other reasons 
for more severe injuries. Flips 
have been recognized as carrying 
high risk, including risk of spinal 
cord injury.3, 
 
16, 
 
17 Our data support 
this finding, with 2 cases of spinal 
cord injuries occurring from flips. 
Given the potential severity of neck 
injuries, flips should be avoided at 
trampoline parks, in accordance with 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
policy statement on trampoline 
safety.

Adult supervision has been proposed 
to reduce trampoline injuries in 
children, although trampoline 
injuries often occur despite adult 
supervision.

14 Most trampoline 
parks have constant supervision 
of jumpers by park personnel 
20, 
21; 
whether a supervisor was present 
could not be determined from our 
data. The supervised environment 
may promote a sense of complacency 
and underestimation of risk at 
trampoline parks. However, dutiful 
supervision could be helpful to 
enforce trampoline park rules such 
as allowing only a single jumper 
per trampoline, because injuries 
resulting from multiple jumpers are 
problematic ( 
Table 2).

parks have a separate designated 
area for young children, which could 
increase safety for younger jumpers

This study does have limitations. 
The NEISS has incomplete data 
including injury locations and 
mechanisms. Because the type of 
recreational facility was not known 
in a number of cases, our study 
probably underestimates the 
number of trampoline park 
injuries. Although the NEISS is a 
representative sample of ED visits, it 
does not include injuries for which 
care was not sought in an ED, which 
could exclude less severe injuries. 
Additionally, without knowing 
the frequency of trampoline park 
attendance, we could not determine 
the risk of injury during a trip to a 
trampoline park or compare the 
risks of trampoline park use with 
home trampoline use.
CONCLUSIONS
Trampoline use carries significant 
risk of injury to children, and 
trampoline parks are no exception. 
ED visits for TPIs are increasing 
substantially. Trampoline park 
use can result in severe injuries 
through varied mechanisms, 
with TPIs often involving lower 
extremity sprains and fractures and 
rarely open fractures and spinal 
cord injuries. Patients with TPI 
were more likely to need hospital 
admission than those with HTIs. 
Prevention strategies should focus 
on common injuries such as lower 
extremity sprains and fractures, as 
well as strategies to prevent serious 
injuries. As is recommended for 
home trampolines, flips should be 
restricted and contact between 
jumpers should be minimized. 
Furthermore, improved padding to 
provide protection from landing on 
trampoline frames may help prevent 
some injuries. Understanding 
features and mechanisms of 
TPIs is essential in forming 
injury prevention strategies for 
recreational trampoline use.
