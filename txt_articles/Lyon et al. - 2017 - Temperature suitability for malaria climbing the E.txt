Abstract
While the effect of climate change on the prevalence of malaria in the highlands of Eastern Africa
has been the topic of protracted debate, temperature is widely accepted as a fundamentally
important environmental factor constraining its transmission. Air temperatures below
approximately 18 °C and 15 °C, respectively, prohibit the development of the Plasmodium
falciparum and P. vivax parasites responsible for the majority of malaria cases in Ethiopia. Low
temperatures also impede the development rates of the Anopheles mosquito vectors. While
locations of sufficiently high elevation have temperatures below these transmission thresholds, a
fundamental question is how such temperature ‘threshold elevations’ are changing with time.
A lack of high quality, high spatial resolution climate data has previously prohibited a rigorous
investigation. Using a newly developed national temperature dataset for Ethiopia that combines
numerous in-situ surface observations with downscaled reanalysis data, we here identify
statistically significant increases in elevation for both the 18 °C and 15 °C thresholds in highland
areas between 1981–2014. Substantial interannual and spatial variations in threshold elevations
are identified, the former associated with the El Niño Southern-Oscillation and the latter with the
complex climate of the region. The estimated population in locations with an upward trend in
the 15 °C threshold elevation is approximately 6.5 million people (2.2 million for 18 °C). While
not a direct prediction of the additional population made vulnerable to malaria through a shift to
higher temperature, our results underscore a newly acquired ability to investigate climate
variability and trends at fine spatial scales across Ethiopia, including changes in a fundamental
constraint on malaria transmission in the Ethiopian Highlands.
Introduction
Malaria is a climate sensitive disease. While the biology
of malaria transmission is intricately linked to
environmental conditions and is quite complex
(McKenzie 2000), a major constraint is minimum
air temperature (Gething et al 2011). Sufficiently low
temperatures impede the development rates of both
the parasites that cause malaria and the Anopheles
mosquito vectors that carry them (Patz and Olson
2006, Pascual et al 2006), with mosquito populations
consequently lower in highland versus lowland areas
(Minakawa et al 2002, Bodker et al 2003). In the
Ethiopian highlands, the focus of this study (see
figure 1), Plasmodium falciparum is the primary cause
of malaria (Howes et al 2015) although P. vivax is also
important (World Malaria Report 2015). Minimum
temperature thresholds of 18 °C and 15 °C have been
identified for the survival of P. falicparum and P. vivax,
respectively (Craig et al 1999, Gilles 1999). Since air
temperature decreases with altitude in the tropo-
sphere, much of the Ethiopian highlands are below
these thresholds, serving as a natural barrier to malaria
transmission. As such, elevation is used as the primary

 factor in malaria control decisions made by the
Ethiopia Ministry of Health (Aregawi et al 2014).
The effect of a warming climate on malaria
transmission in highland areas of the tropics is a clear
concern (Confalonieri et al 2007), however its specific
influence on transmission dynamics, and the extent to
which such changes may already be underway, has been
the topic of a protracted debate (Hay et al 2002, Reiter
2008, Pascual et al 2008). What is not in dispute is that a
warmerclimatewillleadtoinanincreaseintheelevation
where the threshold temperature for parasite survival
occurs, eroding the current malaria barrier in the
densely populated highland areas of Ethiopia (Himei-
dan and Kweka 2012, see supplemental figure S1 stacks.
iop.org/ERL/12/064015/mmedia). Whether or
not
climate change has already contributed to a recent
upsurge in the prevalence of malaria in the East African
highlands remains controversial. From a climate
perspective, however, a fundamental issue frequently
overlooked in this debate is the lack of high quality
climate data for the highland region (Thomson et al
2011). Most publically available climate datasets for
eastern Africa consist of either a limited number of
station observations, gridded datasets based on limited
station data inputs that are highly interpolated spatially,
or land surface temperature estimates from satellite
observations that are un-calibrated and of relatively
short duration (Vancutsem et al 2010). It has been
challenging, for example, to robustly quantify tempera-
ture trends at a single location, much less across all
highland areas (Himeidan and Kweka 2012, Omumbo
et al 2011, Christy et al 2009). In Ethiopia, the climate
can exhibit substantial spatial variations on the scale of
just tens of kilometers (e.g. Hession and Moore 2011),
exacerbating the problem.
Methods
In this study a new, high quality climate dataset for
Ethiopia obtained from the Enhanced National
Climate Services (ENACTS) initiative (Dinku et al
2016) and implemented by the Ethiopian National
Meteorological Agency (NMA) is utilized to examine
changes in elevation of the minimum temperature
thresholds for P. falciparum and P. vivax in the
Ethiopian highlands. In keeping with other studies
(Aregawi et al 2014), highland areas are defined as
locations between 1500–2500 m in elevation (figure 1).
The ENACTS data used consists of dekad (10 d)
averages of daily minimum air temperature covering
the period 1981�2014 at roughly 4 km spatial
resolution obtained by merging downscaled, reanalysis
temperature data generated by the Japan Meteorologi-
cal Agency (JRA-55; Kobayashi et al 2015) with
quality-controlled station observations from over 150
stations across Ethiopia. The JRA-55 reanalysis dataset
combines (assimilates) numerous in situ and satellite
observations
with
output
from
an
operational
numerical weather prediction model to generate
gridded fields of several atmospheric variables. Here,
the surface temperature field from JRA-55 is utilized
and was first downscaled from a 50 km to 4 km spatial
resolution by using station-based atmospheric tem-
perature lapse rate information in combination with a
gridded elevation dataset (NOAA 1988). The station
observations are used to compute local bias adjust-
ments for the downscaled JRA-55 data for each dekad,
which are then spatially interpolated and applied to
generate adjusted JRA-55 temperature fields. The
station observations are then merged with the adjusted
JRA-55 data for every dekad from 1981–2014 using

 regression-kriging (Hengl et al 2007). The number of
stations used as input into the ENACTS gridding
scheme does vary slightly from year to year, but
typically by less than 15% (see supplemental figure S2).
Nonetheless, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to
examine how achanging numberofstationinputsaffect
the gridded temperature analysis in ENACTS. It was
found that even when station inputs vary by a factor of
two over the course of the analysis period (1981–2014)
the gridded maximum and minimum temperature
fieldsshowlittledifferencefromthosebasedonthesetof
stationsusedinENACTSv5(see supplemental section2
for more details).
Using the gridded ENACTS temperature data and
a digital elevation model the highest elevation where
the dekad average minimum temperature reaches
18 °C and 15 °C during the course of a calendar year
was identified across the Ethiopian highlands (see
schematic in figure 2). The elevation where these
temperature conditions are met is subsequently
referred to as the ‘threshold elevation’ for 18 °C or
15 °C and will hereafter be abbreviated as TE18 and
TE15, respectively. Collectively, the TE18 and TE15
values are thus akin to delineating a ‘high water mark’
across the highlands for the two temperature thresh-
olds in a given year. Once these elevations have been
identified, both their variations in space and changes
over time are evaluated.
The specific steps used to calculate TE18 and
TE15 are straightforward and are described here for
TE18. The first step in the calculation is to flag all grid
points in the ENACTS minimum temperature field as
1 (0) if they remain, (do not remain) below 18 °C
throughout the course of a given calendar year. Next,
for a given year, the grid point locations where
adjacent, flagged values differ by one are identified,
with the elevation of these grid points (the TE18
values) obtained from the ETOP05 dataset (NOAA
1988). There is some uncertainty in the computed
local values of TE18 owing to differences in elevation
between the adjacent grid points used to test for
differences in the flagged values described above. A
summary measure of this uncertainty across the
highlands
is
obtained
by
first
computing
the
difference in elevation between the TE18 value at a
given grid point and the elevation at adjacent grid
points and then computing the standard deviation of
these differences across all TE18 locations for a given
year. The procedure for computing TE15 is the same
as for TE18 but using the lower temperature
threshold to flag the data in the first step. Once
determined,
the
TE18
and
TE15
values
were
evaluated in three ways. First, the mean values of
TE18 and TE15 were computed across all highland
locations during a given year to generate time series
covering the period 1981–2014. An assessment of
temporal trends in these two time series was then
undertaken.
A
second
analysis
examined
local
variations in TE18 and TE15 by computing their
cumulative frequency distributions as a function of
elevation. A third assessment was to determine local
trends in TE18 and TE15 based on the Mann-
Whitney-Wilcoxon test, which is described below in
the discussion of testing for statistical significance.
To examine the relationship between interannual
variations in TE18 and TE15 and the El Niño-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a linear trend was first
removed from both time series using ordinary least
squares regression. These de-trended time series were
then regressed onto the previous year’s October–
December average sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies (Reynolds et al 2007) averaged over the
Niño 3.4 region of the east-central equatorial Pacific.
The October–December SST values were used since
ENSO events tend to be reaching their peak strength
during this season, which tends to persist into the
following calendar year. The ENSO contribution to
interannual variations in TE18 and TE15 was then
removed by multiplying the regression coefficients
obtained
above by
the
observed
Niño 3.4
SST
anomalies for a given year and then subtracting this
value from the original TE18 and TE15 time series.

(TE), which is measured in meters above mean sea level.

 The resulting ‘residual’ time series were then again
tested for temporal trends.
In addition to aggregating results across the
highlands region to form time series, spatial variations
in TE15 were also investigated to examine spatial
variations in elevation during El Niño and La Niña as
well as for all years in the study. The linearly de-
trended TE15 data was used for this purpose, with
cumulative probability (relative frequency) distribu-
tions of elevation generated for strong El Niño (1998)
and La Niña (2000) events (based on the Niño 3.4 SST
index). The 10th, 50th and 90th percentile values in
elevation were also computed across all years (1981–
2014), again based on the relative frequency of
elevation occurrence.
Statistical significance of temporal trends in TE18
and
TE15
averaged
across
the
highlands
was
computed
using
the
Mann–Kendall
test.
The
magnitude of the trend was determined by the slope
term in an ordinary least squares regression fit to the
time series data. The statistical significance of the
local (grid point) trend in the 18 °C and 15 °C
temperature thresholds was determined using the
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test. This test was applied
to binary data, which indicated at each grid point
whether or not the temperature had exceeded the
18 °C or 15 °C threshold during a given year. To assess
trends in this occurrence over time, the full binary
data time series were divided into two equal samples
(1981–1997 and 1998–2014) and then the statistical
test applied. To estimate the human population living
in locations having a statistically significant increase
in these temperature thresholds, a gridded popula-
tion density dataset (CIESIN 2016) was employed.
The total population was obtained by summing the
population across all grid points where the trends
were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Results
Time series (figure 3) showing the mean value of
threshold elevation (TE18 and TE15) averaged across
all highland locations indicates both substantial
interannual variability as well as statistically significant
(p < 0.01) upward trends. The interannual fluctua-
tions in the elevation time series are closely linked to
the status of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), with El Niño (La Niña) associated with
higher (lower) threshold elevations, as seen in their
correspondence to October–December average sea
surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Niño 3.4
region of the east-central equatorial Pacific (vertical
bars in figure 3). Using the linearly de-trended TE18
and TE15 time series, the temporal correlation with
the Niño 3.4 SST index is r ¼ 0.62 (r ¼ 0.73) for the
18 °C (15 °C) threshold, both statistically significant at
p < 0.01. This strong association with ENSO is
expected, given the warming (cooling) influence of El
Niño (La Niña) conditions on the tropical atmosphere
(Chiang and Sobel 2002).
When the influence of ENSO is removed from the
TE18 and TE15 time series in figure 3 via linear
regression, the residual time series still show statisti-
cally significant (p < 0.01) trends of similar magnitude
to those obtained for the original series. This is shown
in figure 4, where the residual TE18 and TE15 time
series are plotted along with linear trends fit to both
time series. The increase in elevation for both variables
is thus not simply a result of temporal variations in the
behavior of ENSO over the 1981–2014.
Results assessing local variations in TE15 during
the El Niño of 1998 and La Niña of 2000 are shown in
figure 5, where associated cumulative frequencies in
elevation values are plotted (in percent). The figure

 years of approximately 100 m, a clear indication of the
importance of ENSO on interannual variations in the
elevation of malaria temperature suitability. Another
interesting result seen in figure 4 is that the difference
in elevation between the 10th and 90th percentiles of
TE15 for either ENSO phase (as well as for all study
years) is approximately 900 m. This large range in
elevation is an indication of substantial spatial
variation in climate of the highlands region, likely
associated with the interaction of low-level winds and
topography, variations in cloud cover and its influence
on net surface radiation and other factors (e.g.
Lundquist and Cayan 2007).
Finally, figure 6 indicates locations having a
statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in the
18 °C and 15 °C minimum temperature thresholds,
with shading in the figure representing local elevation.
Using the gridded population dataset (CIESIN 2016)
an estimate of the highlands population living in these
locations was found to be approximately 6.5 million
for the 15 °C threshold and 2.2 million people for the
18 °C threshold.

 Discussion and conclusions
The increasing trends in TE18 and TE15 are consistent
with a statistically significant (p < 0.05) upward trend
in minimum temperature across Ethiopia of 0.20 °C/
decade from 1981�2014 seen in the ENACTS v5 data
(figure S5). It is also consistent with observed shifts
towards
higher
minimum
temperatures
in
the
probability distribution functions for six highland
temperature stations (figure S6). While minimum
temperatures, and thus their trends, can be sensitive to
local factors such as land use changes (Pielke 2005),
the observed increases in TE18 and TE15 are
consistent with anthropogenic climate change associ-
ated with increasing greenhouse gases (IPCC 2013). In
addition, both maximum and minimum temperatures
show statistically significant upward trends.
The marked spatial variations in TE18 and TE15
indicate a very practical limitation of using elevation
alone to demarcate regions with or without epidemic
malaria (Aregawi et al 2014). In addition, this result
provides an important caveat to assuming tropical air
temperature at higher elevation land areas decrease at a
fixed rate with altitude, or lapse rate (Patz and Olson
2006). In land regions with highly heterogeneous
topography there can be substantial differences in air
temperature at different land locations at the same
elevation and between surface air temperatures in
mountainous locations with that in the free atmo-
sphere (e.g. above the ocean) at the same altitude
(Lundquist and Cayan 2007). Using a fixed lapse rate
assumption and the spatial interpolation of sparse
temperature station observations would lead to
substantial errors when conducting the type of analysis
considered here.
Exceeding the minimum temperature threshold
necessary for malaria transmission is not, of course, a
prediction of an actual increase in malaria. The
dynamics of malaria transmission are markedly more
complex, with TE18 and TE15 indicating only
necessary but not sufficient conditions for the
transmission of two important malarial parasites.
However,
those
necessary
conditions
do
show
statistically significant upward trends in elevation
over the past three plus decades. In addition, a recent
study by Siraj et al (2014) found that the El Niño years
of 1997 and 2002 were both associated with increased
temperatures as well as an increase in prevalence of
malaria at higher elevations in a sub-domain of the
Ethiopian highlands. The upward trends in TE15 and
TE18 identified here are therefore a concern. In
particular, the TE increases are occurring in the
densely populated highlands, where higher elevation
has historically served as a buffer against malaria
transmission.
A fundamental challenge in undertaking assess-
ments of possible linkages between climate variabil-
ity and trends on changes in malaria prevalence in
the highlands of East Africa has been access to
quality-controlled, high spatial resolution climate
data. The ENACTS climate dataset was developed to
address such problems and was used here to explore
temporal
variations
and
trends
in
minimum
temperature conditions necessary for the transmis-
sion of malaria in the Ethiopian highlands. Using
these new data we have quantified the influence of
the warm and cold phases of ENSO on the elevation
where these two temperature thresholds occur while
also identifying statistically significant increases in
these elevations over roughly the past three decades.
Overall, our results underscore a new capability for
conducting detailed climate analyses in the Ethiopi-
an Highlands, which in the current case provides
substantial evidence that the temperature suitability
for malaria transmission is climbing the Ethiopian
highlands.
