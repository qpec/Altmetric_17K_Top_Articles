Mutations in human b3-tubulin (TUBB3) cause an ocular motility disorder termed congenital
fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3 (CFEOM3). In CFEOM3, the oculomotor nervous
system develops abnormally due to impaired axon guidance and maintenance; however, the
underlying mechanism linking TUBB3 mutations to axonal growth defects remains unclear.
Here, we investigate microtubule (MT)-based motility in vitro using MTs formed with
recombinant TUBB3. We find that the disease-associated TUBB3 mutations R262H and
R262A impair the motility and ATPase activity of the kinesin motor. Engineering a mutation in
the L12 loop of kinesin surprisingly restores a normal level of motility and ATPase activity on
MTs carrying the R262A mutation. Moreover, in a CFEOM3 mouse model expressing the
same mutation, overexpressing the suppressor mutant kinesin restores axonal growth in vivo.
Collectively, these findings establish the critical role of the TUBB3-R262 residue for mediating
kinesin interaction, which in turn is required for normal axonal growth and brain development.

icrotubules (MTs), polymers of a/b-tubulin hetero-
dimers, play critical roles in the developing nervous
system1,2. Several distinct a- and b-tubulin isotypes
are found in mammalian brain, and their tightly controlled
spatiotemporal expression is essential for brain formation
and function. Each tubulin isotype plays a specific role, and
accordingly, mutations in tubulin genes are linked to neurological
diseases with distinct phenotypes in an isotype-specific manner3–5.
Among the six b-tubulin isotypes expressed in the mammalian
brain, class-III b-tubulin (TUBB3) is unique in its expression
pattern in the nervous system. TUBB3 is primarily limited to
neurons6, and confers a highly dynamic property to MTs
compared with other b-tubulin isotypes7. Notably, the neuronal
expression level of TUBB3 is highest during the period of axon
outgrowth and is reduced in the adult central nervous system,
suggesting that the dynamic property of TUBB3 is important for
aspects of nervous system development8.
The uniqueness of TUBB3 is underscored by the fact that
TUBB3’s function cannot be replaced by other b-tubulin isotypes,
not even by TUBB2, despite the 90% sequence identity between
these two isotypes9. The class-III tubulin diverged from the
common ancestor of class II, III and IV b-tubulins when
vertebrates emerged; since then, this particular isotype has
maintained 99% sequence identity across vertebrate species8
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Accordingly, the unique properties of
TUBB3 critically depends on its exact sequence, and mutations in
TUBB3 in humans are associated with a spectrum of brain
malformation and neurological disorders9–11. Specifically, eight
heterozygous missense mutations in human TUBB3 are reported
to cause congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3
(CFEOM3). Patients show hypoplasia of the oculomotor nerves
and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, anterior commissure
and corticospinal tracts11. These defects point to an essential
function for TUBB3 in the processes of axonal outgrowth and
maintenance during development.
A subset of the TUBB3 mutations causing CFEOM3 (R262C/H,
E410K and D417H/N) has been studied in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, where the mutant b-tubulins were found to impair
the MT interaction with Kip3p and Kip2p kinesins. Therefore,
axonal growth defects in patients may likely result from
compromised kinesin–MT interactions11. Nevertheless, although
the involvement of TUBB3 acidic residues E410 and D417 in
kinesin–MT interaction is supported by both in vitro and in vivo
observations12,13, the involvement of basic residue R262 is
uncertain. For example, a recent study in cultured mouse
hippocampal neurons found no effect of the R262C mutation
on KIF5B- or KIF21A-dependent transport13. The kinesin–MT
interactions are primarily dependent on the interactions between
the acidic residues in tubulin and the basic residues in kinesin14–18.
Residue R262 has been neglected in these analyses because of
its positive charge and its location in the H8-S7 loop, which is
outside the C-terminal hairpin structures of a- and b-tubulin
(H11–H110–H12) where other critical acidic residues reside
(Fig. 1). Because the R262 mutation is the most common
mutation in patients with CFEOM3, delineating its role in
kinesin
motility
is
essential
for
understanding
the
disease
mechanism.
A
better
understanding
of
whether
and
how
R262
is
involved in the kinesin interaction warrants a detailed examina-
tion of the effect of TUBB3 mutations on kinesin motility in a
cell-free system. However, such an analysis has been hampered by
a lack of methods to purify recombinant TUBB3 tubulin.
To overcome this issue, we have recently developed a method
to express and purify the heterodimer of human TUBA1B
(a-tubulin) and TUBB3 tubulin using a baculovirus-insect
cell expression system19. Here, using this new method, we
demonstrate that TUBB3 R262H and R262A mutations inhibit
the motility of kinesin in vitro. The reduced turnover rate of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis (kcat) indicates that the
interaction via the R262 residue is critical for triggering ADP
release from kinesin’s nucleotide pocket. In agreement with this
interpretation, the crystal structure of the kinesin–tubulin
complex in its nucleotide-free state reveals that the R262 in
tubulin binds with the D279 in the L12 loop of kinesin, which
then connects to an element in the switch I/II subdomains20.
With these biochemical and structural data, we sought a kinesin
mutant that could bypass the effects of the TUBB3 R262A
mutation and move on the mutant MT. We did indeed find one:
in a proof-of-principle experiment, expressing this mutant
kinesin in a mouse CFEOM3 disease model by in utero
electroporation rescued axonal growth in the developing brain.
Altogether, our findings establish that disruption of kinesin–MT
interactions is a major cause for axonal growth defects in
CFEOM3 patients.

 reported charged-to-alanine tubulin mutants12,17, the TUBB3
R262A mutant was also expressed. The WT, R262H and R262A
tubulins were purified using His and FLAG tags and polymerized
into MTs (Supplementary Fig. 2b), but the yield of R262C tubulin
was too low for use in biochemistry experiments due to the low
solubility of the protein.
In the single-molecule motility assays using total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy, the two-headed KIF5B motor
(human KIF5B construct HK432 at a concentration of 0.4 nM)
did not bind to R262H or R262A MTs (Fig. 2a; Table 1), while it
did move on the WT MTs at a velocity of 0.57±0.19 mm s � 1
(mean±s.d., N ¼ 480). In the former cases, the kinesin scarcely
bound to the mutant MTs even when the kinesin concentration
was raised to 20 nM. Moreover, in MT-gliding assays using native
KIF5, R262H and R262A MTs could not move on the kinesin-
coated glass surface, while WT MTs moved at a velocity of
0.65±0.08 mm s � 1 (mean±s.d., N ¼ 120). Therefore, the R262
residue in TUBB3 is critical for kinesin–MT interaction.
Measurement of MT-activated kinesin ATPase activity revealed
that the R262H and R262A mutations reduced the ATP
hydrolysis rate (kcat) to 17 and 23% of that of WT, respectively,
and increased the value of apparent Michaelis–Menten constant
(K0.5MT) 9.7 and 10 times of that of WT, respectively (Fig. 2b;
Table 1). This result contrasts to our previous observation with
the acidic critical residues in b-tubulin17. The charged-to-alanine
mutations in acidic residues E410A and D417A, located in H12 of
b-tubulin, have also been shown to impair kinesin motility.
However, in the ATPase measurement, these mutations did not
affect the value of kcat (Supplementary Table 1). They only
elevated the value of K0.5MT. The result indicates that basic
residue R262 plays a distinct role, different from the role of other
acidic residues in b-tubulin.
A mutant kinesin rescues motility impaired by TUBB3 mutation.
According to the crystal structure of the kinesin–tubulin
complex20, b-R262 is a binding partner for D279 in the kinesin
L12 loop in the nucleotide-free state (Fig. 3a). Adjacent to D279
in L12, there exists a highly conserved R278 (Fig. 3b), known to
be most influential in determining the affinity of kinesin with the
MT14. The substitution of R278 resulted in a 15-fold increase in
the value of ATPase K0.5MT. Because the b-R262A mutation in
tubulin shows a similar high impact on K0.5MT (Supplementary
Table 1), we hypothesized that the role of b-R262 might be to
guide the kinesin residue R278 to its binding partner (presumably
D417 in the H12 helix of b-tubulin) by forming a salt bridge with
the adjacent D279. According to this hypothesis, kinesin might
move on the R262A MT if the residue R278 can bind to its
partner residue(s) on an MT without being guided by b-R262.
To test this possibility, we attempted to engineer such a mutant
kinesin that can move on an R262A MT by introducing the
D279N and D279R mutations to the L12 loop of kinesin. Our
expectation was that the reduction or reversal of the negative
charge at D279 might reduce the electrostatic repulsion between
D279 of kinesin and D417 and/or E421 of b-tubulin, allowing the
adjacent R278 in kinesin to approach its binding partner(s).
In a single-molecule motility assay, both D279R KIF5B and
D279N KIF5B moved on WT MTs at a velocity comparable to
that of WT KIF5B (Fig. 3c,d, upper panel; Table 1). We found
that D279R KIF5B moved on R262A MTs, but D279N KIF5B did
not (Fig. 3c, lower panel). In an independent experiment, we
confirmed that D279R KIF5B was not constitutively active;
it could not move on b-E410A MTs, which was previously shown
to be critical for kinesin motility12. Altogether, these results
demonstrated that the mutation D279R, but not D279N,
recovered the motility of KIF5B on R262A MTs. We also
investigated whether the mutation D279R can recover the
motility of KIF5B on R262H MTs, but the motility was not
restored.
Along with motility, the D279R KIF5B mutation showed
enhanced ATPase activity by R262A MTs (Fig. 3e; Table 1). The
K0.5MT value was slightly higher than that of the WT–WT pairs.
Despite the recovered motility and ATPase activity in the
paired mutant combinations of D279R KIF5B and R262A MT,
their interaction differed from that of WT KIF5B–WT MTs in
their motile and biochemical properties, as described below.
In a single-molecule motility assay, the binding frequency of
D279R KIF5B to R262A MT was higher than that of the WT–WT
combination (Table 1). Moreover, the movement of D279R
KIF5B on the R262A MT was less smooth than the WT–WT
combination. It stochastically passes between two modes, that is,
a fast-moving mode and a sluggish mode, thus giving rise to the
distribution of instantaneous velocities in two Gaussians (Fig. 3d).
In the former mode, D279R KIF5B moved at a velocity slightly
higher than that of the WT–WT combination (Table 1). In the
latter, D279R KIF5B was either stalled at the same position or
showed bidirectional drag along a R262A MT, thereby producing
no net displacement. Such motility properties are unique to this
paired mutant combination. Our previous analyses have shown
that the charged-to-alanine mutations in the acidic residues of
both a- and b-tubulin simply lowered the binding frequency
and/or velocity of kinesin17. Regarding the binding affinity of the
KIF5B–MT complex, a co-sedimentation assay using a minimal
motor (a single-headed KIF5B construct, HK349) revealed
that the affinity in the paired mutant combination (D279R
KIF5B-b-R262A MT) was still lower than that of the WT–WT
pair, showing a 2-, 10- and 2-fold increase in Kd values in the
ADP, nucleotide-free and AMPPNP states, respectively, as
compared with the WT–WT pair (Fig. 3f; Supplementary
Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 2). Even though the affinity did
not fully recover in the paired mutant combinations, the D279R
mutation was highly effective in suppressing the R262A mutation
effect, considering the large increase in Kd values brought about
by the R262A mutation (B6-, B70- and B90-fold increase in
the ADP, nucleotide-free and AMPPNP states, respectively, as
compared with the WT–WT pair).

 The mutant kinesin rescues axonal growth defects. In light of
the axonal growth defects in patients with CFEOM3 that result
from mutations at R262, we next examined whether D279R
kinesin rescued such defects in cultured neurons. Dissociated
neurons from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) cerebral cortices were
transfected with plasmids encoding WT, R262H or R262A
TUBB3. After a 72- h culture, the lengths of the tau-1-positive
axons in the cortical neurons were examined by immunocy-
tochemistry (Fig. 4a). Compared with the control cells that were
transfected with WT TUBB3, the transfection of R262H and
R262A TUBB3 perturbed the growth of axons, resulting in B20%
reductions in axon length (mean±s.e.m., 42.5±2.2, 32.7±1.6
and 34.5±1.9 mm for the WT, R262H and R262A TUBB3,
respectively; Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4), which was statistically
significant (P ¼ 0.002 and P ¼ 0.035 for R262H and R262A,
respectively, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc pairwise
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests). In contrast, the cotransfection
of D279R KIF5B with R262A TUBB3 suppressed the reduction in
axon length; the difference in axon length, as compared with the
control cells, was insignificant (39.2±2.2 mm; P ¼ 0.30, ANOVA
with post hoc pairwise Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests). Thus,
axonal growth was perturbed only in the conditions in which no
motility was observed in the in vitro motility assay.
Because previous studies have implied a unique role of KIF21A
in development of the nervous system21–24, in a separate set of
experiments, we also tested the effect of cotransfection of D325R
KIF21A, the mutation equivalent to D279R in KIF5B, with R262A
TUBB3 (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4). While the transfection of
R262A TUBB3 caused significant reduction of axon length
(mean±s.e.m., 32.8±1.7 for WT and 26.7±1.6 mm for R262A
TUBB3; P ¼ 0.003, ANOVA with post hoc pairwise Wilcoxon–
Mann–Whitney tests), the pair of mutants resulted in axon
length comparable to that of control cells transfected with WT
TUBB3 (34.8±1.7 mm; P ¼ 0.63, ANOVA with post hoc pairwise
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests). Again, the axonal growth
perturbed by R262A TUBB3 was rescued by the suppressor
mutation D325R in KIF21A. Expression of D325R KIF21A alone
did not increase axonal length (34.2±1.8 mm; P ¼ 0.63, ANOVA
with post hoc pairwise Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests).
The rescue of axonal growth was even more prominent in an
in vivo experiment in the developing mouse brain. In this
experiment, a set of mutant kinesin and tubulin used in the above
experiment were co-transfected with EYFP reporter into the
cortical layer 2/3 commissure neurons at E15.5 with in utero
electroporation25, and the elongation of commissural axons at
postnatal day 3 (P3) was determined by immunolabelling for
EYFP and TUBB3 (Fig. 4c,d). The elongation of TUBB3-positive
axons was significantly reduced by the transfection of R262H or
R262A TUBB3 (mean±s.e.m., 1,558±85 for WT, 770±42 mm
for R262H and 406±65 for R262A; Po0.001 for both of the
TUBB3 mutants, ANOVA with post hoc Tukey–Kramer tests,
Fig. 4e). The cotransfection of D279R KIF5B and R262A TUBB3
partially rescued the axonal growth. However, the axon length
was still slightly shorter than that of the control cells transfected
with WT TUBB3 (1,226±69 mm; P ¼ 0.047, ANOVA with post
hoc Tukey–Kramer tests). The cotransfection of D325R KIF21A
and R262A TUBB3 was more effective for the rescue and resulted
in
an
axon
length
comparable
to
that
of
control
cells
(1,446±41 mm; P ¼ 0.93, ANOVA with post hoc Tukey–Kramer
tests). We confirmed that the transfection of either D279R KIF5B
or D325R KIF21A alone did not result in overextension of axons
(Fig. 4e), indicating that neither of them were constitutively
active. These in vivo observations, together with the results that
were obtained with the cultured neurons, collectively indicate
that the interaction between MTs containing TUBB3 and
KIF21A/KIF5B is essential for normal axonal growth.
Discussion
To date, there has been no evidence for a basic tubulin residue
playing a critical role in kinesin-based motility12,13,17. However, a
recent study in yeast showed that introducing the CFEOM3-
associated mutation of the TUBB3 basic residue (R262C or
R262H) to the yeast TUB2 gene blocked Kip3p accumulation at
MT plus-ends11. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether this

 basic residue mutation could inhibit the in vitro motility of
kinesin when expressed in TUBB3. Our analyses revealed that the
R262H or R262A mutations in TUBB3 impaired kinesin motility
and the MT-activated ATPase of a two-headed KIF5B motor
(Fig. 2; Table 1). Similar to an earlier study that reported a low
yield of R262C tubulin in rabbit reticulocytes11, the poor yield of
R262C TUBB3 prevented us from examining its effects on
motility. However, the observation in yeast cells that both R262C
and R262H mutations decreased Kip3p accumulation on the plus
end of MTs indicated that R262C might impair kinesin motility if
tested in vitro.
Having established the importance of the basic residue b-R262
in kinesin motility, our next questions were which residues of
kinesin interact with b-R262 and how does this interaction
contribute to the kinesin–MT interaction. A drastic reduction in
kcat by b-R262H or b-R262A mutations indicates that b-R262
might play a crucial role in mediating the structural signals
required for ATPase activation. It contrasts with the role of the
critical acidic residues in b-tubulin (b-E410 and b-D417) that
increase the affinity of kinesin to MT (K0.5MT) without affecting
kcat (Supplementary Table 1)17. According to the crystal structure
of the kinesin–tubulin complex and the model of the kinesin–MT
complex based on cryo-EM images20,26,27, b-R262 is a binding
partner for D279 in the kinesin L12 loop in the nucleotide-free
and ATP-bound states (Fig. 3a). Upon MT binding, the
rearrangement of salt bridges near this pair may contribute to
the conformational change in kinesin, leading to ADP release
from the nucleotide pocket20,27. The sequence of the L12 loop
and the adjacent a5 helix is highly conserved in kinesin,
indicating
the
importance
of
this
region
in
its
function
(Fig. 3b).
Earlier work using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of kinesin
showed that while the residue substitution at D279 reduced the
value of ATPase K0.5MT to about half of that of the WT, the
substitution in the adjacent R278 resulted in a more than 15-fold
increase in this value (Supplementary Table 1)14. The latter

 15-fold increase is outstanding, given that residue substitutions in
all other kinesin sites brought at most only a fourfold increase in
K0.5MT. This outstanding impact of R278A mutation in kinesin is
comparable to the 10-fold increase in K0.5MT by the R262A
tubulin mutation (Supplementary Table 1).
Such similarly potent effects of kinesin R278A and tubulin
R262A on K0.5MT values, and the close proximity of these two
residues in three-dimensional space, suggest the possibility that
b-R262 in tubulin may interact with D279 in the L12 loop of
kinesin, and thereby mediate the encounter of adjacent R278 to
its binding partner (presumably D417 in the H12 helix of
b-tubulin) (Fig. 5a). In other words, because the MT is highly
negatively charged, before (or concomitant with) binding with
kinesin R278, the negative charge of D279 in the kinesin may
need to be neutralized by electropositive b-R262 on the MT;
otherwise, the D279 of kinesin and the D417 and/or E421 of
b-tubulin will repel each other and prevent R278’s access to the
MT. This hypothesis is consistent with the local structural change
at the binding interface, as shown in the models of kinesin–MT
complexes15,27,28 and molecular dynamics simulations29.
This hypothesis predicts that kinesin might move on the
R262A MT if the kinesin residue R278 can bind to its partner
residue(s) on an MT without mediation by R262. Indeed, D279R
KIF5B moved on a b-R262A MT (Fig. 3c,d; Table 1), indicating
that a reversal of negative charge at D279 might have allowed
the R278 to approach its binding partner without a charge
neutralization of D279. In this mutant pairs, the lack of a
D279-b-R262
(KIF5B–MT)
salt
bridge
might
have
been
compensated for by the electrostatic interaction of D279R-b-
E421 (Fig. 5b). That D279N KIF5B did not move on R262A
MTs is also consistent with our hypothesis; the electrostatic
attraction between the putative binding sites is reliant on only a
single pair of charged residues (Fig. 5c), which might be too weak
for the kinesin–MT interaction to occur (see further discussion
below).
In the D279R KIF5B-b-R262H MT mutant pairs, neither the
motility nor the ATPase was rescued (Table 1). This result is not
surprising considering the high histidine activity in molecular
interactions30. Because histidine is capable of interacting with
various amino acids, the mutation R262H might have modulated
the MTs by hydrogen bonding(s), which cannot be compensated
by D279R KIF5B11.
Our concluding question was what was the role of a pair with
opposite charges in kinesin motility? In the paired mutant

combinations provides us with insight into the unique role of
basic residue R262 in motility.
Compared with the WT–WT pairs of kinesin–MT, in the

of kinesin along the MT. The energy of each charge pair face-to-face is defined in the inset. In the WT KIF5B–WT MT pair (left), the energy landscape

 interaction duration in single-molecule motility and a slightly
higher value of K0.5MT in the ATPase measurement (Table 1).
These observations indicate that the binding free energy between
D279R KIF5B and R262A MT is smaller than that in the
WT–WT pair. In contrast to the two (or possibly three) salt
bridges with identical polarities across the D279R KIF5B-b-
R262A MT interface (Fig. 5b), the polarities of the two salt
bridges across WT KIF5B–WT MT interface are opposite
(Fig. 5a), which may make the latter complex more stable31.
On the other hand, the motility data showed that the binding
frequency of D279R KIF5B to the R262A MT was two times
higher than the binding frequency of WT KIF5B to WT MT
(Table 1). Moreover, D279R KIF5B occasionally stalled or showed
bidirectional drag along R262A MT (Fig. 3c,d). These results
indicated the increased stability of the interaction between D279R
KIF5B-b-R262A MT compared with that of the WT–WT pairs,
which is contrary to the reduced stability of the interaction in
solution (Fig. 3f).
These apparent discrepancies can be elucidated if we assume
that the interaction between D279 and R262 had two opposite
functions: it facilitates binding, but at the same time, it mediates
detachment of the rear head from the MT during the processive
run of two-headed kinesin undergoing ATP hydrolysis. We will
explain this in the following paragraphs.
Facilitated binding: The interface of KIF5B for MT is dominated
by positively charged residues, which produce a large area of
enhanced
positive
electrostatic
potential
(Fig.
5d,e,
upper
panel)18,32. On the other hand, due to the high density of
negatively charged residues, MT presents a streak of strong
negative electrostatic potential that runs along the outer ridge of
the MT protofilament (Fig. 5d,e, lower panel)33. These profiles of
the electrostatic potentials allow KIF5B holding ADP to execute
one-dimensional Brownian motion along the MT, while it is
constrained in the negative potential of the MT34,35. With this
background of the majority charges, the basic tubulin residue R262
and the acidic kinesin residue D279 are very few exceptions on the
electropositive and electronegative surface of KIF5B and MT,
respectively, reversing the potential landscape around their location
(Fig. 5e, marked by yellow circles). Such local reversal in the
potential landscape should help KIF5B locate its binding site
during a diffusional search along MT, thus accelerating the
subsequent transition to stereospecific binding (Fig. 5f, left)36.
In the paired mutants D279R KIF5B-b-R262A MT, the lack of
reversed charges, D279 and R262, might make a diffusional search
of the binding site less efficient (Fig. 5f, right), causing prolonged
diffusion in the weak-binding state (higher velocity compared with
that of the WT–WT pairs) (Table 1; Fig. 3d, lower panel).
Mediation of detachment: For KIF5B bound on an MT, a small
stagger in the relative position of D279 and R262, triggered by an
external load, will result in each of these residues facing the like
charges, thus allowing KIF5B to be ejected from the binding site
(Fig. 5f, left). In the paired mutant D279R KIF5B-b-R262A MT,
the lack of reversed charges may have eliminated the electrostatic
repulsion, causing an ejection of the ADP-bound rear head from
the MT difficult, and thus resulting in the stalling and/or dragging
of kinesin (Fig. 5f, right).
In short, our model presumes that the reversed charge of D279
and R262 serves as an electrostatic latch, with its on and off being
controlled by electrostatic attractions and repulsions. Although
this model is currently speculative, it is consistent with the
motility data (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 5) and the results of
the mutagenesis analysis of kinesin14. The validity of our model
will be addressed in future studies by measuring the frequency
and duration of stereospecific binding during diffusional scanning
of the single-headed KIF5B along an MT under the ADP
condition37,38.
Though our model is based on the results of an experiment
using R262A MTs, it may explain the molecular mechanism
underlying the impaired motility of the WT KIF5B on the
disease-associated mutation R262H (Fig. 2). In this mutant, the
reduction in the positive charge at residue R262 may result in
MTs with an even surface potential, thus the electrostatic latch
between R262 and D279 does not function.
Notably, a recent analysis of the critical residues in tubulin
for dynein motility indicated that similar mechanisms may
operate in this motor39. The basic residue a-R403 is essential
for dynein to switch from diffusional movement to stereo-
specific binding, and its central importance is highlighted by the
finding that a mutation in the equivalent residue in human
TUBA3, a-R402H, disrupted dynein motility and caused
lissencephaly40.
To compare the results of the in vitro analyses to the in vivo
phenotypes of the disease, we recapitulated the axonal growth
defect/rescue by overexpressing mutant TUBB3, KIF5B and
KIF21A in cultured neurons and neurons in developing mouse
brain (Fig. 4). In both experiments, the perturbation/recovery
of axonal growth in neurons occurred in parallel with the
perturbation/recovery of motility in vitro. While the over-
expression
of
R262A

growth,
the
coexpression of D279R KIF5B partially rescued the axonal
growth perturbed by R262A, and the coexpression of D325R
KIF21A led to a full recovery of axonal growth. The single-
molecule motility assay confirmed that WT KIF21A showed no
motility along R262A/R262H MTs, whereas D325R KIF21A
moved on R262A MTs at a velocity of 0.16±0.45 mm s � 1, which
was
comparable
to
that
of
WT
KIF21A
on
WT
MTs
(0.18±0.32 mm s � 1; Supplementary Table 3). These observations
indicate that the interaction between the KIF motors and TUBB3
MTs was essential for axonal growth. Although R262A is a
synthetic mutant, not reported in CFEOM3 patients, its similarity
to disease-associated mutation R262H (that is, impaired motility
and axonal growth defect) justifies its use as a model to
investigate the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis. In
agreement with our observation, a previous analysis of in utero
electroporation demonstrated that the overexpression of TUBB3
with mutations at the acidic residues that are critical for kinesin
motility (either E410K or D417H) perturbs axonal elongation in
developing mouse brain13.
The extent of recovery in axon length was higher with D325R
KIF21A than it was with D279R KIF5B. This may indicate
distinct functions of these two motors during neuronal develop-
ment. A recent immunohistochemical analysis of KIF21A knock-
in mice indicated that KIF21A is essential for the molecular
cascade controlling the steering of axonal growth24. Considering
its condensed distribution in growth cones in a developing brain,
KIF21A may bind to TUBB3-rich MTs at the growth cones
and thus regulate the axon steering and elongation23,24,41. For
KIF5B, an earlier study has shown that the suppression of KIF5
expression inhibits the polarization of hippocampal neurons42,
indicating that this motor might be crucial for axon outgrowth.
Accordingly, a recent analysis in Drosophila cultured neurons
demonstrated that KIF5B-powered MT sliding is essential for the
initial outgrowth of neurites43. The exact molecular mechanisms
of how the interaction of TUBB3 with kinesin facilitates axon
growth required further investigation.
In this study, the use of human TUBB3 tubulin allowed us to
compare the results between in vitro and in vivo systems without
having to deal with differences between the tubulin isotypes
(for example, human TUBB3 versus yeast TUB2 tubulin)11. By
extending this new approach towards the dissection of the
pathogenic mechanisms in various neurological disorders, with
each associated with a specific tubulin isotype2–6,10,40,44–46, we

Methods
Preparation of recombinant tubulins. Sequences of Homo sapiens a1-tubulin
(TUBA1B; NP_006073) and b3-tubulin (TUBB3; NP_006077) were custom
synthesized, with each clone fused with a glycine-based linker (GGSGG) and a
peptide tag. For a1- and b3-tubulin, a His tag (HHHHHHHH) and a FLAG tag
(DYKDDDDK) were used, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2a)19. The codon
usage of the sequences was optimized for expression in insect cells. To exclude
variability due to acetylation, TUBA1B was made unacetylatable by residue
substitution K40R and treated as WT. To increase expression levels, an L21 leader
sequence47 was added to each of these sequences just before the start codon, and
the inserts were cloned into the pFastBac Dual vector (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA).
The recombinant tubulin vector was expressed in HighFive cells (Life
Technologies) using the Bac-to-Bac System (Life Technologies). HighFive cells
grown to a concentration of 2.0–2.5 � 106 ml � 1, were infected with the viruses and
cultured for a further 48–72 h in suspension at 27 �C. Cells were collected (B15 g
wet weight from 1 litre of suspension culture) and lysed for 15 min in 90 ml of PMI
buffer (0.1 M PIPES, 10 mM MgSO4, 2 mM EGTA and pH 6.8) supplemented with
0.5 M 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propane sulfonate (NDSB201, Calbiochem, Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany), 1% CHAPS, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP
and protease inhibitors. This and the following steps were performed on ice or at
4 �C, unless otherwise stated. The lysate was centrifuged for 25 min at 200,000g.
The resultant supernatant was supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol and adsorbed
to 30 ml of DEAE Sepharose resin (DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) for
60 min. After a wash with DEAE wash buffer (0.1 M PIPES, 10 mM MgSO4, 10%
glycerol, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP and protease inhibitors, pH 6.8), the
retained protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl, pH 7.0.
This crude fraction (B40 ml) was mixed with 4 ml of TALON resin (Clontech,
Takara-Bio Inc., Ootsu, Japan) for 30 min. His-tagged tubulin was eluted with
PMG buffer (0.1 M PIPES, 5 mM MgSO4, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0) supplemented with
0.3 M NaCl and 0.25 M imidazole. The eluate was diluted with an equal volume
of PMI buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol, 1 mM GTP, 2 mM ATP and
0.04% NP-40, and mixed with 4 ml of anti-FLAG-tag antibody-conjugated resin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. FLAG-tagged tubulin was eluted with BRB80 buffer
(80 mM PIPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8) supplemented with 10%
glycerol, 1 mM GTP and 0.2 mg ml � 1 FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich).
The purified tubulin was concentrated to 3–8 mg ml � 1 with an Amicon
Ultracel-30 K filter (Millipore, Merck KGaA), centrifuged to remove aggregation
and then polymerized by adding 0.2–2 mM of taxol (Tocris) at 30 �C for 0.5–1.5 h.
The polymerized material was supplemented with 2 mM ATP, 1 M NaCl and
20 mM Taxol, and then centrifuged for 12 min at 250,000g. The pellet was
suspended in BRB buffer containing 1 mM GTP and 0.1 mM taxol at room
temperature (RT). The MTs were stored at RT until use. Alternatively, tubulin
dimer eluted from the FLAG affinity column was concentrated to 45 mg ml � 1,
frozen in liquid N2 and stored at � 80 �C until use. Upon use, tubulin was thawed
and further purified by a cycle of polymerization and depolymerization.
Preparation of other proteins. To produce dimeric kinesin constructs HK432 and
KIF21A-552, amino-acid residue 1–432 of KIF5B and residue 1–552 of KIF21A
were each fused to a spacer (GGGGSGGGGS), a SNAP tag (New England Biolabs),
a spacer (G) and a His6 tag, respectively. For the monomeric kinesin
construct HK349, amino-acid residues 1–349 of KIF5B were fused to a
spacer (GGGGSGGGGS), SNAP tag, a spacer residue (G) and a His6 tag
(K349-SNAP-His). These constructs were expressed in E. coli then purified using
immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (TALON, Clontech). The purified
proteins were labelled with fluorescent dye BG-549 (SNAP-surface 549; New
England Biolabs) at a dye-to-protein ratio of 2:1–5:1 for 60 min at RT, and
separated from the free dye by gel filtration using a NAP-5 column (GE
Healthcare) and by MT-affinity purification. The stoichiometry of the labelling was
40.9, as determined from the concentrations of both BG-549 and kinesin protein.
Single-molecule motility assay. The surface of the glass slides (FF-001,
Matsunami) were coated with biotin-functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG)
(BIO-PEG-SC molecular weight ¼ 3,400, Laysan Bio)48. A microscope chamber
(18 mm � 7 mm � B30 mm) was constructed using a coverslip (#2918, Iwaki) and
a PEG-coated glass slide. The MTs (either WT or R262A/H) were immobilized on
the bottom of the chamber ( ¼ PEG-coated glass) via streptavidin and biotinylated
nonmotile mutant kinesin, HK340-E236A-biotin49. A motility assay was conducted
in � 2 MA buffer solution ( � 2 motility assay buffer; 10 mM K-acetate, 20 mM
PIPES-KOH, 4 mM MgSO4, 2 mM EGTA and 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 6.8)
supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 1 mg ml � 1 casein, 10 mM taxol, 1%
2-mercaptoethanol, and oxygen scavengers50 using BG-549-labelled HK432 at a
concentration of 0.4 nM and a temperature of 25±1 �C. The motility was
examined using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. A dark-field
image of the unlabelled MTs and a fluorescent image of BG-549-labelled HK432
were simultaneously recorded using an EMCCD camera (ImagEM C9100-13,
Hamamatsu Photonics Co.) over an observation period of o30 min (ref. 17).
Image analysis of a single-molecule motility assay. The motion of each single
BG-549-labelled kinesin was tracked using a tracking software (Mark2, kindly
provided by Dr Ken’ya Furuta), and the data were processed and analysed using R
statistical package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and in-house macro
programs. The mean velocity was calculated by fitting the distribution of velocities
(with a time interval of 0.3 s) to double-Gaussian curves. The mean run length and
duration was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting of the data to the
cumulative frequency distribution51, with the lower limit being set to 0.1 mm
(run length) and 0.2 s (duration), respectively. The data were obtained by 3–4
independent experiments each containing 460 motor measurements.
Multiple-motor motility assay. For an MT-gliding assay, a flow chamber
prepared from a coverslip and a glass slide (9 mm � 9 mm � B80 mm) was loaded
by first flowing casein solution (10 mg ml � 1 of casein in 10 mM Tris, 0.1 M NaCl),
waiting for 3 min and then sequentially chasing with the following solutions:
(1) 12 ml of � 2 MA buffer solution; (2) 6 ml of � 2 MA buffer containing native
kinesin (1–12 mg ml � 1); and (3) 6 ml of the MT solution (10 � 50 mg ml � 1 in � 2
MA buffer) supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 1 mg ml � 1 casein and 10 mM taxol12.
The chamber was sealed with nail enamel and the interaction of MTs with kinesin
on the glass surface was observed under a dark-field microscope (BX50; Plan 40,
numerical aperture ¼ 0.65, Olympus) at 25±1 �C. The images were projected onto
an image-intensified charge-coupled device camera (C3077-70 and C8600-05,
Hamamatsu Photonics) and stored in a digital video recorder (DR20, Sony). The
kinesin density on the glass surface is estimated to be 200–2,400 mm � 2 (refs 12,52).
Biochemical analysis of kinesin–MT interaction. MT-activated ATPase
activity of WT and mutant HK432 was determined by the malachite green method
at 25 �C (ref. 53). Equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was measured by
co-sedimentation of BG-549-labelled HK349 with MTs according to the standard
method54 with some modification34. Assays were performed in � 2 MA buffer
solution supplemented with 1 mg ml � 1 casein, 40 mM taxol and either 1 mM ADP
and 1 U ml � 1 hexokinase (H500, Sigma), 1 U ml � 1 apyrase (A-6132, Sigma) or
1 mM AMPPNP and 1 U ml � 1 apyrase.
Animals. Outbred ICR (CD-1) 10–12-week-old timed pregnant female mice were
obtained from Japan SLC. Mid-day of the day of vaginal plug discovery was
considered embryonic (E) day 0.5. This study was approved by the RIKEN
Research Ethics Committee. Animals were handled under an animal use protocol
approved by the committee.
Primary culture and transfection of cerebral cortex. E16.5 embryonic cerebral
cortices of the ICR mouse were treated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at
37 �C and dissociated into single cells by gentle trituration55. Cells were suspended
in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, then changed to Neurobasal
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine
(Sigma). Transfections were performed using an Amaxa mouse neuron
nucleofector kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), program O-005, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Upon completion of the program, cell suspension was
combined with the pre-equilibrated Neurobasal medium and incubated in the CO2
incubator for 15 min for restoration, and then plated at a density of B60 cells per
mm2 using Neuron Culture Medium (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Tokyo, Japan) on
coverslips coated with 1 mg ml � 1 poly-L-lysine (Sigma) placed in film-bottom
culture dishes (FD10300, Matsunami Co.). For transfections, plasmid DNA
carrying TUBB3, KIF21A or KIF5B with a CAG promoter was used. For the TUBB3
constructs, a complementary DNA sequence used for overexpression in insect cells
was used, in which the His tag was replaced with V5 tag for immunolabelling.
For the KIF21A constructs, full-length mouse KIF21A (MGC:63452,
MMM1013-202798465, OpenBioSystems) fused with a haemagglutinin (HA) tag
was used. For the KIF5B constructs, a full-length human KIF5B (MGC:161557,
NHS6278-211689013, OpenBioSystems) fused with a HA tag was used.
Immunofluorescence cell staining and image acquisition. Cells were fixed in
PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose at RT for 5 min followed by
postfixation in � 20 �C ethanol for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed three times
with PBS (15 min each), permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min,
washed three times with PBS (5 min each) and incubated in blocking buffer
(3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at RT. The cells were then
incubated with primary antibodies, either rabbit anti-V5 polyclonal antibody
(2 mg ml � 1, AB3792, Millipore) or rat anti-HA polyclonal antibody (2 mg ml � 1,
11-867-423-001, Roche), and mouse anti-tau-1 monoclonal antibody (1/2 dilution,
IHCR1015, Millipore) for 1.5 h. After three washes with PBS, cells were
incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa-Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin-G (IgG) (5 mg ml � 1, A11012, Life Technologies), Alexa-Fluor
488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (5 mg ml � 1, A11016, Life Technologies), and

 Alexa-Fluor 350 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (5 mg ml � 1, A11045, Life
Technologies) for 1 h at RT. After three washes with PBS, the cells were mounted
with Fluoromount/Plus (Diagnostic Biosystems) and images were acquired with an
IX-73 inverted microscope (Olympus) with a digital CMOS camera (ORCA-Flash
4.0, C11440, Hamamatsu Co.). The lengths of TUBB3 and/or KIF5B/KIF21A,
and tau-1-positive neurites were measured by Simple Neurite Tracer56 for 4100
transfected cells for each construct in each set of experiments. Statistical
significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with post hoc pairwise
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests for multiple comparisons using the R statistical
package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
In utero electroporation and immunohistochemistry. The plasmid DNA
carrying EYFP with a CAG promoter was always co-injected with the plasmids
carrying TUBB3-V5, KIF5B-HA and KIF21A-HA into the lateral ventricle and
electroporated into the dorsal ventricular zone of the telencephalon at E15.5
(ref. 25). Transposon-mediated gene transfer was used for stable expression of
tubulin and kinesin genes57. Brains were harvested at P3, sectioned in the coronal
plane on a Leica sledge microtome at 20 mm and double-labelled for EYFP, and
either the V5 tag of TUBB3 or the HA tag of KIF5B/KIF21A. EYFP was labelled
with rat anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (2 mg ml � 1, GF090R, Nacalai Tesque) and
the secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 (10 mg ml � 1, A11006,
Life Technologies). V5 tag was labelled with rabbit anti-V5 polyclonal antibody
(2 mg ml � 1, AB3792, Millipore) and the secondary antibody conjugated to
Alexa-Fluor 594 (10 mg ml � 1, A11012, Life Technologies). The HA tag was labelled
with rat anti-HA polyclonal antibody (2 mg ml � 1, 11-867-423-001, Roche) and the
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 594 (10 mg ml � 1, A11007, Life
Technologies). To quantify the length of the axons, the horizontal distance from
midline (Fig. 4c,d, broken lines) to the tip of the visible commissural axons
(Fig. 4c,d, red arrowheads) was measured. Statistical significance was determined
by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey–Kramer tests for multiple comparisons.
