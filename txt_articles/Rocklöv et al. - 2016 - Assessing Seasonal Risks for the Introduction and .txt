The explosive Zika virus epidemic in the Americas is amplifying spread of this emerging pathogen into previously
unaffected regions of the world, including Europe (Gulland, 2016), where local populations are immunologically
naïve. As summertime approaches in the northern hemisphere, Aedes mosquitoes in Europe may find suitable cli-
matic conditions to acquire and subsequently transmit Zika virus from viremic travellers to local populations.
While Aedes albopictus has proven to be a vector for the transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses in Eu-
rope (Delisle et al., 2015; ECDC, n.d.) there is growing experimental and ecological evidence to suggest that it may
also be competent for Zika virus(Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016; Grard et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2013).
Here we analyze and overlay the monthly flows of airline travellers arriving into European cities from Zika affect-
ed areas across the Americas, the predicted monthly estimates of the basic reproduction number of Zika virus in
areas where Aedes mosquito populations reside in Europe (Aedes aegypti in Madeira, Portugal and Ae. albopictus in
continental Europe), and human populations living within areas where mosquito-borne transmission of Zika
virus may be possible. We highlight specific geographic areas and timing of risk for Zika virus introduction and
possible spread within Europe to inform the efficient use of human disease surveillance, vector surveillance
and control, and public education resources.

1. Introduction
On May 17th, 2015, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases
(ProMED-mail) published a report confirming locally acquired cases of
Zika virus (ZIKV) in several northeastern Brazilian states, marking the
first time this virus is known to have spread within the Americas
(Promed, 2015). Eight months later, on February 1st, 2016 the World
Health Organization declared the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas a Pub-
lic Health Emergency of International Concern, in part due to an emerg-
ing association with congenital birth anomalies such as microcephaly
(Calvet et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016; Rodrigues, 2016) and Guillain-
Barré syndrome (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016). After the virus' introduction
into Brazil, the epidemic has swiftly spread across Latin America and the
Caribbean (Faria et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2016a). Potential reasons
for this rapid spread include the presence of immunologically naïve
populations and an abundance of Aedes mosquitoes (Kraemer et al.,
2015) within a conducive environment.
As the epidemic expands in scale and geographic range, a growing
number of travellers are exporting ZIKV to other regions of the world,
including Europe, where Aedes vectors are known to be present
(Maria et al., 2016; Zammarchi et al., 2015; http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/
healthtopics/vectors/vector-maps/Pages/VBORNET_maps.aspx, n.d.).
In Europe, Aedes aegypti is known to exist on the island of Madeira,
Portugal (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/vectors/vector-maps/

western Russia, whereas Aedes albopictus is established along much of
the Mediterranean coast (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/
vectors/vector-maps/Pages/VBORNET_maps.aspx, n.d.). While virus
importation events could trigger epidemics in distant geographies
where competent Aedes mosquito vectors exist, this risk has to date,
been mitigated by winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere.
Given the growing experimental and ecological evidence to sug-
gest that Ae. albopictus may be a competent vector for ZIKV
(Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016; Grard et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012;
Wong et al., 2013), health officials must plan for the possibility of
locally acquired ZIKV infections in parts of Europe. The imminent
arrival of summer in the northern hemisphere, when Aedes mosqui-
to populations will peak and viral replication within these vectors
will be most efficient, could lead to autochthonous transmission,
not unlike the recent localized and transient European epidemics
of dengue and chikungunya (Angelini et al., 2007; Wilder-Smith et
al., 2014).
To assist public health decision-making, we (i) modeled the risks of
ZIKV importation into Europe via airline travellers departing areas in the
Americas where ZIKV activity has been confirmed or where suitable
conditions exist for its transmission year round (Bogoch et al., 2016),
(ii) used a temperature driven vectorial capacity model to quantify the
potential for European Aedes mosquitoes to support autochthonous
transmission of ZIKV, assuming that Ae. albopictus is a competent vector,
and (iii) quantified the size of populations living in European areas
where mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV may be possible at the
height of summer.
2. Materials & Methods
2.1. Overview
We developed a mathematical model that outputs basic reproduc-
tion numbers (R0) for ZIKV transmission with biological anchoring in
Aedes mosquito vectorial capacity and validation against surveillance
data from the current ZIKV outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We applied this vectorial capacity model to estimate R0 potential for
ZIKV in Europe this spring to autumn, while superimposing data on air-
line travellers arriving from areas in the Americas where ZIKV is active,
as well as populations living in areas of Europe where mosquito-borne
transmission of ZIKV is possible. Finally we discuss model assumptions
and limitations in our approach.
2.2. Model Development
R0 is used to characterize the epidemic potential of a pathogen. It
represents the expected number of new infections generated by one in-
fectious individual within a fully susceptible population. In the context
of a mosquito-borne illness, R0 is a function of vectorial capacity (VC),
and the period of viremia in humans (Th) (Anderson and R, 1991),
given mathematically by: R0 = VC × Th. Transmission increases when
R0 exceeds 1 (i.e. potential for an epidemic), and diminishes when R0
is less than 1. VC in turn is a function of vector competence (inherent
ability of the vector to transmit a particular pathogen), vector lifespan,
and the extrinsic incubation period (Lambrechts et al., 2011). Since
Aedes mosquitoes are ectotherms, VC is highly dependent upon mean

 temperature and diurnal temperature variation (Lambrechts et al.,
2011; Brady et al., 2014; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Liu-Helmersson
et al., 2016). It is given mathematically by(Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016):
VC ¼ ma2bhbme−μmn
μm
The six vector parameters in the above equation include: 1) the av-
erage vector biting rate a, 2) the probability of vector-to-human trans-
mission per bite bh, 3) the probability of human-to-vector infection
per bite, bm, 4) the duration of the extrinsic incubation period (i.e. this
represents the duration between acquisition of a pathogen by a vector
and the ability for that vector to then transmit the same pathogen to a
susceptible host), n, 5) vector mortality rate μm, and 6) the female vec-
tor-to-human population ratio, m.
Dengue virus (DENV) for example, is also transmitted by Ae. aegypti
and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, for which the aforementioned parame-
ters and their relationship to temperature has been described
(Lambrechts et al., 2011; Brady et al., 2014; Liu-Helmersson et al.,
2014; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016). This has relevance for ZIKV trans-
mission by Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, as the mortality rate, μm, and
biting rates, a, for Aedes mosquitoes are independent of whether they
carry ZIKV or DENV. Further, the competence of Aedes mosquito species
to transmit ZIKV, as described by n, bh and bm, is driven by the infection,
dissemination, and transmission rates of the virus in an infected vector,
measuring the rate of virus presence in the mosquito midgut after a
blood meal, and the time and efficiency of its replication to the
mosquito's salivary glands. Recent data suggests that Aedes mosquitoes
may have the same vectorial competence for ZIKV dissemination and
transmission rate as DENV at 29 °C (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016; Li et
al., 2012; Wong et al., 2013; Lambrechts et al., 2011; Brady et al.,
2014; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016).
However, geographical differences in vector competence may exist, as
Aedes mosquitoes from Brazil, the U.S. and Martinique have been re-
ported as being less potent in their ability to replicate ZIKV, while
Aedes mosquitoes from French Guiana and Guadeloupe appear compe-
tent and efficient (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016). The extrinsic incuba-
tion period of ZIKV (n) is not yet determined, but recent studies
estimate it to be 7 days (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016; Li et al., 2012;
Wong et al., 2013), while n for DENV is estimated to be 8–9 days at
28–29 °C (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016).
The duration of viremia for ZIKV (Th) is also currently under investi-
gation however recent evidence suggests that the virus may be detect-
able in blood for 1 to 10 days (Musso et al., 2015a; Lessler et al., 2016).
Similarly, DENV is detected in the blood for 3 to 12 days, with most in-
dividuals being viremic for about 5 days (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016).
The serial time window between pairs of infected human cases, encap-
sulating part of the period of viremia and the extrinsic and intrinsic in-
cubation periods, has been estimated to be 15 days for ZIKV and 17 days
for DENV(Majumder et al., 2016) indicating similarities between ZIKV
and DENV in real-world settings. For both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
mosquitoes, the female vector-to-human population ratio (m), is tem-
perature dependent and presumed to be similar across species. In the
absence of valid vector abundance data, as an indicator of vector popu-
lations, we used a method described in previous studies relating popu-
lation density to survival (Lambrechts et al., 2011; Brady et al., 2014;
Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016).
We developed three vectorial capacity models for Aedes mosquitoes
to transmit ZIKV and selected the model that best fit observed transmis-
sion dynamics in the Americas. Each model was developed by adapting
existing temperature-driven models for DENV transmission via Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016) while incorpo-
rating current data on ZIKV parameters. Our best fitting model was
then adapted to Europe using European climatic data to estimate R0

 potential this spring to autumn. Below we synthesize the findings de-
scribed above into three alternative models describing the vectorial ca-
pacity and basic reproduction number of ZIKV:
• Model 1: characterized by high vector competence compared with
dengue (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016) in assuming a viremic period
of 5 days.
• Model 2: similar to model 1 with alternations in bm being reduced to
76.7% and bh reduced to 21.4% of the model 1 values for Ae. aegypti
(Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016). For Ae. albopictus, model 2 is similar
to model 1 however bm are reduced to 50.0% of the model 1 value
(Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016).
• Model 3: same configuration as model 2 but with a viremic period of
10 days (Lessler et al., 2016).
The model 1–3 parameters and their relationship to temperature for
both vectors are described in the supplementary information, Figs. 7–
12.
2.3. Model Validation
We collected data on the number, location and time of confirmed
and suspected ZIKV infections across Latin America and the Caribbean
regions up until the end of March 2016 using data from national surveil-
lance systems (see Table 1). Disease data were reported for individual
countries or sub-national administrative regions. We also collected
temperature measurements from terrestrial meteorological stations
and satellite sensors reading land surface temperatures (see Table 3; ex-
tended data).
We estimated R0 values for the initial phases of the epidemic in the
Americas assuming a Poisson distribution using weekly count data
(R package version 1.2–5, 2014; Wallinga, 2007). The serial time interval
range of ZIKV infection was taken to be 10 to 23 days, with a mean of
16 days (Majumder et al., 2016). We then used a lognormal serial
time distribution function with a mean of 16 days and standard devia-
tion of 3 days covering the interval. Estimates of observed R0 values
were made at the sub-national administrative region level and aggre-
gated to national averages as described in Table 1. We selected smaller
countries and regions to better fulfill the assumption of homogeneous
mixing in the estimation of R0.
We tested and validated our three temperature-driven vectorial ca-
pacity models by comparing R0 values generated for countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean to R0 estimates derived from the same re-
gion using ZIKV surveillance data (Table 1). We used temperature
data from one month prior to and two months into the epidemic
(Table 3; extended data). R0 values were computed assuming that Ae.
aegypti or Ae. albopictus alone were the sole vector for ZIKV
transmission.
2.4. Estimating R0 in Europe
Since Model 1 best fit observed data on ZIKV transmission in the
Americas, we used it to estimate potential for mosquito-borne transmis-
sion, outputted as R0 values, across Europe in 2016. We did this by inte-
grating daily temperature observations (mean, minimum, maximum)
from the E-OBS 12.0 dataset at locations gridded at 0.25 × 0.25°
(approximately 25 × 25 km at the equator) latitude and longitude
(Haylock et al., 2008) for the period between January 1st 2006
to December 31st 2015. Daily R0 estimates required interpolating
diurnal temperature values from daily temperature observations.
We estimated R0 values for Europe for geographic areas where
Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus mosquito populations have been reported
by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in
2016
(http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/vectors/vector-maps/
Pages/VBORNET_maps.aspx, n.d.). Maps were presented for each
month from May to October after averaging daily R0 observations.
Model outputs were classified into R0 zones for ease of interpretation
(b0.5, 0.5–0.99, 1–1.99, 2–2.99, and 3–4).
2.5. Airline Travellers into Europe from the Americas
To estimate the potential for travellers infected with ZIKV arriving
into European cities from the Americas, we analyzed worldwide airline
ticket sales data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
This dataset includes anonymized, full-route, flight itinerary data on an
estimated 90% of all passenger trips on commercial flights worldwide,
while the remainder is modeled using airline market intelligence.
Each flight itinerary includes information on passengers' initial point
of embarkation, final destination, and where applicable, connecting
flights.
To select commercial airports in the Americas where departing trav-
ellers might be infected with ZIKV, we assumed that ZIKV would be ac-
tive in all countries in the Americas except Canada and Chile by the
summer of 2016. Subsequently, we narrowed this list of countries to
those that have experienced significant transmission of chikungunya
virus since the onset of the 2013 outbreak in the Americas (Musso et
al., 2015b). In this step, we excluded the United States as it has only ex-
perienced limited autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus in
Florida. Conversely, we included Argentina because it is currently
experiencing a DENV epidemic (Gil et al., 2016). Within each country
in our remaining list, we identified subnational areas with potential
for year-round ZIKV transmission by either Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus
based upon an ecological suitability analysis (Bogoch et al., 2016). We
then created a 50 km buffer zone around these areas to accommodate
for the potential movements of individuals travelling by land from
areas of ZIKV activity to neighboring commercial airports, where travel-
lers could embark upon international trips. After selecting our final list
of commercial airports in the Americas, we quantified and mapped
the monthly final European destinations of all travellers departing
these airports between May and October 2015.
2.6. Populations at Risk for Locally Acquired Infection
To estimate the size of populations living in areas at risk for mosqui-
to-borne ZIKV transmission, we extracted population data from
LandScan 2014, a satellite-based dataset of ambient population density
worldwide in 1-km2 grids (Dobson et al., 2000). To link our vectorial ca-
pacity model data with LandScan population density data, our R0 map
(at 25-km2 resolution) was resampled to 1-km2 pixels using a
nearest-neighbor sampling algorithm. Population estimates were then
extracted for each R0 zone for each country across Europe in the
month of August, when vectorial capacity was at its peak.
3. Results
3.1. Travellers Arriving to Europe from the Americas
In continental Europe, the leading final destinations of airline travel-
lers departing areas in the Americas with known ZIKV activity or suit-
able conditions for year-round autochthonous transmission, from May
to October 2015 were i) Paris (~120,000 to 200,000 travellers peaking
in July and August), ii) London (~100,000 to 130,000 travellers peaking
in August), iii) Madrid (~75,000 to 125,000 travellers peaking in July),
iv) Amsterdam (~50,000 to 70,000 travellers peaking in August), v)
Frankfurt (~40,000 travellers with no clear peak), vi) Milan (~25,000
to 40,000 travellers peaking in August), vii) Lisbon (~20,000 to 40,000
travellers peaking in July), viii) Barcelona (~25,000 to 35,000 travellers
peaking in September and October), and ix) Rome (~20,000 to 35,000
travellers peaking in August; see Fig. 1). Outside of continental Europe,
Madeira, Portugal (where Ae. aegypti is established) receives ~500 to
2500 monthly travellers with peak flows in July.

 3.2. Basic Reproductive Number for Zika virus in Europe
Based on temperature inputs, our vectorial capacity model predicted
a basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.9 (assuming transmission by Ae.
aegypti), and 3.4 (assuming transmission by Ae. albopictus) for the cur-
rent ZIKV epidemic in the Americas. We compared these R0 estimates
with those derived using ZIKV surveillance data in the Americas and
found agreement between our predictions and observations as summa-
rized in Table 1. Adapting our vectorial capacity model to Europe using
empirical temperature data from 2006–2015, we estimated R0 values
for Ae. albopictus across southern Europe from France and Spain in
the west to southwestern Russia in the east (see Fig. 1; higher
resolution monthly maps are supplied in the supplementary informa-
tion, Figs. 1–6). Most of the potential for autochthonous transmission
was centered on Italy, southeastern France including the island of Corsi-
ca, the southern and eastern coasts of Spain, and western regions of the
Balkans from Slovenia and Croatia in the north, to Albania and Greece in
the south. While predicted R0 values begin to exceed 1 (i.e. indicating
epidemic potential) across areas of southern Europe in June, they in-
crease in July (R0 values of 2–3) and peak in August (R0 values of 3–4)
before falling again in September (R0 values of 1–2) and October (R0
falls below 1). For the sub-tropical island of Madeira in Portugal, R0
values for the vector Ae. aegypti, were estimated to exceed 2 from July
through October (see Fig. 2).
3.3. Populations at Risk in Europe
Of the total population residing within the geographic range of our
analysis (i.e. 779 million people), we find that in the month of August
(i.e. when temperatures and vectorial capacity in Europe are peaking),
approximately 47% of people (i.e. 366 million) reside in areas with no
known occurrences of Ae. albopictus, 35% (i.e. 272 million) in areas
where data on Aedes mosquito occurrences are absent, 11% (i.e. 83 mil-
lion) in areas where R0 estimates from our model exceed 1, 4% (i.e. 31
million) in areas where R0 estimates are less than 1 (i.e. low risk for spo-
radic transmission), and 3% (i.e. 27 million) in areas where our model
lacked data to estimate R0.
Countries with a large proportion of their population residing in
areas where our R0 estimates exceeded 1 in August included: Albania
(83%), Croatia (44%), France (20%), Greece (25%), Italy (78%), Montene-
gro (39%), Slovenia (28%), and Spain (19%). Population sizes in these
areas were largest for Italy (45 million people), France (12 million),
and Spain (8 million). For Greece and Spain, more than half of their pop-
ulations resided in areas with either no Aedes mosquito surveillance
data or no data outputs from our model. The geographic extents of Ae.
albopictus mosquitoes overlaid with our model's R0 outputs are shown
in Fig. 1, while actual values of populations affected are found in Table
2 (extended data).
4. Discussion
Our analysis indicates that the peak flow of travellers departing
areas in the Americas where they might be exposed to ZIKV (and who
have final destinations in Europe) coincides with the peak in vectorial
capacity for ZIKV transmission in Europe (i.e. in July and August).
These intersections in risk are most apparent within or adjacent to sev-
eral major cities such as Barcelona, Milan and Rome.
Since Ae. albopictus mosquitoes might prove to be competent vectors
for ZIKV (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016; Grard et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012;
Wong et al., 2013), the public, healthcare providers and public health of-
ficials across Europe could use these findings to identify regions at
greatest risk for the importation of ZIKV, and its potential transmission
within ecologically suitable areas. Although the volume of travellers ar-
riving from the Americas to Madeira, Portugal is substantially lower
compared to other major cities in continental Europe, the known occur-
rence of Ae. aegypti, a longer season with high vectorial capacity, the
explosive epidemic of dengue fever in 2012 (Wilder-Smith et al.,
2014), and the recent Zika epidemic in nearby Cape Verde (Attar,
2016), collectively highlight the potential for autochthonous transmis-
sion of ZIKV on this sub-tropical island.
Our analysis highlights necessary, but not always sufficient condi-
tions for autochthonous transmission of ZIKV. While the introduction
of ZIKV into Europe, the presence of competent mosquito vectors, and
suitable climatic conditions are all prerequisites for local mosquito-
borne transmission, a multitude of other factors, including but not lim-
ited to, population density, housing conditions, and socioeconomic fac-
tors, could influence the likelihood of observing ZIKV epidemics, as seen
with other arbovirus infections such as dengue (Clark, 2008; Reiter et
al., 2003).
Our model is founded on a number of assumptions, most notably
that continental European strains of Ae. albopictus possess competence
for the transmission of ZIKV. While there is growing evidence to suggest
that Ae. albopictus can become infected with ZIKV under experimental
conditions (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016; Li et al., 2012), empirical
data on its role as a vector in nature exist (Grard et al., 2014), but are
limited. Recent evidence from the Americas also suggests that Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus may be less competent vectors than anticipat-
ed (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016), and that other factors such as popula-
tion density, immunologically naïve populations, additional modes of
transmission (e.g. sexual (Oster et al., 2016; Foy et al., 2011)), and pos-
sibly even other mosquito species might play a role in this epidemic
(Ayres, 2016). A key strength of our study is that our model's R0 outputs
were comparable to estimates we derived using ZIKV surveillance data
from the ongoing epidemic in the Americas. However, we assumed that
our model, validated against ZIKV data from the Americas where Ae.
aegypti is thought to be the primary driver for transmission, would be
transferrable to a European setting where Ae. albopictus is the dominant
vector.
Cities across Europe are already experiencing an increase in ZIKV im-
portations via travellers from the Americas (Maria et al., 2016;
Zammarchi et al., 2015). Two recent studies assessed the risk of trans-
mission of ZIKV in Europe reaching contrasting conclusions (Guzzetta
et al., 2016; WHO, 2016). One of the studies finds minimal risk based
on an assumed low vectorial capacity of European Ae. albopictus
(Guzzetta et al., 2016), while the other study, aligning climatic suitabil-
ity of vectors and coarse patterns in air traffic, estimate and identify Eu-
ropean countries at high risk for Zika transmission (WHO, 2016). Our
study increases output resolution through our transmission model and
passenger-level air travel data, while drawing from epidemiological
data from the current outbreak in the Americas. We conclude, that
while there remains uncertainty about the capacity for Ae. albopictus
to transmit ZIKV in nature, European health officials must consider the
possibility of mosquito-borne transmission within Europe during
warmer periods of the year. With the imminent arrival of summer,
our findings could help guide the efficient use of finite resources for
human disease surveillance, vector surveillance and control, and public
education following guidelines from the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control, 2016), for vector and non-vector borne modes of ZIKV trans-
mission. Furthermore, our travel analysis can help target efforts to edu-
cate the public and healthcare providers alike about the potential for
Zika virus transmission via travellers returning from Zika affected
areas in the Americas to their sexual partners living in Europe (Oster
et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2016b).
4.1. Assumptions and Limitations
The overall range and average values of the basic reproduction num-
ber for ZIKV estimated in our study for Latin America and the Caribbean
is supported by several recent studies indicating similarities to dengue
(Funk et al., 2016; Kucharski et al., 2016) at least for transmission via
Ae. aegypti. Data on the competence of Ae. albopictus as a vector to
254
J. Rocklöv et al. / EBioMedicine 9 (2016) 250–256
 transmit ZIKV in natural settings are limited. While recent experimental
studies have indicated that North American Ae. albopictus strains may
not be highly competent (Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016), others support
a higher vector competence (Li et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2013), including
one study where Ae. albopictus appears to have been the principal vector
in an urban ZIKV outbreak in Gabon (Grard et al., 2014). In this analysis,
we assumed that Ae. albopictus would be capable of transmitting ZIKV in
continental Europe. New experimental results indicate European Ae.
albopictus mosquitoes may exhibit lower competence to transmit ZIKV
(Di Luca et al., 2016; Jupille et al., 2016) contrasting to African (Grard
et al., 2014) and Asian (Wong et al., 2013) varieties. However, more ev-
idence is needed to fully understand vector competence in Europe.
We also assumed that DENV and ZIKV have similar temperature de-
pendencies in relation to vector competence. While the similarities be-
tween our model's R0 outputs for ZIKV and R0 estimates derived from
the current ZIKV epidemic in the Americas supports this assumption,
we recognize that other factors, related to human behavior, socioeco-
nomic, and environmental factors may create differential vector-to-
human contacts rates between Europe and Latin America. These differ-
ences could contribute to different transmission dynamics not
accounted for in our predictive models. For example, during a recent
DENV outbreak along the Texas-Mexico border, non-climatic factors
significantly influenced transmission dynamics (Clark, 2008; Reiter et
al., 2003). The observed transmission of chikungunya and dengue in Eu-
rope, however, support that European vectors and environment are ca-
pable of supporting local transmission (Angelini et al., 2007;
Wilder-Smith et al., 2014). We further note that vector populations, as
measured by ovitraps, indicate high abundance in Europe (Bellini et
al., 1996), and further, that human population densities are higher in
some European areas compared with areas in Latin America with persis-
tent transmission (http://www.worldpop.org.uk/). In relation to Europe-
an vector populations it is important to note that the vector surveillance
is limited in some European regions, with no reported surveillance data.
Thus, our estimates of the geographic range of European areas potential
suitable for ZIKV transmission are conservative (Kraemer et al., 2015).
Due to a lack of detailed parameterization data, we did not con-
sider the effects of wind, humidity and precipitation in our model.
The impact of precipitation, interacting with human behavior (e.g.
storing of water and irrigation), appear unrelated to fluctuations in
vector abundance in Thailand (Lambrechts et al., 2011). Tran et al.
modeled Ae. albopictus abundance in Europe and demonstrated
that cycles were highly seasonal and related to vector lifespan
(Tran et al., 2013). While we were unable to include vector abun-
dance data in our models, we created a proxy for abundance derived
from a temperature-dependent mosquito survival function (Brady et
al., 2014; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2016). We also note that populations
of Aedes mosquitoes in the Netherlands have not established outside
greenhouses, suggesting that they are tropical strains not adapted to
temperate climates.
Although DENV and chikungunya viruses may offer certain in-
sights into the unknowns of ZIKV spread and control (Musso et al.,
2015b), differences between ZIKV, DENV and chikungunya vector-
virus interactions and transmission routes cannot be ignored
(Christofferson, 2016), In addition to mosquito-borne transmission,
other modes of spread including via sexual contact (Oster et al.,
2016) were not accounted for in this analysis. Current data suggest
that ZIKV can be found in semen, and hence could potentially be
transmitted for months post-infection (Mansuy et al., 2016).
The 2015 IATA data used in this analysis is the most current avail-
able to quantify the flow of travellers from the Americas to Europe
across this spring to autumn. Although the ZIKV epidemic may de-
crease traveller flows to and from affected countries, we assumed
that the seasonal patterns and proportions of travellers arriving to
various European cities would be preserved relative to 2015. Anoth-
er consideration not accounted for in our analysis is the potential im-
pact of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio in August on travel
patterns between Brazil and Europe. However, the local transmission
of Zika during the Olympics might decrease due to seasonal trans-
mission changes (Funk et al., 2016; Kucharski et al., 2016).
Our weather driven models use averaged monthly temperature
values over the most recent 10-year period (i.e. 2006–2015). However,
2016 weather patterns may vary under the influence of El Nino this
year, which in turn, might increase or decrease vectorial capacity.
Finally, stochasticity plays a key role in the appearance of any epi-
demic. In this analysis, we present conditions that are necessary, but
alone may be insufficient for the emergence of an epidemic. Hence
our analysis assesses the potential for ZIKV transmission within Europe,
not the probability of ZIKV epidemics. The purpose of this analysis is to
highlight geographies and times where epidemic potential is greatest as
a way to help guide public health resources to prepare for, and if re-
quired, mobilize an appropriate response to mosquito-borne ZIKV
transmission in Europe later this year, in accordance with guidelines de-
veloped by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2016).
