In Brief
The TCR can adopt an inactive, resting or
an active, primed state. Schamel and
colleagues show that the TCR is in
equilibrium between these states.
Peptide-MHC binding stabilizes the
primed state that can be phosphorylated.
Cholesterol binding stabilizes the resting
state and thereby tunes the TCR
activation threshold.

SUMMARY
Signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR) controls
adaptive immune responses. Antigen binding to
TCRab transmits signals through the plasma mem-
brane to induce phosphorylation of the CD3 cyto-
plasmic tails by incompletely understood mecha-
nisms. Here we show that cholesterol bound to the
TCRb transmembrane region keeps the TCR in a
resting, inactive conformation that cannot be phos-
phorylated by active kinases. Only TCRs that sponta-
neously detached from cholesterol could switch to
the active conformation (termed primed TCRs) and
then be phosphorylated. Indeed, by modulating
cholesterol binding genetically or enzymatically, we
could switch the TCR between the resting and primed
states. The active conformation was stabilized by
binding to peptide-MHC, which thus controlled TCR
signaling. These data are explained by a model of
reciprocal allosteric regulation of TCR phosphoryla-
tion by cholesterol and ligand binding. Our results
provide both a molecular mechanism and a concep-
tual framework for how lipid-receptor interactions
regulate signal transduction.
INTRODUCTION
Membrane lipids are thought to play a passive role in the function
of transmembrane (TM) proteins by embedding and organizing
them into lipid microdomains (Coskun and Simons, 2011). In a
few cases it has been shown that TM regions and certain lipids
interact in a specific manner (Cherezov et al., 2007; Contreras
et al., 2012; Coskun and Simons, 2011; Hanson et al., 2008)
with mostly unknown functional implications. We have previ-
ously found that the T cell receptor (TCR) specifically binds to
cholesterol in resting T cells to aid formation of TCR nanoclusters
(Molnar et al., 2012). Here, we investigated whether this binding
also regulated TCR signaling.
The TCR consists of eight TM proteins organized in dimers:
TCRab, CD3εg, CD3εd, and CD3zz. TCRab binds to peptides
presented on major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) mole-
cules (Davis et al., 1998). The information provided through
pMHC binding is transferred to the CD3 subunits, which are sub-
sequently phosphorylated on immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motifs (ITAMs) by the SRC-family tyrosine kinase
LCK (Iwashima et al., 1994). Phospho-CD3s serve as docking
sites for the kinase ZAP70, which becomes active at the TCR
and transmits downstream signals.
The mechanism of signal transduction from the extracellular
domains of TCRab through the membrane, resulting in phos-
phorylation of the CD3 cytoplasmic tails, is poorly understood
(Davis and van der Merwe, 2006). Any mechanistic model needs
to take into account that in resting T cells a large proportion of
LCK is active (Nika et al., 2010), yet CD3s are not phosphory-
lated. Accordingly, several models, including spatial segregation
of phosphatases and sequestration of the CD3 chains, have
been proposed (Kuhns and Davis, 2012; Shi et al., 2013; van
der Merwe and Dushek, 2011; Xu et al., 2008).
Using protease resistance, fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET), and biochemical approaches, researchers have
shown that the quaternary structure of the TCR changes upon
ligandbinding andthat this alterationresults ina reversible confor-
mational change in the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits (Gil
et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2015; Risueno et al., 2005; Risueno et al.,
2008). These studies have led to the permissive-geometry model
of TCR activation (Minguet and Schamel, 2008; Minguet et al.,
2007). One hallmark of this structural change is the regulation of
the accessibility of a proline-rich sequence (PRS) in the CD3ε
cytosolic tail. In the non-ligand-bound TCR, the PRS cannot

1091
 bind to the SH3.1 domain of the adaptor protein NCK; this TCR
conformation is referred to as resting (TCRr). By contrast, in the
ligand-bound TCR, the PRS can bind to SH3.1. TCRs in this active
conformation are referred to as primed TCRs (TCRp). The switch
from TCRr to TCRp is required for T cell activation. This has
been demonstrated by synthetic ligands that only evoke CD3
phosphorylation when the TCRp form is stabilized (Minguet
et al., 2007) and by the observation that point mutations (such
as K76T and C80G) in the extracellular stalk region of CD3ε
prevent the TCRr from switching to TCRp and abrogate CD3
phosphorylation (Blanco et al., 2014; Martinez-Martin et al., 2009).
Here, we provide mechanistic and quantitative insight into
how pMHC binding results in the phosphorylation of the TCR.
We present biochemical, genetic, and functional evidence that
cholesterol and ligands regulate the allosteric transitions of
the TCR: in the resting state cholesterol binding stabilizes
TCRr, ligand binding stabilizes TCRp, and only TCRp can be
phosphorylated.
RESULTS
Cholesterol Binds to TCRb Only in the Resting,
Inactive TCR
Cholesterol specifically binds to TCRb (Molnar et al., 2012). We
asked whether this binding changes when the conformation
switches from TCRr to TCRp in living cells. Therefore, we grew
Jurkat T cells in the presence of a radioactive cholesterol analog
with a UV-inducible cross-linker group (photocholesterol) (Thiele
et al., 2000). We left the cells unstimulated or stimulated with
anti-CD3ε antibodies for different times before exposing them
to UV light (Figure 1A). Subsequently, we isolated surface
TCRs to detect the radioactive cholesterol signals by SDS-
PAGE and autoradiography (Figure 1B). Anti-CD3 immunoblot-
ting (IB) served as a loading control. Binding of cholesterol to
TCRb was reduced by more than 50% upon antibody binding
to the TCR. Alternative experimental settings corroborated this
finding (Figures S1A and S1B). In parallel, we performed an
SH3 pull-down assay with the SH3.1 domain of NCK (Gil et al.,
2002) to quantify the amount of TCRp (Figure 1C and Figure S1C).
The reduction of cholesterol binding occurred concomitantly
with the switch to TCRp and might have preceded phosphoryla-
tion of CD3z (Figure 1C). In a control experiment, UV irradiation
alone had no effect on the TCRr-TCRp equilibrium (Figure S1D).
Thus, in living cells cholesterol preferentially binds to TCRr.
To determine whether the inability of TCRp to bind cholesterol
is an intrinsic property of the TCR, we used a cholesterol pull-
down assay (Beck-Garcia et al., 2013) (Figure 2A). Cholesterol
binding was indeed reduced when TCRp accumulated as a result
of anti-CD3ε or anti-TCRb binding and was independent of phos-
phorylation, as evidenced by the fact that it also occurred at 0�C
and in the presence of the SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 (Figure 2B).
BUB3, which also binds to the lipid beads (Beck-Garcia et al.,
2013), served as a loading control. This reduction was also
seen in primary human T cells (Figure 2C). In contrast to choles-
terol beads, TCR binding to stearate or palmitate beads was
independent of the TCR conformational state (Figure 2D and
Figure S1). Thus, the conformational state of the TCR specif-
ically correlates with cholesterol binding (Figure 2D).
Using a CD3ε with a mutation (K76T) in its extracellular stalk
region, which favors the resting conformation (Martinez-Martin
et al., 2009), we confirmed that TCRr, but not TCRp, binds to
cholesterol (Figure S1H–S1J).
Cholesterol Binding Keeps the TCR in the Non-
phosphorylatable State
To construct a TCRb chain that cannot bind cholesterol, we took
advantage of our finding that the gd TCR does not bind cholesterol
(Figure S2A). Because cholesterol might bind to the TCRb TM
region, we constructed a single-chain Fv-fragment-tagged TCRb
chain (scTCRb) (Gil et al., 2002) mutant, in which we replaced the
TM region with the TM from the TCRg2 chain (TMchim, Figure 3A
and Figures S2B and S2C). The TMchim TCR was expressed on

(A) Cholesterol only binds to TCRs in the resting conformation (TCRr, upper panel). TCRs in the active conformation (primed TCRs, TCRp) accumulate when bound
to ligands and do not bind cholesterol (lower panel). Radioactive photocholesterol can be covalently cross-linked to TCRb upon exposure to UV light.
(B) Jurkat cells were grown with photocholesterol, and were either UV irradiated and then stimulated with anti-CD3ε (OKT3) for the indicated times at 37�C (-) or
stimulated first and then UV irradiated (+). Protein G beads were added to the lysate so that antibody-bound TCRs could be captured. Purified proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and IB was performed. One representative experiment from four is shown. For quantification, the intensity of the
radioactive band corresponding to cholesterol-bound TCRb was divided by the intensity of the anti-CD3z IB, and the different time points were pooled (n = 6).

representative blot from three is shown (n = 3). SH3-GST served as a loading control. The intensity of CD3z in the SH3 pull-down assay was normalized to the
SH3-GST signal in the pull down pooled from different time points (n = 4, p < 0.05 by two-sided one-sample t test). Error bars represent SEM.

 the surface of TCRb-negative Jurkat cells in the same amounts as
the WT TCR (Figure S2D). Native gel and epitope-accessibility an-
alyses suggested that the TMchim TCR assembled in the same
stoichiometry and in a similar structure as the WT TCR (Figures
S2E and S2F). However, the resting TMchim TCR bound more
weakly to cholesterol than did the resting WT TCRs (Figure 3B),
indicating that indeed the TCRb TM region binds cholesterol.
The residual binding of the TMchim TCR to the cholesterol beads
was not further decreased by antibody stimulation and was similar
to the cholesterol binding of the antibody-stimulated WT TCR (Fig-
ure 3B). This suggested that the TMchim TCR does not bind to
cholesterol. As a control, TMchim and WT TCRs bound equally
well to palmitate-coupled beads (Figure S2G).
Importantly, reduced cholesterol binding to the TMchim TCR
promoted the active conformation, as evidenced by increased
binding in the SH3-PD assay in both resting and anti-CD3ε-stim-
ulated conditions (Figure 3C). Increased amounts of TCRp re-
sulted in enhanced basal and antibody-induced phosphorylation
of CD3 (Figure 3D). This increase in CD3 phosphorylation was
physiologically relevant because we also detected enhanced
ERK phosphorylation and upregulation of the activation marker
CD69 in the resting and antibody-stimulated situations (Figure 3E
and Figure S2H). In conclusion, genetically ablating the choles-
terol-binding region in the TCR increased the frequency of
primed TCRs, indicating that cholesterol binding regulates the
TCRr-TCRp equilibrium.
Cholesterol Removal Causes TCRs to Switch to the
Active Conformation
Next, we tested whether cholesterol stabilizes the resting, inac-
tive state in native, WT TCRs (Figure 4A). Reduction of cell-
membrane cholesterol amounts by treatment with cholesterol
oxidase, which converts cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one
(Gimpl and Gehrig-Burger, 2007), led to a 2-fold increase in
the proportion of TCRp (Figure 4B). Moreover, lowering choles-
terol enhanced basal CD3z and ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4B
and 4C) as well as CD69 upregulation (Figure S3A) in Jurkat
cells. Enhanced ERK phosphorylation upon cholesterol reduc-
tion was also seen in primary human T cells (Figure 4D).
Cholesterol oxidase treatment neither led to decreased cell
viability (Figure S3B) nor rendered the cells unresponsive
to anti-CD3 stimuli (data not shown). Switching to TCRp
and increased CD3z phosphorylation also occurred after we
extracted cholesterol by using methyl-b-cyclodextrin (mbCD,
Figure S3C).
The induction of signaling by cholesterol removal via mbCD is
in line with the literature (Kabouridis et al., 2000; Rouquette-Jaz-
danian et al., 2006) and could be due either to the accumulation
of TCRp or to other effects of cholesterol reduction, such as
altered membrane microdomain organization (Horejsi, 2003).
To test whether the stimulating effect of cholesterol is TCR
dependent, we used TCR-negative Jurkat cells. Cholesterol ox-
idase treatment did not lead to increased ERK phosphorylation
in cells lacking a TCR (Figure 4E). Hence, enhanced signaling
upon cholesterol extraction was TCR dependent and thus was
most likely caused by the accumulation of TCRp. Consistent
with this conclusion, we found that in cells expressing the
TMchim TCR, which does not bind cholesterol, cholesterol
oxidation did not further increase the amount of TCRp or ERK
phosphorylation (Figure S3D). Together, these data suggest
that cholesterol binding to the TCR keeps the TCR in the TCRr
state to prevent spontaneous signaling.

ments assaying TCR binding to lipid and of three to six experiments assaying the TCR conformational state were pooled. p value indicates whether the slope (b)
calculated through linear regression is significantly non-zero.

 Cholesterol Detachment and Switching to Primed TCRs
Favor CD3 Phosphorylation
To confirm a gatekeeper function of cholesterol, we investigated
whether cholesterol removal from the TCR is required for CD3
phosphorylation. We grew Jurkat cells in radioactive photocho-
lesterol as before. Using UV light, we covalently linked choles-
terol to the TCRs and hypothesized that cholesterol-linked
TCRs would not be able to spontaneously switch to the TCRp
form and therefore would not become phosphorylated. To
best detect CD3 phosphorylation, we used the phosphatase
inhibitor pervanadate, which prevents removal of phosphate
groups from CD3 and thus allows phosphorylated TCRs to
accumulate; of note, pervanadate does not itself affect the
TCR’s conformational state (Gil et al., 2002; O’Shea et al.,
1992). First, we cross-linked radioactive cholesterol to the
TCRs and then treated the cells with pervanadate (Figures 5A
and 5B, lane 1). After lysis, phosphorylated proteins were puri-
fied. The autoradiography shows that cholesterol-linked TCRs
were not phosphorylated (lane 1). Because of the low amount
of radioactive cholesterol, most TCRs were bound to endoge-
nous unmodified cholesterol (Figure 5A, lower panel), and those
TCRs were phosphorylated, as demonstrated by IB (Figure 5B,
lane 1). This indicated that the cholesterol-linked TCRs were
locked in a non-phosphorylatable state and that cholesterol
needs to dissociate from the TCR before the TCR can be
phosphorylated.
In contrast, when we first treated the cells with pervanadate to
phosphorylate the TCRs and then exposed them to UV light
(Figure 5A and 5B, lane 2), we detected radioactive and phos-
phorylated TCRs. This served as a control for cross-linking of
radioactive cholesterol to TCRb and indicated that phosphory-
lated TCRs can switch back to the TCRr state and then bind to
cholesterol again. Indeed, phosphorylated TCRs could switch
to TCRr, and bind to cholesterol-coupled beads (Figure 5C).
UV light illumination alone did not alter the phosphorylation of
the TCR (Figure S4A). In conclusion, cholesterol-bound TCRs
cannot be phosphorylated in living cells, confirming that only
those TCRs that are not bound to cholesterol are capable of
switching to TCRp in order to be phosphorylated.
TCRs can spontaneously switch to TCRp (de la Cruz et al.,
2011; Mingueneau et al., 2008), and Figure 5B suggests that
only TCRp can be phosphorylated (Figure 5D, upper panel). To
test whether the switch to TCRp is required for phosphorylation,
we used the K76T CD3ε mutant, whose capacity to switch to the
TCRp conformation is reduced (Martinez-Martin et al., 2009) (Fig-
ure 5D, lower panel). The murine WT and K76T CD3ε-expressing
Jurkat cells were treated with pervanadate and lysed, and the
TCR was immuno-precipitated (Figure 5E). We used twice the
amount of K76T CD3ε-expressing cells for the immuno-pre-
cipitation (IP) to compensate for reduced amounts of TCR
expression (Figure S1H). Indeed, similar amounts of TCRs
were separated by SDS-PAGE (Figure 5E, lowest panel), but a
smaller fraction of CD3z and CD3ε were phosphorylated in the
K76T mutant (mainly TCRr) than in the WT TCR (spontaneously
switching to TCRp). Likewise, ZAP70 was more readily recruited
to, and phosphorylated at, the WT TCR (Figure 5E and Fig-
ure S4B). In addition, the upregulation of CD69 was impaired in
the K76T CD3ε-containing TCR versus the WT TCR when they
were stimulated with anti-CD3 (Figure S4C).
Further, to compare cells with equal surface TCR expression,
we used flow cytometry. We stimulated WT and K76T CD3ε-ex-
pressing Jurkat cells with pervanadate and stained them for flow
cytometry against mouse CD3ε, phospho-ZAP70 and phospho-
ERK. Cells expressing equal levels of mouse CD3 were gated.
Again, phosphorylation of ZAP70 and ERK was reduced when
the K76T CD3ε-containing TCR was stimulated (Figures S4D,
S4E, and S4F).
We thus conclude that CD3 phosphorylation by a ligand-inde-
pendent stimulus requires that the TCRs spontaneously adopt
the active conformation.
LCK Can Only Phosphorylate Primed TCRs
To characterize the mechanism that allows primed TCRs, but not
resting TCRs, to be phosphorylated, we used a synthetic system

Cholesterol Binding Switches to the Active
Conformation
(A) WT TCRs bind cholesterol via the TCRb TM re-
gion. The TMchim TCR is composed of the ecto-
domains of TCRb and the TM region of TCRg2
(orange) and does not bind cholesterol.
(B) WT and TMchim scTCR-expressing cells were
left untreated or were stimulated with anti-CD3ε
(OKT3) for 5 min, and the cholesterol pull-down

the band intensities of phospho-z/ε (n = 4–9) and
phospho-ε/ε (n = 4–11) obtained from the TMchim
TCR were normalized to the corresponding ratio
obtained from the WT TCR, ***p < 0.001 by two-
sided one-sample t test. Error bars represent SEM.

 in which we purified the WT scTCR (Gil et al., 2002) by using
nitro-phenol-coupled beads without altering the TCR’s confor-
mational state. We then left the sample untreated (Figure 6A,
TCRr) or added anti-TCR antibodies that mimic ligand binding
and stabilize TCRp (Minguet et al., 2007). The system was sup-
plemented with recombinant active LCK, and for the in vitro
kinase assay, the TCRs were immobilized on the beads. In the
untreated sample, hardly any CD3z phosphorylation was de-
tected (Figure 6B), suggesting that the CD3 tails were protected
in the TCRr conformation. Strikingly, CD3z, CD3ε, and CD3d (Fig-
ures 6B and 6C and Figure S5A) were strongly phosphorylated
when TCRp was stabilized by antibody binding. Furthermore,
the amount of TCRp (Figure 6B, lower panel) correlated with
the amount of TCRs that were phosphorylated (upper panel)
and with the intensity of downstream signaling (Figure S5B).
Likewise, recombinant LCK could only phosphorylate mem-
brane-embedded TCRs when anti-CD3ε antibodies (Figure S5C)
or pMHC tetramers stabilized TCRp (Figure 6D). Importantly,
LCK autophosphorylation and LAT phosphorylation by LCK
were detected independently of the TCR’s conformational state,
demonstrating that (1) LCK was active under all conditions and
(2) the TCR conformation specifically regulated the accessibility
of the TCR cytoplasmic tails for phosphorylation (Figure 6B and
Figure S5C). Given that the recombinant LCK did not contain any
fatty acid modifications, differential TCRp versus TCRr phos-
phorylation cannot be caused by differential interaction of LCK
with the detergent micelle. Addition of cholesterol to our recon-
stitution system reduced both the spontaneous and antibody-
stabilized accessibility of the CD3ε’s PRS (TCRp) and the amount
of CD3 phosphorylation (Figures S5D and S5E). In conclusion, an
active kinase can phosphorylate CD3 only when the TCR is in the
active, primed conformation.
An Allostery Model for the Regulation of TCR Activity
On the basis of our understanding of the initial steps of TCR trig-
gering, we propose a quantitative model that describes how
cholesterol and pMHC control the conformational equilibrium
between the TCRr and TCRp states (Figure 7A). This mathemat-
ical model provides a mechanistic basis for our experimental
observations and is based on five premises. (1) The TCR is in
conformational equilibrium; the equilibrium constant is L =
[TCRr]/[TCRp]. Thus, the TCR can switch spontaneously to the
active conformation (TCRp) in the absence of ligand, as sug-
gested experimentally (de la Cruz et al., 2011; Mingueneau
et al., 2008) (Figures 3 and 4). (2) The conformational switch is
reversible in that TCRps can revert to TCRrs (Minguet et al.,

(B) Jurkat cells were left untreated or incubated with cholesterol oxidase for 1 hr. After lysis, an SH3 pull-down assay and anti-CD3ε IP were performed. Purified
proteins and the lysate were analyzed by IB. The band intensities from four experiments were quantified and normalized to the non-treated cells (TCRp: z [SH3 pull
down)/SH3-GST/z [IP]; phospho-ERK: phoshpo-ERK [lysate]/z [lysate]); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by two-sided one-sample t test.

 2007). (3) Cholesterol binds to TCRr, but not to TCRp, with the
affinity constant Kc, thus stabilizing TCRr (Figures 1 and 2).
This is consistent with our finding that the conformational equilib-
rium of a mutant TCR that cannot bind cholesterol is shifted
toward TCRp (Figure 3). (4) Only TCRp can be phosphorylated,
suggested by the results of our in vitro kinase assay (Figure 6)
and our findings that switching to TCRp through reduced choles-
terol binding results in spontaneous signaling (Figures 3 and 4).
(5) Binding of at least dimeric soluble pMHC stabilizes TCRp,
whereas monovalent soluble pMHC can bind to both TCRp
and TCRr as suggested earlier (Minguet et al., 2007). On the ba-
sis of previous findings, we consider a preformed nanocluster of
two TCRs (Schamel et al., 2005) and assume that conformational
transitions in a TCR cluster are concerted (Martinez-Martin et al.,
2009). The affinity constants for monovalent and bivalent
pMHC binding are denoted by Ka and Kb, respectively. Assuming
nanoclustering of the TCRs is not necessary; the behavior of
the model is similar when single TCRs are clustered by being
bound bi- or multivalently to pMHC (Figure S7).
To estimate the parameters of the model from the experi-
mental data, we calculated the frequencies of TCRp, TCRr, and
their ligand-bound states in equilibrium as a function of Ka, Kb,
Kc, L, and the concentrations of membrane cholesterol and
pMHC (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Quantifying
the fraction of TMchim TCR in the active conformation in unsti-
mulated cells, which cannot bind cholesterol, we found L = 14
(Figure S6A). Thus, even in the absence of cholesterol the TCR
has a strong propensity to be in the resting state (7% of TMchim
TCRs are spontaneously switched to TCRps). Cholesterol bind-
ing further lowers the TCRp fraction by factor 4 (only 2% of
WT TCRs are spontaneously switched to TCRps); this yields
Kc 3 [cholesterol] = 1.0 (Figure S6A). Thus, cholesterol strongly
augments the intrinsic propensity of the TCR to be inactive.
With an approximate cholesterol concentration in the plasma
membrane of 1 cholesterol molecule/nm2 (Falck et al., 2004),
we obtain Kc = 106 m2/mol for the cholesterol-TCRr affinity (Fig-
ure S6B). Having fixed the parameters that define the resting
state of the TCR, we tested the ability of the model to describe
TCR activation. Stimulation of WT T cells with anti-CD3 experi-
mentally increased the fraction of TCRp from 2% to 16% (Fig-
ure S6A). Fitting the model to these numbers predicted a TCRp
fraction of 43% for the non-cholesterol binding TMchim TCR
after the same anti-CD3 stimulus. We experimentally confirmed
this prediction (40 ± 4%, Figure 7B). Taken together, these data
show that this allosteric model quantitatively describes the
resting-active conformational equilibrium of the TCR and its
regulation by cholesterol (all model parameters are listed in
Figure S6B).
A prediction of the model was that the TCR conformation con-
trols the TCR’s avidity for pMHC because only TCRp can bind
pMHC bivalently (Figure 7A). To test this prediction, we used
the OT1 TCR, which binds to OVA-H2-Ld MHC tetramers. The
mutant D227K-H2-Ld molecule does not bind to CD8 (Potter
et al., 1989), which allowed us to analyze the TCR-pMHC inter-
action only. In agreement with the model, the C80G mutant

(A and B) Jurkat cells grown in radioactive photo-cholesterol (red star) were either first exposed to UV light and then stimulated with pervanadate (lane 1) or first
stimulated with pervanadate and then exposed to UV light (lane 2). The cells also contained endogenous cholesterol that could not be cross-linked to the TCR
(depicted without the star). After cell lysis, only phosphorylated TCRs were purified with anti-phospho-tyrosine beads. Proteins were separated by reducing SDS-
PAGE, and autoradiography and IB were done (n = 2).
(C) Jurkat cells were left untreated or were stimulated with pervanadate. The lysate was split into three parts; the cholesterol- and SH3-PD assays were performed
(top and middle panels), and the lysates were analyzed (lower panels), n = 3.
(D) TCRs are in equilibrium between the resting (TCRr), primed (TCRp), and phosphorylated states. In unstimulated cells, the TCRr state and phosphatase activity
dominate, such that most TCRs are non-phosphorylated. The K76T TCR has a reduced capacity to switch to TCRp.
(E) Jurkat cells expressing WT or K76T murine CD3ε were stimulated with pervanadate. Cell numbers were adjusted to equal the number of murine CD3ε
molecules on the cell surface. After lysis, TCRs were isolated with anti-mouse CD3ε antibodies. IB was done as indicated (n = 3).

 2009), binds fewer OVA-D227K-H2-Ld MHC tetramers than the
WT OT1 TCR (Figure 7C; points) (Blanco et al., 2014). Fitting
the model to these data (Figure 7C, lines), we estimated Ka =
0.1 mM–1 and Kb = 1,755, thus indicating that pMHC binding
by TCRp is preferred. Similar results were obtained when the
MHC-CD8 interaction was not prevented (Figure S6C). In sum-
mary, the model predicts, and the experimental data confirm,
strong reduction of pMHC tetramer binding by a mutant TCR
that cannot switch to TCRp.
Collectively, these data define the parameters for the allostery
model of TCR regulation. The predicted dose-responses to
pMHC ligand concentrations show that cholesterol quantita-
tively controls the amount of TCRp (Figure 7D). Moreover,
cholesterol, by controlling the resting-primed state equilibrium,
influences pMHC binding (Figure 7E). In conclusion, cholesterol
emerges as a negative allosteric TCR-activity regulator that both
guards the resting state of the TCR and modulates TCR activa-
tion by ligands.
DISCUSSION
In recent years, specific interactions between TM regions of pro-
teins and membrane lipids have been discovered (Cherezov
et al., 2007; Contreras et al., 2012; Coskun et al., 2011; Hanson
et al., 2008) but not much is known about their functions. Here,
we have demonstrated that cholesterol binding to the TM region
of TCRb controlled T cell activation by regulating an allosteric
TCR switch that exposed the CD3ε PRS (active conformation
or primed TCR, TCRp) and permitted the phosphorylation of
the ITAM tyrosines. This was achieved by selective cholesterol
binding to the resting, inactive TCR conformation (TCRr), which
prevented spurious TCR activation and set the activation
threshold for pMHC ligands. Our findings thus show how a spe-
cific membrane lipid regulates receptor function.
Our data indicate that prior to stimulation, the TCR exists in
equilibrium between the resting and primed states. This is in
line with earlier reports showing that a fraction of the TCRs are
spontaneously in the TCRp state in unstimulated cells (de la
Cruz et al., 2011; Mingueneau et al., 2008). We found that on a
resting, mature T cell, 98% of the TCRs are in the TCRr state,
preventing spontaneous, ligand-independent signaling. Sponta-
neous signaling is further controlled by the constant removal of
CD3 phosphorylations by phosphatases, such as CD45 and
CD148 located in the vicinity of the resting TCR (Choudhuri
et al., 2005; Davis and van der Merwe, 2006). Our data strongly
support the idea that cholesterol binding stabilizes TCRr. Hence,
a prediction of our allosteric model is that the TCRr-TCRp equilib-
rium should be shifted toward the signaling-competent TCRp by
reducing cholesterol binding. Indeed, we have reduced choles-
terol binding genetically (by exchanging the TCRb TM region)
and enzymatically (by oxidizing or extracting cholesterol) and
show that the proportion of TCRp increased, which led to
increased spontaneous TCR-dependent signaling. Enhanced
signaling in primary T cells had previously been noted in a trans-
genic mouse model expressing a similar chimeric TCR in which
the TCRb TM region had been exchanged with that of TCRg
(Petersen et al., 2004); our findings now provide the molecular
explanation for this observation.
To prove that the capacity to be phosphorylated is dependent
on the conformational state of the TCR, we used the phospha-
tase inhibitor pervanadate, which leads to accumulation of phos-
phate groups at CD3 (O’Shea et al., 1992) without changing the
TCRr-TCRp equilibrium (Gil et al., 2002). Neither the K76T CD3ε-
containing TCR, which hardly switches to TCRp, nor covalently
cholesterol-linked TCRs, which are locked in the TCRr state,
were efficiently phosphorylated upon pervanadate treatment.
This indicated that CD3 phosphorylation by a ligand-indepen-
dent stimulus requires that the TCR spontaneously adopts the
TCRp conformation.
Our results raise the question of how ligand binding removes
cholesterol from TCRr. Our quantitative allosteric model sug-
gests that cholesterol spontaneously associates to and dissoci-
ates from the TCRr and that 50% of the TCRr is cholesterol
bound. Only when a TCRr is not bound to cholesterol can it

 spontaneously switch to TCRp. Then, TCRp can be stabilized by
pMHC binding, and cholesterol rebinding is prevented. We have
previously hypothesized that ligand binding induces the TCR to
switch to the active state (Gil et al., 2002; Minguet et al., 2007;
Risueno et al., 2005). However, our new data suggest that this
switch occurs spontaneously and that ligand binding stabilizes
TCRp. Monovalent pMHC binding might be enough to stabilize
TCRp when pMHC is tethered to a surface. However, we have
used soluble pMHC tetramers to quantify pMHC binding. For
soluble ligands it has been shown that, minimally, a dimeric
pMHC is required to stabilize TCRp (Minguet and Schamel,
2008) and thus foster downstream signaling (Boniface et al.,
1998; Cochran et al., 2000; Krogsgaard et al., 2005). This might
be true in the case where the TCR is a preformed nanocluster
(Schamel et al., 2005) or where two TCR monomers are held
together by bivalent pMHC binding. The change in the quater-
nary structure of the TCR might include reorientation of one
CD3z in respect to the second CD3z (Lee et al., 2015) without
structural changes within one TCRab heterodimer (Minguet
and Schamel, 2008).
Using quantitative data on the TCR conformational switch and
our understanding of the role of cholesterol in regulating the
TCRr-TCRp equilibrium, we developed a data-based mathemat-
ical model of the allosteric regulation of TCR phosphorylatability.
In the absence of cholesterol, 7% of the TCRs are in the TCRp
state. However, cholesterol tightens this regulation, and only
2% of the TCRs are in the TCRp state. This 3.5-fold increase cor-
responds to the narrow range of 2- to 4-fold increases in ITAM

(A) On resting T cells, most TCRs adopt the resting conformation (TCRr); of those, 50% are bound to cholesterol (TCRr,c) and 50% are not (TCRr,-). Only TCRr,-
spontaneously switches to TCRp. Monovalent pMHC binds equally well to both TCRr and TCRp. The allosteric switch to TCRp allows pMHC dimers with a
permissive geometry to bind bivalently, stabilizing TCRp. Only TCRp can be phosphorylated.

or was predicted from the model (red dots). Error bars represent SEM.

30 min with increasing concentrations of PE-labeled OVA-D227K-H2-Kb tetramers and with an APC-labeled anti-CD3 antibody (17A2) and measured by flow
cytometry. We gated on cells with similar TCR expression. The MFI values of the bound tetramer were normalized to the amount of surface TCR (n = 3); *p < 0.05,

 phosphorylation or ZAP70 recruitment upon TCR activation
(Deswal et al., 2011; Kim and White, 2006; Steinberg et al.,
2004). This increase is physiologically important because it
results in initiation of TCR signaling as seen by phospho-ERK
and CD69 upregulation. Because allosteric effects are reciprocal
(Monod et al., 1965), our model made the remarkable prediction
that the TCRr-TCRp equilibrium should also affect pMHC bind-
ing. Although there is much experimental evidence for the
reverse statement (pMHC binding shifts the conformational
equilibrium), this was an unexpected prediction given that ‘‘retro-
grade’’ effects of the TCR on ligand binding have not been
considered. Our subsequent experimental data supported this
prediction, showing that soluble pMHC tetramers bound with
higher avidity to WT TCRs than did those that are locked in the
TCRr conformation. Thus the allostery model of TCR regulation
proposed here implies that the avidity of a given TCR for antigen
is not a constant but can be regulated by the conformational
state of the TCR.
Studies involving CD3 mutants and modified ligands have
shown that the TCRp state, as measured by the exposure of the
CD3ε PRS, is required for ligand-induced CD3 phosphorylation
and T cell activation (Martinez-Martin et al., 2009; Minguet
et al., 2007). Because only the exposed PRS binds to NCK, it
has been suggested that NCK plays a role in CD3 phosphoryla-
tion (Blanco et al., 2014; Borroto et al., 2013; Mingueneau et al.,
2008). However, our data suggest an alternative mechanism.
Only in the TCRp state, and not in the TCRr state, are the ITAM ty-
rosines phosphorylatable. This provides a molecular mechanism
for how non-triggered TCRs are protected from phosphorylation
in the presence of active LCK (Nika et al., 2010). Thus, our model
explains how cholesterol aids to keep the TCR inactive and how
ligand binding induces TCR phosphorylation by stabilizing TCRp.
The molecular events described in our novel model most likely
precede the phosphorylation- or Ca2+ influx-induced dissocia-
tion of the CD3ε and CD3z cytoplasmic tails from the plasma
membrane (Aivazian and Stern, 2000; Shi et al., 2013; Xu et al.,
2008). In fact, these mechanisms might serve to facilitate further
phosphorylation and thereby sustain T cell activation signals.
It has been reported that extraction of cholesterol by methyl-
b-cyclodextrin (mbCD) followed by antibody stimulation leads
to reduced TCR signaling, most likely as a result of disruption
of lipid rafts (Montixi et al., 1998; Xavier et al., 1998). In contrast,
when mbCD is used as a stimulus, i.e., when signaling is
analyzed immediately after the mbCD treatment, the TCR is trig-
gered (Kabouridis et al., 2000; Rouquette-Jazdanian et al.,
2006). We now have provided a molecular mechanism for the
stimulatory effect of mbCD by demonstrating that lowering
cholesterol amounts leads to an increase in the TCRp that can
be phosphorylated. Our data also suggest that cholesterol ex-
erts its effect on TCR signaling directly at the TCR, as evidenced
by the observations that (1) cholesterol oxidation did not induce
signaling in a TCR-deficient T cell line, (2) the TMchim TCR
showed enhanced signaling, and (3) binding of cholesterol to
the TCR prevented CD3 phosphorylation.
Our new findings can be integrated with existing models of
TCR activation, and several molecular events might occur simul-
taneously. The change in the conformational state of the TCR
most likely includes the TM regions, such as the one of TCRb
(this study) and CD3z (Lee et al., 2015), the cytoplasmic tails of
CD3ε, CD3g, CD3d, and CD3z (Gil et al., 2002; Risueno et al.,
2008; Xu et al., 2008) (this study), and the extracellular arrange-
ment of at least two TCRs (this study). At the same time, ligand
binding could segregate phosphatases from the TCR to allow
phosphorylation to accumulate (Choudhuri et al., 2005; Davis
and van der Merwe, 2006). Aggregation of TCRs could increase
the local concentration of LCK and reduce the lateral mobility of
the receptor, and co-clustering of the TCR with the co-receptors
CD4 and CD8 might stabilize the pMHC-TCR interaction and re-
cruit additional LCK molecules. Furthermore, mechanical forces
elicited by pMHC binding (Kim et al., 2009) as well as other lipids
might play a role.
Cholesterol is also involved in the formation of TCR nanoclus-
ters (Molnar et al., 2012; Schamel et al., 2005), and thus it has
two apparently opposing effects in respect to pMHC binding.
By inducing TCR nanoclustering, cholesterol enhances the avid-
ity toward pMHC tetramers. In contrast, by stabilizing the TCRr
state, cholesterol decreases the avidity. Using our mathematical
model, we simulated reduction of the cholesterol concentration
and found that the impact of changing the TCRr-TCRp equilib-
rium on pMHC tetramer binding is rather small (maximal
3-fold change). Furthermore, experimental cholesterol extrac-
tion reduced pMHC tetramer binding to T cells (Fahmy et al.,
2001; Molnar et al., 2012). Thus, the nanoclustering function
of cholesterol predominates in regulating the avidity toward
pMHC tetramers. We suggest that cholesterol has a dual role
at the TCR, enhancing the sensitivity to agonistic ligands but still
restraining spontaneous signaling, which might be especially
important in the case of antigen-experienced T cells (Kumar
et al., 2011). Because different T cell developmental and differ-
entiation stages contain different concentrations of cholesterol
(Brumeanu et al., 2007; Kaech et al., 2002; Tani-ichi et al.,
2005), it could be that changes in the amount of cholesterol in
the plasma membrane contribute to regulation of TCR activity
and thereby to T cell sensitivity in vivo (Yang et al., 2016).
In conclusion, we show here that the specific interaction of the
TCRb TM region with cholesterol regulates TCR triggering and
T cell activation. In contrast to the long-standing assumption
that the plasma membrane is an inert solvent that does not affect
the conformation or activity of membrane proteins, we clearly
demonstrate that cholesterol binding to the TCR regulates CD3
phosphorylability. Lipids therefore play a role not only in the acti-
vation of T cells but also in the guarding of their resting state. Our
work provides a paradigm for how the activity of TM proteins can
be regulated.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Photocholesterol Labeling
[3a-3H]6-azi-5a-cholestan-3a-ol (radioactive UV-light cross-linkable choles-
terol, photocholesterol) was provided by Dr. C. Thiele. Jurkat cells were
incubated for 16 hr in lipid-free medium containing a radioactive cross-link-
able cholesterol-mbCD complex (5 mCi/ml) and were UV-irradiated for 30 s,
before or after addition of the stimulus (anti-CD3, UCHT1, or anti-TCRb,
Jovi1) at the indicated times. After cell lysis, IPs were performed as indi-
cated. Samples were separated by two parallel SDS-PAGE gels. One gel
was dried and exposed to an X-ray film (autoradiography), and the second
gel as subjected to IB. Alternatively, membrane patches were prepared
as outlined in the Supplemental Information the TCRp-state-stabilizing anti-
body was given at 37�C and after UV irradiation, and the membranes were
lysed and analyzed as in the Supplemental Information.

 Synthesis of Beads Coupled to Stearate, Palmitate, and Cholesterol
The synthesis of the stearate-, palmitate-, and cholesterol-coupled sepharose
beads was as described (Beck-Garcia et al., 2013); the carboxygroups of
stearate, palmitate, or cholesteryl hemisuccinate were activated by N,N-diiso-
propyl-ethylamine and O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoro-
borate and coupled to u-aminohexyl agarose beads. The completeness of
the reaction was tested with a Kaisertest.
SH3 Pull-Down Assay, Lipid Pull-Down Assay, IP, and
Immunoblotting
Lysates were subjected to the SH3 pull-down assay with SH3.1(NCK)-GST
bound glutathione-coupled beads as described (Gil et al., 2002). The choles-
terol, stearate, and palmitate pull-down assays were also done as described
(Beck-Garcia et al., 2013); after the pull-down assays, the beads were washed
three times with lysis buffer containing 0.05%–0.5% Brij96V. In these pull-
down assays, the detergent molecules and possibly some of the endogenous
lipids are bound to the TM regions of the TCR. Thus, those molecules might
have mediated or modified the interaction of the lipid-coupled beads with
the TCR. However, radioactive cholesterol was directly crosslinked to the
TCRb chain, showing that cholesterol directly binds to the TCR in living cells.
Anti-TCR IPs were performed with 2 mg of anti-CD3ε or anti-TCRb antibodies
overnight at 4�C. Anti-phosphotyrosine IPs were performed with anti-phos-
pho-tyrosine antibody (PT-66)-coupled beads (Sigma). SDS-PAGE separation
and IB were performed by conventional methods. Quantifications of the band
intensities were done with the Image Studio v. 2.0 (LI-COR), ImageJ, or the
ImageQuantTL software (GE Healthcare) after fluorescence or chemolumines-
cence detection.
Reconstitution of CD3 Phosphorylation
2 3 108 31-13.scTCRb cells were lysed in buffer with 1% digitonin or 0.5%
Brij96V. One part of the lysate was left untreated, and 5 mg anti-CD3ε (OKT3
or UCHT1) or anti-TCRb antibody (Jovi1) was added to the other parts. Anti-
bodies bound to the scTCR on ice for 30–90 min. 7 mM cholesterol in EtOH
or EtOH alone was then added when indicated. Afterward, the scTCRs (and
bound antibodies) were purified with nitro-phenol-coupled sepharose beads.
After washing, 50 ng active, recombinant GST-LCK and 1 mM ATP were added
in kinase buffer (40 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM MnCl2) and
incubated for the indicated times at 37�C. The presence of the TCRp state or
antibody binding to the TCR was controlled by SH3 pull down or binding to
protein G Sepharose, respectively.
Upregulation of CD69
To quantify the degree of T cell activation, we stimulated the cells for 6–7 hr
with the indicated stimuli. Cells were stained with an APC-coupled anti-
CD69 antibody (Invitrogen), washed, and analyzed with a Calibur (BD Biosci-
ences) or a Gallios (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer. Fluorescence intensities
were analyzed with FlowJo 8.2 software.
Statistical Analysis
Error bars depict standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance
and linear regression were determined with GraphPad Prism as indicated:
* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. The significances were calculated
by Student’s t test.
