abstract
This policy statement focuses on children and adolescents 5 through 18 
years of age. Research suggests both benefi
 ts and risks of media use for 
the health of children and teenagers. Benefi
 ts include exposure to new 
ideas and knowledge acquisition, increased opportunities for social contact 
and support, and new opportunities to access health-promotion messages 
and information. Risks include negative health effects on weight and sleep; 
exposure to inaccurate, inappropriate, or unsafe content and contacts; 
and compromised privacy and confi
 dentiality. Parents face challenges 
in monitoring their children’s and their own media use and in serving as 
positive role models. In this new era, evidence regarding healthy media use 
does not support a one-size-fi
 ts-all approach. Parents and pediatricians can 
work together to develop a Family Media Use Plan (www. 
healthychildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan) that considers their children’s developmental stages to 
individualize an appropriate balance for media time and consistent rules 
about media use, to mentor their children, to set boundaries for accessing 
content and displaying personal information, and to implement open family 
communication about media.
INTRODUCTION
Today’s generation of children and adolescents are growing up immersed 
in media, including broadcast and social media. Broadcast media include 
television and movies. Interactive media include social media and video 
games in which users can both consume and create content. Interactive 
media allow information sharing and provide an engaging digital 
environment that becomes highly personalized.
Media Use Patterns
The most common broadcast medium continues to be TV. A recent study 
found that TV hours among school-aged children have decreased in the 
past decade for children younger than 8 years. 
1 However, among children 
aged 8 years and older, average daily TV time remains over 2 hours per

day. 
2 TV viewing also has changed 
over the past decade, with content 
available via streaming or social 
media sites, such as YouTube and 
Netflix.
Overall media use among adolescents 
has continued to grow over the 
past decade, aided by the recent 
increase in mobile phone use among 
teenagers. Approximately three-
quarters of teenagers today own a 
smartphone, 
 
3 which allows access to 
the Internet, streaming TV/videos, 
and interactive “apps.” Approximately 
one-quarter of teenagers describe 
themselves as “constantly connected” 
to the Internet. 
3
Social media sites and mobile apps 
provide platforms for users to create 
an online identity, communicate with 
others, and build social networks. 
At present, 76% of teenagers use at 
least 1 social media site. 
3 Although 
Facebook remains the most popular 
social media site, 
 
3 teenagers do not 
typically commit to just 1 social 
media platform; more than 70% 
maintain a “social media portfolio” 
of several selected sites, including 
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
3 
Mobile apps provide a breadth of 
functions, such as photo sharing, 
games, and video-chatting.
Video games remain very popular 
among families; 4 of 5 households 
own a device used to play video 
games. 
4 Boys are the most avid video 
game players, with 91% of boys 
reporting having access to a game 
console and 84% reporting playing 
video games online or on a cell 
phone.

Benefi
 ts of Media
Both traditional and social media can 
provide exposure to new ideas and 
information, raising awareness of 
current events and issues. Interactive 
media also can provide opportunities 
for the promotion of community 
participation and civic engagement. 
Students can collaborate with others 
on assignments and projects on 
many online media platforms. The 
use of social media helps families 
and friends who are separated 
geographically communicate across 
the miles.
Social media can enhance access 
to valuable support networks, 
which may be particularly helpful 
for patients with ongoing illnesses, 
conditions, or disabilities. 
5 In 1 study, 
young adults described the benefits 
of seeking health information 
online and through social media, 
and recognized these channels as 
useful supplementary sources of 
information to health care visits. 
6 
Research also supports the use of 
social media to foster social inclusion 
among users who may feel excluded 
7 
or who are seeking a welcoming 
community: for example, those 
identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, questioning, or intersex. 
Finally, social media may be used 
to enhance wellness and promote 
healthy behaviors, such as smoking 
cessation and balanced nutrition.

Risks of Media
A first area of health concern is 
media use and obesity, and most 
studies have focused on TV. One 
study found that the odds of being 
overweight were almost 5 times 
greater for adolescents who watch 
more than 5 hours of TV per day 
compared with those who watch 0 
to 2 hours. 
9 This study’s findings 
contributed to recommendations by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
that children have 2 hours or less of 
sedentary screen time daily. More 
recent studies have provided new 
evidence that watching TV for more 
than 1.5 hours daily was a risk factor 
for obesity, but only for children 4 
through 9 years of age. 
10 Increased 
caloric intake via snacking while 
watching TV has been shown to be a 
risk factor for obesity, as is exposure 
to advertising for high-calorie foods 
and snacks. 
11, 
 
12 Having a TV in the 
bedroom continues to be associated 
with the risk of obesity.13
Evidence suggests that media use 
can negatively affect sleep. 
14 Studies 
show that those with higher social 
media use 
15 or who sleep with 
mobile devices in their rooms 
16 were 
at greater risk of sleep disturbances. 
Exposure to light (particularly blue 
light) and activity from screens 
before bed affects melatonin levels 
and can delay or disrupt sleep. 
17 
Media use around or after bedtime 
can disrupt sleep and negatively 
affect school performance.13
Children who overuse online 
media are at risk of problematic 
Internet use, 
 
18 and heavy users of 
video games are at risk of Internet 
gaming disorder. 
19 The Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition, 
 
20 
lists both as conditions in need 
of further research. Symptoms 
can include a preoccupation with 
the activity, decreased interest in 
offline or “real life” relationships, 
unsuccessful attempts to decrease 
use, and withdrawal symptoms. The 
prevalence of problematic Internet 
use among children and adolescents 
is between 4% and 8%, 
 
21, 
22 and up 
to 8.5% of US youth 8 to 18 years of 
age meet criteria for Internet gaming 
disorder. 
23
At home, many children and 
teenagers use entertainment 
media at the same time that they 
are engaged in other tasks, such as 
homework. 
24 A growing body of 
evidence suggests that the use of 
media while engaged in academic 
tasks has negative consequences on 
learning. 
25, 
 
26
Media Infl
 uence
Evidence gathered over decades 
supports links between media 
exposure and health behaviors 
among teenagers. 
27 The exposure of 
adolescents through media to 
alcohol, 
 
28, 
 
29 tobacco use, 
 
30, 
31 or 
sexual behaviors 
32 is associated with 
earlier initiation of these behaviors.

media frequently include portrayal

of health risk behaviors, such as 
substance use, sexual behaviors, 
self-injury, or disordered eating. 
33 
 
– 
36 
Peer viewers of such content may 
see these behaviors as normative 
and desirable.37, 
 
38 Research from 
both the United States and the United 
Kingdom indicates that the major 
alcohol brands maintain a strong 
presence on Facebook, Twitter, and 
YouTube. 
29,

Cyberbullying, Sexting, and Online 
Solicitation
Cyberbullying and traditional 
bullying overlap, 
 
40 although online 
bullying presents unique challenges. 
These challenges include that 
perpetrators can be anonymous 
and bully at any time of day, that 
information can spread online 
rapidly, 
 
41 and that perpetrator and 
target roles can be quite fluid in 
the online world. Cyberbullying 
can lead to short- and long-term 
negative social, academic, and 
health consequences for both 
the perpetrator and the target. 
42 
Fortunately, newer studies suggest 
that interventions that target bullying 
may reduce cyberbullying. 
43
“Sexting” is commonly defined as the 
electronic transmission of nude or 
seminude images as well as sexually 
explicit text messages. It is estimated 
that ∼12% of youth aged 10 to 19 
years have ever sent a sexual photo 
to someone else. 
44 The Internet 
also has created opportunities for 
the exploitation of children by sex 
offenders through social networking, 
chat rooms, e-mail, and online 
games. 
45
Social Media and Mental Health
Research studies have identified 
both benefits and concerns regarding 
mental health and social media 
use. Benefits from the use of social 
media in moderation include 
the opportunity for enhanced 
social support and connection. 
Research has suggested a U-shaped 
relationship between Internet use 
and depression, with increased risks 
of depression at both the high and 
low ends of Internet use. 
46, 
 
47 One 
study found that older adolescents 
who used social media passively (eg, 
viewing others’ photos) reported 
declines in life satisfaction, whereas 
those who interacted with others and 
posted content did not experience 
these declines. 
48 Thus, in addition to 
the number of hours an individual 
spends on social media, a key factor 
is how social media is used.
Social Media and Privacy
Content that an adolescent chooses 
to post is shared with others, 
and the removal of such content 
once posted may be difficult or 
impossible. Adolescents vary in their 
understanding of privacy practices 
49; 
even those who know how to set 
privacy settings often don’t believe 
they will work. 
50 Despite efforts by 
some social media sites to protect 
privacy or to delete content after 
it is viewed, privacy violations and 
unwelcome distribution are always 
risks. 
51, 
 
52
Parent Media Use and Child Health
Social media can provide positive 
social experiences, such as 
opportunities for parents to 
connect with children via video-
chat services. Unfortunately, some 
parents can be distracted by media 
and miss important opportunities 
for emotional connections that are 
known to improve child health. 
53, 
 
54 
One research study found that 
when a parent turned his or her 
attention to a mobile device while 
with a young child, the parent was 
less likely to talk with the child. 
55 
Parental engagement is critical in the 
development of children’s emotional 
and social development, and these 
distractions may have short- and 
long-term negative effects.
CONCLUSIONS
The effects of media use are 
multifactorial and depend on the 
type of media, the type of use, the 
amount and extent of use, and the 
characteristics of the individual child. 
Children today are growing up in an 
era of highly personalized media use 
experiences, so parents must develop 
personalized media use plans for 
their children that attend to each 
child’s age, health, temperament, 
and developmental stage. Research 
evidence shows that children and 
teenagers need adequate sleep, 
physical activity, and time away 
from media. Pediatricians can help 
families develop a Family Media Use 
Plan (www. 
HealthyChildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan) that prioritizes these 
and other health goals.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Pediatricians
 
• Work with families and schools 
to promote understanding of the 
benefits and risks of media.
 
• Promote adherence to guidelines 
for adequate physical activity 
and sleep via a Family Media Use 
Plan (www. 
HealthyChildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan).
 
• Advocate for and promote 
information and training in media 
literacy.
 
• Be aware of tools to screen for 
sexting, cyberbullying, problematic 
Internet use, and Internet gaming 
disorder.
Families
 
• Develop, consistently follow, and 
routinely revisit a Family Media 
Use plan (see the plan from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
at www. 
HealthyChildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan).
 
⚬ Address what type of and how 
much media are used and what 
media behaviors are appropriate 
for each child or teenager, and 
for parents. Place consistent 
limits on hours per day of media

use as well as types of media 
used.
 
⚬ Promote that children 
and adolescents get the 
recommended amount of daily 
physical activity (1 hour) and 
adequate sleep (8–12 hours, 
depending on age).
 
⚬ Recommend that children not 
sleep with devices in their 
bedrooms, including TVs, 
computers, and smartphones. 
Avoid exposure to devices 
or screens for 1 hour before 
bedtime.
 
⚬ Discourage entertainment media 
while doing homework.
 
⚬ Designate media-free times 
together (eg, family dinner) 
and media-free locations (eg, 
bedrooms) in homes. Promote 
activities that are likely to 
facilitate development and 
health, including positive 
parenting activities, such as 
reading, teaching, talking, and 
playing together.
 
⚬ Communicate guidelines to other 
caregivers, such as babysitters 
or grandparents, so that media 
rules are followed consistently.
 
• Engage in selecting and co-viewing 
media with your child, through 
which your child can use media to 
learn and be creative, and share 
these experiences with your family 
and your community.
 
• Have ongoing communication with 
children about online citizenship 
and safety, including treating others 
with respect online and offline, 
avoiding cyberbullying and sexting, 
being wary of online solicitation, 
and avoiding communications that 
can compromise personal privacy 
and safety.
 
• Actively develop a network of 
trusted adults (eg, aunts, uncles, 
coaches, etc) who can engage with 
children through social media and 
to whom children can turn when 
they encounter challenges.
Researchers, Governmental 
Organizations, and Industry
 
• Continue research into the risks 
and benefits of media.
 
⚬ Prioritize longitudinal and 
robust study designs, including 
new methodologies for 
understanding media exposure 
and use.
 
⚬ Prioritize interventions including 
reducing harmful media use 
and preventing and addressing 
harmful media experiences.
 
• Inform educators and legislators 
about research findings so they can 
develop updated guidelines for safe 
and productive media use.
