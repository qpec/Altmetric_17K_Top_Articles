Abstract
Although mitochondrial and serotonergic dysfunctions have been implicated in the etiology of bipolar disorder (BD), the
relationship between these unrelated pathways has not been elucidated. A family of BD and chronic progressive external
ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) caused by a mutation of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1, SLC25A4)
implicated that ANT1 mutations confer a risk of BD. Here, we sequenced ANT1 in 324 probands of NIMH bipolar disorder
pedigrees and identified two BD patients carrying heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Behavioral analysis of brain
specific Ant1 heterozygous conditional knockout (cKO) mice using lntelliCage showed a selective diminution in delay
discounting. Delay discounting is the choice of smaller but immediate reward than larger but delayed reward and an index of
impulsivity. Diminution of delay discounting suggests an increase in serotonergic activity. This finding was replicated by a
5-choice serial reaction time test. An anatomical screen showed accumulation of COX (cytochrome c oxidase) negative cells
in dorsal raphe. Dorsal raphe neurons in the heterozygous cKO showed hyperexcitability, along with enhanced serotonin
turnover in the nucleus accumbens and upregulation of Maob in dorsal raphe. These findings altogether suggest that
mitochondrial dysfunction as the genetic risk of BD may cause vulnerability to BD by altering serotonergic
neurotransmission.
Introduction
Bipolar disorder is a major mental disorder characterized
by mania and depression. Dysregulation in both mono-
aminergic systems [1] and mitochondrial calcium signal-
ing [2] have been proposed in the etiology of bipolar
disorder. However, the relationship between these appar-
ently unrelated metabolic signaling systems has not been
elucidated [3]. Clinical studies showed that around 20% of
patients with mitochondrial disease have comorbid bipolar
disorder [4–6], whereas 0.38% of patients with bipolar
disorder had mutations of POLG (polymerase γ) causative
for mitochondrial disease [7]. In a family of bipolar dis-
order and autosomal dominantly inherited chronic external
ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), the L98P mutation of ANT1
(adenine nucleotide translocator 1, SLC25A4) was identi-
fied [8, 9]. These findings suggest that central nervous
system involvement in mitochondrial disease caused by
ANT1 mutations confers a risk of bipolar disorder. ANT1 is
named for its function as a translocator of adenosine tri-
phosphate and adenosine diphosphate across the mito-
chondrial inner membrane. However, its modulatory role

 in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)
has also drawn attention [10–12]. The mPTP plays a role
in regulated cell death, and transient opening of the mPTP
also regulates mitochondrial calcium signaling [13], which
is consistent with the well-known calcium dysregulation
hypothesis of bipolar disorder [14].
In this study, we searched for ANT1 mutations in patients
with bipolar disorder, and identified two independent loss of
function (LOF) mutations of ANT1. We investigated the
relationship
between
heterozygous
loss
of
function
of ANT1 and bipolar disorder by generating a brain specific
Ant1 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse. By behavioral
screening,
we
identified
that

the
choice of smaller but immediate reward than larger but

with this finding, the mice had enhanced serotoninergic
activity. These findings together shed new light on the
mechanism of how ANT1 mutations may confer a risk
for BD.

Subjects
All four exons of the SLC25A4 gene were sequenced
by PCR-direct sequencing in 324 probands of NIMH
Genetics Initiative bipolar disorder pedigrees. Their
diagnosis was bipolar I (n = 304), bipolar II disorder
(n = 17),
or

Flp-transgenic
mouse line (B6
Tg(cat-Flpe)36) was previously generated
[16]. Nestin-Cre transgenic mouse line (B6.CgTg(Nes-cre)
1Kln/J) was obtained from Jackson laboratory. Using these
mice lines, heterozygous and homozygous cKO mice of
Slc25a4 (Slc25a4fl/fl or Slc25a4fl/+) (Ant1 cKO mice) were
generated.

viously described [17]. Images were captured by a confocal
microscope IX81 with FV1000 (Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan), Observer Z1 with AxioVision 4.6 (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germaney) or Nano Zoomer Digital Pathology
system
(Nanozoomer

Mouse behavioral screening with IntelliCage
The IntelliCage apparatuses (NewBehavior AG, Zurich,
Switzerland)
were
used
for
behavioral
screening
as
described previously [18, 19]. Male mice including 8 het-
erozygous cKO mice (Slc25a4fl/+; Nes-Cre+), 10 homo-
zygous cKO mice (Slc25a4fl/fl; Nes-Cre+) and 6 controls
(Slc25a4fl/+
or
Slc25a4fl/fl;
Nes-Cre−),
which
were
20–27 week old, were used.
5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT)
The 5-CSRTT operant chamber (O’HARA & Co., Tokyo,
Japan) was used as previously described with minor mod-
ification [20]. Male mice including 8 controls (Slc25a4fl/+ or
Slc25a4fl/fl;
Nes-Cre−),
8
heterozygous
cKO
mice
(Slc25a4fl/+; Nes-Cre+) and 8 homozygous cKO mice
(Slc25a4fl/fl; Nes-Cre+), which were 8–13 week old at the
beginning of training, were used for the analysis.
Quantification of mtDNA deletion and mtDNA copy
number
Partially deleted mitochondrial DNA (ΔmtDNA) and copy
number of mtDNA was measured by quantitative PCR
methods using SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit (Takara Bio,
Otsu, Japan) and QuantStudio 12 K Flex (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) as described [21]. For quantifi-
cation of mtDNA deletion 30–39 week old male mice were
used. For mtDNA copy number analysis, 54–56 week old
male mice were used. Control mice were Slc25a4fl/+ or
Slc25a4fl/fl without Nestin-Cre.
Quantification of Ant1/Ant2 mRNAs
mRNA expression of Ant1 (Slc25a4) and Ant2 (Slc25a5)
were measured by quantitative PCR methods using SYBR
Premix Ex Taq Kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) and
QuantStudio 12 K Flex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal-
tham, MA). For these analysis, female 78–114 week old
mice were used (n = 3 for each group).

 Measurement of calcium retention capacity
Brain mitochondria were isolated using a discontinuous
Percoll gradient developed by Sims [22] with minor mod-
ifications [23]. Extra-mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration
([Ca2+]exm) was monitored with 200 nM Calcium Green-5N
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) (Ex 480 nm, Em
540 nm) in a 96 well plate at 30 °C in a Drug Screening
System (FDSS 3000, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu,
Japan). To evaluate the CRC, 10 µl of Ca2+ solution was
repeatedly added at 1-min intervals. Heterozygous cKO
mice (Slc25a4fl/+; Nes-Cre+) (n = 4), homozygous cKO
mice (Slc25a4fl/fl; Nes-Cre+) (n = 4), and control mice
(Slc25a4fl/fl; Nes-Cre−) (n = 3) aged 8–27 weeks were used
for this analysis.
Quantification of monoamine in tissue by HPLC
Dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin and their meta-
bolites were measured by HPLC with an EICOMPAK
SC-5ODS
with
electrochemical
detector
ECD-300
(Eicom Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). In this experiment,
control mice included Slc25a4+/+; Nestin-Cre+ and
Slc25a4+/+, Slc25a4fl/+ or Slc25a4fl/fl without Nestin-Cre.
For this experiment, 88–103 week old male mice were
used.
Electrophysiological analysis
Brain slices for experiments were prepared from 10–12-
week-old, male mice as described previously [24]. Whole
cell patch-clamp recordings were acquired and controlled
using the Axon 700B Multiclamp amplifer (Molecular
Devices, CA, US) and pClamp11 acquisition software
(Molecular Devices, CA, US). For this analysis, hetero-
zygous Ant1 cKO mice (Slc25a4fl/+; Nes-Cre+) (n = 4) and
control mice (Slc25a4fl/+ without Nes-Cre) (n = 3) aged
8–12 week old were used.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by Prism 4 (Graphpad softoware Inc.,
San Diego, CA), IBM SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM Japan,
Tokyo,
Japan),
“R”
(https://www.r-project.org/)
or
Kyplot (Kyence, Tokyo, Japan). For genetic association
analysis, Fisher’s exact probability test was used. In the
comparison between the heterozygous or homozygous
cKO mice and control mice, Student t-test was used. For
place learning task and delay discounting task in Intel-
liCage, repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni’s
post hoc test was used with main effects of genotype and
delay or day.
Results
Identification of loss of function mutations in
bipolar patients
We sequenced the ANT1 gene in 324 NIMH probands with
bipolar disorder and identified two patients carrying LOF
mutations. One patient had a stop codon mutation p.Q85X,
a substitution of C to T at Chr 4: 185,144,905 [hg38] while
the other had p.Q175RfsX38, a single nucleotide deletion at
Chr 4: 185,145,174, causing a frameshift and premature
stop codon (Supplementary Figures 1A-B), which was
reported in a pedigree of recessive cardiomyopathy with
comorbid depression and anxiety [25]. The frequency of
LOF mutations (gain of stop codon or frame shift) for ANT1
in BD (2/324, 0.61%) was significantly higher than that in
the exome and genome data in the gnomAD database (10 of
128,632 [2 stop codons and 8 frameshift mutations],
0.000069%, Fisher’s exact probability test, P = 0.00040,
odds ratio = 79.7 [95%CI: 8.4–374.4]). Both mutations
were on exon 3 and were thus predicted to undergo
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Even when cDNAs of
the predicted mutant mRNA encoding truncated proteins
were constructed, protein expression of these mutants was
markedly reduced in Neuro 2A cells (Supplementary Fig-
ure 1C). Although the two mutations did not show
complete cosegregation with BD in the two pedigrees partly
because of bilinear transmission (Supplementary Fig-
ure 1D), the significant association with high odds ratio
suggested the role of these LOF mutations as a genetic risk
factor for BD.
Generation of brain-specific Ant1 cKO mice
ANT1 mutations are known to cause a neuromuscular dis-
order, CPEO, and thus behavioral analyses must be per-
formed using brain-specific mutant mice. We crossed floxed
Ant1 mice (Slc25a4fl/fl or Slc25a4fl/+) with Nestin-Cre
transgenic mice to generate a brain-specific cKO Ant1
mouse (Fig. 1a). We verified that the homozygous Ant1
cKO mice (Slc25a4fl/fl; Nestin-Cre+) have no Ant1 mRNA
(Fig. 1b) and protein (Fig. 1c) expression in the brain, and
heterozygous Ant1 cKO mice (Slc25a4fl/+; Nestin-Cre+)
have reduced Ant1 mRNA (Fig. 1d) compared to control
mice (Slc25a4+/+; Nestin-Cre+, Slc25a4fl/+ or Slc25a4fl/fl;
without Nestin-Cre). No compensatory upregulation of Ant2
mRNA was observed (Fig. 1e).

controls.

 cKO mice to model the human disorder. Homozygous cKO
mice were examined as a reference control, and Slc25a4fl/+
or Slc25a4fl/fl without Nestin-Cre, or Slc25a4+/+; Nestin-
Cre+ were also examined as controls.
Behavioral phenotypes of brain-specific Ant1 cKO
mice
We performed behavioral screening using the IntelliCage
(Fig. 2a). Indices for spatial learning, reverse learning, and
attention did not differ between genotypes (Supplemen-
tary Figures 2A-E), but the heterozygous cKO mice
showed
a
significantly
decreased
delay
discounting
(Fig. 2b). The preference for saccharin did not differ
between
genotypes
(F = 1.0,
P = 0.36
by
one
way
ANOVA) (Supplementary Figure 2F), suggesting that this
finding is not due to altered reward value. Homozygous
Ant1 cKO mice also showed a similar behavioral pheno-
type (Fig. 2b), although more similar to controls than
heterozygous cKO mice.
To further characterize the behavioral phenotypes of
heterozygous Ant1 cKO mice, we performed a 5-choice
serial reaction time test (5-CSRTT), an established test to
measure impulsivity [26] as a reflection of enhanced delay
discounting (Figs. 2c–f, Supplementary Figures 2G-I). In
this test, the number of premature nose pokes during long
stimulus duration trials, which is an index of impulsivity,
was significantly lower in heterozygous cKO mice than
control mice (Fig. 2d). A decrease of impulsivity is
equivalent to a decrease in delay discounting shown by the
IntelliCage (Fig. 2b). The heterozygous cKO mice also
showed better accuracy (Fig. 2e) and a lower number of
perseverative responses than control mice in the long inter-
trial interval trials (Fig. 2f). Homozygous cKO mice did not
show similar phenotypes in the 5-CSRTT for unknown
reasons.
Anatomical screen
We searched for brain regions with mitochondrial dys-
function due to the heterozygous knockout of Ant1 by
performing COX (cytochrome c oxidase)/SDH (succinate
dehydrogenase) co-staining. COX is a mtDNA-encoded
protein whereas SDH is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
protein, and COX-negative cells were detected in a model
mouse of mitochondrial disease [27]. In a sagittal section of
aged homozygous Ant1 cKO mice, COX negative cells
were detected preferentially in the dorsal raphe (DR)
(Fig. 3a) and heterozygous Ant1 cKO mice also showed
COX negative cells in the DR (Fig. 3b). Unexpectedly,
however, a similar accumulation of COX negative cells was
also detected in the DR of wild type mice (Fig. 3b). In this
region, mtDNA deletions (ΔmtDNA) were not detectable
both in cKO and control mice (Fig. 3c). Thus, the DR may
have a selective vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction
unrelated to the accumulation of ΔmtDNA, and the phe-
notype of the mutant mice might be caused by an interaction
of the genotype and a general vulnerability of DR neurons
to mitochondrial dysfunction. The copy number of mtDNA
was significantly increased in DR of heterozygous cKO
mice compared with control mice (Fig. 3d).
Serotonergic dysfunction in Ant1 KO mice
The activation of serotonergic neurons reportedly attenuates
delay discounting [28], and therefore we examined serotonin
turnover in the nucleus accumbens, which is innervated by DR
serotonergic neurons and regulates impulsivity [29]. We found
that serotonin turnover was enhanced in the nucleus accum-
bens of heterozygous KO mice (Fig. 3e). There was no sig-
nificant difference of the serotonin turnover between Nestin-
Cre and wild type mice (0.55 ± 0.07 vs 0.75 ± 0.17, respec-
tively, P = 0.15, n = 3 for both groups). We also analyzed the
gene expression level of Maob (monoamine oxidase B) that
encodes a monoamine metabolizing enzyme on the mito-
chondrial outer membrane enriched in the DR [30]. To nor-
malize expression levels of Maob by the number of
serotonergic neurons within the sample, a serotonin neuron
specific gene, Tph2 or Slc6a4, was used for a reference. We
found that Maob mRNA was significantly increased in the DR

sistent with the elevated turnover of serotonin in the nucleus

To test whether serotonergic neurons were activated in
the Ant1 cKO mice, we performed electrophysiological
recordings from midbrain slices containing the DR. As
Ant1 mutant mice bridge the mitochondrial and serotonergic dysfunctions in bipolar disorder
2045
 shown in Supplementary Table 1, both basic membrane
properties and action potential properties of serotonergic
neurons at the midline of the DR did not show significant
differences between genotypes. However, the input-output
relationship curves, which show the generation of action
potentials by current injection was steeper in heterozygous
Ant1 cKO mice than that of controls (Fig. 4) indicating that
serotonergic neurons of heterozygous Ant1 cKO mice are
more excitable.
Discussion
In this study, we identified two patients with bipolar dis-
order carrying loss of function mutations in ANT1 (Sup-
plementary Figure 1). Brain-specific heterozygous cKO
mice of Ant1 showed diminished delay discounting or
reduced impulsivity by two behavioral tests (Fig. 2).
Enhanced serotonin turnover (Fig. 3e) and hyperactivity of
serotonergic neurons (Fig. 4) were consistent with the
behavioral phenotype [28]. Increased mtDNA copy number
in DR (Fig. 3d) might reflect an increased energy demand in
the DR, and upregulation of Maob mRNA is considered a
compensatory upregulation associated with enhanced ser-
otonergic activity. These findings, together, suggest that the
heterozygous loss of Ant1 in the brain causes a hyperser-
otonergic state and associated behavioral phenotypes.
The mechanism of how the heterozygous loss of function
of Ant1 causes serotonergic hyperactivity is not known.
Elevated
intracellular
calcium
associated
with
depolarization is sequestered by mitochondria. The accu-
mulation of intramitochondrial calcium results in a transient
opening of the mPTP [31]. Ant1 reportedly has a mod-
ulatory effect on the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore (mPTP) [10]. An altered mPTP function associated
with heterozygous loss of Ant1 might affect the excitability
of DR neurons.
A previous study reported exaggerated corticosterone
responses to stress in homozygous conventional Ant1 KO
mice [32]. Enhanced serotonergic function might also
underlie this finding, because serotoninergic stimulation is
known to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[33].
Why are serotonergic neurons preferentially affected
by the heterozygous loss of Ant1? Monoamines are
metabolized by monoamine oxidases (MAOs) on the
mitochondrial outer membrane. Metabolism of mono-
amines by MAOs is accompanied by the generation of
hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species [30].
Enhanced
serotonin
release
by
3,4-methylenediox-
ymethamphetamine (MDMA) can decrease COX protein
levels, which can be rescued by an MAO-B inhibitor [34].

 We speculate that serotonergic neurons may be intrinsi-
cally vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction, and the
hyperserotonergic state may further impair mitochondrial
function in a vicious cycle. The results of the COX/SDH
staining in this study support this hypothesis. The
degeneration of DR serotonergic neurons is frequently
seen in Parkinson’s disease, in which mitochondrial dys-
function is implicated, and this might at least partly
explain the non-motor symptoms of this disease [35]. In
Parkinson’s disease, 8-hydroxyguanosine is accumulated
in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, and this is also
true for the DR [36]. Thus, the mitochondrial dysfunction
phenotype due to the heterozygous cKO of Ant1 is pre-
dominantly seen in serotonergic neurons, which may have
an intrinsic vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction.
The mechanism of how COX immunoreactivity is reduced
in the DR is not known because the present study did not
show an increase of ΔmtDNA levels or a decrease of
mtDNA copy number. Reduction of COX immunor-
eactivity in DR neurons might be regulated by other types
of mtDNA abnormalities and/or at the protein level [37].
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in
bipolar disorder based on several lines of evidence [2]
including altered energy metabolism detected by magnetic
resonance spectroscopy [38], comorbidity with mito-
chondrial diseases [4, 7], and findings in postmortem
brains including an accumulation of ΔmtDNAs [39, 40],
altered gene expression of mitochondria-related genes
[41], altered morphology of mitochondria [42], and
decreased activity of mitochondrial complex I [43]. On the
other hand, serotonergic dysfunction in bipolar disorder
has been implicated by evidence including the mania-
inducing effect of antidepressants that inhibits the ser-
otonin transporter and thereby activates serotonin [44], the
efficacy
of
atypical antipsychotics
that inhibits
ser-
otonergic neurotransmission [45], altered mRNA expres-
sion levels of serotonergic receptors in postmortem brain
[46], altered DNA methylation of serotonin transporter
gene [47], altered serotonin transporter binding in the brain
by positron emission tomography [48], and levels of cer-
ebrospinal fluid metabolites, among others [14]. The pre-
sent findings provide a potential missing link between
these two lines of evidence. Because the two LOF muta-
tions identified in this study were not cosegregated with
bipolar disorder in the two pedigrees, they are not “cau-
sative” mutations. However, their significant association
suggests that the heterozygous LOF mutations of ANT1
confer the risk of bipolar disorder.
There are several limitations in this study. Notably, it is
unknown why homozygous Ant1 cKO mice do not show
behavioral alterations in some experiments. However, such
non-linear dynamics are inherent to complex biological
systems such as the brain. Secondly, Nestin-Cre mice
reportedly have some behavioral alterations [49], which
could in principle confound the results. However, we ver-
ified that this transgene did not affect serotonin turnover and
excitability of DR serotonergic neurons (Supplementary
Figure 3). Thirdly, behavioral analysis is confounded by
genetic background [50]. Although all the mice used were
generated and/or kept under the background of C57BL/6,
there are subtle behavioral differences even among C57BL/
6 substrains [51]. We therefore used the mice after back-
crossing with C57BL/6J, though the number of generations
might not be enough to rule out a possible effect of sub-
strains. Finally, the results in calcium retention capacity are
not consistent with previous studies that showed a loss of
Ant1 causing an increase in calcium retention capacity [52].
This discrepancy might be due to differences in experi-
mental conditions or mouse strains.
In summary, our current findings suggest that mito-
chondrial dysfunction caused by heterozygous loss of Ant1
can cause alterations of serotonergic activity, a first step
toward understanding the complex neurobiological pro-
cesses underlying bipolar disorder subtypes.
