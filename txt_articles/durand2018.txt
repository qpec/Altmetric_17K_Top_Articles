Background: Given the high mortality rate for patients with
end-stage kidney disease receiving dialysis and the efficacy and
safety of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments, discarded kidneys
from HCV-infected donors may be a neglected public health
resource.
Objective: To determine the tolerability and feasibility of using
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) as prophylaxis before and after
kidney transplantation from HCV-infected donors to non–HCV-
infected recipients (that is, HCV D+/R� transplantation).
Design: Open-label nonrandomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT02781649)
Setting: Single center.
Participants: 10 HCV D+/R� kidney transplant candidates older
than 50 years with no available living donors.
Intervention: Transplantation of kidneys from deceased donors
aged 13 to 50 years with positive HCV RNA and HCV antibody
test results. All recipients received a dose of grazoprevir (GZR),
100 mg, and elbasvir (EBR), 50 mg, immediately before trans-
plantation. Recipients of kidneys from donors with genotype 1
infection continued receiving GZR–EBR for 12 weeks after trans-
plantation; those receiving organs from donors with genotype 2
or 3 infection had sofosbuvir, 400 mg, added to GZR–EBR for 12
weeks of triple therapy.
Measurements: The primary safety outcome was the incidence
of adverse events related to GZR–EBR treatment. The primary
efficacy outcome was the proportion of recipients with an HCV
RNA level below the lower limit of quantification 12 weeks after
prophylaxis.
Results:
Among 10 HCV D+/R� transplant recipients, no
treatment-related adverse events occurred, and HCV RNA was
not detected in any recipient 12 weeks after treatment.
Limitation: Nonrandomized study design and a small number
of patients.
Conclusion: Pre- and posttransplantation HCV treatment was
safe and prevented chronic HCV infection in HCV D+/R– kidney
transplant recipients. If confirmed in larger studies, this strategy
should markedly expand organ options and reduce mortality for
kidney transplant candidates without HCV infection.

M
ore than 420 000 persons in the United States re-
quire hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease
(1). These patients face a high mortality rate: 169 per
1000 patient-years, compared with 30 per 1000 patient-
years for transplant recipients (1). Furthermore, the sur-
vival benefit of kidney transplant recipients is well-
established (2, 3) and persists even with the use of
kidneys from older donors with certain medical condi-
tions (4). However, a severe shortage of transplant organs
exists. Depending on geography, waiting times for kidney
transplantation may be as long as 10 years, and it is esti-
mated that more than 50% of candidates on the waiting
list will die before receiving a transplant (5, 6). Thus, ex-
pansion of the donor pool would have a significant public
health benefit.
Kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C vi-
rus (HCV) infection are underutilized. In the United
States, between 2005 and 2014, a total of 2698 kidneys
recovered from HCV-infected donors intended for
transplantation were discarded (7). A national study
demonstrated that kidneys from HCV-infected donors
are 2.9 times more likely to be discarded than kidneys
of the same quality from non–HCV-infected donors, de-
spite providing a survival benefit compared with re-
maining on dialysis (8). The excess discarding may
partly result from the lack of HCV-infected transplant
candidates as well as the increase in deceased donors
with HCV infection, probably because of the epidemic
of drug overdose deaths (9–11). Donors with HCV gen-
erally are young and have few other medical comorbid
conditions, and kidney transplantation outcomes from
these donors have been excellent (12).
In the past, transmission of HCV from donor to re-
cipient was a serious concern. However, the landscape
of HCV changed in 2013 with the introduction of direct-
acting antiviral (DAA) agents with high cure rates, even
in kidney transplant recipients (13–17). In 2015, the
once-daily, fixed-dose combination of the NS3/4A pro-
tease inhibitor grazoprevir (GZR) and the NS5A inhibi-
tor elbasvir (EBR) was approved for use in persons with
impaired renal function and HCV genotype 1 and 4 in-
fection (18). For genotype 2 and 3 infection, the NS5B
inihibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) is highly active (19). Addi-

 tional trials demonstrated the efficacy of GZR–EBR com-
bined with SOF for genotype 3 infection (20, 21).
Because of these developments, interest has been
growing in the use of organs from HCV-infected donors
for transplantation to non–HCV-infected recipients (that
is, HCV D+/R� transplantation) (7, 22, 23). The objective
of our study was to explore a strategy to prevent HCV
infection in noninfected recipients of kidneys from
HCV-infected donors. As such, we investigated the fea-
sibility and tolerability of GZR–EBR with or without SOF
prophylaxis in an open-label single-center trial at Johns
Hopkins University (EXPANDER [Exploring Renal Trans-
plants Using Hepatitis C Infected Donors for HCV-
Negative Recipients]; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02781649).
METHODS
Study Population
Kidney transplant candidates on the deceased-
donor transplant waiting list at Johns Hopkins Hospital
(JHH) aged at least 50 years were eligible if they were
receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or had had
a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 15 mL/min/
1.73 m2 for at least 90 days. Candidates had to have
negative results on HCV antibody and RNA testing and
no HCV risk factors besides receiving hemodialysis. Eligi-
ble candidates could not have any living donors available
and must not have received a solid organ transplant pre-
viously. Candidates could not be listed for multiorgan
transplantation or a blood type–incompatible transplanta-
tion. Candidates were ineligible if they had HIV infection;
active hepatitis B virus infection; cirrhosis; or a history of
liver disease, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
Study Design
After providing written informed consent, partici-
pants were listed with the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) with the status of “willing to accept an
HCV+ organ.” The JHH transplant team then received
offers from UNOS of kidneys from HCV-infected donors
according to standard allocation policies. Eligible do-
nors had to be between 13 and 50 years of age and
have a positive result on a qualitative HCV nucleic acid
test performed by the local Organ Procurement Orga-
nization (OPO) in accordance with standard UNOS pol-
icy. Other donor inclusion criteria were terminal serum
creatinine level less than 265 μmol/L (3 mg/dL), pro-
jected cold ischemia time less than 36 hours, and pre-
implantation renal biopsy showing no evidence of
chronic histologic changes in the donor kidney.
The OPOs performed donor HCV antibody and
qualitative HCV nucleic acid testing using a U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assay in ac-
cordance with UNOS-mandated deceased-donor test-
ing. The results were available at the time of organ
offer. Donor serum HCV RNA quantification and geno-
typing were performed in parallel with the transplanta-
tion, and results were available within 7 days of the
procedure. Hepatitis C virus RNA was quantified by us-
ing the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test,
version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems), or cobas HCV
for cobas 6800 (Roche Molecular Systems) (lower limit
of quantification [LLOQ] for both tests, 15 IU/mL). Hep-
atitis C virus genotyping was performed with a line
probe assay (Quest Diagnostics), with reflex testing for
NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at po-
sitions 28, 30, 31, and 93 if genotype 1a was identified.
Grazoprevir, 100 mg, and EBR, 50 mg, were admin-
istered orally to participants while they waited to go to
the operating room for the donor kidneys. Postexpo-
sure prophylaxis after HCV D+/R� transplantation var-
ied according to the results of donor HCV testing. For
recipients of kidneys from donors infected with HCV
genotype 1a without NS5a RASs, genotype 1b, or ge-
notype 4, GZR–EBR treatment was continued daily for
12 weeks. For recipients of organs from donors with
genotype 1a infection with NS5a RASs, ribavirin was
added to the GZR–EBR regimen for 16 weeks. For re-
cipients of kidneys from donors infected with genotype
2 or 3, SOF, 400 mg/d, was added to the GZR–EBR
regimen and continued for 12 weeks from the start of
SOF treatment. If the donor'
s genotype could not be
determined because of insufficient viral load, treatment
with GZR–EBR alone was continued for 12 weeks.
Recipients were given induction immunosuppres-
sion with intravenous methylprednisolone and intrave-
nous rabbit antithymocyte globulin, followed by mainte-

Prophylaxis for other posttransplantation infections in-
cluded trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis
jirovecii pneumonia, valganciclovir for cytomegalovirus
infection in recipients who had cytomegalovirus sero-
positivity or received a kidney from a donor with cyto-
megalovirus seropositivity, and clotrimazole for oral
candidiasis.
Recipient Clinical Assessments
Other on-treatment assessments, performed at 1- to
4-week intervals, included physical examination, review of
medications and safety assessments, and evaluation of re-
nal and liver function and hemoglobin levels. Glomerular
filtration rate was calculated by using the Chronic Kid-
ney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (24).
Posttreatment evaluation included safety assessments
through the 12th week after treatment.
Recipient Virologic Assessment and Treatment
Response
Recipient serum HCV RNA was measured with the
COBAS Ampliprep TaqMan HCV Test, version 2.0, on
day 0 before transplantation; on postoperative day 1;
and at treatment weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 through the
end of treatment. The LLOQ was 15 IU/mL. After treat-
ment, serum HCV RNA was measured at follow-up
weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. For recipients of kidneys from
donors with HCV genotype 2 or 3, treatment week cor-
responds to week of treatment with the 3-drug combi-
nation (GZR–EBR + SOF).
Recipient Immunologic Assessments
Recipient HCV antibody testing was performed
with the Advia Centaur system (Siemens) at baseline
and follow-up week 12.
Hepatitis C virus–specific CD8+ T-cell responses
were evaluated by interferon (IFN)-� enzyme-linked im-
munospot assay using a matrix of 73 peptides corre-
sponding to previously described optimal cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte epitopes, predominantly for genotype 1,
with each peptide pool containing 7 to 12 peptides (25).
In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sepa-
rated by using the Ficoll–Hypaque method. Enzyme-
linked immunospot plates were coated with 5 μg/mL of
anti-human IFN-� monoclonal antibody (mAb; Mabtech)
and kept at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed
and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium for 2 hours at
37 °C, then 2 × 105 peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were plated with 1 of 22 HCV peptide pools or control
peptides against cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus,
and influenza at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. The
plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 to 20 hours in
a humidified incubator at 5% carbon dioxide. The
following day, the plates were washed 7 times with
phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-
Aldrich). Detection antibody (biotinylated mouse anti-
human IFN-� mAb [Mabtech]) was added at a final con-
centration of 0.5 μg/mL, and the plates were kept at room
temperature for 2 hours. They were then washed 4 times
as described earlier, alkaline phosphatase–conjugated
antibiotin mAb (Vector Laboratories) was added, and they
were kept at room temperature for 2 hours. The plates
were developed with NBT/BCIP Substrate Solution (Ther-
moFisher Scientific), and spots were counted by using the
AID iSpot Spectrum (Advanced Imaging Devices). Only
pools in which HCV-specific responses were greater than
50 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells were considered positive.
Statistical Analysis
The primary safety end point was the incidence of
adverse events related to DAA treatment. The primary
efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with
an HCV RNA level less than LLOQ at follow-up week 12
among all participants who were enrolled and received
study drugs. We used the Fisher exact test to deter-
mine whether high donor HCV RNA levels (>10 000 IU/
mL) were associated with recipient HCV antibody re-
sponses at follow-up week 8. We used a 2-sided � of
0.05 to indicate a statistically significant difference. All

 statistical analyses were performed by using Stata 14
SE (StataCorp).
Study Oversight
This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins
Medicine Institutional Review Board and conducted in
compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The
FDA reviewed the study and granted it an investiga-
tional new drug application exemption.
Role of the Funding Source
The study drugs and funding were provided by
Merck Sharp & Dohme. The investigators designed
the study, conducted the protocol, and wrote the
manuscript.
RESULTS
Recipient Characteristics
Fifteen candidates on the deceased-donor trans-
plantation waiting list at JHH were approached for the
study; the first 10 to consent were enrolled in the trial
and received kidney transplants from donors with HCV
infection. Median age of recipients was 71 years (inter-
quartile range, 65 to 72 years) (Table 1). Eight recipi-
ents were men, and 8 were white. Median time on the
waiting list before study enrollment was 4.2 months (in-
terquartile range, 0.9 to 18.3 months); median time to
transplantation after enrollment was 1 month (inter-
quartile range, 0.7 to 2.0 months) (Table 1).
Donor Characteristics
Median age of accepted HCV-infected donors
was 30 years (interquartile range, 23 to 35 years)
(Table 1). Five donors were women, and all were
white. The donors had brain death due to drug over-
dose (n = 6), trauma (n = 3), or a cardiovascular event
(n = 1). The median Kidney Donor Profile Index score
(on a scale from 0% to 100%, with higher values indi-
cating a greater predicted risk for graft failure of an
individual kidney) was 45% (interquartile range, 41% to
50%) (Table 1). All donor kidneys were considered ac-
ceptable for transplantation on the basis of biopsy find-
ings, including the absence of significant chronic histo-
logic changes (Appendix Table 1, available at Annals
.org). Two donors (3 and 5) had received massive
transfusions and had samples for HCV testing that met
hemodilution criteria based on an FDA-approved cal-
culation. Three of the organs (from donors 1, 6, and 10)
underwent pulsatile perfusion at the local OPO after
recovery from the donors and before being trans-
ported to JHH for transplantation. One donor kidney
was from the local OPO, 1 kidney was from an OPO
within the same UNOS region, and 8 kidneys were from
OPOs outside the region.
Donor HCV Testing
Results of HCV antibody screening (Table 2) and
qualitative HCV nucleic acid testing with approved
UNOS assays were positive in all 10 donors. Donor 3
had an HCV RNA that was not detected with subse-
quent quantitative HCV RNA testing; samples from this
donor met criteria for hemodilution because the donor
received massive transfusions before testing. Among
the 9 donors with detectable viral loads, median HCV
load was 62 400 IU/mL (range, 104 to 4 645 289 IU/mL)
(Table 2). Donor HCV genotypes were 1a (n = 3), mixed
1a–3 (n = 1), and 2 (n = 2); in 4 cases, HCV genotype
could not be determined because of insufficient HCV
RNA levels.
Recipient HCV Treatment
Each of the 10 candidates received 1 dose of GZR–
EBR while waiting to go to the operating room for the
donor organ. The median time between the first GZR–
EBR dose and reperfusion of the transplanted kidney
was 5.1 hours (interquartile range, 3.5 to 7.7 hours).
Seven recipients completed treatment with only GZR–
EBR daily for 12 weeks, because their donors were in-
fected with wild-type HCV genotype 1a or had a geno-
type that was unknown because of an insufficient HCV
RNA level. Because no NS5A RASs were detected,
none of the recipients needed to have ribavirin added
to their treatment. Three recipients had SOF added to
their GZR–EBR regimen after their donors' HCV infec-
tion was identified as non–genotype 1 or 4. None of the
recipients required a delay in SOF treatment or modi-
fication in SOF dosage. Specifically, SOF therapy was
initiated on postoperative day 12 in recipient 4, whose
donor had mixed genotype 1a/3; on postoperative day
6 in recipient 8, whose donor had genotype 2; and on
postoperative day 9 in recipient 7, whose donor had
genotype 3 infection. Treatment continued with SOF in
combination with GZR–EBR for an additional 12 weeks
after initiation of SOF therapy. No recipient had a DAA-
related adverse event.

 Recipient On-Treatment and Follow-up
HCV RNA
Seven of 10 recipients had an HCV RNA level be-
low the LLOQ (15 IU/mL) at all time points (Table 2 and
Figure 1). Two recipients had low levels of HCV RNA
detected within 24 hours of transplantation (postoper-
ative day 1) and undetectable HCV RNA at all other
time points. Both of those recipients had donors with
wild-type genotype 1a infection and HCV RNA loads
greater than 1 million IU/mL (4.65 × 106 and 1.1 × 106
IU/mL, respectively). One patient received a kidney
from a donor with HCV genotype 2 infection and began
SOF treatment on postoperative day 6. This recipient
had an HCV RNA load of 136 IU/mL on postoperative
day 1 and 55 IU/mL at treatment week 1, with undetect-
able HCV RNA at all other time points during treatment.
In all 10 recipients, HCV RNA was not detected at any of
the follow-up visits after treatment with GZR–EBR with
or without SOF. No participant had virologic or clinical
evidence of chronic HCV infection.
Recipient Renal and Liver Function
The median creatinine level at follow-up week 12
was 92.8 μmol/L (1.05 mg/dL) (range, 79.6 to 176.8
μmol/L [0.9 to 2.0 mg/dL]), and the median estimated
GFR was 63.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 (interquartile range,
47.8 to 69.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). The median cold isch-
emia time was 29 hours (interquartile range, 22.6 to
32.6 hours). Four recipients (1, 4, 5, and 10) had de-
layed graft function, defined as the need for renal re-
placement therapy in the first 7 days after transplanta-
tion. One of these recipients had a donor with HCV
genotype 2 infection and required SOF treatment. He
had a GFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the start
of SOF therapy on postoperative day 12. High-grade
proteinuria (defined as a urine protein creatinine ratio
>1 or a urine dipstick result >1+) did not develop in any
of the recipients during HCV prophylaxis through 6
months after transplantation (Appendix Table 2,
available at Annals.org). No recipient had acute re-
jection or required a kidney biopsy for any reason
during follow-up.
One participant (recipient 4) had elevated amino-
transferase levels 5 times greater than the upper limit of
normal (Figure 2) but no associated clinical symptoms.
The patient'
s peak aspartate aminotransferase level
was 109 U/L (postoperative day 9) and peak alanine
aminotransferase level was 214 U/L (postoperative day
7); both levels decreased to the normal range by post-
operative day 14 without any intervention. The donor'
s
HCV RNA level was 46 733 IU/mL, the donor had mixed
genotype 1a/3, and HCV RNA was detected in the re-
cipient only on postoperative day 1 (<LLOQ). Sofosbu-
vir was added to the GZR–EBR regimen on postopera-
tive day 12. Bilirubin levels remained within normal
limits. No other recipient had an increase in amino-
transferase or bilirubin levels during study follow-up.
None of the recipients required reoperation during
the study period. Recipient 3 had a distal ureteral stric-
ture that required management with a percutaneous
nephroureteral stent on postoperative day 30, followed
by serial balloon ureteroplasty and eventual stent
removal.
Recipient HCV Antibody Responses
All recipients had negative HCV antibody test re-
sults at baseline. Five recipients had reactive HCV
antibody test results at follow-up week 12, and 5 did
not (Table 2). For those who had reactive HCV anti-
body responses, the corresponding donor HCV ge-
notypes were undetermined (n = 1), 1a (n = 2), 2 (n =
1), and 3 (n = 1). The median mean donor HCV RNA
level for these recipients was 1.14 × 106 IU/mL, com-
pared with 467 U/L IU/mL for those with nonreactive
HCV antibody test results. Six HCV+/R� transplanta-
tions involved donors with an HCV RNA level above
10 000 IU/mL. No statistically significant association
was found between donor HCV RNA levels greater
than 10 000 IU/mL or HCV RNA detected in recipi-

 ents at postoperative day 1 and HCV antibody sero-
conversion among recipients at follow-up week 8
(P > 0.50).
HCV T-Cell Responses
The development of T cells that recognize new
HCV epitopes has provided a sensitive method to mea-
sure HCV replication, even in the absence of viremia,
and that may be used to detect infection, reinfection,
and superinfection (26). Using a previously described
technique (25), we tested peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells from all recipients for responses to 73 opti-
mal HCV peptides in pools of 7 to 12 each. A positive
response to a peptide pool was defined as the pres-
ence of more than 50 IFN-� spot-forming units per mil-
lion cells. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were tested for responses to a mitogen and a pool
of cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and influenza
peptides. Responses to the mitogen and cytomegalo-
virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and influenza peptide pools
were observed in all participants, demonstrating that
posttransplantation immunosuppression did not com-
pletely inhibit T-cell responses. Four recipients had no
positive response to HCV pools at either baseline or
follow-up week 8 (Figure 3). A peptide pool was found
in 3 recipients at treatment week 8 that had not been
recognized before transplantation, potentially indicat-
ing new responses. We could not resolve the new re-
sponses to the individual peptides within each positive
pool because of limited numbers of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. Overall, these data suggest that
HCV T-cell responses may have developed in 3 trans-
plant recipients and not in the other 7, with no change
or increase in the HCV pools recognized.
DISCUSSION
This single-center, open-label, pilot study evaluated
the transplantation of kidneys from HCV-infected donors
to 10 non-HCV-infected recipients, with DAAs used as
pre- and posttransplantation prophylaxis. The median
wait time from study entry to transplantation was 1 month.
No treatment-related adverse events occurred. Chronic
HCV infection did not develop in any of the recipients.
In 2012, Flohr and colleagues (27) reported the use
of kidneys from 13 donors with HCV antibody positivity
for transplantation to older non–HCV-infected recipi-
ents with no HCV treatment. Donor-to-recipient HCV
transmission occurred in 7 of the 13 cases (54%); these
7 recipients had a high rate of transaminitis (6 of 7),
with 1 HCV-related liver death occurring 5 months after
transplantation. In this series, results from donor HCV
nucleic acid testing were not available, so some donors
might not have had active HCV infection.
More recently, with the advent of IFN-free DAAs,
Goldberg and colleagues (28) performed HCV D+/
R� transplantation in the THINKER (Transplanting Hepa-
titis C Kidneys Into Negative Kidney Recipients) trial, an
single-group, open-label, pilot study of GZR–EBR as
preemptive treatment for HCV in non–HCV-infected pa-
tients receiving kidneys from donors with HCV geno-
type 1 infection. In this study, the recipients were mon-
itored for HCV viremia starting at postoperative day 3.
Once HCV RNA was detected, GZR–EBR treatment was
initiated for a 12-week course. Donor-to-recipient HCV
transmission occurred in 100% of recipients, with 2
cases of elevated aminotransferase levels. However, all
recipients eventually achieved a sustained virologic re-
sponse, at week 12 after treatment.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to explore a
strategy of DAA treatment as pre- and postexposure
prophylaxis for HCV D+/R� transplantation. This ap-
proach was safe and effective in preventing chronic
HCV infection in all our recipients. Moreover, it may
also have prevented acute HCV infection in some pa-
tients. In our study, 5 recipients never had a detectable
level of plasma HCV RNA, 4 had a low level only on post-
operative day 1, and 1 had a low level detected up to 1
week after transplantation. No symptoms or clinical con-
sequences were observed in patients with low-level
viremia (peak, 136 IU/mL). Preventing acute viral hepatitis
early after transplantation is ideal, because many kidney
transplant recipients receive lymphocyte-depleting induc-
tion immunosuppression.
Our study design allowed us to use organs from
donors infected with any HCV genotype and did not
require additional virologic or genotypic assays at the
time of organ offer and allocation. Three donors in our
study were found to have non–genotype 1 infection,
which is consistent with trends in the HCV epidemic
among young persons who inject opiates in the United
States (29, 30). In THINKER, 50% of potential kidney do-
nors were excluded because of non–genotype 1 HCV in-
fection, which was detected by using a rapid genotype
assay (31). The potential for a high rate of organ discard-
ing and the limited availability of rapid genotype testing
represent may limit this approach.

The number of positive peptide pools identified for each recipient
before transplantation and at FW8 is shown. T-cell responses were
measured by interferon-� enzyme-linked immunospot using a matrix
of 6 peptide pools containing overlapping peptides of optimal cyto-
toxic T-lymphocyte HCV epitopes. Pools with more than 50 spot-
forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
considered positive. FW = follow-up week; HCV = hepatitis C virus.

 All donors in our study were relatively young and
white; 6 had died of drug overdose, reflecting the na-
tional opioid epidemic. Of note, only 3 of the 10 do-
nors had HCV genotype 1a infection. Four donors had
very low HCV RNA levels with an indeterminate geno-
type. In the case of donor 3, the qualitative HCV RNA
result may have been a false-positive, or the quantita-
tive HCV RNA result may have been a false-negative
due to hemodilution, because this donor received mas-
sive transfusions before testing. The 3 donors who had
low but quantifiable HCV RNA levels may have aquired
HCV infection only recently. Studies of the acute-phase
hepatitis C viral dynamics among injection drug users
demonstrate intermittent low-level viremia as well as
periods of undetectable viremia in this early stage
(32, 33).
We performed several virologic and immunologic
studies to further explore whether our pre- and post-
treatment strategy truly prevented infection or whether
it simply treated an established early infection. Only 5
recipients ever had HCV RNA detected after transplan-
tation, and at very low levels (peak, 136 IU/mL), which
arguably might represent viral transfer from the donor
kidney rather than production of new HCV particles
from the recipient'
s liver. However, we detected new
HCV antibody responses in 5 of 10 recipients. An HCV
antibody response did not correlate with donor HCV
genotype, donor HCV RNA level, or the presence of
low-level HCV viremia in recipients after transplanta-
tion; however, our sample size was small. Whether
these antibodies indicate infection of the recipient'
s
liver or a response to virus or antigen carried over with
the donor organ is unclear. Three recipients had an
increased T-cell responses to HCV peptide pools; how-
ever, these recipients all had positive T-cell responses
detected before transplantation, indicating that these
responses may have been cross-reactive rather than
specific to HCV. We could not resolve the pools into
individual peptides because of a limited number of pe-
ripheral blood mononuclear cells, which made it diffi-
cult to determine whether responses to new T-cell
epitopes developed that would have provided stron-
ger evidence that HCV replication occurred in the re-
cipients. In the end, it is difficult to conclude whether
our strategy functioned as true prevention in all recipients
or as very early treatment of HCV infection. Nonetheless,
our prophylactic approach to HCV D+/R� transplantation
represents an alternative to delaying treatment until viral
replication has increased to levels necessary to detect
viremia.
Our study had limitations. It was a single-center
nonrandomized trial with a small number of partici-
pants. Transplant recipients were older, predominantly
male, and white; however, on the basis of other DAA
trials, there is no reason to believe that this strategy
would be less effective in other age groups, women, or
members of other racial groups. For our studies of HCV
T-cell responses, we could not resolve individual pep-
tides recognized within each pool because of limited
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
In
conclusion,
this
open-label
nonrandomized
study showed that DAA prophylaxis for non–HCV-
infected recipients of kidneys from HCV-infected do-
nors was safe and well-tolerated. No treatment-related
adverse events or cases of chronic HCV occurred. This
strategy should be studied further in carefully moni-
tored clinical trials. If confirmed in larger studies, this
approach should markedly expand organ options and
reduce mortality for kidney transplant candidates with-
out HCV infection.
