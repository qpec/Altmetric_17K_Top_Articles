BACKGROUND
Approximately 75% of objective responses to anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1) ther-
apy in patients with melanoma are durable, lasting for years, but delayed relapses 
have been noted long after initial objective tumor regression despite continuous 
therapy. Mechanisms of immune escape in this context are unknown.
METHODS
We analyzed biopsy samples from paired baseline and relapsing lesions in four pa-
tients with metastatic melanoma who had had an initial objective tumor regression 
in response to anti–PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) followed by disease progression 
months to years later.
RESULTS
Whole-exome sequencing detected clonal selection and outgrowth of the acquired 
resistant tumors and, in two of the four patients, revealed resistance-associated loss-
of-function mutations in the genes encoding interferon-receptor–associated Janus 
kinase 1 (JAK1) or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), concurrent with deletion of the wild-type 
allele. A truncating mutation in the gene encoding the antigen-presenting protein 
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was identified in a third patient. JAK1 and JAK2 truncat-
ing mutations resulted in a lack of response to interferon gamma, including insen-
sitivity to its antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. The B2M truncating mutation 
led to loss of surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in patients with 
melanoma was associated with defects in the pathways involved in interferon-receptor 
signaling and in antigen presentation. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health 
and others.)

D
urable responses in metastatic 
cancers have been achieved with a variety 
of immunotherapies such as interleukin-2, 
adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lym-
phocytes, antibodies that block cytotoxic T-lym-
phocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA4),1-5 and anti-
bodies that block programmed death 1 (PD-1).6-10 
However, in a recent study, approximately 25% 
of patients with melanoma who had had an ob-
jective response to PD-1 blockade therapy had 
disease progression at a median follow-up of 21 
months.11
The mechanisms of immune-resistant cancer 
progression are mostly unknown. Previous studies 
involving humans examined the loss of beta-2- 
microglobulin as a mechanism of acquired resis-
tance to several forms of cancer immunother-
apy.12-14 In preclinical models, defects in the 
interferon signaling pathway have been proposed 
as a potential mechanism of cancer escape (in-
sensitivity) to immunotherapy.15,16 In the current 
study, we assessed the effect of anti–PD-1 therapy 
on cancer genomic evolution, including acquired 
mutations in the genes affecting the interferon 
pathway and antigen-presentation pathway, in 
an effort to determine genetic mechanisms of 
acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy.
Methods
Patients, Response Assessment, and Tumor 
Biopsies
Of 78 patients with metastatic melanoma who 
were treated with the anti–PD-1 antibody pem-
brolizumab at the University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA), 42 had an objective response, of 
whom 15 went on to have disease progression. 
Four of these 15 patients met all three selection 
criteria for this analysis. First, they must have 
had an objective tumor response while partici-
pating in a clinical trial with single-agent pem-
brolizumab.6,7,10,11 Tumor responses were evalu-
ated at 12 weeks and confirmed 4 weeks later, 
and patients were assessed by imaging every 12 
weeks thereafter with the use of both the Re-
sponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors17 and 
the immune-related response criteria.18 Second, 
patients had to have late acquired resistance, de-
fined as in situ recurrence or new lesion devel-
opment, despite continuous dosing, after more 
than 6 months of tumor response. Third, patients 
had to have adequate biopsy material for whole-
exome sequencing at two time points: before the 
initiation of pembrolizumab therapy and after 
disease progression. We processed tumor biopsy 
samples as described previously to perform path-
ological analyses, obtain DNA and RNA, and 
attempt to establish cell lines.19,20
Immunohistochemical, Immunofluorescence, 
Western Blot, and Flow-Cytometric Analyses
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence 
analyses19 as well as Western blot and flow-cyto-
metric analyses21 were performed and analyzed 
as described previously. Full methods are includ-
ed in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Genetic and Transcriptional-Profiling 
Analyses
Whole-exome sequencing was performed at the 
UCLA Clinical Microarray Core with the use of the 
NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library, 
version 3.0 (Roche). Mutation calling was per-
formed as described previously.22 Selected gene-
expression profiling on interferon exposure was 
performed with the use of nCounter (NanoString 
Technologies). Whole-exome sequencing data 
have been deposited in the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Ar-
chive under the accession number SRP076315.
Functional Studies
Patient-derived and previously established human 
melanoma cell lines were used to analyze recog-
nition by T-cell receptor transgenic T cells23 with 
the use of in vitro coculture assays that detect 
antigen-induced release of interferon-γ assessed 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell-
proliferation and growth-inhibition assays were 
performed with the use of an automated live-cell 
imaging system (IncuCyte, Essen BioScience) with 
or without exposure to interferons. Full methods 
are described in the Supplementary Appendix.
Study Oversight
Data generated and collected by the study inves-
tigators were analyzed by the last author, who

data, analyses, and reported results. Summaries 
of the clinical protocol have been reported by

Acquired Resistance to PD-1 Blockade
 
Statistical Analysis
Student’s t-test and a two-way analysis of vari-
ance were used for cell-culture experiments, 
with Dunnett’s correction applied for multiple 
comparisons with untreated controls.
 
Results
 
Clinical Course and Immune Infiltrates
We analyzed paired tumor samples from four 
(nonconsecutive) selected patients with meta-
static melanoma who had had a relapse while 
receiving PD-1–inhibition therapy with pembro-
lizumab (Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). All four patients met objective criteria 
for a partial response,17,18 though with slightly 
different kinetics (Fig. 1, and Figs. S1, S2, and S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean time 
to relapse was 624 days (range, 419 to 888). The 
baseline biopsy samples were obtained just be-
fore the initiation of pembrolizumab therapy in 
Patients 2, 3, and 4, whereas for Patient 1, the 
only available baseline biopsy sample was ob-
tained before an earlier course of therapy with 
the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. The baseline 
biopsy samples from Patients 1, 2, and 3 showed 
preexisting CD8 T-cell infiltrates at the invasive 
margin that colocalized with programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on surrounding 
macrophages and melanoma cells (Fig. 1B, and 
Figs. S1B and S2B in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The biopsy samples obtained at the time 
of response in Patients 2, 3, and 4 showed a 
marked increase in intratumoral CD8 T-cell in-
Figure 1. Clinical Pattern of Acquired Resistance to Anti–Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) Therapy in Patient 1.
In Panel A, computed tomographic images show a melanoma small-bowel metastasis at baseline, at the time of maximum response, 
and at the time of an in situ relapse after a year of minimal residual disease; the red dots in the graph on the right indicate these three 
time points. Immunohistochemical staining and multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis showed abundant CD8 T-cell infiltrates and 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at baseline and again at the time of relapse at the tumor margin in Panels B and C, respec-
tively. In the immunofluorescence images, red indicates PD-L1, yellow CD8 T cells, light blue the melanoma marker S100 (cytoplasmic 
staining), and dark blue the melanoma marker Sox10 (nuclear staining).

filtrates (Figs. S1C, S2C, and S3C and Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix; no biopsy sam-
ple during therapy was available for Patient 1). At 
the time of relapse, all four biopsy samples 
showed CD8 T-cell infiltration and PD-L1 ex-
pression concentrated at the tumor margins 
again (Fig. 1C, and Figs. S1D, S2D, and S3D in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Multiplex immu-
nofluorescence assays revealed that melanoma 
cells at the time of relapse in Patients 1 and 2 
were negative for PD-L1 even when directly adja-
cent to T cells, whereas macrophages and stro-
mal cells were positive for PD-L1.
Genetic Changes in Relapse Biopsy Samples
The pattern of a strong initial response, long 
dormancy, and rapid late progression led us to 
hypothesize that relapse in these patients re-
sulted from immune-mediated clonal selection 
and tumor outgrowth.24 To identify mutations 
that might confer immune resistance, we ex-
tracted DNA from bulk-tumor biopsy samples or 
early-passage primary cell lines (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) and performed whole-
exome sequencing to compare baseline and 
matched relapsed tissues. We achieved a median 
coverage of 149×, and the percent of tumor cells 
(as compared with stromal cells) was more than 
40% in all samples (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Nonsynonymous mutations for 
all samples are shown in Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
JAK Mutations with Concurrent Loss  
of Heterozygosity at Relapse
We found strong evidence that the relapsed tu-
mors were closely genetically related to their 
baseline counterparts, despite up to 2 years be-
tween biopsies. In the case of Patients 1 and 2, 
of 1173 and 240 nonsynonymous mutations, re-
spectively, originally identified in the baseline 
sample, 92.5% and 95.8% were also seen in the 
resistant tumor (Fig. 2A, and Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The relapsing tumors 
also contained the same chromosomal loss-of-
heterozygosity events as the baseline tumors, 
and all differences were due to further loss in 
the relapse samples. In the relapse biopsy sam-
ples from both patients, we identified new homo-
zygous loss-of-function mutations in the kinases 
associated with the interferon-receptor pathway, 
with a Q503* nonsense mutation in the gene 
encoding Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) in Patient 1 (Fig. 
2A and 2B) and a F547 splice-site mutation in 
the gene encoding Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in Pa-
tient 2 (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
RNA sequencing showed that the JAK2 splice-
site mutation caused intron inclusion, producing 
an in-frame stop codon 10 bp after exon 12 (Fig. 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Therefore, 
both mutations were upstream of the kinase 
domains and probably truncated the protein or 
caused nonsense-mediated decay. Neither muta-
tion was seen at baseline in the exome sequenc-
ing reads, by Sanger sequencing, or by targeted 
amplicon resequencing (Fig. S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
The JAK2 mutation was the only homozygous 
mutation (adjusted variant allele frequency, >85%) 
of 76 new nonsynonymous mutations in Patient 
2, and the JAK1 mutation was 1 of only 3 homo-
zygous mutations among 53 new mutations in 
Patient 1 (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). To become homozygous, both JAK muta-
tions were acquired in the context of a copy-
number–neutral nondisjunction event, resulting 
in loss of the wild-type chromosome and dupli-
cation of the mutated allele. This is seen clearly 
in Patient 1: at relapse, chromosome 1p (contain-
ing JAK1) showed a decrease in minor-allele fre-
quencies for germline single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms relative to baseline (Fig. S7 in the 
Figure 2 (facing page). Acquired JAK1 Loss-of-Function 
Mutation at Relapse, with Accompanying Loss  
of Heterozygosity.
In Panel A, a Circos plot25 of Patient 1 shows differences 
in whole-exome sequencing between the pre-pembroli-
zumab and post-relapse biopsies. The red circle high-
lights a new, high-allele-frequency, relapse-specific 
mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) 
in the context of chromosomal loss of heterozygosity 
(asterisk). Each wedge represents a chromosome. In 
the outer track (black background), each point repre-
sents a nonsynonymous mutation, with most detected 
in both biopsy samples (gray) rather than at relapse 
only (red) or baseline only (green). The y-axis position 
indicates the variant allele frequency (VAF) at relapse, 
unless baseline-specific. The middle and inner tracks 
show copy-number status for the baseline and relapse 
biopsy, respectively; dark green in the subtrack indicates 
loss of heterozygosity. In Panel B, Integrative Genomics 
Viewer (IGV) plots (top) show that the JAK1 Q503* non-
sense mutation is relapse-specific, and the cBioPortal26 
diagram (bottom) shows that the JAK1 mutation is up-
stream of the kinase domains.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Supplementary Appendix), was missing 36 hetero-
zygous baseline mutations (presumably on the 
lost allele), and contained 20 mutations (presum-
ably on the amplified allele) that became homo-
zygous (adjusted variant allele frequency, >85%, 
with change of >35 percentage points from base-
line). A similar loss-of-heterozygosity event oc-
curred for chromosome 9 in Patient 2 (Fig. S8 
and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Together, these data suggest that the tumors 
resistant to anti–PD-1 are a relatively homoge-
nous population derived directly from the base-
line tumor and that acquisition of the JAK muta-
tions was an early founder event before clonal 
selection and relapse despite the fact that the 
mutation was not detected in pretreatment tumor 
tissue.
Functional Effects of JAK2 Mutation
To assess the functional consequences of the 
observed JAK mutations, we focused on the JAK2 
mutation from Patient 2 using two cell lines es-
tablished at baseline (M420, wild-type JAK2) and 
at the time of relapse (M464, JAK2 F547 splice-
site mutation). Whole-exome sequencing con-
firmed that the original bulk tumor was well 
represented by M464 (Fig. S9 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Western blot analysis showed 
that the baseline cell line responded to interferon 
alfa, beta, and gamma with the expected signal 
transduction, including an increase in signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression, 
STAT1 phosphorylation (pSTAT1), and the pro-
duction of downstream interferon targets such as 
PD-L1, transporter associated with antigen pro-
cessing 1 (TAP1), and major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class I (Fig. 3A). However, the 
cell line from the progressing lesion showed a 
total loss of JAK2 protein (Fig. 3A), resulting in 
a lack of response to interferon gamma, without 
change in sensitivity to interferon alfa or beta. 
This was true of the pSTAT1 response (Fig. 3A) 
and the expression of PD-L1 and MHC class I 
molecules (Fig. 3A and 3B). The progressing cell 
line also failed to up-regulate a wider panel of 
interferon-induced transcripts involved in antigen 
presentation and T-cell chemotaxis (Fig. 3C, and 
Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). To-
gether, these data indicate a total loss of func-
tional response to interferon gamma and are 
consistent with JAK2 being required for signal-
ing through the interferon-γ receptor, as op-
posed to the interferon-α/β receptor, which uses 
TYK2 and JAK1.27-29
Loss of Interferon Gamma–Induced Growth 
Arrest through Acquired JAK Mutations
We hypothesized that inactivating JAK mutations 
may result in a functional advantage for the pro-
gressive tumors because the lack of interferon 
signaling either decreased antigen presentation 
or allowed escape from interferon-induced inhi-
bition of growth. In addition to using M420 and 
M464, we engineered the human melanoma cell 
line M407 by means of the CRISPR (clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)–
Cas9 approach to create sublines without expres-
sion of JAK1 or JAK2 (Figs. S10 and S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). These created truncat-
ing mutations analogous to those from Patients 1 
and 2, and M407 is positive for HLA-A*02:01 and 
expresses the cancer–testis antigen NY-ESO-1, 
which allowed us to model T-cell recognition 
using T cells genetically modified to express an 
NY-ESO-1–specific T-cell receptor.23 M407 and 
both JAK-loss sublines were equally recognized by 
NY-ESO-1–specific T cells, leading to high levels 
of interferon-γ production (Fig. 4A).
When cultured in recombinant interferon alfa, 
beta, or gamma, the M420 and M407 parental cell 
lines showed interferon-induced growth inhibi-
tion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S12 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). However, both the 
JAK2-deficient M464 cell line (from Patient 2 at 
relapse) and the M407 JAK2-knockout subline 
were insensitive specifically to interferon gamma–
induced growth arrest, yet remained sensitive to 
type I interferons alfa and beta; in contrast, the 
M407 JAK1-mutated subline was resistant to all 
three interferons (Fig. 4B). This is again consis-
tent with the specific association of JAK2 with 
the interferon-γ receptor and the common use of 
JAK1 by all three interferon receptors.27-29 As an 
orthogonal test of these effects, we treated our 
cell lines with 2′3′-cGAMP (cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate); this 
dinucleotide, which is produced in response to

Acquired Resistance to PD-1 Blockade
Figure 3. Loss of Interferon Gamma–Induced Signaling and Gene-Expression Changes through Acquired JAK2 Mutation.
In Panel A, Western blot analysis of lysates from cell lines M420 (Patient 2, baseline) and M464 (Patient 2, relapse) shows Janus kinase 
(JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling events and downstream target induction after either 30 minutes 
(m) or 18 hours (h) of exposure to interferon (IFN) alfa, beta, or gamma (C indicates untreated control). Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) protein 
expression was absent in the relapse cell line (asterisk), and M464 failed to phosphorylate intermediate signaling components STAT1 
and STAT3 or to up-regulate interferon-response targets TAP1, PD-L1, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I after treat-
ment specifically with interferon gamma (red box), as compared with intact signaling in M420 (blue box). There was no change in response 
to interferon alfa or beta. As shown in Panel B, a lack of response to interferon gamma exposure was also seen in surface staining for 
PD-L1 and MHC class I by flow cytometry. Each point represents an independent experiment, T bars represent standard deviations, and 
P values are for a two-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s correction. MFI denotes mean fluorescent intensity, and NS not significant. 
Panel C shows log2 RNA counts of expression for 790 immune-related genes on exposure to interferon gamma or vehicle control. The 
baseline cell line M420 (top) showed up-regulation of many interferon-stimulated genes (line represents an increase by a factor of 4), 
whereas the JAK2 mutated progression cell line M464 (bottom) lacked a similar response.

Acquired Resistance to PD-1 Blockade
cytosolic double-stranded DNA, directly activates 
the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and 
leads to interferon-β production through activa-
tion of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3).30 
After 2′3′-cGAMP treatment, we observed growth 
arrest in all cell lines independent of JAK2 status 
but no effect in the JAK1-knockout subline (Fig. 
4C). Therefore, the JAK1 and JAK2 loss-of-function 
mutations did not decrease in vitro T-cell recogni-
tion but selectively blocked the interferon-γ signal-
ing that leads to cell-growth inhibition, which 
for JAK2 loss could be corrected by type I path-
way activation or a STING agonist.
Functional Effects of Mutation in the Gene 
Encoding Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M)
In Patient 3, whole-exome sequencing of the 
baseline and progressive lesions showed a 4-bp 
S14 frame-shift deletion in exon 1 of the beta-
2-microglobulin component of MHC class I as 
1 of only 24 new relapse-specific mutations and 
the only such mutation that was homozygous 
(Fig. S13A and S13B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Immunohistochemical analysis for MHC 
class I heavy chains revealed loss of outer-mem-
brane localization as compared with adjacent 
stroma or the baseline tumor, even though dif-
fuse intracellular staining indicated continued 
production of MHC class I molecules (Fig. S14 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). This finding is 
in line with the role of beta-2-microglobulin in 
proper MHC class I folding and transport to the 
cell surface, and its deficiency has long been 
recognized as a genetic mechanism of acquired 
resistance to immunotherapy.12-14 Both the base-
line and relapse biopsy samples were negative for 
MHC class II expression (Fig. S14 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix), which suggests a lack of 
compensatory MHC up-regulation.
We could not find defined genetic alterations 
in Patient 4 that had clear potential to result in 
acquired resistance to T cells, but cancer cells in 
the baseline and relapse biopsy samples did not 
express PD-L1 despite proximity to T cells and 
PD-L1–expressing stroma (Fig. S3D in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). These findings suggest 
possible nongenetic mechanisms of altered ex-
pression of interferon-inducible genes.16
Discussion
With the approval of PD-1 checkpoint-blockade 
agents for the treatment of patients with mela-
noma, lung cancer, and other cancers, it is an-
ticipated that cases of late relapse after initial 
response will increase. Understanding the mo-
lecular mechanisms of acquired resistance by 
focused comparison of biopsy samples from 
paired baseline and relapsing lesions may open 
options for the rational design of salvage combi-
nation therapies or preventive interventions and 
may guide mechanistic biomarker studies for 
the selection of patients, before the initiation of 
treatment, who are unlikely to have a response.
Tumor-infiltrating T cells are the effectors 
that kill cancer cells during PD-1 blockade 
therapy.19,31 We found it striking that after intra-
tumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration during active re-
sponse, CD8 T cells were usually still present 
and abundant at the time of relapse, though they 
were restricted to the tumor margin. This obser-
vation suggested to us that the T cells were no 
longer able to exert their cytotoxic activity, be-
cause of either a lack of tumor antigen recogni-
tion and activation or a loss of sensitivity to their 
effector molecules by the cancer cells. The gen-
Figure 4 (facing page). Loss of Interferon Gamma–Induced 
Growth Arrest through Acquired JAK Mutations.
In Panel A, the M407 parental cell line as well as the M407 
JAK1-knockout and JAK2-knockout sublines were rec-
ognized by NY-ESO-1–specific, HLA-A*02:01–restricted 
T cells, as assessed by interferon-γ production after  
24 hours of in vitro coculture. M420 is negative for 
HLA-A*02:01 and served as a negative control. In Panel B, 
cell lines M420 and M407 showed growth inhibition in 
response to direct in vitro treatment with interferon 
alfa, beta, or gamma (left), whereas the JAK2-deficient 
counterpart M464 and the M407 JAK2 knockout were 
insensitive specifically to interferon gamma (middle). 
The M407 JAK1 knockout was insensitive to all three 
 
interferons (right). In Panel C, treatment with 2′3′-cGAMP 
(cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine mono-
phosphate), a direct cytosolic agonist of the stimulator 
of interferon genes (STING), was able to produce growth 
arrest in all cell lines, regardless of JAK2 status, yet had 
no effect in M407 with JAK1 knockout. Growth curves 
represent the percent change in the number of mela-
noma cells over time as measured by IncuCyte continuous 
live-cell imaging in one of three independent experiments. 
I bars in Panels A, B, and C indicate standard deviations 
for three replicate wells. Three asterisks indicate P<0.001 
and two asterisks P<0.01 for the percent change in 
growth with the treatment shown at the 72-hour end 
point as compared with the untreated control, with 
Dunnett’s multiple-comparison correction applied in 
Panel B. NS denotes not significant.

eral possibilities are loss of mutational or shared 
tumor antigens that are recognized by T cells, 
loss of antigen-presenting machinery components 
(e.g., beta-2-microglobulin and HLA),12-14 tumor-
cell–induced or myeloid-cell–induced inactivation 
of T-cell signaling,32,33 or insensitivity to the 
proapoptotic effects of toxic granules (e.g., per-
forin and granzymes), death receptors (e.g., Fas 
and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-
inducing ligand [TRAIL]), or interferons.34 Any 
of these escape mechanisms would be hypothe-
sized to be fostered by the selective pressure of 
CD8 attack, which would be particularly active 
during the new round of immunoediting35 that 
is unleashed after PD-1 blockade.
The inactivation of JAK1 or JAK2, as noted in 
two of the patients, may be particularly advanta-
geous to cancer cells in the context of anti–PD-1 
therapy as compared with other immunothera-
pies. The interferon-induced adaptive expression 
of PD-L1, which allows the cancer to inactivate 
adjacent CD8 T cells,36 would be of no use after 
the PD-1–PD-L1 interaction is blocked by thera-
peutic antibodies. We propose that without this 
benefit, the advantage for cancer cells tilts to-
ward abolishing interferon signaling in order to 
avoid the detrimental increase in antigen presenta-
tion and direct antiproliferative effects.27 Although 
we identified inactivating mutations in JAK1 and 
JAK2, which are receptor-level signaling bottle-
necks, interferon insensitivity through other 
means — such as epigenetic silencing of inter-
feron-signaling components as previously docu-
mented in lung-cancer and prostate-cancer cell 
lines15,16 or increased expression of negative 
regulators37 — might lead to the same end. We 
also documented one case of beta-2-microglobu-
lin inactivation, which corroborates a previously 
described mechanism of acquired resistance to 
cancer immunotherapy in humans through loss 
of this shared component of all human MHC 
class I molecules that is required for CD8 T-cell 
recognition.12-14
In conclusion, the nearly identical mechanism 
of acquisition, functional consequence, and evi-
dence of clonal selection for JAK1 or JAK2 muta-
tions in two independent cases with a similar 
clinical course of acquired resistance suggests 
that resistance to interferon gamma contributes 
to immune resistance and escape. This genetic 
alteration of immune resistance joins the pre-
viously described loss of B2M in decreasing 
immune-cell recognition of cancer cells, leading 
to acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy. 
Although we have identified four cases and 
worked out a potential mechanism of resistance 
in three of them, additional cases will need to 
be closely examined to assess the generalizabil-
ity of these findings.
