Abstract: Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), identified as a new clinical entity with distinctive features
in 1956, was originally considered as a neuromuscular disease. In 1988 the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention introduced the ill-defined concept of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). As predicted,
CFS, unjustly considered to be a synonym for ME, pushed ME to the background. To develop effective
therapies for of ME and CFS, it is essential to investigate patients with ME specifically. For that reason,
an operational definition of ME is indispensable. This article proposes an operational definition based
on the most recent formal definitions and symptoms observed in ME. ME is a multi-systemic illness,
which (1) often has a sudden onset, in most cases a respiratory and/or gastro-intestinal infection,
but a gradual or more dramatic onset is also possible; (2) has an epidemic and an endemic form;
(3) has an unique clinical pattern deviating from other post-viral states; (4) is distinguished by muscle
fatigability/prolonged muscle weakness after trivial exertion; (5) is accompanied by symptoms
relating to neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic, and sensory functions; (6) can
be accompanied by symptoms associated with cardiac and other systems; (7) is characterized by
fluctuation of symptoms (within and between “episodes”); (8) has a prolonged relapsing course;
and (9) has a tendency to become chronic. In conclusion, a discriminative definition for ME contains
four mandatory elements: (1) muscle fatigability/post-exertional muscle weakness lasting for days;
(2) operational criteria for “neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic and sensory
functions”; (3) fluctuation of symptoms; and (4) a prolonged relapsing course. This tentative definition
of ME justifies the qualification “neuromuscular disease”.

1. Introduction
Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) [1–4],
in the literature also referred to as epidemic
neuromyasthenia [5] and non-paralytic [3] or “atypical” [6] poliomyelitis, is a neuromuscular disease
which was identified as a distinct clinical entity for the first time in 1956 [7]. At that time it was
evident that muscular symptoms (e.g., paresis and myalgia) and neurological dysfunction were the
hallmark features of ME [7]. ME [1–4] has been classified as a neurological disease by the World Health
Organization (WHO) since 1969 [8,9].
In 1988 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced the ill-defined
notion of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [10]. CFS was redefined in 1994 [11]. The only mandatory
feature of CFS [11] is (unexplained) chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue must be accompanied by at least
four out of a list of eight “minor” symptoms: sore throat; tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes;
muscle pain, multi-joint pain without joint swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern,
or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 h [11]. The case

criteria for CFS [11] define a heterogeneous group of patients with chronic fatigue (accompanied by
163 different combinations of “minor” symptoms) [12,13].
ME [1–4] and CFS [11] are two completely different concepts [14]. Chronic fatigue has never been
described as a distinctive feature of ME [1–4], while muscle fatigability/prolonged post-exertional
muscle weakness and specific neurological symptoms, discriminative features of ME [1–4], are not
required to meet the diagnosis for CFS [11].
Despite the fact that ME [1–4], a typical neuromuscular disease, and CFS [11], a fatigue syndrome,
are two completely different clinical entities by definition [14], CFS [11] has pushed ME completely to
the background over the last decades. Thus, the vast majority of studies into “ME/CFS” published
since 1990 relate to patients fulfilling the case criteria for CFS [11]. The confusion with regard with
diagnosis and abnormalities which has arisen as a result of the introduction of the diagnosis of CFS
was forecasted in 1988 by the renowned ME expert Dr. Betty Dowsett, who stated “The introduction
of ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’ to designate ME does nothing to indicate the unique epidemio-logical,
geographical, clinical, and laboratory findings in ME and can only add to the confusion surrounding
the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of the condition” [2].
Due to the replacement of ME [1–4] by CFS [11], one of the last important studies investigating
ME patients dates back to 1990 [3], just prior to the death of Melvin Ramsay, the recognized authority
in ME. Dr. Ramsay was a consultant physician in infectious diseases at the Royal Free Hospital in
London (United Kingdom) during an outbreak of ME in 1955 [15]. From that date until his death
Ramsay was closely involved in ME cases.
To unravel the aetiology and pathophysiology and to develop effective therapies for ME [1–4],
it is essential to study patients with ME as described in the medical literature. For that reason an
operational definition of ME [1–4] is indispensable.
The aim of this study was to compose an operational definition of ME based on the definition
and description in the most recent relevant articles [3,4], the symptoms and signs observed in the
various epidemics (1934–1983) and endemic cases of ME [1], and the symptoms often and less-often
experienced by 420 patients with ME [3].
2. Method
The starting point of the search of an operational definition of ME are the last two formal
descriptions of ME [3,4]. As can be seen from Tables 1 and 2, the definitions of ME in these two
publications [3,4] are essentially the same. The elements were classified as symptomatic features or
characteristic features of the disease (Figure 1, Step 1). Based on the text, elements were classified as
mandatory or optional (Step 2). For example the phrase “a tendency to chronicity” [4] implies it does
not apply to all patients: it is an optional feature. This also applies to “variable involvement of cardiac
and other systems” [3].
Table 1. The most recent formal definitions of ME (1990) [3].
Definition of ME (1990)
“A syndrome commonly initiated by respiratory and/or gastro-intestinal infection but an insidious or more
dramatic onset following neurological, cardiac or endocrine disability occurs.
The pathognomonic features (of ME) are:
1.
Complaint of general or local muscular fatigue following minimal exertion with prolonged
recovery time.
2.
Neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic and sensory functions.
3.
Variable involvement of cardiac and other systems.
4.
A prolonged relapsing course.
Other characteristics include [..] a prolonged relapsing course and variation in intensity of symptoms within
and between episodes, tending to chronicity.”

“A syndrome initiated by a viral infection commonly described as a respiratory/gastro intestinal illness but a
gradual or more dramatic onset following neurological, cardiac or endocrine disability is recognised.
The cardinal features, in a patient who has previously been physically and mentally fit, with a good work
record are:
1.
Generalised or localised muscle fatigue after minimal exertion with prolonged recovery time.
2.
Neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic and sensory functions, often accompanied
by marked emotional lability and sleep reversal.
3.
Variable involvement of cardiac and other bodily systems.
4.
An extended relapsing course with a tendency to chronicity.
5.
Marked variability of symptoms both within and between episodes.”

The symptoms mentioned in epidemic and endemic cases of ME [1] were analysed and classified
(Steps 3 and 5). The symptoms and symptom categories were checked against symptoms observed in
420 patients with well-defined ME [3] (Step 4).
In Step 2a it was learnt that in addition to muscle fatigability/prolonged muscle weakness after
exertion, “neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic and sensory functions” is a
mandatory symptomatic feature in the definition of ME.
To define operational criteria, the 50 neurological symptoms mentioned in cases of ME [1,3]
were divided into five categories (Step 6): cognitive dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, sensory
dysfunction, motor dysfunction, and unclassified symptoms.
The basic assumption was that a patient should experience at least one symptom related to
cognitive dysfunction, at least one symptom related to autonomic dysfunction, and at least one
symptom associated with sensory dysfunction in order to meet the operational criteria of ME.
However, considering the frequency of the symptoms reported by 420 patients with ME [1,3] and
the number of times specific symptoms were mentioned in the description of cases of ME [16],
two changes were made (Step 7a). First, since only three symptoms observed [1,3] relate to cognitive
disturbance, and not all patients experience these three symptoms [3], it was decided that “cognitive
dysfunction” symptoms should be combined with three other symptoms often reported by patients
with ME [3] (two unclassified neurological symptoms related to sleep and headaches) in order to
meet the first operational criterion for “neurological disturbance”. Second, because symptoms related
to sensory dysfunction are diverse and this category contains various symptoms often experienced
by patients [1,3], it was decided that a patient should report at least two symptoms of the “sensory
symptoms” subcategory to meet the minimal requirement for “sensory dysfunction”.
3. Results
3.1. Characteristics
3.1.1. An Epidemic and an Endemic Form
ME has been described in the medical literature since 1936 [6]. This was often on account
of outbreaks [5,17], the two most well-known being the epidemic in Akureyri district in Iceland
(1948–1949) [18] and the outbreak in the Royal Free Hospital (London, UK) in 1955 [15]. However
in the 1950s it became evident that ME can also occur in sporadic form [5,16]: “Endemic prevalence
alternates with periodic epidemics, showing a curious predilection for female staff of health care and
teaching institutions” [3].
3.1.2. An Often Sudden, Sometimes Gradual, Onset
ME often has a sudden onset; in most cases an infection described as a respiratory and/or
gastro-intestinal illness, “but a gradual or more dramatic onset following neurological, cardiac or
endocrine disability is recognised.” [4]. This implies that a sudden onset is not a distinctive feature of
ME as suggested by others [19–21].
3.1.3. An Acute and a Chronic Phase
“The onset [..] is usually acute with systemic prodromata such as are common in poliomyelitis.” [7].
In the outbreaks, the prodromal phase was usually followed by improvement for a few hours, days or
weeks, after which the symptoms returned more severely with additional symptoms, including marked
muscle weakness [1,22].
In many cases the symptoms become chronic with a periodic relapsing course [1].

3.1.4. Not Just Like Other Post-Viral Fatigue States
ME should be distinguished from other forms of “post-viral debility following Epstein–Barr
mononucleosis, influenza and other common fevers” [3] since ME has “an unique clinical and
epidemiological pattern” [3] and these other post-viral states “lack the dramatic effect of exercise
upon muscle function, the multisystem involvement, diurnal variability of symptoms and prolonged
relapsing course” [3]. This is also one of the many reasons why ME [1–4] should not be confused with
CFS [11], an ill-defined syndrome which can be initiated by various infections, e.g., the Epstein–Barr
virus (mononucleosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), or Ross River virus infections [23].
3.1.5. A Prolonged Relapsing Course
A distinctive feature of ME is a prolonged relapsing course. Years can pass between two relapses.
Relapses can be caused by physical and mental stress (very often) and intercurrent infection (often).
Although outbreak patients appear to recover much often than sporadic patients [22], the illness often
lasts for years or even decades.
3.1.6. Diurnal Variability of Symptoms
In addition to periodic relapses or partial remission, ME is characterized by a strong fluctuation
of symptoms during the course of the day and over time [1,3]. Physical and/or mental stress can have
a (prolonged) negative effect on the symptoms [1].
3.2. Symptoms
Although ME is a multi-systemic disease [3] with a large range of symptoms that can vary greatly
per patient per day, the distinctive features of ME are limited to muscle fatigability/post-exertional
muscle weakness, and specific neurological symptoms.
Patients often report various other symptoms relating to the muscles and “variable involvement
of cardiac and other bodily systems” [3], e.g., myalgia (80%), and gastro-intestinal symptoms (49%),
but these symptoms are not noted in all cases of ME.
3.2.1. Muscle Fatigability/Prolonged Muscle Weakness after Exertion is a Mandatory Feature of ME
“ME is [..] distinguished by severe muscle fatigue following trivial exertion” [3]. “Muscle
fatigability is the dominant and most persistent feature of the disease and [..] a diagnosis should
not be made without it. Restoration of muscle power after exertion can take three to five days or
even longer.” [1]. This implies that muscle fatigability/prolonged muscle weakness after exertion is a
discriminative feature of ME. Long-lasting muscle weakness after exertion can be validated objectively
by measuring muscle power of the arms, hands [24,25], legs [26,27], etc., during repeated muscle
contractions on two consecutive days using dynamometers [28,29].
3.2.2. Neurological Disturbance Is an Essential Feature of ME
In addition to muscle fatigability/post-exertional muscle weakness, neurological symptoms are
distinctive for ME. Neurological disturbance in ME especially relates to “cognitive, autonomic and
sensory functions” [1]. Many symptoms observed in epidemic and endemic cases of ME [1] are
related to neurological dysfunction. The neurological symptoms relate to cognitive dysfunction (n = 3),
autonomic dysfunction (n = 11), sensory dysfunction (n = 19), and motor dysfunction (n = 4), while
three symptoms (headache and symptoms related to sleep) are unclassified (Table 3). Considering
the most recent definitions of ME [3,4] and the frequency of symptoms reported by 420 patients [3],
a patient should experience at least one symptom related to cognitive dysfunction (n = 3) or one
unclassified neurological symptom (n = 3), one symptom related to autonomic dysfunction (n = 11)
and two symptoms related to sensory dysfunction (n = 19) to meet the proposed operational definition
of ME [1–4].

3.2.3. ME Often Coincides with a Number of Symptoms Related to Other Body Systems
In addition to the two mandatory features, muscle fatigability/prolonged post-exertional muscle
weakness after and neurological dysfunction, ME patients often, but not always, suffer from many
other symptoms related to other bodily systems, including musculoskeletal symptoms, e.g., myalgia,
paresis (without exercise) and joint pain, immunological symptoms, e.g., sore throat, tender lymph
nodes, and lymphadenopathy, gastro-intestinal symptoms, e.g., nausea, anorexia, diarrhoea and
abdominal pain, and respiratory symptoms, e.g., respiratory distress, intercostal myalgia (often made
worse on breathing) and exertional chest pain with or without palpitations. ME patients can experience
“extreme exhaustion”/”gross fatigue” after physical or cognitive exertion and emotional strain [1],
but looking at the definitions [2–4] and symptoms reported [1,3], the abstract concept of post-exertional
“malaise” [11,13], cannot be considered a mandatory feature for the diagnosis of ME [1–4].
3.2.4. ME Is Often Accompanied by Emotional Problems, but Is Not Caused by Those Symptoms
Emotional lability is a characteristic feature of ME [1–4]. According to the last patient population
study [3], 98% of the 420 ME patients reported experiencing “emotional disability”. Other emotional
symptoms reported in cases of ME [4] include “outbursts of irritability“, impatience, anxiety, and
depression. However, it should be emphasized that “emotional lability” and other psychological
sequels are caused by ME (likely due to cerebral dysfunction), and do not cause the symptoms.
3.3. An Operational Definition of ME
Considering the descriptions, definitions [3,4], the symptoms experienced by 420 patients [3],
and the symptoms observed in endemic and epidemic cases of ME [1], a discriminative operational
definition encompasses four (mandatory) features:
1.
muscle fatigability/prolonged muscle weakness after trivial exertion;
2.
neurological disturbance (see Table 3):
a.
at least one symptom related to cognitive dysfunction or one unclassified neurological
symptom;
b.
at least one symptom related to autonomic dysfunction; and
c.
at least two symptoms related to sensory dysfunction;
3.
fluctuation of symptoms (within and between “episodes”); and
4.
a prolonged relapsing course.
This definition contains the basic requirements to comply with the diagnosis of ME [3,4].
The tentative case definition described above should be used in conjunction with a full clinical
assessment, with consideration of differential diagnoses.
 Diagnostics 2018, 8, 64
8 of 11
Future surveys should make clear if stricter requirements can be imposed on the three neurological
criteria, and if symptoms not mentioned in the original description of endemic and epidemic cases [1]
can be added to these neurological symptoms clusters, without excluding patients meeting the minimal
requirement for “neurological disturbance”.
Forthcoming studies should also establish the frequency of the (optional) symptoms related to
other bodily systems observed in endemic and epidemic cases of ME [1] and mentioned in other
diagnostic criteria, e.g., the International Consensus Criteria for ME (ME-ICC) [30], the Fukuda criteria
for CFS [11], and the criteria for Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID) [13].
Prospective studies should also investigate the overlap and differences between patients meeting
the four different systems for diagnoses: ME [1–4], ME-ICC [30], CFS [11], and SEID [13], and the
relative numbers of patients fulfilling one or more of these diagnoses.
Future research should also clarify which signs are exhibited by all patients meeting the
operational definition (the “minimum criteria”) of ME and can be included in the definition, and which
comorbidities (symptom patterns) are often present in ME.
4. Discussion
ME is a distinct neuromuscular disease with specific features [1–4]. Based on the definitions,
ME is not an equivalent of CFS [11], an ill-defined fatigue syndrome. This observation is completely
independent of the question whether the name “ME” is appropriate or not [31]. The discussion with
regard to the definition (case criteria) should be separated from the discussion with regard to the most
accurate label.
Since the cause of ME [1–4] is yet unknown, the operational definition of ME proposed in
this article still depends on self-report of symptoms. However, various symptoms, including muscle
fatigability/prolonged muscle weakness (the distinctive symptom) and several neurological symptoms,
can be assessed with objective tests.
In 2011 a panel of experts proposed using the International Consensus Criteria (ICC) for ME [30].
The definition of the ME-ICC [30] deviates at different points from the original definition of ME [3,4].
Long-lasting post-exertional muscle weakness is an optional feature of ME according to the ICC [30],
but is mandatory for diagnosis according to the original definition [3,4]. On the other hand, diagnosis
as per the ME-ICC [30] requires several symptoms which were not part of the original definition of
ME [3,4]. Future surveys using the operational definition of ME proposed here should make clear how
big the overlap is between the original definition of ME [3,4] and that of the ME-ICC [30] and whether
the latter can adequately replace the former according to the original criteria or not.
According to the definition of “ME/CFS” proposed by the Institute of Medicine (now the National
Academy of Medicine) in 2015 [13], post-exertional “malaise” is a differential feature of “ME/CFS”
(in addition to fatigue and unrefreshing sleep). However, post-exertional “malaise”, an ill-defined
notion, has never been described as a distinctive feature of ME [1–4] in the literature. Long-lasting
post-exertional muscle weakness, the distinguishing feature of ME [1–4], is a very specific symptom
which can be assessed objectively and is not a synonym of post-exertional “malaise”.
Other authors have also proposed an operational definition of ME [19–21], but this definition
has two important shortcomings. The definition [19–21] requires a sudden onset. Although ME is
often initiated by an infection [2], a gradual onset is also possible [1–4]. The operational definition
proposed [19–21] also interprets muscle fatigability/post-exertional muscle weakness as post-exertional
“malaise”, but as argued, (post-exertional) muscle weakness and “malaise” are two different concepts.
The tentative definition described here deviates from the London criteria [32] on two crucial points.
Exercise-induced fatigue, the first criterion of the London criteria, has never been described a distinctive
feature of ME [1–3] in the literature, while on the other hand, muscle fatigability/long-lasting
post-exertional muscle weakness, the hallmark feature of ME [1–4], is not required to meet the London
criteria [32].
 Diagnostics 2018, 8, 64
9 of 11
The operational definition of ME also deviates from the definition proposed by Hyde [33], since the
proposed operational definition only incorporates discriminative features of ME and not symptoms
related to “variable involvement of cardiac and other systems” [3], and does not include “testable
brain changes” [33] (which are not proven yet).
5. Conclusions
ME is a specific neuromuscular disease [1–4] and is not equivalent to CFS [11] or “ME/CFS” [13].
ME was described in the literature from 1938 [6] until 1992 [4], after which CFS [11], a fatigue syndrome,
pushed ME [1–4] to the background.
To unravel the aetiology and pathophysiology and to develop effective therapies for of ME as
described in the literature [1–4], it is essential to investigate patients with ME (and ME only). For that
reason, an operational definition is indispensable.
This article proposes an operational definition of ME, based on the last formal definitions of
ME [3,4], and the symptoms observed in the epidemic and endemic cases of ME [1] and reported by a
large group of patients with well-defined ME [3].
An discriminative operational definition of ME should consists of the four mandatory features
(minimum criteria for the diagnosis ME [1–4]):
1.
muscle fatigability/prolonged muscle weakness after trivial exertion;
2.
neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic and sensory functions;
3.
fluctuation of symptoms (within and between ‘episodes’); and
4.
a prolonged relapsing course.
The first two criteria of this tentative definition of ME justify the qualification “neuromuscular
disease”, with specific characteristic and discriminative symptoms.
Muscle fatigability/post-exertional muscle weakness (criterion 1) should be assessed objectively.
This article proposes three criteria to operationalize “neurological disturbance” (criterion 2): at least
one symptom related to cognitive dysfunction or one unclassified neurological symptom, one symptom
related to autonomic dysfunction, and two symptoms related to sensory dysfunction (listed in Table 3).
Several neurological symptoms can be confirmed objectively by medical tests.
The criteria “fluctuation of symptoms” (criterion 3) and a “prolonged relapsing course”
(criterion 4) will largely depend on self-report. The notion “prolonged” is not operationalized in
the literature. However, since an early diagnosis is crucial, future experiments (surveys) should make
clear which minimum duration is applicable.
Based on the (proposed) minimum criteria for ME [1–4]), which discriminate ME from CFS [11]
and other disorders, future studies into the criteria for “neurological disturbance” and the frequency
of optional symptoms can be conducted.
