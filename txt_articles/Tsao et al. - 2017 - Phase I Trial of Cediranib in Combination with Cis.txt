Abstract
Background—In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), targeting angiogenesis, with 
cediranib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet derived growth 
factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor, may have therapeutic potential.
Methods—S0905 phase I combined cediranib (2 dose cohorts 30 mg and 20 mg daily) with 
cisplatin-pemetrexed for 6 cycles followed by maintenance cediranib in unresectable chemo-naïve 
MPM patients of any histologic subtype. The primary endpoint established the MTD in 
combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed in a dose de-escalation schema.
Results—A total of 20 patients (7 to cohort 30 mg, 13 to cohort 20 mg) were enrolled. In the 
cediranib 30 mg dose cohort, 2 of the initial 6 patients reported DLTs and the dose was deemed 
too toxic to continue. In the next cohort, 2 patients experienced DLTs and thus the MTD was 
established as cediranib at 20 mg. During the 6 cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed-cediranib 20 mg, 
there were grade 3 toxicities (neutropenia, gastrointestinal) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. No 
patients had any significant episodes of bleeding. By RECIST (n=17), the median PFS was 12.8 
months (95% CI: 6.9 – 17.2); by modified RECIST (n=19), the median PFS was 8.6 months (95% 
CI: 6.1–10.9). For all patients, the disease control rate at 6 weeks was 90% and median OS was 
16.2 months (95% CI: 10.5 – 28.7).

Introduction/Background
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare disease with limited treatment options and 
a median survival time of 12 months for unresectable patients.1 In the front-line setting, 
cisplatin-pemetrexed has been the accepted standard of care since 2003.1 Recently the first 
therapeutic advance since the approval of pemetrexed and cisplatin was made when the 
addition of bevacizumab to the cisplatin-pemetrexed backbone prolonged survival over 
cisplatin-pemetrexed alone.2 This success provides the impetus to continue to evaluate 
angiogenesis inhibitors in this disease.
The angiogenic pathway plays an important role in mesothelioma. Preclinical studies have 
demonstrated a high dependency of MPM on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet derived growth factor 
(PDGF)/platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathway.3–5 Mesothelioma tumor 
cells have the highest secretion of VEGF ligand with pathway activation compared to other 
solid tumors and rely on the PDGF/PDGFR pathway for an autocrine loop 
proliferation.3,6–13 In vitro and xenograft mesothelioma studies14–16 have demonstrated that 
inhibition of the PDGF pathway leads to anti-tumor effects, and a phase I trial17 of imatinib 
mesylate, a PDGFR inhibitor, combined with cisplatin-pemetrexed showed potential clinical 
benefit but low tolerance to therapy.
Previously, 3 small phase II trials18–20 found that the addition of bevacizumab to platinum 
doublets in mesothelioma did not appear to augment clinical efficacy in the intent to treat 
population. In one of these studies18, patients with levels of serum VEGF higher than the 
median had a worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and had less 
survival benefit with the addition of bevacizumab. As bevacizumab targets VEGF, an 
intrinsic mechanism of resistance may be present in mesothelioma that secretes high levels 
of VEGF. However, the French Intergroupe Francophone de Cancerologie Thoracique 
(IFCT) recently conducted the phase II/III Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed 
Study (MAPS) trial2 in 448 patients and demonstrated a greater than 2 month median overall 
survival benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin-pemetrexed in the intent to 
treat population. This study supports the hypothesis that anti-angiogenic agents have clinical 
efficacy in certain mesothelioma patients.
We hypothesized that targeting the VEGF receptor would potentially bypass the potential 
resistance of high VEGF ligand secretion and ultimately provide clinical efficacy for 
mesothelioma patients. In addition, targeting other angiogenic pathways, such as PDGF/
PDGFR, made rationale sense to enhance the anti-tumor effect.21

 Cediranib (Recentin, AZD2171; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, United Kingdom) 
is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of VEGFR1,2,3, PDGFR, and c-KIT. Cediranib at 
45 mg daily dose demonstrated anti-tumor activity in mesothelioma patients in a second-line 
monotherapy trial, Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 0509.22 This study reported a 9% 
response rate and 34% disease stabilization with a median PFS of 2.56 months and median 
OS 9.5 months. The majority of patients did require a dose reduction from the 45 mg daily 
dose.
A frontline trial, SWOG 0905 was therefore designed as a phase I/II combination trial of 
cisplatin-pemetrexed with and without cediranib. The phase I portion was designed as a 
safety study to evaluate two different doses of cediranib (30 mg and 20 mg) in combination 
with cisplatin-pemetrexed for 6 cycles of therapy followed by cediranib maintenance 
therapy. This manuscript reports on the results of the phase I trial. The phase II portion of 
the trial has completed enrollment of 98 patients and data analysis is expected in winter 
2017.
Methods
Patients and Methods
Adult patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma 
of any histologic subtype were eligible. Other key inclusion criteria included: measurable or 
non-measurable disease by either RECIST 1.1 or modified RECIST for pleural tumors, no 
prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy or other biologic therapy), a Zubrod performance 
status of ≤ 2 and adequate hepatic (serum bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal and 
transaminases ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal), hematologic (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 
1500/ml and platelets ≥ 100,000/ml), renal (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of 
normal or a measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min), and cardiac function. Patients may 
have received prior surgery (e.g. pleurectomy or pleurodesis) or prior radiation therapy. 
Patients were not eligible if they had severe systemic comorbid disease or a significant 
cardiac history, uncontrolled hypertension, significant proteinuria, a prolonged QTc interval, 
or gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in the inability to take oral medication. Patients 
could not have a history of clinically significant hemoptysis or other bleeding issues.
The protocol and informed consent document were approved by the Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program of the National Cancer Institute and the institutional review boards of 
participating SWOG member sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients 
before enrollment. This study was monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
of SWOG. An additional patient consent was required for the banking and future use of 
specimens.
Patient history, physical examination, and hematologic and chemical laboratory analyses 
were performed before cycle 1 and each subsequent cycle of therapy. Radiographic tumor 
measurements were performed after every two treatment cycles. Tumor response 
assessments were determined by RECIST 1.1. However, additional tumor measurements 
using the modified RECIST measurement system as described in Tsao et al.23 were also 
obtained for exploratory research purposes. Patients were withdrawn from the study due to

 disease progression or symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity as assessed by the 
study physician, treatment delay of greater than 3 weeks, or if more than the allowed number 
of dose modifications were required or patient request.
Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) were administered intravenously on day 
1 every 3 weeks. Dose modifications for chemotherapy were conducted per standard 
guidelines. Vitamin supplementation with folic acid 400 mcg daily and vitamin B12 1000 
mcg IM injection every 9 weeks was mandatory for all patients and initiated 1 week (day 
−7) prior to cycle 1 of cisplatin-pemetrexed and cediranib. Carboplatin substitution was 
allowed if the patient developed toxicity to cisplatin. Cediranib was given concomitantly on 
day 1 and continued daily. Two doses of cediranib were evaluated, 30 mg and 20 mg. No 
further dose reductions or modifications were allowed. No primary prophylaxis with G-CSF 
or antibiotics were allowed.
Statistics
The primary endpoint of this study was to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
the recommended Phase II dose of cediranib in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed 
in MPM patients. The phase I trial was a limited dose de-escalation study with 2 potential 
doses of cediranib (30 mg and 20 mg daily dose). The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
defined as febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia for more than 7 days duration, grade 4 
thrombocytopenia, or grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia). Only 
DLTs occurring during Cycle 1 were used to guide dosing determination. Patients were 
considered evaluable for DLT if they received at least 14 doses (50% of the planned dose) of 
cediranib in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin during cycle 1. Patients who were 
not evaluable for DLT were replaced. The regimen was considered safe and the MTD 
determined if the DLT rate of cediranib and cisplatin-pemetrexed was ≤ 33%.
The following dosing scheme was used. Enroll 6 evaluable patients at the 30 mg dose level. 
If 3 or more patients experienced a DLT, enrollment would stop and the study would proceed 
to the 20 mg dose level. If 0–2 patients experience a DLT, 4 additional patients were 
accrued. If 0–3 patients experienced a DLT, then the 30 mg dose would be declared the 
MTD. If 4 or more patients experienced a DLT, then the trial would continue to the 20 mg 
dose level. At the reduced dose level the same rules apply as above. If 0–3 of 10 patients 
experience a DLT, then the 20 mg dose level would be the MTD. However, if 3 of the initial 
6 or 4 or more out of 10 experienced a DLT, then neither 30 mg nor 20 mg would be 
considered the MTD.
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline, as defined by the specific criteria, were 
included in the response analysis. Progression-free survival, disease control rate, and 
duration of response were also analyzed by RECIST 1.1 and by Modified RECIST. Disease 
control was defined as absence of progression at the first follow-up assessment. Duration of 
response was defined as time from date of initial documentation of partial or complete 
response until date of progression or death, with patients censored at date of last contact if 
last known to be alive and progression-free. Overall survival, progression-free survival and 
duration of response were all estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.

 Results
Twenty patients were enrolled into this study from March 15, 2010 until July 18, 2011. 
Patient demographics are listed in Table 1. There were 7 patients in dose cohort 1 (30 mg) 
and 13 patients in dose cohort 2 (20 mg). Both cohorts were similar with median age of 64, 
predominantly Caucasian ethnicity (71% and 77%), and majority performance status 0–1 
(100% and 92%). However, while the 30 mg cohort enrolled all epithelioid histology 
patients, the 20 mg cohort included 2 biphasic and 1 not otherwise specified mesothelioma 
patients.
In the cediranib 30 mg dose cohort, one patient misunderstood instructions and took only 4 
doses of cediranib during cycle 1, and was not evaluable for DLT. This patient was replaced 
per protocol. Two of the initial 6 evaluable patients reported DLTs and were dose reduced, 
one due to grade 3 fatigue and one due to grade 3 fatigue and grade 3 diarrhea. Although 
technically, this did not reach the formal stopping rule (3 or more of the first 6 patients with 
a DLT), the Lung Committee leadership and treating investigators felt that the 30 mg 
cediranib dose was difficult for patients to continue as two of the six patients required dose 
reductions to 20 mg of cediranib during cycle 1 therefore the study was not expanded to 10 
total patients.
Six of the 7 patients completed the 6 cycles of the triplet regimen and five had nine or more 
cycles of maintenance therapy. The median number of cycles of all study treatment in the 30 
mg cohort was 17 (range: 2–32). The most common toxicities associated with therapy during 
cycle 1 in the 30 mg cediranib cohort included: grade 2–3 fatigue, grade 1–2 nausea, and 
grade 1–2 lymphopenia, (Table 2). When assessing all 6 cycles of therapy for the 
combination of cisplatin-pemetrexed with 30 mg cediranib cohort (Table 3), five patients 
(71%) had grade 3 adverse events due to diarrhea (n=1), fatigue (n=2), lymphopenia (n=2), 
and neutropenia (n=1). The most common grade 1–2 toxicities during all 6 cycles of triplet 
therapy included gastrointestinal complaints (anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), fatigue, 
hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. There were 3 
reported cases of grade 1–2 hypertension. Five of the 7 (71%) patients had chemotherapy 
delays and 3 patients required dose reductions of cediranib with one patient also requiring a 
dose delay of cediranib (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).
In the maintenance cediranib 30 mg portion (n=5 evaluable patients), the most common 
toxicities reported were diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, nausea, 
vomiting, and proteinuria. There were 5 grade 3 events (1 each) of diarrhea, hand-foot 
syndrome, hypomagnesemia, neutropenia, and weight loss. Two of the 5 patients who 
received maintenance 30 mg cediranib required dose delays (Supplemental Table 1).
Thirteen patients were accrued to the lower dose level of cisplatin-pemetrexed and cediranib 
20 mg daily. One patient received only 13 daily doses of cediranib during cycle 1 due to a 
drug shipment error and was not evaluable for DLT. This patient was replaced per protocol. 
In addition, two patients who were in screening at the time of accrual completion were 
allowed to enroll. During cycle 1, two patients experienced DLTs, one due grade 3

 dehydration and one due to grade 3 hyponatremia. Thus, 20 mg of cediranib was determined 
to be the MTD.
Ten of the 13 patients completed 6 cycles of the triplet regimen. The median number of 
cycles of all study treatment received was 11 (range: 1–41). During the triplet regimen, 6 of 
20 (46%) patients require a chemotherapy delay and 1 patient also required a dose reduction 
of cisplatin (Supplemental Table 1). Three patients required treatment discontinuation of 
cisplatin-pemetrexed which included two patients removed from all protocol treatment due 
to toxicity. The most common toxicities during cycle 1 were grade 1–2 anorexia, grade 1–2 
diarrhea, grade 1–2 fatigue, grade 1 hypomagnesemia, and grade 1–2 nausea.(Table 2) For 
all 6 cycles of combination cisplatin-pemetrexed with cediranib 20 mg (Table 3), the most 
common toxicities were grade 1–2 gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea), dehydration, fatigue, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, anemia, 
neutropenia, and proteinuria. Grade 3 toxicities were reported with neutropenia (n=3), 
vomiting (n=2), and one event each of abdominal pain, anemia, constipation, dehydration, 
diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, mucositis, nausea, 
neuropathy, and pulmonary hypertension. Two episodes of grade 4 thrombocytopenia were 
also reported. There were no patients with any significant episodes of bleeding. One patient 
in the cediranib 20 mg cohort was switched to carboplatin during cycle 4 due to grade 3 
neuropathy. One treatment-related death was noted in a patient who completed 3 cycles the 
triplet therapy and was suspected to have a septic event from pneumonia with associated 
hypotension and delirium.
Ten patients proceeded to maintenance therapy with cediranib. In the maintenance phase, the 
cediranib 20 mg cohort had grade 3 events of abdominal pain (n=1), diarrhea (n=1), heart 
failure (n=1), and dyspnea (n=2). Three patients required dose delays and 1 patient required 
a dose reduction (Supplemental Table 1).
Efficacy
The median follow-up among the 4 patients still alive as of last contact is 26 months (range: 
9 – 56). Table 4 summarizes the efficacy results. Two separate radiographic response 
measurements were utilized, RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST. In the 30 mg cohort, 2 out 
of 7 evaluable patients had a partial response by RECIST 1.1 for a response rate of 29% 
(95% confidence interval: 0% – 62%). The duration of these responses were 7.2 and 25.3 
months. Applying modified RECIST, there were 5 patients with a partial response, including 
one that was unconfirmed, resulting in an estimated response rate of 71%, (95% CI: 38%–
100%). The median duration of these responses was 5.9 months (95% CI: 3.0–9.7 months). 
The disease control rate was 86% (95% CI: 60% – 100%) with both criteria.
In the 30 mg cohort, the median PFS by RECIST 1.1 was 12.8 months (95% CI: 3.1 – 14.6) 
and the median PFS by modified RECIST was 10.1 months (95% CI: 4.5 – 10.9 months). 
The median overall survival was 16.2 months (95% confidence interval: 7.5 – 28.7). (Figure 
1)
Within the 20 mg cohort, 10 of 13 patients had measurable disease. One patient withdrew 
consent after completing the first cycle of treatment and did not have any follow-up disease

 assessments on protocol. This patient was counted in the denominator as a non-responder for 
both RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST. A RECIST 1.1 response was observed in 2 patients 
[20% (95% CI: 0% – 45%)]. The duration of these responses were 17.1 and 1.5 months. By 
modified RECIST, 12 patients had pleural thickness measurements reported at baseline. 
Seven patients had partial responses, three unconfirmed, for an estimated response rate of 
58% (95% CI: 30% – 86%). The median duration of these responses was 5.6 months (95% 
CI: 1.5–17.1 months). The disease control rate was 92% (95% CI: 78% – 100%) with both 
criteria.
In the 20 mg cohort, the median PFS by RECIST 1.1 was 13.6 months (95% confidence 
interval: 8.0 – 18.6), the median PFS by modified RECIST was 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.9 – 
13.1 months), and the median overall survival was 13.6 months (95% confidence interval: 
12.0 – 26.8). (Figure 1)
In total, 17 of 20 patients were evaluable for response by RECIST 1.1. The RECIST 1.1 
response rate was 24% (95% CI: 3% – 44%) and median PFS was 12.8 months (95% CI: 6.9 
– 17.2). Nineteen patients were measurable by modified RECIST with a response rate of 
63% (95% CI: 41%–85%), a median duration of response 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.0 – 9.7 
months), and a median PFS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.1–10.9). For all patients, the disease 
control rate was 90% (95% CI: 77% – 100%) and the median OS was 16.2 months (95% CI: 
10.5 – 28.7).
Discussion
The phase I portion of SWOG0905 established that the MTD of cediranib was 20 mg daily 
in combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed. This triplet regimen was reasonably well tolerated 
with manageable toxicities. The main grade 3–4 adverse events were gastrointestinal 
toxicity, dehydration, and hematologic disorders. Cediranib certainly caused gastrointestinal 
toxicity and dehydration that are not typically seen with cisplatin-pemetrexed alone.1 It is 
also suspected that cediranib had an additive effect on hematologic toxicity. There was a 
15% incidence of grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia with the triplet regimen that is higher than 
the 5.4% seen in the Vogelzang trial1 with cisplatin-pemetrexed alone. In the 30 mg cohort, 
grade 3 lymphopenia occurred in 2 patients, but no cases were reported in the cediranib 20 
mg cohort. The addition of cediranib did not appear to increase the rates of grade 3–4 
anemia or neutropenia, which were 4.2% and 23.2%, respectively, in the prior Vogelzang 
study1.
Although the enrollment in S0905 was small, when compared to the MAPS trial2, the 
toxicity of the current cisplatin-pemetrexed-cedirinib regimen appears to be comparable to 
that of the cisplatin-pemetrexed-bevacizumab regimen which reported a 71% grade 3–4 
adverse event rate. Cisplatin-pemetrexed-cediranib caused less thromboembolism, 
hypertension, and hemorrhage. The MAPS trial reported a 6% grade 3 thromboembolic rate, 
while there was only 1 grade 1 event in the S0905 trial. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 
23% of patients with bevacizumab-cisplatin-pemetrexed compared to only 1 report with 
cediranib-based therapy. Notably, there were no reports of bleeding with cediranib-based

 therapy, whereas the bevacizumab-based regimen reported a 37.4% rate of hemorrhage 
(primarily grade 1–2 epistaxis).
Cediranib-cisplatin-pemetrexed did have higher rates of proteinuria and gastrointestinal 
events compared to the MAPS regimen. The bevacizumab-based regimen reported a 16% 
rate of any grade proteinuria (3.2% grade 3) whereas S0905 noted a 60% rate of grade 1–2 
proteinuria. The most common gastrointestinal side effect with cediranib was diarrhea. 
Cediranib-induced diarrhea was manageable with loperamide or lomotil, however, several 
patients needed to take the anti-diarrheal agents prophylactically. In cohort 1, dose reducing 
cediranib to 20 mg daily dose improved diarrhea. Unfortunately, there is currently little data 
on the mechanism of action of VEGFR-TKI-induced diarrhea. Although these VEGFR TKIs 
are cleared via the fecal pathway and the metabolites may cause colonic irritation, there are 
potential effects from inhibition of intestinal microcirculation or even off-target effects on 
gut motility that could also have a significant role in causing diarrhea.24
Although the sample size of the current study is small and the patients were highly selected 
there is a signal of clinical benefit with the addition of cediranib to cisplatin-pemetrexed. 
The median PFS noted with both RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST criteria was better than 
that reported for platinum-based doublets (8.6 and 13.6 months vs. 6.8 months).25 Of note, 
the Vogelzang trial1 did not report PFS but had a time to treatment failure of 5.7 months with 
cisplatin-pemetrexed. In addition, overall survival was 13.6 and 16.2 months in the two 
S0905 cohorts compared to 12.1 months in the Vogelzang trial.1 This finding is consistent 
with the IFCT MAPs trial26 in which cisplatin-pemetrexed-bevacizumab had a median PFS 
(9.2 months versus 7.3 months, HR 0.61, p<0.0001) and OS (18.8 months versus 16.1 
months, HR 0.77, p=0.0167) benefit over platinum-pemetrexed alone. Despite the control 
arm having better outcomes than historical studies1, the MAPs trial clearly demonstrated 
survival benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin-pemetrexed.
It remains to be seen whether inhibition of VEGF ligand alone via bevacizumab is sufficient 
for survival benefit or whether targeting VEGFR along with PDGFR with cedirinib provides 
greater synergistic benefit. Given that mesothelioma is known to be reliant on the PDGF/
PDGFR pathway for proliferation14–16 and that prior studies with PDGFR inhibitors have 
shown a clinical benefit in mesothelioma17, it is suspected that multi-angiokinase inhibition 
may ultimately provide additive benefit. Cediranib has been studied in several other tumor 
types with variable results. In NSCLC27 and colorectal cancer28 the addition of cediranib to 
front-line chemotherapy failed to improve survival, whereas phase II and III trials in 
cervical29 and ovarian cancer30 have demonstrated increased response rates and survival 
outcomes.
For mesothelioma, the phase II portion of SWOG 0905, a randomized trial of cisplatin-
pemetrexed with and without cediranib, has completed enrollment and is awaiting sufficient 
events to be analyzed. Molecular correlative studies in tumor tissue evaluating VEGF/
VEGFR and PDGF/PDGFR pathway by immunohistochemistry and plasma profiling via 
reverse phase protein arrays are planned. A randomized phase II trial of cisplatin-
pemetrexed with and without nintedanib, an oral TKI targeting VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR, 
has completed accrual and is now being expanded into a phase III randomized trial. Unlike

 cedirinib, nintedanib also targets FGFR, but it remains unknown whether the FGFR pathway 
is a clinically relevant target in mesothelioma. 31,32 Overall, there is a growing body of 
literature indicating that anti-angiogenic therapy in combination with chemotherapy 
provides survival benefit for patients with malignant mesothelioma.
Conclusion
Cediranib in combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed has a reasonable toxicity profile and 
preliminary promising efficacy. The randomized phase II portion of the S0905 trial will 
evaluate the efficacy of the triplet regimen compared to the current standard therapy of 
cisplatin-pemetrexed.
