Background-—With increasing survival rates among patients with myocardial infarction (MI), more demands are placed on
secondary prevention. While physical activity (PA) efforts to obtain a sufficient PA level are part of secondary preventive
recommendations, it is still underutilized. Importantly, the effect of changes in PA after MI is largely unknown. Therefore, we sought
to investigate the effect on survival from changes in PA level, post-MI.
Methods and Results-—Data from Swedish national registries were combined, totaling 22 227 patients with MI. PA level was self-
reported at 6 to 10 weeks post-MI and 10 to 12 months post-MI. Patients were classified as constantly inactive, increased activity,
reduced activity, and constantly active. Proportional hazard ratios were calculated. During 100 502 person-years of follow-up
(mean follow-up time 4.2 years), a total of 1087 deaths were recorded. Controlling for important confounders (including left
ventricular function, type of MI, medication, smoking, participation in cardiac rehabilitation program, quality of life, and estimated
kidney function), we found lower mortality rates among constantly active (hazard ratio: 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.21–0.41),
those with increased activity (0.41, 95% confidence interval: 0.31–0.55), and those with reduced activity (hazard ratio: 0.56, 95%
confidence interval: 0.45–0.69) during the first year post-MI, compared with those being constantly inactive. Stratified analyses
indicated strong effect of PA level among both sexes, across age, MI type, kidney function, medication, and smoking status.
Conclusions-—The present article shows that increasing the PA level, compared with staying inactive the first year post-MI, was
related to reduced mortality. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e010108. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010108.)

M
yocardial infarction (MI) remains one of the most
feared complications of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
being associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.
However, because of the advancements in emergency care,
including the widespread use of cardiac interventions as well
as antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and dyslipidemia treat-
ment, a larger proportion of patients now survive their first
MI.1,2 This positive development has resulted in more focus
being put on secondary prevention.
Physical activity (PA) is a well-recognized factor in the
primary prevention of CVD.3,4 Also in patients with estab-
lished CVD, structured physical activity (PA)5 as well as
increases in PA6,7 have been shown to be associated with
reduced cardiovascular mortality. These effects rest on
multiple positive effects on traditional risk factors for CVD,
including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and diabetes
mellitus as well as on possible effects on atherosclerotic
progression, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic control, and
subsequent arrhythmia risk.8,9 Thus, a sufficiently high PA
level is recommended as first-line treatment in primary and
secondary prevention guidelines10 globally. However, the
adherence to these PA recommendations, and the use of
exercise as part of regular treatment in health care, vary to a
great extent.11
Atherosclerosis is a progressing disease, and the disease
itself, and its consequences, may affect the ability of the
individual to be sufficiently physically active both before and
after a cardiac event. One limitation of earlier studies on the
association between the level of PA and survival post-MI is the
risk of selection bias (ie, that the individuals with the most
advanced disease are also the least active because of their

 functional status). Therefore, changes in PA level during the
period following the event, rather than a single measure of PA,
may provide more information when assessing the effect of
rehabilitation interventions. The effect of lifestyle-focused
cardiac rehabilitation has been investigated, showing reduced
risk of readmissions and decreased cardiovascular mortality,
while inconsistent findings for total mortality exist.12,13
Cardiac rehabilitation focusing on risk reduction has also
been shown to reduce mortality.14 However, many patients
are not offered cardiac rehabilitation for various reasons. Also,
cardiac rehabilitation is multifactorial in its nature, and the
isolated effect from exercise may be difficult to identify.15
Little is known about the long-term effects on mortality
from changes in PA levels in patients with MI. In a pioneer
article, Steffen-Batey et al16 reported considerably lowered
mortality in patients who increased their activity (Relative risk
(RR)=0.11), compared with those who remained physically
inactive, in a cohort of 406 male and female MI patients.
Recently, another study on 856 women in the Women’s
Health Initiative-Observational study, showed similar results.7
However, additional and larger studies are needed, to be able
to study these relations in important strata, related to the
severity of the MI, comorbidities, or consequences, such as
kidney function, quality of life, and the degree of tolerated
medication. Such comparisons would be of clinical impor-
tance, directly influencing the treatment post-MI.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the
long-term survival among patients with MI in relation to
changes in self-reported PA in a large nationwide cohort of
Swedish patients with MI. Furthermore, we aimed to assess
any moderating effects from known risk factors on this
relationship.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Patients who remained physically active over the first year
post-myocardial infarction (MI) had the lowest risk of
mortality, over a 4.2-year follow-up period.
• However, changes in physical activity level the first-year
post-MI is important, lowering the risk of mortality in
patients increasing their activity and increasing risk in those
with decreased activity.
• It seems not to be too late to start being active post-MI,
since the group with increased activity post-MI did not differ
in survival from the constantly active group.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The shown relation to survival, in patients who maintain or
increase their level of physical activity post-MI, reinforces
the importance of the present guidelines and highlights the
need for their implementation in secondary prevention.
• Being active post-MI seems to be equally important for
different subgroups.

Mortality After Changing Physical Activity Post-MI
Ekblom et al

 We included allpatients (n=22 227) between ages 18and75
years who were diagnosed with their first MI (International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision [ICD-10] code I.21)
between December 28, 2004 and October 25, 2013 and who
providedcomplete data intheSWEDEHEART registry (Figure 1).
From the SWEDEHEART registry, age, body mass index,
serum creatinine, height, sex, type of MI, and left ventricular
function were obtained. Type of MI was based on a clinical
assessment and patients were classified as having had a
ST-segment–elevation MI (STEMI), or a non-ST-segment–
elevation
MI
(NSTEMI).
Left
ventricular
function
was
expressed as ejection fraction (EF) in percent, and was
further divided into >50%, 49% to 40%, or ≤40%. The use of
percutaneous cardiac interventions during treatment was also
recorded in the SWEDEHEART and coded as yes or no.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was based on
plasma creatinine values calculated according to the Cock-
croft-Gault formula [eGFR=(1.239(140�age)9body mass)/
serum creatinine and eGFR=(1.049(140�age)9body mass)/
serum creatinine, for men and women, respectively], which
has previously been used in analyses of the SWEDEHEART
registry.19
eGFR
was
dichotomized
at
60 mL/min
per
1.73 m2, to identify normal or mildly decreased GFR from
moderately decreased or more pronouncedly decreased GFR.
PA was reported in the SEPHIA subregistry at both follow-
up visits as self-reported number of PA sessions, 30 minutes
or longer, during the last 7 days. Values between zero and 7
were accepted in the registry. Patients were classified as
“inactive” if they reported none or 1 session of PA per week,
only. Patients reporting 2 or more sessions per week were
classified as “active.” Patients were further classified accord-
ing to changes in activity level between the 2 secondary
prevention visits (at 6–10 weeks and 12 months, respec-
tively), as constantly being inactive, having reduced activity,
increased activity, or being constantly active. Full pharmaco-
logical treatment was identified as being treated with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, b-blocking agent,
statins, or other lipid-lowering agents and antithrombogenic
agents (coded as yes or no). Smoking status (never-smoker,
ex-smoker since >1 month or smoker) was recorded at the
first rehabilitation visit, 6 to 10 weeks after discharge from
the hospital. When data were missing on smoking (n=32),
additional data were obtained from the second visit. Data on
participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation during
the year following MI was obtained from the second
rehabilitation visit. Data from the Euro-Qol 5 dimensions
(EQ-5D) from the first visit was used to estimate health-
related quality of life.20 The Regional Ethics Board in
Stockholm, Sweden approved this study (2013/2067-31).
No informed consent was required. The corresponding author
had full access to all the data in the study and takes
responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis.
Statistics
Descriptive demographic and clinical characteristics were
analyzed using means (SDs) and percentage. Differences
between survivors and fatal cases were tested using the t
test and v2 test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95%
confidence interval were computed using Cox proportional
hazard ratios using the SPSS Cox regression with time-
dependent covariate module. Hazard ratios for the 4 PA
strata (constantly active, reduced activity, increased activity,
or constantly inactive) were computed unadjusted and
controlled for potential confounders. In the fully adjusted
models, age, sex, date for MI, body mass index, EQ-5D, EF,
type of MI, the use of percutaneous cardiac interventions,
eGFR, smoking, pharmacological treatment, and participation
in cardiac rehabilitation training were included. We checked
the
proportionality
assumption
using
scaled
Sch€
onfelts
residuals. All variables were checked for proportionality,
including the separate measures from the first and second
PA assessment. A weak and borderline significance was
noted only for PA strata. Because of this, we included an
interaction term for time 9 PA strata in all analyses. Formal
interaction
analyses for HRs between PA strata were
performed as proposed by Bland and Altman.21 HRs was
considered to be statistically significant if the 95% confi-
dence interval did not include the value of 1. All statistics
were performed in IBM SPSS (version 21).
Results
Subject inclusion is described in Figure 1. The included and
nonincluded patients differ in some aspects. Those with PA
data, compared with those without, were less likely to be
smokers (11.0% versus 13.6%), and have a low eGFR (8.2%
versus 10.1%). Also their survival was lower (90.0% versus
94.2%). When comparing those included with PA data and
those with PA data but lacking other variables, the latter
group was less likely to have full medication (64.2% versus
69.6%), have had a STEMI (37.7% versus 41.1%), and more
likely to be female (28.7% versus 26.1%). Also their survival
was lower (92.0% versus 95.1%).
Subject characteristics, for the 22 227 included MI
patients, are given in Table 1. All the examined variables
differed across PA strata, except for pharmacological treat-
ment, where no difference could be seen between PA groups.
Some differences were small, albeit statistically significant
(age, body mass index). Women and current smokers were
overrepresented in the constantly inactive strata, as were
patients with NSTEMI. Constantly active participants also
participated in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to a
higher degree (40.9% versus 21.6%) compared with the
constantly inactive group.

 Patients reporting being active at both 6 to 10 weeks, and
1-year post-MI, had higher EQ-5D, less prevalence of low
eGFR, more often underwent percutaneous cardiac interven-
tions, and had a higher EF post-MI (Table 1).
In
uncontrolled
analyses,
mortality
(cases
per
1000 person-years with 95% confidence interval) in the 4
PA strata was 28.5 (25.3–32.0) among the constantly
inactive, 12.7 (11.0–14.6) among those who reduced their
activity, 11.5 (9.4–14.0) among those who increased their
activity, and 7.5 (6.9–8.2) among the constantly active
patients. In the fully controlled model, HRs for mortality were
lower for those being constantly active, and for those with
increased and decreased activity strata compared with those
in the constantly inactive strata. However, HR for patients
who increased and patients who decreased their PA did not
differ. Constantly active patients had lower HR compared with
individuals decreasing their PA level. HR for patients who
increased their PA level did not differ from those being
constantly active (Table 2, Figure 2).
No interactions were found for any of the variables in the
full model, indicating similar differences between PA strata
and mortality between age, sex, STT changes, the use of

ment. The exception was EF, where HRs in the reduced PA
strata were 0.42 (0.27–0.67) and 0.63 (0.42–0.93) for EF 40%
to 50% and EF <40%, respectively. For the increased PA
strata, corresponding values were 0.56 (0.30–1.10) and 0.20
(0.10–0.41) and for the constantly active strata 0.39 (0.19–
0.79) and 0.20 (0.10–0.41).
We also related mortality to activity levels at the 2
assessments separately. In age- and sex-controlled analyses,
active patients had lower mortality at both assessments, with
HR (95% confidence interval=0.42 [0.38–0.48] and 0.41
[0.36–0.46]) for the first and second assessment, respec-
tively. In fully controlled analyses, corresponding values were
0.58 (0.51–0.67) and 0.53 (0.47–0.60), for the first and
second assessment, respectively.
Discussion
The main result of this study, based on a national registry of
unselected patients with MI, is that the mortality among
inactive patients, who increase their PA level during the first
year following a MI, was much lower, over a 4.2-year follow-up
period, compared with those who remained inactive. The
lowest risk was seen in patients who remained physically
active over the first year, post-MI. Results for the group
increasing their PA level is interesting, since the results
indicate that patients who were initially inactive (which
previous single-assessment-based studies have indicated to
be at high risk) can reduce the risk by increasing activity. HRs
in the group with increasing activity post-MI did not differ
from the constantly active group at follow-up. The previous
studies have also concluded that this group may be more
affected by unmeasured factors or residual confounding,
which in turn worsen the prognosis. Although this might well
be present in this study, results from the group increasing
their activity level post-MI clearly show that mortality is lower
in this group compared with the constantly inactive group,
controlled for a large number of covariates.
Similarly, results from the group decreasing their PA level
indicate that those who were active 6 to 10 weeks after MI
but reduced PA have a worse prognosis, as compared with
those remaining physically active. Again, even if unmeasured
and uncontrolled factors may differ between active and
inactive patients at 6 to 10 weeks after MI, changes in PA
level over 1 year were still related to mortality. Patients
potentially having a more severe disease still benefit from PA
increase to a similar extent as those with less severe disease.
The exception was between patients with EF between 40%
and 50% and EF <40%, where HRs differed between PA strata.
Results indicated that patients with a low EF (<40%),
compared with a moderately reduced EF 40% to 50%, showed
an even stronger risk reduction among constantly active
patients and patients increasing their PA level.
When analyzing the 2 assessments separately, we found
smaller risk reductions among active patients as compared
with those being constantly active. One possible explanation
for this is that the inactive group at a single assessment will
include participants with either a more active future or being
more active in the past, which would dilute the contrast. This
stresses the importance of studying PA level at more than 1
time point. Also, these results add to previous studies, by
showing that these relations seem independent of cardiac
rehabilitation participation in major subgroups post-MI. Also,
the similarity of the HRs found at the 2 assessments
(6–10 weeks and 10–20 months post-MI) when analyzed
separately can be taken as an argument against a possible
competing hypothesis that the type or intensity of the PA
performed at the 2 time points differ.
Presently, the association between higher levels of PA and
lower risk of events in those with cardiovascular disease22 is
well established. We were able to confirm this association and
also expand on the previous findings by Stefen-Batey16 and
Gorczyca7 by identifying a lower risk in those patients with MI
who increased their activity and an increased risk in those
decreasing their activity, during the first year post-MI. The
present study, however, includes >22 000 patients with MI,
and allowed for adjusting for multiple possible confounders,

 which was not possible in the previous studies. We could also
show that this was true for several important subgroups,
including older patients, those having heart failure, those with
decreased kidney function, smokers, and for both sexes.
Importantly, our study included the sum of all self-
reported PA and exercise, and not only exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation, which has earlier been found be
related to lower mortality post-MI.12,13 Indeed, our results
were independent of participation or nonparticipation in
cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation
performed at home or at the hospital have both been related
to CVD reduction in patients with MI.23 However, far from all
patients are
offered
cardiac
rehabilitation for
different
reasons, often related to severity of the MI or other
health-related factors, including older age. Of those offered
hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation, not all choose to
participate, perhaps because of practical reasons (such as
living a long distance from the hospital or lack of interest).
Thus, those investigated in studies of hospital or home-based
cardiac rehabilitation may constitute a selected subgroup. In
addition, when entering a physical training program, such as
cardiac rehabilitation, other parts of the activity pattern,
such as everyday activity or hobbies, may be compensatorily
decreased, leading to a status quo regarding total PA.24
Similarly, sedentary activity may increase again after the end
of
cardiac
rehabilitation.25
Unfortunately,
Hansen
et al
showed that the cardiovascular disease risk profile worsened
significantly
during
long-term
follow-up
after
cardiac
rehabilitation.26 Therefore, focusing on all PA, regardless of
context, may offer an important target for improved clinical
secondary prevention post-MI.
The relative intensity of the performed activities in the
present study is unknown. The intensity of the PA performed
may be of importance, since aerobic fitness has been shown
to be an important predictor of survival, also post-MI,27 and
cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to increase aerobic
fitness.28 However, both high-intensity exercise and less-
intense continuous exercise have been shown to reduce CVD
risk in cardiac patients,29 while Williams et al showed that
walking had equal CVD-risk-reducing effects as running did in
patients at high cardiac risk.22 Regarding frequency of PA, we
showed that two 30-minute sessions/wk of physical exercise,
or an increase to that level within the first year post-MI, were
related to lowered mortality post-MI, while 0 to 1 sessions/
wk seems be too little. The lowered mortality related to
activity may be even smaller, as self-reported PA generally is
higher than the levels found by more objective measures,
such as accelerometry.30 Interestingly, these findings are
consistent with the findings of Hansen et al, showing that a
smaller exercise volume during phase II rehabilitation gener-
ated equal long-term clinical benefits, compared with a
greater exercise volume.26 Such findings may be associated
with a lower compliance of greater exercise volumes and
higher-intensity activity.
Thus, the findings of the present study may have
important clinical implications, since although universally
recommended,10 PA is still underutilized as part of preventive
and treatment strategies in health care. This is troublesome,
since other commonly used components in secondary
prevention, such as patient education, have been shown to
be less efficient.15 The shown relation to survival, in patients
who maintain or increase their level of PA post-MI, reinforces
the importance of the present guidelines and highlights the
need for improved secondary prevention including the imple-
mentation of PA advice as part of regular postinfarction
treatment. At present not enough is known regarding how to

 design effective counseling for increased PA among MI
survivors, despite many studies. Promising initiatives and
methods, such as PA on prescription (PAP) and Exercise is
medicine (EiM), have been shown to increase the level of
PA,31,32 and may receive a large boost, as a result of the
present findings, but need to be investigated further in
patients with MI before it can be suggested to be an
alternative to exercise-based rehabilitation. Other interven-
tions include different forms of automated feedback from
wearable electronic devices. One such system has been
tested in a randomized clinical trial study, reporting important
changes in activity levels,33 although contradicting data have
been published.34 Patients should receive counseling on PA
after having an MI, and this could be offered as a continuation
of, or as an alternative to, cardiac rehabilitation, when this is
not available.
An obvious strength of the present study is the large
sample size, and its representativeness of the whole Swedish
MI population over 10 years. The large sample size allows us
to perform subgroup analyses on important subgroups, as
described above. In addition, the study took place in the
2000s, confirming the role of changes in PA for secondary
prevention in the modern era of MI treatment, including a high
rate of invasive treatment and effective medication for
secondary prevention.
The mean follow-up time is relatively short, possibly
making the results sensitive to reverse causation. To inves-
tigate this, we undertook analyses with patients with a shorter
follow-up time than 2 years after admission is excluded
(n=3424, 151 deaths). The main analyses were repeated and
only limited and nonsignificant differences were noted, when
applying formal testing.21 This indicated that the effect of
reverse causation might be limited.
A limitation of the study is the exposure measure. The
criterion-related validity of the PA assessment in patients with
MI is unknown. Furthermore, it does not include measures of
sedentary behaviors and variations in intensity of the PA,
which would have added to the study. However, the predictive
validity of the question is strong, as shown by the present
article. Another limitation is the possibility of residual
confounding (ie, although measures were taken to control
for important factors, there is a possibility that some variation
was unmeasured). Also, we lack data on potential important
socioeconomic
variables.
Yet
another
limitation
is
the
absence of nutritional information. This was not included in
the SWEDEHEART registry at the time of this study and
therefore could not be accounted for.
Included and nonincluded patients differ in several aspects,
as noted in the Results section. Included patients were
generally less often smokers, had better eGFR, were less likely
to have had a STEMI, and had a higher survival. Investigating a
cohort biased to be healthier may lead to an underestimation of
the effect of changes in PA. However, the absences of
interaction between the variables in the full model and PA
strata indicates that findings are generally robust across strata
(ie, similar results among those with high/low eGFR, STEMI/
NSTEMI, etc), with the exception of EF. Therefore, it is assumed
that this bias is limited. As mentioned in the Results, PA strata
differ in several aspects. It is possible that, despite both
controlling for these differences and performing stratified
analyses, being inactive serves as a proxy for MI severity or
other ongoing illness. However, the similarities in the stratified
analyses can be taken as an argument against this.
Three categories for exposure to smoking were used. A
more precise measure, such as pack-years, may have reduced
possible residual confounding regarding this variable.
In conclusion, increased PA in the first year post-MI is
associated with a lower risk of subsequent death. This is the
largest study to assess the effects of changes in PA post-MI in
the modern era of MI treatment, in a nationwide represen-
tative cohort. The results of the present study will have great
clinical impact, highlighting the use of PA as part of regular
secondary preventive measures after MI. Hopefully, we now
have no excuses not to improve the adherence to existing
guidelines on secondary prevention.
