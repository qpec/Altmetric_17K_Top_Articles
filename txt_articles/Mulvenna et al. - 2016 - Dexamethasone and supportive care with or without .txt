Summary
Background Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and dexamethasone are widely used to treat brain metastases from 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although there have been no randomised clinical trials showing that WBRT 
improves either quality of life or overall survival. Even after treatment with WBRT, the prognosis of this patient group 
is poor. We aimed to establish whether WBRT could be omitted without a signifi
 cant eff
 ect on survival or quality of life.
Methods The Quality of Life after Treatment for Brain Metastases (QUARTZ) study is a non-inferiority, phase 3 
randomised trial done at 69 UK and three Australian centres. NSCLC patients with brain metastases unsuitable for 
surgical resection or stereotactic radiotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to optimal supportive care (OSC) 
including dexamethasone plus WBRT (20 Gy in fi
 ve daily fractions) or OSC alone (including dexamethasone). The 
dose of dexamethasone was determined by the patients’ symptoms and titrated downwards if symptoms improved. 
Allocation to treatment group was done by a phone call from the hospital to the Medical Research Council Clinical 
Trials Unit at University College London using a minimisation programme with a random element and stratifi
 cation 
by centre, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), gender, status of brain metastases, and the status of primary lung 
cancer. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs were generated from overall 
survival and patients’ weekly completion of the EQ-5D questionnaire. Treatment with OSC alone was considered non-
inferior if it was no more than 7 QALY days worse than treatment with WBRT plus OSC, which required 534 patients 
(80% power, 5% [one-sided] signifi
 cance level). Analysis was done by intention to treat for all randomly assigned 
patients. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN3826061.
Findings Between March 2, 2007, and Aug  29, 2014, 538 patients were recruited from 69 UK and three Australian 
centres, and were randomly assigned to receive either OSC plus WBRT (269) or OSC alone (269). Baseline characteristics 
were balanced between groups, and the median age of participants was 66 years (range 38–85). Signifi
 cantly more 
episodes of drowsiness, hair loss, nausea, and dry or itchy scalp were reported while patients were receiving WBRT, 
although there was no evidence of a diff
 erence in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups. There  was 
no evidence of a diff
 erence in overall survival (hazard ratio 1·06, 95% CI 0·90–1·26), overall quality of life, or 
dexamethasone use between the two groups. The diff
 erence between the mean QALYs was 4·7 days (46·4 QALY days 
for the OSC plus WBRT group vs 41·7 QALY days for the OSC group), with two-sided 90% CI of –12·7 to 3·3. 
Interpretation Although the primary outcome measure result includes the prespecifi
 ed non-inferiority margin, the 
combination of the small diff
 erence in QALYs and the absence of a diff
 erence in survival and quality of life between 
the two groups suggests that WBRT provides little additional clinically signifi
 cant benefi
 t for this patient group.

Introduction
In 2012, 1·82 million cases of lung cancer were diagnosed 
worldwide.1 Overall, up to 30% of patients with non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will present with or 
develop brain metastases subsequently;2,3 for patients 
with stage 3 disease treated with radical intent who 
achieve a partial or complete radiological response, the 
risk of subsequently developing brain metastases is 
50%.4,5 Lung cancer is the most common cause of brain 
metastases, constituting 50–65% of patients within

published epidemiological studies and brain radiotherapy 
trials.6–11 Historically, survival rates after the development 
of metastatic brain disease in patients with NSCLC have 
been consistently lower than for patients with other 
primary cancer sites such as breast cancer9 and range 
from 2 to 6 months,12,13
The practice of giving whole brain radiotherapy 
(WBRT) in combination with steroids (usually dexa-
methasone) is a widely used approach in the 
management of patients with brain metastases based 
mainly on reports from the 1950s–60s.14,15 However, a 
Cochrane review16 in 2012 only identifi
 ed one randomised 
controlled trial (RCT), done by the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) and published in 1971, 
specifi
 cally addressing the effi
  cacy of supportive care 
plus WBRT compared with supportive care alone. This 
study randomised only 48 patients with multiple primary 
tumour sites (30 with lung cancer; the number with 
NSCLC as opposed to small-cell lung cancer was not 
specifi
 ed) to prednisone only or prednisone plus WBRT.17 
The primary outcome was clinical remission, assessed 
by the patients’ neuro 
logical and performance status, 
with overall survival as a secondary outcome. Although 
the investi 
gators con 
cluded that the combination of 
prednisone and radiation off
 ered a slight advantage 
compared with prednisone alone in terms of duration of 
remission and survival, they felt that overall this did not 
justify the use of WBRT as standard treatment because 
the survival benefi
 t it off
 ered was so small.
Nevertheless, WBRT remained standard practice, and 
in the 1970s and 1980s, dose-fi
 nding studies were done 
both in North America6,7 and the UK9 to investigate the 
optimum WBRT regimen from the point of view of 
overall survival. These trials included patients with 
malignancies from all solid primary sites and thus by 
defi
 nition were extremely heterogeneous. In 2007, Rades 
and colleagues18 showed that 20 Gy in fi
 ve fractions 
provided similar survival times for patients with NSCLC 
compared to more protracted regimens. In the UK, 
Europe, Australasia, and Canada, 20 Gy in fi
 ve fractions 
is frequently adopted, whereas ten or more fractions are 
more commonly used in the USA.19,20
In recent years, the potential treatment options for 
metastatic brain disease from NSCLC have continued to 
evolve and increasingly include neurosurgery, stereotactic 
radiosurgery, and systemic treatments. Thus far, only 
patients with a solitary brain metastasis have been shown 
to derive statistically signifi
 cant survival benefi
 t when 
WBRT is combined with focal (surgical or stereotactic) 
management of the intracranial disease.21 The absence of 
level 1 evidence for a survival improvement from focal 
management for patients with more than one brain 
metastasis might be obscured by the competing risk of 
death from extracranial disease.22
Survival outcomes for NSCLC patients with multiple 
brain metastases are poor with radiation, radiosurgery, or 
chemotherapy, alone or in combination, and have hardly 
changed since the original publications of the 1980s.23,24 
Thus, the historically developed treatment of steroids 
and WBRT continues to be a very widely used option, 
particularly when other methods are not feasible.24–30
There have been repeated calls for a defi
 nitive and 
suffi
  ciently powered randomised controlled trial of 
supportive care plus WBRT versus supportive care 
alone.31,32 In view of this and aware that the patients in our 
clinics with brain metastases from NSCLC appeared to 
fare much less well than hoped for when treated with 
WBRT, we designed the Quality of Life After Treatment 
for Brain Metastases (QUARTZ) trial to assess the effi
  cacy 
of WBRT for the treatment of brain metastases from 
NSCLC. We postulated that omission of WBRT would not 
cause an important detriment in quality-adjusted life-years 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is widely used for the treatment 
of brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We 
searched PubMed and the abstracts of major conferences (such as 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology) using the search terms 
“brain metastases”, “irradiation (or radiotherapy)”, and “steroids 
(or corticosteroids)”, with no constraints imposed on the 
timeframe for the search, for randomised evidence to support this 
practice. We found only one relevant randomised clinical trial, 
which recruited 48 patients with brain metastases from various 
primary cancers, and concluded that WBRT off
 ered only limited 
benefi
 t and its use as standard practice was diffi
  cult to justify. 
We identifi
 ed no trials done solely in patients with NSCLC.
Added value of this study
This is the only adequately powered randomised clinical trial 
assessing the use of WBRT in patients with brain metastases 
from NSCLC. Although overall the patients recruited in this 
study had a poorer prognosis than those in previous case series, 
which had provided the evidence base for the use of WBRT in 
this setting, the trial population refl
 ects the typical clinical 
experience, in which very few patients meet the criteria for the 
best prognostic classes.
Implications of all the available evidence
The combined evidence suggests that WBRT off
 ers no 
substantial benefi
 t to most patients with brain metastases 
from NSCLC in terms of improved survival, overall quality of 
life, or reduction in steroid use. The implication for clinical care 
is that optimal supportive care (OSC) is as eff
 ective as OSC plus 
WBRT, and the implication for future research is that potential 
new treatments could be assessed in addition to OSC, rather 
than in addition to, or in place of, WBRT.

(QALYs). The non-inferiority design acknowledged a 
potential reduction in overall survival, but it was thought 
that this would be balanced by an absence of deterioration 
in quality of life as a result of radiation-induced fatigue, 
hair loss, nausea, and scalp discomfort, which would 
justify the omission of standard WBRT.
Methods
Study design and participants
QUARTZ is a multi-centre, randomised, non-inferiority, 
two-arm parallel-group phase 3 trial for patients with 
histologically proven NSCLC and brain metastases 
(confi
 rmed by CT or MRI). This trial was done at 69 UK 
and three Australian hospitals. National ethical approval 
was obtained in the UK (through the North West 
Medical Research and Ethics Committee) and in 
Australia (through the Metro South Health Service 
District Human Research Ethics Committee), with local 
approval at each participating centre. The trial was 
designed to be both pragmatic and inclusive (patients 
with a Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] of <70 were 
eligible). Clinicians were encouraged to approach 
potential participants about the trial if there was 
uncertainty in the clinicians’ or patients’ minds about 
the potential benefi
 t of WBRT, and a multi 
disciplinary 
team that included both neurosurgeons and radiation 
oncologists had concluded that the patient was 
unsuitable for either surgery or stereotactic radio-
therapy. Previous treatment with systemic anticancer 
treatment (chemo 
therapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
[TKI]) was permitted (with predefi
 ned washout periods 
of 4 weeks for chemotherapy and 1 week for TKIs). 
Exclusion criteria included previous radio 
therapy to the 
brain, or previous or current illness thought likely to 
interfere with protocol treatment. Sub 
sequent or 
simultaneous (extracranial) palliative radio 
therapy and 
systemic treatments post-randomi 
sation were permitted 
at the clinician’s discretion, because these were not 
thought to interfere with the effi
  cacy of WBRT, and to 
withhold any further appropriate treatment would be 
unethical. Participants were aged 18 years or older, gave 
informed consent, and had to be able to respond to 
questions about their quality of life, symptoms, and 
side-eff
 ects in weekly telephone assess 
ments. The trial 
was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN3826061. 
The protocol is available online.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 
either optimal supportive care (OSC) plus WBRT or OSC 
alone. Allocation to treatment group was done by a phone 
call (made almost exclusively by the research nurse, who 
then usually followed up the patient) from the hospital to 
the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at 
University College London using a minimisation 
programme with a random element and stratifi
 cation by 
centre, KPS, gender, status of brain metastases (newly 
diagnosed or progressive disease), and status of primary 
lung cancer (absent, controlled, or uncontrolled).
Patients and investigators were not blinded to their 
treatment allocation because to do so would have 
required giving them sham WBRT, which we did not 
believe was justifi
 able on clinical or ethical grounds. In 
addition, travel to receive sham treatments could have 
infl
 uenced the patient’s quality of life, producing a biased 
assessment of quality of life and QALYs in those patients.
Procedures
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 
OSC plus WBRT or OSC alone. OSC included oral 
dexamethasone given with a proton pump inhibitor with 
the dose of steroid determined by the patients’ symptoms 
and titrated downwards if symptoms improved, as well 
as support from a named specialist nurse and immediate 
access to specialised clinicians and palliative care teams. 
WBRT was defi
 ned as 20 Gy in fi
 ve daily fractions ideally 
given over 5–8 days with a 4–8 MV linear accelerator with 
two parallel opposed fi
 elds, commenced as soon as was 
practical after randomisation.
Anticancer treatments, patient-reported symptoms 
and quality of life (using the EuroQol EQ-5D 3L 
questionnaire)33 were recorded before randomisation and 
through weekly telephone assessments or clinic visits for 
at least 12 weeks from randomisation and monthly there-
after. Data on carers’ experiences and their perception of 
the patient’s symptoms and quality of life were collected 
and will be reported separately.
Statistical analysis
QUARTZ is a non-inferiority trial assessing the omission 
of WBRT with a primary outcome measure of QALYs. 
QALYs were chosen as the primary outcome measure 
because both quality of life and survival were considered 
to be key outcome measures for patients, their families, 
and treating physicians, and would provide the most 
useful interpretation of the data. Given the poor 
prognosis of this population, a relatively small boundary 
for assessing non-inferiority was needed. At the time of 
the design, following discussions within the Trial 
Management Group and with clinicians in the UK, we

decided that a reduction in QALYs of no more than 
1 week would convince the clinical and patient 
communities that WBRT could be omitted from standard 
practice. An initial estimate of 6 weeks for the median 
QALY in the WBRT plus OSC group based on a study by 
Gerrard and colleagues34 was used to obtain the original 
sample size of 1036 patients with a hazard ratio (HR) of 
1·2, 80% power, and a one-sided 2·5% signifi
 cance level.
Once 50 patients had been randomly assigned to the 
WBRT plus OSC group, a pre-planned review of the 
sample size was done. The average QALY in the WBRT 
plus OSC group was 5 weeks and the sample size was re-
calculated. Simultaneously, owing to slow recruitment, 
the Trial Steering Committee approved changing the 
signifi
 cance level to a one-sided 5% level, while retaining 
the 1-week non-inferiority boundary (and consequent 
HR of 1·25), resulting in a revised sample size of 
534 patients. These changes were made blind to the 
accumulating results from the trial (ie without assessing 
data from the OSC only group).
We recognised that recruitment to QUARTZ would be 
challenging, primarily because of the absence of 
randomised data to inform and support discussion of the 
trial with patients and colleagues alike. 3 years after 
starting QUARTZ, and despite the reduction in target 
sample size, accrual rates remained below target and the 
Trial Management Group took the unusual step of 
formally asking the independent Trial Steering Com-
mittee if interim data from the initial cohort recruited to 
QUARTZ (151 patients) could be released.35 This decision 
was made blind to the accumulating results from the 
trial. After the interim release, the accrual rate improved 
and was maintained, reaching the required total in 
August, 2014.
Secondary outcome measures included overall 
survival and quality of life. QALYs were estimated and 
compared using the methods described by Billingham 
and Abrams.36 From each completed EQ-5D question-
naire, a utility score was generated, which ranged from 
1 (where a patient reported no problems for all fi
 ve 
questions) to –0·59 (where a patient reported severe 
problems for all fi
 ve questions). The average utility 
score of all surviving uncensored patients was 
calculated at every point where an assessment took 
place, and multiplied by the value of the survivor 
function whenever either the survivor function or the 
average utility score changed. The estimated mean 
QALY was then calculated as the area under the 
resultant step curve for each treatment group, with CIs 
estimated using bootstrapping. Overall survival was 
calculated as the time from randomisation until death 
from any cause, with survivors having their data 
censored at the time they were last known to be alive. 
Treatment groups were compared with a stratifi
 ed log-
rank test and hazard ratios calculated with Cox 
proportional hazard models, with adjustment for the 
stratifi
 cation factors used at randomisation. Median 
survival estimates were obtained from a fl
 exible 
parametric survival model with adjustment for the 
same factors. Although the sample size calculation for 
this non-inferiority trial was based on a one-sided 5% 
signifi
 cance level, the primary outcome results are 
presented with a two-sided 90% CI. The critical value

for the one-sided 5% signifi
 cance level and the upper 
bound of the two-sided 90% CI are equivalent. Quality 
of life, as reported using the EQ-5D 3L questionnaire, 
and KPS were each compared at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-
randomisation, using analysis of variance with 
adjustment for baseline values.
Role of the funding source
The study was funded by Cancer Research UK and the 
Medical Research Council (UK), and the National Health 
and Medical Research Council (Australia). Cancer 
Research UK reviewed and approved the study design, 
and neither funder had any role in data collection, data 
analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the 
study, and had fi
 nal responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication. 
Results
Between March 2, 2007, and Aug 29, 2014, 538 patients 
from 69 UK and three Australian centres were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to receive either OSC plus WBRT (269), or 
OSC alone (269). All randomly assigned patients were 
included in these analyses, on an intention-to-treat basis. 
Although an analysis using a per-protocol population is 
also customary in non-inferiority trials, we believe it is 
not appropriate here because only one group receives a 
formal treatment regimen and therefore omission of 
patients from any analysis based on them receiving 
treatments would probably bias results because poorly 
performing patients would only be removed from the 
WBRT group. More than 90% of the expected follow-up 
forms were received, with 80% of expected quality-of-life 
forms completely fi
 lled in, and one patient lost to follow-
up (fi
 gure 1). The baseline characteristics of the two 
groups were well balanced (table 1), and data are available 
for all 538 patients unless otherwise stated: 314 (58%) 
were male, median age was 66 years (range 38–85 years), 
and 203 (38%) had a KPS of less than 70. Brain metastases 
were diagnosed within the 8 weeks before randomisation 
in 467 (87%) patients, and a solitary brain metastasis was 
present in 162 (30%) of 533 patients. Symptoms and 
quality of life at baseline were similar between the two 
groups (table 2).
The primary outcome measure is QALYs, which 
combines overall survival and quality of life. The mean 
(SD) QALY for patients assigned to the OSC plus WBRT 
group was 46·4 days (3·66), and for those assigned to the 
OSC group was 41·7 days (3·23; fi

Symptoms are ordered according to descending prevalence at randomisation. 
Percentages are calculated for patients with non-missing data, not all 
randomised patients. Symptoms were reported on a four-point scale: none, mild, 
moderate, or severe. Quality of life was reported on a three-point scale: no 
problems, some problems, severe problems. Patients are classifi
 ed as having 
moderate or severe quality of life issues if they provide any of the following 
answers: mobility (“some problems walking about” or “confi
 ned to bed”); 
self-care (“some problems with washing or dressing” or “unable to wash or 
dress”); usual activities (“some problems performing usual activities” or “unable 
to perform usual activities”); pain or discomfort (“moderate pain or discomfort” 
or “extreme pain or discomfort”); and anxiety or depression (“moderately 
anxious or depressed” or “extremely anxious or depressed”). WBRT=whole brain 
radiotherapy. OSC=optimal supportive care.

of –4·7 QALY days in favour of WBRT (90% CI of –12·7 
to 3·3; appendix p 12).
At 4 weeks there was little diff
 erence in symptoms and 
side-eff
 ects between the two groups (appendix p 1). Data 
were collected for 20 diff
 erent symptoms and side-eff
 ects. 
Those receiving OSC plus WBRT reported more 
moderate or severe episodes of drowsiness than those 
receiving OSC alone (67 [42%] of 159 vs 39 [28%] of 139, 
respectively, p=0·0151), hair loss (51 [34%] of 149 vs 1 [1%] 
of 137, respectively, p=0·0001), nausea (15 [10%] of 151 vs 
3 [2%] of 139, respectively, p=0·0067), and dry or itchy 
scalp (11 (7%] of 148 vs 1 [1%] of 138, respectively, 
p=0·0057; appendix p 1).
There was little diff
 erence in the number of serious 
adverse events reported in the two groups (table 3). 
Overall, 89 patients receiving OSC plus WBRT and 
82 patients receiving OSC reported at least one serious 
adverse event over the course of the trial. The most 
commonly reported events were infections, neurological 
problems, and pulmonary problems, with no evidence of 
any diff
 erence between groups in the rate of any event. 
Quality-of-life assessments (with the EQ-5D) were 
generally well completed, with a median of six assess-
ments per patient for those in the OSC plus WBRT group 
(IQR 3–11, range 1–36), and fi
 ve assessments for those in 
the OSC alone group (IQR 3–10, range 1–28). Quality of 
life, as measured by the utility score generated from the 
EQ-5D 3L responses, remained similar over time 
(fi
 gure 2B), with no signifi
 cant diff
 erences between the 
groups at 4, 8, or 12 weeks. The number of patients with 
maintained or improved quality of life compared with 
baseline was also similar between the groups at 4 weeks 
(81 [54%] of 149 patients receiving OSC plus WBRT vs 80 
(57%) of 140 patients receiving OSC), 8 weeks (40 [44%] 
of 90 patients receiving OSC plus WBRT vs 40 [51%] of 
78 patients receiving OSC), and 12 weeks (24 [44%] 
of 54 patients receiving OSC plus WBRT vs 21 [49%] of 
43 patients receiving OSC).
KPS changes were similar between the two groups, 
with no signifi
 cant diff
 erences at 4, 8, or 12 weeks 
(p=0·9272, p=0·2823, and p=0·0724, respectively), with 
average performance status decreasing slightly over 
time. The mean (SD) decline in KPS compared with 
baseline at 4, 8, and 12 weeks was 8·3 (13·89), 11·3 
(13·03), and 18·0 (15·53), respectively, for patients 
receiving OSC plus WBRT, versus 8·5 (14·52), 13·4 
(15·91), and 13·4 (13·66), respectively, for patients 
receiving OSC.
At randomisation 525 (98%) of 538 patients received 
dexamethasone (median 8 mg a day). By 4 weeks post-
randomisation, 11 (5%) of 233 patients receiving OSC 
and 16 (7%) of 245 patients receiving OSC plus WBRT 
had spent some time off
  dexamethasone (p=0·4328), and 
this number increased to 24 (10%) of 233 and 30 (12%) of 
245, respectively, at 8 weeks (p=0·5641). Most patients 
had their dexamethasone dose decreased compared with 
the initial dose given at randomisation: during the fi
 rst 
4 weeks 142 (61%) of 233 patients receiving OSC and 143 
(58%) of 245 patients receiving WBRT plus OSC had 
their dose reduced (p=0·5771); during the fi
 rst 8 weeks 
153 (66%) of 233 patients receiving OSC and 167 (68%) of 
245 patients receiving WBRT plus OSC had their dose 
reduced (p-=0·6268). Dexamethasone use over the fi
 rst 
8 weeks post-randomisation is shown in more detail in 
the appendix (p 5, 10, 11).
In the OSC plus WBRT group (n=269), 93 (35%) 
patients 
started 
radiotherapy 
within 
7 
days 
of 
randomisation, 97 (36%) within 8–14 days, and 49 (18%) 
after more than 14 days. 30 patients (11%) received no 
radiotherapy, 222 (83%) received 20 Gy, and 17 (6%) 
received less than 20 Gy. Of the 30 patients assigned to, 
but who did not receive WBRT, ten died before starting 
radiotherapy, 14 were considered too ill or their disease 
had progressed, fi
 ve refused treatment (one of these 
patients did later receive WBRT 6 months after 
randomisation), and one could not be contacted. Of the 
17 patients who received less than 20 Gy, two were treated 
using a 12 Gy in two fractions regimen in error, and the 
remaining 15 were considered too unwell to complete 
their treatment.
More patients reported receiving additional anticancer 
therapy in the OSC group (86 [35%] of 246 patients) than 
in the OSC plus WBRT group (54 [21%] of 259 patients, 
p=0·0005). This diff
 erence was predominantly due to an 
increase in the amount of radiotherapy given (55 [22%] 
of 246 patients receiving OSC compared with 27 [10%] of

259 patients receiving OSC plus WBRT), with the thorax 
being the most common site of treatment, although 
seven patients, assigned to receive OSC alone, also 
received WBRT. Use of chemo 
therapy, surgery, and TKIs 
was similar between the two groups: 42 patients received 
chemotherapy (17 receiving OSC plus WBRT and 
25 receiving OSC), 29 received TKI (14 receiving OSC 
plus WBRT and 15 receiving OSC) and seven patients 
received both (three receiving OSC plus WBRT and four 
receiving OSC).
Overall survival in the two groups was similar (HR 1·06, 
95% CI 0·90–1·26, p=0·8084; fi
 gure 2A). By the time of 
analysis, 536 of the 538 patients had died (267 in the OSC 
plus WBRT group and 269 in the OSC alone group) with 
a median survival (estimated from a fl
 exible parametric 
model) of 9·2 weeks (95% CI 7·2–11·1) for patients who 
received OSC plus WBRT and 8·5 weeks (95% CI 
7·1–9·9) for patients who received OSC. Of the two 
surviving patients, one was still participating in the trial, 
and one has been lost to follow-up. Cause of death was 
available for 531 patients, with 519 (98%) reported as 
having a disease-related death.
 Analyses of the eff
 ect of WBRT on overall survival in 
diff
 erent subgroups are presented in fi
 gure 3 and the 
appendix (p  6). A signifi
 cant interaction was found between 
treatment group and age (p=0·0062), and a non-signifi
 cant 
association between treatment group and KPS (p=0·0964) 
and status of NSCLC (p=0·0941), suggesting a possible 
 
diff
 erence in treatment eff
 ect across values of these factors. 
Younger patients, particularly those aged younger than 
60 years, show improved survival with WBRT (fi
 gure 3, 
appendix p 6). The non-signifi
 cant associations with KPS 
and primary NSCLC status suggested a potential survival 
benefi
 t with WBRT for patients with KPS of at least 70, and 
those with controlled NSCLC. When assessing the 
predictive eff
 ect of the recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 
and graded prognostic assessment (GPA) prognostic 
classes, there was no evidence that WBRT off
 ered a survival 
advantage within any particular class (p=0·2762 for RPA 
and p=0·2642 for GPA). There were, however, non-
signifi
 cant associations which suggested a potential 
survival benefi
 t with WBRT in the better prognostic groups 
(those with better reported survival) (p=0·0843 for RPA and 
p=0·0812 for GPA).
Discussion
The QUARTZ trial is the sole adequately powered RCT 
specifi
 cally addressing the effi
  cacy of supportive care 
plus WBRT compared with supportive care alone in 
patients with NSCLC. The data from the whole trial 
population suggest that WBRT can be omitted and 
patients treated with OSC alone, without an important 
reduction in either overall survival or quality of life. The 
estimate of the diff
 erence in QALYs was –4·7 days for the 
omission of WBRT. Similarly, there was just a 0·7 week 
(approximately 5 days) diff
 erence in median survival 
between the two groups, highlighting both the poor

prognosis of this patient group and the limited benefi
 t 
off
 ered by WBRT.
The interaction analyses assessing the consistency of 
eff
 ect across subgroups (acknowledging that some of 
these were small and thus underpowered to detect 
diff
 erences, and only produce interactions of borderline 
statistical signifi
 cance) suggest that the size of this eff
 ect 
might not be uniform across the full range of patient 
characteristics. Improved survival with WBRT was 
shown for younger patients, particularly those aged 
younger than 60 years (fi
 gure 3, appendix p 6). Other, 
non-signifi
 cant, associations also suggested a potential 
survival benefi
 t with WBRT for patients with good 
performance status and a controlled primary NSCLC, 
although WBRT did not show a statistically signifi
 cant 
benefi
 t in these latter two groups. Outside these groups 
(ie, older patients, those with poor performance status, or 
those with an uncontrolled primary NSCLC), WBRT 
appears to off
 er no benefi
 t in terms of either survival or 
quality of life. These subgroups fall broadly in line with 
both the RPA8 and disease-specifi
 c Graded Prognostic 
Assessments (ds-GPA),10 both developed by the Radiation 
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). Since the RPA 
prognostic classes were described, the oncology 
community has broadly concluded that those patients 
who fell into the better RPA classes 1 and 2 required 
WBRT, whereas those within the poorest prognostic 
group (class 3, median survival 2·3 months) did not 
require WBRT, despite the absence of a solid evidence 
base to support this approach.16 Patients who fell within 
RPA class 3 were thus excluded from any subsequent 
brain metastases trials that involved radiotherapy.
In routine clinical practice, only 3·5–7·5% of patients 
with brain metastases fall into RPA class 1 and conversely, 
40–50% fall into RPA class 3.37–39 Although the RPA class 
3 patients have been excluded from clinical studies, 
clinicians continue to consider and frequently off
 er 
WBRT to this group because of the absence of alternative 
treatment options.20 The QUARTZ trial was the fi
 rst 
opportunity to assess all these prognostic classes in a 
randomised setting, both in terms of their prognostic 
eff
 ect and their ability to predict WBRT benefi
 t.
In line with everyday clinical experience, our data 
included only 30 (6%) of 533 RPA class 1 patients, and so 
we are unable to make any defi
 nitive statements about 
the benefi
 t of WBRT in this group. We saw a non-
signifi
 cant association between RPA and treatment 
group, which suggested a potential benefi
 t with WBRT

with better RPA class, but further evidence is needed to 
fi
 rmly establish the size of any eff
 ect for patients who fell 
within RPA class 1. Importantly, patients who fell within 
RPA class 2 (301 [56%] of the 533 patients in the 
QUARTZ cohort), who have previously been thought to 
require and potentially benefi
 t from WBRT, seemed to 
derive no clinically signifi
 cant benefi
 t from this 
treatment. In addition, QUARTZ has now provided data 
to back up the belief that WBRT should not be seen as a 
benefi
 cial palliative treatment for patients falling within 
RPA class 3. Similarly, our data suggest that WBRT 
might still have a role for patients with the best prognoses 
according to GPA categories (those with scores of at least 
2·5), but off
 ers no benefi
 t over supportive care alone for 
patients with lower scores and poorer prognoses.
A long-held belief is that treatment with WBRT allows 
patients to reduce and stop treatment with steroids. In 
our trial, the addition of WBRT to OSC was not associated 
with a signifi
 cant reduction in dexamethasone dose or 
use in the fi
 rst 8 weeks from randomisation, and 
challenges the dogma that WBRT can be seen as a 
potential steroid-sparing modality. At the time of 
randomisation, 373 (84%) of 443 patients had shown a 
clinical response to dexamethasone, and although the 
fi
 gure seen in the wider patient population might be 
expected to be slightly lower than this, it does serve as a 
reminder that steroids are highly eff
 ective at alleviating 
many of the symptoms experienced by patients at the 
time of presentation.
Importantly we have shown that randomised clinical 
trials within this population are possible, and have 
collected a large set of high quality data. QUARTZ was a 
very pragmatic trial, with few inclusion and exclusion 
criteria beyond there being clinician or patient 
uncertainty as to the benefi
 t of WBRT. The trial did not 
mandate extra clinic visits, with most data being 
collected via telephone calls between the patient and 
their nurse, which resulted in a good amount of data 
completion despite this being required on a weekly 
basis. Although it is undeniably challenging to discuss 
clinical trials within a poor prognosis patient group, 
particularly if one option is to omit a common treatment 
and recruitment was slower than originally hoped, it is a 
credit to the patients, carers, nurses, and clinicians that 
these discussions did take place and recruitment to the 
trial was ultimately successful.
The primary outcome for QUARTZ was patient-
reported QALYs. Given the potentially poor prognosis for 
this group of patients, this was considered the most 
appropriate measure. Hence, the EQ-5D tool was used. 
Although this is not a brain-specifi
 c quality-of-life tool, it 
does allow accurate calculation of a Health Utility Index 
which, when combined with overall survival, provides a 
measurement of QALY. Data from the EQ-5D responses 
showed that there was no evidence of a diff
 erence in 
quality of life, and detailed symptom data show only 
small diff
 erences in symptom patterns after treatment 
with WBRT (with increased levels of drowsiness, hair 
loss, nausea, and dry or itchy scalp). We decided not to 
overburden patients by collecting further quality-of-life 
data, but we acknowledge this as a limitation of the trial 
because we cannot provide a more disease-specifi
 c 
assessment of quality of life, as would have been provided 
by using a questionnaire such as the EORTC QLQ-
BN20.40 Two further quality-of-life-related aspects of this 
trial have not been presented here, but will be discussed 
in detail in a separate publication. These involve data 
looking at the burden placed upon carers of patients 
within the trial, and the possibility of using a carer’s 
assessment of the patient’s quality of life as a proxy 
measure rather than asking the patient directly.
Another important point to be considered when 
discussing the trial results is that 11% of patients 
randomly assigned to receive WBRT did not receive any 
treatment, in the majority of cases because of rapid 
disease progression or death. We have not been able to 
fi
 nd any factors from these patients that would have 
allowed them to be identifi
 ed as likely to have disease 
progression or die before trial entry, and believe this 
refl
 ects the clinical reality of this patient group, in which 
substantial deterioration can be rapid and unpredicted. 
Although this might be viewed as a criticism of the 
patient selection in the trial, it is potentially of value to 
both clinicians and patients, particularly when there is 
uncertainty about the value of WBRT.
The overall survival of patients in this trial was short, 
although not inconsistent with our predicted survival 
times on which we based the sample size calculations,34 
and represents everyday clinical experience. Comparison 
with retrospective case series such as those published by 
the RTOG,10 for example where the median survival was 
around 7 months, is not straightforward for a number of 
reasons. First, such studies only include patients who 
receive WBRT, and so the 11% of patients in the WBRT 
group for whom WBRT was planned but could not be 
given, generally due to rapid decline, would have been 
excluded. Second, survival in such studies is usually 
measured from the date of diagnosis whereas in 
QUARTZ, the survival time is from the date of 
randomisation, with a median time between diagnosis 
and randomisation of 25 days. Finally, the fi
 gure of 
7 months median survival is for all patients with NSCLC, 
including those who had surgery and stereotactic 
radiosurgery (ie, the patients with a better prognosis who 
were excluded from QUARTZ). The median survival in 
the RTOG series for patients who received WBRT alone 
was 3·42 months, which is much more similar to the 
fi
 gure seen in this trial.
During the fi
 rst decade of the 21st century, local control 
using stereotactic radiotherapy or surgical resection of 
individual brain metastases emerged as a clinically 
benefi
 cial treatment option for highly selected patients.30 
For patients with potentially durable prognoses, WBRT 
is increasingly seen as a treatment provided in addition

to this local control, or is held in reserve for salvage 
management should new or recurrent brain metastases 
develop at a later date, though without evidence from 
RCTs to support this evolving practice.26,30,41 Use of 
stereotactic radiotherapy continues to develop and is 
starting to be used in a wider patient population, for 
example in patients with a large number of brain 
metastases.42 Although still confi
 ned to the better 
prognosis patients (RPA 1 only), this development could 
further restrict the use of WBRT as a sole treatment.
The systemic treatment paradigms for patients with 
brain metastases from NSCLC have also developed 
because knowledge of the eff
 ect of mutational status has 
grown. Within the UK, routine epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) testing was introduced for patients 
with stage 3B and 4 NSCLC in 2010, and anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement testing became 
routine in 2012. Thus, during the recruitment period 
for QUARTZ, clinicians were increasingly able to 
specifi
 cally assess EGFR mutation and ALK-fusion 
status. Patients with such mutations (around 10% of 
patients for EGFR and 5% for ALK-rearrangement in 
the UK) plus metastatic brain disease might now be 
off
 ered the appropriate systemic targeted treatment, 
frequently as the sole treatment, though their use does 
not preclude the use of WBRT.
In summary, QUARTZ provides compelling infor-
mation for clinicians and patients alike; for younger 
patients, WBRT might off
 er a survival advantage, but for 
all other groups, omitting WBRT does not signifi
 cantly 
aff
 ect QALY or overall survival.
Contributors
