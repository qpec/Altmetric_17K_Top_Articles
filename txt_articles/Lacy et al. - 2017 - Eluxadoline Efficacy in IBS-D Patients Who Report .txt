INTRODUCTION
 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional 
bowel disorder ( 
1,2 
). Th
 e global prevalence of IBS is estimated to 
be 11.2% ( 
2,3 
). IBS can aff
 ect all members of society, irrespective 
of race, creed, color, or socioeconomic status, although women 
are more likely to be aff
 ected by IBS than men ( 
3 
). IBS is associ-
ated with signifi
 cant impairment in quality of life and high rates 
of comorbid conditions ( 
4 
) that imposes a signifi
 cant socio-
economic burden to society in terms of reduced work produc-
tivity and high health-care costs ( 
5,6 
). As defi
 ned in the recent 
Rome criteria ( 
1,7 
), IBS can be subcategorized into three major 
subtypes based on stool patterns: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS 
with constipation, and IBS with mixed symptoms of constipation 
and diarrhea. IBS-D is the most common IBS subtype and com-
prises ∼ 
40% of all cases ( 
3 
).
 
Despite intensive study, there is still no well-established treat-
ment algorithm for IBS-D. Dietary and lifestyle modifi
 cations are 
commonly used for initial symptom management ( 
2 
), although 
many patients continue to suff
 er from chronic symptoms. Clini-
cians oft
 en recommend the use of the over-the-counter antidi-
arrheal agent loperamide, a peripheral μ 
-opioid receptor (OR) 
agonist, to relieve diarrhea ( 
8 
). Th

OBJECTIVES: 
 
Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is often managed with over-the-counter therapies 
such as loperamide, though with limited success. This analysis evaluated the effi
 cacy of eluxadoline 
in patients previously treated with loperamide in two phase 3 studies.
 
METHODS: 
 
Adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were enrolled and randomized to placebo or eluxadoline 
(75 or 100 
mg) twice daily for 26 (IBS-3002) or 52 (IBS-3001) weeks. Patients reported loperamide 
use over the previous year and recorded their rescue loperamide use during the studies. The primary 
effi
 cacy end point was the proportion of patients with a composite response of simultaneous 
improvement in abdominal pain and reduction in diarrhea.
 
RESULTS: 
 
A total of 2,428 patients were enrolled; 36.0% reported prior loperamide use, of whom 61.8% 
reported prior inadequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. Among patients with prior 
loperamide use, a greater proportion treated with eluxadoline (75 and 100 
mg) were composite 
responders vs. those treated with placebo with inadequate prior symptom control, over weeks 
1–12 (26.3% ( 
P 
=0.001) and 27.0% ( 
P 
<0.001) vs. 12.7%, respectively); similar results were 
observed over weeks 1–26. When daily rescue loperamide use was imputed as a nonresponse day, 
the composite responder rate was still higher in patients receiving eluxadoline (75 and 100 
mg) vs. 
placebo over weeks 1–12 ( 
P 
<0.001) and weeks 1–26 ( 
P 
<0.001). Adverse events included nausea 
and abdominal pain.
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
 
Eluxadoline effectively and safely treats IBS-D symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients 
who self-report either adequate or inadequate control of their symptoms with prior loperamide 
treatment, with comparable effi
 cacy and safety irrespective of the use of loperamide as a rescue 
medication during eluxadoline treatment.

FUNCTIONAL GI DISORDERS
Eluxadoline Treatment in Prior Loperamide Use
decreases gastrointestinal (GI) motility that increases the duration 
of intestinal transit, thereby promoting fl
 uid absorption and reduc-
ing stool frequency ( 
9 
). However, there is little clinical evidence 
demonstrating that loperamide is eff
 ective at relieving the cardinal 
symptom of IBS, abdominal pain, nor does loperamide improve 
bloating, the second most commonly reported symptom ( 
10,11 
). 
At approved doses, the use of loperamide in IBS patients can lead to 
the development of unwanted constipation ( 
12 
). Other therapeutic 
options for the treatment of IBS-D include alosetron, a selective 
5-HT 
3 
 receptor antagonist that is restricted by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) to women with chronic, severe IBS-D 
symptoms who have failed to respond to conventional therapy 
( 
11,13 
). Th
 e antibiotic rifaximin, recently approved for the treat-
ment of both men and women with IBS-D, can be eff
 ective in some 
patients, but recurrence of symptoms is common ( 
14,15 
). Th
 ere 
is therefore a large unmet need for new therapeutic agents that 
provide persistent relief for the multiple symptoms of IBS-D.
 
Eluxadoline is a peripherally active, mixed μ 
-OR and κ 
-OR ago-
nist and δ 
-OR antagonist with low systemic absorption and low 
oral bioavailability ( 
16 
) that is approved for the treatment of adults 
with IBS-D in the United States ( 
17 
). Th
 e mixed pharmacological 
profi
 le of eluxadoline may mitigate the risk of constipation eff
 ects 
through unopposed μ 
-OR agonism as seen with agents such as 
loperamide, through antagonism of the δ 
-OR ( 
16 
). Th
 e effi
  cacy of 
eluxadoline was demonstrated in two large, randomized, placebo-
controlled phase 3 trials in patients with IBS-D ( 
18 
). Eluxadoline 
met the primary effi
  cacy composite end point in these trials, dem-
onstrating simultaneous relief of the symptoms of abdominal pain 
and diarrhea associated with IBS-D. In contrast, loperamide has 
not been demonstrated to relieve abdominal pain in previous clini-
cal studies ( 
12,19,20 
). In the phase 3 studies reported by Lembo 
 
et al. ( 
18 
), prior use of loperamide and its adequacy in control-
ling IBS-D symptoms were captured at baseline. Th
 is presented the 
opportunity to determine the effi
  cacy of eluxadoline in patients 
previously treated with loperamide. It was hypothesized that elux-
adoline could provide eff
 ective relief of IBS symptoms in patients 
who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide.
 
Th
 e primary aim of this analysis was to evaluate the effi
  cacy of 
eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D who reported that they did not 
experience adequate symptom relief with prior loperamide therapy. 
Th
 is prespecifi
 ed prospective subgroup analysis evaluated the com-
posite end point response rates in the pooled data from two phase 
3 studies of patients who had previously experienced adequate con-
trol of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide in the year before rand-
omization, and patients who had not experienced adequate IBS-D 
symptom control with loperamide. A secondary aim of this analysis 
was to evaluate loperamide rescue medication use across all treat-
ment arms of the phase 3 studies and its impact on effi
  cacy results.
 
METHODS
 
Study design
 
IBS-3001 and IBS-3002 were parallel-group, randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind multicenter phase 3 studies in adult 
patients with IBS-D ( 
18 
). Th
 e studies comprised a pretreatment 
period followed by 52 (IBS-3001) or 26 (IBS-3002) weeks of 
treatment, during which patients were randomized to receive 
eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg, or placebo, twice daily. Patients under-
went a 2-week posttreatment follow-up period in IBS-3001, or 
a 4-week single-blind placebo withdrawal in IBS-3002. Patients 
were included in the studies if they were 18–80 years of age, with 
a diagnosis of IBS-D (Rome III Criteria ( 
1 
)), and with an average 
worst abdominal pain score of >3.0, an average Bristol Stool Scale 
score for stool consistency of ≥5.5 (on a scale of 1 (hard stool) to 
7 (watery diarrhea)) and ≥5 days with a Bristol Stool Scale score 
of ≥5, and an average IBS-D global symptom score of ≥2.0 (scale 
of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms)). Patients were 
also required to not have used any loperamide rescue medication 
within 14 days before randomization. Patients with current or 
expected use of opioid-containing agents (e.g., antidiarrheals or 
opioid analgesics) were excluded.
 
Primary effi
 cacy end point
 
Th
 e primary effi
  cacy end point of both studies was the propor-
tion of patients who had a composite response on ≥50% of days, 
comprising a simultaneous improvement in abdominal pain and a 
reduction in diarrhea, evaluated over the initial 12 weeks of dou-
ble-blind treatment (FDA end point) and over 26 weeks of treat-
ment (European Medicines Agency end point) ( 
18 
).
 
Assessments
 
Patients were asked during the screening phase of both phase 3 
studies whether they had used loperamide for their IBS-D over 
the past year (yes/no). Patients indicating prior loperamide use 
were asked whether loperamide was used acutely (defi
 ned as use 
for short-term relief, typically not exceeding 6 days of consecutive 
daily use), or chronically (defi
 ned as continuous use for mainte-
nance therapy, typically exceeding ≥2 weeks of consecutive daily 
use), and whether loperamide had provided adequate control of 
their IBS symptoms (yes/no).
 
Use of over-the-counter loperamide rescue medication, pur-
chased by the patient and reimbursed by the sponsor, was per-
mitted during the treatment period for the acute treatment of 
uncontrolled diarrhea. A dose of 2 mg of loperamide was permit-
ted once every 6 h, with the following guidelines: no more than 4 
unit doses over a continuous 24 h time period (8 mg/day), no more 
than 7 unit doses over a continuous 48 h time period (14 mg over 
2 days), and no more than 11 unit doses over a continuous 7-day 
time period (22 mg over 7 days). Patients were asked to record their 
use of loperamide rescue in electronic diaries for 26 weeks (IBS-
3001) or 30 weeks (IBS-3002). Use of above the permitted amount 
of loperamide initiated an automatic alert to the investigator. In the 
event of excessive loperamide rescue use, the status of the patient 
was to be evaluated by the investigator as soon as possible. Treat-
ment discontinuation in the event of excessive loperamide rescue 
use was at the discretion of the investigator.
 
Safety assessments
 
Safety and tolerability of eluxadoline were monitored through-
out the studies through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical

laboratory assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, 
concomitant medications, and physical examinations.
 
Data pooling and statistical analysis
 
Data for patients treated with placebo, or eluxadoline 75 or 
100 mg, were pooled from IBS-3001 and IBS-3002; overall, 
2,428 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive placebo 
( 
n 
=809), eluxadoline 75 mg ( 
n 
=810), or eluxadoline 100 mg 
( 
n 
=809) ( 
18 
). Th
 e intention-to-treat population comprised 2,423 
randomized patients from IBS-3001 and IBS-3002, treated with 
placebo ( 
n 
=809), eluxadoline 75 mg ( 
n 
=808), or eluxadoline 
100 mg ( 
n 
=806).
 
Frequency distributions were used to summarize categorical 
variables and descriptive statistics were used to summarize con-
tinuous variables across treatment groups. All statistical analyses 
were performed using a two-sided hypothesis test at the 5% level of 
signifi
 cance. A subgroup analysis was performed based on patients 
who reported that they did or did not experience adequate IBS-D 
symptom control with loperamide. Th
 e proportion of compos-
ite responders for each subgroup was analyzed using pair-wise 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests for active treatments vs. placebo 
( 
18 
). To assess the impact of loperamide rescue use on composite 
effi
  cacy responder rates over weeks 1–12 and weeks 1–26, a sensi-
tivity analysis was performed where patients were assumed to be 
nonresponders for the daily response on any day where rescue lop-
eramide was used.
 
RESULTS
 
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics
 
In total, 2,428 patients were included in the enrolled set. Th
 e 
mean age ranged from 44.4±13.9 to 47.1±13.8 years, and the 
majority of patients were female in both studies (range across 
treatment groups, 64.8–68.5%) ( 
18 
). Th
 e mean daily worst 
abdominal pain score was >6 across all treatment groups and the 
average number of daily bowel movements ranged from 4.7±2.2 
to 5.0±3.0.
 
Patterns of loperamide usage in the year before randomization
 
Loperamide use in the year before randomization was balanced 
across treatment groups, and 873 (36.0%) patients reported 
prior loperamide use ( 
Table 1 
). Of the patients with prior lop-
eramide use, inadequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loper-
amide was reported in 538 patients across all treatment groups 
(placebo: 58.9%; eluxadoline 75 mg: 67.1%; eluxadoline 100 mg: 
58.8%). Th
 e pattern of loperamide use before randomization 
tended to be mostly acute across all patients who reported prior 
loperamide use, ranging from 84.5 to 88.3%, whereas chronic 
use of loperamide before randomization was less common 
( 
Table 1 
).
 
Composite response rates according to prior symptom control 
with loperamide
 
 
Among the patients who reported prior loperamide use with 
inadequate symptom control, a signifi
 cantly greater proportion 
of patients treated with eluxadoline were composite responders 
over weeks 1–12 compared with those treated with placebo (elux-
adoline 100 mg: 27.0% ( 
P 
<0.001) and 75 mg: 26.3% ( 
P 
=0.001) 
vs. 12.7%, respectively) ( 
Figure 1a 
). Similarly, among patients 
reporting prior loperamide use with adequate symptom control, a 
signifi
 cantly greater proportion of patients treated with eluxado-
line 100 mg were responders compared with those treated with 
placebo (41.8% ( 
P 
=0.006) vs. 25.0%); there was a greater propor-
tion of patients treated with eluxadoline 75 mg who were respond-
ers compared with the placebo group among this subgroup, 
although this did not reach statistical signifi
 cance. A similar 
pattern in composite responder rates was seen for weeks 1–26 
( 
Figure 1b 
). Composite responder rates tended to be higher 
among those patients reporting adequate symptom control with 
loperamide as compared with those without adequate symptom 
control, irrespective of treatment group.
 
Component response rates according to prior symptom control 
with loperamide
 
Analysis of the stool consistency component of the composite 
end point for patients with prior loperamide use with inadequate 
symptom control showed similar results as the composite response 
rate. A signifi
 cantly greater proportion of patients treated with elux-
adoline were stool consistency responders over weeks 1–12 com-
pared with those treated with placebo (eluxadoline 100 mg: 35.6% 
( 
P 
<0.001) and 75 mg: 33.3% ( 
P 
=0.002) vs. 19.3%) ( 
Figure 2a 
). 
Similarly, of those reporting adequate symptom control, a signifi
 -
cantly greater proportion of patients treated with eluxadoline were 
stool consistency responders vs. placebo (eluxadoline 100 mg: 
49.2% ( 
P 
=0.012) and 75 mg: 47.9% ( 
P 
=0.037) vs. 33.6%). Similar 
fi
 ndings were observed for weeks 1–26 ( 
Figure 2b 
). As seen with 
the composite end point, stool consistency responder rates tended 
to be higher in patients reporting prior adequate symptom control

Eluxadoline Treatment in Prior Loperamide Use
with loperamide, and were higher with eluxadoline 100 mg com-
pared with the 75 mg dose.
 
For the composite component end point of abdominal pain, in 
patients reporting inadequate symptom control with loperamide, 
a signifi
 cantly greater proportion of patients treated with elux-
adoline 75 mg were responders over weeks 1–12 compared with 
those treated with placebo (eluxadoline 75 mg: 51.5% ( 
P 
=0.010) vs. 
38.6%) ( 
Figure 3a 
). Th
 ere were a greater proportion of responders 
in the eluxadoline 100 mg group vs. placebo, although this did not 
reach statistical signifi
 cance. In patients reporting adequate symp-
tom control, there were no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in the propor-
tion of responders across patients receiving eluxadoline 100 mg or 
75 mg as compared with those receiving placebo. A similar pattern 
in abdominal pain responder rates was seen for weeks 1–26 
( 
Figure 3b 
).
 
Rescue loperamide use during the study period
 
Th
 e use of rescue loperamide through weeks 1–12 was reported 
in approximately one-quarter of patients, with a slightly greater 
percentage of patients using rescue medication in the placebo 
group compared with patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 
100 mg (31.3% vs. 26.7% and 25.6%, respectively;  
Table 2 
). Th
 e 
percent of patients reporting rescue use was cumulative and 
increased slightly across all treatment groups through weeks 
1–26, and similar to weeks 1–12, more rescue use was reported 
in the placebo group compared with the eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg 
groups (36.0% vs. 32.8% and 31.3%, respectively).
 
Loperamide rescue was used infrequently through weeks 1–3 
and averaged <1 unit dose per week (range, 0.3–0.8 and 0.2–0.9 
unit doses per week in IBS-3001 and IBS-3002, respectively). Th
 e 
use of loperamide rescue each week was similar across all treat-
ment groups, and was similar between the studies. Loperamide 
rescue use remained <1 unit dose per week and declined from 
week 4 through week 26, with an average of 0.2–0.3 unit doses

Of the patients who did not use loperamide rescue at any point 
during the studies, a signifi
 cantly greater proportion of patients 
treated with eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg were responders com-
pared with those treated with placebo over weeks 1–12 (26.4% 
( 
P 
<0.001) and 25.7% ( 
P 
<0.001) vs. 15.3%, respectively) and weeks 
1–26 (26.5% ( 
P 
<0.01) and 28.7% ( 
P 
<0.001) vs. 18.5%, respec-
tively) ( 
Figure 4 
), consistent with the main fi
 ndings for compos-
ite response over weeks 1–12 and weeks 1–26 (ref. ( 
18 
)). When a 
nonresponse was imputed for each day a patient took a dose of 
loperamide medication, similar fi
 ndings were also observed, with 
a greater proportion of patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 
100 mg being responders compared with those treated with pla-
cebo at both weeks 1–12 (25.6% ( 
P 
<0.001) and 26.9% ( 
P 
<0.001) 
vs. 16.4%, respectively) and weeks 1–26 (26.6% ( 
P 
<0.001) and 
30.5% ( 
P 
<0.001) vs. 19.2%, respectively) (

FUNCTIONAL GI DISORDERS
Eluxadoline Treatment in Prior Loperamide Use
that the use of loperamide rescue did not aff
 ect the overall com-
posite responder rate.
 
Safety
 
Overall, among patients with prior loperamide use with inade-
quate prior symptom control, over half in each treatment group 
experienced ≥1 AE (placebo: 50.6%; eluxadoline 75 mg: 59.3%; 
eluxadoline 100 mg: 61.0%;  
Table 3 
). Th
 e most common AEs 
(occurring in ≥2% of patients in any treatment group) were nau-
sea, abdominal pain, constipation, and headache. GI AEs tended 
to be more common in eluxadoline-treated patients, although the 
incidence was generally low (<11%;  
Table 3 
).
 
GI AEs were reported in approximately one-third of patients 
who used rescue loperamide during the studies, across the treat-
ment groups (placebo: 24.7%; eluxadoline 75 mg: 34.2%; eluxado-
line 100 mg: 31.7%;  
Table 4 
). Of these patients, over half in each 
treatment group reported ≥1 GI AE with an onset date aft
 er a 
dose of loperamide (placebo: 16.6%; eluxadoline 75 mg: 22.1%; 
eluxadoline 100 mg: 21.4%). Th
 ere was no clear association bet-
ween the timing of loperamide rescue medication use and the 
reporting of GI AEs, with the majority of events reported >14 days 
aft
 er the most recent loperamide dose. In those patients who had 
used rescue loperamide during the studies, the most common GI 
AEs reported (occurring in ≥2% of patients in any treatment group) 
included constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea ( 
Table 4 
). 
Constipation tended to be more common in patients treated with 
eluxadoline 100 mg compared with eluxadoline 75 mg or placebo 
(6.1% vs. 3.7% and 1.4%, respectively), although incidence was

of treatment, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 
18 
). Th
 e 
results from the present analysis demonstrate that over one-third 
of the patients enrolled in these two phase 3 trials reported lop-
eramide use in the year before study enrollment; however, inad-
equate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide was reported 
in 59–67% of these patients. Th
 ese phase 3 studies are among the 
largest to report on prior loperamide use in patients with IBS-D. 
Th
 e authors acknowledge that unanticipated selection bias may 
have predisposed entry of patients who had previously experi-
enced inadequate symptom control with loperamide use, espe-
cially as the initial question only asked for recall of loperamide use 
within the prior year. Regardless, the cause of inadequate symptom 
control with loperamide in the third of patients who admitted to 
using loperamide is likely to be multifactorial. Importantly, the 
survey instrument did not capture precise reasons for treatment 
failure (such as persistent abdominal pain or persistent diarrhea).
 
Th
 e primary effi
  cacy end point in these studies was a composite 
end point that required patients to achieve ≥30% improvement in 
abdominal pain, with a simultaneous improvement in symptoms 
of diarrhea (assessed using the Bristol Stool Scale) on ≥50% of days 
during the 12- or 26-week study period, in order to be considered 
a responder. Th
 e proportion of composite responders was gener-
ally greater in patients with adequate symptom control with prior 
loperamide vs. those with inadequate symptom control, suggesting 
that patients who have previously responded to one drug may be 
more likely to respond to another. However, a greater proportion 
of patients with IBS-D who reported inadequate symptom control 
with loperamide noted a signifi
 cant improvement in the symptoms 
of abdominal pain and diarrhea when treated with eluxadoline 
compared with placebo; those who reported inadequate control 
with loperamide were twice as likely to respond to eluxadoline 
than to placebo (27% vs. 12.7%;  
P 
=0.001).
 
In addition, analysis of the component end points demonstrated 
that the stool consistency response rate was consistent with that 
of the composite end point, with patients reporting signifi
 cant 
improvements in stool consistency with either dose of eluxadoline 
compared with placebo during the 12- or 26-week study period. 
For the end point of abdominal pain, there was a statistically supe-
rior pain response with eluxadoline 75 mg over placebo, with a 
treatment eff
 ect size of >10% over both the 12- and 26-week study 
periods. However, the 100 mg dose showed no signifi
 cant dif-
ference for this end point compared with placebo. In those with 
prior adequate symptom control with loperamide, the pain results 
mirrored the full analysis reported by Lembo  
et al. ( 
18 
), with no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erences between eluxadoline and placebo at either 
dose level and a greater proportion of responders with placebo. 
Eluxadoline is therefore a treatment option in clinical practice for 
patients with IBS-D who experience inadequate symptom control 
with loperamide, and may signifi
 cantly improve abdominal pain in 
this patient population at the dose of 75 mg.
 
Th
 ese studies were not designed for direct comparison of 
the effi
  cacy of eluxadoline with that of loperamide, especially 
with respect to long-term therapy, as only ∼ 
14% of patients took 
loperamide chronically. Th
 e extent to which one agent works 
better than the other for the individual symptoms of diarrhea or 
generally low. Th
 e incidence of constipation in these patients was 
similar to that observed in the full phase 3 population safety set 
(placebo: 2.5%; eluxadoline 75 mg: 7.4%; eluxadoline 100 mg: 8.6% 
(B.D. Cash  
et al. 
, unpublished data) ( 
18 
)).
 
DISCUSSION
 
Th
 e high prevalence of IBS ( 
3 
) ensures that many health-care pro-
viders across diverse specialties will encounter patients with IBS 
in their practice. Th
 ere is therefore a need for health-care pro-
viders to properly evaluate and treat patients with IBS. However, 
the treatment of IBS-D remains problematic for many providers 
for a number of reasons, including the lack of validated treat-
ment guidelines, the lack of familiarity with eff
 ective therapies, 
the absence of prospective studies evaluating sequential therapy 
for IBS-D, the lack of head-to-head comparison studies directly 
comparing diff
 erent therapeutic agents, and the inherent hetero-
geneity of the disease, with the result that a large proportion of 
patients with IBS-D express dissatisfaction with the treatment 
received for their IBS symptoms ( 
21 
). Th
 e persistence of diar-
rhea in IBS-D leads many health-care providers to recommend an 
over-the-counter agent, such as loperamide, that is inexpensive 
and generally considered safe, although it has little eff
 ect on the 
symptoms of abdominal pain or bloating ( 
10,11 
).
 
Eluxadoline was approved by the FDA in May 2015 for the treat-
ment of both men and women with IBS-D ( 
17 
), and represents 
a treatment option for patients including those with inadequate 
symptom control with the common over-the-counter antidiarrheal 
agent loperamide. Eluxadoline signifi
 cantly improved the overall 
symptoms of IBS-D in two large, randomized, placebo-controlled 
phase 3 studies involving >2,400 patients, during 12 and 26 weeks

FUNCTIONAL GI DISORDERS
Eluxadoline Treatment in Prior Loperamide Use
abdominal pain, or a composite of both, remains unclear and no 
conclusions can be drawn with respect to comparison of the two 
agents. It is notable, however, that the small studies performed pre-
viously, evaluating the effi
  cacy of loperamide for the treatment of 
IBS-D ( 
20,22 
), did not include the combined responder end point 
now required by the FDA ( 
23 
). Direct comparison of the effi
  cacy 
and safety of loperamide with that of eluxadoline in patients with 
IBS-D using up-to-date end points remains an important area for 
future investigation.
 
During the 12- and 26-week phase 3 studies, loperamide was 
available for study patients to use as a rescue medication; its use 
was less common in patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg 
compared with those who received placebo (25.6% and 26.7% 
vs. 31.3%, respectively), and this may suggest superior treatment 
satisfaction with eluxadoline. Using imputed nonresponse when 
rescue loperamide was used, these analyses demonstrated that the 
use of rescue loperamide in the two phase 3 studies did not aff
 ect 
the composite responder rates with eluxadoline compared with 
placebo, and patients receiving eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg showed 
signifi
 cantly higher responder rates than the placebo group (25.6% 
and 26.9% vs. 16.4%, respectively). Th
 e exact reasons for rescue 
loperamide use were not collected in these studies.
 
Safety fi
 ndings with eluxadoline in patients who reported inad-
equate symptom control with loperamide were consistent with the 
fi
 ndings from the overall phase 3 patient population ( 
18 
) and the 
known safety profi
 le of eluxadoline (B.D. Cash  
et al. 
, unpublished 
data); over half of patients with inadequate symptom control with 
prior loperamide experienced AEs with eluxadoline, of which GI 
AEs (nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation) were the most fre-
quent, although overall incidences were low. Of the patients who 
used rescue loperamide during the studies and reported GI AEs, 
over half reported ≥1 GI AE with an onset date aft
 er loperamide 
use. However, there was no clear temporal relationship between 
loperamide use and the occurrence of GI AEs. Constipation was 
more frequently reported in patients treated with eluxadoline 
compared with placebo, though the incidence was low and con-
sistent with that from the overall phase 3 patient population (B.D. 
Cash  
et al. 
, unpublished data).
 
Th
 e primary end point of these two large, prospective trials 
focused on effi
  cacy and safety. Although data collection for the tri-
als was prospective, the present study represents a subgroup of the 
initial study, with the inherent limitations of such an analysis. Th
 at 
said, the large sample size and the prospective nature of the analy-
ses minimizes these limitations. Furthermore, although many of 
the study patients had used loperamide during the year before 
study initiation, over half of the patients had not, and past use of 
loperamide relied upon patient recollection that may be unreliable 
and cannot be confi
 rmed. Indeed, the exact dose of loperamide 
used by patients who reported inadequate symptom control with 
prior loperamide remains unknown; therefore, a comparison of 
patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior lop-
eramide at one dose compared with another dose is not possible.
 
 
In conclusion, eluxadoline is a therapeutic agent with a unique 
mechanism of action approved for the treatment of IBS-D 
in both men and women. A large phase 2 study and two large, 
prospective phase 3 studies have demonstrated that eluxadoline 
can eff
 ectively treat simultaneous symptoms of abdominal 
pain and diarrhea in patients with IBS-D. Th
 e current analyses 
demonstrate that eluxadoline can eff
 ectively treat IBS-D symptoms 
in patients who report inadequate relief with prior loperamide as 
well as in those who report adequate relief with prior loperamide. 
In addition, patients who took loperamide as a rescue medication 
during blinded study participation had nearly identical response 
rates and did not exhibit a greater number of AEs as compared 
with the population overall. Th
 ese fi
 ndings are clinically relevant 
as they demonstrate to health-care providers that eluxadoline is an 
effi
  cacious and safe treatment option for the majority of patients 
diagnosed with IBS-D, irrespective of prior treatment experience 
with loperamide.

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a 
common gastrointestinal disorder for which there is no 
established treatment algorithm. 
 
✓ 
 
IBS-D is often managed with the over-the-counter 
antidiarrheal agent loperamide. 
 
✓ 
 
Eluxadoline is a mixed μ 
-opioid receptor (OR) and κ 
-OR 
agonist and δ 
-OR antagonist approved for the treatment of 
IBS-D. 
 
✓ 
 
The effi
 cacy of eluxadoline in patients previously treated 
with loperamide in two large phase 3 studies has not been 
characterized. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
Loperamide was used in approximately one-third of 
patients with IBS-D. 
 
✓ 
 
Loperamide provided inadequate symptom control in 
approximately two-thirds of patients. 
 
✓ 
 
Eluxadoline showed signifi
 cant improvements in abdominal 
symptoms and diarrhea vs. placebo, irrespective of prior 
symptom control with loperamide. 
 
✓ 
 
Symptoms were also signifi
 cantly improved with eluxado-
line vs. placebo in patients who used rescue loperamide 
during the studies.
