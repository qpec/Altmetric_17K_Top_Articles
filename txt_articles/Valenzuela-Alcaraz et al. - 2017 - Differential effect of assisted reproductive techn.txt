ABSTRACT
Objective Fetuses conceived by assisted reproductive
technology (ART) and those that are small-for-gestational
age (SGA) show cardiovascular remodeling in utero;
however, these two conditions are often associated. We
aimed to evaluate the differential effect of ART and SGA
on fetal cardiac remodeling.
Methods This
was
a
prospective
cohort
study
of
term singleton pregnancies seen at our department
between April 2011 and September 2013. The cohort
was
divided
according
to
fetal
growth
and
mode
of conception into the following four groups: 102
appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetuses conceived
spontaneously (controls), 72 AGA fetuses conceived by
ART (ART-AGA), 31 SGA fetuses conceived by ART
(ART-SGA) and 28 SGA fetuses conceived naturally
(Spont-SGA). SGA was defined as birth weight < 10th
centile. Fetal echocardiography was performed at 28–32
weeks
to
assess
cardiac
dimensions,
geometry
and
function.

INTRODUCTION
The concept that perinatal environment may influence
fetal cardiovascular structure and function has been
described extensively1. It was first demonstrated in
small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses, which constitute
7–10% of all pregnancies and are a major cause of
perinatal morbidity and mortality2. SGA fetuses have
remodeled and less efficient hearts and more globular
ventricles,
with
decreased
longitudinal
motion
and
impaired relaxation. These changes are present in utero
and persist after birth3,4. Fetal cardiovascular remodeling
is thought to explain partially the association between
low birth weight and subsequent cardiovascular disease
and mortality in adulthood that has been demonstrated
by numerous epidemiological studies5,6.

Recent data also suggest that conception by assisted
reproductive technology (ART) can lead to fetal car-
diovascular remodeling7–9. ART is used worldwide and
represents 1–4% of births in developed countries10.
Fetuses conceived by ART have been shown to present
globular hearts, dilated atria and decreased longitudinal
cardiac function in utero9, together with changes in vascu-
lature that persist until adolescence11–13. However, given
the higher incidence of SGA among pregnancies conceived
by ART, it is unclear to what extent SGA may contribute
to the degree and nature of cardiac remodeling observed.
On the other hand, most studies reporting cardiovascular
changes in SGA fetuses did not account for the potential
effect of mode of conception.
We aimed to evaluate the differential effects of SGA
and ART on fetal cardiovascular development. For
that purpose, fetal echocardiography was performed in
a large cohort of fetuses that included four clinical
groups: normally grown spontaneously conceived fetuses
(controls), normally grown ART fetuses, SGA fetuses
conceived by ART and spontaneously conceived SGA
fetuses.
METHODS
Study populations and protocol
This was a prospective cohort study of singleton preg-
nancies delivered at term that attended the Department
of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at BCNatal in Barcelona,
Spain, at 28–32 weeks’ gestation from April 2011 to
September 2013. Pregnancies with structural or chromo-
somal anomalies, evidence of infection or any maternal
medical disease, including asthma, chronic hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, heart disease, human immunodeficiency
virus, hepatitis infection, lupus or thyroid disease, were
excluded. For the purpose of this study, only fetuses that
were delivered > 37 weeks of gestation were included in
order to avoid the potential interaction of prematurity.
Gestational age was calculated according to crown–rump
length at the first-trimester ultrasound scan.
The study population was subdivided into four groups:
102 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetuses con-
ceived spontaneously (controls), 72 AGA fetuses con-
ceived by ART (ART-AGA), 31 SGA fetuses conceived
by ART (ART-SGA) and 28 SGA fetuses conceived
spontaneously (Spont-SGA).
Conception by ART was defined as that by fertility
treatments that involve surgically removing eggs from
a woman’s ovaries, combining them with sperm in a
laboratory and returning them to the woman’s body
in order to become pregnant, i.e. standard in-vitro
fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection14. SGA
was defined as birth weight below the 10th centile,
according to local reference curves15. A reference cohort
of fetuses conceived spontaneously with normal estimated
fetal weight and birth weight (> 10th centile) were
sampled randomly from pregnancies at our institution and
frequency-paired by gestational age at ultrasound scan
(± 1 week) with ART and SGA fetuses. One hundred and
sixty-two (69.5%) fetuses in this study were included in
previously published data9,16.
Our study protocol included standard fetoplacental
Doppler ultrasound and echocardiography at 28–32
weeks of gestation, performed by one of three experienced
operators in fetal echocardiography. Parental baseline
and ART characteristics were collected by interview and
review of medical records at the time of the prenatal
evaluation, including parental age, body mass index,
smoking status, ethnicity, nulliparity and socioeconomic
status. Family cardiovascular history was defined as the
presence of congenital heart disease, coronary disease,
hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia in men
< 55 years and women < 65 years. Low socioeconomic
status was defined as routine occupation, long-term
unemployment or never worked, for both the pregnant
woman and her partner.
Upon delivery, presence of pregnancy complications,
gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight,
birth-weight centile, Apgar score, umbilical artery pH and
perinatal morbidity were recorded. Major neonatal mor-
bidity was defined as the presence of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hem-
orrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy, per-
sistent ductus arteriosus or sepsis. Perinatal mortality was
defined as either intrauterine death or neonatal death
within the first 28 days of age. The study protocol
was approved by Hospital Clinic’s ethics committee and
written parental consent was obtained from all study
participants.
Fetal ultrasound
All pregnancies underwent complete two-dimensional
(2D) ultrasound examination at 28–32 weeks of ges-
tation using a Siemens Sonoline Antares (Siemens Med-
ical Systems, Malvern, PA, USA), with 6–4-MHz linear
curved-array and 2–10-MHz phased-array probes. Exam-
inations included fetoplacental Doppler evaluation and
fetal echocardiography. Fetoplacental Doppler evaluation
included measurement of pulsatility index (PI) of the uter-
ine arteries, umbilical artery, fetal middle cerebral artery,
ductus venosus and aortic isthmus, according to a previ-
ously published methodology17–20. The cerebroplacental
ratio was calculated by dividing the fetal middle cerebral
artery PI by the umbilical artery PI21.
Fetal
echocardiography
included
a
comprehensive
morphometric and functional assessment by 2D, M-mode,
conventional and tissue Doppler ultrasound.
Assessment of fetal cardiac morphometry included
measurement of cardiothoracic ratio, atrial area, ven-
tricular sphericity indices and relative wall thickness.
Cardiothoracic ratio was measured in the four-chamber
view and calculated as heart area divided by thoracic
area22. Left and right atrial areas were traced on 2D
images at the maximum point of atrial distension23.
Ventricular base-to-apex length and basal diameter were
measured on 2D images from an apical four-chamber

view at end diastole. Left and right ventricular spheric-
ity indices were calculated as base-to-apex length divided
by basal diameter. Septal and free-wall thicknesses and
ventricular dimensions were measured by M-mode in a
transverse four-chamber view at end diastole24,25. Calcu-
lation of relative wall thickness was performed for left
and right ventricular walls, with the formula (2 × wall
thickness)/(ventricular inner diameter at end diastole)26.
Fetal cardiac systolic function evaluation included
measurement
of
shortening
fraction,
ejection
frac-
tion, mitral/tricuspid annular-plane systolic excursion
(MAPSE/TAPSE) and systolic annular peak velocity (S�),
isovolumic contraction times and ejection times. Left
and right ejection fractions were obtained in a trans-
verse four-chamber view by M-mode using Teichholz’s
formula27. MAPSE and TAPSE were assessed by M-mode
in an apical or basal four-chamber view, by placing the
cursor at a right angle to the atrioventricular junction,
marked by the valve rings at the mitral or tricuspid valves;
maximum amplitude of motion was taken as the extent
of displacement between end systole and end diastole,
measured in mm28. Spectral tissue Doppler imaging was
used to record S� at mitral and tricuspid lateral annuli in
an apical or basal four-chamber view, and measured in
real time during the echocardiographic study29.
Fetal cardiac diastolic function was evaluated by
measurement of peak early (E) and late (A) transvalvular
filling velocity ratio (E/A ratio), deceleration time of E
velocity, duration time of A, early (E�) diastolic annular
peak velocities, E/E� ratio and left isovolumic relaxation
time (IRT)30. Atrioventricular flows were obtained in a
basal or apical four-chamber view, placing the pulsed
Doppler sample volume at the tip of atrioventricular
leaflets. Deceleration time of the E-wave was measured
from mitral and tricuspid inflow velocities in an apical
four-chamber view20. Spectral tissue Doppler imaging was
used to record E� at mitral and tricuspid lateral annuli in
an apical or basal four-chamber view29. Left IRT was
measured in a cross-section of the fetal thorax at the
four-chamber view, placing the Doppler sample volume
on the medial wall of the ascending aorta, including the
aortic and mitral valve; valvular clicks in the Doppler
wave were used as landmarks and IRT was measured
from the closure of the aortic valve to the opening of the
mitral valve31.
In order to compare individuals with different body size,
functional cardiac parameters were normalized adjusting
by cardiac area, cardiac longitudinal diameter, cardiac
transverse diameter or estimated fetal weight.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics v. 21 statis-
tical package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data
are presented as mean ± SD or n (%), as appropriate.
Comparisons among study groups and controls were
performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Cate-
gorical variables were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Linear
regression was performed in order to compare echocardio-
graphic parameters among groups adjusted by maternal
age, gestational age at scan and prenatal corticoid expo-
sure. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)
was performed in order to obtain mean differences
between groups adjusted by maternal age, gestational
age at scan and prenatal corticoid exposure.
RESULTS
Characteristics of study populations
A total of 233 fetuses were evaluated, including 102
controls, 72 ART-AGA fetuses, 31 ART-SGA fetuses
and
28
Spont-SGA
fetuses.
Baseline
and
perinatal
characteristics of these study populations are shown in
Table 1. Parental baseline characteristics were similar
among study groups, with the exception of higher
maternal age in both ART groups and higher paternal
age in ART and SGA groups, compared with controls.
As expected, SGA pregnancies had a lower birth weight
and higher prevalence of pre-eclampsia, prenatal corticoid
exposure, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit
and major neonatal morbidity than did AGA pregnancies.
Fetal ultrasound examination
Data on the fetal ultrasound examinations are shown
in Table 2. As expected, SGA cases presented worse
fetoplacental Doppler indices, with increased uterine
artery mean PI and lower cerebroplacental ratio. Ductus
venosus and aortic isthmus PI were similar among study
groups. Spont-SGA fetuses had larger hearts compared
with the other groups. ART fetuses showed larger atria
with preserved heart size. Both SGA and ART fetuses
showed more globular hearts and increased relative wall
thickness, which was more marked in Spont-SGA fetuses,
compared with controls (Figure 1). While ejection fraction
was preserved in all groups, decreased longitudinal motion
and increased IRT could be observed in both ART and
SGA groups compared with controls. Mitral and tricuspid
E-wave deceleration time was prolonged in SGA fetuses
and reduced in ART fetuses compared with controls. Most
cardiovascular changes in ART and SGA fetuses remained
significant after adjusting for maternal age, gestational age
at ultrasound scan and corticoid exposure.
MANCOVA
was
performed
to
assess
the
mean
differences between study groups and controls, adjusted
by maternal age, gestational age at ultrasound scan and
corticoid exposure (Figure 2 and Table S1). This analysis
identified increased cardiothoracic ratio, relative wall
thickness and mitral E deceleration time to be more
representative of a SGA fetus, and dilated right atria with
reduced E deceleration time to be more representative
of an ART fetus. All study groups showed decreased
longitudinal motion (TAPSE) in comparison to controls.

ventricles in ART fetuses.
DISCUSSION
This study provides evidence that both ART and SGA
have a direct and independent effect on the fetal
cardiovascular system that translates into different fetal
cardiac phenotypes.
Our findings confirm those of previous studies that
demonstrated fetal cardiovascular changes in SGA and
ART
fetuses
and
further
provide
evidence
of
the
independent effect of each factor. We described larger,
more globular and hypertrophic hearts in naturally
conceived SGA fetuses with reduced longitudinal motion
(decreased MAPSE, TAPSE and mitral S�) and impaired
relaxation (decreased E� and prolonged IRT and E
deceleration time). These data are in agreement with
previous studies that demonstrated significant changes in
cardiac structure and function in fetuses and children
born SGA3,4,16,32,33. Cardiac changes observed in SGA
fetuses can be explained as an adaptive response to

sustained undernutrition and hypoxia, together with
increased placental vascular resistance that results in
pressure/volume overload. It is probable that the heart
reacts to increased placental resistance and pressure
overload
by
shifting
into
a
more
spherical
shape
(with a lower radius of curvature that would better
tolerate pressure overload by reducing wall stress) and
hypertrophying myocardial walls (in order to increase the
force-generating units). Finally, volume overload would
explain cardiomegaly. While this concentric hypertrophy
maintains a normal ejection fraction, signs of reduced
longitudinal motion and impaired ventricular filling can
usually be observed in SGA.
We also describe dilated atria and more spherical
ventricles without cardiomegaly in normally grown
fetuses conceived by ART. Signs of decreased longitudinal
motion (reduced TAPSE, MAPSE and S�) and impaired
relaxation (decreased E deceleration time) were also
observed. These changes are in line with our previous
reports
on
ART
fetuses9,34
and
postnatal
studies
demonstrating increased vascular pressure in children
and adolescents conceived by ART11–13. This is also
consistent with the shortened E deceleration time (usually
secondary to increased ventricular end-diastolic pressures)
observed in ART, but not in SGA. The fetal heart
responds to pressure overload with concentric remodeling
by reducing the ventricular radius of curvature (more
spherical ventricles) together with a mild increase in
myocardial wall thickness, maintaining a normal heart
size. Observed dilated atria are probably a consequence
of a problem with ventricular early filling that needs to
be compensated by a larger atrial contribution; increased
pressure also results in dilated atria. These changes were
more prominent in the right heart, probably due to its
predominance in fetal life and its higher susceptibility to
pressure overload compared with the left ventricle. It is
also consistent with previous reports suggesting increased
pulmonary pressures in children conceived by ART13.

left ventricular (LV) wall thickness; (d) tricuspid annular-plane systolic excursion (TAPSE); and (e) mitral E deceleration time. The following
groups are shown:
, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetuses conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) (ART-AGA);
, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses conceived by ART (ART-SGA);
, SGA fetuses conceived spontaneously (Spont-SGA). Baseline at
0 represents fetuses conceived spontaneously (controls) and each bar quantifies mean difference for each group with regard to controls,
adjusted for maternal age, gestational age at ultrasound scan and prenatal corticoid exposure.
Parental
predisposing
factors,
epigenetic
changes
secondary to early embryo manipulation, hormonal
effects and association with perinatal complications have
been postulated as factors potentially mediating increased
vascular pressures described in ART offspring. However,
the exact mechanisms driving fetal cardiovascular remod-
eling in ART pregnancies remain to be elucidated. While
pressure overload seems to be a common feature in ART
and SGA, the absence of fetal hypoxia/undernutrition and
volume overload in ART could explain the different phe-
notypic response of the fetal heart in comparison with
SGA. Finally, fetuses conceived by ART that developed
growth restriction showed mixed characteristics from
both groups, maintaining dilated atria observed in ART
fetuses, but also left myocardial dysfunction present in
SGA fetuses; the ART-SGA group is more similar to
the normally grown ART group, suggesting that changes
mediated in ART are more strongly manifested in these
cases and could partially counteract the changes induced
from SGA.
Epidemiological studies have provided evidence of an
association of SGA with cardiovascular risk later in life,
demonstrating a higher incidence of hypertension and
cardiovascular mortality in this population6,35. Likewise,

 ART and SGA and fetal cardiac remodeling
69
ART has been associated with postnatal hypertension,
premature subclinical atherosclerosis in the systemic
circulation and pulmonary vascular dysfunction11–13.
The findings of the present study, suggesting distinct
patterns
of
fetal
cardiac
remodeling,
support
the
hypothesis of ART and SGA being independent causes
of cardiac programming. Fetal echocardiography has
already demonstrated its utility in the prediction of
postnatal cardiovascular health in SGA16. Therefore, the
identification of different cardiac phenotypes in SGA and
ART pregnancies may help in the diagnosis and long-term
cardiovascular prognosis of these fetuses and children.
The importance of early identification and the impact
of interventions in pediatric populations for preventing
future cardiovascular disease are now well recognized35.
Given the high prevalence of both SGA (7–10%) and
ART (2–20%) pregnancies, early interventions in these
high-risk populations could have a tremendous effect
on public health by potentially improving the future
cardiovascular health of these children.
This study has various strengths and limitations. To
our knowledge, this is the first study illustrating fetal
cardiovascular changes in separate populations of ART
and naturally conceived SGA fetuses. Comprehensive
fetal
echocardiography
was
performed
prospectively
in a large proportion of well-characterized fetuses.
Cases were frequency-matched by gestational age with
controls, and we further adjusted for other potential
confounders, such as maternal age and prenatal corticoid
exposure. However, we acknowledge that there may
be other non-obvious confounders like pre-eclampsia
and
birth
weight,
so
despite
the
relatively
small
number per group, we decided to adjust for these.
Due to the lack of standardization and normality
values for most fetal cardiac morphometric parameters,
we displayed crude values and results normalized by
cardiac
size
(Table S1).
Most
geometric
differences
remained statistically significant after normalization,
while some functional parameters lost their significance.
We acknowledge that the optimal scenario would be to
establish a consensus on how to normalize these fetal
echocardiographic parameters. Therefore, the differential
effect of growth restriction and ART on fetal cardiac
functional parameters and some of the geometric changes
could be overinterpreted. The difficulty of assessing
prospectively fetal echocardiography in ART pregnancies
that developed growth restriction limited the sample size
of our study and may have prevented some statistical
differences among groups. Our findings warrant postnatal
long-term follow-up to describe the prognosis and clinical
significance of the described changes.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that there
is a different and independent cardiac effect in SGA and
ART fetuses. Each group showed a particular cardiac
phenotype, with ART-SGA cases showing a mixture of
characteristics from both groups. Although the underlying
mechanisms for these changes remain to be elucidated, the
existence of different cardiac remodeling in these fetuses
suggests the need for long-term cardiovascular follow-up
of both SGA and ART fetuses and opens a window of
opportunity to improve cardiovascular health in these
children.
