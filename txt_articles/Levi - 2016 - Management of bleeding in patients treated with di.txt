Management of bleeding in patients
treated with direct oral anticoagulants
Marcel Levi1,2
Abstract
Background: Recently, a new generation of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with a greater specificity
towards activated coagulation factors was introduced based on encouraging results for efficacy and safety in
clinical studies. An initial limitation of these new drugs was the absence of an adequate strategy to reverse the
effect if a bleeding event occurs or an urgent invasive procedure has to be carried out.
Main text: Specific reversing agents for DOACs have become available, however, and are now evaluated in clinical
studies. For the anti-factor Xa agents (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) a number of studies have shown that
the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate resulted in a correction of the prolonged prothrombin
time and restored depressed thrombin generation after rivaroxaban treatment in a controlled trial in healthy human
subjects. In view of the relatively wide availability of prothrombin complex concentrates, this would be an interesting
option if the results can be confirmed in patients on oral factor Xa inhibitors who present with bleeding complications.
More specific reversal can be achieved with andexanet, a new agent currently in development that competitively binds
to the anti-factor Xa agents. For the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, the administration of prothrombin complex
concentrates showed variable results in various volunteer trials and efficacy at relatively high doses in animal studies.
Recently, a Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody (idarucizumab) was shown to be an effective reversal agent for
dabigatran in human studies.
Conclusion: For the new generation of DOACs, several reversal strategies and specific antidotes are under evaluation,
although most interventions need further evaluation in clinical trials.

Background
Anticoagulants are frequently prescribed agents for the
prevention and treatment of a myriad of cardiovascular
conditions. Conventional anticoagulant agents, such as
vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; warfarin, phenprocoumon,
or coumadin) and heparin or low molecular weight
(LMW) heparin, are increasingly replaced by direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) directly inhibiting factor Xa
(e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) or factor IIa
(e.g., dabigatran). This new generation of anticoagulants
is termed novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or DOACs.
A large number of clinical studies have shown that these
agents can prevent or treat acute or chronic thrombo-
embolic diseases [1].
The most important complication of treatment with
anticoagulant agents is hemorrhage, which may be serious,
may cause long-term debilitating disease, or may even be
life-threatening [2]. Bleeding in a patient on anticoagulants
may require specific (additional) management; if the
bleeding situation is sufficiently severe, swift reversal of
the anticoagulant effect of the anticoagulant agent may
even be required. Depending on the clinical situation,
including the site and/or the severity of the bleeding, this
reversal may take place in a few hours, but in some
cases immediate reversal is needed [3]. Generally, each
(immediate) reversal of anticoagulant treatment needs
also to take into consideration the indication for the
antithrombotic agents. For example, the immediate
interruption of anticoagulants in a patient with recent
venous thromboembolism will markedly increase the

 short-term risk of recurrent venous thrombosis or pul-
monary embolism. Likewise, in a patient with advanced
heart disease and atrial fibrillation, interruption of anti-
coagulants may increase the risk of cerebral or systemic
embolism. Each of these specific clinical settings re-
quires a careful and balanced individual assessment of
the benefits and dangers of reversing anticoagulants
(and potential strategies to keep the period of reversal
as brief as possible). Here we will briefly describe the
epidemiology of bleeding complications due to antico-
agulants and various strategies to reverse the anticoagu-
lant effect of antithrombotic agents, focusing on the
new generation of anticoagulants (DOACs).
Relevance, incidence, and risk factors for bleeding in
patients on anticoagulant treatment
The relevance of hemorrhagic complications in patients
on anticoagulants is clearly demonstrated in a series of
observational studies. In a large study of 34,146 patients
with acute ischemic coronary syndromes, anticoagulant-
associated bleeding was associated with a 5-fold increased
risk of death during the first month and a 1.5-fold higher
mortality between 30 days and 6 months [4]. Major
hemorrhage was an independent predictor of mortality
across all subgroups that were analyzed.
Currently, VKAs are still the most frequently used oral
anticoagulant agents for long-term prevention and treat-
ment of a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. In well-
controlled patients in clinical trials, treatment with VKAs
increases the risk of major bleeding by 0.5–1.0 %/year and
increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage by about
0.2–0.3 %/year [5]. However, in three real-life surveys this
incidence varied from 1.4 to 3.4 %/year [6]. One needs to
realize that the relatively uncomplicated trial populations
may poorly reflect the real-life setting in which anticoagu-
lants are prescribed. For example, in six pivotal trials that
demonstrated the superiority of warfarin over placebo
in the prevention of thromboembolic complications in
patients with atrial fibrillation, 28,787 patients were
screened but only 12.6 % of these patients were in-
cluded in the studies [7].
The incidence of hemorrhagic complications with use
of the new generation of oral anticoagulants with direct
inhibitory properties towards thrombin or factor Xa is
not very different. The severity and incidence of bleeding
events in DOAC-treated patients has been evaluated in a
number of clinical studies, which demonstrated similar
or lower rates of major bleeding with DOACs compared
with traditional anticoagulants [8–11]. The safety and
efficacy of DOACs versus warfarin were evaluated in a
meta-analysis of 14 prospective and retrospective stud-
ies in AF patients undergoing catheter ablation (4782
patients in total) [12]. Overall, no significant difference
was observed in terms of thromboembolic events or
major bleeding events between the warfarin and dabiga-
tran treatment arms, although minor bleeding events
occurred significantly less frequently with dabigatran
compared with warfarin. Of note, DOAC treatment was
associated with a reduced intracranial hemorrhage inci-
dence compared with warfarin therapy, whereas some
analyses showed an increased risk for gastrointestinal
bleeds [12–14]. The recent guidelines from the European
Society of Cardiology on anticoagulant management of
atrial fibrillation recommend non-VKAs based on their
more favorable incidence of hemorrhagic complications
[15]. Likewise, DOACs are also advocated for the treat-
ment of venous thromboembolism in recent guidelines
[16]. Although these clinical study results are encouraging,
there is very limited real-world evidence with regards to
the incidence and severity of DOAC-related bleeding
events; most of the currently available data are based on
postmarketing studies.
Some clinical studies have reported on their experience
with bleeding complications in patients treated with
DOACs compared with patients on warfarin [17, 18].
Data from the EINSTEIN studies on rivaroxaban demon-
strated that patients who presented with major bleeding
on rivaroxaban had a relatively milder presentation and a
better recovery compared with patients on warfarin. A
prospective chart review of 15 emergency department
patients treated with dabigatran and 123 patients treated
with warfarin showed that patients on dabigatran had a
shorter length of stay, fewer major bleeding events, and
fewer life-threatening complications compared with pa-
tients on warfarin. Additionally, dabigatran use was more
commonly associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage,
and less frequently associated with intracranial bleeding,
compared with warfarin, in this patient population.
This finding is in contrast to results from an analysis of
insurance claim and administrative data from the FDA
Mini-Sentinel database, which showed that dabigatran
was associated with reduced incidence of gastrointes-
tinal bleeds compared with warfarin [19]. The Australian
Therapeutic Goods Administration has been monitoring
the safety profile of dabigatran, and reported 361 serious
bleeding events with this agent between 2011 and 2013
[20]. The most commonly reported bleeding site was
the gastrointestinal tract, while a smaller proportion of
intracranial bleeds were reported for dabigatran versus
warfarin [20].
The most important risk factor for hemorrhage in
users of anticoagulants is the intensity of the anticoagu-
lant dose [21]. Studies suggest that with a target inter-
national normalized ratio (INR) of >3.0 the incidence of
major bleeding is twice as large as in studies with a
target INR of 2.0–3.0 [22]. In a meta-analysis of studies
in patients with prosthetic heart valves, a lower INR
target range resulted in a lower frequency of major

 bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage with a similar
antithrombotic efficacy [23]. For dabigatran a clear rela-
tionship between dose and incidence of bleeding compli-
cations has been demonstrated in a clinical study in
patients with atrial fibrillation [8], and all other DOACs
have also demonstrated a similar dose-adverse event
relationship [14].
Patient characteristics constitute another important
determinant of the bleeding risk. Older patients have a 2-
fold increased risk of bleeding [24], and the relative risk of
intracranial hemorrhage (in particular at higher intensities
of anticoagulation) was 2.5 (95 % CI 2.3–9.4) in patients
aged >85 years compared with patients 70–74 years old
[25]. Comorbidity may also significantly increase the risk
of bleeding. A case–control study in 1986 patients on an-
ticoagulants showed that comorbidity (such as mild renal
insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, or diabetes) increased
the risk of bleeding by about 2.5 [7]. Another very import-
ant determinant of the risk of bleeding is the combined
use of medication that affects both the coagulation system
and platelet function. Two meta-analyses, comprising six
trials with a total of 3874 patients and 10 trials with a total
of 5938 patients, found a relative risk of major bleeding
when antithrombotic agents were combined with aspirin
of 2.4 (95 % CI 1.2–4.8) and 2.5 (95 % CI 1.7–3.7), res-
pectively [26]. A population-based case–control study
confirmed the high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
in patients using anticoagulants in combination with as-
pirin and/or clopidogrel [27]. It should be noted that the
combined use of the new anticoagulant agents and an-
tiplatelet agents was discouraged in the clinical trials,
whereas this is increasingly common in clinical prac-
tice and may also have a serious impact on the risk of
hemorrhage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
(NSAIDs) are also associated with an enhanced risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding. The combined use of antico-
agulants and NSAIDs may result in an 11-fold higher
risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding as
compared with the general population [28]. This risk is
not significantly lower when using selective inhibitors
of COX-2. As DOACs are associated with a higher risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with conventional
anticoagulants (see above), the effect of combined treat-
ment with these agents and aspirin or NSAIDs may be
even larger.
Reversal of DOACs
One of the main advantages of DOACs are the relatively
stable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic proper-
ties, which obviates the need for repeated control of the
intensity of anticoagulation and dose adjustments. This
means that for some clinical situations these drugs may
represent an important improvement, but as already indi-
cated the risk of (major) bleeding is still present. Clinical
trials in patients using DOACs agents excluded many pa-
tients with common comorbidities and discouraged the
simultaneous use of agents affecting platelet function. The
risk of hemorrhage in these trials may therefore represent
an underestimation of real-life bleeding risk.
Dependent on the severity of the clinical situation and
in view of the relatively short half-life of the direct factor
Xa inhibitors (5–15 h), cessation of medication may
often be sufficient to reverse the anticoagulant effect in
case of bleeding. Some authors argue that in most cases
this will suffice and more immediate reversal is hardly
ever really needed in clinical practice [29]. However, if
immediate reversal of anticoagulation is deemed neces-
sary, additional measures may be required. In general,
these can be divided into nonspecific and specific inter-
ventions to reverse the anticoagulant effect (Table 1). A
practical approach to the patient presenting with bleeding
while using DOACs, based on recommendations of the
European Heart Rhythm Association [15], is presented
in Table 2.
Nonspecific measures include (activated) prothrombin
complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa
(rFVIIa). The prothrombotic potential of activated PCCs
and rFVIIa might be higher than that of nonactivated
PCCs, so nonactivated PCCs may be preferred [30, 31]. In
addition, a recent retrospective series of bleeding patients
treated with PCCs for anticoagulant reversal showed a
20 % risk of thromboembolic complications, although
part of the risk may have been due to the underlying
thromboembolic risk for which the anticoagulant was
prescribed in the first place and the clinical situation of
the patients [32].
Specific measures are directly targeting the anticoagu-
lant agent, by means of (Fab fragments of) monoclonal
antibodies (in the case of dabigatran) or molecules that
competitively bind to the anticoagulant agents (in the case
of factor Xa inhibitors).

 Reversal of direct oral factor Xa inhibitors
Preclinical data suggest that rFVIIa and PCCs (activated
and nonactivated) may be useful for the reversal of
NOAC-induced anticoagulation. Experimental studies
have demonstrated that the amelioration of coagulation
parameters is associated with a beneficial effect on blood
loss [33, 34]. In addition, a number of studies in human
healthy subjects have revealed that the administration of
PCC resulted in a correction of the prolonged prothrom-
bin time and restored depressed thrombin generation after
rivaroxaban treatment in a controlled trial in healthy
human subjects. Similarly, a three-factor PCC (Profilnine®;
Grifols Biologicals Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA) was also
evaluated for rivaroxaban reversal in a study in healthy
volunteers and was shown capable of correcting some of
the rivaroxaban-induced effects on coagulation parame-
ters [35–37]. Recent studies confirmed these findings also
at lower doses of PCCs [38, 39].
More specific reversal of anti-factor Xa agents can be
achieved with new agents that competitively bind to the
anti-factor Xa agents. Ciraparantag binds directly to the
factor Xa agent (in particular edoxaban) via hydrogen
bonds from or to various parts of the molecule [40, 41].
This antidote was shown to block the anticoagulant effect
of edoxaban and restored the prothrombin time in vitro.
Further development is ongoing. Similarly, andexanet-alfa
is a recombinant protein analog of factor Xa that binds to
factor Xa inhibitors but does not trigger prothrombotic
activity. Andexanet virtually immediately reversed the
anticoagulant activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban in
healthy subjects without evidence of clinical toxic ef-
fects [42]. A clinical study in patients who present with
bleeding while taking anti-factor Xa DOACs is ongoing.
Monitoring the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of
factor Xa inhibitors is most simply done by measuring
the prothrombin time, although there is some variability
between prothrombin time reagents and for some agents
the anti-factor Xa assay is more reliable [43]. Of note,
the INR is not a suitable test to quantitate the (residual)
anticoagulant effect by factor Xa agents.
Reversal of direct oral thrombin inhibitors
The other group of DOACs directly targets thrombin
(factor IIa) and is represented by dabigatran. Preclinical
studies show variable effects for the efficacy of (activated)
PCCs and factor VIIa to reverse the anticoagulant effect
and to ameliorate experimental bleeding in animals ex-
posed to dabigatran [33, 44, 45] Relatively high doses of
PCCs, however, seem to have a reversing effect. Similarly,
human volunteer studies show a limited effect of conven-
tional doses of PCC to normalize coagulation parameters
after ingestion of dabigatran [35, 37]. There are no system-
atic clinical trials investigating the effect of PCCs to reverse
dabigatran-associated
hemorrhage
in
clinical
practice.
However, some case series are helpful. The effectiveness
of dabigatran-related bleeding management using a non-
activated four-factor (4F)-PCC (Octaplex®; Octapharma,
Vienna, Austria) was recently evaluated by Diaz et al. [46].
Five patients receiving dabigatran, 76–88 years of age,
were administered 4 F-PCC to manage dabigatran-related
GI bleeding complications. Treatment with 4 F-PCC was
able to adequately control bleeding in four of five patients;
the fifth patient died of septic shock and coagulopathy
secondary to severe hemorrhage. No thromboembolic
events were reported in the next 6 months of follow-up in
these patients. Interestingly, the authors also reported
that, in the one patient presenting with a prolonged
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as a re-
sult of dabigatran treatment, administration of 4 F-PCC
was able to partially normalize this laboratory param-
eter. Similar clinical case reports have been reviewed
elsewhere [47].
A direct reversing agent for dabigatran has been de-
veloped recently and is based on a Fab fragment of a
monoclonal antibody (idaricuzimab) directly binding to
dabigatran and eliminating its anticoagulant effect [48].
Experimental studies show a rapid and almost immediate
reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation [49, 50]. In
healthy human subjects that were exposed to dabigatran,
this antidote also showed a complete elimination of the
anticoagulant effect of dabigatran [51]. In a clinical trial in
90 patients on dabigatran who had serious bleeding
or required an urgent invasive procedure, idarucizumab

 completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran
almost instantaneously [52].
Monitoring of the anticoagulant effect of thrombin in-
hibitors in routine clinical practice is difficult. The aPTT
is not very useful. An ecarin clotting time may be more
accurate but is not readily available in most routine clinical
settings. Most convenient and practically applicable for
monitoring of the anticoagulant effect may be the diluted
thrombin time, which needs to be standardized for the
specific agent that was used [53].
Conclusion
For the new generation of DOACs, several reversal
strategies are under evaluation and specific antidotes or
reversing agents are being developed, although most
interventions need further evaluation in clinical trials.
Such strategies can be used in case of serious hemorrhage
complicating the use of DOACs or if a patient on DOACs
needs to undergo an immediate invasive procedure.
