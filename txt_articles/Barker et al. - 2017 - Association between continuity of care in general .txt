Association between continuity of care in general practice and 
hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions: 
cross sectional study of routinely collected, person level data
Isaac Barker, Adam Steventon, Sarah R Deeny 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess whether continuity of care with a general 
practitioner is associated with hospital admissions for 
ambulatory care sensitive conditions for older 
patients.
Design
Cross sectional study.
setting
Linked primary and secondary care records from 200 
general practices participating in the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink in England.
PartiCiPants
230 472 patients aged between 62 and 82 years and 
who experienced at least two contacts with a general 
practitioner between April 2011 and March 2013.
Main OutCOMe Measure
Number of hospital admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions (those considered manageable in 
primary care) per patient between April 2011 and March 
2013.
results
We assessed continuity of care using the usual 
provider of care index, which we defined as the 
proportion of contacts occurring between April 2011 
and March 2013 that were with the most frequently 
seen general practitioner. On average, the usual 
provider of care index score was 0.61. Continuity of 
care was lower among practices with more doctors 
(average score 0.59 in large practices versus 0.70 in 
small practices). Higher continuity of care was 
associated with fewer admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions. When modelled, controlling for 
demographic and clinical patient characteristics, an 
increase in the usual provider of care index of 0.2 for 
all patients would reduce these admissions by 6.22% 
(95% confidence interval 4.87% to 7.55%). There was 
greater evidence for an association among patients 
who were heavy users of primary care. Heavy users 
also experienced more admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions than other patients (0.36 
admissions per patient for those with ≥18 contacts 
with a general practitioner, compared with 0.04 
admissions per patient for those with 2-4 contacts).
COnClusiOns
Strategies that improve the continuity of care in 
general practice may reduce secondary care costs, 
particularly for the heaviest users of healthcare. 
Promoting continuity might also improve the 
experience of patients and those working in general 
practice.
Introduction
Healthcare systems around the world are facing 
increases in unplanned hospital admissions.1  These 
admissions are often undesirable for patients, disrup-
tive of elective care, and costly, so their prevention has 
become a priority. A large proportion of hospital admis-
sions could be avoided through effective management 
and treatment in the community,2  which has become a 
focus of initiatives such as the accountable care organi-
sations in the United States and the “five year forward 
view” strategy in the National Health Service in 
England.3 4  The focus has often been on improving 
access to primary care (for example, by increasing 
opening hours or introducing remote care).5-7  These ini-
tiatives have achieved mixed impacts on patient out-
comes,8  and some may have had unintended effects on 
the continuity of the care provided.9

Although timely access is an important goal for high 
quality healthcare,11  continuity of care is associated 
with patient satisfaction,12 
13  as well as quality of life for 
patients living with long term conditions.14  It encom-
passes several aspects, including the consistency of 
care with a healthcare professional over time, quality of 
the interpersonal relationships between healthcare 
professionals and patients, and availability of informa-
tion about the patient.12  General practitioners value 
continuity of care, often considering it to be a core 
value of their profession,15 
16  while many patients value 
a personal doctor to coordinate and integrate their 
care.12 17  Unfortunately, there are indications from 
patient surveys that continuity of care is in decline in 
both the United States and England,18 
19  at a time when 
doctors are reporting concerns about their ability to 
provide coordinated care for the increasing number of

patients with long term conditions.6  Part of the back-
ground is a trend towards larger general practices, 
where larger clinical and support teams manage a big-
ger patient list.20  Although larger practices are associ-
ated with improved quality in some respects, such as 
following good practice in chronic disease management 
and offering longer consultation times,21 22  patients in 
larger practices report lower satisfaction with several 
aspects of care, including continuity.23
Although concerns have been raised about continu-
ity,9  it is unclear how much effort and resource should 
be spent in tackling these compared with other 
improvement priorities such as access. Part of the prob-
lem is that few studies have examined whether continu-
ity of care is associated with unplanned admissions, 
and the existing studies have major limitations. None 
have examined the relative benefit of continuity of care 
to different patient groups, including those with differ-
ing patterns of primary care utilisation.24  In one case, 
this is because survey data were aggregated to the gen-
eral practice level,24  with the additional limitations and 
bias associated with practice level analysis.24 25  Other 
studies have examined all cause unplanned admissions 
rather than the specific conditions most likely to be pre-
ventable by good quality primary care.10 26-28  In the 
absence of robust evidence, the link between continuity 
and admissions can only be conjectured. One theory is 
that continuity might improve the management of long 
term conditions by increasing the ability of doctors to 
respond to patients’ needs and preferences and there-
fore their ability to recommend suitable and acceptable 
courses of treatment. Continuity might also enable ear-
lier detection and treatment of acute events,29  or 
improve the relationship between the general practi-
tioner and patient and thus increase the uptake of pre-
ventive interventions such as vaccination or routine 
drug review,30  although this relationship is necessarily 
complex. Since some of these mechanisms might 
increase rather than reduce secondary care utilisa-
tion,31 more robust evidence is needed regarding the 
association between continuity of care in general prac-
tice and hospital admissions.
In this study, we use person level data to assess the 
relationship between continuity of care and hospital 
admissions, and examine how the association differs 
between high and low users of primary care. We address 
hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive con-
ditions, which are (at least in theory) manageable in 
primary care.32 
33  Ambulatory care sensitive conditions 
include long term conditions, such as asthma, where 
good quality care should prevent episodes of flare-ups; 
acute conditions, such as gangrene, where timely and 
effective care stops the condition developing; and con-
ditions that are preventable by vaccination, such as 
influenza and pneumonia. Unplanned admissions for 
these conditions accounted for £1.42bn ($1.74bn; €1.67) 
of spending in England in 2009/10.34  We focused our 
study on older patients (aged 62-82 years), who particu-
larly value continuity of care and experience more 
admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions 
than the general population.34  One of the benefits of 
our study is that, as with some previous research,10 
31-38 
we have used person level data from the electronic med-
ical record in primary care to measure continuity of 
care. These data are increasingly available for use in 
quality improvement and can be assembled in a timely 
fashion at minimal cost. Thus measurement strategies 
based on these data have widespread applicability. If 
these indices show a link with patient outcomes that 
can be improved through intervention in primary care, 
then they could support quality improvement activities.
Methods
Dataset
This was a retrospective, observational, and cross sec-
tional study using data from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink, which contains the electronic med-
ical records of participating general practices, and 
includes contacts with healthcare professionals, details 
of diagnostic tests, referrals to specialist healthcare, 
diagnosed health conditions, personal characteristics, 
and the start and end dates of patient registrations with 
general practices.39  Patients in the practices participat-
ing in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink are 
broadly representative of patients registered to prac-
tices in England.40
The dataset was pseudonymised (all patient identifi-
able data had been removed) but linked at the person 
level to the hospital episode statistics, a national data-
base containing administrative records from all hospitals 
in England that provide NHS care. From that database we 
obtained dates of inpatient admission and details of the 
diagnoses recorded during the inpatient stay (based on 
international classification of diseases, 10th revision, or 
ICD-10, codes). We also obtained and linked data on 
deaths occurring inside or outside of hospital from the 
Office for National Statistics, and socioeconomic depri-
vation scores for the small area of individual patient res-
idence (index of multiple deprivation 2010).
inclusion and exclusion criteria
We studied patients registered at general practices that 
participated in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
and that supplied data that met a minimum standard of 
quality. We included patients who were aged between 
62 and 82 on 1 April 2011 and experienced at least two 
contacts with a general practitioner between April 2011 
and March 2013—the period analysed in the study. To 
allow for a minimum of two years’ follow-up for every 
patient, we excluded those who died before March 2013. 
We also required that patients were registered with a 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink practice for at least 
one year before April 2011, so that we could derive the 
study covariates. Finally, we excluded a small number 
of patients whose age, index of multiple deprivation 
score, or sex was not recorded.
admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions
Our outcome was the number of inpatient admissions 
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions for each 
patient between April 2011 and March 2013. Although

admissions exist,32  after a review of the literature we 
chose a core set of 22 such conditions, which we 
adapted from Bardsley et al32 (see supplementary 
appendix 1). Using the recorded ICD-10 codes we identi-
fied the corresponding admissions from the hospital 
episode statistics data. For some conditions (eg, 
asthma) we limited our search to the primary diagnosis 
field, whereas for others (eg, gangrene) we included all 
fields (see supplementary appendix 1).
Continuity of care
Continuity of care is a complex, multifaceted concept 
reflecting at least four domains12: the subjective experi-
ence of a caring relationship (interpersonal continuity), 
a history of interacting with the same healthcare profes-
sional across a series of discrete episodes (longitudinal 
continuity), the availability of clinical and psychosocial 
information across encounters and professionals (infor-
mational continuity), and the effective collaboration of 
teams across care boundaries to provide seamless care 
(management continuity). In this study, we dealt with 
longitudinal continuity of care, which we measured 
using the usual provider of care index. Usual provider of 
care is defined as the proportion of a patient’s contacts 
that was with their most regularly seen doctor. For exam-
ple, if a patient had 10 general practitioner contacts, 
including six with the same doctor, then their usual pro-
vider of care index score would be 0.6. We measured the 
usual provider of care index score for April 2011 to March 
2013, the same period used for hospital admissions.
study covariates
For each patient we determined age, sex; socioeco-
nomic deprivation score grouped into fifths (based on 
national thresholds, with the first fifth representing the 
least deprived),41 number of contacts with a general 
practitioner (April 2011 to March 2013), number of active 
previous long term health conditions (recorded before 
April 2011), and number of previous referrals to special-
ist care (in 2010/11).
We identified contacts with general practitioners 
from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink data by 
selecting records corresponding to specific types of 
encounter (eg, clinic, home visit, telephone) and which 
were entered by general practitioners (including part-
ners, registrars, sole practitioners, and locum doctors). 
All contacts were linked to a specific practitioner. Con-
tacts with a general practitioner were limited to one 
each day, owing to concerns about duplication. We also 
limited the number of referrals to specialist care in the 
preceding year to one each day, to avoid duplication 
arising from counting two Read codes being entered for 
the same referral.
We identified long term conditions that were recorded 
in the general practice data between 2001 and 2011 and 
had not been recorded as resolved. We did not rely on 
the hospital episode statistics data to assess the long 
term conditions of individual patients, since in such 
data, conditions are more likely to be recorded for 
patients who are admitted frequently. The long term 
conditions included are the 17 measured as part of the 
Quality Outcomes Framework for general practice in 
England (see table 1).42
statistical analysis
We used multivariable generalised linear regression to 
test the association between the number of admissions 
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions and the usual 
provider of care index score, controlling for the covari-
ates. We selected the distribution for our regression 
model based on an assessment of Pearson residuals. 
Since over-dispersion was present (and also the vari-
ance of the number of admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions was greater than the mean), we pre-
ferred a negative binomial model (with a log-link) to a 
Poisson model.43  We selected covariates using the 
Akaike Information Criterion; this supported including 
all of our chosen covariates.44  We expected that two 
patients in the same practice were likely to have more 
similar rates of admission than two patients in randomly 
different practices. Therefore, our model included prac-
tice level random effects, but we carried out likelihood 
ratio tests to determine whether the practice level varia-
tion was statistically significant from zero.45 
46
We interpreted our model by exponentiating the coeffi-
cients to estimate incidence rate ratios for an incremental 
change in the usual provider of care index score. These 
incidence rate ratios were then scaled to correspond to an 
increase in the usual provider of care index score of 0.2—
around 1 standard deviation—and interpreted as the per-
centage change in hospital admissions for ambulatory 
care sensitive conditions. Thus, the incidence rate ratio 
shows our estimate of the relative change in the number of 
admissions to result from an increase in the usual provider 
of care index score of 0.2, which might occur from any 
baseline level (for example, from 0.3 to 0.5 or from 0.6 to 
0.8), and when holding the covariates constant. Since this 
model assumed a linear relation between the usual pro-
vider of care index score and admissions, we also fitted a 
more flexible model that classified patients as receiving 
low, medium, and high levels of continuity, rather than 
treating the usual provider of care index score as a contin-
uous variable. We defined low continuity a priori as a 
usual provider of care index score between 0 and 0.4, 
medium between 0.4 and 0.7
, and high between 0.7 and 1.
subgroup analysis
We conducted subgroup analysis for higher and lower 
users of general practice care, in each case examining 
the association between the number of admissions for 
ambulatory care sensitive conditions and the usual pro-
vider of care index score. This was based on dividing the 
study population into five subgroups of approximately 
the same size, based on the number of contacts with a 
general practitioner that each patient experienced over 
two years. Within each of these subgroups, we estimated 
the association between the usual provider of care index 
score and the number of admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions using equivalent models to those 
we have described. In a similar manner, we examined 
whether the relationship between continuity of care and 
admissions differed by age group.

sensitivity analysis
Several metrics have been used to measure continuity 
of care at a patient level.47  To ensure our findings were 
not sensitive to our choice of metric, we additionally 
performed analysis using the Bice-Boxerman continu-
ity of care index.48  Compared with the usual provider of 
care index, which focuses on the concentration of con-
tacts with a particular general practitioner, the 
Bice-Boxerman continuity of care index takes into 
account the dispersion and distribution of contacts a 
patient has over different general practitioners.49 We 
re-ran the model predicting admissions to hospital for 
ambulatory care sensitive conditions including the 
Bice-Boxerman continuity of care index as an exposure 
instead of the usual provider of care index. Since the 
Bice-Boxerman continuity of care index score requires 
a minimum of three contacts, our analysis was 
restricted to that subgroup of patients. The Bice-Boxer-
man continuity of care index score, as with the usual 
provider of care index score, is bounded between 0 and 
1. We also calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient 
for the two indices, for those patients with three or more 
contacts.
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in setting the research question 
or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in devel-
oping plans for design or implementation of the study. We 
received valuable feedback on the interpretation and pre-
sentation of our results from a patient perspective as part 
of the review process of The BMJ. As our data are effec-
tively anonymised, we cannot disseminate the results of 
the research to participants directly, although the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink keeps a bibliography of studies 
published using their data. We plan to disseminate the 
results to relevant patient communities through alterna-
tive mediums, such as blogs and press releases, and by 
working with national organisations.
Results
Overall, 263 829 patients from 200 general practices met 
our inclusion and exclusion criteria, of whom 230 472 had 
at least two contacts with general practitioners between 
April 2011 and March 2013 (again, from 200 practices). On 
average over the two years, each of these patients experi-
enced 11.40 (SD 9.40) contacts with a general practitioner 
(table 1 ). The mean usual provider of care index score was 
0.61 (SD 0.23); figure 1 shows the distribution.
The low continuity of care group comprised 52 550 
patients (22.8%), the medium group 96 902 patients 
(42.1%), and the high group 81 020 patients (35.2%). 
These groups were similar in terms of their age, sex, and 
socioeconomic deprivation score (table 1). However, 
patients in the low continuity group had more contacts 
with general practitioners on average than the other 
groups (13.11 per person, compared with 11.34 per per-
son in the medium group and 10.37 in the high group).
Continuity of care as measured by the usual provider 
of care index tended to be lower in larger practices. In 
practices with between one and three fulltime equiva-
lent general practitioners, 49.7% of patients (n=11 883) 
experienced high continuity of care according to this 
metric, compared with 30.7% of patients (n=34 023) in 
practices with seven or more fulltime equivalent

general practitioners (table 2 ). As a result, patients with 
low continuity of care were registered at larger practices 
than other patients: the average practice list size for 
patients experiencing low continuity of care was 11 644, 
compared with 10 475 for patients with high continuity 
of care (table 1).
On average, each patient experienced 0.16 (SD 1.01) 
admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions 
over the two years, with 89.57% of patients having no 
such admission (table 1 ). After adjusting for the covari-
ates and the usual provider of care index score, results 
from likelihood ratio tests showed that there remained 
statistically significant variation between practices in 
the number of admissions for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions. Patients who were older, had more referrals 
to specialist care, more long term conditions, or more 
contacts with general practitioners experienced more 
admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions 
than other patients (table 3). Female sex was associated 
with having fewer of these admissions, whereas being 
in the most socioeconomically deprived fifth was asso-
ciated with having more such admissions.
When adjusting for these covariates, patients with 
higher continuity of care tended to have fewer admis-
sions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Com-
pared with people with low continuity of care, people 
with medium continuity of care had fewer admissions 
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (8.96%, 95% 
confidence interval 5.63% to 14.22%). People with high 
continuity of care had 12.49% (9.45% to 19.29%, table 4 ) 
fewer admissions than those with low continuity of 
care. Overall, across all patients with at least two con-
tacts with a general practitioner, a 0.2 increase in the 
usual provider of care index score was associated with 
a reduction in admissions for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions of 6.22% (4.87% to 7
.55%, table 5).
subgroup analysis
Patients with the highest levels of general practice utili-
sation tended to have lower continuity of care, while 
also experiencing more admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions. Thus, the heaviest users of general 
practice had a mean usual provider of care index score 
of 0.56 (compared with 0.69 for the lowest fifth), and 
0.36 admissions on average (compared with 0.04 for the 
lowest fifth)—see supplementary appendix 2. Table 5 
 
presents the results of the subgroup analysis that exam-
ined how the association between the usual provider of 
care index score and admissions for ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions varied between fifths defined by 
general practice utilisation. There was some indication 
of a U-shaped curve, but the evidence for a link between 
the usual provider of care index score and admissions 
was greatest among the most frequent users of general 
practice. For patients in the two highest fifths of general 
practice utilisation (12-17 contacts and ≥18 contacts), a 
0.2 increase in the usual provider of care index score was 
associated with a reduction in ambulatory care sensitive 
admissions of 3.32% (95% confidence interval 0.76% to 
5.82%) and 3.97% (1.91% to 6.00%), respectively 
(P<0.001) (table 5 ). The associations were less statisti-
cally significant at lower levels of general practice utili-
sation. Table 5 also presents the results of the subgroup 
analysis for age group: although an inverse relation was 
observed between the usual provider of care index score 
and admissions for each age group, the strength of the 
relationship was larger among older patients.

care index score was strongly correlated with the usual 
provider of care index score, showing a Pearson correla-
tion coefficient of 0.96. When we repeated our modelling 
using the Bice-Boxerman continuity of care index, a 0.2 
increase in that score was associated with 3.58% fewer 
admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions 
(95% confidence interval 2.40% to 4.76%, P<0.001).
discussion
Preventing hospital admissions is a priority in many 
countries, and in England unplanned admissions for 
ambulatory care sensitive conditions (those considered 
to be manageable in primary care) accounted for 
£1.42bn of spending in 2009/10 (£170 590 for each gen-
eral practice).34 Since strategies are needed to manage 
demand for secondary care, we examined the associa-
tion between continuity of care and hospital admis-
sions among older patients (aged 62-82 years). 
Continuity of care varied considerably across general 
practices in England, with 48.6% of patients in smaller 
practices and 30.7% of patients in larger practices fall-
ing into our defined high continuity group. 
Patients who saw the same general practitioner a 
greater proportion of the time experienced fewer admis-
sions to hospital for ambulatory care sensitive condi-
tions than other patients. Indeed, compared with 
patients with low continuity of care, patients with 
medium continuity of care experienced 8.96% fewer of 
these admissions, and those with high continuity of 
care experienced 12.49% fewer. There was greater evi-
dence for an association between continuity of care and 
admissions among those with the highest levels of con-
tacts with general practitioners. As well as showing this 
clearer link between continuity and reductions, the 
heaviest users had lower continuity of care (mean usual 
provider of care index 0.56 v 0.61) and more admissions 
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (0.36 per per-
son on average v 0.16).
Our findings suggest there is opportunity to improve 
care and reduce hospital admissions among the highest 
users of healthcare, but there are various explanations 
of our findings that must first be carefully considered. 
One possibility is that when patients receive more con-
tinuous care, their doctors might be better able to under-
stand their health needs within time constrained 
appointments and thus provide care that is more appro-
priate to the needs of the patient. Continuity of care

might also promote a more effective and trusting rela-
tionship between patients and doctors, leading to a bet-
ter understanding of health problems and greater 
adherence to the agreed course of treatment. One would 
expect these benefits to be felt most keenly in those 
patients who need to visit the general practitioner fre-
quently. However, it is important to note that identifying 
a causal mechanism is beyond the scope of this study.
To our knowledge no previous study has examined 
the association between longitudinal continuity of care 
in primary care (measured by usual provider of care 
index) and admissions for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions. However, a study of older patients in pri-
mary care in one Canadian province found that those 
with a medium degree of longitudinal continuity of 
care, measured through the usual provider of care 
index, had 27% (95% confidence interval 25% to 29%) 
more visits to an emergency department than those 
with high continuity of care.26  And although it relates to 
a different process, the GP patient survey in England 
asks patients whether they were able to see the general 
practitioner of their choice, and practices scoring more 
highly on this metric tend to have lower rates of hospital 
admissions.24  A body of literature has looked at the 
effect of continuity in secondary care.50 
51
strengths and limitations of this study
We were able to study linked records for 230 472 patients, 
resulting in small confidence intervals around our esti-
mated values. Patients registered with practices partici-
pating in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink are 
broadly representative of those in England, but we 
restricted our analysis to practices submitting up-to-stan-
dard data.40  We examined the period between 2011 and 
2013; however, we do not believe that the associations 
found are likely to have changed with time. We cannot 
directly assess the representativeness of the 200 prac-
tices in our study sample, although we note that 26.3% of 
our study sample lived in the 20% least socioeconomi-
cally deprived areas, compared with 11.0% in the 20% 
most deprived areas. This may be partly because our 
study was restricted to those aged between 62 and 82 
years. We focused on older patients because they tend to 
experience more admissions for ambulatory care sensi-
tive conditions than other age groups,34  but older people 
may be less likely to live in deprived areas.52 In addition, 
we limited our analysis to those patients with a minimum 
of two contacts with general practitioners, to ensure our 
metric was sensitive. Although we cannot establish the 
association between the usual provider of care index 
score and admissions for people younger than 62 or older 
than 82, we note that our subgroup analysis showed a 
strong age gradient within our sample. More studies are 
needed, but it is possible that continuity of care is more 
directly related to admissions among those with a higher 
burden of chronic disease, which includes older people 
as well as those living in more deprived areas.
We chose the usual provider of care index since it is 
more easily interpreted than some of the other metrics of 
care continuity.47 
49  However, we performed sensitivity 
analysis using the Bice-Boxerman continuity of care 
index, which compared with the usual provider of care 
index is more sensitive to the distribution of contacts 
across multiple doctors (in addition to the proportion of 
contacts with most regular doctors).48 The two indices 
were highly correlated. Although the level of association 
differed, both showed an association with admissions 
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Furthermore, 
the association remained when we modelled the usual 
provider of care index score as a categorical rather than 
continuous variable. In that analysis, the thresholds we 
applied to divide patients into high, medium, and low 
continuity of care groups were necessarily arbitrary, and 
there were also some limitations to the way in which we 
calculated the usual provider of care index score. By 
focusing on general practitioners, we did not assess the 
importance of the continuity of care provided by prac-
tice nurses and healthcare assistants. Also, some cau-
tion is needed in relation to larger practices, since it is 
possible that in those practices patients are deliberately 
managed by several general practitioners working in a 
small team (for example, to provide cover when doctors 
work part time). Ideally, we would have adapted the 
usual provider of care index to allow for these “micro-
teams,” but the requisite information was not available.
We aimed to assess longitudinal continuity of care, 
and we could not assess the quality of the interactions 
from the patient perspective or whether patients saw 
their preferred doctor. It is possible that measures of 
interpersonal, management, and informational conti-
nuity would also show an association with utilisation of 
secondary care, and that patients’ definitions of conti-
nuity of care might vary from that presented here.13  By 
analysing admissions for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions, rather than all unplanned admissions, we 
aimed to focus on those admissions most likely to be 
preventable by good quality primary care. However, 
administrative data provide limited information to 
determine whether individual admissions are avoidable 
or desirable. For example, heart failure is often classi-
fied as an ambulatory care sensitive condition, but even 
when managed according to evidence informed guide-
lines, it will gradually deteriorate to the point at which 
hospital admission may be required. However, if only a 
subset of the admissions for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions were avoidable, then this would bias the 
magnitude of our results towards showing a smaller 
association. We did not examine the association 
between continuity of care and other forms of second-
ary care, community healthcare, or social care, and 
indeed there is some evidence that increased continuity 
of care may lead to later referral for cancer care.31
This was a cross sectional, observational study. 
Although such studies can test for associations between 
characteristics, a common concern is that any associa-
tion may be attributable to differences in unobserved 
confounders. Our analysis cannot tease out whether 
continuity is a component of high quality care that has a 
consequential effect on hospital admissions, or whether 
increased continuity of care and reduced hospital 
admissions are both outcomes of high quality care. Fur-
thermore, a cross sectional study cannot examine the

mechanism or direction of action—for example, general 
practitioners may alter their management of a patient 
immediately before or after an admission to hospital, 
potentially leading to improved continuity of care after 
hospital discharge. Moreover, although we examined 
patient subgroups defined by general practice utilisa-
tion, continuity of care might be particularly important 
for groups that we could not isolate from the data, such 
as those unable to adopt self care strategies.53 Continuity 
of care might also be more important at some times than 
others—for example, according to the onset of acute 
health problems or after discharge from hospital. 
Finally, the importance of continuity of care might vary 
according to local context and the broader approach to 
managing patients within a general practice, including 
the role of practice nurses and specialist general practi-
tioners, how information is shared within the practice, 
and working in a micro-team.
Conclusions and implications
This study motivates a renewed focus on promoting 
continuity of care, and it suggests that continuity is an 
important consideration when designing approaches to 
reduce hospital admissions. Over the past decade, ini-
tiatives to prevent hospital admissions have tended to 
prioritise speed and equity of access to primary care 
over continuity of care.54  In England, one of the few 
recent national initiatives to improve the continuity of 
care in general practice was the mandatory introduc-
tion of named accountable general practitioners,55  but 
this had no discernible impact on longitudinal continu-
ity of care, at least for patients aged 75 over the first nine 
months.56 Therefore, approaches are needed to improve 
continuity of care in general practice.
Several approaches have been suggested, including 
increasing patient awareness of the importance of conti-
nuity, changing receptionists’ behaviour or practice 
booking systems to promote continuity, and organising 
large practices into small teams, each of which care for a 
subset of the patients registered at the practice, meaning 
that patients receive continuous care at team level rather 
than individual level. These can be explored further.9  Of 
course it cannot be assumed on the basis of this study 
that interventions that successfully improve the conti-
nuity of care will necessarily lead to reductions in hospi-
tal admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, 
and interventions will require careful evaluation. A com-
plementary approach would be to make data on conti-
nuity of care available to general practice teams for 
quality improvement initiatives, as recommended by the 
Royal College of General Practitioners.57  In this study we 
measured continuity of care using data that are already 
available to general practice teams from the electronic 
medical record, although in some cases the analytical 
capability to analyse these data may be lacking.58 
Despite the limitations of these data, we have demon-
strated a link with hospital admission rates. We have 
also shown that interventions could be targeted at easily 
identifiable groups of patients. This suggests that the 
usual provider of care index could inform strategies for 
quality improvement, although it may need to be 
adapted for local context, and its responsiveness to ser-
vice change would need to be tested.
Continuity of care aligns closely with the reasons

59 and shows variability between general 
practices. As we show, continuity of care is also associ-
ated with avoidable hospital admissions. Thus initia-
tives that improve the continuity of care have the 
potential to improve the quality of healthcare while 
reducing cost, both fundamental aims of healthcare 
systems.
