he physiological effects of vitamin D on calcium/phosphorus metabolism have been well studied since its discovery in the early 20th 
century. With recent advances in cellular and molecular biology, its role in maintaining normal brain functions and the protection of neurons 
via maintenance of cellular homeostasis, immune regulation, modulation of synaptic structure and function are more clearly known. 
Recently, its deficiency is increasingly implicated in major neurocognitive disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and 
vascular dementia. Older adults are particularly vulnerable not only because vitamin D deficiency becomes more prevalent with aging, but they 
also are often complicated with other comorbid illnesses. This article reviews the role of vitamin D in maintaining normal brain functions, and 
implications for vitamin D deficiency in cognitive disorders.

Recent research suggests that vitamin D plays an important role in preventing and/or decreasing the 
risk of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders in addition to its well-established role in bone and 
calcium metabolism. It is estimated that 40–80% of geriatric patients have low levels of serum vitamin D.1 
In this article we review the latest research that examines the role of vitamin D in neurocognitive 
disorders in the geriatric population. We will look at the epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency with 
particular reference to older adults, the common sources of vitamin D, the reasons for vulnerability of 
older adults toward hypovitaminosis D, and the role of vitamin D in brain metabolism. Finally, we will 
conclude by summarizing new clinical data on the role of vitamin D in major neurocognitive disorders 
(MND) in older adults.
 
Epidemiology
Although there is some debate over what the reference range serum levels for vitamin D 
(25-hydroxyvitamin D) are, two of the more common definitions of the lower limit of normal are a 
serum level less than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or less than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL).2 Regardless, low serum 
concentrations of vitamin D are very common in the general population. It is approximated that in the 
United States over 40% of adults have serum vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL.2 This is even higher in 
certain subpopulations. For instance, approximately 60% of African Americans have vitamin D deficiency, 
and worldwide it is estimated that 40–80% of geriatric patients have low levels of serum vitamin D.1
In patients with cognitive difficulties, hypovitaminosis D is quite prevalent, with estimates ranging 
from 70–90%.3 Similarly, low vitamin D is prevalent in other pathologies such as depression, major 
neurocognitive disorder, and psychosis. One study noted that nearly 72% of psychogeriatric patients 
had low vitamin D.1 There is some preliminary data to suggest that early-stage idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) is also associated with low vitamin D levels, with one study citing that nearly 70% of 
patients with PD studied had low vitamin D.2
Sources of vitamin D
There are a few foods that are natural sources of vitamin D such as salmon, cod liver oil, and mackerel.1,2 
In addition to naturally occurring sources of vitamin D, many commercial food products are fortified 
with vitamin D, particularly dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt.1 There are also a plethora 
of over-the-counter vitamin supplements containing vitamin D.1 However, the major source of vitamin 
D for most people is endogenous production necessitating sunlight.1 When sunlight, particularly 
ultraviolet B radiation, interacts with the skin, it facilitates the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol 
 
(7-DHC) in the skin to 25-hydroxyvitamin D.2 Therefore, any factors that reduce direct sunlight exposure, 
such as use of high-sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen, having more melanin in the skin, staying 
indoors, or geographical location, could cause decreased levels of vitamin D.2

Risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in older adults
As people get older, skin thickness and 7-DHC content decrease, leading to 
decreased capacity of the skin to produce vitamin D. The skin loses more 
than 50% of its ability to produce vitamin D at 70 years of age compared 
with 20 years of age.1
Multiple pathologies can contribute to the functional decline that occurs 
in the gastrointestinal system with aging. Atrophic gastritis, altered gastric 
absorption, and decreased hepatic metabolism are all common among 
older adults. Fat malabsorption from celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, 
Whipple’s disease or gastric bypass cause impaired absorption of vitamin 
D, a fat-soluble molecule. Similarly, because the liver is a site of vitamin D 
metabolism, hepatic dysfunction can also cause low vitamin D levels.2
In addition, chronic kidney disease can alter calcium metabolism 
and can ultimately cause decreased serum concentration of 
 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the physiologically active form of vitamin D, 
in older adults.3 Medications, such as glucocorticoids and antiepileptic 
drugs also impair vitamin D synthesis.2
Clinical implications
Individuals that have hypovitaminosis D as a result of a genetic defect 
in vitamin D binding protein have been shown to have an increased risk 
of all-cause mortality.4 Low vitamin D levels have been associated with 
a plethora of different conditions, such as obesity, osteoporosis, muscle 
weakness, cardiovascular disease, and a variety of MNDs.2 Specifically, 
vitamin D has been associated with incidence of cognitive decline and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), PD, and 
vascular dementia (VaD).5–12
Multiple studies have demonstrated a correlation between lower serum 
vitamin D levels and memory and cognitive decline in older adults.10,11,13 In 
a study that compared patients with MCI and low vitamin D levels with a 
group of similar patients with normal vitamin D levels, the group with lower 
vitamin D had more memory complaints, as measured by the Memory 
Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q). Other studies have also demonstrated 
this relationship between hypovitaminosis D and MCI.6
Although hypovitaminosis D is not an established risk factor for AD or 
PD, multiple studies have found a correlation between either disorder 
and low serum vitamin D concentrations.5,7,8 Other studies have failed to 
replicate these findings.14,15 However, there is evidence to suggest that this 
relationship is causal based on the finding that mutations in the vitamin D 
receptor (VDR) gene have been shown to correlate with development of 
AD and PD.16–21
Beyond the correlation with disease incidence, low vitamin D status 
may be a prognostic indicator of cognitive and mood outcomes in PD. 
One study found that lower vitamin D levels were related to a small but 
significant increase in severity of motor dysfunction in patients with PD 
after 36 months.8 Higher vitamin D levels in patients with PD have also been 
associated with improved cognition and mood.22 The finding that certain 
VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with poor cognitive function in 
patients with PD provides further support for this hypothesis.18,23
Vascular dementia also has a connection with vitamin D status. 
Multiple epidemiological studies on VaD have shown association with 
 
hypovitaminosis 
D.9,24,25 
One 
recent 
retrospective 
study 
utilizing 
neuroimaging failed to find any correlation.12 The significance of a correlation 
is controversial as there may be confounding variables related to lifestyle 
that may be responsible for this relationship. In order to investigate a 
causal relationship, one study examined whether vitamin D status was 
independently related to hypertension, a major etiology of VaD. The study 
found that low vitamin D was associated with higher blood pressure, but 
they could not support a causal relationship as ischemic stroke incidence 
had a significant relationship with observed hypovitaminosis D, but not with 
presumed hypovitaminosis D due to genetic predisposition.26
Role of vitamin D in the brain
Vitamin D plays a central role in normal brain functions and the protection 
of neurons via maintenance of cellular homeostasis, immune regulation, 
and modulation of synaptic structure and function. Vitamin D acts mostly 
via the VDR, which is a nuclear receptor that combines with the retinoid X 
receptor (RXR) to regulate gene transcription.27 Because vitamin D has a 
role in normal brain functions, which will be outlined below, we propose 
that hypovitaminosis D may contribute to cognitive decline with old age, 
AD, VaD, and PD. (See Figure 1).
Cellular homeostasis
In older adults there is an increase in influx of ionized calcium (Ca2+) into 
neuronal cell bodies, which interferes with the action potentials necessary 
for long-term potentiation (LTP) and the formation of new memories.28 
The increase in Ca2+ activates both ryanodine receptors (RYRs) and 
calcineurin, causing additional release of endogenous calcium and long-
term depolarization (LTD) (i.e., the erasing of memories), respectively. The 
increase in Ca2+ has been attributed to increased expression of the L-type 
voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (LVSCC); vitamin D3 downregulates the 
expression of multiple subunits of LVSCCs, and therefore vitamin D status 
mitigates the major cause of Ca2+ dysregulation with aging.28,31
The effects of vitamin D on Ca2+ regulation are essential to the prevention 
of cognitive decline and AD. One hypothesis even attributes the onset of 
AD to an initial vitamin D deficiency that begins a positive feedback loop 
between Ca2+ dysregulation and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque formation. This idea 
is supported by the discovery that Ca2+ dysregulation results in increases 
in the formation of Aβ plaques; Aβ increases influx of Ca2+ into cells as well 
as release from the endoplasmic reticulum.27 Furthermore, Aβ suppresses 
VDR expression, and increases expression of Cav1.2 (a subunit of LVSCC).32 
Conversely, vitamin D decreases expression of Aβ precursor protein (APP).33
Oxidative stress
Oxidative stress is known to induce apoptosis, which is a key component 
in neurodegenerative diseases.34 Therefore, antioxidants have an essential 
role in the brain where high oxygen consumption produces free radicals, 
e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS).35 Oxidative stress markers have 
been found to be associated with AD and mixed dementia.36 Many genes 
responsible for redox homeostasis are under the control of vitamin D and 
VDR/RXR. Expression of redox-sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (TNrf2) is under control of vitamin D. TNrf2 
is activated in response to increased levels of ROS and acts to increase 
the expression of many antioxidants, as well as feeding back to increase 
 
VDR/RXR expression.27 Vitamin D regulation of klotho expression, an anti-
aging gene, also reduces oxidative stress.37 Furthermore, expression of klotho 
is inversely correlated with Aβ accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation,

and the AD phenotype in mice.38 The receptor for advanced glycation end-
product (RAGE) is an enzyme whose expression is decreased by vitamin D. 
The RAGE is elevated in AD and contributes to oxidative stress by activating 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), a 
mitochondrial enzyme involved in ROS production.27 Glutathione (GSH) is a 
major antioxidant molecule in the brain; depletion of GSH is implicated in 
both AD and PD.35 Decreases in GSH are associated with enhanced transient 
receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) function in hippocampal 
pyramidal neurons leading to further Ca2+ dysregulation.39 Increases in Ca2+ 
increase mitochondrial production of ROS.27 Increases in ROS sensitize 
RYRs, exacerbating the increases in Ca2+, and therefore contributing to 
impairment of memory formation and retention through decreases in 
the slow component of afterhyperpolarization and LTD, respectively.30 
Vitamin D upregulates expression of both glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), 
which is responsible for GSH production, and glutathione reductase (GR), 
which reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) back to GSH, thereby reducing 
oxidative stress.40,41
The repetitive surges in Ca2+ in the dopaminergic neuronal pacemaker 
mechanism in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) predispose it to Ca2+ 
dysregulation leading to cell death via mitochondrial stress and production 
of ROS. The Ca2+ surges are mediated by LVSCCs, the expression of which 
is regulated by vitamin D. Therefore, the observed reduction of oxidative 
stress in the SNc from vitamin D supplementation can be explained by 
reduction in Ca2+ levels from decreased LVSCC expression. This preventative 
role of vitamin D in PD is further supported by the finding that a particular 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CACNA1C gene (codes for a 
subunit of LVSCC) is associated with PD, but only when vitamin D deficiency 
is also present.27,31,42 In addition to Ca2+ and redox homeostasis, vitamin D 
has been shown to regulate cellular homeostasis by increasing markers 
of autophagy, thereby inhibiting the PD process in both 1-methyl-4-phenyl-
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and rotenone models of induced PD.43,44
Immune modulatory and neurotrophic role
Pro-inflammatory state increases with age, contributing to cognitive 
decline and neurodegenerative disorders of the brain. Vitamin D is integral 
to regulating the central nervous system (CNS) immune system and 
mitigating these effects.45 Microglia, which are an essential part of the 
immune system in the brain, express CYP27B1 to synthesize calcitriol 
(1,25[OH]2D) from calcifediol (25[OH]2). Vitamin D promotes the expression 
of interleukin (IL)-10 by microglia, which acts by an intracrine mechanism to 
increase expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3). SOSCS3 
inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12 and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]).46 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D supplementation also 
inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemotactic 
protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 by monocytes.40 Recent transcriptomic analysis 
and a genome-wide analysis of VDR binding sites suggest that IL-8 
expression is under the primary control of vitamin D.47,48 Dendritic cells with 
higher available calcidiol (25[OH] D3) are able to influence T cell response to 
favor regulatory T cell differentiation and reduced inflammatory response 
from T cells.49 A key component of PD pathology is neuroinflammation, 
specifically the release of ROS by activated microglia causing both 
neurotoxicity and oligomerization of α-synuclein (Lewy body).50 Vitamin D 
supplementation has been shown to significantly reduce ROS production 
by monocytes.40 Vitamin D also inhibits the production of nitric oxide by 
activated microglial cells, further preventing neuronal cell damage.51 Brain 
pericytes respond to vitamin D by increasing expression of genes that inhibit 
neuroinflammation, mitigating the age-related inflammatory changes in the 
hippocampus that are pathological in AD. Additionally, pericytes respond to 
TNF-α and interferon-γ by inducing transcription of CYP27B1.52 Microglial 
overproduction of IL-1β leads to cognitive decline by inhibition of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), thereby interfering with hippocampal 
synaptic plasticity and LTP
.53 Vitamin D has been shown to mitigate the pro-
inflammatory state by increasing IL-10 and decreasing IL-1β expression, 
which is correlated with decreasing amyloid burden.45 This relationship 
with pro-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to be significant only 
in non-carriers of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4, while carriers of APOE-ε4 
who have AD have a positive relationship between vitamin D levels and 
Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3 and ergocalciferol or vitamin D2 follow the same metabolic 
pathway. Blood metabolites include 25(OH)D produced by the liver, which is bound to 
vitamin D binding protein. Renal and extra-renal CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase) produces 
the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D. 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)2D enters the cell through passive 
diffusion or megalin-dependent transport. Once inside the cell, 1,25(OH)2D binds to its 
nuclear receptor VDR and after dimerization with RXR, forms a regulatory complex which 
can bind target genes that contain a vitamin D responsive element (VDRE). 1,25(OH)2D 
can also induce rapid non-genomic responses by binding to its membrane receptor 
(MARRS) or a membrane VDR and regulate the activity of adenylate cyclase, PLC, and 
PKC proteins. 1,25(OH)2D also induces modulation of calcium release from intracellular 
stores and can interact with TGF and EGF receptors to modulate cell cycle processes. 
These different modes of action and the crosstalks operated by vitamin D signaling 
ultimately lead to transcription modulation of hundreds of genes, depending on the cell-
type considered. Reproduced with permission from Landel et al., 2016.77

pro-inflammatory cytokines.54 Vitamin D also induces nerve growth factor 
release in cortical neurons, which confers protective effects and has been 
shown to decrease expression of APP
.31,55 
Vitamin D also appears to have an important impact on VaD by reducing 
the likelihood of secondary immune-mediated injury to the CNS caused 
by stroke or small vessel disease. Indeed, early work demonstrated 
that ischemic injury caused by infarction is reduced with vitamin D 
supplementation in rats, which is attributed to increased expression of 
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).56 When compared with 
patients with higher vitamin D levels, patients with lower vitamin D levels at 
the time of ischemic strokes had larger ischemic infarct volumes, increased 
levels of cognitive impairment, and decreased improvement in function 
during rehabilitation.57,58 
Synaptic role
Vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to increase neuronal 
excitability in the hippocampus of rats – loss of neuronal excitability occurs 
with aging and is a proposed cause of cognitive decline. Vitamin D also 
upregulated multiple genes that were essential for synaptic plasticity 
(synaptojanin 1 and synaptotagmin 2, calcium/calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase IIδ [CaMKIIδ]), as well as those for normal synaptic functioning 
(receptors for several major neurotransmitters including dopamine, 
glutamate, and serotonin receptors).59
Dysfunction of the substantia nigra seen in PD has been attributed  to a 
decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine synthesis.60 It has 
been observed that vitamin D supplementation increases TH expression 
and dopamine production in dopaminergic neurons. The study also shows 
that vitamin D upregulates N-cadherin which plays a role in neurogenesis of 
dopamine neurons as well as in synaptic plasticity and memory.61,62
1,25(OH)D treatment has been shown to increase the activity of choline 
acetyltransferase activity and increase acetylcholine levels in brain areas 
relevant to AD. Type 2 diabetes, a major risk factor for cognitive decline 
and AD, is thought to induce reduction in acetylcholine levels seen in 
AD. An improvement in cognitive decline related to type 2 diabetes with 
vitamin D supplementation has been observed in animal (rat) models 
mediated by increased choline acetyltransferase activity and a decrease in 
acetylcholinesterase activity.
Glutathione can act as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. It is thought 
to confer protection against glutamate excitotoxicity by acting on glutamate 
receptors. Glutathione levels are increased by vitamin D supplementation, 
and thus it has been demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation can 
prevent the glutamate toxicity implicated in cognitive decline.65
Along with the previously mentioned regulation of dopamine, vitamin D 
responsive elements (VDREs) are found in tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 
promoter regions, and 1,25(OH)D increased expression of TPH2 mRNA 
(messenger RNA) in the brain, implying vitamin D control over serotonin 
levels in the brain.66 Indeed, 1,25(OH)D treatment prevented both dopamine 
and serotonin depletion in certain areas of the brain.67
Genetic connection
Allelic differences in genes related to vitamin D status and normal functions 
of vitamin D have been implicated in cognitive decline, AD, and PD.10 Certain 
SNPs in the gene for vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) have been shown 
to correlate with both lower serum vitamin D levels and cognitive decline 
with age.10
Incidence of PD has been shown to be increased in individuals with certain 
polymorphisms in the VDR gene. However, the findings that support this 
are variable in respect to the particular sites that are related to the risk 
of PD. Polymorphisms at the FokI site on VDR was associated with PD 
across multiple studies.18–20,68,69 BsmI polymorphisms were also associated 
with PD susceptibility in two meta-analyses, one of which specified 
that this correlation was only found in the Asian population studied.19,20 
Polymorphisms in TaqI and ApaI were generally shown to not be associated 
with PD with two exceptions: one study of 382 patients with PD and 242 
healthy controls found a correlation between ApaI genotype and PD; 
another study on individuals with high lifetime ultraviolet exposure found 
that homozygotes of particular TaqI and ApaI alleles had a substantial and 
significant decreased risk of PD.18,21 The former of the previous two studies 
also found that genotype of VDBP confers a risk for PD.18
Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms are also associated with the risk of 
AD. ApaI genotype was found to be a risk factor in two original studies 
and one meta-analysis.17,19,70 The aforementioned meta-analysis also found 
a relationship between TaqI genotype and AD.19 In other studies, a direct 
relationship with TaqI was not found; however one study did observe 
that the haplotype of ApaI and TaqI did demonstrate a correlation with 
AD susceptibility. Similarly, other SNP sites studied did not individually 
demonstrate a link to AD, but the haplotype of five sites including ApaI, 
TaqI, BsmI, Tru9I, and FokI (which the authors titled TaubF) did demonstrate 
a significant relationship in one study despite the latter three sites having 
no individual significance in this regard.16 An allele of the binding site of 
the transcription factor CDX-2 on the VDR gene is associated with lower 
promoter activity and correlated with late-onset AD.33
A known risk factor for AD is genotype of APOE. Specifically, the APOE-ε4 
allele is known to confer a risk for AD. One study demonstrated that non-
carriers of APOE-ε4 had a negative correlation between pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and vitamin D versus a positive correlation in carriers of APOE-ε4. 
This implies that hypovitaminosis D confers a greater risk for AD in those 
without this genetic predisposition.54
Other mechanisms
In addition to the mechanisms discussed previously, vitamin D is involved 
in several other processes related to AD. Hypovitaminosis D has even been 
associated with subjective cognitive complaint, an early predictor of MNDs 
and AD.71 1α,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 has been shown to induce clearance of Aβ 
and reduction of amyloid burden through phagocytosis by macrophages 
and efflux across the blood–brain barrier (BBB).72,73 Efflux is thought to 
be mediated through induction of P-glycoprotein expression by vitamin 
D.74 Two recent studies have implicated vitamin D in the regulation of Aβ 
production based on mRNA transcriptional analysis demonstrating vitamin 
D transcription regulation of genes involved in APP processing, as well as 
co-localization of VDR on neuronal cell membranes with APP and enzymes 
involved in APP processing.75,76 Recent transcriptomic analysis also found 
vitamin D/VDR regulation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and insulin growth 
factor 1 (IGF1), and suggests a role for these two signaling pathways in 
preventing brain aging and neurodegenerative disease through neuronal 
survival, synaptic plasticity, and against Aβ toxicity.47 This mechanism 
 45

involving estrogen could also explain why there appears to be a much 
stronger connection between vitamin D and AD in females.77 It is proposed 
that klotho is responsible for inhibiting the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway, 
thereby preventing aging. This idea is supported by the fact that vitamin D 
reverses insulin signaling disruption in a model of AD.78 
In addition to genetic impacts of vitamin D/VDR, vitamin D also acts via the 
membrane-associated rapid response steroid-binding receptor (MARRS). In 
mice, activation of MARRS was shown to induce cognitive improvements 
and increased axon density in the medial prefrontal and perirhinal cortices, 
inducing cognitive improvements.79
Treatment implications
Alzheimer’s disease
Recent consensus on the role of vitamin D in AD determined that because 
hypovitaminosis D is considered to be etiological for AD, it should be 
screened for and corrected in patients with cognitive impairment.80 
An early prospective study showing lower AD among women with 
higher dietary vitamin D intake at 7-year follow-up, showed consuming 
 
~800 IU/day divided AD risk by five.81 In patients with AD, vitamin D may be 
a useful standalone treatment, as it was shown to increase Aβ clearance in 
a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT).82 Another RCT using adults with 
dementia found significant improvement over a 3- and 6-month period for 
patients being supplemented with vitamin D versus those patients who were 
not supplemented.83 One RCT showed significant benefit to using vitamin D 
in tandem with a standard therapy – memantine – demonstrating greater 
benefit and potentiating effects of using the two agents together.84 Another 
study using animal models (mice) of AD demonstrated that combined 
vitamin D and resveratrol (an antioxidant) treatment was more effective 
than vitamin D alone in preventing neuronal degeneration.78 Vitamin D was 
also shown to improve cognition, cholinergic transmission, and episodic 
memory in diabetic rats.64 An important study recently showed the first 
therapeutic program to reverse cognitive decline in AD. The treatment was 
customized for each individual patient and considered both genetic and 
metabolic markers in the design of treatment programs. Vitamin D status 
was considered, and vitamin D supplementation was included in multiple 
cases.85 Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D, 
and what concurrent treatments work best with it.
Parkinson’s disease
Despite mounting evidence of a causal role of hypovitaminosis D in PD, 
there has only been one randomized placebo-controlled trial using vitamin 
D supplementation in PD. The 12-month study measured the disease 
with the modified HY scale (Hoehn and Yahr scale: a measure of disease 
progression which outlines the stages of PD in a one-to-five scale, with one 
being “Unilateral involvement only” and five being “Wheelchair bound or 
bedridden unless aided”), the UPDRS (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating 
Scale: a six-part evaluation of the progression of PD, which includes the HY 
scale), the PDQ39 (Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire–39: an assessment 
of quality of life in PD), and the MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination: a 
30-point questionnaire commonly used to evaluate cognitive impairment). 
All scores were assessed while patients were on concurrent standard 
therapy, namely levodopa. The results showed significantly more increase 
on the HY scale in the control group (0.33) versus the vitamin D group (0.02). 
Part II scores of the UPDRS, which is a self-evaluation of the activities of daily 
life, were found to remain unchanged in the vitamin D group, but became 
significantly worse in the placebo group. On the other hand, the rest of the 
parts of the UPDRS, as well as the MMSE were not different within groups 
or between groups. Importantly, the study also found that when comparing 
the results with specific genotypes for the VDR gene, these differences 
were only significant in patients with the FokI TT and CT genotype, but not 
the CC genotype.86 There is a clear need for further study in this area.
Vascular dementia
The effects of vitamin D in VaD are still controversial. However, multiple 
studies have found an association between hypovitaminosis D and VaD 
as outlined below. Vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to increase 
the risk of VaD; furthermore, the risk for those with hypertension and 
hypovitaminosis D was much greater than for the risk increase from 
hypertension alone in the older adult Asian-Indian population.9 An 
association has also been found between serum 25(OH)D level and 
cerebral small vessel disease – a common cause of cognitive dysfunction 
in older adults.24 Additionally, there is an association between serum 25(OH)
D level and micro- and macrovascular events in patients with type 2 
diabetes.25 Recent transcriptomic analysis has shown some regulation of 
expression of genes involved in both vascular and endothelial processes.47 
Regarding vitamin D as a treatment, one study has shown vitamin D given 
in combination with memantine prevents axonal degeneration caused by 
exposure to lysed blood as is the case with intracranial hemorrhage.87
General considerations
With new emphasis on the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin 
D status, there has been an increase in the use of vitamin D supplements. 
Unfortunately, this has also led to an increase in cases of vitamin D 
intoxication, with one review finding 75% of all reports being published 
since 2010.88 Vitamin D intoxication is uncommon overall, but it can lead to 
hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria with fatal outcomes possible in extreme 
cases; therefore special consideration should be taken when correcting 
vitamin D deficiency. However, vitamin D intoxication is rare, and typically only 
occurs when very large doses are taken for an extended period of time. One 
review noted that there were no recorded cases of vitamin D intoxication at 
oral intake less than 30,000 IU/day.89 Therefore, based on recommendations 
on vitamin D supplementation from the American Geriatrics Society, we 
recommend a starting dose of 1,000 IU/day to treat vitamin D deficiency in 
older adults which should be titrated up based on serum measurements.90
Conclusion
Vitamin D deficiency is very common in older adults for a variety of reasons, 
as discussed above. Accumulating evidence shows that vitamin D plays 
a central role in calcium homeostasis, neurotransmission, Aβ and tau 
accumulation, oxidative stress, and immune regulation. Hypovitaminosis 
D may cause dysfunction of the physiological mechanisms listed above, 
thereby contributing to cognitive decline with old age, AD, VaD, and 
PD. Many observational studies and preclinical studies reported direct 
associations between decreased 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations and 
MNDs. Although evidence from randomized placebo-controlled trials is 
scarce, several trials have reported cognitive improvements among older 
adults supplemented with vitamin D. Further evidence from well designed 
and adequately powered clinical trials is required to establish the role of 
vitamin D in preventing or treating MNDs in older adults. Based on the 
current evidence we recommend as a minimum a sensible increase in 
vitamin D intake in geriatric patients, or, more extensively, monitoring and 
correction of serum vitamin D levels, especially in those afflicted by, or at 
risk of, neurocognitive disorders.
