 IMPORTANCE—Bariatric surgery induces significant weight loss for severely obese patients, but 
there is limited evidence of the durability of weight loss compared with nonsurgical matches and 
across bariatric procedures.
OBJECTIVES—To examine 10-year weight change in a large, multisite, clinical cohort of 
veterans who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) compared with nonsurgical matches 
and the 4-year weight change in veterans who underwent RYGB, adjustable gastric banding 
(AGB), or sleeve gastrectomy (SG).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—In this cohort study, differences in weight change 
up to 10 years after surgery were estimated in retrospective cohorts of 1787 veterans who 
underwent RYGB from January 1, 2000, through September 30, 2011 (573 of 700 eligible [81.9%] 
with 10-year follow-up), and 5305 nonsurgical matches (1274 of 1889 eligible [67.4%] with 10-
year follow-up) in mixed-effects models. Differences in weight change up to 4 years were 
compared among veterans undergoing RYGB (n = 1785), SG (n = 379), and AGB (n = 246). Data 
analysis was performed from September 9, 2014, to February 12, 2016.
EXPOSURES—Bariatric surgical procedures and usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Weight change up to 10 years after surgery through 
December 31, 2014.
RESULTS—The 1787 patients undergoing RYGB had a mean (SD) age of 52.1 (8.5) years and 
5305 nonsurgical matches had a mean (SD) age of 52.2 (8.4) years. Patients undergoing RYGB 
and nonsurgical matches had a mean body mass index of 47.7 and 47.1, respectively, and were 
predominantly male (1306 [73.1%] and 3911 [73.7%], respectively). Patients undergoing RYGB 
lost 21% (95% CI, 11%-31%) more of their baseline weight at 10 years than nonsurgical matches. 
A total of 405 of 564 patients undergoing RYGB (71.8%) had more than 20% estimated weight 
loss, and 224 of 564 (39.7%) had more than 30% estimated weight loss at 10 years compared with 
134 of 1247 (10.8%) and 48 of 1247 (3.9%), respectively, of nonsurgical matches. Only 19 of 564 
patients undergoing RYGB (3.4%) regained weight back to within an estimated 5% of their 
baseline weight by 10 years. At 4 years, patients undergoing RYGB lost 27.5% (95% CI, 
23.8%-31.2%) of their baseline weight, patients undergoing AGB lost 10.6% (95% CI, 
0.6%-20.6%), and patients undergoing SG lost 17.8% (95% CI, 9.7%-25.9%). Patients undergoing 
RYGB lost 16.9% (95% CI, 6.2%-27.6%) more of their baseline weight than patients undergoing 
AGB and 9.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-18.6%) more than patients undergoing SG.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Patients in the Veterans Administration health care 
system lost substantially more weight than nonsurgical matches and sustained most of this weight 
loss in the long term. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induced significantly greater weight loss among 
veterans than SG or AGB at 4 years. These results provide further evidence of the beneficial 
association between surgery and long-term weight loss that has been demonstrated in shorter-term 
studies of younger, predominantly female populations.
Obesity is a chronic disease, and prior research has clearly demonstrated that bariatric 
surgery is the most effective intervention for inducing weight loss among obese patients.1-4 
Much of this evidence is based on relatively short 1- to 3-year follow-up from randomized 
clinical trials3 that suggest that bariatric procedures are superior to nonsurgical interventions, 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) induces greater weight loss than sleeve gastrectomy

 (SG), and RYGB and SG are superior to adjustable gastric banding (AGB) for weight 
loss.3,5
Much less is known about the durability of weight loss after bariatric surgery because few 
studies6-13 have reported outcomes from patient cohorts with sufficient long-term follow-up. 
Results from previous published studies are limited by having small sample sizes,9,12,14,15 
being from single institutions, not having nonsurgical comparators,13,16-18 or reporting 
outcomes from obsolete bariatric procedures.19 In a systematic review20 of 7371 bariatric 
studies, only 29 studies (0.4%) associated with 7971 patients had at least 80% retention and 
2 years of follow-up. Only 4 studies had 5 or more years of follow-up. In those 4 studies, 
weight regain began 3 years after surgery for patients undergoing RYGB and AGB, implying 
that the long-term effects of these procedures might not be durable. It is unclear whether 
weight loss after bariatric surgery is superior to nonsurgical care in the long term.19,21,22 
There is a need for outcomes studies from large, controlled, multisite cohorts that have a 
high degree of long-term follow-up.20 There is also a need to understand the long-term 
weight loss outcomes of men and older patients who undergo bariatric surgery because most 
prior studies6-13 have included predominantly younger women and obesity-related 
complications tend to be more severe in men. Thus, the benefits of bariatric surgery may be 
greater in men. Knowing long-term outcomes from bariatric surgery is important because 
obesity is a chronic disease, and the results of its treatments are most meaningful for long-
term not short-term outcomes.
To address persistent questions about the long-term durability of bariatric surgery, we 
compared 10-year weight change between patients undergoing RYGB and nonsurgical 
matches from a large, multisite, clinical cohort.23 Finally, to better understand the 
comparative effectiveness of the 3 major surgical procedures (RYGB, SG, and AGB),24,25 
we compared weight change up to 4 years after surgery, a period for which we had complete 
follow-up information for patients undergoing SG, which is a more recently developed 
procedure.
Methods
Study Design and Study Population
A retrospective cohort study was performed of Veterans Affairs (VA) bariatric surgery 
patients and a matched cohort of severely obese veterans who had not undergone bariatric 
surgery. This study was approved by the VA Surgical Improvement Program of the VA 
Office of Patient Care Services, the institutional review boards (including waiver of 
informed consent) of the Durham and North Texas VA medical centers, and the Group 
Health Research Institute. Veterans who underwent any bariatric surgical procedure in VA 
bariatric centers or community hospitals reimbursed by the VA from January 1, 2000, 
through September 30, 2011, were studied (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Data analysis was 
performed from September 9, 2014, to February 12, 2016. After excluding veterans with 
missing preoperative body mass index (BMI) (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided 
by height in meters squared) or a BMI less than 35, no valid bariatric procedure code, a 
baseline diagnosis considered a medical exclusion for surgery, a presurgical stay longer than 
5 days, or no recorded inpatient stay at date of surgery, the surgical cohort included 1844

 veterans undergoing RYGB, 381 undergoing SG, 249 undergoing AGB, and 26 undergoing 
other procedures.
Potential matches for patients undergoing RYGB were identified from VA electronic health 
records using sequential stratification matching.26-28 Sequential stratification resembles a 
series of n = 1 trials in which each trial start date was each surgical patient's surgery date and 
allows matching of treated to untreated patients in longitudinal studies where controls have 
multiple potential index dates and evolving comorbid health condition incidence. Potential 
matches were identified based on sex, diabetes diagnosis, race, VA region, age, Diagnostic 
Cost Group score, and BMI measured within 6 months before surgery. Up to 3 matches were 
selected for each surgical case based on the smallest caliper29 that preserved covariate 
balance while minimizing the loss of patients undergoing RYGB for lack of comparable 
matches. Potential matches often had many BMI measurements during the study period so 
they could match to more than one surgical patient. Controls who underwent bariatric 
surgery at a later date contributed person-time to the control group until their surgery date. 
From the original sample of 1844 patients undergoing RYGB,23 we excluded patients who 
died within 1 year of surgery (n = 52 patients), who lacked postsurgical weights (n = 4), and 
who had inpatient weights only after surgery (n = 1). The analysis of patients undergoing 
RYGB and nonsurgical matches included 1787 patients undergoing RYGB and 5305 
nonsurgical matches, representing 5052 unique individuals because controls were allowed to 
match to multiple surgical patients.
For an unmatched comparison of postsurgical weight changes across surgical procedures, we 
excluded patients who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 8) or biliary pancreatic 
diversion (n = 12), who died within 1 year of surgery (n = 61), who only had inpatient 
weights after surgery (n = 1), who lacked postsurgical weights (n = 6), or who did not have a 
weight measurement within 5 years after surgery (n = 2 patients undergoing RYGB). This 
resulted in a final sample of 1785 patients undergoing RYGB, 246 undergoing AGB, and 
379 undergoing SG (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Definition and Cleaning of Weight Outcome
Follow-up weight data were obtained from measurements recorded in the electronic health 
records during outpatient visits from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2014. The 
primary outcome was percentage change in weight at follow-up compared with baseline, 
which is less confounded by baseline BMI than other commonly reported measures (eg, 
percentage of excess weight loss).30 Baseline weight data on the surgery day was available 
for 78.6% of patients undergoing RYGB but only 2.2% of nonsurgical matches, and the 
mean (SD) number of days for the baseline weight measurement before surgery was 7.3 
(24.0) for patients undergoing RYGB and 59.8 (48.6) for nonsurgical matches.
Postsurgical weight measurements are highly variable and have a nonlinear trend, so we 
developed a multistep outlier-detection algorithm that examined the SD of consecutively 
measured weights (eAppendix in the Supplement). An algorithm to identify multiple weight 
measures on the same day, or weights that deviated from clinically plausible trends over 
time, excluded a small proportion (4201 of 89 757 [4.7%]) of weight measurements.

 Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was developed to estimate mean trajectories of the percentage of 
weight change and estimates at specific postsurgical years. Penalized spline mixed-effects 
models were used, with piecewise linear functions with pre-specified knots included as fixed 
and random effects at the population-average and subject-specific levels.31,32 This approach 
allowed us to estimate overall mean trajectories and individual trajectories with enough 
flexibility to reflect weight change fluctuations during an individual's entire follow-up 
(eFigure 3 in the Supplement illustrates 75 cases).
Because of the extent of weight change in the 2 years after surgery, our primary model 
specification for the overall mean included a linear term for time and knots at 3 months, 6 
months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. All time terms were interacted with a treatment 
indicator to allow differential estimates for patients undergoing RYGB and nonsurgical 
matches using HPMIXED in SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). The 
model also included individual-level random effects with knots at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 
and 9 years; a subject-level random slope to account for correlation among patients’ 
repeated measures; and a VA geographic area–level random slope to account for correlation 
between each pair matched within VA geographic area and patients matching more than 
once. Estimate statements were used to generate the predicted percentage of weight change 
at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years of follow-up for the patients undergoing RYGB compared with the 
nonsurgical matches. The model's empirical Bayes estimates were used to calculate patients’ 
predicted weights at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years only for those with a weight measurement 
within a 12-month interval of (6 months before to 6 months after) and at least 1 
measurement after each follow-up year, which were used to classify each patient as having 
lost less than 5%, 5% or more, 10% or more, 20% or more, and 30% or more of their 
baseline weight. The 12-month interval requirement modestly reduced the number of 
patients for whom individual weights could be predicted. For example, 573 surgical patients 
were followed up for at least 10 years, but only 564 of these 573 had a weight measurement 
between 9.5 and 10.5 years. Patients’ predicted weights at 10 years of follow-up were used 
to calculate mean weight loss and excess body weight loss from baseline.
A similar model with knots specified at 3 months, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years was used 
to compare weight change through 4 years of follow-up across surgical procedures, which 
had shorter follow-up because of the recent introduction of the SG procedure and study end 
date of December 31, 2014 (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). To understand the effect of 
baseline differences in patients who underwent each surgical procedure, patients’ predicted 
percentage of weight loss at 4 years was regressed on surgery type while adjusting for 
baseline BMI, comorbidity score, demographics, and diabetes status (eTable in the 
Supplement).

 nonsurgical matches were predominantly white (1503 [84.1%] and 4452 [83.9%], 
respectively); 981 (54.9%) and 2927 (55.2%) had diagnosed diabetes and 595 (33.3%) and 
1742 (32.8%) were superobese (BMI ≥50) at baseline, respectively. Patients undergoing 
RYGB had a mean (SD) BMI of 47.7 (7.8) and 1306 (73.1%) were male, whereas 
nonsurgical matches had a mean (SD) BMI of 47.1 (7.2) and 3911 (73.7%) were male. 
Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression were common in both groups (Table). Follow-
up rates were high (eFigure 1 in the Supplement): 95.6% up to 3 years and 81.9% up to 10 
years for surgical patients and 91.1% up to 3 years and 67.4% up to 10 years for nonsurgical 
matches.
Ten-Year Weight Change in Patients Undergoing RYGB and Nonsurgical Matches
Patients undergoing RYGB lost an estimated 31.0% (95% CI, 30.4%-31.6%) of their 
baseline weight at 1 year (Figure 1), whereas nonsurgical matches lost 1.1% (95% CI, 
0.7%-1.6%) of their baseline weight at 1 year. Thus, patients undergoing RYGB lost 29.9% 
(95% CI, 29.3%-30.5%) more of their baseline weight at 1 year than nonsurgical matches, 
and this difference remained clinically significant at 26.9% (95% CI, 24.7%-29.1%) at year 
3, 24.0% (95% CI, 19.9%-28.1%) at year 5, and 22.2% (95% CI, 16.0%-28.5%) in year 7. 
At year 10, patients undergoing RYGB had maintained significantly greater weight loss 
(21.3%; 95% CI, 11.4%-31.1%) than nonsurgical matches. Patients undergoing RYGB lost 
28.6% (95% CI, 19.5%-37.6%) of their baseline weight at 10 years, whereas nonsurgical 
matches lost 7.3% (95% CI, 1.4%-13.3%) of their baseline weight at 10 years.
Among patients undergoing RYGB with a 10-year weight (n = 564), mean weight loss from 
baseline was 41.3 kg, and mean excess body weight loss from baseline was 56.4%. Mean 
weight loss for nonsurgical matches with a 10-year weight (n = 1247) was 6.3 kg, and mean 
excess body weight loss was 7.7%. At 10 years, 405 of 564 patients undergoing RYGB 
(71.8%) maintained weight loss of more than an estimated 20% of their baseline weight, and 
224 of 564 (39.7%) maintained more than an estimated 30% weight loss (Figure 2). Only 19 
of 564 patients undergoing RYGB (3.4%) were within 5% of their original baseline weight 
at 10 years compared with 692 of 1247 nonsurgical matches (55.5%).
Differences in Patient Characteristics Across Procedures
The RYGB, SG, and AGB subgroups of surgical patients were different in several respects 
(Table). Patients undergoing SG were older, less likely to be married, and more likely to be 
male or have diagnosed diabetes than the patients undergoing RYGB or AGB. Patients 
undergoing RYGB were more likely to be superobese or white than the patients undergoing 
SG or AGB. There was also significant regional variation in surgical procedures being 
performed, with 173 of 246 AGBs (70.3%) performed in 3 regions compared with only 112 
of 379 SG cases (29.5%) and 475 of 1787 RYGB cases (25.6%) in those regions.
Trends in Postsurgical Body Weight by Procedure
Patients undergoing RYGB experienced the greatest weight loss in each year of the 4-year 
follow-up. Patients undergoing SG experienced less weight loss, and patients undergoing 
AGB lost the least weight (Figure 3). At 1 year, patients undergoing RYGB lost 30.9% of 
their baseline weight (95% CI, 30.2%-31.6%), patients undergoing AGB lost 13.0% (95%

 CI, 11.1%-14.9%), and patients undergoing SG lost 23.4% (95% CI, 21.8%-24.7%). Patients 
undergoing RYGB lost 17.9% (95% CI, 15.9%-19.9%) more of their baseline weight at 1 
year than patients undergoing AGB and 7.6% (95% CI, 5.9%-9.2%) more than patients 
undergoing SG. At 4 years, patients undergoing RYGB lost 27.5% of their baseline weight 
(95% CI, 23.8%-31.2%), patients undergoing AGB lost 10.6% (95% CI, 0.6%-20.6%), and 
patients undergoing SG lost 17.8% (95% CI, 9.7%-25.9%). Patients undergoing RYGB had 
lost 16.9% (95% CI, 6.2%-27.6%) more of their baseline weight at 4 years than patients 
undergoing AGB and 9.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-18.6%) more than patients undergoing SG.
Among patients with a 4-year weight, mean weight loss from baseline was 41.0 kg for 
patients undergoing RYGB (n = 1431), 15.4 kg for patients undergoing AGB (n = 200), and 
25.3 kg for patients undergoing SG (n = 178). The mean (SD) excess body weight loss at 4 
years from baseline was 28.6% (30.5%) for patients undergoing AGB, 43.0% (28.1%) for 
patients undergoing SG, and 60.0% (26.1%) for patients undergoing RYGB. A greater 
proportion of patients undergoing RYGB lost an estimated 20% or more and 30% or more of 
their baseline weight in years 1 to 4 than patients undergoing SG or AGB (Figure 4). A 
greater proportion of patients undergoing AGB lost less than 5% of their baseline weight at 4 
years than patients undergoing SG and RYGB (61 of 200 [30.5%] vs 26 of 178 [14.6%] vs 
35 of 1431 [2.5%]).
Discussion
In this study, we address an evidence gap about long-term weight change associated with 
current bariatric procedures using a large multisite cohort of veterans in the United States 
with excellent follow-up. We found that patients undergoing RYGB were able to sustain 
significantly greater weight loss than nonsurgical matches up to 10 years after surgery. The 
nonsurgical matches experienced modest weight loss, most likely because of age-related 
changes. A total of 405 patients undergoing RYGB (71.8%) maintained 20% or greater 
weight loss at 10 years, which is similar to the 34 patients undergoing RYGB (73%) in the 
Swedish Obese Subjects study.19 In contrast to the Swedish Obese Subjects study, our 
follow-up rate for 10-year weight measures was substantially higher (81.9% vs 66.0% of 
those eligible).
In the only other long-term controlled study of patients undergoing RYGB in the United 
States with a high follow-up rate (96%), Adams and colleagues21 reported that 76% of 
patients undergoing RYGB sustained 20% or greater weight loss at 6 years, which is 
consistent with our results. We also found that 224 of 564 patients undergoing RYGB 
(39.7%) maintained a 30% or greater weight loss at 10 years, which is comparable to the 
41% of patients in the study by Adams et al21 who maintained greater than 30% weight loss 
at 6 years. Furthermore, we found that only 19 of 564 patients undergoing RYGB (3.4%) 
had regained weight back to within 5% of their original baseline weight at 10 years, 
demonstrating that the long-term failure rate of RYGB is very low. These findings provide 
additional strong evidence for durable long-term weight loss among patients undergoing 
RYGB.

 Sleeve gastrectomy is a relatively new procedure, so we were not able to evaluate outcomes 
for SG for the full 10-year study duration because there was only a high degree of follow-up 
for 4 years. For the 4 years after the initial operation, patients undergoing RYGB had the 
largest weight loss with somewhat smaller weight loss observed for patients undergoing SG 
and even less for patients undergoing AGB. These observations are consistent with previous 
studies1,17,18,20 of shorter-term (1-3 years) bariatric surgery weight loss. Significant weight 
regain was rare for patients undergoing RYGB. Nearly 1 in 3 patients undergoing AGB (61 
of 200 [30.5%) regained all their lost weight (within 5% of baseline) by 4 years after 
surgery, whereas 26 of 178 patients undergoing SG (14.6%) and only 35 of 1431 patients 
undergoing RYGB (2.5%) experienced this degree of weight regain. Patients who regain 
weight may still have better long-term health outcomes than patients who never lost 
significant weight, but weight regain is one reason why the AGB procedure has fallen out of 
favor in recent years.25
Head-to-head comparisons of surgical procedures with long-term follow-up are important to 
inform procedure selection by patients and surgeons because, to our knowledge, only 3 
large, multisite, US-based studies13,16,21 have been published comparing weight change with 
more than 2 years of follow-up. Because of the recent introduction of SG, long-term 
outcome data for the safety and durability of SG procedures are lacking. This is a critical 
evidence gap, given that SG is now the most commonly performed procedure in the United 
States (51.7% of all procedures in 2014).25
More evidence is needed on postsurgical complications, disease resolution, and long-term 
mental health outcomes to help surgical candidates choose the procedure that is best for 
them. Engaging patients in a high-quality shared decision-making33 conversation about their 
weight loss treatment options (including no treatment) is critical because prior studies34-36 
have found that patients have unrealistic expectations of the weight loss that bariatric surgery 
will help them achieve. Untreated severely obese patients are unlikely to achieve significant 
weight loss, although the nonsurgical matches in our study experienced modest weight loss, 
most likely because of age-related changes.
This study has several limitations. First, patients were not randomized, risking unobserved 
confounding that persisted after matched comparisons. Second, nonsurgical matches did not 
receive formal weight loss treatment, but it is possible that a small subset participated in the 
VA's MOVE! program. However, national MOVE! participation and mean weight loss 
among participants have been low,37 so possible inclusion of MOVE! participants in our 
study is unlikely to have biased our outcomes estimates. Third, comorbid health conditions 
of the Diagnostic Cost Group score were identified using International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes, which can be inaccurate and do not account for 
disease severity. Fourth, there may be bias attributable to loss to follow-up. Fifth, weight 
data were not systematically and routinely collected as part of a prospective data collection 
effort as in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery,12 so weights at specific time 
points were model-estimated predictions.
This study also has several important strengths, including having a high 10-year follow-up 
rate (81.9% for surgical patients and 67.4% for controls), a high degree of generalizability

 because we included outcomes from many different surgeons across multiple sites, inclusion 
of carefully matched nonsurgical controls, and direct comparison of the 3 most common 
surgical procedures currently performed. Our results are consistent with the only other long-
term observational study with a control population (Swedish Obese Subjects study) and with 
shorter-term comparative studies of weight change after RYGB, AGB, and SG 
procedures.17,38 Finally, this study provides evidence of long-term weight loss after bariatric 
surgery for older men for whom evidence is sparse because all prior studies6-13 were 
predominantly composed of women in their 40s.
Conclusions
Among obese patients receiving care in the VA health care system, veterans who underwent 
RYGB lost much more weight than nonsurgical matches and were able to sustain most of 
this weight loss in the long term. We found that RYGB induced significantly more weight 
loss at 4 years than SG or AGB. These results provide further evidence for the beneficial 
association between surgery and long-term weight loss that has been demonstrated in 
shorter-term studies of younger, predominantly female populations.

 Key Points
Questions How much weight loss can be expected on average 10 years after undergoing 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and how does weight loss 4 years after bariatric 
surgery compare among patients undergoing RYGB, adjustable gastric banding, and 
sleeve gastrectomy?
Findings In this cohort study, patients undergoing RYGB lost 21% more of their baseline 
weight than matched nonsurgical patients at 10 years, and RYGB induced significantly 
greater weight loss than sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding at 4 years.
Meaning Bariatric surgery, especially RYGB, is effective at promoting long-term weight 
loss among obese patients.

 Figure 1. Differences in Estimated Weight Changes Among Patients Undergoing Roux-en-Y 
Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Nonsurgical Matches
Estimated values, differences, and 95% CIs (shown in parentheses) were generated from a 
penalized spline mixed-effects model (7092 patients: 5305 nonsurgical matches and 1787 
patients undergoing RYGB). Numbers and arrows in the center of the figure represent the 
differences and 95% CIs of the differences between nonsurgical matches and patients 
undergoing RYGB at years 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The sample for whom there was follow-up 
weight data for each year are as follows: year 1, n = 6894 patients (5131 nonsurgical 
matches and 1763 patients undergoing RYGB); year 3, n = 6301 (4629 nonsurgical matches 
and 1672 patients undergoing RYGB); year 5, n = 5172 (3748 nonsurgical matches and 1424 
patients undergoing RYGB); year 7, n = 3942 (2806 nonsurgical matches and 1136 patients 
undergoing RYGB); and year 10, n = 1847 (1274 nonsurgical matches and 573 patients

aData are presented as number (percentage) of study participants unless otherwise indicated. Sample sizes reflect surgical patients and nonsurgical 
matches who are still alive at 1 year of follow-up. In addition, matches who underwent bariatric surgery within 1 year of follow-up are excluded. A 
total of 1787 patients underwent RYGB in the case vs match analysis, but only 1785 patients underwent RYGB in the surgical procedures analysis 
because 2 of these patients only had observed weights at more than 5 years after surgery.
bAll diagnoses were identified from inpatient and outpatient visit records using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes.
