abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, no studies have examined vocabulary outcomes of 
children meeting all 3 components of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention 
(EHDI) guidelines (hearing screening by 1 month, diagnosis of hearing loss by 3 months, 
and intervention by 6 months of age). The primary purpose of the current study was to 
examine the impact of the current EHDI 1-3-6 policy on vocabulary outcomes across a 
wide geographic area. A secondary goal was to confirm the impact of other demographic 
variables previously reported to be related to language outcomes.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 448 children with bilateral hearing loss 
between 8 and 39 months of age (mean = 25.3 months, SD = 7.5 months). The children lived 
in 12 different states and were participating in the National Early Childhood Assessment 
Project.
RESULTS: The combination of 6 factors in a regression analysis accounted for 41% of the 
variance in vocabulary outcomes. Vocabulary quotients were significantly higher for 
children who met the EHDI guidelines, were younger, had no additional disabilities, had 
mild to moderate hearing loss, had parents who were deaf or hard of hearing, and had 
mothers with higher levels of education.
CONCLUSIONS: Vocabulary learning may be enhanced with system improvements that 
increase the number of children meeting the current early identification and intervention 
guidelines. In addition, intervention efforts need to focus on preventing widening delays 
with chronological age, assisting mothers with lower levels of education, and incorporating 
adults who are deaf/hard-of-hearing in the intervention process.

Significant delays in language 
acquisition are consistently reported 
for children who are deaf or hard 
of hearing.1 
– 
3 Universal newborn 
hearing screening (UNHS) and 
programs based on the Early Hearing 
Detection and Intervention (EHDI) 
guidelines were established in the 
United States to expedite diagnosis 
and treatment of hearing loss with 
the hope of mitigating these delays. 
The Joint Committee on Infant 
Hearing has recommended universal 
hearing screening by 1 month of 
age, diagnosis of hearing loss by 3 
months of age, and enrollment in 
early intervention by 6 months of 
age.4 These recommendations are 
commonly referred to as the EHDI 
1-3-6 guidelines.
Recent epidemiologic cohort 
studies conducted in England and 
Australia have reported better 
language outcomes for children 
born in areas of the country or 
during years in which UNHS had 
been implemented compared with 
cohorts of children born before 
UNHS, 
5, 
 
6 with long-term benefits 
in reading ability also reported.7 
Comparing a group screened at 
birth with those who received a 
behavioral screen at 9 months of 
age, researchers in the Netherlands 
reported better scores on a quality-
of-life measure for the UNHS group 
but no significant group differences 
in language outcomes.8 This may be 
because the UNHS group received 
amplification at the relatively late 
mean age of 15.7 months. In the 
United States, researchers have 
reported more favorable language 
outcomes for children whose hearing 
loss was identified earlier, 
9 who 
received hearing aids earlier, 
3 or 
who began intervention services at 
an earlier age.10, 
 
11 Collectively, the 
majority of previous research has 
supported the beneficial effects of 
early identification and intervention. 
However, many of these studies 
were conducted within a restricted 
geographic area and/or included an 
age of confirmation of hearing loss 
within the “early” group that was 
relatively late by today’s standards, 
and in all studies, grouping was 
based on only a single component 
of the EHDI program (screening, 
identification, or intervention).
To date, no studies have reported 
vocabulary or other language 
outcomes of children meeting all 3 
components of the EHDI guidelines. 
The primary purpose of this study 
was to examine the impact of the 
current EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines on 
vocabulary outcomes across a wide 
geographic area. A secondary goal 
was to confirm the impact of other 
demographic variables (chronological 
age, additional disabilities, degree 
of hearing loss, presence of an adult 
who is deaf or hard of hearing in 
the home, and mother’s level of 
education) previously reported to be 
related to language outcomes.
MeThODs
Participants
This was a cross-sectional study 
of 448 children with bilateral, 
prelingual hearing loss between 
8 and 39 months of age (mean = 
25.3 months, SD = 7.5 months). All 
of the children were participating 
in the National Early Childhood 
Assessment Project (NECAP). 
This project, supported by the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, is a multistate effort to 
examine developmental outcomes 
of young children with hearing loss. 
Participants lived in 12 different 
states (see Table 1).
Participants included children with 
(18%) and without (82%) additional 
disabilities judged by their parents 
and/or early interventionists 
to interfere with speech and/or 
language development. Cognitive 
impairment was reported in 58% of 
those who had additional disabilities 
(see Table 2). The primary written 
language used in the home was 
English (88%) or Spanish (12%). The 
communication modes used with the 
children and additional demographic 
characteristics are summarized in 
 
Table 3.
Information regarding hearing loss 
(onset, degree, and amplification) 
is presented in Table 4. Preliminary 
analyses found that independent 
variable effects were significantly 
different for children with auditory 
neuropathy spectrum disorder 
(ANSD) compared with those without 
ANSD. The small number of children 
with ANSD (n = 26) prevented 
adequately exploring or controlling 
for these differences, so these 
children were not included in this 
study.
The participants’ hearing loss 
was confirmed through diagnostic 
audiologic testing at a mean age 
of 4.1 months. All children were 
enrolled in an early intervention 
program (mean age of enrollment =  
7.0 months). Slightly over half  
of the participants (58%) met the

1-3-6 guidelines. Of the 258 children 
who met the 1-3-6 guidelines, 58% 
also met a stricter 1-2-3 criteria 
(screening by 1 month of age, 
identification by 2 months of age, and 
intervention by 3 months of age).
All of the children participating in 
the NECAP who met the participant 
criteria are included in the study. 
Although it is unknown to what 
extent the eligible population of 
each participating intervention 
program were invited and agreed 
to participate in the NECAP, the 
demographics of this sample are 
consistent with the Gallaudet 
Research Institute national survey of 
37 828 students who are deaf or hard 
of hearing in terms of sex, ethnicity, 
primary language at home, degree of 
hearing loss, type of amplification, 
and communication mode used 
by the family.12 Compared with 
the Gallaudet results, this sample 
included a smaller percentage of 
children who were African American 
(5% vs 16%), a higher percentage of 
children who had a parent who was 
deaf and/or hard of hearing (17% 
vs 9%), and a smaller percentage of 
children with additional disabilities 
(18% vs 39%). This is not surprising 
because, initially, only children 
without additional disabilities 
were included in the current study. 
Additionally, the Gallaudet national 
survey included students through 
12th grade, allowing more time 
for additional special needs to be 
identified.
This project was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board at the 
University of Colorado Boulder. All 
families provided written informed 
consent.
Procedures
The participants’ expressive 
vocabulary was measured by using 
the MacArthur-Bates Communicative 
Development Inventories.13 This 
norm-referenced assessment has  
been extensively validated with 
typically developing children14, 
 
15  
as well as those with a variety of 
different disabilities, 
16, 
17 including 
hearing loss.18, 
 
19 Families in which 
the language of the home was Spanish 
completed the Spanish version of this 
instrument.20 Expressive vocabulary 
ability was selected as the dependent 
variable because vocabulary size and 
rate of word learning are important 
predictors of later language and 
academic skills.21,

In keeping with the administration 
instructions in the test manual for 
populations with language delays, the 
level of the inventory administered 
(Words and Gestures versus Words 
and Sentences) was determined on 
the basis of the interventionists’ 
and/or caregivers’ estimate of 
the child’s vocabulary size rather 
than chronological age.13 For the 
participants in all but 1 state, the 
appropriate MacArthur-Bates 
inventory was given to the family 
by their early interventionist. In the 
remaining state, the inventory was 
mailed to the family’s home. The 
MacArthur-Bates Communicative 
Development Inventories list a 
variety of early-developing words 
arranged in different semantic 
categories. The child’s primary 
caregiver was instructed to mark 
all of the words that his or her child 
produced spontaneously in spoken 
and/or sign language. The form was 
then reviewed by the child’s early 
interventionist for completeness and 
accuracy and sent to the NECAP staff 
for scoring.
Scoring of all assessments was 
completed by 1 person and checked 
by a second person. Disagreements in 
scoring were corrected by consensus. 
Total raw scores were calculated by 
counting the number of words a child 
produced regardless of modality 
(spoken or signed). Raw scores were 
converted to vocabulary age scores 
by using the procedure described 
in the test manual. To examine 
each participant’s expressive 
vocabulary age score relative to his 
or her chronological age, vocabulary 
quotients (VQs) were calculated by 
dividing the child’s vocabulary age 
by his or her chronological age and 
multiplying by 100. A VQ of 100 
indicated that a child’s vocabulary 
age was commensurate with his or 
her chronological age.
All families and/or their 
interventionist completed a 
demographic form, which included 
information such as the caregivers’ 
level of education. Audiologic records 
were used to determine the degree 
of hearing loss. For data analysis, 
the participants’ demographic 
characteristics were categorized as 
detailed in Table 5.
ResuLTs
The mean VQ for the 448 children 
was 74.4 (SD = 20.3). When 
considering the 367 children with 
no additional disabilities, the mean 
VQ was 77.6 (SD = 19.7). For the 
81 participants with additional 
disabilities, the mean was 59.8 (SD = 
15.6).
To explore the relationships 
between vocabulary ability and the 
demographic variables, Pearson 
product-moment correlations were 
computed. As detailed in Table 6, 
there was no significant relationship 
between VQ and sex or between 
VQ and language of the home 
(Spanish versus English). Significant 
correlations were obtained between 
VQs and the remaining demographic 
variables.
Multiple linear regression analysis 
was used to identify predictors of 
variance in the participants’ VQs. 
Sex and language of the home were 
initially included in the model 
to confirm that they were not 
significantly related to VQs when 
controlling for other demographic 
factors. These variables remained 
nonsignificant and were removed 
from the final model. The primary

independent variable was whether 
the child met all 3 components of the 
EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines. Five additional 
independent variables were entered 
into the regression equation to 
explore and control for other factors 
known from previous research to be 
related to vocabulary outcomes. The 
overall model was significant (F6, 
441 =  
51.0, P < .0005) and explained 41% 
of the variance in the children’s 
expressive vocabulary abilities (see 
Table 7). All 6 predictor variables 
made a significant, independent 
contribution to the model.
On the basis of the results of the 
regression, and as shown in Fig 1, 
mean VQs were shown to decrease 
as chronological age increased. 
Although absolute vocabulary size 
increased with participant age, the 
gap between chronological and 
vocabulary age was greater for older 
children, resulting in lower VQs.
Higher VQs were predicted by the 
absence of additional disabilities, 
higher maternal level of education, 
lesser degrees of hearing loss, and 
the presence of a parent who was 
deaf and/or hard of hearing in the 
home. Even when controlling for 
these factors, meeting EHDI 1-3-6 
guidelines was a significant predictor 
of vocabulary outcomes. The 
standardized β weight of .16 indicates 
that meeting EHDI guidelines had 
a meaningful impact on vocabulary 
outcomes in addition to being 
statistically significant. In comparing 
the children who met the EHDI 
guidelines to those who did not, there 
was a 12-point difference in mean 
VQ. Mean VQ comparisons across all 
of the independent predictors are 
presented in Fig 2.
To determine if the impact of meeting 
EHDI guidelines had a differential 
effect across various demographic 
subgroups, 5 interaction terms 
(meets EHDI × each of the remaining 
5 independent variables) were 
created and evaluated within 
separate regression models that 
retained all 6 of the main effect 
variables. In all cases, the main

effects remained significant, and the 
interaction term was not significant 
(P > .05). Thus, it appears that the 
benefits of meeting EHDI guidelines 
in terms of vocabulary outcomes 
are consistent across children 
with a wide range of demographic 
characteristics. Although there was 
no significant interaction between 
EHDI and disability status, to 
examine vocabulary performance 
in children with hearing loss 
without additional disabilities, mean 
comparisons across the different 
independent variables are presented 
for this no-additional-disabilities 
subgroup in Fig 3.
To examine possible differences 
among children who did not meet the 
EHDI guidelines, participants were 
divided into 4 groups: (1) meets both 
the identification and intervention 
criteria, (2) meets identification by  
3 months but not intervention by  
6 months, (3) meets intervention  
by 6 months but not identification by  
3 months, and (4) does not meet 
either criteria. A one-way analysis  
of variance was conducted with  
VQ as the dependent variable and 
EHDI category as the independent 
and/or grouping variable.  The main 
effect was significant (F3, 
437 =  
11.26, P < .0005).  The results of 
Scheffe post hoc tests revealed the 
group that met all EHDI criteria 
performed significantly better than 
the other 3 groups (P < .05 across 
all comparisons).  There was no 
significant difference in any of the 
post hoc pairwise comparisons 
among the remaining 3 groups (P = 
.94 to .99). See Table 8 for means and 
SDs of the 4 groups.
DIscussIOn
This large, multistate study is 
the first to explore the benefits 
of meeting all 3 components of 
the EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines on the 
vocabulary outcomes of children with 
bilateral hearing loss. Higher VQs 
were associated with meeting EHDI 
guidelines even when controlling for 
a variety of other factors previously 
reported to impact language 
development. The lack of significant 
interactions indicated that the 
benefits of meeting the guidelines 
were consistent across a variety of 
demographic subgroups.
Despite the benefits for children who 
met the EHDI guidelines, the mean 
VQ of children without additional 
disabilities who met EHDI guidelines 
was 82, considerably less than the 
expected mean of 100. Particularly 
concerning is that 37% of this 
subgroup had VQs <75 (ie, below 
the 10th percentile). Although this 
percentage is substantially better 
than for those who did not meet EHDI 
guidelines (64% without additional 
disabilities had VQs <75), it points 
to the importance of identifying 
additional factors that may lead to 
improved vocabulary outcomes.
The percentage of children in the 
“meets EHDI” group who fell below 
the 10th percentile is similar to that 
reported by Vohr et al, 
10 who also used 
the MacArthur-Bates Communicative 
Development Inventory (43% of their 
early-identified 18- to 24-month-
olds fell below the 10th percentile). 
Several studies have used the Child 
Development Inventory to measure 
the language skills of children with 
hearing loss.8, 
 
9, 
 
23 Direct comparisons 
with these studies cannot be drawn 
given that the Child Development 
Inventory yields substantially higher 
scores in children who are deaf or hard 
of hearing than the MacArthur-Bates

Communicative Development 
Inventory (on average by 11 quotient 
points).24
The variables in this study associated 
with higher VQs are consistent with 
previous reports that found better 
vocabulary and other language 
outcomes to be related to the  
absence of additional disabilities, 
25  
lesser degrees of hearing loss, 
3, 
 
10, 
 
26  
the presence of a parent who is 
deaf or hard of hearing, 
26, 
 
27 and 
higher maternal education.28 The 
association of lower VQs with 
increasing chronological age 
complements previous findings that, 
even when early-identified, children 
with hearing loss fail to match the 
vocabulary acquisition trajectory of 
children who are hearing.10, 
 
29, 
30 This 
suggests that many children with 
hearing loss fail to keep pace with the 
exponentially increasing vocabulary 
growth demonstrated by hearing 
children as they move beyond 18 
months of age (ie, from producing an 
average of 9 new words per month to 
40 words per month).13
Comparing children without 
additional disabilities who were 
younger than and older than 24 
months of age revealed a 19-point 
difference in their mean VQs 
(younger group = 88.9; older 
group = 69.9). This significant drop 
is important to consider when 
describing the vocabulary abilities 
of children between birth and 3 
years of age. Specifically, mean 
scores may be misleading because 
they are likely to underrepresent 
the abilities of younger children and 
overrepresent the abilities of older 
children. The low mean VQ of older 
children is concerning. This mean 
is well below the 10th percentile, 
indicating a significant risk for 
continued, substantial language 
delays. Awareness of the magnitude 
of typical growth is critical when 
setting early intervention goals for 
young children with hearing loss, 
and studies exploring strategies to 
increase the effectiveness of early 
intervention are needed.
One such strategy that warrants 
further investigation is how to 
most effectively include adults who 
are deaf or hard of hearing in the 
intervention process. This strategy 
is supported by the finding that 
better vocabulary outcomes were 
apparent in children for whom one 
or both parents were deaf or hard 
of hearing. Although this finding 
may be due in part to a quicker 
emotional adjustment to having a 
child with hearing loss and, for those 
parents who used sign language, to 
a fluent command of the language, 
it is also likely that these parents 
(who included both those who did 
and did not use sign language) have 
firsthand knowledge of effective 
communication strategies that can 
maximize vocabulary acquisition.

acquisition is an additional area 
that warrants future exploration. 
Given that families may change 
their communication approach over 
time and, if they choose to use sign 
language, are likely to vary in the 
extent and fluency with which sign 
language is used over time, this 
question is best explored in future 
research through a longitudinal 
design.
A limitation of this study is that 
only a single aspect of language was 
examined: expressive vocabulary. 
Future studies should consider 
additional components of language, 
including comprehension, syntax, and 
pragmatics. A second limitation is 
that disability status was determined 
by parent and/or interventionist 
report. It is likely that some children 
in the “no disability” group actually 
had an additional disability that 
was not yet apparent to their 
parent and/or interventionist. A 
further limitation is the potential 
for selection bias. Because of the 
nature of the data collection process, 
it was not possible to compare 
children and/or families who chose 
to participate in the study with those 
who declined. However, given the 
close correspondence between the 
characteristics of the present sample 
and the results of the Gallaudet 
Research Institute survey, 
12 this 
sample appears to be representative 
of the population of children living 
in the United States who are deaf or 
hard of hearing.

The results of this study underscore 
the importance of current efforts 
to decrease the age at which 
children are identified with 
hearing loss and enrolled in early 
intervention. Given that, across the 
participating states, only one-half 
to two-thirds of children met the 
EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines, much work 
still needs to be done to ensure 
that all children are screened by 
1 month of age, diagnosed with 
hearing loss by 3 months of age, 
and enrolled in intervention by 
6 months of age. This requires 
a team approach that includes 
newborn screening personnel, 
audiologists, early interventionists, 
and state-based EHDI surveillance 
programs that monitor and facilitate 
timely transition from screening 
to diagnosis to intervention. 
Pediatricians and other pediatric 
medical professionals are critical 
members of this team. Parents look to 
their child’s primary care providers 
for advice, and these professionals 
have the ability to motivate 
families whose children have not 
passed a hearing screen to seek 
timely assessment of their child’s 
hearing and prompt enrollment in 
intervention when hearing loss is 
confirmed.
The independent variables in the 
current study explained only 41% of 
the variance in vocabulary outcomes. 
Given that a substantial proportion 
of the children performed below 
the average range, understanding 
additional factors that influence 
vocabulary development is critical. 
Future studies should examine 
variables such as family involvement, 
parent–child interaction, compliance 
with amplification use, intensity 
of intervention services, and 
characteristics of early intervention 
providers and programs. In addition, 
examining factors that influence 
vocabulary acquisition rates within 
a longitudinal design may provide 
additional information that can support 
improved outcomes for children who 
are deaf or hard of hearing.
