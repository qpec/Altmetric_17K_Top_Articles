Abstract
Background: Maternal metabolism during pregnancy is a major determinant of the intra-uterine environment
and fetal outcomes. Herein, we characterize the maternal urinary metabolome throughout pregnancy to identify
maternal metabolic signatures of fetal growth in two subcohorts and explain potential sources of variation in
metabolic profiles based on lifestyle and clinical data.
Methods: We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize maternal urine samples
collected in the INMA birth cohort at the first (n = 412 and n = 394, respectively, in Gipuzkoa and Sabadell cohorts)
and third trimesters of gestation (n = 417 and 469). Metabolic phenotypes that reflected longitudinal intra- and
inter-individual variation were used to predict measures of fetal growth and birth weight.
Results: A metabolic shift between the first and third trimesters of gestation was characterized by 1H NMR signals
arising predominantly from steroid by-products. We identified 10 significant and reproducible metabolic associations
in the third trimester with estimated fetal, birth, and placental weight in two independent subcohorts. These included
branched-chain amino acids; isoleucine, valine, leucine, alanine and 3 hydroxyisobutyrate (metabolite of valine), which
were associated with a significant fetal weight increase at week 34 of up to 2.4% in Gipuzkoa (P < 0.005) and 1% in
Sabadell (P < 0.05). Other metabolites included pregnancy-related hormone by-products of estrogens and
progesterone, and the methyl donor choline. We could explain a total of 48–53% of
the total variance in birth weight of which urine metabolites had an independent predictive power of 12% adjusting
for all other lifestyle/clinical factors. First trimester metabolic phenotypes could not predict reproducibly weight at later
stages of development. Physical activity, as well as other modifiable lifestyle/clinical factors, such as coffee
consumption, vitamin D intake, and smoking, were identified as potential sources of metabolic variation
during pregnancy.
Conclusions: Significant reproducible maternal urinary metabolic signatures of fetal growth and birth
weight are identified for the first time and linked to modifiable lifestyle factors. This novel approach to
prenatal screening, combining multiple risk factors, present a great opportunity to personalize pregnancy
management and reduce newborn disease risk in later life.

 Background
Fetal growth restriction (FGR) or excessive growth (macro-
somia) affect 15% and 10% of all pregnancies, respectively
[1, 2]. Beyond consequences at birth, abnormal fetal
growth and birth weight are associated with adverse health
risks in later life, for example, the development of obesity
and type 2 diabetes [3, 4]. Identifying women at risk early
in pregnancy has been the focus of recent prenatal care ini-
tiatives, based on maternal lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking,
BMI, and diet), medical history, and a panel of serum bio-
markers [5]. However, none of these methods provide high
enough accuracy to detect fetal growth aberrations [6].
Exploratory
metabolic
profiling
offers
a
powerful
means of capturing systems-level information that re-
flects both maternal genetic and environmental influ-
ences, hence helping to elucidate metabolic disturbances
and pathways associated with fetal outcomes [7–9]. Our
recent work demonstrated the value of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopic-based metabolic profil-
ing in detecting early urinary markers (at approximately
11 weeks of gestation) of preterm birth and FGR in a
nested case–control study [10]. However, longitudinal,
larger-scale studies with detailed data on maternal envir-
onment, lifestyle, and medical history to characterize dif-
ferential metabolic status during pregnancy are needed
to identify translatable biomarkers of FGR. A recent
study of healthy pregnancy with urine and blood sam-
ples at multiple time points of gestation has provided
great insights into the changing pregnancy metabolome
through the use of untargeted NMR [11].
To our knowledge, the present study represents the
largest human investigation (with a total of 1695 meta-
bolic phenotypes generated) in which metabolic profiling
of maternal samples has been used to understand the pro-
gression of normal fetal growth. This study aimed to (1)
characterize the maternal urinary metabolome throughout
pregnancy, (2) identify maternal metabolic signatures of
fetal growth in two subcohorts, (3) explain potential
sources of variation in metabolic profiles based on lifestyle
and clinical data, and finally (4) to determine the individ-
ual importance of metabolic signatures versus other
maternal factors on birth weight.
Methods
Study population
INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) is a birth cohort
study in seven regions of Spain that aims to examine the
role of environmental pollutants in relation to child
growth and development. All participants were singleton
live-born infants from two INMA subcohorts located in
Gipuzkoa (Basque Country) and Sabadell (Catalonia) [12].
The women were interviewed twice during pregnancy (in
the first and third trimesters of gestation) to obtain infor-
mation about their sociodemographic characteristics and
lifestyle variables. The urine samples were collected in the
same interview in the morning (spot samples). Urine was
collected in 100 mL polyethylene containers and stored at
−20 °C. One aliquot of the sample from each of the
participants was sent to the laboratories of the Depart-
ment of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London,
UK, to be analyzed. NMR spectra of urine were generated
from 412 and 417 subjects for the first and third trimes-
ters, respectively (12.4 ± 1.2 and 33.9 ± 1.3 weeks, respect-
ively) in Gipuzkoa and from 394 and 469 subjects for
Sabadell (Fig. 1). The INMA project was approved by
the Ethical Committees of the participating centres, and

 all subjects gave written consent at enrolment and
delivery.
Definition of the fetal and birth measurements
Fetal growth scores or standard deviation scores (z-
scores)
were
obtained
using
longitudinal
growth
curves calculated for each individual adjusting for
constitutional factors known to affect fetal growth
(i.e.,
maternal
age,
height,
parity,
pre-pregnancy
weight, country of origin, father’s height, and fetal
sex). Unconditional z-scores at a certain time point
describe the size of a fetus at this time and condi-
tional z-scores describe the growth of a fetus during
the respective time interval, i.e., at 12–20, 20–34, and
12–34
weeks
of
gestation
[13].
Anthropometric
measures at birth included body weight and placental
weight and were scaled to z-scores by subtracting the
mean and dividing by the standard deviation. For

Metabolic profiling by NMR
Urinary metabolic profiles were generated using 1H NMR
spectroscopy (Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods)
[14]. Fully resolved spectral data corrected for different
dilution in spot urine samples (probabilistic quotient
normalization) were used to model metabolic variation
across the two time points of pregnancy whereas the
prediction of fetal growth measures was based on 64
semi-quantified metabolites after manual spectral binning.
These metabolites, represented by spectral integrals of
single representative resonances, were selected on the
basis of being present in a high proportion of the
spectra, having a high signal-to-noise ratio, and exhi-
biting limited overlap with other resonances. A list of
the 64 metabolites (of which 47 were fully identi-
fied), their integration window, their metabolic clus-
ters, and details on assignments are presented in
Additional file 2: Table S1. Metabolite correlation clusters
were created using the complete linkage method for hier-
archical clustering in order to present metabolite-
outcome associations according to urinary metabolite
clusters (heatmaps shown in Additional file 3: Figure S1,
Additional file 4: Figure S2, Additional file 5: Figure S3, and
Additional file 6: Figure S4). Metabolite inter-correlation
heatmaps were also used to ensure that selected reso-
nances
from
unassigned
metabolites
arise
from
unique metabolites (i.e., no consistent patterns across
unassigned metabolites across the two cohorts and
time points).
Statistical analysis
Step 1. Identify main sources of metabolic variation
between first and third trimesters of gestation
Metabolic profiles, as digitized spectra, were subjected
to exploratory analysis where multivariate projection
methods such as principal component analysis (PCA)
provided an overview of the data and helped identify the
main sources of biological and technical variation and
potential outliers. Differences between first and third
trimester samples were further explored through the
application of orthogonal-partial least squares discrimin-
atory analysis (O-PLS-DA). In order to avoid over-fitting
the data, a 7-fold cross-validation was used and statis-
tical parameters (R2Y and Q2Y representing the good-
ness of fit and predictive ability) were calculated. All
multivariate statistical analyses were performed using
MATLAB.
Step 2. Identify metabolites associated with fetal growth
For each metabolite in each subcohort, multivariate
linear regression analysis was performed to estimate
metabolite-fetal growth associations whilst controlling
for the time of sampling. Each metabolite integral was
log-transformed (log base 10) and modelled separately.
Coefficients from the regression models were multiplied
by the logarithm of 1.5 to derive an effect estimate
for a 50% increase in metabolite levels [15]. Regres-
sion coefficients are presented as a percent of change
in the z-score of each fetal growth measure.
Step 3. Assess the extent to which the metabolite panel
associated with fetal growth can be explained by known
growth-related factors from epidemiological and clinical data
We considered the following growth-related parameters:
maternal clinical parameters, maternal lifestyle in third
trimester, dietary intake in third trimester and sociode-
mographic characteristics of both parents, all of which
have been previously reported to be strongly associated
with birth weight (38 parameters selected, full details in
Additional file 7: Table S2). Pairwise spearman correl-
ation among metabolites and maternal parameters are
represented as circos plots, where each line/link is repre-
sented only for correlations with an adjusted P value
under 0.05 (P adjusted for by FDR using the function
“P-adjust” in R). In addition, correlation adjusted scores
(CAR scores) were used to measure the correlation be-
tween
metabolite
levels
and
all
the
Mahalanobis-
decorrelated predictors in one model (growth-related
factors selected from epidemiological and clinical data) as
implemented in the R-package ‘care’ [16]. The correlation
shrinkage intensity lambda was 0, i.e., we basically used
the empirical correlation structure to estimate the variable
covariance. To quantify the explained variance assignable
to the different explanatory variables separately, we
Maitre et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:177 
Page 3 of 12
 summarized squared CAR scores separately and multi-
plied them by the sign of the correlation coefficient to
interpret the direction of association. Continuous pre-
dictors were transformed in the case of non-normal
distribution. A summary of the maternal predictors
analyzed can be found in Additional file 7: Table S2.
Step 4. Determinants of birth weight: a variance
decomposition analysis
In order to estimate the importance of different preg-
nancy determinants of birth weight, including the
third trimester urinary metabolite panel selected at step
2, we again used CAR scores. P values for empirical CAR
scores
were
computed.
We
summarized
separately
squared CAR scores and their sum into groups of
variables (variation attributed to metabolites, clinical
biochemistry,
diet,
lifestyle,
and
sociodemographic
parameters).
Results
A selection of baseline characteristics of the study par-
ticipants are presented in Table 1 and comprehensive
lifestyle, clinical, and dietary variables in Additional file
7: Table S2. Mothers were 28–33 years old (interquartile
range) and predominantly Spanish (85–90%). Women in
Gipuzkoa were more educated, from a higher social
class, and generally healthier than those among the
Sabadell subcohort (based on lower body mass index,
more physical activity, and better general health, for
details see Additional file 7: Table S2).
Characterization of maternal metabolic shift during
pregnancy
An overview of the NMR spectral data in the Sabadell
and Gipuzkoa subcohorts, using dimension reduction
regression methods (PCA and O-PLS-DA models) after
normalization for sample dilution, provided a clear sep-
aration of the two trimesters sampled during pregnancy
(Fig. 2a, b). This separation occurred in the first and
second principal components in the PCA model (in
Sabadell, PC1: R2X = 13.5%, PC2: R2X = 5%, in Gipuzkoa,
PC1: R2X = 5.8%, PC2: R2X = 3.9%). Discriminatory metab-
olites were identified from the O-PLS-DA coefficients
(Fig. 2c, d) on the basis of the regression coefficient
strength (Model statistics: R2Y = 0.88, R2X = 0.22, Q2Y =
0.84 for Gipuzkoa subcohort, R2Y = 0.91, R2X = 0.13,
Q2Y = 0.86 for Sabadell subcohort). Steroid hormone
by-products increased by 3-fold in the third trimester,
including 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol-3α-glucuronide (P3G,
progesterone by product), a progesterone metabolite
(likely allopregnanolone and isomers), and a mixture of
estrogen metabolites which had previously been uncharac-
terized in 1H NMR spectra of maternal urine. The identity
of P3G was confirmed by chromatographic isolation of
the target feature (Additional file 1: Supplementary
Methods) and comparison of MS/MS spectra to an
authentic
reference
compound
in
accordance
with
reported guidelines for metabolite identification [17]. In
addition, creatinine, carnitine, and scyllo-inositol were
significantly decreased in third trimester samples, whereas
alanine and 4-deoxyerythronic acid were increased.

 Maternal urinary metabolic phenotype associated with
greater fetal growth
Based on longitudinal fetal ultrasound measurements
and birth weight, fetal growth was assessed (esti-
mated fetal weight based on measures of abdominal
circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length).
Of 64 urinary metabolites present during the third
trimester, 10 were associated in both subcohorts with
greater growth (with P < 0.05) at 12–34, 20–34, and
34 weeks of gestation and birth weight (Fig. 3b).
Levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) iso-
leucine, valine, leucine, and 3 hydroxyisobutyrate (3-
HIB, a metabolite of valine) were associated with a
significant weight increase at week 34 of up to 2.4%
in Gipuzkoa (P < 0.005) and 1% in Sabadell (P < 0.05).
Similarly, estrogens were consistently associated with
greater fetal growth between 12–34 and 20–34 weeks
and fetal weight at week 34 and at birth (P = 0.007 in
Gipuzkoa and 3.10-5 in Sabadell). Progesterone by-
products, were solely associated with anthropometric
measures at birth in contrast to estrogens, with a
0.3–0.6% associated increase in birth weight (P =
0.001–0.02). BCAAs, estrogens and, to a lesser ex-
tent, progesterone by-products were found to be con-
sistently
correlated
to
each
other
suggesting
a
common source of biological variation. Other metab-
olites involved in glucose metabolism, including ala-
nine and choline, presented similar trends with fetal
weight outcomes. 3-hydroxybutyrate/3-aminoisobuty-
rate were significantly associated in both subcohorts
with increased placental weight (+0.9%).
Using first trimester metabolic profiles, only cre-
atinine/creatine were associated in both subcohorts
with fetal growth with a 1.2% change in weight at
12
weeks
(P = 0.027

 women, a panel of maternal urinary metabolites at 12
weeks, including succinate, citrate, carnitine and 5-
oxoproline, were consistently negatively associated with
early fetal growth, at weeks 12–20, leading to decreased
body weight at week 20. There were no consistent associa-
tions between first trimester urinary metabolic phenotypes
and fetal weight in the third trimester or at birth. In an
additional analysis, we also found that fetal weight esti-
mates at 12 and 20 weeks of gestation were poor predic-
tors of birth weight (spearman r < 0.1).
Environmental, lifestyle, and clinical markers associated
with maternal metabolic signatures of fetal growth
Pairwise correlation across determinants of fetal growth
and our panel of maternal urinary metabolites associated
with fetal growth in the third trimester, revealed significant
associations. Determinants of fetal growth included consti-
tutional factors (parental anthropometry, parity, and sex),
lifestyle (sleep, physical activity, night work, daily intake of
alcohol (g), active and passive smoking, dietary intake),
sociodemographic and clinical markers (lipids, vitamins,

branches on the circos plot, metabolite levels were inter-
related with clinical markers (thyroid T3 hormone,
vitamin D, and triglycerides) and lifestyle factors, in par-
ticular smoking (Fig. 3a, b for Gipuzkoa and Sabadell, re-
spectively). The strong associations between parental
socioeconomic status and adverse lifestyle exposures (in
green) are also evident from the plot. Analysis of these
metabolic signatures showed that up to 16–28% of their
observed variation can be explained by a combination of
maternal environmental and clinical factors (adjusted R2
score using shrinkage methods, Fig. 4c, d and full Table in
Additional file 8: Table S3). Triglycerides and cholesterol
explained up to 5% of the variation observed in urinary
BCAAs and progesterone by-products in both subcohorts
(purple key in Fig. 4c, d). Intake of coffee/tea (brown key
in Fig. 4) in the third trimester was the most important
dietary factor in Sabadell associated with reduced levels of
estrogens, leucine, isoleucine and, to a lesser extent, valine.
Physical activity was also associated with reduced levels of
P3G and BCAAs (dark green key in Fig. 4). This result
appeared only in Sabadell, where women reduced their
activity dramatically in the third trimester with the major-
ity partaking in little physical activity (45%) compared to
Gipuzkoa (30%) (P < 0.001). Variation in vitamin D (serum

 25-hydroxyvitamin) and thyroid hormones (T3) were also
related to levels of BCAAs, 3-HIB, alanine, and choline
(only in Gipuzkoa). Sabadell first trimester metabolite
levels associated with reduced fetal weight at weeks 12
and 20 (including isoleucine, leucine, creatinine/creatine,
carnitine) were specifically explained by sociodemographic
factors (up to 8% of variance explained) and smoking ex-
posures (Additional file 9: Figure S5).
Predictive power of third trimester metabolic signatures
and other maternal factors on birth weight
Taken together, the combined explanatory power of
birth weight from all data available in this study (includ-
ing maternal urinary metabolites, lifestyle factors mea-
sured in the third trimester, clinical markers measured
in the first trimester, and constitutional factors) was 48%
and 53% in Sabadell and Gipuzkoa, respectively (adjust-
ing for inter-correlated predictors; Fig. 5, for details
see Additional file 8: Table S3). The panel of 10
urinary
metabolites
in
the third trimester, which
were selected based on their significant reproducible
associations with fetal growth, explained 12% of this
total known variance in birth weight in Sabadell and
Gipuzkoa, respectively, adjusting for all other factors
measured in this study, including important constitu-
tional factors. This is of comparable or larger magni-
tude than the variance explained by each of clinical,
dietary, and lifestyle factors, all traditionally consid-
ered
important
in
the
etiology
of
fetal
growth
(Fig. 5).
Discussion
Through the use of two independent birth subcohorts
we have identified, for the first time, reproducible mater-
nal urinary metabolic signatures of fetal growth and
birth weight on the largest scale to date. We have dem-
onstrated novel and significant relationships between
steroid hormones, BCAAs, alanine, and choline with
fetal weight at 34 weeks of gestation and birth weight
which combined accounted for 12% of the variation in
birth weight that could be explained after adjustment for
all other lifestyle, clinical, and constitutional factors.
Moreover, we have quantified these novel relationships,
showing that a 50% increase in isoleucine, leucine, and
valine is each associated with a 1–2.4% (equivalent to 5–
11 g deviation from the expected mean weight, based on
the whole population standard deviation) increase in
birth weight. Through analysis of rich data on lifestyle
and clinical markers, we have demonstrated further
understanding of the inter-relationships between fetal/
birth weight and maternal urinary metabolites.
A large proportion of the metabolites measured were
affected by the time of gestation but steroid by-products
of progesterone and estrogens were particularly in-
creased between week 12 and 34 (ca. 3-fold). Surpris-
ingly, our study was the first to confirm the identity of
these metabolites via 1H NMR despite previously be-
ing identified as important urinary markers during preg-
nancy [18–20]. According to previous publications, 22%
of progesterone metabolites are excreted in the urine as
5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol-3α-glucuronide [21, 22], which
corroborate our LC-MS/MS and NMR results. Circulating
amino acids are known to decrease during pregnancy,
partially due to hormonal changes, a high demand in es-
sential amino acids by the fetus, and renal changes [23].
This phenomenon was observed in our data, including for
alanine, glycine, and BCAAs such as isoleucine and leu-
cine, which increased by 10–20% in the third trimester
urine compared to first trimester. This can also be ex-
plained by a decreased maternal BCAA oxidation during
pregnancy in order to improve BCAA availability for the
fetus [24]. In addition, carnitine levels were 2-fold lower
later in gestation, which is consistent with characteristic
enhanced lipid oxidation later in pregnancy, in agreement
with previous reports [18, 25].
BCAAs are essential nutrients that cannot be synthe-
sized de novo in humans. Their homeostasis is therefore
maintained by degradation and dietary intake only.
BCAAs are potentially particularly important during ges-
tation as an energy source, or utilized for biosynthetic

 purposes. They can be oxidized to keto-acids, which are
in turn decarboxylated to form acetyl-CoA and succinyl-
CoA, which eventually enter the Krebs cycle (TCA cycle)
and produce ATP. BCAA oxidation is particularly im-
portant in cases of fasting or even in patients with type
2 diabetes and obesity, where there is a switch from glu-
cose to other substrates such as ketone bodies, gluco-
genic amino acids, and fatty acids for energy production
[26]. Some studies using metabolomics have also dem-
onstrated elevated levels of BCAAs in pregnant mothers
with gestational diabetes compared to normal pregnan-
cies [27, 28]. Previous metabonomic studies corroborate
our results, although on a smaller sample scale, where a
general decrease of amino acids in maternal urine at
gestational weeks 14–26 was observed in FGR cases
(n = 10) compared to controls (n = 84) [9]. Significant
differences in BCAA levels, along with other circulat-
ing amino acids, were also identified in plasma and
cord blood studies of IUGR babies [8, 29]. The importance
of BCAAs as predictive markers of gestational diabetes
but also in non-pregnant populations of adiposity and type
2 diabetes is well established [27, 28, 30]. Possible mecha-
nisms involve 3-HIB as a cross-regulatory signal between
the catabolism of BCAAs and endothelial fatty acid
uptake. Indeed, excess catabolic flux of BCAAs, as
observed in diabetes patients and in our study in the third
trimester for those with greater fetal weight, can promote
lipid accumulation and glucose intolerance [31]. We also
found evidence that physical activity during the third tri-
mester was significantly associated with lower levels of
BCAAs, which corroborate results from a recent study on
obesity suggesting that exercise increases the utilization of
leucine in muscle and prevents hyperaminoacidemia asso-
ciated with lack of exercise and insulin resistance [30].
Physical activity, as well as other modifiable lifestyle/clin-
ical factors, such as coffee consumption, vitamin D intake,
or smoking, could be the target of interventions to
help women to maintain appropriate BCAA metabol-
ism and consequently improve fetal growth outcomes.
Overall, Sabadell women had less favorable environ-
mental conditions compared to Gipuzkoa, in particu-
lar
in
terms
of
dietary
supplementation,
smoking
exposure, surrounding greenness, chemical exposure,
and general lifestyle, which were related to subse-
quent poorer clinical outcomes [32–34], and may be
related to the unique 1st trimester metabolic pheno-
type associated with fetal growth.
Urinary metabolites of steroid hormones were posi-
tively associated with fetal growth in the late stages of
pregnancy in our study, which corroborate previous
findings [35]. Starting at the third month of pregnancy,
these hormones are mainly produced by the placenta
and then metabolized by fetal and maternal adrenal
glands, placenta, and fetal and maternal liver [36].
Therefore, the hormone by-products measurable in the
urine, usually the steroid soluble fraction, are the prod-
ucts of the interaction of the maternal–fetal–placental
unit [37]. Previous reports, which corroborate our re-
sults, found that progesterone and estradiol were re-
duced in FGR cases (hence increased for newborns with
greater birth weight, as observed in our study) when
measured in maternal blood in the third trimester [35].
By-products of progesterone were also found decreased
in metabonomics studies of poor perinatal outcomes
using a LC-MS platform [38, 39]. It was also shown via
NMR metabonomics on maternal urine and plasma col-
lected at different time points of pregnancy that urine
signals arising from progesterone metabolites (0.63 and
0.56 ppm) were correlated with increases in plasma
high-density lipoprotein and low- and very low-density
lipoprotein throughout pregnancy, confirming the role
of these steroid metabolites in lipoprotein/protein me-
tabolism during pregnancy [20].
First trimester metabolic phenotypes could mainly pre-
dict fetal weight at weeks 12 and 20, but not at third
trimester and birth and with little consistency across the
two populations. In Sabadell, metabolites related to (1)
mitochondrial
processes
such
as
energy
production
through the TCA cycle or lipid metabolism, including for
succinate, citrate, and carnitine, or (2) to oxidative stress
were negatively associated with fetal weight and growth
but also correlated to sociodemographic status and smok-
ing. Renal changes and inflammation may be at the origin
of some of the markers of early fetal growth impairment
observed such as excreted creatine/creatinine (validated in
both cohorts), 5-oxoproline, carnitine, and N-acetylneura-
minic acid. Creatinine is the breakdown product of creat-
ine
and
creatine
phosphate,
which
are
amino
acid
derivatives involved with cellular energy production, prin-
cipally in muscles. Creatinine excretion during pregnancy
was shown to decrease, as also observed in this study, as
well as levels in serum due to increased glomerular filtra-
tion rate [23]. Interestingly, creatine supplementation
during pregnancy was recently proposed to have benefits
for the fetus and neonate whenever oxidative stress or feto-
placental hypoxia arise [40]. Previous assessment of early
fetal growth using multiple ultrasound measures found that
size at birth does not correspond to fetal growth rate, as
confirmed in our data [41]. Early events during fetal devel-
opment may not result in a visible phenotype at birth due
to catch-up growth during the third trimester, but may
influence health outcomes during childhood and adult
life [41, 42]. There is evidence to suggest that first
trimester growth correlates with cardiovascular risk
factors in school age children even after adjusting for
birth weight [42]. An understanding of the impact of
early
fetal
growth
impairment
or
acceleration
on
childhood outcomes requires further investigations.

 Our study benefitted from the use of two independent
subcohorts for validation, which gives a realistic represen-
tation of the population at large in comparison with
matched case–control studies that aim to minimize popu-
lation homogeneity. The use of longitudinal ultrasound
measurements and individualized growth curves for meas-
uring fetal growth enabled several potentially critical win-
dows throughout pregnancy to be explored. We note
some study limitations. We have concentrated on the
application of untargeted NMR spectroscopic-based pro-
filing. This approach is limited with respect to its analyt-
ical
sensitivity
and
spectral
overlap
of
metabolite
resonances, which was apparent for the steroid hormones.
However, we successfully integrated the NMR spectro-
scopic analysis with HPLC fractionation and UPLC-MS in
order to annotate a number of steroid hormones. Our
work could be complemented with LC-MS-based plat-
forms to enhance overall coverage as well as quantification
of targeted classes of metabolites. This study also relied on
spot measurements of urine, which display greater intra-
individual variability in comparison to 24-h urine collec-
tion or first morning voids. We have identified novel
inter-relationships between fetal/birth weight, metabo-
lites,
and
lifestyle/clinical
factors,
but
the
cross-
sectional nature of these data do not allow further
causal relationships to be inferred. Rather, these find-
ings capture the metabolic signatures of a myriad of
physiological (both maternal and fetal), genetic, envir-
onmental, and other lifestyle characteristics associated
with fetal growth, but not one individual lifestyle/clin-
ical parameter could largely explain the variation of a
single metabolite.
Different statistical frameworks were used to define
the first and third trimester differences, assumed to have
a strong systematic effect on the maternal urine metabo-
lome, and to define metabolite to clinical growth data
relationships, which were assumed to be more subtle in
a free living population. More specifically, multiple linear
regression was chosen for step 2 (metabolite to clinical
data relationships) because of the ease of interpretation
of multiple linear regression and to enable adjustment
for confounding factors, including sampling time and
birth-related variables. In particular, it was important to
be able to quantify the impact of metabolite levels on
growth z-score.
The first scan visit at 11–14 weeks is the most pertin-
ent clinical screening for high-risk pregnancies that
would
benefit
from personalized management.
The
addition of metabolic markers to clinical assessment
could provide further information on the physiological
status of the pregnant mothers, in particular in case of
failure of placental function due to oxidative stress. Up
to now, no single biomarker was found to be predictive
and specific enough for abnormal fetal growth (FGR or
macrosomia) for clinical use, including in this paper.
Clinical assessment may benefit from a combination of
markers, including Doppler ultrasonography [43] and
algorithms, computed taking into account previous preg-
nancy history, ethnicity, and baseline lifestyle factors,
and perhaps even environmental exposures. These algo-
rithms should also be flexible to include any local speci-
ficity in cases, for instance, where there is widespread
vitamin D deficiency or a lack/excess of iodine supple-
mentation. Intervention in high risk pregnancies is an im-
portant area currently being developed, as well as
personalized programs for pregnant mothers. Several
metabolic pathways identified in this paper, and already
tested in animal models as exerting control over fetal
growth, could be tested in clinical trials to evaluate their
safety and efficacy. Interestingly, melatonin, carnitine, and
creatine are currently being tested for their anti-oxidant
properties [40, 44, 45]. Due to the potent growth promot-
ing effects of BCAAs in the third trimester, maternal pro-
tein supplementation in pregnancies at risk of FGR to
improve fetal growth remains an attractive option. For ex-
ample, dietary isoleucine was found to significantly reduce
the degree of growth retardation normally observed
in fetuses from pregnant rats fed a phenylketonuria-
inducing diet [46]. However, adverse fetal outcomes
observed in several clinical studies highlight the need
to fully understand the mechanisms by which add-
itional amino acids in the maternal diet are trans-
ferred to the fetus and how the fetus handles the
protein load [47].
Conclusion
The present study represents the largest human inves-
tigation (n > 800) in which non-targeted proton NMR
spectroscopy
has
been
used
to
understand
the
changes in urinary metabolic phenotypes over the
course of pregnancy in two independent Spanish pop-
ulations. We identified, for the first time, 10 maternal
urinary metabolites predictive of fetal growth using
longitudinal data and birth weight, including BCAAs
and steroid hormone by-products. We could explain a
total of 48–53% of the total variance in birth weight,
of which urine metabolites had an independent pre-
dictive power of 12% adjusting for all other lifestyle/
clinical factors. These results highlight prenatal mater-
nal modifiable factors, i.e., metabolic phenotypes that
are associated with fetal development. The current
study identified metabolic markers in the third tri-
mester,
and
the
metabolic
pathways
identified,
in
particular BCAAs, could be the subject of future in-
vestigations in humans. This novel approach to pre-
natal
screening,
combining
multiple
risk
factors,
presents a great opportunity to personalize pregnancy
