Abstract 
13 
The prevalence of microplastics (<5 mm) in natural environments has become a widely 
14 
recognised global problem. Microplastics have been shown to sorb chemical pollutants from 
15 
their surrounding environment, thus raising concern as to their role in the movement of these 
16 
pollutants through the food chain. This experiment investigated whether organic pollutants 
17 
sorbed to microbeads (MBs) from personal care products were assimilated by fish following 
18 
particle ingestion. Rainbow fish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) were exposed to MBs with sorbed 
19 
PBDEs (BDE-28, -47, -100, -99, -153, -154, -183 200 ng g-1; BDE-209 2000 ng g-1) and 
20 
sampled at 0, 21, 42 and 63 days along with two control treatments (Food Only and Food + 
21 
Clean MBs). Exposed fish had significantly higher ∑8PBDE concentrations than both control 
22 
treatments after just 21 days, and continued exposure resulted in increased accumulation of 
23 
the pollutants over the experiment (ca. 115 pg g-1 ww d-1). Lower brominated congeners 
24

 showed highest assimilation whereas higher brominated congeners did not appear to 
25 
transfer, indicating they may be too strongly sorbed to the plastic or unable to be assimilated 
26 
by the fish due to large molecular size or other factors. Seemingly against this trend, 
27 
however, BDE-99 did not appear to bioaccumulate in the fish, which may be due to 
28 
partitioning from the MBs or that it was metabolised in vivo. This work provides evidence that 
29 
MBs from personal care products are capable of transferring sorbed pollutants to fish that 
30 
ingest them.

 Introduction  
33 
Contamination of the natural environment with plastic debris is an increasingly high-
34 
priority concern among industry, regulators, scientists and citizens.1 Aside from the negative 
35 
impacts on natural aesthetics, plastic debris can cause ecological harm, entanglement and 
36 
starvation when ingested by animals2. Plastic sorbs and concentrates pollutants from the 
37 
surrounding environment,3 especially hydrophobic organic chemicals that are less available 
38 
to aquatic organisms via the water pathway. The role plastic debris in the environment plays 
39 
in the movement of chemical pollution and contamination of food chains is unclear.4, 5 
40 
However, an increasing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that plastics can facilitate 
41 
the bioaccumulation of pollution in a variety of exposed organisms.4, 6-10 
42 
Plastic debris is a ubiquitous aquatic pollutant found throughout the world's oceans, 
43 
coastlines, freshwater lakes and rivers.11 Approximately 275 million metric tons of plastics 
44 
were generated in 2010 and it is estimated that 2-5% of this plastic entered the marine 
45 
environment.12 Due to land based emissions it is estimated that the ocean now contains over 
46 
5 trillion pieces of plastics debris.13 A variety of common plastics are present in the 
47 
environment, but the most abundant are polyethylene and polypropylene4. Prior to biofouling, 
48 
they are buoyant and capable of long-range environmental movement14. Three categories of 
49 
plastic size fractions are (1) macroplastics > 5 mm (i.e., bottles, shopping bags, packaging); 
50 
(2) large microplastic particles 1-5 mm (i.e., plastic production pellets, fragments); and (3) 
51 
small microplastic particles < 1 mm.11 Small microplastics are released into the environment 
52 
by skin-cleansing soaps containing polyethylene microbeads (MBs),15 plastic fibres from 
53 
machine washing of clothing,11 fragmentation of larger plastics and plastic beads used in 
54 
industry as abrasives for sandblasting.16 While the term "microplastics" has been applied to 
55 
plastic debris < 5 mm in length, there is a significant difference in the physical characteristics 
56 
when comparing plastic production pellets ("nurdles"; ~ 2-3 mm) and the MBs from personal 
57 
care products (10 – 700 µm; Figure 1)7. An estimated 270 metric tons of MBs were used in 
58 
commercial personal care products in the USA in 200917. Evidence is mounting that the 
59

 majority of microbeads will associate with sewage sludge in the wastewater treatment 
60 
process.18 However, even though microbeads are present in very low amounts in effluent 
61 
discharge, the total mass released to the environment could be staggeringly high, with an 
62 
estimated 8 trillion microbeads emitted per day into aquatic habitats in the United States 
63 
alone.19 
64 
Ingestion of plastic debris by wildlife is a commonly noted problem. Plastic has been 
65 
found in the gut of fish, seabirds, turtles and whales and implicated in the death of marine 
66 
organisms through entanglement and blockage of the digestive system.4 Ingestion of 
67 
microplastics has also been documented in deposit- and suspension-feeding sea 
68 
cucumbers20, 
deposit-feeding 
lugworms9, 
21, 
detritivorous 
amphipods,7 
and 
even 
69 
zooplankton,22 showing that microplastics ingestion occurs in animals with different feeding 
70 
methods. MBs from personal care products (e.g. soaps) are often < 500 µm,23 a range that 
71 
makes them easily ingested by a wide variety of small marine animals. 
72 
The contamination of aquatic ecosystems with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is 
73 
well known. POPs are characterised by environmental persistence, long-range 
74 
environmental movement, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The adsorption of POPs to plastic 
75 
debris has been widely reported, and examples include polybrominated diphenyl ethers 
76 
(PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),24 organochlorine pesticides,25 polyaromatic 
77 
hydrocarbons (PAHs)24 and perfluorinated surfactants (PFCs),26 amongst others at 
78 
concentrations ranging from low ng to tens of thousands of ng per gram of plastic depending 
79 
upon pollutant and location.25, 27 Plastics are known to concentrate pollution from the water 
80 
column by factors of up to 1 million times (e.g. for PCBs),3 and this property of plastics is 
81 
exploited by environmental scientists in the use of ‘passive samplers’ for measuring in-situ 
82 
pollution concentrations.28 Compounding the potential ecological issues associated with 
83 
microbeads released into the environment are their exposure to and concentration of 
84 
thousands of pollutants known to be present in the wastewater treatment process.29

 The hypothesis that chemicals sorbed to plastics bioaccumulate was first proposed in 
86 
the 1980s from the positive association of ingested plastic debris and PCB levels in birds30, 
87 
findings which have been supported in more recent studies.6, 7, 10, 31 Surprisingly few studies 
88 
have examined this relationship with controlled experimental studies or even field studies; 
89 
therefore, the exact nature of exposure and bioaccumulation of chemicals sorbed to plastic 
90 
debris is still not characterised. Laboratory studies investigating bioaccumulation of sorbed 
91 
chemicals on plastics have used organisms including lugworms8, 9, amphipods7 and fish6. In 
92 
this study we exposed fish to PBDEs at environmentally relevant concentrations25, 27 in 
93 
controlled amounts on MBs so as to allow the connection between sorbed chemicals on the 
94 
plastics and ingestion to be determined. 
95 
PBDEs were chosen as the model chemical in this experiment as specific PBDE 
96 
congeners can biomagnify up the food chain in marine animals,32, 33 and consumption of fish 
97 
and shellfish has been strongly linked to elevated levels of PBDEs in humans.34 There are 
98 
209 possible PBDE congeners, but congeners BDE-47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -183 and -209 
99 
are the dominant congeners in the commercial formulations35 and are the most prevalent in 
100 
the environment.36 PBDEs have a wide range of chemical properties that include increasing 
101 
hydrophobicity with degree of bromination; log Kow ranging between 5.94 – 10.37 Here we 
102 
show for the first time that fish accumulated PBDEs in their tissues when fed MBs (isolated 
103 
from a commercial facial cleanser) which were spiked with PBDEs. Furthermore, we have 
104 
demonstrated that the bioaccumulation of PBDEs in fish tissue was inversely related to the 
105 
hydrophobic nature of the chemicals, with moderately lipophilic congeners (log KOW 5-6) 
106 
being more bioavailable than highly lipophilic ones. 
107 
Methods 
108 
Experimental design 
109 
Murray River rainbow fish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) were fed in three treatments: 
110 
Food only (control group 1), food with Clean-MBs (control group 2) and food with PBDE-
111 
Page 5 of 25

Environmental Science & Technology
 spiked MBs (exposure group, "PBDE+MBs"). Forty five 10 L aquaria (glass tanks assembled 
112 
with a silicon sealant) were cleaned with detergent and then alcohol. Three juvenile fish were 
113 
placed into each aquarium, which were randomly assigned to treatment groups using a 
114 
random number generator (15 replicate tanks per treatment). The experiment was 
115 
maintained at 25 ± 0.5 °C. Potable water was used, which had been further filtered on-site 
116 
with activated carbon and a 20 µm pleated polyester filtration system. Fish were acclimated 
117 
for two weeks prior to the experiment. Each day, all treatments were fed 70 mg of food 
118 
(TetraColour® Tropical Granules, ca. 2 % of body weight), while 10 mg of ‘clean’ MBs were 
119 
mixed into the food for control group 2, and 10 mg MBs spiked with 200 ng g-1 of target 
120 
PBDEs (2000 ng g-1 for BDE-209) for the exposure group. Fish ate the food and 
121 
microplastics rapidly after the addition to the fish tank and microscopic examination of faeces 
122 
during a preliminary feeding trial confirmed the ingestion of MBs (Supplementary 
123 
Information). Every second day, waste was removed and 70 % of the water volume was 
124 
replaced. pH and ammonia levels were tested daily (Oakton Eco Tester pH2 pen, Aquasonic 
125 
test kit). Temperature was recorded daily (ThermoWorks TW2 thermometer). 
126 
At each time point, the fish from five tanks per treatment were starved for 48 h before 
127 
sampling. Fish were euthanized with AQUI-S10 (isoeugenol, AQUI-S New Zealand Ltd) 
128 
before dissection to remove viscera (stomach, liver, gall bladder and gonads) to ensure no 
129 
MBs were included in the analysis. Fish were stored at −80 °C until processed for chemical 
130 
extraction. Three fish were collected from stock at the start of the experiment ("time-zero-
131 
fish") for baseline analysis of PBDEs. 
132 
Chemicals, standards and materials 
133 
All glassware, unless volumetric or otherwise stated, was washed with AR grade 
134 
acetone (Chem-Supply) and baked at 450 °C for ≥12 h. A standard solution of target PBDEs 
135 
(BDE-CSM, Congeners of Primary Interest) containing BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154 
136 
and -183 at 20 µg mL-1 and BDE-209 at 200 µg mL-1 in 8:2 isooctane:toluene (AccuStandard, 
137 
Page 6 of 25
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

 USA) was used for spiking and calibration. Internal standards (ISTDs) were BDE-37 and 
138 
BDE-77 at 50 µg mL-1 in isooctane (AccuStandard), and 25 µg mL-1 13C-labelled BDE-209 in 
139 
toluene (Wellington Laboratories).  
140 
Preparation of clean & PBDE spiked MBs 
141 
Polyethylene MBs were extracted from Nivea® Exfoliating Face Scrub soap (listed as 
142 
‘polyethylene’ in the ingredients and confirmed using FT-IR) and were approximately 10-700 
143 
µm in length and irregularly shaped (Figure 1). Isolated MBs were cleaned using an 
144 
accelerated solvent extractor (ASE-200, Dionex, California) run ten times (extraction solvent 
145 
100 % isopropanol, 80 °C, 1500 psi, 10 min static time with two cycles, flush volume 70 %, 
146 
purge time 120 s) to remove residual surfactants and any existing chemical contamination. 
147 
MBs for dietary exposure were prepared by creating slurries of MBs (10 g) and ethanol that 
148 
contained 2 µg (20 µg for BDE-209) of each PBDE congener (spiked MBs) or solely ethanol 
149 
(control) then vortexed (3 × 30 s) and sonicated (3 × 15 mins). Ethanol was removed by 
150 
evaporation (70 °C) and drying overnight (75 °C). Residual ethanol and un-sorbed PBDEs 
151 
were removed using ASE with Milli-Q water as the solvent (as per conditions above).  
152 
Rainbow fish sample preparation 
153 
Rainbow fish samples were lyophilised for 48 h before being pulverised to a fine 
154 
powder with the addition of 3 g acid-washed sand, 1 g Hydromatrix (diatomaceous earth, 
155 
Agilent) and 2 g activated silica gel (40-63 µm, Davison Discovery Sci.) in a Rocklabs® 
156 
bench top ring mill. Extraction and cleanup was performed by selective pressurised liquid 
157 
extraction (S-PLE) using 4 g of Florisil (60-100 mesh; Acros Organics) and 8 g of acid-
158 
impregnated silica gel (40 % w/w) in 33 mL PLE cells. Samples were spiked with 10 ng of 
159 
BDE-37 and -77, and 100 ng of 13C-labelled BDE-209 as ISTDs prior to S-PLE (for recovery 
160 
correction) using 1:1 pesticide-grade DCM:hexane (Burdick & Jackson) solvent mix (100 °C, 
161 
1500 psi, 5 min static time with three static cycles, flush volume of 60 %, and 120 s purge 
162 
time). Extracts were evaporated to approximately 1 mL at 30 °C under gentle N2 stream. 
163 
Page 7 of 25

Environmental Science & Technology
 Approximately 4 mL of DCM was used to rinse down the inner walls of collection vials before 
164 
being vortexed for five seconds and returned to the evaporator. This rinsing step was 
165 
performed three times on each sample. The final 1 mL of each extract was transferred to 2 
166 
mL GC vials, evaporated to dryness at ambient temperature under a gentle N2 stream and 
167 
reconstituted in 500 µL of isooctane. 
168 
PBDE quantification and data analysis 
169 
Target PBDEs were analysed using an Agilent 7000C Gas Chromatograph Triple-
170 
Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (GC-QqQ-MS) operated in electron impact (EI) ionisation 
171 
mode using a published method.38 Target PBDEs were quantified using Multiple Reaction 
172 
Monitoring (MRM), detecting two transitions per analyte. Separation of analytes was 
173 
achieved with a DB-5MS column (15 m × 180 µm internal diameter (i.d.) × 0.18 µm film 
174 
thickness), with a 2 mm i.d. dimpled deactivated injection port liner using 2 µL injection 
175 
volume in pulsed-splitless injection mode (50 psi for 1.5 min). Other GC instrument 
176 
conditions were as follows: injector temperature program 100 °C (0.2 min), increased to 
177 
330 °C (900 °C min-1); column temperature program 80 °C (1 min), ramp to 230 °C 
178 
(37.5 °C min-1; 0 min), ramp to 350 °C (30 °C min-1; 1.4 min); helium carrier gas 1.8 mL min-1 
179 
(8.25 min), increased at 100 mL min-1 to 4.0 mL min-1; MSD transfer line temperature 325 °C; 
180 
collision gas was nitrogen at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min-1 with helium quench gas at 2.25 mL 
181 
min-1. 
182 
PBDE acquisition data processing was performed on MassHunter quantitative 
183 
analysis software (v. B.06.00). Quantification was performed by calculating the response 
184 
factor of each analyte relative to its corresponding surrogate ISTD using a seven-point 
185 
calibration curve, ranging from 0.1 to 50 ng mL-1 (10 to 500 ng mL-1 for BDE-209). All 
186 
calibration standards contained 20 ng mL-1 of BDE-37 and -77, and 200 ng mL-1 of 13C-
187 
labelled BDE-209 as ISTDs. ISTD BDE-37 was used for quantification of BDE-28, while 
188 
BDE-77 was used for quantification of BDE-47, -100, -99, 154, -153 and -183, and 13C-
189

 labelled BDE-209 was used for quantification of BDE-209. PBDE concentrations in fish are 
190 
reported as congener mass per g wet weight (ww), as it is not possible to determine 
191 
extractable lipid content of individual samples when using S-PLE. Concentrations were 
192 
determined using least-squares regression analysis of peak area ratio versus concentration 
193 
ratio over the calibration range; calibration curves were required to have coefficients of 
194 
determinations (R2) > 0.999 for all analytes.  
195 
Statistical analyses were performed (α = 0.05) on three data sets: total PBDEs 
196 
(∑8PBDE), individual congener concentrations, and proportional uptake of PBDE congeners. 
197 
Proportional uptake data were arcsine square-root transformed prior to analysis. ∑8PBDE 
198 
data were first analysed using fixed factor 2-way ANOVA, comparing differences in 
199 
concentration among time and treatments. As 2-way ANOVA was significant, Bonferroni 
200 
pairwise comparisons were used to test for differences between treatments across all time 
201 
points. Fixed factor 2-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for differences in 
202 
concentration between congeners (repeated measure) and treatment groups within each 
203 
time point. One-way ANOVA was then performed separately for each treatment group at 
204 
each time point for differences in concentration and proportional uptake among congeners. 
205 
Where One-way ANOVA tests were significant, Bonferroni pairwise comparisons were used 
206 
to test for differences between congeners. All statistical analyses were performed on Minitab 
207 
17 or SYSTAT 12 software. 
208 
Quality assurance 
209 
Method blanks (pulverised Hydromatrix, sand and silica gel) and laboratory control 
210 
samples (LCS; same as method blanks plus 20 ng of each target PBDE) and matrix spike 
211 
samples (same as LCS plus 5 g ww whitebait fish) were extracted with every batch of 
212 
samples. Mean analyte recoveries in LCS (n = 6) and matrix spikes (n = 6) ranged from 77 
213 
to 107 % and 57 to 108 %, respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 25 %. 
214 
Page 9 of 25
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
 Calculated recoveries for all samples, including mean recoveries and RSDs, are available in 
215 
the Supplementary Information. 
216 
Three analytes were consistently detected in method blanks: BDE-47 (220 – 687 pg), 
217 
BDE-100 (94 – 188 pg) and BDE-99 (210 – 829 pg). The level of contamination in blanks 
218 
was not constant, as represented by the RSDs of the on-column concentration of 37 %, 31 % 
219 
and 52 % for BDE-47, -100 and -99, respectively. Due to the high variance and concerns 
220 
regarding the possibility of false positive results for experiment samples, samples were 
221 
blank-corrected by subtracting the 95 % upper confidence limit (UCL) of blank means: 
222 
95 % ��� =  �(���,   ���) ×
��
√�, where � is the Student’s t-value (two-tailed) at n-1 degrees of 
223 
freedom and 95% confidence level, ��  is the standard deviation of measured analyte 
224 
concentration in blanks and n is the number of blanks analysed. 
225 
The proportional sorption (of spiked mass) of PBDE congeners was 88-99 % on 
226 
spiked MBs. Triplicate samples of fish feed and prepared clean and spiked MBs were 
227 
analysed for PBDEs prior to the experiment (Supplementary Information). Mean ∑8PBDE 
228 
concentrations on food and clean MBs were 0.24 and 0.28 ng g-1, respectively. 
229 
Results & Discussion 
230 
Bioaccumulation of PBDEs  
231 
PBDEs were detected in time-zero fish, prior to experiment commencement, 
232 
reflecting the ubiquitous nature of PBDEs in organisms. The mean Σ8PBDEs concentration 
233 
in PBDE-treatment fish was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than both control groups at all 
234 
time points, demonstrating accumulation of PBDEs in the exposed fish (Figure 2). Food Only 
235 
and Clean-MBs treatments were not significantly different at any time points. This finding is 
236 
contrary to previous studies which utilised theoretical analysis to conclude that 
237 
environmental plastics would likely reduce contaminant body burden in organisms that ingest 
238 
them.17, 39 In PBDE+MBs treatments, the mean Σ8PBDEs increased during the course of the 
239 
Page 10 of 25

Environmental Science & Technology
 experiment to 9.72 ng g-1 at 63 days. The rate of Σ8PBDEs accumulation in exposure 
240 
treatments was estimated at 115 pg g-1 ww per day (linear regression R2 = 0.59). The 
241 
experimental fish ate the MBs rapidly (within seconds) once added to the fish tank. The 
242 
tanks were also cleaned every second day to remove debris (fecal, microbeads and other 
243 
matter). PBDEs are hydrophobic chemicals with limited aqueous solubility, which decreases 
244 
with increasing bromination. The high octanol-water partition coefficient and polyethylene-
245 
water partition coefficients indicate that dissolved free PBDEs in the aqueous would be 
246 
negligible, and this phenomenon was tested in our previous study where no aqueous phase 
247 
PBDEs were detected.7 This is consistent with known physical chemical properties of these 
248 
compounds. Furthermore, when cleaning residual PBDEs following the spiking procedure, 
249 
the compounds were exposed to water at elevated temperature (80 °C) using accelerated 
250 
solvent extract (10 cycles) and the removal of PBDEs was negligible, demonstrated by 
251 
the >88% spiking efficiency. These findings show convincing evidence that the MBs 
252 
transferred sorbed PBDEs to the rainbow fish, and that continued exposure resulted in 
253 
increased accumulation of the pollutants over time. 
254 
Congener concentrations 
255 
The amounts of individual PBDE congeners measured in fish tissue differed between 
256 
treatments and times (p < 0.001; Figure 3) and were inversely related to increasing 
257 
bromination and log KOW (see Supplementary Information for all measured concentrations). 
258 
Concentrations of BDE-47 were significantly greater than other congeners at every time 
259 
point, followed by -28, -100, -154 and -153. The elevated BDE-47 values may have been 
260 
due to higher pre-existing levels of this congener, since it was observed in both control 
261 
groups (Figure 3). In the exposed fish, congeners BDE-28, -47, -100, -154, and -153 were 
262 
significantly higher than congeners -99, -183 and -209 in all 15 samples and at all time 
263 
points. BDE-28, -47 and -100 were the predominant congeners in exposed fish at all time 
264 
points, accounting for approximately 25 %, 40 % and 15 %, respectively, of the Σ8PBDEs. 
265 
BDE-47 was also the predominant congener in the control treatments, accounting for ca. 64 
266

 – 85 % of Σ8PBDEs. Other congeners commonly detected in the controls included BDE-28, -
267 
100, -154 and -153 (all ≤ 0.11 ng g-1 ww).  
268 
Concentrations of BDE-99, -183 and -209 in exposed fish were infrequently detected 
269 
and were significantly lower than other congeners at every time point (Figure 3). Among the 
270 
15 samples, BDE-99 was only once detected in the Food Only control fish (at 21 d) and 
271 
twice in Clean MBs controls (42 and 63 d). Of the fish exposed to PBDEs+MBs, BDE-99 was 
272 
detected in two 42-d samples, both at very low concentrations (≤ 0.02 ng g-1 ww) and only ca. 
273 
2 % of chemically similar BDE-100 concentrations. BDE-99 was also detected in three of the 
274 
five 63-d exposed fish samples (0.03 – 0.67 ng g-1 ww). Again, these were only 2 – 24 % of 
275 
corresponding BDE-100 concentrations and were more comparable to BDE-183 
276 
concentrations (<0.08 ng g-1 ww). It would appear that BDE-99 did not transfer to exposed 
277 
fish or was metabolised in vivo. As the chemically similar BDE-100 was readily transferred to 
278 
exposed fish, metabolisation of BDE-99 may be the more likely candidate, as selective 
279 
debromination of BDE-99 over BDE-100 by meta-protonation has been demonstrated in 
280 
previous studies.40 BDE-209 was not detected in any of the 45 fish samples. The higher 
281 
congeners BDE-183 and -209 may have been too strongly sorbed (high log KOW) to MBs to 
282 
transfer to fish after ingestion, perhaps reflective of slower desorption kinetics of the more 
283 
hydrophobic congeners.41 
284 
Proportional uptake 
285 
Proportional uptake was calculated as the mass of PBDEs in the exposed fish 
286 
divided by the mass of PBDEs sorbed to MBs. The proportional uptake of congeners varied 
287 
between 0 and 12.5 % (Figure 4). BDE-47 had the highest proportional transfer (11.5 - 
288 
12.5 %) and was higher than the other congeners even after subtracting the mean 
289 
concentrations found in the control group samples. It should be considered that if BDE-99 
290 
was in fact metabolised in exposed fish, there is a possibility that debromination of BDE-99 
291 
may have contributed to elevated BDE-47 levels in exposed fish via in vivo generation of 
292 
Page 12 of 25

 BDE-47 by meta-protonation of BDE-99. However, while this would cause proportional 
293 
uptake of BDE-47 to be overestimated to some extent, it would not change the conclusion 
294 
that sorbed PBDEs were able to transfer to fish. The magnitude of BDE-28 uptake was 
295 
slightly lower at 8.1- 9.2 %. Proportional uptake of BDE-100 and -154 increased with time, 
296 
with BDE-100 rising from 4.6 to 7.8 % and BDE-154 increasing from 2.8 to 6.9 % between 
297 
21 and 63 d. BDE-99 was only 0.7 % of total dosed mass by the time it was detected at 63 d, 
298 
compared to 4.6 - 7.7 % uptake of BDE-100. The uptake of BDE-99 was similar to that of 
299 
BDE-183, showing proportional uptakes at 42 and 63 d of 0.4 and 0.2 %, respectively.  
300 
BDE-209 was not detected in any samples, and to have been above method 
301 
detection limits (≈ 10 ng g-1) after 63 d would have required a proportional uptake > 0.4 %. It 
302 
is therefore possible that BDE-209 did transfer; but this is the lowest proportional uptake 
303 
observed, and we therefore conclude that BDE-209 did not readily accumulate from MBs or 
304 
that it was biotransformed after uptake. Our finding is in contrast to recently published work 
305 
demonstrating that BDE-209 can be leached from plastics by the stomach oil of seabirds10 
306 
and field studies that report accumulation of BDE-209 in fish caught near marine 
307 
environments contaminated with plastic.42 
308 
At 21 days, BDE-28 and -47 stand out as having significantly higher uptake 
309 
compared to other congeners (Figure 4). At 42 days, with the exception of BDE-99 and -209, 
310 
the proportional uptake of all other congeners was significantly different from one another, 
311 
while at 63 days BDE-28, -47, -100 and -154 together showed significantly higher uptake. 
312 
This observation at 63 days is testament to the increased presence of BDE-100 and -154 in 
313 
exposed fish over time. The total proportional uptake of BDE-99, -183 and -209 together was 
314 
significantly less than other congeners at 21 days; however, at 63 days the uptake of BDE-
315 
99 and -183 was also not significantly different to BDE-153. These groupings again suggest 
316 
that different congeners were transferred at different rates from the MBs to the fish, being in 
317 
general inversely proportional to their molecular weight and hence increased lipophilicity, 
318

 and that some PBDE congeners may have been selectively metabolised and transformed by 
319 
rainbowfish. 
320 
PBDEs sorbed to MBs from facial soaps accumulated in fish tissue after particles 
321 
were ingested. Furthermore, less-brominated congeners with lower octanol-water partition 
322 
coefficients more readily desorbed and accumulated in fish compared to higher congeners 
323 
which may be too strongly sorbed to MBs to readily partition. This trend agrees with previous 
324 
bioaccumulation hypotheses based on KOW values which suggested tri- to tetra-BDEs would 
325 
pose the highest risk, whereas higher congeners may be too nonpolar to bioaccumulate.37 
326 
BDE-99 (KOW = 7.3), however, which has a similar KOW to BDE-100 (KOW = 7.2), went against 
327 
this trend in that it did not appear to accumulate in rainbow fish, which may be due to 
328 
partitioning limitations from the MBs or that it was metabolised in vivo. The bioavailability of 
329 
PBDEs sorbed to MBs that did accumulate in the fish is of concern, considering the large 
330 
volume of MBs (and other microplastics) entering the aquatic environment and their largely 
331 
unknown environmental fates. Implications for the food chain, including the human diet, from 
332 
this very fine fraction of plastic debris demand further investigation.
