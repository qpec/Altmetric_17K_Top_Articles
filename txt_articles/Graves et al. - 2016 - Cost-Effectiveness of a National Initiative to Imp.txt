Abstract
Background
The objective is to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the Australian National
Hand Hygiene Inititiave implemented between 2009 and 2012 using healthcare associated
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia as the outcome. Baseline comparators are the eight
existing state and territory hand hygiene programmes. The setting is the Australian public
healthcare system and 1,294,656 admissions from the 50 largest Australian hospitals are
included.
Methods
The design is a cost-effectiveness modelling study using a before and after quasi-experi-
mental design. The primary outcome is cost per life year saved from reduced cases of
healthcare associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, with cost estimated by the
annual on-going maintenance costs less the costs saved from fewer infections. Data were
harvested from existing sources or were collected prospectively and the time horizon for the
model was 12 months, 2011–2012.
Findings
No useable pre-implementation Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia data were made avail-
able from the 11 study hospitals in Victoria or the single hospital in Northern Territory leav-
ing 38 hospitals among six states and territories available for cost-effectiveness analyses.
Total annual costs increased by $2,851,475 for a return of 96 years of life giving an incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $29,700 per life year gained. Probabilistic sensitiv-
ity analysis revealed a 100% chance the initiative was cost effective in the Australian

Funding: Financial support for this study was
provided by a National Health and Medical Research
Council Partnership grant (number 553081) with
financial and in-kind support from Australian
Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care,
Hand Hygiene Australia, and jurisdictional health
departments. Representatives of the Australian
Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care
attended research governance meetings to provide
 Capital Territory and Queensland, with ICERs of $1,030 and $8,988 respectively. There
was an 81% chance it was cost effective in New South Wales with an ICER of $33,353, a
26% chance for South Australia with an ICER of $64,729 and a 1% chance for Tasmania
and Western Australia. The 12 hospitals in Victoria and the Northern Territory incur annual
on-going maintenance costs of $1.51M; no information was available to describe cost sav-
ings or health benefits.
Conclusions
The Australian National Hand Hygiene Initiative was cost-effective against an Australian
threshold of $42,000 per life year gained. The return on investment varied among the states
and territories of Australia.
Introduction
Improved compliance to hand hygiene among healthcare workers will likely contribute to
lower rates of healthcare associated infection [1] and improve patient outcomes. Interest in
hand hygiene increased with the patient safety movement that emerged in the 1990s [2] and
hospitals today are on average safer places than before. The World Health Organisation is lead-
ing a global effort to improve hand hygiene compliance with 170 nations signed up to the
‘Clean Care is Safer Care’ campaign. Allegranzi et al. [3] have shown compliance in Costa Rica,
Italy, Mali, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia increased from 51.0% to 67.2%. A version of the WHO
campaign was implemented in Germany where more than 700 healthcare institutions partici-
pated including 28 university hospitals. There was an absolute increase of 11% in hand hygiene
compliance in 62 hospitals [4]. The experience in England and Wales for the period 2004 to
2008 among 187 trust hospitals [5] showed combined procurement of soap and alcohol hand
rub tripled, rates fell for MRSA bacteraemia from 1.88 to 0.91 cases per 10,000 bed days, and
for C. difficile infection from 16.75 to 9.49 cases per 10,000 bed days, but MSSA bacteraemia
rates did not fall. Adjustments were not made for all national concurrent initiatives that would
also likely affect MRSA and C. difficile.
Systematic reviews of the evidence for the effectiveness of hand hygiene programmes on
hand hygiene compliance have been published [6–10] and two reported pooled results. Schwei-
zer et al. [9] used evidence from three studies to describe a bundle of education, reminders,
feedback, administrative support, and access to alcohol-based hand rub to show a pooled odds
ratio of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.69–1.97). A further three studies were used to describe a bundle of edu-
cation, reminders, and feedback that showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.47 (95% confidence inter-
val 1.12–1.94). Luangasanatip et al. [10] did a meta-analysis of two randomised controlled
trials and showed the addition of goal setting to the World Health Organization 2005 campaign
(WHO-5) was associated with improved compliance (pooled odds ratio 1.35 (95% confidence
interval 1.04 to 1.76).
The evidence base for the effectiveness of interventions to improve hand hygiene is growing
and programmes are being rolled out globally. Our knowledge of whether these interventions
are good value for money is limited. Infection prevention is traditionally underfunded with
infection prevention departments seen as cost centres rather than flagship clinical services [11].
Obtaining the largest health returns from scarce infection prevention budgets should be a pri-
ority. How improving hand hygiene compliance fits with other infection prevention activities
is not well understood [12]. Investing to further improve hand hygiene compliance might

 displace other infection prevention efforts such as prospective surveillance, screening and iso-
lating patients, ensuring prophylaxis for surgery is done appropriately, environmental cleaning
and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. A balanced portfolio of infection prevention activ-
ities that generates the largest health return per dollar invested should be a policy goal [13, 14].
A cost-effectiveness analysis will reveal how improving hygiene compliance impacts on
costs and health benefits [13]. These studies report a cost per life year gained and so summarise
the value for money of a programme and allow comparison with competing uses of scarce
infection control resources [14]. If the health return is low per dollar invested then we might
seek other ways to use the infection control budget. If the health return is large then invest-
ments in new hand hygiene compliance programmes are justified.
This research describes a national scale initiative funded by the Australian Commission on
Safety and Quality in Health Care implemented between 2009 and 2012 in all states and territo-
ries of Australia. It was managed by Hand Hygiene Australia [15] and there were three stated
goals. To achieve widespread adoption of the World Health Organisation’s ‘five moments’ pro-
gramme [16]. To apply a single training programme that allows healthcare workers responsible
for hand hygiene to teach and measure compliance in a similar way. To promote accurate mea-
surement of new hospital-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia infections using a
standard definition, suggested as a valid and sensitive outcome measure for hand hygiene [17,
18]. The national programme was designed to be simple to use and allow outcomes to be com-
pared across Australia and internationally.
The national initiative augmented existing local efforts to improve hand hygiene compliance
among the eight states and territories of Australia. In Queensland (QLD) there was an existing
programme that promoted 11 tasks of hand hygiene [19], funded by the state health depart-
ment and implemented in all QLD hospitals by the Centre for Healthcare Related Infection
Surveillance and Prevention. Some data were reported that showed high compliance but there
was little education for auditors and relatively few numbers of observations were recorded. In
South Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA) there were campaigns within single hospi-
tals but no state wide implementation other than the health department providing support
material such as posters. In Tasmania (TAS), Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Northern
Territory (NT) there were no hospital level or state level campaigns. In New South Wales
(NSW) there was a state funded programme starting in 2006 [20]. It included education, mea-
surement of alcohol based hand rub usage and auditing of hand hygiene behaviour with feed-
back to staff. In Victoria (VIC) the state health service funded a pilot programme at the Austin
Hospital for six sites [21] that was subsequently expanded to a state wide programme [22].
Grayson et al [22] reported a statistically significant reduction in MRSA clinical isolates per
100 patient days of –0.018 per month (95% CI –0.024 to –0.011, p-value <0.001). This analysis
incorrectly assumed rates were flat prior to implementation. A re-analysis of the same data that
allowed an appropriate linear decrease in rates before the intervention showed effectiveness is
reduced to –0.007 and is not statistically significant (95% CI –0.019 to 0.006, p-value = 0.31)
[23]. Playford at el. [24] found counterintuitively that hand hygiene compliance and healthcare
associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia were positively correlated, and their data came
from 21 large Australian metropolitan public hospitals. They caution against using healthcare
associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia as a sole indicator of the impact of HH compli-
ance citing other important causal factors in the relationship.
The objective for this paper is to report the incremental change to costs and health out-
comes relating to healthcare associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia infections from a
decision to adopt the National Hand Hygiene Initiative implemented between 2009 and 2012.

 Methods
The design was a cost-effectiveness modelling study to predict the change to the number of
cases of healthcare associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, change to years of life lost
among inpatient admissions, and change to total health services costs defined by the annual
on-going maintenance costs less the cost savings from fewer cases of Staphylococcus aureus
bacteraemia infection. Data have been collected for the National Hand Hygiene Initiative on
compliance rates for each of the five hand hygiene moments since 2009. The number of
moments recorded has increased from 127,125 in November 2009 to 461,082 in March 2013
and compliance rose from 61.8% to 76.9% during this time [25]. We chose not to use this mea-
sure an outcome for this study because: healthcare workers might only improve their hand
hygiene while they are observed by auditors [26]; many of the data were missing; large discrep-
ancies between the performance of nursing and medical staff will bias the reported averages
[27]; and, most important is that reliable and complete outcomes were available for Staphylo-
coccus aureus bacteraemia in the time periods before and after implementation of the National
Hand Hygiene Initiative.
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is the only infection outcome included for this study and
the definition has been published [28], see Appendix A in S1 File. Staphylococcus aureus bacter-
aemia is the only healthcare associated infection with a nationally agreed definition among the
eight jurisdictions of Australia [29]. Cases of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia have large
costs arising from extra days stay in hospital required to treat symptoms [30] and so their
reduction will show the largest possible cost savings. Acquisition also increases mortality risk
substantially [30, 31] and quantifying reduction is an opportunity to show the health benefits
of infection control in ‘years of life gained’, which is a suitable outcome measure for cost-effec-
tiveness research [32]. The steering committee formed to oversee this cost-effectiveness evalua-
tion made up of representatives of Hand Hygiene Australia, The Australian Commission on
Safety and Quality in Health Care, and all the state and territory health departments strongly
advised the research team not to include data on other infection outcomes, due to inconsis-
tency in how they had been measured among the 8 state and territory health services. This is
confirmed by recent evidence that shows great variability in surveillance practices among the
eight states and territories [33].
Cost and effectiveness outcomes were estimated separately for each state and territory of
Australia, using the comparator of the pre-existing and locally organised hand hygiene initia-
tives. The cost per life year gained was used to judge the cost-effectiveness of the national initia-
tive and arose from dividing change to total cost by the change to life years gained. Total cost
was the ongoing implementation costs less the cost savings from fewer cases of Staphylococcus
aureus bacteraemia. The perspective adopted was acute services funded by the state and terri-
tory health department, because a decision to continue investing in hand hygiene programmes
would be made at this level rather than nationally. Future costs and health benefits were dis-
counted at 3% [34]. Model outcomes were evaluated for a 12-month period after the imple-
mentation of the National Hand Hygiene Initiative, 2011–2012. How information was
structured to predict incremental cost-effectiveness is shown in Fig 1.
Setting and Patients
Data were collected from the 50 largest acute public hospitals in Australia representative of the
eight states and territories, Appendix B in S1 File. The sample was the five largest public hospi-
tals by number of acute beds in NSW, VIC, QLD, WA and SA, the three largest public hospitals
in TAS, and the single main public hospital in NT and the ACT; the next largest 20 public hos-
pitals Australia-wide were then selected. These hospitals provide 42% of the public acute beds

 in Australia and suggest a sample that can be generalised from. There were 1,294,656 admis-
sions to 24,482 beds included in the cost-effectiveness model for the 12-month period in 2011–
2012, Table 1. No useable pre-intervention Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia data were made
available from 11 hospitals in VIC or the single hospital in NT. No private hospitals were
included in the study.
Evaluation of the impact of National Hand Hygiene Initiative on
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia
Reductions in risk of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia from the introduction of the
national initiative were estimated using 2,304 monthly infection rates across 38 hospitals in
six states and territories. A brief summary is provided and a complete description of the sta-
tistical method and results are available [35]. There was variability in the start date among
sites, Appendix C in S1 File. The average number of months for which data were available
before the intervention was 29 per hospital, with an average post-intervention time of 32
months. A before and after quasi-experimental design [36] was used to compare rates of
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in pre and post-intervention time periods. Analyses were
conducted separately for each state and territory because the intervention was implemented
at slightly different times, there were important differences in average infection rates, pre-
existing hand hygiene campaigns varied and there were different infection prevention poli-
cies. We controlled for seasonal patterns in rates using a categorical variable for month and
we used a random intercept in each hospital to control for differences in the average infection
rates between hospitals. We were not interested in differences between hospitals and

 estimated the within-hospital change due to the intervention, and the average within-hospi-
tal change per state.
Costing Information
The costs of the initiative were incurred by Hand Hygiene Australia at a national level and by
the co-ordinating patient safety group in each state and territory. The estimates reflect the
annual on-going maintenance costs and establishment and research costs have been excluded.
Prospective surveys were used to estimate the costs of extra alcohol based hand rub and the
time costs incurred by the infection control practitioners and other staff who worked in each of
the 50 study hospitals to support the initiative. All costing methods are summarised in Appen-
dix D in S1 File, a detailed description of the methods are available as are a complete set of cost
results [37, 38]. All cost parameters used are summarised in Appendix E in S1 File.
Cost savings arose from reduced length of stay in ward and ICU beds because cases of
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia were prevented. Estimates of the extra days saved per case
of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia came from a survival model that appropriately accounts
for the timing of infection during the admission [39, 40] and the results of this work are pub-
lished [41]. The parameter values used are shown in Table 2. The dollar value assigned for a
ward bed day was obtained from a summary of 2011–12 expenditure and activity for Austra-
lian Public Hospitals [42]. The value of an ICU bed day was obtained from a costing study of
ICU admissions to a public hospital in Australia [43] and adjusted to 2011 prices based on a
rate of health spending inflation [44], Table 2.

 Risks of death from Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia
The extra risk of death from Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was estimated using the same
survival model used to predict extra length of stay [41], and the findings are the number of
deaths averted from fewer cases of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia per hospital. The analy-
sis revealed 16.7% deaths among cases and 5.9% deaths among controls and the log of the haz-
ard ratio was 1.27 (s.e. = 0.13). A normally distributed log relative risk was used for the cost-
effectiveness modelling and the exponent used to update model results. The extra years of life
gained from a death averted due to Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was the difference
between the mean age at death among those who died in the sample, and life expectancy based
on Australian life tables [45]. All relevant values used for the modelling are shown in Table 2.
Model Estimation
Prior statistical distributions were fitted to each of the parameters of the model at the level of
the hospital to capture uncertainty in the information used. Normal distributions were suitable
for most parameters. For the cost parameters gamma distributions were appropriate to ensure
costs were positive. Uniform distributions were used where no information on the shape of the
distribution was available and only high and low estimates were available. The model was sim-
ulated for 5,000 random draws from all distributions, giving 5,000 estimated results for all out-
come measures. The highest and lowest 2.5% for each outcome measure were used to show
95% uncertainty intervals. The probability the National Hand Hygiene Initiative is cost-effec-
tive is the proportion of 5,000 resamples with a cost per life year saved below an Australian
threshold value of $42,000 per life year saved. This figure was chosen based on analysis of deci-
sions made by the Australian government to fund new drugs from the public purse [46]. This
approach to generating cost-effectiveness information is called probabilistic sensitivity analysis
and has been shown to have wide applicability for health services decision-making [47–49]. A
worked example and discussion of how this method applies to the economic evaluation of
hand hygiene initiatives has been published [50]. The data used for the model are available, see
S1 Data.

Results
The largest effect from the initiative was found in ACT with a 28% immediate reduction of
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia infection risk that was sustained for 12 months, QLD also
showed an immediate reduction of 17% of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia risk that was sus-
tained for 12 months. There were linear reductions in NSW and SA that resulted is risks being
lower at 12 months post intervention by 11% and 8% respectively. There were no discernible
mean changes to infection risks in TAS and WA after the adoption of the initiative, Table 1.
For the six states and territories that provided complete data on Staphylococcus aureus bac-
teraemia total annual costs arising from the National Hand Hygiene Initiative were $2,851,475
for a return of 96 years of life, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,700 per life year
gained. This is below the threshold for cost-effectiveness of $42,000 per life year gained used
for this study [46]. As the decision to fund hand hygiene programmes lies with each state and
territory we report the rest of the results at that level, Table 3 and Fig 2. The largest increases to

 costs were in NSW that has 7,739 beds in the study. For the ACT the estimated cost increases
were small as they had only 619 beds in the study yet 9.74 cases of Staphylococcus aureus bac-
teraemia were prevented leading to relatively large cost savings. There is some chance the ini-
tiative was cost-saving in ACT as the lower uncertainty interval for the change to total costs
was negative $155,769, Table 3. The number of bed days saved is reported in Appendix F in S1
File.
There were gains to health benefits in four states, but negligible gains in TAS or WA where
the initiative had no virtually no impact on Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia outcomes. The

 initiative was cost-effective when judged against the threshold value of $42,000 per life year
gained in QLD, ACT and NSW, but was not cost-effective in SA, TAS or WA, meaning that
remaining with the local initiative was a better decision for the latter three states. The probabi-
listic sensitivity analysis showed a high probability the decision to adopt the national pro-
gramme was cost effective in QLD, ACT and NSW, but a probability lower than 50% was
found for the other three states and territories. This is shown explicitly by the data included in
Appendix G in S1 File. The generalizability of the model results is supported by the fact that
24,482 bed-days supplied by the study hospitals accounted for 42% of all public beds in Austra-
lia, and that the number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia included in the model for the 12
months prior to the initiative was 1,617, which represents 93% of all the cases of reported for
every Australian hospital in 2010–11 [51].
Other infection outcomes not included in cost-effectiveness model
Some data were available for other infection outcomes. Rates of all bloodstream infection
(BSI), central line related blood stream infection (CLABSI), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and surgical site infection
(SSI) were obtained from all the states and territories in the study and analysed using an appro-
priate statistical method [23]. Not all jurisdictions collected all these outcomes and only a
patchwork was available. These outcomes were not included in the cost-effectiveness model
because the definitions and data collection approaches used to obtain these data are not consis-
tently applied across the country [29] and these infection outcomes make subsets of each other.
For example ‘all blood stream infections’ will include Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and
CLABSI; and SSI infections will contain some MRSA and MSSA cases. The results for these
other infection outcomes are reproduced from the original publication [23] in Fig 3. The
National Hand Hygiene Initiative was associated with a statistically significant reduction in
infection rates in 11 out of 23 state and infection combinations studied. There was no change
in infection rates for 9 combinations, and there was an increase in three infection rates in
South Australia.
Discussion
This is the first cost-effectiveness evaluation of a National Hand Hygiene Initiative and shows
that overall the programme was cost effective with a cost per life year gained of $29,700. It was
strongly cost-effective in QLD and ACT, somewhat cost-effective in NSW but exceeded the
threshold value of $42,000 per life year gained in SA, TAS and WA. The health returns and
cost savings from the investment made in VIC and NT [52] are unknown as useable pre-inter-
vention Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia data were not available. This result corresponds
with a recent and high quality evaluation of a decade of investment in infection prevention that
showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $14,250 per life year gained ($19,479 AUD)
for interventions to reduce risk of ventilator associated pneumonia and $23,277 per life year
gained ($31,835 AUD) for interventions to reduce risk of central line associated blood stream
infections [53].
The large variability in the cost-effectiveness results among the states and territories likely
has multiple factors. Hand hygiene appears cost effective where pre intervention rates were not
declining, Queensland and the ACT. Other settings such as Tasmania were on the path toward
improvements regardless of the national programme and the relatively high additional cost of
the national programme were not sufficiently rewarded with health benefits from fewer cases
of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. Recent research shows that hand-hygiene was only effec-
tive in time-periods where infection rates were above a critical threshold and the highest

 impacts where in areas of higher baseline infection rates [54]. Policy makers might conclude
that the intensity of hand-hygiene campaigns be adapted to variability in local conditions.
Strain dynamics might also contribute to variability in cost-effectiveness. Lawes et al. [55]
showed the impact of infection prevention is strain-specific. In particular when hospital epide-
miology is dominated by community associated strains, hospital based interventions have
lower impact.
An important caveat is the process used to generate the effectiveness information included
in the cost-effectiveness modelling [35]. As this was a national initiative there were no hospitals
to act as controls and the findings are vulnerable to other changes to infection control policy.
The potential for confounding is somewhat mitigated because the initiative was started at dif-
ferent times among the 38 study sites. This will reduce the overall correlation between the
intervention and other changes. Better quality evidence would have emerged from a prospec-
tive study using a cluster randomised controlled trial or a stepped wedge design [56] as the ini-
tiative was rolled out. Yet national public health priorities often over-ride the need to do
prospective evaluation with a stronger design. An opportunity to use a better design would
have helped disentangle the complex effects of the likely multiple modifiable ecological factors
such as antibiotic stewardship, isolation, decolonisation and improvement to hand-hygiene
[57]. As with many of these projects the request to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the initia-
tive came after the programme had commenced making retrospective evaluation the only

 option. Policy makers in the future might evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new health pro-
gramme prior to national implementation.
That only Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia outcomes were included is also important
and means this could be a conservative estimate of the health benefits of improving hand
hygiene compliance. Lawes et al [54] have shown reduced community MRSA from improv-
ing infection prevention in acute hospitals. If other infections were reduced then further cost
savings and health benefits would have accrued for no extra implementation cost. The effect
of this would be larger cost savings, lower total cost and higher health benefits. The patchy
evidence assembled for other infection outcomes does not show significant reductions in all
of the infection combinations studied. Indeed there were increases in rates of all BSI, MRSA
and SSI in South Australia. This is plausible with infection control professionals in the study
hospitals reporting that many of their existing tasks were displaced by the extra demands
from implementing the National Hand Hygiene Initiative. Evidence would suggest that hand
hygiene improvements are less effective at interrupting endogenous transmission, more
likely for MSSA, than exogenous transmission, which in the hospital settings is more likely to
be associated with MRSA. The English ‘clean your hands’ evaluation [5] showed no associa-
tion between hand hygiene consumables use and methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
bacteraemia. The data we had available for all MRSA, shown in Fig 3, do not however show
dramatic reductions.
Only including ward and ICU bed day costs might understate the true cost savings from
an avoided case of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. It is possible that other savings
occurred in the primary care sector such as interactions with community nurses, but we
judge these to be a small proportion of the total costs of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia.
Another related issue is that accounting costs used to value the bed days saved, $919 to
$1,252 for a ward bed and $3503 to $4,282 for an ICU bed. A recent contingent valuation
study elicited the economic value of a hospital bed day from a sample of 11 European hospi-
tals [58] and found values of €72 per ward bed day and €190 per ICU bed day, much lower
than the accounting costs. The impact of using lower values per bed day saved would be to
dramatically reduce the cost savings and so increase the total costs of the initiative, worsening
the cost-effectiveness ratios. The ‘economic’ rather than the ‘accounting’ value is the correct
one to use for informing decisions about how scarce resources are used [13, 59]. Life years
gained rather than quality adjusted life years gained was the measure of health benefit.
Including a preference based utility decrement for the time patients spent with symptoms
from Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia will make a very small difference to health benefits,
because the mortality benefit was for multiple years and the time in a Staphylococcus aureus
bacteraemia state was less than two weeks. Whether the programme has matured, impacting
on cost-effectiveness for time periods after 2011 to 2012 is not known, and would require
new data collection.
The pressing question for policy makers is whether cheaper health returns could have been
achieved by allocating scarce infection prevention budgets to programmes that were displaced
by the National Hand Hygiene Initiative. This is an empirical question and requires models of
the cost-effectiveness of other programmes. If the screening and isolation of in-patients, or the
expansion of environmental cleaning programmes or establishing of antimicrobial stewardship
programmes generated health benefits at a lower cost than improving hand hygiene, then
resources should be re-allocated appropriately. The impact of this would be to increase health
benefits from scarce infection prevention resources. A balanced portfolio of infection preven-
tion activities that generates the largest health return per dollar invested is a sensible policy
goal, and cost-effectiveness data are important for achieving it.
