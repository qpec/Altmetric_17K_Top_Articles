Despite remarkable responses to cancer immunotherapy in a subset of patients, many patients remain resistant to 
these therapies. The tumor microenvironment can impose metabolic restrictions on T cell function, creating a resistance 
mechanism to immunotherapy. We have previously shown tumor-infiltrating T cells succumb to progressive loss of 
metabolic sufficiency, characterized by repression of mitochondrial activity that cannot be rescued by PD-1 blockade. 
4-1BB, a costimulatory molecule highly expressed on exhausted T cells, has been shown to influence metabolic function. 
We hypothesized that 4-1BB signaling might provide metabolic support to tumor-infiltrating T cells. 4-1BB costimulation of 
CD8+ T cells results in enhanced mitochondrial capacity (suggestive of fusion) and engages PGC1α-mediated pathways via 
activation of p38-MAPK. 4-1BB treatment of mice improves metabolic sufficiency in endogenous and adoptive therapeutic 
CD8+ T cells. 4-1BB stimulation combined with PD-1 blockade results in robust antitumor immunity. Sequenced studies 
revealed the metabolic support afforded by 4-1BB agonism need not be continuous and that a short course of anti–4-1BB 
pretreatment was sufficient to provide a synergistic response. Our studies highlight metabolic reprogramming as the 
dominant effect of 4-1BB therapy and suggest that combinatorial strategies using 4-1BB agonism may help overcome the 
immunosuppressive metabolic landscape of the tumor microenvironment.

Introduction
For many advanced cancers, immunotherapy has become an 
attractive and viable option for treatment (Callahan et al., 2016). 
Probably most well-known is the monoclonal antibody-mediated 
blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1), a coinhibitory “check-
point” molecule expressed on the surface of activated tumor-in-
filtrating T cells, or its ligand, PD-L1. This blockade allows for 
TCR and CD28-mediated signaling in the tumor microenviron-
ment, resulting in increased effector function and antitumor 
immunity (Hui et al., 2017; Kamphorst et al., 2017). Although 
those patients that respond to PD-1 blockade can achieve long-
term durable responses, in most indications the proportion of 
patients is still low (10–30%; Callahan et al., 2016). This is in spite 
of the fact that PD-1 acts as a general inhibitory factor in T cell 
activation, and blocking this signal should lead to increased T cell 
activation. Thus, understanding how T cells are regulated in the 
tumor microenvironment is of major importance because any 
inhibitory pathways represent potential resistance mechanisms 
to PD-1–blockade immunotherapy.
Although blockade of inhibitory molecules represents one 
successful strategy to invigorating the antitumor immune 
response, another approach involves the exogenous stimula-
tion of additional costimulatory signals in the tumor microen-
vironment. One of these approaches involves the costimulatory 
molecule 4-1BB/CD137. 4-1BB is a member of the TNFR family of 
costimulatory receptors and is expressed on activated CD4 and 
CD8 T cells (Sanchez-Paulete et al., 2016). 4-1BB has been previ-
ously shown to act as a potent costimulator of T cells, promoting 
T cell proliferation and expansion as well as the acquisition of 
a more memory-like phenotype (Willoughby et al., 2014). How-
ever, the ligand for 4-1BB is expressed predominantly by proin-
flammatory antigen-presenting cells, suggesting that in the 
highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment there is 
little source of 4-1BB stimulation. Like CD28, 4-1BB can be ligated 
by using soluble stimulatory monoclonal antibodies both in vitro 
and in vivo, and as such researchers have suggested use of 4-1BB 
as a means to promote antitumor immunity (Sanchez-Paulete

et al., 2016). However, a wealth of preclinical data suggests that 
4-1BB has little activity as a monotherapy, save in very immu-
nogenic tumor models (Sanchez-Paulete et al., 2016). Clinical 
trials of 4-1BB monotherapy, too, have not yielded substantial 
or durable responses and have been hampered by dose-limiting 
toxicities (Segal et al., 2017). Combinations of immunotherapies 
such as vaccination, adoptive T cell transfer, and coinhibitory 
checkpoint blockade with 4-1BB stimulation have suggested a 
synergistic beneficial effect on antitumor immunity (Sanchez-
Paulete et al., 2016). However, the mechanisms by which 4-1BB 
may potentiate immunotherapeutic response remain unclear.
It has recently been appreciated that the metabolic landscape 
of the tumor microenvironment may represent an additional 
resistance mechanism to immunotherapy (Delgoffe, 2016). T 
cell effector responses are energetically demanding, and T cells 
undergo substantial metabolic reprogramming during activa-
tion, effector phase, and transition to memory to support cellu-
lar functions. Tumor cell metabolic deregulation creates an envi-
ronment characterized by hypoxia, acidosis, and low levels of 
nutrient sources such as glucose, glutamine, and arginine, thus 
further limiting T cell function by restricting ultimate cellular 
function (Scharping and Delgoffe, 2016). Thus, even if a strong 
immunotherapy such as PD-1 blockade allows for T cell activa-
tion and initiation of effector function, T cells may be unable 
to generate the bioenergetic intermediates necessary to carry 
out that function.
We have previously shown that T cells infiltrate the tumor 
microenvironment at a metabolic disadvantage, characterized 
by repressed glucose uptake and mitochondrial sufficiency, in 
a manner that was independent of PD-1 blockade or regulatory 
T cell suppression (Scharping et al., 2016). Chronic activation, 
in part, represses the activity of a transcriptional coactivator 
PGC1α, a transcriptional coactivator that coordinates mitochon-
drial function and biogenesis (Fernandez-Marcos and Auwerx, 
2011). Retrovirally reprogramming tumor-specific cells with 
PGC1α resulted in increased antitumor immunity. However, this 
adoptive T cell therapy approach is both laborious and reliant on 
several known (and restrictive) experimental variables, includ-
ing T cell specificity, antigen expression in the tumor microen-
vironment, and population of initiating cells that was metabol-
ically competent. We thus wondered whether other modulatory 
interventions might be exploited for metabolic support.
The signaling of 4-1BB, a T cell–bound costimulatory target 
with much clinical interest, has previously been associated with 
metabolic reprogramming (Choi et al., 2017), and recent studies 
using the 4-1BB–signaling domain in chimeric antigen receptor 
T cells suggest that 4-1BB may act to promote mitochondrial bio-
genesis and improve metabolism (Long et al., 2015; Kawalekar 
et al., 2016). T cells go through a variety of metabolic changes 
during activation, including the up-regulation of glucose uptake 
(Rathmell et al., 2003; Jacobs et al., 2008) and processing machin-
ery (Gubser et al., 2013) that support aerobic glycolysis, import-
ant for cytokine synthesis and epigenetic reprogramming (Chang 
et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2016). T cells also dramatically remodel 
their mitochondrial metabolism and, especially during the 
transition to memory, engage in mitochondrial biogenesis and 
fusion that support a heightened respiratory capacity, becoming 
energetically primed for reactivation (van der Windt et al., 2013; 
Buck et al., 2016). Indeed, in all cells, mitochondrial capacity is 
linked to cellular longevity and avoidance of senescence (Ferris 
et al., 2016). In other words, manipulation of metabolism to pro-
mote/enhance mitochondrial function may improve the longev-
ity and memory capacity of T cells, resulting in enhanced anti-
tumor potential.
Thus, we sought to determine, both in vitro and in vivo, the 
metabolic consequences of 4-1BB ligation. We found that 4-1BB 
costimulation results in activated T cells with superior metabolic 
capacity. 4-1BB activation, through stimulation of p38-MAPK, 
results in PGC1α-dependent mitochondrial fusion and biogen-
esis. This substantially increased T cell respiratory capacity, a 
measure of mitochondrial reserve, that could be used upon full 
T cell activation mediated by CD28 signaling. 4-1BB treatment 
of WT mice resulted in substantial increases in T cell metabolic 
capacity in vivo, which promoted a phenotype of intratumoral 
metabolic sufficiency that enabled responses to adoptive cell and 
PD-1 blockade–mediated therapy in murine tumors. Further, we 
found that 4-1BB pretreatment was sufficient to provide meta-
bolic support for a full anti–PD-1 response, suggesting 4-1BB ago-
nists can be sequenced with coinhibitory blockade to increase the 
penetrance of cancer immunotherapy.
Results and discussion
4-1BB costimulation results in increased 
mitochondrial function
Costimulation has long been associated with metabolic repro-
gramming; CD28 ligation, for instance, increases glucose uptake 
(Jacobs et al., 2008), up-regulation of metabolic machinery 
(Zheng et al., 2009), and mitochondrial complexity (Klein Geltink 
et al., 2017), which are important for the avoidance of T cell dys-
functional states such as anergy. Likewise, T cell costimulation is 
thought to be diminished or missing in intratumoral responses, 
thus representing an attractive modality to improve both T cell 
immunological and metabolic responses (Zang and Allison, 2007). 
In the tumor microenvironment, high-affinity T cells subject to 
chronic stimulation become exhausted in a stepwise manner that 
correlates to expression of coinhibitory molecules such as PD-1 
and Tim-3 (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015), with the most exhausted T 
cells likely being tumor-specific and also metabolically repressed. 
We thus first asked which costimulatory molecules would be pres-
ent on the cell surface and thus available for optimal stimulation, 
along the spectrum of tumor-induced T cell exhaustion (PD-1lo, 
PD-1mid, PD-1hi, and PD-1hiTim-3+), using CD8+ T cells infiltrating 
B16-melanoma tumors. Other coinhibitory molecules associated 
with exhaustion, such as LAG-3, track with this progression (Fig. 
S1, A and B). Our analysis showed intratumoral T cells display two 
patterns of costimulatory molecule expression, with molecules 
such as CD28, ICOS, and OX40 being repressed or unchanged after 
the PD-1mid (likely newly activated T cell) stage (Fig. S1 C). How-
ever, the TNFR family costimulatory molecule 4-1BB (CD137) was 
highly up-regulated on terminally exhausted T cells, consistent 
with previous data (Williams et al., 2017), suggesting that this 
costimulatory pathway may be ideal for the reinvigoration of the 
highly tumor-specific, yet exhausted, T cell subset (Fig. S1 D).

To explore the metabolic contribution of this pathway, we 
first sought to dissect the contribution of 4-1BB to T cell expan-
sion in vitro. We activated murine CD8+ T cells with plate-bound 
anti-CD3 in the presence of soluble agonistic antibodies against 
CD28, 4-1BB, or both. Although CD3 stimulation alone supports 
poor T cell expansion, consistent with previous findings, 4-1BB 
was able to substitute for CD28 in the expansion of these T cells 
(Fig. S1 E). Functional profiling revealed these cells were potent 
effector T cells, and cells from combinatorial costimulation of 
CD28 and 4-1BB bore high expression of IL-2 and granzyme B 
(Fig. S1, F and G). Because 4-1BB signaling has been linked to met-
abolic reprogramming previously (Willoughby et al., 2014; Long 
et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2017), we asked how 4-1BB signaling mod-
ifies the metabolic profile of these previously activated, rested T 
cells. Flow cytometric analysis of these expanded cells showed 
4-1BB–stimulated T cells have higher mitochondrial mass, as 
measured by MitoTracker FM staining (Fig. 1 A). Metabolic pro-
filing using Seahorse analysis revealed that T cells stimulated and 
expanded for several days with 4-1BB have no appreciable dif-
ferences in basal oxidative metabolism (Fig. 1 B, left) but rather 
harbor a dramatically increased respiratory capacity (Fig. 1 B, 
right). Interestingly, cotreatment with CD28 and 4-1BB agonists 
showed no increase in respiratory capacity but had significant 
increases in basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), suggesting 
that 4-1BB might promote increases in mitochondrial content, 
whereas CD28 may promote mitochondrial function, consistent 
with previous studies (Fig. 1 B; Buck et al., 2016; Kawalekar et 
al., 2016). We also sought to determine the bioenergetic effects of 
this respiratory capacity. ATP levels in cells are relatively stable 
in nonstress situations, but ADP/ATP ratios can reveal a degree 
of metabolic readiness. We found that cells treated with 4-1BB 
(which have substantial respiratory capacity) have much higher 
intracellular levels of ADP compared with CD28 or cotreated 
cells, suggesting that these cells contain mitochondria energeti-
cally primed to produce ATP swiftly upon demand (Fig. 1 C).
4-1BB agonism has been considered an attractive strategy for 
the immunotherapy of cancer, providing an additional costim-
ulatory signal within the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we 
wanted to also determine how 4-1BB agonism might affect T cell 
metabolism in vivo, even in the absence of tumor. We also wished 
to compare this therapy to PD-1 blockade, which has been pre-
viously associated with improving peripheral oxidative metabo-
lism (Chamoto et al., 2017) and functions, in part, by enhancing 
CD28 signaling (Hui et al., 2017; Kamphorst et al., 2017), con-
sistent with our manipulations in vitro. Indeed, PD-1 blockade 
resulted in a modest increase in oxidative metabolism of CD8+ 
T cells isolated from the peripheral lymph nodes of mice (Fig. 1, 
D and E). However, 4-1BB agonism, consistent with our in vitro 
findings, resulted in a striking increase in respiratory capacity 
of these cells (Fig. 1, D and E). 4-1BB also induced increases in 
basal T cell glycolysis, as measured by the extracellular acidifi-
cation rate (ECAR; Fig. S2 A), but did not dramatically change 
the OCR/ECAR ratio (Fig. S2 B). Cotreatment with anti–PD-1 and 
anti–4-1BB resulted in significant increases in basal oxygen con-
sumption (Fig. 1 E), suggesting that, from what we had observed 
in vitro, 4-1BB promotes increases in mitochondrial content, 
whereas PD-1 blockade–mediated costimulatory activity results 
in increased oxidative function. We also confirmed that 4-1BB 
agonism in vivo improves ADP/ATP ratios, consistent with our 
in vitro energetic phenotyping of energetic priming of these 
cells (Fig. 1 F). We also profiled CD4+Foxp3– and CD4+Foxp3+ T 
cells from Foxp3 reporter mice treated similarly. These analyses 
revealed that conventional and regulatory CD4+ T cells did not 
metabolically reprogram in response to 4-1BB agonist antibody 
treatment (Fig. S2, C and D).Thus, 4-1BB agonism, in vitro and 
in vivo can induce metabolic reprogramming, predominantly in 
oxidative metabolism, of CD8+ T cells.
We have previously shown that in tumor-infiltrating T cells, 
mitochondrial biogenesis is suppressed, in part because of inhi-
bition of the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α (Scharping et al., 
2016). We reasoned that 4-1BB might support PGC1α expression. 
Indeed, cells costimulated with 4-1BB show increased expression 
of PGC1α (Fig. 1 G and Fig. S2 E). To determine the requirement 
for PGC1α in this process, we repeated our studies in PGC1α-de-
ficient T cells from Ppargc1af/fCd4Cre mice. PGC1α is required for 
4-1BB–mediated increases in mitochondrial mass (Fig. 1 H) and 
respiratory capacity (Fig. 1, I and J). Thus, 4-1BB promotes met-
abolic reprogramming that involves PGC1α-mediated pathways.
4-1BB costimulation results in increased mitochondrial fusion 
and biogenesis via p38-MAPK
We next wanted to determine the mechanism by which 4-1BB 
promotes increased mitochondrial content in T cells. To do this, 
we used short-term stimulation of T cells in vitro with 4-1BB ago-
nist antibody. Even within 24 h of activation, 4-1BB was superior 
to CD28 at promoting increased respiratory capacity, similar to 
cells costimulated and expanded in the presence of 4-1BB liga-
tion (Fig. 2 A). To identify whether there were any intracellular 
differences in mitochondrial volume or fusion, we conducted 
microscopic analysis of CD28- or 4-1BB–costimulated T cells ret-
rovirally transduced with a construct encoding the mitochon-
drial protein TOM20 tagged to the enhanced GFP NeonGreen. 
Microscopic analysis of TOM20-NeonGreen–expressing T cells 
costimulated with anti–4-1BB revealed high mitochondrial vol-
ume and the presence of mitochondrial networking, suggesting 
increased mitochondrial fusion (Fig. 2 B). We also costained for 
mitofusin-2, which colocalized with mitochondria and had more 
intense, punctate staining in 4-1BB–treated cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, 
we sought to determine how 4-1BB signaling might promote 
increased fusion and biogenesis. 4-1BB is a TNFR superfamily 
member and has been shown to activate p38-MAPK and NF-kB 
(Munn, 2011), and in other cell types, p38-MAPK can activate 
the transcription factor ATF2 to promote mitochondrial fusion 
and biogenesis, in part through PGC1α and mitofusins (Akimoto 
et al., 2005). Indeed, mitofusin-2 is a PGC1α target gene, con-
sistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial biogenesis and 
fusion are linked (Bach et al., 2003). Signaling analyses of 
4-1BB–costimulated T cells revealed activation of p38-MAPK, 
resulting in increases in activating phosphorylation of ATF2 
and expression of mitofusin-2 (Fig. 2 C). PGC1α, as a transcrip-
tional coactivator, can bolster ATF2-mediated transcription of 
mitofusin-2. Indeed, 4-1BB stimulation promoted expression of 
mitofusin-2 in a manner that was diminished in the absence of 
PGC1α (Fig. 2 D). We next wanted to identify whether p38 was

the dominant signaling pathway for this effect. Costimulation 
in the presence of the p38-MAPK inhibitor SB202190 revealed 
that 4-1BB up-regulation of mitofusin (Fig. S2 F) and respi-
ratory capacity (Fig. S2 G) was dependent on the activation of 
p38 signaling, returning to respiratory capacity of CD28 levels. 
SB202190 has been shown to have off-target effects (Shanware 
et al., 2009), so we also used retroviral-mediated RNA interfer-
ence to the Mapk14 gene encoding p38α. Costimulation with 
4-1BB failed to induce spare respiratory capacity or mitofusin-2 
expression when cells were stably express shRNA targeting p38 
(Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, 4-1BB signaling acts through p38-MAPK to 
promote increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity through 
PGC1α and promote increased mitochondrial volume suggestive 
of mitochondrial fusion.
4-1BB agonists metabolically enable anti–PD-1 responses
To determine how 4-1BB–mediated changes in T cell metabolism 
might enable the immune response to cancer, we used B16 mela-
noma, an aggressive C57/BL6-derived cancer model that is insen-
sitive to most standard immunotherapies. We found, consistent

with a previous study in B16 melanoma (Chen et al., 2015), that 
PD-1 immunotherapy was ineffective in inducing antitumor 
responses and that 4-1BB monotherapy could slow tumor pro-
gression but fail to induce complete tumor regression (Fig. 3 A). 
However, the combination of these two therapies resulted in 
robust antitumor response (Fig. 3 A). We next characterized the 
metabolic makeup of the tumor infiltrate. We have previously 
shown that tumor-infiltrating T cells show decreased mitochon-
drial function and mass, mediated by repressed expression of 
PGC1α (Scharping et al., 2016). We interrogated T cells from small 
B16 tumors treated for 3 d with these various therapies. Neither 
control treatment nor PD-1 therapy induced expression of PGC1α 
in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), but with both anti–4-
1BB and combination therapy we observed an increase in PGC1α 
expression (Fig. 3 B). This was correlated with an increase in p38-
MAPK activation (phosphorylation as measured by flow cytom-
etry), suggesting 4-1BB was activating the p38 cascade in CD8+ 
TILs. (Fig. 3 C). 4-1BB or cotreatment prevented the loss of meta-
bolic sufficiency typically observed in CD8+ TILs, as measured by 
2NBDG uptake and MitoTracker FM staining (Fig. 3 D). Consis-
tent with our agonist antibody treatment in non–tumor-bearing 
mice, CD4+ tumor-infiltrating T cells did not appear to be meta-
bolically reprogrammed by 4-1BB agonism (Fig. S3). Thus, our 
data suggest that 4-1BB acts, at least in part, to improve the met-
abolic sufficiency of intratumoral T cells. We hypothesized that 
this heightened metabolic state primes these tumor-infiltrating 
T cells for activation, enabling their activity when PD-1–mediated 
inhibition of T cell activation is relieved.
4-1BB agonists enable adoptive cell therapy through PGC1α
We next wanted to determine whether PGC1α-mediated meta-
bolic reprogramming was required for the immunostimulatory 
effects of 4-1BB in immunotherapy, using transfer of preactivated 
OT-I T cells into mice bearing OVA-expressing B16 melanoma 
as a model. Transfer of activated OT-I T cells into mice bearing 
small B16OVA tumors results in a transient and incomplete tumor 
regression that can be markedly improved by treating recipi-
ent mice with 4-1BB agonist antibody (Fig. 4 A). However, this

response was completely lost when the transferred OT-I T cells 
lacked PGC1α (Fig. 4 A). Although these data suggested 4-1BB’s 
effects were solely on the transferred T cells, in this treatment 
strategy 4-1BB could still be acting on other cells in the micro-
environment. Thus, we altered our strategy and limited 4-1BB 
treatment to the in vitro activation of the therapeutic T cells. 
Although less potent than in vivo treatment, 4-1BB–costimu-
lated OT-I cells were superior therapeutic T cells, providing the 
only statistically significant decrease in tumor growth in our 
assay (Fig. 4 B). Again, this effect required expression of PGC1α 
(Fig. 4 B). Thus, our data suggest that 4-1BB agonism supports, in 
a PGC1α-dependent manner, increased T cell activity in adoptive 
cell therapy of cancer.
Our treatment strategy using 4-1BB–augmented T cells sug-
gested that the metabolic support afforded by 4-1BB treatment 
appeared to persist, at least for days/weeks. Because clinical tri-
als using 4-1BB agonism in patients have revealed dose-limiting 
toxicities associated with long-term treatment (Bartkowiak and 
Curran, 2015), we wondered whether 4-1BB synergy with PD-1–
blockade therapy required continuous treatment or whether T 
cells could be metabolically reprogrammed before initiation of 
checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. To specifically test this, 
we compared combination immunotherapy with a sequenced 
approach, in which 4-1BB was given for 3 d (sufficient to induce 
mitochondrial reprogramming; Fig. 3 D), followed by PD-1 block-
ade delivered in the absence of 4-1BB agonism. Mice receiving 
4-1BB pretreatment showed the same synergistic response as 
4-1BB cotreatment (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that metabolic support 
provided by 4-1BB agonism can be sequenced before initiation of 
checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to provide similar benefits, 
potentially without the risk of 4-1BB–mediated toxicities.
Concluding remarks
Our studies highlight the importance of metabolic sufficiency 
in the initiation and maintenance of antitumor immunity. Acti-
vation in the tumor, especially in a manner and environment 
that has no appreciable 4-1BB signaling, in combination with 
a nutrient-poor environment results in an unsustainable met-
abolic phenotype (Delgoffe and Powell, 2015). We have shown, 
both in vivo and in vitro, that 4-1BB stimulation results in 
up-regulation of PGC1α, which enhances mitochondrial net-
working and biogenesis, suggesting a phenotype of mitochon-
drial fusion. This is apparent metabolically through increases in 
respiratory capacity and energetically in steady-state elevation

of ADP, indicative of metabolic “priming,” with mitochondria 
prepared to meet heightened ATP demands during activation. 
Our data support a critical role for costimulation in metabolic 
reprogramming, recently highlighted by a study of mitochon-
drial morphology in CD28 costimulation (Klein Geltink et al., 
2017). Our data comparing CD28 and 4-1BB suggest that 4-1BB 
stimulation may act to improve mitochondrial quality and 
capacity, whereas CD28 supports increased mitochondrial func-
tion and prepares the cell for the demands of differentiation 
and effector function.

Further, we have delineated the signaling pathways import-
ant for 4-1BB activity: specifically, activation of the p38-MAPK 
cascade promotes ATF2 activity, increasing PGC1α levels as well 
as the levels of its target proteins, including mitofusin-2. This 
is largely in agreement with previously published work in non-
immune cells, suggesting p38-MAPK regulates mitochondrial 
biogenesis (Bernard et al., 2015; Ihsan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 
2017). Because memory T cells are characterized by increased 
mitochondrial function (Pearce et al., 2013), we hypothesize 
that 4-1BB–elicited mitochondrial function fosters longevity, 
promoting a memory-like state, thought to be key in sustaining 
the antitumor immune response. Importantly, elevated “respi-
ratory capacity” of mitochondria is routinely associated with 
longevity and, especially in T cells, supports an idea of metabolic 
priming. However, the physiological and functional importance 
of increased respiratory capacity has not been fully elucidated, 
especially in T cells, and may not simply be energetic. Thus, the 
importance of respiratory capacity certainly remains a subject 
for much future study.
Our data in models of cancer immunotherapy support the 
notion that 4-1BB signaling can provide metabolic support to T 
cells, consistent with previous studies both using chimeric anti-
gen-receptor T cells with 4-1BB–signaling components (Long et 
al., 2015; Kawalekar et al., 2016) and basic studies using anti–4-
1BB in vitro (Choi et al., 2017). This metabolic support, charac-
terized most prominently by elevated mitochondrial sufficiency, 
enables immunotherapeutic responses, which, because of 
increases in T cell activation, require increased oxidative activ-
ity for their function. Our data using T cell–specific deletion of 
PGC1α strongly suggest that metabolic reprogramming is the 
dominant function of 4-1BB costimulation, at least in the con-
text of cancer immunology. Our work also strongly suggests that 
bolstering of T cell metabolism, through 4-1BB stimulation or 
other means, has the potential to improve antitumor immunity 
in cancer patients that may not respond to PD-1 therapy alone. 
Our sequencing study suggested that this metabolic support 
need not be continuous with PD-1 blockade, potentially miti-
gating any dose-limiting toxicities associated with 4-1BB ago-
nism. These data are in agreement with recently published work 
using agonism of OX40, another TNFR superfamily member, 
which could be sequenced before PD-1 therapy for optimal effect 
(Messenheimer et al., 2017). We hypothesize that the TNFR fam-
ily of costimulatory molecules may share metabolic reprogram-
ming capacity; however, our data suggest these receptors may be 
expressed at different points during T cell differentiation from 
early activation through functional exhaustion. Future stud-
ies will determine how metabolic reprogramming can be used 
in combination with immunostimulatory therapies to provide 
increased responses in the immunotherapy of cancer.
Materials and methods
Mice
Animal work in this study was approved by the University 
of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, 
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accredita-
tion of Laboratory Animal Care. Procedures were performed 
under their guidelines. C57/BL6 mice were obtained originally 
from the Jackson Laboratories and bred in-house. Ppargc1af/f, 
Cd4Cre, Foxp3YFP-iCre, and OT-I mice were also obtained from Jack-
son Laboratories.
Cell culture
CD8+ T cells were isolated as previously described by using mag-
netic bead (MojoBeads; Biolegend) negative isolation (Scharping 
et al., 2016). In expansion assays, T cells were activated 24 h with 
anti-CD3 (2C11, 3 µg/ml) immobilized on tissue culture plates in 
the presence of anti-CD28 (37.51, 2 µg/ml) or anti–4-1BB (3H3, 10 
µg/ml). After 24 h, cells were expanded 10-fold into fresh culture 
media in the presence of 50 U/ml murine IL-2 (PeproTech) and 
additional soluble costimulatory antibody. After 7 d of expan-
sion, cells were counted and assayed. Cytokine production was 
measured by restimulating cells with immobilized anti-CD3 plus 
anti-CD28 for 18 h in vitro, with the final 5 h in the presence of a 
protein transport inhibitor.
Metabolic assays
T cell metabolic output was measured by Seahorse technology as 
previously described (Scharping et al., 2017). In brief, 100,000 T 
cells were seeded into Cell-Tak-coated XFe96 plates in minimal 
unbuffered assay media containing glucose and glutamine. Cells 
received sequential injections of 2 µM oligomycin, 2 µM FCCP, 
10 mM 2-deoxyglucose, and 0.5 µM rotenone/antimycin A.
For flow cytometric assays, cells were pulsed with 50 µM 
2-NBD-glucose (Cayman Chemical) in vitro for 30 min at 37°C. 
Cells were then surface stained at 4°C in the presence of 20 
nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM for 15 m and then washed and 
assayed by flow cytometry. PGC1a was measured by using anti-
PGC1a (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–rabbit Alexa 
Fluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the Foxp3 Fix/Perm 
kit (eBioscience). Mitochondria were imaged by retrovirally 
transducing CD28- or 4-1BB–costimulated T cells with a Neon-
Green-tagged TOM20 mitochondrial-imaging construct as pre-
viously described (Scharping et al., 2016). Mitofusin-2 imaging 
was performed on fixed and permeabilized samples by using an 
anti–mitofusin-2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and 
secondary antibody anti-rabbit linked to Alexa Fluor 555 (Life 
Technologies). Imaris Image Analysis and NIS-Elements Imaging 
Software were used to analyze imaging.
For ATP and ADP determination, CD8+ T cells were analyzed 
from C57/BL6 mice activated with anti-CD3 (2C11, 3 µg/ml) 
immobilized on tissue culture plates in the presence of anti-CD28 
(37.51, 2 µg/ml), anti–4-1BB (3H3, 10 µg/ml), or both or from cells 
isolated from C57/BL6 mice treated with 50 µg anti–4-1BB (clone 
3H3; Bio X-Cell) or respective rat isotype control, intraperitone-
ally every other day for 3 d. ATP and ADP concentrations were 
measured by using the ATP Determination kit (from Life Tech-
nologies) and the ADP Assay kit (from Sigma-Aldrich) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer as previously described 
(Delgoffe et al., 2013). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE 
on 4–12% Bolt or Bio-Rad gels, transferred to polyvinylidene

difluoride membranes, and blocked in 3% BSA in Tris-buffered 
saline with 0.1% Tween-20. Primary antibodies to phospho-p38-
MAPK, phospho-ATF2, Mitofusin-2, and actin (Cell Signaling 
Technologies) were added in 3% BSA/TBST for 1–2 h at room tem-
perature or overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit 
or anti-mouse linked to horseradish peroxidase; Jackson Immu-
noResearch) were added in 3% BSA/TBST for 1–2 h at room tem-
perature. Enhanced chemiluminescence was visualized by using 
Western Lightning (PerkinElmer).
Retroviral RNA interference
Retroviral particles were generated by using Plat-E cell–medi-
ated transfection. Spleen and lymph node preparations from 
C57/BL6 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 (2C11, 3 µg/ml) 
 
immobilized on tissue culture plates in the presence of 
anti-CD28 (37.51, 2 µg/ml) or anti–4-1BB (3H3, 10 µg/ml). 
After 24 h, cultures were spinduced at 2,200 rpm for 120 min 
with retroviral supernatant in the presence of 6 µg/ml poly-
brene. After 2 h, media were changed. Cultures were then 
expanded for 5 d in 25 U/ml IL-2 and sorted on the top 50% of 
GFP+ cells. shRNA knockdown for each experiment was con-
firmed by immunoblot.
Immunotherapy and tumor models
C57/BL6 mice were treated with 200 µg anti–PD-1 (clone J43; Bio 
X-Cell), 50 µg anti–4-1BB (clone 3H3; Bio X-Cell), or respective 
hamster or rat isotype controls, intraperitoneally every other 
day for 3 d (in non–tumor-bearing experiments) or every other 
day for the duration of the experiment (in tumor experiments). 
For tumor growth experiments, mice were injected intrader-
mally with 100,000 B16-F10 melanoma cells. When tumors were 
between 1 and 3 mm in any direction (typically day 6–7), mice 
began receiving immunotherapy. For TIL analysis experiments, 
tumors were allowed to reach 5–7 mm in any direction before 
initiation of immunotherapy in order to obtain sufficient cell 
numbers. For adoptive cell therapy experiments, mice received 
B16OVA intradermally. OT-I T cells were activated in vitro by 
using either SII 
NFE 
KL peptide (500 nM) or anti-CD3 stimula-
tion in combination with anti-CD28 or anti-–4-1BB, followed by 
an expansion in 50 U/ml recombinant mouse IL-2. When tumors 
were between 1 and 3 mm in any direction (typically day 7–8), 
mice received an intravenous adoptive transfer of 2 × 106 or 5 × 
106 OT-I cells. In systemic immunotherapy experiments, mice 
then began receiving 50 µg anti–4-1BB or its isotype control 
intraperitoneally.
Online supplemental material
Fig. S1 shows 4-1BB (CD137) was highly up-regulated on termi-
nally exhausted T cells, whereas molecules such as CD28, ICOS, 
and OX40 are repressed or unchanged, and 4-1BB costimulation 
was able to substitute for CD28 by supporting the expansion and 
function of murine CD8+ T cells. Fig. S2 shows CD4+ T cells and 
regulatory T cells do not metabolically reprogram with 4-1BB 
agonist antibody treatment. Also, 4-1BB–mediated metabolic 
reprogramming is signaling through p38-MAPK. Fig. S3 shows 
CD4+ tumor-infiltrating T cells are not metabolically repro-
grammed by 4-1BB agonism.
