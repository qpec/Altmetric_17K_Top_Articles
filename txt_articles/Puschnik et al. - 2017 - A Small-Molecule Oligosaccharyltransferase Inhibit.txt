In Brief
The mosquito-borne flaviviruses depend
on oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) for
replication. Puschnik et al. reveal that the
OST inhibitor NGI-1 has pan-flaviviral
activity in several disease-relevant cell
types. The effect on viral replication acts
through OST but appears to be largely
independent of blocking catalytic
N-glycosylation activity.

SUMMARY
The mosquito-borne flaviviruses include important
human pathogens such as dengue, Zika, West Nile,
and yellow fever viruses, which pose a serious threat
for global health. Recent genetic screens identified
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane multiprotein
complexes, including the oligosaccharyltransferase
(OST) complex, as critical flavivirus host factors.
Here, we show that a chemical modulator of the
OST complex termed NGI-1 has promising antiviral
activity against flavivirus infections. We demonstrate
that NGI-1 blocks viral RNA replication and that anti-
viral activity does not depend on inhibition of the
N-glycosylation function of the OST. Viral mutants
adapted to replicate in cells deficient of the OST
complex showed resistance to NGI-1 treatment, rein-
forcing the on-target activity of NGI-1. Lastly, we
show that NGI-1 also has strong antiviral activity in
primary and disease-relevant cell types. This study
provides an example for advancing from the identifi-
cation of genetic determinants of infection to a host-
directed antiviral compound with broad activity
against flaviviruses.
INTRODUCTION
The mosquito-borne flaviviruses comprise a group of important
human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile
virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), which
all pose a significant threat to global health. Despite the high
number of cases, increase of global spread, emergence and
re-emergence of flaviviral outbreaks, and risk of severe clinical
outcomes, there are currently no approved antiviral therapies
against these viruses.
Traditionally, the development of antivirals is focused on tar-
geting viral proteins by small molecules such as nucleoside
analogs or viral protease inhibitors. Alternatively, strategies
that inhibit host cellular factors critical for viral infection rather
than viral proteins have the potential to be more broad spectrum
and more refractory to developing drug-resistant mutants and
provide a different mode of action that complements direct-anti-
viral drugs (Kaufmann et al., 2017). Recent genome-wide genetic
screens revealed several endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized
protein complexes to be essential for viral infection (Ma et al.,
2015; Marceau et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,
2016).
In
particular,
deletion
of
oligosaccharyltransferase
(OST) subunits resulted in a >99% reduction of flaviviral infec-
tions in cell culture, demonstrating its promise as an antiviral
target (Marceau et al., 2016). In its cellular function, the OST
complex catalyzes the N-linked glycosylation of newly synthe-
sized proteins. Mammalian cells have two OST protein isoforms,
which are multiprotein complexes composed of a catalytic sub-
unit (encoded by the paralogs STT3A or STT3B) and accessory
subunits (Shrimal et al., 2015). Interestingly, we found that
DENV RNA replication is dependent on the presence of both
OST isoforms, while ZIKV, YFV, and WNV exclusively depend
on the STT3A OST complex (Marceau et al., 2016).
Here, we used a recently developed, cell-permeable, small-
molecule compound called NGI-1 that targets the OST complex
(Lopez-Sambrooks et al., 2016). We show that NGI-1 exhibits
pan-flaviviral activity by blocking viral RNA synthesis. We further
demonstrate that NGI-1 specifically targets the OST complex
and that its antiviral activity does not depend on the inhibition
of the N-glycosylation activity. Lastly, we demonstrate a prom-
ising antiviral effect in several disease-relevant cell types for
DENV and ZIKV infections.
RESULTS
The Oligosaccharyltransferase Inhibitor NGI-1 Inhibits
Dengue and ZIKV Infection
NGI-1 is an aminobenzamide-sulfonamide compound that
targets both OST isoforms and therefore may exhibit antiviral
activity against flaviviruses (Figure 1A). To test its inhibitory
properties, we infected HEK293 cells with luciferase express-
ing DENV or ZIKV, treated cells with increasing concentrations
of NGI-1, and measured viral replication 48 hr post-infection
(hpi) (Figures 1B and 1C). Significant reduction of viral replica-
tion was observed at 1 mM and higher. The half-maximal effec-
tive concentration (EC50) values were 0.85 mM and 2.2 mM for
DENV and ZIKV inhibition, respectively. Furthermore, we
observed significant reduction of viral particle formation in
the supernatant of DENV- or ZIKV-infected cells (Figure 1D)

 cause cell-cycle arrest and reduced proliferation (Lopez-Sam-
brooks et al., 2016), we determined the effects of increasing
concentrations of NGI-1 on HEK293 proliferation. The half-
maximum cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value in HEK293
cells was 34.9 mM and 33.1 mM using CellTiter-Glo (Figure 1F)
and a trypan blue exclusion assay (Figure S1B), respectively,
confirming that the antiviral effects were not caused by
reduced proliferation. This resulted in a selectivity index
(CC50/EC50) of �16 and 41 for the treatment of ZIKV and
DENV infections, respectively. Additionally, infection with
coxsackievirus B3, a picornavirus not known to require the
OST complex, did not appear to be affected by NGI-1, even
at high concentrations (Figure S1C). By contrast, guanidine
hydrochloride
(GnHCl),
a
known
picornavirus
replication
inhibitor, decreased viral infection. This suggests that the
effect of NGI-1 is specific to the inhibition of DENV and ZIKV
replication
and
not
due
to
a
general,
reduced
cellular
proliferation.
NGI-1 Exhibits Broad Antiviral Activity against Multiple
Flaviviruses
Dengue is caused by four DENV serotypes (DENV1–DENV4),
which are genetically diverse and differ in virulence and endemic
capacity. Multiple serotypes often co-circulate, which severely
increases the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever caused by
cross-reactivity of antibodies against one serotype, which can
also bind a second serotype and enhance its infection (OhAinle
et al., 2011). Therefore a useful antiviral should be efficacious
against all four DENV serotypes. We demonstrated that NGI-1
treatment led to a significant reduction of viral RNA of DENV1–
DENV4 isolates (Figure 1G), which recapitulated the genetic
requirement of the OST complex for all serotypes (Marceau
et al., 2016). Similarly, we showed that NGI-1 had activity against
different ZIKV strains from Puerto Rico (PRVABC59), Malaysia
(P6-740), and French Polynesia (PF13) in infections of HEK293
cells (Figure 1H), making it a promising drug candidate for both
current and potential future epidemics.
Moreover, we noted substantial decrease of viral WNV and
YFV RNA in NGI-1-treated HEK293 cells (Figure 1I). By contrast,
we did not observe a reduction in viral RNA after infection with
the mosquito-borne alphaviruses Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) as well as the
picornavirus poliovirus (Figure 1J). These results highlight the
potential of NGI-1 to be a specific, broad-spectrum, pan-flavivi-
rus antiviral compound.
NGI-1 Blocks Viral RNA Replication Independent of
Inhibition of the Catalytic Activity of the OST Complex
We previously pinpointed the role of the OST complex to viral
RNA replication during DENV infection (Marceau et al., 2016).
To determine which step of the flavivirus life cycle is inhibited
by NGI-1, we used a viral replicon assay, which bypasses entry
and allows analysis of the effect of NGI-1 on translation and repli-
cation of viral RNA. While we did not see a difference in the first
10 hr post-viral RNA electroporation, which is reflective of the
initial translation of the viral (+)RNA genome, viral RNA replica-
tion (apparent at time points after 10 hr) was reduced by NGI-1
treatment (Figure 2A).
We also previously found that DENV RNA replication does not
require the catalytic N-glycosylation activity of the OST com-
plexes (Marceau et al., 2016). This opens the possibility of target-
ing the OST complex without the inhibition of catalytic activity or
glycosylation per se while still blocking viral infection. The uncou-
pling of the antiviral and the cellular activity could thus lead to the
development of a molecule with low cytotoxicity. To explore this
hypothesis, we investigated ZIKV, which is dependent on the
presence of STT3A but does not require STT3B for RNA replica-
tion (Figure S2A). We observed that ZIKV replication was simi-
larly affected in treated cells containing catalytically inactive
STT3A and wild-type (WT) cells (Figure 2B), suggesting that the
antiviral effect of NGI-1 is largely independent of blocking glyco-
sylation of viral or cellular proteins.
Additionally, given the importance of N-glycosylation for prM,
E, and NS1 viral proteins and the effect of NGI-1 on cellular OST
activity, we performed immunoblot analysis for viral glycopro-
teins under NGI-1 treatment (Figure 2C). For prM, we observed
an appearance of a lower band at higher NGI-1 concentrations
representing the deglycosylated form of the protein. This may
result in a small fraction of unglycosylated/immature virions
that may exhibit a reduced infectivity. However, the fraction of
the deglycosylated form of prM was less than half based on
band intensity and thus unlikely to account for the full antiviral
effect of NGI-1 (10- to 100-fold decrease in viral RNA or particle
formation). Moreover, we pinpointed the role of the OST complex
in the viral RNA replication phase using a replicon system
(Figure 2A), but an additional effect on infectious virion assembly
and spread cannot fully be ruled out. DENV E already showed
two bands in the untreated condition, which could represent a
certain fraction of unglycosylated protein or a degradation
product. We did not see an increase of deglycosylated proteins
with increasing NGI-1 concentrations. This makes it difficult
to conclude whether NGI-1 has a de-glycosylation effect on
DENV E protein. Finally, for DENV NS1, we observed an appear-
ing faint band at higher NGI-1 concentrations. Overall, we
conclude that at this dose range the antiviral effect is not largely
due to an inhibition of glycosylation of viral proteins. Although
NGI-1 most likely impairs glycosylation of viral proteins to a
certain degree, the majority of viral proteins are still properly
glycosylated at concentrations where we observed a significant
reduction of viral infection.
Lastly, we examined the oxidoreductase catalytic activity of
MAGT1, a subunit of the STT3B OST isoform, which is necessary
for N-glycosylation of cysteine-proximal acceptor sites in glyco-
proteins and was recently reported to be critical for DENV
infection (Cherepanova et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017; Schulz
et al., 2009). Oxidoreductase activity is mediated by a thiore-
doxin-like fold with a characteristic CxxC active-site motif
(Sevier and Kaiser, 2002). We generated isogenic MAGT1
knockout cells, complemented with WT (CxxC) MAGT1 or a
catalytically dead version (SxxS) of MAGT1, and found that
both WT and catalytically dead MAGT1 were able to restore
DENV replication (Figures 2D and S2B). This indicates that
redox activity mediated by the CxxC active site of MAGT1 is
not required for DENV infection, contrary to a previous report
(Lin et al., 2017). Thus, the mode of action of NGI-1 is not through
inhibition of the oxidoreductase activity. The different outcome in
3034
Cell Reports 21, 3032–3039, December 12, 2017
 the other study may be due to the use of a different active site
mutant (AxxA in the Lin et al. study versus SxxS in our study),
although both mutations completely abolish classical redox
activity.
Together, these data show that the antiviral effect of NGI-1 is
independent of the N-glycosylation and oxidoreductase activ-
ities of the OST complex, suggesting it may be possible to
develop a compound that targets the viral function of the OST
complex more selectively and without interfering with the cellular
function.
Viral Adaptation to STT3A and STT3B Knockout Cells
Shows that NGI-1 Directly Acts on OST Complex for Its
Antiviral Effect
To further corroborate the OST complex as an antiviral target of
NGI-1, we employed a viral evolution strategy. We performed
serial passaging of DENV on STT3A- or STT3B-knockout (KO)
cells and detected four distinct mutations in the isolated and
sequenced viral RNA (Figure 3A). We compared the mutations
that arose to all complete genome sequences of DENV2 in the
NCBI database. Interestingly, we found that the acquired nucle-
otides are extremely rare (<0.5%, with the exception of T4098C,
which is a synonymous mutation) in those genome positions
in naturally occurring DENV genomes (Figure S3A). Thus, the
likelihood that a circulating virus would already be resistant to
the OST inhibitor is low. We then tested whether the isolated
adapted viruses are insensitive to NGI-1 treatment, as they
have lost the requirement for STT3A and STT3B for viral replica-
tion. Strikingly, while we observed a significant reduction in
viral RNA for the WT DENV upon NGI-1 treatment, the adapted
viruses were completely unaffected (Figure 3B), suggesting
that the acquired mutations confer resistance to the drug.
We introduced the mutations individually and in combination in
a DENV infectious clone expressing luciferase and observed
that single or double mutations did not confer the ability to
replicate in STT3A-KO or STT3B-KO cells, that the three shared
mutations led to a moderate level of replication, and that all
four mutations enabled DENV to replicate more efficiently in
KO cells (Figure S3B). Importantly, the adapted DENV reporters
were significantly less affected than the WT reporter virus at
increasing NGI-1 concentrations (Figure 3C).
We also tested whether the acquired mutations confer specific
physical independence from the OST complex or a general loss
of the requirement for N-linked glycosylation of viral proteins.
Treatment with tunicamycin, a global N-glycosylation inhibitor
that blocks the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
to dolichol monophosphate upstream of the OST-mediated
glycan transfer to the nascent polypeptide (Heifetz et al.,
1979), led to marked reduction of replication of all three viruses
(Figure 3C), indicating that adapted mutations and mode of
action of NGI-1 are specific to the OST complex but independent
of N-glycosylation.

 To further exclude that the adaptive mutations facilitate
faster replication and/or broader antiviral drug resistance, we
treated the viruses with MK-0608, a nucleoside analog shown
to potently inhibit replication of several mosquito-borne flavivi-
ruses, including DENV (Chen et al., 2015) and ZIKV (Eyer et al.,
2016). We did not observe any differences in antiviral activity of
MK-0608 between WT and adapted viruses (Figure 3C). Taken
together, these results suggest that NGI-1 inhibits the direct
utilization of the OST complex for the viral replication machinery,
independent of the cellular N-glycosylation function.
Inhibition of the OST Complex Decreases Dengue and
Zika Virus Infection in Primary Cell Types
Human skin is the initial point of entry for these mosquito-borne
viruses. Upon infection, skin immune cells, including dendritic
cells, take up and disseminate the virus (Wu et al., 2000). Addi-
tionally, ZIKV has been shown to infect the placenta and brain
of both fetuses and adults (Martines et al., 2016; Mlakar et al.,
2016; Tang et al., 2016).
Therefore, the efficacy of NGI-1 in various primary and dis-
ease-relevant cell types was examined. For DENV, we observed
marked reduction of replication in normal human dermis fibro-
blasts (NHDFs), monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs),
and Raji DC-SIGN treated with NGI-1 (Figures 4A–4C). Similarly,
ZIKV infection was decreased in NHDFs, MoDCs, JEG-3
placental cells, and human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs)
when treated with NGI-1 (Figures 4D–4G). Finally, we also saw
a significant reduction of viral infection in immunofluorescence
experiments (Figures 4H and 4I).
DISCUSSION
Genome-scale genetic KO screens are a powerful approach to
reveal host factors essential for viral replication and provide
new candidate targets for antiviral drug development (Puschnik
et al., 2017). Previously, other studies identified compounds
that showed promising antiviral activity against DENV or ZIKV.
For example, repurposing US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drugs is a valuable strategy to identify new an-
tivirals with acceptable toxicity and a potential fast path to the
clinic (Barrows et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, natural
products can exhibit antiviral activity (Estoppey et al., 2017;
Rausch et al., 2017). Recently, the fungal compound cavinafun-
gin was shown to be potent and selectively active against DENV
and ZIKV (Estoppey et al., 2017). Interestingly, genome-wide
profiling in human cells identified the signal peptidase as a
cellular target. Remarkably, this is in congruence with the results
of genetic screens for flaviviral host factors (Marceau et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2016), underscoring the potential of host-directed
antiviral drug targets.
Similarly, we observed that targeting the OST complex using a
small molecule protected cells from flaviviral infection. Several

 properties of the OST complex and its use in viral replication
open the possibility for further improvement of the lead com-
pound. First, the catalytic subunit of the OST complex is dupli-
cated into two paralogs, STT3A and STT3B, in mammalian cells,
and each isoform is present in distinct protein complexes.
Although the STT3A complex is important for the co-translational
N-linked glycosylation of the majority of glycoproteins and the
STT3B complex is important for the co-translational or post-
translational glycosylation of acceptor sites that have been skip-
ped by the STT3A complex, they largely fulfill redundant func-
tions (Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009). This allows the development
of selective STT3A or STT3B inhibitors, which presumably
have fewer effects on global cellular glycosylation. Second, flavi-
viruses do not require the catalytic activity of the OST complex
for their replication, and NGI-1 blocked viral replication of
STT3A-dependent ZIKV in the setting of catalytically inactive

 STT3A. This suggests the possibility to modulate viral replication
without inhibiting the catalytic function of the OST complex
and thus compromising cellular N-glycosylation. Lastly, we pin-
pointed activity of NGI-1 to the interference of the OST usage of
the viral replication machinery by utilizing adapted viruses. Inter-
estingly, both the STT3A- and STT3B-adapted virus contained
4 distinct mutations, 3 of which were shared. This highlights
both commonality and divergence in the use of the two OST iso-
forms. The requirement for 4 escape mutations may further sug-
gest that the barrier of resistance to NGI-1 is quite high
compared to the commonly observed single or double escape
mutations for direct-acting antivirals. Additionally, escape mu-
tants of direct-acting antivirals usually contain mutations in
the enzymatic target domains (protease or RNA polymerase
domain). This suggests that there is no expected cross-resis-
tance, which may be favorable for combination therapy.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the advancement from
the identification of a drug target through a genome-scale
genetic screen to the development of a host-directed antiviral
therapy with defined mechanism of action, broad antiviral activ-
ity, and a potentially high barrier of resistance.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reporter Virus Assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and infected with DENV-2 luciferase re-
porter at an MOI of 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFUs) per cell and ZIKV-lucif-
erase from undiluted cell supernatant, respectively, and treated with
different concentrations of NGI-1. Cells were lysed 48–96 hpi. For the
coxsackievirus B3 luciferase reporter cells were pretreated with NGI-1 for
24 hr, infected under continuous treatment, and lysed 24 hpi. Luciferase
expression was measured using the Renilla Luciferase Assay system
(Promega).
Cell Proliferation and Viability Assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of
NGI-1. After 48 hr, cell growth was measured using CellTiter-Glo (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions or trypan blue solution.
PFU Assay
HEK293FT cells were plated in 96-well plates, infected with DENV-2 or ZIKV
PRVABC59 at an MOI of 0.1 PFUs per cell, and treated with 8 mM NGI-1. After
48 hr, supernatant was harvested and a 10-fold dilutions series was per-
formed. The dilutions were added to Huh7.5.1 cells plated in a 6-well plate,
incubated for 2 hr, and then aspirated. Cells were overlaid with 2% low-
melting-point agarose/DMEM, grown for 6 days, and then fixed using
15% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then stained overnight with crystal
violet (0.1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol). The next day, the wells were exten-
sively washed with water and dried. The resulting plaques were counted, and
the number of PFUs per milliliter was calculated.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated in 8-well m-slides (ibidi). Huh7 and JEG-3 cells were infected
with DENV-2 or ZIKV PRVABC59 at an MOI of 0.1 PFUs per cell, and NHDFs
and hNPCs were infected at an MOI of 0.5 PFUs per cell. Cells were then
treated with 8 mM NGI-1 and after 40–48 hr fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde.
Viral envelope protein was stained using anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody
(clone D1-4G2-4-15, EMD Millipore) at 1:1,000 in blocking buffer (PBS contain-
ing 1% saponin, 1% Triton X-100, 5% fetal bovine serum [FBS], and 0.1%
azide) for 1 hr, followed by 2 washes and incubation with goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG) Alexa 488 (Life Technologies) and DAPI (Insitus) for
30 min. After 3 washes with PBS, cells were visualized using confocal micro-
scopy. For quantitative analysis of infectivity, 3 random fields of view were
acquired for each condition. DAPI and Alexa 488 signals were automatically
counted using the ‘‘Analyze Particles’’ feature in ImageJ, and the percentage
of infected cells was calculated by dividing the number of Alexa-488-positive
cells by the number of DAPI-positive cells.
qRT-PCR
Cells were plated in 96-well plates (in triplicate for each condition), infected
at an MOI of 0.1 PFUs per cell, and treated with 8 mM NGI-1 for HEK293FT
cells and 4 mM NGI-1 for HAP1 cells. RNA was harvested using the Ambion
Cells-to-CT kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 48 hpi for flaviviruses, 24 hpi
for CHIKV and VEEV, and 16 hpi for poliovirus. After the RT reaction,
qPCR was performed, where viral RNA levels were normalized to 18S
RNA levels.
Replicon Assay
The construction of the dengue replicon plasmid and the production of
replicon RNA were previously described (Marceau et al., 2016). 3 mg puri-
fied replicon RNA was mixed with 106 HEK293FT cells in electroporation
buffer,
and
cells
were
electroporated
using

Pulser
Xcell electroporator using the square
wave
protocol (volts
= 120,
pulse length = 1.5 ms, number of pulses = 10, pulse interval = 1.5 s,
cuvette = 1 mm). Electroporated cells were resuspended in cell culture
medium without antibiotics and plated into 96-well plates. 4 mM NGI-1
was added 2 hr after electroporation. Cells were harvested at different
time points and luciferase expression was measured using the Renilla
Luciferase Assay system (Promega).
Immunoblot Assay
Immunoblot assays were performed as previously described (Marceau et al.,
2016).
HEK293 cells were infected with DENV (MOI = 0.5) and treated with
different concentrations of NGI-1 for 52 hr. As a control, cells were treated
with 10 mg/mL tunicamycin for 4 hr before harvest. To detect DENV proteins,
anti-prM (Genetex, GTX128092) at a dilution of 1:1,000, anti-E (Genetex,
GTX127277) at a dilution of 1:2,000, and anti-NS1 (Genetex, GTX630556)
at a dilution of 1:2,000 were used. As a loading control, anti-p84 (Genetex,
GTX70220) at a dilution of 1:5,000 was used.
Flow Cytometry
Raji-DC-SIGN cells were infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 0.5 PFUs per cell
and cultured untreated or treated with 8 mM NGI-1. 60 hpi cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosci-
ences). Viral antigen was stained using anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody
(clone D1-4G2-4-15, EMD Millipore) at 1:800 in Perm/Wash buffer for
30 min, followed by 2 washes and by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG
Alexa 488 (Life Technologies) at 1:500 for 20 min. After 3 washes, samples
were measured using a BD LRSFortessa LX-20, and data were analyzed using
FlowJo 9.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism 7 was used to analyze data. Untreated and treated conditions
were compared using unpaired t test. Curve fits were performed by nonlinear
regression with log(inhibitor) versus normalized response and variable slope.
