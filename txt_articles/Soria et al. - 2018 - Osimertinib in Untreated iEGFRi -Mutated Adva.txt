Abstract: BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation, irreversible epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI-sensitizing
and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. We compared osimertinib with standard EGFR-TKIs in pa-
tients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 556 patients with previously un-
treated, EGFR mutation-positive (exon 19 deletion or L858R) advanced NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio to receive
either osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or a standard EGFR-TKI (gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg
once daily or erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed
progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was significantly longer with
osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio for disease pro-
gression or death, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.57; P<0.001). The objective response rate
was similar in the two groups: 80% with osimertinib and 76% with standard EGFR-TKIs (odds ratio,
1.27; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.90; P=0.24). The median duration of response was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.8 to
22.0) with osimertinib versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 9.8) with standard EGFR-TKIs. Data on overall
survival were immature at the interim analysis (25% maturity). The survival rate at 18 months was 83%
(95% CI, 78 to 87) with osimertinib and 71% (95% CI, 65 to 76) with standard EGFR-TKIs (hazard ratio
for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P=0.007 [nonsignificant in the interim analysis]). Adverse events
of grade 3 or higher were less frequent with osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (34% vs. 45%).
CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib showed efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR-TKIs in the first-line
treatment of EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC, with a similar safety profile and lower rates of
serious adverse events. (Funded by AstraZeneca; FLAURA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02296125 .).

BACKGROUND
Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI–sensitiz-
ing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. We compared osimertinib with standard 
EGFR-TKIs in patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation–positive advanced 
non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 556 patients with previously 
untreated, EGFR mutation–positive (exon 19 deletion or L858R) advanced NSCLC in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or a standard 
EGFR-TKI (gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg once daily or erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg 
once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.
RESULTS
The median progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than 
with standard EGFR-TKIs (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio for disease pro-
gression or death, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.57; P<0.001). The objec-
tive response rate was similar in the two groups: 80% with osimertinib and 76% with 
standard EGFR-TKIs (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.90; P 
= 
0.24). The median dura-
tion of response was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.8 to 22.0) with osimertinib versus 8.5 
months (95% CI, 7.3 to 9.8) with standard EGFR-TKIs. Data on overall survival were 
immature at the interim analysis (25% maturity). The survival rate at 18 months was 
83% (95% CI, 78 to 87) with osimertinib and 71% (95% CI, 65 to 76) with standard 
EGFR-TKIs (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P 
= 
0.007 [nonsignificant 
in the interim analysis]). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were less frequent with 
osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (34% vs. 45%).
CONCLUSIONS
Osimertinib showed efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR-TKIs in the first-line 
treatment of EGFR mutation–positive advanced NSCLC, with a similar safety profile and 
lower rates of serious adverse events. (Funded by AstraZeneca; FLAURA ClinicalTrials

T
he current standard of care for 
patients with locally advanced or meta-
static non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
harboring epidermal growth factor receptor ty-
rosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)–sensitizing 
mutations is treatment with a first-generation or 
second-generation EGFR-TKI such as gefitinib, 
erlotinib, or afatinib.1,2 Treatment with EGFR-TKIs 
in this patient population has extended progres-
sion-free survival relative to chemotherapy as ini-
tial therapy3-5; a meta-analysis of six randomized 
trials involving patients who had not previously 
received treatment showed a median progression-
free survival of 11.0 months with EGFR-TKIs 
(gefitinib or erlotinib) versus 5.6 months with 
chemotherapy.6 The phase 3 studies of first-gen-
eration and second-generation EGFR-TKIs showed 
a median progression-free survival of 9 to 13 
months,3-5,7-10 and the EGFR p.Thr790Met point 
mutation (EGFR T790M) is detected in 50% or more 
of the patients who have disease progression.11,12
Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation, ir-
reversible EGFR-TKI that selectively inhibits both 
EGFR-TKI–sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance 
mutations, with lower activity against wild-type 
EGFR.13,14 On the basis of positive results from 
the AURA clinical program,15-17 osimertinib is ap-
proved worldwide for the treatment of patients 
with metastatic T790M-positive NSCLC who have 
disease progression during or after EGFR-TKI 
therapy. Preclinical data support the ability of 
osimertinib to cross the blood–brain barrier and 
penetrate the central nervous system (CNS).18 Pre-
vious studies in which osimertinib was given as a 
second-line treatment have shown superior effi-
cacy in the CNS as compared with platinum che-
motherapy.15,19
Preclinical data13,20,21 and phase 1 clinical data 
from the AURA trial22 suggest that osimertinib 
may also be an effective first-line therapy for 
patients with EGFR mutation–positive advanced 
NSCLC. A median progression-free survival of 
20.5 months was recently reported in a group of 
60 patients with previously untreated EGFR mu-
tation–positive advanced NSCLC who received 
osimertinib (80 mg or 160 mg daily).22 The 
phase 3 FLAURA trial assessed the efficacy and 
safety of osimertinib in patients with previously 
untreated EGFR mutation–positive advanced NSCLC 
as compared with the standard EGFR-TKIs, gefi-
tinib or erlotinib.
Methods
Trial Patients
Patients had locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, 
had not previously received treatment for ad-
vanced disease, and were eligible to receive first-
line treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. Local 
or central confirmation of the EGFR exon 19 
deletion (Ex19del) or p.Leu858Arg (L858R) EGFR 
mutation, alone or co-occurring with other EGFR 
mutations, was required. Patients with CNS me-
tastases whose condition was neurologically stable 
were eligible. Any previous definitive treatment or 
glucocorticoid therapy had to be completed at least 
2 weeks before initiation of the trial treatment. 
Complete eligibility criteria are provided in the 
trial protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
Trial Oversight
The trial was conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines (as defined by the In-
ternational Conference on Harmonisation), appli-
cable regulatory requirements, and the policy on 
bioethics and human biologic samples of the trial 
sponsor, AstraZeneca. This trial was funded by 
the sponsor and was designed by the principal 
investigators (the first and last authors) and the 
sponsor. The sponsor was responsible for the col-
lection and analysis of the data and had a role in 
data interpretation. The authors vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and the data 
analyses and adherence to the protocol. The first 
draft of the manuscript was written by the first 
and last authors, with medical-writing support 
funded by the sponsor; all the authors reviewed 
the manuscript, provided input, and made the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publica-
tion. The authors had full access to the data in the 
trial. The protocol, amendments, and statistical 
analysis plan are available at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatment
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were 
stratified according to tumor EGFR mutation sta-
tus (Ex19del or L858R) and race (Asian or non-
Asian) and were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive either oral osimertinib (at a dose of 
80 mg once daily) or a standard oral EGFR-TKI 
(gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg once daily or erlo-

Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced NSCLC
tinib at a dose of 150 mg once daily). Treatment 
continued until disease progression, the develop-
ment of unacceptable side effects, or withdrawal 
of consent. Treatment beyond the point of dis-
ease progression (as assessed by the investigator 
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1) was allowed 
as long as there was continued clinical benefit, as 
judged by the investigator. A protocol amendment 
on April 13, 2015, allowed patients who had been 
assigned to a standard EGFR-TKI to cross over 
to open-label osimertinib after confirmation of 
objective disease progression by blinded indepen-
dent central review and post-progression docu-
mentation of T790M-positive mutation status by 
means of plasma or tissue testing (local or central). 
Intervening anticancer therapy was not allowed 
before crossover to open-label osimertinib.
Trial End Points
The primary end point was the duration of pro-
gression-free survival as determined by investi-
gator assessments, according to RECIST, version 
1.1. A sensitivity analysis of progression-free sur-
vival was performed on the basis of data from 
blinded independent central review of RECIST 
assessments for all the patients. Secondary end 
points included overall survival, the objective re-
sponse rate, the duration of response, the disease-
control rate (rate of complete response, partial 
response, or stable disease lasting ≥6 weeks be-
fore any disease-progression event), the depth of 
response (change in target-lesion size from base-
line), and safety.
Trial Assessments
Tumor assessments occurred at baseline, every 
6 weeks (±1 week) for 18 months, then every 
 
12 weeks (±1 week) until disease progression. 
Baseline brain imaging was mandated only in pa-
tients with known or suspected CNS metastases, 
with follow-up imaging in patients with confirmed 
CNS metastases.
Progression-free survival was defined as the 
time from randomization to objective disease pro-
gression or death from any cause in the absence 
of progression, irrespective of withdrawal from 
the trial or treatment with another anticancer 
therapy before progression. Adverse events were 
graded with the use of the National Cancer In-
stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0. Additional details on tumor 
assessments, secondary efficacy end points, and 
assessment of adverse events are included in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Statistical Analysis
The full analysis set included all randomly as-
signed patients and was used for efficacy assess-
ments. Adverse events were assessed in the 
safety analysis set, consisting of all the patients 
who received at least one dose of randomly as-
signed treatment.
A log-rank test, stratified according to race 
(Asian vs. non-Asian) and mutation type (Ex19del 
vs. L858R), was used to compare progression-free 
survival between treatment groups, with applica-
tion of the Breslow approach to handle tied events. 
Data for patients who had not had a progression 
event or had not died at the time of the analysis 
were censored at the time of the last RECIST as-
sessment that could be evaluated.
We determined that approximately 359 events 
of progression or death in a total of 530 randomly 
assigned patients would provide at least 90% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.71 at a two-
sided alpha level of 5%. The data cutoff date was 
June 12, 2017.
Results
Patients and Treatment
From December 2014 through March 2016, a total 
of 994 patients were screened, across 132 sites in 
29 countries, and 556 were randomly assigned to 
trial treatment (279 to osimertinib and 277 to a 
standard EGFR-TKI) (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Baseline characteris-
tics were well balanced between the trial groups 
and in line with the intended population per the 
protocol (Table 1). All randomly assigned patients 
received at least one dose of trial treatment. At 
the time of data cutoff, the median duration of 
total treatment exposure was 16.2 months (range, 
0.1 to 27.4) for patients receiving osimertinib and 
11.5 months (range, 0 to 26.2) for those receiv-
ing a standard EGFR-TKI. A total of 141 patients 
(51%) in the osimertinib group and 64 (23%) in 
the standard EGFR-TKI group continued to re-
ceive trial treatment.
At the time of data cutoff, an event of RECIST-
defined progression or death had occurred in

136 patients (49%) in the osimertinib group and 
206 (74%) in the standard EGFR-TKI group. The 
percentage of patients who continued treatment 
beyond RECIST-defined progression was similar 
in the two groups (67% in the osimertinib group 
and 70% in the standard EGFR-TKI group).
After RECIST-defined progression, 82 patients 
(29%) in the osimertinib group and 129 (47%) in 
the standard EGFR-TKI group started a first sub-
sequent anticancer therapy. Of these, 55 patients 
(43%) in the standard EGFR-TKI group received 
osimertinib (48 on crossover and 7 outside of the 
trial as second-line treatment). Further details on 
crossover and subsequent anticancer therapy are

Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced NSCLC
Efficacy
The median progression-free survival was 18.9 
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2 to 21.4) 
in the osimertinib group and 10.2 months 
 
(95% CI, 9.6 to 11.1) in the standard EGFR-TKI 
group (Fig. 1A). The median duration of follow-
up for progression-free survival was 15.0 months 
(range, 0 to 25.1) and 9.7 months (range, 0 to 26.1), 
respectively. Investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival was significantly longer in the osimer-
tinib group than in the standard EGFR-TKI group 
(hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 
0.46; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.57; P<0.001). Kaplan–Meier 
event curves showed early separation between the 
two groups, at the time of the first assessment 
(at 6 weeks). Results for progression-free survival 
as determined by blinded independent central re-
view were consistent with those for investigator-
assessed progression-free survival and are provid-
ed in the Results section in the Supplementary 
Appendix, as are results for post-progression end 
points.
A consistent benefit of osimertinib over stan-
dard EGFR-TKIs with respect to progression-free 
survival was shown across all predefined sub-
groups that were assessed (Fig. 2), including the 
subgroups based on race (Asian vs. non-Asian), 
EGFR mutation type (Ex19del vs. L858R) (Fig. S3A 
and S3B in the Supplementary Appendix), and the 
presence or absence of known or treated CNS me-
tastases at trial entry (Fig. 1B and 1C). Irrespec-
tive of status with respect to known or treated CNS 
metastases at trial entry, events of CNS progression 
were observed in 17 patients (6%) in the osimer-
tinib group and 42 (15%) in the standard EGFR-
TKI group (Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The objective response rate (with response as-
sessed by the investigator) was 80% (95% CI, 75 
to 85) in the osimertinib group and 76% (95% CI, 
70 to 81) in the standard EGFR-TKI group (odds 
ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.90; P 
= 
0.24) (Table 2). 
The disease-control rate was 97% (95% CI, 94 to 
99) versus 92% (95% CI, 89 to 95), respectively 
(odds ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.25 to 6.78; P 
= 
0.01). 
The median best percentage change in target-
lesion size (maximum decrease from baseline, 
or minimum increase from baseline in the ab-
sence of a decrease) was −54.7% (range, −100 to 
61.9) in the osimertinib group versus −48.5% 
(range, −100 to 54.1) in the standard EGFR-TKI 
group (P 
= 
0.003); more information on the depth 
of response is available in the Supplementary 
Appendix, including Figure S4.

Five patients (two in the osimertinib group and three in the standard EGFR-TKI group) had large-cell carcinoma; three 
patients (one in the osimertinib group and two in the standard EGFR-TKI group) had adenosquamous carcinoma; 
and one patient (in the osimertinib group) had a carcinoid tumor.

Visceral metastases were determined programmatically from baseline data for which the disease site was described 
as adrenal, ascites, brain or CNS, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hepatic (including gallbladder), liver, other CNS, 
pancreas, peritoneum, or spleen. Also included were other metastatic sites, such as those occurring in the eye and 
thyroid, as identified as extrathoracic visceral sites by AstraZeneca physicians.

treated CNS metastases at trial entry (Panel C). Also shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival (Panel D). Censored data are 
indicated by tick marks. For the analysis of progression-free survival, data for patients who had not had a progression event or had not 
died at the time of the analysis were censored at the time of their last assessment (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
 
Tumors) that could be evaluated. For the analysis of overall survival, data for any patients who were not known to have died at the time 
of the analysis were censored at the last recorded date that the patient was known to be alive. CI denotes confidence interval, EGFR-TKI 
epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and NC could not be calculated.

Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced NSCLC
Among the patients who had a response to trial 
treatment, an event of disease progression or death 
had occurred in 106 of 223 patients (48%) in the 
osimertinib group and 158 of 210 (75%) in the 
standard EGFR-TKI group at the time of data 
cutoff. The median duration of response was lon-
ger in the osimertinib group (17.2 months [95% 
CI, 13.8 to 22.0]) than in the standard EGFR-TKI 
group (8.5 months [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.8]). In most 
cases, responses were documented at the time of 
the first scan, with a median time to response of 
6.1 weeks (95% CI, 6.0 to 6.1) in the osimertinib 
Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses of Progression-free Survival.
A hazard ratio of less than 1 implies a lower risk of disease progression or death with osimertinib than with standard 
EGFR-TKIs. The Cox proportional-hazards model includes randomly assigned treatment, the subgroup covariate of 
interest, and the treatment-by-subgroup interaction. The size of the circles is proportional to the number of events. 
Overall population analyses are presented from both a Cox proportional-hazards model and the primary analysis 
(U and V statistics from a log-rank test stratified according to EGFR mutation type and race). If there were fewer 
than 20 events in a subgroup, then the analysis was not performed. The shaded area indicates the 95% CI for the 
overall hazard ratio (all patients). EGFR mutation status at randomization was determined by means of a local or 
central test. Data on World Health Organization (WHO) performance status were missing for 1 patient in the stan-
dard EGFR-TKI group. Data on EGFR mutation status determined in circulating tumor DNA were missing for 36 pa-
tients in the osimertinib group and 37 patients in the standard EGFR-TKI group. Data on centrally confirmed EGFR 
mutation status were missing for 21 patients in the osimertinib group and 29 patients in the standard EGFR-TKI group.

confidence interval could be calculated) in the 
standard EGFR-TKI group. In patients with known 
or treated CNS metastases at trial entry, the objec-
tive response rate (with response assessed by the 
investigator) and the median duration of response 
were in line with the values in the overall popu-
lation (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At the time of data cutoff, the median overall 
survival could not be calculated in either treatment 
group (data maturity, 25%). A higher percentage 
of patients in the osimertinib group than in the 
standard EGFR-TKI group were alive at 12 months 
and 18 months. At 18 months, the estimated per-
centage of patients who were alive was 83%

*  
Efficacy analyses included all randomly assigned patients (full analysis set). CI denotes confidence interval, and NC 
could not be calculated.
†  
Tumor responses were assessed by the investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
version 1.1.
‡  
The disease-control rate is the proportion of patients who had a complete response, a partial response, or stable dis-
ease lasting at least 6 weeks before any disease-progression event.
§  
The time to tumor response was calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method from the date of randomization 
to the date of the first documentation of a partial or complete response. Per the protocol, RECIST assessments occurred 
every 6 weeks (±1 week) for 18 months, then every 12 weeks (±1 week) until disease progression.
¶  
The duration of response was calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method from the date of the first documented 
response until the date of documented disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression.
‖  
Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.

Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced NSCLC
71% (95% CI, 65 to 76) in the standard EGFR-TKI 
group (Table 2). A total of 141 patients had died: 
58 (21%) in the osimertinib group and 83 (30%) 
in the standard EGFR-TKI group (hazard ratio for 
death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P 
= 
0.007) 
(Fig. 1D). For statistical significance at this interim 
analysis of overall survival, a P value of less than 
0.0015 (determined by the O’Brien–Fleming ap-
proach) was required.
Safety and Adverse Events
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported 
in fewer patients in the osimertinib group than in 
the standard EGFR-TKI group (34% vs. 45%). These 
events are summarized in Table S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The most commonly reported adverse events 
due to any cause (treatment-related or not) were 
rash or acne (58% in the osimertinib group and 
78% in the standard EGFR-TKI group), diarrhea 
(58% and 57%, respectively), and dry skin (36% 
in each group) (Table 3). Adverse events that were 
considered by the investigator to be possibly re-
lated to a trial drug are reported in Table S7 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Cardiac effects (changes in QT interval) were 
reported in a higher percentage of patients in the 
osimertinib group (29 patients [10%]) than in the 
standard EGFR-TKI group (13 patients [5%]). Across 
groups, the majority of adverse events in this cat-
egory were of grade 1 (11 patients [4%] in the 
osimertinib group and 7 [3%] in the standard 
EGFR-TKI group) or grade 2 (12 patients [4%] in 
the osimertinib group and 3 [1%] in the standard 
EGFR-TKI group). There were no fatal cases of 
torsades des pointes or prolongation of the QT 
interval in either treatment group. Analysis of pro-
longation of the QT interval that was identified on 
electrocardiography showed a baseline median 
QT interval corrected for heart rate according to 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) of 411.8 msec in the 
osimertinib group and 408.0 msec in the stan-
dard EGFR-TKI group. In both treatment groups, 
a maximum change from baseline in the median 
QTcF was reported at week 12 (17.7 msec in the 
osimertinib group and 10.0 msec in the standard 
EGFR-TKI group), after which QTcF values re-
mained generally stable across both groups. Fur-
ther details on cardiac effects are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Adverse events of interstitial lung disease were 
reported in 11 patients (4%) in the osimertinib 
group and 6 (2%) in the standard EGFR-TKI group. 
No fatal events of interstitial lung disease were 
reported in either group. In the osimertinib 
group, the outcome of interstitial lung disease 
was reported as “recovered” for 7 of 11 patients 
and “recovering” for the remaining 4 patients. 
In the standard EGFR-TKI group, the outcome was 
reported as “recovered” for 4 of 6 patients, “re-
covering” for 1 patient, and “not recovered” for 
1 patient.
Overall, serious adverse events were reported 
in 60 patients (22%) in the osimertinib group 
and 70 (25%) in the standard EGFR-TKI group 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). One 
patient (in the osimertinib group) had a serious 
adverse event of prolongation of the QT interval. 
Serious adverse events of interstitial lung disease 
occurred in 6 patients in the osimertinib group 
and 4 in the standard EGFR-TKI group.
Fatal adverse events occurred in 6 patients (2%) 
in the osimertinib group (pneumonia, respiratory 
tract infection, cerebral infarction, myocardial in-
farction, pulmonary embolism, and intestinal is-
chemia in 1 patient each) and 10 patients (4%) in 
the standard EGFR-TKI group (sepsis in 2 patients; 
pneumonia in 1; endocarditis in 1; cognitive disor-
der and pneumonia in 1; peripheral-artery occlu-
sion in 1; dyspnea in 1; hemoptysis in 1; diarrhea, 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, 
and circulatory collapse in 1; and “death” [the 
adverse event was not further specified] in 1). 
None of the fatal adverse events were considered 
to be possibly related to osimertinib, and one 
fatal adverse event (of diarrhea) was considered 
to be possibly related to standard EGFR-TKIs.
Osimertinib was associated with a somewhat 
lower rate of adverse events leading to permanent 
discontinuation than were standard EGFR-TKIs 
(in 37 patients [13%] and 49 patients [18%], re-
spectively). The frequency of dose interruption 
(25% in the osimertinib group and 24% in the 
standard EGFR-TKI group) and dose reduction 
(4% and 5%, respectively) due to adverse events 
was similar in the two groups.
Discussion
The results of the FLAURA trial show that in pa-
tients with previously untreated EGFR mutation–
positive advanced NSCLC, osimertinib treatment 
resulted in significantly longer progression-free 
survival than did standard EGFR-TKIs. The me-

Listed are adverse events that were reported in at least 10% of the patients in any group. Safety analyses included all the patients who received at least one dose of a trial drug (safety 
analysis set). Some patients had more than one adverse event. ECG denotes electrocardiography.
†  
This category represents a grouped term for the event. If a patient had multiple preferred-term events within a specific grouped-term adverse event, then the maximum grade (according

Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced NSCLC
dian progression-free survival in the osimertinib 
group was 18.9 months, with a 54% lower risk of 
disease progression or death than in the standard 
EGFR-TKI group. Although there was no statistical 
comparison of safety data, the safety profile of 
osimertinib was similar to that of standard EGFR-
TKIs, but with somewhat lower rates of adverse 
events of grade 3 or higher, despite a longer me-
dian duration of exposure with osimertinib. These 
data suggest that osimertinib is superior to cur-
rent standard EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy.3-5,23
Our trial population had demographic and 
clinical characteristics that were in line with those 
of the global population of patients with EGFR 
mutation–positive advanced NSCLC. The progres-
sion-free survival benefit with osimertinib was 
observed across all predefined patient subgroups, 
including in patients with or without known or 
treated CNS metastases at trial entry. This find-
ing is consistent with those of previous reports 
showing both systemic and CNS efficacy of osimer-
tinib in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC and 
CNS metastases.15,17 Patients with NSCLC who have 
CNS metastases tend to have a worse prognosis 
than those who have no such metastases,24 and 
although early-generation EGFR-TKIs show better 
CNS efficacy than chemotherapy, a high frequen-
cy of CNS disease progression has been report-
ed.25,26 In our trial, the frequency of events of 
CNS progression at the time of this analysis was 
lower in the osimertinib group than in the stan-
dard EGFR-TKI group. However, some cases of 
asymptomatic progression may not have been 
detected, because only patients with brain metas-
tases were required to have regular brain scans.
The median progression-free survival in the 
standard EGFR-TKI group in our trial is consistent 
with that in previous clinical trials of earlier-gener-
ation EGFR-TKIs (approximately 9 to 13 months).3-5 
Recently, the ARCHER 1050 trial (dacomitinib vs. 
gefitinib) showed a superior median progression-
free survival with dacomitinib, an investigational 
EGFR inhibitor, in patients with previously un-
treated EGFR mutation–positive advanced NSCLC.27 
Patients with brain metastases were excluded from 
that trial.
At this interim analysis of overall survival 
(data maturity, 25%), the overall survival benefit 
did not reach formal statistical significance for 
osimertinib. However, the initial signal for a po-
tential survival benefit with osimertinib (hazard 
ratio for death, 0.63) is encouraging and is sup-
ported by the early separation of the Kaplan–
Meier curves of overall survival.
The most common mechanism of resistance 
to early-generation EGFR-TKIs when they are used 
as first-line therapy is the T790M mutation11,12; 
other resistance mechanisms that have been re-
ported include amplification of HER2, MET, and 
MAPK1; mutation of PIK3CA and BRAF; and small-
cell transformation.28 Mechanisms of resistance 
to osimertinib that have been identified in patients 
with T790M-positive NSCLC after EGFR-TKI treat-
ment include acquired EGFR mutations (e.g., C797S), 
MET and HER2 amplification, and small-cell trans-
formation.29-32 Mechanisms of resistance to osimer-
tinib when used as first-line therapy remain to be 
fully characterized, although an analysis of ge-
nomic mechanisms of resistance in nine patients 
with previously untreated EGFR mutation–posi-
tive advanced NSCLC who received osimertinib 
in the phase 1 component of the AURA trial 
showed no cases of acquired T790M mutation.22 
Tissue-based analyses of resistance mechanisms 
will be necessary to fully characterize resistance 
to osimertinib. Analysis of post-progression plas-
ma samples from participants in our trial may 
provide additional insights into mechanisms of 
resistance. The early separation of the Kaplan–
Meier curves of progression-free survival (at the 
time of the first assessment, at 6 weeks) in our 
trial could indicate a lower frequency of early 
resistance to osimertinib than of early resistance 
to standard EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy. In 
the ARCHER 1050 trial (dacomitinib vs. gefitinib) 
and the LUX-Lung 7 trial (afatinib vs. gefitinib), 
the Kaplan–Meier curves of progression-free sur-
vival separated at approximately 6 and 11 months, 
respectively,23,27 findings that suggest the pres-
ence of a subpopulation of patients in both treat-
ment groups with intrinsic or early acquired resis-
tance to a trial drug.
Our trial had several strengths. These include 
a double-blind trial design, the enrollment of pa-
tients worldwide, the use of the two most com-
monly used EGFR-TKIs for the standard EGFR-TKI 
group, independent verification of radiographic 
outcomes to confirm the results derived from 
investigator assessment, central confirmation of 
mutation status in the majority of the patients, 
the inclusion of patients with CNS metastases, 
and the option to cross over to osimertinib for 
patients with T790M-positive tumors after progres-
sion during standard EGFR-TKI therapy.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A limitation of the trial is the exclusion of 
afatinib from the comparator group. At the time 
of trial initiation, afatinib was not widely used 
and had not been made available as a global stan-
dard-of-care EGFR-TKI. However, clinical out-
comes with afatinib are well characterized, and 
a recent meta-analysis concludes that there is no 
difference in efficacy among afatinib, erlotinib, 
and gefitinib.33 A further limitation is that mag-
netic resonance imaging of the head was not man-
dated for all the patients. This limits the ability to 
detect asymptomatic brain metastases.
In conclusion, osimertinib treatment resulted 
in longer progression-free survival than did current 
standard first-line therapy for EGFR mutation–posi-
tive NSCLC, with a similar safety profile.
