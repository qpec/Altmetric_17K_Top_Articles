ABSTRACT 
Background: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is traditionally considered as 
primarily affecting the right ventricle. Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins account for 
40-60% of cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations are scant and mostly non gene-specific. 
Accordingly, we assessed the genotype-phenotype correlation for desmoplakin (DSP) missense and 
non-missense mutations causing ARVC. 
Methods and Results: We analyzed 27 ARVC patients carrying a missense or a non-missense DSP 
mutation, with complete clinical assessment. The two groups were compared for clinical parameters, 
basic demographics such as sex, age at diagnosis, age at disease onset, as well as prevalence of 
symptoms and arrhythmic events. Missense DSP variants were present in 10 patients and non-
missense in 17. Mean age at diagnosis and at first arrhythmic event did not differ between the two 
groups. Also the prevalence of symptoms, either major (60% vs 59%, p=1) or all (80% vs 88%, 
p=0.61), did not differ. By contrast, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was significantly more prevalent 
among patients with non-missense mutations (76.5% vs 10%, p=0.001), who were also much more 
likely to have a structural LV involvement by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) (92% vs 22%, 
p=0.001). 
Conclusions: For ARVC patients, both missense and non-missense DSP mutations carry a high 
arrhythmic risk. Non-missense mutations are specifically associated with left-dominant forms. The 
presence of DSP non-missense mutations should alert to the likely development of LV dysfunction. 
These findings highlight the clinical relevance of genetic testing even after the clinical diagnosis of 
ARVC and the growing clinical impact of genetics.

INTRODUCTION 
Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disease 
characterized by risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and fibro-fatty replacement primarily of the right 
ventricle but, occasionally, also of the left ventricle (LV) (1-3). Mutations in the five major 
desmosomal genes account for 40-60% of cases and there is highly variable phenotypic expression and 
incomplete penetrance (2). The existing genotype-phenotype correlation studies (4-12) are, with one 
notable exception (11), of limited size, thus not allowing firm conclusions. Desmoplakin (DSP) 
mutations account for 2-12% of ARVC cases (11,13-15). However, the number of patients with DSP 
mutations is extremely small in all published reports. As an example, in the largest such study to date 
(11), which involved 577 genotyped ARVC patients, there were only 9 index patients with DSP 
mutations, definite clinical diagnosis, and follow-up data. 
Three statements, reported in the literature, are of interest but are based on very small 
numbers. One is that DSP mutations seem to be more often associated with a predominant LV 
phenotype or biventricular involvement (4,8,16-21); another is that DSP mutations (4,11), especially 
truncations (22), are associated with a much more penetrant phenotype with SCD often as first disease 
manifestation; the third, and more controversial, is that ARVC missense mutations could be more 
severe than non-missense mutations (10,23). 
The genotype-phenotype correlation, as could be expected, seems to differ according to the 
specific type of genetic disease and the respective underlying genetic substrate that is being affected. 
In channelopathies, missense mutations are usually associated with greater clinical severity, since they 
often exert a dominant-negative effect on wild-type channels, thereby altering their biophysical 
properties and functionality, whereas non-missense mutations may cause haploinsufficiency with 
relatively minor clinical consequences (24,25). 
In cardiomyopathies such as ARVC, missense mutations seem to mostly affect protein 
stability, inter-domain contacts and intra-protein interactions, while preserving the overall dimensional 
structure, whereas non-missense mutations seem to mostly result in decreased localization of the 
protein in the intercalated disk (26-29).

With the goal of identifying potential phenotypic differences between carriers of missense and 
non-missense DSP mutations we have assembled the largest group so far of ARVC probands with a 
DSP mutation. 
 
METHODS 
Study Population and Clinical Assessment 
The study population included 27 probands fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for ARVC and 
carrying a pathogenic or possibly pathogenic variant in the DSP gene. We limited the study to 
probands in order to avoid the confounding consequence of the incomplete penetrance which would 
follow the inclusion of family members. All patients were diagnosed according to the revised Task 
Force Criteria (2) at the Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust (UCLH), 
London, UK and at the Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias of Genetic Origin, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico 
Italiano, Milan, Italy. 
The assessment included clinical history, pedigree evaluation, 12-lead and signal-averaged 
ECG (SAECG), two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) with detailed right ventricular (RV) views, 
maximal exercise stress test, 24 hour ambulatory ECG monitoring and CMR with late gadolinium 
enhancement (LGE) using a dedicated protocol (30). Symptoms included syncope of likely arrhythmic 
origin, non-sustained and sustained ventricular arrhythmias recorded during 24 hour ambulatory ECG 
monitoring and/or exercise stress test, aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) and implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (ICD) appropriate interventions. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) was 
defined as 3 or more consecutive ventricular beats with an RR interval of <600 ms (>120 bpm) and 
lasting <30 seconds, while if lasting 30 seconds was defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia 
(VT); ICD appropriate interventions were defined as any ventricular event treated by the device with 
anti-tachycardia 
pacing 
and/or 
shock. 
Symptoms 
were 
subdivided 
in 
major 
(syncope/VT/VF/ACA/ICD appropriate shocks) and minor (NSVT). Patients with atypical chest pain, 
palpitations and/or syncope suggestive of vasovagal origin were considered asymptomatic. 
Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline at a paper speed of 25 mm/s. 
Parameters evaluated from basal electrocardiogram were: PR, QRS and QT intervals, QRS voltages,

7 
flattened/inverted T waves, epsilon waves, QTc (Bazett). The presence of flattened/inverted T waves 
and low QRS voltages was separately evaluated as to their occurrence in anterior leads (V1-V3), 
lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-V6), inferior leads (II, III, aVF). Flattened/inverted T waves and low QRS 
voltages were considered diffuse when present in ≥2 lead groups. All electrocardiographic parameters 
were manually measured by a single experienced cardiologist (SC) blinded to the patients’ genetic 
status. 
Cardiac structural and functional abnormalities were defined by echocardiography in all and 
by CMR in 20 patients, according to the Task Force Criteria (2). Left ventricular dysfunction was 
defined as ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 55% (31). 
All patients had ECG, SAECG, echocardiogram performed at baseline and during yearly 
follow-up. Exercise testing and 24hr Holter recordings were performed at baseline in all patients and 
repeated according to the clinical status of each patient. For the purpose of this study, age at the onset 
of arrhythmic symptoms was considered separately from the age at the time of diagnosis and from the 
age at the onset of LV dysfunction. 
All patients provided written informed consent. The study protocol conforms to the ethical 
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committees. 
Genetic Analysis 
Genetic testing for the main ARVC genes (PKP2, DSP, DSC2, DSG2, JUP, TMEM43) was 
performed through Next-Generation Sequencing (TruSeq Custom Amplicon, MiSeq platform, 
Illumina and SureSelect Target Enrichment, Agilent Technologies, HiSeq platform, Illumina) as 
previously described (32,33). All significant variants identified were then confirmed with Sanger 
sequencing. The patients were not tested for the newly discovered CDH2 gene (34). 
Genetic variants in the DSP gene were evaluated according to their frequency in the general 
population (Exome Aggregation Consortium, Exome Variant Server, 1,000 Genomes Project) (35-37), 
presence or absence in human genetic variants databases (38-41), literature description, localization 
and conservation. 
For the purpose of the study, and considering ARVC disease prevalence, common (minor 
allele frequency >0.01%) and well-established, according to literature, benign variants were excluded

from further analyses. Only rare genetic variants (minor allele frequency <0.01%) expected to affect 
the protein sequence were considered. These were then stringently classified as pathogenic or possibly 
pathogenic. Pathogenic were considered either i) non-missense variants that are predicted to generate 
radical modifications of the protein sequence (i.e. frameshift insertions or deletions, splice site 
substitutions) and absent in the general population databases or ii) missense variants already reported 
more than once in literature as clearly associated with ARVC and absent in the general population 
databases. Possibly pathogenic were considered either i) missense variants already reported only once 
in literature and/or in genetic variants databases in association with ARVC and absent in the general 
population databases, or ii) missense variants identified in heterozygous state in the general population 
no more than 2 times with no other information available and affecting highly conserved residues. 
Among the 27 probands with a DSP mutation, 6 were also carrying a second pathogenic or 
possibly pathogenic desmosomal variant. 
Statistical Analyses 
 
Analyses were performed using the statistical software SPSS Statistics, version 21.0 (IBM Co, 
Armonk, NY). Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) or as 
median and interquartile range (IQR, 25th-75th percentile) whenever the distribution was skewed. 
Group comparisons in continuous variables were performed with the Student t test or with the Mann-
Whitney U test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as absolute (n) and relative 
frequencies (%) and compared among genetic groups with the Fisher exact test or χ2 test, as 
appropriate. In taking into account the potentially confounding influence on phenotype of the double 
variants, a sensitivity analysis was performed with all the comparisons repeated upon exclusion of the 
6 patients. A 2-sided p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS 
Study population 
The study population included 27 clinically confirmed ARVC probands (see suppl. Table 1), 
in whom genetic analysis identified 25 extremely rare (minor allele frequency<0.01%) DSP gene 
variants (see suppl. Table 2). Twenty-one patients carried a pathogenic variant (either missense or 
non-missense), while 6 carried a possibly pathogenic variant. All the possibly pathogenic variants 
were missense. Non-missense variants were found in 17 patients and missense variants in 10 patients. 
Most variants clustered in the head of the DSP protein (Figure 1). There were no significant 
differences in basal characteristics of patients according to the type of DSP variant (Table 1). In total, 
females were slightly overrepresented (16, 59%) and all probands but one (Afro-Caribbean) were 
Caucasians (26, 96%). No skin or hair abnormalities were observed in any of the DSP mutation carrier 
patients. The patients were referred to us because of symptoms (16, 59%) or after SCD of a family 
member (11, 41%). During the clinical workout, a history for SCD and/or a previous diagnosis of 
ARVC among first or second-degree family members was ascertained in 12 probands referred for 
symptoms. Therefore, in 23/27 (85%) patients a positive family history was detected and it was 
similarly present in the two genetic groups (70% vs 94%, p=0.13). Also, mean age at diagnosis was 
comparable between missense and non-missense mutation carriers (41.5±10 vs 44±11 years, p=0.52).  
Symptoms 
Table 1 shows that the prevalence of symptomatic patients was similar among missense and 
non-missense carriers (80% vs 88%, p=0.61) and this was true also for either major (6/10, 60% vs 
10/17, 59%) or minor arrhythmic events (2/10, 20% vs 5/17, 29%, p=0.68). The LV ejection fraction 
at the time of arrhythmic events was preserved in both groups while being slightly, but significantly, 
higher in missense carrier patients (63±6 % vs 55±7 %, p=0.015). Age at appearance of arrhythmias 
did not differ between missense and non-missense mutation carriers, even in the subgroup of 16 
referred for symptoms.  
Electrocardiogram, Signal-Averaged ECG and Holter Recording 
The majority of patients in both missense and non-missense carrier groups presented with 
diffusely inverted/flattened T waves. Similarly, SAECG was positive in the majority of patients in

both groups. No statistically significant differences were observed in the parameters considered (see 
suppl. Table 3). No differences were observed between the two groups on ECG 24-hour Holter 
recordings parameters (see suppl. Table 3). 
Echocardiogram 
Table 2 shows that there were no differences in the RV dimensions at presentation on echocardiogram. 
Although not statistically significant, a trend towards a lower LV ejection fraction was observed in the 
non-missense mutation carriers (50±12 vs 60±13%, p=0.07). Fourteen (52%) patients developed LV 
dysfunction. The occurrence of LV dysfunction was clearly more prevalent among patients with non-
missense mutations (76.5% vs 10%, p=0.001). The only patient with a missense variant who 
developed LV dysfunction did it at age 72. No patient in either group has progressed to functional 
class NYHA III-IV or undergone heart transplantation during a median follow up time of 80 months 
(IQR 30-118). 
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance 
A standardized ARVC CMR imaging protocol was performed at a mean age of 44± 12 years 
in 22 /27 (81%) patients for the detection of both myocardial fibrosis by LGE and fatty infiltration. In 
one patient the CMR was performed in another Center and data are not available, while in the 4 
remaining subjects, a previously implanted ICD precluded the examination. A significantly higher 
percentage of positive findings at either CMR parameter evaluation was found among non-missense 
mutation carriers compared to missense mutation carriers (12/13, 92% vs 2/9, 22%, respectively, 
p=0.001) (Table 3). This difference was primarily due to the presence of LGE that indicated a 
significantly more frequent LV involvement in 11/13 (85%) non-missense carrier patients compared to 
1/9 (11%) missense mutation carriers. In particular, in the non-missense subset this overrepresented 
left ventricular involvement had a predominant isolated LV pattern (6/11, 55%), which was not 
present in any of the missense patients. Conversely, the detection of ventricular fat was not 
significantly different between the two genetic groups.

Cascade genetic screening, performed so far in 8 families, has led to the identification of 28 
genotype-positive family members. The clinical evaluation was completed in 25 of 28 and 14 of them 
(56%), all with a non-missense variant, showed signs of left ventricular involvement. 
Sensitivity analysis 
 
In addition to their primary DSP gene mutation, 6 patients carried another desmosomal 
pathogenic or possibly pathogenic variant (4 PKP2, 1 DSC2 and 1 DSP ) (see suppl. Table 4). After 
their exclusion from the entire study population (4 of 10 DSP missense mutation carriers and 2 of 17 
DSP non-missense mutation carriers), all results, including the CMR finding, were confirmed (see 
suppl. Table 5 for details). With respect to the arrhythmic events, all these 6 patients had an 
arrhythmic phenotype as one would expect in double-mutation carriers. 
 
DISCUSSION 
The present study, despite the relatively small absolute numbers, represents so far the largest 
collection of ARVC probands carrying a DSP mutation and the first to examine clinical differences 
between carriers of missense vs non-missense DSP variants. This allows us to make some credible 
statements about genotype-phenotype correlations in carriers of DSP mutations. There are several 
main findings. LV dysfunction and LV structural involvement are significantly more common in 
carriers of non-missense mutations, in agreement with previous suggestions (5,6,17,19,22). There is no 
difference between carriers of missense and non-missense mutations as arrhythmic events are 
concerned, at variance with previous reports (10,22,23). Similarly, and in agreement with a recent 
publication (11), nothing in our data supports previous claims that missense mutations could be more 
clinically severe than non-missense mutations (10,23). 
DSP Mutations and Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
ARVC is a disease whose original definition dates back to the early 80s (42) and has been 
traditionally considered as an inherited disorder primarily affecting the right ventricle. Although 
substantial LV involvement had been reported in several patients already in 1997 (1,43), only more 
recently it has been established that, besides the classical right-sided disease pattern, the disease may

present with a phenotypic expression broader than previously anticipated and encompassing 
biventricular or even predominantly LV forms (6). 
Significant LV involvement in the setting of DSP mutations has been observed since the first 
attempts to correlate genotype and phenotype in ARVC, with 2 out of 4 carriers of distinct DSP 
mutations exhibiting LV abnormalities (4). Although in ARVC the LV is often affected after the RV 
has developed a significant dysfunction, in a number of cases the LV is predominantly affected 
already early on in the disease course, exhibiting features of dilation, systolic impairment, with no or 
modest RV involvement (8). This is referred to as the left-dominant form of ARVC. 
Recently, DSP mutations have been often associated with predominant LV or biventricular 
involvement (4,6,8,11,16-22). It has been suggested that, among all DSP mutations, those which are 
non-missense are often associated with left dominant or biventricular forms (6,17). Even in the initial 
clinical descriptions of DSP mutation carriers (4), only the carriers of non-missense mutations had an 
early LV involvement (17). This observation has been further replicated, with small numbers, in other 
studies reporting on single patients (17,19) or on a few more than a dozen missense and non-missense 
DSP mutation carriers within a population of genotyped ARVC probands (6). 
We present the largest group of patients to date with a clear ARVC phenotype associated with 
DSP mutations, carrying 26 variants, 17 non-missense and 9 missense. Non-missense carriers had 
more structural involvement compared to missense carriers. This was well shown by the 
echocardiogram and tissue characterization performed with CMR. Particularly, LV systolic function at 
presentation was impaired in the vast majority of the non-missense carriers, while it was preserved in 
all missense carriers. LV involvement was more prominent in non-missense carriers both at 
echocardiogram and CMR. On the echocardiogram, LV systolic function was preserved in all but one 
missense carriers; on CMR, none of the missense carriers had isolated LV involvement, while this was 
predominant in the non-missense carriers patients. Our results confirm previous numerically limited 
observations and demonstrate that LV dysfunction and LV involvement are significantly more 
common in carriers of non-missense DSP mutations, thus highlighting DSP truncating mutations as a 
key emerging genetic substrate of LV disease. This concept is reinforced by the observation of left

ventricular involvement in more than an half of the family members evaluated so far, all of whom had  
non-missense variants. 
This concept is also supported by studies on the Carvajal syndrome (44) and on dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM) (45). The Carvajal syndrome, caused by homozygous DSP non-missense 
mutations, is a syndromic form of ARVC with an extra-cardiac cutaneous phenotype. Although 
initially the cardiac phenotype in the Carvajal syndrome was presented as more similar to a DCM 
phenotype (46), later on it was shown that the pathology of the heart as well as the ECG features were 
more in line with a biventricular form of ARVC with substantial LV involvement (4,47). In another 
study on DCM patients, desmosomal gene mutations were found in 5% of patients (45) and among all 
variants identified, those with the strongest evidence of pathogenicity were 2 novel non-missense DSP 
variants. Although it is known that end-stage ARVC and DCM can often be indistinguishable (8), that 
study highlighted the fact that desmosomal gene mutations, and DSP truncations in particular, may be 
the common denominator behind a compromised LV. Therefore, in presence of a DSP truncating 
mutation, a closer follow-up of LV function should be considered. 
DSP Mutations and Arrhythmic Events 
Desmoplakin mutations (4,11,17), and especially truncations (22), have been associated to 
more penetrant phenotypes, with SCD often being the sentinel event. In our series, the majority of 
DSP mutation carrier patients (59%) indeed experienced a major cardiac event. However, at variance 
with previous suggestions (22), there were no significant differences in either all or major arrhythmic 
events, nor in the patients’ age at these events, among carriers of missense and non-missense 
mutations. In the largest published series of patients carrying the same DSP truncating mutation (22), 
which however involved only 3 probands with 15 family members, a highly penetrant and malignant 
clinical phenotype was described, with concomitant LV non-compaction in 2 families. In that study, 
similarly to many of our cases, the LV was predominantly involved. Although our data support a 
prominent role of DSP truncating mutations in LV disease and LV or biventricular ARVC forms, they 
do not confirm previous suggestions that this specific type of mutations increases arrhythmic risk. On 
the other hand, since also in our series the majority (59%) of DSP mutation carriers experienced a life-
threatening arrhythmic event, our data reinforce the earlier observations that DSP mutations,

14 
irrespective of their type, may contribute to more penetrant phenotypes with increased arrhythmic 
propensity (4,11). 
DSP Missense vs Non-Missense Mutations 
We have explored the issue of ARVC clinical severity according to the type of DSP mutations. 
In contrast to previous reports (10,23) we found no association between the type of mutations and 
clinical severity, whether an earlier age at diagnosis, an earlier age of disease onset, or greater 
prevalence of major arrhythmic events. The only clear association found is LV dysfunction in the 
presence of non-missense DSP mutations. 
The relatively small numbers of our study are balanced by three points of strength. First, our 
patient population has a clear ARVC phenotype according to the revised Task Force criteria (2). 
Second, our population includes a comparable number of carriers of missense and non-missense 
mutations and of patients with and without symptoms and major events, thus allowing us to examine 
separately the role of age at disease diagnosis and at disease onset. Third, we have mostly considered 
variants with high levels of evidence for pathogenicity, thereby avoiding to assign prognostic value to 
variants of unknown significance which could interfere with a correct interpretation. 
Desmoplakin is a large protein and an obligatory component of the desmosome since it links 
desmosomal protein partners, mainly plakophilin and plakoglobin, to the intermediate filaments of the 
cytoskeleton, forming the basis of cell-to-cell adhesion. It has 3 unique domains, each with particular 
secondary structure and function (26). Although the rule of thumb that non-missense truncating 
mutations act through haploinsufficiency and missense mutations through dominant-negative effects 
generally applies, functional studies have shown that there are notable exceptions (26-29). Until 
elaborate functional studies will provide insights on how each particular mutation exerts its effect in 
the setting of a cross-talk with a dynamic cellular environment and the rest of genetic background, our 
data support the notion that there are no differences in terms of arrhythmic risk between missense and 
non-missense DSP mutations in ARVC.

CONCLUSION 
One of the main objectives of genotype-phenotype correlations, besides gathering information 
on the underlying mechanisms of action of different mutations, is to assign prognostic implications to 
particular genetic substrates to implement risk stratification strategies and individualized patient 
management. Our findings support the concept, already validated for channelopathies such as the long 
QT syndrome (24,48), that even within the same disease genotype-phenotype correlations should be 
gene-specific. We show that ARVC-associated DSP mutations correlate with a high arrhythmic risk 
and that non-missense mutations are specifically associated with left-dominant forms. The presence of 
DSP truncating mutations should alert to the likely development of LV dysfunction. These findings 
highlight the potential impact on clinical management of genetic testing even after the clinical 
diagnosis of ARVC.
