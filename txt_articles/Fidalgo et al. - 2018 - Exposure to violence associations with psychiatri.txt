Objective: The effects of exposure to violent events in adolescence have not been sufficiently studied
in middle-income countries such as Brazil. The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of
psychiatric disorders among 12-year-olds in two neighborhoods with different socioeconomic status
(SES) levels in Sa
˜o Paulo and to examine the influence of previous violent events and SES on the
prevalence of psychiatric disorders.
Methods: Students from nine public schools in two neighborhoods of Sa
˜o Paulo were recruited.
Students and parents answered questions about demographic characteristics, SES, urbanicity and
violent experiences. All participants completed the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia (K-SADS) to obtain DSM-IV diagnoses. The data were analyzed using weighted logistic
regression with neighborhood stratification after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics, gender,
SES and previous traumatic events.
Results: The sample included 180 individuals, of whom 61.3% were from low SES and 39.3% had
experienced a traumatic event. The weighted prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 21.7%. Having
experienced a traumatic event and having low SES were associated with having an internalizing
(adjusted OR = 5.46; 2.17-13.74) or externalizing disorder (adjusted OR = 4.33; 1.85-10.15).
Conclusions: Investment in reducing SES inequalities and preventing violent events during childhood
may improve the mental health of youths from low SES backgrounds.
Keywords: Adolescents; child psychiatry; epidemiology; social and political issues; violence/aggression
Introduction
In 2011, the Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health
Initiative (GCGMHI) described the main priorities for
mental health research for the next 10 years. Research
on the relationships between environmental exposure
and mental health problems was among these priorities.
According to this document, a life course approach should
guide researchers, since many mental health problems
begin in childhood and continue throughout life.1 Mount-
ing evidence appears to indicate that violence and poor
neighborhood-level conditions (i.e., poverty and social
exclusion) during childhood and adolescence may lead to
the development of psychiatric disorders during both youth
and adulthood.2,3 In addition, adolescent mental health has
been associated with several psychosocial factors. In
addition to neighborhood sociodemographic characteris-
tics,4-6 individual-level characteristics, including family and
school-related issues, are significant risk factors for the
development of mental disorders.7
Although progress has been made in understanding the
role of neighborhood-level aspects and childhood violence
on adolescent mental disorders, few studies focusing on
data from low- and middle-income countries, such as
Brazil, have been conducted to date. Such research is of
particular interest in these countries, in which deep social
inequality exists. Although Brazil is the ninth wealthiest
country in the world, it has important social discrepancies,
such as per capita income, years of education, and life
expectancy. In Brazil, many city-level neighborhoods are
largely segregated by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic
status.8-10
Urban violence is considered one of the most important
public health problems in Latino countries.11 However,
urban violence affects the population unequally; its impact
varies by gender, ethnicity, age and social space.12 Among
children, exposure to urban violence has been linked to
academic difficulties,13 aggressive behavior,14 and inter-
nalizing symptoms (i.e., symptoms of depression and
anxiety).15 Together with urban violence (neighborhood
crime), other aspects of an individual’s neighborhood can
be associated with psychiatric disorders.16-18
Domestic violence also has an impact on child and
adolescent mental health.19 A 2012 meta-analysis found
a significant association between physical abuse, emo-
tional abuse and neglect in childhood and the future onset
of depressive disorder, drug use and suicide attempts.
Therefore, all forms of child maltreatment should be
considered potential predictors of child and adolescent

 mental health problems.20-24 This is of special interest
because psychiatric mental disorders in childhood and
adolescence are associated with a disrupted transition
to adulthood, even if the disorders do not persist into
adulthood or the mental symptoms are subthreshold.25
Children and adolescents living in poverty are at high
risk of multiple exposures to violence.19 The relationship
between socioeconomic status (SES) and violence and
their impact on child and adolescent psychopathology,
however, is still unclear. Although this association has
been reported in a number of studies, longitudinal studies
are needed to disentangle causal relationships.19
The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to investigate
the prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders (depression,
general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder,
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defi-
ant disorder and conduct disorder) among 12-year-old
youth in two neighborhoods with different SES levels
in Sa
˜o Paulo, Brazil; and 2) to examine the influence
of previous violent events (mugging, aggression followed
by mugging, domestic violence, physical abuse and sex-
ual abuse) and SES on the prevalence of psychiatric
disorders.
Methods
Study design and sample selection
The data were derived from a cross-sectional survey of
school-attending youths in two very different neighbor-
hoods in Sa
˜o Paulo. One of the neighborhoods, Vila
Mariana, has low exposure to urban violence (13 homi-
cides per 100,000 inhabitants) and a high Human Devel-
opment Index (HDI) (0.950). The other neighborhood,
Capa
˜o Redondo, has high exposure to urban violence
(47 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants) and a lower HDI
(0.782), being one of the most violent neighborhoods in the
city of Sa
˜o Paulo. Both neighborhoods are in the southern
region of the city of Sa
˜o Paulo, which comprises 3.6 million
residents according to the 2010 Census (the total popula-
tion of the city of Sa
˜o Paulo was 11.4 million).
Nine public schools were selected according to loca-
tion: 5 in Vila Mariana and 4 in Capa
˜o Redondo, all from
the poorest regions of each neighborhood. All students
born between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002
and regularly enrolled in the 7th grade in 2014 were
recruited (n=416). The caregivers of all students received
a letter explaining the study’s research goals and pro-
cedures. Subsequently, the chief field supervisor tele-
phoned all the caregivers to invite them to participate
and to clarify questions about the research goals and
procedures.
For a two-sided test of the equality of odds ratios at a
significance level of 5%, a sample size of 180 subjects
has at least 80% power to detect a difference when the
true value of the odds ratio lies above 2.5 and the lowest
disease prevalence is between 0.15 and 0.50.26
According to school records, only 210 of the 416
registered students had an active telephone or cell phone
number at which they could be contacted for recruitment.
Most of the Brazilian population has an active cell phone
(84% of Brazilians have an active cell phone, including
97% of Brazilians with the highest SES and 64% of
Brazilians with the lowest SES)27; therefore, outdated
school telephone records were the likely cause of this
discrepancy. All 210 of these students were contacted
and 180 agreed to participate (an 85% acceptance rate).
Data collection and instruments
Two face-to-face interviews were conducted for each
participant: one with the adolescent and one with the
caregivers. Both interviews were conducted by a trained
team of interviewers (child and adolescent psychiatrists
and psychologists) using LUMIA 635, an app for inserting
data into smartphones. The questionnaire included demo-
graphic information about the caregivers and child and
their SES, including a standardized survey to assess SES
called the ABEP index.28 This index is based on pos-
session of various types of household goods, the head of
the household’s educational level, and the number of
housekeepers employed. According to their score, ABEP
respondents can be sorted into eight subgroups, with A1
being the highest economic stratum and E the lowest.
The participants’ lifetime diagnoses of mental disorders
were measured with the Schedule for Affective Disorders
and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and
Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). This instrument is a semi-
structured psychiatric interview that ascertains both life-
time and current diagnostic status based on DSM-IV
criteria, and it has been translated into Brazilian Portu-
guese.29 This instrument is designed for use by trained
non-clinicians and clinicians. The K-SADS-PL is intended
for children 6-18 years old and their parents, containing
parallel questions for the parents and children that are
asked separately. It includes three components: an intro-
ductory interview (demographic, health, and background
information), a screening interview (20 diagnostic areas),
and diagnostic supplements. The K-SADS-PL has the
best test-retest reliability for anxious disorders and
affective disorders.30,31 In this study, we used the screen-
ing interview and the following sections of the diagnostic
supplements: depression, generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and substance use/
substance use disorders (SUD). All K-SADS-PL results
were reviewed by a licensed child psychiatrist trained in the
use of the test.
The interviews were conducted at the school, usually
on Saturdays (never during class). The participant and
his/her caregivers were interviewed separately by differ-
ent interviewers. The entire interview process (discussing
the consent form, answering questions about the study,
and the actual interview) ranged from one to two hours,
depending on the number of K-SADS-PL supplements used.
Measures
Due to the small sample size, we defined two ranks of
SES based on the ABEP scale: high (A1, A2, B1 and B2)
and low (C1, C2, D and E). The economic strata of three

 subjects from different schools in Capa
˜o Redondo was
not initially determined due to missing data, so they were
considered as the most prevalent SES in their schools
(low).
Screening for violent events was performed using the
PTSD screening interview from the K-SADS-PL. When a
youth reported having experienced a mugging, aggres-
sion followed by mugging, domestic violence, physical
abuse or sexual abuse, this was coded as an occurrence
of a violent experience.
Due to the small number of children with any diagnosis
according to the DSM-IV criteria, a binary variable was
used (past or current diagnosis vs. no diagnosis). In addi-
tion to separately analyzing each diagnosis, we sepa-
rately analyzed combinations of all internalizing disorders
(depression, GAD and PTSD) and all externalizing dis-
orders (ODD, CD and ADHD).
Statistical analysis
The analyses were conducted with data weighted to cor-
rect for unequal probabilities of selection into the sample.
The complex survey design took the stratified sampling
design, the difference between the gender distributions in
the sample, and the corresponding distributions in each of
the neighborhoods into account. Since the schools were
fixed and not randomly chosen, the sampling level was
students.
First, we conducted exploratory analyses using basic
contingency tables with chi-square tests, followed by
logistic regression for complex samples. We described
the students’ general sociodemographic variables, neigh-
borhood-level scores, violent experiences and psychia-
tric diagnoses with weighted proportions. A seemingly
unrelated logistic regression (SULR) approach was used
to simultaneously analyze associations between both
responses (internalizing disorders and externalizing dis-
orders) with at least one of the attributes (gender, neigh-
borhood of origin, SES, and violent experience), as well
as for possible interactions among these variables in a
forward selection method.32
The analyses were performed using Stata 13.0, with
complex sample procedures to address variance estima-
tion under the complex sample design in these regression
models and to estimate all 95% confidence intervals
(95%CI). The results are presented as weighted propor-
tions (%wt), adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95%CI.
Ethical aspects
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Columbia
University Institutional Review Board (IRB-AAM4702) and
by the Universidade Federal de Sa
˜o Paulo (UNIFESP)
research ethics committee (protocol no. 451.565 of 11/08/
2013), provided that participants could participate anon-
ymously, decline to participate, leave questions unan-
swered, and interrupt their participation at any time. The
consent form was explained to both the child and his/her
caregiver, and both signed it after any questions had been
answered.

 had significantly more adolescents with low SES (69.0%)
than the Vila Mariana neighborhood (55.0%; p = 0.012).
Regarding violence, 39.9% of the students had experienced
at least one violent event. Mugging was the most common
violent experience (24.8%; 95%CI 20.4-29.9), followed by
domestic violence (17.5%; 95%CI 13.7-22.1) and physical
abuse (7.1%; 95%CI 4.7-10.4). The rate of any violent event
was similar in both neighborhoods (p = 0.419).
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
Nearly one-quarter (21.7%; 95%CI 17.4-26.7) of the
sample had a psychiatric disorder. Depression was the
most common diagnosis (9.5%; 95%CI 6.7-13.4), fol-
lowed by ADHD (9.3%; 95%CI 6.6-13.0) and GAD (6.1%;
95%CI 3.9-9.5). PTSD was more prevalent in Vila
Mariana (6.2%; 95%CI 3.2-11.8) than Capa
˜o Redondo
(4.0%; 95%CI 2.2-6.9; p = 0.046). Detailed information is
presented in Table 1.
A total of 14.0% (95%CI 10.5-18.4) of the sample had
an internalizing disorder. Most of them were males
(44.8%), from Capa
˜o Redondo (41.1%), and with lower
SES (68.3%). Another 15.5% (95%CI 11.9-20.0) had an
externalizing disorder. Most of them were males (64.1%),
from Capa
˜o Redondo (54.5%), and with higher SES
(81.8%). Almost 60% of the adolescents with any diagnosis
had experienced at least one violent event during their
lifetime (Table 2).
In the logistic regression model, the interaction between
SES and violence was statistically significant in both tested
models (Table 3). Having experienced any violent event
and having low SES were significantly associated with
having an internalizing disorder (aOR = 5.46; 2.17-13.74)
and with having an externalizing disorder (aOR = 4.33;
1.85-10.15). Having experienced any violent event and
having high SES was not associated with having an
internalizing or externalizing disorder (p 4 0.05). This is
graphically represented in Figure 1. Being female (aOR =
2.33; 95%CI 1.13-4.81; p = 0.02) was significantly asso-
ciated with having an internalizing disorder.
Discussion
Our main finding is that having experienced any violent
childhood event and having low SES were significantly
associated with both having an internalizing disorder and
having an externalizing disorder according to the DSM-IV
diagnostic criteria.
A 2015 meta-analysis of 41 studies conducted in 27
countries found a worldwide prevalence rate of mental
disorders in children and adolescents of 13.4%. Pre-
valence rates varied from 19.9% in North America to 8.3%
in Africa. Studies that used the K-SADS as the diagnostic
interview found a prevalence rate of 15.3% for any mental
disorder in the age range of 6 to 18 years.33 It has
previously been established that the prevalence of mental
health problems in children in low- and middle-income
countries is similar to that in high-income countries.34 In
our study, the prevalence of any mental disorder using the
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria was similar to those reported in
the literature.
Concerning Brazilian prevalence data, studies have
used a variety of screening instruments. In a birth cohort
of 4,452 11-year-old preadolescents, 10.8% presented
with at least one psychiatric disorder according to either
the DSM-IV or ICD-10 based on the Child Behavior Check-
list (CBCL), which was completed by caregivers only.35
Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ),
Goodman et al.36 found a 7.0% prevalence of any men-
tal disorder among 519 7- to 14-year-old subjects in a rural
Afro-Brazilian community. The screening instruments in
these studies differ from the K-SADS because the latter is
a diagnostic instrument, and its correct use requires cli-
nical experience. Screening instruments cannot be used

 to determine diagnoses. Fleitlich-Bilyk et al.37 also used a
diagnostic instrument other than the K-SADS, namely, the
Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA).
Robust findings indicate that social relationships and
neighborhood disorder are associated with mental dis-
orders.38 In our study, having experienced a violent event
by the age of 12 was significantly associated with having
an internalizing or externalizing disorder. It is important to
emphasize that SES was associated with violent events;
subjects with low SES exhibited a negative impact from
violent experiences on their mental health status. The
magnitude of the effect of violent events on internalizing
and externalizing disorders is lower in individuals of
higher SES. Similar findings were presented by Andrews
et al.39 based on data from the National Survey of
Adolescents-Replication (NSA-R) study, which was con-
ducted in the US in 2005. These authors examined the
mediating and moderating effects of polyvictimization
(i.e., the number of types of violent events/victimizations
experienced by an individual) and household income on
trauma-related mental health symptoms among children
and adolescents. Compared to high-income backgrounds,
low-income family environments appeared to be a risk
factor for negative mental health outcomes following expo-
sure to violence. It is always important to emphasize, how-
ever, that association does not imply causation. It is also
possible that low SES is associated with a greater number
of violent experiences and that these experiences are more
intense among low SES neighborhoods.
These theories could explain the impact of violent expe-
riences on the development of mental health disorders. It is
well established that violence negatively affects mental
health in childhood, adolescence24,40,41 and adulthood.42-44
Of even greater significance is the impact of these violent

Violence and psychiatric disorders

 experiences throughout the lifespan; the consequences of
exposure to violence continue to be felt throughout life,
leading to an increased disease burden.4,39,45
The literature still lacks consensus about the definition
of a violent experience. In our study, we investigated mug-
ging, aggression followed by mugging, domestic violence,
physical abuse and sexual abuse. Moreover, the impact of
these violent experiences may vary according to the
victim’s age when they occur, since neuroplasticity varies
according to neurodevelopment. Therefore, studies focus-
ing on specific age ranges are necessary.24
Concerning
internalizing
disorders,
we
found
that
females were at higher risk of an internalizing disorder.
Similarly, we found that adolescents attending schools in
Vila Mariana, which had less urban violence than Capa
˜o
Redondo, had a higher risk of an internalizing disorder.
In a study of 425 children from the 3rd to 5th grade in six
Baltimore public schools, Milan et al.46 found that gender
moderated the relationship between neighborhood con-
text and mental health problems. Females were more
adversely impacted by disordered neighborhood environ-
ments. The authors hypothesized that boys in hazard-
ous environments develop coping strategies that include
externalizing behaviors. In contrast, girls’ coping strate-
gies lead to more internalizing symptoms. Similar findings
have been reported concerning the influence of neighbor-
hoods with high levels of violence on the development of
internalizing disorders.47-49
Some limitations of this study should be noted. Although
careful procedures were used to select the sample, we
did not use a population-based representative sample.
In addition, the sample size was small, which did not allow
an investigation of each psychiatric disorder separately.
Therefore, our findings should be extrapolated with caution.
Moreover, because this was a school-based sample, some
of the most severe cases may not have been included due
to having dropped out of school already. However, we can
hypothesize that among all the children invited to partici-
pate, those with the most severe symptoms may have
been more likely to agree. In addition, this was a cross-
sectional survey, and we reiterate that association does not
imply causation. Finally, the relationship between the fea-
tures of urbanicity is very complex. Many of the causal
arrows are likely bidirectional, since low urbanicity can
be both a cause and a consequence of mental disorders.
More studies are necessary to clarify specific causal
pathways.50
In conclusion, SES was associated with the impact of
exposure to violence in the development of mental dis-
orders in youths. This finding has important implications
for public health. Investment in reducing inequality could
have a buffer effect on violent events for psychiatric
symptoms. Strategies to prevent violent events during
childhood, such as physical and sexual abuse and domestic
violence, may also have a positive impact on adolescent
mental health.
