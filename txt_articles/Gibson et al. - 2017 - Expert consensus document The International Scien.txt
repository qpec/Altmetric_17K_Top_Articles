 Improving human health through modulation of the 
microbiome is an evolving strategy that is part of a 
compre 
hensive, holistic approach to lifestyle wellness1. 
The rich, diverse microbial ecosystems inhabiting 
mucosal and cutaneous surfaces provide targets for 
approaches to maintain or improve health or to treat 
disease. The ability to shift the composition and meta­
bolic signatures of these microbial populations is now 
possible, via dietary or non­dietary interventions2,3.
Over 20 years ago, a class of compounds, termed 
prebiotics, were recognized for their ability to manipu­
late host microbiota to the benefit of the host4. At that 
time fructans (fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin) 
and galactans (galactooligosaccharides or GOS) fit that 
category, with their effects acting through enrichment 
of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium spp. FOS and 
GOS currently dominate the prebiotic category as evi­
denced by numerous studies on their prebiotic effects. 
Today, the prebiotic concept has expanded, in part, 
because of advances in tools for microbiome research 
(for example, high­throughput sequencing), which 
have improved our knowledge of the composition of 
the microbiota and enabled identification of additional 
substances influencing colonization. Concurrent with 
this progress is the realization that a broader range of 
beneficial microorganisms are affected by prebiotics 
and also that they might be effective at extraintestinal 
sites directly or indirectly5. Furthermore, the use of 
prebiotics has expanded to production and companion 
animals6,7 and categories beyond food. Accordingly, 
researchers have advocated for reconsideration of the 
contemporary nature of prebiotics, which formed 
the aim of the consensus panel that was convened on 
9 December 2016 in London, UK. The various aspects 
looked at in this review of evidence were: evolution of 
the term prebiotic; effects and selectivity; substrates that

Abstract | In December 2016, a panel of experts in microbiology, nutrition and clinical research 
was convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics to review 
the definition and scope of prebiotics. Consistent with the original embodiment of prebiotics, 
but aware of the latest scientific and clinical developments, the panel updated the definition  
of a prebiotic: a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health 
benefit. This definition expands the concept of prebiotics to possibly include non-carbohydrate 
substances, applications to body sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, and diverse categories 
other than food. The requirement for selective microbiota-mediated mechanisms was retained. 
Beneficial health effects must be documented for a substance to be considered a prebiotic. The 
consensus definition applies also to prebiotics for use by animals, in which microbiota-focused 
strategies to maintain health and prevent disease is as relevant as for humans. Ultimately, the goal 
of this Consensus Statement is to engender appropriate use of the term ‘prebiotic’ by relevant 
stakeholders so that consistency and clarity can be achieved in research reports, product 
marketing and regulatory oversight of the category. To this end, we have reviewed several aspects 
of prebiotic science including its development, health benefits and legislation.

 are prebiotics; metabolism of prebiotics; host benefits; 
companion animals; and guidance for producers, con­
sumers and regulators. Herein, the term ‘microbiota’ 
refers to the collection of microorganisms in an eco­
system and ‘microbiome’ when genetic elements are 
also considered.
Methods
A panel of experts was organized by the board of direc­
tors of the International Scientific Association for 
Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), a non­profit collab­
oration of scientists dedicated to advancing scien 
tific 
excellence in probiotics and prebiotics. ISAPP activ­
ities are determined by the board of directors, compris­
ing global academic scientists. Through its Industry 
Advisory Committee, ISAPP incorporates indus­
try scien 
tists in its activities and raises funds to advance 
its mission. However, no input into this consensus 
panel process was provided by members of the Industry 
Advisory Committee. ISAPP functions as an indepen­
dent, objective, science­based voice for the probiotic and 
prebiotic fields.
Panellists included experts involved with the original 
development of prebiotics and subsequent modifications 
of the definition. Specialties included microbiology, 
nutrition, biochemistry and clinical research in both 
humans and animals. To prepare, panellists developed a 
discussion outline and target questions. Several delivered 
brief presentations that addressed background and core 
issues. Discussion ensued for each issue until consensus 
was achieved. After the meeting, individual panellists 
wrote sections of the summary, which were compiled 
by G.R.G., M.E.S and G.R. into a draft report. This docu­
ment was edited and agreed upon by all panel members, 
and finally by the ISAPP board of directors.
Evolution of the term prebiotic
In 1921, Rettger & Cheplin8 described experiments with 
humans whose microbiota were enriched with lacto 
bacilli 
following consumption of carbohydrates. The finding that 
the colon was dominated by  
anaerobes, many of which 
obtain energy by fermenting substrates from the diet9,10, 
 
initiated research that played an important  
foundational 
part in many  
subsequent microbiome projects.
Although dietary oligosaccharides had long been 
used to impart health benefits, principally in Asia, the 
prebiotic concept was first defined in 1995 as a “non­ 
digestible food ingredient that beneficially affects the 
host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity 
of one or a limited number of bacteria already resident in 
the colon” (REF. 4). The prebiotic concept was initiated to 
build on the probiotic concept, the most widely accepted 
definition of which was proposed in 2001 (REF. 11) and 
reaffirmed in 2014 (REF. 12). Prebiotics target human­ 
associated and animal­associated microbiota with the 
goal of improving health. Whereas probiotics use live 
microorganisms, prebiotics are non­viable substrates 
that serve as nutrients for beneficial microorganisms 
harboured by the host, including administered pro 
biotic 
strains and indigenous (resident) microorganisms. Thus, 
prebiotics differ from most dietary fibres such as  
pectins, 
cellulose and xylans, which encourage growth of a wide 
variety of gut microorganisms. Our meaning here is 
that a prebiotic should not be broadly metabolized, but 
elicit a metabolism biased towards health­promoting 
microorganisms within the indigenous ecosystem. The 
review by Simpson and Campbell13 provides an overview 
of microbiota interactions and compares studies on fibre 
and prebiotics, concluding that prebiotics (particularly 
FOS and GOS) seem to promote increased abundance 
of bifidobacteria within the gut microbiota.
Most of the first prebiotics assessed in humans and 
used commercially were shown to stimulate Lactobacillus 
and Bifidobacterium specifically, but not pathogens 
such as certain members of the Clostridia class and 
Escherichia coli 14–16. As these genera were commonly 
used as pro 
biotics, this approach provided a commonal­
ity between probiotics and prebiotics. Thus, the prebiotic 
definition and the concept itself became imprinted in 
food, nutrition and microbiology fields17. In 2004, the 
definition of pre 
biotics was altered to “selectively fer­
mented ingredients that allow specific changes, both in 
the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal 
microflora that confers benefits upon host well­being 
and health” (REF. 18). As per this definition, three  
criteria 
were required for a prebiotic: the ability to resist host 
digestion (for example gastric acidity, hydrolysis by 
mammalian enzymes and gastrointestinal absorption); 
that they are fermented by intestinal microorganisms; 
and that they selectively stimulate the growth and/or 
activity of intestinal bac 
teria associated with health and 
well­being. Thus, it was implicit that trials to demon­
strate prebiotic effects should be performed in the target 
host. In vitro assessments designed to identify pathways 
or mech 
anisms would not confirm prebiotic status in the 
absence of studies  
providing evidence of health effects 
in the host.

 However, as prebiotic concepts evolved, so too did 
their application to extraintestinal sites. The Food and 
Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations 
(UN) organized a Technical Meeting to update the defin­
ition of prebiotics in 2008. This panel proposed that 
prebiotics be redefined as “a non­viable food component 
that confers a health benefit on the host associated with 
modulation of the microbiota” (REF. 19). Here, selective 
fermentation was removed as a criterion, but in doing 
so the definition was criticized for not excluding anti­
biotics. Gibson et al.20, 2 years later, defined the narrower 
category of ‘dietary prebiotics’ as “a selectively fermented 
ingredient that results in specific changes in the compo­
sition and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota, 
thus conferring benefit(s) upon host health”
.
In 2015, Bindels et al.21 proposed that specificity 
requirements should be removed on the basis of reports 
showing that multiple taxa, rather than particular species, 
were enriched by prebiotics22. This proposal led to another 
definition of a prebiotic as “a non­digestible compound 
that, through its metabolization by microorganisms in 
the gut, modulates the composition and/or activity of the 
gut microbiota, thus, conferring a beneficial physiological 
effect on the host” (REF. 21). This definition limited pre­
biotics to interactions with the gut microbiota (excluding 
extraintestinal sites such as vagina and skin) and removed 
the requirement for selective fermentation. Selectivity 
with respect to microbial fermentation is viewed by this 
panel as key to the prebiotic concept. Importantly, how­
ever, this defin 
ition emphasized the functional effects of 
prebiotics on the microbiota.
Given the proposed definitions already described, as 
well as others, the need for a consensus definition was evi­
dent23. This need was amplified by views that the pre 
biotic 
concept required clarification on specificity, mech 
anisms 
of effect, health attributes and relevance, with some authors 
being critical of concepts already put forward and its 
approaches24–26. Thus, the current ISAPP consensus panel 
 
now proposes the following definition of a pre 
biotic: 
a substrate that is selectively utilized by host micro­
organisms conferring a health benefit (BOX 1). See BOX 2 
for additional rationale used to adopt this new definition.
Prebiotic effect and selectivity
Prebiotics are not the only substances that can affect the 
microbiota10 (FIG. 1). The criterion of selective utilization 
distinguishes prebiotics from many of these other sub­
stances16. Hopefully, the new definition will readily  
enable 
a developer to know whether a new substrate fits the 
 
prebiotic category.
In previous iterations of the term prebiotic, ‘selec­
tively’ was interpreted as referring mostly to lactobacilli 
and bifidobacteria. Specific stimulation of bifido 
bacteria 
(bifidogenesis) was considered a prebiotic effect. Early 
research on gut microbial ecology was based on culture 
methods, which we now know were insufficient to reveal 
the complexity of prebiotic­induced microbial changes. 
Molecular­based methods, which have since identified a 
broader range of members of the gut microbial commu­
nity, have enabled the appreciation that more bacterial 
genera might utilize some prebiotic substrates, by fermen­
tation and other metabolic pathways. These microorgan­
isms can vary depending upon the host and ecosystem 
under consideration. Hence, it is recognized today that 
prebiotic effects probably extend beyond bifidobacteria 
and lactobacilli, but to meet the selectivity criterion of 
a prebiotic, the range of microorganisms affected must 
be limited. To this end, in two human studies that used 
high­throughput sequencing, bifidobacteria responded 
to prebiotic use22,27. However, other groups such as 
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii also increased in abundance 
in one trial22 and in another study Anaerostipes spp. were 
additionally elevated, whereas Bilophila spp. decreased27. 
Both studies used high­throughput sequencing to confirm 
selectivity of the prebiotic fermentation. Selectivity does 
not necessarily mean effects on just one microbial group; 
a selective effect could extend to several microbial groups, 
just not all. A prebiotic, in addition to having a selective 
effect on microorganisms, must also evoke a net health 
benefit. The guiding principles are that microorganisms 
affected and metabolites produced are  
considered to be 
beneficial and linked to a defined health aspect.
Envisaging every scenario is challenging. But, for 
example, is a product a prebiotic if its intake increases 
microbial production of butyrate? Short­chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, 
and some other compounds, are recognized as having 
mechanistic links to health outcomes28,29. If the effect is 
a measurable benefit to host health, distinct from a con­
trol, it would constitute a ‘prebiotic effect’
. To verify that 
the product itself is prebiotic, experiments would have 
to demonstrate that the product is selectively utilized, 
in this case by showing that a defined range of butyrate­ 
producing micro 
organisms grow because of the product. 
Alternatively, the product might stimulate growth of other 
members of the microbiota, releasing metabolites that in 
turn stimulate butyrate production by other microorgan­
isms. This phenomenon could constitute a ‘cross­feeding 
effect’
. The net result is still selective in that propa 
gation of 
Box 1 | Main conclusions of the consensus panel regarding prebiotics
• The definition of a prebiotic has been modified to ‘a substrate that is selectively 
utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit’
• Although most current prebiotics are administered orally, they can also be administered 
directly to other microbially colonized body sites, such as the vaginal tract and skin
• Health effects of prebiotics are evolving but currently include benefits to the 
gastrointestinal tract (for example, inhibition of pathogens, immune stimulation), 
cardiometabolism (for example, reduction in blood lipid levels, effects upon insulin 
resistance), mental health (for example, metabolites that influence brain function, 
energy and cognition) and bone (for example, mineral bioavailability), among others
• We acknowledge that definitive proof of causality is difficult to provide. However, 
a human or animal study showing a change in heath markers or symptoms after a 
specific influence on the microbial population (that is, a blinded placebo-controlled 
trial with appropriate exclusion and/or inclusion criteria) then it is reasonable to 
assume that the two are causally related
• Currently established prebiotics are carbohydrate-based, but other substances such 
as polyphenols and polyunsaturated fatty acids converted to respective conjugated 
fatty acids might fit the updated definition assuming convincing weight of evidence 
in the target host
• The beneficial effect(s) of a prebiotic on health must be confirmed in the target animal 
for its intended use and mediated through the microbiota

 particular microorganisms led to this overall health effect. 
However, if pathogenic microorganisms are involved in 
butyrate generation and a negative consequence occurs 
for the host, then it cannot be termed a prebiotic. This 
distinction makes it important to determine both  
function 
and composition of the gut microbiota involved.
Similarly, prebiotics for use in the gut microbiota of 
humans should not form gas distension issues after inges­
tion; as such, their fermentation must be selective and 
preferably include genera that are not gas formers (such 
as Clostridium). This consideration points unequivo­
cally towards the need for selective metabolism. Notably, 
 
neither bifidobacteria nor lactobacilli  
manufacture gas 
in their metabolism16.
Moreover, it is implicit that such influences on host 
health be determined in mixed microbial eco 
systems 
containing the full microbiota of interest (that is, in vivo). 
Making inferences on prebiotic effects from pure or 
co­culture experiments is inadequate. Similarly, any 
conclusion regarding prebiotic activity must be based 
on an assessment of the full microbial diversity, not 
 
simply increased abundance of gut bifido 
bacteria or 
lacto 
bacilli, for example. The best techniques available 
need to applied, particularly as the microbiome field 
has benefited greatly from molecular­based techno­
logical advances. These techniques would include high­ 
throughput sequencing, including meta 
genomics, which 
demonstrates quanti 
fiable changes in the micro 
biota. 
Similarly, metabonomic assessments, such as NMR or 
mass spectrometry, in appropriate bio 
logical materials 
can identify metabolic responses to pre 
biotics and help 
determine concomitant functionality of the microbiota.
Substrates that are prebiotics
A number of fermentable carbohydrates have been 
reported to convey a prebiotic effect, but the diet 
ary pre­
biotics most extensively documented to have health bene­
fits in humans are the non­ 
digestible oligo 
saccharides 
fructans and galactans30. These oligosacchar 
ides are 
prefer 
entially metabolized by bifidobacteria16. A phenom­
enon explained by structure to function relation 
ships; the 
linkage bonds in FOS and GOS can be readily degraded by 
degraded by  
β­fructanosidase  
β­galactosidase enzymes, 
respectively, which are preva 
lent in bifidobacteria. This 
genus also seems to prefer 
entially metabolize the chain 
length size typical of oligosaccharides; that is, a degree 
of polymerization (DP) between 4 and 30 (REFS 31,32). 
Importantly, having the appropriate transport machinery 
to capture and deliver these substrates into the microbial 
cytoplasm is a key requirement and contributes to the 
selectivity of pre 
biotics in the target sites33 and empha­
sizes their ability to do so in a competitive environment in 
mixed culture ecosystems such as the human gut.
Substrates that affect composition of the microbiota 
through mechanisms not involving selective utilization 
by host microorganisms are not prebiotics. These sub­
strates would include antibiotics, minerals, vitamins 
and bacteriophages, which are not growth substrates, 
even though their intake might alter microbiota and 
 
metabolic composition.
Certain soluble fermentable fibres are candidate pre­
biotics34, and some other types of dietary fibre can be 
prebiotic, provided that they are selectively utilized by the 
host microbiota and promote health. Categorizing fibres 
as prebiotics is complicated by the fact that a diet 
ary fibre 
can be a prebiotic in one host but not another. For exam­
ple, cellulose can be considered a prebiotic in ruminants 
but not in humans, as the latter’s intestinal microbiota 
only poorly utilize β(1→4) linked  
d­glucose polysacchar­
ides35. Furthermore, a substrate qualify 
ing as a prebiotic 
might also depend on the target site. For example, xylitol 
can be considered as a pre 
biotic in the oral cavity, but has 
not been shown to be prebiotic elsewhere16,18.
Among the first group of substances recognized for 
their ability to influence gastrointestinal health were 
the oligosaccharides present in human milk. Human milk 
oligo 
saccharides (HMOs) are particularly important for 
the development of the newborn baby’s intestinal micro­
biota and metabolic and immunological systems, which 
have consequences for health later in life36,37. Consumption 
of mother’s milk containing these HMOs clearly increases 
the proportion of HMO­consuming Bifidobacteriaceae 
and Bacteroidaceae28. Bifidobacterium longum subsp. 
infantis (B. infantis) is the only Bifidobacterium spp. that 
has specifically evolved machinery to degrade the com­
plete repertoire of HMOs. Other Bifidobacterium spp. 
predominant in adults, mainly B. longum subsp. longum, 
B. adolescentis and B. lactis, lack many of the enzymes 
 
necessary to directly utilize HMOs effectively38,39.
Box 2 | Justification for the new definition of prebiotics
• It is a straightforward definition that avoids unnecessary technical jargon.
• It clarifies that prebiotic targets extend beyond stimulation of bifidobacteria 
and lactobacilli, and recognizes that health benefits can derive from effects on 
other beneficial taxa including (but not limited to) Roseburia, Eubacterium or 
Faecalibacterium spp.
• The term ‘substrate’ was chosen for its meaning of a substance on or from which 
an organism obtains its nourishment (for example, through fermentative breakdown 
of the substrate). This term aligns with the word ‘utilized’ and implies ‘for growth 
through nourishment’, therefore excluding viable microorganisms and antimicrobial 
agents as prebiotics.
• Prebiotics rely upon microbial metabolism. Non-microbial effects do not fit with 
our current classification. For the latter, these effects have tended to be researched 
in situations in which a resident microbiota is devoid or compromised. To confirm 
prebiotic traits, studies in the same species as the intended use are required.
• Prebiotics require selective utilization by live host microorganisms, not simply enzymes 
or bioactive chemicals, in a manner that sustains, improves or restores host health. 
Although many microorganisms might be able to breakdown a given substrate, it is the 
resultant health benefit to the host owing to selective utilization by microorganisms 
that enables it to be termed prebiotic. The actual mechanism of conferring benefit 
might also be mediated by microbial metabolic products. As such, both the microbiota 
changes and metabolites should be investigated, together with health outputs.
• It allows a prebiotic to invoke changes to any host microbial ecosystem, not just the 
gut. However, dietary prebiotics should still be non-digested by the host but utilized 
by the microbiota.
• Both prebiotic safety and use at appropriate dose are implicit in this definition. 
An appropriate dose must be sufficient to generate a prebiotic effect, but not too 
high to induce unwanted or adverse effects such as excessive gas formation or 
non-selective utilization. The ‘adequate’ dose will vary depending upon the microbial 
ecosystem and associated metabolic effects.
• Demonstration of health benefits in well-controlled studies in the target host is required.

 HMOs might indirectly affect composition of the 
intestinal microbiota by modulating immune responses 
and also have metabolism­independent mechanisms of 
action in the infant gut40. In particular, fucosylated and 
sialylated HMOs can prevent adhesion of pathogens to the 
intestinal epithelium through a competitive mechanism 
that ultimately protects the neonate from infection41,42. 
The main issues for this discussion are the following. 
Is there evidence that HMOs confer a health benefit in 
humans through the host’s microbiota selectively utiliz­
ing them, and therefore fulfilling the prebiotic definition? 
And if compounds equivalent to HMO (or bovine milk 
oligosaccharides, BMOs) were to be produced by enzy­
matic synthesis, fermentation or extraction, could they 
still be considered as prebiotic?
The ability of HMOs, BMOs or synthesized compounds 
to act as a substrate for the selective growth of beneficial 
bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium spp., would be supportive 
evidence of a prebiotic nature43. To confirm their status 
as a prebiotic, a controlled human study showing selec­
tive growth of bifidobacteria resulting in a health benefit 
is also needed. However, the use of such compounds for 
in vivo studies is limited to only a few reports. In one study, 
a chemically synthesized compound, 2ʹ­fucosyllactose 
(2ʹFL), equivalent to the natur 
ally occurring 2ʹFL in HMO, 
was added to formula milk along with GOS. Although 
safe for infants, the 2ʹFL treatment provided no net dif­
ference in weight, length, head circumference and other 
measures compared with human milk over a 4­month 
period44. In another study by the same group, infants 
fed formula with 2ʹFL plus GOS had immune responses 
simi 
lar to breast­fed infants in that both groups had lower 
levels of inflammatory cytokines than infants fed formula 
plus GOS45. However, effects on the microbiota were not 
reported in this study. In a third study, 2ʹFL and another 
synthesized HMO, lacto­N­ 
neotetraose, were adminis­
tered to adults46. The treatments were well tolerated and 
led to an increase in abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. 
Collectively, these studies prov 
ide an incomplete assess­
ment of the pre 
biotic properties of these synthesized 
versions of HMOs. Although 2ʹFL is utilized by B. infantis 
as well as some strains of B. longum subsp. longum and 
B. breve46,47, the ecological context (that is, infants versus 
adults) might dictate whether these HMOs are indeed pre­
biotic. Moreover, having structural equivalence to specific 
HMOs does not infer functional equiva 
lence to the con­
stellation of HMOs in milk48. Thus, for now, it is  
acceptable 
to state that some HMOs are candidate prebiotics.
Plant polyphenols constitute a class of compounds 
that can also meet the criteria of prebiotics, although far 
more studies in the target host are required. An estim­
ated 90–95% of dietary polyphenols are not absorbed in 
the small intestine and, therefore, reach the colon49 where 
they undergo extensive biotransformation by the colonic 
microbiota. Increasing evidence indicates that health 
bene 
fits associated with polyphenol consumption depend 
on microbial utilization and the metabolites  
produced, 
rather than on parent compounds50.
This evidence expands the prebiotic concept beyond 
non­digestible oligosaccharides such as FOS and GOS. 
However, evidence for these emerging prebiotics is scarce 
relative to the fructans and galactans16 and more studies 
measuring health benefits are required to fulfil their 
prebiotic status.
Prebiotic utilization and host health
As selective utilization of a prebiotic by host microorgan­
isms is key to its physiological effects, metabolic results of 
this utilization must, by deduction, be the main drivers. 
 
Some organic acids, for example, are principal end prod­
ucts of non­digestible carbohydrate or dietary fibre fer­
mentation by host microorganisms. The main SCFAs 
(≥95%) generated mostly in the colon (humans) and 
 
caecum (rodents) as a result of several bacterial metabolic 
pathways are acetate (two carbon, C2), propionate (C3)) 
 
and n­butyrate (C4). These SCFAs are crucial for intestinal 
health and their activity can subsequently influence sites 
distant to the gut, with different SCFAs having varying 
functions. SCFAs can modulate certain aspects of meta­
bolic activity including colonocyte function, gut homeo­
stasis, energy gain, the immune system, blood lipids, 
appetite and renal physiology, as reviewed elsewhere16,51,52.
In a study published in 2017, 13C­labelling was used 
to show that colonic­administered acetate, propionate 
and butyrate were systemically available at 36%, 9% and 
2%, respectively, with conversion of acetate into butyrate 
(24%) by the colonic microbiota53. Bifidobacteria, often 
stimulated by specific prebiotics, do not produce butyrate, 
so a probable scenario is that cross­feeding by other bac­
teria must have resulted in production of this SCFA. 
Much has been reported about the benefits of butyrate in 
the gut and beyond54, leading to the potential of known 
butyrate producers such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, 
Eubacterium rectale or Roseburia spp. as possible pro­
biotics and, therefore, new prebiotic targets. By contrast, 
in the vagina, butyrate formation is more equivocal as 
2­hydroxyisovalerate and γ­hydroxybutyrate have been 
associated with bacterial vaginosis55. Rather, lactic acid 
production and an increase in IL­10 levels might be 
bene 
ficial, indicating that prebiotics might be functional 
in the vaginal environ 
ment, because of their effects in 
Figure 1 | Distinguishing what is considered a prebiotic with the proposed definition. 
Prebiotics must be selectively utilized and have adequate evidence of health benefit for 
the target host. Dietary prebiotics must not be degraded by the target host enzymes.

 the gut56. Lactulose, which has potential benefits in the 
gut and vagina, can increase lactic acid levels and decrease 
β­glucuronidase activity, considered beneficial for the 
host57. Owing to the anatomical proximity of rectum to 
vulva, some microorganisms capable of utilizing pre­
biotics in the gut are also present in the vagina, including 
Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp.58–60.
Bile salt hydrolases are a family of enzymes prod­
uced exclusively by enteric microorganisms as a form of 
defence against their harsh, bile­rich environment. Bile 
acid transformation and/or metabolism in the gut is per­
formed by a number of species, including Lactobacillus, 
with known beneficial effects on the host. Joyce & Gahan61 
demonstrated that elevated bile salt hydrolase activity 
could promote reduced weight gain in mice and influ­
ence host pathways involved in lipid metabolism, periph­
eral circadian rhythm, gut barrier function and immune 
homeostasis. One study62 showed that enhanced bacterial 
deconjugation of taurine from primary bile acids occurred 
in the presence of pre 
biotic inulin, supporting the theory 
that faecal bile acid profiling might be a useful biomarker 
for the intake of  
prebiotics in mice and potentially also 
in humans.
The net result of prebiotic utilization within the gut 
could also extend to health benefits elsewhere in the 
body. For example, GOS stimulated growth of bifido­
bacteria in the mouse gut led to modulation of cortical 
IL­1β and 5­HT2A receptor expression and reduced anx­
iety levels63, as well as enhancing brain barrier function in 
obese mice64. Similarly, utilization of prebiotics might also 
reduce blood ammonia levels and improve psychometric 
tests in patients with hepatic encephalopathy65, presum­
ably through the formation of relevant bacterial metabo­
lites. Study findings suggest that prebiotics can reduce 
the development or severity of atopic dermatitis and 
eczema in children, presumably mediated by alterations 
to bac 
terial growth and interactions with the developing 
immune system, beginning in the gut66,67. The ability to 
increase water retention on the skin and reduce erythema 
formation is an emerging attribute of GOS ingestion, 
as reported in mouse studies68. On the skin, application 
of a prebiotic might stimulate changes in bacterial69 
or  
fungal70 profiles perhaps by targeting epidermal growth 
 
factor receptor. The health consequences of this approach 
are currently unclear, but might include psoriasis, acne, 
 
dermatitis, eczema and wound development66,67,71.
Studies in mice have shown that oligofructose (a fruc­
tan) reduced diet­induced obesity, diabetes, hepatic 
steato 
sis and inflammation by mechanisms linked with 
changes in specific gut microorganisms and meta­
genomics functions of bacteria72. A study in rats suggested 
that oligo 
fructose consumption might normalize the 
metabolomic signature of insulin resistance in obese rats 
and reduce obesity in offspring73. The ability to enhance 
secretion of satiety hormones peptide YY and glucagon­ 
like peptide­1 might be an associated attribute of  
prebiotic 
intervention and related SCFA production74–76.
In the mouth, compounds such as algal lectins, cran­
berry juice and cocoa polyphenols have been used to 
reduce the abundance of cariogenic bacteria. However, 
these substrates do not function through being selectively 
utilized by beneficial host microorganisms in the mouth, 
so they are not prebiotics77. Short­chain GOS and long­
chain FOS have been administered orally with B. breve 
and were found to increase peak expiratory flow and 
reduce systemic production of type 2 T­helper cytokines 
after allergen challenge in adults with allergic asthma78. 
The proposed mech 
anism, whereby microbial utilization 
of GOS and FOS, presumably in the intestine, could lead 
to immuno 
logical modulation that enabled the host to 
cope better with allergen exposure in the lungs, was not 
identified. In the nose and upper respiratory tract, bac­
terial species can be manipulated by prebiotics to influ­
ence health through immune reactions79 or competition 
with aetiological agents of disease80.
Conferring a health benefit
The ultimate goal of any intervention, including pre­
biotics, is to improve health and, therefore, reduce the 
risk or burden of disease. The most effective approaches 
are those that rely on prevention and recognize that 
early­ 
life strategies that promote a resilient, diverse and 
healthy microbiota have greatest long­term potential to 
benefit health81,82. Evidence for the important relationship 
between the structure and function of the microbial com­
munity, prebiotic use and host health has accumulated 
rapidly over the past decade20,23,30. To satisfy the criterion 
of conferring a health benefit, controlled studies estab­
lishing direct links between the prebiotic and health are 
needed in the target host. The level of evidence should 
be commensurate with the strength of the health benefit 
claim. To date, numerous randomized controlled  
trials 
have shown health bene 
fits of a variety of prebiotics across 
a range of populations, from healthy individuals to those 
with acute and chronic diseases. These and other human 
studies have been summarized elsewhere and are not dis­
cussed in detail here, but key examples are listed in TABLE 1 
(REFS 16,65,67,83–120).
Importantly, the effects of any intervention will be 
affected by a variety of host and environmental factors121. 
Thus, the effects of prebiotics have the potential to vary 
widely on an individual basis. Microbial utilization of 
prebiotics can only occur if the appropriate bacteria are 
a component of the host’s microbiota. This aspect might 
explain individual differences in responsiveness and in the 
outcomes of clinical trials. Host factors include variation 
in genetic predisposition to diseases (across multiple loci) 
as well as specific polymorphisms in microbial recognition 
pathways that can influence colonization and its biological 
effects16. A number of environmental factors, including 
mode of delivery and early feeding, antibiotics, disease 
 
status and adult diet, can influence the human microbiome 
and possibly the effects of prebiotic supplementation122–125.
Application to benefit animals
Prebiotics have been studied and used for companion 
animals, livestock, poultry and aquaculture. The inherent 
differences among animal species with regards to living 
environment, anatomy and physiology, dietary composi­
tion and reliance on the gut microbiota for energy, must 
be considered when evaluating the effect of prebiotics on 
animal health126.

 TABLE 2 provides examples of the use of prebiotics in 
animals. Dogs and cats evolved as Carnivora eating diets 
high in protein and fat but low in fibre126. They are non­ 
ruminants with short, simple gastrointestinal tracts that 
have little capacity to ferment non­ 
digestible substances, 
which predominantly occurs in the colon126. Nevertheless, 
some health benefits have been achieved with prebiotic 
administration such as reduced infections, improved 
 
insulin sensitivity and better faecal consistency127–131.
Prebiotics such as oligosaccharides of fructose, 
 
mannose and chitin protect piglets against high environ­
mental stressors (such as antibiotics, etc.) and pathogen 
loads, including faecal E. coli shedding, and reduced 
infection­ 
associated responses to Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium infection or porcine  
reproductive 
and respiratory syndrome virus132–135.
Calves are born in a pre­ruminant state and func­
tion as non­ruminants until the rumen and other com­
partments of the stomach fully develop136. During the 
first few weeks of life, or longer in the case of veal calves 
maintained on low­roughage diets (that is, low in fibrous 
material), prebiotics can be used to increase growth, 
improve feed conversion ratio, reduce the incidence and 
severity of scours (diarrhoea) or reduce the incidence of 
respiratory diseases136–139.
Poultry, which are used primarily for the production 
of meat or eggs, include landfowl (for example, chickens, 
turkeys and quail) and waterfowl (for example, duck 
or geese) species, respond to prebiotics despite most 
having a fairly short midgut and hindgut that includes 
a short, straight colon and twin caeca140. Dietary pre­
biotics, including inulin, yeast cell wall extracts, lactulose 
and GOS are usually fed at concentrations up to 0.2% 
(weight/volume) of diet140–146.
Farmed aquatic species include finfish and shell­
fish. Although anatomy varies among carnivorous 
(for example, turbot), omnivorous (for example, cat­
fish) and herbi 
vorous (for example, sturgeon) species, 
all fish have a fairly simplistic and short gastrointestinal 
tract147–149. The short length and simple structure (lack 
of special adaptations) of the fish gut results in the rapid 
transit of digested material, limiting the time available for 
microbial or prebiotic activity. Effective prebiotic doses 
in aquatic host species are typically in the range of 1–3% 
(weight/volume) of diet147–149.
Horses are large non­ruminant herbivores that rely 
heavily on microbial fermentation for energy, with more 
than half of their maintenance energy requirement 
coming from microbial fermentation occurring in their 
enlarged caecum and colon126. As their typical diet is high 
in roughage and feedstuffs that are consumed through­
out the day, prebiotic interventions might help improve 
 
effectiveness of fermentation150–152.
Guidance for stakeholders
Developing a consensus definition of prebiotic is use­
ful for many stakeholders (FIG. 2), whose responsibilities 
are discussed here. Agreement on this definition will 
reduce misinformation and confusion among consumers 
and health­care providers, facilitate sensible regulatory 
approaches, and provide common terminology and scope 
for future prebiotic research.
Consumers. This consensus definition should enable 
consumers to understand the terms used on product 
labels. Proper use of the terms by all stakeholders will 
help avoid misleading messaging. Although consumers 
might not be expected to understand the mechanistic 
details for how prebiotics function to improve health, 
our proposed definition should be readily appreciated. 
Individuals can respond variably (due to their habit­
ual diets, host microbiota, host genetics) to different

 prebiotics. This aspect dovetails with the concept of 
individ 
ualized nutrition, which should be understood 
by consumers.
Media and publishers of scientific papers. The media 
(press, TV, web­based and others) should avoid use 
of headlines that misrepresent results. Presentation of 
associ 
ation studies as if they contribute to an under­
standing of causality can be especially mis 
leading. 
When discussing results of a single study, how that study 
fits into the totality of evidence for that topic should 
be reported, including null results. The media should 
use the term prebiotic consistent with this  
proposed 
definition.
Regulators. Regulators have primary responsibility for 
ensuring safety of marketed products and protecting 
consumers from fraudulent marketing. To accomplish 
these goals, they are bound by statutes and regulations 
adopted in their respective regions. Acceptance by regu­
lators of the consensus definition of prebiotic would 
make it clear what can be expected of these substances 
from a scientific basis, and whether the term is being 
used appropriately. For example, most prebiotics for the 
gut require an oral dose of upwards of 3 g per day to 
elicit an effect16. Products containing doses lower than 
this level should not be called prebiotics, unless such 
a low dose has been proven to elicit selective effects 
upon the microbiota and concomitant health aspects. 
Incorporating a health bene 
fit in the definition gives 
a tangible end point for prod 
ucers and regulators alike 
to use in their assessment of whether a novel product 
 
fulfils the criteria.
Scientists. Scientists have the responsibility of consider­
ing all aspects of research on prebiotics (structural 
biochemistry, clinically relevant end points, effective 
dose, mechanisms of action, analytical methods) and 
consolidating findings such that a clear description of 
outcomes can be attained. Future prebiotic research 
should strive to confirm causality between an observed 
health benefit and microbiota­mediated mechanisms. 
This confirmation of causality has been challenging to 
achieve and some assumptions might be necessary, as is 
the case for most pharmaceutical interventions. To this 
end, well­controlled, placebo, blinded in vivo stud­
ies that exploit the latest multi­omic technologies are 
neces 
sary. For example, in the case of a dietary pre 
biotic 
for humans, a full assessment of gut microbiota changes 
using robust molecular procedures that are fully and 
accurately quanti 
fiable is required, such that selective 
substrate use can be ascertained. This analysis would 
be coupled with metabolic assessments of  
functionality 
(for example, metabonomics applied to blood, urine 
and faeces). In patients, symptomology should be deter­
mined, and in healthy or ‘at­risk’ populations reliable 
biomarkers of beneficial effects must be identified and 
measured. These biomarkers could include immuno­
logical changes, inflammatory mediators, serum lipid 
levels, genotoxicity, toxicity and cognitive function, 
among others, as appropriate to the study population. 
The study population must be reflective of the condition 
being researched, and an appropriate power calcula­
tion used to determine volun 
teer  
numbers. An effec­
tive pre 
biotic dose and duration must be established to 
compare effects. The test delivery vehicle (for example, 
foods such as cereal, bread or juices) should be con­
sidered such that prebiotic potential is not compro­
mised. Exclusion and inclusion criteria are applied to 
control for fluctuations in diet and other major lifestyle 
changes. Following that, if the only discernible corre­
lation is an improvement in health  
indices with selective 
microbiota changes ( 
composition and function) then it 
could be assumed that two are inter­related and driven

 by the prebiotic. When communicating results, scien­
tists should be careful to present data in a manner that 
does not mislead readers.
Suppliers or manufacturers of prebiotics. Suppliers 
and manufacturers have the responsibility to accurately 
characterize the identity of their prebiotics and conduct 
research to evaluate health benefits and safety. They 
should be committed to high­quality, controlled, non­ 
biased studies that assess effects on clinically relevant 
outcomes with associated peer­reviewed publication of 
the findings. They need to provide accurate technical 
information to end­product manufacturers.
End-product manufacturers. Producers of consumer 
products have a special responsibility to formulate 
and label prebiotic products in a manner that is true 
to the definition proposed herein, does not overstate 
the strength of evidence for health benefits and is con­
sistent with dose and form used in efficacy studies. 
Producers can contribute by sponsoring research on 
health benefits of their final products. Advertising must 
be consistent with scientific definitions, not overstate the 
strength of evidence for health benefits and adhere to 
regulatory standards.
Health-care providers and standards or recommendation- 
setting organizations. By providing compelling data that 
prebiotics can improve health, it is hoped that clinical 
organizations will accept and use the new definition, 
review the data in totality and develop evidence­based 
recommendations. This approach will help health­care 
providers to make decisions about clinical use in the 
absence of formal recommendations (based upon their 
own risk–benefit analysis).
Further regulatory considerations
We anticipate that future prebiotic products will expand 
current applications, include products administered to 
many body sites and be developed as non­conventional 
(or novel) foods, pharmaceuticals or other categories. 
In this section further insights into regulatory consid­
erations in two jurisdictions are provided as examples, 
but the way that prebiotics are regulated will differ in 
other countries.
European Union. In the European Union (EU), any 
health message carried by food requires assessment 
of the science by the European Food Safety Authority 
(EFSA) and authorization by the European Commission. 
Some prebiotic health claims have been approved, 
for example chicory inulin153.
Inulin, FOS and GOS were used in the EU before 
1997 and are considered safe food ingredients. However, 
pre 
biotic substances created after 1997 are considered 
novel and require safety clearance, a designation given, 
for example, to specific HMOs. To date, only one pre­
biotic, chicory inulin, has received an EU health claim: 
“Inulin improves bowel function” (REF
. 153). This approval 
was based on demonstration of a cause–effect relation­
ship between consumption of the non­ 
fractionated mix­
ture of monosaccharides (<10% of total carbohydrate), 
disacchar 
ides, inulin­type fructans and inulin extracted 
from chicory with a mean DP ≥9, and maintenance 
of normal defecation by increasing stool frequency. 
Additional product approvals hopefully will be forth­
coming, once relevant evidence is available, aided by the 
contents of this consensus document.
When prebiotics are considered to be novel foods, 
challenges arise to assessments as a food or individual 
ingredient. The EU considers HMOs added to a food 
as novel food ingredients, a legal construct determined 
by law154. A FOS or GOS with a markedly altered DP 
or with a different source or production method might 
be regarded as a novel food. An additional factor in the 
EU is the new consideration of safe history of use in 
 
countries outside the EU154. 
USA. Prebiotics is not yet a term recognized by the 
FDA. Prebiotics are regulated based on the category 
of product their intent and design dictates. Most pre­
biotics are sold as ingredients for foods (including 
infant formula) or are dietary ingredients in dietary 
supplements. The FDA issued an updated guidance 
to industry on the new dietary ingredient notification 
process in 2016 (REF. 155). Other regulatory categor­
ies that might apply to prebiotics are medical foods, 
drugs, cosmetics or devices developed for humans or 
animals. Changes to fibre labelling regulations in the 
USA in 2014 (in part owing to the different  
methods 
of analysis of fibre worldwide) will probably affect 
 
carbohydrate­based prebiotics156.
In the past, various analytical methods deter­
mined fibre levels in foods. Prebiotics, detected as 
sol 
uble fibre, could be listed as fibre on the nutrition 
facts label. Under the new regulations, this listing will 
not be allowed. Fibre has been redefined to be sol­
uble and insoluble non­ 
digestible carbohydrates (with 
three or more mono 
meric units) and lignin that are 
intrinsic and intact in plants, and certain isolated and 
synthetic non­digestible carbohydrates (with three 
or more mono 
meric units). Some prebiotics, such as 
 
inulin, fall under the latter category, but even so were 
not granted status as a fibre by the FDA. The new rules 
require that for a prebiotic to be listed as fibre, it must 
 
confer a benefi 
cial physiological effect and this evidence 
must be submitted to the FDA either though the citizen

Conclusions
This paper describes conclusions of a consensus panel 
of experts regarding a definition of prebiotic and the 
rationale for that definition. It is hoped that this new 
definition and explanation will clarify what is required 
to call a substance a ‘prebiotic’
. Given that differences 
exist across animal species, prebiotic efficacy, safety 
and appropriate dosing should be demonstrated for the 
 
specific target host.
In conclusion, prebiotics have the potential to improve 
human and animal health and reduce risk of diseases 
mediated by microbiota aberrations. The field would 
greatly benefit from research focused on mechanisms 
of action, characterizing responders or non­ 
responders, 
understanding how structure relates to function of pre­
biotic substances and correlating that function to health 
outputs. The use of prebiotics to improve health cannot 
be, and should not be, viewed in isolation, and will be part 
of a wider approach for healthy nutrition and lifestyle. 
The capacity exists for prebiotics to be used therapeuti­
cally in the management of disease and to preventively 
promote health.
