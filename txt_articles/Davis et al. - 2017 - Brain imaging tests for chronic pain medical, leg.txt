 Great science brings great responsibility. In the field of 
pain research, developments in imaging technology are 
bringing closer the possibility of objective assessment 
of pain. In a clinical context, these developments could 
help physicians to understand and treat chronic pain. 
However, developments in imaging technology raise 
legal and ethical issues about the appropriateness of 
using such technology to assess chronic pain. The scien-
tists who develop these technologies must take respon-
sibility for their use beyond the scientific and clinical 
contexts.
Chronic pain is defined as pain that is present every 
day for >3 months (or is present on ≥50% of days for 
6 months) or beyond the expected period of healing 
and does not have the warning function that acute pain 
does1–4. Chronic pain is associated with enormous per-
sonal and societal costs; individuals with chronic pain 
often have a reduced quality of life and unmet thera-
peutic needs, and society is struggling to cope with the 
large numbers of people with this condition. Chronic 
pain affects up to 35% of the population, and costs of 
medical care and loss of wages and productivity are esca-
lating5–7. Efforts to improve prevention, treatment and 
rehabilitation for patients with chronic pain are ongoing. 
Chronic pain is also the subject of many legal disputes 
between patients, health care systems and disability ben-
efit providers, in which proof or disproof that a patient 
is or is not experiencing pain might affect payments. 
Consequently, research to address whether chronic pain 
can be identified objectively is needed for a variety of 
reasons, particularly to provide evidence for insurance 
and legal purposes.
Given that the International Association on the Study 
of Pain (IASP) definition of pain is an “unpleasant sen-
sory and emotional experience8,9”
, self-report, although 
subjective, is currently the gold standard for the assess-
ment of pain. In drug development and clinical treat-
ment, researchers and clinicians rely on self-reporting of 
pain (alongside other indicators of quality of life) to eval-
uate a patient’s condition and the success of treatment.

Abstract | Chronic pain is the greatest source of disability globally and claims related to chronic 
pain feature in many insurance and medico-legal cases. Brain imaging (for example, functional 
MRI, PET, EEG and magnetoencephalography) is widely considered to have potential for 
diagnosis, prognostication, and prediction of treatment outcome in patients with chronic pain.  
In this Consensus Statement, a presidential task force of the International Association for the 
Study of Pain examines the capabilities of brain imaging in the diagnosis of chronic pain, and the 
ethical and legal implications of its use in this way. The task force emphasizes that the use of  
brain imaging in this context is in a discovery phase, but has the potential to increase our 
understanding of the neural underpinnings of chronic pain, inform the development of 
therapeutic agents, and predict treatment outcomes for use in personalized pain management. 
The task force proposes standards of evidence that must be satisfied before any brain imaging 
measure can be considered suitable for clinical or legal purposes. The admissibility of such 
evidence in legal cases also strongly depends on laws that vary between jurisdictions. For these 
reasons, the task force concludes that the use of brain imaging findings to support or dispute a 
claim of chronic pain — effectively as a pain lie detector — is not warranted, but that imaging 
should be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain.

 Neuroethics
A field that studies the 
implications of neuroscience 
for human self-understanding, 
ethics, and policy.
Arterial spin labelling
An MRI-based brain imaging 
technique that detects cerebral 
blood flow based on magnetic 
tagging of blood.
Nevertheless, diverse groups — including patients, 
researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical and medical 
device companies, insurers and the legal community — 
seek methods for evaluating chronic pain besides self- 
reporting. Patients seek objective testing to demon-
strate the reality of an invisible condition that is 
sometimes subject to doubt, researchers seek brain 
imaging markers that provide scientific, diagnostic 
and prognostic information that cannot be provided 
by patient self-reporting, and legal representatives and 
officials seek techniques to supplement self-reporting 
and objectively support or challenge claims related to 
chronic pain.
Brain imaging technologies, including functional MRI 
(fMRI), PET, EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG), 
have the potential to provide objective measurements of 
patterns of brain activity that underlie perceptual experi-
ences (BOX 1). Consequently, some people are looking to 
brain imaging to provide a window into the experience 
of chronic pain, particularly because testimony based on 
fMRI was deemed to be admissible as evidence of pain 
in a 2015 state trial court in the USA10,11. This case was 
highly publicized, although the judgement was not pub-
lished so no legal precedent was set, and the grounds on 
which the fMRI evidence was admitted were criticized by 
established experts in brain imaging studies of pain10,11.
In this context, the development of a brain imaging 
test for chronic pain12–14 has real-world consequences, 
so appropriate criteria for the use of such a test must be 
defined. Importantly, the way in which brain imaging 
evidence might be implemented in legal cases strongly 
depends on laws that vary greatly between countries. 
Therefore, examination of the capability of so-called 
‘pain-o-meter’ brain imaging tests is critical, as is consid-
eration of the use of such technology in light of societal 
views, neuroethics and legal issues. Thus, the aims of this 
Consensus Statement are to recommend criteria for the 
evaluation of neuroimaging measures of chronic pain, 
and to discuss the technical, biological, neuroethical and 
legal challenges related to establishing brain-based tests 
for chronic pain.
Methods
A presidential task force of the International Association 
for the Study of Pain (IASP) was established in 2015 to 
examine the feasibility of a brain-imaging-based diag-
nostic test for chronic pain. The task force had three 
purposes: to consider the capacity of brain imaging (in 
particular fMRI), on the basis of its technical and physi-
ological constraints, to detect whether an individual has 
chronic pain; to place the capability of brain imaging 
as a diagnostic test for chronic pain in an ethical and 
legal context; and to establish guidelines for health care 
systems, governments and legal policy makers on the 
validity and ethics of adopting a brain-imaging-based 
test for pain. (BOX 2)
Members of the task force were chosen by the chair 
(Karen D. Davis) and IASP president to provide expert 
opinions across the fields of brain imaging technologies, 
basic and clinical science of pain, psychology, neuro-
ethics, and the law. The members interacted via infor-
mal face-to-face meetings, email and conference calls 
to consider the scope of their task and the process by 
which the purpose could be achieved. Six small working 
groups were formed to discuss distinct topics (BOX 2).
Although the task force focused on standard blood 
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI, it did note that 
other imaging technologies, such as PET and arterial 
spin labelling (ASL), can measure cerebral blood flow 
in chronic pain, but are not yet widely available. The 
task force also noted that EEG has been used to assess 
Key points
• With suitable standardization and validation, brain imaging could provide objective 
biomarkers of key characteristics and mechanisms related to chronic pain, that could 
guide personalized pain management
• Brain imaging shows promise in the assessment of risk factors for chronic pain and in 
identification of the mechanisms that underlie transition to, and maintenance of, 
chronic pain
• Identification of brain-based markers of chronic pain requires technological 
advances, large-scale data acquisition across diverse groups of individuals, and strict 
application of standards of evidence
• Brain-based biomarkers should be used as an adjunct to rather than a replacement for 
subjective reports of the pain experience
• Use of brain imaging as legal evidence of an individual’s pain is not advisable until the 
specificity and sensitivity of such tests are improved, and validated protocols exist
• Current brain-based measures should be used only to understand brain mechanisms 
underlying pain, factors that lead to persistence of pain, and targets in the brain for 
safe and effective pain management

 Allodynia
Pain in response to stimuli that 
are not normally painful, such 
as a light touch.
stimulus-evoked abnormalities associated with neuro-
pathic pain15 and is widely available, and is still being 
validated across populations for the assessment of 
 
different types of chronic pain.
To facilitate the working group discussions, the task 
force chair provided questions about acute and chronic 
pain, technologies, and ethical and medico-legal issues. 
Each working group developed a report that was circu-
lated among members of the group for feedback and 
iterative modification. The reports were synthesized by 
the chair of the task force and circulated to all task force 
members for further discussion. The synthesized report 
underwent several rounds of modification as a result 
of the discussion among all task force members before 
 
it was finalized. The finalized report provided the basis 
for this Consensus Statement, which represents the 
 
culmination of the task force’s findings.
The science of pain and neuroimaging
Distinctions in terminology
In order to discuss the assessment of pain in any context, 
the meanings of commonly used terms must be clear. In 
clinical, scientific and legal settings, common misuses of 
pain-related terms include the inappropriate conflation 
of nociception and pain, and conflation of ‘evoked’ and 
‘ongoing’ pain.
Pain versus nociception. The IASP defines pain as “an 
unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associ-
ated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described 
in terms of such damage” and nociception as the “neu-
ral process of encoding noxious stimuli8,9,16”. On the 
basis of these definitions, therefore, pain is a complex, 
multi 
factorial and salient experience that comprises 
several elements. The perception that something hurts 
includes sensory–discriminative features (such as inten-
sity, quality and location), cognitive–evaluative features, 
and affective–motivational aspects17. Moreover, chronic 
pain involves distress and disability, which often impairs 
functional activities in daily life1.
Pain and nociception are often related but are not 
equivalent, and can occur independently of each other. 
Given that pain is perceptual and exists only insofar 
as an individual experiences it, it can only be defini-
tively identified through introspection and honest self- 
reporting. By contrast, nociception can occur without an 
individual being aware of it, and is not always dependent 
on consciousness; for example, measurable signs of noci-
ception can be detected in people under anaesthesia, even 
though no conscious experience of pain is present18. fMRI 
and other brain imaging technologies measure indices of 
brain activity that can provide information about noci-
ception and, by inference, pain, but brain imaging data 
can only be a proxy measure of pain. Consequently, 
any claims about an individual’s subjective experience 
of pain that are based on decoded brain imaging and 
activity are necessarily inferential (as is the inference of 
pain on the basis of an individual’s behaviour).
Evoked versus ongoing pain. Evoked pain can occur in 
an acute or chronic pain state and results from a stim-
ulus. This stimulus can be either one that is normally 
painful, or one that is normally not painful (for example, 
the allodynia experienced in response to a light touch of 
the skin after a burn injury). Spontaneous or ongoing 
pain is pain that is detached from an overt external 
stimulus. A chronic pain condition can involve  
ongoing 
pain, evoked pain, or both types. The distinction 
between evoked and ongoing pain is important because 
their evaluation with brain imaging requires different 
 
acquisition parameters and approaches.
Variability of pain
The experience of pain varies tremendously within 
and between individuals, and this variability poses a 
challenge for the use of brain imaging findings as an 
objective biomarker of acute or chronic pain. Within an 
individual, the link between a noxious stimulus and the 
ensuing perception of pain is not direct; ascending noci-
ceptive signals are modulated by ‘top-down’ control in 
Box 1 | Sources of recommendations relating to brain decoding of mental processes
Brain imaging techniques have greatly advanced our understanding of the neural basis of human perception, mental 
health and neurological disorders. Imaging has also opened the door to the possibility of brain decoding, a process in 
which information about human thoughts and feelings are derived from recorded brain activity. Several 
recommendations have been made by governments and academics on the use and misuse of brain decoding, including 
those listed here (links are included in the Further Information box):
• The US BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative
• The European Union Human Brain Project 
• The Japanese Brain/MINDS Project 
• The report of the ad hoc committee on Military and Intelligence Methodology for Emergent Neurophysiological and 
Cognitive/Neural Science Research in the Next Two Decades, created in 2004 by the US National Research Council at 
the request of the American Defence Intelligence Agency’s Defence Warning Office123. A key recommendation (2.1) 
states: “the committee recommends further research on multimodal methodological approaches for detecting and 
measuring neurophysiological indicators of psychological states and intentions. This research should combine multiple 
measures and assessment technologies, such as imaging techniques and the recording of electrophysiological, 
biochemical, and pharmacological responses. Resources invested in further cognitive neuroscience research based on 
scientific principles and that avoid the inferential biases inherent in previous research in polygraphy.”
• The 2011 UK Royal Society Brain Waves Project124 includes major discussions on “Neuroscience, society and policy” and 
“Neuroscience and the law”.

Body–self neuromatrix
A theory proposed by Ronald 
Melzack, in which a set of brain 
regions is considered to be a 
flexible reference space for the 
integration of many diverse 
processes into a representation 
of pain-in-context.
the brain as well as by ‘bottom-up’ factors (such as inhi-
bition by concurrent non-nociceptive input and other 
modulatory factors) that shape sensory input19 (FIG. 1). 
Furthermore, the relationship between the intensity of a 
noxious stimulus and the degree of pain is usually more 
direct in experimental studies, where the stimulus and 
the context can be controlled, than in a clinical context20. 
This observation highlights the difficulty in translating 
the results of laboratory studies of the nociceptive system 
to conclusions about the real-world experience of pain.
The experience of pain and the associated brain 
responses are also shaped by psychological factors, 
including learning and memory, personality traits and 
states, and cognitive, emotional, motivational, contex-
tual and cultural variables21–23. Attentional focus and an 
expectation of pain or pain relief (for example, from a pla-
cebo) can also alter the experience of pain and the evoked 
brain activity21,23–30. Chronic pain can modify brain path-
ways involved in endogenous pain control21,22,25,31, making 
self-regulation of pain challenging. This form of brain 
plasticity varies between individuals with chronic pain, 
adds to the variability in pain processing, and might 
compromise treatment outcome.
Imaging of pain
Electrophysiological and imaging studies have shown that 
stimulus-evoked and acute pain is associated with activity 
in many brain areas that belong to different functional 
brain systems, rather than with activity in dedi 
cated ‘pain 
centres’ within the brain (FIG. 1), including areas that are 
associated with coding information about noxious stim-
uli and reactions to noxious stimuli, the modulation of 
such information, the production of affective interpreta-
tions, attentional and emotional responses, and decision- 
making19,27,32–34. These brain areas include somatosensory, 
insular, cingulate and prefrontal cortices, and subcortical 
areas, including the amygdala, hippo 
campus, hypothala-
mus, ventral striatum, thalamus, periaqueductal grey, 
 
rostroventral medulla, numerous other brainstem areas 
and the cerebellum19,27,31,32,35–37. Neuronal oscillations in 
these areas differ from each other in frequency38, and 
dynamic and flexibly accessible brain networks are formed 
between these regions that subserve multiple functions.
Importantly, the fact that engagement of these brain 
areas has been associated with the perception of pain 
does not imply that the observed cortical activity is neces-
sary for the perception of pain; dissoci 
ation of activity 
in these brain areas and the intensity of noci 
ceptive 
stimuli and perceived pain has been  
demonstrated in 
several studies39–43.
The original ‘body–self neuromatrix’ concept44,45 led 
to use of the term ‘pain matrix’ to describe the brain 
regions involved in the pain experience. However, this 
term has been superseded for several reasons, includ-
ing the fact that it referred to a restricted set of brain 
regions, and that activity of these regions is non specific 
to pain41,46–48. The assumption that an experience of 
pain can be inferred by observing activity in parts of 
this ill-defined set of regions has led to much confu-
sion about the importance of neuronal activity in these 
regions in relation to pain49. Nevertheless, this infer-
ence served as a starting point for the development of 
machine learning and related decoding techniques to 
identify more-precisely defined patterns of activity.
Beyond regional activity, acute and chronic pain 
engages intrinsic brain networks (also known as resting 
state networks) — such as the default mode, salience 
and somatosensory networks, which together subserve 
homeostatic, attentional, cognitive, emotional, execu-
tive, and sensory functions50 — and alter their functional 
connectivity. No single definition of the boundaries of 
these networks exists, but the salience and somato-
sensory networks as defined in large-scale resting-state 
studies overlap extensively with the regions that were 
typically included in the pain matrix. The combination 
of these intrinsic networks and the top-down control 
systems that are engaged during the experience of 
pain across moment-by-moment and long-term time-
frames has been termed the dynamic pain connec-
tome50. However, the observation that activity within 
the dynamic pain connectome occurs when a person 
is experiencing pain is not sufficient to conclude that 
such activity is an indicator of pain, or that it is related 
to pain at all. To make this conclusion, the activity must 
relate to  
reporting of pain, and must not occur in the 
absence of pain.

Decoding pain from brain activity
Nociceptive stimuli trigger a broad variety of cogni-
tive, emotional, motivational, autonomic and motor 
processes that are not specific to pain but are part of 
the multidimensional nature of the pain experience. 
Consequently, many (if not all) features of brain activ-
ity that have been associated with pain are not specific 
to pain. As a result, making inferences about whether a 
person is experiencing pain on the basis of current brain 
imaging techniques is problematic. Nevertheless, efforts 
are being made to decode pain from brain activity51–54. 
Similar efforts are being made to predict pain from 
brain structure, such as grey matter volume and white 
matter connectivity, but these efforts were beyond the 
scope of this task force and are discussed elsewhere55–58.
Univariate and multivariate approaches have been 
applied to the analysis of brain imaging data in order 
to decode pain. In univariate approaches, brain metrics

 or features are analysed one at a time to distinguish 
between normal and abnormal responses to a stimulus 
in that metric, thereby determining the relationship of 
that metric to the perception of pain. Features can relate 
to the location, magnitude or spatial extent of activa-
tion, or functional connectivity in a network or between 
specific brain areas; these variables are correlated with a 
behavioural measure, such as a reported pain experience 
(BOX 3). Multivariate approaches integrate multiple fea-
tures of brain imaging data into an integrated predictive 
model3,4,59,60. Machine learning and statistical techniques 
are often used to identify patterns in these data, and are 
optimized to jointly predict patient status, the experi-
ence of pain, analgesia, and other outcomes. These 
approaches have been successfully used to decode some 
aspects of stimulus-evoked acute pain from patterns of 
brain activity, at least to some extent51,61–71 (BOX 4).
Interpretation of these analyses, however, requires 
caution owing to several important limitations. First, 
successful detection of pain does not imply that the 
experience of pain is what the predictive brain signa-
ture measures. Machine learning might lock onto fea-
tures that correlate with pain, such as salience, rather 
than pain itself — the reverse inference problem72,73 
(discussed further below). Second, successful predic-
tion of pain does not imply that the predictive brain 
biomarker is specific to the experience of pain; such a 
neuromarker must be tested in many types of painful 
and non-painful conditions to empirically establish 
what it does and does not respond to54,74–76. Third, an 
imaging neuromarker might not generalize to all types of 
pain, or to all individuals; this aspect must also be tested 
empirically. Fourth, prediction of pain does not imply a 
causal relationship between the predictive activity and 
the  
experience of pain.
Most work to date has involved attempts to iden-
tify neuromarkers that reflect mechanisms and neuro-
physiological processes that are important in chronic 
pain31,64,77–81. Given that the experience of pain has diverse 
influences, from nociception to social context, it is very 
unlikely that a single neuromarker will be found to reflect 
all aspects of acute and chronic pain in all contexts.
Assessment of chronic pain
Chronic pain is currently assessed by medical his-
tory, clinical examination, questionnaires, behavioural 
measures, and, occasionally, laboratory tests. The key 
symptom of most types of chronic pain is stimulus- 
independent pain. Such spontaneous, ongoing pain can 
be steady or might fluctuate over time in several pat-
terns. In some conditions, chronic pain is associated with 
hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli and/or a decoupling of 
nociceptive stimuli from painful percepts (altered evoked 
pain). Chronic pain can occur in the absence of tissue 
damage in the painful region (for example, referred pain 
or neuropathic pain) or an identifiable lesion, and even 
without any peripheral input, as in central neuropathic 
pain (for example, pain associated with spinal cord injury 
and post-stroke pain). The neuropathology that changes 
electrical, neuroimmune and/or neurochemical signalling 
might not be detectable with current noninvasive tech-
niques. Chronic pain often co-occurs with a broad variety 
of emotional, cognitive and motivational changes, includ-
ing mental disorders, which complicates the  
identification 
of a specific neuromarker of chronic pain.
Imaging of chronic ongoing pain requires a different 
approach to that used for imaging of acute, experimen-
tally evoked pain. Chronic ongoing pain can remain con-
stant or vary slowly during the course of a brain imaging

session, rendering it essentially invisible to traditional 
imaging techniques, such as stimulus-evoked fMRI. 
Furthermore, chronic pain involves qualities of experi-
ence, and possibly other dysregulated brain processes, 
that are not always characteristic of acute experimental 
pain in healthy people. Therefore, we cannot assume — 
and it is highly unlikely — that chronic pain generates 
precisely the same brain features as those observed in 
acute experimental pain.
In principle, functional brain imaging can measure 
three types of activity relevant to chronic pain: evoked 
activity, task-free resting-state brain activity, and activ-
ity related to a particular attribute of ongoing clinical 
pain.
Evoked activity. In some conditions, chronic pain is 
accompanied by hyperalgesia and/or allodynia, which 
are signs of peripheral and/or central sensitization. 
This sensitization can be studied by applying brief 
stimuli, preferably with multiple stimulus intensities to 
characterize stimulus–response functions82,83. With this 
approach, one can determine the stimulus-evoked brain 
responses that differ between patients with chronic pain 
and healthy individuals, or between responses elicited 
by stimuli applied to affected and unaffected areas of 
the same patient83–86. Alternatively, brain responses 
that correlate with pain intensity79,82,87–91, or percept- 
related brain activity that fluctuates in synchrony 
with the experience of pain31,69,89,92–96 can be identified. 
Association of activity with the experience of pain is 
particularly important in chronic pain, because an 
evoked pain response can be out of sync with or com-
pletely disconnected from the timing and duration of 
the applied stimulus89,20,97,98.

Box 4 | Brain decoding of acute experimental pain with multivariate pattern analysis and machine learning
Machine learning is an analysis approach that exploits the ability of computers to learn from, and make predictions from, 
different kinds of data125. When applied to functional brain images, machine learning can be used to detect response 
patterns (for example, intensity and spatial distribution of functional MRI (fMRI) signals or spatial–temporal patterns of 
EEG signals) associated with a given experimental variable (for example, the intensity of pain perception)61,126.
Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is a machine learning technique in which a pattern classifier identifies the fMRI 
responses elicited by different stimuli3,4,59,60. MVPA is different from conventional univariate fMRI analysis approaches, 
which use a general linear model to detect average regional activity and consider a single voxel at a time within a given 
brain region (see figure, top right). MVPA detects patterns of activity across many voxels, to determine whether (and how) 
a condition is represented in the spatial pattern of activity sampled across the multiple voxels of a given brain region (see 
figure, bottom right). Consequently, MVPA is usually more sensitive than conventional univariate analysis to fine, 
within-region spatial differences in brain activity across experimental conditions, and can detect changes in the spatial 
distribution of fMRI signals even when average regional activity does not differ across different conditions. The patterns 
of activity identified by MVPA can be used to predict the occurrence of different experimental variables (for example, 
different levels of subjective pain, or pain versus touch). The validity issues raised by the potential for reverse inference 
also apply to the interpretation of the results obtained using machine learning. However, a given machine-learning result 
can be interpreted to reflect a pain signature only if the relationship between the brain response pattern and pain is 
unique for pain8.

 Resting-state brain activity. Resting-state, or ‘task-free’
, 
brain activity is widely assessed in many types of dis-
orders. Resting-state fMRI involves the acquisition of 
fMRI data in the absence of any overt stimulus or task. 
The data can be used to measure functional brain con-
nectivity that relates to a combination of spontaneous 
thought processes and ongoing neural and physiological 
maintenance processes; in chronic pain, these processes 
include those involved in ongoing pain50. Moreover, 
vari 
ability in brain activity can provide insight into 
brain health, pain sensitivity and the capacity for brain 
plasticity99; these measures can differ between patients 
and healthy individuals, or vary in relation to character-
istics of pain and risk factors for pain or its chronifica-
tion26,31,100–103, so can be clinically useful. A challenge in 
this approach is that the nature of any particular change 
in the pattern of resting-state connectivity associated with 
pain has not been determined, as patterns are altered in 
a range of clinical conditions; this uncertainty makes it 
unclear whether any particular pattern is related to pain 
itself, spontaneous thought, or other related processes.
Ongoing clinical pain. Patients with chronic pain can 
experience ongoing pain, often with no obvious exter-
nal cause. This type of pain can change over time, and 
these dynamics can engage brain areas and networks 
associated with emotional, cognitive and motivational 
processes50,104. However, brain measures associated with 
ongoing pain can be quite different from those that 
 
correlate with evoked pain64. 
PET-based or ASL-based measurements of cerebral 
blood flow105 can be used to examine ongoing clinical 
pain, because these techniques are quantitative and do 
not require delivery of an external stimulus. Early ASL 
studies were limited by relatively weak blood flow meas-
urement signals, which typically needed to be boosted 
by manipulations that increase pain106, but modern ASL 
methods, scanners and analyses, along with improved 
experimental paradigms, compensate for this limitation. 
A different approach is to measure the dynamic brain 
connectivity, which varies over time, to enable identifi-
cation of connectivity patterns that vary with reported 
levels of ongoing pain. This approach has revealed 
changes in the default mode and salience brain networks 
in chronic pain states107–109. However, a potential con-
founding factor is the possibility that the judgement and 
reporting of ongoing pain causes a detectable change in 
brain processing.
Challenges in imaging chronic pain
Imaging of pain-related processes in patients is chal-
lenging owing to special considerations. These chal-
lenges include variability in imaging within and between 
patients, the specificity of the imaging findings, the pos-
sibility of reverse inference, and various technical and 
statistical issues.
Patient variability. Good consistency across hundreds 
of brain imaging studies of healthy people has enabled 
identification of a core set of brain areas that respond 
to acute noxious stimuli31,35 at a group level. At the 
individual level, however, specific patterns and levels 
of evoked activation vary31,35. Similarly, dozens of ima-
ging studies across various chronic pain conditions have 
identified some general abnormalities in patients com-
pared with age-matched and sex-matched healthy con-
trols, but these findings vary at the individual level31,35. 
Furthermore, identification of consistent pain-related 
activation or connectivity in the brains of individuals 
is challenging not only because of differences between 
healthy people and between patients, but also because 
data obtained from a single individual have low statis-
tical power. Moreover, each moment in time in each 
person is marked by a unique contribution of sensory, 
cognitive, emotional and motivational processes (as well 
as physiological and demographic states) to the experi-
ence of pain. Consequently, the brain activity associated 
with acute and chronic pain varies across time, people 
and context.
Multivariate, machine-learning-based measures 
have identified a core pain-related network that ena-
bled tracking of within-person variations in pain in a 
restricted cohort61,63,80. This finding is encouraging, but 
the model is incomplete because these measures do not 
capture the entire pain experience (for example, qualities 
and emotions) and do not account for changes in atten-
tion or salience. In addition, between-person variables 
that affect the fMRI signal (for example, caffeine, hae-
matocrit levels and changes in the neurovascular system 
associated with ageing and disease) and brain processes 
involved in making verbal reports or decisions dimin-
ish the ability to accurately predict which individuals 
experi 
ence more pain than others. Consequently, no 
normative database of acute pain responses or functional 
connectivity across age, sex, ethnicity and other relevant 
variables exists to enable comparisons with an individual 
who presents with chronic pain.
Specificity. No brain areas or networks have yet been 
specifically and exclusively linked to chronic pain. 
Furthermore, many processes that are associated with 
chronic pain can also occur in many other states. For 
example, many abnormalities observed in chronic pain 
conditions are also present in depression, anxiety and 
other conditions21,27. This combination of substantial 
overlap of chronic pain with other processes that are not 
necessarily pain-related, and comorbidity with mental 
disorders, implies that an inherent lack of specificity is a 
fundamental problem for brain imaging-based diagnostic 
 
tests for chronic pain.
Reverse inference. The reverse inference problem is a 
central obstacle in accurate brain decoding to deter-
mine whether an individual is or is not experiencing 
chronic pain. In this context, reverse inference means 
the inference of a particular mental state (for example, 
the perception of pain) from a given pattern of brain 
activation. The likelihood of such an inference being 
correct depends on the degree to which activation in 
that pattern occurs exclusively as a result of pain54,110,111. 
Accurate assessment of whether a reverse inference 
is true requires not only assessment of how often the

pattern of brain activity occurs when pain is experi-
enced, but also how often the pattern is present when 
pain is not experienced. Furthermore, many processes 
associated with chronic pain are not pain-specific, so 
determining how often the network is activated when 
pain is present is not enough: one must also demon-
strate that the same network is not activated when no 
pain is present. The inference that network activity 
indicates pain cannot be assumed, but must be demon-
strated with data that are sufficient to establish speci-
ficity and sensitivity. Importantly, some brain imaging 
responses associated with pain have also been observed 
in response to equally salient but not painful stimuli71. 
This observation indicates that an inference of causality 
— that the experience of pain is a direct result of the 
network activity detected with brain imaging — might 
be incorrect. Demonstrating that a given fMRI response 
pattern (or indeed any pain biomarker) has a high sensi-
tivity and specificity as a test does not necessarily imply 
that the neural activity from which that pain biomarker 
is derived corresponds to the neural activity through 
which pain emerges as a percept.
Technical and statistical challenges. The outcome 
of any brain imaging session is highly dependent on 
many study design variables, data acquisition imaging 
parameters, approaches to data pre-processing and 
statistical analysis, and the statistical significance level 
used. Currently, neither a gold-standard pre-processing 
pipeline for detecting chronic pain nor standards for 
procedures and quality control have been established112 
(BOX 3). Moreover, the relationship between fMRI sig-
nals, neurovascular coupling and neuronal activity is 
not fully understood113. Furthermore, some inherent 
assumptions about the haemodynamic response and 
vascular reactivity might be violated for some people, 
owing to age, obesity, stroke and other neurovascular 
complications114–116. The haemodynamic ceiling effect 
and baseline blood flow both affect the magnitude of 
stimulus- 
evoked fMRI responses, and should be con-
sidered when using fMRI to assess the magnitude of 
evoked responses and analyse connectivity. For exam-
ple, if ongoing pain is associated with high levels of 
activity in nociceptive neurons and high levels of tonic 
blood flow to the areas of the brain that contain those 
neurons, the additional neuronal activity associated 
with evoked pain might be undetectable on fMRI117. 
These factors make paramount the inclusion of control 
tasks (which are often included in pharmacological 
imaging studies but rarely in other types of imaging 
studies) to enable assessment of such influences.
Criteria for neuroimaging protocols
In this section, we present criteria for the evaluation of 
fMRI measures of pain; these criteria also apply to any 
other biomarker of pain (BOX 5). A given brain measure 
might meet these criteria with varying degrees of rigour, 
and different levels of evidence might be appropriate in 
different clinical and legal contexts. Many of these cri-
teria are consistent with the standards set out by the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Office of 
Public Health Genomics ACCE (Analytic validity, clin-
ical validity, clinical utility and associated ethical, legal 
and social implications) Model Project, the aim of which 
was to devise standards of evidence for use in genetic 
testing for disorders (FIG. 2). The establishment of similar 
benchmarks and standards for neuroimaging studies to 
assess chronic pain and to determine the validity of test 
results would provide an equivalent resource.
We note that the criteria we propose are not yet ade-
quately fulfilled — the goal of this Consensus Statement 
is to provide a framework for the development of valid 
protocols for neuroimaging of chronic pain. We there-
fore encourage individual and collective efforts, includ-
ing collaborative multisite projects and data-sharing 
Box 5 | Proposed criteria for establishing valid neuroimaging protocols
• Criterion 1: A precise definition of a pain neuromarker
• Criterion 2: Applicability of the pain neuromarker to individuals
• Criterion 3: Methodological procedures used during testing must be validated
• Criterion 4: Measures must be internally consistent and image data quality validated 
for the individual tested using positive and negative controls
• Criterion 5: The neuromarker must be diagnostic for pain
• Criterion 6: The neuromarker must be validated with converging methods
• Criterion 7: The neuromarker must be generalizable to the patient group tested and 
to the test conditions
A given brain measure could meet these standards with varying degrees of rigour, and 
different levels of evidence might be appropriate for different clinical and legal 
applications. In addition to the scientific evidence, applications of brain markers for 
nociception and pain should also take into account social implications (including 
financial, social and other costs), and the effects of errors in both false-positive and 
false-negative directions.

of four key factors set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Office of 
Public Health Genomics to evaluate new genetic tests for validity and utility. This model 
can also be applied to the field of neuroimaging-based biomarkers of pain, which is 
currently in a research discovery phase.

 initiatives, to develop measures that meet these criteria, 
as has been done for other clinical conditions (notably the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)). 
Application of brain markers for chronic pain, however, 
should not only take into account the scientific evidence, 
but also consider the social implications, including finan-
cial, social and other costs, and the benefits and dangers 
of false-positive and false-negative errors (BOX 6).
Criterion 1
Precise definition of a pain neuromarker. Any brain 
measure that is to be used as a neuromarker of pain 
must be precisely defined, and procedures must be 
established for determining whether the data are of 
suitable quality for a valid test, calculating the measure 
from an individual’s imaging data, and determining 
appropriate cut-off values for the measure. Definitions 
must go beyond a simple description of activity in a 
brain area; they should specify the precise voxels of 
interest within the involved brain region or regions, the 
relative activity across voxels, the voxels that should be 
included for the individual (if the set of voxels used is 
individualized according to sex, age or other factors), 
and the relative expected magnitude of activity across 
voxels. The current standard brain mapping procedures 
are usually not defined precisely enough to produce 
useful neuromarkers.
Criterion 2
Applicability of the pain neuromarker to individuals. 
For a neuromarker of pain to be useful, its accuracy in 
individual people must be established (see Criterion 5). 
In addition, the ability to apply a neuromarker to an 
individual’s brain imaging data without prior  
knowledge 
of that individual’s pain must be demonstrated.
Criterion 3
Methodological procedures used during testing must 
be validated. The methodological procedures used to 
test for a neuromarker (BOX 3) in an individual must be 
clearly defined and validated. These procedures include 
methods for instructing the patient, assessing and mini-
mizing confounding factors (for example, head move-
ment and physiological artefacts), data acquisition, data 
processing and analysis, application of the neuromarker 
(how to calculate the neuromarker’s response value 
or score from the neuroimaging data obtained), and 
 
interpretation of the results.
Criterion 4
Measures must be internally consistent, and the qual-
ity of imaging data validated for the individual tested, 
using positive and negative controls. Testing for pain 
neuromarkers requires complex data acquisition and 
analysis steps that are subject to artefacts, physiological 
noise and technical problems. Defined procedures must 
be established for determining at the time of the test 
whether the quality of the data and their analysis are ade-
quate for detection of signals in a particular individual. 
Demonstrating the neuromarker’s internal consistency — 
the ability to consistently obtain a valid, reproducible, and 
reliable measure — is critical. Positive controls must also 
be established to enable validation in the individual being 
tested. Such controls would be patterns of brain activity 
that are independent of pain and that must be observed 
for the test to be considered valid. Similarly, negative con-
trols must be established — these controls would be pat-
terns of brain activity that must be absent for the test to be 
considered valid. In addition, controls must be in place to 
enable detection of feigned responses or  
deception, such 
as responses to deliberately self-inflicted pain.
Criterion 5
The neuromarker must be diagnostic for pain. The accu-
racy of a neuromarker for detecting and/or quantifying 
pain must be established, including quantification of its 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and nega-
tive predictive value for pain at the level of the individual 
person. Determining these metrics requires knowledge of, 
or assumptions about, the true pain levels in a validation 
sample (for example, the true pain intensity in a group of 
individuals who have chronic pain and a group who do 
not have chronic pain). In addition,  calculating the posi-
tive and negative predictive value of the measure requires 
knowledge about the prevalence  of the chronic pain con-
dition of interest in the general population. Some neuro-
imaging data that have previously been submitted to court 
in legal cases did not include sensitivity and specificity 
values, as these metrics were never assessed10. Such tests 
have been admitted as evidence in court, but we would 
argue that they should not be deemed admissible without 
an established predictive value.
Criterion 6
The neuromarker must be validated with converging 
methods. An imaging neuromarker of pain is more likely 
to be valid if its relationship with pathophysiological

mechanisms of chronic pain has been established by 
comparison with other methods (for example, invasive 
human or animal studies). Regardless of the brain sys-
tems involved, a neuromarker has increased plausibil-
ity as a measure of pain when a strong relationship has 
been demonstrated between the neuromarker and pain 
in different populations studied with different methods.
Criterion 7
The neuromarker must be generalizable to the patient 
group tested and to the test conditions. The clinical 
diagnostic value of a neuromarker (for example, its 
positive and negative predictive values) might be dif-
ferent for different populations, and a predictive value 
estimated in one population (for example, healthy indi-
viduals) cannot be assumed to apply in another popu-
lation (for example, patients with back pain), unless the 
marker can be shown to generalize across populations, 
or good evidence supports the assumption that it gen-
eralizes. The test must also be validated under the con-
ditions to be used in the applied test; these conditions 
include elements such as the neuroimaging equipment 
(for example, the specific scanner), the analysis software 
and procedure, the psychological and physiological con-
dition of the person (for example, their prior sleep and 
food and drug intake). A marker that is validated with 
one acquisition and analysis procedure is not necessarily 
valid if applied under other procedures, unless evidence 
shows that the marker is generalizable across variations 
in scanners and procedures. Given that fMRI measures 
signals relate to the regulation of brain perfusion and 
oxygen consumption, the presence of a neurovascular 
disease might change fMRI neuromarker values inde-
pendently of neural activity. Such sources of variation 
must be considered and controlled for (when possible) 
to enable appropriate interpretation of the signal.
Legal and ethical issues
Chronic pain and the legal system
Chronic pain is an issue in a broad range of legal mat-
ters, accounting for tens of thousands of legal cases and 
billions of dollars of civil damages and benefit payments 
annually. Legal decisions involving claims of chronic 
pain might include determinations of eligibility for dis-
ability or workers’ compensation benefits, tort claims, and 
entitlement to public or private insurance14. Assessment 
of chronic pain can also affect the extent to which a 
 
person is protected by disability law.
A survey of legal cases in the USA, Canada, and UK 
shows that people whose claim of chronic pain is sup-
ported by strong evidence might nonetheless be denied 
benefits, compensation or disability status118, while 
people with actually or potentially fabricated claims 
of chronic pain might receive compensation, because 
legal decision-makers apply variable and unreliable 
standards to these cases14,119. Rigorously validated and 
regulated brain imaging techniques for assessing pain 
might, therefore, have the potential to improve legal 
practice and increase average accuracy and fairness 
across health-care-related cases. Besides this potential 
future role of brain-imaging-based evidence of pain in 
an individual, our current understanding of the science 
of chronic pain (which is grounded in brain imaging 
studies) can inform legal decision-makers about the 
general features of how chronic pain occurs, presents 
and endures. This body of research can guide the craft-
ing of more accurate and precise laws that relate to pain 
as a source of disability, and can assist the evaluation of 
evidence in individual cases.
Whether a brain imaging test is used to support or 
refute a claim of pain, it must meet rigorous standards. 
First, the test must meet a high standard of evidence, 
satisfying all of the scientific criteria proposed above, 
as well as the legal criteria of the relevant jurisdiction. 
Second, and more important, the test must recognize 
that each individual is unique, and that abnormal 
brain activity or structure alone does not prove that an 
individual is experiencing pain. Individual differences 
that result from factors such as genetics, environment 
and prior learning can create difficulties when com-
paring individual scans to group-averaged findings. 
Accordingly, brain imaging tests that are sufficiently 
rigorous to meet scientific and legal criteria should 
not be considered to stand alone, but instead should be 
assessed in the context of an individual’s current medi-
cal and behavioural profile and his or her prior experi-
ences. For a neuromarker to be believable, therefore, 
one would need to be able to evaluate the extent and 
effect of neuroplasticity, brain reorganization, or other 
individual differences, as noted above. In principle, such 
individual differences could never be entirely ruled out, 
although this difficulty does not preclude such evi-
dence from being useful. In this context, legal officials 
would have to assess the strength of the correlation, as 
is the case with other scientific evidence: even DNA 
identification never can provide certainty.
Chronic pain assessment in legal cases
Brain-based evidence of chronic pain could be used in 
legal matters for two distinct purposes. The first is to 
educate decision-makers about the pathophysiology of 
chronic pain as a foundation on which to assess the evi-
dence pertaining to a specific case. As an educational 
tool, brain imaging can be used to explain chronic pain 
conditions, but admission of such evidence should be 
accompanied by a caution that the evidence provides 
background information that can only be used to assess 
the facts of a claim, and does not prove or disprove 
any individual claim. Furthermore, some research 
suggests that jurors and other decision-makers can be 
unduly influenced by being shown visually appealing 
brain images120; for this reason, courts should consider 
whether to limit expert evidence on the neurobiology 
of chronic pain to verbal testimony. The second pur-
pose of brain-based evidence in legal matters is to 
attempt to provide evidence for or against the presence 
of pain and its intensity in a particular individual. To 
date, researchers have not addressed this issue, but have 
instead addressed fundamental questions about the rep-
resentation of pain in the brain, mechanisms relevant 
to the development, exacerbation and maintenance of 
persistent and chronic pain, and how to identify targets

 for treatment. On the basis of what is currently known, 
brain imaging is not sufficiently reliable to be used 
as a pain detector to either support or contradict an 
 
individual’s self-report.
Future of brain imaging in legal cases
In the future, brain imaging of pain might enable assess-
ment of a person’s sensitivity to evoked pain or to pain 
treatment, and possibly of a person’s susceptibility to 
developing chronic pain14,121 (BOX 6). Such information 
could be used for many purposes: to determine the 
likelihood that a person with chronic pain will recover, 
which has a bearing on future damages in a legal mat-
ter; to make prospective decisions about a patient’s 
medical treatment, which might raise legal issues in 
insurance law and tort law, and ethical issues in relation 
to access to care; and to determine employment pros-
pects and fitness on the basis of an individual’s neuro-
logical risk profile (as discussed below). In light of these 
different applications, the development of use-specific 
privacy  
protections and legal and scientific standards 
is important.
Some uses of brain imaging data raise ethical ques-
tions12–14 (BOX 6). One foreseeable use by employers and 
insurers might be to decline employment or insurance 
cover for individuals who are particularly pain-sensitive 
or who exhibit a predisposition to chronic pain. In the 
military and other high-risk professions, for example, 
entry into service and opportunities for advancement 
could involve a neurological fitness examination that 
assesses, among other factors, acute pain sensitivity, 
emotional reactivity and predispositions to chronic pain 
and post-traumatic stress disorder. Brain imaging data 
could also be used to advise patients of their personal 
risks and benefits of a surgical procedure, including 
the risks of chronic post-surgical pain, and to protect 
physicians from liability if such pain develops. These 
possible uses, and others that are not currently fore-
seeable, raise legal issues of neurological and medical 
privacy, and of equality of access to employment, health 
insurance, and medical care. The scanning process itself 
also raises legal issues, including licensure and training 
of personnel to perform the scans and interpret the find-
ings, on the basis of shared standards that ensure rigour 
and permit scans to be cross-comparable.
Neuroethics and the law
Marginalization of subjective experience. The most 
meaningful gauge of a person’s pain is their self-report. 
Neither the absence of a known cause nor an aberrant 
response to a stimulus negates the experience of pain. 
If a patient honestly reports pain, they have pain — a 
principle that is encapsulated in the IASP definition. 
This principle is a central tenet of pain management, 
and is important for achieving adequate pain control, 
particularly in some populations with chronic pain that 
remain frequently marginalized and discredited. Within 
legal systems, the use of measurement and verification 
technologies most frequently becomes mandatory for 
marginalized groups. Nevertheless, people with chronic 
pain could voluntarily obtain brain scans if they have 
the financial means, so as to validate and explain their 
pain. If brain imaging is to be accepted as evidence in 
legal cases related to chronic pain, issues of access to 
brain imaging (for example, financial, geographical and 
avail 
ability issues), and what the choice made by an indi-
vidual about whether to use or not use brain imaging 
implies about them, must be considered.
Resource allocation. All systems, including medical and 
legal systems, have finite resources. In pain medicine, 
the most pressing issues remain the undertreatment of 
pain, disparities in access to treatment, and the need to 
develop effective and safe treatment options; thus, clini-
cal or legal use of expensive brain imaging techniques for 
detection of chronic pain might deflect resources away 
from more-effective treatment. Limitations on legal 
resources are also relevant to the interest of the legal 
community in tools to deal with claims related to chronic 
pain. Legal decision-makers should evaluate whether 
brain imaging would improve the efficiency of deal-
ing with such cases, relative to lower-cost options, and 
 
determine the relative burden on the parties involved.
Explicit and implicit requirements of use. The introduc-
tion of a test for chronic pain could exert a legal gravi-
tational pull: once a test is available, judges, jurors and 
other decision-makers might expect to see test results 
in all cases. In this context, the absence of this evidence 
could lead decision-makers to make informal adverse 
inferences about the party who declined the test. In this 
way, the availability of a test could make it de facto man-
datory in practice, if not in law122. Submission of a brain 
scan could also become a precondition of any claim 
relating to chronic pain; although a claimant could not 
be forced to undergo testing, any claimant who refused 
would forfeit the right to proceed.
Whether refusal to undergo a scan should result in 
adverse inferences and legal consequences depends, in 
part, on the reliability of any brain imaging tests that 
are introduced. Unless the technology is highly accurate, 
adverse inferences should not be made about claimants 
who refuse to undergo the scan, and no legal require-
ment should be put in place. Any legal requirement to 
have a brain scan must also balance issues of autonomy, 
efficiency, and resource allocation.
Medical privacy and data security. Medical records 
are private, but legal records are not, and medical evi-
dence used in legal matters generally becomes part of the 
 
public record. Brain-based evidence that enters the pub-
lic record might be particularly sensitive because, like 
DNA evidence, it could be used to make other inferences 
about the individual. The risk is particularly high if the 
brain imaging evidence exchanged between parties and 
used in court consists of the underlying data files, which 
parties involved in the case, or others, could manipulate. 
Legal systems should, therefore, develop practices for 
the protection of neurological data, and should develop 
standards and practices that courts and private parties 
that are custodians of the data must follow to ensure 
data security.

 Implications and recommendations
In the past few decades, the use of brain imaging and 
other technologies has led to a paradigm shift in our 
understanding of acute and chronic pain disorders, 
and revealed that these disorders are, at least in part, 
mediated by the CNS. With suitable standardization 
and validation, several forms of brain imaging could 
provide objective biomarkers of key characteristics of 
chronic pain. Identification of brain-based markers 
of chronic pain might be possible with further techno-
logical advancement, large-scale data acquisition across 
diverse groups of individuals, and strict application of 
standards of evidence to the assessment of potential 
pain biomarkers. Furthermore, brain imaging promises 
to enable assessment of risk factors for chronic pain, 
and identification of the mechanisms that underlie 
transition to and maintenance of chronic pain. Brain-
based tests could serve as an adjunct to self-report and 
behavioural evidence that corroborates, contradicts, 
or says nothing about an individual’s claims about 
pain, distress and impairment. Such tests would be 
particularly valuable for nonverbal populations (chil-
dren and adults who are disabled, very young or have 
dementia, for example), cases in which the evidence 
from verbal reports and behaviour is conflicting, and 
for  
personalized pain management.
As brain imaging measures become increasingly 
acceptable for directing personalized pain manage-
ment in clinical contexts, the pressure to use them for 
medico-legal purposes will increase. Such use of these 
tools, however, would be inappropriate and unethical 
until they were sufficiently validated. Today, the nec-
essary scientific knowledge — including the specificity 
and sensitivity of such tests — and validated protocols 
to enable use of brain imaging evidence in the legal 
system do not exist. Until they do, use of brain-based 
measurements that do not meet minimum standards 
would be detrimental to health care and legal systems, 
potentially harmful to patients and claimants, and 
legally inappropriate (and consequently unethical). In 
our view, current brain-based measures fall short of 
the requisite standards for legal proceedings, but we do 
encourage their use for understanding brain mechan-
isms that underlie pain, factors that lead to persistence 
of pain, and targets in the brain for safe and effective 
pain control.
