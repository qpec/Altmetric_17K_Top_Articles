Scope: Overconsumption of energy-rich food is a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.
The eating habits of many people are characterized by the cycling between overconsumption of
energy-rich foods and dieting, the effects of which on the microbiota are currently unknown.
Methods and results: We compared the fecal microbiota of rats either continuously fed chow or
palatable cafeteria diet to a “cycled” group switched between the two diets (chow for 4, cafeteria
for 3 days/wk, n = 12/group) over 16 wk. Enriched bacterial metabolic pathways were predicted,
and a range of metabolic parameters was correlated to microbial taxa and pathways. Cycled
rats showed large excursions in food intake on each diet switch. When switched from chow to
cafeteria, they overconsumed, and when switched back to chow they underconsumed relative
to those maintained on the two diets. Metabolic parameters of cycled rats were intermediate
between those of the other diet groups (p < 0.05). The microbiota of cycled rats was nearly
indistinguishable from rats under constant cafeteria diet, and both groups were significantly
different to the chow group. Correlation analyses identified microbial metabolic pathways
associated with an obese phenotype.
Conclusion: These data suggest that continuous or intermittent exposure to palatable foods
have similar effects on the gut microbiota.

Introduction
Increased intake of foods that are rich in energy is considered
a major factor in the etiology of metabolic disorders such as
obesity [1, 2]. The motivation to eat energy-rich food to ex-
cess is driven by the pleasure that is derived from consuming
such foods [3]. Further, in some people, eating energy-rich
foods can alleviate stress, while refraining from eating such
foods can trigger it [4]. Recent studies have suggested that

heightened food reward motivation contributes to obesity
through impaired hormonal satiety signaling [5]. Further, dis-
rupted cross-talk between the dopamine and opioid systems
may be responsible in part for altered reward processing in
obesity [6].
The composition of the gut microbiota also plays a major
role in the development of obesity [7]. Several studies have
observed significant changes in the microbiota of animals on
diets with high fat content as compared to chow diets, and es-
tablished strong correlations between specific microbial taxa
(e.g. Blautia, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Phascolarctobac-
terium) and different metabolic parameters (e.g. adiposity,
leptin, triglycerides, and insulin) [8, 9]. Early evidence for a
causal role for the microbiota in obesity came from a study

that transplanted the cecal microbiota of lean or obese mice
into germ-free mice, and observed significantly greater in-
crease in body fat in mice receiving the obese versus the
lean microbiota after 2 wk, despite a lack of difference in
chow intake between the two groups [10]. Changes in the gut
microbiota for obese versus lean human subjects have been
confirmed; however, there is significant variability in the find-
ings of these studies [11–15]. In general, a more unhealthy
diet is associated with a shift in the ratio of Firmicutes to
Bacteroidetes [11–15].
The eating habits of many people in Western society in-
clude “yo-yo” dieting [16], which is characterized by cycling
through overconsumption of energy-rich foods, the stress
produced by dieting, and the alleviation of this stress by con-
sumption of such foods. This diet cycling is associated with
increased risk of binge eating and psychopathology [17], but
the effects of this pattern of eating on the gut microbiota
is unknown. Given the importance of the gut microbiota in
metabolic health, and the influence of diet on the composi-
tion of the gut microbiota [18], we investigated the impact
of free access to a Western-style high-energy cafeteria diet
on the microbiota of rats. We compared the microbiota in
three groups of rats; a group continuously fed this cafeteria
diet, a group that cycled between this diet and chow, and a
control group only fed chow. The aims were to characterize
the gut microbiota induced by the Western-style diet and to
assess how the microbiota was affected by cycling between
this diet and chow. As we previously observed significant re-
lationships between the abundance of the microbiota and a
range of metabolic markers including body weight, fat mass,
insulin, and leptin [8], differences in these markers were also
examined.

Materials and methods
2.1
Subjects
The subjects were 36 experimentally na¨
ıve male Sprague
Dawley rats, obtained from a commercial supplier (Animal
Resource Centre; Perth, Australia), aged 6–8 wk and weigh-
ing 240–280 g upon arrival. They were housed in plastic boxes
(22 cm height × 65 cm length × 40 cm width) with four
rats per box, in a climate controlled room (22�C) on a 12-h
light/dark cycle. Rats were housed four per box due to ethical
requirements to avoid any stress produced by housing rats
individually.
2.2
Diet
After 1 wk acclimation on standard chow and tap water, rats
were assigned to three groups of equal starting body weight
and provided with chow (n = 12), cafeteria (Caf, n = 12), or
cycled (Cyc, n = 12) diets for 16 wk, after which rats were
humanely killed. Each week, rats in the cycled group were
provided
with
the
cafeteria
diet
for
three
successive
days/nights and the chow diet for the remaining 4 days
or nights. Standard chow provided 11 kJ per gram (kJ/g),
12% energy as fat, 20% protein, and 65% carbohydrate (Gor-
don’s Specialty Stockfeeds; NSW, Australia). The cafeteria
diet consisted of standard chow, chow mixed with lard (pig
fat) and condensed milk ( C
�Homebrand), and a range of foods
obtained from a local supermarket. These foods were high in
protein and/or carbohydrates (meat pie, meat wrapped in
rice paper, oats, and dog food roll) or high in fat and sugar
(cake and biscuit). Two foods high in protein/carbohydrates
and two high in fat/sugar were always available and changed
daily. The cafeteria diet provided an average of 15.3 kJ/g, 30%
energy as fat, 12% protein, and 58% as carbohydrate. Further
information regarding the study design and energy intakes
for the three groups can be found in Martire et al. [19].
2.3
Ethics
Ethics approval (09/29B) was granted by the Animal Care and
Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales.
2.4
Sample collection and metabolic parameters
At 16 wk, overnight fasted rats were tested for blood glucose
and then anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine 15/100 mg/kg;
Provet, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). After measurement of
body weight, blood was collected in heparin-coated tubes fol-
lowing cardiac puncture. Blood was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm
for 5 min (Eppendorf Minispin; Crown Scientific, NSW, Aus-
tralia) and the plasma stored at −20�C for hormone (leptin
and insulin) measurements. Rats were killed by decapitation.
Retroperitoneal and epidydimal white adipose tissues were
dissected and weighed. One fecal bolus was collected from
within the distal colon of each rat. Plasma leptin and insulin
concentrations were analyzed using commercially available
radioimmunoassay kits, according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Merck Millipore; Billerica, MA, USA) and counted on
a WIZARD2 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer; Mel-
bourne, VIC, Australia). Results were expressed as mean ±
SEM. ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons
tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software Inc.).
2.5
DNA extraction and 16S-pyrosequencing
DNA was extracted from fecal samples (chow (n = 10), cafete-
ria (n = 11), and cycled (n = 11)) according to an established
protocol [20]. The composition of the microbial communities
was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribo-
somal RNA (rRNA) gene using Tag-encoded FLX amplicon
pyrosequencing (28F, average read length: 400 bp, region:
V1-3) based upon established and validated protocols [21].

then chow-fed rats (Caf: 21370 ± 641 kJ; Cyc: 16879 ± 506 kJ; Chow: 11676 ± 641 kJ; Fs > 28.07, Ps < 0.001). Thus, despite cycled rats
consuming more energy when switched to the cafeteria diet than rats maintained on that diet, they still consumed less energy overall. *

Results and discussion
3.1
Consumption of energy-rich foods alters host
metabolic parameters
Understanding the role of energy-rich foods and dieting
in physiological and microbial changes within the host is
a topic of high importance, given the current obesity epi-
demic and the prevalence of yo-yo dieting. Thus, we investi-
gated the effect of chronic or cycled exposure to energy-rich
cafeteria foods on host metabolic parameters and gut mi-
crobiota. At the end of our experiment, rats on the cycled
diet were 18% heavier than those on the chow diet, but were
significantly lighter than rats on the cafeteria diet (136% of
chow controls). Weekly weight gain data can be found in Mar-
tire et al. [19]. As expected, rats in the Cyc group presented
an intermediate phenotype in relation to weight gain (Fig. 1).
Further, metabolic parameters, including leptin and insulin
concentrations, of rats in the Cyc group were intermediate
between rats on chow or cafeteria diets (Fig. 1). Statistical
differences between each diet group are presented in Fig. 1.
These results are consistent with previous studies showing
that animals exposed to high fat or energy-rich diets exhibit
changes in metabolic parameters [8,26,27].
3.2
Cycled exposure to energy-rich foods
significantly shifts the gut microbiota toward
a profile associated with obesity
Rats on each of the diets had significantly different micro-
biota at the operational taxonomic unit level (permutational
ANOVA, PERMANOVA (Bray Curtis, square-root transfor-
mation): Pseudo-F = 3.4494, p = 0.001), a difference that was
significant across all taxonomic levels (Phylum: Pseudo-F =
3.4593, p = 0.005; Class: Pseudo-F = 4.3329, p = 0.003; Order:
Pseudo-F = 4.3856, p = 0.003; Family: Pseudo-F = 4.0588,

p = 0.001, Genus: Pseudo-F = 7.3174, p = 0.001). Given
that co-housed rodents tend to display similarities in their
microbiota profiles, we excluded the possibility that housing
(caging) was solely responsible for the observed differences
by performing a nested PERMANOVA with diet and hous-
ing as factors. While housing was found to have a significant
effect on the microbiota, the effect of diet was still highly sig-
nificant (Pseudo-F = 2.5253, p = 0.008). While these results
implicate housing as an important factor for consideration in
microbiota studies, and indicate that this variable should be
accounted for, nonetheless our diet had a clear impact on the
microbiota of the three groups.
Several diversity indices were then examined across diet
groups. While the total number of species and species rich-
ness dropped significantly with intake of cafeteria food (Num-
ber of species: Chow: 365 ± 66, Caf: 285 ± 32, Cycl: 293
± 20; Richness (d): Chow: 79 ± 14, Caf: 62 ± 7, Cyc: 63
± 4), Shannon’s diversity (H�) remained the same across
groups (H�: Chow: 4.3 ± 0.3, Caf: 4.1 ± 0.2, Cyc: 4.2 ± 0.2).
The similarity in H� was likely a result of species evenness
(J�, Pielou’s evenness) remaining stable irrespective of diet
(J�: Chow: 0.75 ± 0.04, Caf: 0.74 ± 0.03, Cyc: 0.74 ± 0.02),
which suggested that the species lost with intake of cafete-
ria food were those that were naturally in low abundance.
Strikingly, the total number of species and species richness
of the Cyc group was not intermediate between Chow and
Caf groups, as was observed for body weight and metabolic
parameters, but rather, they were highly similar to the Caf
group. The similarity between the Cyc and Caf groups was
further established using nonmetric multidimensional scal-
ing and CLUSTER analyses, which confirmed that the Cyc
and Caf groups were clearly differentiated from the Chow
group but not from each other (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover,
canonical analysis of principal coordinates revealed good dif-
ferentiation between the Cyc and Caf groups on the one hand
and the Chow group on the other, and also showed some
overlap between the Cyc and Caf groups with two rats from
the Caf group clustering with the Cyc group. Indeed, pairwise
PERMANOVAs confirmed that while Chow-fed rats could be
differentiated from rats fed Caf or Cyc diets across all taxo-
nomic classifications, Cyc- and Caf-fed rats were only differ-
ent at the genus and operational taxonomic unit level (see
Supporting Information Table 1).
The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was Chow: 7.4,
Caf: 2.4, and Cyc: 3.8, despite the similarity in the relative
abundance of Firmicutes across groups (Chow: 71.1%, Caf:
64.1%, and Cyc: 70.9%). However, little can be inferred from
these measures given that they are at the phylum level.
Microbial taxa responsible for the differences between
the diet groups were identified and plotted onto heat maps
(Fig.
2C
and
D).
Large
increases
in
Bacteroidaceae
(Bacteroides),
Porphyromoadaceae,
and
Coriobacteriaceae
(Collinsella) as well as a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae
(Escherichia/Shigella) were observed in rats exposed to cafe-
teria diet. The two highly related microbial taxa, Ruminococ-
caceae and Lachnospiraceae, were also highly responsive to
cafeteria diet (Fig. 2C and D). These findings were supported
by principal component analysis and linear discriminant anal-
ysis effect size analysis at the genus level (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. 2). Based on percentage relative abundances, it
appears that unclassified members of Ruminococcaceae are
initially replaced by Blautia (Lachnospiraceae) upon intake of
smaller quantities of cafeteria diet across time (Cyc diet).
However, continuous exposure to cafeteria diet resulted in
equally higher levels of Blautia and Ruminococcus, suggest-
ing that Blautia spp. may be early responders to high-fat diets.
This is of particular interest given that Blautia is a major con-
tributor toward production of short-chain fatty acids levels in
the gut, and has recently been found to reflect host preference
and specificity [28].
The
biological
importance
of
the
microbial
taxa
Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, and the phyla Firmi-
cutes as a whole, in relation to diets with high-fat content
is further emphasized by their significant correlation (Pear-
son’s r) with a range of metabolic parameters, including body
weight, fat, insulin, and leptin concentrations (Table 1).
3.3
Predictive metagenomics identifies microbial
metabolic pathways that fluctuate with diet
Given the significant changes in gut microbiota following ex-
posure to energy-rich foods, we then employed PICRUSt to
predict the metagenomes and determine the changes in mi-
crobial metabolic pathways across different diets. Several mi-
crobial metabolic pathways differed significantly across diet
types (Fig. 3). Consistent with the similarities in microbial
composition of the two groups consuming cafeteria foods,
substantial similarities were also observed between pathway
counts in the Caf and Cyc groups (Fig. 3). The importance
of these microbial metabolic pathways is further emphasized
by the correlation of their counts with a range of metabolic
parameters, including body weight, fat, and concentrations
of insulin and leptin (Table 2).
Microbial fatty acid metabolism pathways such as arachi-
donic acid metabolism and �-linolenic acid metabolism were
depleted in both groups of rats exposed to the cafeteria
diet (Fig. 3). This depletion suggests that the imbalances of
dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids associated with
visceral obesity [29] are related to changes in gut microbial
composition that leads to imbalances in microbial fatty acid
metabolism. The depletion of these pathways is consistent
with the findings of Perng and colleagues who observed
an inverse correlation between development of adiposity in
school-age children and levels of �-linolenic acid [30]. Finally,
synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, which is asso-
ciated with fatty acid metabolism, was also decreased in the
gut microbiota of the two groups exposed to the cafeteria diet
(Fig. 3). This is in line with the findings that production and
use of ketone bodies are lower in obese women than in lean
controls [31].

The decrease in D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism in
rats fed cafeteria foods (Fig. 3) is also of interest, given that
dietary L-arginine supplementation reduces adiposity in ge-
netically obese rats, diet-induced obese rats, pigs, and obese
human subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus [32,33]. Another
microbial pathway that was depleted by exposure to cafete-
ria diet was geraniol degradation (Fig. 3). Geraniol reduces
inflammation and free radical injury produced by fructose-
induced metabolic syndrome through the activation of PPAR-
� [34]. The relationship between gut microbial geraniol
degradation and metabolic syndrome should be investigated
further.
An important novel finding of this study is the identifi-
cation of a negative association between the consumption of
a cafeteria diet containing many foods eaten by people and
the abundance of microbial pathways related to flavonoid
metabolism (Fig. 3). Flavonoids have been suggested to not
only assist in weight loss [35], but also exert neuroprotective
functions within the brain, such as protection of neurons
against injury induced by neurotoxins [36,37]. More recently,
grape polyphenols have been shown to modify gut microbial
composition, resulting in lower inflammation and improved
metabolic outcomes [38]. Thus, these compounds, and to a
lesser extent, the microbial species that metabolize these com-
pounds (e.g. Flavonifractor and Pseudoflavonifractor) should be
examined for a potential concomitant role in the digestive and
nervous systems in diet-induced obesity.
In contrast to depletion of these pathways, primary and
secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways were enriched in
the gut microbiota of rats exposed to cafeteria foods (Fig. 3).
This is to be expected given that bile acids play an important
role in absorption of nutrients and regulating lipid, glucose,
and energy metabolism [39].
One limitation of this analysis is that it relies on predicting
the metagenomes from 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence
data. Thus, the PICRUSt results should be interpreted with
caution, and in future studies, shotgun whole genome se-
quencing should be performed to examine the enrichment of
microbial metabolic pathways following exposure to cafeteria
diet.

Concluding remarks
We have contrasted continuous and intermittent exposure to
unhealthy western foods to model the modern lifestyle. Im-
portantly, our findings indicate that intermittent exposure to
cafeteria diet (3 days/wk) is sufficient to extensively shift the
gut microbiota toward the pattern seen in rats consuming
the diet continuously. A range of microbial metabolic path-
ways were associated with the consumption of energy-rich
foods and changes in host metabolic parameters. In partic-
ular, flavone, flavonol, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways
were found to be negatively associated with exposure to such
foods, which is of significant interest, given that these com-
pounds also play a role in brain function. While a causal
role for Ruminococcus and Blautia spp. in weight gain is
yet to be established, our results suggest that these taxa are
promising targets for future therapeutic strategies against
metabolic disorders.
