Abstract
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased cardiovascular
(CV) risk. We tested the hypothesis that PTSD patients have augmented sympathetic nervous
system (SNS) and haemodynamic reactivity during mental stress, as well as impaired arterial
baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Fourteen otherwise healthy Veterans with combat-related PTSD
were compared with 14 matched Controls without PTSD. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity
(MSNA), continuous blood pressure (BP) and electrocardiography were measured at baseline, as
well as during two types of mental stress: combat-related mental stress using virtual reality combat
exposure (VRCE) and non-combat related stress using mental arithmetic (MA). A cold pressor
test (CPT) was administered for comparison. BRS was tested using pharmacological manipulation
of BP via the Modified Oxford technique at rest and during VRCE. Blood samples were analysed
for inflammatory biomarkers. Baseline characteristics, MSNA and haemodynamics were similar
between the groups. In PTSD vs. Controls, MSNA (+8.2 ± 1.0 vs. +1.2 ± 1.3 bursts min–1,
P < 0.001) and heart rate responses (+3.2 ± 1.1 vs. −2.3 ± 1.0 beats min–1, P = 0.003) were
significantly augmented during VRCE. Similarly, in PTSD vs. Controls, MSNA (+21.0 ± 2.6 vs.
+6.7 ± 1.5 bursts min–1, P < 0.001) and diastolic BP responses (+6.3 ± 1.0 vs. +3.5 ± 1.0 mmHg,
P = 0.011) were significantly augmented during MA but not during CPT (P = not significant). In
the PTSD group, sympathetic BRS (–1.2 ± 0.2 vs. –2.0 ± 0.3 burst incidence mmHg−1, P = 0.026)

and cardiovagal BRS (9.5 ± 1.4 vs. 23.6 ± 4.3 ms mmHg−1, P = 0.008) were significantly blunted
at rest. PTSD patients had significantly higher highly sensitive-C-reactive protein levels compared
to Controls (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 1.0 ± 0.3 mg L−1, P = 0.047). Augmented SNS and haemodynamic
responses to mental stress, blunted BRS and inflammation may contribute to an increased CV
risk in PTSD.

Introduction
Post-traumaticstressdisorder(PTSD)isahighlyprevalent
mental health condition amongst both military Veterans
and the general population in those who have been
exposed to psychologically traumatic events. This disorder
is associated with a significantly increased risk for the
development of cardiovascular (CV) disease and hyper-
tension (Kang et al. 2006; Bedi & Arora, 2007; Kubzansky
et al. 2007; Boscarino, 2008; Cohen et al. 2009; Kubzansky
et al. 2009; Edmondson et al. 2013; Vaccarino et al. 2013;
Beristianos et al. 2016). Multiple large epidemiological
studies have demonstrated an independent link between
PTSD and the risk of CV disease and hypertension
(Kang et al. 2006; Bedi & Arora, 2007; Kubzansky et al.
2007; Boscarino, 2008; Cohen et al. 2009; Kubzansky
et al. 2009; Edmondson et al. 2013; Vaccarino et al.
2013; Beristianos et al. 2016); however, the physiological
mechanisms underlying this association have not been
determined. Prior studies have demonstrated a decrease
in low frequency heart rate (HR) variability (Cohen et al.
1998; Chang et al. 2013; Shah et al. 2013) and increased
urinary noradrenaline levels (Wingenfeld et al. 2015)
in PTSD patients, suggestive of heightened sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) activity, which could be a potential
mechanism contributing to an increased risk of CV
disease and hypertension. Despite these findings, direct
assessments of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) have
never previously been measured in this population or
used to assess SNS and haemodynamic reactivity to mental
stress, nor have they been used to investigate aberrancies
in SNS regulation such as blunted arterial baroreflex
sensitivity that could contribute to chronic SNS over-
activity and subsequently to an increased CV risk.
The present study aimed to investigate haemodynamic
and SNS reactivity and regulation at rest and during
mental stress in young PTSD patients, prior to the
development of hypertension and CV disease. The study
population included young, otherwise healthy military
Veterans with and without PTSD from the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation
IraqiFreedomandOperationNewDawn;OEF/OIF/OND,
respectively). We tested the hypothesis that Veterans with
PTSD have significantly greater SNS and haemodynamic
responses during mental stress associated with their
PTSD symptoms (i.e. combat-related mental stress). We
further hypothesized that these augmented sympathetic
and haemodynamic responses extend to other forms of
mental stress (i.e. non-combat-related mental stress) and
are mediated by blunted arterial baroreflex sensitivity
(BRS) and increased inflammation. Characterizing SNS
reactivity and regulation in PTSD could uncover key
physiological alterations in autonomic function in PTSD
patients, which could, in turn, expedite the development
of therapies to mitigate SNS overactivation and thereby
improve long-term CV risk in these patients.
Methods
Ethical approval
This study conformed to the standards set by the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Emory
University Institutional Review Board (IRB #54697) and
the Atlanta VA Medical Centre Research and Development
Committee. All participants provided signed informed
consent for study participation via forms approved by the
aforementioned regulatory committees.
Study population
The study population consisted of 28 participants: 14
patients with PTSD and 14 age-matched Controls without
PTSD. All study participants (both PTSD and Controls)
were physically healthy OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, without
hypertension or other medical comorbidities. Participants

were recruited from mental health clinics serving
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans at the Atlanta VA Medical
Center and surrounding clinics. Exclusion criteria for all
participants included hypertension, smoking, diabetes,
heart or vascular disease, illicit drug use, excessive
alcohol use (> 2 drinks per day), hyperlipidaemia, auto-
nomic dysfunction, medications known to affect SNS
(clonidine, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors), treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors
and any serious systemic disease. Participants with a prior
documented diagnosis of PTSD from medical records
were recruited to the PTSD group and those without a
prior diagnosis were recruited to the Control group. The
diagnosis of PTSD was confirmed in PTSD patients and
excluded in Controls using the Clinician Administered
PTSD Scale for DSM (CAPS)-IV (Blake et al. 1995) or the
PTSD Checklist – Military Version (PCL-M) (Blanchard
et al. 1996). PTSD patients required a CAPS severity score
of � 45 to confirm the presence of PTSD (Weathers et al.
2001).
Measurements and procedures
Blood pressure. Beat-to-beat arterial BP was measured
continuously and non-invasively using digital pulse
photoplethysmography
(CNAP;
CNSystems,
Graz,
Austria). Absolute values of BP were calibrated with
upper arm BP readings at the start and every 15 min
throughout the study. This device has been validated to
reflect accurate absolute and beat-to-beat fluctuations
in BP when compared to invasive intra-arterial catheter
readings (Jeleazcov et al. 2010; Ilies et al. 2012).
Muscle
sympathetic
nerve
activity. Multiunit
post-
ganglionic sympathetic nerve activity directed to muscle
(MSNA) was recorded from the peroneal nerve using
microneurography, as described previously (Vallbo et al.
1979; Wallin & Fagius, 1988). A tungsten microelectrode
(tip diameter 5–15 μm; Bioengineering, University of
Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA) was inserted into the nerve and a
reference microelectrode was inserted in close proximity.
The signals were amplified (total gain 50 000–100 000),
filtered (700–2000 Hz), rectified and integrated (time
constant 0.1 s) to obtain a mean voltage display of
sympathetic nerve activity (Nerve Traffic Analyzer, Model
662C-4; Bioengineering, University of Iowa). The neuro-
gram was recorded using LabChart 7 (PowerLab 16sp;
ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia) along with continuous
ECG recordings using a bioamp. All MSNA recordings
met previously established criteria (Delius et al. 1972a, b;
Manoetal.2006)andwereanalysedbyasingleinvestigator
who was blinded to the participant’s status as a Control
or patient. MSNA was expressed as burst frequency
(bursts per minute) and total activity (arbitrary units per
minute).
Virtual reality combat exposure (VRCE). Participants
wore head-mounted goggles with peripheral display and
stereo earphones for auditory input (SamSung Gear
VR, Ridgefield Park, NJ, USA). These goggles displayed
computer-generated first-person battle scenarios from
Iraq (Virtual Iraq for OIF/OND) and Afghanistan (Virtual
Afghanistan for OEF) (Rizzo et al. 2010, 2011; Rothbaum
et al. 2010, 2014; McLay et al. 2011; Roy et al. 2013)
for a duration of 3 min, followed by an additional
4 min during concomitant arterial baroreflex testing.
These VRCE clips have been shown to increase reactivity
of psychophysiological measures, such as acoustic startle,
fear-enhanced startle and galvanic skin response (Roy
et al. 2013), are associated with elevations in startle
reactivity and salivary cortisol levels (Rothbaum et al.
2014; Norrholm et al. 2016) and have been reported by
patients as immersive and anxiogenic.
Mental stress via mental arithmetic (MA). Participants
were asked to serially subtract a one or two digit number
from a three or four digit number and were urged to do
so as quickly and accurately as possible, for a duration
of 3 min (Carter et al. 2005; Carter & Ray, 2009). An
investigator used flash cards with a three or four digit
number and were urged by two additional study team
members in white coats to answer ‘faster’ and ‘get it
right’. This test has been shown to induce mental stress
and increase MSNA (by �5–15 bursts min–1) and BP (by
�10–16 mmHg), as well as HR (by�16–24 beats min–1),
in both healthy humans and patient groups (Matsukawa
etal.1991b;Nolletal.1996;Dishmanetal.2003;Kuniyoshi
et al. 2003; Carter et al. 2013).
Arterial BRS testing using the Modified Oxford technique.
The gold standard method for evaluation of arterial
BRS is performed by measuring changes in MSNA and
R-R interval during arterial BP changes induced by
nitroprusside and phenylephrine (Rudas et al. 1999).
Sodium nitroprusside (100 μg in 10 mL of normal
saline (NS)) was bolused through an antecubital I.V.
catheter, followed 60 s later by a bolus of phenylephrine
(150 μg in 10 mL of NS) during continuous MSNA,
ECG and haemodynamic monitoring. Medications were
room temperature at the time of administration. These
medications induce a decrease of �15 mmHg, followed
by an increase of �15 mmHg in arterial BP.
Cold pressor test (CPT). CPT is a standard human
physiology
research
technique
with
a
powerful
sympathoexcitatory and pressor effect that was performed
by submerging the participant’s hand up to the wrist
in an ice-water slurry (�0–1°C) for 1 min (Wood
et al. 1984; Victor et al. 1987; Fagius et al. 1989; Cui
et al. 2002; Dishman et al. 2003; Park et al. 2012). SNS
activation during CPT is not regulated by baroreflexes

(Cui et al. 2002) and allows for discernment between
baroreflex-mediated vs. generalized or non-baroreflex
mediated increases in SNS activation.
Inflammatory
biomarkers. Blood was drawn in all
subjects at baseline for the following inflammatory
biomarkers: highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-6. hsCRP was determined
by immunoturbidometric method on the Beckman
AU460 (Beckman Diagnostics, LaBrea, CA, USA) using
reagent kits from Sekisui Diagnostics (Lexington, MA,
USA).
IL-2 and IL-6 measurements were determined
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
CAPS-IV and the PCL-M. The diagnosis of PTSD was
confirmed in PTSD patients and excluded in Controls
using CAPS-IV or PCL-M. CAPS-IV was administered
and interpreted by a single trained investigator for all
participants. A severity score of � 45 on either survey
was required to confirm the presence of PTSD (Weathers
& Ruscio, 1999; Weathers et al. 2001).
Experimental protocol
Screening visits. All participants presented for one or two
screening visits prior to experimental procedures. During
the screening visit(s), BP was taken a total of three times
(separated by 5 min) and averaged to ensure the absence
of hypertension and obtain baseline values. CAPS-IV or
the PCL-M was performed during the screening visit to
confirm the diagnosis of PTSD in patients and to exclude
the diagnosis of PTSD in Controls.
Experimental study visit. All participants were studied
in the morning, after abstaining from food, caffeine and
alcohol for at least 12 h, as well as smoking and exercise
for at least 24 h. The study room was quiet, semidark
and temperate (�21° C). Participants were placed in a
supine position on a comfortable stretcher. A 20 gauge I.V.
catheter was placed into the antecubital vein of the arm
and blood was obtained for inflammatory biomarkers.
Finger cuffs were fitted and placed on the fingers of
the dominant arm for continuous beat-to-beat arterial
BP measurements, and an upper arm cuff was placed
for intermittent automatic calibrations with the finger
cuffs. ECG patch electrodes were placed for continuous
ECG recordings and a belt-type sensor was placed
for monitoring continuous respiratory rates. The leg
was positioned for microneurography, and the tungsten
microelectrode was inserted and manipulated to obtain a
satisfactory nerve recording. After 10 min of rest, baseline
BP, HRand MSNA were recorded continuously for 15 min.
After baseline measurements, BRS testing was performed
byinfusing I.V.bolusesof100μgofnitroprusside,followed
60 s later by 150 μg of phenylephrine, as described above.
After 30 min of rest to ensure sufficient washout of drugs
and return to baseline conditions, participants underwent
mental arithmetic for 3 min and VRCE for 3 min. The
order of these manoeuvres was randomized and separated
by 30 min of rest. In a subset of participants, VRCE was
extended for an additional 4 min, during which time
BRS testing was repeated by infusing nitroprusside and
phenylephrine during concomitant VRCE. After 30 min
of rest, the cold pressor test was performed for 1 min.
Data analysis
MSNA. MSNA, BP and ECG data from the study visit
were exported from Labchart 7 into WinCPRS (Absolute
Aliens, Turku, Finland) for analysis. The software auto-
matically marks the R-waves from the continuous ECG
recording that was then reviewed and edited manually if
needed. MSNA bursts were detected and marked by the
software using the criteria: 3:1 burst to noise ratio within
a 0.5 s search window, with an average latency of 1.2–1.4 s
from the previous R-wave. The MSNA neurograms were
also inspected for accuracy of detection by a single
investigator (JP) and edited if needed. For total activity
measurements, burst amplitudes were normalized by
assigning the largest burst amplitude during at least 5 min
of baseline recordings to be equated to a measurement of
1000 arbitrary units (AU). MSNA was expressed as burst
frequency (bursts min–1), burst incidence [bursts (100
heart beats)–1], and total activity (AU min–1), which is
a sum of the amplitudes of normalized bursts min–1.
Assessment of BRS. Sympathetic BRS was defined as the
slope of the linear regression between values of MSNA
(burst incidence and total activity) on the y-axis and the
diastolic BP on the x-axis derived during the 2 min of drug
boluses and following 2 min of data. Linear regression was
performed using the WinCPRS program that grouped
diastolic BP into 3 mmHg bins and then averaged the
MSNAburstincidenceandnormalizedtotalactivityvalues
within each bin. Cardiovagal BRS was assessed as the slope
of the linear regression between R-R intervals measured
from the continuous ECG recording and the systolic BP
during drug infusions. Only regressions with a coefficient
of determination (R2) > 0.70 were included in the analysis.
The operating point around which the arterial baroreflex
operates was derived from the mean resting systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, with the corresponding mean
R-R interval, MSNA burst incidence and normalized
MSNA total activity during at least 5 min of baseline
recordings.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). Baseline characteristics and baroreflex slopes were

Results
Baseline characteristics
There was no significant difference in age, sex, race, weight
or body mass index between groups (Table 1). Groups
were well-matched for age with a mean ± SEM age of
34.4 ± 1.7 years in PTSD patients and 32.2 ± 1.5 years in
Controls. The majority of participants in each group were
African-American and male. There were no significant
differences in the presence of comorbid depression or use
ofserotoninreuptakeinhibitorsbetweenthegroups.Mean
baseline blood pressure and HR were similar between
the groups. There was no significant difference in resting
MSNA quantified as burst frequency, burst incidence or
total activity between the groups. As expected, the mean
CAPS-IV score was significantly higher amongst the PTSD
patients compared to Controls without PTSD.
VRCE
These
experiments
aimed
to
determine
whether
the
haemodynamic
and
MSNA
responses
during
combat-related mental stress (i.e. mental stress related
to PTSD symptoms) were augmented amongst young
Veterans with PTSD. During 3 min of VRCE, there was
no statistically significant difference in the SBP, DBP
and MAP, responses during VRCE between the groups
(Fig. 1A–C)(Table 2). However, there was a small but
significantly greater increase in HR during VRCE amongst
PTSD patients compared to Controls (ANOVA, F test,
P = 0.003) (Fig. 1D). There was also a significantly greater
increase in MSNA quantified as change in burst frequency
(ANOVA, F test, P < 0.001) and total activity (ANOVA,
F test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1E and F) amongst PTSD patients
compared to Controls.
MA
These
experiments
aimed
to
determine
whether
the
haemodynamic
and
MSNA
responses
during
non-combat-related mental stress (i.e. mental stress that
was not related to PTSD symptoms) were augmented
amongst young Veterans with PTSD. During 3 min of MA,
there was no significant difference in the SBP response
amongst PTSD patients compared to Controls (Fig. 2A)
(Table 2). However, there was a significantly greater
increase in the DBP response amongst PTSD patients
(ANOVA, F test, P = 0.011) (Fig. 2B), although there was
no statistically significant difference in the MAP and HR
responses during MA between the groups (Fig. 2C and
D). There was a significantly greater increase in MSNA
quantified as change in burst frequency (ANOVA, F test,
P < 0.001) amongst PTSD patients compared to Controls
(Fig. 2E) and a trend towards a significant difference when
quantified as change in MSNA total activity (ANOVA, F
test, P = 0.056) (Fig. 2F).
CPT
These experiments aimed to determine whether there was
a difference in the haemodynamic and MSNA responses
between PTSD patients and Controls during a non-mental

stress type of sympathoexcitatory stimulus that is not
mediated by arterial baroreflexes (Cui et al. 2002) for
comparison.During1minofCPT,therewasnosignificant
difference in the MSNA response quantified as the change
in burst frequency or change in total activity between the
PTSD and Control groups (Fig. 3A and B) (Table 2). There
was also no significant difference in BP and HR responses
during CPT between the groups (Fig. 3C and D).
Arterial BRS
Sympathetic BRS was quantified as the slope of the
linear relationship between MSNA burst incidence and
diastolic BP during pharmacological manipulation of
BP. This standard quantification method controls for
potential differences in HR responses during baroreflex
testing. At baseline, the mean slope of the individual
linear regressions between MSNA burst incidence and
diastolic BP was significantly less steep in PTSD patients
vs. Controls, demonstrating decreased sympathetic BRS
in PTSD patients (P = 0.026) (Fig. 4A and B). Similarly,
underbaselineconditions,themeanslopeoftheindividual
linear regressions between RRI and systolic BP was
significantly less steep in PTSD patients vs. Controls,
demonstrating decreased cardiovagal BRS in the PTSD
group (P = 0.008) (Fig. 4C and D).
Arterial baroreflex sensitivity was repeated in a sub-
set of PTSD (N = 9) and Controls (N = 11) during
concomitant VRCE. Several of the participants in each
group did not have repeat baroreflex testing as a result
of side effects during IV nitroprusside administration,
including headache, palpitations and hypotension. There
was no difference in baseline BRS in the subset of Controls
and PTSD subjects that had repeat baroreflex testing.
During VRCE, there was no difference in the mean
slope of the individual linear regressions between MSNA
burst incidence and diastolic BP between PTSD patients
and Controls, demonstrating no significant difference
in sympathetic BRS during VRCE between the groups
(P = 0.135) (Fig. 5A and B). However, the mean slope
of the individual linear regressions between the RRI and
systolic BP was significantly less steep in PTSD patients
vs. Controls, demonstrating decreased cardiovagal BRS in
PTSD patients during VRCE (P = 0.014) (Fig. 5C and D).
Inflammatory biomarkers
PTSD patients had significantly elevated hsCRP levels
(PTSD vs. Controls, 2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 1.0 ± 0.3 mg L−1,
P = 0.047) (Fig. 6A). There was no significant difference
in IL-2 or IL-6 levels between the groups (Fig. 6B and
C). There was a significant linear relationship between

Discussion
Thepresentstudyfocusedonarelativelyyoungpopulation
of Veterans from the current combat operations in Iraq
and Afghanistan without hypertension or CV disease. The
aim was to identify pre-existing biological mechanisms
that are present in young individuals who are currently
healthy but at increased risk of CV disease and hyper-
tension by virtue of having PTSD (Cohen et al. 2009).
More than 2 000 000 OEF/OIF/OND service members
have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan over the
past 15 years and are returning with high rates of PTSD,
estimated at up to 20% post-deployment (Hoge et al.
2004). PTSD is also common in the civilian population
(Bedi & Arora, 2007) and is associated with significant
impairment, making PTSD a major public health problem
(Kessler, 2000). One less well-recognized but highly
significant consequence of PTSD is an increased risk of
hypertension and CV disease (Brudey et al. 2015). In
a prospective study that included 562 twins discordant
for PTSD, those with PTSD had more than two-fold
greater risk of developing coronary heart disease than
their counterparts without PTSD, and this association
remained significant even after controlling for lifestyle
factors, comorbidities and major depression (Vaccarino
et al. 2013). Data from the US National Comorbidity
Survey showed that PTSD patients had a 2.9-fold greater
risk for developing hypertension (Kibler et al. 2009) and
multivariate analyses that included over 300 000 OEF/OIF
Veterans showed that those with PTSD had a 59% higher
chance of developing hypertension (Cohen et al. 2009).
In a prospective study of over 4000 Vietnam Veterans
without CV disease at baseline, those with PTSD had a
2.2-fold greater risk of CV mortality determined using a
multivariatemodelthatadjustedforcomorbidconditions,
lifestyle and combat exposure (Boscarino, 2008). In older
Veterans without CV disease at baseline, PTSD was
associated with a significantly greater risk of developing
CV disease, chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction
and peripheral vascular disease (Beristianos et al. 2016).
Thus, multiple large epidemiological studies demonstrate
that PTSD is significantly and independently associated
with an increased risk of hypertension, CV disease and
mortality.
The mechanisms underlying the association between
PTSD and CV risk have not been fully determined. PTSD
patients have chronic ongoing mental stress that may lead
to biological changes as a result of allostasis. Allostasis
(Bedi & Arora, 2007) refers to physiological adjustments
made to meet demands from external challenges. Such
allostatic responses are engaged during times of stress

and include activation of the SNS, which is initially
adaptive. However, we hypothesized that exposure to
extreme stress with subsequent development of PTSD
results in chronic physiological changes as a result
of high ‘allostatic load’, including chronic elevations
of SNS activity, which is maladaptive. High allostatic
load also leads to inflammation and oxidative stress,
which in turn could lead to SNS overactivity directly
via central effects, and indirectly via arterial baroreflex
dysfunction. SNS overactivity has a major role in causing
and sustaining hypertension (Grassi, 2009), which is a
major risk factor for CV disease, and also leads to a
number of deleterious effects on end organs that are
independentofbloodpressure,includingthedevelopment
of heart failure (Julius, 1993), arrhythmias (Grassi et al.
2004), atherogenesis (Erami et al. 2002), insulin resistance
(Jamerson et al. 1993) and renal sclerosis (Amann et al.
2000).
Prior studies have provided indirect evidence that
PTSD may be characterized by SNS overactivity. PTSD
patients have a higher resting HR and BP, as well as
decreased HR variability, suggesting a state of chronic
SNS overactivity (Buckley & Kaloupek, 2001; Bedi &
Arora, 2007). Studies have shown that PTSD patients
have decreased low-frequency and high-frequency HR
variability (Cohen et al. 1998; Chang et al. 2013; Shah et al.
2013), suggestive of increased sympathetic and decreased
parasympathetic tone to the heart. In addition, urinary
noradrenaline levels have been shown to be significantly
elevated in PTSD patients compared to Controls without
PTSD (Wingenfeld et al. 2015). In the present study,
we present the first direct assessments of sympathetic
nerve activity using microneurography in PTSD patients
compared to age-matched Controls. Although we did not
observe baseline differences between the groups in MSNA
or haemodynamics at rest, PTSD patients had significantly
augmented MSNA responses during both combat-related
and non-combat-related mental stress. These data suggest
that SNS drive in these patients is exacerbated by mental
stress associated with PTSD symptoms, such as that
experienced during flashbacks, as well as non-related
mental stressors.

by blunted haemodynamic responses during mental
stress induced by recall of traumatic events (Cohen
et al. 1998). A unique feature of the present studies is

continuous beat to beat haemodynamics during two
different types of mental stress: (i) combat-related mental
stress (i.e. mental stress that is associated with PTSD
symptoms) and (ii) non-combat-related mental stress
that is not related to PTSD symptoms. We showed that
young Veterans with PTSD have significantly greater
increases in MSNA and HR during VRCE compared to
Controls, suggesting that PTSD patients have heightened
sympathetic
and
haemodynamic
responses
during
combat-related mental stress. PTSD patients also had
augmented MSNA and diastolic BP responses during
mental arithmetic, suggesting that these exaggerated
haemodynamic and sympathetic responses also extend
to non-combat related mental stress in PTSD. However,
there was no difference in the haemodynamic and MSNA
responses during the CPT, suggesting that augmented
haemodynamic and sympathetic responses are not
generalized to all sympathoexcitatory stimuli, nor to
non-baroreflex-mediated stimuli. Thus, the augmented
SNS and haemodynamic responses in PTSD are specific
to mental stress, both related and unrelated to PTSD
symptoms. Exaggerated increases in SNS activity during
mental stress could contribute to an increased risk of
hypertension and CV disease by increasing the burden
of SNS activity. Moreover, exaggerated SNS responses
during mental stress have been shown to be associated
with an increased risk of hypertension (Matthews et al.
1993) and CV disease (Proietti et al. 2011).
VRCE is considered a neutral stimulus in those without
combat-related PTSD; therefore, it is not surprising that
there was minimal MSNA and BP reactivity observed
during VRCE amongst the Control group. However, in
PTSD patients, the MSNA response was significantly
heightened during VRCE but, despite the heightened
MSNA response, the BP responses were not augmented.
By contrast, MSNA responses during MA were also
significantly augmented in PTSD, although they were
accompanied by concomitant augmentation of diastolic
BP responses. These observations suggest that there
may be differences in the degree of vasoconstriction
and therefore increase in blood pressure in response to
sympathetic nerve activation (i.e. neurovascular trans-
duction) during combat-related vs. non-combat-related
mental stress in PTSD. Although not tested in the
present study, the differences in neurovascular trans-
duction observed between stress protocols could be a
result of differences in the release of noradrenaline at
sympathetic nerve terminals, the generation of vaso-
dilators and alternative vasoconstrictors, and adrenergic
receptor density and responsiveness. In particular, chronic

elevations in sympathetic activation during stress related
to PTSD symptoms, could lead to downregulation of α-1
adrenergic receptors, as has been suggested in other states
characterized by high sympathetic activity (Feng et al.
1999;Dinennoetal.2002),andthismayleadtobluntedBP
responses relative to the degree of sympathetic activation.
These and other mechanisms underlying neurovascular
transduction during mental stress in PTSD should be
evaluated in future studies.
One potential mechanism underlying SNS over-
activation in PTSD is decreased arterial BRS. The arterial
baroreceptors are important in the moment-to-moment
control of BP by buffering acute fluctuations in arterial
BP during postural, physiological or mental stress. In
addition, arterial baroreceptors tonically inhibit SNS
activity to maintain BP around a set point. BRS is
diminished or blunted if increases and decreases in BP
via the baroreflex arc fail to elicit the appropriate changes
in SNS activity (sympathetic BRS) and parasympathetic
activity (cardiovagal BRS) to maintain appropriate levels
of arterial BP, or are chronically reset to higher BP levels
as in chronic hypertension. Using the Modified Oxford
technique to assess arterial baroreflex sensitivity, we
showedthatbaselinesympatheticandcardiovagalBRSwas
indeed blunted in PTSD patients compared to Controls,
and also that cardiovagal BRS was blunted during
concomitant combat-related mental stress, suggesting that
impaired BRS may contribute to abnormal SNS responses

during mental stress in PTSD. Decreased BRS contributes
to the pathogenesis of many conditions characterized by
SNS overactivity, including chronic heart failure (Grassi
et al. 1995), obesity (Grassi et al. 1998) and hypertension
(Matsukawa et al. 1991a), and the data obtained in the
present study demonstrate that impaired BRS is present
in Veterans with PTSD. Decreased BRS could be one
contributing mechanisms underlying the link between
PTSD and cardiovascular disease risk.
Chronic inflammation may contribute to blunted BRS
in PTSD because several studies have demonstrated
that immune dysfunction is present in this population
(von Kanel et al. 2007; Spitzer et al. 2010; Plantinga
et al. 2013) and, in experimental animal models of
CV disease, anti-inflammatory treatments have been
shown to affect autonomic and baroreceptor function
(Marvar et al. 2016). PTSD is associated with higher
circulating levels of inflammatory markers (von Kanel
et al. 2007; Spitzer et al. 2010; Plantinga et al. 2013)
including CRP, IL-4, IL-6 and intercellular adhesion
molecule-1,higherbrainangiotensinIIlevels(Matsumura
et al. 1998; Saavedra et al. 2011), and greater arterial
stiffness (Walczewska et al. 2011). In the population in
the present study, we found that young OEF/OIF/OND
patients with PTSD had significantly elevated hsCRP
levels compared to age-matched Controls, suggesting
that chronic inflammation may play a contributory
role in impaired BRS and heightened SNS responses

in PTSD. Our finding that hsCRP levels correlate with
heightened MSNA responses during VRCE suggest that
heightened basal levels of inflammation may be linked to
enhanced sympathetic reactivity in PTSD. CRP levels are
correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease
in multiple large epidemiological studies (Ridker et al.
1998; Corrado & Novo, 2007; Greenland et al. 2010;
Kaptoge et al. 2010) and the results of the present study
provide additional support indicating that basal levels
of inflammation are heightened in PTSD and may be
linked to enhanced sympathetic activity and baroreflex
dysfunction.Inaddition,thereisevidencethat,priortothe
development of overt CV disease, chronic inflammation
could lead to BRS dysfunction at vascular nerve endings
or along its tract and within the brainstem (Chapleau et al.
2001; Zubcevic et al. 2011; McBryde et al. 2013). In the
present study, although we observed elevated basal hsCRP
levels in PTSD, we did not observe a significant correlation
between hsCRP and baroreflex sensitivity. However, these
analyses may have been limited by a small sample size and
the relatively small range of hsCRP values.
We recognize several other limitations to these
studies. First, our study population primarily comprised
African-American males with combat-related PTSD.
Whether these findings can be generalized to females,
otherracesandethnicitiesorPTSDrelatedtonon-military
trauma is unclear. Second, we used a CAPS-IV score
� 45 to confirm the diagnosis of PTSD in patients,
and a score of < 45 to exclude the presence of PTSD
in Controls (Weathers & Ruscio, 1999; Weathers et al.
2001). The Control group comprised OEF/OIF/OND
Veterans without PTSD and had a mean CAPS-IV
score of 38, which is below the threshold for PTSD
diagnosis but was within the range for subthreshold
PTSD (CAPS-IV score range 20–39). Indeed, all Control
participants had a CAPS-IV score within the subthreshold
PTSD range. Recent investigations of service members
with subthreshold PTSD have also revealed physiological
alterations(Costanzoetal.2014).Amorerobustdifference
in physiological measures may have been demonstrated if

reduced sympathetic BRS in the PTSD group during
VRCE. The study may have been underpowered to
detect differences in sympathetic BRS during concomitant
VRCE. Fourth, although we observed significantly higher
levels of basal hsCRP levels in PTSD, IL-2 and IL-6 levels
were not elevated in this cohort. Although we did not
observe a difference in basal levels of IL-2 and IL-6, this
does not exclude the possibility that these cytokines may
be enhanced in PTSD during periods of acute stress or
exposure to fear stimuli, and should be tested in future
studies. Lastly, it is unclear from this study whether
augmented sympathetic responses to mental stress and
decreased BRS, are a result of having PTSD, or are pre-
sent prior to the development of PTSD and associated
with a higher propensity for developing PTSD. Because
SNS responses to mental stress are variable in the general
population, those with higher SNS responses to stress and
blunted BRS may be at greater risk of developing PTSD in
the setting of high allostatic load. Studies assessing physio-
logical responses to mental stress before and after the
development of PTSD, or long-term prospective studies
evaluating the incidence of PTSD amongst those with
high vs. low SNS reactivity to mental stress, represent
potential strategies for determining whether increased
SNS reactivity is associated with an increased risk of
developing PTSD.
In conclusion, PTSD is a highly prevalent and
debilitating illness that is associated with an increased risk
of CV disease and hypertension. Augmented sympathetic
and haemodynamic responses to mental stress not only
associated with PTSD symptoms, but also generalized
to other types of mental stress, may lead to an overall
increased burden of sympathetic activity that leads to a
greater risk of developing hypertension and CV disease.
Blunted sympathetic and cardiovagal BRS may contribute
to increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic
activation in PTSD, and chronic inflammation may
play a causative role in decreasing BRS and increasing
central sympathetic output. Identifying physiological
mechanisms that contribute to an increased CV risk in
PTSD patients will allow for the development of inter-
ventions aiming to modify CV risk in these patients.
Future studies testing therapies to improve SNS reactivity,
BRS and inflammation should be conducted to evaluate
potential long-term benefits on CV risk in PTSD patients.
