T
he health burden caused by seasonal influ-
enza in the general population is substan-
tial and explains much of the excess winter 
mortality.1–3 Influenza infection may accelerate 
acute thrombotic vascular events, particularly in 
patients with ischemic heart disease and cerebro-
vascular disease.4 For decades, vaccination has 
been the principal strategy to control influenza 
and its severe complications in older adults and 
patients with chronic illnesses, who account for 
most  
influenza-attributable deaths.1 Current influ-
enza vaccination programs were implemented 
based on studies that involved healthy adults in 
the 1960s, which suggested 70%–90% vaccine 
efficacy.5 In European countries, vaccination is 
generally restricted to older adults and adults with 
chronic conditions, and their close contacts to 
reduce transmission.6 In North America, annual 
influenza vaccination is universally recommended 
for all people aged 6 months and older.7,8
There is uncertainty about the degree of influ-
enza vaccine protection in groups at increased risk 
and older adults despite being target populations 
within many national immunization schedules.9 
This controversy has been fed by a number of 
concerns. First, more recent and methodologically 
sound studies have reported considerably lower 
vaccine efficacy in healthy people than was 
reported in earlier studies.9 Second, although evi-
dence from placebo-controlled randomized clini-
cal trials shows the effectiveness of influenza vac-
cine against infection in young people and healthy 
older adults, there is no compelling clinical trial 
evidence to suggest similar benefits in older adults 
with chronic illness.10
For people with diabetes, an especially high-
risk group for influenza-related complications, 
concerns have been raised about impaired 
immune response to influenza vaccine.11 Given 
that national guidelines now strongly recom-

Background: The health burden caused by 
seasonal influenza is substantial. We sought 
to examine the effectiveness of influenza vac-
cination against admission to hospital for 
acute cardiovascular and respiratory condi-
tions and all-cause death in people with type 
2 diabetes.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective 
cohort study using primary and secondary care 
data from the Clinical Practice Research Data-
link in England, over a 7-year period between 
2003/04 and 2009/10. We enrolled 124 503 
adults with type 2 diabetes. Outcome mea-
sures included admission to hospital for acute 
myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure 
or pneumonia/influenza, and death. We fitted 
Poisson regression models for influenza and 
off-season periods to estimate incidence rate 
ratios (IRR) for cohorts who had and had not 
received the vaccine. We used estimates for 
the summer, when influenza activity is low, to 
adjust for residual confounding.
Results: Study participants contributed to 
623 591 person-years of observation during 
the 7-year study period. Vaccine recipients 
were older and had more comorbid conditions 
compared with nonrecipients. After we 
adjusted for covariates and residual confound-
ing, vaccination was associated with signifi-
cantly lower admission rates for stroke (IRR 
0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–0.91), 
heart failure (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.92) and 
pneumonia or influenza (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 
0.74–0.99), as well as all-cause death (IRR 0.76, 
95% CI 0.65–0.83), and a nonsignificant 
change for acute MI (IRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62–
1.04) during the influenza seasons.
Interpretation: In this cohort of patients with 
type 2 diabetes, influenza vaccination was asso-
ciated with reductions in rates of admission to 
hospital for specific cardiovascular events. 
Efforts should be focused on improvements in 
vaccine uptake in this important target group 
as part of comprehensive secondary prevention.

mend influenza vaccination for older adults and 
patients with chronic illness in many countries, 
placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 
patients with high cardiovascular risk may not 
receive ethical approval.9 A few small clinical 
trials have tested whether receipt of the influenza 
vaccine might reduce cardiovascular risk in 
patients with pre-existing cardiovascular dis-
ease.12 However, none of these were adequately 
powered to assess effects on mortality and spe-
cific cardiovascular outcomes.12 Furthermore, 
methodological studies highlight potential flaws 
in observational studies, including inadequate 
adjustment for systematic differences between 
vaccine recipients and nonrecipients (referred to 
as “residual confounding”).9,13
Studies assessing influenza vaccine effec- 
tiveness in people with diabetes are scarce and have 
shown inconclusive results.11 None of the previous 
studies adjusted for residual confounding, and most 
of them reported composite end-points such as 
admission to hospital for any cause. Furthermore, 
we are not aware of any studies assessing the 
potential benefits of influenza vaccination against 
individual cardiovascular events in people with 
type 2 diabetes.11,14
The primary aim of our study was to assess 
the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine 
against hospital admissions for acute myocardial 
infarction (MI), stroke and heart failure in 
patients with type 2 diabetes, while assessing 
and making further adjustments for residual 
confounding using estimates obtained for the 
summer, when influenza activity is minimal. We 
also assessed the association between influenza 
vaccine and hospital admission for pneumonia 
or influenza and all-cause death.
Methods
Study population
We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in 
England for this study. This database is one of the 
world’s largest computerized medical databases 
holding prospective primary care records.15,16 Ano-
nymized primary care data for English practices in 
the database are now available with a linkage to 
non–primary care records, including Hospital Epi-
sode Statistics data and Office for National Statis-
tics mortality files.16 The number of practices par-
ticipating in the data linkage is 300, representing 
65% of participating practices and 5% of Eng-
land’s general population.16 
We obtained an extract of the records of adults 
with type 2 diabetes registered with the 300 fam-
ily practices participating in the data linkage 
between 2003/04 and 2009/10. Patients with type 
2 diabetes were identified using both diagnostic 
(C10) and management (66A) read codes for type 
2 diabetes.17 Participants for the first cohort year 
from Sept. 1, 2003, to Aug. 31, 2004, included 
patients with diabetes who were at least 18 years 
of age on Sept. 1, 2003, and had been continu-
ously registered with participating practices dur-
ing the preceding 12 months and throughout the 
cohort year. For each following study year, 
patients who newly met the eligibility criteria on 
September 1 were enrolled. Ethics approval for 
the study protocol was obtained from the Inde-
pendent Scientific Advisory Committee of the 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
Study periods
Each cohort year was categorized into 4 periods: 
preinfluenza, influenza season, postinfluenza and 
summer. Dates of the onset and end of influenza 
season were obtained for each year from national 
surveillance data on weekly general practitioner 
consultation rates for influenza-like illness.18 
According to this surveillance system, influenza 
season starts when these weekly consultation 
rates exceed the threshold of 30 per 100 000 
population and ends when activity goes below 
this threshold.19 We further defined influenza 
season as the period from the date of onset to 4 
weeks after the end of influenza season to cap-
ture delayed complications.
We defined preinfluenza season as the time 
period from September 1 to the date of onset of 
the influenza season. We defined postinfluenza 
season as the period after the influenza season 
to Apr. 30. We defined the summer period as 
May 1 to Aug. 31 for each cohort year. Prein-
fluenza, influenza, postinfluenza and summer 
periods were combined across all study years 
between 2003/04 and 2009/10.
Outcome measures
Our outcomes included hospital admissions for 
acute MI, stroke, pneumonia or influenza and 
heart failure, as well as all-cause death. Hospital 
admissions were identified from Hospital Epi-
sode statistics as the principal diagnosis on 
admission using International Statistical Classi-
fication of Diseases and Related Health Prob-
lems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), codes as follows: 
acute MI, I21–I22; stroke, I60–I64; influenza or 
pneumonia, J09–J18; and heart failure, I50. 
During each cohort year, patients were followed 
from September 1 until either the occurrence of 
study outcomes or the end of cohort year (Aug. 
31).
Baseline data obtained for each cohort year 
included age, sex, smoking status (classified as 
current smoker, former smoker, nonsmoker or 
missing), body mass index (BMI), laboratory

tests (cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin 
[HbA1c]), systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
and number of hospital admissions during the 
preceding 12 months. We defined baseline 
comorbid conditions using diagnostic read 
codes and included history of MI, stroke, heart 
failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer and 
atrial fibrillation. We identified medications 
prescribed from prescription records: insulin, 
oral antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive 
agents, lipid-lowering agents, anticoagulants 
and antiplatelet drugs, and immunosuppres-
sants. We assigned a deprivation score to indi-
vidual patients using the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation 2004 based on the postal code of 
the practice to which they were registered.20 All 
covariates were redefined at the beginning of 
each cohort year.
Vaccination status
Influenza vaccination status was determined 
from primary care records for each year. In 
2009/10, there was an outbreak of a pandemic 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.18 Owing to 
some unspecific codes that do not allow discrim-
ination between seasonal and pandemic influ-
enza vaccination, we included all influenza vac-
cination codes for 2009 and 2010. All study 
participants were classified as not having 
received the vaccine from September 1 until they 
received vaccine for the subject year. Patients 
were classified as having been effectively vacci-
nated 14 days after the date of vaccination to 
allow for the attainment of protective antibody 
titres.21 We also obtained information on history 
of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination and 
influenza vaccination during the previous year.
Statistical analysis
We compared baseline characteristics of vacci-
nated and unvaccinated study participants using 
the χ2 test for categorical variables, Student t test 
for normally distributed variables and Mann–
Whitney test for skewed continuous variables.
To estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 
95% confidence intervals (CI) for vaccinated 
versus unvaccinated cohorts, we fitted random 
effects Poisson regression models for each out-
come. We performed 3 sets of models for each 
study outcome and each study period separately: 
unadjusted (vaccination status as the only predic-
tor), models adjusted for study covariates and 
models for the influenza period additionally 
adjusted for residual confounding.
Covariates in the adjusted models included 
age, sex, index of multiple deprivation quintile, 
duration of diabetes, number of comorbid condi-
tions, smoking status, medications (lipid-lowering 
drugs, anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, antihy-
pertensive drugs, insulin, oral antihyperglycemic 
drugs and immunosuppressive drugs), systolic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, 
serum HbA1c, serum cholesterol, number of hospi-
tal admissions, influenza vaccination during the 
previous year, history of pneumococcal vaccina-
tion and cohort year.
We considered vaccine status a time-varying 
exposure, and each patient’s follow-up time 
was classified into vaccinated and unvaccinated 
person–time periods. We included follow-up 
time in the models as an offset term. Study par-
ticipants could contribute to more than one 
cohort year in this study. To account for poten-
tial within-person dependency, we entered 
patients as random effects into the models.
We performed an additional analysis to obtain 
unadjusted and adjusted IRRs and 95% CIs that 
excluded cohort year 2008/09, when an outbreak 
of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic strain 
occurred, to test whether the exclusion of this 
year affected our results.
Adjustment for residual confounding
Given that influenza activity is minimal during 
the summer, vaccination should not provide ben-
efits during the off-season.22,23 Therefore, patients 
who have and who have not received vaccine 
should have similar risks of outcomes during the 
summer period after adjustment for measured 
confounders, with an expected IRR of 1.0 for the 
summer period. We used effect estimates for the 
summer period to adjust for residual confounding 
that occurred during the influenza period using 
the following formula:23,24
IRRadjusted = exp(βinfluenza season – βsummer period)
where β is the regression coefficient obtained 
from Poisson regression models. To calculate 
95% CIs for the effect estimates, we resampled 
500 times from the distribution of the observed 
estimates for the influenza and summer periods. 
After having taken the difference of each of the 
500 sampled estimates, the 2.5th and 97.5th 
percentile of the distribution were taken to 
obtain 95% CIs for the adjusted IRRs.23,24
In all analyses, a 2-sided p ≤ 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. We performed 
statistical analyses using Stata version 11.0.
Results
This study included 124 503 patients with type 
2 diabetes who contributed to 623 591 person-
years of observation during the 7-year study

period. During this period, the predominant circu-
lating influenza strains were A(H3N2) in 2003/04, 
2004/05, 2006/07 and 2008/09, B in 2005/06 and 
A(H1N1) in 2007/08 and 2009/10 (Table 1).18 
The antigenic match between the circulating and 
vaccine strains was good for all study years, 
except for 2003/04 owing to antigenic drift and 
2009/10 owing to the occurrence of a new variant 
as a result of antigenic shift.18 Overall seasonal 
influenza vaccination uptake in the cohort ranged 
from 63.1% in 2008/09 to 69.0% in 2006/07. 
Across all study years, there were 5142 hospital 
admissions for acute MI, 4515 admissions for 
stroke, 14 154 admissions for pneumonia or influ-
enza, 12 915 admissions for heart failure and 
21 070 deaths.
Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of 
vaccine recipients and nonrecipients for the 
2003/04 and 2009/10 cohorts. Vaccine recipients 
were older and generally more ill, had more coex-
isting conditions and a larger number of medica-
tions prescribed, but had lower levels of HbA1c 
and cholesterol compared with nonrecipients.
In unadjusted analyses, there was an inconsis-
tent association between vaccination and out-
comes during the influenza season. Compared 
with nonrecipients, vaccine recipients had signif-
icantly higher rates of hospital admission for 
acute MI and heart failure and lower rates of 
death; rates did not significantly differ for stroke 
or pneumonia (Table 3). Vaccination was associ-
ated with higher event rates during the summer 
for all outcomes.
Adjusting the models for study covariates 
attenuated IRRs for all study outcomes compared 
with unadjusted IRRs. Influenza vaccination was 
associated with significant reductions in all out-
comes during the influenza season (Table 3). 
Vaccine recipients had 22% lower rates of acute 
MI (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.93, p < 0.01), 17% 
reduction in rates of heart failure (IRR 0.83, 95% 
CI 0.74–0.93, p < 0.001) and 25% lower rates for

these models, suggesting insufficient adjustment 
for underlying differences between these groups.
After adjustment for residual confounding, 
vaccination was associated with a 19% reduction 
in the rate of hospital admissions for acute MI 
(IRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62–1.04), 30% for stroke 
(IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.91), 22% for heart fail-
ure (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.92) and 15% for 
pneumonia or influenza (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–
0.99) during influenza season among people with 
diabetes who received the vaccine compared with 
those who did not (Figure 1). In addition, patients 
who received the vaccine had 24% lower death 
rates compared with nonrecipients (IRR 0.76, 
95% CI 0.65–0.83).

analysis when the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09

unadjusted and adjusted IRRs obtained for the 
flu and summer periods (Table 4).
Interpretation
In this large population-based study, influenza 
vaccination in people with type 2 diabetes was 
associated with reductions in rates of hospital 
admission for acute cardiovascular and respira-
tory diseases, and in all-cause mortality across 7 
influenza seasons. Additional adjustment for 
residual confounding did not qualitatively alter 
the results of the conventional analyses but atten-
uated the associations for acute MI, pneumonia 
or influenza and death, and strengthened the asso-
ciations for stroke and heart failure. Influenza

vaccination was associated with lower rates of 
admission to hospital for acute MI, but this asso-
ciation was not statistically significant.
Current policy in many countries strongly 
emphasizes annual vaccination for older adults 
and patients with chronic conditions, such as dia-
betes. However, there is no conclusive clinical 
trial evidence to support the benefits of influenza 
vaccination in these groups.25 Epidemiologic 
studies quantifying influenza vaccine protection 
against severe outcomes for patients with diabe-
tes are scarce and largely inconclusive.11 A 
recent meta-analysis found that, in patients with 
diabetes aged 18–64 years, influenza vaccine 
prevented 58% of all-cause admissions to hospi-
tal and 43% of admissions for influenza or pneu-
monia, but not death.11 In patients aged more 
than 65 years, the meta-analysis reported a 
pooled vaccine effectiveness of 38% for all-
cause death and 23% for all-cause admission to 
hospital. However, conclusions were limited by 
the small number of studies identified, lack of 
experimental studies, low quality of evidence 
and strong residual confounding in most studies. 
The authors did not identify any studies assess-
ing influenza vaccine effectiveness against car-
diovascular events.
To better account for the systematic differ-
ences between vaccine recipients and nonrecipi-
ents, we made additional adjustments for residual 
confounding using the summer period when min-
imal vaccine benefit is expected.13,23,24 Some 
authors have suggested using the preinfluenza 
season as a control period. Many previous studies 
assessing influenza vaccine effectiveness in older 
adults described reduced mortality associated 
with vaccination during the entire year. Often, the 
association was the largest before influenza was 
circulating. Jackson and colleagues argued that 
frail older adults in the US did not tend to receive 
influenza vaccine and died unvaccinated during 
follow-up.13 They concluded that, owing to this 
“frailty bias,” pre-influenza periods are the most 
suitable for identifying residual confounding 
because the differences in risk between recipients 
and nonrecipients gradually decline with time. 
However, the pattern of vaccine uptake may 
largely differ in countries with different immuni-
zation strategies. In North America, influenza 
vaccine is universally recommended for all 
patients aged 6 months and older, but high-risk 
older adults in the US were found less likely to 
receive the vaccine. In England, although the 
national policy is to offer free influenza vaccine

to all people with chronic conditions, the uptake 
increases with advancing age and the presence of 
comorbid conditions.26
Many previous studies examined influenza 
vaccine effectiveness by analyzing a single or a 
few seasons.27,28 There are large variations across 
years in influenza activity, pathogenicity of cir-
culating strains and degree of vaccine–virus anti-
genic match. In 2003–2004, vaccine–virus anti-
genic match was low. An incompletely matched 
vaccine might provide protection against sero-
logically confirmed influenza, but to a lesser 
extent than well-matched vaccines.21,29 Owing to 
these variations, evaluating vaccine effectiveness 
in individual seasons may yield widely ranging 
results on vaccine benefit. Our study provides 
valuable information on the long-term average 
benefits of influenza vaccine in people with type 
2  
diabetes.
In 2009, traditional influenza activity was 
low, but there was an outbreak of a pandemic 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.18 Similarly to 
previous pandemics, this strain caused mild ill-
ness in most patients, and severe disease and 
death mostly occurred in children and young 
people.30 Excluding 2008/09 from the analyses 
reduced statistical power because of the reduc-
tion in the number of events but did not change 
the associations found between vaccination and 
clinical outcomes.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study include the use of a 
large population-based cohort of patients with type 
2 diabetes, long follow-up time, the availability of 
key laboratory and clinical parameters, and 
knowing the exact dates of vaccination. 
We were unable to evaluate misclassification 
of outcomes or covariates owing to undiagnosed 
cases of outcomes or comorbidity and unrecorded 
medical information. However, the validity of the 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink has been con-
tinuously monitored and evaluated as high for 
completeness and accuracy, and the database has 
been extensively used for health research.15 Fur-
thermore, the study included cohort years during 
and after the introduction of the Quality and Out-
comes Framework, when determination and 
recording of diabetes, comorbidities and vaccina-
tion status are likely to be more accurate owing to 
the financial incentive provided for general practi-
tioners to record all cases.31 Uptake of influenza 
vaccine identified in this study is broadly consis-
tent with published national data.26 Despite efforts 
to reduce the effect of selection bias between vac-
cine recipients and nonrecipients, adjustments 
undertaken using the summer estimates are 
unlikely to eliminate residual confounding.
Conclusion
Concerns about the benefits of influenza vacci-
nation in older adults and patients with chronic 
illnesses affect the acceptance and uptake of 
influenza vaccination in many countries, includ-
ing those with comprehensive immunization pro-
grams.25 This study has shown that people with 
type 2 diabetes may derive substantial benefits 
from current vaccines, including protection 
against hospital admission for some major car-
diovascular outcomes. These findings underline 
the importance of influenza vaccination as part 
of comprehensive secondary prevention in this 
high-risk population.
