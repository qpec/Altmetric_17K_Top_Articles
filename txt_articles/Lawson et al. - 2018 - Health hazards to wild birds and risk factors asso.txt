Provision of supplementary food for wild birds at garden feeding stations is
a common, large-scale and year-round practice in multiple countries includ-
ing Great Britain (GB). While these additional dietary resources can benefit
wildlife, there is a concomitant risk of disease transmission, particularly
when birds repeatedly congregate in the same place at high densities and
through interactions of species that would not normally associate in close
proximity. Citizen science schemes recording garden birds are popular
and can integrate disease surveillance with population monitoring, offering
a unique opportunity to explore inter-relationships between supplementary
feeding, disease epidemiology and population dynamics. Here, we present
findings from a national surveillance programme in GB and note the dyna-
mism of endemic and emerging diseases over a 25-year period, focusing on
protozoal (finch trichomonosis), viral (Paridae pox) and bacterial (passerine
salmonellosis) diseases with contrasting modes of transmission. We also
examine the occurrence of mycotoxin contamination of food residues in
bird feeders, which present both a direct and indirect (though immuno-
suppression) risk to wild bird health. Our results inform evidence-based
mitigation
strategies
to
minimize
anthropogenically
mediated
health
hazards, while maintaining the benefits of providing supplementary food
for wild birds.

1. Introduction
(a) Garden bird feeding in Great Britain
With habitat loss, degradation and progressive urbanization, there is increased
focus on the value that domestic gardens provide for wild birds. Supplemen-
tary feeding of garden birds is practised by millions of people across Europe,
North America and Australasia [1]. Wild bird feeding is postulated to be one
of the most common forms of human–wildlife interaction in the Western
world [2] and an estimated 48% of households in Great Britain (GB) provide
supplementary food [3]. Since the 1970s, there has been a shift from winter-
only to year-round feeding, supported by the argument that nutritional
demands vary across the year and are not limited to periods of harsh weather.
Concurrently, diversification in commercially available products, notably seed
mixes, suet-based products and insectivorous diets, has occurred. This has
been coupled with an increased variety of food presentation, from table and
ground feeding options to numerous designs and sizes of suspended feeders.

 Supplementary feeding may affect wild birds in many
ways, including changes to body condition, reproductive suc-
cess, survival, community structure and migration behaviour
[4–7]. In GB, supplementary feeding has been linked to
increases in population size of wild bird species making use
of this resource [8]. It is also important to recognize that there
is a human well-being perspective to the feeding of wild
birds. Contact with wildlife in peri-domestic habitats offers
an opportunity to address the growing disconnect with
nature that has accompanied progressive urbanization. Feed-
ing birds has been shown to promote human health and
well-being and may enhance public interest in wildlife welfare
and conservation [9,10], although it risks assuaging guilt over
wider detrimental environmental change and habitat losses
through the act of ‘doing good’ in one’s immediate vicinity.
While supplementary feeding has the potential to offset some
losses resulting from reduced natural food supplies [11], the
benefits largely seem to accrue to already urban-adapted
species that frequently use feeding stations [12].
There are risks associated with feeding birds, which
include the possibility that wild birds may become reliant
on artificial food sources, or be subject to increased predation
at feeding stations (e.g. [13,14]). Supplementary feeding also
may increase opportunities for pathogen exposure and trans-
mission, with risks associated with (i) congregation at high
density for prolonged periods of time and repeatedly over
long periods; (ii) opportunities for interspecific mixing unli-
kely to occur in natural habitats; and (iii) poor hygiene
levels leading to pathogen contamination of the feeding
station [15,16]. Also, supplementary food may pose a risk if
it is of poor nutritional value or contaminated with toxins
that influence host condition or immunity [16,17]. Finally,
crowding and competition at feeding stations may lead to
stress and secondary immunosuppression, with resources
partitioned through dominance hierarchies [16,18]. Further-
more, the zoonotic potential of some wild bird pathogens
is well known, and the close human–wildlife proximity at
feeding stations may increase the risks to public health [19].
(b) Citizen science for wildlife disease surveillance
Citizen science offers a cost-effective means to undertake
large-scale, year-round, longitudinal disease surveillance in
conjunction with the monitoring of wildlife populations,
their distributions and abundances [20]. This approach lends
itself to monitoring species, such as songbirds, that use peri-
domestic habitats and are positively perceived by the public
[21]. In GB, national wild bird disease surveillance has been
achieved over a 25-year period through public reporting of
observed morbidity and mortality. The methods used have
evolved over this period in several ways, most notably invol-
ving a shift from opportunistic reports only (1992–2004) to an
integrated system of independent opportunistic and systema-
tic surveillance approaches (2005–present) [22], which has
been greatly facilitated by expansion of an already existing
national citizen science scheme [23].
Briefly, volunteers in the British Trust for Ornithology’s
(BTO) Garden BirdWatch (GBW) scheme submit weekly
reports throughout the calendar year, providing measures of
occurrence and abundance of wild birds using their gardens.
Expansion of this scheme to include the recording of obser-
vation of disease now provides a structured and systematic
dataset that can be used to control for the spatial and
temporal biases seen in opportunistic reporting approaches.
Post-mortem examinations are conducted from a subset of
incidents, including those reported by both GBW participants
and opportunistic recorders. Standardized examination proto-
cols, supported by ancillary diagnostic tests, are conducted,
and set case and incident definitions are employed (see the
electronic supplementary material). A collaborative approach,
bringing together veterinary diagnostic laboratories, conserva-
tion and animal welfare organizations, government, the wild
bird care industry and academia, underpinned by public con-
tributions, has been adopted to maximize awareness and
impact across invested communities.
(c) Scope of review
Appraisal of disease transmission risk associated with sup-
plementary feeding relies on a combination of observation
and experimental data. There are a few large-scale and long-
term field datasets for disease surveillance of wild birds that
frequent garden feeding stations. For small passerines in
North America, the investigation of the spread of house finch
conjunctivitis is perhaps the best-studied example. This has
combined examination of field data, to provide informa-
tion about spatio-temporal disease spread and house finch
(Haemorhous
mexicanus)
population
declines
[24],
with
experimental studies to elucidate factors (e.g. behaviour) influ-
encingMycoplasmagallisepticumtransmission(e.g.[25,26]).This
bacterial infection results in externally visible, characteristic
signs of conjunctivitis; therefore, syndromic surveillance
through public reporting of affected bird sightings can be
used as a reliable proxy for disease occurrence. However, for
most types of disease, clinical signs are rarely this identifiable
or specific, so alternative approaches are required.
By combining large-scale surveillance with post-mortem
examinations, we can differentiate between multiple diseases
that result in non-specific clinical signs (e.g. lethargy and
fluffed-up plumage) that could not be diagnosed through
observation alone. We focus on three of the best-characterized
and most frequently diagnosed infectious diseases, with con-
trasting modes of transmission, caused by a protozoal, a viral
and a bacterial pathogen, each of which has been known to
occur over the duration of the study period (1992–2016)
but for which the epidemiology, prevalence and impact
have changed markedly over the past decade.
2. Finch trichomonosis
Trichomonas gallinae is a protozoan parasite that causes avian tri-
chomonosis, a disease long known to affect columbiforms
(pigeons and doves) and birds of prey [27]. The disease is gener-
ally characterized by necrotic upper alimentary tract lesions,
which often interfere with the ability to swallow. Parasite trans-
mission occurs via fresh saliva during conspecific feeding in
courtship or when rearing young, or at shared food and water
sources. Birds of prey are exposed to the parasite when they
predate or scavenge infected avian hosts. The parasite has
short-termenvironmentalpersistenceandiskilledbydesiccation.
(a) Pattern of occurrence of finch trichomonosis
Avian trichomonosis has long been documented sporadically
in columbiforms and birds of prey in GB, its widespread dis-
tribution being consistent with an endemic disease [28].

 Trichomonosis emerged in finch species in GB in spring 2005,
with a presentation of necrotic ingluvitis [29]. Since its detec-
tion, the disease has been most frequently diagnosed in
greenfinch Chloris chloris and chaffinch Fringilla coelebs; how-
ever, we have also diagnosed fatal trichomonosis in most of
the gregarious, seed-eating species that visit garden feeding
stations. Epidemic mortality occurs each year with a seasonal
peak in late summer (August–September), although inci-
dents continue year-round. Fatalities due to the disease
have been recorded infrequently in other common garden
birds, probably from spillover at sites where there are high
levels of contamination of shared food and water sources
and of the ground below bird feeders. Since its emergence,
finch trichomonosis has been the most common infectious
disease diagnosed for finch species (family Fringillidae),
accounting for 87% (372/426) of finch infectious disease diag-
noses over the period 2010–2016 inclusive (i.e. since the
previous large-scale study on this disease [30]).
While multiple T. gallinae strains are known to infect
pigeons and doves in GB, a single clonal A1 strain is respon-
sible for the trichomonosis epidemic in European finches
[31,32]. Although it is possible that this is a recently emerged,
highly virulent strain with increased host range, we hypoth-
esize that the epidemic arose from single/multiple spillover
events from columbids to finches in GB and has been main-
tained predominantly by finch to finch transmission [30].
The frequency with which woodpigeon, Columba palumbus,
and collared dove, Streptopelia decaocto, are reported from
gardens has increased markedly since the 1980s, as did green-
finch; indeed, they were among the largest increases at
garden feeding stations reported by Chamberlain et al. [8].
These increases are almost certainly due, in large part,
simply to a larger population size; for example, woodpigeon
numbers have increased in response to a greater area of oil-
seed
rape
cultivation
[33].
It
is
also
possible
that
a
widespread change in the nature of garden feeding since
the 1970s, with a large variety of food types provided
year-round (increasingly presented in multiple feeders),
has not only made gardens more attractive as foraging
locations, but also increased the frequency of conspecific
and interspecific interactions of birds at feeding stations.
Subsequent to its emergence in GB, finch trichomonosis
spread to Fennoscandia in 2008 [34], with epidemiological
and ring recovery data suggesting the chaffinch as the most
likely primary vector [35]. Onward spread of finch tricho-
monosis has continued in mainland Europe, with molecular
studies confirming the same clonal A1 strain of T. gallinae
to be responsible [36].
(b) Population-level impact
In the first year of epidemic mortality (2006), a marked
decrease in the number of gardens reporting greenfinches
and chaffinches was noted, which was contemporaneous
with a late summer peak in reports of the disease [29]. This
resulted in a reduction in the breeding population of green-
finches (by 35%) and of chaffinches (by 20%) in the area
with the highest frequency of disease reports, but no decrease
in dunnock (Prunella modularis) numbers (which represents a
rarely affected ‘control’ species [29]). In the years preceding
the initial outbreak, all three species were widespread,
being reported in approximately 80% of gardens each
spring (figure 1c). In the years following the emergence of
finch trichomonosis, dunnocks continued to be reported in a
similar proportion of gardens to before, while the number of
gardens reported to be visited by chaffinches decreased only
slightly. Greenfinches, though, were seen in fewer than half
(49%) the number of gardens in 2015/2016 relative to before
the disease outbreak. At the same time, a large decrease in
the number of greenfinches recorded at garden feeders was
noted (from a mean of 5.6 average weekly maximum group
size before 2006 to 1.6 in 2015/2016), with a smaller decrease
for chaffinch (6.2 to 4.7) and no change was noted for the dun-
nock (mean ¼ 1.5, figure 1b). These changes are reflected at the
national level, as the size of the greenfinch (but not chaffinch or
dunnock) breeding population has continued to decline mark-
edly (by 66%, figure 1a), from a peak of approximately 4.3
million in 2006 (just before the onset of the epidemic) to
approximately 1.5 million individuals in 2016 (i.e. an average
reduction of approx. 280 000 individuals per annum). This rep-
resents the largest scale infectious disease impact on a
European wild bird on record and has led to the inclusion of
the British race of Greenfinch, C. chloris harrisoni on the red
list of Birds of Conservation Concern [38]. Furthermore,
recent assessment of extinction risk using the International
Union for Conservation of Nature Red list guidelines classified
the breeding greenfinch population in GB as endangered [39].
It is unclear whether the more recent decline in chaffinch num-
bers since 2012 (figure 1a) is a result of finch trichomonosis or
other causes.
3. Paridae pox
Multiple strains of avian poxvirus are known to infect wild
birds in GB, with house sparrow (Passer domesticus), starling
(Sturnus vulgaris), woodpigeon and dunnock most com-
monly affected in garden habitats [28,40]. Avian pox most
commonly presents as proliferative, and readily observable,
skin lesions [41]. Sporadic reports of disease, mostly of mild
to moderate severity, have been confirmed in GB for decades
and usually affect individual or small numbers of birds only.
Avian poxvirus is resistant in the environment and can per-
sist in a viable state for long periods, estimated to be from
weeks to months. Virus transmission occurs via a combi-
nation of routes, including direct and indirect contact,
perhaps facilitated by skin breach and invertebrate vectors
such as biting mosquitoes [41].
(a) Pattern of occurrence of Paridae pox
In 2006, a novel and severe form of avian pox affecting Pari-
dae species, most frequently the great tit (Parus major), was
diagnosed in southeast England with multiple birds affected
in the majority of reported incidents [42]. Reports were
received throughout the year, but with a pronounced seaso-
nal peak in the post-breeding period (August/September),
when population densities are at their highest following
recruitment of naive juveniles, but also coincident with a sea-
sonal peak in the abundance of mosquito vectors. Following
the initial cases, there was a marked expansion in the disease
range, consistent with epidemic spread from a point source
introduction [42].
Sequence analysis of the avian poxvirus strains affecting
British garden bird species revealed that a single B1 clade
virus was responsible for Paridae pox emergence, which
was distinct from all other strains except that affecting
rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 373: 20170091
3
 dunnock, although these might be distinguished as separate
strains at higher sequencing resolution [42]. This severe form
of pox has been known at an apparently low prevalence in
Scandinavia since the 1950s, with incidents seen elsewhere in
mainland Europe since 2005 [43]. Analyses of the avipoxvirus
4b core protein gene showed identical DNA sequences to great
tits
in
mainland
Europe
and
GB
[42,43].
The
spatio-
temporal pattern of spread and the same virus strain emerging
in great tits in GB and mainland Europe support a hypothesis
of disease emergence subsequent to virus incursion, rather
than emergence in GB as a result of a spillover event,
e.g. from dunnock. As great tits in GB are relatively sedentary,
the introduction is likely to have occurred as a result of invert-
ebrate vector movement, perhaps via wind-borne spread or
accidental transport [42]. Great tits seem to be particularly sus-
ceptible to the disease because other tit species (such as the
blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus) exposed to the same environment
are affected much less frequently [44].
Paridae pox incident reports, which have continued to be
received (to 2016), demonstrate that the disease has persisted
in southeast England and has an expanding range northward
and westward across England and Wales; only a few reports
have been received from Scotland since the first report from
there in 2015 (figure 2).
(b) Population impact
Although reports of Paridae pox have been received over a
similar time period to those of finch trichomonosis, the
extent of any regional- and national-scale population impacts
are unclear, but appear to have been small. This difference
may be, in part, because Paridae pox appears to have a com-
paratively lower mortality rate than finch trichomonosis and
possibly also a lower rate of transmission. While finch tricho-
monosis rapidly spread across the whole country, and
beyond [30], Paridae pox remained confined to the southeast
of England for several years (2006–2009) following its initial
emergence before reports started to be received from further
afield [42]. In the 10 years prior to 2005, populations of great
tits were increasing, but they have recently decreased signifi-
cantly in southern England, but not in northern England, or
Scotland where Paridae pox is still scarce (figure 2). While
blue tit populations have also decreased since 2005, there
was no difference between regions, in contrast to great tits
(electronic supplementary material, table S1). These contrast-
ing population trends are consistent with a disease-mediated
decline of great tits in England, although the pattern of
regional change in great tit population size does not match
well with the expectation that population declines would be
greatest in the southeast, where the disease has been present
for the longest period. Thus, unlike with the greenfinch
where finch trichomonosis is believed to be the major
driver of population decline, factors other than infectious dis-
ease, such as winter weather, breeding season productivity or
the frequency of tree masting, might be contributing to the
changing population status of the great tit.
Capture–mark–recapture investigations of a population
of great tits found a significant adverse effect of Paridae
pox on fledging success and on host survival, especially in
juveniles
[45].

 model accounting for these effects determined that while Par-
idae pox could cause a population-level decline, this was not
predicted at the observed field prevalence of 5%, but would
only occur if the disease prevalence exceeded 8%. There is
thus a need for regional sampling to determine the levels of
prevalence in great tit populations to inform predictions for
future effects of this disease on great tit populations.
4. Passerine salmonellosis
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (definitive phage
types (DT)160, 40 and 56 variant) causes salmonellosis in pas-
serine birds and has been reported from various countries
since at least the 1950s [46–50]. The disease is characterized
by disseminated granulomatous lesions, most commonly
affecting the oesophagus, liver, spleen and caecal tonsils.
Transmission is faeco-oral and Salmonella bacteria are capable
of persisting for many months within the environment. Inci-
dents of passerine salmonellosis are typically reported in the
vicinity of supplementary feeding stations [46–50]. Greg-
arious and granivorous species in the Fringillidae and
Passeridae are most commonly affected by the disease,
particularly the greenfinch and house sparrow in GB [48].
Passerine salmonellosis incidents have pronounced winter
seasonality in GB, typically peaking in January. The wild
bird species that are affected by disease are proposed as
the
reservoir of
these
Salmonella
biotypes,
which
are
considered to be host-adapted [51].

 (a) Pattern of occurrence of passerine salmonellosis
While the disease is considered to be endemic, with wide-
spread occurrence, in GB, longitudinal studies have shown
variation in the spatial distribution of the main phage types
in England and Wales with succession of the predominant
phage type over time, with shifts from DT160 to DT40 and
then DT56(v) [52] (electronic supplementary material, figure
S1b). In contrast to the patterns of occurrence of finch tricho-
monosis and Paridae pox, the number of confirmed passerine
salmonellosis incidents has declined markedly over the past
decade [52] (electronic supplementary material, figure S1a).
The reason for the sharp decline in this endemic disease
remains unknown, but we propose two potential hypotheses:
first, that the decline in DT56(v) incidents reflects the devel-
opment
of
herd
immunity
to
this
biotype
and
the
populations are now vulnerable to emergence of a new
variant; or, second, that passerine salmonellosis has den-
sity-dependent transmission, and the dramatic reduction in
greenfinch numbers in garden habitats, due to finch tricho-
monosis, has had a secondary impact on occurrence of this
bacterial disease. Serosurveys of wild bird populations may
help elucidate these hypotheses.
(b) Population impact
There have been anecdotal reports of temporary, localized
reductions in bird numbers following passerine salmonellosis
outbreaks [53]. There is, however, no evidence to indicate that
passerine mortality caused by salmonellosis occurs at a scale
sufficient to cause widespread wild bird population declines
in GB.
5. Mycotoxin exposure
Exposure to aflatoxins (AFs) and ochratoxin A (OA) can exert
a range of adverse effects in birds, ranging from acute toxico-
sis to chronic subclinical impairment of growth, reproduction
and immune function [54]. Aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) and
OA are secondary metabolites produced by filamentous
fungi of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, respectively,
and have been shown to be produced in peanuts and other
foodstuffs used in supplementary foods sold for garden
bird consumption [55]. Optimal conditions for AF production
occur at high temperature and relative humidity, although
Thompson and Henke [56] demonstrated AF production
under temperate climatic conditions; OA production also
occurs in conditions found in GB [57]. Furthermore, hepatic
AF residues have been detected in house sparrows and green-
finches found dead in gardens in GB, confirming exposure of
wild birds in peri-domestic habitats in this country [58].
(a) Pattern of occurrence of mycotoxin exposure
To determine whether garden feeding stations could act as a
source of AF or OA in GB, a pilot study was conducted to
screen for these mycotoxins in food residues collected from
hanging feeders in use at feeding stations [59]. Food residues
collected from hanging feeders were submitted from seven
gardens in southeast England in 2005 (see the electronic
supplementary material). Detectable AF residues were found
in all seven samples, two of which greatly exceeded the
20 mg kg21 maximum permitted limit for AFB1 (for peanuts
in livestock feed, including wild bird food) [60] at values of
690 and 61 710 mg kg21 (electronic supplementary material,
table S2). Detectable OA residues were found in two samples
(1.0 and 2.6 mg kg21), neither of which approached the
100 mg kg21 EU guidance limit for OA in poultry foodstuffs
[61]. Thus, garden birds may be exposed to AF residues in
supplementary food at levels associated with acute and
chronic toxic effects in captive birds. Experimental studies
have found variation between species in apparent ability
to
discriminate
against
AF-contaminated
food
sources,
suggesting that avoidance may not be possible [62].
(b) Population impact
Research on poultry species has shown marked interspecific
variation in the effects of mycotoxins (e.g. [63,64]), but no
information is currently available on the susceptibility of
wild bird species. While AF residues were detected in the
liver of common British garden birds, no evidence of macro-
scopic hepatic abnormalities was detected on post-mortem
examination of these birds; microscopic appraisal of tissues
was not possible [58]. The impacts of AF and OA exposure
at both the individual and population level for wild birds
are, therefore, currently unknown.
6. Identification of risk factors and future
research needs
Provision of supplementary food, both intentional and unin-
tentional, has occurred throughout human history and has
shaped communities, food webs and ecosystems [65]. More
specifically, provision of food at garden bird feeding stations
has the potential to influence bird populations over a larger
area, both directly through the energy and nutrients pro-
vided,
but
also
through
the
alteration
of
pathogen
dynamics, including the transmission of disease to a wider
population [2]. It has been shown that the birds using
garden feeding stations may be attracted from a much
wider area, arriving to take advantage of supplementary
food, especially when natural foods may be in short supply
[8,23,66]. The finch trichomonosis work reviewed here high-
lights the potential importance of garden feeding stations in
facilitating disease transmission that can adversely impact
populations, as well as wild bird welfare. However, there is
much that is still unknown about the risk factors associated
with supplementary feeding.
There is a need to characterize basic epidemiological par-
ameters (such as incubation periods, transmission rates and
infection probability) and variation in species’ susceptibility,
although this would require experimental challenge studies
for specific pathogens. Such information would enable para-
meterization
of models to
assess the relative
benefits
provided by increased food availability and the costs of dis-
ease transmission, but also to predict the effect of mitigation
measures and their concomitant population-scale impacts.
While peri-domestic habitats can support a substantial pro-
portion of the overall population of some bird species [67],
the extent of interchange of individuals between these and
rural habitats is poorly known, and hence so is the extent
to which diseases transmitted at feeders can infiltrate the
wider population. Furthermore, reports of disease incidents
observed in the vicinity of feeding stations may provide

 individuals frequently remain around feeding stations for
long periods (e.g. [68]) and, therefore, are visible through
to the end stage of disease [29]. Surveillance of species in
rural locations away from established feeding stations is
likely to be required to gain a more complete picture of
the infection landscape. This approach was adopted in a
study of multiple bird species at forested sites in central Illi-
nois, USA, which contrasted individual bird health at sites
with and without supplementary food provision [69]. Live
bird capture in mist nets and sampling were employed
with assessment of multiple parameters, appraising stress
(i.e. heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), body condition (i.e.
body fat score and body condition index), antioxidant
capacity, total protein, haematocrit, feather quality, repro-
ductive physiology (i.e. testosterone or oestradiol plasma
concentration),
immune
function
(i.e.
microbial
killing
assays) and observation of clinical signs of disease (e.g. con-
junctivitis, avian pox, fungal skin disease, cloacal infection).
Both positive and negative impacts of wild bird feeding
were detected. Results indicate that, in general, birds at
sites with feeding stations were in better physiological con-
dition and of greater overall health status; however, there
was significantly greater observed disease prevalence than
for birds at control sites. Similar studies in additional
countries, with different wild bird species and infectious dis-
eases,
would
be
worthwhile
and
also
could
include
pathogen
screening
and/or
serosurveillance
would
be
worthwhile.
A key unknown is exposure risk, both to pathogens and
to toxins. While the impact of heavy metals and pesticides
is often well studied (e.g. [70]), the role of mycotoxin con-
taminants in food supplies has largely been ignored. The
occurrence of mycotoxin contamination is higher in warm,
wet conditions, which are likely to become more frequent
with climate change [71]. The ability of pathogens to persist
in the environment is poorly known, yet this is a key determi-
nant of exposure risk. For example, experiments have
determined that T. gallinae can survive in moist seed
(,24 h), seed with organic material (less than 48 h) and dis-
tilled water with organic material (less than 16 h), but no
survival was detected in dry seed [72,73]. The method of
food provision (e.g. ground, bird table or in a hanging
feeder) will also influence the likelihood of exposure. For
example, transmission of T. gallinae may be facilitated by
horizontal feeding surfaces, where saliva and regurgitated
food from infected birds can easily contaminate fresh food.
By contrast, hanging feeders may increase direct and indirect
contact rates via perches or mesh and facilitate avian pox-
virus transmission. The presence of tube style feeders was
found to be significantly associated with the risk of house
finch conjunctivitis, a disease transmitted via direct and
indirect contact [74]. Feeding may also lead to increased
opportunities for interspecific mixing at close quarters,
including of species that would not normally associate
together, elevating the risk of pathogen transmission from
one species to another. Observational studies of species
using feeding stations, their community composition, beha-
viours,
contact
rates
and
dominance
hierarchies
may
identify the species and/or individuals at greatest risk of
pathogen exposure.
Provision of supplementary food can influence pathogen
invasion and prevalence, and there is a need to explore inter-
actions between host demography, contact behaviour and
immune defence [75]. Empirical studies to assess the nutri-
tional composition of supplementary food, and how this
resource affects host immunity, would help inform the trade-
off between risks and benefits. Poor-quality or contaminated
food can compromise immune function, further increasing
the risk of disease transmission [16]. Commercially available
foods for garden birds are typically based on convenient,
affordable and available seed resources, some of which are
known to be nutritionally incomplete when they form the
majority diet of captive birds (e.g. excess fat, deficient in vita-
mins A and D3 and calcium [76]). While provision of artificial
food sources in garden habitats is proposed as a supplement to
natural diets (when a balanced nutritional composition may
not be required), there is a need for further investigation to
determine the proportion of the diet that it constitutes [14].
While there have been a limited number of such studies
with tit species which indicate that the proportion of sup-
plementary food in the diet varies by site and individual
(e.g. [77]), how this alters by species is unknown.
Evaluation of the risk of mycotoxin exposure associated
with supplementary feeding could be conducted by compar-
ing toxins in various provisioned food types to levels in
natural wild foods. Measuring mycotoxin levels in provi-
sioned food at the point of sale, after storage and following
exposure to British climatic conditions would provide infor-
mation about the risk of mycotoxin exposure, but this
would also need a better understanding of how wild birds
react to and consume foods with differing levels of myco-
toxin. Identifying the impacts of mycotoxins on wild birds
and how they vary by species would require studies
involving experimental exposure to the toxins of interest.
While there is no known risk to public health from finch
trichomonosis or Paridae pox, people can develop gastroen-
teritis
following
infection
with
garden
bird-associated
strains of S. Typhimurium. Evaluation of the spatio-temporal
trends of the S. Typhimurium phage types seen in garden
birds and matched biotypes in people over a 20-year period
in England and Wales found evidence of a positive associ-
ation in both time and space between the two cohorts [52].
Whole-genome sequence studies of S. Typhimurium phage
types 40 and 56(v) from both garden birds and people in
GB showed that they were genetically closely related [78].
While these combined data support wild birds as a potential
source of zoonotic disease, it is important to note that wild
bird-associated biotypes represented only 0.2% of human Sal-
monella infections over a 10-year period [52]. Risks to
domesticated animal health from wild bird disease should
similarly be considered.
Social science methodologies can be used to understand
the motivations of people who feed garden birds [79] and
the ways to most effectively communicate guidance to
direct and effect improvements in practices for disease pre-
vention and control. Parallel approaches being used to
understand
community
participation
in
citizen
science
might be useful here [80]. The use of supplementary feeding
to support recovery programmes for species of conservation
concern has generated a strategic and integrated approach,
applying structured decision-making processes to the critical
evaluation of benefits and risks for individual conservation
projects [81]. A similar approach may be tenable on a larger
scale to facilitate the development of best-practice guidance
for feeding garden birds integrating available information
from various disciplines.

 7. Evidence-based mitigation strategies to
address anthropogenically mediated
pathogen transmission
While there remain many unanswered questions, there is a
need to offer strategic recommendations for disease preven-
tion and control [82,83]. This should be based on our
current understanding and apply the precautionary principle
that accepts that supplementary feeding is likely to contribute
to the transmission of certain infectious diseases [16].
(a) Disease prevention
Guidance for disease prevention can be tailored to address
potential risk factors; for example, offering a variety of sup-
plementary foods from accredited sources and feeding in
moderation or only providing an amount of food at a time
that will be consumed within a short period (1–2 days).
Perhaps most challenging in this regard is the identification
of ways to provide supplementary food while minimizing
opportunities for interspecific contact that might not regu-
larly occur in the wild. Currently, there is a move towards
providing a variety of food types in close proximity, which
is likely to increase opportunities for species mixing: for
example, on single pole multipurpose feeding platforms
that accommodate suspended feeders for seed and nuts,
together with platform feeders and water bowls. Measures
to reduce contamination at feeding stations, including regular
cleaning and disinfection of bird feeders and tables, removal
of food waste and faeces, and frequent replenishment and
rotation of the locations of feeding stations are recommended.
Feeder designs could be improved to reduce the chances of
deterioration in food quality (e.g. prevent food becoming
moist), avoid contamination of uneaten food and promote
ease of cleaning. Food should also be stored appropriately
and kept dry, with no rodent access.
As wildlife diseases are often highly seasonal, avoiding
feeding during sensitive periods has been suggested as a
measure to mitigate spread of diseases associated with popu-
lation-level
declines,
such
as
during
the
house
finch
conjunctivitis peak in the autumn months [16]. However, a
study using large-scale surveys found that house finch
declines following disease emergence were greatest where
the density of bird feeding was reduced, which indicates
that while supplementary food provision may contribute to
pathogen transmission, there might have been some compen-
satory positive effect countering the level of disease-related
mortality [84]. Comparison of these findings with additional
studies, focused on alternative infectious diseases with vary-
ing case fatality rates, would be useful to further appraise the
evidence for beneficial effects of feeding versus detrimental
effects of increased transmission opportunities. The potential
benefit of food withdrawal to reduce opportunities for patho-
gen spillover to other wild bird species, which is a particular
concern for the transmission of finch trichomonosis to other
passerine species, requires similar evaluation.
It is worth noting that compliance with any request to
cease feeding for disease prevention is likely to be ignored
by a significant proportion of those people who feed wild
birds. Motivations to feed are varied, including pleasure,
environmental and philosophical preconceptions about wild
bird care and responsibility [14]. This suggests that efforts
could more effectively be directed to moderating behaviour
in other ways, perhaps by seeking to reduce or redistribute
the volume or type of food resources made available, or
by pursuing the adoption of optimal hygiene measures.
Educating the general public about the typical signs of ill
health in garden birds, raising awareness of the occurrence
and impact of disease outbreaks and communicating the
benefits of vigilance for early detection and diagnosis may
all assist with public understanding and the acceptance of
evidence-based, best-practice advice. Research into the pub-
lic’s perception of who is responsible for investigation and
action during wildlife disease outbreaks and their opinions
on available mitigation measures would be useful.
(b) Disease control
Control measures applicable to disease outbreaks in garden
birds are limited. While requests from the public to medicate
free-living birds are frequently received, this practice is not
recommended for multiple reasons, including the inability
to safely and effectively provide the correct dose to target
free-living animals and the risk of promoting antimicrobial
resistance. Treatment is only practicable if affected garden
birds are taken into care; however, because small passerines
usually can only be captured by hand at the end stage of dis-
ease, these casualties typically have a poor prognosis [85].
Where multiple birds are affected during a disease outbreak,
temporary suspension of feeding to disperse birds, to reduce
local population density and to reduce the risks of intra- and
interspecific spread, is often advised. This recommendation
may be influenced by the mode of transmission of the disease
and how likely it is that the rate of transmission will be influ-
enced by congregation at feeding stations. Suspension of bird
feeding is also advocated where there is suspicion or confir-
mation of potentially zoonotic disease, such as passerine
salmonellosis, to reduce the risk of public exposure through
continuation of the activity.
8. Conclusion
This review summarizes field data on a national scale that
clearly demonstrates the dynamism of endemic and emer-
ging diseases in wild bird populations, even within a
relatively small geographical area, such as GB, and a short
time frame. The aetiological agents, mechanisms of emer-
gence, modes of transmission and anthropogenic activities
likely to influence transmission vary. In a world where the
focus is typically on emerging conditions (e.g. finch tricho-
monosis and Paridae pox), the marked reduction of an
endemic disease (e.g. passerine salmonellosis) reinforces
that changes in occurrence can be bidirectional and that
there may be interplay between the conditions present. Our
findings highlight the importance of longitudinal scanning
surveillance to capture early signals of changes in disease epi-
demiology, not just the emergence of novel conditions. Such
surveillance informs the real-time prioritization of recom-
mendations for mitigation tailored to current conditions
and their concomitant risks to both wild bird and public
health. There is a need to balance the risks and benefits of
supplementary feeding of garden birds to both wildlife and
people, which can be facilitated by engaging with the general
public and the bird food industry to promote understanding
and to encourage compliance with best-practice guidance.
