SUMMARY
Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing
the ability to present neoantigens through human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss may facilitate immune
evasion. However, the polymorphic nature of the
locus has precluded accurate HLA copy-number
analysis. Here, we present loss of heterozygosity
in human leukocyte antigen (LOHHLA), a computa-
tional tool to determine HLA allele-specific copy
number from sequencing data. Using LOHHLA, we
find that HLA LOH occurs in 40% of non-small-
cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and is associated with
a high subclonal neoantigen burden, APOBEC-
mediated mutagenesis, upregulation of cytolytic
activity, and PD-L1 positivity. The focal nature of
HLA LOH alterations, their subclonal frequencies,
enrichment in metastatic sites, and occurrence as
parallel events suggests that HLA LOH is an im-
mune escape mechanism that is subject to strong
microenvironmental selection pressures later in
tumor evolution. Characterizing HLA LOH
with
LOHHLA refines neoantigen prediction and may
have implications for our understanding of resis-
tance mechanisms and immunotherapeutic ap-
proaches targeting neoantigens.
INTRODUCTION
Immune evasion represents a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). The majority of cancer immunotherapies,
including immune checkpoint blockade therapy, aim to coun-
teract immune evasion by shifting the balance in favor of immune
activation, enabling T cell-mediated cancer cell elimination
(Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015). However, only a subset of
patients benefit from immunotherapies, emphasizing the need
to identify the genomic and molecular determinants underpin-
ning immune evasion.
Recent work has highlighted the importance of cancer-specific
neoantigens in determining cytolytic and T cell activity as well as
predicting efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition (Brown et al.,
2014; Rizvi et al., 2015; Rooney et al., 2015; Snyder et al., 2014;
Van Allen et al., 2015). A critical step in neoantigen presentation
and cytolytic T cell response is governed by class I human leuko-
cyte antigen (HLA), which presents intra-cellular peptides on the
cell surface for recognition by T cell receptors. Each individual’s
genome contains up to six distinct HLA class I alleles, encoded
by three genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C), located on the ho-
mologous paternal and maternal chromosome 6.
Downregulation of HLA genes may result in reduced antigen
presentation and thus facilitate immune evasion. HLA downregu-
lation, characterized by immunohistochemistry or monoclonal an-
tibodies, has been found to be prevalent across a range of cancer
types and has also been linked to poor outcome (Campoli and
Ferrone, 2008; Hicklin et al., 1999; Hiraki et al., 2004; Mehta
et al., 2008). Loss of either the maternal or paternal HLA haplotype
may also impact upon the efficacy of immunotherapy. An
intriguing report documented loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the
HLA locus, with loss of HLA-C*08:02 in the resistant lesion from
a tumor treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes composed
of T cell clones targeting KRAS G12D (Tran et al., 2016). Because
the presence of the HLA-C*08:02 allele was required for presen-
tation of the KRAS G12D neoantigen and tumor recognition by
T cells, its loss was proposed to directly enable immune evasion.
However, the impact of loss of an HLA haplotype on anti-
tumor immunity, clonal expansions, and neoantigen prediction
has not been systematically explored as the polymorphic nature
of the HLA locus prevents alignments of sequencing reads to the
human reference genome and inference of copy number. To this
end, we developed LOHHLA (loss of heterozygosity in human
leukocyte antigen), a computational tool permitting allele-spe-
cific copy number estimation of the HLA locus from next-gener-
ation sequencing data. Building upon previous work imputing

 HLA haplotypes from sequencing data (Shukla et al., 2015; Szo-
lek et al., 2014) and utilizing previously published datasets (Bras-
tianos et al., 2015; Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017), we endeavored to
address the prevalence and timing of HLA LOH in lung cancer
and its potential impact on tumor evolution, neoantigen presen-
tation and metastasis.
RESULTS
Inferences of HLA LOH and Imbalance in Tumor Samples
Using LOHHLA
In order to determine allele-specific copy number, the majority of
copy-number tools rely on the relative coverage and variant
allele frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
the tumor and matched normal across the genome or exome
(Carter et al., 2012; Favero et al., 2015; Ha et al., 2014; Shen
and Seshan, 2016; Van Loo et al., 2010). However, inferring
copy number status at the HLA locus is problematic due to
poor coverage and the polymorphic nature of the region. SNPs
cannot readily be identified at the HLA locus using sequencing
data that has been aligned to the human reference genome,
as reads that are highly polymorphic will not align and will there-
fore be discarded. Indeed, despite being one of the most poly-
morphic regions of the human genome, an average of <1
(mean 0.84, range 0–7) informative heterozygous SNP in the
three HLA class I genes was identified in 96 patients where
copy-number analysis was possible from the TRACERx cohort
(Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017) using the state-of-the-art SNP caller
Platypus (Rimmer et al., 2014). These data suggest that conven-
tional copy-number calling algorithms are not suited to directly
infer haplotype-specific copy number of the HLA locus.
We reasoned that, by leveraging the reads that map specif-
ically to an individual’s germline HLA alleles rather than the hu-
man reference genome, it would be possible to accurately deter-
mine HLA haplotype-specific copy number. To achieve this, we
developed the computational tool LOHHLA (Figure 1A). Imple-
mentation of LOHHLA relies upon five steps. First, tumor and
germline reads that map to the HLA region of the genome and
chromosome 6, including contigs, are extracted. Second, tumor
and germline HLA allele-specific .bam files are generated by
aligning reads to patient-specific HLA alleles (obtained from
HLA serotyping or an inference tool, e.g., Polysolver [Shukla
et al., 2015] or Optitype [Szolek et al., 2014]). Third, polymorphic
sites between homologous HLA alleles are identified. Fourth, tu-
mor coverage relative to germline (logR) and b-allele frequencies
(BAF) are inferred at each HLA locus, making use of identified
HLA haplotype specific alignment

 polymorphic sites. Finally, HLA allele-specific copy number
is determined for each HLA gene, accounting for stromal
contamination.
To the best of our knowledge, no other computational method
currently exists to infer haplotype-specific copy number of the
HLA locus, and as such, there is no gold-standard with which
we can compare LOHLA copy-number estimation or inference
of which HLA haplotype is subject to loss. Therefore, to test
the accuracy of HLA copy-number estimation, we made the
assumption that genomic segments adjacent to the HLA locus
will often exhibit the same copy-number profile as the HLA locus
itself, which holds for cases without a highly focal HLA event (Fig-
ure S1D). We therefore used ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010) to es-
timate the frequency of allelic imbalance and LOH in the genomic
regions surrounding the HLA locus in 288 TRACERx non-small-
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exomes from 96 patients (Jamal-Han-
jani et al., 2017) and compared these to LOHHLA copy-number
estimation. Notably, given that ASCAT is not designed to infer
which HLA haplotype is subject to loss or imbalance, for this
analysis, we could only compare whether ASCAT and LOHHLA
exhibited concordant copy-number profiles not whether concor-
dant haplotypes were predicted to be lost.
We observed a highly significant relationship between the
minor and major allele copy-number estimates obtained from
LOHHLA and ASCAT (p = 1.36e-115, rho = 0.70, Spearman’s
rank test; Figures 1B and S1A), supporting the utility of LOHHLA
to accurately estimate copy number and LOH. We found concor-
dant allelic imbalance estimates in 246/288 tumor regions (Fig-
ures 1C, S1B, and S1C). Thirty-four additional allelic imbalance
events in tumor regions were uncovered using LOHHLA while
only 8 tumor regions exhibited evidence of allelic imbalance us-
ing ASCAT and not LOHHLA. In many cases, the discrepancies
between ASCAT and LOHHLA could be explained by the fact
that ASCAT cannot directly infer haplotype-specific copy num-
ber at the HLA locus, and thus, the copy number of either the
50 or 30 adjacent segment is erroneously assumed to cover the
HLA locus (Figure S1D).
Concordant LOH inference, where either the maternal or
paternal allele was deleted, was observed in 258/288 tumor
regions, with additional LOH defined by LOHHLA identified in
21 tumor regions, while 9 tumor regions were identified as
harboring a lost haplotype by ASCAT and not LOHHLA (Figures
1D and S1C).
To further validate LOHHLA using an approach independent
of exome sequencing, we performed PCR-based fragment anal-
ysis of highly polymorphic stretches of DNA in close proximity to
the HLA locus in 82 tumor regions from 27 tumors (Figure S2).
Tumor regions analyzed were either predicted to have all loci
(HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) subject to LOH, or no loci affected.
Supporting the utility of LOHHLA to accurately classify LOH, we
observed significant differences in normalized allelic ratio be-
tween tumors classified as exhibiting LOH, allelic imbalance
without LOH, or no observable imbalance (p = 1.07e-19 [LOH
versus no imbalance], p = 4.57e-05 [LOH versus allelic
imbalance]; Figure S2). Furthermore, the distinction between
these three categories was clearer using LOHHLA than the
copy-number tools ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010), Sequenza
(Favero et al., 2015), or TITAN (Ha et al., 2014) (Figure S2).
Taken together, these data suggest that LOHHLA is able to
accurately infer both allelic imbalance and LOH in tumor sam-
ples. While it may be possible to infer whether the HLA locus is
subject to allelic imbalance and/or LOH in the majority of cases
using copy-number tools such as ASCAT (Van Loo et al.,
2010), LOHHLA provides additional sensitivity and specificity
to detect these aberrations, even if they are highly focal.
Crucially, LOHHLA also infers specifically which HLA allele ho-
molog is subject to loss at each of the three HLA genes, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is currently not possible with other
tools.
Prevalence and Timing of HLA Imbalance and Loss
across NSCLC
HLA mutations, which have the ability to disrupt neoantigen-
MHC binding, have been previously described in many cancer
types, including NSCLC (Shukla et al., 2015). However, despite
being linked to cancer and immune escape, mutations in HLA
genes are infrequently detected (Lawrence et al., 2014; Shukla
et al., 2015). In our cohort of 90 lung adenocarcinoma or lung
squamous cell carcinoma TRACERx patients, only tumors from
three patients were found to harbor nonsynonymous mutations
in HLA genes using Polysolver (Shukla et al., 2015) (Figure 2A).
One lung adenocarcinoma tumor had also acquired a mutation
in b-2 microglobulin (B2m), which is vital for MHC class I expres-
sion
and
peptide
binding
stability.
No
further
mutations
predicted to disrupt antigen presentation or the MHC class I
complex were identified in this cohort. Likewise, a broader study
of 174 lung squamous cell and 223 lung adenocarcinoma
patients from TCGA only classified 8% and 5% of tumors as
harboring HLA mutations, respectively (Shukla et al., 2015).
In 36/90 (40%) of NSCLCs LOHHLA identified HLA LOH,
where either the maternal or paternal allele was lost, resulting
in HLA homozygosity. Just as HLA mutations occur more
frequently in lung squamous cell carcinomas (Shukla et al.,
2015), we also observed an enrichment for HLA LOH in this his-
tological subtype (p = 0.004, 19/31 [61%] of lung squamous cell
carcinomas versus 17/59 [29%] of lung adenocarcinomas) (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B). The high frequency with which HLA LOH occurs
and the possibility of previously antigenic peptides no longer
being presented on the lost allele suggests that HLA LOH has
the capacity to be a more prevalent mechanism of immune
disruption than HLA or B2M mutations.
To investigate whether HLA allele-specific loss was an early
event in the tumor’s evolution, present clonally in every cancer
cell, or whether it was present subclonally, in only a subset of
cancer cells, indicating an occurrence later in evolution and
potentially in response to a shift in the equilibrium between im-
mune recognition and evasion, we utilized the high-depth and
multi-region nature of the TRACERx dataset. In this cohort of
early stage NSCLC tumors, HLA LOH appeared to frequently
occur subclonally in both histological subtypes, with 13/17
lung adenocarcinoma and 9/17 lung squamous cell carcinomas
exhibiting loss of an HLA allele in a subset of cancer cells (Figures
2C and 2D). Clonality of the HLA LOH event could not be deter-
mined for two lung squamous cell carcinoma patients with only a
single region available for copy-number analysis. Phylogenetic
analysis permitted us to map HLA LOH events to probable

 subclones from the tumor’s evolutionary tree (Figures 2E and 2F)
(Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017). These data suggest that selective
pressure from the immune system may increase during tumor
development and also that without multi-region sequencing,
the prevalence of HLA LOH may be significantly underestimated.
To shed further light on the timing of HLA LOH in NSCLC tumor
evolution, we obtained sequencing data for 37 NSCLC primary
tumors with matched brain metastases (Brastianos et al.,
2015). Consistent with data from early stage NSCLC, we identi-
fied HLA LOH in 17/37 (46%) tumors and found that the LOH
event occurred subclonally in 11/17 (65%) cases in which it
occurred (Figure 2G). Furthermore, when we compared primary
and metastatic samples taken from the same patient, we
observed a trend toward enrichment of HLA LOH in brain
metastases compared to the matched primary tumor (p = 0.08,
McNemar’s test), with seven patients harboring HLA LOH in
the metastatic sample alone and only one patient where the
converse was observed, with HLA LOH in the primary tumor
alone (Figure 2H). These results support the notion of HLA LOH
occurring later in cancer evolution and indicate that there may
be selection for immune evasive mechanisms in late stage
disease.
HLA Loss Is under Positive Selection in NSCLC
Given the relevance to immune evasion and high incidence of
both clonal and subclonal LOH in HLA genes, we asked whether
HLA LOH was significantly more frequent than expected by
chance. Taking the frequency of LOH in every tumor into ac-
count, we simulated the expected frequencies of both focal
and arm-level events. The observed incidence of focal, but not
arm-level, HLA LOH occurred at a significantly greater frequency
than expected by chance (Figures 3, p < 0.001, and S3). Indeed,
we observed a clear peak in focal LOH centered around the HLA
locus for both histological subtypes. This peak was more pro-
nounced when restricting the analysis to subclonal LOH (Fig-
ure S3). Thus, while chromosomal instability may lead to LOH
at the HLA locus, facilitating immune escape, the high preva-
lence of HLA LOH, beyond that expected by chance, suggests
it is subject to significant positive selection in tumor evolution.
Moreover, in keeping with a strong selective pressure later in
tumor evolution, in four tumors we observed losses of HLA hap-
lotypes occurring as distinct events on separate branches of the
tumors’ phylogenetic trees, indicative of parallel evolution with
convergence upon HLA loss (Figure 3C). Of note, in all four cases
where we observed parallel evolution, the same alleles were
subject to loss on distinct branches, suggesting that loss of
these alleles specifically may have been required for subclonal
expansions.
We
also
noted
that
in
certain
cases
(e.g.,
CRUK0051) only one HLA gene was subject to allele-specific
loss, implying a selective benefit of perturbations to neoantigen
presentation associated with that gene specifically.
Taken together with the recently described significant muta-
tion frequency in HLA genes across tumors (Lawrence et al.,
2014; Shukla et al., 2015), these data implicate HLA LOH as a
common mechanism of immune evasion in lung cancer evolu-
tion. Furthermore, these data suggest that the immune system
acts as a strong selection pressure during branched tumor
development.
It is also notable that while HLA LOH was identified in 36 tu-
mors, we did not identify any tumors exhibiting homozygous de-
letions of HLA. Concordant with this observation, the variant
allele frequencies of mutations that have been identified in HLA
genes are indicative of a heterozygous state (Shukla et al.,
2015). These data support the notion that a single copy of an
HLA haplotype may be mandatory to avoid NK-mediated target
cell lysis (Moretta et al., 2014).
HLA Loss Reflects Immune Editing and Is Associated
with an Enrichment of Subclonal Mutations
Conceivably, if one of the homologous chromosomes harboring
the HLA haplotypes were subject to copy-number loss, the
number of putative neoantigens presented to T cells would be
reduced. Thus, we hypothesized that loss of an HLA haplotype
may be permissive for subclonal expansions and would be asso-
ciated with an elevated mutation/neoantigen burden.
We first compared the number of non-synonymous mutations
and neoantigens present in tumor samples with and without LOH
at the HLA locus, without taking into account timing or clonal
nature of the HLA LOH event. While overall, we observed a sig-
nificant increase in the number of non-synonymous mutations

(C and D) Pie charts show the timing of HLA LOH events using multi-region information for lung adenocarcinoma (C) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (D).
Events at individual HLA A/B/C loci were considered clonal if they were found in every region considered and subclonal if they were found in only a subset of tumor
regions. A patient sample was considered to have clonal HLA LOH if all of the individual loci lost in that tumor occurred clonally. Two lung squamous cell
carcinoma patients with only a single region available for copy-number analysis are not shown.
(E and F) Phylogenetic trees for each lung adenocarcinoma (E) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (F) showing evidence of HLA LOH have been annotated with
the most likely timing of the HLA LOH event. Homozygous HLA alleles, where HLA LOH is not possible, are indicated by an asterisk. Clones on the phylogenetic
tree (nodes) are indicated as clonal (blue) or subclonal (red). In cases where the HLA LOH event did not map to a possible clone on the phylogenetic tree, an
additional gray subclone was included.
(G) Number of NSCLC patients from Brastianos et al. (2015) with paired primary/brain metastasis sequencing data available exhibiting no HLA LOH (gray), HLA
LOH in both the primary tumor and brain metastasis (green), HLA LOH only in the primary tumor (red), or HLA LOH only in the brain metastasis (blue). Patients with
HLA LOH identified consistently across HLA loci in both the primary tumor and every brain metastases were considered to have clonal HLA LOH. Patients with
inconsistent HLA loci subject to LOH or those with HLA LOH identified in only a primary or brain metastasis sample were considered to have subclonal HLA LOH.
(H) Timing of the HLA LOH events. Clonal HLA LOH events occur in both the primary tumor sample and the brain metastases (green), whereas subclonal HLA LOH
events either arise in the brain metastases (blue) or have occurred in a subclone of the primary tumor that does not seed the brain metastasis (red). Overall, an
increase in HLA LOH is observed in the brain metastases samples as compared to the primary tumor (27% to 43%) and a corresponding decrease is observed in
brain metastases samples exhibiting no HLA LOH (73% to 57%).

 the subtypes were considered separately (NSCLC p = 0.016;
lung adenocarcinoma p = 0.07; lung squamous cell carcinoma
p = 0.82, Wilcoxon test). However, we observed only 3/36
tumors with HLA LOH that exhibited a low mutational burden
(as defined by the lowest quartile of NSCLC mutation burden),
compared to 21/54 tumors without HLA LOH.
When we considered the clonal nature of mutations, we found
that among tumors with HLA LOH there was a significant in-
crease in the number of subclonal, but not clonal, non-synony-
mous mutations (Figures 4B and 4C) (NSCLC p = 0.008; lung
adenocarcinoma p = 0.01; lung squamous cell carcinoma
p = 0.6, Wilcoxon test) and neoantigens (Figures S4B and
S4C). This observation is consistent with HLA LOH frequently
occurring as a branched, subclonal event and indicates that
HLA LOH may allow for the accumulation of potentially antigenic
subclonal mutations. Consistent with this, we found that when
HLA LOH occurred as a clonal event, on the trunk of a tumor’s
phylogenetic tree, this was significantly associated with both
an elevated clonal (NSCLC p = 0.002; lung adenocarcinoma
p = 0.01; lung squamous cell carcinoma p = 0.29, Wilcoxon
test) and subclonal (NSCLC p = 0.03; lung adenocarcinoma
p = 0.004; lung squamous cell carcinoma p = 0.89, Wilcoxon
test) non-synonymous mutation and neoantigen burden (Figures
4B, 4C, S4B, and S4C).
When we considered HLA LOH events at the region-level, we
also observed a significant increase in subclonal mutations be-
tween tumor regions exhibiting HLA loss compared to tumor
regions from patients without any evidence for HLA LOH (Fig-
ure S4D; NSCLC p = 1.9e-05; lung adenocarcinoma p = 0.009;
lung squamous cell carcinoma p = 0.07). Interestingly, even in
tumor regions without HLA LOH, but evidence for HLA LOH in
other regions from the same tumor, we observed a significantly
higher burden of subclonal mutations compared to tumor
regions derived from tumors without any evidence for HLA
LOH (Figure S4D). Thus, while HLA LOH may allow for subse-
quent subclonal expansion, a tumor with a high mutational
burden may be under increased selective pressure for the HLA
LOH event.
We next considered the specific cancer subclones in which
HLA LOH events occurred, allowing us to more directly assess
the impact of HLA LOH on non-synonymous mutation and neo-
antigen burden in cancer cells (Figure S4E). In tumors with sub-
clonal HLA LOH, we directly compared the mutational burden of
the cancer subclone harboring HLA loss with its sister subclone,
descended from the same ancestral cancer cell, but without HLA
loss. Among the 36 tumors exhibiting any HLA LOH, we identified
19 instances where the event was subclonal and not on a terminal
node for which a comparison between sister subclones could be
made. Subclones with HLA LOH consistently showed a higher
non-synonymous mutational burden than their counterparts
without HLA LOH, regardless of histological subtype (Figure 4D;

19 instances of the subclone with HLA LOH having fewer non-
synonymous mutations than its sister subclone without HLA
LOH. This result suggests that HLA LOH may contribute to
the observed increase in subclonal non-synonymous mutations
among tumors harboring HLA LOH.

Figure 4. Non-synonymous Mutational Burden Associates with HLA LOH, and Neoantigens More Frequently Bind the Lost Allele
(A) The total number of nonsynonymous mutations is plotted across different categories of HLA LOH for lung adenocarcinoma (light blue) and lung squamous cell
carcinomas (magenta). Tumors were classified as having: no HLA LOH; any HLA LOH event, without taking into account the timing of the event; or clonal HLA
LOH. The lowest total non-synonymous mutation quartile is indicated by the dashed red line and the proportion of tumors with a total non-synonymous mutational
burden greater or less than that is indicated by the pie charts for each HLA LOH classification group.
(B) The number of clonal non-synonymous mutations is plotted across different categories of HLA LOH for lung adenocarcinoma (light blue) and lung squamous
cell carcinomas (magenta).
(C) The number of subclonal non-synonymous mutations is plotted across different categories of HLA LOH for lung adenocarcinoma (light blue) and lung
squamous cell carcinomas (magenta). All p values are calculated using an unpaired Wilcoxon test.
(D) The number of non-synonymous mutations found in the clone harboring the HLA LOH event compared to the number of non-synonymous mutations in its
sister clone, descended from the same ancestral cancer cell, but without HLA LOH. The p value is calculated using a paired Wilcoxon test.
(E) The number of subclonal neoantigens predicted to bind to either the lost HLA allele or the kept HLA allele is indicated for all NSCLC tumors exhibiting HLA LOH, all
lung adenocarcinoma tumors with HLA LOH, and all lung squamous tumors with HLA LOH. A red line indicates an elevated subclonal neoantigen mutation burden in
the HLA LOH subclone compared to the subclone without HLA LOH, while blue indicates the converse. The p value is calculated using a paired Wilcoxon test.
(F) The total number of mutations predicted to result in a binder to the lost allele is shown for all patients with at least one HLA LOH event. The mutation clonality is
also indicated as either clonal (light blue) or subclonal (light red).

 While there were only three instances of low mutational burden
in tumors harboring an HLA LOH event (Figure 4A) and an in-
crease in mutation burden in subclones harboring HLA LOH
was observed in both cancer types, we noted that a significant
increase in subclonal non-synonymous mutation burden in tu-
mors with loss of an HLA allele compared to those without
HLA LOH was only observed among the lung adenocarcinomas.
These data suggest that while HLA LOH may allow for acquisi-
tion of subclonal mutations in lung squamous cell carcinomas,
there are likely to be additional mechanisms contributing to the
observed high subclonal mutational burden in tumors without
HLA LOH in this subtype.
To address whether a particular mutational process contrib-
utes to the subclonal mutational burden present in tumors with
HLA LOH, we interrogated the mutational signatures present in
each tumor (Alexandrov et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2016).
Among lung adenocarcinoma tumors that exhibited any HLA
LOH, we observed a significant increase in the APOBEC
mutagenic signatures (Signature 2 and Signature 13) (NSCLC
p = 0.03; lung adenocarcinoma p = 0.003, lung squamous cell
carcinoma p = 0.63, Figure S4F); however, no other signature
found in this cohort (Signatures 1A, 4, and 5) appeared to differ-
entially contribute between groups.
Only neoantigens binding to the kept HLA alleles will be pre-
sented to the immune system. We reasoned that if HLA LOH
reflects cancer immune-editing one would expect to observe
an enrichment of subclonal neoantigens predicted to bind with
high affinity to the lost HLA alleles compared to the kept HLA
alleles. We therefore investigated tumors with six distinct HLA
alleles and loss of one HLA haplotype (HLA-A, HLA-B, and
HLA-C) in at least one tumor region (n = 20; 9 lung adenocarci-
nomas and 11 lung squamous cell carcinoma). Consistent with
LOH at the HLA locus representing immune editing and facili-
tating accumulation of subclonal neoantigens, we observed a
significant enrichment for subclonal neoantigens predicted to
bind to the lost HLA alleles compared to the kept alleles (Fig-
ure 4E) (NSCLC p = 0.0083; lung adenocarcinoma p = 0.29;
lung squamous cell carcinoma p = 0.02, paired Wilcoxon
test). In one extreme example, tumor CRUK0020, a lung adeno-
carcinoma, we observed a total of 1,220 mutations predicted to
yield neoantigens, of which 92% were predicted to bind to lost
HLA alleles.
To determine more generally the impact HLA LOH might have
on which neoantigens are presented to the immune system, we
identified neoantigens predicted to bind to lost alleles in the full
cohort of 36 patients exhibiting any HLA LOH (Figure 4F). We
found that all patients harbored mutations predicted to bind
to a now lost HLA allele, highlighting the potential impact HLA
LOH could have on the targeting of putative neoantigens in
a clinical setting, such as through personalized neoantigen vac-
cine approaches (Ott et al., 2017; Sahin et al., 2017).
HLA Loss and Immune Phenotype
Next, to investigate whether HLA loss might be associated
with an immune replete tumor microenvironment, we performed
immunohistochemistry analysis to determine the expression of
PD-L1 on both tumor and immune cells. PD-L1 is a ligand to
the immune inhibitory receptor PD1 and its expression may
reflect a cancer adaptive immune response to an active immune
system.
We found tumors exhibiting clonal HLA LOH were character-
ized by significantly elevated PD-L1 staining of immune cells
compared to tumors without any HLA LOH (p = 0.029, Cochrane
Armitage test), and a trend was observed for elevated PD-L1
staining on tumor cells (p = 0.14, Cochrane Armitage test). These
data are consistent with the notion that HLA LOH may facilitate
immune escape in response to an active immune microenviron-
ment (Figures 5A and 5B).
To further validate our findings in a larger cohort with RNA-
seq data, we obtained 383 lung adenocarcinomas and 309
lung squamous-cell carcinomas samples from TCGA (Campbell
et al., 2016).
In keeping with results from the TRACERx cohort, we found
HLA LOH was highly prevalent in lung squamous-cell carci-
nomas (133/309) and lung adenocarcinomas (118/383) tumors
and significantly enriched in lung squamous cell carcinomas
compared to adenocarcinomas (p = 0.001, Fisher’s exact test)
(Figure S5A). Additionally, we again observed a significantly
higher non-synonymous mutation burden in lung adenocarci-
nomas tumors exhibiting HLA LOH (p = 0.0001, Wilcoxon test),
regardless of whether the HLA LOH affected a single locus
(p = 0.002, Wilcoxon test) or all three HLA loci (p = 0.003, Wil-
coxon test) (Figure S5B), a factor we could now consider due
to the increased sample size from TCGA.
Previous work has identified immune signatures indicative
of immune activity and/or immune cell infiltrates (Davoli et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2016; Rooney et al., 2015). By using these signa-
tures, we were able to further investigate whether HLA loss was
associated with a specific immune phenotype. Consistent with
the immunohistochemistry results, in both lung adenocarcinoma
and lung squamous cell carcinomas harboring HLA LOH, we
identified a significantly elevated cytolytic activity score, which
measures the levels of two genes upregulated upon CD8+
T cell activation, granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin (PRF1) (Roo-
ney et al., 2015) (Figure 5C). In lung adenocarcinoma with HLA
LOH at all three loci, we observed an increase in abundance of
CD8+ T cells and expression profiles associated with improved
checkpoint blockade response (Herbst et al., 2014; Li et al.,
2016; Piha-Paul et al., 2016; Ribas et al., 2015; Rooney et al.,
2015; Tumeh et al., 2014). Additionally, we identified an increase
in NK cells, suggesting that HLA LOH alone may interrupt
inhibitory NK cell/MHC interactions (Figure 5C). Differential
expression analysis between tumors with and without LOH
confirmed an increase of PD-L1 and effector molecules such
as granzymes-A, -B, and -H, as well as STAT1 and interferon
(IFN)-g, in lung adenocarcinoma with HLA LOH but not lung
squamous cell carcinoma (Table S1).
These data suggest that lung tumors with HLA loss have a
more active immune predatory microenvironment and disruption
of antigen presentation may act as a mechanism to evade the
immune system.
DISCUSSION
Losing the ability to present productive tumor neoantigens could
facilitate evasion from immune predation. An integral part of
1266
Cell 171, 1259–1271, November 30, 2017
 neoantigen presentation is the HLA class I molecule, which pre-
sents epitopes to T cells on the cell surface. Thus, loss of an HLA
allele, resulting in HLA homozygosity, may be a mechanism of
immune escape (Figure 6).
However, the polymorphic nature of the HLA locus precludes
accurate copy-number calling using conventional copy-num-
ber tools. Here, we present LOHHLA, a computational tool to
systematically evaluate the prevalence and importance of HLA
loss in lung cancer evolution using next-generation sequencing
data (Figure 1).
We evaluated the performance of LOHHLA using two inde-
pendent methods. We found LOHHLA LOH and allelic imbal-
ance estimates were consistently in agreement with those
inferred from adjacent genomic segments using the state-of-
the-art copy-number tool ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010). PCR-
based fragment analyses of polymorphic stretches of DNA vali-
dated the accuracy of LOHHLA using an approach independent
of exome sequencing. Importantly, LOHHLA is able to deter-
mine which specific HLA haplotype is subject to copy-number
loss, which is not possible using conventional copy-num-
ber tools.
Using LOHHLA, we find that HLA loss occurs in 40% of
early-stage NSCLCs. The focal nature and high frequency,
beyond that expected using simulations, suggest HLA LOH
is strongly selected for in NSCLC evolution. The subclonal
frequency of HLA loss, occurring in a subset of cancer cells,
on the branches of the tumors’ phylogenetic trees, suggests
it is often a later event in tumor evolution and that the
local, region-specific, immune microenvironment may act as
a key selective force in shaping branched tumor evolution.
In keeping with these results, in four early stage tumors, we
observed evidence for parallel evolution of HLA allele-specific
loss, and in a cohort of primary NSCLC tumors with matched
brain metastasis
(Brastianos
et al.,
2015),
we detected
HLA LOH in 47% of cases, occurring subclonally in the major-
ity of cases (11/17) and preferentially at the metastatic
sites (Figure 3H). These results support the notion that escape
from immune predation represents a significant constraint

 to tumor evolution. These observations have parallels with
HIV
evolution
whereby
patients
with
homozygous
HLA
alleles exhibit more rapid progression to AIDS compared to
patients with heterozygous HLA alleles (Martin and Carrington,
2013).
In both lung adenocarcinomas and lung squamous cell carci-
nomas, subclones harboring HLA LOH were associated with a
significantly elevated non-synonymous mutation/neoantigen
burden compared to subclones descended from the same
ancestral cancer cell but without HLA LOH. Tumors with HLA
LOH were found to exhibit an enrichment of neoantigens pre-
dicted to bind to the lost HLA alleles and were associated with
significantly elevated PD-L1 staining on immune cells and RNA
signatures of immune activation. These data suggest that loss
of HLA alleles, under the selective pressure of immune preda-
tion, may be permissive for subclonal expansions and result in
previously antigenic mutations becoming effectively invisible to
the immune system.
The high mutational load and low levels of HLA expression
in lung squamous cell tumors (McGranahan et al., 2016), even
in tumors without HLA LOH suggests alternative mechanisms
of immune evasion and/or disruption of neoantigen presentation
through other mechanisms (e.g., mutations to B2M or NLRC5)
(del Campo et al., 2014; Yoshihama et al., 2016). In this regard,
we note that LOHHLA could be extended to perform haplo-
type-specific copy number on any genomic segment that has
been subject to haplotyping. For instance, if HLA class II typing
has been performed, LOHHLA can be implemented to assess
the extent to which loss of HLA class II occurs in tumor evolution
and which haplotype is subject to loss.
Further work is warranted to explore the extent to which HLA
LOH represents a pan-cancer immune evasion mechanism.
Immunohistochemistry analysis has documented loss of HLA
expression in many cancers (Campoli and Ferrone, 2008; Hicklin
et al., 1999; Mehta et al., 2008), however, the extent to which
allele-specific loss of HLA molecules is a pervasive mechanism
of immune evasion in tumor evolution across cancer types re-
mains unclear. Furthermore, as more data pre- and post-therapy
emerges, it will be possible to investigate the extent to which
HLA LOH represents a common mechanism of resistance within
the context of checkpoint blockade (and other immune-targeted)
therapies.
Our results may also have implications for vaccine- and T cell-
based therapeutic approaches, specifically targeting neoanti-
gens, with up to 92% predicted neoantigens in one tumor found
to bind the lost haplotype. Indeed, consistent with the findings of
Tran et al. (2016), these findings support the notion that taking
into account HLA LOH might help determine which set of
predicted neoantigens are more likely to elicit an effective
T cell response.
In conclusion, LOHHLA enables accurate estimation of haplo-
type-specific HLA loss from sequencing data, revealing that HLA
LOH is a common feature of NSCLC, facilitating immune escape
and subclonal genome evolution.

Model illustrating how HLA LOH may lead to immune escape in tumors. During tumor evolution, the accumulation of neoantigens may induce local immune
infiltrates, including CD8 T cells. Local immune infiltrates may act as a selection barrier for tumors. Subclones with HLA LOH may be positively selected as these
can evade killing by avoiding CD8 T cell recognition. Alternatively, other subclones may evade killing through other mechanisms.

 METHOD DETAILS
LOHHLA (Loss Of Heterozygosity in Human Leukocyte Antigen) algorithm
As input, LOHHLA requires: a tumor and germline BAM; patient-specific HLA calls, either predicted by an HLA inference tool (e.g.,
POLYSOLVER [Shukla et al., 2015] or Optitype [Szolek et al., 2014]) or through HLA serotyping; the HLA fasta file location; purity and
ploidy estimates. (For implementation of LOHHLA in this manuscript, ASCAT was used to estimate tumor purity and ploidy, while HLA
inference was performed using POLYSOLVER, see below.)
To call HLA LOH, LOHHLA relies upon five computational steps:
Step 1: extract HLA reads
First, tumor and germline reads that map to the HLA region of the genome (chr6:29909037-29913661, chr6:31321649-31324964, and
chr6:31236526-31239869) as well as chromosome 6 contigs (chr6_cox_hap2, chr6_dbb_hap3, chr6_mann_hap4, chr6_mcf_hap5,
chr6_qbl_hap6, chr6_ssto_hap7) are extracted using samtools view. Unpaired mates from this step are removed and the output is
converted to FASTQ format.
Step 2: create HLA allele specific BAM files
For each of the patient’s heterozygous HLA alleles, a patient-specific reference fasta is created. The FASTQ files generated in the
previous step are used to generate HLA specific BAM files,using similar mapping parameters to those previously published that allow
for reads to map to multiple HLA alleles (Shukla et al., 2015). Post-alignment filtering is subsequently performed such that reads
whose mates map to a different allele are discarded, as well as any reads that contain more than one insertion, deletion, or mismatch
event compared to the reference HLA allele. For each filtered tumor/germline HLA allele-specific BAM file, coverage is then calcu-
lated using samtools mpileup.
Step 3: determine coverage at mismatch positions between homologous HLA alleles
For each HLA locus, a local pairwise alignment is performed between the two homologous HLA alleles, using the R Biostrings pack-
age. From the pairwise alignment, all of the mismatch positions between the two homologs are extracted. The HLA-specific coverage
calculated in Step 2 is then used to determine differences in coverage at each of the mismatch positions. An additional file is also
generated containing the coverage at every mismatch position, counting each read only once, as to avoid over-counting reads
that span more than one mismatch position.
Step 4: obtain HLA specific logR and BAF
LogR across each HLA gene is then obtained by binning the coverage across both homologous alleles at 150 base pair intervals, for
both tumor and normal. For each bin, the tumor/normal coverage ratio is multiplied by the multiplication factor, M, corresponding to
number of unique mapped reads in the germline, divided by the number of unique mapped reads in the tumor region.
The BAF, corresponding to the coverage of HLA allele 1 divided by the coverage of HLA allele 1 + coverage of HLA allele 2, is sub-
sequently calculated at each polymorphic site.
Step 5: determine HLA haplotype specific copy number
Finally, at each polymorphic site, an estimate of the major and minor allele copy number is obtained using the following equations:
Allele 1 = r � 1 + BAF 3 2logR 3 ð2ð1 � rÞ + r 3 jÞ
r
Allele 2 = r � 1 � 2ðBAF � 1ÞlogR 3 ð2ð1 � rÞ + r 3 jÞ
r
where r = tumor purity and j = tumor ploidy, which are input at the start. The logR value from the corresponding bin in which the
polymorphic site was found to reside is used as well as the BAF of the polymorphic site.
For each bin, the median Allele 1 and Allele 2 copy number is then determined. To estimate copy number of Allele 1, the median
value across bins is calculated. Likewise, to estimate the copy number of Allele 2, the median value across bins is calculated.
A copy number < 0.5, is classified as subject to loss, and thereby indicative of LOH. To avoid over-calling LOH, we also calculate
a p value relating to allelic imbalance for each HLA gene. This p value corresponds to the pairwise difference in logR values at
mismatch sites between the two HLA homologs, adjusted to ensure each sequencing read is only counted once. Allelic imbalance
is determined if p < 0.01 using the paired Student’s t-Test between the two distributions.
TRACERx 100 Cohort
TRACERx samples considered were obtained from (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017). Four patients were excluded due to homozygosity
at all three HLA loci or too few mismatch positions between HLA alleles. Lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma
tumors were considered for downstream analyses. Seven tumors were classified as having a separate histology. Of these, one
carcinosarcoma exhibited HLA LOH and three adenosquamous carcinomas, one carcinosarcoma, one large cell carcinoma, and
one large cell neuroendocrine tumor did not.

 TRACERx mutation and copy number data
TRACERx mutation data was obtained from Jamal-Hanjani et al. (2017). In brief, mutations were called using VarScan2 (Koboldt
et al., 2012) and MuTect (1.1.4) (Cibulskis et al., 2013). To estimate whether mutations were clonal or subclonal, a modified version
of PyClone was implemented (Roth et al., 2014). ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010) segmented copy number data, purity and ploidy
estimates were obtained from Jamal-Hanjani et al. (2017).
To compare LOHHLA to additional tools, we also implemented Sequenza (Favero et al., 2015), and TITAN (Ha et al., 2014). In both
cases, default settings were used. For TITAN, the purity estimates from ASCAT were used as input.
Comparison of ASCAT and LOHHLA
In order to compare ASCAT and LOHHLA we treated each tumor region as a separate sample, and ran it through the LOHHLA pipe-
line with default settings. Note, for this analysis we used all TRACERx samples available, including NSCLCs that were not classified
as lung adenocarcinomas or lung squamous cell carcinomas.
Given that it was not possible to directly infer the copy number of the HLA alleles using ASCAT, the segment overlapping the HLA
locus was used. In twenty-five tumor regions from seven tumors no segment overlapped the HLA locus, and in these cases, the
closest genomic segment was used.
To compare our allelic imbalance estimates, we considered a tumor region to be concordant if ASCAT predicted allelic imbalance
across the locus and at least one HLA gene using LOHHLA was found to harbor allelic imbalance. Likewise, for LOH, we considered
ASCAT and LOHHLA estimates to be concordant if ASCAT predicted a minor allele of 0 and this was also predicted for at least one
HLA gene.
Conversely, allelic imbalance estimates were classified as discordant if allelic imbalance was predicted in any HLA gene
using LOHHA and not with ASCAT. Similarly, LOH was classified as discordant if any HLA gene using LOHHLA was classified as
exhibiting a minor allele of 0 and no LOH was identified using ASCAT.
Fragment analysis validation of LOHHLA results
Allelic imbalance was validated using four polymorphic Sequence-Tagged Site (STR) markers located on the short arm of chromo-
some 6, close to the HLA locus - (D6S2852, D6S2872, D6S248 and D6S1022). 20ng of patient germline and tumor region DNA was
amplified using the PCR. The PCR comprised of 35 cycles of denaturing at 95C for 45 s, followed by an annealing temperature of 55C
for 45 s and then a PCR extension at 720C for 45 s. PCR products were separated on the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer. Fragment length
and area under the curve of each allele was determined using the Applied Biosystems software GeneMapper v5. When two separate
alleles were identified for a particular marker, the fragments could be analyzed for allelic imbalance using the formula (Atumor/Btumor)/
(Anormal/Bnormal). The output of this formula was defined as the normalized allelic ratio.
HLA Type, HLA Mutations, and Predicted NeoAntigen Binders
The HLA type for each sample was inferred using POLYSOLVER (POLYmorphic loci reSOLVER), which uses a normal tissue BAM file
as input and employs a Bayesian classifier to determine genotype (Shukla et al., 2015). HLA mutations in each tumor region were also
assessed using POLYSOLVER.
Novel 9-11-mer peptides that could arise from identified non-silent mutations present in the sample (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017)
were determined. The predicted IC50 binding affinities and rank percentage scores, representing the rank of the predicted affinity
compared to a set of 400,000 random natural peptides, were calculated for all peptides binding to each of the patient’s HLA alleles
using netMHCpan-2.8 and netMHC-4.0 (Andreatta and Nielsen, 2016; Hoof et al., 2009; Nielsen et al., 2003). Putative neoantigen
binders were those peptides with a predicted binding affinity < 500nM or rank percentage score < 2%.
Mapping HLA LOH to phylogenetic trees and identification of parallel evolution
LOH events detected in every tumor region tested were considered to be clonal events and mapped to the trunk of the phylogenetic
tree. For heterogeneous LOH events, the regional copy number of the HLA allele lost was used in conjunction with the patient tree
structure and subclone cancer cell fractions in a quadratic programming approach, using the R package quadprog, to determine the
best placement of the LOH event.
This was achieved by solving a quadratic programming equation:
minð � d^T b + 1=2b^T D bÞ
with the constraints:
A^T b > = bvec:
The LOH event was tested at each branch. For each possibility, the phylogenetic tree was broken into two, one containing all
clones after the LOH event and the other consisting of the remainder of the tree. A 2xn matrix, where n is the number of regions
sampled, was constructed containing the regional sum of the cancer cell fractions for each subclone in the subtree and the regional
sum of cancer cell fractions from subclones in the remaining tree. The regional cancer cell fraction matrix was multiplied by the
e3
Cell 171, 1259–1271.e1–e5, November 30, 2017
 transpose of itself to generate a 2x2 matrix for input (Dmat) into the quadprog function, solve.QP. The vector to be minimized (dvec)
was obtained by multiplying the LOHHLA calculated HLA allele copy number for each region by the transpose of the regional cancer
cell fraction matrix. Finally, the solve.QP function was called with Dmat and dvec, using a constraint matrix, Amat, such that all results
had to be positive and a constraint vector, bvec, such that the estimated copy number of HLA allele for the remaining tree was at least
0.5. The errors between observed and predicted copy number values from placing LOH event on each branch were output and the
solution providing the least error was selected.
Each mapped event was inspected and events that did not fit the phylogenetic tree or had large error values, either indicating
the presence of an additional subclone or multiple independent HLA LOH events, were manually adjusted. Patients CRUK0013,
CRUK0061, CRUK0082, and CRUK0084 had HLA LOH events that did not fit the current phylogentic tree, so additional nodes (indi-
cated in gray) were included to contain the HLA LOH event. Patients CRUK003, CRUK0032, CRUK0051, and CRUK0062 had multiple
independent HLA LOH events which were manually mapped.
Assessing significance of focal and arm-level LOH
In order to assess whether HLA LOH occurred more than expected by chance, we considered whether each LOH event was focal or
arm-level in nature. In brief, to classify LOH as arm-level or focal, we focused on the minor allele frequency across the genome. First,
any segments (as predicted by ASCAT) with identical minor allele copy numbers were merged. Subsequently, segments that
spanned > = 75% the length of a given chromosome arm, were classified as ‘arm-level’, while segments that were < 75% were
considered focal.
To assess the significance of focal events, for each tumor, the proportion of the genome subject to focal minor allele loss was deter-
mined. This value was assumed to reflect the probability for focal minor allele loss in each tumor. Based on this probability, we gener-
ated an aberration state (loss or no loss) for each sample separately and determined the proportion of samples exhibiting loss. We
repeated this process 10,000 times to obtain a background distribution reflecting the likelihood of observing losses given the prob-
ability of loss in each sample. A p value reflecting the likelihood of observing the level of minor allele loss seen at the HLA locus was
determined by counting the percentage of simulations showing a higher proportion loss than that observed.
The same procedure was conducted for arm-level events, using the observed frequency of arm-level allele specific loss in
each tumor.
Mutational signature analysis
Mutational signatures were estimated using the deconstructSigs R package (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Signature 1A, 2, 4, 5, 13 were
considered.
Assessing whether neoantigens preferentially bind to loss HLA alleles
To assess whether neoantigens preferentially bind to lost HLA alleles, we focused on tumors exhibiting six distinct HLA alleles (i.e., no
homozygosity for any allele in the germline) and loss of one HLA haplotype (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) in at least one tumor region.
Neoantigens (as defined above), were ranked according to IC50 binding scores. Duplicate mutations were removed to ensure each
neoantigen reflected the highest binding score (lowest IC50 value) for any given mutation. We further filtered the mutation list to only
include subclonal mutations (defined as previously described (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017)) occurring in the tumor regions harboring
loss events (> 5% VAF). The number of subclonal neoantigens binding to each haplotype was then determined for each tumor.
A paired wilcoxon test was used to compare the number of subclonal neoantigens binding to the lost haplotype compared to the
kept haplotype.
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of 4-um thickness were stained for PD-L1 with an anti-human PD-L1 rabbit
monoclonal antibody (clone SP142; Ventana, Tucson, AZ) on an automated staining platform (Benchmark; Ventana) with the Opti-
View DAB IHC Detection Kit and the OptiView Amplification Kit (Ventana Medical Systems Inc.) in a GCP-compliant central laboratory
(Targos Molecular Pathology GmbH). PD-L1 expression was evaluated on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. For tumor
cells the proportion of PD-L1-positive cells was estimated as the percentage of total tumor cells. For tumor-infiltrating immune cells,
the percentage of PD-L1-positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells occupying the tumor was recorded. Scoring was performed by a
trained histopathologist [according to previously published scoring criteria (Herbst et al., 2014)].
Analysis of TCGA mutation data
TCGA tumor and matched germline exome sequencing BAM files for both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n = 397) and lung squamous
cell carcinoma (LUSC, n = 350), were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) via https://
cghub.ucsc.edu. The data was processed as previously described (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017).
RNA-seq expression analysis using TCGA
RNA-sequencing data was downloaded from the TCGA data portal. For each LUAD and LUSC sample, all available ‘Level_30
gene-level data was obtained. Previously defined measures of immune infiltration and activity were used to compare the immune

 microenvironment between tumors exhibiting HLA LOH at all HLA loci and those without any evidence for HLA LOH (Davoli et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2016; Rooney et al., 2015). Additionally the expression level of PD-L1, CTLA4, and an IFN score were compared
(Herbst et al., 2014; Piha-Paul et al., 2016; Ribas et al., 2015; Tumeh et al., 2014). Significance was determined using a Wilcoxon
test and FDR correction. To determine the degree of change between the HLA LOH groups, a ratio of the medians was calculated.
For differential expression analysis, the raw RNA-seq read counts were used as input into the R package DESeq2 for analysis. An
FDR cutoff of 0.05 was used to determine genes significantly differentially expressed.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All analysis was performed in the R statistical environment version > = 3.2.1. All statistical tests were two-sided and statistical sig-
nificance was determined if p value was less than 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Comparisons were made using the Fisher’s exact
test Figure 2B, as described above for Figure 3, unpaired Wilcoxon test for Figures 4A–4C, and paired Wilcoxon test for Figures 4D
and 4E.

 Figure S4. Neoantigen and Regional HLA LOH Associations, Related to Figure 4
(A) The total number of neoantigens is plotted across different categories of HLA LOH for lung adenocarcinoma (light blue) and lung squamous cell carcinomas
(magenta). Tumors were classified as having: no HLA LOH; any HLA LOH event, without taking into account the timing of the event; subclonal HLA LOH; or clonal
HLA LOH. The lowest total neoantigen quartile is indicated by the dashed red line and the proportion of tumors with a total neoantigen burden greater or less than
that is indicated by the pie charts for each HLA LOH classification group.
(B) The number of clonal neoantigens is plotted across different categories of HLA LOH for lung adenocarcinoma (light blue) and lung squamous cell carcinomas
(magenta).
(C) The number of subclonal neoantigens is plotted across different categories of HLA LOH for lung adenocarcinoma (light blue) and lung squamous cell car-
cinomas (magenta).
(D) The number of subclonal non-synonymous mutations is plotted for tumor regions from tumors without any indication of HLA LOH, for tumor regions without
HLA LOH from a tumor with other regions harboring HLA LOH, and for tumor regions containing an HLA LOH event. All p values are calculated using an unpaired
wilcoxon test.
(E) Schematic of the clones considered for the comparison performed in Figure 4D. Here, the cancer subclone harboring HLA loss (purple) is shown with its sister
subclone, descended from the same ancestral cancer cell, but without HLA loss (green).
(F) For each lung adenocarcinoma (blue) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (purple) tumor, the relative contributions of APOBEC mutational signatures are
shown. p values are calculated using an unpaired wilcoxon test.
