Abstract
Although 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with early-life behavioral 
abnormalities, affected individuals are also at high risk for the development of schizophrenia 
symptoms, including psychosis, later in life. Auditory thalamocortical projections recently 
emerged as a neural circuit specifically disrupted in 22q11DS mouse models, in which 
haploinsufficiency of the microRNA-processing gene Dgcr8 resulted in the elevation of the 
dopamine receptor Drd2 in the auditory thalamus, an abnormal sensitivity of thalamocortical 
projections to antipsychotics, and an abnormal acoustic-startle response. Here we show that these 
auditory thalamocortical phenotypes have a delayed onset in 22q11DS mouse models and are 
associated with an age-dependent reduction of the microRNA miR-338-3p, which targets Drd2 
and is enriched in the thalamus of both humans and mice. Replenishing depleted miR-338-3p in 
mature 22q11DS mice rescued the thalamocortical abnormalities, and miR-338-3p deletion/
knockdown mimicked thalamocortical and behavioral deficits and eliminated their age 
dependence. Therefore, miR-338-3p depletion is necessary and sufficient to disrupt auditory 
thalamocortical signaling in 22q11DS mouse models and may mediate the pathogenic mechanism 
of 22q11DS-related psychosis and control its late onset.

 Introduction
Thalamocortical (TC) projections to the auditory cortex (ACx), a brain region implicated in 
auditory hallucinations1–4, have emerged as a circuit specifically disrupted5 in mouse 
models of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS)6. This disorder, the most common 
microdeletion syndrome in humans7, 8, is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion (1.5–3 Mb) 
on the long arm of chromosome 229. The 22q11DS is considered a leading genetic cause of 
schizophrenia10–12. Schizophrenia develops in 23% to 43% of individuals with 
22q11DS13–18, most of whom experience psychosis19, 20. Furthermore, 30% to 50% of 
nonschizophrenic individuals with 22q11DS demonstrate subthreshold symptoms of 
psychosis21. Nonpsychotic behavioral abnormalities are present from early life in patients 
with 22q11DS22, 23, but psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia are delayed; the median age 
of psychosis onset is 21 years18, 24, 25. In schizophrenic patients, auditory hallucinations and 
other psychotic symptoms are similarly delayed until late adolescence or early 
adulthood26, 27, are present in 60% to 90% of cases28, and are often alleviated by 
antipsychotics that inhibit D2 dopamine receptors (DRD2s)29, 30. Given the germline 
occurrence of deleted genes in 22q11DS, it is unclear why the onset of positive symptoms is 
delayed.
Recently, Dgcr8 emerged as a culprit gene responsible for several neuronal phenotypes in 
mouse models of 22q11DS31, 32, including the disruption of synaptic transmission at TC 
projections to the ACx5. Dgcr8 is part of the microprocessor complex that mediates the 
biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of 
complementary mRNAs and protein translation33. Dgcr8 haploinsufficiency in 22q11DS 
leads to depletion of miRNAs and the resultant upregulation of respective targets, which in 
turn disrupts synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and proper functioning of neural 
circuits34. In adult 22q11DS mouse models, Dgcr8 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to 
upregulate Drd2 mRNA and protein in the auditory thalamus, causing auditory abnormalities 
that include decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission at TC projections to the ACx and 
deficient prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic-startle response5. Abnormally high levels 
of Drd2 in the thalamus of 22q11DS mice increase TC projection sensitivity to Drd2 
antagonists, including antipsychotics. As a consequence, auditory synaptic and behavioral 
abnormalities of 22q11DS mice are rescued by antipsychotics5.
Here we tested whether TC disruption follows the same age-dependent trajectory as 
psychosis in patients with 22q11DS or schizophrenia and determined the molecular 
underpinnings of TC disruption in 22q11DS mice.
Results
Delayed disruption of TC synaptic transmission in 22q11DS models
We compared basal synaptic transmission in young (2-month-old) and mature (4-month-old) 
Df(16)1/+ mice, a murine model of 22q11DS6 (Fig. 1a), and their wild-type (WT) 
littermates. Mice between the age of 3 and 6 months correspond to mature human adults 
between the age of 20 and 30 years35. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we 
measured TC excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from thalamorecipient ACx cortical

 layer (L) 3/4 pyramidal neurons36, while stimulating TC projections in acute brain slices 
containing the auditory thalamus (i.e., the ventral part of the medial geniculate nuclei 
[MGv]) and the ACx (Fig. 1b). The input–output relationship between stimulation intensity 
and TC EPSC, a measure of basal synaptic transmission at TC projections, was deficient in 
older but not younger mutant mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 1c,d). Consistent with the 
notion that the Drd2 elevation in thalamic-relay neurons reduces glutamatergic synaptic 
transmission at auditory TC projections in Df(16)1/+ mice5, the Drd2 mRNA level was 
elevated in the MGv of older but not younger Df(16)1/+ mice (Fig. 1e).
Elevated Drd2 levels in older Df(16)1/+ mice mediate the abnormal sensitivity of mutant TC 
projections to antipsychotics; thus, we tested the time course of this sensitivity at different 
ages (1.5–7 months). In brief, we stimulated the thalamic radiation of WT mice to evoke TC 
EPSCs with a rise slope of approximately 100 pA/ms. We compared the effect of the 
antipsychotic agent haloperidol on TC EPSC 30 min after its bath application (1 μM) to the 
preapplication baseline TC EPSC (ΔH, a measure of haloperidol sensitivity). We determined 
that ΔH was significantly higher in Df(16)1/+ mice than in WT littermates but only 
beginning at 3 months of age (Fig. 1f–h). In older mice, a similar intensity of thalamic 
stimulation (see Online Methods) evoked substantially smaller TC EPSCs in Df(16)1/+ mice 
compared to WT controls, and haloperidol rescued that deficit (Fig. 1g). In contrast, TC 
projections in younger mutant mice were not sensitive to haloperidol (Fig. 1f,h).
Consistent with the notion that Dgcr8 underlies the TC deficiency in 22q11DS5, TC 
projections in Dgcr8+/− mice older than 3 months were sensitive to haloperidol, while those 
in WT mice were not. TC projections in younger mice were not sensitive to haloperidol (Fig. 
1i–k). Drd2 mRNA levels were also elevated in the thalamus of only the older Dgcr8+/− 
mice (Fig. 1l). Furthermore, PPI, a measure of sensorimotor gating that is typically reduced 
in schizophrenic patients37, 38, was deficient in older but not younger Dgcr8+/− mice (Fig. 
1m,n).
miR-338-3p mediates the disruption of TC synaptic transmission in 22q11DS
Because Dgcr8 mediates miRNA processing33, we sought to identify the miRNA(s) 
mediating the Dgcr8–Drd2 mechanism of TC deficiency. To this end, we performed miRNA 
microarray analysis of the auditory thalamus of 2- and 4-month-old mice (Table S1). Among 
the miRNAs that potentially target the Drd2 transcript (based on miRWalk and Exiqon 
miRNA target–prediction algorithms), only five miRNAs (miR-337-3p, miR-337-5p, 
miR-335-5p, miR-335-3p, and miR-338-3p) were depleted in the auditory thalamus of 
Df(16)1/+ or Dgcr8+/− mice (Fig. 2a–d). Because miR-185, which is not a Drd2-targeting 
miRNA, is encoded within the Df(16)1 microdeletion, its depletion in Df(16)1/+ mice 
served as a positive control (Fig. 2a,b). The qRT-PCR analysis verified that all five Drd2-
targeting miRNAs were depleted in Dgcr8+/− mice (Fig. S1a). The expression of miRNAs 
decreased with age, regardless of genotype. The miRNA levels in older mice were lower 
than those in young WT or Dgcr8+/− mice. However, because Dgcr8 haploinsufficiency 
depleted these miRNAs at both ages, the age-dependent decline in miRNA expression was 
exacerbated in mutants and reached minimal values at 4 months in Dgcr8+/− mice (Fig. S1a). 
Of the five miRNAs predicted to target Drd2 overexpression, miR-337-3p, miR-337-5p,

 miR-335-3p, and miR-338-3p but not miR-335-5p decreased DRD2 mRNA in vitro in 
human SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. S1b).
To identify which miRNA(s) targeting the Drd2 3′UTR (Fig. 2e) regulates the Dgcr8–Drd2 
mechanism of TC deficiency in vivo, we performed a screen based on the abnormal 
sensitivity of TC projections to haloperidol. We overexpressed mature miRNAs in excitatory 
thalamic neurons by injecting adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding GFP with 
miR-337-5p, miR-338-3p, miR-335-5p, miR-337-3p, or miR-335-3p, under the control of 
excitatory neuron–specific promoter CamKIIα into the MGv of Df(16)1/+ and WT mice 
(Fig. 2f,g). Overexpression of individual miRNAs in 4-month-old Df(16)1/+ mice not only 
replenished the depleted miRNA levels but also elevated them beyond those in WT mice 
(Fig. S2a–e). However, of the five miRNAs, only miR-338-3p overexpression rescued the 
abnormal haloperidol sensitivity in Df(16)1/+ mice (Figs. 2h, S2f–k). Overexpression of 
miR-338-3p in the MGv of Df(16)1/+ mice decreased Drd2 mRNA levels in the MGv by 
47.6% ± 10.2% compared to the control virus (n = 6 mice for AAV-GFP-miR-338-3p and 6 
mice for AAV-GFP; p <0.01), confirming that miR-338-3p regulates Drd2 levels.
The miR-338-3p, miR-335-3p, and miR-335-5p have conserved seed sites in the mouse and 
human Drd2 3′UTR. Consistent with the notion that only abundant miRNAs effectively 
regulate the targeting transcript(s)39, miR-338-3p appeared to be more crucial for Drd2 
regulation in the auditory thalamus than did miR-337-5p, miR-335-5p, miR-337-3p, or 
miR-335-3p. Indeed, miR-338-3p was enriched in the thalamus compared to the other four 
miRNAs; miR-337-3p, miR-335-5p, miR-337-3p, and miR-335-3p levels were 
approximately 0% to 1% that of miR-338-3p (Fig. 2i). Moreover, miR-338-3p was enriched 
in the thalamus compared to other tested brain regions (Fig. 2i), suggesting that depletion of 
this Drd2-regulating miRNA in 22q11DS mainly affects thalamic function. Similarly, 
miR-338-3p was enriched in the MGv compared to the ACx (Brodmann area 41) in 
postmortem tissue samples from human subjects (n=7 for the MGv and n=8 for the ACx, 
p<0.001) (Fig. 2j and Table S2). Moreover, miR-338-3p was significantly decreased in the 
thalamus but not the ACx of schizophrenic patients compared to that in age- and sex-
matched controls (Fig. 2j). We previously showed that the DRD2 protein level is elevated in 
MGv samples5.
Replenishing miR-338-3p in the MGv rescues the TC deficits of synaptic transmission and 
presynaptic function in 22q11DS mice
To rescue the disruption of TC synaptic transmission in Df(16)1/+ mice, we replenished 
miR-338-3p in the thalamic-relay neurons by injecting AAV-GFP-miR-338-3p into the MGv 
in vivo using an approach similar to that used in previous experiments (Fig. 2h); AAV-GFP 
was used as a control (Fig. 3a). Three to 4 weeks later, AAV infection yielded a robust 
expression of GFP in the MGv neurons, and the GFP-labeled projections were clearly 
visible in the L3/4 thalamorecipient layer of the ACx (Fig. 3b). We recorded the input–
output relations at TC projections in 4- to 5-month-old WT and Df(16)1/+ mice injected 
with either AAV-GFP-miR-338-3p or AAV-GFP. As in previous experiments5 (Fig. 1d), we 
observed a substantial deficit in TC synaptic transmission between WT and Df(16)/1+ mice 
injected with AAV-GFP. WT mice injected with AAV-GFP-miR-338-3p did not show a

 significant increase in synaptic transmission compared to controls. However, the TC 
synaptic transmission deficit was rescued in Df(16)1/+ mice injected with AAV-GFP-
miR-338-3p (Fig. 3c). Similarly, the presynaptic TC deficit observed in Df(16)1/+ mice5 
was rescued by replenishing miR-338-3p. Injections of AAV-GFP-miR-338-3p but not AAV-
GFP into the MGv rescued a deficient paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of two consecutive TC 
EPSCs in Df(16)1/+ mice without affecting TC PPR in WT mice at all measured interpulse 
intervals (Fig. 3d). These results indicate that depletion of miR-338-3p is a necessary 
component for developing TC deficits in 22q11DS mouse models.
miR-338 depletion in the MGv or miR-338–knockout recapitulates the auditory TC synaptic 
abnormalities of 22q11DS mice
To test whether miR-338-3p depletion is sufficient to trigger TC deficits, we employed two 
strategies. First, we constructed an miR-338-3p sponge by using a previously described 
strategy40. Second, we generated miR-338–knockout (KO) mice (Fig. 4d). The miR-338-3p 
sponge efficiency was verified in an in vitro system by using the luciferase assay. The 
sponge with 12 seed sites substantially and specifically depleted miR-338-3p levels in vitro 
(Fig. S3). On the basis of these data, we constructed AAVs expressing either the miR-338-3p 
sponge or a scrambled control vector under the control of the CamKIIα promoter (Fig. 4a). 
An AAV expressing the miR-338-3p sponge injected into the MGv of WT mice was 
sufficient to increase Drd2 mRNA (Fig. 4b) and render the TC projections sensitive to 
haloperidol (Fig. 4c).
We then generated a mutant mouse lacking miR-338 (miR-338 KO mice) (Fig. 4d). The 
locus of miR-338 is within the seventh intron of the apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase 
(Aatk) gene. However, unlike miR-338-3p, Aatk expression in the MGv was not affected by 
age or miR-338 deletion (Fig. S4a,b). The miR-338 KO mice lacked miR-338-3p, 
miR-338-5p, and miR-3065 (both -3p and -5p species), whose genomic loci overlap with 
that of miR-338. However, miR-338-5p, miR-3065-3p, and miR-3065-5p were not Drd2-
targeting miRNAs, as predicted by the microRNA target–prediction algorithms, and their 
expression levels in the auditory thalamus were 0% to 2.5% that of miR-338-3p (Fig. S4c). 
The miR-338+/− or miR-338−/− mice developed normally (Fig. S4d,e). Their Drd2 RNA 
levels were inversely correlated with miR-338-3p levels in the auditory thalamus (Fig. 4e). 
Moreover, Drd2 protein levels were elevated in the MGv but not in the cortex or 
hippocampus of miR-338+/− or miR-338−/− mice (Fig. 4f), further indicating that 
miR-338-3p regulates Drd2 expression in the auditory thalamus.
Because miR-338-3p is depleted but not eliminated in Df(16)1/+ mice, we tested TC 
synaptic properties in 4-month-old miR-338+/− mice. Like that in Df(16)1/+ mice5, synaptic 
transmission at TC projections was substantially disrupted in miR-338+/− mice. The input–
output function, which we tested by electrical stimulation of TC projections, showed a 
decrease in TC EPSCs in miR-338+/− mice compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 4g,h). This 
disruption was specific to TC projections. The input–output function tested by electrical 
stimulation of corticocortical (CC) projections in the same slices did not differ between 
miR-338+/− and WT mice (Fig. 4i). The PPR of two consecutive electrically evoked EPSCs 
was substantially altered in TC but not CC projections of miR-338+/− mice compared to that

 in WT controls (Fig. 4j,k). In contrast, the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio (a measure of the 
postsynaptic function) was normal in both TC and CC projections of miR-338+/− mice (Fig. 
4l,m). Because electrical stimulation of the thalamic radiation may affect circuits other than 
TC projections41, we activated TC projections more selectively using the optogenetic 
approach. To that end, we injected AAVs expressing ChR2 under the control of CamKIIα 
into the MGv of miR-338+/− and WT littermates. We then activated TC projections by using 
473-nm light pulses (Fig. 4n). The input–output relations and PPR (but not the NMDAR/
AMPAR ratio) of optically evoked EPSCs were substantially decreased in 4-month-old 
miR-338+/− mice compared to that in WT littermates (Fig. 4o–q), which recapitulated the 
TC disruption in 22q11DS mouse models.
miR-338 haploinsufficiency disrupts TC transmission by decreasing the release probability 
of thalamic projections
We previously showed that the TC disruption of synaptic plasticity in 22q11DS mouse 
models was due to defective presynaptic function, which was in turn was caused by reduced 
probability of glutamate release from thalamic projections5. Abnormalities in the input–
output relation and PPR at TC projections of miR-338+/− mice also suggested a deficit in 
presynaptic function at TC glutamatergic synapses. To understand the nature of this deficit, 
we performed two-photon calcium imaging in dendritic spines, which are the inputs of 
thalamic projections onto thalamorecipient neurons in the ACx. We loaded L3/4 pyramidal 
neurons with the calcium indicator Fluo-5F and cytoplasmic dye Alexa 594 (Fig. 5a) and 
identified dendritic spines that responded to electrical stimulation of the thalamic radiation 
(Fig. 5b). This method enabled us to measure three factors that may contribute to the TC 
disruption: the distribution of synaptic inputs on dendritic trees of postsynaptic neurons, the 
amplitudes of calcium transients, and the probability of calcium transients at individual 
dendritic spines (a proxy for the probability of neurotransmitter release measured at a single 
synaptic input)42, 43. The distribution of active TC inputs on dendritic trees and the peak 
amplitudes of postsynaptic calcium transients in miR-338+/− mice were comparable to that 
in WT mice (Fig. 5c–e), suggesting that TC development, pathfinding, synaptic targeting of 
cortical neurons by TC projections, and postsynaptic glutamatergic receptor function were 
not compromised in miR-338+/− mice. Note that although this negative result shows the lack 
of a deficit in TC morphology, it does not rule out potential morphological deficits on a finer 
subsynaptic scale. Interestingly, the probability of calcium transients in dendritic spines of 
thalamorecipient neurons in response to a low-frequency (0.1 Hz) train of stimuli was 
deficient in miR-338+/− mice (Fig. 5f). This result indicates that the depletion of miR-338 
decreased the probability of glutamate release at TC projections, which underlies the TC 
disruption in 22q11DS. This deficit in the probability of glutamate release was rescued in 
slices treated with haloperidol (Fig. 5f). Haloperidol also effectively rescued the deficit in 
the probability of glutamate release in the same dendritic spine. The probability of detecting 
the calcium transient increased in miR-338+/− (but not WT) dendritic spines after 
haloperidol application (Fig. 5g,h). This finding further demonstrates that haloperidol 
rescues the presynaptic deficit of TC synaptic transmission in miR-338 KO mice.

 miR-338 depletion eliminates the age dependency of TC disruption and PPI
The deletion of miR-338 was sufficient to upregulate Drd2 in the thalamus, which suggested 
that depletion of only this miRNA underlies the abnormal sensitivity of TC projections in 
22q11DS to antipsychotics. To test this hypothesis, we compared the sensitivity of TC 
projections in miR-338+/− mice and WT mice. First, we determined that TC projections of 
miR-338+/− (but not WT) mice were sensitive to the Drd2-specific antagonist L-741,626 (20 
nM) (Fig. 6a). In miR-338+/− mice, TC EPSCs substantially increased in response to 
L-741,626, but that increase was not further elevated by haloperidol. Haloperidol alone 
increased TC EPSCs in 4-month-old miR-338+/− mice (but not in WT mice) to magnitudes 
similar to those observed in Df(16)1/+ or Dgcr8+/− mice, suggesting that haloperidol’s effect 
in mutant TC projections was mediated by elevated expression of Drd2 receptors (Figs. 6b, 
S5). Similarly, other antipsychotics (i.e., clozapine and olanzapine) increased TC EPSCs to 
similar magnitudes in miR-338+/− mice but not WT mice (Fig. S6).
Unlike Df(16)1/+ or Dgcr8+/− mice, miR-338+/− mice became sensitive to haloperidol in an 
age-independent manner (Figs. 6b, S5). Furthermore, in young (2-month-old) WT mice, TC 
projections became sensitive to haloperidol when the miR-338-3p sponge was expressed in 
the MGv (Fig. S7), indicating that depletion of miR-338-3p in the MGv is sufficient for 
sensitivity to antipsychotics. TC sensitivity to haloperidol in 2-month-old miR-338+/− mice 
was eliminated by expression of small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) against Drd2 (but not a 
control siRNA) in the MGv (Fig. 6c,d). The specificity of Drd2 siRNA has been 
characterized previously5. These experiments further indicate that miR-338-3p is sufficient 
to regulate Drd2 in the thalamus, regardless of age. Similarly, miR-338+/− mice were 
deficient in PPI compared to that in WT controls, and this deficit was observed at all tested 
time points (1.5, 2, and 4 months) (Fig. 6e–g). The defect in PPI was not caused by 
peripheral hearing defects because the acoustic brainstem-response testing showed no 
differences between miR-338+/− and WT mice at these ages (Fig. S8).
Discussion
The recent identification of disrupted glutamatergic synaptic transmission at thalamic inputs 
to the ACx in 22q11DS mice5 suggests that TC disruption could be a pathogenic mechanism 
that mediates the susceptibility to positive psychotic symptoms in 22q11DS-related 
schizophrenia for the following reasons: 1) TC disruption in 22q11DS mice is rescued by 
antipsychotic medications that are Drd2 antagonists and effectively treat predominantly 
psychotic symptoms but not cognitive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia44–46. This 
disruption was specific to auditory TC projections and not observed at other glutamatergic 
projections (i.e., hippocampal, corticocortical, or corticofugal projections) that may be 
involved in cognitive, social, or motivational tasks. 2) TC disruption in 22q11DS mice is 
caused by abnormal elevation of Drd2 mRNA and Drd2 protein levels in the TC neurons in 
the thalamus, a brain region previously linked to psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia47, 48. 
The increase in dopamine signaling in the thalamus was also described in schizophrenic 
patients49, and studies have indicated that drug-naïve schizophrenic patients have elevated 
levels of DRD2s in other brain regions50, 51. Furthermore, theoretical and empirical studies 
have proposed that deficient connectivity and abnormal patterns of activity in TC projections

 contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease52–55. Moreover, a local ischemic infarction that 
disrupts auditory TC projections in a nonpsychotic patient can cause auditory 
hallucinations56. 3) Sensitivity to antipsychotics is observed in the auditory but not the 
visual or somatosensory TC projections of 22q11DS mice, which is consistent with clinical 
observations of the substantially higher prevalence of auditory hallucinations, compared 
with that of hallucinations in other sensory modalities, in schizophrenia28. Neuroimaging 
and electrophysiological studies in schizophrenia patients have shown abnormal activation 
of the auditory thalamus and ACx during auditory hallucinations1, 3, 21. 4) Drd2 elevation 
only in the auditory thalamus of 22q11DS mice was sufficient to reduce the PPI of the 
acoustic startle response5, the behavioral endophenotype characteristic of patients with one 
of several psychiatric diseases, including 22q11DS and schizophrenia38, 57.
Here we showed that the disruption of synaptic transmission at auditory TC projections 
recapitulates another prominent feature of psychotic symptoms. The TC disruption in 
22q11DS mice becomes evident only after 3 months of age, which is equivalent to the age of 
approximately 20 years in humans35. These data correspond well with the onset of clinical 
manifestations of psychosis in patients with 22q11DS (median age, 21 years25) or 
schizophrenia during late adolescence or early adulthood, typically between the ages of 16 
and 30 years26, 58. This age-dependent TC decrease in synaptic function is evident in 
Df(16)1/+ mice, which carry a large microdeletion, and in Dgcr8+/− mice, further 
strengthening the case that Dgcr8 is the culprit gene, and its haploinsufficiency underlies 
auditory abnormalities in 22q11DS.
Previous work established that the deletion of one copy of Dgcr8 leads to the elevation of 
Drd2 in the auditory thalamus5. Because Dgcr8 is part of the miRNA-processing machinery, 
we hypothesized that a Dgcr8–miRNA–Drd2 mechanism underlies the disruption of TC 
synaptic transmission. Here we identified miR-338-3p as the mediator of this mechanism 
(Fig. 6h). We also showed that miR-338-3p negatively regulates the level of Drd2 in the 
thalamus. Replenishing miR-338-3p in the thalamus eliminates deficient TC synaptic 
transmission and abnormal antipsychotic sensitivity of TC projections in 22q11DS mice, and 
the deletion or auditory thalamus–specific knockdown of miR-338-3p mimics TC disruption 
of synaptic transmission and antipsychotic sensitivity in WT mice. Depletion of miR-338-3p 
is therefore necessary and sufficient to upregulate Drd2 in the thalamus, which in turn, 
reduces glutamate release from thalamic projections, reduces TC synaptic transmission, and 
renders TC projections sensitive to antipsychotics (Fig. 6h). Because miR-338-3p is 
enriched in the auditory thalamus and more abundant miRNAs more effectively regulate the 
targeting transcripts39, miR-338-3p reduction in the thalamus (but not in tissues where it is 
weakly expressed) would upregulate Drd2 and provide tissue specificity.
TC disruption in 22q11DS mice and miR-338-deficient mice correlates with deficits in PPI, 
an impaired sensorimotor gating feature that occurs in schizophrenia and several other 
neuropsychiatric disorders. The importance of the auditory thalamus for PPI is well 
known59, but the effect of disrupting TC projections on PPI deficits is not. Therefore, other 
projections emanating from the auditory thalamus and containing depleted miR-338-3p and 
upregulated Drd2 might cause PPI deficits in 22q11DS mice.

 One copy of Dgcr8 is deleted in 22q11DS, in all cells at all ages, so it is unclear why 
synaptic disruption occurs in projections emanating only from the thalamus and only later in 
life. The regional specificity most likely arises from the fact that miR-338-3p is substantially 
enriched in the auditory thalamus compared to other brain regions, such as the cortex or 
hippocampus. Explaining why miR-338-3p is thalamus-enriched will require further 
investigation. We also determined that the expression of miR-338-3p is regulated in an age-
dependent manner. Although miR-338-3p is depleted in the auditory thalamus in 22q11DS 
mice at all ages, compared to WT mice, it declines further with age in both 22q11DS and 
WT mice. Therefore, miR-338-3p expression may be controlled by a combination of Dgcr8- 
and age-dependent mechanisms. Although we can assume that Dgcr8 haploinsufficiency 
reduced the levels of miRNAs, the mechanism of age-dependent miRNA decline is 
unknown. In the context of Drd2 regulation, a minimal threshold of miR-338-3p expression 
probably triggers the overexpression of Drd2. In WT mice, miR-338-3p declines during the 
first few months of life, but it may not reach that threshold. However, in 22q11DS mice, 
Dgcr8 haploinsufficiency and age-dependent decline in miRNA production drives the 
miR-338-3p level below this threshold, triggers the elevation of Drd2 in the thalamus, and 
causes TC synaptic and behavioral deficiencies.
In summary, our data implicate thalamus-enriched miR-338-3p as the key mediator of 
disruption of synaptic transmission at TC projections and late onset of auditory symptoms of 
22q11DS. Our data also suggest that replenishment of miR-338-3p in the thalamus could be 
a more tolerable therapeutic approach for positive symptoms. Current therapy relies upon 
antipsychotics to alleviate psychosis in schizophrenic patients through systemic inhibition of 
DRD2, which is accompanied by multiple, and sometimes devastating, side effects27, 60. 
Given that the seed sites of miR-338-3p are conserved between humans and mice, 
miR-338-3p is enriched in the thalamus of both species and becomes depleted in the 
thalamus of mouse models of 22q11DS and schizophrenic patients, this strategy is 
potentially applicable to patients. Thus, our results suggest that miR-338-3p is a potential 
therapeutic target for treating positive symptoms of 22q11DS and related cases of 
schizophrenia.
Online Methods
Animals
Mice of both sexes were used for all experiments. Df(16)1/+ and Dgcr8+/− mouse strains 
were reported previously6, 31 and were back-crossed onto the C57BL/6J genetic background 
for at least 10 generations. Mice ranging in age from 1.5 to 7 months were used, which 
approximately corresponds to 13 to 35 years in humans35 (https://www.jax.org/research-and-
faculty/research-labs/the-harrison-lab/gerontology/life-span-as-a-biomarker). The 
miR-338+/− and miR-338−/− mice were generated from embryonic stem cells from 
C57BL/6N-Atm1Brd mice that were purchased from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource 
Center (MMRRC; clone #034476-UCD). These cells were tested and found negative for 
mycoplasma contamination. C57BL/6 blastocyst injections were performed by the 
Transgenic/Gene Knockout Shared Resource at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. 
Jude). Chimeric mice were genotyped according to MMRRC protocols by using the

 following primers: 5′ common reverse (ATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATCACTGG), 5′ 
gene-specific (CTTCACTACACTCTCCCTAGTACAGTCTC), 3′ common forward 
(TCTAGAAAGTATAGGAACTTCCATGGTC), and 3′ gene-specific 
(AGGAGACTCATAGTTCTCTGTATCATAGC). PCR was performed under the following 
conditions: 93 °C for 3 min, 93 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 9 min for 8 cycles and then 93 °C 
for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 9 min for 32 cycles. The mutant allele generated a 
6.1-kb band with 5′ common-reverse and 5′ gene-specific primers and a 4.1-kb band with 
3′ common-forward and 3′ gene-specific primers. The wild-type (WT) allele did not 
generate a band with either primer set. Subsequent genotyping was performed at Transnetyx 
(Cordova, TN). For the majority of experiments, mice were divided into groups according to 
genotype or viral injections, and the experimenters were blinded to the genotype or 
treatment. The care and use of animals were reviewed and approved by the St. Jude 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Whole-Cell Electrophysiology
Acute primary thalamocortical (TC) slices (400-μm thick) containing the left auditory cortex 
(ACx) and the left ventral part of the medial geniculate nuclei (MGv) of the thalamus were 
prepared as previously described5, 61. Briefly, mouse brains were quickly removed and 
placed in cold (4 °C) dissecting artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 125 mM 
choline-Cl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 6 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM 
NaHCO3, and 20 mM glucose (300–310 mOsm), with 95% O2/5% CO2. Primary TC slices 
were obtained from the left hemisphere by using a slicing angle of 15°. After a 1-h 
incubation in ACSF [125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM 
NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM glucose (300–310 mOsm), with 95% O2/5% CO2] at 
room temperature, the slices were transferred into the recording chamber and superfused (2–
3 mL/min) with warm (30–32 °C) ACSF.
Whole-cell recordings were obtained from cell bodies of layer (L) 3/4 thalamorecipient 
neurons in the ACx and thalamic-relay neurons in the MGv. Mice were chosen in a 
pseudorandom order, without the experimenter’s prior knowledge of genotype or treatments. 
Patch pipettes (open-pipette resistance, 3.5–5 MΩ) were filled with an internal solution 
containing 125 mM CsMeSO3, 2 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgATP, 
0.3 mM NaGTP, 10 mM Na2 creatine phosphate, 5 mM QX-314, 5 mM 
tetraethylammonium Cl (pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH, 290–295 mOsm). Voltage-clamp 
recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B, digitized (10 kHz), and recorded using the 
pCLAMP 10.0 software. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded at holding 
membrane potentials of –70 mV. In all experiments, membrane potentials were corrected for 
a liquid junction potential of –10 mV. TC EPSCs were evoked by current pulses (duration, 
100 μs) delivered to the thalamic radiation via tungsten bipolar electrodes. The stimulation 
intensities were similar in experiments in Fig. 1f–g (2 months: 527 ± 61 μA, 19 neurons in 
WT and 568 ± 50 μA, 21 neurons in Df(16)/+ mice; p >0.05; 4 months: 523 ± 42 μA, 31 
neurons in WT and 550 ± 39 μA, 30 neurons in Df(16)/+ mice; p >0.05) and Fig. 1i–j (2 
months: 569 ± 44 μA, 16 neurons in WT and 582 ± 37 μA, 24 neurons in Dgcr8+/− mice; p 
>0.05; 4 months: 543 ± 43 μA, 36 neurons in WT and 551 ± 43 μA, 37 neurons in Dgcr8+/− 
mice; p >0.05).

 Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of TC and corticocortical (CC) EPSCs and the NMDAR/AMPAR 
ratio were measured as described previously5. The first 2 ms of the EPSC slope were 
measured as an accurate indicator of monosynaptic strength at TC synapses62. Changes in 
the EPSC slope correlated with changes in the EPSC amplitude and EPSC charge5. To 
ensure consistent access resistance of the recording electrode during long-term experiments, 
we monitored the peak amplitude of a brief (10-ms) hyperpolarizing test pulse (–5 mV), 
which was given 250 ms after a stimulus. Access resistance in recorded neurons was 
typically 10 to 25 MΩ. Recordings were discarded if the access resistance was higher than 
25 MΩ, or if it changed more than 15% during the course of the whole-cell recording.
Two-Photon Imaging
Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy was performed using an Ultima imaging system, a 
Ti:sapphire Chameleon Ultra femtosecond-pulsed laser, and 60× (0.9 NA) water-immersion 
infrared objectives. Synaptically evoked calcium transients were measured in dendritic 
spines, the site of thalamic inputs, as described previously43. Briefly, Alexa Fluor 594 (30 
μM) and Fluo-5F (300 μM) were included in the internal pipette solution (see above) and 
were excited at 820 nm. Synaptically evoked changes in fluorescence of both fluorophores 
were measured in the line-scan mode (750 Hz) in spine heads and the parent dendritic shaft. 
Line scans were analyzed as changes in green (G, Fluo-5F) fluorescence normalized to red 
(R, Alexa Fluor 594) fluorescence (ΔG/R). The amplitude and probability of calcium 
transients were measured in response to 10 to 20 stimulations delivered at 0.1 Hz to the 
thalamic radiation. Distance (angular) of the active thalamic inputs from the center of the 
soma was calculated using maximum-intensity projections of z-scan images of the entire cell 
collected at lower magnification.
Optogenetics
In optogenetic experiments, we expressed the light-activated cation channel ChR2 in the 
MGv by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) and evoked optically induced EPSCs by briefly 
illuminating TC slices with a 473-nm light63. AAVs were generated from the pAAV-
CaMKIIα-hChR2(H134R)-YFP-WPRE-pA (CamKIIα-ChR2-YFP) plasmid and produced 
commercially (UNC Vector; serotype 2/1; 4×1012 IFU/mL). AAVs were injected into the 
MGv as described previously41. Adult mice were anesthetized with isoflurane in pure 
oxygen, and a 200- to 400-nL sample of virus was slowly pressure-injected into the MGv 
(from the bregma: anterior-posterior, –3.0 mm; medial-lateral, ± 2.0 mm; dorsal-ventral, 3.1 
mm). Approximately 21 to 28 days after virus injection, the mice were decapitated, and TC 
slices were prepared. Confocal imaging of YFP in the MGv was used to verify on-target 
infection of CamKIIα-ChR2-YFP viruses. Short light pulses (10–200 mW) from a 473-nm 
laser were directed to the slices through the visible light photoactivation module or through 
the objective.
miRNA Microarray
Total RNA was isolated from 2- and 4-month-old male WT, Df(16)1/+, and Dgcr8+/− 
thalami containing MGv by using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA). Total RNAs (100 ng) were labeled using miRNA Complete Labeling and 
Hyb Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), followed by hybridizing to the Mouse miRNA v19

 Microarray (Agilent-046065) that contains 3105 unique probes targeting 1247 mature 
miRNAs, according to the mouse miRBase version 19.0 (www.mirbase.org; August 2012). 
Microarrays were scanned using an Agilent array scanner (G2565CA) at 3-μm resolution. 
Microarray data were extracted by Agilent Feature Extraction software (v.10.5.1.1) using the 
miRNA_107_Sep09 protocol. The data process was performed using Partek software (St. 
Louis, MO).
After quantile normalization among arrays, each probe was summarized by averaging 
intensities with a single normalized intensity value. The Student’s t-test was used to 
determine statistical significance between sets of replicates from different experimental 
groups. The miRNA was considered significantly differentially expressed when the p-value 
was less than 0.01 for more than one probe targeting the mature form of the miRNA. The 
mRNAs targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using bioinformatics 
tools miRWalk64 and TargetScan (www.targetscan.org).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from various brain regions (i.e., the auditory thalamus containing 
the MGv, hippocampus, or cortex) or from SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC, CRL-2266) by using the 
mirVana RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies). The iScript kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) 
was used to synthesize cDNA from mRNA, and the miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis 
Kit (Agilent) was used to synthesize cDNA from miRNA. The experiments were performed 
using SYBR Green (Life Technologies). The following forward primers were used for 
miRNA analysis: mmu-miR-338-3p and hsa-miR-338-3p 
(TCCAGCATCAGTGATTTTGTTG), mmu-miR-335-3p 
(TTTTTCATTATTGCTCCTGACC), mmu-miR-335-5p 
(TCAAGAGCAATAACGAAAAATGT), mmu-miR-337-3p 
(TCAGCTCCTATATGATGCCTTT), mmu-miR-337-5p 
(CGGCGTCATGCAGGAGTTGATT), mmu-miR-3065-5p 
(TCAACAAAATCACTGATGCTGG), and mmu-miR-3065-3p 
(TCAGCACCAGGATATTGTTGGGG). The universal reverse-primer specific to the 
sequence tag (miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit) was used. The following primers 
were used for mRNA analysis: Drd2 forward (GGATGTCATGATGTGCACAGC), Drd2 
reverse (CGCTTGCGGAGAACGATG), Aatk forward (ATGCTGGCCTGCCTGTGTTGT), 
and Aatk reverse (AGGGGCAGGACATACACATCGG). The following loading controls 
were used: U6 snRNA forward (CGCTTCGGCAGCACATATAC), U6 snRNA reverse 
(TTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT) (the same primers were used for mouse and human 
samples), SnoRNA202 (CTTTTGAACCCTTTTCCATCTG), and SnoRNA234 
(TTAACAAAAATTCGTCACTACCA). The same universal reverse primer was used for 
SnoRNA202 and SnoRNA234. To measure DRD2 mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells, the 
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) method was used to transfect these cells with pGIPZ 
plasmids (Open Biosystems) containing an miRNA of interest or an empty vector (control). 
The following primers were used to clone hsa-miR-337-3p and hsa-miR-337-5p into the 
pGIPZ plasmid: hsa-miR-337-3p-1 
(TCGAGGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGACCTCCTATATGATGCCTTTCTTCTGTGAA); hsa-

cloning hsa-miR-335-3p, hsa-miR-335-5p, and hsa-miR-338-3p (all three are conserved 
between mice and humans), the primers given below were used. The following primers were 
used in SH-SY5Y cells: DRD2 forward (GAGTGGAAATTCAGCAGGATTC); DRD2 
reverse (GAAGGACAGGACCCAGACGATG); turboGFP forward 
(CTTCAGCTACCGCTACGAGG); and turboGFP reverse 
(GCTCTTGAAGTGCATGTGGC). DRD2 levels were normalized to turboGFP. Samples 
from each mouse or each well containing SH-SY5Y cells were run in triplicate.
Western blotting
Mouse brain tissues were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1% 
NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) that included 
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets. A total of 25 μg (MGv) or 30 μg (cortex, hippocampus) 
protein was loaded per lane. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blotting were 
performed using standard techniques. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit 
anti-DRD2 (Abcam, ab85367; 1:500) and mouse anti– β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A5316, 
1:10,000). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-rabbit (LI-COR Biosciences, 
926-68021; 1:15000) and anti-mouse (LI-COR Biosciences, 926-32212, 1:15000) antibodies 
conjugated to IR dye 680 or 800, respectively. Blots were imaged and quantified using the 
Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system. Samples from each mouse were run in triplicate.
Human brain tissue
Postmortem samples of human MGv and ACx (Brodmann area 41) were obtained from The 
Maryland Brain Collection (Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, University of Maryland 
School of Medicine, Catonsville, MD). We tested the level of mature miR-338-3p in patients 
with schizophrenia and age-, race-, and sex-matched healthy controls. Only samples with 
RNA integrity number higher than 7 were used in these experiments (Agilent RNA 6000 
Nano kit). The mean postmortem interval was 15.3 ± 2.0 h for patients with schizophrenia 
and 17.2 ± 1.6 h (p>0.05) for healthy controls. Quantitative RT-PCR for each brain tissue 
sample was run in triplicate.

 St. Jude Vector Development & Production Core and injected into the MGvs of anesthetized 
mice, as described previously5.
In the luciferase assay, multiple copies of the miR-338-3p sponge and scramble control were 
cloned into 3′-UTR of Renilla luciferase gene contained within the psiCHECK-2 vector 
(Promega). To test the effect of the sponge in cells, the plasmids were transfected into HEK 
293T (ATCC, CCL-3216) or Neuro 2a (ATCC, CCL-131) cells along with control 
pcDNA3.1 or primary miR-338, miR-337, miR-335, and irrelevant miR-185–overexpressing 
plasmids. The cell lines were not authenticated or tested for mycoplasma. After 2 days in 
culture, Renilla and Firefly activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay 
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Renilla luciferase expression 
was normalized to Firefly luciferase expression as a readout.
Mouse Behavioral Tests
Prepulse inhibition (PPI) experiments were performed as previously described5. Briefly, 
each day before testing, the mice were transported from the animal-housing room and 
allowed a 1-h habituation period in the testing room. Before experiments were initiated, the 
mice had a 20-min acclimation period in the Plexiglas restraint chamber (6 cm × 6 cm × 4.8 
cm). The mice then had a 5-min acclimation period to 65-dB background white noise, which 
played throughout the session. For PPI experiments, 3 acoustic startles [white noise (1–20 
kHz), 120 dB, 40 ms] were delivered, separated by a 15-s intertrial interval. The testing 
session consisted of the following trials: pulse-alone, in which the startle pulse was 
presented; the combination of a 40-ms white-noise prepulse (74 dB, 82 dB, or 90 dB) in WT 
and Dgcr8+/− littermates and (70 dB, 80 dB, or 90 dB) in WT and miR-338+/− littermates 
and preceding the startle pulse by 100 ms, and no stimuli. Trials were separated by 15 s and 
presented in a pseudo-random order. PPI was calculated as follows: 100 × (pulse-alone 
response – prepulse + pulse response)/pulse-alone response.
Auditory brainstem response (ABR) experiments were performed as previously described68. 
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Avertin (0.6 mg/g bodyweight, i.p.), and ABR was 
measured using a Tucker Davis Technology (TDT) System III with RZ6 Multiprocessor and 
BioSigRZ software. Sounds were delivered via the MF-1 speaker in the open-field 
configuration. ABR waveforms were recorded using subdermal needles placed at the vertex 
of the skull, below the pinna of the ear, and at the base of the tail. The needles were 
connected to a low-impedance headstage (RA4LI, TDT) and fed into the RZ6 
multiprocessor through a preamplifier (RA4PA, Gain 20×, TDT). ABR waveforms were 
averaged from 500 presentations of a tone (21 tones/s) in the alternating phase and were 
band-pass filtered (300 Hz-3 kHz). The ABR threshold was defined as the minimum sound 
intensity that elicited a wave above the noise level. All ABR experiments were conducted in 
a sound booth (Industrial Acoustic Company, IAC, Model 120A double wall).
Statistical Analyses
All statistical data were computed using the Sigma Plot 12.5 software. Parametric or 
nonparametric tests were chosen based on the normality and variance of data distribution.

 Fig. 5. Probability of glutamate release is reduced at TC projections of miR-338+/− mice
(a) An L3/4 pyramidal neuron filled with Fluo-5F and Alexa 594 through a patch pipette 
(left; scale bar, 10 μm) to visualize synaptically evoked calcium transients inside dendritic 
spines (right; scale bar, 1μm). Yellow line represents the line scan. (b) Calcium transients in 
a dendritic spine in response to a single thalamic stimulation (arrows) repeated 10 times at 
0.05–0.1 Hz. Scale bar, 0.1 ΔG/R, 200 ms. (c) Location of active TC inputs on dendritic 
trees of L3/4 pyramidal neurons spines. (0;0), soma coordinates (apical dendrites pointing 
upwards). (d–f) Average distances from the soma to active TC inputs (d), calcium transient 
peak amplitudes (e), and probabilities (f) in response to 10 to 20 single TC stimulations in 
WT and miR-338+/− slices not treated (WT: 27 spines; miR-338+/−: 32 spines) or treated

 Fig. 6. Deletion of miR-338 in mice eliminates age dependency for antipsychotics sensitivity and 
replicates 22q11DS phenotypes
(a) Average TC EPSCs before (1) and during (2–3) application of the Drd2-specific inhibitor 
L-741,626 and haloperidol in 4-month-old WT (6 neurons) and miR-338+/− mice (9 
neurons). (b) Mean haloperidol sensitivity (ΔH) in WT (10, 7, 6 neurons at 1.5, 2, and 4 
months, respectively) and miR-338+/− mice (12 neurons at each age) between 1.5 and 4 
months of age. *p <0.001 (two-tailed t-test). (c, d) Mean TC EPSCs before (1) and after (2) 
haloperidol in 2-month-old WT (10 control siRNA neurons and 9 Drd2 siRNA neurons) and 
miR-338+/− mice (14 control siRNA neurons and 10 Drd2 siRNA neurons) that received 
control (c) or Drd2 siRNA injected into their MGv (d). Insets show representative EPSCs. 
(e–g) Mean PPI of maximal acoustic startle response in 1.5- (e), 2- (f), and 4-month-old (g) 
WT (22, 22, 21 mice, respectively) and miR-338+/− littermates (21, 21, 20 mice, 
respectively). (e) F(5)=21.648, *p<0.001; (f) H(5)=39.887, *p<0.001; (g) H(5)=17.348, 
*p=0.004. SPL, sound pressure level. (h) Model of TC disruption in 22q11DS. DGCR8-
dependent depletion of the thalamus-enriched miR-338-3p leads to an increase in DRD2 
level in the auditory thalamus (MGv) and disruption of thalamocortical synaptic 
transmission to the auditory cortex (ACx) later in life.
