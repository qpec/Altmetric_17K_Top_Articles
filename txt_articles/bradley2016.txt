Abstract
Objectives: Although the physical demands of Rugby League (RL) match-play are well-known, the 
3
fuel sources supporting energy-production are poorly understood. We therefore assessed muscle 
4
glycogen utilisation and plasma metabolite responses to RL match-play after a relatively high (HCHO) 
5
or relatively low CHO (LCHO) diet. Design: Sixteen (mean ± SD age; 18 ± 1 years, body-mass; 88 ± 
6
12 kg, height 180 ± 8 cm) professional players completed a RL match after 36-hours consuming a 
7
non-isocaloric HCHO (n=8; 6 g·kg·day-1) or LCHO (n=8; 3 g·kg·day-1) diet. Methods: Muscle 
8
biopsies and blood samples were obtained pre- and post-match, alongside external and internal loads 
9
quantified using Global Positioning System technology and heart rate, respectively. Data were 
10
analysed using effects sizes ± 90% CI and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Differences in pre-
11
match muscle glycogen between HCHO and LCHO (449 ± 51 and 444 ± 81 mmol·kg-1d.w.) were 
12
unclear. HCHO (243 ± 43 mmol·kg-1d.w.) and LCHO (298 ± 130 mmol·kg-1d.w.) were most and very 
13
likely reduced post-match, respectively. For both HCHO and LCHO, differences in pre-match NEFA 
14
and glycerol were unclear, with a most likely increase in NEFA and glycerol post-match. NEFA was 
15
likely greater in LCHO compared with HCHO post-match (1.45 ± 0.51 mmol·l-1 and 0.95 ± 0.39 
16
respectively), whereas differences between the 2 groups for glycerol were unclear (123.1 ± 39.6 and 
17
98.1 ± 33.6 mmol·l-1) LCHO and HCHO respectively. Conclusions: Professional RL players can 
18
utilise ~40% of their muscle glycogen during a competitive match regardless of their carbohydrate 
19
consumption in the preceding 36-hours.

Introduction
23
Rugby league (RL) is a high-intensity intermittent team sport played over 80 minutes. Players are 
24
required to perform repeated bouts of relatively short, high-intensity efforts such as sprints, high-
25
impact collisions, and sudden changes of direction, interspersed with low-intensity activities such as 
26
standing, walking, and jogging1-3 Playing position dictates the predominance of activity performed 
27
during a game, with forwards (props, 2nd row and loose forward) primarily carrying the ball forward 
28
into collisions to make positive ground, and the adjustables (scrum-half, stand-off, hooker) and outside 
29
backs (fullback, wingers and centres) travelling greater distances, running more into open spaces and 
30
supporting offensive plays.3 Total distance covered relative to match time (m·min-1) is similar between 
31
positions,4,5 ~90–95 m·min-1. All players experience physical collisions regularly throughout a game24
32
with forwards being involved in one collision per minute, which is greater than both the adjustables 
33
(~0.6 collisions per minute) and outside backs (~0.3 collisions per minute). Although the match 
34
demands of professional RL have been well described3, 6, 7 the sources of energy fuelling such 
35
workloads are poorly understood.8
36
Several studies in professional soccer have reported large changes in players’ muscle glycogen 
37
concentrations immediately after a competitive fixture.8, 9 Many players finished a match with less 
38
than 200 mmol·kg-1 dry weight (d.w.) of muscle glycogen and some showed almost complete 
39
depletion in the whole muscle (<50 mmol·kg-1 d.w)10 and individual fibers.8 Blood metabolites have 
40
also indicated mobilisation of lipids after a football match, with increases in blood NEFA and glycerol 
41
concentrations.8, 11 These metabolic changes have been used to describe fatigue in soccer players, 
42
characterised by reductions in high-intensity running and sprinting.12 Moreover, high-intensity running 
43
is also impaired in players starting a game with low muscle glycogen.12
44
Metabolic and match demands data have helped to devise physiological training programmes and 
45
nutritional strategies to enhance performance and/or delay fatigue in soccer.13 Such studies have also 
46
formed the basis of nutritional position stands,14 which have then been translated for use in RL. 
47
However, there are distinct differences in the game characteristics between RL and soccer, most 
48
notably the greater distances covered by soccer players11,15 and the multiple physical collisions 
49

observed in rugby.16 Therefore, the suitability of using such studies to inform nutritional practices of 
50
rugby is questionable.17,18 Despite limited empirical evidence, traditional nutritional practice in rugby 
51
has been to load with CHO in the days leading up to a game,14 including doses between 6-10 g·kg-1
52
body mass. Many professional rugby players might not strictly adhere to this advice17, 18 possibly 
53
because their large body mass makes such large CHO intakes difficult to consume (potentially >1 kg 
54
of CHO per day for some larger players). Accordingly, the effects of an acute CHO intake on muscle 
55
glycogen concentration and performance of professional RL players warrants investigation. 
56
The aim of the present study was to therefore quantify the physiological and metabolic demands of RL 
57
match-play after 36-hours on a relatively high (HCHO) or a relatively low (LCHO) carbohydrate diet. 
58
To this end, we studied professional male academy players during a competitive RL match having 
59
followed 36-hours of either 6 g·kg-1 (HCHO) or 3 g·kg-1 (LCHO) carbohydrate diet. We hypothesised 
60
that 1) A competitive RL match would result in muscle glycogen depletion in players similar to that 
61
seen after competitive soccer games and 2) players consuming 6 g·kg-1 CHO would perform better in 
62
the second half compared with those players that followed the 3 g·kg-1 CHO diet.

Methods
68
Sixteen professional rugby players (mean ± SD age 18.2 ± 0.8 years, body-mass 88.4 ± 12.4 kg, height 
69
180 ± 8.1 cm) from a Super League rugby club academy volunteered to take part in this study. All of 
70
the players were full time professionals with ~70% of the players appearing in the first team squad at 
71
some point during the season. Using a random number generator, players were split in to one of two 
72
dietary groups. All players competed on the same team and completed a calendared 80-minute 
73
competitive RL match with a 10 min half-time period against a team from the same league, with 16 
74
and 14 players giving a muscle biopsy and a venous blood sample pre- and post-match, respectively. 
75
Two players declined to give a post-match muscle biopsy and were withdrawn from this aspect of the 
76
study. Therefore all muscle biopsy and blood data are presented as n=14 whereas GPS and HR data 
77
are presented on n=16. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the ethics committee of Liverpool 
78
John Moores University and all participants provided written informed consent before starting the 
79
study.
80
Players began a standardised five-day lead in to a competitive rugby match as prescribed by the club 
81
(Table 1a). Players followed an individualised diet plan beginning 36-hours before kick off, with 
82
habitual diet ingested before the intervention. In a standardised order, players provided a muscle 
83
biopsy followed by a venous blood sample before and after the match, alongside urine samples and 
84
countermovement jumps. Only water was ingested between pre- and post-match samples. 
85
Relative distances covered, low intensity activity, high intensity running and repeated high-intensity 
86
efforts (RHIE) performed by all players during the match were assessed using GPS technology 
87
(Optimeye S5, Catapult Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) as previously described17, 18 Heart rate was 
88
also monitored using a coded transmitter unit (Polar, Oy, Finland) strapped to the chest with data 
89
transmitted and recorded to GPS units for later download and analysis.
90
Individualised diets were designed and provided to all participants. Player body mass was recorded 
91
and grouped to the closest 10 kg (70, 80, 90, 100 or 110 kg) which was used to prescribe the CHO 
92

content of the individual’s diet. In a randomised design, players were initially divided into forwards 
93
and backs, ranked according to body mass, and then block randomised to one of two diet groups
94
comprising either relatively high CHO (~6 g·kg·day-1 CHO, ~1.8 g·kg·day-1 protein and 0.7 g·kg·day-1
95
fat) or a non-isocaloric relatively low CHO (~3 g·kg·day-1 CHO, ~1.8 g·kg·day-1 protein and 0.7 
96
g·kg·day-1 fat). Although it could be argued that 6 g·kg·day-1 might not appear a particularly ‘high 
97
CHO diet’ and likewise 3 g·kg·day-1 is not a ‘low CHO diet’, these intakes are typically ingested by 
98
rugby players during the training week and leading up to competition, respectively.17, 18 Moreover, 
99
given the large muscle mass of rugby players, 6 g·kg·day-1 results in almost 600 g of total CHO, which 
100
could be considered high. It must, however, be stressed that although ‘high’ and ‘low’ terminology is 
101
used throughout this manuscript, the absolute amount of CHO consumed by the players should be 
102
considered when comparing to previous literature. CHO was taken in the form of both solids and 
103
fluids, with groups fluid matched (~3.5 L). Foods were selected, purchased, and distributed by the 
104
clubs nutritionist and delivered to the players accompanied by a meal plan. All players were given 
105
strict instructions to follow the diet beginning the day before the match, not to consume any foods or 
106
liquids other than what was provided and to finish all meals provided. All players self-reported that 
107
they had strictly adhered to the diets prescribed to them. 
108
Muscle samples were obtained using a biopsy gun (Monopty 12g, BARD, Brighton, UK) from the 
109
middle of the vastus lateralis muscle on the right leg as previously described.19 Although the increase 
110
in inflammatory markers after a muscle biopsy have been well documented,20 given our key measure 
111
was glycogen, it was decided that post-match biopsies would be taken from a new incision close to the 
112
original site (~2 cm proximal) after the same procedures.19 All muscle samples were immediately snap 
113
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for later analysis. Blood samples (5 ml) were drawn from 
114
a superficial vein in the anticubital fossa of the forearm using standard venipuncture techniques 
115
(Vacutainer Systems, Becton, Dickinson). Samples were collected into three vacutainers (Serum 
116
Separating Tube, EDTA and Lithium Heparin tubes, Nu-Care Products, UK), and were stored on ice 
117
(apart from serum) until centrifugation at 1500 RCF for 15-min at 4°C. All post-match muscle and 
118
blood samples were taken within 40-minutes of the match finishing, which was achieved by having

four qualified researchers performing the biopsies simultaneously. Muscle glycogen concentration was 
120
determined as previously described19 and analysed in duplicate with the mean of the two measures 
121
recorded.

was 
analysed 
122
spectrophotometrically for glycerol, NEFA and glucose concentrations using commercially available 
123
kits (Randox, Laboratories, Antrim, UK) with intra-assay CV of <5% for all assays.
124
Countermovement jump (CMJ) height was estimated from an individual’s flight time using a contact 
125
timing mat (Just Jump, Probiotics Inc, Alabama) as previously described.21 Urine samples were 
126
collected in a 30 ml container (Sterilin universal, Sterilin, UK) upon arriving at the club and were 
127
analysed for osmolality measured in mOsm·kg-1 using a handheld osmometer (Osmocheck, 
128
PerformBetter, UK) which has previously been validated.22
129
Magnitude-based inferential statistics were employed to provide information on the size of the 
130
differences allowing a more practical and meaningful explanation of the data. Differences in i) 
131
movement characteristics between the first and second half, and ii) for urine osmolality, CMJ height, 
132
muscle glycogen concentration and blood metabolites before and after the game were analysed for 
133
HCHO and LCHO groups using Cohen’s effect size (ES) statistic ± 90% confidence limits (CL) and 
134
magnitude-based inferences, as suggested by Batterham and Hopkins (2006). Threshold probabilities 
135
for a meaningful effect based on the 90% confidence limits (CL) were: <0.5% most unlikely, 0.5–5%
136
very unlikely, 5–25% unlikely, 25–75% possibly, 75–95% likely, 95–99.5% very likely, >99.5% most 
137
likely. Effects with confidence limits across a likely small positive or negative change were classified 
138
as unclear.23 All analyses were completed using a predesigned spreadsheet.16

Results
142
143
Muscle glycogen data are presented in Figure 1. Differences in muscle glycogen between HCHO and 
144
LCHO were unclear during the first (ES ± 90% CL: 0.05 ± 1.31) and second halves (0.65 ± 1.93). 
145
Muscle glycogen most likely reduced from pre- to post-match by 45 ± 9.5% (4.96 ± 1.43) and very 
146
likely reduced by 38.2 ± 17.5% (-2.08 ± 1.21) for HCHO and LCHO respectively.
147
Blood glucose, glycerol and NEFA data are presented in Figures 2a, b and c respectively. Differences 
148
in plasma glucose between HCHO and LCHO were unclear pre- (-1.86 ± 0.96) and post-match (-0.06 
149
± 0.77). Changes in plasma glucose from pre- to post-match were unclear for both HCHO and LCHO 
150
groups with a -1 ± 18.8% reduction (-0.15 ± 3.02) and 9.3 ± 18.2% increase (1.11 ± 2.07), respectively.
151
Differences in plasma glycerol between HCHO and LCHO were unclear pre- (0.4 ± 0.79) and post-
152
match (0.66 ± 0.91). Plasma glycerol most likely increased from pre- to post-match by 52 ± 24.4% 
153
(2.94 ± 1.38) and by 122 ± 68% (1.70 ± 0.64) for HCHO and LCHO, respectively.
154
Differences in NEFA between HCHO and LCHO were unclear pre-match (0.27 ± 0.74) and likely
155
higher for LCHO post-match (0.95 ± 0.93). NEFA concentration most likely increased from pre- to 
156
post-match by 172.6 ± 97.3% (1.21 ± 0.42) and 226.7 ± 175.9% (1.89 ± 0.82) for HCHO and LCHO, 
157
respectively. 
158
Differences in overall total distance relative to playing time (0.22 ± 0.63), low intensity activity (-0.13 
159
± 0.80) and high intensity running (-0.31 ± 0.58) were unclear between HCHO and LCHO. Total 
160
distance relative to playing time from the first to the second half possibly decreased in HCHO (-0.30 ± 
161
0.45) but was unclear for LCHO (-0.23 ± 0.68). A change in low intensity activity from the first and 
162
second half was unclear in HCHO (-0.08 ± 0.65) and LCHO (0.04 ± 0.60). Conversely, high intensity 
163
running in the second half was likely lower for HCHO (-0.55 ± 0.36) and very likely lower for LCHO 
164
(-1.42 ± 0.69). Differences in percentage of heart rate peak (%HRpeak) between HCHO and LCHO 
165
were unclear during the first (0.74 ± 0.67) and second halves (0.01 ± 0.82). %HRpeak possibly reduced
166

9
from first to second half (-0.23 ± 0.15) and likely reduced (-0.48 ± 0.63) for HCHO and LCHO 
167
respectively. Differences in RHIE’s between HCHO and LCHO were unclear during the first (0.32 ± 
168
0.42) and second halves (0.39 ± 0.43). A change in RHIE’s from the first and second half were 
169
unclear in HCHO (0.19 ± 1.24) and LCHO (0.53 ± 0.87). First and second half movement 
170
characteristics for HCHO and LCHO are shown in Table 1b.
171
172
Average urine osmolality was 354.4 ± 226.3 and 593.8 ± 299 mOsmol·l-1 for HCHO and LCHO 
173
respectively. HCHO were likely more hydrated than LCHO (0.74 ± 0.67). 
174
175
Average jump height was 50.4 ± 5.7 cf. 53.3 ± 8.9 cm pre-match, 49.4 ± 6.4 cf. 53.3 ± 8 cm post-
176
match, and 42.6 ± 5.1 cf. 46.6 ± 6.7 cm 24-hours post-match for HCHO and LCHO, respectively.
177
Differences in CMJ between HCHO and LCHO were unclear pre- (0.39 ± 1.05) post- (0.5 ± 0.86) and 
178
24-hours post-match (0.62 ± 0.86). CMJ possibly reduced from pre- to post-match (1.01 ± 0.54) and 
179
increases were likely trivial (0.37 ± 0.57) for HCHO and LCHO, respectively. CMJ most likely
180
reduced 24-hours post-match (-1 ± 0.26) and (-0.75 ± 0.16) for HCHO and LCHO, respectively.

Discussion
184
We provide novel data demonstrating that RL match-play can induce an approximate 40% glycogen 
185
depletion and moreover, manipulation of energy in the form of CHO did not appear to affect resting 
186
glycogen availability, glycogen utilisation, or markers of match-play work load. Analysis of players’ 
187
internal and external loads revealed these data were consistent with competitive Super League match-
188
play intensities.5 with mean total distance covered relative to match time of ~85-94 m·min-1 and heart 
189
rates 78-83 % HRpeak. Interestingly, no differences were found in total, high and low intensity running 
190
distance, RHIEs, or % HRpeak between the HCHO and LCHO conditions during the first or second half. 
191
In the second half, there were likely and very likely reductions in high intensity running distance, for 
192
the HCHO and LCHO groups, respectively. Our GPS data therefore suggest no major advantage of 
193
consuming more energy in form of CHO to enhance the high intensity running capabilities of 
194
professional rugby league players. However, tactical changes and the ability of players to control 
195
locomotive rate means future studies using simulated match-play should be employed to confirm these 
196
findings.
197
Despite major differences in the match day demands between soccer and rugby, similar pre- and post-
198
match muscle glycogen concentrations were reported.8 The relatively high muscle glycogen 
199
concentrations observed in the present study were achieved after CHO intakes typically ingested by 
200
players during the training week (3 g·kg-1; 240 – 330 g CHO) and leading up to competition17, 18 (6 
201
g·kg-1; 480 – 660 g CHO) which could be described as low or relatively high CHO diets, respectively. 
202
Although no dietary analysis was performed before the study with the view of reducing player burden 
203
and maintaining ecological validity, we speculate that the training and nutrition of the players earlier 
204
in the week resulted in a reasonable muscle glycogen concentration before the 36-hours CHO load 
205
leading into the game. This is pertinent given that the magnitude of muscle glycogen re-synthesis is
206
heavily influenced by the starting muscle glycogen concentration.24, 25, 26 Indeed, it is typical in rugby 
207
for training to taper towards match day whilst CHO intake gradually increases18 and therefore it is 
208
feasible that some of the players started the one day load with adequate muscle glycogen 
209

11
concentrations. Moreover, 3-6 g·kg-1 CHO in athletes with a high muscle mass, i.e. rugby players27
210
results in a total CHO intake of  ~300-600 g and might not be considered a low CHO intake for team-
211
sport athletes. Given that the studies used to formulate CHO intake guidelines have recruited athletes 
212
with a much lower body mass,19, 28 we suggest absolute rather than relative amounts might be more 
213
appropriate when prescribing CHO recommendations for rugby players. However, this suggestion 
214
requires further investigation. Interestingly, analysis of individual players suggests that the group 
215
receiving ~600 g of CHO for 36-hours pre-match demonstrated a more homogenous pre-match 
216
glycogen concentration. We therefore speculate that ~600 g of CHO be recommended for 36-hours 
217
pre-match for competitive rugby players although future studies would be required to assess the 
218
efficacy of this suggestion as well as assessing glycogen utilisation in single fibers.8 A limitation of the 
219
present study was that post-match biopsies were collected over a 40-minute period rather than at 
220
precisely the same time due to logistical reasons (i.e. only having four qualified biopsy takers). Future 
221
studies might wish to take measures from fewer players but over a series of matches to facilitate a 
222
more rapid removal of tissue as well as consider a half-time muscle biopsy. 
223
Analysis of the CMJ data suggested that there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in 
224
terms of recovery from the game. All players presented with significantly reduced CMJ the day after 
225
the game, which is likely due to muscle damage causing a reduction in maximal force-generating 
226
capacity.29, 30 This decrease in CMJ was not affected by manipulating energy in the form of CHO in 
227
the days leading into the game, confirming previous suggestions that pre-exercise CHO manipulation 
228
does not affect recovery from damaging exercise.31
229
Increased lipid mobilization was evidenced by large increases in NEFA and glycerol concentrations 
230
after the match for both the HCHO and LCHO group. Considering the intermittent nature of a RL 
231
match, elevated lipid oxidation, despite what would appear sufficient muscle glycogen concentrations 
232
even at the end of the match, might reflect periods of low intensity activity (walking or jogging) and 
233
when the ball was out of play. Interestingly, pre- and post-match NEFA concentrations were similar 
234
to those observed in football8 despite differences in match-play activity. Therefore, combined with the 
235

12
similar reductions in post-match muscle glycogen, our data suggest that RL and football might possess 
236
similar metabolic demands.
237
Conclusion
238
We have for the first time attempted to quantify the metabolic demands of professional RL match-play 
239
whilst manipulating energy in the form of CHO. We report that a competitive RL match can result in 
240
~40% muscle glycogen depletion and that match-day performance variables did not differ between the 
241
6 g·kg-1 or 3 g·kg-1 CHO conditions. However, further analysis suggested that the higher CHO intake 
242
results in a more homogenous pre-match glycogen concentration between the players. Therefore, 
243
despite no differences in movement characteristics between the low and the high CHO groups, we 
244
postulate that an absolute amount of ~600 g CHO 36-hours pre-match is recommended strategy for 
245
rugby league players. Future studies might wish to further titrate these CHO recommendations as well 
246
as assessing the effects of a rugby match on muscle glycogen in individual muscle fibers. 
247

Practical Implications
249

The present study has demonstrated that using the microbiopsy technique, muscle biopsies are 
250
possible before and after a competitive rugby league match proving a framework for future 
251
research in this sport.
252

Approximately 40% of muscle glycogen appears to be used during a competitive rugby league 
253
match, although the effects on individual fibers remain unresolved.
254

There were no noticeable differences in high intensity running capability between the two dietary 
255
groups, suggesting that the lower carbohydrate condition had no gross effects on performance.
256

Notwithstanding the limitations of interpreting movement characteristics of a single match, we 
257
propose that a diet comprising ~600 g CHO 36 h before a match could be recommended to ensure 
258
all players commence the match with appropriate muscle glycogen concentrations.


It would appear that carbohydrate consumption in the week leading into a rugby match is the 
260
major contributor to pre-match muscle glycogen concentration, rather than the carbohydrate 
261
content of the diet in the preceding 36 hours and therefore this should be monitored by coaches 
262
and 
players.
