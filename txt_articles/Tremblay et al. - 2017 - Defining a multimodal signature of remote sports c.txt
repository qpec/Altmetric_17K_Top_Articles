Abstract
Sports-related concussions lead to persistent anomalies of the brain structure and function that interact with the effects of normal
ageing. Although post-mortem investigations have proposed a bio-signature of remote concussions, there is still no clear in vivo
signature. In the current study, we characterized white matter integrity in retired athletes with a history of remote concussions by
conducting a full-brain, diffusion-based connectivity analysis. Next, we combined MRI diffusion markers with MR spectroscopic,
MRI volumetric, neurobehavioral and genetic markers to identify a multidimensional in vivo signature of remote concussions.
Machine learning classifiers trained to detect remote concussions using this signature achieved detection accuracies up to 90%
(sensitivity: 93%, specificity: 87%). These automated classifiers identified white matter integrity as the hallmark of remote concus-
sions and could provide, following further validation, a preliminary unbiased detection tool to help medical and legal experts rule
out concussion history in patients presenting or complaining about late-life abnormal cognitive decline.
Introduction
In the realm of organized sports such as soccer, hockey and tackle
football, millions of people are at risk of sustaining one or multiple
sports concussions during the practice of their sports every year
(NCYS, 2008; Mccrory et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2013, 2014;
CDC, 2015). This number translates to an estimated incidence of
1.6 – 3.8 million sports concussions every year in the U.S. alone
(Petersen et al., 2005; Langlois et al., 2006; Faul et al., 2010;
World Medical Association, 2013). Studies analysing groups of con-
cussed athletes suggest long-term detrimental effects of sports-
related concussion on the brain function and structure of ageing
individuals (Guskiewicz et al., 2005; Omalu et al., 2005; Petersen
et al., 2005; De Beaumont et al., 2009, 2013; Broglio et al., 2012;
Didehbani et al., 2013; Hart et al., 2013; McKee et al., 2013; Strain
et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2013, 2014; Gardner et al., 2015). In
a decade-long controversial lawsuit opposing retired football players
against the National Football League, protagonists faced an impor-
tant factor of complexity in that there is still no available in vivo
signature of remote concussions that can be used for retrospective
diagnosis (Good et al., 2001; Ken Belson, 2013; Tremblay et al.,
2013). Consequently, there was no objective way for retired profes-
sional football players who were still alive to prove that personal
life hardship after their playing career was due to remote concus-
sions sustained during their professional playing years. The emer-
gence
of

practice,
however, holds great promise with its capacity to integrate thou-
sands of biomarkers to build objective and automated in vivo detec-
tion tools to support clinical diagnosis (Smith et al., 2004; Jordan &
Mitchell, 2015; Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016).
In a first part, we sought to expand on a previous investigation
(Tremblay et al., 2014) of white matter tracts in ageing concussed
athlete by conducting a full-brain connectivity analysis. This analysis
allows to map the associative and inter-hemispheric connections of
the brain and to appreciate the density of connections between all
pairs of selected brain regions (Sporns et al., 2000; Iturria-Medina
et al., 2008). Inspired by Moretti et al. who suggested that network
analysis might be sensitive to the combined effects of TBI and ageing
(Moretti et al., 2012), we also used a graph theoretical approach to
characterize the topology of the white matter network in retired ath-
letes with a history of concussions. This approach allows investigating
higher level network-wide metrics such as the redundancy of connec-
tions and their efficiency in transferring information between brain
regions (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009; Iturria-Medina, 2013). These two

 analyses were expected to bring new informative biomarkers that can
be used in the second, diagnostic part of the study.
The second objective of the current study is to characterize the
in vivo signature of remote sports concussions to provide an objective
diagnostic tool. Over the last decade, several differences in brain
structure and function have been identified at the group level in
retired athletes with or without a history of sports concussions (De
Beaumont et al., 2012; McKee et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2013).
Despite these group differences, there is currently no objective tool to
identify concussion history in vivo at a single patient level, which is a
requirement for diagnostic purposes. Although a clinical interview
with an experienced sports physician is currently the gold standard
for retrospective diagnosis, the medical community acknowledges that
this diagnostic method is imperfect and could be supported by the
use of objective biomarkers (Shenton et al., 2012; Mccrory et al.,
2013). In the past few years, our research group has followed a sam-
ple of former athletes and acquired various measurements of their
cognitive function, brain structure and genotype (De Beaumont et al.,
2013; Tremblay et al., 2013, 2014). This sample was carefully
selected so that no confounding variables, such as dementia, depres-
sion or history of substance abuse, could explain the brain function
decline in participants with a history of concussions. We identified
several cognitive and structural anomalies in the concussed sample of
ageing athletes at the group level, but we never combined these
anomalies into an integrated biological signature that could be used at
the individual level. The evolving field of machine learning now
allows to look at the ensemble of cognitive and structural anomalies
and to identify an integrated biological signature that remains invisi-
ble to univariate analysis (Lui et al., 2014; Jordan & Mitchell, 2015;
Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016). Using classifiers borrowed from the
field of machine learning, we attempted to provide an in vivo signa-
ture of remote sports concussions in retired athletes that could be used
for unbiased diagnostic purposes. Ultimately, pending validation in
other cohorts of concussed patients and on different scanners, this tool
could be used to support the legal testimony of retired athletes com-
plaining about cognitive decline allegedly caused by remote concus-
sions, and/or to help clinicians rule out remote concussions as a
potential cause of late-life cognitive impairment in geriatric patients.
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants included in this study were former male university-level
athletes between ages 51 and 75 recruited with the help of univer-
sity athletics organizations who played their respective contact sport
(ice hockey or American football) from early adolescence up to
young adulthood (Table 1). Exclusion criteria included: history of
alcohol and/or substance abuse, a current or a history of neurologi-
cal or psychiatric condition (e.g. MCI, AD, depression), a medical
condition requiring daily medication or radiotherapy (malignant can-
cer, diabetes, hypertension and/or other cardiovascular diseases), a
learning disability (e.g. dyslexia) or TBI unrelated to contact sports
(e.g. fall, motor vehicle accidents, assault). Participants were not to
have sustained sports-related concussions since the end of their uni-
versity athletic career. To control for the protective effects of physi-
cal exercise on cognition (Hillman et al., 2008), participants had to
engage in physical activity at least 3 times a week at the time of
testing and to have maintained this level of activity since the end of
their athletic career. In addition, all participants had to have a body
mass index below 30 kg/m2; the criteria for obesity of the World
Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2000).
Participants were divided into two groups as a function of their
sports-related concussion history. The concussed group consisted of
15 former university-level athletes with a mean age of 60.87 years (s-
tandard deviation [SD] 7.51) and a mean level of education of
16.67 years (SD 4.07) who sustained their last sports concussion in
early adulthood (mean 24.00 and SD 4.55). A standardized concus-
sion history questionnaire (Collins et al., 2002; De Beaumont et al.,
2009) was administered in an interview setting by an experienced
sports physician to obtain detailed information about the number of
previous concussions, their date, the description of the accident and
the nature and duration of on-field post-concussion severity markers
(confusion and/or disorientation, retrograde and/or anterograde amne-
sia and loss of consciousness [LOC]). Participants who could not rec-
ollect sufficient information about their concussion history to allow
accurate group classification were excluded from the study. Concus-
sion was defined according to the definition provided by the 2009
Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sports (NCYS, 2008;
Mccrory et al., 2009; CDC, 2015) as “a complex pathophysiological
process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical
forces, that results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neu-
rologic function that may or may not include loss of consciousness.”
The number of reported concussions sustained by the experimental
group ranged from 1 to 5 (mean 2.08 and SD 1.31) and the time
elapsed since the last concussion spanned from 29 to 53 years (mean
37.08 and SD 7.10). All brain injuries classified as “mild” on the
Glasgow Coma Scale (scores ranging from 13 to 15) and did not lead
to chronic complications (e.g. post-concussion syndrome or other per-
sistent clinical symptoms).
The control group consisted of 15 former university-level athletes
with a mean age of 58.13 (SD 5.28) and a mean level of education of
17.27 (SD 3.45) who, following a structured interview with a sports

 physician, had no prior history of concussion, or any other head
trauma outside the practice of their sport (e.g. motor vehicle accident).
The study was pre-approved by the ethic committee of the Institut uni-
versitaire de G�
eriatrie de Montr�
eal (CRIUGM) and all participants
provided written informed consent prior to testing in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki (Langlois et al., 2006; Faul et al., 2010;
World Medical Association, 2013). The sample size for connectivity
and graph theoretical analyses was selected based on estimations of
effect sizes from previous investigations (Guskiewicz et al., 2005;
Omalu et al., 2005; De Beaumont et al., 2009, 2013; Broglio et al.,
2012; Didehbani et al., 2013; Hart et al., 2013; McKee et al., 2013;
Strain et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2013, 2014; Gardner et al.,
2015). In these investigations, large effect sizes were observed on
many outcome variables (Cohen’s d > 1), suggesting adequate statis-
tical power (b > 0.80) with a sample size of 30 participants.
Neuropsychological testing
Neuropsychological testing procedures are as described in a previous
article (Ken Belson, 2013; Tremblay et al., 2013). Participants under-
went two testing sessions. The first session included the interview
with the sports physician to assess inclusion criteria and group classi-
fication using a general health questionnaire and a standardized
concussion history questionnaire administered by the physician. Fol-
lowing the interview, a neuropsychologist blinded to group member-
ship administered an exhaustive neuropsychological test battery
aiming to assess age-related neurocognitive decline. The battery
included tests of general cognitive ability (Mini-Mental State Exami-
nation; Folstein et al., 1975), verbal fluency (semantic and phonemic;
Spreen & Benton, 1977), verbal and visual episodic memory (Rey
Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Taylor Complex Figure Test; Tay-
lor, 1969; Schmidt, 1996), attention (Eriksen Flanker Task; Eriksen &
Eriksen, 1974) and processing speed (Trail Making Test A & B and
Symbol Digit Modalities Test; Smith, 1973; Reitan & Wolfson,
1985). A computerized Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) was also
administered to assess sequence-specific and non-specific motor learn-
ing (Nissen & Bullemer, 1987). The Beck Depression Inventory-II
(BDI-II) was administered at the end of the neuropsychological test
battery (Beck et al., 1996).
Genotyping
At the end of the first session, we collected saliva samples in order to
establish the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and Brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor (BDNF) genotype of participants. DNA extraction
from saliva samples was performed using Oragene OG-250s kits
(DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada) and participants were genotyped for
APOE 112 (rs429358)-158 (rs7412) and BDNF rs6265 (Val66Met)
polymorphisms. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was per-
formed on a Biometra Tprofessional Basic thermocycler (Biometra,
G€
ottingen, Germany) as previously described (Petersen et al., 2005;
Jordan & Mitchell, 2015; Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016). APOE and
BDNF polymorphisms were subsequently determined via an estab-
lished pyrosequencing protocol (Petersen et al., 2005; Tremblay et al.,
2014). These genetic markers were obtained primarily for the purpose
of controlling the frequency of the allele APOE ɛ-4 across groups,
which is an important risk factor for dementia (Poirier et al., 1993).
Structural neuroimaging
The second session consisted of the neuroimaging evaluation. All
MR examinations were performed on a Siemens 3T Magnetom TIM
TRIO scanner with a 12-channel head coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Ger-
many). Three-dimensional high-resolution T1-weighted images of
the brain were acquired using a sagittal MP-RAGE sequence (repeti-
tion time (TR) = 2300 ms; echo time (TE)
= 2.91 ms; number of
slices = 176) with a 1-mm3 resolution. T2-weighted images were
obtained
using
a
turbo
spin-echo
sequence
(TR = 3000 ms;
TE = 78 ms; number of slices = 48) for neuroradiological diagnos-
tic purposes. From the T1 images, we investigated peripheral grey
matter tissue morphology using an optimized voxel-based morphom-
etry analysis (Sporns et al., 2000; Good et al., 2001; Iturria-Medina
et al., 2008) using the tools from the FSL toolbox (Smith et al.,
2004; Bullmore & Sporns, 2009; Iturria-Medina, 2013). From the
same images, we quantified gross brain tissue volumes of GM,
WM, and CSF, normalized for subjects’ intracranial volume, using
the SIENAX tool (Smith et al., 2002). We also assessed sub-cortical
grey matter volume and morphology using the FIRST tool from the
same toolbox (Patenaude et al., 2011). Lastly, we assessed cortical
grey matter integrity using a cortical thickness analysis implemented
in the CIVET pipeline from the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre at
McGill University (Lyttelton et al., 2007).
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
1H MR spectra were obtained from the voxels localized in the bilat-
eral medial temporal lobes, bilateral primary motor cortices and
bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices. All voxels contained a mixture of
grey and white matter, while avoiding potential signal artefacts from
ventricles, fatty tissues and bones. Proton signal detection using the
point-resolved spectroscopy pulse sequence (PRESS) was performed
after suppression of the water signal with the chemical shift-
selective sequence. PRESS spectra were also acquired without water
suppression in order to use the H2O signal as an internal reference
(Christiansen et al., 1993). Acquisition parameters were the follow-
ing: TR = 1200 ms, TE = 30 ms and 128 averages. Free induction
decays were transferred to a Silicon Graphics workstation and pro-
cessed with the LCModel software version 6.1 (Provencher, 1993).
The
following
metabolites
were
quantified:
N-acetylaspartate
(NAA), myo-inositol (mI), choline-containing compounds (Cho), as
well as H2O for an internal reference.
Diffusion-weighted imaging
For the purpose of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) analyses, dif-
fusion-weighted volumes were acquired using gradients applied in
32 non-collinear directions. The following parameters were used: 75
contiguous slices; slice thickness = 2 mm; field of view = 256 x
256 mm2; matrix size of 128 x 128; voxel size = 2 mm isotropic;
repetition time = 9200 ms; echo time = 84 ms; and b values of
b = 0 and b = 1000 s/mm2. The diffusion images were pre-
processed using the Imeka pipeline (www.imeka.ca). The pipeline
involved: (i) denoising using NLMEANS tools (Wiest-Daessl�
e
et al., 2008); (ii) masking of the white matter using segmented
anatomical MRI of the subject; (iii) computing the fractional aniso-
tropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity maps using the diffusion
tensor model.
Voxel-wise analysis of the fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and
radial diffusivity data was carried out using tract-based spatial statis-
tics (TBSS) in the FMRIB Software Library. Image analysis using
TBSS involved a number of steps: (i) non-linear alignment of all
subjects’ fractional anisotropy images to the most representative sub-
ject of the current aged cohort; (ii) affine-transformation of the
aligned images into standard MNI152 1 mm space; (iii) averaging

 of the aligned fractional anisotropy images to create a 4D mean
fractional anisotropy image; (iv) thinning of the mean fractional ani-
sotropy image to create a mean fractional anisotropy ‘skeleton’ rep-
resenting the centre of all white matter tracts, and in this way
removing partial volume confounds; and (v) thresholding of the
fractional anisotropy skeleton at fractional anisotropy > 0.3 to sup-
press areas of extremely low mean fractional anisotropy and exclud-
ing those with considerable inter-individual variability. Similar steps
for processing non-fractional anisotropy images were then carried
out to obtain the mean, axial and radial diffusivity images. Non-
parametric
permutation-based
statistics
were
employed
using
“Randomize” with threshold-free cluster enhancement and 5000 per-
mutations. A threshold of P < 0.05 was then applied on the results,
corrected for multiple comparisons. Age and intracranial vol-
ume were included as covariates of no interest in all TBSS analyses.
From the fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity
and axial diffusivity maps, region of interest metrics were obtained
for each participant by averaging voxel values within automatically
segmented white matter tracts according to the JHU ICBM-DTI-81
white matter atlas (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases). The
four diffusion measures for 48 fibre tracts of interest were evaluated
for the purpose of the classification analyses and will be referred
together as “DWI diffusion”. Segmented tracts of interest are listed
in Table S1.
Connectivity and graph theoretical analyses
For each subject, probabilistic axonal connectivity values between
each brain voxel and the surface of 83 grey matter regions (voxel-
region connectivity) were estimated using a fully automated fibre
tractography algorithm (Iturria-Medina et al., 2007). Grey matter
regions of interest were defined using the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville
grey matter atlas (http://www.mindboggle.info/data.html) (Klein &
Tourville, 2012) (Fig. S1 and Table S2). Fibre tractography parame-
ters used were: maximum path length = 500 mm and curvature
threshold = �900. Intravoxel white matter Orientational Distribution
Function (ODF) maps were estimated using the Q-ball approach
(Tuch, 2004). Based on the resulting voxel-region connectivity
maps, the anatomical connection density (ACD) between any pairs
of region i and j (ACDij � ACDji) was calculated. The ACD mea-
sure reflects the degree of evidence supporting the existence of each
white matter connection, after controlling for region size. It is esti-
mated by counting the “effective” number of voxels over the surface
of both regions and weighting each voxel by its voxel-region con-
nectivity value with the opposite zone, relative to the total number
of considered superficial voxels. From this, an 83 9 83 matrix of
ACD measures was obtained for each subject.
Next, each individual structural network was topologically charac-
terized according to its intrinsic capacities to manage and integrate
the nervous information flow (Iturria-Medina et al., 2008; Iturria-
Medina, 2013). For this, seven different graph theoretical network
measures were calculated using the Matlab toolbox from Iturria-
Medina et al., 2007 that specializes on computing these metrics on
DWI data: clustering index (a measure of the inherent tendency to
cluster nodes into strictly connected neighbourhoods); characteristic
path length (the average number of region-region direct connections
that must be traversed to go from one region to another); modularity
(the degree to which a network may be subdivided into subnetwork
modules with a maximum number of internal links and a minimum
number of external links); global efficiency (a measure of how much
parallel information can be potentially exchanged over a network);
local
efficiency
(the
average
global
efficiency
of
the
local
subnetworks); betweenness centrality, or “hubness” (the number of
shortest paths between all nodes that transit through a given node);
and small-worldness (a measure of how optimally is organized a
network) (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009). The choice of network metrics
was motivated by the wish to characterize (i) “brain segregation”,
i.e. the brain’s ability to process information in specialized groups
of regions (e.g. clustering index, local efficiency, modularity), (ii)
“brain integration”, i.e. the brain’s ability to rapidly integrate spe-
cialized information from distributed brain regions (e.g. characteris-
tic path length, global efficiency), (iii) “regional centrality”, i.e.
regional importance of brain segregation and integration processes
(e.g. betweenness centrality), and (iv) “brain optimization”, i.e. the
brain’s equilibrium between segregation and integration processes
(small-worldness) (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010). However, please note
that this choice of graph theoretical network measures is not exclu-
sive and other metrics (e.g. transitivity, participation coefficient,
assortativity coefficient and motif analyses) could have been consid-
ered. Interactions and overlapping information among different met-
rics should be also considered in subsequent studies (Rubinov &
Sporns, 2010). All statistical analyses were corrected for multiple
comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) (Schwartzman et al.,
2008). Exploratory correlations between connectivity/graph theoreti-
cal metrics and neuropsychological metrics were limited to variables
that show statistically significant between-group differences. These
correlations were also corrected using FDR. Results from connectiv-
ity and graph theoretical analyses were visualized in 3D MNI space
using the BrainNet Viewer v1.5 (Xia et al., 2013).
Classification analyses
In order to detect the presence of a history of sports concussions in
ageing retired athletes, we pooled metrics acquired from genetic
assays, behavioral testing, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),
MR volumetry and diffusion-weighted imaging. In the text, we refer
to “modality” as the combination of all metrics acquired from one
testing modality (e.g. MRS). We refer to “features” to designate sin-
gle metrics acquired using a specific modality (e.g. myo-inositol
concentration in primary motor cortex). Features from each testing
modality were fed to a machine learning classifier that would
attempt to automatically classify participants as either having, or not
having, a history of remote sports concussions based on combina-
tions of features. The list of all input features is included in
Table S3.
The classification pipeline has been designed to avoid both “over-
fitting” and “peeking” (Pereira et al., 2009). The pipeline consists of
the following steps: 1) All datasets from all modalities are pre-
processed in order to remove constant or highly correlated (r > 0.8)
features. Remaining features are scaled to have zero mean and a
standard deviation of 1. 2) The full sample of participants is divided
into k-folds, and k – 1 folds are assigned to the training dataset and
the remaining fold to the testing set. In this analysis, we used a
leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the decoders’ accuracy. In
this particular case, k = 30 and each testing set consists of a single
participant for which a prediction is made. 3) For each training fold,
the following operations are performed: 3a) Relevant features are
selected by studying the importance of each feature in a multivariate
adaptive regression spline (MARS) (Friedman, 1991; Hastie et al.,
2009), as implemented in the earth package for R (https://cran.r-pro
ject.org/web/packages/earth/index.html). Features are considered rel-
evant if their importance is greater than zero following MARS with
all features inputted simultaneously. Irrelevant features that contain
no diagnostic value are automatically discarded. 3b) Using only

 these relevant features, optimal hyperparameters for the specific
machine learning algorithm are then computed, if applicable. 4) The
classifier is trained with the relevant features and the optimal hyper-
parameters obtained in the previous step. 5) A diagnostic prediction

To assess the contribution of each specific feature to the multidi-
mensional classifier, we first ran the analysis using every feature
independently (e.g. volume of lateral ventricles). All analyses were
run using the R statistical package version 3.2.1 (https://cran.r-pro
ject.org). We used a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM; https://
cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab/),
a

Logistic Regression (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stepPlr/),
a
Random
Forest
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rand
omForest/) and a LogitBoost (https://cran.r-project.org/web/package
s/caTools/). Finally, we repeated all the analyses with each indepen-
dent modality to assess their independent information value. We
trained the classifiers on genetic data, behavioral data, MRS data,
volumetric MRI data, DWI diffusion (i.e. fractional anisotropy,
mean, radial and axial diffusivity) and DWI connectivity data
(anatomical connection density and graph-theoretical metrics) inde-
pendently. We also repeated the analysis after pooling all MRI-
based modalities (MRS, volumetric MRI, DWI diffusion and DWI
connectivity), and all modalities (both MRI-based and non-MRI-
based). Results from all analyses will be reported irrespectively of
their statistical significance.
Results
Demographics, cognition and imaging
Univariate analysis pertaining to demographics, neuropsychological
performance, MRS, MR volumetry and DWI have been reported in
previous studies (De Beaumont et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2013,
2014). Summary of the sample’s demographic information
is
included in Table 1. None of the participants presented signs of
depression (BDI-II scores ≤ 9) or dementia (MMSE ≥ 27) based on
our screening tools and no history of neurological or psychiatric
conditions was reported by the participants during the medical his-
tory interview. The two groups did not differ according to age
(t28 = 1.15, P = 0.259), level of education (t28 = 0.44, P = 0.666)
or frequency of the APOE ɛ-4 allele (Fisher’s exact test, P = 1.00).
Conventional neuroradiological examination of T1 and T2-weighted
images by a board-certified neuroradiologist revealed no anomalies
of clinical significance in either group (e.g. traumatic axonal injury,
microbleeds, etc.).
Structural connectivity
The average connectivity matrix for the entire sample is presented
in Fig. 1A. Both groups exhibited clear intra-hemispheric connectiv-
ity with sparse inter-hemispheric connectivity, mainly targeting
homologous regions (Figs 1A and S2). The strength of these
anatomical connections can be visualized in 3D MNI space in
Fig. 1B,C. After contrasting the connectivity matrices of the con-
cussed group with the one of the control group, we identified sev-
eral connectivity differences that were statistically significant after
FDR correction for multiple comparisons (Fig. 1D and Table 2). All
differences
were
observed
within
right
intra-hemispheric
connections. These included: 1) lateral orbitofrontal cortex to infe-
rior temporal cortex, 2) rostral anterior cingulate cortex to cerebel-
lum exterior, 3) medial orbitofrontal cortex to caudal middle frontal
cortex and 4) hippocampus to pallidum, where patients with a his-
tory of concussions presented a significantly higher connection den-
sity.
Additionally,
connections
from
5)
pallidum
to
posterior
cingulate and 6) pars orbitalis of the lateral prefrontal cortex to pos-
terior cingulate cortex showed a significantly reduced connectivity
density in the concussed group. Of functional significance, we found
a negative relationship between the verbal fluency score of con-
cussed patients and the connectivity strength between the hippocam-
pus and the pallidum (r = �0.60, P = 0.018; Fig. 2A).
Graph theory
We found several group differences on graph theoretical metrics
computed at the local level, although we found no significant group
differences on metrics computed at the global level. When consider-
ing the betweenness centrality or “hubness” of each of the nodes
(Fig. 3A,B), we found significant differences in the left parahip-
pocampal gyrus where the hubness coefficient was higher in con-
cussed individuals (Fig. 3C). In addition, we found that the hubness
of the right pericalcarine cortex was lower in concussed vs. control
participants (Fig. 3C). When looking at the local efficiency of each
node (Fig. 4A,B), we found a higher local efficiency in the left pre-
central and the right pericalcarine cortices of concussed individuals
(Fig. 4C). We also found a lower local efficiency in the left supra-
marginal gyrus of the same participants (Fig. 4C). On a functional
level, we found the increased local efficiency of the pericalcarine
cortex in concussed participants was correlated with both a lower
verbal memory (r = �0.55, P = 0.034; Fig. 2B) and a lower visual
memory (r = 0.70, P = 0.004; Fig. 2C) test score.
Classification
We trained four different machine learning classifiers on cognitive,
genetic and multimodal neuroimaging data in an attempt to detect
remote sports concussions in individual retired athlete. When train-
ing the classifiers on each modality independently (e.g. using only
features from volumetric MRI), we found the best decoding accu-
racy using a Random forest algorithm on the DWI diffusion data
(i.e. fractional anisotropy, mean, radial and axial diffusivity), which
reached
83%
(sensitivity = 100%,
specificity = 67%)
(Fig. 5A).
Across all algorithms used, DWI diffusion data provided the best
detection of a history of sports concussions. In three out of four
classification algorithms, the second best prediction came from DWI-
based connectivity and network metrics, as detailed for the first time
in this population in the current study. In all classifiers, genetic data
provided the worst classification accuracy, followed by MRS. Volu-
metric MRI and neuropsychological metrics provided intermediary
prediction accuracies. Combining all modalities or only MRI-based
modalities leads to slightly lower decoding accuracies, around 70% at
maximum using the Random forest algorithm (Fig. 5A; right).
The “best features” for each modality were obtained by running
the algorithms iteratively on each individual feature alone and rank-
ing them according to their predictive value. The best features for
each modality are ranked and summarized in Table 3. When using
only the best features from each modality, we obtained up to 90%
decoding accuracy using the Random forest algorithm on DWI dif-
fusion (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 87%) and DWI connectivity
data (sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 100%) (Fig. 5B). Overall, the
best predictions came from DWI-based measurements of white

 matter integrity (whether diffusion or connectivity), with the mean
diffusivity of the left cingulum and the connection density from the
left rostral middle frontal cortex to the left ventral lateral prefrontal
cortex providing the most information about concussion history. In
terms of behavioral measures, verbal fluency and motor learning
provided the best predictions. Looking at volumetric MRI, only the
volume of the lateral ventricles provided valuable information about
the concussion history. Using MRS, the relative concentration of N-
acetyl-aspartate within the dominant primary motor cortex was the
most predictive of remote concussions.

 sports concussions. It shows that white matter alterations seem to
preferentially affect specific connections between brain regions of
the right hemisphere. Moreover, some abnormalities in the con-
cussed group are visible only when the analysis is conducted at the
network level, that is, when patterns of connections between brain
regions are considered rather than individual tracts. Due to our strin-
gent exclusion criteria, we do not believe these observations to be
attributable to confounding factors such as a history of substance
abuse, depression, APOE genotype, MCI or dementia, because our
two groups were identical in this respect. The presence of correla-
tions between connectivity metrics and cognitive functioning in the
concussed group further supports the clinical relevance of these find-
ings. It remains possible, however, that other unknown variables
contribute to the cognitive-structural associations reported herein.
With regard to the second objective of this study, we found that
the combination of the features from DWI data allowed building a
90%-accurate patient level (as opposed to group level) diagnostic
tool based solely on in vivo, MRI-based pathological markers of

 remote concussions. We believe this is a first, preliminary step in
identifying the in vivo biological signature of remote concussions
for differential diagnostic purposes and establishing a link between
this signature and the post-mortem manifestations of chronic trau-
matic encephalopathy (CTE) (McKee et al., 2013). We do not pre-
tend that the tool, in its present format, is ready to be taken directly
to the clinic. Validations in other cohorts and using different MRI
scanners are required as a next step and we would be happy to col-
laborate in this effort.
Abnormal connectivity
Diffusion-weighted imaging allows mapping the integrity of major
white matter tracts across the entire brain volume. A single white
matter tract, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, may con-
tain fibres originating from and projecting to several different brain
regions (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991; Conturo et al., 1999). It is
possible that specific cortico-cortical projections within a major fibre
tract are affected by a neurodegenerative process, as previously
reported in Alzheimer’s disease, Frontotemporal dementia and other
diseases (review in (Pievani et al., 2014). This principle follows
from the close relationship between the integrity of the grey matter
nodes and the integrity of the white matter tracts connecting those
nodes (Duering et al., 2012; Zatorre et al., 2012). Hence, the degen-
eration of two interconnected brain areas can lead to the degenera-
tion of the connections between these areas, and vice versa (Waller,
1850; Pierpaoli et al., 2001).
In our sample of ageing retired athletes, we discovered that a his-
tory of sports concussions is associated with abnormal connectivity
between specific brain areas. These brain areas included the lateral
and the medial parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, the ventral lateral
prefrontal cortex (pars orbitalis), the caudal middle frontal cortex,
the inferior temporal cortex, the anterior and the posterior cingulate
cortex, the cerebellum exterior, the pallidum as well as the hip-
pocampus. We noted that all involved brain regions are located
within the right hemisphere of the brain of concussed athletes.
Although we cannot provide a compelling biological reason why
that should be the case, this observation does agree with the previ-
ously documented pattern of abnormal fractional anisotropy in age-
ing athletes with a history of sports concussions (see Fig. 1 in
Tremblay et al., 2014). In the previous study, we found a more
widespread decrease in fractional anisotropy within the right hemi-
sphere of concussed participants. Following validation in a larger
sample, it would be interesting to relate this potential hemispheric
vulnerability to models of hemispheric asymmetry in younger and
older adults (Cabeza, 2002; Caeyenberghs & Leemans, 2014). This
result and its implications need to be further investigated.
Network-level anomalies
The brain is a series of embedded networks at various biological
scales (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009). The application of graph theory
to the study of these networks has permitted to quantify various
information processing performance indices and to compare brain

 network topologies in health and in disease (Bassett & Bullmore,
2009; Bullmore & Sporns, 2012). Several groups have looked at
network-level anomalies in mTBI patients in the subacute phase
(Han et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2015) or in more severe TBI cases
(Sharp et al., 2011; Caeyenberghs et al., 2012; Pandit et al., 2013).
However, despite the known effects of normal ageing on brain net-
work topology (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Gong et al., 2009),
the interaction between a history of concussions and normal ageing
on network performance had yet to be investigated.
In agreement with the model proposed by Moretti et al. for trau-
matic brain injuries of greater severity (Moretti et al., 2012), we
found several network-level anomalies in the brain of ageing retired
athletes with remote sports concussions. We found the left parahip-
pocampal gyrus and the right pericalcarine cortex to have respec-
tively higher and lower hubness in concussed participants. The
hubness of a brain region refers to the number of shortest paths con-
necting any two nodes in the brain that goes through this “hub”
node. A significant change in hubness might indicate a change in
the way by which a given brain region integrates and transfers infor-
mation between nearby connected regions (Bassett & Bullmore,
2009;
Iturria-Medina,
2013).
Likewise,
we
saw heterogeneous
changes in the local efficiency of the left precentral gyrus, the right
pericalcarine cortex and the left supramarginal gyrus. Changes in
local efficiency relate to the degree to which neighbours of a given
node are connected among them, allowing for alternative routes for
information flow given a specific hub is damaged. It might be inter-
preted that a decrease in the hubness or local efficiency of a specific
region indicates disconnection between normally well-integrated
nearby regions (Bassett & Bullmore, 2009; Iturria-Medina, 2013).
Alternatively, an increase in the hubness or local efficiency of a
region could indicate the development of compensatory mechanisms
whereby the brain has adapted to disconnections by reinforcing
alternative routes for information processing (Bassett & Bullmore,
2009; Bullmore & Sporns, 2009). It is unclear, at present time, how
these plasticity mechanisms unfold in the concussed brain and if
they contribute to cognitive recovery following initial trauma.
Developing a diagnostic tool for concussion history
The quest for in vivo biomarkers is ubiquitous in modern clinical
sciences (http://www.biomarkersconsortium.org/). Biomarkers allow
developing diagnostic criteria that are based on objective measure-
ments and can predict the development of pathologies at an early
stage when therapeutical interventions are most efficient (Strimbu &
Tavel, 2010). Biomarkers are currently being used or developed for
neuropathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease
and many other neurological conditions (Kl€
oppel et al., 2008; Focke
et al., 2011; Salvatore et al., 2014). However, despite extensive
ex vivo descriptions of the potential effects of remote sports concus-
sion on brain structure (McKee et al., 2013, 2015; Kiernan et al.,
2015), there currently exists no reliable in vivo biological signature
of remote sports concussions. In the current study, with the help of
tools from machine learning, we provide a preliminarily biological
signature of remote sports concussions in our sample of ageing
retired athletes that could be used, following further validation, for
diagnostic
purposes
at
the
single
patient
level.

 mentioning that this biological signature is not composed of a single
biomarker identified at the group level, but rather, of a combination
of hundreds of features defining a multidimensional signature allow-
ing accurate classification at the individual level (Strimbu & Tavel,
2010; Salvatore et al., 2014). As new informative biomarkers
become available in this population, they should be added to this
signature to improve diagnostic accuracy. Recently, biomarkers from
task-free fMRI (Vergara et al., 2017) as well as serum Tau (Gill
et al., 2017) have shown good sensitivity in younger adults and
should be included in a future version of the tool.
Another unique
opportunity provided
by
this
computational
approach was the possibility to compare the accuracy of various
neuroimaging modalities in detecting the long-term effects of
sports concussions on the brain. This possibility stems from the
fact that each machine learning algorithm, regardless of what is
the input, will always project performance on the same commen-
surable scale (Quian Quiroga & Panzeri, 2009). Thus, in the cur-
rent study, we found that the best prediction value invariably
came from diffusion-weighted imaging of white matter integrity
and connectivity. This is important information not only regarding
the potential utility of various neuroimaging techniques in detect-
ing the effects of sports concussions, but it also provides novel
information about what are the most important features of the par-
ticular clinical entity we are still striving to describe. In this case,
our analysis suggests that white matter pathology is the most
potent hallmark of the underlying neuropathological process in
ageing retired athletes with a history of sports concussions. This
suggestion agrees with post-mortem observations of pathologically
confirmed CTE cases of deceased concussed athletes where white
matter anomalies are ubiquitous at early stages of disease progres-
sion despite normal gross neuropathological features and brain
weight (McKee et al., 2013). It is important to note, however,
that the lack of informative features extracted from genetic mark-
ers in our study is more likely to be explained by a lack of sta-
tistical power and allelic variability in our sample rather than a
true absence of predictive information.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have extended the description of the insidious
neuropathology associated with remote sports concussions. We
found that white matter connections between several brain regions
exhibited abnormal connectivity that might reflect both degenerative
and compensatory mechanisms. Importantly, because of our strin-
gent control over confounding factors such as APOE genotype,
depression, dementia or substance abuse, we increase the likelihood
that the history of remote sports concussions is driving the observed
deleterious effects on brain integrity rather than some other con-
founding factors. Finally, we attempted to go beyond the univariate
description of the neuropathology by integrating biomarkers from
various modalities to build an unbiased concussion detection tool
that could be used at the single patient level. Following further vali-
dation in different cohorts and on different MRI scanners, this
objective, MRI-based diagnostic tool could be used by medical
experts to rule out a history of mild head traumas in ageing patients
presenting with abnormal cognitive decline. Given its unbiased nat-
ure, this type of tool could also provide useful in legal cases oppos-
ing sports associations to retired players experiencing cognitive and
behavioral decline allegedly caused by remote sports concussions.
Finally, we believe further studies should also strive to examine pos-
sible links between this in vivo bio-signature of remote concussions
and the post-mortem characterizations of CTE.
