Abstract
The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture,
sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were
comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library,
Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Addi-
tional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data
extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model
under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-
quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved
the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treat-
ments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupunc-
ture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham
acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactu-
lose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tega-
serod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was
ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has
the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to
prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo
effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Poly-
ethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.
Introduction
Chronic constipation is a very common condition that can affect a patient’s quality of life.
Symptoms of constipation include decreased intestinal motility, stool consolidation, frequent
forced bowel movements, bloating, urge to defecate, and abdominal discomfort. [1] The

 proportion of people affected by chronic constipation varies widely, accounting for 0.7%-
29.6% of children and 2%-35% of adults in Europe [2]. The prevalence of chronic constipation
in North America is estimated to be 2% to 27% due to differences in the diagnostic criteria. [3]
Consultations for constipation account for 2.5 million visits per year in the United States [4].
Constipation is associated with a large financial burden to patients and the country; one study
showed that the cost for each patient during the diagnostic process of constipation was approx-
imately 2757 dollars [5]. Studies have shown that the causes of constipation include many fac-
tors such as diet, drugs, metabolic or neurological diseases, psychosocial factors, and disorders
of colonic motility and defecation. [6]
The methods of treating chronic constipation currently include drugs and acupuncture.
Common drugs include lactulose, polyethylene glycol, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl,
prucalopride, tegaserod, etc. But most of drugs have some side effects which couldn’t be toler-
ated by patients, complementary or alternative treating methods with less side effect are
needed in our practice. An increasing number of studies have shown that acupuncture may
have certain effects on chronic constipation. However, there have been no studies comparing
acupuncture and commonly used oral drugs. The comparison between drugs and acupuncture
will bring us a clear understanding of those interventions. Furthermore, various acupoints
have been targeted to treat chronic constipation. Therefore, this study was designed to solve
these unanswered questions.
This study was a systematic review of the literature and collected data from published ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and common oral drugs in the treatment of
chronic constipation up to December 2017. This study aimed to answer the following ques-
tions: (1) what are the curative effects and side effects of acupuncture and drugs to improve
chronic constipation?; (2) what is the curative effect of sham acupuncture as a placebo?; and
(3) what are the acupoints to cure constipation?
Materials and method
We followed the protocols based on the preferred reporting item[7,8] of the PRISMA(Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses) statement.
Research methods
We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and 4 Chinese databases [China
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, VIP Database and Chinese
Biomedical Database (CBM)] to conduct a comprehensive database retrieval, the retrieval time
is from the time of database building to February 2018. The following search keywords were
used: (lactulose, polyethylene glycol, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, tega-
serod), (randomized controlled trials or clinical trials), and (IBS-D) (see appendix). In addi-
tion, manual searches of the reference lists of review articles and meta-analyses were
conducted. No language restrictions were set.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included RCT and publications that met the following eligibility criteria: (i) clinical trials
of adult patients; (ii) clinical trials of single drugs; (iii) clinical trials with treatment duration
greater than two weeks; (iv) publications that were not comments or commentaries; and (v)
studies that excluded pregnant or lactating women, patients with peptic ulcers, rectal disease,
or liver or other systemic disease, and patients with previous history of gastroduodenal sur-
gery, neurologic diseases or neurologic surgery.

 Research options
Articles were independently screened by two researchers. Initially, the NoteExpress Software
(Beijing Aegean Sea Music Technology Co., Ltd.) was used to delete duplicate records. The
remaining summaries and full texts were reviewed based on the above inclusion and exclusion
criteria, and disagreements were resolved through discussion.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (Lingping Zhu and Xiaoyan Deng) independently extracted the relevant infor-
mation from each eligible study using a pre-prepared data extraction sheet. Data collected
included the location and study design of the trials, clinical characteristics of the patients,
number of patients, patient age, diagnostic methods, treatment duration, outcome data, and
side effects. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Jadad Scale, which is
based on the following three factors: randomized (2 points), double-blinded (2 points) and
withdrawals and drop-outs (1 point) [9]. A Jadad score of 3 or higher was considered high
quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improvement in chronic consti-
pation. Secondary outcomes were side effects and common acupuncture points. Common side
effects included constipation and rash.
Data synthesis and analysis
The assessments of acupuncture and drug efficacy were based on a combination of data
extracted from the included trials. Direct and indirect comparisons were performed for the
overall effect of acupuncture and medications. In thisNMA, we used a random-effects model
in a Bayesian framework. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to
analyse the effects of acupuncture and drugs on the efficacy of diarrhoea-predominant irritable
bowel syndrome. CIs with OR> 1.0 indicated statistically significant, and CIs not containing
1.0 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using the GeMTC
package generated by R software [10, 11].
Node-splitting models were used to assess the consistency of theNMA to test whether the
results of the direct and indirect comparisons were consistent within the treatment cycle [12].
However, In the absence of direct or indirect comparison results, the node-splitting model
could not be executed. Therefore, we used statistic analysis to quantify the degree of heteroge-
neity using I2 calculations. I2 > 50% was considered heterogeneous. To verify the robustness
of the results, sensitivity analyses were performed in each study and recalculating the overall
effect to see the individual effect of each factor.
A mesh diagram, contribution graphs, and publication bias tests were performed using
STATA 14.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
1. Characteristics of the included studies
A total of 1516 articles were obtained from the literature search. After reviewing the literature,
36 duplicates were deleted. After reviewing the inclusion criteria, 1438 articles were excluded.
Finally, a total of 40 trials were identified (Fig 1) and are listed in S1 Table [13–51].
A total of 11032 patients with chronic constipation were enrolled across all studies. The
studies investigated a total of 10 treatment modalities including A: prucalopride; B: tegaserod;
C: lubiprostone; D linaclotide E: bisacodyl; F: PEG; G: lactulose; H: acupuncture; I: sham acu-
puncture; and J: placebo (sucrose, etc.). There were 12 articles from China, 11 articles from the

 2. Routine paired meta-analysis
Compared with placebo, acupuncture significantly improved the symptoms of chronic con-
stipation (OR: 9.4, 95% CI: 3.6–9.7) (Fig 2). Polyethylene glycol, lactulose, and linaclotide
also improved the symptoms of chronic constipation compared to placebo (OR: 6.5, 95%
CI: 3.8–12.0; OR: 4.4, 95% CI: 2.0–9.7; and OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 2.4–6.4, respectively) (Fig 2).
Compared with placebo, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, and prucalopride also improved the
symptoms of chronic constipation (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 2.1–6.6; OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.5–7.2; and
OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0–3.8, respectively) (Fig 2). Sham acupuncture also improved the symp-
toms of chronic constipation compared to placebo (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1–9.3). The effect of
tegaserod was non-significant to that of placebo (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.90–3.1, I2 = 0.0%)

 When acupuncture and oral medications were compared, the curative effect of oral medica-
tions was worse than that of acupuncture (for more details, see Fig 2). The I2 for polyethyl-
ene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, Bisacodyl and prucalopride compared with
placebo are respectively 73.7%, 0%, 51.7%, 69.1%, 0% and 64.3%.
2. The cumulative probability ranking
By cumulative probability ranking, patients with chronic constipation were sorted by those
receiving needle acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl,
prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo. Given that the probability distribu-
tions of linaclotide, lubiprostone, and bisacodyl were similar, we used the probability of the high-
est ranking. It was found that the efficacy of acupuncture was much higher than that of drugs
(P = 0.75) and the efficacy of polyethylene glycol was higher (P = 0.50) than other drugs, includ-
ing lactulose (P = 0.28), linaclotide (P = 0.20), lubiprostone (P = 0.23), bisacodyl (P = 0.16), pru-
calopride (P = 0.32), tegaserod (P = 0.70), and placebo (P = 0.93) (Fig 3 and S2 Table).
Twenty-two out of the 40 studies provided data regarding side effects (S1 Table). One study
on acupuncture reported side effect data, while the other studies of acupuncture reported no
side effects of acupuncture or sham acupuncture. The NMA cannot analyse isolated data so the
side effects for acupuncture or sham acupuncture were not included in the final analysis.
Twenty-one studies reported data on side effects of the remaining eight treatments (see S1
Table). Acupuncture had the fewest side effects, as there are not many known side effects, fol-
lowed by mild side effects of tegaserod (P = 0.51) and linaclotide (P = 0.47). There were more

 side effects from lactulose (P = 0.55) and lubiprostone (P = 0.49) than other drugs. The side
effects of the drugs are listed in Fig 4 and S3 Table.
3. Network diagrams
We compared all of the included studies and drew network diagrams with the studies incorpo-
rated into quality-based displays on a network map. (Fig 5).
4. Acupuncture preference points
Regarding the different acupuncture points selected for each study, we identified the most
commonly used acupoints, including ST-25; the use of ST25 acupoints were counted 12 times
compared to other acupoints which were 4 times at most (Table 1).
5. Brooks-Gelman-Rubin diagnostic plot, density plot, node-splitting plot
and cumulative contribution plot
By performing 20,000 convergence iterations, we obtained a Brooks-Gelman-Rubin diagnostic
plot, and the track density map was acceptable; based on the node-splitting model, we found
all studies in the region beneath the 4th line. We also obtained a cumulative contribution map
from the STATA software (S1, S2, S3, and S4 Figs).

 6. Heterogeneity
Using heterogeneity analysis, we found that polyethylene glycol, linaclotide, lubiprostone, and
prucalopride had significant heterogeneity; based on the sensitivity analysis, we corrected the
OR for polyethylene glycol (OR: 3.92, 95% CI: 2.70–5.71, I2 = 37%), linaclotide (OR: 3.11, 95%
CI: 2.33–4.16, I2 = 0.0%), lubiprostone (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.93–4.05, I2 = 16%), and prucalo-
pride (OR: 2.78, 95% CI: 2.34–3.29, I2 = 48%). No large directional change occurred even after
corrections (S5 and S6 Figs).

Using the funnel plot, all included studies were compared on a pairwise basis, and all studies
were found to be essentially symmetrical, indicating a small publication bias (Fig 6).
Discussion
By including more than 40 articles for network meta-analysis(NMA), acupuncture was found
to be more effective than drugs in treating chronic constipation with nearly no side effects.
The mechanism of action of acupuncture for the treatment of chronic constipation remains
unclear, but previous studies have also shown its possible role in the treatment of chronic con-
stipation. An important cause of chronic constipation is the decreased motility of the colon,
resulting in a decreased urge to defecate, bloating, and abdominal pain or discomfort. [51]
Existing studies indicate that acupuncture at heterotopic acupoints facilitates distal colonic
motor ability by activating M3 receptors and somatic afferent C-fibres in normal, constipated,
or diarrhoeic rats. Acupuncture can also increase distal colonic motility in normal and

 abnormal mice with a possible role of M3 receptors [52]. Previous studies have suggested that
the ST36 acupoint can change the motor function of the colon. [53]
However, a previous meta-analysis showed no significant curative benefits of acupuncture
compared with sham acupuncture in the treatment of chronic constipation. Only some studies
from China have shown that acupuncture is superior to drugs. [54] A previous study from
China showed that acupuncture and sham acupuncture had similar effects on functional con-
stipation, but moxibustion was used with ST23 and ST27 acupoints in this study. Moreover,
this study was based on a small sample size [55], and therefore, we are unable to ensure the
accuracy of these findings. In addition, the curative effect of sham acupuncture remains to be
confirmed.
Our study was unique in that the included studies of acupuncture used the deep pricking
method instead of the ordinary acupuncture method. The depth of the deep pricking method
is deeper than that of ordinary acupuncture method. Further studies are needed to confirm
whether the deep pricking method has a better curative effect on chronic constipation than
ordinary acupuncture. In the present study, many studies conducted after 2012 were included
and the studies using the same acupuncture points were included to ensure consistency. RCTs
using consistent acupuncture points will yield more definitive results. However, the therapeu-
tic effect of acupuncture in this study was based on the indirect curative effect of lactulose
compared with placebo, and further studies are needed to investigate the direct effects of acu-
puncture and placebo.
A previous network meta-analysis of idiopathic constipation showed that the primary cura-
tive effect (> 3 CSBM(complete spontaneous bowel movement)per week or 1 CSBM greater
than baseline per week) is similar between prucalopride, velusetrag, tegaserod, lubiprostone,
elobixibat, bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate and linaclotide. As the secondary outcome, bisacodyl
was found to be more efficacious than other drugs (including continuity or qualitative indica-
tors) but was accompanied by side effects [56]. However, the previous study did not rank the
side effects. In our study, five additional commonly used drugs (prucalopride, tegaserod, lubi-
prostone, bisacodyl, and linaclotide) were included and polyethylene glycol, lactulose, acu-
puncture and sham acupuncture were compared, as they are frequently used in our daily
clinical practice. We analysed not only the curative efficacy but also side effects.
This study showed that the efficacy of polyethylene glycol is second only to acupuncture,
and the side effects are minimal. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 week to 24
weeks, covering long-term and short-term efficacy and side effects, and its effects were rela-
tively positive. The acupuncture intervention time was relatively short in the majority of stud-
ies, so the comparison of long-term efficacy between acupuncture and polyethylene glycol
requires further investigation. At the same time, this study did not distinguish between poly-
ethylene glycol with or without electrolytes, but previous studies have shown that their efficacy
is similar. [57]
This study also showed that the clinical effect of lactulose is acceptable, but the side effect
profile is relatively unfavourable, including bloating and abdominal pain, but without serious
adverse reactions. Because there was no direct comparison of side effects between lactulose
and placebo, an indirect comparison to polyethylene glycol was conducted, which may have
led to an overestimation of the real side effect profile of lactulose. Previous studies have shown
that polyethylene glycol is superior to lactulose in the treatment of chronic constipation [58],
which is consistent with the findings of the current study.
This study showed that the side effects of lubiprostone were more serious than those of lina-
clotide, prucalopride and bisacodyl, all of which were based on a direct comparison of side
effects and were of clinical significance. At the same time, this study found that the curative
effect of sham acupuncture was better than tegaserod, indicating that sham acupuncture may

 have some therapeutic effect, although it is based on an indirect comparison. In the past, many
studies used sham acupuncture as a control group, but it is possible that the curative effect of
acupuncture is underestimated because sham acupuncture has some curative effects. Related
studies on the therapeutic effect of sham acupuncture have been conducted. [59]
This study also found that nearly all of the studies on acupuncture and chronic constipation
used ST25 acupoints, while previous studies showed that ST25, ST36, L111, and BL25 may also
have some beneficial effects on the motility of the distal colon. However, ST25 showed no
effect on the distal colon of diarrhoea model rats [53]. The mechanism underlying the effects
of different acupoints remains to be confirmed by further studies.
This study has several disadvantages. First, there were no direct comparisons between acu-
puncture and placebo and sham acupuncture and placebo. Second, the number of included
studies for some drugs is small, and some study populations were regional, nearly 30%
included articles were from China Some studies also lacked data on drug safety. All of these
limitations lead to publication bias and may have impacted the results of our study. Third, the
outcome of this study was the proportion of patients with overall symptom improvement.
Fourth, the jaded score for risk assessment is relatively old. Lastly, this study did not include a
comparison of short-term and long-term efficacy or consider time of disease onset or duration
of disease. Such limitations lead to a certain gap in the clinical application of the findings of
this study.
Conclusions
In summary, this study found that acupuncture may be a good treatment option for chronic
constipation with minimal side effects, but quality studies are still needed to support our find-
ings. The curative effect of sham acupuncture should be further studied. Furthermore, polyeth-
ylene glycol is an acceptable treatment option with good curative effect and few side effects.
