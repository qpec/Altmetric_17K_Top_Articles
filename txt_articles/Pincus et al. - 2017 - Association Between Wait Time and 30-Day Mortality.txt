IMPORTANCE Although wait times for hip fracture surgery have been linked to mortality and
are being used as quality-of-care indicators worldwide, controversy exists about the duration
of the wait that leads to complications.
OBJECTIVE To use population-based wait-time data to identify the optimal time window
in which to conduct hip fracture surgery before the risk of complications increases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based, retrospective cohort study of adults
undergoing hip fracture surgery between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2014, at 72 hospitals in
Ontario, Canada. Risk-adjusted restricted cubic splines modeled the probability of each
complication according to wait-time. The inflection point (in hours) when complications
began to increase was used to define early and delayed surgery. To evaluate the robustness
of this definition, outcomes among propensity-score matched early and delayed surgical
patients were compared using percent absolute risk differences (RDs, with 95% CIs).
EXPOSURE Time elapsed from hospital arrival to surgery (in hours).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included
a composite of mortality or other medical complications (myocardial infarction, deep vein
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia).
RESULTS Among 42 230 patients with hip fracture (mean [SD] age, 80.1 years [10.7], 70.5%
women) who met study entry criteria, overall mortality at 30 days was 7.0%. The risk of
complications increased when wait times were greater than 24 hours, irrespective of the
complication considered. Compared with 13 731 propensity-score matched patients who
received surgery earlier, 13 731 patients who received surgery after 24 hours had a
significantly higher risk of 30-day mortality (898 [6.5%] vs 790 [5.8%]; % absolute RD, 0.79;
95% CI, 0.23-1.35) and the composite outcome (1680 [12.2%]) vs 1383 [10.1%]; % absolute
RD, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.43-2.89).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, increased
wait time was associated with a greater risk of 30-day mortality and other complications.
A wait time of 24 hours may represent a threshold defining higher risk.

xpedited hip fracture surgery for increasing numbers of
patients1whomaybemedicallycomplexandmostcom-
monly receive surgery outside regular working hours2
involves several different medical and surgical specialists,
hospital administrators, and allied staff.3 Despite resources ex-
pended toward performing surgery earlier4 and extensive re-
search on the topic,5 controversy remains about the accept-
able waiting time for treatment. Guidelines from the United
States6 and Canada7 recommend surgery within 48 hours.
The proportion of patients receiving surgery within 36 hours
is the quality-of-care indicator used in the United Kingdom,
but hospital adherence ranges from 14.7% to 95.3%.8
Variable policy and adherence to guidelines are the re-
sult, in part, of inconsistent empirical evidence for a time-to-
surgery threshold.3 Confounding by indication may exagger-
atetheeffectofearlysurgery,9withmedicallycomplexpatients
being predisposed to both complications and awaiting opti-
mization prior to surgery. Wait times have also been mea-
sured imprecisely in days10,11 and arbitrarily divided into early
and delayed groups,12-14 decreasing statistical power to find
differences.15 The calculation of precise inpatient surgical wait
times, in hours rather than days, is possible in Ontario, Canada,
for all surgical procedures in the province. The objective of this
study was to use these data at the population level to estab-
lish a time-to-surgery threshold before the risk of complica-
tions increases.
Methods
Data Sources and Setting
A population-based cohort study was conducted using health
administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. Ontario resi-
dentshavetheirmedicallynecessaryhealthcareservices,phy-
sician and hospital information, and demographic character-
istics recorded in these databases. These data are held and
linked at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES;
http://www.ices.on.ca)andhavebeenusedpreviouslytostudy
patients with hip fractures (eAppendix A in the Supplement).2
The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board
at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario.
Individual patient informed consent is not required for use of
encoded administrative health data in Ontario.
Patients
Adults undergoing hip fracture surgery in Ontario between
April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2014, were eligible. The begin-
ning of the accrual period was selected when a variable mea-
suring exact surgical wait times was introduced.16 Accrual
endedtoallowfor1yearoffollow-up(uptothefinaldateMarch
31, 2015) after the date of initial hospitalization (index date).
Similar diagnostic and procedure codes previously used to
identifypatientswithahipfracturewhohadexperiencedcom-
plications after orthopedic surgery were retained (eAppen-
dix B in the Supplement).2
Non-Ontario residents, those dead on or before their in-
dexdate,electivehospitaladmissions,thosewithpriorhipfrac-
ture(s) back to 2002, and patients without hospital arrival time
datawereexcludedduetotheirmissingdata,potentialformis-
classification, or both. Other exclusion criteria identified rare
cases, unrepresentative of most hip fractures from a clinical
perspective: age younger than 45 years,3 extreme surgical de-
lays(>10days),andsurgeryperformedbyanonorthopedicsur-
geon or at a hospital with fewer than 5 hip fracture surgeries
during the study period. Hip fractures occurring while pa-
tients were in the hospital also were excluded because surgi-
cal delays for these patients could not be operationalized using
available data (Table 1).
Main Exposure
The primary independent variable was the wait time for sur-
gery and defined as the total time elapsed from emergency de-
partment arrival until surgery (in hours). To capture the time
that elapsed during transfer between hospitals, all contigu-
ous hospitalizations from the earliest hospital arrival time to
the date and time of surgery were assessed.17
Covariates
Patient characteristics previously shown to explain most of
the variation in mortality after hip fracture surgery were
measured including age, sex, and medical comorbidity
(Table 2).18 Medical comorbidity was estimated using 3 vali-
dated tools based on each patient’
s health care utilization in
the 5 years prior to the index date: (1) the Deyo-Charlson
Comorbidity Index classified hospital discharge diagnoses,19
(2) the Johns Hopkins Collapsed Aggregated Diagnosis
Groups categorized hospitalizations and outpatient physician
visits,20 and (3) previously validated algorithms that identi-
fied patients with a specific diagnoses (ie, frailty, diabetes,
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD], congestive heart failure [CHF], coronary artery dis-
ease [CAD], or dementia [eAppendix A in the Supplement]).
Associated conditions at the time of hospital presentation
also were assessed: osteomyelitis, bone cancer, other frac-
tures, total hip arthroplasty in the prior 5 years, and multiple
trauma (defined as an Injury Severity Score ≥16).
Medianneighborhoodhouseholdincomequintilewasused
as a proxy for socioeconomic status.21 Patients directly trans-
ferred from other health care institutions (long-term care,
for example), each patient’
s discharge disposition, and those
residing in rural areas were identified.22 Each procedure’
s
type, duration, and timing (working hours, weekdays be-
tween 7 AM and 5 PM; evening or weekend, 5 PM to 12 AM on a
weekday or 7 AM to 12 PM over the weekend; or overnight, any
day from 12 AM to 7 AM) were recorded.2
Key Points
Question What is the association between wait time and 30-day
mortality in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study that included 42 230
adults, wait time longer than 24 hours was associated with higher
risk-adjusted likelihood of 30-day mortality (6.5% vs 5.8%).
Meaning A wait time of 24 hours may represent a threshold of
increased risk for delaying hip fracture surgery.

 Index surgeon- and hospital-related factors were as-
signed at time of each patient’
s operation. These included
(1) years since each surgeon’
s Canadian orthopedic certifica-
tion (surgeon experience) and (2) the number of hip fracture
procedures performed in the year preceding the index event
(surgeon and hospital volume). Each hospital’
s capacity
for performing nonelective surgery was operationalized as
the mean daily number of any nonelective (or urgent) proce-
dures performed at the hospital, orthopedic or otherwise, in
the year preceding the index event. Hospitals were also cat-
egorized as either academic or community based on their
membership in the Council of Academic Hospitals of Ontario
(http://www.cahohospitals.com). Community hospitals
were further classified as large (≥400 beds) or small to medium
(<400 beds).23
Outcomes
The primary outcome was mortality within 30 days of being
admitted for hip fracture surgery. A 30-day observation
window is the most common follow-up period measured in
literature3,5,24 and considers the temporal association be-
tween surgical delay and the development of complications.
Longer follow-up at 90 and 365 days was considered in sec-
ondary analyses.
Medical complications within 30, 90, and 365 days,
as well as a composite of mortality or any medical com-
plication, were assessed as secondary outcomes. Medical
complications considered were myocardial infarction,
deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumo-
nia. Surgical complications (hardware removal and postop-
erative hip dislocation) presumed to be unrelated to wait
times were assessed as negative tracer outcomes intended to
test the specificity of the findings (see the Sensitivity Analy-
ses section).25
Statistical Analysis
Risk-adjusted,restrictedcubicsplineswith4knots26wereused
to model the probability of complications according to the
timeelapsedfromemergencydepartmentarrivaltosurgery.Any
nonlinear relationship between surgical delay and each out-
come could be assessed using spline regression, which makes
nounderlyingassumptionsaboutafunctionalform.Ratherthan
arbitrarily dividing patients into early and delayed surgery
groups,15 the association between surgical delay and mortality
was graphically represented to visualize an inflection point
(in hours), if one existed, when complications began to rise.
At time thresholds around the area of inflection, the area un-
der the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated
for adjusted logistic regression models relating surgical delay
to 30-day mortality. The time (in hours) producing the maxi-
mum area under the curve increase was selected as the thresh-
oldtodichotomizetimeandclassifypatientsasreceivingeither
early or delayed surgery.27 To further evaluate the robustness
of this definition, early and delayed patients were matched 1:1
without replacement28 on the logit of propensity scores.29
Restricted cubic spline, logistic regression, and propen-
sityscoremodelswerealladjustedforthesamecovariates:age,
sex, year, income quintile, rurality, transfer from any health
care institution, medical comorbidity, fracture and surgery
type, Injury Severity Score, surgeon volume and experience,
hospital volume and type, and surgery duration. Variables
thought to be confounders based on existing literature18 and
clinical judgment were included. Mediators of delay unre-
lated to mortality (such as surgery timing)2 and common ef-
fects of the relationship between delay and mortality (such as
discharge disposition) were not included as variables in the
models.30 Missing data, which was less than 1% for all vari-
ables considered, were excluded from regression models.
Baselinecohortcharacteristicswerereportedasmeans(SDs)
and proportions as appropriate and compared using standard-
ized mean differences to avoid identifying spurious statistical
associations in the large administrative data set. Standardized
differences of more than 0.1 were considered indicative of
imbalance.31 The McNemar test compared outcomes in early
and delayed groups after matching and generalized estimat-
ing equations (GEEs) calculated percent absolute risk differ-
ences (% absolute risk difference [RD], with 95% CIs).
Sensitivity Analyses
Several prespecified sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Splines were generated in patient subgroups stratified by sex,
medical comorbidity, hospital type, and timing of presenta-
tion to determine whether the identified time threshold was
consistent across patient subgroups.17,18 Prespecified falsifi-
cation hypotheses tested specificity of the findings.25 Be-
cause medication data were only available for patients older
than 65 years in the Ontario databases, a sensitivity analysis
restricted to these patients adjusted for blood thinner pre-
scriptions within the year before surgery.32
Two post hoc sensitivity analyses were also conducted.
Prolonged wait times may indicate medical, rather than
administrative, reasons for delay and even greater confound-
ing. Therefore, an analysis restricted to patients’receiving

 All analyses were performed at ICES using SAS statistical
software version 9.3 and Enterprise Guide version 6.1 (SAS In-
stitute Inc) and a 2-sided type I error probability of .05.
Results
There were a total of 42 230 patients who met inclusion
(Table 1) and were treated by 522 orthopedic surgeons at 72
Ontario hospitals. Their mean (SD) age was 80.1 (10.7) years,
and 70.5% were women (Table 2). The mean (SD) time to sur-
gery was 38.8 (28.8) hours. Adjusted splines modeled an area
of inflection around 24 hours when the risk of developing
complications began to increase, irrespective of the outcome
or follow-up period assessed (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Surgical
complications (dislocation, hardware removal) were not
related to wait-time (Figure 2). The maximum area under the
curve increase occurred when using 24 hours to classify
patients into early or delayed surgery groups compared with
6-, 12-, 18-, 30- and 36-hour thresholds (eAppendix D in the
Supplement). Delayed hip fracture surgery was therefore
defined as surgery occurring more than 24 hours after emer-
gency department arrival.
According to this definition, 14 174 patients (33.6%) re-
ceived early surgery and 28 056 patients (66.4%) received
delayed surgery. Before matching, patients receiving delayed
surgery were significantly more likely to be men, have medi-
cal comorbidity, arrive from other health care institutions, and
be treated at academic or higher-volume centers (Table 2).
There were 13 731 ( ≅ 97%) patients in the early surgery group
matched to those in the delayed group, and covariates were
balanced between groups after matching (including those vari-
ables with missing categories).
Of the 13 731 matched patients who received hip fracture
surgery after 24 hours, 898 patients (6.5%) died within 30 days
vs 790 patients (5.8%) of 13 731 who received surgery within
24 hours, for an absolute risk difference of 0.79% (95% CI,
0.23%-1.35%); 166 (1.2%) vs 96 (0.7%) had pulmonary embo-
lism, for an absolute risk difference of 0.51% (95% CI, 0.28%-
0.74%); 160 (1.2%) vs 107 (0.8%) had myocardial infarction, for
an absolute risk difference of 0.39% (95% CI, 0.15%-0.62%);
and 637 (4.6%) vs 506 (3.7%) had pneumonia, for an absolute
risk difference of 0.95% (95% CI, 0.48%-1.43%). For the com-
posite outcome, 1680 patients (12.2%) vs 1383 (10.1%) died
within 30 days for an absolute risk difference of 2.16% (95%
CI,1.43%-2.89%).Outcomesremainedsignificantat90and365
days (Table 3).
Mortality due to deep venous thrombosis was not signifi-
cantly different between groups at 30 days with 136 patients
(1.0%) who did not undergo surgery for more than 24 hours vs
111 patients (0.8%) who received it within 24 hours for an ab-
solute risk difference of 0.18% (95% CI, −0.04% to 0.40%). The
same held true at 90 days with 190 patients (1.4%) vs 169 pa-
tients (1.2%) for an absolute risk difference of 0.15% (95% CI,
−0.11% to 0.42%) and at 365 days 259 (1.9%) vs 255 (1.9%) for
anabsoluteriskdifferenceof0.03%(95%CI,−0.29%to0.35%).
The relationships between wait times and complications
were robust to stratification among different patient sub-
groups, including among patients without comorbidity and
those receiving surgery within 36 hours, for whom confound-
ing by indication should not play a role (eAppendices C and G
in the Supplement). There was no significant difference in sur-
gicalcomplications(negativetraceroutcomes)betweengroups
(Table 3). Sensitivity analysis restricted to patients older than
65 years and adjusting for antiplatelet or anticoagulant medi-
cations also produced equivalent results (eAppendix E in the

 Supplement). Although unmatched patients in the delayed
group were more medically complex than matched patients,
adjusted regression found no significant association be-
tween matching status and 30-day mortality indicating no re-
sidual confounding in the matched delayed group (eAppen-
dix F in the Supplement).
Discussion
Among adults undergoing hip fracture surgery in Ontario,
Canada, increased wait time was associated with a greater
risk of 30-day mortality and other complications. Although
several studies have linked wait times for hip fracture sur-
gery to mortality and morbidity,5 inconsistent evidence
for a time-to-surgery threshold has translated to variable
guideline recommendations and compliance with wait-time
benchmarks.6-8
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to analyze time
as a continuous variable in hours and empirically identify a
time-to-surgery threshold associated with increased compli-
cations after hip fracture. The primary finding pertains to
increasing numbers of patients experiencing hip fractures
and the different medical and surgical specialists treating
them: a wait time of 24 hours may represent a threshold
defining higher risk because complications increased when
surgery was delayed after this time, irrespective of the com-
plication, follow-up period, or patient subgroup assessed.
Preoperative optimization is often required for patients with
a hip fracture and can feasibly be performed within the

 proposed timeframe. Because wait times for hip fracture sur-
gery are already used worldwide as quality indicators to
assess hospital performance, the results of this study may
inform existing hip fracture care guidelines and policies.6-8
Targeting surgery within 24 hours represents a sig-
nificant change in practice because 66% of the patients in
this study did not receive surgery within this timeframe.
Hip fracture prioritization must also be balanced with the
needs of patients on waiting lists for other surgical proce-
dures. Because time to surgery rather than timing of sur-
gery is associated with increased risk,2 continuing to conduct
hip fracture operations during evenings and weekends
may help reduce wait times for hip fracture surgery with-
out conflicting with elective operations. However, other per-
formance improvement efforts will be required, as well
as future work that identifies where these efforts would be
most successfully targeted. Although effect modification was
not observed in subgroup analyses, given the practical chal-
lenges of further reducing existing thresholds, future work
may continue trying to identify a subset most in need of
urgent surgery.
This study has several strengths. First, a population-
based sample from Ontario’
s diverse population of ap-
proximately 13.5 million was used. Findings are generaliz-
able to other jurisdictions, including the United States11
and Europe,14 where operating room resources are lim-
ited and patients are required to wait for hip fracture surgery.
Second and third, the study was conducted in a public health
care system where patients can be followed up for complica-
tions even if they present elsewhere in the system and surgi-
cal delays are mostly related to administrative rather than pa-
tient factors.33
Fourth, rather than arbitrarily dividing patients into early
and delayed surgery groups,12-14,34 exact time-to-surgery data
(in hours) and spline regression were used to empirically
define a threshold for increased risk. Observational research
is required to determine a time-to-surgery threshold because
investigators likely consider it unethical and impractical to
allocate patients to increasing thresholds of delayed surgery
in this way.5 The Hip Fracture Accelerated Surgical Treatment
and Care Track (HIP ATTACK) trial will compare standard of
care treatment to surgery performed much earlier than this
(ie, within 6 hours of hospital arrival)3 and may provide
important estimates of the effect of early surgery in the
absence of confounding by indication. However, the study
will not assess whether delays greater than 6 hours but less
than the standard of care are acceptable.
Limitations
This study also has several limitations. First, since medically
complex patients are predisposed to both complications
and awaiting optimization prior to surgery, several analyses
were performed to mitigate the influence of confounding.
Comparisons between early and delayed surgery groups
after matching were balanced across more than 30 covari-
ates, which included detailed measures of preexisting medi-
cal comorbidity. The absence of effect modification in sev-
eral important clinical scenarios was also demonstrated in
subgroup analyses, including those restricted to patients with-
out comorbidity and those receiving surgery within 36 hours
for whom surgical delays should be administrative. However,
the finding that increased wait time is associated with in-
creased risk may still be influenced by unmeasured factors.
Second, other complications were not considered that
may be clinically important in this population and potentially
related to waiting for surgery, such as major bleeding.3 Out-
comes were chosen based on their being (1) important clinical
priorities, (2) plausibly related to the primary exposure,35 and
(3) identifiable by validated codes (see eAppendix B in the
Supplement).36 Future study is required to assess whether
misclassification of fat embolism as pulmonary embolism,
the more salient diagnosis, may explain the significant differ-
ence observed in pulmonary embolism between groups,
whereas a difference in deep vein thrombosis was not
detected. Although patient reported outcomes were not
assessed, it may be assumed that expedited hip fracture sur-
gery is patient centered and would be appreciated by patients
and their families, other processes of care being equal.37
Third, patients with nonoperative hip fracture were also not
considered because those who died waiting for surgery could
not be distinguished from those for whom nonoperative
treatment was indicated. However, experiencing a major
complication while waiting for surgery precluded the former
patients from entering the cohort, leading to more conserva-
tive estimates of the effect of waiting for surgery.
Conclusions
Among adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, increased wait
time was associated with a greater risk of 30-day mortality and
other complications. A wait time of 24 hours may represent a
threshold defining higher risk. Because two-thirds of pa-
tients did not receive surgery within this timeframe, perfor-
mance improvement is warranted.
