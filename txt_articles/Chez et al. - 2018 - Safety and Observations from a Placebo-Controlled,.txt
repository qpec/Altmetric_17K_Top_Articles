ABSTRACT
The aim of this exploratory study was to assess the safety and clinical effects of autologous umbili-
cal cord blood (AUCB) infusion in children with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-
nine children 2 to 6 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized,
blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Participants were randomized to receive AUCB or pla-
cebo, evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, received the opposite infusion, then re-evaluated at
the same time points. Evaluations included assessments of safety, Expressive One Word Picture
Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Clinical
Global Impression, Stanford-Binet Fluid Reasoning and Knowledge, and the Vineland Adaptive
Behavior and Socialization Subscales. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effects of
the response variables at the 12- and 24-week time periods under each condition (AUCB, placebo).
There were no serious adverse events. There were trends toward improvement, particularly in
socialization, but there were no statistically significant differences for any endpoints. The results of
this study suggest that autologous umbilical cord infusions are safe for children with ASD. Tightly
controlled trials are necessary to further progress the study of AUCB for autism.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
There is no single medical cause for autism, and there are very few controlled studies. This
research suggests that stem cells from autologous cord blood are safe and potentially have an
impact on socialization for children with autism. The safety and observed changes warrant fur-
ther investigation into the potential for cellular therapy as an intervention in pediatric neuro-
logic conditions that do not require bone marrow replacement. This research provides insight
and suggestions for future research conducted using stem cells from autologous umbilical cord
to treat autism.
INTRODUCTION
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodeve-
lopmental disorder that affects 1:68 children in
the U.S. [1]. While there are treatments for
comorbid conditions as well as behavioral inter-
ventions for the core deficits, there is currently no
cure. Based on its definition, ASD symptoms
include deficits in communication and language
as well as social reciprocity, and self-stimulatory
or perseverate type behaviors [2]. These core fea-
tures may all reflect a lack of integrative commu-
nication between the different brain regions that
make up normal executive, social/emotional, and
communicative behaviors that define normal
development. ASD is a heterogeneous disorder
and multiple risk factors including genetic predis-
position, prenatal and postnatal environmental
exposures, and immune dysregulation may con-
tribute to its development [3–5]. Twin studies
have reported a higher concordance rate of ASD
in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic
twins, however the monozygotic twin concord-
ance rate is far less than 100% suggesting a dis-
tinct nongenetic contribution [6, 7]. Current
opinion suggests that ASD may result from the
occurrence of several risk factors. Immune factors
may be one important component of this theory.
Systemic immune dysfunction in individuals
with ASD has been reported in several publica-
tions; however, the exact dysfunction has been
variable [8]. This variability is to be expected in a

 heterogeneous disease with multiple potential etiologies such as
ASD. Maternal immune activation has been suggested as a poten-
tial environmental risk factor for developing ASD [3, 8]. In addi-
tion, post-mortem analysis of brains of individuals with ASD
indicated microglial activation and neuroinflammation [9, 10]. His-
torically, the brain has been considered to be immunologically
privileged, however a recent study suggested that lymphatic
endothelial cells line the dural sinuses in mice [11]. This might
explain findings from earlier studies suggesting that the central
nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance in the
meningeal compartment [12, 13].
Brain structure and connectivity in ASD may also be abnormal.
Post-mortem and brain MRI imaging studies have suggested that
a period of neuronal overgrowth and hyperconnectivity in early
childhood may be followed by hypo-connectivity later in life [9,
10]. Other studies have suggested that the brains in individuals
with ASD might have areas of both hypo and hyperconnectivity
[14]. Immune dysregulation including altered cytokine profiles, T-
cell and B-cell dysfunction, and in utero stress factors may alter
the fetal environment and change neuronal interaction and con-
nectivity via glial cell activity [8, 9, 15–22]. One study found that
the ratio of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in cerebrospinal
fluid versus serum may be elevated [19]. Other studies have
shown activated microglia and elevation of cytokines such as IL-6
and MCP-1 [9, 18]., Maternal and ASD subject serum circulating
autoantibodies have been described [20]. Prior studies have
examined the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), steroid
therapy, and specific medication for anti-inflammatory inhibition
of cytokines for immune dysfunction associated with ASD [17,
23–26]. Experience with immune dysfunction and ASD therapies
to date have highlighted the lack of consensus of what is the best
approach with standard medications. Direct cytokine inhibition in
animal models and in a human pilot study suggests a correlation
of reduced TNF-a and interleukin beta (IL-1b) with improved out-
comes [27].
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) contains a mixed population of
cells and is rich in hematopoietic stem cells.Theoretically, UCB has
the potential to regulate an abnormally activated immune system
which may potentially improve neuronal function [28–30]. Umbili-
cal cord tissue and UCB have also been used to regulate immune
dysfunction [31]. Preclinical studies have reported that cells from
intravenously infused human UCB can migrate to the parenchyma
of injured brain and alleviate neurological impairment in animal
models of perinatal brain injury [32–34]. The demonstrated func-
tional improvements were not due to cell differentiation and
repopulation, but rather are hypothesized to be a transient para-
crine effect of the infused cells upon the host cells. One proposed
mechanism of action is that the donor cells secrete factors that
might promote endogenous repair and angiogenesis [35].
Currently, UCB has been used as a source of hematopoietic
stem cells in over 35,000 transplants worldwide for the treatment
of hematological and immunological conditions [36–38]. The use
of autologous UCB (AUCB) offers little risk of immune system reac-
tions. A pilot study assessing the safety of AUCB infusions in new-
born infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy reported that
the infusions were well tolerated and no adverse events were
reported [39]. In a separate study, 76 children with hydrocephalus
received up to four AUCB infusions and no infusion-related
adverse events were reported [40]. A publication describing AUCB
infusions in 184 infants and children with cerebral palsy, congeni-
tal hydrocephalus, or other brain injuries reported that 1.5% had
only mild hypersensitivity reactions (hives and/or wheezing) with
no additional adverse events reported up to 3 years later [41].
Considered overall, the research to date investigating AUCB
infusions has established safety in a variety of pediatric popula-
tions, however, the question of efficacy remains unanswered
because of a lack of studies conducted as randomized clinical trials
or that include control groups. A recent meta-review of four
randomized-controlled trials and one nonrandomized clinical trial
compared the use of different cell types in patients with cerebral
palsy. This analysis suggested a small statistically significant inter-
vention effect on gross motor scales with UCB being the most
effective compared with other cell types analyzed [42].
The current research and clinical experience has established a
sound rationale to support investigation of AUCB in patients with
ASD. [8, 30, 31, 43] The objective of this exploratory study was to
assess the safety of a single infusion of AUCB in subjects with ASD
and document changes in language, social behavior, and learning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled explora-
tory trial with treatment arm crossover at 24 weeks. Participants
were infused with either AUCB or placebo, evaluated at baseline,
12, and 24, weeks, infused with the opposite product, then eval-
uated again at 12 and 24 weeks post infusion. (Fig. 1) This study

 was approved by the Sutter Health Sacramento Institutional
Review Committee and registered at clinicaltrials.gov number
NCT01638819.
Participants
Eligible subjects were children ages 2 to 7 years with a diagnosis of
ASD based on DSM-IV-TR and the Autism Diagnostic Observational
Schedule (ADOS) administered by the neuropsychologist and corro-
borated by the Principal Investigator (PI). Participants were required
to have AUCB cryopreserved at Cord Blood Registry (CBR, South
San Francisco, CA) processed on the AutoXpress (AXP) Platform
(Cesca Therapeutics, Rancho Cordova, CA). Children with a diagno-
sis of Asperger or Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise
Specified were not eligible to participate. Review of the potential
subjects’ medical histories were completed to rule-out genetic con-
ditions or other potentially confounding medical diagnoses. Sub-
jects were required to have documentation of a normal karyotype,
Fragile X DNA testing, and chromosomal microarray analysis. Sub-
jects were also required to have 24 hours EEG studies within 6
months of baseline in order to define the population better and
determine if EEG abnormalities would change during the study.
Cord Blood Unit Criteria and Dosing
Cord blood units were required to meet the following criteria as
documented at the time of storage at CBR: post-processing total
nucleated cell (TNC) count at least 10 3 106/kg, viability> 85%,
negative sterility cultures, maternal infectious disease marker test-
ing performed and negative (HIV, Hepatitis B and C, HLTV, syphilis)
or, if not performed at time of unit storage, confirmed negative
through prenatal medical record review. The cord blood unit iden-
tity was confirmed via HLA typing of a cord blood test aliquot and
peripheral blood of the study subject prior to cord blood unit
release. ABO and Rh status were also reviewed as part of identity
verification. In addition, a cord blood aliquot was tested for TNC,
viability, colony forming unit, and CD341 cell count to confirm
potency prior to cord blood unit release. Cord blood units were
initially cryopreserved in a bag consisting of two compartments
with an 80%/20% volume configuration. Based on the total avail-
able TNC count, only a portion of the cord blood unit was required
to meet the minimum cell dose requirements of the study. Either
the 80% or 20% compartment was released from CBR for use in
the trial and the remainder of the unit remains in storage for
potential future use.
Subject Enrollment and Randomization
After informed consent and screening for eligibility, subjects were
enrolled in the study and randomized to a treatment arm. The
computerized randomization program assigned subjects 1:1 in
blocks of 4 to group A (infusion of AUCB first, infusion of 0.9%
saline placebo second) or group B (infusion of 0.9% saline placebo
first, infusion of AUCB second).
Cord Blood Unit Preparation and Administration
The cryopreserved cord blood units were shipped from CBR to the
local cell therapy laboratory in a dry shipper validated to maintain
appropriate temperature. Cord blood units remained cryopre-
served until the scheduled infusion date as indicated in the ran-
domization scheme. On the day of the AUCB infusion, the AUCB
product arrived at the pediatric infusion outpatient clinic via cou-
rier from the cryopreservation lab in a temperature monitored
dry-shipper.
Preparation
of
the
product
for
infusion
was
conducted in a room separate from study subjects and parents.
The blinded PI was not present for the infusion, but was present
for pre-infusion monitoring and post-infusion safety monitoring
on the following day.
In preparation for the AUCB infusion, authorized study person-
nel with knowledge and experience in transplant procedures
removed the product bag from the dry shipper, washed the sealed
product bag with chlorohexidine, and warmed the sample to 378C
in a sterile water bath. Once the AUCB product was thawed, the
unblinded transplant physician extracted the AUCB product from
the bag using a sterile syringe diluted with sterile saline to a total
volume of 50 ml. After standard blood filtration, the diluted product
was administered via peripheral IV site by direct injection via
syringe. A small sample of the AUCB product was saved for post-
thaw testing. Premedication of 0.5 mg/kg IV diphenhydramine
(Benadryl) was administered in 10 ml saline and dispensed as
50 mg/ml. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a cryoprotectant
agent for the AUCB during freezing and storage. Because DMSO
has a garlic-like odor, all subjects consumed garlic oil orally from a
syringe or mixed with food to preserve blinding. In addition, small
amounts of DMSO were placed in containers around the room to
produce the odor of DMSO during the infusion. The IV bag and line
were covered in cloth/tape to maintain blinding. Vital signs were
taken within 30 minutes before start of the IV and every 15 minutes
once the saline drip started until infusion (AUCB or placebo) was
completed, which took between 5 to 15 minutes. Additionally, sub-
jects were monitored for indications of adverse events and vital
signs were monitored every 15 minutes for 1 hour following the
infusion. Subjects were discharged after completion of the observa-
tion period if subjects were asymptomatic and showed no sign of
allergic reaction or unstable vital signs. Subjects returned for an out-
patient safety visit with the PI the day after the infusion to assess
for infusion-related side effects and obtain routine lab tests.
Post-Thaw Cord Blood Unit Testing
A small sample of the cord blood unit was sent on ice by courier
to the study laboratory to complete the following post-thaw test-
ing: sterility, % viability, CD341 cell counts, and for most cases,
CFU analysis. Toward the end of the study, the original lab used
for all AUCB testing closed which required processing subsequent
samples at a second lab. The second lab was unable to conduct
CFU analysis.
Endpoint Testing
Safety.
Evaluation of subject safety was conducted by obtaining
a complete blood count, comprehensive chemistry panel, and uri-
nalysis at the screening, safety, and follow-up visits. Safety end-
points included documentation of adverse events as reported by
the investigator at an office visit the day after the infusion. Parents
were also asked to keep a diary of any observed changes in behav-
ior, irritability, and language, which were discussed at the 12 and
24-week follow-up visits. Participants who had abnormal EEGs at
baseline had repeat EEGs at 12 and 24 weeks. Abnormalities had
to show specific bifrontal predominant generalized or focal spike
wave activity predominantly in temporal central parietal regions.
Primary Endpoints.
The primary outcome endpoints were the
Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition (EOWPVT-
4) and Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition
(ROWPVT-4). The EOWPVT-4 and ROWPVT-4 are standardized meas-
ures of single word comprehension and expression respectively.

 These co-normed tests are administered by a neuropsychologist and
allow comparisons of a child’s receptive and expressive vocabulary
skills.
Secondary Endpoints.
Secondary endpoints included: (a) Stan-
ford Binet, 5th edition Fluid Reasoning (SBFR) and Knowledge
(SBKN) subtests. These tests are administered by a neuropsychol-
ogist and provide a standardized assessment of verbal as well as
nonverbal cognitive abilities across the life span; (b) Vineland
Adaptive Behavior and Socialization Scales, 2nd edition for Com-
munication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Adaptive Behav-
ior Composite (ABC). These are questionnaires completed by a
parent or caregiver. Scores above 80 are classified using approxi-
mately the same ranges as IQ tests. Scores below 80 are catego-
rized as borderline adaptive functioning (70–80); mildly deficient
adaptive functioning (51–69); moderately deficient adaptive
behavior (36–50); severely deficient adaptive behavior; (20–35);
and markedly or profoundly deficient adaptive behavior (<20)
[44]. (c) Clinical Global Impression (CGI) subscales for Social,
Receptive, and Expressive skills as rated by the PI based on clini-
cal impressions. The baseline CGI is a measure of severity as
rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 7. For this study, severity was
categorized as minimal deficits (1–2.5), mild to moderate deficits
(3–4.5), and severe deficits in social receptive and expressive
speech functions (5.01). At each subsequent visit, the PI rated
patients on improvement from the previous visit on a scale of 1
to 7. For this study, improvement was categorized as improved
(�2.5), no change (3.0–3.5), and worse (4.01). Subjects under-
went in-person testing for these study endpoints at baseline 12,
and 24 weeks after infusion of each product.
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
Fifteen patients in each treatment group were calculated as nec-
essary to provide 84% power to detect a 7 (SD 5 9.1) unit advant-
age for AUCB over placebo on the primary endpoint of ROWPVT
(a 5 0.05, two-tailed) [45].
Histograms and normal probability plots were used to screen
the data for outliers and assess normality of individual variables.
Scatterplots, correlation coefficients, and means were used to
assess the association between post thaw CD34 and percent via-
bility with the primary endpoints. Generalized linear models were
used to compare differences between responses on primary and
secondary endpoints under the AUCB versus placebo conditions
using all available observations. Analyses included the repeated
effects of the response variables at the 12- and 24-week time peri-
ods after infusion of each product (AUCB, placebo). Group of
administration (AUCB first or placebo first) and the group X treat-
ment interaction were included in the model as fixed effects.
The analysis was designed to compare the mean difference as:
[12 and 24 week AUCB – baseline AUCB] 2 [12 and 24 week
placebo – baseline placebo]
A statistically significant interaction indicated presence of a
carryover effect, meaning that differences in the response variable
depended on administration group. For these variables, differen-
ces between the subjects that received AUCB first were compared
with the subjects who received placebo first and analysis of covari-
ance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the 12-week and 24-week
scores between the groups after adjusting for baseline scores.
Multiplicity was corrected for by controlling the false discovery
rate (FDR) at a level of 0.05 for groups of end points where there
was at least one statistically significant finding at the p < .05 level
[46]. Because this was an exploratory trial, both the raw p-values
and FDR p-values were reported.
RESULTS
Thirty subjects were randomized and all except one received both
infusions. One subject received the baseline infusion and was lost
to follow-up leaving 29 subjects with complete data on primary
and secondary endpoints. Table 1 provides the demographics and
information regarding the AUCB that was infused. Ninety five per-
cent of units tested post-thaw demonstrated CFU growth.
There was no association between 12- and 24-week EOWPVT
and ROWPVT scores and post thaw total viability or CD34 count
based on correlation coefficients and scatterplots. Stratification of
the post thaw CD34 at the median of 0.44 showed that subjects
who received an infusion above the median had lower baseline
scores than subjects who received an infusion that was below the
mean. However, there was little change over time between

 participants within a stratum. For example, ROWPVT scores for
participants who received an infusion that was below the median
were 82.64 6 30.55 at baseline, 81.71 6 26.56 after 12 weeks,
and 84.79 624.74 after 24 weeks. ROWPVTscores for participants
who received an infusion with a CD34 percent above the median
were 76.80 6 21.26 at baseline, 76.40 6 20.37 after 12 weeks,
and 76.40 619.23 after 24 weeks.
Safety
Table 2 shows the reported AEs and the likely relatedness of the
events to the AUCB infusion. No adverse events required treat-
ment. There were no observed allergic reactions or serious
adverse events associated with the administration of AUCB. Nine
of the 29 participants had abnormal baseline 24 hours EEG ambu-
latory results within 6 months of baseline.This reflects about aver-
age the percent of abnormal EEG percentage range found in this
age group in other studies (30%–60%). There were no observed
changes in EEGs at 12 or 24 weeks for subjects when in either
group for patients who had abnormal EEGs at baseline.
Clinical Global Impression
Table 3 shows the CGI baseline severity scores and number and
percent in each improvement category at the 12- and 24-week
visits. Baseline CGI severity and expressive, receptive, and social
improvement were similar for both groups.
Primary and Secondary Endpoints
Figure 2A (EOWPVT) and 2B (ROWPVT) show the means for
each group throughout their time in the study. Figure 3A
through 3E display the means for the EOWPVT (Panel A),
ROWPVT (Panel
B) Stanford-Binet Knowledge
(Panel
C),
Stanford-Binet Fluid Reasoning (Panel D), and Vineland Social-
ization (Panel E) over the study for all 29 subjects under both
conditions. There were no statistically significant carryover
effects for these endpoints. This allowed participants to be
used as their own control and mean differences for all 29 sub-
jects compared after infusions of AUCB and placebo at 12 and
24 weeks versus baseline.
There were no statistically significant changes in the EOWPVT
(Fig. 3A), ROWPVT (Fig. 3B), or Stanford Binet subscales (Fig. 3C,
3D) when subjects received placebo versus AUCB at 12 and 24
weeks post infusion. The score on the Vineland Socialization sub-
scale was significant as scored per guidelines after 12 weeks for
the AUCB group, but after applying the false discovery method for
adjustment of multiple comparisons the scoring did not reach sig-
nificance (Fig. 3E).

 There were statistically significant (p < .05) group X treat-
ment interactions for the Vineland ABC, Communication,
Motor, and Daily subscales which indicated that changes over
time between these scores depended on the order that AUCB
was administered. For these endpoints, the means scores
between the 14 participants who received AUCB first and 15
participants who received placebo first were compared at 12
and 24 weeks and adjusted for differences in baseline scores.
The results of these ANCOVAs (Table 4) showed that all Vine-
land subscales had lower mean scores for the AUCB group
than the placebo group at both 12 and 24 weeks. None of
these differences were statistically significant after adjustment
for baseline scores and using the FDR adjustment for
multiplicity.
DISCUSSION
This pilot study is the first randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled trial performed in the U.S. to assess the feasibility of
treating children with ASD with AUCB. The results of this study
showed that AUCB infusions are safe for this population. There
were no reported serious adverse events, similar to other studies
of AUCB infusions [39–41, 47]. There were also no statistically
significant differences between scores on the two primary or sec-
ondary endpoints after infusion with AUCB versus infusion of
placebo.
The present study provides further evidence that treatment
with AUCB is safe but there was minimal evidence of clinical
effectiveness. Although the lack of significant results of this
study are in contrast to the findings of an open-label trial con-
ducted by Dawson et al. [47] who reported improvements in
behavior on parent reports of social communication skills, clini-
cian ratings of autism symptoms, and standardized measures of
expressive vocabulary in children with ASD after the infusion of
AUCB, parents and investigators observed similar subjective
improvements. While those findings show promise for AUCB as
a potential treatment for ASD, the lack of both blinding and a
control group do not allow for definitive conclusions. Both
studies assessed change from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks and
used some similar endpoints. However, the present study incor-
porated both blinding and a placebo treatment to minimize the
potential for a placebo effect that may occur in open label stud-
ies and used standard scores for both objective and subjective
endpoints. While raw scores may show more variation, stand-
ard scores reflect what is appropriate for children of a specific
age and allow conversion of raw scores into meaningful expres-
sion of performance relative to age expectations.

 Language testing in the ASD population is difficult due to
often atypical developmental course. Use of raw scores or use of
language tests other than the EOWPVT and ROWPVT could have
potentially resulted in more precise measurement of function in
these areas, specifying gain, stability, or loss. For example, with
the current measures, standard scores above the 95th percentile
limit the capture of gains in post-treatment scores (ceiling effect).
This, however, was not contributing factor in the current analysis.
Standard scores below the 2nd percentile occurred frequently in
this investigation and potentially limit capture of function (loss,
stability, minor improvements) as well. While there is little room
to measure loss, even opportunity for growth can be misleading.
For example, stability in raw scores in each scenario (no loss of
skill) could result in decreased standard score even with a 3-
month advance in age. In fact, minor improvements could trans-
late into stability or decrease in standard scores upon conversion
if the rate of growth is less than anticipated by the standardized
data for demographic age-expectations. This also pertains to a
lesser degree to the Vineland and the Stanford-Binet tests. The
subjective measurement of CGI is commonly used in studies of
ASD in part due to these challenges. Although not to be inter-
preted in isolation, the measurable change in CGI scores may be
more meaningful than standardized scores.
In addition to the difficulty in measuring language in this pop-
ulation, there are other aspects of the present investigation that
could have limited the ability to detect significant findings. These
include a crossover design and lack of standardization of AUCB
dose.
The study was designed as a crossover study. Repeated meas-
ures designs allow for greater power with fewer subjects than par-
allel groups trials. One reason for the choice of the crossover
design was that there are few treatments for ASD so parents
would be less likely to want to enroll children in a trial with a
chance of only receiving a placebo, or in a trial with a wait list
option where subjects randomized to placebo could potentially be
aged out of the trial while waiting to be given AUCB. The design
choice resulted in excellent compliance by parents so that com-
plete data were available for all visits, on all endpoints, for 29
subjects.The disadvantage of this design is the potential for carry-
over of a treatment which means that only the first sequence of
treatments can be used for analysis.The present study showed no
carryover effect for the two primary endpoints but there were car-
ryover effects for several secondary endpoints. There is the poten-
tial that 12 weeks was not a sufficient amount of time to detect
potential changes. However, Figure 2A and 2B, which show the
change over time for the 14 participants who received AUCB first
and were followed for the full 24 weeks, suggest that this is likely
not the reason for lack of effect.
The other reason for the choice of the crossover design is that
it allows for subjects to serve as their own control. The ASD popu-
lation has widely variable levels of functioning and this was seen
in the baseline differences in the endpoint scores between the
groups who received AUCB first versus those who received pla-
cebo first. This is a potential problem in all randomized studies of
autism and was one of the advantages of the crossover design
where subjects are used as their own control. Perhaps stricter
control on the level of initial baseline function required for study
inclusion would have led to less variability among subjects and
increased the ability for differences to be detected and is sug-
gested for a future investigation. The advantage of strict inclusion
criteria is better control and less variability but the disadvantage is
that the results become generalizable to a smaller subset of the
ASD population.
Dosage of AUCB may be a reason for lack of evidence of effi-
cacy. Although all samples met the minimum requirement of a
post thaw percent viable CD341 of 20%, participants varied
widely in percentage and number of CD341 cells in samples
infused. Furthermore, 27% of participants received 1/5th of their
available AUCB based on parental choice to only use the minor
compartment. Parents were reticent to use the entire banked
sample on an investigational treatment but an analysis of dose
response would be valuable in future studies.
Despite the limitations of the study, a core symptom of
autism, socialization, showed trends in improvement on the
Socialization Subscale of the Vineland. The strengths of this study
were successful maintenance of blinding and excellent compliance

We recognize that our results do not corroborate with the
results of Dawson et al. [47]. Such discrepant results between
investigations of comparable design warrant careful consideration
of the variables that potentially contributed to outcomes. Specific
attention should be given to blind versus open designs. Lack of sig-
nificant measurable benefit was observed only in the blinded sce-
nario while significant change of any kind was observed only in
the open scenario. There may be significant potential benefit,
even if it occurs within a sub-population of the larger ASD pheno-
type. As we begin to explore possible benefits from these new
technologies we would benefit from not taking a position of con-
troversy, but rather of collaboration and appreciation that these
two investigations were vastly different studies. Dawson et al. [47]
may well have discovered something that we missed, but any
future studies should consider implementing a blinded investiga-
tion with a control group. We might also lack, at this time, tools
that effectively capture real change in this population. Measure-
ment of behavior is inherently more subjective than biometrics.
The goal of this pilot study was to assess safety and design the
first U.S. based study of AUCB for treatment of ASD. This study dem-
onstrates that infusion of AUCB in individuals with ASD is safe and
feasible when studied in a rigorous trial design and revealed chal-
lenges that need to be addressed to advance the study of the AUCB.
CONCLUSION
Infusion of AUCB for children with ASD is safe but efficacy has yet
to be determined. Tightly controlled trials are necessary to further
progress the study of AUCB for autism.
