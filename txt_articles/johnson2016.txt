Background: Previous research has shown positive effects of Omega 3/6 fatty acids in children with inattention and
reading difficulties. We aimed to investigate if Omega 3/6 improved reading ability in mainstream schoolchildren.
Methods: We performed a 3-month parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial followed by 3-month
active treatment for all subjects. Mainstream schoolchildren aged 9–10 years were randomized 1:1 to receive three
Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily or identical placebo. Assessments were made at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.
The primary outcome measure was the Logos test battery for evaluating reading abilities. The trial is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02557477. Results: The study enrolled 154 children (active n = 78; placebo n = 76),
of whom 122 completed the first 3 months (active n = 64; placebo n = 58) and 105 completed the whole study (active/
active n = 55; placebo/active n = 50). Outcomes were assessed by per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT)
analyses. Active treatment was superior to placebo at 3 months for improvement in phonologic decoding time (PP
active/placebo difference �0.16; 95% CI �0.03, �0.29; effect size (ES) .44; p = .005; and ITT ES .37; p = .036), in
visual analysis time (PP active/placebo difference �0.19; 95% CI �0.05, �0.33; ES .49; p = .013; and ITT ES .40;
p = .01), and for boys in phonologic decoding time (PP �0.22; 95% CI �0.03, �0.41; ES .62; p = .004). Children with
ADHD-RS scores above the median showed treatment benefits in visual analysis time (PP ES .8, p = .009), reading
speed per word (PP ES .61, p = .008), and phonologic decoding time per word (PP ES .85, p = .006). Adverse events
were rare and mild, mainly stomach pain/diarrhea (active n = 9, placebo n = 2). Conclusions: Compared with
placebo, 3 months of Omega 3/6 treatment improved reading ability – specifically the clinically relevant ‘phonologic
decoding time’ and ‘visual analysis time’ – in mainstream schoolchildren. In particular, children with attention
problems showed treatment benefits. Keywords: Omega 3/6; Logos test; reading; mainstream schoolchildren;
attention problems.
Introduction
The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such
as Omega 3 for learning and behavior in children is a
growing area of research. Omega 3 fatty acids are
essential components in the brain and have to be
provided in the diet since they cannot be produced in
the body. Concerns have been raised that lack of
Omega 3 in the modern diet may negatively affect
children’s
learning,
reading,
and
attention. The
brain cell membranes are rich in phospholipids
composed of these fatty acids, and studies suggest
that they may facilitate transport across the mem-
branes and modulation of neurotransmitter systems
(Chalon, 2006; Innis, 2007; Raz & Gabis, 2009).
Through these systems, they might play a role in
attention processes and learning.
Trials in children with neurodevelopmental
difficulties
Several randomized placebo-controlled trials with
Omega 3 or Omega 3/6 supplements to children
with neurodevelopmental disorders [attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental coor-
dination disorder (DCD), dyslexia] have reported
positive
effects
on
ADHD
symptoms
(Johnson,
O
¨ stlund, Fransson, Kadesjo
¨, & Gillberg, 2009; John-
son et al., 2012; Milte et al., 2012, 2013; Richardson
& Montgomery, 2005; Richardson & Puri, 2002;
Sinn & Bryan, 2007). Recent reviews and meta-
analyses conclude that PUFA supplements appear to
have a small but significant effect on ADHD symp-
toms, but that interpretation of results is clearly
limited by the heterogeneity in study designs, par-
ticipant samples, and supplements used (Bloch &
Qawasmi, 2011; Gillies, Sinn, Lad, Leach, & Ross,
2012; Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013). The main Omega
3 fatty acids in fish oils are eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Many trials
have used mixtures with varying proportions of EPA
and DHA, and some have used pure EPA or DHA.
Some trials have focused on children with ADHD
symptoms and low reading performance. A small
placebo-controlled
3-month
trial
of
Omega
3/6
included 29 children with general ability in the
normal range, but low reading scores, and parent-
rated ADHD symptom scores above population aver-
age. Omega 3/6 was superior to placebo in reducing
ADHD-related symptoms, but reading/writing out-
comes were not reported (Richardson & Puri, 2002).

doi:10.1111/jcpp.12614
 Another Omega 3/6 trial with a placebo-controlled
3-month period followed by an open 3-month phase
(Richardson & Montgomery, 2005) included 117
children with DCD, ADHD symptom scores above
population
means,
and
reading/spelling
scores
1 year below chronologic age. Significantly greater
improvements
in
reading,
spelling,
and
ADHD-
related symptoms were found with Omega 3/6
compared with placebo.
Milte et al. (2012, 2013) compared treatment with
EPA, DHA, and Omega 6 supplements in a rando-
mized controlled trial (RCT) in 90 children with
ADHD diagnosis or high ratings of ADHD symptoms
and learning (reading) difficulties. Over 12 months,
the participants received 4-month periods of treat-
ment with an EPA-rich oil, a DHA-rich oil, and
Omega-6 (safflower oil) in random order. The trial
showed no treatment effects on reading/spelling,
attention, or behavior, but correlations were found
between increased erythrocyte PUFA (DHA and EPA)
and improved reading/spelling, oppositional, and
ADHD symptoms.
A recent 16-week placebo-controlled trial with a
DHA supplement focused on mainstream schoolchil-
dren with low reading performance (Richardson,
Burton, Sewell, Spreckelsen, & Montgomery, 2012).
At baseline, the children scored ≤33rd centile on the
Word Reading Achievement subtest of the British
Ability Scale (BAS II). A treatment effect of improved
reading was found in the subgroup with baseline
reading performance ≤20th centile, but not in the
whole sample.
Trials in unselected mainstream schoolchildren
A number of recent trials have investigated effects on
cognitive measures, learning, and reading in main-
stream schoolchildren who were not selected for
ADHD symptoms or reading difficulties.
A supplement dominated by DHA (400 mg daily)
showed no treatment effects on measures of reading,
spelling, or working memory in a 16-week placebo-
controlled trial with 348 mainstream schoolchildren
(Kirby, Woodward,Jackson,Wang, & Crawford,2010).
In a 20-week placebo-controlled RCT with Omega
3/6 (same supplement as used in our present study)
to 395 indigenous Australian children, no treatment
effects were seen on reading and spelling, but
significant improvement on a nonverbal cognitive
test was observed (Parletta, Cooper, Gent, Petkov, &
O’Dea, 2013).
A supplement with a low daily dose of DHA and
EPA (with or without micronutrients) or placebo was
tested double blind for 12 months in the NEMO
study (Osendarp et al., 2007) with 396 children in
Australia
and
384
children
in
Indonesia.
No
improvements on cognitive tests were found (reading
was not assessed).
Kennedy et al. (2009) reported no effects on cog-
nitive measures with 400 or 1,000 mg of DHA daily
over 8 weeks to 90 children compared with placebo
in a double-blind RCT.
In a single-blind trial by Dalton et al. (2009), using
a spread containing fish flour with low doses of DHA
and EPA or placebo for 104 days to 183 children in a
low
socioeconomic
community
in
South
Africa,
improvements in verbal learning ability, reading,
and spelling were found in the active group com-
pared with placebo.
A double-blind RCT with 55 malnourished chil-
dren (Portillo-Reyes, Perez-Garci, Loya-Mendez, &
Puente, 2014) tested low doses of DHA and EPA daily
versus placebo for 3 months. Treatment effects in
processing
speed,
visuomotor
coordination,
and
other cognitive measures were seen.
In summary, signals of treatment effects appear
repeatedly in studies with children selected for ADHD
symptoms and reading difficulties, and meta-ana-
lyses suggest that higher EPA-DHA ratios yield higher
effect sizes (ES) on ADHD symptoms (Bloch &
Qawasmi, 2011). Studies in malnourished children
or children from low socioeconomic areas have
reported positive effects on reading and other cogni-
tive measures (Dalton et al., 2009; Portillo-Reyes
et al., 2014). In contrast, most trials with unselected
mainstream schoolchildren have not shown treat-
ment benefits. However, the mixed study designs,
populations, supplement compositions, and doses in
these trials make interpretations inconclusive. Based
on the combined evidence, this study was, therefore,
designed to examine effects in mainstream schoolchil-
dren of a supplement with a relatively high EPA/DHA
ratio, in doses previously shown to be effective for
inattention and reading difficulties, and to analyze
subgroups stratified by the degree of reading difficul-
ties and ADHD symptoms. Findings may have impor-
tance for dietary guidance, given the often low content
of Omega-3 fatty acids in modern diet.
Primary objective
To assess whether Omega 3/6 improves reading
ability in mainstream schoolchildren.
Secondary objective
To assess whether Omega 3/6 improves attention,
memory, learning, language/communication, prob-
lem solving, and social ability.
Methods
Study design

Participants
The participants were mainstream schoolchildren in the third
school year (aged 9–10 years). Baseline characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The principals and teachers in 12 schools in
south-western Sweden were given study information, and the
teachers informed the families to contact the study team if
interested in participation. Exclusion criteria were supplemen-
tation of Omega-3 fatty acids for periods longer than 1 month
during the previous year, significant medical conditions (e.g.
diabetes, epilepsy), intellectual disability, ADHD diagnosis,
psychoactive medication, or substance use.
Randomization and blinding
Consecutively numbered identical bottles were provided by the
manufacturer. A computer-generated block randomization
without stratification was carried out by the study-indepen-
dent Apotek Produktion & Laboratorier AB (APL), including
labeling and packaging of the study supplement. A code list
identifying active and placebo bottles was kept at the Sahlgren-
ska pharmacy until the end of the study, inaccessible to the
study staff. The list was sent to the study investigators when all
children had completed the study and all data had been
collected. All participants and investigators were blinded.
Outcomes and procedures
The primary outcome measure in the trial was the Logos test
(Høien, 2007), a comprehensive test battery for evaluating
reading abilities (Table 2).
Secondary outcome measures were the following parent-
rated scales:
1. Assessment of ADHD symptoms [parent-rated ADHD-Rat-
ing Scale-IV (ADHD-RS); DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, &
Reid, 1998]
2. Parent-rated subscales of the Five To Fifteen (FTF) scale
(memory,
language/communication,
reading/learning,
problem solving; Kadesjo
¨ et al., 2004)
3. Social ability (parent-rated Social and Communication

Omega 3/6 fatty acids for reading in children
3
 At the screening/baseline visit, the investigator obtained
oral and written informed consent from the child and the
parents and reviewed inclusion and exclusion criteria, medical
and psychiatric history, medications and other prior treat-
ments, and adverse events. The intellectual level of each child
was tested by the psychologist using the WISC-IV (Wechsler,
2003).
Participants were equally (1:1) randomized to receive three
Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily (corresponding to a daily dose
of 558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA, and 60 mg gamma-linolenic
acid) or identical placebo capsules (palm oil) during the
double-blind Study Period 1 (0–3 months). In Study Period 2
(from 3 to 6 months), all subjects received open-label active
treatment. All doses were taken at home supervised by the
parents.
The children met the project psychologist, special education
teacher, and investigator/clinician three times during the
study: at screening/baseline, after Period 1 (3 months), and
after Period 2 (6 months). All visits took place in the children’s
schools.
At baseline and at the 3- and 6-month visits, all outcome
measures were assessed. The investigator interviewed the
parents and children about compliance, effects, and adverse
events. Parents rated ADHD symptom scores on the ADHD-RS;
memory,
language/communication,
reading/learning,
and
problem solving on the FTF scale; and social ability on the
SCDC. The children performed the
Logos test with the
psychologist or special education teacher. The test leader gave
the child instructions before each subtest and recorded in the
Logos program if the answers were correct or incorrect. All
results are automatically computed by the program. Compli-
ance was assessed by parent telephone report monthly and at
the study visits.
The Logos test
The Logos test is a computerized reading test based on the
theory that word decoding is a central function for reading
ability. It is assumed that word decoding is dependent on two
main functions: phonologic and orthographic (Høien-Tenges-
dal
&
Tønnessen,
2011).
These
functions
show
varying
degrees of impairment in dyslexia, and researchers have
proposed phonologic awareness, rapid naming, and verbal
short-term memory as central cognitive processes (Ramus,
2003; Wolf, Bowers, & Biddle, 2000). The Logos test includes
subtests of several of these functions, measuring the effi-
ciency (both accuracy and processing speed) for the functions
[see Table 2 for a description of the subtests (F5–F17) and the
four ratios (Q1, Q4, Q5, Q12) derived from these subtests].
Slow reading is a typical feature of dyslexia and is likely to
impair the general comprehension of texts and building of
contexts, as well as being stressful for the individual given
time constraints.
Statistical analysis
Sample size calculation showed that a sample of 120 partic-
ipants would be required to detect a medium ES compared
with placebo with power 0.90 and significance level of .05. With
an expected drop-out rate of 20% in Period 1, a minimum
sample size of 150 children was planned for the study
(eventually the actual sample size was 154).
All randomized participants who completed a study period
were included in the per protocol (PP) analyses. Primary
outcomes in the double-blind period were confirmed by inten-
tion-to-treat analysis (ITT) with the Last Observation Carried
Forward (LOCF), carrying forward the baseline test data to
endpoint. Reasons for discontinuations or missing data were
recorded in detail to avoid bias. To adjust for multiple testing,
statistical significance was assumed for p < .01 (rather than
p < .05), but since several measures can be considered as
independent of each other, a full Bonferroni correction was not
considered appropriate. ES for dependent measures were
computed as the difference between the means of the active
and placebo group, divided by the pooled standard deviations
(SD) of the groups.
All Logos subtests and rating scale data including the
first
principal
component
were
evaluated
in
the
active
and placebo groups at baseline and after 3 and 6 months
by
means
and
standard
deviations.
Baseline
differences
between treatment groups were analyzed using Wilcoxon
and T-test.
We focused on within-subject changes in raw scores to be
independent of norm data. Changes from baseline to 3 months
and from 3 to 6 months were compared using Wilcoxon two-
sample tests because the data consist of subjective scales,
which call for robust estimations. Subgroups stratified by
gender and by reading difficulties and ADHD symptoms above
or below the median (from FTF subscale and ADHD-RS scores)
were analyzed in the same way, to investigate if effects varied
with problem severity. Tests for gender, reading difficulties,
and ADHD symptoms were also made by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) including an interaction term used to detect effect
differences in the subgroups.

Results
Between December 2009 and July 2011, the study
screened 162 children (Figure 1). Eight of these were
excluded (seven declined participation and one child
had psychoactive medication), and 154 children
were enrolled in the trial (77 boys, 77 girls; active
treatment, n = 78; placebo, n = 76). Of these, 122
completed Period 1 (PP analyzed for the primary
endpoint was active, n = 64, placebo, n = 58) and
105 completed Period 2 (PP analyzed was active/
active, n = 55, placebo/active, n = 50). A total of 49
children
(32%)
discontinued
the
study.
During
Period 1, 32 children (21%) discontinued (active,
n = 14; placebo, n = 18). The most common reasons
for discontinuation were difficulty swallowing the
capsules (n = 12 in each treatment group) or poor
motivation to continue (active, n = 1; placebo, n = 6;
Figure 1). One child (active) discontinued due to an
adverse event possibly related to treatment (stomach
pain). During Period 2, a further 17 children (11%)
discontinued (active/active, n = 9; placebo/active,
n = 8). The most common reasons for discontinua-
tion in Period 2 were poor motivation (n = 5 in each
treatment arm) or difficulty swallowing capsules
(n = 3 in each treatment arm). One child (active)
discontinued due to an adverse event considered
unlikely to be related to study treatment (repeated
throat infections). Other adverse events were mild
and did not lead to discontinuation.
Overall,
adverse
events
were
rare
(5%
of
all
children). In Period 1, adverse events were diarrhea

 treatment group and diarrhea (n = 2) in the placebo
group. The events in Period 2 were stomach pain
(n = 5) and diarrhea (n = 1).
Compliance was high and similar in active and
placebo groups (Period 1, whole sample 93%; active
94%, placebo 92%; Period 2, 91%).
All participants had an intellectual level in the
normal range as measured with the WISC-IV at
baseline. Mean Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) was 99 (SD 10.4,
range 68–128), Verbal Comprehension Index 98 (SD
9.6, range 71–130), and Perceptual Reasoning Index
104 (SD 13.0, range 63–137). Eleven children (7%)
had FSIQ below average (borderline intellectual
functioning), but no child had intellectual disability.
Five (3%) had FSIQ above average.
Primary endpoint: Logos scores from baseline to
Month 3
At baseline, there were no significant differences in
any of the Logos subtest mean scores or ratios
between the active and placebo group (Table 3).
Baseline to 3-month changes in mean (SD) scores
for all Logos subtests and subtest ratios in the whole
sample are shown in Table 4 (PP population) and
Table 5 (ITT population with LOCF). Active treatment
was superior to placebo in phonologic decoding time
(PP active/placebo difference �0.16; 95% CI �0.03,
�0.29; ES .44; p = .005; and ITT active/placebo

ysis time (PP active/placebo difference �0.19; 95% CI
�0.05, �0.33; ES .49; p = .013; and ITT ES .40;
p = .01). Thus, ITT analysis generally confirms the PP
findings, showing similar ES values but with some-
what higher p-values for some measures. In boys
(Table 6), active treatment was superior to placebo for
phonologic decoding time (PP active/placebo differ-
ence �0.22; 95% CI �0.03, �0.41; ES .62; p = .004)
and phonologic decoding time per word (PP ES .39,
p = .007). In girls (Table 6), active treatment was not
superior to placebo on any subtest or ratio.
From baseline to Month 3, no changes in Logos
subtest or ratio scores were significantly different
between children with reading difficulties above or
below the median (data not shown).
In
children
with
ADHD-RS
scores
above
the
median (Table 7), active treatment was superior to
placebo after 3 months for improvement in visual
analysis time (PP ES .8, p = .009), reading speed per
word (PP ES .61, p = .008), and phonologic decoding
time per word (PP ES .85, p = .006).
Tests for gender, and for reading difficulties and
ADHD symptoms as continuous variables, with
ANOVA analysis including an interaction term in
the model, did not show significant differences in the
subgroups.
Secondary endpoints: parent-reported outcomes
At baseline, there were no significant differences in
any parent-rated scale scores (ADHD-RS, FTF scale,
SCDC) between active and placebo group (Table 3).
In the whole sample, baseline ADHD-RS scores were
low [active group mean 9.76 (SD 8.03), placebo group
mean 11.93 (SD 9.17)], and thus far from clinical
levels of ADHD symptoms. Mean baseline scores on
domains and subdomains of the FTF scale were at or
slightly (but no more than 0.7 SD) above population
means for the age group, thus indicating a fairly
average problem level. Between baseline and Month
3, and between Month 3 and Month 6 (Table 4), no
significant differences in mean score changes were
found on any of the scales.

 Secondary endpoints: Logos scores from Month 3 to
Month 6
At 3 months, the active group showed significantly
better mean scores than placebo (Table 3) in reading
comprehension (p = .01) and naming time (p = .01).
Between 3 and 6 months, placebo/active treatment
was superior to continuous active treatment in
reading comprehension improvement (p = .002) in
the whole sample (Table 4) and close to significance
in boys (p = .012; Table 6). No other significant
differences were observed stratified by gender.

 First principal component analysis
To consolidate the analysis results from the Logos
subtests and ratios, the first principal component
has been computed, that is, to find the linear
combination of test variables which contains the
maximum variance, adding up the contributions in a
direction that can be interpreted as a unanimous
effect of the treatment. Since measures with incom-
patible scales are present, the analysis was based on
the correlations between measures.
This combined study outcome was then submitted
to the comparison between the experiment groups
totally and divided into the subgroups described
above. The results showed that the treatment effects
were far more distinct than those of the original
subtests (Table 8).
The sample has also been tested for bias as a
consequence of the subjects who did not complete
the study. The results show that the dropout group
did not differ significantly from the study groups on
primary outcome measures at baseline (data not
shown).
Discussion
The most clear and consistent results in the study
were that children receiving active treatment showed
significantly greater improvement on the Logos sub-
tests ‘phonologic decoding time’ and ‘visual analysis
time’ than the placebo group. This was found in the
0–3 month (double-blind phase) PP analysis of the
whole sample and confirmed by similar ES values in
the ITT analysis. Active treatment was also superior
to placebo for improvement of phonologic decoding
time in boys, and close to significance in the
subgroup with ADHD-RS scores above the median
(p = .012). Treatment effects were of small to med-
ium size (ES .33–.6).
The subgroup with ADHD-RS scores above the
median (i.e. the children who had the most ADHD
symptoms, although no child had symptom levels

Mats Johnson et al.
 suggestive of an ADHD diagnosis) showed several
subtest results significantly favoring treatment ver-
sus placebo (visual analysis time, reading speed per
word, phonologic decoding time per word). By con-
trast, the subgroup with low ADHD-RS scores showed
no significant improvement. This subgroup difference
suggests that children with attention problems may
have a greater potential for improvement in their
reading abilities with Omega 3/6 fatty acids. ES for
this subgroup were medium to large (ES .6–.85).
Phonologic and visual decoding are considered to
be essential functions in reading ability, and dys-
function of these abilities key factors in dyslexia
(Høien-Tengesdal
&
Tønnessen,
2011;
Ramus,
2003). The results of this study may, therefore, be
of clinical importance.
The subtest results were consolidated by first
principal component analysis, thus estimating a
combined outcome of all subtests. This analysis
showed more distinct treatment effects than the
subtests alone, for the whole sample and for the
following
subgroups;
boys,
ADHD-RS
scores
above the median, reading difficulties above the
median.
The baseline scores of the parent-rated scales
confirmed that our sample had mainstream charac-
teristics, with fairly average scores on ADHD-RS and
on measures of memory, language/communication,
reading/learning, problem solving (FTF scale), and
social ability (SCDC). No significant active/placebo
differences in score changes could be found on any of
the scale domains during the study periods. The
general lack of significant rating scale results might
be influenced by the infrequent study visits. Vague
distant memories of long-term changes may be
confounded by short-term random symptom fluctu-
ations and seasonal variations, thus reducing the
reliability of these measures.

Omega 3/6 fatty acids for reading in children
9
 Adverse events were rare and mild. One child
discontinued because of stomach pain that may
have been related to study treatment. This supports
findings from previous trials that Omega 3/6 is safe
and well tolerated.
In previous research, positive Omega 3 or Omega
3/6 effects on reading have been observed in chil-
dren with attention difficulties and/or low reading
performance (Milte et al., 2012, 2013; Richardson &
Montgomery, 2005), and some results suggest that
children with the lowest reading abilities have the
greatest benefits (Richardson et al., 2012). Trials in
mainstream schoolchildren have more rarely been
positive, but treatment effects were seen in children
who were malnourished or came from low socioeco-
nomic communities (Dalton et al., 2009; Portillo-
Reyes et al., 2014). The results of our trial suggest
that treatment effects of Omega 3/6 on reading may
be found more generally in mainstream schoolchil-
dren, and they support previous studies in that
children with attention problems may have stronger
treatment benefits. These are promising findings,
and future research is recommended both in chil-
dren with neurodevelopmental difficulties (problems
with attention and/or reading) and in mainstream
schoolchildren. As noted above, interpretations of
current research results are limited by the hetero-
geneity of study designs, sample selections, sample
size, supplement compositions, and dosages, and
future research should be planned with careful
consideration of these variables, in large, long-term,
adequately powered placebo-controlled studies.
The study has some limitations. Infrequent assess-
ment visits make recollection of symptoms, func-
tions, and adverse events over long time periods
difficult. This increases the likelihood that recent
symptom fluctuations and temporary factors con-
found the estimates in parent-rated scales. Few
visits also give fewer opportunities for following the
development over shorter time periods. However, it
may also reduce the estimate of placebo response
that can result from short-term expectations. As
noted above, adjustment for multiple statistical
testing was carried out, to avoid the risk of inflating
results. Conversely, adjustment must be made with
caution so as not to obscure ‘true’ findings.
Conclusions
Compared with placebo, 3 months of treatment with
Omega 3/6 improved reading ability in mainstream
schoolchildren, as measured with the Logos test,
most consistently the subtests ‘phonologic decoding
time’ and ‘visual analysis time’. In children with
ADHD symptom scores above the median, significant
improvements with active treatment versus placebo
were seen on several cognitive parameters mea-
sured,
suggesting
that
especially
children
with
attention problems show scope for improvement
with Omega 3/6. No significant results were found
on parent-rated outcomes.

Key points
• Several trials have detected positive effects of Omega 3/6 on inattention and reading difficulties in children,
but most trials in mainstream schoolchildren have not shown reading benefits. Interpretation of results is
limited by heterogeneity in study designs and supplements.
• This is the first double-blind placebo-controlled trial showing that Omega 3/6 improves reading ability in
unselected mainstream schoolchildren, notably phonologic and visual decoding. Stronger treatment effects
were seen in a subgroup with attention problems.
• All evidence combined suggests that Omega 3/6 may facilitate reading for children.
• Future research is recommended both in children with neurodevelopmental difficulties (problems with
attention and/or reading) and in mainstream schoolchildren.
