United States

Objectives. To explore the effect of Medicaid expansion on US infant mortality rate.
Methods. We examined data from 2010 to 2016 and 2014 to 2016 to compare infant
mortality rates in states and Washington, DC, that accepted the Affordable Care Act
Medicaid expansion (Medicaid expansion states) and states that did not (non–Medicaid
expansion states), stratifying data by race/ethnicity.
Results. Mean infant mortality rate in non–Medicaid expansion states rose (6.4 to 6.5)
from 2014 to 2016 but declined in Medicaid expansion states (5.9 to 5.6). Mean dif-
ference in infant mortality rate in Medicaid expansion versus non–Medicaid expansion
states increased from 0.573 (P = .08) in 2014 to 0.838 in 2016 (P = .006) because of
smaller declines in non–Medicaid expansion (11.0%) than in Medicaid expansion (15.2%)
states. The 14.5% infant mortality rate decline from 11.7 to 10.0 in African American
infants in Medicaid expansion states was more than twice that in non–Medicaid ex-
pansion states (6.6%: 12.2 to 11.4; P = .012).
Conclusions.Infantmortality rate declinewas greater in Medicaid expansion states,with
greater declines among African American infants. Future research should explore what
aspects of Medicaid expansion may improve infant survival. (Am J Public Health. 2018;

he future of medical insurance coverage
remains uncertain in the United States.
As the most frequent users of needed medical
services, this uncertainty disproportionately
affects mothers and infants. The Medicaid
program has an excellent record of financing
coverage for pregnant women in low-income
populations; approximately 45% of US births
are covered by Medicaid.1 Millions of
Americans were affected by The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA;
Pub L No. 111-148, 124 Stat 855 [March
2010]), which made crucial changes in health
care benefits, coverage, and related regula-
tions.2 Since 2014, when ACA was imple-
mented, the uninsured rate decreased
considerably, especially in women aged 18
to 64 years (from 17% to 11%); Medicaid
expansion, adopted by 31 states and Wash-
ington, DC, was reportedly largely responsible
for this decline.2
The federal government requires that
several specific services be covered by Med-
icaid.1 Medicaid expansion states are man-
dated to cover 10 essential health benefits,
which include pregnancy, maternity, pedi-
atric care, chronic disease management,
breastfeeding support, contraception, mental
health and substance abuse screening and
treatment, and other behavioral health ser-
vices recommended by the US Preventive
Services Task Force.1,2
Because ofthe largeproportionofmaternal,
infant, and child health care and preventive
services funded by Medicaid,1,3 Medicaid
expansion may be among the most important
waysinwhichtheACAcouldimprovematernal
and child health indicators, such as the infant
mortality rate. In this study, we examined the
potential effect of Medicaid expansion on infant
mortality rate by comparing infant mortality
rate trends in states and Washington, DC, by
whether they accepted Medicaid expansion,
stratifying by race and Hispanic ethnicity.
METHODS
We created a data set of infant mortality
rates from publicly available data from the 50
states and Washington, DC, from 2010 to
2016.4–6 Infant mortality rates by state and
race/ethnicity were available for 2010 and
2015 but not 2016. We categorized the 50
states and Washington, DC, by whether they
accepted (Medicaid expansion states) or de-
clined (non–Medicaid expansion states)
Medicaid expansion. We used 2010 data for
baseline, because Medicaid expansion was not
implemented in any region before 2014. Data
were subjected to Bartlett’s test for homo-
geneity of variances to assess the appropri-
ateness of using the Student t test to compare
mean infant mortality rates of Medicaid ex-
pansion and non–Medicaid expansion states
and for other analyses.
Once we established its appropriateness,
we compared mean infant mortality rates in
Medicaid expansion with those in non–
Medicaid expansion states. To assess differences
ineffectofMedicaidexpansionbyrace/ethnicity,
we compared changes in infant mortality rate
by race/ethnicity from 2010 to 2015.
RESULTS
Only 19, including 10 southern, states
declined Medicaid expansion; 31 states
and Washington, DC, accepted it. Infant

 mortality rate declined nationally by 11.9%
from6.7(2010)to5.9(2016)deathsper1000live
births (Figure 1). Difference in mean infant
mortality rate in Medicaid expansion versus
non–Medicaid expansion states increased
from 0.573 (P = .08) in 2014 to 0.599
(P = .037) in 2015 and 0.838 (P = .006) in
2016 because of mean infant mortality rate
declines that were more modest in non–
Medicaid expansion (11.0%) than in Med-
icaid expansion (15.2%) states. Mean infant
mortality rate in non–Medicaid expansion
states rose slightly (6.4 to 6.5) from 2014
to 2016, whereas in Medicaid expansion
states, it declined from 5.9 to 5.6 per 1000
live births.
When stratified by race/ethnicity, infant
mortality rate declines were most striking in
African American infants—from 12.2 in 2010
to 10.7 in 2015—a 12.3% decline (Figure A,
available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org). The
14.5% infant mortality rate decline from 11.7
in 2010 to 10.0 in 2015 in African American
infants in Medicaid expansion states was more
than twice the decline in African American
infants in non–Medicaid expansion states
(6.6%—from 12.2 in 2010 to 11.4 in 2015;
P = .012). Declines in mean infant mortality
rate from 2010 to 2015 were much smaller in
White (5.3 to 5.1) and Hispanic (5.7 to 5.6)
infants, in whom mortality rates did not differ
significantly by Medicaid expansion in 2015
versus 2010 (Figures B and C, available as a
supplement to the online version of this article
at http://www.ajph.org).
DISCUSSION
Infant mortality rate declined in both
Medicaid expansion and non–Medicaid
expansion states between 2010 and 2016,
meeting the Healthy People 2020 10% infant
mortality rate decline objective nationally.7
However, the decline in Medicaid expansion
states was more than 50% greater than in non–
Medicaid expansion states. Declines and
difference in mean state infant mortality rates
by Medicaid expansion were greatest in
African American infants, driving the overall
infant mortality rate difference by Medicaid
expansion and substantially reducing the
infant mortality rate racial disparity.
Under pre–Medicaid expansion federal
law, all pregnant women with gross family
income up to 133% of federal poverty level
were eligible for Medicaid coverage nation-
wide.8 For more low-income pregnant
women to qualify for coverage, states could set
higher income limits (up to 300% of federal
poverty level).2,8 Nonpregnant women did
not automatically qualify because of income,
and eligibility criteria varied by state.8 All
hospital-related maternity services, including
vaginal and cesarean delivery, anesthesia, and
postpartum care up to 90 days, were covered
by Medicaid in most states, but Medicaid
coverage for many health care services varied
considerably by state.1,2,8 Medicaid expansion
increased dramatically the number of women
eligible for Medicaid coverage by extending
eligibility to nonpregnant women with
household income up to 138% of federal
poverty level. Presumptive eligibility, which
Medicaid expansion extends considerably, ex-
pedites access to multiple services. The ACA
benefited pregnant women with enhanced
maternity benefits. However, essential health
benefits for low-income women of childbearing
age included treatment of chronic diseases,
substance abuse screening, and, importantly,
increased access to prescribed contraceptives—
particularly, highly effective long-acting
reversible contraceptives; this increase coincided
with declines in out-of-pocket spending for
contraception and numbers of abortions and
births, suggesting a decline in unwanted
pregnancies, which are associated with
increased infant mortality rate risk.2,3,8,9
Our study could not identify which fea-
tures of Medicaid expansion could account
for infant mortality rate reductions, especially
in African American infants. However, re-
ductions in unintended pregnancies and
improved preconception, prenatal and ma-
ternal chronic disease, and mental health
management for mothers throughout their
child’s infancy could have contributed to this
reduction.
This study had several limitations. We
found marked regional differences in infant
mortality rates. Southern states, which are
overrepresented among non–Medicaid ex-
pansion states, have had higher infant mor-
tality rates and poverty levels compared with
Medicaid expansion states for decades.10
Conversely, states that adopted Medicaid
expansion had lower mean infant mortality
rates even before Medicaid expansion, sug-
gesting that factors linked to improved infant
survival were more common in Medicaid
expansion states and that important con-
founding factors were associated with both
higher baseline infant mortality rates and

 states’ decisions to decline Medicaid expan-
sion. Arguably, states that declined Medicaid
expansion were the ones that most needed it.
Because of the study’s observational nature and
inability to access 2015 to 2016 data in specific
Medicaid expansion–related variables (e.g.,
states’ prenatal care use and late entry, poverty
levels, and other and unknown factors), we are
unable to assert conclusively that Medicaid
expansion per se reduced infant mortality rate.
Despite these limitations, this analysis
suggests that Medicaid expansion possibly
contributed to infant mortality rate re-
ductions. Public health insurance has been
known to play an important role in improving
birth outcomes in low-income women.11
Medicaid expansion was linked to not only
reduced infant mortality but also infant
mortality rate racial disparity reductions that
have existed for more than a century.12 Future
directions in research should explore what
aspects of Medicaid expansion may have
improved infant survival, such as prenatal care
use, maternal mental health care, and the role
of home visiting, expanded contraception
use, and other services in infant mortality
rate reduction.
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
Our study findings suggest that Medicaid
expansion by 31 states and Washington, DC,
was associated with a greater decline in infant
mortality rate, particularly in African Amer-
ican infants, than was seen in non–Medicaid
expansion states. Medicaid has served millions
of US pregnant women living in poverty;
Medicaid expansion has increased access to
coverage and comprehensive services associ-
ated with improved maternal and infant
outcomes.3,8–11 Medicaid expansion may
have increased the effect of Medicaid for
more women in need.
