Study objective: We assess the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin compared with placebo as medical expulsive therapy
in patients with distal ureteric stones less than or equal to 10 mm in diameter.
Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of adult participants with calculus
on computed tomography (CT). Patients were allocated to 0.4 mg of tamsulosin or placebo daily for 28 days. The
primary outcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion.
Results: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age was 46 years. The median stone
size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 mm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days,
stone passage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 (81.9%) with placebo, a
difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval –3.0% to 13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of large stones (5 to
10 mm), 30 of 36 (83.3%) tamsulosin participants had stone passage compared with 25 of 41 (61.0%) with placebo, a
difference of 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to 41.6%) and number needed to treat of 4.5. There was no
difference in urologic interventions, time to self-reported stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. Adverse
events were generally mild and did not differ between groups.
Conclusion: We found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for patients with distal ureteric calculi less than or
equal to 10 mm in terms of spontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In the
subgroup with large stones (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and should be considered. [Ann Emerg Med.

INTRODUCTION
Background
Ureteric calculi are a common reason for presenting to
the emergency department (ED), with more than a million
ED visits per year in the United States.1 Ureteric calculi
are estimated to affect up to 12% of men and 6% of
women in their lifetime2 and typically affect young and
healthy adults. There are limited data on spontaneous
passage rates of ureteric calculi, but factors such as stone
size, location, smooth muscle spasm, edema, and anatomy
are known to affect passage.3,4 Calculi greater than 5 mm
in diameter frequently require intervention.5 A number of
pharmacologic agents have been used to facilitate stone
passage, so-called medical expulsive therapy. The most
frequently recommended agents are a-blockers, specifically
tamsulosin.Commonlyusedforbenignprostatichypertrophy,
tamsulosin acts at the a-1D adrenergic receptors present in
the distal ureter. Guidelines suggest it may be appropriate to
offer medical therapy as part of a strategy of observation and
periodic evaluation for newly diagnosed stones less than 10
mm in diameter; however, these recommendations are based
on limited and poor-quality data and come with the caveat
that they be administered “off label.”3
Importance
Numerous published clinical trials of tamsulosin have
been limited by small size and serious methodological issues
such as lack of blinding, no placebo, use of adjunctive
medications, and poorly defined primary outcomes of stone
passage, all of which call into question the validity of the
results.6-23 A recent systematic review of a-blockers24
demonstrated a high risk of bias overall in the studies

GENERAL MEDICINE/ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 Editor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
Tamsulosin has been suggested to enhance passage of
ureteral stones (“medical expulsive therapy”), but
most previous studies have been methodologically
flawed.
What question this study addressed
Does tamsulosin enhance overall passage of
symptomatic distal ureteral stones in emergency
department patients? Is stone size a factor?
What this study adds to our knowledge
In 316 patients with symptomatic stones and 28-day
computed tomography follow-up, the rate of stone
passage was similar between tamsulosin and placebo.
In the 103 patients with 5- to 10-mm stones,
however, the stone passed more frequently with
tamsulosin.
How this is relevant to clinical practice
In symptomatic patients with 5- to 10-mm stones
whose size and location are known, tamsulosin
increases the likelihood of stone passage and might
in some cases preclude the need for urologic
intervention.
conducted to date, with only 7 of 32 studies describing any
blinding of participants and investigators, and significant
clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Although the authors
concluded that there is sufficient evidence to recommend
a-blockers for medical expulsive therapy, they conceded
the methodological limitations of the studies and
recommended further placebo-controlled trials to draw
final conclusions. Furthermore, the external validity of
trials conducted with outpatients in a urology setting
compared with individuals managed in the ED could also
be questioned. The relative benefits and harms of medical
expulsive therapy in ED patients with ureteric colic
remain unknown, and consequently use of this therapy
has been sporadic.
Goal of This Investigation
The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy
of tamsulosin 0.4 mg orally daily for 28 days compared
with placebo in the management of patients with distal
ureteric stones less than or equal to 10 mm in diameter and
being discharged home from the ED with prespecified
subgroups of stones less than 5 mm and 5 to 10 mm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Setting
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial was conducted in 5 EDs (4 tertiary and
1 regional district) in Queensland, Australia, with a
combined annual census of more than 300,000. Three of
the departments, The Townsville Hospital, Gold Coast
University Hospital, and Robina Hospital, are mixed (adult
and pediatric) departments, whereas the Royal Brisbane
and Women’s Hospital and Princess Alexandra Hospital
are predominantly adult departments. Urologic services
were available on site at the 4 tertiary hospitals. The study
was approved by the human research and ethics committees
of participating hospitals and universities. The trial was
prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand
Clinical Trial Registry. Patient recruitment commenced in
October 2010 and finished in March 2014.
Selection of Participants
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were older than
18 years and with symptoms suggestive of ureteric colic and a
calculus demonstrated in the distal ureter on computed
tomography (CT) scan with a CT kidneys, ureter, and bladder
protocol.The distal ureter was defined asdistal to the sacroiliac
joint on CT, and size was defined as the largest diameter in 3
planes. Stone location and size were determined by the
reporting radiologist. Participants were excluded if they had a
temperature greater than 38�C (100.4� F), an estimated
glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/minute per 1.73m2,
a calculus greater than 10 mm, solitary kidney, transplanted
kidney, history of ureteral stricture, known allergic reaction to
the study medication, or current calcium channel blocker or
a-blocker use or hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100
mm Hg), or if they were pregnant or planning pregnancy.
Participants were identified in the ED by clinical medical staff
and written informed consent was obtained by a member of
the study team, a research assistant, or a member of the
medical staff not directly responsible for patient care. Baseline
information was collected and recorded on case report forms.
Screening logs of potentially eligible patients were augmented
with identification of potentially eligible patients on ED
databases.
Interventions
The tamsulosin and identical placebo were provided
by the manufacturer (CSL Biotherapies, Parkville, Victoria,
Australia). Sequentially numbered study packs were securely
stored at the study sites. The randomization sequence was
produced with a computer-generated program in permuted
blocks of random lengths stratified by hospital and stone

Furyk et al
Distal Ureteric Stones and Tamsulosin
 size (“small” and “large” stones being <5 mm and 5 to
10 mm, respectively). The sequence was generated by a
clinical trial pharmacist not otherwise involved in the study
and was securely stored and known only to the trial
pharmacist.
Each study medication pack contained either tamsulosin
0.4 mg or placebo. Once informed consent was obtained and
patients were deemed appropriate for discharge, they were
allocated to the next sequentially numbered study medication
pack. Patients were instructed to receive the study medication
daily for 28 days or until definite stone passage (ie, evidence of
stone on urine straining). Analgesia was at the discretion of the
treating physician; however, the recommended regimen was
indomethacin 25 to 50 mg 3 times daily orally (unless
contraindicated) and oxycodone 5 to 10 mg 3 times a day as
required for breakthrough. Investigators, the treating
physician, and patients were blinded to the allocation for the
duration of the study and data analysis.
Methods of Measurement
Participants were asked to record symptoms in a “patient
diary” provided on discharge to assist with recall of symptoms.
Participants were contacted by telephone for a structured
interview at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days by research staff. Pain was
recorded as the number of pain episodes, the worst pain score
during a 24-hour period with a verbal numeric pain scale, or
whether they were currently pain free. The verbal numeric
pain scale (0 to 10) has been validated for use in ED research
and found to correlate well with the more commonly used
visual analog scale.25 The minimum clinically significant
difference in pain is accepted to be 1.3 points.26 Participants
were asked whether they had experienced any adverse effects,
including prompts for commonly reported adverse effects
(dizziness, palpitations, collapse/blackouts, sexual
dysfunction, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
and constipation). At 28-day follow-up, limited pelvic
noncontrast CT was performed to determine stone passage.
All CTs were reported by consultant radiologists who were
blinded to group allocation. Compliance was based on self-
report by participants. Additionally, to assess the success of
blinding they were asked at the completion of the study
whether they thought that they had received the active or the
placebo medication. Research staff collated data from the
patients and from hospital databases. Data were entered into a
computer database designed for the trial with inbuilt logic and
range checks.
Outcome Measures
The coprimary outcomes were stone expulsion and time
to stone expulsion. Stone expulsion was defined as absence
of stone on repeated, noncontrast, limited pelvic CT at
28 days. Time to stone expulsion in days was defined as
self-reported definitive passage of the calculus or first day
of a pain-free 48-hour period, with calculus absent on
repeated CT. Secondary outcomes included unplanned
re-presentations to the ED or hospital admission, total
analgesia requirements, pain scores measured on the
verbal numeric pain scale, need for urologic intervention,
complications including infection (defined as positive
culture result for pathogenic bacteria in blood or urine),
renal impairment (defined as decrease in estimated
glomerular filtration rate of at least 20 mL/minute per
1.73 m2), days off work (as reported by patients), and
adverse effects from study drugs.
Primary Data Analysis
The sample size calculation was based on improving
passage for stones 5 to 10 mm in diameter. Limited data
were available for accurate estimates of stone passage in
this group, with some studies indicating spontaneous
passage of large stones to be unlikely5,27; however, we
determined that 49 patients per group would be required to
increase stone passage from 5% to 25%, according to an
a of .05 and a power of 0.8. We aimed to collect data in
both groups until a total of 100 stones greater than or
equal to 5 mm had been included. In accordance with
existing hospital data, we anticipated approximately 4 small
stones (<5 mm) for each large one (5 to 10 mm).
Data were analyzed with Stata (version 12; StataCorp,
College Station, TX). Primary analyses were performed
following the intention-to-treat principle. Statistical
significance was set at a<.05. An investigator blinded to
the study group assignments performed the analyses.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the baseline
characteristics of the study population. The proportion
of patients with stone passage at 28 days was calculated for each
treatment group, and the difference between the group
proportions and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference
was reported. A preplanned subgroup comparison of the
difference in stone passage for small and large stones also was
performed with the same approach. Kaplan-Meier analysis was
used to examine time to stone expulsion, and log-rank analyses
were used to compare treatment groups.
For secondary outcomes, categorical variables were
described with the number and percentage of individuals
within each group. The difference between percentages in
each treatment group and the 95% CI of the difference
were reported and P values were generated from the c2 test.
Continuous outcomes were described with the median
(interquartile range) because all were positively skewed.
The difference between medians and the Bonnett-Price
95% CI of the difference were calculated and P values were

 generated with a Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical
variables included unplanned re-presentation to the ED,
hospital admission, urologic intervention, positive urine
culture result, renal impairment, and adverse effects from
study drugs. Continuous outcomes included analgesia
requirements, days off work, total number of pain episodes
during 28 days, and worst pain scores during the 28 days.
The median number of days off work was 0 in each group.
As such, the mean was also reported and robust Poisson
standard errors were used to estimate the CI for the
difference between means. The majority of individuals
reported pain scores of 0 at 14-, 21-, and 28-day follow-up.
The proportion of patients in each treatment group with a
pain score greater than 0 was calculated at each of the times.
Because there were patients with missing data on the
outcome variable, sensitivity analyses were conducted. Such
analyses included missing data under the following
scenarios: best case, in which all patients with missing data
passed their stones; worst case, in which no patients with
missing data passed their stones; and control group, in
which stone passage rate for patients with missing data was
set to the stone passage rate in the control group.
Additional sensitivity analyses examined treatment failure
across treatment groups, with treatment failure defined as
stone presence on CT or urologic intervention, and the
effect of stone location on stone passage by reporting the
proportion of patients with stone passage by stone location
and treatment group.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Subjects
We enrolled 403 individuals in the trial; 202 were
allocated to tamsulosin and 201 to placebo. Three patients
were excluded from the analysis (1 in the tamsulosin group
and 2 in the placebo group) because they did not have a
stone reported on initial CT. An additional 7 participants
were removed from the analysis (3 in the tamsulosin and 4
in the placebo group) because they did not have a distal
stone. This left 393 patients in the analysis, 198 allocated
to tamsulosin and 195 allocated to placebo. Six patients
were enrolled in the trial and had an estimated glomerular
filtration rate less than 60 mL/minute per 1.73 m2, 5 in the
tamsulosin group and 1 in the placebo group. These
patients were retained in the analysis. Participant flow is
summarized in Figure 1. Demographic characteristics were
similar across treatment groups (Table 1).
Main Results
There were 161 patients (81.3%) in the tamsulosin
group and 155 (79.5%) in the placebo group who received
a follow-up CT. Stone passage occurred in 140 (87.0%) of
the tamsulosin patients and 127 (81.9%) of the placebo
patients. This was a nonsignificant difference of 5.0%
(95% CI –3.0% to 13.0%; P¼.22). Of the patients with
large stones, 77 had a follow-up CT, 36 in the tamsulosin
group and 41 in the placebo group. Spontaneous stone
passage occurred for 30 patients (83.3%) in the tamsulosin
group and 25 (61.0%) in placebo group. The difference
between groups was 22.4% (95% CI 3.1% to 41.6%;
P¼.03), with a number needed to treat of 4.5. Of the
patients with small stones, 239 had a follow-up CT, 125 in
the tamsulosin group and 114 in the placebo group.
Spontaneous stone passage occurred for 110 patients
(88.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 102 (89.5%) in the
placebo group, a difference of –1.5% (95% CI –9.5% to
6.5%; P¼.72). Table 2 summarizes the data for the
primary outcome. Combining urologic intervention and
stone remaining on CT as treatment failure demonstrated
similar results (Appendix E1, available online at http://
www.annemergmed.com).
There were 377 patients with evaluable data on time to
stone passage, 189 in the tamsulosin group, and 188 in
the placebo group. Within 28 days, 148 patients in the
tamsulosin group and 135 in the placebo group reported
spontaneous stone passage. An additional 10 patients in
the tamsulosin group and 15 in the placebo group were
censored before 28 days as a result of loss to follow-up. The
median time to stone passage was 7 days for tamsulosin
(95% CI 5 to 10 days) and 11 days for placebo (95% CI
6 to 14 days). The time to stone passage functions did not
differ across treatment groups (log-rank c2¼2.8; P¼.10)
(Figure 2).
The tamsulosin and placebo groups did not differ in
terms of the proportion of patients who had greater than
or equal to 1 ED re-presentation, greater than or equal
to 1 hospital admission, or a urologic intervention
(Table 3). With regard to analgesia use, total number of
5-mg oxycodone tablets and total number of 25-mg
indomethacin tablets was similar in each group (Table 3).
The majority of pain relief was received during the
first week (Figure E1, available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com).
The median number of pain episodes reported was 4
in both groups (Figure 3 and Table 3). Similarly, the
median worst pain score was 5 in both groups. The
proportion of patients with a worst pain score greater than
0 at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days did not differ across groups,
with the majority of patients being pain free by 14-day
follow-up (Table 3). There were no differences between
groups in incidence of positive urine culture result (1 in
each group) or renal impairment (6 in each group).

 Adverse events were frequently reported; however, there
was no significant difference between treatment groups.
These are summarized in Table 4. Self-reported compliance
was poor in both treatment groups. One hundred nine of
169 patients (64.5%) in the tamsulosin group and 112 of
174 (64.4%) in the placebo group reported receiving 1
tablet per day for 28 days, a difference of 0.1% (95% CI
–10.0% to 10.3%). Of patients with available follow-up
data, approximately one fifth reported being less than fully
compliant at day 7 (21.9% for tamsulosin versus 21.0%
for placebo). This increased to approximately one quarter at
14 days (26.4% for tamsulosin versus 26.4% for placebo),
21 days (26.9% for tamsulosin versus 27.6% for placebo),
and 28 days (28.6% for tamsulosin versus 30.2% for
placebo). Blinding of participants was assessed as being
successful, with participants unable to correctly identify
their allocation (Appendix E2, available online at http://
www.annemergmed.com).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analysis testing the effect of various
assumptions to account for missing data and stone location
on passage is reported in Appendix E3, available online

 outcome data were slightly younger (41.3 versus 46.2 years;
difference –4.8 years; 95% CI –8.2 to –1.5 years) but
otherwise similar to those with complete outcome data.
Scenarios for missing data did not change results
substantially.
LIMITATIONS
There are a number of important limitations. First, the
possibility of some selection bias cannot be excluded.
Recruitment into ED trials by busy staff with competing
priorities is challenging. Screening logs maintained at the
hospital sites were augmented by searching ED databases
for potentially eligible patients, so we believe we have
accurate estimates of their numbers. Although recruitment
was slower than anticipated, we do not believe that any
systematic bias was introduced.
We anticipated approximately 4 small stones for every
large stone, but the observed rate of small stones was
less. The trial, however, was primarily designed to have
adequate power to detect a difference in the large-stone
group.

 The primary outcome was stone passage on CT at 28
days. Although this overcame the limitation of previous
work with self-reported (or physician-assessed) stone
passage, we did not obtain a follow-up CT for approximately
17% of participants in both groups. The time frame of 28
days for follow-up CT was chosen to allow maximum time
for spontaneous passage to occur; however, the majority
of patients at this point did not have ongoing symptoms,
so perhaps the reluctance to attend this appointment is
understandable. Patients with missing outcome data were
slightly younger but otherwise similar to patients with
complete data. Sensitivity analysis of various scenarios about
missing data did not alter the results; however, we cannot
exclude the possibility of some bias caused by attrition.
Compliance was also problematic. Five patients in the
trial reported not receiving any trial medications, and

 compliance was generally poor in both groups. Our
definition of compliance was stringent, and compliance was
similar in both groups. The intention-to-treat analysis
would minimize bias associated with this aspect. Given the
poor compliance to the treatment regimen under trial
conditions, we believe that compliance is likely to be an issue
in actual practice too. In some respects, the trial results could
be considered pragmatic in assessing the effectiveness of the
intervention.
The trial, although multicenter, was conducted in a
single state in Australia. The results may not be applicable
to other populations. Measurement bias and recall bias may
have limited the utility of pain and analgesia requirement
data, but it is likely to have affected both groups equally.
Adverse events were frequently reported in both groups.
It is possible adverse events were attributable to the
underlying condition or coadministered drugs rather than
the intervention under investigation.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the largest clinical trial
evaluating tamsulosin versus placebo in distal ureteric
calculi. We found that treatment with tamsulosin did not
affect stone passage overall. There was an apparent trend to
benefit, which can be explained by a beneficial treatment
effect in patients with large stones (�5 mm), a prespecified
subgroup. Stone passage in patients with small stones
(<5 mm) was almost identical in both groups. There was
no difference between groups for the clinically important
outcome of need for urologic intervention, either overall or
in the large stone subgroup.
A 2014 Cochrane review on medical expulsive therapy
with a-blockers concluded that they resulted in higher
stone-free rates and a shorter time to stone expulsion.24
Tamsulosin was the most commonly evaluated agent and
was a major contributor to conclusions about the overall
treatment effect. However, the review included many
heterogeneous trials and cointerventions in comparator
groups such as aescin (an antiedema extract from the horse
chestnut tree) and steroids that are not considered routine
care in many settings. The authors conceded that the
majority of trials included only a small number of patients
and had variable methodological quality, which may call
into question the validity of the results.28 Of previous
trials evaluating tamsulosin, only 5 could be considered
at low risk of bias overall.29-33 The results of these all
demonstrated conflicting results, but closer examination
demonstrated concordance with results of our trial, with
benefit in larger stones and lack of benefit in smaller ones.
Stones in trials by Abdel-Meguid et al29 (n¼150) and Al
Ansari et al30 (n¼96) were an average of 5 to 6 mm in
diameter and demonstrated benefit with expulsion rates of
81% and 82%, respectively, with tamsulosin compared
with 56% and 61%, respectively, with placebo. These
differences were statistically significant. Trials by
Vincendeau et al33 (n¼129) and Hermanns et al32 (n¼100)
included average stone sizes of 3 to 4 mm and had stone
expulsion rates of 77% and 87%, respectively, with
tamsulosin compared with 71% and 89%, respectively,
with placebo, which were not significant. A study by Ferre
et al31 (n¼90) was one of the few studies conducted in the
ED setting. The mean stone size in this study was 3.6 mm,
and no demonstrated benefit was observed with stone
expulsion in 77% of the tamsulosin group compared with
65% in the standard care group (P¼.50).
We did not find a difference between groups in time to
stone passage with Kaplan-Meier analysis. When this
outcome has been previously reported, it has tended to
favor tamsulosin.24 We found self-reported stone passage to
be an unreliable method of determining definite stone
passage, with only approximately a third of patients

 reporting definite stone passage, with similar low rates
reported previously.34 Some of the inconsistency with
previous trials may be attributed to their methods, which
may have resulted in substantial bias. We did not find a
significant difference in pain or analgesia requirements.
We observed spontaneous passage rates of large stones in
our control group that were higher than anticipated and
higher than previously reported in observational data.3 This
is similar to more recent trial data.29,30
There was no difference in reported adverse effects.
There were no serious adverse effects in either group, and
reported effects were generally mild and self-limiting.
Previous reports have generally reported higher adverse
effects with tamsulosin. The high rate of reported effects in
the placebo group suggests that this may have been due to a
nocebo effect, the effect of the underlying condition, or
coadministered medications.
In summary, this study found no benefit overall of
0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily as medical expulsive therapy for
patients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10
mm in terms of spontaneous passage, time to stone passage,
pain, or analgesia requirements. The intervention was
generally well tolerated, and adverse effects were similar in
both groups, although compliance was generally poor. The
prespecified subgroup of patients with large stones of 5 to
10 mm did have increased rates of spontaneous passage
with the addition of tamsulosin, which should therefore
be recommended if no contraindications exist. Because
spontaneous passage is very likely with patients with stones
less than 5 mm and we found no benefit from the
intervention, a strategy of observation and periodic
reevaluation should be used for this group.

 APPENDIX E1.
Treatment failure
There were 329 patients (166 in the tamsulosin group
and 163 in the placebo group) who either had a 28-day CT
or a urologic intervention within 28 days. Treatment
failure, defined as stone remaining on CT or urologic
intervention, occurred in 26 patients (15.7%) in the
tamsulosin group and 36 (22.1%) in the placebo group.
This was a nonsignificant difference of –6.4% (95% CI
–14.9% to 2.0%; P¼.14).
For the small-stone group, there were 126 patients in the
tamsulosin group and 118 in the placebo group with a
stone remaining on CT or a urologic intervention.
Treatment failure occurred in 16 patients (12.7%) in the
tamsulosin group and 16 (13.6%) in the placebo group, a
difference of –0.9% (95% CI –9.3% to 7.6%; P¼.84). For
the large-stone group, there were 40 in the tamsulosin
group and 45 in the placebo group with a stone remaining
on CT or a urologic intervention. Treatment failure
occurred in 10 patients (25%) in the tamsulosin group and
20 (44.4%) in the placebo group. This was a difference of
–19.4% (95% CI –39.2% to 0.3%; P¼.06).
APPENDIX E2.
Blinding success
There were available data for 169 patients in the
tamsulosin group and 167 in the placebo group. There was
no significant difference in perceptions across the 2 group
(P¼.55). There were 34 (20.12%) and 29 (17.37%) patients
in the tamsulosin and placebo groups, respectively, who
thought they were receiving placebo. There were 52 (30.77)
and 46 (27.54%) patients in the tamsulosin and placebo
groups, respectively, who thought they were receiving active
medication, and 83 (49.11%) and 92 (55.09%) patients in
the tamsulosin and placebo groups, respectively, who said
they were not sure what group they were in.
APPENDIX E3.
Sensitivity analysis
There were 32 patients (16.2%) in the tamsulosin group
and 32 (16.4%) in the placebo group who did not receive a
28-day CT scan or have a urologic intervention. Patients
with missing outcome data were slightly lower median
age (37.5 versus 47.0 years; difference –9.5 years; 95% CI
of difference –13.67 to –5.33 years). Similar proportions
of patients with missing and nonmissing outcome data
were men (84.4% versus 80.9%; difference 3.5%; 95% CI
–6.3% to 13.4%), and had vesico-ureteric junction stones
(67.2% versus 63.5%; difference 3.7%; 95% CI –8.9%
to 16.3%). Median stone size was similar for patients
with and without missing data (3.5 versus 4 mm; difference
0.5 mm; 95% CI –1.02 to 0.02 mm). Patients with
missing data were less likely to be compliant. For example,
of those with 7-day follow-up data, 26 of 51 patients
(51.0%) with missing outcome data were not compliant,
whereas 54 of 322 patients (16.8%) with data were not
compliant (difference 34.2%; 95% CI 19.9% to 48.5%).
A best-case sensitivity analysis was conducted in which it
was assumed that all patients with missing data had passed
their stones. Patients with a urologic intervention were
not included in any of the sensitivity analyses. Under this
scenario, 172 of 193 patients (89.1%) in the tamsulosin
group and 159 of 187 (85.03%) in the placebo group
would have passed their stones, a difference between groups
of 4.1% (95% CI –2.6% to 10.8%). Assuming the worst-
case scenario in which it was assumed that none of the
patients had passed their stones, 140 of 193 tamsulosin
subjects (72.5%) and 127 of 187 placebo subjects (67.9%)
would have passed their stones, a difference of 4.6% (95%
CI –4.6% to 13.8%). Under a scenario in which patients
with missing data had an expulsion rate equivalent to
that of the placebo group (81.9%), 26 of the 32 patients
with missing data would be assumed to have passed their
stones. This is equivalent to 166 of 193 patients (86.0%) in
the tamsulosin group and 153 of 187 (81.8%) in the
placebo group, a difference between groups of 4.2% (95%
CI –3.2% to 11.6%). Sensitivity analysis for large stones,
under a best-case scenario, did not change results, with
passage rates of 40 of 46 (86.96%) in the tamsulosin group
and 33 of 49 (67.35%) in placebo group (difference 19.61;
95% CI 3.27 to 35.95; P¼.02).
An additional analysis was conducted to determine the
effect of stone location on passage. Stone passage was
more likely with vesicoureteric stones (182/203; 89.7%)
than for more proximal distal stones (85/113; 75.2%), a
difference of 14.4% (95% CI 5.4% to 23.4%). Stone
passage was higher in the tamsulosin group (93/97; 95.9%)
than the placebo group (89/106; 84.0%) for vesicoureteric
stones, a difference of 11.9% (95% CI 3.9% to 19.9%).
For more proximal stones, stone passage was similar in
the tamsulosin (47/64; 73.4%) and placebo (38/49;
77.6%) groups, with a difference of –4.1% (95% CI
–20.0% to 11.8%).
