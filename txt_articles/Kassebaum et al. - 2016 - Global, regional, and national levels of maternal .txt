Global, regional, and national levels of maternal mortality, 
1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Maternal Mortality Collaborators*
Summary
Background In transitioning from the Millennium Development Goal to the Sustainable Development Goal era, it is 
imperative to comprehensively assess progress toward reducing maternal mortality to identify areas of success, 
remaining challenges, and frame policy discussions. We aimed to quantify maternal mortality throughout the world 
by underlying cause and age from 1990 to 2015.
Methods We estimated maternal mortality at the global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2015 for ages 
10–54 years by systematically compiling and processing all available data sources from 186 of 195 countries and 
territories, 11 of which were analysed at the subnational level. We quantifi
 ed eight underlying causes of maternal 
death and four timing categories, improving estimation methods since GBD 2013 for adult all-cause mortality, HIV-
related maternal mortality, and late maternal death. Secondary analyses then allowed systematic examination of 
drivers of trends, including the relation between maternal mortality and coverage of specifi
 c reproductive health-care 
services as well as assessment of observed versus expected maternal mortality as a function of Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility.
Findings Only ten countries achieved MDG 5, but 122 of 195 countries have already met SDG 3.1. Geographical 
disparities widened between 1990 and 2015 and, in 2015, 24 countries still had a maternal mortality ratio greater than 
400. The proportion of all maternal deaths occurring in the bottom two SDI quintiles, where haemorrhage is the 
dominant cause of maternal death, increased from roughly 68% in 1990 to more than 80% in 2015. The middle SDI 
quintile improved the most from 1990 to 2015, but also has the most complicated causal profi
 le. Maternal mortality in 
the highest SDI quintile is mostly due to other direct maternal disorders, indirect maternal disorders, and abortion, 
ectopic pregnancy, and/or miscarriage. Historical patterns suggest achievement of SDG 3.1 will require 91% coverage 
of one antenatal care visit, 78% of four antenatal care visits, 81% of in-facility delivery, and 87% of skilled 
birth attendance.
Interpretation Several challenges to improving reproductive health lie ahead in the SDG era. Countries should 
establish or renew systems for collection and timely dissemination of health data; expand coverage and improve 
quality of family planning services, including access to contraception and safe abortion to address high adolescent 
fertility; invest in improving health system capacity, including coverage of routine reproductive health care and of 
more advanced obstetric care—including EmOC; adapt health systems and data collection systems to monitor and 
reverse the increase in indirect, other direct, and late maternal deaths, especially in high SDI locations; and examine 
their own performance with respect to their SDI level, using that information to formulate strategies to improve 
performance and ensure optimum reproductive health of their population.

Introduction
The global community adopted a set of 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) on Sept 25, 2015, to provide 
benchmark targets for global development between 2015 
and 2030.1 These goals are intended to build on 
the momentum and enthusiasm generated by the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),2 but also to 
reframe them within the context of a myriad of environ-
mental and societal challenges inherent in achieving 
sustainable global development,3,4 The Global Strategy 
for Women’s, Children’s, and Adolescents’ Health 
2016–2030 further aims to position the global discussion 
of maternal mortality within a continuum of programmes 
aimed at improving the health of women and children 
globally.5
As the MDG era has now come to a close and the SDG 
era is beginning, it is imperative to provide a 
comprehensive account of global, regional, and national 
progress toward MDG 5. Such information is of crucial 
importance to identify areas of success and remaining 
challenges, and to help to frame policy discussions as we 
continue to prioritise maternal and reproductive health

for women in the SDG era.6 Whereas MDG 5 set a target 
reduction of 75% in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR; 
number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) 
between 1990 and 2015, SDG 3.1 sets a specifi
 c target for 
all countries to lower MMR to less than 70 by 2030. 
A secondary target of MDG 5, adopted in 2005, called for 
universal access to reproductive health care with named 
subtargets for contraceptive prevalence, adolescent 
pregnancy, antenatal care coverage, and family planning 
services,7 but notably not for other reproductive health 
services such as skilled birth attendance, in-facility 
delivery, or EmOC services. Because of the late addition 
of reproductive health access to the MDG agenda, related 
data collection systems have taken time to mature and 
this issue has not been tracked as closely as maternal 
mortality. SDG 3.7 has continued the calls for universal 
access to sexual and reproductive health services by 2030.
We have completed this study as part of the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015, with the specifi
 c objective 
of ascertaining levels and trends in maternal mortality 
over the entire MDG period at the national, regional, and 
global levels. Relatedly, by also examining maternal 
mortality trends by age, cause, geography, and timing of 
death, we seek to better understand trends in maternal 
mortality epidemiology and thus generate insight 
into drivers of progress—or lack thereof—toward 
achievement of MDG 5 and help to frame discussions for 
monitoring of SDG 3.1 and 3.7
. Multiple previous 
analyses, including several completed as part of the GBD 
collaboration have sought to provide the best possible 
information about levels and trends in maternal 
mortality.8–14 In dual recognition of both the importance 
and diffi
  culty of accurately reporting on maternal 
mortality in many settings,15,16 each has incorporated 
increasingly large and geographically precise datasets 
and used more advanced statistical models. In their latest 
iteration,12 the WHO methods have also now adopted a 
single model for all countries and computed statistical 
uncertainty intervals. Important diff
 erences remain, 
however, between WHO and GBD maternal mortality 
estimates that at times paint divergent pictures of levels 
and trends in maternal mortality globally and in many 
countries. The main diff
 erences now stem from data 
selection, quality appraisal, data processing, and adult 
mortality estimation rather than the statistical maternal 
mortality models themselves.
In this GBD 2015 report, we present the underlying 
data for 519 distinct geographical units in 195 countries 
Research in context
Evidence before this study 
Published in 2012, GBD 2010 presented results for 187 countries 
with a population greater than 50 000 in the year 2000. 
Collaborative teams completed subnational assessments for the 
UK, Mexico, and China for GBD 2013, expanding the number of 
geographies in the GBD analysis to 296. The value of 
subnational assessments to local decision makers has led to 
expansion of subnational analyses in GBD 2015 to also include 
Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, 
and the USA. Several previous analyses, including several 
completed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors (GBD) Collaboration, have sought to provide the 
best possible information about levels and trends in maternal 
mortality. In dual recognition of both the importance and 
diffi
  culty of accurately reporting on maternal mortality in many 
settings, each has incorporated increasingly large and 
geographically precise datasets and used more advanced 
statistical models. In their latest iteration, the WHO methods 
have also now adopted a single model for all countries and 
computed statistical uncertainty intervals. Important diff
 erences 
remain, however, that at times paint divergent pictures of levels 
and trends in maternal mortality globally and in many countries.
Added value of this study 
The GBD 2015 assessment of maternal mortality provides new 
and more robust evidence on the levels and trends in maternal 
mortality in 195 countries and territories throughout the world 
as the MDG era has ended and the SDG era is beginning. 
It incorporates subnational data from an expanded group of 
countries that now includes Brazil, China, India, Japan, Kenya, 
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the 
USA. This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate 
and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
recommendations. Further, this analysis extends the concept 
of sociodemographic status by introducing a new 
sociodemographic index for a more robust positioning of 
countries and territories on the development continuum. 
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides the most comprehensive assessment to 
date of patterns and levels of maternal mortality worldwide, 
expanding on previous analyses by including the full 
reproductive age range of 10–54 years, more comprehensively 
evaluating the interplay between maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, 
and all-cause mortality, and reporting on how the coverage of 
reproductive health services relates to risk of maternal 
mortality. This study further investigates the main 
determinants of epidemiological patterns and trends across 
geographies and over time by comparing the observed 
maternal mortality, including eight underlying aetiologies of 
maternal mortality, with patterns expected on the basis of SDI. 
The GBD 2015 study entails a complete reanalysis of levels and 
trends from 1990 to 2015; the time series published here 
therefore supersedes the results of the GBD 2013 study. 
The expansion of geographic units, from 296 in GBD 2013 to 
519 for GBD 2015, is envisaged to continue so as to sustain 
comparability over time and across all geographies.

and territories, our methods for processing those data, 
the subsequent analytical approach, and fi
 ndings on 
maternal mortality from 1990 to 2015. GBD 2010, 
published in 2012, presented results for 187 countries 
with a population greater than 50 000 in the year 2000.17 
Collaborative teams completed subnational assessments 
for the UK, Mexico, and China for GBD 2013, expanding 
the number of geographies in the GBD analysis to 296.18–21 
The value of subnational assessments to local decision 
makers22 has led to expansion of subnational analyses in 
GBD 2015 to also include Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, 
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA. 
We expect subnational analyses for other countries will 
be added in future GBD iterations. The expansion of the 
geographical units in the GBD will continue in a way that 
will sustain comparability over time for the period 1990 to 
present and across all geographical entities. We have not 
included constant rate-of-change forecasts in this Article 
because, as part of the broader eff
 ort to quantify the 
population disease burden, we are developing a set of 
rigorous statistical models to forecast each component of 
the GBD—including maternal mortality—and we expect 
to be able to explore much more robust forecasts in the 
near future.
As with all GBD revisions, the GBD 2015 study describes 
updated maternal mortality estimates for the entire time 
series from 1990 to 2015 based on newly identifi
 ed data 
sources released or collected since GBD 2013. In response 
to published commentaries and un 
published seminars 
and communications on GBD methods, various meth-
odological refi
 nements have been implemented.23,24 In 
addition, a major eff
 ort toward data and code transparency 
has been part of the GBD 2015 cycle. And as with each 
GBD cycle, the full time series published here supersedes 
previous GBD studies. This analysis explores global, 
regional, national, and sub 
national progress and seeks to 
identify correlates that help to explain why some nations 
have seen great improve 
ments in maternal health, while 
others have stagnated and others still have worsened. 
These include examination of associations in national 
maternal mortality levels and trends with coverage of 
reproductive health interventions and Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI).
Methods
Overview
Maternal mortality is defi
 ned as a death that occurs to a 
woman as a direct result of obstetric complications or 
indirectly as a result of pregnancy-induced exacerbation 
of pre-existing medical conditions, but not as a result of 
incidental or accidental causes. To ensure internal 
consistency with all other causes of death, maternal 
mortality was also again analysed as a component of the 
overall GBD study. Many of the analytical components 
are therefore shared with other causes, including 
methods of data source identifi
 cation and cataloguing, 
data preparation, modelling platforms, and processing of 
results. Here, we will focus on parts of the process that 
are unique, have been updated since GBD 2013, or are 
especially relevant to our analysis of maternal mortality. 
Figure 1 illustrates details of the analysis. General 
components are described in the appendix (pp 2–54), in 
other GBD 2015 Articles in The Lancet, and have also 
been published previously.10,20,25 This report follows 
the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER) guidelines, which 
recom 
mends documen 
tation of data sources, methods, 
and analysis.26
Maternal mortality estimation
Geographical units of analysis
Our analysis was completed separately for 519 unique 
locations in 195 countries and territories, including all 
188 countries analysed in GBD 2013 as well as seven 
additional countries or territories—namely, American 
Samoa, Bermuda, Greenland, Guam, Northern Mariana 
Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, where high-
quality vital registration data were available. Of note, 
these territories were not included in the national totals 
for Denmark, the UK, or the USA, but were instead 
included in GBD 2013 regional totals. All 195 countries 
are hierarchically organised into 21 regions, each of 
which is nested in one of seven super regions. Based on 
a combination of data availability and collaborator 
interest, we disaggregated GBD 2015 analyses into sub-
national units for several countries, including 26 states 
and one district for Brazil, 34 provinces and municipalities 
for China, 31 states and union territory groupings for 
India that include 62 rural and urban units, 47 prefectures 
for Japan, 47 counties for Kenya, 32 states and districts for 
Mexico, 13 provinces for Saudi Arabia, nine provinces for 
South Africa, two regions for Sweden, 13 regions for the 
UK (Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, and 
nine subregions of England), and 51 states and districts 
for the USA. At the fi
 rst subnational unit level, we have a 
total of 256 geo 
graphical units. In this Article, we present 
results for countries and territories, regions, super 
regions, SDI quintiles, and at the global level.
Data input and processing
The contents of the dataset used in our fi
 nal model are 
shown in the appendix (p 667) and are compared with 
those used by the recent WHO analysis.12 A map showing 
the data coverage by location for all source types combined 
is shown in the appendix (p 57). We had 599 unique 
sources from data from 186 of 195 countries (95%), 
covering 12 052 site years, an increase of 71% from GBD 
2013 when we had 7056 total site years of maternal 
mortality data. This compares to only 203 sources 
covering 2636 total site years in the WHO analysis. The 
nine countries without maternal mortality data included 
Andorra, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, the Federated States 
of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon 
Islands, Somalia, and Vanuatu. Maternal mortality data

were also available for additional subnational locations in 
Mexico, China, the UK, Japan, the USA, Kenya, South 
Africa, India, Sweden, and Brazil. All data were stored in 
a centralised structured query language causes-of-death 
database in three formats: number of deaths, cause-
specifi
 c mortality rate per capita, and cause fraction 
(proportion of all deaths due to maternal causes).
Vital registration systems have been shown to 
underestimate maternal mortality, but the amount of 
underestimation varies by setting and can change over 
time.22–24 We therefore used a method that maximises 
the data-driven nature—and specifi
 city—of our adjust-
ments by systematically evaluating each underlying data 
source. We included all sources with population-level 
data for maternal mortality from each geography. 
We used a standardised process to identify, extract, and 
process all relevant data sources, including those from 
vital registration systems, verbal autopsy studies, 
maternal surveillance systems, national confi
 dential 
enquiry reports, and sibling survival histories from 
health surveys and censuses (fi
 gure 1, step 1).
Standardised algorithms were implemented to adjust 
for age-specifi
 c, year-specifi
 c, and geography-specifi
 c 
patterns of incompleteness and underreporting for vital 
registration, as well as patterns of misclassifi
 cation of 
deaths in vital registration and verbal autopsy sources 
(fi
 gure 1, step 2). These generalised algorithms were 
used across all GBD causes and thus were able to capture

trends in quality changes in vital registration with respect 
to maternal mortality, even in locations where 
surveillance studies have not been completed.20 Each code 
in International Classifi
 cation of Diseases (ICD)-coded 
vital registration datasets was uniquely assigned to a 
corresponding cause in the hierarchical GBD cause list. 
Codes used in tabular classifi
 cation systems (eg, ICD-9 
basic tabular list, verbal autopsy, maternal surveillance 
systems) were likewise uniquely matched with a GBD 
cause. A proportion of deaths assigned to causes that 
cannot be underlying causes of death (garbage coded) 
were reassigned to maternal causes based on statistical 
redistribution packages, as described in the appendix 
(pp 2–18). The net eff
 ect of data processing steps on vital 
registration across all locations and years combined was 
to increase maternal deaths by 168%. The net eff
 ect 
varied by geography and year even among those countries 
and territories with at least 10 years of data, ranging from 
less than 1% increase in Mongolia to a nine-fold increase 
in China. Final and raw vital registration data for each

country and year are shown in the appendix (pp 519–652), 
including proportion of all deaths assigned to garbage 
codes, and comparisons with WHO vital registration 
adjustments.12 Figure 2 shows the results of garbage code 
redistribution for maternal mortality at the global level. 
Distinct cause groupings, many of which are garbage 
codes, are shown on the left and the relative thickness of 
lines shows the proportion of all deaths from those codes 
that were subsequently mapped to corresponding 
maternal causes on the right. Note that by defi
 nition the 
so-called non-garbage codes on the left map directly to 
maternal causes.
In view of their inconsistent use by vital registration 
systems, codes pertaining to HIV-related indirect 
maternal deaths were excluded at this stage in favour of a 
more comprehensive approach to estimate the eff
 ect of 
HIV on maternal death (see below for more details of 
HIV-related maternal mortality analysis). In addition to 
vital registration, we identifi
 ed maternal mortality 
surveillance systems and published confi
 dential enquiry 
studies identifi
 ed via targeted web search and systematic 
review of national ministry of health websites. 
Confi
 dential enquiries are specialised studies designed 
to investigate the number and circumstances of maternal 
deaths. Inclusion required a clear distinction identifi
 ed 
between maternal and incidental deaths during 
pregnancy. As with vital registration systems, HIV-
related indirect maternal deaths were excluded from 
surveillance datasets at this stage (see below for more 
details) but otherwise were unadjusted. Single-year 
sibling history and survey data derived from health 
surveys and censuses was processed as in GBD 2013, 
using Gakidou-King weights to adjust for survivor bias 
and only retaining data from older surveys when years of 
death overlapped (fi
 gure 1, step 3).27
Our general approach to quantify the role of HIV in 
maternal mortality is unchanged from GBD 2013 and 
again 
involved 
comprehensive 
estimation 
of 
the 
population attributable fraction of maternal mortality to 
HIV10 (fi
 gure 1, step 4). In view of the increased baseline 
mortality of those with advanced HIV, this approach has 
helped to distinguish between deaths in HIV-positive 
women that were caused by pregnancy and those for 
which the pregnancy was incidental to their death. 
A detailed description of the GBD 2013 approach and 
updates is in the appendix (pp 21–24). An updated 
systematic literature search completed on July 20, 2015, 
did not identify any new sources to inform either our 
meta-analysis of relative risk of pregnancy-related death 
for HIV-positive versus HIV-negative women or our 
analysis on the proportion of pregnancy-related deaths in 
HIV-positive women that are maternal (versus incidental). 
HIV prevalence in pregnancy, approximated as the ratio of 
livebirths in HIV-positive to HIV-negative women, was 
updated using our modifi
 ed EPP-Spectrum model. We 
also made two important improvements to overall HIV 
mortality estimation, both of which aff
 ected our 
HIV-related maternal mortality estimates. First, to improve 
the internal consistency of estimates developed for 
countries with generalised HIV epidemics, we modifi
 ed 
EPP-Spectrum to improve how it integrates ART-
dependent HIV progression and mortality data from 
published cohort studies and combined these fi
 ndings 
with results derived from statistical examination of how 
all-cause mortality relates to crude HIV death rate. Second, 
in recognition of the fact that HIV mortality rivals or 
exceeds that of high mortality events (referred to as so-
called fatal discontinuities in GBD 2015) such as war and 
natural disaster in many locations—and that such 
discontinuities have major detrimental eff
 ects on statistical 
mortality models—all of our maternal mortality data were 
processed to ensure incidental HIV deaths were excluded 
before modelling. We processed sibling history and census 
data to exclude incidental HIV deaths using population 
attributable fractions calculated above for each geography, 
age group, and year. This method is analogous to the HIV-
correction process used in GBD 2013 except that the 
correction was done on the data itself rather than the 
preliminary model results. To ensure consistency between 
all data sources, we also applied population attributable 
fractions to all vital registration, verbal autopsy, and 
surveillance data to add back the corresponding number 
of HIV-related indirect maternal deaths in each of those 
sources. Finally, to reduce error introduced by large 
stochastic fl
 uctuations and upward bias introduced by data 
that have a value of zero, we processed all data of all 
specifi
 cations using Bayesian noise-reduction algorithms 
(see appendix [pp 2–18] for more details; fi
 gure 1, step 5). 
Zeros are problematic because the log of zero is undefi
 ned, 
so all zeroes would otherwise be ignored by log-based 
statistical mortality models.
Modelling overall maternal mortality
We again modelled overall maternal mortality using 
cause-of-death ensemble modelling (CODEm), which 
was developed for GBD 201028 and is described in detail 
in the appendix (fi
 gure 1, step 6). CODEm runs four 
separate models, including natural log of age-specifi
 c 
death rates and logit-transformed cause-fractions in 
each of linear and spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression formats. Using multiple holdout patterns 
and cross-validation testing, every combination of 
covariates was tested. Models where regression 
coeffi
  cients met requirements for direction and 
signifi
 cance were then ranked on the basis of out-of-
sample predictive validity performance through multiple 
iterations of cross-validation testing. We then generated 
a series of ensemble models with a range of weightings 
such that top-performing component models con-
tributed the most to the fi
 nal prediction. We ran two 
separate CODEm models, one for countries with 
extensive complete vital registration representation and 
another for all countries combined (see appendix 
pp 655–59 for a list of countries and territories with

extensive complete vital registration included in separate 
CODEm model). The purpose was so that heterogeneous 
data from countries without extensive complete vital 
registration representation would not infl
 ate the 
uncertainty interval (UI) for countries with extensive 
and complete cause-specifi
 c death data. Results from the 
former model were used for all geographies with 
extensive complete vital registration representation; 
results for all other geographies were from the latter 
model.
Predictive covariates were specifi
 ed with respect to 
required directionality and signifi
 cance level of 
regression coeffi
  cients (see appendix [p 661] for full 
details). Three hierarchical covariate levels reduce the 
combinatorial burden on CODEm. Covariates with 
strong or causal association were assigned to level 1; 
those that are ecologically related were assigned to 
level 2; and those where association is suspected but not 
proven at the population level were assigned to level 3. 
We largely used the same covariates as in GBD 2013, 
including age-standardised fertility rate, total fertility 
rate, years of education per capita, lag-distributed 
income (international $ per capita), neonatal mortality 
rate (per 1000 livebirths), HIV mortality in females of 
reproductive age, and the coverage proportion of one 
visit of antenatal care, four visits of antenatal care, 
skilled birth attendance, and in-facility delivery. Several 
new covariates were introduced in this analysis in 
recognition of their potential relation to maternal 
mortality, all of which were specifi
 ed as level 3. Obesity 
prevalence was added to help to refl
 ect the added 
complexity of care and heightened risk of maternal 
complications in those who are obese.29,30 Mortality 
death rate from fatal discontinuities, a covariate that 
aggregates the eff
 ects of war, famine, and natural 
disaster, was introduced to help to inform maternal 
mortality estimates in geographies where demographic 
shocks have led to interruption of vital statistics and 
where health systems are also hypothesised to have 
deteriorated.31,32 Hospital beds per 1000 population was 
added based on the hypothesis that it might be a proxy 
for the availability of basic EmOC.33 SDI, based on 
principal component analysis of fertility, maternal 
education (years per capita), and lag-distributed income 
(international $ per capita), was added as a covariate to 
all CODEm models in GBD 2015. The root-mean SE of 
the top-performing ensemble model was 0·318 for the 
CODEm model of countries with extensive complete 
vital registration model and 0·553 for the global model. 
In-sample and out-of-sample data coverage was 99·6% 
and 99·3%, respectively, for the CODEm model of 
countries with extensive complete vital registration, and 
98·3% and 97·7%, respectively, for the global model. 
The relative contributions of each of the covariates and 
submodel performance for all component models in the 
top-performing CODEm ensemble are shown in the 
appendix (pp 662–75).
Modelling underlying cause and timing of maternal 
mortality
Our approach to quantify underlying cause and timing of 
maternal deaths was largely unchanged from GBD 2013, 
although in some cases we changed cause names to better 
refl
 ect the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes contained therein. 
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes corresponding to each category 
are in the appendix (p 653). We examined six groups of 
direct obstetric causes, including maternal hypertensive 
disorders; maternal haemorrhage; maternal abortion, 
miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy; maternal obstructed 
labour and uterine rupture; maternal sepsis and other 
maternal infections; and other maternal disorders. Two 
categories of indirect obstetric causes included maternal 
deaths aggravated by HIV
/AIDS and indirect maternal 
disorders. Late maternal deaths occurring between 42 days 
and 1 year after the end of pregnancy were estimated as a 
separate cause (ICD-10 code, O96). Two diff
 erences can be 
noted between the GBD and ICD-maternal mortality 
modifi
 cation classifi
 cation systems, neither of which are 
new in this study, but nonetheless warrant mention in 
that they each refl
 ect important clinical aspects of 
pregnancy complications. First, the GBD has grouped 
uterine rupture with obstructed labour rather than 
maternal haemorrhage, in recognition that most uterine 
rupture cases are secondary to inadequately addressed or 
prolonged obstruction of labour. Second is the combining 
of abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and miscarriage into one 
cause. Although there are important diff
 erences between 
them, we treated them similarly with the rationale that 
safe interventions can be similar during early pregnancy 
(eg, medication, potentially dilation, and evacuation), as 
can management of life-threating complications such as 
infection and bleeding, which require prompt evaluation, 
diagnosis, and often emergency surgical intervention. We 
also examined four distinct time windows of maternal 
death. In addition to late maternal deaths, we estimated 
deaths occurring during the antepartum period (before 
onset of labour), intrapartum and immediate post partum 
(onset of labour up to <24 h after delivery), and early and 
delayed post partum (24 h to 42 days after delivery). We 
analysed late maternal death as both a timing category and 
as a distinct cause because the underlying causes of late 
maternal deaths are not specifi
 ed in most data sources.
Systematic literature reviews identifi
 ed studies that 
examined underlying causes and timing of maternal 
deaths (fi
 gure 1, step 7). We extracted additional infor-
mation 
from 
specialised 
studies 
such 
as 
con-
fi
 dential enquiries and maternal mortality review boards 
that were obtained from targeted web searches or from 
correspondence with GBD collaborators. We supplemented 
aetiology models with cause-specifi
 c data from the causes-
of-death database. Of note, our criteria for including data 
from the causes-of-death database was modifi
 ed from GBD 
2013 to include all data from any source where specifi
 c 
subcauses were coded rather than limiting to only those 
sources where the complete complement of subcauses 
 Articles

www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016
were included. This change had the eff
 ect of substantially 
increasing the size of our analytical dataset with respect to 
time and geography. Late maternal death data from the 
causes-of-death database were limited to those location 
years where at least 0·5% of all maternal deaths in raw vital 
registration data fi
 les were coded to late maternal deaths as 
this was the lowest proportion reported in any surveillance 
studies.34 Only 39 countries met these criteria with variable 
times in which they began coding late maternal deaths. 
Timing models were additionally supplemented with 
temporal information about pregnancy-related deaths 
from Demographic and Health Surveys maternal mortality 
modules. These data only reported on antepartum, 
intrapartum, and post-partum death. To maximise the 
volume and geographical distribution of data to inform 
causal attribution, we again modelled the proportion of 
deaths due to each cause and timing category using 
DisMod-MR 2.1.
The exception was HIV-related maternal mortality, for 
which the proportion was estimated using the 
population attributable fraction approach described 
above (fi
 gure 1, step 9). All data for cause and timing 
models for which late maternal death was excluded were 
statistically crosswalked within DisMod-MR 2.1 to the 
reference defi
 nition where late maternal death is 
included. Analytical details of DisMod-MR have been 
previously described.10 Further description, including 
details about updates contained in DisMod-MR 2.1 and 
statistical crosswalks, are also included in the appendix 
(pp 21–24). To correct for ascertainment bias inherent in 
the introduction of late maternal death partway through 
the MDG period, we corrected overall maternal mortality 
estimates for the systematic exclusion of late maternal 
death in those location years where it was not coded 
(fi
 gure 1, step 10). Selection criteria to identify those 
geographies and years to be corrected are described 
above. Geographies where coding of late maternal deaths 
was introduced partway through the time period were 
only corrected for the years before introduction. Age-
specifi
 c, year-specifi
 c, and geography-specifi
 c proportions 
predicted by DisMod-MR 2.1 for underlying causes and 
timing were then applied to the overall maternal 
mortality model developed in CODEm (fi
 gure 1, step 11).
Ensuring consistency with all other causes of death
Another crucial strength of the GBD approach to 
maternal mortality is that all results are internally 
consistent with all other specifi
 c causes of death (fi
 gure 1, 
step 12). CoDCorrect is a process that uses a simple 
algorithm to scale all cause-specifi
 c deaths from all 
causes for each age group, sex, year, and location, and 
thereby ensures that the sum equals total all-cause 
mortality. For maternal mortality, it further scaled the 
sum of all cause-specifi
 c and timing-specifi
 c estimates to 
equal the total for all maternal mortality. Further details 
on CoDCorrect and its implementation are described in 
the appendix (p 48).
Age groups and fertility
Previous analyses have truncated evaluation of maternal 
mortality at 15 years to 49 years. Doing so ignores the 
non-trivial number of pregnancies and deaths occurring 
in those younger than 15 years and older than 50 years.35 
Deaths in these age groups are routinely coded in our data 
sources, so for the fi
 rst time, we have expanded the age 
range of our maternal mortality analysis to include all 
5-year age groups from 10 years to 54 years in GBD 2015. 
To facilitate calculation of MMR in these age groups, our 
demographic analysis included expansion of UN 
Population Division estimates of age-specifi
 c livebirths to 
include 10–14 years and 50–54 years (fi
 gure 1, step 13). 
The appendix (pp 49–50, 684–701) provides more detail on 
fertility estimation in these age groups and a table of age-
specifi
 c livebirths for all locations.
Uncertainty analysis
We report 95% UIs for all estimates. UIs include 
uncertainty introduced by variable sample sizes, data 
adjustments for all-cause mortality sources, and 
cause-specifi
 c model specifi
 cations and estimation. In 
CODEm, after a model weighting scheme has been 
chosen, each model contributes a number of draws 
proportional to its weight such that 1000 draws are 
created. The mean of the draws is used as the fi
 nal 
estimate for the CODEm process and 95% UI are created 
from the 0·025 and 0·975 quantiles of the draws. In 
DisMod-MR 2.1, uncertainty is calculated by sampling 
1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each most-
detailed geography, age group, and year. UIs for 
underlying causes and timing are propagated from the 
combination of CODEm and DisMod-MR 2.1 draws. We 
propagated uncertainty into all the fi
 nal quantities of 
interest at all levels of geographic, temporal, and 
age-specifi
 c aggregations assuming no correlation 
between them.
Analysis of levels and trends
MMR, annualised rate of change, and reporting metrics
We report number of deaths and MMR; number of 
deaths per 100 000 livebirths) for ages 10–54 years 
inclusive. We calculated MMR for each 5-year age group 
separately using age-specifi
 c livebirths (fi
 gure 1, step 14). 
We calculated annualised rate of change (ARC) using the 
two-point continuously compounded rate-of-change 
formula36 in each geography separately for 1990–2000, 
2000–15, 1990–2015, and all single years throughout the 
time period. ARC examination shows overall trends, 
highlights periods of acceleration (or deceleration) in 
improvement, and allows identifi
 cation of those 
countries that probably achieved MDG 5.
Drivers of change in the MDG era, coverage target setting for SDGs
For GBD 2015, we completed two additional analyses to 
systematically describe drivers of levels and trends in 
maternal mortality. First, we examined the relation 
 Articles

1783
between MMR and SDI, a summary indicator derived 
from measures of income per capita, educational 
attainment, and fertility using the Human Development 
Index method.37 The SDI has an interpretable scale: zero 
represents the lowest income per capita, lowest 
educational attainment, and highest total fertility rate 
noted across all GBD geographies from 1980 to 2015 and 
one represents the highest income per capita, highest 
educational attainment, and lowest total fertility rate. We 
then used spline regression to calculate the average 
relation between MMR and SDI, thereby facilitating 
further evaluation of geographical and temporal MMR 
trends. Further details of SDI development and spline 
regressions are in the appendix (p 48). We then used the 
average relation between SDI and MMR to calculate 
observed minus expected (O–E) MMR ratio and O–E ARC 
(from 2000 to 2015), respectively, to show average patterns 
that can help to benchmark a country against other 
countries and provides insights into whether or not public 
action or other factors have been leading to narrowing—
or growing—inequalities since the MDG declaration. 
Second, to capture how improvements in women’s access 
to the specifi
 c modes of reproductive health care might 
change the average relation observed between SDI and 
MMR, we also examined the relation between MMR and 
coverage of one visit of antenatal care, four antenatal care 
visits (a proxy for more comprehensive care), in-facility 
delivery, and skilled birth attendance by calculating the 
average coverage of each over diff
 erent MMR ranges.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The authors had access to the data 
in the study and had fi
 nal responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
Global and country-specifi
 c maternal mortality
Global maternal deaths decreased slightly from 390 185 
(95% 
UI 
365 193–416 235) 
in 
1990 
to 
374 321 
(351 336–400 419) in 2000 before dropping to 275 288 
(243 757–315 490) in 2015 (fi
 gure 3). The overall decrease 
from 1990 to 2015 in global maternal deaths was roughly 
29% and the decrease in MMR was 30%. Table 1 shows 
results for all specifi
 c geographies in the GBD hierarchy. 
MMR followed a similar trend to overall maternal deaths; 
MMR was 282 (95% UI 264–300) in 1990, 288 (270–308) in 
2000, and decreased to 196 (173–224) in 2015. Global ARC 
was –1·5% (95% UI –2·0 to –0·9) across the entire MDG 
period from 1990 to 2015. Global ARC was initially 
relatively fl
 at at 0·2% (–0·5 to 0·9) from 1990 to 2000, but 
accelerated greatly after the Millennium Declaration to be 
–2·6% (–3·4 to –1·7) from 2000 to 2015. Looking at 
single-year ARC, we see the global acceleration began in 
the year 2001 and has continued accelerating until 
2007–08, after which the rate of improvement has slowed.

Geographical diff
 erences in maternal mortality are readily 
apparent. In 1990, 60 countries had an MMR greater than 
200, 40 countries had an MMR of greater than 400, and 
15 greater than 600 (appendix pp 58–62). Only one 
country—Burundi—had an MMR greater than 1000. MMR 
was less than 70 in 93 countries at that time. A subset of 
50 countries had an MMR of less than 30, and 28 countries 
were less than 15. By the year 2015, as shown in fi
 gure 4, 
122 countries had an MMR of less than 70, and 49 countries 
had an MMR of less than 15, including Saudi Arabia, all 
countries in central Europe, and all high-income locations 
with the exception of the USA, Argentina, Brunei, Chile, 
and Uruguay. Several other countries in North Africa and 
Middle East along with the USA, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Bulgaria, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Kazakhstan, Puerto 
Rico, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkmenistan, 
Ukraine, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam had an MMR 
between 15 and 30. Unfortunately, there were still 
24 countries with an MMR of greater than 400, eight 
countries with greater than 600, and still one—Central 
African Republic—greater than 1000. Of those greater than 
600, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Central African 
Republic actually worsened, with ARC from 1990 to 2015 of 
2·7% (–1·3 to 6·3), 0·34% (–2·1 to 2·7), and 
0·08% (–5·5 to 4·9), respectively. Of those countries with 
an MMR higher than 400 in 1990, Burundi and Equatorial 
Guinea improved substantially by 2015 with total improve-
ments of –4·3% (–8·7 to 0·3) and –4·2% (–9·6 to 3·9), 
respectively.
MDG 5 achievement
To achieve the primary objective of MDG 5, the ARC 
must have met or exceeded an average of –5·5% during 
the entire time period from 1990 to 2015. Based on this 
metric, a total of ten countries probably achieved MDG 5, 
including Iceland, Jordan, Maldives, Belarus, Morocco, 
Romania, China, Turkey, Poland, and Estonia. Several 
other countries achieved this rate of improvement at 
some point during the MDG period. From 2000 to 2015, 
24 countries exceed ARC of –5·5%. Many countries, 
despite not achieving the ambitious MDG 5 target of a 
75% reduction, actually have been experiencing steady 
declines in maternal mortality for quite some time. 148 of 
195 countries and territories saw their peak MMR occur 
before the year 2000, with an additional 21 occurring 
by the year 2005. Maternal mortality increased in 
26 countries between 1990 and 2015.
Relation between MMR, SDI, and reproductive health 
services
As shown in table 2, maternal mortality in the lowest SDI 
quintile improved the least, with ARC of only –0·97% 
(–1·8 to –0·001) from 1990 to 2015, and the low-middle 
SDI quintile was the next slowest with an ARC of –2·1% 
(–2·8 to –1·1). The proportion of all maternal deaths 
occurring in the bottom two SDI quintiles increased 
from roughly 68% in 1990 to more than 80% in 2015. The 
middle SDI quintile improved the fastest with ARC of 
–3·2% (–3·8 to –2·6) over the entire time period. Figure 5 
shows global and regional-level MMR and SDI from 1990 
to 2015. The black convex line represents the average 
relation between MMR and SDI over the time period and 
is the basis of expected MMR. Each coloured symbol 
represents a successive year from 1990 to 2015 for the 
global level and GBD regions. Globally, MMR in 2015 
was more than double what would have been predicted 
solely by average SDI. This was following a period from 
1990 to 2000 where global MMR improved more slowly 
than would have been expected based on SDI 
improvement and a period of faster-than-expected MMR 
improvement from 2000 to 2015. Based on the expected 
relation between MMR and SDI, reaching the SDG 3.1 
achievement threshold of MMR 70 would require an SDI 
of 0·65, corresponding to an average income of roughly

international $9442 per capita, 8·2 years of education, 
and total fertility rate of 2·5. Not all countries might be 
able to achieve that level of income, however, but 
education and fertility reduction eff
 orts could still be 
compatible with reaching this SDI level. If all women 
were to complete a full 12 years of education and total 
fertility rate of 2·7, an SDI of 0·65 would on average be 
associated with income of $3214 per capita. If total 
fertility rate were to decrease further to the population 
replacement rate of to 2·0 and education were 12 years, 
this SDI level would only require an annual income of 
$2648 per capita.
MMR and SDI both improved between 1990 and 2015 
in almost all regions, but MMR did not universally track 
with SDI over the entire time period in any single region. 
East Asia has had the lowest O–E MMR ratio since 2011, 
a period in which it has consistently been less than 0·4 of 
expected. Australasia has also had consistently lower 
MMR than would be predicted on the basis of SDI, with 
O–E MMR ratio ranging from 0·54 in 1990 to 0·71 in 
2015. In addition to east Asia and Australasia, several 
other regions have consistently had lower MMR than 
would have been expected by SDI, including central Asia, 
central Europe, eastern sub-Saharan Africa, Western 
Europe, and high-income Asia Pacifi
 c. Southern Latin 
America and north Africa and the Middle East both had 
lower than expected MMR in 1990 when both had 
O–E MMR ratios of less than 0·7, but improvement has 
not kept pace with SDI gains in either region: by 2015, 
O–E MMR ratios were 2·23 and 1·41, respectively. 
Central sub-Saharan Africa has been an exception in 
several ways. In addition to having the highest MMR of 
any region in 2015, MMR worsened from 1990 to 2015. 
Despite maternal mortality being high in central 
sub-Saharan Africa, it was still lower than would have 
been expected until 2014 because SDI is still so low in 
that region and has improved only slowly.
O–E MMR ratio has consistently been 1·25 or more in 
a larger number of regions, including the Caribbean, 
eastern Europe, high-income North America, Oceania, 
south Asia, southeast Asia, and southern sub-Saharan 
Africa. Andean Latin America had periods of rapid 
improvement in MMR during the early 2000s that 
exceeded that expected based on SDI. Unfortunately, 
MMR reductions there have slowed substantially since 
then, to the point where O–E MMR ratio was 1·41 in 
2015. Improvements in eastern Europe have been faster 
than SDI after the year 2000, but MMR improvement in 
the remaining regions has continued to be slower than 
expected on the basis of SDI. Southern sub-Saharan 
Africa and the Caribbean had the highest O–E MMR 
ratios of any regions at 3·57 and 3·71, respectively, in

2015, but both have had recent periods of MMR 
improvement that were much more rapid than expected 
on the basis of SDI. These trend reversals began in 2006 
and 2007, respectively. South Asia and southeast Asia are 
unique in that although both have made major gains in 
terms of SDI and MMR, the diff
 erence between observed 
and expected MMR based on SDI remained the same.
Even within regions, the degree to which MMR 
diverged on the basis of SDI varied. For each country, 
we calculated observed ARC minus expected ARC 
(O–E ARC) on the basis of SDI change from 2000 to 
2015 (fi
 gure 6). In 60 countries, the O–E ARC was faster 
than would have been expected based on SDI alone, 
and 25 of these had ARC at least 1·5% faster than 
expected. Within south Asia, Bangladesh has improved 
faster than expected, whereas Nepal, Bhutan, and India 
all had slower MMR reductions. Of the countries in 
southeast Asia, Cambodia and Laos have improved 
much 
faster 
than 
expected,

Thailand,

and

reduced MMR as rapidly as expected, with the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Equatorial 
Guinea both more than 3% slower. 93 countries had an 
O–E ARC of 1·5% or more, and there were 17 countries 
where O–E ARC was greater than 5%.
To begin exploring the hypothesis that MMR improve-
ments are related to coverage of specifi
 c modes of 
reproductive health care, we examined the relation 
between MMR and coverage of one visit of antenatal 
care, four antenatal care visits, in-facility delivery, and 
skilled birth attendance over the period from 1990 to 2015 
(table 2). We found that, on average, countries with an 
MMR of less than 15 had 98% coverage of one antenatal 
care visit, 95% of four antenatal care visits, 97% of 
in-facility delivery, and 99% of skilled birth attendance. 
Those with an MMR of 70—the SDG 3.1 target for all 
countries—have roughly 91% coverage of one antenatal 
care visit, 78% of four antenatal care visits, 81% of in-
facility delivery, and 87% of skilled birth attendance. This 
is by contrast with those countries with an MMR around 
200 where there is an average of 84% coverage of one 
antenatal care visit, 61% of four antenatal care visits, 63% 
of in-facility delivery, and 70% of skilled birth attendance, 
and those locations with an MMR higher than 500 where 
coverage of all services was low, including just 76% 
coverage of one antenatal care visit, 45% of four antenatal 
care visits, 41% of in-facility delivery, and 48% of skilled 
birth attendance. Comparable datasets were not available 
to examine the relation between MMR and coverage of 
either EmOC, distance to obstetric care, post natal care 
coverage, or family planning services such as modern 
contraception and access to safe abortion services.
Age pattern of maternal mortality and fertility
The risk of maternal mortality increases greatly with age 
but decreased greatly in almost all age groups from 1990 
to 2015 (appendix pp 63–295). Globally in 2015, MMR in 
10–14 year olds girls was 278 (95% UI 229–339). MMR 
then decreased and was lowest in women from 
15–29 years old before increasing substantially to 
1832 (95% UI 1284–2746) in 50–54 year olds (not shown 
on graph). Although the largest number of births still 
occur among women between the ages of 20 years and 
29 years (55% of total), adolescent fertility has decreased 
in and a net shift in births to older women has been 
noted (appendix pp 684–701). In 1990, 23·3 million (17% 
of total) livebirths occurred in those women aged 
younger than 20 years, and 0·58 million (0·42% of the 
total) were to girls aged 10–14 years. In 2015, 19·4 million 
(14% of total) births were in those aged 10–19 years, but

there were still 0·48 million (0·34% of total) to girls 
younger than 15 years. By contrast, the absolute number 
of annual births to women aged 35 years and older 
increased from 16·1 million (12% of total) in 1990 to 
18 million (13% of total) in 2015. ARC in MMR among 
10–19 year olds from 2000 to 2015 was –2·3 (95% UI 
–3·3 to –1·2), which was slower than the global ARC in 
MMR for all ages combined.
Cause pattern of maternal mortality
Although the risk of death from all causes increases with 
age, most deaths still occur in younger women and the 
absolute numbers of deaths from all causes except HIV 
are higher in younger age groups (see appendix 
pp 296–98 for number of deaths in 1990, 2000, and 2015). 
Direct obstetric causes accounted for about 86% of all 
maternal deaths globally in 2015, led by maternal 
haemorrhage, maternal hypertensive disorders, and 
other maternal disorders. This number is down only 
slightly from 1990 when direct complications accounted 
for 87% of all maternal deaths. Other maternal disorders 
decreased with the most of all causes between 1990 and 
2015, from 74 299 (95% UI 61 159–89 653) deaths in 1990, 
down to 32 734 (26 256–40 507) deaths in 2015. Maternal 
abortion, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy, and 
maternal sepsis and other maternal infections were the 
causes with the next largest declines between 1990 and 
2015. 
Indirect 
maternal 
disorders 
increased 
in 
importance from 1990 when they caused 42 246 (95% UI 
32 355–54 032) deaths (about 11% of total) to 2015 when 
they caused 33 108 (25 463–43 344) (about 12% of total). 
HIV-related maternal deaths were responsible for a 
portion of the increase in indirect maternal deaths, rising 
from 754 (95% UI 433–1095) globally in 1990, peaking in 
the year 2000, and coming down to 2322 (1394–3337) in 
2015; this was 0·84% of overall maternal mortality in 
2015. 2181 (95% UI 1306–3174) of HIV-related maternal 
deaths were in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015, roughly 1·6% 
of the total there. Overall, the contribution of HIV to 
overall maternal death was quite small, but a large 
number of women with HIV
/AIDS are dying incidentally 
while pregnant or after delivering. If we include 
incidental HIV deaths during pregnancy from our 
population attributable fraction analysis, 20 180 (95% UI 
12 120–29 005) HIV-positive women died while pregnant 
or post partum in 2015 (appendix pp 720–37 shows cause-
specifi
 c maternal deaths for all GBD locations).
Changing cause pattern by age
The age pattern for underlying maternal mortality causes 
in 2015 (fi
 gure 7) shows that in the youngest age groups, 
maternal haemorrhage and maternal hypertensive 
disorders are the dominant causes, together accounting 
for more than 50% of all maternal deaths. Although the 
comparative risk associated with maternal hypertensive 
disorders decreases with age, haemorrhage actually 
peaked in importance in the 35–39 year olds. The 
contribution of most other causes of maternal death also 
increased with age, especially other direct maternal 
disorders and the combined category of abortion, ectopic 
pregnancy, and miscarriage. Late maternal deaths 
decreased steadily in importance from 1990, when 
8460 (95% UI 5792–11 935) late maternal deaths occurred, 
to 2015, when 6711 (4335–9996) occurred, and still was 
the time period with the smallest absolute number of 
deaths (see appendix pp 738–69 for timing deaths).

The antepartum and post-partum periods were the 
periods with the largest numbers of deaths in 2015 at 
101 774 (95% UI 88 185–117 570) and 85 686 (72 956–101 862), 
respectively. The age pattern showed that the proportion 
of post-partum deaths peaked in the youngest age groups, 
whereas intrapartum and antepartum deaths were more 
important in those older than 35 years (appendix 
pp 299–302). If we look at the change in underlying causal 
patterns as predicted by SDI (fi
 gure 8), we see that in the 
lowest SDI geographies, maternal mortality is dominated 
by maternal haemorrhage. In high-SDI geographies, by 
contrast, the causal pattern changes substantially to one 
where other direct maternal disorders, indirect maternal 
disorders 
and 
abortion, 
ectopic 
pregnancy, 
and 
miscarriage are the most important causes of maternal 
death. In middle-SDI geographies, the epidemiological 
profi
 le is even more complicated, with a particularly high 
proportion of maternal deaths being due to maternal 
hypertensive disorders.
Discussion
In summary, the overall change from 1990 to 2015 in 
global maternal deaths was roughly –29% and in MMR 
was –30%, both of which were well short of the MDG 5 
goal of –75%. Global maternal deaths were largely 
unchanged from 1990 to 2000, decreasing only slightly 
from 390 185 (95% UI 365 193–416 235) in 1990 to 
374 321 (351 336–400 419) in 2000. Progress in MMR 
during the 1990s was also virtually undetectable when 
global ARC was only 0·21% (–0·46 to 0·87). This was 
4·1% slower than would have been expected on the basis 
of SDI alone. After the Millennium Declaration, maternal 
mortality improvements accelerated. In 2015, there were 
275 288 (95% UI 243 757–315 490) maternal deaths, and 
average global ARC in MMR from 2000 to 2015 was 
–2·6% (–3·4 to –1·7), although even with acceleration 
progress was 1·8% slower than would have been expected 
on the basis of SDI improvements alone.
Only ten countries achieved MDG 5 based on this 
analysis: Iceland, Jordan, Maldives, Belarus, Morocco, 
Romania, China, Turkey, Poland, and Estonia. Although 
overall progress has been slow during the MDG era, 
recent accelerations mean there are an additional 
24 countries where ARC has met or exceeded the MDG 5 
achievement rate between 2000 and 2015. There was 
signifi
 cant variability in MMR throughout the world in 
2015, ranging from a low of 0·8 (95% UI 0·6–0·9) 
in 
Iceland 
to 
a 
high 
of 
1074 
(215–2857) 
in 
Central African Republic. 122 of 195 countries had MMR 
in 2015 that is already less than the SDG 3·1 goal of 70.
Impediments to MMR reduction are multifaceted and 
variable; many are also well-conceptualised through the 
lens of our SDI analysis. First, slow improvement in the 
two lowest SDI quintiles is one of the primary reasons that 
maternal mortality reduction has been slower than 
expected at the global level. In 1990, these two quintiles 
collectively accounted for 68% of maternal mortality, but 
by 2015, increased to more than 80% of the global total.

 c maternal mortality ratio (MMR; number of livebirths per 100 000 livebirths) and SDI (left) and 
proportion of maternal deaths due to each underlying cause and SDI (right)
These stacked curves represent the average relation between SDI and each cause of maternal mortality observed across all geographies over the time period 
1990–2015. In each fi
 gure, the y axis goes from lowest SDI up to highest SDI. To the left of the midline are maternal mortality ratios (MMR; number of deaths per 
100 000 livebirths), and the right-hand side shows the proportion of the total in order to highlight the diff
 erent cause pattern in high SDI locations.

Part of the reason is that high adolescent fertility rates 
in these locations, coupled with comparatively slow 
improvement in adolescent MMR, led to concentration of 
maternal mortality burden in young women and girls and 
higher total fertility in these populations. Second, some 
middle SDI locations might be experiencing a period of 
inertia where progress is stalling because health systems 
have not evolved to meet the challenge of identifying 
and managing high-risk pregnancies and effi
  ciently 
responding to rapid clinical deterioration. Middle SDI 
geographies have historically had a higher proportion of 
cases due to conditions such as hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy and other direct maternal disorders 
(eg, cardiomyopathy and embolism). Maternal haemor-
rhage also evolves with increasing SDI because, as 
increased in-facility delivery and skilled birth attendance 
lead to near universal active management of the third stage 
of labour, an increasing proportion of remaining 
haemorrhage cases—especially those that result in 
death—will be due to intractable uterine atony or placental 
disorders, both of which require high levels of performance 
and responsiveness from horizontally integrated health 
systems.38 This treatise is supported by the observation that 
many of the countries or regions that improved more 
rapidly than would have been expected after 2000 were also 
the biggest recipients of Development Assistance for 
Health,39 funds that are often directed toward strengthening 
health systems, while many of those that have improved 
more slowly than expected have suff
 ered from epidemics, 
natural disasters, and armed confl
 icts that impair the 
function of health systems and the willingness or ability 
of women to seek care. Third, within any given 
region, heterogeneous or slower-than-expected MMR 
improve 
ments might be related to uneven ramp-up of 
coverage for specifi
 c method of reproductive health care—
antenatal care, in-facility delivery, skilled birth attendance, 
family planning services, EmOC, and post natal care—that 
are all known to decrease the risk of bad pregnancy 
outcomes.40,41 Indeed, increasing use of reproductive health 
services was one of the driving factors behind establishment 
of the Janani Suraksha Yojana conditional cash transfer 
programme in India. Janani Suraksha Yojana has been 
successful at increasing reproductive health-care services, 
but even despite its popularity this programme has not 
been as eff
 ective at reaching poor rural women, the 
sociodemographic group that is already at highest risk of 
adverse pregnancy outcomes.42 In addition to the Janani 
Suraksha Yojana programme in India, other countries 
such as Nepal, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, 
Uruguay, and Brazil have also had success in encouraging 
use of reproductive care services,43,44 so this might be a 
viable option for countries seeking to increase women’s 
use of reproductive health-care services. Fourth, the 
highest SDI geographies are likely also experiencing a 
confl
 uence of factors leading to higher-risk pregnancies 
and subsequently higher than expected MMR—namely, 
delay of fertility to older ages and a corresponding increase 
in the proportion of pregnant women with non-
communicable diseases (NCDs). Other direct maternal 
disorders are the dominant cause of maternal death in 
high SDI locations, driven by cardiomyopathy and obstetric 
embolism, both of which are of higher risk in older women 
and those with preexisting conditions such as hypertension, 
obesity, and diabetes.45,46 If the trend of increasing NCDs 
continues and, barring any breakthrough in preventing 
such complications, we could reasonably expect to see 
MMR increases begin to emerge in other regions besides 
those in the highest SDI.
Because of the importance of reproductive care 
coverage in overall reproductive health, and to help to 
guide specifi
 c coverage targets for achieving SDG 3.1 
and 3.7, comparable metrics and monitoring on 
coverage of all of these reproductive health services 
should be integrated into regular progress reports at 
the global, regional, national, and subnational levels, 
including the development of comprehensive strategies 
to reach those targets. Our analysis found that an MMR 
of 70 is expected with an SDI level of 0·65, which 
corresponds to an average income of international 
$2648 per capita, a total fertility rate of 2·0, and 
completing 12 years of education, so even lower income 
countries might have a path to SDG 3.1 attainment. An 
MMR of 70 is also associated with about 91% coverage 
of one antenatal care visit, 78% of four antenatal care 
visits, 81% of in-facility delivery, and 87% of skilled 
birth attendance. Higher MMR locations have histor-
ically had much lower coverage of these services, 
particularly in-facility delivery and skilled birth 
attendance, and increasing access to them will require 
sustained focus.
Quality of care must also be a focus as coverage of 
family planning services, antenatal care, in-facility 
delivery, skilled birth attendance, EmOC, and postnatal 
care increase, because the existence of these programmes 
by themselves is not suffi
  cient to ensure that women are 
receiving the care they need during pregnancy and the 
post-partum period.47 Care should be integrated and not 
be focused on single vertical interventions.48 Family 
planning services should be longitudinal and include 
provision of comprehensive sex education, multiple 
methods of modern contraception, and access to safe 
abortion.49 High-quality antenatal care should refl
 ect 
appropriate use of services, good communication 
between patient and provider, and reliable screening and 
treatment for infectious diseases (eg, sexually transmitted 
infections), chronic conditions (eg, blood disorders, 
obesity, substance abuse, renal dysfunction, rheumatic, 
or other heart disease) and pregnancy abnormalities (eg, 
anaemia, 
nutritional 
defi
 ciencies, 
blood 
pressure, 
glucose, urine protein, fetal growth anomalies).50,51 In-
facility delivery and skilled birth attendance services must 
be adequately staff
 ed to meet demand and, because not 
all major complications of pregnancy are avoidable or 
easily predictable, women need to have ready access to

well-functioning basic and comprehensive EmOC 
services. These services must be appropriately distributed 
to meet demand52 and be staff
 ed by suffi
  cient numbers of 
trained midwives, nurses, and anaesthesia and obstetrical 
providers to meet demand, including on nights and 
weekends. Health professionals in EmOC facilities 
also need to have appropriate equipment including 
medications, access to blood transfusion materials, and 
intensive care services to help to prevent complications 
from leading to death.53,54 Post natal care should focus on 
detection and treatment of those conditions known to be 
more common in the post-partum and late maternal 
period, including cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, 
and renal complications.55,56 In countries with generalised 
HIV epidemics, AIDS-related deaths have also been 
observed to commonly occur 42 days or more after 
pregnancy ends, and care eff
 orts for HIV-positive mothers 
should focus on ensuring uninterrupted antiretroviral 
treatment.57,58
Late maternal death statistics need to be improved. 
Maternal 
mortality 
surveillance 
studies 
such 
as 
confi
 dential enquiry have showed that late maternal 
death is non-trivial in even low-resource settings34,59 and 
can account for up to 40% of maternal deaths in high-
income settings.60 A contemporary linkage study in 
Mexico found that 18% of maternal deaths are missed 
when the defi
 nition is truncated at 42 days’ post partum.61 
As immediate mortality continues to decrease as a result 
of improved antenatal, obstetric, and post-partum care, it 
is therefore increasingly likely that the proportion of late 
maternal deaths will continue to increase. Despite 
knowledge of its importance, only a few countries using 
ICD-10 reliably code late maternal deaths. This is 
especially egregious because many of the same countries 
who have completed multiple confi
 dential enquiries also 
have not recorded a single late maternal death in their 
offi
  cial statistics. Denmark, Ireland, Finland, and the UK 
all fall into this category. Australia, France, and South 
Africa likewise completed multiple confi
 dential enquiries 
and have recorded a total of eight maternal deaths 
combined in the entirety of their offi
  cial statistics. This is 
the exact inverse of the USA where no nationally 
comprehensive 
confi
 dential 
enquiries 
have 
been 
completed (although some states have established 
maternal mortality review boards). The USA has high 
MMR for a high-SDI country—and is one of the few 
where it is increasing—but following the lead of Mexico 
and much of Latin America, it is also one of the only 
countries that has proactively improved its civil 
registration system with addition of a pregnancy 
checkbox on the standard death certifi
 cate,62 so it is 
possible that at least a portion of the increase is related to 
enhanced case ascertainment.62 The USA should learn 
from the experiences of other countries and consider 
implementing 
regular, 
comprehensive 
confi
 dential 
enquiries into drivers of maternal mortality. Other 
countries and subnational locations should follow the 
lead of the countries of the Americas by adding pregnancy 
checkboxes to their offi
  cial death certifi
 cates and also 
ensuring that cooperation between their national 
statistics offi
  ce and confi
 dential enquiries committees 
maximises data quality.
WHO also recently published a set of maternal 
mortality estimates for 1990 to 201563,64 as part of 
its collaboration with the UN Maternal Mortality 
Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG). MMEIG 
2015 global results again show a steep decline in 
maternal mortality from 1995 to 2005, and some 
deceleration in the period 2005–15 when maternal and 
newborn health Development Assistance for Health 
increased rapidly. GBD 2015 shows relatively little 
progress in the 1990s, but acceleration in MMR declines 
particularly after 2005. We have previously discussed 
some of the important diff
 erences between the 
analytical approaches used by GBD and MMEIG.65 
These included diff
 erences in dataset content, data 
processing 
methods, 
all-cause 
mortality, 
model 
specifi
 cation, quantifi
 cation of uncertainty, the use of 
CoDCorrect to ensure consistency between all specifi
 c 
causes of death, and the fact that MMEIG 2013 
combined three separate estimation methods for 
diff
 erent categories of countries, whereas GBD uses 
one approach for all countries.
MMEIG has made some important modifi
 cations to 
their analysis since 2013—most notably implementation 
of a Bayesian approach that combines all countries into a 
single model to estimate maternal mortality cause 
fractions (the proportion of all deaths in the population 
that are due to maternal causes). These changes are 
especially apparent in estimates for a number of 
countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, 
Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Kiribati, Latvia, Malaysia, 
Mongolia, Romania, Russia, South Korea, and Sri Lanka. 
Figures comparing MMEIG 2015 and GBD 2015 data 
inputs and results for each country are contained in the 
appendix. The correlation in MMR between MMEIG 
2015 and GBD 2015 estimates is now 0·85 over the entire 
time period from 1990 to 2015; this compares to a 
correlation in MMR between GBD 2013 and MMEIG 
2013 of 0·77
. If we limit the comparison to 2005 to 2015, 
correlation in MMR increases to 0·89.
Figure 9 compares the country-specifi
 c trends from 
1990 to 2015 between the two analyses. Whereas GBD 
2015 identifi
 ed only ten countries as likely having 
achieved MDG 5, MMEIG 2015 found a total of 
18 achieved the MDG 5 target. Because both groups use 
the same set of livebirths estimates from the UN 
Population Division, with the exception that GBD 2015 
estimated maternal mortality for the entire age range 
from 10–54 years, diff
 erences in fertility are unlikely to be 
a major driver of diff
 erences between the two results. 
Drivers of diff
 erences can thus be best summarised as 
being due to diff
 erences in maternal cause fraction 
estimates or diff
 erences in all-cause mortality numbers

as shown in the appendix (pp 499–518).
Global MMR estimates in 1990 were much higher in 
the MMEIG 2015 analysis, driven largely by higher 
estimates 
of 
maternal 
cause 
fraction 
in 
sub-
Saharan Africa, south Asia, central Asia, central 
Latin America, and north Africa and the Middle East. 
2015 MMEIG all-cause mortality estimates for 1990 were 
also higher in many of these same regions as well as in 
tropical and Andean Latin America, all of which led to 
higher MMR estimates than those produced by GBD 
2015. Of note, GBD 2015 maternal cause fraction 
estimates were higher in most high-income regions, 
central Europe, and Oceania. By contrast, our 
decomposition of the drivers of diff
 erences in 2015 
estimates show that diff
 erences in maternal cause 
fraction and all-cause mortality estimates narrowed in 
south Asia, central Asia, and much of sub-Saharan 
Africa, which has on aggregate led to broad agreement in 
global MMR fi
 gures for 2015. GBD 2015 estimates of 
maternal cause fraction estimates remain notably higher 
in high-income North America, western Europe, and 
Oceania, although it is likely that much of this is driven 
by MMEIG 2015 exclusion of late maternal mortality.
The total number of sources used by MMEIG 2015 was 
203 and by GBD 2015 was 599 (appendix pp 677–83 shows 
all country-specifi
 c sources by type used in each analysis). 
For a number of populous countries—including China, 
Ethiopia, Indonesia, and India—diff
 erences in maternal 
cause fraction estimates are largely driven by dataset 
content. MMEIG 2015 did not include data from Medical 
Certifi
 cation of Cause of Death66 or the Survey of Causes 
of Death67 from India, several years of census and verbal 
autopsy data from Indonesia and Ethiopia, and maternal 
mortality surveillance data from China. MMEIG 2015 
similarly did not include vital registration data from Iran 
and the Dominican Republic or sibling history from 
Jordan, all of which led to very diff
 erent estimates of 
levels and trends of maternal mortality in those countries. 
In total, 396 sources were excluded by MMEIG 2015. In 
many cases the MMEIG 2015 documentation does not 
describe reasons for not including these data. In future 
iterations of both the GBD and MMEIG estimation, the 
groups should both work more closely to ensure relevant 
data sources are included in both analyses.
Diff
 erences in processing methods of sibling history 
data are important, especially for countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa. The nine countries without maternal mortality data 
in the GBD 2015 analysis were Andorra, Angola, Equatorial 
Guinea, the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall 
Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Somalia, and Vanuatu.

MMEIG 2015 had no data for 23 GBD 2015 countries or 
territories, including Angola, Djibouti, Federated States of 
Micronesia, Guinea Bissau, North Korea, Palestine, Papua 
New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Tonga, 
and Vanuatu. They did not generate estimates for 
American Samoa, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, 
Bermuda, Dominica, Greenland, Guam, Marshall Islands, 
Seychelles, Taiwan, and the Virgin Islands.
GBD 2015 used single-year sibling history survival data 
from each source, applied Gakidou-King weights to 
adjust for survivor bias, corrected for incidental HIV 
deaths using country-year-age-specifi
 c information about 
the population attributable fraction of HIV to maternal 
death, and used Bayesian noise-reduction algorithms to 
help to reduce stochastic variability in data. On aggregate, 
this approach maximises capture of underlying infor-
mation about levels and trends of pregnancy-related 
mortality in health surveys. MMEIG 2015 combined all 
data from each survey and assigned them to the midpoint 
year of the recall period. They then uniformly applied a 
correction factor to reduce every datum by 10% or 15%, 
depending on the geography. The resulting MMEIG 
dataset is fairly sparse in some locations, and estimates 
are driven by regression coeffi
  cients. Examples can be 
seen in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, 
Ghana, and Saudi Arabia (see appendix pp 303–498). We 
would encourage MMEIG to consider using single-year 
sibling history data in their future analyses, because this 
diff
 erence in data processing might be driving divergence 
in trends from the early part of the MDG period, 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
Another important dataset diff
 erence is in the method 
used for processing and adjustment of vital registration 
data. GBD uses a standardised approach for all causes of 
death, empirically analysing every location’s single-year 
vital registration quality to guide dynamic adjustments to 
raw data (appendix pp 519–652). In past studies, MMEIG 
applied a default correction factor of 1·5 to all vital 
registration data. That method was modifi
 ed in two ways 
in 2015. First, correction factors for vital registration were 
adjusted to match the deaths in published surveillance 
studies for those countries that had completed them. 
Second, MMEIG 2015 reclassifi
 ed selected recent years 
of vital registration data as special studies. These 
reclassifi
 ed years were not subjected to the 1·5 correction 
factor, but earlier years were. This reclassifi
 cation 
resulted in estimates showing faster declines in the 
MMR than are supported by raw data. These eight 
countries where the MMEIG results are aff
 ected by the 
selective vital registration reclassifi
 cation are Brazil, 
Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, 
Mexico, and Uruguay. The criteria used for reclassifi
 cation 
of vital registration as special studies are not clearly 
documented, and it is unclear if these criteria have been 
objectively applied to all country-years of vital registration.
MMEIG implemented a Bayesian approach to estimate 
maternal mortality for the fi
 rst time in their 2015 
estimates, which substantially improved their model fi
 t 
in countries with long time series of data. However, the 
base MMEIG model still relied on a simple linear 
mixed-eff
 ects model with only three covariates—gross 
domestic product, general fertility rate, and skilled birth 
attendance—and country random eff
 ects. By contrast, 
the GBD 2015 used four families of statistical models 
and used 15 diff
 erent covariates to develop ensemble 
models that were chosen based on a robust out-of-sample 
validity testing. MMEIG models were developed for the 
aggregate age range of 15–49 years, while the GBD 2015 
estimates were generated separately for nine diff
 erent 
5-year age bands ranging from 10–54 years. The latter 
approach has the noted advantage of being able to 
automatically adjust for compositional bias if the age 
structure of the sample population is diff
 erent from the 
general population. This approach also facilitates insight 
into potentially divergent age trends in maternal 
mortality within individual populations, matching them 
with corresponding shifts in age-specifi
 c fertility. Such 
an approach is crucial to singling out—for example—the 
contribution of adolescent fertility to overall maternal 
mortality levels and trends in maternal mortality. 
We therefore believe age-specifi
 c maternal mortality 
estimates, covering the entire reproductive age range, 
should be standard practice.
While recognising the potential caveats of adult 
mortality rates estimated using sibling survival, we made 
important improvements in GBD 2015 in accounting for 
selection bias and recall bias. We incorporated the 
uncertainty around adult mortality rate into our all-cause 
mortality estimation process for countries aff
 ected by 
HIV
/AIDS in the sub-Saharan Africa regions. We did this 
by using single-year data for adult mortality rate from 
sibling survival modules—instead of pooled data for 
5-year periods—and the crude death rate due to 
HIV
/AIDS into the space-time Gaussian process 
regression that generates adult mortality rate estimates. 
This approach helped to reconcile between all-cause 
mortality estimates based on demographic sources and 
the HIV-specifi
 c mortality estimates using EPP-Spectrum, 
thus allowing us to better capture levels and trends of 
mortality in adult women, especially in western and 
central sub-Saharan Africa. By contrast, mortality 
estimates from World Population Prospects 2015 do not 
incorporate all available data, do not explicitly reconcile 
HIV-related and background mortality estimates, and for 
many countries are largely based on a tabular model life 
table system derived from that age pattern of mortality 
from countries in the 1950s and 1960s and a single entry 
parameter, the under-5 mortality rate. Such a system is 
likely to misrepresent the changing relation between 
mortality in child age groups and adult age groups68 and, 
as we see from World Population Prospects 2015, 
all-cause mortality estimates in the 1990s, might 
overestimate mortality in western and central sub-
Saharan Africa.69

The GBD approach to quantifi
 cation of uncertainty 
assumes that uncertainty is uncorrelated in all locations. 
MMEIG has in the past assumed uncertainty is 
50% correlated and 50% uncorrelated. This approach 
has led to very large uncertainty intervals in many 
countries and at the global level in past reports. MMEIG 
2015 has implemented a more rigorous statistical 
approach to estimate uncertainty but has chosen the 
non-standard step of reporting only 80% UIs, despite 
the general global health practice of reporting 95% UIs. 
The rationale provided for this decision was that 95% UIs 
cannot be reliably interpreted, although why 80% 
intervals are more interpretable is unclear. In the 
interests of transparency and comparability to other 
analyses such as the GBD, we hope that in future 
estimates MMEIG will provide 95% UIs along with 
other narrower intervals.
This analysis, like many before it, has a number of 
limitations. First, despite continued increase in the size 
and breadth of our data sources, we still have no data 
for maternal mortality from several countries and 
territories. In several other locations, especially low-SDI 
regions, we continue to rely on data reporting aggregate 
pregnancy-related deaths from surveys and censuses. 
Unlike verbal autopsy and vital registration sources, 
survey and census data sources do not diff
 erentiate 
between maternal and non-maternal (incidental) deaths 
during pregnancy. The degree to which underreporting 
due to survival and recall bias off
 sets overreporting due 
to inclusion of incidental deaths is unclear and is 
further reason to advocate for improved data collection 
eff
 orts. Second, although we report results on the entire 
period from 1990 to 2015, because of large lag times in 
release of data we have not been able to include any data 
from 2015 and data from only 13 countries from 2014. 
Final 2015 results are thus based on recent historical 
data and model results. Third, our CODEm models 
have limited ability to capture non-stochastic rapid 
increases and decreases that might occur as a result of 
epidemics such as Ebola virus and H1N1 infl
 uenza,70,71 
armed confl
 icts,72 or other events. Fourth, this report has 
examined nine specifi
 c causal categories of maternal 
death, but this classifi
 cation system is certainly not 
exhaustive. We have not evaluated the contributions of 
some important chronic conditions known to increase 
risk to pregnant women such as obesity, diabetes, heart 
disease, haemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell 
disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic hyper-
tension, or specifi
 c risk factors that might contribute to 
mortality. Our evaluation of ectopic pregnancy, abortion, 
and miscarriage together limits the ability to specifi
 cally 
quantify the burden of unsafe abortion. We likewise 
have not disaggregated the other direct obstetric 
complications 
category 
to 
quantify 
the 
relative 
importance of anaesthesia complications, cardio 
myo-
pathy, and pulmonary embolism, all of which are known 
to be important contributors to maternal mortality in 
many settings. Continuing to improve on the specifi
 city 
of our analysis of the underlying cause of maternal 
death will be expected to improve the clinical use of 
GBD estimates. Fifth, while the GBD approach has the 
ability to provide excellent detail on geographic and 
temporal trends in maternal mortality, it has limited 
ability to explore subpopulations that are not 
geographically based, including indigenous populations 
or other high-risk groups who might have higher MMR 
due to cultural, religious, or other diff
 erences.
In conclusion, a shift from a relative target of percent 
reduction in MDGs to an absolute threshold target of an 
MMR of 70 in the SDGs has important ramifi
 cations. It 
will emphasise countries with high maternal mortality 
rates over those that have already achieved the goal. Such 
emphasis might be benefi
 cial in that it should help to 
focus additional international attention and resources on 
those countries who have the farthest distance to go. On 
the other hand, pre-emptive so-called achievement of 
SDG 3·1 has the potential to sap political and fi
 nancial 
investment in reproductive health in countries that still 
have major numbers of preventable maternal deaths, 
especially when continued progress is likely to depend 
largely on improvements in overall health systems 
performance.73–77 One approach to mitigate this risk 
would be to promote SDG 3.1 not only as a threshold goal 
for nations on aggregate, but also as a target for all 
subpopulations within each. This approach will require 
all stakeholders to make disaggregated data and 
information about women’s, children’s, and adolescents’ 
health publicly available.5 Furthermore, as the global 
community pursues SDG 3.1, monitoring and reporting 
on all aspects of reproductive health care as outlined in 
SDG 3.7 will be important.5 Achievement of this will 
require the international community to pay heed to the 
intricately related issues of immigration, armed confl
 icts, 
epidemics and pandemics, environment, economic 
instability, and gender equality, all of which can have 
substantial eff
 ects on the availability and quality of 
reproductive health services and women’s willingness to 
seek them.
Global progress in reducing maternal mortality has 
been accelerating in the past 15 years, but there is still 
major work left to do. More than 250 000 women died 
during or following pregnancy in 2015, most of which 
were preventable deaths. Every woman that died left 
children, widowers, family, and their communities 
behind. The quantitative eff
 ect of MDG 5 is diffi
  cult to 
measure, but it is even harder to dispute the notion that 
it has united the international community in striving to 
decrease maternal mortality. With the ratifi
 cation of 
SDG 3.1 and SDG 3.7, relevant stakeholders need to 
make informed decisions about how to prioritise actions 
needed to bring about continued progress, and they can 
only do that with better data. As we continue on the path 
toward 2030, necessary and urgent steps will include 
rapid improvement in cause of death data collection

systems and data dissemination coupled with more 
eff
 ective and widespread action and policies to promote 
education of girls and women, provide them with 
comprehensive family planning services, and ensure that 
each and every woman has access to the types of 
reproductive care they need to survive—and thrive.
