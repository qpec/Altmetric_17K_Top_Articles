Abstract
Background: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended the Oncotype DX� Breast Recurrence Score�
(RS) assay as an option for informing adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in node-negative, oestrogen receptor (ER)þ, human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer assessed to be at intermediate risk of recurrence based on clinicopathological factors.
We evaluated the impact of RS testing on adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making in routine clinical practice in a UK Cancer Network.
Methods: RS testing was performed in 201 females with newly diagnosed, ERþ, HER2-negative, invasive breast cancer who underwent
breast surgery with curative intent, were calculated to have a >3% overall survival benefit at 10 years from adjuvant chemotherapy based
on PREDICT, and were considered for adjuvant chemotherapy. The impact of RS testing on adjuvant treatment decisions/associated cost
was assessed.
Results: In all patients, the multi-disciplinary team recommended chemotherapy but the RS result allowed 127/201 patients (63.2%) to
avoid unnecessary adjuvant chemotherapy. Amongst ERþ, HER2-negative, node-negative patients (eligible for Oncotype DX testing in
UK guidelines), 60.3% were spared chemotherapy. In node-positive patients, the assay reduced the use of chemotherapy by 69.2%. The
use of RS testing to guide treatment in these 201 patients was associated with significant cost saving (when considering the cost of RS
testing for all patients plus chemotherapy and its associated cost for 74 patients).
Conclusions: Incorporating RS testing into routine clinical practice for selected node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients
significantly reduces the use of chemotherapy ( p < 0.001) with its associated morbidity and costs.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in
the UK and, despite significant advances in screening,
diagnosis and treatment, it resulted in almost 12 000 deaths
in 2012.1 Although adjuvant chemotherapy improves sur-
vival in early breast cancer,2 for some patients, the associ-
ated potential toxicities and the negative impact on quality-
of-life may outweigh the benefits. The diverse clinical
behaviour of breast cancer relates to its individual molecu-
lar pathology. Gene expression profiling can provide better
risk discrimination relative to traditional clinicopatholog-
ical factors and more accurately identify breast cancer pa-
tients with a low risk of recurrence who are predicted to

The Oncotype DX� Breast Recurrence Score� Assay
(Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA) is a 21-gene
assay from which a Recurrence Score (RS) result between
0 and 100 is calculated. It has been validated as an assay
that is prognostic as well as predictive of benefit from adju-
vant chemotherapy in patients with oestrogen receptor

human

(HER2)-negative, early stage, invasive breast cancer treated
with endocrine therapy.5e10 Patients are classified as being
at low, intermediate or high risk of distant recurrence based
on their RS result. The RS has been validated in node-
negative patients (for example, in prospectively-defined an-
alyses using archived samples from the NSABP B-14 and B-
20 studies)5,10 as well as in node-positive patients (in
prospectively-defined analyses using archived samples
from the SWOG-8814 and TransATAC studies).6,7
RS testing is included in guidelines from the American
Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive
Cancer Network, European Society for Medical Oncology
(ESMO) and St. Gallen.11e14 In 2013, the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, recom-
mended RS testing, as an option for informing adjuvant
chemotherapy decisions in node-negative, early breast can-
cer assessed to be at intermediate risk of recurrence based
on clinicopathological factors.15 Consequently, in the UK,
RS testing has been available since 2015 to all patients
treated in the National Health Service (NHS) and meet
the NICE recommendation.
In the NICE DG10 guidance, support for using the assay
was based on “the clinical utility of the test, including
robust evidence on the impact of Oncotype DX on clinical
decision-making”.15 To inform healthcare decisions further,
NICE recommended that collection of data on the clinical
utility of the assay in routine UK clinical practice should
be undertaken.
Before the NICE recommendation, the clinical utility of
RS testing was evaluated in a Greater Manchester-based,
prospective pilot study from May to December 2012. The
data from the pilot study, together with retrospective audit
of a series of patients who underwent RS testing beyond
the pilot study, collected between December 2012 and
March 2015, are included in the present analysis. Prior to
the NICE DG10 guidance, the study included both node-
negative and node-positive patients. The aim of the present
analysis was to evaluate the impact of RS testing on chemo-
therapy use in the cohort, as well as in subpopulations rele-
vant to breast cancer clinical practice.
Patients and methods
The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate
the impact of RS testing on adjuvant chemotherapy
decision making in ERþ, HER2-negative breast cancer pa-
tients in routine clinical practice in the NHS. The study was
prospective

with
analysis
retrospectively
following treatment decisions made based on standard clin-
icopathological data and the RS result. No ethical approval
was required as the analysis included patients from a pro-
spective pilot study and additional patients that were
audited after the pilot study.
Patient population
The current analysis includes 201 patients: 82 patients
from a Greater Manchester-based, prospective pilot study
designed to evaluate the clinical value of RS testing (time-
frame of testing: 5/2012e12/2012) plus 119 patients from
an audit beyond the pilot study (timeframe of testing: 12/
2012e3/2015). The inclusion criteria were: (1) females
with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer who under-
went breast and axillary surgery with curative intent; (2)
a decision to refer the patient to an oncologist for chemo-
therapy made at a breast cancer multi-disciplinary team
(MDT) meeting; (3) ERþ (Quick score � 5/8) and HER2
0, 1 þ or non-amplified; (4) axillary lymph node-negative
or node-positive (post-menopausal females only); and (5)
at least intermediate risk disease (PREDICT overall sur-
vival benefit from chemotherapy estimated to be >3% at
10 years). In addition, patients had to be considered fit
for chemotherapy.
Data analysis
During the study period, data on clinicopathological fac-
tors, RS results and subsequent chemotherapy usage were
collected. The data were analysed retrospectively to deter-
mine the percentage of patients who received chemo-
therapy following RS testing. Descriptive statistics were
used for all analyses. Chi-squared tests were performed
to determine whether there was a significant relationship
between the RS category (low, RS < 18, intermediate RS
18e30, high, RS � 31) and chemotherapy use with p-
values quoted at a 0.05 significance level. Scatterplots
were generated to evaluate correlation between PREDICT
or Ki67 and the RS, with correlation coefficients (R2)
generated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA).
Clinical utility
All patients in this study had a MDT recommendation
for adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinicopathological
factors and PREDICT (a prognostic tool designed to esti-
mate breast cancer survival and the benefits of hormonal
therapy, chemotherapy and trastuzumab)16 calculation. It
was assumed that without a RS result, all patients would
have received chemotherapy. Treatment recommendations
were informed by the assay as follows: no chemotherapy
932
J. Loncaster et al. / EJSO 43 (2017) 931e937
 for low RS (<18) patients and chemotherapy for high RS
(�31) patients. For intermediate RS (18e30) patients, a
consultation was held with the patient to discuss the poten-
tial chemotherapy benefits, informed by the RS result, and a
treatment decision was made with the patient.
Budget impact
A model was constructed to evaluate the budgetary im-
plications of RS testing in this population. The calculation
captured the acquisition costs of the RS assay, based on
the published commercial list price (GBP 2580), and sav-
ings from reductions in chemotherapy. Chemotherapy costs
were taken from the NICE health technology assessment
published by Ward et al. (2013), reported as GBP 6181.16
per patient and taking into account the total cost of chemo-
therapy including drug acquisition cost, administration and
monitoring, costs of treating short-term adverse events, sec-
ondary prevention of febrile neutropenia, and long-term
adverse event costs.17 As actualised costs were used for
chemotherapy, and RS testing represented a one-off initial
cost, no discounting was applied to future costs or clinical
benefits. The base-case budget impact analysis assumed
that all patients referred from the MDT to an oncologist
for chemotherapy would receive it in the absence of RS
testing. To explore the impact of a proportion of patients
refusing chemotherapy, sensitivity analysis was performed
with the alternative assumption that only 84.6% of these pa-
tients would receive chemotherapy (in line with the percent-
age of patients who received chemotherapy in the high RS
group following RS testing in the present study).
Results
Patient and tumour characteristics
The study included 201 patients who were treated for
early breast cancer in Greater Manchester between May
2012 and March 2015. Patients and tumour characteristics
are detailed in Table 1. The mean age was 55.2 years (range,
24e77). The mean tumour size was 26.1 mm (range, 2e80).
Of the 201 patients, 136 (67.7%) had node-negative disease,
and would therefore be eligible for RS testing according to
current NICE guidance.
RS results and clinicopathological factors
The mean RS result was 20.5 (range, 4e54). Most pa-
tients had a low or intermediate RS result. The distribution
of patients by RS categories was: 86 (42.8%) low, 89
(44.3%) intermediate, and 26 (12.9%) high. The mean
10-year survival benefit for chemotherapy according to
PREDICT was 5.8% (range, 3.1e15.5%). There was no
correlation between the RS and the PREDICT tool esti-
mates of 10-year overall survival percentage benefit from
chemotherapy (R2 ¼ 0.05, Fig. 1A). A Ki67 result was
available in 188 patients (93.5%) with a mean Ki67 of
28.9 (range, 1e81). There was a weak correlation between
the RS result and Ki67 (R2 ¼ 0.22, Fig. 1B).
Impact of the RS results on treatment
recommendations
The additional information provided by the RS result had
a significant chemotherapy sparing impact overall, with
only
74
patients
(36.8%)
receiving
chemotherapy
( p < 0.001, Table 2). The remaining 127 patients (63.2%)
received endocrine therapy as their only systemic treatment.
In the low RS group, only 4 of 86 patients (4.7%)
received chemotherapy following RS testing compared
with 48 of 89 (53.9%) in the intermediate RS group
(Table 2, Fig. 2). Within the intermediate RS group, the
magnitude of the RS result influenced the treatment deci-
sion, with 23 of 54 patients (42.6%) with RS result of
18e24 receiving chemotherapy, compared with 25 of 35
patients (71.4%) with RS results of 25e30. In the high
RS group, 22 of 26 patients (84.6%) received chemo-
therapy. There was a significant association between the
RS group and chemotherapy treatment ( p < 0.001).
Within the group of patients with node-negative disease
eligible for testing based on current NICE guidelines, 1 of
46 (2.2%) with a low RS result subsequently received

Budget impact
The estimated cost of chemotherapy for the study popu-
lation assuming no RS testing, would have been GBP
1,242,413 based on the health technology assessment refer-
enced by the NICE DG10 recommendation.17 Of the 201
patients who were tested, only 74 received chemotherapy,
leading to a total cost (chemotherapy cost plus test cost)
of GBP 975,986. This equates to a total cost saving of
GBP 266,427 as 127 patients were spared chemotherapy.
In the population eligible for RS testing based on NICE
guidance (node-negative patients), the total cost without
RS testing was estimated at GBP 840,638 for 136 patients.
RS testing spared chemotherapy for 82 patients, at a total
cost (chemotherapy cost plus test cost) of GBP 684,663,
which is a cost saving of approximately GBP 155,975. In
node-positive patients, who are not eligible for RS testing
under the current NICE DG10 recommendations, testing
reduced overall costs by GBP 110,452 as 45 of 65 patients
were spared chemotherapy.
Sensitivity analysis assuming that only 84.6% of patients
would have agreed to receive chemotherapy in the scenario
without RS testing, indicated that the total cost of

testing of all patients in this scenario led to an overall cost
saving of GBP 75,096 due to chemotherapy sparing,
comprised of a savings of GBP 26,517 in node-negative pa-
tients and GBP 48,579 in node-positive patients.
Discussion
Our findings demonstrated that using the RS assay
significantly influenced adjuvant chemotherapy decisions
in women with intermediate risk ER þ HER2-negative
early breast cancer ( p < 0.001). In this analysis of 201 pa-
tients from the Greater Manchester area, using the RS assay
resulted in avoidance of chemotherapy in 63.2% of patients.
Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the predic-
tive and prognostic information provided by the RS assay
with respect to chemotherapy outcomes.5e10 The present
study was designed to investigate the influence of the assay
on adjuvant treatment decisions in routine clinical practice.
The distribution of RS categories in our study was compara-
ble with those seen in a meta-analysis of previous studies.18
The reduction in chemotherapy use observed in the present
study is greater than that reported previously.19e21 This is
because in the current study, a threshold for chemotherapy
benefit (PREDICT 10-year overall survival benefit of
>3%) was required before RS testing was undertaken,
whereas previous studies performed the test on sequential
patients with ER þ HER2-negative breast cancer discussed
at the MDT.
This study demonstrates the impact of testing in routine
clinical practice in patients assessed as having at least an in-
termediate risk breast cancer based on PREDICT, and in-
cludes not only patients meeting NICE criteria, but
additionally those with node-positive disease. Use of the
assay changed chemotherapy prescribing practices in the hos-
pitals included in this study. There was a strong association
between the RS result and the decision to prescribe chemo-
therapy. Still, individual patient wishes and other clinician-
patient considerations resulted in some patients with low
RS results receiving chemotherapy and somewith high RS re-
sults not receiving chemotherapy. Overall, 60.3% of node-
negative patients and 69.2% of node-positive patients were
spared chemotherapy following RS testing.
It is well established that chemotherapy is associated
with long-term adverse effects including cardiotoxicity,
secondary leukaemia, or effects on cognitive impairment,
as well as having a dramatic impact on quality-of-life.22
For example, cognitive impairment alone following chemo-
therapy can have a huge effect on working life and is often
a cause of increased absenteeism and lost workplace pro-
ductivity.23,24 An economic assessment of routine RS
testing in the UK by Holt et al. (2013) demonstrated that
the use of the assay is associated with improved life expec-
tancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy compared to cur-
rent clinical practice and is likely to be cost-effective in the
UK using current thresholds.19 The budget impact analysis
from the present study confirms that there is a substantial
cost saving in both NICE eligible (node-negative patients)
as well as node-positive patients. Additionally, it should
be noted that this analysis used the list price for the RS
assay as opposed to the confidential price agreed with
NICE, and is therefore a conservative estimate of cost
savings.
Our findings suggest that using the RS assay to inform
treatment decisions in node-positive patients may be just
as influential as in node-negative cases, although current
NICE recommendations limits its use to node-negative pa-
tients.15 Our findings are consistent with results from 2 pro-
spective trials. The TAILORx trial in node-negative, ERþ,
HER2-negative breast cancer has recently reported that pa-
tients with RS < 11 who were not given chemotherapy had
a 93.8% 5-year invasive disease free survival.8 Similarly,
the German PlanB study in patients with high-risk node-
negative or node-positive disease (1e3 positive nodes) re-
ported a 94% disease-free survival at 5 years for patients
with RS � 11.9 The results from these 2 studies indicate
that RS testing can be used to reliably identify both node-
negative and node-positive patients who are unlikely to
benefit from chemotherapy but who would have suffered
the short and long-term sequelae of treatment.
A potential limitation of the study is the assumption that
all patients recommended chemotherapy by the MDT
would have received it in routine clinical practice without
RS testing. To address this, a sensitivity analysis was per-
formed in the budget impact analysis. Another limitation
is that RS testing was only performed in a proportion of pa-
tients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria. It is possible that
the clinicians and patients choosing to use the assay were
those who were more likely to be influenced by its results.
Also, this is a retrospective analysis of patients who under-
went RS testing.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the clinical utility
of RS testing in routine practice showing that it reduces
chemotherapy use in ERþ, HER2-negative early breast
cancer. Current NICE guidance is restricted to patients
with node-negative breast cancer, and this study demon-
strates similar clinician confidence in the assay for both
node-negative patients and post-menopausal node-positive
patients. The reduction in chemotherapy use, in appropri-
ately selected patients, for whom chemotherapy would
have otherwise been recommended, is greater than reported
in other studies. Using the RS assay in routine clinical prac-
tice in the UK, even in node-positive patients, could help
maintain patients’ quality-of-life and reduce the economic
burden of breast cancer care.
