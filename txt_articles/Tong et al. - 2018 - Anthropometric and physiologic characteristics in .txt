ABSTRACT
Background: A detailed description of anthropometric and phys-
iologic characteristics of persons in different diet groups is
lacking.
Objective: We aimed to perform cross-sectional analyses of diet
group with anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in a large
cohort in the United Kingdom.
Design: The UK Biobank recruited ∼500,000 middle-aged partici-
pants throughout the United Kingdom in 2006–2010. Anthropomet-
ric indexes (height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body com-
position) and other physiologic characteristics (heel bone mineral
density, grip strength, blood pressure, pulse rate) were measured fol-
lowing standardized protocols. We estimated the age-adjusted means
of each characteristic in 6 diet groups (198,166 regular meat eaters,
199,784 low meat eaters, 4381 poultry eaters, 9674 fish eaters, 6366
vegetarians, and 378 vegans) in white women and men, and in 2 diet
groups (3322 meat eaters and 1186 vegetarians) in British Indian
women and men.
Results: In white women, after adjustment for age and compared
with regular meat eaters, non–red meat eaters had lower adiposity
(e.g., 4.5% lower body fat in vegan women) and lower systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (−4.2 and −3.3 mm Hg, respectively), and
generally lower heel bone mineral density t-score (−0.26). Patterns
of differences by diet group were similar in white men. In the In-
dian population, compared with meat eaters, vegetarian women were
shorter (−1.1 cm) and had lower lean mass (−0.5 kg), and both veg-
etarian women and men had lower grip strength (−1.3 and −1.4 kg,
respectively). No significant differences in the other characteristics
were observed.
Conclusions: Differences in anthropometric and physiologic char-
acteristics were observed across diet groups in white partici-
pants, but fewer differences were observed in British Indian
participants. The observed differences may be important as in-
termediate markers of long-term health in different diet groups.

INTRODUCTION
Previous literature indicates that vegetarians generally have
lower, and therefore more optimal, BMI, waist circumference,
and blood pressure than meat eaters (1–3). However, less is
known about differences between diet groups in other body-
composition measures or physiologic characteristics such as bone
mineral density (BMD), grip strength, or pulse rate (4–6). Over-
all, few large studies have comprehensively assessed anthropo-
metric and physiologic characteristics by detailed categorization
of diet groups.
Because differences in anthropometric measures and other
physical attributes may, in turn, influence the risk of overall mor-
tality and the incidence of noncommunicable diseases such as di-
abetes, cardiovascular diseases, and fractures (7–10), an under-
standing of the link between diet group and these characteristics
is important for establishing mechanisms that link diet to dis-
ease outcomes. Therefore, our aim in this study was to present
a detailed description of anthropometric indexes and physiologic
measures across white and British Indian participants in different
habitual diet groups with the use of data from a large-population
cohort, the UK Biobank.

METHODS
Study design and participants
The UK Biobank study is a prospective cohort of >500,000
people aged 40–69 y, who were recruited in 2006–2010 across
the United Kingdom (11). The scientific rationale and design of
the UK Biobank study has been described in detail elsewhere
(12). In brief, persons who lived within reasonable traveling dis-
tance (∼25 km) of 1 of the 22 assessment centers across Eng-
land, Wales, and Scotland were identified from National Health
Service registers and invited to participate in the study. Permis-
sion for access to patient records for recruitment was approved
by the Patient Information Advisory Group (subsequently re-
placed by the National Information Governance Board for Health
and Social Care) in England and Wales and the Community
Health Index Advisory Group in Scotland. Overall, ∼5.5% of
the invitees attended a baseline visit (13) during which they gave
informed consent to participate in the UK Biobank using a sig-
nature capture device and completed a touch-screen question-
naire that asked about sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle
exposures (smoking, diet and alcohol intake, and physical ac-
tivity), and general health and medical history. For this study,
we excluded participants who reported that they had changed
their diet in the past 5 y due to illness or who did not answer
this question (n = 57,907). All of the participants also attended
a computer-assisted personal interview and had physical mea-
surements taken. In addition to the touch-screen questionnaire,
additional dietary information was collected with the use of a
Web-based 24-h dietary assessment tool (14), which was admin-
istered ≤5 times in a large subsample of participants (∼210,000).
A participant flow chart of this study is included as Supple-
mental Figure 1. This observational study was registered at
http://www.isrctn.com/ as ISRCTN10125697.
Ethnicity classification
On the touch-screen questionnaire, participants were asked to
select their ethnicity from options of “White,” “Mixed,” “Asian
or Asian British,” “Black or Black British,” “Chinese,” “Other
ethnic group,” “Do not know,” or “Prefer not to answer.” Partic-
ipants were included for analyses if they identified as “white” or
as “Asian or Asian British” and subsequently as “Indian.” The
white population was included because it made up the majority
of the UK Biobank population (∼94%), and the British Indian
population was included due to the large proportion of vegetari-
ans in this population group (24.6% compared with 1.7% in the
overall cohort).
Diet group classification
For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information
from the touch-screen questionnaire was used. Participants were
asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef,
lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish,
or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from
“Never” to “Once or more daily.” Participants were also asked
whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy
products.
On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat
eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians,
and vegans) were defined for the white population. To rank
the participants by weekly red and processed-meat consumption
based on the touch-screen, we summed the frequencies for pro-
cessed meat, beef, pork, and lamb or mutton by using the follow-
ing coding: “Never” = 0, “Less than once a week” = 0.5, “Once
a week” = 1, “2–4 times a week” = 3, “5–6 times a week” = 5.5,
and “Once or more daily” = 7. Regular meat eaters were defined
as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or
pork) or processed meat >3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters
were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed
meat ≤3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate. Poultry eaters
were defined as participants who reported never consuming any
red or processed meat but who did eat poultry. Fish eaters were
participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat,
processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish. Vege-
tarians were defined as participants who reported that they never
consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who
reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods
containing eggs, or dairy products. A total of 2630 white par-
ticipants who did not answer the relevant questions to be classi-
fied into a diet group were excluded from our analyses. For the
British Indian population, 2 diet groups (meat eaters and vege-
tarians) were defined due to the smaller numbers in this popula-
tion group. Meat eaters were defined as participants who reported
eating any red meat, processed meat, or poultry; and vegetarians
were defined as participants who reported that they did not eat
any meat or fish but did eat eggs, dairy products, or both. A to-
tal of 278 British Indian participants were excluded because they
did not answer the relevant questions, or because they were fish
eaters or vegans. Separately, information collected with the use of
the Web-based 24-h dietary assessment tool was used to estimate
food and nutrient intakes in each diet group.
Anthropometric and physiologic measures
Anthropometric and physiologic measures were collected on
all participants during the baseline visit by trained staff follow-
ing a standardized protocol. At the physical measures station,
participants were asked to remove their socks and shoes. Height
was measured with the use of the Seca 202 height measure (Seca,
Hamburg, Germany). Waist (at the natural indent) and hip (widest
point) circumferences were measured over light clothes with the
use of the Seca-200 tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany).
Weight and bioimpedance were measured by using the Tanita
BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), from
which percentages of body fat and lean mass were estimated.
BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height (meters)
squared. Calcaneal bone density was taken on the left heel with
the use of a Norland McCue Contact Ultrasound Bone Analyzer
(Norland, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA), with participants sitting
upright; and a heel BMD t-score was calculated on the basis of
the measured BMD values. Hand-grip strength for each hand
was taken by using the Jamar Hydraulic hand dynamometer
(Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana, USA), and
we considered both the higher grip-strength value of either hand
and average grip strength of the 2 hands for our analyses. Sys-
tolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and
pulse rate were taken with the use of the Omron HEM-7015IT
digital blood pressure monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) after
participants have been seated for ≥5 min, and the averages of 2
measurements, taken ≥1 min apart, were used for analyses.

 ANTHROPOMETRY AND PHYSIOLOGY IN UK VEGETARIANS
911
Statistical analyses
Summary baseline characteristics of the cohort were tabulated
by 6 diet groups in white women and men and by 2 diet groups
in British Indian women and men. With the use of linear regres-
sion, we estimated the age-adjusted (5-y age groups from <45,
45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, and ≥65 y) means of the anthro-
pometric and physiologic characteristics in each diet group. The
characteristics studied were height, weight, BMI, waist circum-
ference, hip circumference, body fat percentage, lean mass, heel
BMD (as original values and as a t-score), grip strength (as origi-
nal values and as per kilogram of lean mass), SBP, DBP, and pulse
rate, all modeled continuously. Subsequently, we additionally ad-
justed for body weight (as 2.5-kg categories) in the analyses for
heel BMD t-score; height (as 2.5-cm categories), lean mass (as
2.5-kg categories), and physical activity (as 5-unit categories in
excess metabolic equivalent-hours per week) in the analyses for
grip strength; and body fat percentage (as 2.5% categories) in the
analyses for SBP, DBP, and pulse rate. For all covariates, missing
values were coded as a missing category in the adjustment. For
each baseline characteristic and each association, post hoc pair-
wise comparisons based on linear regression models were used
to test for significant differences between the diet groups in both
white and British Indian populations, with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons in the white population. All statistical
analyses were performed with the use of Stata release 14.1 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Texas, USA), and 2-sided P values <0.05
were considered significant.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Together, 229,806 white women (86,432 high meat eaters,
128,429 low meat eaters, 3429 poultry eaters, 6988 fish eaters,
4305 vegetarians, and 223 vegans), 188,943 white men (111,734
regular meat eaters, 71,355 low meat eaters, 952 poultry eaters,
2686 fish eaters, 2061 vegetarians, and 155 vegans), 2183 Indian
women (1422 meat eaters and 761 vegetarians), and 2325 Indian
men (1900 meat eaters and 425 vegetarians) were included in our
analyses. Overall, 98% of the non-meat eaters (fish eaters, veg-
etarians, and vegans) had not eaten any meat for ≥1 y, and 92%
(89% in fish eaters to 96% in vegetarians) had not eaten any meat
for ≥5 y.
In the white population, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans
were generally younger, of lower area-level socioeconomic sta-
tus [measured by the Townsend score (15)], more educated, and
less likely to smoke than were regular and low meat eaters and
poultry eaters (Tables 1 and 2). Fish eaters and vegetarians were
less likely to report long-standing illness. In white women, vege-
tarians were more likely to have active jobs, but the opposite was
observed in white men. Overall, vegans had the highest percent-
age of energy from carbohydrates but the lowest percentage of
energy from protein, total fat, and saturated fat.
In the British Indian population, vegetarians were slightly
older and less likely to smoke than were meat eaters (Table 3).
Overall, British Indian vegetarians also had lower alcohol con-
sumption, a higher percentage of energy from carbohydrates, and
a lower percentage of energy from protein and fat than Indian
meat eaters.
Anthropometric and physiologic characteristics
Anthropometric and physiologic characteristics of white and
British Indian Biobank participants in the different diet groups
are presented in Figures 1–4. For the white population, results
reported in the following text represent significant differences
after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and by
using regular meat eaters as the reference group (Supplemen-
tal Tables 1 and 2). Overall, in white women (Figure 1) and
white men (Figure 2), low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish
eaters, vegetarians, and vegans had lower body weight (ve-
gans compared with regular meat eaters: −7.2 kg in women
and −9.1 kg in men), BMI (in kg/m2; −2.7 and −3.2), waist
circumference (−4.8 and −7.3 cm), hip circumference (−5.3
and −4.4 cm), body fat percentage (−4.5% and −4.1%), and
lean mass (−1.6 and −3.5 kg) compared with regular meat
eaters. In women, poultry eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians
had a lower heel BMD t-score (−0.08 in vegetarians) than the
regular meat eaters, and in men, low meat eaters had a higher
heel BMD t-score (+0.05), but only the difference in poultry
eaters in women remained significant upon adjustment for body
weight.
For grip strength (higher value of either hand), compared with
regular meat eaters white men who were low meat eaters had
higher grip strength (+0.2 kg), whereas fish eaters and vegetar-
ians had lower grip strength (−1.1 and −1.7 kg, respectively).
The magnitudes of these differences were generally attenuated
upon adjustment for height, lean mass, and physical activity, but
remained significant in fish eaters and vegetarians. There was no
significant difference in grip strength between regular meat eaters
and the other diet groups in women. When we examined grip
strength per kilogram of lean mass, the extreme diet groups (ve-
gans and regular meat eaters) had similar values for both women
and men. Results were similar when we examined average grip
strength of the 2 hands instead of the higher value of either hand
(results not shown).
All of the diet groups also had lower SBP (−4.2 and
−6.1 mm Hg in white vegan women and men, respectively),
and all non–red meat–eating groups had lower DBP (−3.3 and
−4.5 mm Hg) compared with the regular meat eaters; these differ-
ences were attenuated but remained significant upon adjustment
for percentage body fat. Compared with regular meat eaters, low
meat eaters, poultry eaters, and fish eaters had a lower pulse rate,
with fish eaters (−1.9 and −3.0 beats/min in women and men)
having the lowest pulse rate overall.
In the British Indian participants, vegetarian women were
shorter (−1.1 cm), had marginally lower body weight (−1.0 kg),
and less lean mass (−0.5 kg) than Indian women who were
meat eaters (Figure 3). Both British Indian vegetarian women
and men (Figure 4) also had lower grip strength than meat eaters
(−1.3 kg in women and −1.4 kg in men), and these differences
were attenuated but remained significant upon adjustment for
height, lean mass, and physical activity (Supplemental Table 3).
Both vegetarian women (−0.03 kg grip strength/kg body weight)
and men (−0.02 kg grip strength/kg body weight) had slightly
lower grip strength per kilogram of lean mass than did meat
eaters. No significant differences in the other anthropometric in-
dexes and physiologic measures studied were observed in the
British Indian populations.

(>18,000 kJ for women) and participants who reported any consumption of other hot or cold beverages (UK Biobank variable data field ID 100560), due to
inaccurate energy coding for this variable. The max numbers for these variables in white women were as follows: 36,248 meat eaters of regular consumption,
56,141 meat eaters of low consumption, 1523 poultry eaters, 3779 fish eaters, 2420 vegetarians, and 123 vegans.
DISCUSSION
Summary of results
In this large UK cohort, differences between diet groups in
anthropometric and physiologic characteristics were observed in
the white population but were less apparent in the British In-
dian population. Overall, white women and men who were poul-
try eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, or vegans generally weighed
less and had a lower BMI, waist and hip circumference, body
fat percentage, and SBP and DBP than the regular meat eaters;
and some non-meat eating diet groups had a lower heel BMD
and pulse rate. Vegetarian men had lower overall grip strength
but similar grip strength per kilogram of lean mass compared
with meat eaters. British Indian vegetarian women were, on av-
erage, shorter and had a slightly lower body weight and lower
lean mass than meat eaters, and both British Indian vegetarian
women and men had lower grip strength than British Indian meat
eaters.
Comparison with other studies
Our findings were consistent with other studies that also
reported lower BMI and waist circumference in vegetarians or
vegans compared with meat eaters in white populations (1, 16–
20), but the majority of previous studies compared only vegetar-
ians with nonvegetarians without detailed categorization of the
other diet groups. Of existing studies, only 1 study in the Adven-
tist Health Study 2 compared BMI in 5 diet groups (nonvegetar-
ians, semivegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, lacto-ovo-vegetarians,
and vegans), and reported the lowest BMI in vegans (23.6), the
highest BMI in nonvegetarians (28.8), and an intermediate BMI
in the other diet groups, consistent with our results (20). In con-
trast, there is less agreement on the association between vegetar-
ian diets and BMI in Indian populations, with 1 study reporting
a higher BMI in Indian vegetarians (21.0) compared with Indian
meat eaters (20.7) (21), and another study reporting the same BMI
(23.9) in both diet groups (22). However, both of these studies ex-
amined Indians in India rather than British Indians, and the mean

men) and participants who reported any consumption of other hot or cold beverages (UK Biobank variable data field ID 100560), due to inaccurate energy
coding for this variable. The max numbers for these variables in white men were as follows: 46,093 meat eaters of regular consumption, 31,516 meat eaters
of low consumption, 439 poultry eaters, 1435 fish eaters, 1149 vegetarians, and 86 vegans.
BMI in the first study was much lower than the average in the UK
Biobank; therefore, our study population is not directly compa-
rable.
Several studies have reported on differences in blood pres-
sure associated with vegetarian diets, and a recent meta-analysis
of 7 clinical trials and 32 observational studies reported that a
vegetarian diet was associated with a reduction in mean SBP of
4.8 mm Hg (95% CI: 3.1–6.6 mm Hg) and in DBP of 2.2 mm Hg
(95% CI: 1.0–3.5 mm Hg) on the basis of trial evidence and
6.9 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.7–9.1 mm Hg), and 4.7 mm Hg (95%
CI: 3.1–6.3 mm Hg) on the basis of observational evidence,
when compared with omnivorous diets (23). Of the studies in-
cluded, the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC)–Oxford study is another UK-based study with a large
proportion of vegetarians, and in this study mean SBP and
DBP were lowest in vegans and highest in meat eaters (age-
adjusted difference of 2.6 and 4.2 mm Hg in SBP and 1.7 and
2.8 mm Hg in DBP for women and men, respectively) and
intermediate in vegetarians and fish eaters, which is consistent
with our results (2).
The associations of vegetarian diets with other anthropometric
and physiologic characteristics are less well documented, and ex-
isting studies were small in size or results were inconclusive. For
body composition, a small study in 105 Vietnamese Buddhist ve-
gan nuns and 105 omnivorous women reported no significant dif-
ference in lean mass, fat mass, or percentage of fat mass between
vegans and omnivores (24), in contrast to other small studies (to-
tal n < 100) from Asia, which reported lower body fat percentage
in vegetarians (25, 26). For BMD, a meta-analysis of 9 studies in
2749 predominantly East Asian participants reported that lacto-
ovo-vegetarian and vegan diets were associated with 2% and 6%
lower BMD, respectively, at both the lumbar spine and femoral
neck (4). For pulse rate, 1 study in 23 vegans and 24 omnivores
reported faster daytime heart rate in vegans but no difference in

strength by habitual diet groups.
Interpretation of findings and implications
In this large population cohort in the United Kingdom, there
were substantial differences in various anthropometric and phys-
iologic characteristics between different diet groups in white
women and men, but few differences were apparent in British In-
dian women and men. The reason for this difference by ethnicity
is not clear, although one possible explanation is that vegetari-
anism is a common dietary pattern among the Indian population
and is predominantly driven by faith, cultural, and community
reasons rather than health concerns (22). As a result, dietary
choices may differ between white British and British Indian veg-
etarians, which subsequently result in differences in their health
characteristics. In addition, British Indian meat eaters in the UK
Biobank ate only small amounts of meat compared with the
white meat eaters (Tables 1–3), which could also contribute to the
smaller number of differences in anthropometric and physiologic
characteristics between meat eaters and vegetarians in the Indian
population. As another example of a distinct ethnic group, the
Adventist Health Study 2 reported lower BMI and waist
circumference in African American vegetarians than in nonveg-
etarians, although differences in blood pressure were not sig-
nificant (27). Anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in
vegetarians and nonvegetarians should be further studied in other
nonwhite populations.
Differences in adiposity between diet groups may contribute
to explaining the observed differences in blood pressure between
the diet groups. In our analyses, the differences in SBP and DBP
between diet groups were partially attenuated upon adjustment
for body fat percentage, whereas in previous studies the same
associations were partially attenuated upon adjustment for BMI
(2). Previous studies found that higher sodium intake and lower
potassium intake were associated with higher blood pressure (28,
29), but it is not clear whether there are differences in sodium or
potassium intakes between vegetarian diets and diets that contain
meat (30, 31). For pulse rate, it has been suggested that lower in-
takes of fish- or seafood-derived n–3 PUFAs may be associated
with higher heart rate (5, 32), which would be consistent with the
observed lower pulse rate in the poultry eaters and fish eaters in
the UK Biobank, because these participants have the highest fish
consumption.
It is well established that higher BMI and blood pressure
increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (7), and therefore we

may expect non-meat eaters, who tend to have lower BMIs and
blood pressure, to have a lower risk of this outcome. Evidence
from both a pooled analysis and a UK study showed that vegetar-
ians had a lower risk of ischemic heart disease (33, 34), and a US
study showed that vegetarian men but not women had a lower risk
of mortality from cardiovascular diseases than did nonvegetari-
ans (35). Likewise, other anthropometric factors, such as higher
percentage of body fat or, separately, higher pulse rate, have
also been associated with higher cardiometabolic disease risk
(36–38), and therefore the observed differences of these charac-
teristics between the different diet groups may be important.
Although the associations of vegetarian diets with the other
physiologic characteristics of interest have not been well studied,
these characteristics are also important for long-term health. For
example, BMD is a known predictor of fracture risk (8, 39, 40),
and therefore lower BMD in some non-meat eaters may result in
a higher fracture risk in these diet groups. Similarly, grip strength
has been indicated to be a strong predictor of better health in re-
lation to mortality, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and fracture
risk (9, 10, 41, 42). In our study, differences in height, lean mass,
and physical activity may have contributed to the differences in
grip strength between diet groups, because the magnitudes of the
differences were attenuated to some degree upon adjustment of
these factors in both the white men and the British Indian pop-
ulation, and because vegans in the white population had a lower
overall grip strength but a similar grip strength per kilogram of
lean mass.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is that it included a large sample
size of close to 500,000 white and 5000 British Indian partic-
ipants in the United Kingdom and reported on a range of an-
thropometric indexes and physiologic characteristics that were
objectively measured following standard protocols, thereby mini-
mizing the chance of reporting bias. In the white population, cat-
egorization of diet was performed in 6 groups, which allowed
detailed analyses of characteristics in persons across a range of
dietary habits. Despite the large overall sample size, the numbers
of white vegans and British Indian vegetarians were relatively
small, and therefore the possibility of false-negative findings can-
not be ruled out. Because diet group categorization was based
on data collected at 1 time point, and did not take into account
the length of time the participants have been in any particular
diet group, misclassification bias is possible, although reported
long-term abstinence from meat in this cohort was high (92%
of non-meat eaters overall with >5 y self-reported adherence to
not eating meat). Measurement error related to the outcomes was
also possible, and little is known of the validity of bioimpedance
measures of extremely underweight (BMI <14) or obese (BMI
≥36) participants (5% of total cohort) (43). As with all observa-
tional studies, some degree of self-selection bias may be present
(13), and there was no information to indicate whether vegetari-
ans might be more likely to respond. Because the analyses were
based on diets of participants in one country, the results may not
be generalizable to other populations or cultures, as indicated by
differences between white British and British Indian vegetarians
in our study. Because the study is cross-sectional, it was not pos-
sible to determine causality, and residual confounding by other
dietary or nondietary factors may be present.
Conclusions
In this large-population cohort in the United Kingdom, white
women and men who were poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetari-
ans, or vegans generally had lower adiposity, BMD, grip strength,
blood pressure, and pulse rate than did white women and men
who were regular meat eaters. However, there were fewer differ-
ences in anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in British
Indian meat eaters and vegetarians, perhaps due to the greater
similarities between the 2 diets in this population. Because the
characteristics included in this study are known risk factors of
long-term disease risk, the observed differences in these charac-
teristics between diet groups may be important in determining
long-term health in individuals of different dietary habits.
