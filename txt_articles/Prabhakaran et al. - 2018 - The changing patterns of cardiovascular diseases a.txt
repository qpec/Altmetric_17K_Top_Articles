The changing patterns of cardiovascular diseases and their 
risk factors in the states of India: the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 1990–2016
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative CVD Collaborators* 
Summary
Background The burden of cardiovascular diseases is increasing in India, but a systematic understanding of its 
distribution and time trends across all the states is not readily available. In this report, we present a detailed analysis 
of how the patterns of cardiovascular diseases and major risk factors have changed across the states of India between 
1990 and 2016.
Methods We analysed the prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to cardiovascular diseases and 
the major component causes in the states of India from 1990 to 2016, using all accessible data sources as part of the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016. We placed states into four groups based on 
epidemiological transition level (ETL), defined using the ratio of DALYs from communicable diseases to those from 
non-communicable diseases and injuries combined, with a low ratio denoting high ETL and vice versa. We assessed 
heterogeneity in the burden of major cardiovascular diseases across the states of India, and the contribution of risk 
factors to cardiovascular diseases. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
Findings Overall, cardiovascular diseases contributed 28·1% (95% UI 26·5–29·1) of the total deaths and 14·1% 
(12·9–15·3) of the total DALYs in India in 2016, compared with 15·2% (13·7–16·2) and 6·9% (6·3–7·4), respectively, 
in 1990. In 2016, there was a nine times difference between states in the DALY rate for ischaemic heart disease, a 
six times difference for stroke, and a four times difference for rheumatic heart disease. 23·8 million (95% UI 
22·6–25·0) prevalent cases of ischaemic heart disease were estimated in India in 2016, and 6·5 million (6·3–6·8) 
prevalent cases of stroke, a 2·3 times increase in both disorders from 1990. The age-standardised prevalence of 
both ischaemic heart disease and stroke increased in all ETL state groups between 1990 and 2016, whereas that of 
rheumatic heart disease decreased; the increase for ischaemic heart disease was highest in the low ETL state group. 
53·4% (95% UI 52·6–54·6) of crude deaths due to cardiovascular diseases in India in 2016 were among people 
younger than 70 years, with a higher proportion in the low ETL state group. The leading overlapping risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases in 2016 included dietary risks (56·4% [95% CI 48·5–63·9] of cardiovascular disease DALYs), 
high systolic blood pressure (54·6% [49·0–59·8]), air pollution (31·1% [29·0–33·4]), high total cholesterol (29·4% 
[24·3–34·8]), tobacco use (18·9% [16·6–21·3]), high fasting plasma glucose (16·7% [11·4–23·5]), and high body-
mass index (14·7% [8·3–22·0]). The prevalence of high systolic blood pressure, high total cholesterol, and high 
fasting plasma glucose increased generally across all ETL state groups from 1990 to 2016, but this increase was 
variable across the states; the prevalence of smoking decreased during this period in all ETL state groups.
Interpretation The burden from the leading cardiovascular diseases in India—ischaemic heart disease and stroke—
varies widely between the states. Their increasing prevalence and that of several major risk factors in every part of 
India, especially the highest increase in the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in the less developed low ETL states, 
indicates the need for urgent policy and health system response appropriate for the situation in each state.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of disease 
burden and deaths globally.1–3 The UN, alarmed by 
the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) and high disease severity and case-fatality in 
low-income and middle-income countries compared 
with high-income countries, acknowledged in 2012 that 
the rising burden of NCDs was one of the major threats 
to sustainable development in the 21st century.4–9 
WHO subsequently developed targets for prevention 
and control of NCDs in 2013, which included 
25% relative reduction in overall mortality from 
cardiovascular diseases, 25% relative reduction in 
prevalence of high blood pressure, halting the rise in

diabetes and obesity, and ensuring that at least 50% of 
patients with cardio 
vascular diseases have access to 
relevant drugs and medical counselling by 2025.10,11 The 
Sustainable Development Goals also include a target 
to reduce premature deaths due to NCDs to a third of 
total premature deaths by 2030, emphasising the need 
for multisectoral national policies to facilitate the 
prevention and control of burden from NCDs.12,13 Since 
cardiovascular diseases make up a large part of NCDs, 
the National Health Policy 2017 of India aims to 
reduce 25% of premature deaths from cardiovascular 
diseases besides screening and treatment of 80% of 
hypertensive patients by 2025.14
In a country of 1·3 billion people with cultural and 
lifestyle diversities, several previous attempts have been 
made to compile the burden of cardiovascular diseases 
in different parts of India.15–20 However, there is no 
comprehensive analysis available that allows comparison 
of the trends in cardiovascular diseases and their risk 
factors across the states of India over time in a single 
framework. In the federal framework of Indian admini-
stration, health is mostly a state subject, with approxi-
mately two-thirds of health-care funding from the state 
exchequer.21,22 The India State-Level Disease Burden 
Initiative has reported a varied epidemiological transition 
among the states of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of the 
Global 
Burden 
of 
Diseases, 
Injuries, 
and 
Risk 
Factors 
(GBD) 
Study 2016.23,24 Here, we report time trends and 
heterogeneity among states for cardiovascular diseases 
from 1990 to 2016, and for the major risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases.
Methods
Overview
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative has 
reported overall trends in diseases, injuries, and risk 
factors from 1990 to 2016 for every state of India.23,24 This 
analysis was done as part of GBD 2016, which estimated 
disease burden due to 333 diseases and injuries and 
84 risk factors using all available data sources that could 
be accessed and that met inclusion criteria. Disease 
grouping and risk grouping in GBD 2016 were organised 
into three broad categories and four levels, respectively. 
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative benefited 
from the efforts of several expert groups and a large 
network of collaborators in India to identify all available 
data sources that could be accessed, to assess their scope 
and quality for inclusion, and to participate in the analysis 
and interpretation of findings. The Health Ministry 
Screening Committee at the Indian Council of Medical 
Research and the ethics committee of the Public Health 
Foundation of India approved the work of this initiative. A 
detailed description of metrics and analytical approaches 
used in GBD 2016 has been reported elsewhere.1–3,25,26 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and publicly available reports on 
March 29, 2018, without language or publication date 
restrictions, for estimates of the burden of cardiovascular 
diseases across the states of India, using the terms “burden”, 
“cardiovascular diseases”, “cause of death”, “cerebrovascular 
disorders”, “coronary heart disease”, “CVD”, “DALY”, “death”, 
“epidemiology”, “India”, “ischaemic heart disease’’, “morbidity”, 
“mortality”, “prevalence”, “rheumatic heart disease”, “stroke”, 
and “trends”. Previous studies have noted the increasing 
burden of cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors over 
time in India, and attempts have been made to assess the 
variations of cardiovascular disease burden and their major risk 
factors for a number of states. However, we did not find any 
comprehensive report on the trends of prevalence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from different 
cardiovascular diseases in every state of India over a long 
period, which is needed to inform effective policy making for 
the heterogeneous 1·3 billion population of India.
Added value of this study
This study provides comprehensive estimates of the burden 
due to cardiovascular diseases in every state of India 
from 1990 to 2016, based on all accessible data and using the 
standardised Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study methodology. These findings highlight that the 
prevalent cases of ischaemic heart disease and stroke have 
more than doubled in India from 1990 to 2016, with an 
increase in prevalence in every state of the country. Although 
the DALY rate due to ischaemic heart disease is currently higher 
in the more developed states of India, this study shows that 
the increase in age-standardised DALY rates from 1990 was 
higher in less developed states. It also reports that more than 
half of cardiovascular disease deaths in India in 2016 were in 
people younger than 70 years, with this proportion being 
higher in the relatively less developed states. The findings 
emphasise that, although the prevalence of cardiovascular 
disease risk factors varied considerably across the states of 
India, the prevalence of high systolic blood pressure, high total 
cholesterol, and high fasting plasma glucose increased across 
all state groups since 1990.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our systematic assessment of cardiovascular diseases in all 
states of India from 1990 to 2016 indicates an urgent need for 
controlling the increasing prevalence of ischaemic heart 
disease and stroke, and the adverse effect of these disorders, in 
all parts of the country, with particular attention to the less 
developed states of India where the increase in prevalence of 
ischaemic heart disease has been the highest. Further planning 
to control cardiovascular diseases in India could benefit from 
using these comprehensive state-specific trends as reference.

Here, we report findings on cardiovascular diseases and 
the major component causes, and main risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases, across the states of India from 
1990 to 2016. GBD 2016 methods relevant to this Article 
are described in the appendix (pp 3–41), with the key 
points summarised here.
Estimation of prevalence and years lived with disability
We estimated the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases 
and the major component causes by location, age, sex, 
and year using DisMod-MR, version 2.1, a disease 
modelling computational program that is the standard 
GBD modelling approach for non-fatal health outcomes.3 
This approach entailed identification of all available data 
sources that could be accessed and their assessment for 
data extraction based on inclusion criteria, estimation of 
cause-specific prevalence using DisMod-MR modelling, 
ascertainment of severity distributions of sequelae, 
incorporation of disability weights to quantify severity, 
comorbidity adjustment of sequelae, and calculation of 
years lived with disability (YLDs) from prevalence and 
disability weights for each location, age, sex, and year.3
The major data inputs for prevalence estimation of 
cardiovascular diseases and the major component causes 
in India included population-representative surveys 
and cohort studies, disease registries, hospital-based 
data, and a wide array of published and unpublished 
studies (appendix pp 42–56). We estimated the prevalence 
of ischaemic heart disease and its sequelae from a 
combi 
nation of cause-specific death rates, prevalence, 
incidence, standardised mortality ratios, excess mortality 
rates, and relative risks.3,27 We estimated stroke prevalence 
from incidence and excess mortality data for the first-
ever acute stroke models, and survivor incidence, excess 
mortality, and prevalence data for the chronic stroke 
model.3,28 Data inputs for prevalence and cause-specific 
mortality rates of rheumatic heart disease from an 
endemic and non-endemic location model were used to 
produce prevalence estimates of rheumatic heart disease 
by location, age, sex, and year.3,29
Estimation of deaths, years of life lost, and 
disability-adjusted life-years
Among the all-cause mortality rates, we estimated 
mortality from cardiovascular diseases and each of the 
major component causes with the GBD Cause of Death 
Ensemble modelling approach, which uses all available 
data sources that could be accessed along with covariates 
to develop a series of plausible models and, eventually, the 
best ensemble predictive model to produce estimates of 
deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature 
mortality by location, age, sex, and year.1,2,27 We calculated 
YLLs from age at death and GBD normative standard life 
expectancy at each age. We computed disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), a summary measure of total health 
loss, by adding YLLs and YLDs for each cardiovascular 
disease subcause, age, and sex grouping by location. The 
main data inputs for estimation of mortality from 
cardiovascular diseases and the major component causes 
in India included Sample Registration System cause of 
death data, Medical Certification of Cause of Death data, 
and other verbal autopsy studies (appendix pp 42–56).
Estimation of risk factor exposure and attributable 
disease burden
We used the GBD comparative risk assessment 
framework to estimate cardiovascular disease-related risk 
factor exposure and attributable disease burden, as 
explained elsewhere.26 We collated exposure data for risk 
factors with a categorical or continuous distribution from 
all available data sources that could be accessed, including 
survey and other data, adjusted using age–sex splitting, 
and strengthened with incorporation of covariates for 
modelling. The modelling approaches integrated multiple 
data inputs and borrowed information across age, time, 
and location to produce the best possible estimates of risk 
exposure by location, age, sex, and year. For each risk 
factor, the theoretical minimum risk exposure level was 
established as the lowest level of risk exposure below 
which its relation with a disease outcome is not supported 
by the available evidence. We used estimates of mean risk 
factor exposure, strengthened by covariates, to calculate 
summary exposure values for each risk—a metric ranging 
from 0% to 100%—to describe the risk-weighted exposure 
for a population or risk-weighted prevalence of exposure.
The estimation of attributable disease burden included 
ascertainment of the relative risk of disease outcomes 
for risk exposure–disease outcome pairs with sufficient 
evidence of a causal relation in randomised control 
trials, prospective cohorts, or case-control studies, as 
assessed using an approach similar to the World Cancer 
Research Fund grading system. We estimated population 
attributable fractions for diseases caused by each risk 
factor.26 Estimates of deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs 
attributable to each risk factor were produced by location, 
age, sex, and year. A detailed description of exposure and 
attributable disease burden estimation for the major risk 
factors associated with cardiovascular diseases, including 
GBD exposure definitions and statistical modelling, is in 
the appendix (pp 3–41) and published elsewhere.26
The major data inputs for the risk factors of cardio_
vascular diseases in India included dietary and nutrition 
surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau; 
national household surveys such as the National Family 
Health Survey, District Level Household Survey, and 
Annual Health Survey; air pollution monitoring and 
satellite data; youth and adult tobacco surveys; household 
consumer expenditure surveys of the National Sample 
Survey Organisation; and various other population-based 
surveys (appendix pp 42–56).
GBD uses covariates—explanatory variables that have a 
known association with the outcome of interest—to 
arrive at the best possible estimate of the outcome of 
interest when data for the outcome are scarce but data

for covariates are available.1–3,25,26 This approach was part 
of the estimation process for the findings presented 
in this Article.
Analysis presented in this paper
We report findings for 31 geographical units in India, 
comprising 29 states, the Union Territory of Delhi, and 
union territories other than Delhi (combining the 
six smaller union territories of Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman 
and Diu, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry). The states of 
Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand were created 
from existing larger states in 2000, and the state of 
Telangana was created in 2014. For trends from 1990 
onward, we disaggregated data for these four new states 
from their parent states, based on data from the districts 
that now constitute these states. We also presented 
findings based on epidemiological transition level (ETL), 
as described previously.23 Briefly, we defined ETL state 
groups based on the ratio of DALYs from communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases to those 
from non-communicable diseases and injuries combined 
in 2016, with a relatively lower ratio indicating higher ETL: 
low ETL (ratio 0·56–0·75), lower-middle ETL (0·41–0·55), 
higher-middle ETL (0·31–0·40), and high ETL (<0·31). We 
have reported previously that epidemiological transition 
ratios of the states of India have a significant inverse 
relation with the Socio-demographic Index calculated by 
GBD 2016 based on income, education, and fertility levels, 
which indicates broad correspondence of ETL state groups 
with sociodemographic development levels.23
We present differences in the prevalence of, and deaths 
and DALYs due to cardiovascular diseases and the major 
component causes, ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 
in addition to rheumatic heart disease—a subcause that 
is particularly of interest in India—from 1990 to 2016. 
We report estimates of ischaemic heart disease and 
stroke DALYs attributable to major risk factors in 2016. 
Risk factors included dietary risks, high systolic blood 
pressure, high total blood cholesterol, tobacco use, high 
fasting plasma glucose, high body-mass index (BMI), 
and air pollution. Dietary risks consist of ten components 
that are protective (eg, intake of fruits, nuts and seeds, 
vegetables, and wholegrains) and five components that 
are harmful (eg, intake of sodium, trans-fatty acids, and 
red meat; appendix pp 33–36). We present changes in the 
prevalence of high systolic blood pressure (≥140 mm Hg) 
in adults aged 30 years or older, high total blood 
cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL [≥11·1 mmol/L]) in adults 
aged 30 years or older, high fasting plasma glucose 
(≥126 mg/dL [≥7·0 mmol/L]) in adults aged 20 years or 
older, and smoking (current use of any smoked tobacco 
product) in people aged 10 years or older for India and 
the four ETL state groups, between 1990 and 2016. We 
compared age-standardised DALY rates for cardiovascular 
diseases and the major component causes in 2016 in 
India with the global average.30
We present both crude and age-standardised estimates, 
as relevant. Crude estimates provide the actual situation in 
each state, which is useful for policy makers, and age-
standardised estimates allow comparisons over time 
and between states after adjusting for differences in the 
age structure of the population. Age-standardised rates 
were based on the GBD global reference popu 
lation.1 We 
report estimates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) 
when relevant. UIs were based on 1000 runs of the models 
for each quantity of interest, with the mean regarded as 
the point estimate and the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles 
considered the 95% UI (appendix p 41).1–3,25,26

Results
Cardiovascular diseases contributed to 28·1% (95% UI 
26·5–29·1) of total deaths and 14·1% (12·9–15·3) of total 
DALYs in India in 2016 (table 1)—compared with 15·2% 
(13·7–16·2) and 6·9% (6·3–7·4), respectively, in 1990.31 
Ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the predom-
inant cardiovascular diseases, contributing to 61·4% 
and 24·9% of total DALYs from cardiovascular diseases, 
respectively, in 2016. Ischaemic heart disease was the 
leading cause of DALYs in India in 2016, and stroke 
the fifth leading cause.23,24 Ischaemic heart disease 
contributed 17·8% (95% UI 16·8–18·5) of total deaths 
and 8·7% (7·9–9·5) of total DALYs, and stroke 
contributed 7·1% (6·6–7·5) of total deaths and 3·5% 
(3·2–3·9) of total DALYs (table 1). The proportion of 
deaths and DALYs from ischaemic heart disease was 
significantly higher in men than in women, but were 
similar in the two sexes for stroke (table 1).
Prevalent cases of cardiovascular diseases increased in 
India from 25·7 million (95% UI 25·1–26·0) in 1990 
to 54·5 million (53·7–55·3) in 2016. The prevalence of 
cardiovascular diseases in 2016 was highest in Kerala,

Punjab, and Tamil Nadu (which are in the high ETL state 
group), followed by Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, 
Maharashtra, Goa, and West Bengal (which are in the 
high and higher-middle ETL state groups; figure 1).
The number of cases of ischaemic heart disease 
increased from 10·2 million (95% UI 9·8–10·6) in 1990 
to 23·8 million (22·6–25·0) in 2016, and cases of stroke 
from 2·8 million (95% UI 2·7–2·9) in 1990 to 6·5 million 
(6·3–6·8) in 2016.31 The crude prevalence of ischaemic 
heart disease and stroke increased sub 
stantially across 
all ETL state groups and all states from 1990 to 2016, and 
the age-standardised prevalence increased modestly 
(appendix pp 58, 59). The age-standardised prevalence of 
rheumatic heart disease decreased in India by 10·8% 
(95% UI 8·7–13·0) from 1990 to 2016; this prevalence 
decreased across all ETL state groups (appendix p 58).
The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in 2016 had 
an increasing gradient from the low to the high ETL state 
groups, with the highest prevalence in Kerala, Punjab, 
Tamil Nadu (high ETL state group), and Maharashtra 
(higher-middle ETL state group; figure 1). The prevalence 
of stroke in 2016 did not have a clear gradient across the 
ETL state groups, with the highest prevalence in West 
Bengal (higher-middle ETL state group) and in Kerala 
and Goa (high ETL state group). The prevalence of 
rheumatic heart disease in 2016 was similar across the 
ETL state groups, with the highest prevalence in several 
states spread across the country (figure 1).
Deaths due to cardiovascular diseases in India 
increased from 1·3 million (95% UI 1·2–1·4) in 1990 
to 2·8 million (2·6–2·9) in 2016. The crude death rate 
of cardiovascular diseases increased by 34·3% (95% UI 
26·6–43·7) from 1990 to 2016 in India, but the age-
standardised rate did not change significantly during 
this period (appendix p 57). The crude death rate 
from cardiovascular diseases increased in both sexes 
from 1990 to 2016 in all ETL state groups, and the age-
standardised rate increased in men in the low ETL state 
group (appendix p 57). The death rate from cardiovascular 
diseases in India in 2016 was higher among adults aged 
70 years or older than in those younger than 70 years 
(2777 per 100 000 [95% UI 2550–2922] vs 116 per 100 000 
[110–120]), but the proportion of total deaths from 
cardiovascular diseases was higher among people 
younger than 70 years than in those aged 70 years or 
older (53·4% [95% UI 52·6–54·6] vs 46·6 [45·4–47·4]; 
table 2). The proportion of deaths from cardiovascular 
diseases in people younger than 70 years was highest in 
the low ETL state group (table 2).
The DALY rate of ischaemic heart disease varied 
8·7 times between the states 2016 (figure 2). This rate 
was highest in the states Punjab and Tamil Nadu, which 
are in the high ETL state group, followed by Haryana, 
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka (higher-middle ETL), and

Gujarat (lower-middle ETL). The DALY rate of stroke 
varied 6·2 times between the states in 2016, and was 
highest in the higher-middle ETL state group (figure 2). 
The states with the highest rate of stroke DALYs were 
West Bengal and Odisha in the east, Tripura and Assam 
in the northeast, and Chhattisgarh in central India. The 
DALY rate of rheumatic heart disease varied 4·2 times 
between the states in 2016, and was highest in Bihar and 
Odisha, which are in the low ETL state group, and was 
lowest in the high ETL state group.
The crude DALY rate of ischaemic heart disease 
increased by 33·8% (95% UI 24·7–43·6) from 1990 
to 2016 in India, compared with a 53·0% (50·2–55·4) 
increase in prevalence (figure 3). The age-standardised 
DALY rate due to ischaemic heart disease did not 
change significantly during this period (2·1%, 95% UI 
–4·8 to 9·7), but prevalence increased by 9·4% 
(7·3 to 11·2). The age-standardised DALY rate of 
ischaemic heart disease increased significantly by 15·4% 
(95% UI 5·9–26·4) in the low ETL state group, and age-
standardised prevalence also increased significantly 
by 14·1% (11·9–16·2). However, the age-standardised 
DALY rate due to ischaemic heart disease decreased in 
the high ETL state group (9·8%, 95% UI –19·1 to 0·6), 
but the prevalence increased (6·2%, 3·9 to 8·4). The 
crude DALY rate due to stroke did not change from 1990 
to 2016 in India (figure 3), but the age-standardised 
rate decreased by 25·8% (95% UI 18·8–32·0), with 
the highest decline in the high ETL state group (44·5%, 
95% UI 37·3–51·1). This change contrasts with the 
increase in age-standardised prevalence of stroke in all 
ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate of 
rheumatic heart disease decreased in all ETL state 
groups from 1990 to 2016; this percentage change was 
more than the decrease in age-standardised prevalence 
of rheumatic heart disease during this period (figure 3).
The age-standardised DALY rate due to cardiovascular 
diseases in India in 2016 was 1·3 times the global 
average, that of ischaemic heart disease was 1·6 times 
the global average, rheumatic heart disease was 2·4 times 
the global average, and the age-standardised DALY rate 
due to stroke were comparable to the global average.30 
With 17·8% of the global population in 2016, India 
had 23·1%, 14·0%, and 37·6% of global DALYs due to 
ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and rheumatic heart 
disease, respectively.
Among the risk factors that contributed to DALYs due 
to cardiovascular diseases in India in 2016, the leading 
ones were dietary risks (56·4%, 95% UI 48·5–63·9), high 
systolic blood pressure (54·6%, 49·0–59·8), air pollution

(31·1%, 29·0–33·4), high total cholesterol (29·4%, 
24·3–34·8), tobacco use (18·9, 16·6–21·3), high fasting 
plasma glucose (16·7%, 11·4–23·5), and high BMI 
(14·7%, 8·3–22·0), for both sexes combined (appendix 
p 60). Of the cardiovascular disease DALYs attributable to 
tobacco use, most were due to smoking (83·4%). It is 
important to note that the cumulative effect of these 
risk factors is less than the simple addition of their 
individual contribution, because the risk factors overlap. 
Furthermore, population attributable fractions from 
components can add up to more than their sum, even if 
they are independent. Leading risk factors for DALYs 
attributable to ischaemic heart disease were dietary risks, 
high systolic blood pressure, high total cholesterol, and 
air pollution; for stroke DALYs, risk factors were high 
systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, and air pollution 
(figure 4). The proportion of ischaemic heart disease 
DALYs attributable to high total cholesterol was much 
greater than for stroke. The proportional contribution of 
tobacco use to ischaemic heart disease and stroke DALYs 
was larger in men than in women.
The crude prevalence of high systolic blood pressure, 
high total cholesterol, and high fasting plasma glucose 
generally increased in India and across all ETL state 
groups from 1990 to 2016, but the prevalence of smoking 
decreased (table 3). The prevalence of high systolic blood 
pressure, high total cholesterol, and high fasting plasma 
glucose in 2016 was highest in the high ETL state group. 
Among the states of India, the prevalence of high systolic 
blood pressure was highest in Punjab, Himachal 
Pradesh, Kerala, and Goa in the high ETL state group 
and in Sikkim and Nagaland in the lower-middle ETL 
state group, with two times variation across the states 
(figure 5). The prevalence of high total cholesterol was 
highest in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in 
the high ETL state group, and Haryana and Delhi in the 
higher-middle ETL state group, with 6·5 times variation 
across the states. The age-standardised prevalence of 
high fasting plasma glucose increased in all ETL state 
groups from 1990, but the increase was highest in low 
and lower-middle ETL state groups (table 3). The 
prevalence of high BMI increased in every state of India 
from 1990 to 2016, as described by us in a companion 
paper in The Lancet Global Health.32 The exposure to 
ambient air pollution also increased in India to varying 
degrees in the different states from 1990 to 2016.23,24,31
Discussion
The findings in this report provide a systematic under-
standing of the burden due to cardio 
vascular diseases 
and their risk factors in every state of India from 1990 
to 2016, using all available data sources that could be 
accessed. The contribution of cardiovascular diseases to 
total deaths and disease burden in India has almost 
doubled since 1990. Ischaemic heart disease was the 
leading individual cause of disease burden in India 
in 2016, and stroke was the fifth leading cause.23,24
The crude prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and 
stroke has increased in every state of India since 1990, 
and the age-standardised prevalence has increased in 
most of the states. Although the highest prevalence 
of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in 2016 was in 
the high ETL state groups, the increase in the age-
standardised prevalence of ischaemic heart disease 
since 1990 was higher in the low and lower-middle ETL 
state groups, which include many less developed states 
that are home to 55% of India’s population. More than 
half of the total cardiovascular disease deaths in India 
in 2016 were in people younger than 70 years. This 
proportion was highest in the low ETL state group, 
which is a major cause for concern with respect to the 
challenges posed to the health systems in these 
relatively less developed states. Reducing premature 
deaths from cardiovascular diseases in the economically 
productive age groups requires urgent action across all 
states of India.
The burden of cardiovascular diseases in 2016 varied 
strikingly between the states of India, with a nine times 
variation in the DALY rate of ischaemic heart disease, a 
six times variation in the DALY rate due to stroke, and a 
four times variation in the DALY rate due to rheumatic 
heart disease. The increase in crude prevalence and age-
standardised prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and 
stroke across all ETL state groups since 1990 can be 
attributed to the ageing of the population and the 
increasing effect of risk factors. The age-standardised 
prevalence of ischaemic heart disease increased in all 
ETL state groups, with the highest increase in the less 
developed low ETL state group, while age-standardised

improving health care in general, the increase in the 
DALY rate of ischaemic heart disease and the relatively 
lower improvements in rates of DALYs due to stroke in 
resource-poor low ETL states indicate larger gaps in the 
prevention and care of cardiovascular diseases in these 
states.19,33,34 The age-standardised prevalence of rheumatic 
heart disease decreased from 1990 to 2016 in all ETL state 
groups, and the age-standardised DALY rate due to 
rheumatic heart disease declined even more than the 
decrease in prevalence. The DALY rate of rheumatic 
heart disease in 2016 was highest in the relatively less 
developed low ETL state group. Variations in cardio-
vascular disease burden seen between states reflects the 
different stages of epidemiological transition of cardio-
vascular diseases. In 2016, the DALY rates of ischaemic 
heart disease were generally higher in the more advanced 
high ETL state group, the DALY rate of stroke had a 
mixed pattern across the ETL state groups, and the DALY 
rates of rheumatic heart disease were higher in the low 
ETL state group. The variable relation of these diseases 
with socioeconomic development has been noted 
previously.7,20,35,36
The National Programme for Prevention and Control 
of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke 
(NPCDCS), which was launched in 2010, aims to prevent 
and control disease burden through early screening, 
behavioural change, and capacity building for human 
resources and infrastructure.37 Although the NPCDCS 
has established NCD units in all states and union 
territories as of March, 2017, implemen 
tation of these 
and other efforts across the states of India needs more 
time to show progress towards achieving national and 
global targets for NCDs, including cardiovascular 
diseases and its risk factors. 
The Indian Government announced in early 2018 
Ayushman Bharat, the National Health Protection 
Mission.38 A major component of this programme is a 
health insurance scheme that aims to cover 500 million 
people from poor and vulnerable families in India.38 
Since the increasing burden of NCDs places further 
economic pressure on individuals and households,39 
Ayushman Bharat has the potential to reduce the 
financial burden from NCDs in India. Ayushman Bharat 
includes the establishment of 150 000 Health and 
Wellness Centres across India to provide comprehensive 
primary health-care services that are commensurate 
with the leading causes of disease burden, including 
from cardiovascular diseases and other NCDs.40 Each 
Indian state will need to contextualise prevention and 
management strategies for cardiovascular diseases 
according to the magnitude of its burden and trends. 
Such efforts can be informed by the findings for each 
state of India presented in this Article.
The prevalence of most major risk factors that contribute 
to cardiovascular disease burden—including high systolic 
blood pressure, ambient air pollution, high total 
cholesterol, high fasting plasma glucose, and high BMI—
has increased across India since 1990, although the current 
prevalence varies greatly between ETL state groups and 
individual states. In some studies,18,41 a higher prevalence 
of hypertension in India has been reported, compared with 
our estimates, which could be due to inclusion of diastolic 
blood pressure in the case-definition, or other study design 
differences. Under 
diagnosis of high systolic blood 
pressure and high total cholesterol, and inadequate access 
to medications for these disorders, is common in India, 
which contributes to their increasing prevalence.42,43

total cholesterol, high fasting plasma glucose, and high 
BMI—are related to dietary consumption. Efforts have 
been ongoing to address some of the dietary risks related 
to consumption of sodium, trans fatty acids, and sugar-
sweetened beverages. The proposed fat tax and 
advertisement ban on foods high in fat, sugar, and salt by 
the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India in 2017 
would be a step towards reducing some of these risks that 
contribute to the burden of cardio 
vascular diseases.44 
Smoking was the only major cardiovascular disease risk 
factor that decreased in prevalence from 1990, suggesting 
that implementation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco 
Products Act in 2003 to discourage use of tobacco products, 
and the National Tobacco Control Programme launched 
in 2007, may be facilitating a reduction in tobacco use, but 
sustained efforts are needed for further progress.45,46 
Ongoing initiatives to tackle the burden of air pollution in 
India, which is a major contributor to ischaemic heart 
disease and stroke, and the challenges in controlling this 
risk factor have been noted in earlier publications by the 
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative.23,24 The 
increasing prevalence of various lifestyle risk factors 
and environmental risks contributing to cardiovascular 
diseases across India is ominous, and this situation has to 
be addressed through systematic policies and action in 
various sectors.5,47
General limitations of the GBD 2016 methodology, and 
those for estimation of cardiovascular diseases and 
related risk factors, are described elsewhere.1–3,25–27,29,42 A 
specific limitation for India is an incomplete medically 
certified cause of death system, which currently covers 
only a small proportion of deaths in India. Verbal autopsy 
cause of death data from the Sample Registration System 
were a useful alternative for the findings presented in 
this report.23 However, India needs to improve the 
coverage and quality of its cause of death assignment 
system. Population-based data for morbidity due to 
cardiovascular diseases and their sequelae are generally 
not available for many parts of India, although several 
ongoing studies are attempting to address this gap. A 
particular challenge is scarce data to distinguish between 
the distribution of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke 
at the population level. Because we report the prevalence 
of high systolic blood pressure, and not diastolic blood 
pressure, this prevalence would be lower than that 
for hypertension defined using both systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure levels. Data for some risk factors 
(eg, dietary risks) in urban populations across the states 
of India that had been sparse previously have recently 
become available, which would strengthen the estimates 
further. Additional population-level data for the burden 
of cardiovascular diseases attributable to risk factors in 
different parts of India would also make the estimates 
more robust. Adequate population-level disease registries 
and surveillance systems to monitor morbidity trends of 
the major cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors 
are needed in India.
The strengths of our study include the use of all 
available data sources in India that could be accessed to 
estimate trends in the burden of cardiovascular diseases 
and their risk factors in every state of India over a 
period of 26 years. Nationwide health surveys over the 
past few years in India have provided useful data for 
many cardiovascular disease risk factors in all states of 
India. When data are scarce for a particular variable, 
GBD uses covariates and other techniques that borrow 
strength over space and time to arrive at the best 
possible estimates. Other strengths include use of the 
standardised GBD methodology for comparison across 
locations and years, and a comprehensive effort that 
benefited from the inputs of a network of leading 
experts in India.
This Article documents cardiovascular disease trends 
in each state of India over a quarter of a century, 
highlighting that cardiovascular diseases are the largest 
contributor to disease burden of any disease group and 
are a major public health problem leading to premature 
deaths and morbidity across all states of India. The 
increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases and its risk 
factors needs to be addressed urgently. Although there 
have been impressive advances in the capacity for 
preventing and treating cardiovascular disease globally, 
these need much enhancement across all of India, with 
particular attention to the relatively less developed states 
where the rate of increase in the cardiovascular disease 
burden is among the highest in the country. The state-
specific findings in this report can serve as a useful 
reference for informing policies and programmes to 
plan more effectively the prevention and treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases in each state of India, which will 
facilitate progress towards achieving national and  global 
targets for cardiovascular disease reduction.
