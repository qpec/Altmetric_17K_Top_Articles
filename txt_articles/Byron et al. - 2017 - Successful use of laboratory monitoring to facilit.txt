Purpose. A case in which novel and traditional laboratory markers were 
successfully used to determine surgical intervention timing in an elderly 
patient receiving dabigatran for atrial fibrillation is reported. 
Summary. An 86-year-old woman who was taking dabigatran for atrial 
fibrillation suffered a right femoral neck fracture requiring surgical inter-
vention. Dabigatran was withheld once the patient was admitted to the 
hospital, and the pharmacy inpatient anticoagulation management team 
was consulted for guidance on determining appropriate scheduling of sur-
gical intervention with regard to the time since her most recent dabigatran 
dose to minimize bleeding complications. The team recommended delay-
ing surgery, as dabigatran clearance would likely take 3–5 days and an 
ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA) dabigatran value of <50 ng/mL would 
be desirable before surgical intervention. During her hospitalization, novel 
and traditional laboratory markers for dabigatran, such as ECA value, ac-
tivated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time, 
were measured and followed closely to determine the best time to perform 
surgical intervention to minimize bleeding risk. Renal dysfunction likely de-
layed dabigatran elimination in the patient and may have led to potential 
accumulation of dabigatran. The patient ultimately had to wait 5 days after 
the last dabigatran dose for surgical intervention. 
Conclusion. Coagulation assay monitoring for dabigatran, with emphasis 
on an ECA dabigatran concentration of <50 ng/mL, was used to assess 
safety regarding bleeding risk before a nonemergent surgical procedure in 
an 86-year-old woman with a right femoral neck fracture.

abigatran etexilate was the first di-
rect oral anticoagulant to receive 
Food and Drug Administration mar-
ket approval in 2010 for prevention 
of stroke and systemic embolism in 
patients with nonvalvular atrial fib-
rillation.1 Its approval was followed 
by market approval of additional di-
rect oral anticoagulants: rivaroxaban, 
apixaban, and edoxaban. Despite the 
expanding use of these agents, before 
the approval of idarucizumab in 2015, 
no agent has been available to reverse 
bleeding or facilitate invasive proce-
dures associated with these agents.2 
Further, many clinicians struggle with 
how novel and traditional laboratory 
testing can be used to guide appropri-
ate therapy or facilitate interventions.
The dabigatran package insert rec-
ommends therapy discontinuation 
1–2 days before surgical procedures 
for patients with a creatinine clear-
ance (CLcr) of ≥50 mL/min or therapy 
discontinuation 3–5 days before sur-
gery when the CLcr is <50 mL/min.1 
However, little practical evidence is 
available to assist in the interpretation 
of coagulation assays before a surgical 
procedure to assess safety with regard 
to bleeding risk. We report a case in 
which novel and traditional laboratory

markers were successfully used to de-
termine surgical intervention timing 
in an elderly patient receiving dabi-
gatran for atrial fibrillation. 
Case report
An 86-year-old, 99.8-kg woman 
(height, 167.6 cm) arrived at the emer-
gency department (ED) with a right 
femoral neck fracture resulting from 
a fall while getting out of bed. The pa-
tient complained of significant right 
hip pain at presentation and was un-
able to bear weight. She denied having 
any other symptoms.
A radiograph taken on the day of 
her arrival to the ED (day 1) showed an 
impacted femoral neck fracture of the 
right hip. The patient was then admit-
ted for surgical fracture repair. The pa-
tient reported taking her most recent 
dose of dabigatran on the morning of 
ED presentation. 
Her medical history included atrial 
fibrillation, with a calculated CHADS2 
score of 3 and a CHA2DS2VASc score of 
5; hypertension; type 2 diabetes melli-
tus; macular degeneration of her right 
eye; a history of falls; and bilateral 
knee prosthesis replacement 14 years 
prior. Her home medications included 
dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, amlo-
dipine 10 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg in 
the morning and 50 mg in the evening, 
losartan 100 mg daily, citalopram 10 
mg daily, glimepiride 0.5 mg daily, 
tramadol 50 mg every 4–6 hours as 
needed for moderate pain, and chole-
calciferol 2,000 units daily. She also re-
ported taking a multivitamin capsule 
with lutein daily. Her only reported al-
lergy was to penicillin. 
On day 1, the patient’s laboratory 
test results were as follows: serum cre-
atinine (SCr), 1.15 mg/dL; estimated 
CLcr, 33 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault 
calculation; International Normalized 
Ratio (INR), 1.51; prothrombin time 
(PT), 17.8 seconds (normal, 11.8–14.5 
seconds); 
hemoglobin 
concentra-
tion, 14.6 g/dL (normal, 11.5–15.8 g/
dL); hematocrit value, 44.5% (normal, 
35–45%); and platelet count, 231 × 103/
µL (normal, 140–400 × 103/µL). The 
patient’s baseline SCr was unknown, 
KEY POINTS
• An ecarin chromogenic as-
say dabigatran concentration 
of <50 ng/mL, along with 
monitoring of activated partial 
thromboplastin time, throm-
bin time, and prothrombin 
time, allowed for safe surgical 
outcomes in an 86-year-old 
woman with a right femoral 
neck fracture. 
• More information is needed 
regarding how to manage da-
bigatran when it needs to be 
stopped for bleeding or surgi-
cal intervention, particularly 
the impact of the 2-phase dis-
tribution model and renal im-
pairment on laboratory values 
and other patient management 
decisions. 
• A clinician’s knowledge and 
appropriate application of anti-
coagulation assays in practice 
are essential to ensure safe 
patient care. 
and no other laboratory measures of 
anticoagulation were collected. Addi-
tional laboratory data are available in 
Table 1.
Dabigatran was withheld once the 
patient was admitted to the hospital, 
and the pharmacy inpatient antico-
agulation management team was 
consulted for guidance on determin-
ing appropriate scheduling of surgical 
intervention with regard to the time 
since her most recent dabigatran dose 
to minimize bleeding complications. 
The team recommended delaying sur-
gery, as dabigatran clearance would 
likely take 3–5 days and an ecarin 
chromogenic assay (ECA) dabigatran 
value of <50 ng/mL would be desir-
able before surgical intervention. The 
ECA dabigatran level was intended to 
provide a reference point before surgi-
cal intervention to ensure that most of 
the anticoagulant activity of dabigat-
ran had subsided. Since the patient 
had most recently taken her dose of 
dabigatran the morning of ED presen-
tation, it was highly likely that her ECA 
dabigatran level was above 50 ng/mL, 
so it was not measured on the first day. 
On the morning of hospital day 2, 
the patient’s ECA dabigatran value was 
130.91 ng/mL. Hospital day 3 revealed 
an unexpected increase in the ECA da-
bigatran level to 242.31 ng/mL, with 
a SCr of 0.84 mg/dL. The interprofes-
sional team caring for the patient had 
initially planned to take the patient 
to surgery the next day, and this mea-
surement put that plan in doubt. 
On hospital day 4, the ECA dabi-
gatran level increased to 254.68 ng/
mL, and her SCr concentration rose to 
0.97 mg/dL. Secondary to a continued 
increase in ECA dabigatran levels, an 
activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) was obtained to assess ad-
ditional anticoagulation values and 
was recorded as 41.7 seconds (normal, 
23.5–36.5 seconds). Therefore, the 
pharmacy inpatient anticoagulation 
management team recommended a 
further delay of surgery. 
On hospital day 5, the patient’s 
laboratory test results were as follows: 
ECA dabigatran level, 200.4 ng/mL; 
aPTT, 39.1 seconds; thrombin time 
(TT), >120 seconds (normal, 10–21 
seconds); and SCr concentration, 0.95 
mg/dL. On hospital day 6, the patient’s 
ECA dabigatran level and aPTT contin-
ued to decrease (41.08 ng/dL and 31.5 
seconds, respectively), and her TT was 
117.3 seconds. Based on these labora-
tory test values and the passing of 5 
days since the last dose of dabigatran, 
it was determined that it was now safe 
for surgery. The patient had a success-
ful right hip hemiarthroplasty, with an 
estimated blood loss of 150 mL.
Postoperative day 1 allowed for 
drain removal and the initiation of 
enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously ev-
ery 24 hours for deep vein thrombosis 
prophylaxis (roughly 18 hours after 
the end of surgery). The patient’s he-
moglobin level remained stable for the 
rest of the hospitalization.

The patient remained stable in 
the hospital for the next 3 days before 
being discharged to a subacute care 
facility on postoperative day 4. Dabi-
gatran was not restarted during the 
hospitalization or at discharge, with 
the plan to defer long-term antico-
agulation decisions to her managing 
cardiologist.
Discussion
The monitoring of ECA and other 
coagulation laboratory assays in this 
patient helped assess when surgi-
cal intervention could be safely per-
formed in an elderly patient with re-
duced renal function. While routine 
monitoring of dabigatran is not a 
requirement with therapy, the agent 
has an effect on numerous anticoag-
ulation assays such as the aPTT, PT, 
INR, TT, and ECA. These values have 
been shown to coincide with the 
plasma concentration–time curve 
for dabigatran.1,3-8 However, some 
of these measures are more helpful 
than others for use in a situation like 
this one.
ECA is specific for thrombin gen-
eration, since the assay’s activator, 
ecarin, is a compound that activates 
prothrombin to form meizothrom-
bin. Direct thrombin inhibitors can 
inhibit the thrombin-like activity of 
meizothrombin, allowing the ECA 
test to portray a direct measure of 
dabigatran’s activity. ECA is similar 
to ecarin clotting time (ECT) in that 
meizothrombin generation is mea-
sured with a chromogenic substrate 
compared to its impact on the extent 
of ECT prolongation with ECT.9
Studies have shown a close linear 
correlation between ECT prolonga-
tion and plasma concentrations of 
direct thrombin inhibitors, allowing 
for quantification of plasma dabigat-
ran levels.6 ECT is more sensitive than 
aPTT, particularly at low dabigatran 
concentrations, making it a better op-
tion to determine when it is safe to 
perform a surgical procedure. Inter-
estingly, ECT is rarely used in clinical 
practice due to its limited availability 
at many institutions; however, some 
institutions do have the ability to mea-
sure ECA.3,4 The institution in which 
this patient was seen could perform 
the ECA, making it the primary moni-
toring value for dabigatran in this case. 
A calibration curve was constructed by 
running dabigatran calibrators with 
known drug concentrations. The plas-
ma dabigatran concentration versus 
the color change of each of the stan-
dards was then plotted to obtain a da-
bigatran curve. The patient’s ECA da-
bigatran level trends from admission 
to the day of surgery are presented in 
Figure 1. While ECA dabigatran levels 
were used to help determine when 
it was safe to perform surgery in this 
case, guidance regarding specific labo-
ratory levels on which to base this risk 
assessment are lacking. 
This case was noteworthy since 
the anticoagulation team recom-
mended surgical intervention based 
on analysis of time since last dose, 
package insert information, and spe-
cific ECA dabigatran level thresholds. 
The threshold recommendations were 
based on data obtained from pharma-
cokinetic analyses in relation to the

RE-LY trial using ECT assays.8,10 Dabi-
gatran trough concentrations of <50 
ng/mL were shown to correlate with 
an increased risk of thromboembo-
lism in these analyses, and this thresh-
old has been used in further studies 
of dabigatran, such as the RE-ALIGN 
trial, to ensure safety. RE-LY trial data 
indicated a median dabigatran trough 
concentration of 116 ng/mL (46.7 and 
269 ng/mL for the 10th and 90th per-
centiles, respectively) in patients with 
major bleeding. Patients with no ma-
jor bleeding had a median dabigatran 
trough concentration of 75.3 ng/mL 
(30.7 and 176 ng/mL for the 10th and 
90th percentiles, respectively).8,10,11 An 
ECA dabigatran value of <50 ng/mL 
falls below the median values for both 
of these bleeding categories and was 
deemed an acceptable goal signifying 
a diminished dabigatran effect, not 
absence of dabigatran, after compari-
son of drug concentrations related to 
bleeding frequency. 
An increase in ECA dabigatran levels 
on days 3 and 4 provided an additional 
interesting aspect to this case. The pa-
tient’s last dose of dabigatran was on 
the morning of hospital day 1, but ECA 
dabigatran level elevations were docu-
mented as late as day 4. This phenom-
enon might be explained by dabigatran 
rebounding from tissues back into the 
plasma as a part of dabigatran’s 2-phase 
distribution model.2 Unfortunately, we 
had no need for an ECA dabigatran 
level on the day of admission; it would 
have been informative to see if that level 
was lower than on the following day to 
support this theory. There was no evi-
dence of any decrease in renal function 
during this admission. Table 1 contains 
an overview of the anticoagulation as-
says monitored during the patient’s 
hospital stay.
The aPTT assay is also an option 
to detect dabigatran’s effects second-
ary to its wide availability. Variations 
in aPTT levels can be seen based on 
the type of coagulometer and the sen-
sitivity of the reagent used; however, 
aPTT has less variability than does PT. 
With a long-term standard dabigatran 
etexilate dosage of 150 mg twice daily, 
median peak and trough aPTT levels 
of 2 and 1.5 times control values, re-
spectively, may be seen. The aPTT has 
demonstrated a curvilinear prolonga-
tion of aPTT with dabigatran doses of 
up to 200 ng/mL and then leveled out 
above this range, favoring the notion 
that this assay may lack sensitivity to 
detect high and likely supratherapeu-
tic dabigatran concentrations.3,4,12,13 
The use of aPTT measurements to 
quantify the anticoagulation effect 
of dabigatran is not appropriate, es-
pecially with high plasma dabigatran 
concentrations. However, aPTT values 
may allow for a qualitative indication 
of dabigatran anticoagulation activ-
ity and may prove beneficial when as-
sessed along with another test. In this 
case, concurrent normalization of the 
aPTT along with achievement of the 
target ECA dabigatran level gave us 
confidence the patient was ready for 
surgery. It is unclear if a normal aPTT 
alone is a safe indicator for surgery 
since it is not sensitive to low levels of 
dabigatran. However, a normal aPTT 
along with a normal or measurable TT 
might be another option to help deter-
mine when surgery is safe.
PT is another coagulation assay 
that represents clotting time in the 
extrinsic pathway. The PT assay pro-
vides little assistance in determining 
anticoagulation effects of dabigatran 
at therapeutic doses, with only a slight 
elevation in INR seen. Evidence of PT 
elevations with supratherapeutic dabi-
gatran concentrations exists, but its use 
in guiding interventions or the need 
for reversal is unfavorable based on its 
poor sensitivity and assay variability.3,4 
Due to our patient’s significantly el-
evated PT on admission, along with the 
timing of the last dose of dabigatran, 
no other coagulation laboratory assays 
were recommended for that day.
Another assay of consideration 
is TT, which provides a direct mea-
sure of dabigatran’s activity due to 
its direct assessment on thrombin’s 
activity in a plasma sample and lin-
ear dose–response to therapeutic 
concentrations of the agent; it is also 
more widely available than ECA. How-
ever, TT will rapidly reach a maximum 
response and is unable to identify 
excessively high dabigatran concen-
trations.7 The high sensitivity of this 
monitoring parameter limits its ef-
fectiveness in quantifying medication 
levels. However, in cases such as ours, 
it can be very useful to detect the 
presence of dabigatran in a patient’s 
blood.3,4,12 The drop in TT on hospital 
day 6 was yet another useful indicator 
that the patient was ready for surgery. 
While the TT on day 6 was not indica-
tive of an absence of dabigatran in the 
patient’s serum, it provided confirma-
tion that dabigatran concentrations 
had decreased, ECA dabigatran level 
was nearing our goal, and aPTT was 
declining to within normal range.

 DABIGATRAN 
CASE REPORT
 
AM J HEALTH-SYST PHARM | VOLUME 74 | NUMBER 7 | APRIL 1, 2017  465
The effect of renal dysfunction on 
dabigatran clearance was clearly dis-
played in this case. Dabigatran under-
goes 80% renal elimination and has 
a half-life of 12–17 hours in healthy 
subjects. In patients with moderate 
renal dysfunction (CLcr of 30–50 mL/
min), the dabigatran half-life is 18 
hours and the AUC increases to 3.2 
times the AUC in normal renal func-
tion (CLcr of >80 mL/min). However, 
in patients with severe renal dysfunc-
tion (CLcr of <30 mL/min), a longer 
half-life of 27 hours has been seen, 
along with an AUC that is 6.3 times 
higher than in patients with normal 
renal function.1 
This patient’s initial SCr was 1.15 
mg/dL, which calculates to a CLcr of 
33 mL/min, and she was previously 
receiving dabigatran 150 mg twice a 
day, the approved dose for patients 
with this CLcr value. It is important to 
recognize the effects that renal func-
tion may have on dabigatran elimina-
tion as accumulation of dabigatran 
may have occurred in this case sec-
ondary to the patient’s moderate re-
nal dysfunction.
Utilization of reversal agents for 
dabigatran is another topic of inter-
est. The package insert for dabigat-
ran suggests that prothrombin com-
plex concentrates (such as Feiba NF 
[Baxter Healthcare, Westlake Village, 
CA]) and recombinant factor VIIa may 
be considered for reversal.1 Feiba NF 
was available for our patient in case 
of bleeding during or after surgery 
but was not recommended for more 
active reversal since this was not an 
emergency situation and it would 
confer a thrombotic risk to the pa-
tient. Feiba NF was available in case 
of 
intraoperative 
or 
postsurgical 
bleeding in the operating room phar-
macy but was never needed. Another 
option for dabigatran clearance is di-
alysis, which removes nearly 57% of 
dabigatran over 4 hours.1 However, 
there was not a strong desire to use 
this removal mechanism for the pre-
sented patient, especially due to the 
challenge of central line placement in 
a patient on dabigatran and the risk of 
bleeding. 
More recently, idarucizumab has 
gained approval from the Food and 
Drug Administration for the use of 
dabigatran reversal for emergent 
procedures or in life-threatening 
or uncontrolled bleeding based on 
clinical trial data. This agent would 
have been useful in our case, as our 
patient showed signs of delirium on 
hospital days 4 and 5, and we were 
very concerned about further delays 
of surgery. The monitoring strategies 
we used in this case could be used 
if we had idarucizumab at our dis-
posal. The ECA, aPTT, and TT levels 
could have been used after admin-
istration to demonstrate anticoagu-
lation reversal and monitor for any 
postoperative rebound in dabigatran 
levels.2 
Not all direct oral anticoagulants 
require routine anticoagulation moni-
toring during therapy. However, there 
are situations in which checking cer-
tain anticoagulation values can be 
helpful in clinical care. This is an im-
portant topic on which all clinicians 
who care for patients on anticoagu-
lants should be well versed.
Conclusion
Coagulation assay monitoring for 
dabigatran, with emphasis on an ECA 
dabigatran concentration of <50 ng/
mL, was used to assess safety regard-
ing bleeding risk before a nonemer-
gent surgical procedure in an 86-year-
old woman with a right femoral neck 
fracture.
