Effect of tobacco control policies on perinatal and child 
health: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Timor Faber, Arun Kumar, Johan P Mackenbach, Christopher Millett, Sanjay Basu, Aziz Sheikh, Jasper V Been
Summary
Background Tobacco smoking and smoke exposure during pregnancy and childhood cause considerable childhood 
morbidity and mortality. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether implementation of 
WHO’s recommended tobacco control policies (MPOWER) was of benefit to perinatal and child health.
Methods We searched 19 electronic databases, hand-searched references and citations, and consulted experts to 
identify studies assessing the association between implementation of MPOWER policies and child health. We did not 
apply any language restrictions, and searched the full time period available for each database, up to June 22, 2017. Our 
primary outcomes of interest were perinatal mortality, preterm birth, hospital attendance for asthma exacerbations, 
and hospital attendance for respiratory tract infections. Where possible and appropriate, we combined data from 
different studies in random-effects meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015023448.
Findings We identified 41 eligible studies (24 from North America, 16 from Europe, and one from China) that assessed 
combinations of the following MPOWER policies: smoke-free legislation (n=35), tobacco taxation (n=11), and smoking 
cessation services (n=3). Risk of bias was low in 23 studies, moderate in 16, and high in two. Implementation of 
smoke-free legislation was associated with reductions in rates of preterm birth (–3·77% [95% CI –6·37 to –1·16]; 
ten studies, 27 530 183 individuals), rates of hospital attendance for asthma exacerbations (–9·83% [–16·62 to –3·04]; 
five studies, 684 826 events), and rates of hospital attendance for all respiratory tract infections (–3·45% [–4·64 to –2·25]; 
two studies, 1 681 020 events) and for lower respiratory tract infections (–18·48% [–32·79 to –4·17]; three studies, 
887 414 events). Associations appeared to be stronger when comprehensive smoke-free laws were implemented than 
when partial smoke-free laws were implemented. Among two studies assessing the association between smoke-free 
legislation and perinatal mortality, one showed significant reductions in stillbirth and neonatal mortality but did not 
report the overall effect on perinatal mortality, while the other showed no change in perinatal mortality. Meta-analysis 
of studies on other MPOWER policies was not possible; all four studies on increasing tobacco taxation and one of two 
on offering disadvantaged pregnant women help to quit smoking that reported on our primary outcomes had positive 
findings. Assessment of publication bias was only possible for studies assessing the association between smoke-free 
legislation and preterm birth, showing some degree of bias.
Interpretation Smoke-free legislation is associated with substantial benefits to child health. The majority of studies on 
other MPOWER policies also indicated a positive effect. These findings provide strong support for implementation of 
such policies comprehensively across the world.

Introduction
Almost half of children worldwide are regularly exposed 
to second-hand smoke, and 28% of the 600 000 deaths 
each year related to second-hand smoke occur in 
children.1,2 Maternal smoking and second-hand smoke 
exposure during pregnancy are detrimental to fetal 
growth and development, leading to adverse birth 
outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, being 
small for gestational age, and perinatal and infant 
mortality.3–8 Additionally, second-hand smoke exposure 
presents substantial health risks postnatally by 
increasing the risk of asthma and respiratory tract 
infections.1,9
Protection of children from the adverse health 
implications of second-hand smoke during important 
phases of development and the subsequent disease 
burden carried on into adulthood is crucial. The WHO 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 
aims to reduce tobacco consumption and second-hand 
smoke exposure through national tobacco control 
programmes.2 In 2008, six MPOWER measures were 
introduced to guide FCTC implementation (panel).2,10 
With tobacco use increasingly becoming a problem of 
developing countries already experiencing the largest 
burden of early-life morbidity and mortality, the absence 
of tobacco regulation is set to be a big driver of between-
country inequality in child health outcomes.11 However, 
evaluations of the effectiveness of tobacco control 
interventions have generally excluded children, focusing 
instead on smoking rates and adult health outcomes.12–14

In a previous systematic review,15 we partly addressed 
this gap in the literature by synthesising available evidence 
on the effect of smoke-free legislation (ie, “P” in 
MPOWER, for ”Protect people from tobacco smoke”) on 
perinatal and child health. By combining data from 
11 studies, we found smoke-free legislation to be associated 
with substantial reductions in preterm birth and hospital 
admissions for asthma among children. Studies have 
since addressed various knowledge gaps identified in 
our review, including assessments of the effect of smoke-
free legislation on respiratory tract infections and on 
general practitioner (GP) consultations.16–19 The increased 
number of studies now available was also anticipated to 
allow investigation of another knowledge gap: exploration 
of a potential dose–response association between the 
comprehensiveness of smoke-free laws and their effect on 
child health. In addition to addressing this association, we 
sought to substantially broaden the focus of our systematic 
review by systematically evaluating the early-life health 
effect of the entire range of MPOWER measures. This 
analysis has implications for the Sustainable Development 
Goal 3 (SDG 3) aims to strengthen FCTC implementation 
and reduce child mortality. As such, findings from this 
study can guide policy making for prioritisation of the 
most effective tobacco control policies to protect child 
health, especially in parts of the world where MPOWER 
implementation is lagging behind, while identifying the 
key remaining knowledge gaps that need to be addressed.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis was done 
according to a peer-reviewed protocol that is published20 
and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015023448). We 
followed the PRISMA checklist when reporting our 
findings.21 Ethical approval was not required for this study.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated 
the association between one or more MPOWER tobacco 
control policies and health outcomes among fetuses, 
neonates, or children (ie, the majority of the study 
population aged <12 years).
We searched for published studies in the following 
databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Tobacco smoke exposure is the world’s leading cause of 
preventable morbidity and premature mortality. Children 
cannot control their tobacco smoke exposure and therefore 
need protection through tobacco control measures. In a 
previous systematic review, we investigated the associations 
between smoke-free legislation and perinatal and child health 
outcomes. We searched 14 online medical research databases, 
the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, hand-
searched references and citations, and consulted a panel of 
experts in the field to identify published and unpublished 
literature in any language from January, 1975, to May, 2013, on 
the associations between smoke-free legislation and our 
outcomes of interest. The primary outcomes were preterm 
birth, low birthweight, and hospital attendance for asthma. We 
identified 11 studies showing that smoke-free legislation was 
associated with significant reductions in preterm birth and 
severe asthma exacerbations. Studies have since addressed 
various knowledge gaps identified in our previous review, 
including assessments of the effect of smoke-free legislation on 
respiratory tract infections, the most important contributor to 
the global burden of paediatric morbidity and mortality 
associated with tobacco smoke exposure. The increased 
number of studies now available was also anticipated to allow 
investigation of another knowledge gap: exploration of a 
potential dose–response association between the 
comprehensiveness of smoke-free laws and their effect on child 
health. Furthermore, we sought to substantially broaden the 
focus of our study by evaluating the early-life health effect of 
the entire range of WHO-recommended tobacco control 
policies (ie, MPOWER). Following a prespecified and 
peer-reviewed protocol, we did a comprehensive literature 
search for experimental and quasi-experimental studies 
assessing associations between implementation of MPOWER 
policies and key perinatal and childhood outcomes associated 
with tobacco smoke exposure.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review examining 
the association between the full spectrum of MPOWER policies 
and perinatal and child health. Our findings add value to the 
existing evidence base by identifying a link between smoke-free 
legislation and a substantial reduction in severe paediatric 
respiratory tract infections, providing consistent evidence that 
comprehensive smoke-free laws are associated with broad 
health effects, and collating evidence supporting the potential 
for other MPOWER measures to benefit child health. We also 
identified several key knowledge gaps, including a shortage of 
studies in low-income and middle-income countries, and of 
studies assessing MPOWER measures other than smoke-free 
legislation, tobacco tax increases, and smoking cessation 
services.
Implications of all the available evidence
With most of the world’s population currently not covered by 
comprehensive tobacco control policies, there is great potential 
for global public health gains by protecting unborn babies and 
children from tobacco smoke exposure. Future efforts should 
focus on increasing the uptake of comprehensive MPOWER 
policies worldwide to protect the health of children, while 
developing and evaluating new and ongoing tobacco control 
policy initiatives around the world.

for unpublished studies.
The appendix (p 1) contains an overview of the search 
strategies for each database. We did not apply any 
language restrictions, and searched the full time period 
available for each database. Searches were updated on 
June 22, 2017
. To identify any additional relevant studies, 
we hand-searched reference lists of, and citations to, 
included studies and relevant review papers, and 
consulted experts in the field (appendix p 2).
We focused on studies that evaluated governmental 
public health interventions that could be classified 
according to the MPOWER acronym (panel), with the 
exception of “M” since “Monitoring tobacco use and 
prevention policies” itself was not expected to affect 
health outcomes. We followed the methodological 
approach recommended by the Cochrane Effective 
Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) group to 
select studies with the most robust designs for our 
primary 
analyses: 
randomised 
controlled 
trials 
(including 
cluster 
randomised 
controlled 
trials), 
controlled clinical trials (including cluster controlled 
clinical trials), interrupted time series studies (including 
difference-in-difference designs, which were categorised 
as controlled interrupted time series studies),22 and 
controlled before-and-after studies. To assess the 
robustness of our findings, we also included non-EPOC 
study designs in sensitivity analyses: uncontrolled 
before-and-after studies, prospective or retrospective 
cohort studies, and case-control and nested case-control 
studies. Primary and secondary outcomes were selected 
on the basis of their established associations with 
maternal smoking during pregnancy and prenatal or 
childhood second-hand smoke exposure,23,24 and their 
relative contributions to the global burden of adverse 
child health.1,25 Our primary outcomes of interest were 
perinatal mortality, preterm birth, asthma exacerbations 
requiring hospital attendance, and respiratory tract 
infections requiring hospital attendance. Secondary 
outcomes of interest were stillbirth, early neonatal 
mortality, neonatal mortality, late neonatal mortality, 
post-neonatal mortality, infant mortality, child mortality, 
extremely low birthweight, very low birthweight, low 
birthweight, birthweight (continuous scale), very small 
for gestational age, small for gestational age, extremely 
preterm birth, very preterm birth, gestational age 
(continuous scale), congenital anomalies, asthma, 
wheezing, respiratory tract infections, upper respiratory 
tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, otitis 
media with effusion, and chronic cough. Studies were 
excluded if they only measured smoking prevalence, 
smoking behaviour, second-hand smoke exposure, 
surrogate outcomes, or economic outcomes. Studies 
that reported outcomes for both adults and children 
were included if paediatric subgroup data were available.
Data analysis
Two reviewers (TF and AK) independently assessed all 
search results by title and abstract, and by full text for 
potential eligible studies identified. Any disagreements 
were resolved through joint discussion or via an 
adjudicator (JVB).
Relevant data were extracted with a customised data 
extraction form (appendix, pp 3–5). Study authors were 
contacted for clarification where necessary and to obtain 
relevant data that were missing from the reports.
A risk-of-bias assessment form was created on the 
basis of EPOC criteria for interrupted time series and 
controlled before-and-after studies.26 The Effective Public 
Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool was adapted to 
assess the risk of bias of observational studies.27 
Two reviewers (TF and AK) independently extracted data 
and assessed risk of bias, with disagreements resolved 
through discussion or arbitration (JVB).
Point estimates and corresponding 95% CIs for effect 
sizes or association measures were extracted. For 
dichotomous outcomes, risk ratios (RRs) were extracted. 
Where RRs were not available, we calculated RRs from 
odds ratios (ORs) using the following formula, where 
PEER is the patient-expected event rate in the control 
group:
When PEER was not available in interrupted time 
series studies we used the overall event rate across the 
study population as an approximation. For outcomes that 
could occur more than once (eg, hospital attendances for 
asthma and respiratory tract infections), we used 
incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
Aggregated effect estimates were calculated to assess 
the association between each tobacco control policy and 
individual health outcomes, where feasible. Relative risk 
differences were extracted or calculated from absolute 
risk differences and were pooled in random-effects meta-
analyses given anticipated heterogeneity. Step changes 
(ie, immediate risk changes) following introduction of an 
intervention were pooled in separate analyses from slope 
changes (ie, gradual risk changes). Heterogeneity was 
assessed by the I² statistic. For the meta-analyses, we 
selected the effect estimate of the most comprehensive 
intervention within each MPOWER category from each

study. In case of overlapping populations between 
studies, we selected one study according to the following 
hierarchy: the lowest risk of bias, the most comprehensive 
intervention, or the largest study population. We also 
extracted data on changes in smoking behaviour and 
second-hand 
smoke 
exposure 
if 
reported. 
The 
comprehensiveness of smoke-free legislation was 
assessed by counting the number of locations that were 
made completely smoke-free, out of eight prespecified 
options as suggested by WHO.2 Policies that were 
completely smoke-free in all eight locations were 
considered to be comprehensive.
We did sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of 
our findings by reanalysing the data for the primary 
outcomes with the addition of non-EPOC studies, and by 
restricting analyses to studies with low risk of bias and 
moderate risk of bias. Where possible, we did subgroup 
analyses according to the comprehensiveness of each 
intervention. Where possible, the effect of each 
intervention was reported according to socioeconomic 
status, alongside its overall effect.
We assessed risk of bias across studies using funnel 
plots when ten or more studies were included in a meta-
analysis.

Results
We identified 25 478 citations from bibliographic 
databases and an additional 20 from other sources. After 
removal of duplicates, 12 392 unique citations were 
screened by title and abstract, and 65 full texts were 
sourced. Of these, 41 EPOC studies16–19,28–64 and 
three non-EPOC studies65–67 fit the inclusion criteria 
(figure 1; appendix, pp 6, 7). The EPOC studies included 
data from more than 57 million births, and from 
4·6 million GP diagnoses and 2·7 million hospital 
admissions for respiratory conditions.
The appendix (pp 8–20) details the main characteristics 
of the EPOC studies. Among these, 26 were interrupted 
time series studies,16–19,31,32,37,38,40,42,43,45,46,48,50–52,54,55,57–59,61–64 14 were

interrupted time series methodology.68 The three non-
EPOC studies were uncontrolled before-and-after studies 
(appendix, p 21).65–67 Model characteristics of individual 
studies can be found in the appendix (pp 22–31). The 
EPOC studies were done in 14 countries across

assessed the same outcomes in partially overlapping study 
populations.18,29,31,36,38,43,45,46,49,53,56,59,61
Risk of bias of individual studies is reported in detail in 
the appendix (pp 32, 33). For the EPOC studies, risk of 
bias was low in 23 studies,16–18,28,30–33,36,37,39,40,44–48,51–53,58,63,64 
moderate in 16,19,34,35,41–43,49,50,54–57,59–62 and high in two.29,38 For 
the non-EPOC studies, risk of bias was high for 
two studies66,67 and unclear for one.65
28 studies assessed the association between smoke-
free legislation and one or more primary outcomes (ie, 
perinatal mortality, preterm birth, asthma exacerbations 
requiring hospital attendance, and respiratory tract 
infections requiring hospital attendance), five assessed 
the association between tobacco taxation and primary 
outcomes, and two assessed the association between 
policies providing smoking cessation services and our 
primary outcomes (tables 1, 2, and 3); four studies 
assessed a combination of these interventions, and ten 
studies only assessed secondary outcomes. A meta-
analysis was only possible for studies on smoke-free 
legislation because studies on tax increases and smoking 
cessation services had variable outcome reporting and 
overlapping study populations.
A national study from the Netherlands, comprising 
1 980 727 births, found no change in perinatal mortality 
following a law to prohibit smoking in workplaces and 
on public transport, or following expansion of the law to 
include restaurants and bars.58 In a study from England, 
comprising 10 291 113 births, comprehensive smoke-free 
legislation in public places and workplaces (including 
restaurants and bars) was associated with a reduction in 
stillbirths (–7·8%; 95% CI –18·0 to –3·5) and neonatal 
deaths (–7·6%; –11·7 to –3·4).32 The overall effect on 
perinatal mortality (ie, stillbirths and early neonatal 
deaths combined) was not reported in this study. 
Therefore, no meta-analysis was possible with these 
two studies.
15 studies investigated the association between smoke-
free legislation and preterm births.30,31,34,37,43–46,52–54,56,58,62,63 In 
the meta-analysis, smoke-free legislation was associated 
with a significant immediate reduction in preterm births 
(ten studies, 27 530 183 individuals; –3·77% [95% CI 
–6·37 to –1·16]; figure 2A). Two studies caused some 
funnel plot asymmetry suggestive of publication bias, but 
this asymmetry was unlikely to have affected our findings 
(appendix p 34). No additional gradual change in preterm 
births was evident (two studies, 1 316 633 individuals; 
–0·01% per year [95% CI –6·76 to 6·73]; figure 3A). 
One study47 examined the association between provision 
of smoking cessation services and preterm births. 
Medicaid enrolment policies permitting low-income 
pregnant women to receive smoking cessation services 
were not associated with a change in preterm births 
(table 2).47 Reductions in preterm birth were observed after 
tobacco tax increases among women in specific population 
subgroups in two studies.46,53 One study reported tobacco 
taxation to be associated with reduced rates of preterm

birth among white mothers with low levels of education 
and among black mothers irrespective of level of education 
(table 3).46 The other study reported a 0·7 percentage point 
decrease in preterm births per USD$ increase in tax 
among women aged 20–24 years, and a 1·0 percentage 
point decrease per USD$ increase in tax among women 
older than 34 years (table 3).53
Associations between smoke-free legislation and the 
incidence of hospital attendances for childhood asthma 
were reported in ten studies (table 1).18,36,38,40,42,49,51,55,59,61 In the 
meta-analysis, both an immediate reduction in asthma 
exacerbations requiring hospital attendance (five studies, 
684 826 events; –9·83% [95% CI –16·62 to –3·04]; 
figure 2B) and an additional gradual reduction were seen 
(four studies, 243 377 events; –5·94% per year [95% CI 
–11·48 to –0·41]; figure 3B). No change in asthma 
admissions was seen following a health reform legislation 
that provided smoking cessation services for Medicaid 
recipients in one study.18 Among three US studies18,49,50  
with overlapping populations evaluating tobacco taxation 
and asthma exacerbations requiring hospital attendance, 
the study with the lowest risk of bias found no significant 
reductions following state-wide increases in cigarette 
excise tax (table 3).18
The association between smoke-free legislation and the 
incidence of hospital admissions for acute respiratory 
tract infections was reported in four studies (table 1).16,18,19,64 
In the meta-analysis, an immediate reduction was 
seen in respiratory tract infections (upper and lower 
respiratory tract infections combined) requiring hospital 
attendance (two studies, 1 681 020 events; –3·45% [95% CI 
–4·64 to –2·25]; figure 2C). For the studies that reported 
specifically on lower respiratory tract infections, the meta-
analysis showed an immediate reduction in admissions 
for lower respiratory tract infections following smoke-free 
legislation (three studies, 887 414 events; –18·48% [95% CI 
–32·79 to –4·17]; figure 2D). No additional gradual 
reduction in lower respiratory tract infections was 
observed (two studies; 748 175 events: –6·81% per year 
[95% CI –20·63 to 7·01]; figure 3C). No significant 
association 
between 
smoke-free 
legislation 
and 
admissions for upper respiratory tract infections was seen 
in the meta-analysis (two studies; 1 390 056 events; 0·42% 
[95% CI –3·28 to 4·13]; figure 2E). One study18 reported 
that a health reform legislation that provided smoking 
cessation services for Medicaid recipients was associated 
with an immediate –6% (95% CI –10 to –1) decrease in 
hospital admissions for childhood upper respiratory tract 
infection, but not in admissions for lower respiratory tract 
infection (table 2). The same study18 evaluated the effect of 
tobacco taxation, showing a –9% decrease (95% CI 
–16 to –2) in lower respiratory tract infections requiring 
admission to hospital per USD$ increase in cigarette 
excise tax at the state level (table 3).

pp 47–76). In the meta-analyses (appendix pp 77–85), 
smoke-free legislation was associated with immediate 
reductions 
in 
very 
preterm 
birth 
(five 
studies; 
3 354 636 individuals; –9·99% [95% CI –15·74 to –4·24]), 
low birthweight (nine studies; 35 206 918 individuals, 
–2·77% [–4·36 to –1·19]), and small for gestational age 
births (eight studies; 27 649 380 individuals; –1·84% 
[–3·21 to –0·47]), a gradual reduction in very small for 
gestational age births (two studies; 1 298 276 individuals; 
–0·60% per year [–0·60 to –0·60]), and a small increase 
in birthweight (seven studies; 3 238 575 individuals; 
12·45 g [95% CI 2·09–22·81]). No significant changes in 
other secondary outcomes were seen following smoke-
free legislation. Legislation to promote prenatal care, 
including smoking cessation services for low-income 
pregnant women, was not associated with a change in 
small for gestational age births in one US study.47 In 
another US study,28 although such legislation was 
associated 
with 
increased 
duration 
of 
gestation, 
depending on time of enrolment (308 521 participants; 
0·063 weeks [95% CI 0·008–0·118] among women who 
enrolled in the Medicaid insurance programme before or 
during pregnancy and 0·086 weeks [0·004–0·168] among 
women who enrolled during pregnancy), it was not 
associated with a change in birthweight (appendix 
pp 66, 67). One study showed reductions in extremely and 
very preterm births following tobacco tax increases,53 with 
two others also showing an increase in gestation.28,35 
Among five studies assessing the link between tobacco 
tax and birthweight, two showed a positive effect,39,46 
albeit of very small magnitude. Accordingly, only one of 
these five studies showed a reduction in low birthweight 
following tobacco tax increases.46 This study also found 
reductions in small for gestational age births; both 
associations were confined to low socioeconomic groups.46 
In two studies assessing very low birthweight, no changes 
were seen following tobacco tax increases.39,53 Tobacco 
taxes were associated with a decreased risk of infant 
mortality in two studies assessing this association.57,60 In 
one of these studies, however, an increase in fetal deaths 
was also observed.60 One study showed significant 
reductions in paediatric asthma prevalence following 
tobacco tax increases.33
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis provides 
considerable evidence indicating child health benefits 
associated with implementation of MPOWER policies. 
By pooling data of 27·5 million births, 685 000 hospital 
admissions for asthma, and 2·3 million hospital 
admissions for respiratory tract infections, we found a 
3·7% reduction in preterm births, a 9·8% reduction in 
childhood hospital admissions for asthma, and an 
18·5% reduction in hospital admissions for lower 
respiratory tract infections following implementation of 
smoke-free legislation. Subgroup analyses suggested 
that health benefits were increased when the most 
comprehensive laws were applied. We also identified 
several studies indicating that tobacco tax increases and 
governmental support for smoking cessation services 
could benefit child health. Taken together with substantial 
existing evidence on the effectiveness of tobacco control 
policies in improving adult health, these findings provide 
strong support for implementation of such policies 
comprehensively across the world.
This study is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive 
assessment done to date of the effect of tobacco control 
policies on perinatal and child health outcomes. On the 
basis of our previous work,15 and the challenges of 
evaluating governmental policies through randomised 
trials,69,70 we anticipated that most eligible studies would 
be of quasi-experimental design. We therefore followed 
EPOC guidelines to restrict our primary analyses to study 
types that were considered to be at lowest risk of bias. We 
confirmed the robustness of our findings via a number of 
prespecified sensitivity analyses, which indicated that our 
findings were not sensitive to exclusion of studies with a 
high risk of bias or inclusion of purely observational 
studies. Our work builds on existing evidence since it 
focuses on all available evidence on the effect of tobacco 
control policies on perinatal and child health. The 
consistency of this evidence, in our view, supports the 
validity of our findings.
However, our study has some limitations. The risks of 
residual confounding and bias in quasi-experimental 
studies—due to non-random allocation of the intervention 
and the absence of a control group—need to be considered 
when interpreting the results.71 Additional limitations 
include between-study heterogeneity in methodology, 
differences 
in 
follow-up 
duration 
and 
diagnosis 
ascertainment, the absence of assessment of the likely 
causal pathways between the policies and their health 
effects in several studies, and the low number of studies 
in each meta-analysis, which precluded assessment of 
publication bias for most outcomes and the use of meta-
regression.
This study adds to our previous work.15 We identified 
an additional 24 studies on the effect of smoke-free 
legislation on child health, comprising additional data 
from more than 10 million births, 4·6 million GP 
diagnoses, and 2·2 million hospital admissions. These 
additional studies allowed us, for the first time, to 
identify the association between smoke-free legislation 
and reductions in severe respiratory tract infections, 
which is particularly relevant since respiratory tract 
infections account for the vast majority of the global 
burden of disease resulting from second-hand smoke 
exposure in children.1 We also broadened the scope of 
this study to include all MPOWER policies, identifying 
several studies on the effect of tobacco tax increases and 
smoking cessation services on child health. We also 
identified one study evaluating a tobacco control policy 
that could not be classified according to WHO’s 
MPOWER Framework. Following an increase in the

minimum legal age to purchase cigarettes from 18 years 
to 21 years in the US state of Pennsylvania, a 1·4 (95% CI 
–2·6 to –0·2) percentage point reduction in low 
birthweight was observed, which was largest among 
smoking mothers and associated with a significant 
reduction in prenatal cigarette consumption.72
Socioeconomic disparities in smoking and related 
morbidity are widely documented and affect both adults 
and children. For example, such disparities were 
estimated to account for 38% of the inequality in 
stillbirths and 31% of the inequality in infant deaths in 
Scotland.73 Previous systematic reviews74–76 showed that, 
among MPOWER measures, tobacco taxation has the 
greatest potential to reduce socioeconomic disparities 
associated with smoking in both young people and adults. 
We identified some evidence suggesting a pro-equity 
effect of both tobacco taxation and smoke-free legislation 
on early-life health. Since smokers are over-represented 
among deprived communities, such relative benefits of 
tobacco control policies translate into larger absolute 
effects in children from low socioeconomic groups than 
in children from high socioeconomic groups.

Given the inherent restrictions in attributing causality 
from quasi-experimental studies, it is important to 
interpret the findings in light of circumstantial evidence 
supporting the link between tobacco control policies and 
child health benefits. We have previously described the 
main likely causal pathways.23 Tobacco smoke exposure 
during fetal stages and childhood is associated 
with various adverse perinatal and child health 
outcomes.4–6,8,77–83 Several studies have shown substantial 
reductions in maternal smoking31,34,52,56,84,85 and in second-
hand smoke exposure among adults (including pregnant 
women) and children after implementation of tobacco 
control policies (appendix pp 86–89).12,13,86–90 Whereas 
smoke-free laws specifically target public spaces, various 
studies have shown subsequent increases in smoking 
cessation and reduced initiation,12,91,92 as well as changes 
in social norms leading to decreased smoking in the 
home environment,93–97 which is probably the primary 
source of second-hand smoke exposure among children. 
Our study provides further support for a causal 
association, since we found the largest decreases in our 
outcomes of interest when comprehensive smoke-free 
legislation was considered. This observation is suggestive 
of a dose–response association, which has previously 
also been identified for adult studies.98 Because of the low 
number of studies in individual meta-analyses we did 
not formally test for this interaction, and future efforts to 
do so might strengthen our findings as more evidence 
becomes available.
The global health burden of tobacco use is tremendous 
and its total global economic cost is estimated to be around 
USD$1·4 trillion.99 Despite global progress in tobacco 
control, over a third of the world’s population remains 
unprotected by any MPOWER policy at the recommended 
level.2,11 This issue is important because 40–50% of children 
worldwide are regularly exposed to tobacco smoke, and 
tobacco control policies have substantial potential to 
reduce the associated burden of death and disease.1 This 
global burden is acknowledged by the prioritisation within 
SDG 3 of more effective FCTC implementation and its 
aim to reduce early-life mortality; our data now show that 
these initiatives can act synergistically. Because our effect 
estimates are expressed as relative changes, background 
prevalence of smoking and second-hand smoke exposure, 
and of the health outcomes evaluated, should be considered 
when extrapolating our findings to local contexts. We did 
not formally assess the comparative effectiveness or cost-
effectiveness of different MPOWER policies. Tax increases 
are considered to be the most effective measure to reduce 
smoking prevalence,2 and although our review indicates 
that tobacco taxation is likely to be associated with child 
health benefits, the evidence was particularly strong for 
smoke-free legislation. Smoke-free laws are the tobacco 
control policy most strongly supported by the public 
and appear to be the most straightforward measure to 
protect child health, particularly when implemented 
comprehensively.12 The synergistic effect of various policies 
implemented at the highest recommended levels in 
reducing smoking prevalence should be considered when 
planning policy changes,14 which, when implemented as 
part of a strong tobacco control programme, can be highly 
cost-effective.100,101 Ongoing monitoring is needed to 
continue to evaluate the effectiveness of policies aimed at 
reducing the impact of tobacco, in particular the 
effectiveness of novel endgame strategies targeted at 
ending rather than controlling the global tobacco 
epidemic.102
Reports indicate that at least two of five people living in 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries 
remain 
unprotected by any MPOWER policy measure,2 and that 
wide variations in implementation and compliance are 
present across these countries.103 This finding is of 
concern, since these countries have the largest burden of 
tobacco-related illness and death, and harbour nearly 80% 
of the world’s smokers.2 We highlight an important gap in

the literature as more research is required in low-income 
and middle-income countries to understand the effect of 
tobacco control policies in these regions. Modelling 
approaches are increasingly being used to estimate the 
effect of tobacco control policies in low-income and 
middle-income countries, and original studies are now 
becoming available.104,105 Efforts are underway to address 
the current absence of a child health focus in this area, 
which will be essential to inform the global policy agenda. 
Furthermore, we found no studies specifically evaluating 
early-life health outcomes in relation to legislation to 
prohibit tobacco advertising and sponsorship, or warnings 
against the dangers of tobacco. Priority should be given to 
establishing a core set of outcomes related to perinatal and 
child health, alongside adult health, for all future studies 
examining the effect of tobacco control policies.
In conclusion, given the positive findings of this 
systematic review it is crucial that the uptake of compre-
hensive tobacco control policies is accelerated worldwide 
to further protect children from the health hazards of 
tobacco smoke exposure,106 in parallel with efforts to 
evaluate the effectiveness of novel policy initiatives.
