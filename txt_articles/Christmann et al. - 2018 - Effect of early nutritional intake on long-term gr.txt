Background: Preterm infants are at risk for impaired bone mineralization and growth in length later in life due to
inadequate nutritional intake in the early postnatal period.
Objective: To investigate whether increased nutritional supplementation of calcium, phosphate and protein in
Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants during the first 14 days after birth was associated with improvement
in length and bone development until 9–10 years of age.
Design: Observational follow-up study of VLBW infants (birth weight b 1500 g or gestational age b 32 weeks) born in
two consecutive years (eligible infants: 2004 n: 63 and 2005: n: 66). Cohort 2005 received higher intake of calcium,
phosphate and protein with parenteral nutrition compared to Cohort 2004. Anthropometric data were collected
during standard follow-up visits until five years, and additionally at 9–10 years of age including measurements of
bone mineral content, bone mineral density of the whole body and lumbar spine determined by dual-energy X-
ray absorptiometry. Long-term growth trajectories of both cohorts were evaluated separately for participants
born appropriate (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA), stratified by gender. Multivariate linear regression
was used to examine the effect of nutritional intake and clinical covariates on length and bone mineralization.
Results: Both cohorts achieved a catch-up in length to SDS within the normal range by 6 months (length SDS:
estimated mean (95% confidence interval (CI): 6 months: Cohort 2004: −0.7 (−1.1, −0.3) Cohort 2005: −0.5
(−0.8, −0.2)). Bone mineral content and density were within the normal range and not different between the
cohorts. SGA children achieved a catch-up in length at 5 years with bone mineralization comparable to AGA
children. Only for girls birth weight was significantly associated with length SDS (per gram: β 0.001; 95% CI
(0.000, 0.003); p = 0.03) There was no evidence of an association between early nutritional intake and bone min-
eralization.
Conclusion: Children born as appropriate or small for gestational age preterm infants are able to catch up in length
after the postnatal period, and achieve a normal length and bone mineralization at age nine–ten years. An improve-
ment of calcium and phosphate intake during the first 14 days after birth was not associated with improvement in
length and bone development.

1. Introduction
Achieving growth and development comparable to healthy term
born infants has been a challenge for the treatment of preterm born in-
fants for many decades [1]. As the survival of Very Low Birth Weight
(VLBW) infants has increased significantly during the last years, it is im-
portant to evaluate their long-term outcomes, especially since recom-
mendations and policies with regard to nutritional intake have been
changed to improve postnatal growth [2–4].

 While early cohort studies demonstrated that VLBW infants experi-
enced a significant growth retardation during the early postnatal period
without catch-up to the initial birth percentile, more recent studies
showed that improvement of early nutritional intake diminishes the cu-
mulative nutritional deficit and thereby may prevent growth retarda-
tion [5–7]. Growth and skeletal development seem to be closely
related [8–10]. Adequate bone mineralization is necessary for optimal
development of the bones [11–13]. Given the difficulties associated
with meeting the nutritional needs of VLBW infants and to provide suf-
ficient nutritional supply of minerals, VLBW infants are especially at risk
of impaired bone mineral content [14–17]. While early studies showed
that exclusive feeding of human milk in preterm infants leads to defi-
ciencies of calcium and phosphate, it is nowadays generally recom-
mended to fortify human milk with additional minerals, protein and
vitamins [18–20]. Furthermore, parenteral supplementation of calcium
and phosphate has been improved through the inclusion of organic
phosphate in parenteral nutrition (PN) [21].
Only a few studies have evaluated long-term bone development of
VLBW children until childhood and adolescence [22–30]. Their findings
were diverse but most of the studies showed that these former preterm
infants remained smaller later in life, some with lower bone mineraliza-
tion, others with low mineralization but normal in proportion to their
small body size. Several studies found impaired bone mineral content
in boys compared to girls [22,31]. Despite the low content of minerals,
human milk seemed to have a positive effect on bone development
[32,33]. All of the participants of these studies received diets that pro-
vided nutrients markedly below the current recommendations and
therefore the results may not be representative for the population of
preterm infants treated nowadays. A more recent randomized trial in
VLBW infants found a positive effect of post- discharge feeding on
BMC in comparison to human milk and term formula at the corrected
age of 6 months, irrespective of gain in weight and length [34].
Previously we reported the short-term outcome results for two con-
secutive year-cohorts of VLBW infants that differed with regard to the
nutritional intake during the first two weeks of life [35]. The second co-
hort received a higher intake of protein, energy as well as calcium and
phosphate and this was associated with improved weight gain during
the early postnatal period and at the corrected age of two years there
was a tendency of improved growth in length. A secondary analysis re-
vealed that this was mainly based on improvement in boys. Small for
gestational age (SGA) infants had a higher postnatal weight gain than
appropriate for gestational age (AGA) born infants [35]. For the current
study we describe the long-term growth in length for the surviving in-
fants of the original cohorts and analyze the effect of the postnatal nutri-
tional intake on length and bone mineralization at the of age 9 to
10 years. We hypothesized that increased nutritional intake would
lead to improved length and bone mineralization.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population and design
This observational follow-up study evaluated the long-term out-
comes of growth and bone mineralization of a previously described pro-
spective cohort study that was conducted in 2004 and 2005, in order to
evaluate changes in the composition of parenteral nutrition (PN)
[35,36]. Surviving participants of both cohorts who were eligible for
the standard follow-up schedule provided to VLBW infants born prior
to 32 weeks of gestation, or those with a birth weight below 1500 g
were included in the study. (Eligible children: Cohort 2004: n = 63; Co-
hort 2005: n = 66). These children were invited for an additional outpa-
tient clinic visit that included an evaluation of bone mineralization by
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The parents of all partici-
pants provided written informed consent for the additional investiga-
tion. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (2013/
594) and registered within the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR = TC4842).
In accordance with the standard follow-up program, growth and
general health status were recorded at the corrected ages of six months,
and 1, 2 and 5 years. For the current study, we extended the follow-up
by inviting children who were previously seen during the national
follow-up program to return for further testing around the ages of
nine and 10 years.
2.2. Nutritional protocol
The 2004 and 2005 cohorts included preterm infants admitted to the
level III neonatal intensive care unit (Radboud University Medical Cen-
ter, The Netherlands) on the first day of life after it was estimated that
parenteral nutrition would be needed for at least 5 days. Infants with
major congenital malformations or asphyxia were excluded. The nutri-
tional protocols for the two cohorts primarily differed in terms of the
parenteral nutritional intake with higher amounts of protein, calcium
and phosphate provided to the 2005 Cohort. (Table 1) Following the
recommendation of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterolo-
gy, Hepatology and Nutrition the 2005 PN provided 3 mmol per kg per
day of calcium and 1.92 mmol per kg per day of glycerophosphate
[4,37]. According to the nutritional protocol of 2005, full PN was
achieved four days following birth, while the maximum amount of PN
in Cohort 2004 was achieved later, at day six. For both cohorts, enteral
feeding was started on the first day of life and human milk was enriched
with a commercially available fortifier (HMF) (Nutrilon Nenatal BMF,
Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) from an intake of 50 ml per
day onwards. HMF added 1.6 mmol/dL of calcium and 1.95 mmol/dL
of phosphate. If human milk was not available, infants received a pre-
term formula (Nutrilon Nenatal Start, Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The
Netherlands). The formula contained 2.5 mmol per dL of calcium and
1.6 mmol per dL of phosphate and 200 IE per dL of Vitamin D. The full
nutritional protocol has previously been described in detail [35,36]. No
major changes in clinical practice occurred and all infants received nu-
trition according to standard institutional protocols.
2.3. Anthropometric measurements and questionnaire
At the last visit length and weight were determined, and the health
condition evaluated using a questionnaire. We specifically focused on
morbidities and the use of medication that could have affected growth
and bone mineralization, for example corticosteroids, asthma and frac-
tures. For the preceding follow-up visits anthropometric measurements

 were collected either from the patient charts or requested from the
local paediatric out-patient clinics specifically for measurements at
term corrected age (TCA). Body weight was measured to the nearest
0.1 kg using an electronic digital scale (SECA MOD701) and body
height to the nearest 0.1 cm by a wall-tapered height meter (SECA
MOD240).
2.4. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry
Bone mineralization of the whole body and lumbar spine (L1-L4)
was evaluated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (QDR
Discovery A 85606, Hologic, Inc., USA) (DEXA). The measurements
of this DEXA-scan were analyzed using the APEX system software
version 13.3. The DEXA estimated the bone mass at the measure-
ment site as Bone Mineral Content (BMC) in grams. Bone Mineral
Density (BMD) is an aerial measurement and was recorded as
grams per square centimeter. BMC and BMD were measured for the
Whole Body (WB) and the Lumbar Spine (LS). For both sites, the
BMD standard deviation scores (SDS) were calculated. The SDS of
the WB were based on the reference data of the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2008) [38], while the
SDS of the LS were based on reference data from the Bone Mineral
Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) [39]
2.5. Data handling
Patient characteristics including growth, clinical course and intake of
all nutrients via both parenteral nutrition and enteral feeding were re-
corded daily for the first two weeks, and then weekly until week five,
as described previously [35]. The amounts of daily intake of all nutrients

V. Christmann et al. / Bone 108 (2018) 89–97
 were calculated for each patient. From term age onwards the SDS were
calculated for length and BMI using the Dutch reference of the nation-
wide growth study [40,41]. A birth weight below the 10th percentile
of the Dutch reference curves for birth weight by gestational age was
defined as small for gestational age (SGA). A birth weight above the
10th percentile was defined as appropriate for gestational age (AGA)
[42]. Differences in patient characteristics between responders and
non-responders at corrected age of 5 years and at nine to 10 years are
presented in the Supplementary materials. (Table 5a, Table 5b,
Table 6a, Table 6b).
2.6. Statistical analysis
The required sample size was not estimated for the current study
as the study involved the follow-up of surviving children who were
included in the original two cohorts and fulfilled the criteria for stan-
dard follow-up. The average length at each time point was estimated
separately for the 2004 and 2005 cohorts, as well as for the sub-
groups of SGA/AGA at birth and gender within the cohorts. Age relat-
ed differences in growth and bone mineralization were accounted
for by using age and gender specific standard deviation scores. Asso-
ciations between nutritional intake and the outcomes of length SDS,
whole body and lumbar spine BMD and BMD SDS at 9–10 years of age
were examined using multivariable linear regression for all eligible
children and separately for boys and girls. As potential confounders
of cohort, sex, gestational age, birth weight, SGA/AGA status, and
use of corticosteroids at 5 years of age were included as covariates
in the analyses. Models were also conducted for males and females
combined.
Not all children who were eligible for follow-up had data collected at
each time point (Fig. 1). Missing data were handled using multiple im-
putation. We generated 100 imputed datasets using the method of
chained equations. [43]. The imputation model included length at
each time point, BMD and BMD SDS measurements for whole body
and lumbar spine, and the full set of nutrition variables and potential
confounders included in the regression models. All estimates were ob-
tained by averaging results across the 100 imputed datasets with infer-
ences under multiple imputation obtained using Rubin's rules [44].
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata Corp (2015). Stata
Statistical Software: Release 14. StataCorp LP,: College Station, TX and
IBM SPSS statistics, version 22 for Windows (IBM SPSS Inc., IL, USA).
3. Results
3.1. Cohort description
3.1.1. Recruitment
Fig. 1 presents the number of children for whom length could be
measured. Two infants in the 2004 cohort and four infants in the 2005
cohort had died before discharge, while three and nine infants of the re-
spective cohorts did not fulfill the criteria for the follow-up program,
thus 63 and 66 children of 2004 and 2005 respectively were eligible
for the current analysis. Since the national follow up program aimed
at the evaluation of health care and had a more scientific character, par-
ticipation was voluntary, thereby not all parents followed the invitation
and a varying number of children were seen over the time period. At
term corrected age, measurements of length were available for about
half of the participant sample. At the age of five years, 52 (83%) and
54 (82%) children were seen in the 2004 and 2005 cohorts respectively.
Finally, at 9–10 years of age, growth was evaluated for 32 and 30 chil-
dren, and bone mineralization in 31 and 29 children (49 and 43%) of
the 2004 and 2005 cohorts respectively.
3.1.2. Characteristics and morbidity
Table 2 presents the characteristics of the children of both cohorts
seen at 9–10 years of age. The postnatal characteristics of the children
were similar between the cohorts. However, SGA born children of
both cohorts had a higher gestational age at birth and a significantly
lower birth weight compared to their respective AGA group. Cohort
2005 also had a significant higher weight gain during the first five
weeks. With the exception of AGA/SGA status, patient characteristics
of those who responded to the invitation for further follow-up at
9–10 years were similar to those for the full cohort. Comparisons of
the characteristics of responders and non-responders at five years of
age, and at 9–10 years are provided in Tables 5a and 5b and tables 6a
and 6b in the Supplementary materials.
In agreement with the original full sample postnatal cohorts, chil-
dren of Cohort 2005 seen at the follow-up, had received a significant
higher amount of calcium, phosphate, protein and energy during the
first 14 days of life, with a shorter duration of parenteral nutrition, com-
pared to cohort 2004. (Table 2) AGA born children of Cohort 2005 also
had a greater weight gain during the first five weeks of life compared
to children of Cohort 2004, which was significant for the AGA boys,
while all SGA infants demonstrated the highest weight gain [35,45].
Since children of both cohorts differed by one year of age at the last
visit, the mean length and BMI of cohort 2004 were higher. For both
groups the respective SDS were within the normal range for the Dutch
reference population. More than one third of the children in both co-
horts reported bronchial hyper reactivity including the use of medica-
tion, while 22% in Cohort 2004 and 14% Cohort 2005 reported to have
had at least one incident with bone fractures. These incidences and
the use of other medication were similar between both cohorts. None
of the children received growth hormone therapy.

3.2.1. Longitudinal development of length and BMI
Fig. 2 presents the estimation of change in length SDS from TCA until
9–10 years after multiple imputation. Both cohorts were severely
growth retarded by the time they had reached term corrected age
(TCA) (SDS length: estimated mean (95% CI) TCA: Cohort 2004 versus
Cohort 2005: −3.0 (−3.8, −2.2) vs. −3.0 (−3.7, −2.2)). Both cohorts
showed a catch-up in length within the first 6 months with an improve-
ment in mean SDS up to the normal range for the reference population
(SDS length: estimated mean (95% CI) 6 months: Cohort 2004: −0.7

 (−1.1, −0.3) Cohort 2005: −0.5 (−0.8, −0.2)). Children of Cohort
2005 seemed to have slightly improved length SDS compared to Cohort
2004 until the age of two years. This was more pronounced for the
group of children born as AGA and specifically for the AGA girls at five
years. The group of AGA boys of Cohort 2005 showed a decrease in
length SDS from two years onwards and remained below the SDS of
AGA boys of Cohort 2004. The SGA groups did not achieve a normal
length at corrected age of six months but in contrast to AGA children
continuously improved their SDS for length until the end of the observa-
tional period reaching the normal range for the reference population.
BMI developed in the same manner as the length with a major catch-
up during the first six months. There were no differences seen between
both cohorts or among subgroups of AGA and SGA children. For the
group of SGA children SDS BMI developed within the same range as
SDS length with mean lower values.
3.2.2. Bone development
The results of the Whole Body (WB) and Lumbar spine (LS) scan for
the sub-groups of both cohorts are presented in Table 3. Comparing the
total cohorts, the mean bone mineral content (BMC) of both, WB and LS,
tended to be higher for Cohort 2004 (n = 31), which is likely to be relat-
ed to the average younger age and lower weight of Cohort 2005 (n =
29). The mean whole body BMC of Cohort 2004 was on average 90.0 g
higher compared to Cohort 2005 (95% confidence interval (CI): (8.1,
161.8); p-value = 0.015). The mean whole body BMD only differed by
0.032 g/cm2 (95% CI: (0.00, 0.06); p-value = 0.049). The mean lumbar
spine BMC and BMD were only slightly higher for Cohort 2004

 compared to 2005 respectively, with 2.1 g (95% CI: (0.05, 4.3); p-value
= 0.045) and 0.026 g/cm2(95% CI: (−0.02,0.07); p-value = 0.230).
While the differences for the lumbar spine were relatively small, the
more relevant age dependent mean BMD SDS for both measurement
sites were similar between both cohorts and within the normal range
for the reference population (2004 versus 2005: mean WB BMD SDS
0.43 vs. 0.35 (mean diff: 0.08; 95% CI: (−0.43, 0.58); p-value = 0.75);
mean LS BMD SDS −0.036 vs. −0.15 (mean diff: 0.11; 95% CI:
(−0.48, 0.71); p-value = 0.70).
The evaluation of subgroups of children (Table 3) showed that the
lower bone mineral content (WB and LS) of Cohort 2005 was specifical-
ly associated with a lower mean BMC of AGA boys of 2005, while in con-
trast the mean BMC of AGA girls of 2005 nearly attained the same
amount as the respective subgroup of 2004. Thus, of Cohort 2005, girls
had a non-significant higher BMC than boys despite a comparable
body weight. This was also seen for the BMD. The subgroup of SGA
girls was found to have the highest BMC and BMD compared to all
other subgroups.
3.2.3. The effect of early nutrition on length and bone mineralization
Table 4 presents the results of the adjusted associations between nu-
tritional intake during the first 14 days of life, clinical characteristics and
length SDS and BMD and BMD SDS for whole body and lumbar spine,
separately for boys and girls. For the total eligible group, there was
some evidence that birth weight was associated with length, with a
1 g increase associated with 0.001 SDS increase in length (95% CI:
0.0002, 0.002; p-value 0.046), (Table 4a, Supplementary material).
This was mainly based on the association between birth weight and
length for girls with 0.001 SDS increase in length (95% CI: 0.000,
0.003; p-value 0.03). For boys as well as for girls, there was no evidence
of an association between length at nine to 10 years of age and nutri-
tional intake of the first 14 days or any of the potential confounders.
For the total group as well as both sexes, there was no evidence that
mean BMD of the whole body and lumbar spine and BMD SDS was asso-
ciated with nutritional intake or any of the other clinical characteristics
that were measured.
4. Discussion
Our evaluation of two cohorts of VLBW infants suggested that
growth retardation achieved in the postnatal period returned to a nor-
mal range length within the first 6 months. At nine to 10 years the
mean bone mass SDS measured for Whole Body and Lumbar Spine
was within the normal range and seemed not related to nutritional

 intake. Only birth weight appeared to be associated with length at
9–10 years of age for girls.
While a number of previous studies found a decreased length and
bone mass in former preterm infants, both cohorts in our study had
SDS for length, and BMD SDS for whole body and lumbar spine within
the normal range for age [29–31,46]. Several studies pointed at the pos-
itive effect of human milk on bone mineralization despite the low min-
eral content [27,28]. N90% of all infants in both cohorts received own
mother's milk. For Cohort 2004 the use of human milk may have com-
pensated for the low parenteral mineral intake [35].
Although both cohorts had achieved mean SDS for length and BMI
within the normal range for the reference population, this was still
below the initial SDS for weight at birth. Any long-term effect of early
nutrition in our study may be questioned, as in both cohorts a substan-
tial growth retardation was observed by the time infants were
discharged. Besides postnatal illness, this phenomenon can be ex-
plained by the fact that fortification of human milk at levels that were
used N10 years ago did not prevent nutritional deficits. A considerable
number of infants of both cohorts never achieved the recommended en-
teral intake [4,35]. It is possible that further improvement of early post-
natal nutritional intake may have prevented postnatal growth
retardation and consecutively may have led to childhood growth SDS
equivalent to growth at birth.
In contrast to our hypothesis, the significant different nutritional in-
take did not lead to a higher bone mass. The results from the linear re-
gression showed no effect of mineral intake on bone mineralization,
neither for boys nor for girls. The nutritional increment of calcium,
phosphate in combination with more protein may not have been ade-
quate for bone development. Recently, studies demonstrated that high
protein intake may be related to hypophosphatemia indicating an in-
creased need for phosphate supplementation [47,48]. Despite the signif-
icant increased amount of phosphate supplementation, Cohort 2005
had hypophosphatemia during the first week of life [36]. This may
have been the result of an imbalanced nutritional intake of amino
acids and phosphate [49]. On the other hand the mean BMD SDS was
within the normal range of the reference population for both cohorts.
As mentioned above this may have been the positive effect of human
milk, but it may also indicate that preterm infants have the capability
for catch-up for bone mineralization. Follow up studies of a randomized
trial in preterm infants evaluating post-discharge feeding showed that
higher nutritional intake positively affected BMC at six months
corrected age, while this was not maintained until the age of eight
years suggesting a catch up in children who received a lower mineral in-
take in the post-discharge period [34,50].
A varying number of children could not be evaluated at the standard
follow up visits, leading to lower numbers of patients than originally el-
igible and thereby questioning the representativeness of the current
data. Patient characteristics of the responders to follow up at five and
nine to 10 years were comparable to the respective original cohorts
and characteristics of non-responders differed only slightly compared
to responders. We used multiple imputation to reduce the potential
for bias from due to missing data and thus calculated estimates for the
total eligible cohorts (2004: n = 63; 2005: n = 66). This narrowed
the differences between the groups but the results based on analyses
using observed data and those from multiple imputation were generally
consistent. The original postnatal evaluation of growth revealed a signif-
icant higher weight gain until week 5 for AGA infants of Cohort 2005,
mainly based on improved growth in boys [35,45]. The same group of
boys of 2005 seemed to deteriorate with regard to length from two
years of age onwards in contrast to the respective AGA girls and AGA
boys of 2004. This was in contrast to the early reported Dutch follow
up study of VLBW infants where boys showed a significant improved
catch-up between 5 and 10 years compared to girls [51]. The repeated
use of inhaled corticosteroids has been shown to negatively affect linear
growth and bone mineralization [52–54]. Further, an increasing ob-
structive airway disease from childhood into adolescence has been
demonstrated in follow up studies of VLBW infants [55]. While a consid-
erable number of children of both cohorts reported bronchial hyper-
reactivity, for the current study corticosteroid use seemed not to affect
length and bone mineralization. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude ef-
fects of childhood morbidities that were not accounted for in the current
analysis.
The Dutch nationwide prospective study found stunting of SGA chil-
dren at 10 years of age, while a 20 year follow up of SGA preterm born
young adults found lower SDS for height and lumbar spine bone miner-
alization [51,56]. In contrast, our SGA children of both cohorts demon-
strated the highest growth velocity during the first 5 postnatal weeks,
had a lower decline in SDS for weight compared to AGA infants at
TCA, and continuously improved growth with a full catch-up in height
at the last visit at age nine to 10 years [35]. Bone mineral density of
the whole body and lumbar spine were higher than the respective
AGA groups. According to the multivariate regression analysis being
SGA did not significantly affect SDS for length and BMD. It has been sug-
gested that SGA infants are not able to compensate the intra-uterine in-
complete bone mineral accretion in the postnatal period, we speculate
that the first postnatal weeks may represent the critical window for
SGA infants to start the catch-up growth and thereby indicating the
need for sufficiency of nutritional intake directly after birth [57].
This study has several limitations. First, the patients were not ran-
domly assigned to a treatment, but recruited over two consecutive
time periods. However, nutritional protocols and data collection were
standardized, patient characteristics were comparable even for the
follow-up. For the last visit we were unable to invite all children at the
same age which led to age dependent differences in growth and bone
mineralization. We accounted for these differences by using age depen-
dent standard deviation scores for comparisons. The major limitation of
this study was the fact that the power calculation was not performed for
differences in bone development or morbidities in childhood. We tried
to overcome a considerable loss of follow up by evaluating characteris-
tics of responders and non-responders to evaluate the representative-
ness of the children seen at follow up and used the method of
multiple imputation. The latter may even be seen as a strength of this
study since the few recent studies that evaluated long-term bone min-
eralization in former preterm infants mostly evaluated lower numbers
of patients. However, unknown morbidities during the childhood peri-
od and individual lifestyles that were not accounted for may have biased
the results.
5. Conclusions
Children born preterm as appropriate or small for gestational age are
able to catch up in length after the postnatal period, and achieve a nor-
mal length and bone mineralization. An improvement of calcium and
phosphate intake during the first 14 days of life was not associated
with improvement in length and bone development.
