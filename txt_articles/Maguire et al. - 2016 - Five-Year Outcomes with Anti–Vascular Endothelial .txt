Group‡
Abstract
 Purpose—To describe outcomes 5 years after initiation of treatment with bevacizumab or 
ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
 Design—Cohort study..
 Participants—Patients enrolled in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT).
 Methods—Patients were randomly assigned to ranibizumab or bevacizumab and to 1 of 3 
dosing regimens. After 2 years, patients were released from the clinical trial protocol. At 
approximately 5 years, patients were recalled for examination.
 Main Outcome Measures—Visual acuity (VA) and morphologic retinal features.
 Results—VA was obtained for 647 (71%) of 914 living patients with average follow-up time 
5.5 years. The mean number of examinations for AMD care after the clinical trial ended was 25.3, 
and the mean number of treatments in the study eye was 15.4. Most (60%) patients were treated ≥1 
times with a drug other than their randomly assigned drug. At the 5-year visit, 50% of study eyes 
had VA 20/40 or better and 20% had VA 20/200 or worse. Mean change in VA was −3 letters from 
baseline and −11 letters from 2 years. Among 467 eyes with fluorescein angiography, mean total 
lesion area was 12.9 mm2, a mean of 4.8 mm2 larger than at 2 years. Geographic atrophy was 
present in 213 (41%) of 515 gradable eyes and was subfoveal in 85 (17%). Among 555 eyes with

 spectral domain optical coherence tomography, 83% had fluid (61% intraretinal, 38% subretinal, 
and 36% sub-retinal pigment epithelium). Mean foveal total thickness was 278 μm; a decrease of 
182 μm from baseline and 20 μm from 2 years. An abnormally thin retina at the foveal center 
(<120 μm) was present in 36%. Between 2 and 5 years, the group originally assigned to 
ranibizumab for 2 years lost more VA than the bevacizumab group (−4 letters; p=0.008). 
Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in VA or morphological outcomes 
between drug or regimen groups.
 Conclusion—Vision gains during the first 2 years of the trial were not maintained at 5 years. 
However, 50% of eyes had VA 20/40 or better, confirming anti-VEGF therapy as a major long-
term therapeutic advance for neovascular AMD.
Anti- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Currently, nearly all patients 
diagnosed with neovascular AMD are treated with intravitreal administration of drugs that 
target VEGF. In 2005 and 2006, results from Phase III randomized clinical trials showed 
dramatic improvements in visual acuity when eyes with neovascular AMD were treated with 
ranibizumab (Lucentis) compared to sham treatment or photodynamic therapy.1,2 During the 
1-year period between first presentation of results and approval of ranibizumab by the Food 
and Drug Administration, ophthalmologists began treating neovascular AMD patients with 
off-label bevacizumab (Avastin). Despite the absence of evidence of efficacy and safety from 
any randomized clinical trials, use of bevacizumab moved quickly from rescue therapy to 
first-line therapy.3–5 Subsequently, large-scale, multicenter randomized clinical trials of 
ranibizumab and bevacizumab were initiated in the United States and 5 other countries to 
compare safety and effectiveness.6–14 Results from these trials showed that visual acuity 
outcomes at 1 and 2 years were similar between ranibizumab and bevacizumab under several 
different dosing strategies. A recent meta-analysis of all comparative trials yielded 
essentially no difference between drugs in mean change in visual acuity at 1 year 
(bevacizumab-ranibizumab, −0.5 letters, 95% confidence interval [−1.6, 0.6]).15 Results 
from later Phase III clinical trials showed that aflibercept (Eylea) injected every 8 weeks 
provided gains in visual acuity equivalent to those of ranibizumab injected every 4 
weeks.16–17
Although clinical outcomes from the first 1 to 2 years of anti-VEGF treatment have been 
well documented by large-scale clinical trials, relatively few investigators have addressed 
outcomes after 4 or more years.18–24 Longer term outcomes that have been reported vary 
considerably across studies. In addition, the annual number of treatments has been low in 
some reports and only patients who continued regular follow-up and treatment have been 
included in other reports. In this paper, we report the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled 
in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) who returned at approximately 5 
years after initiation of treatment with either ranibizumab or bevacizumab. The clinical trial 
ended after 2 years of follow-up when patients were released from the study protocol. All 
CATT patients who were alive at the end of the clinical trial were targeted for participation 
in the CATT Follow-up Study.

  METHODS
 Design of the CATT Clinical Trial
The design and methods for the clinical trial have been published; therefore, only the key 
features with bearing on this paper are provided.6,7,25,26 Patients enrolled in CATT between 
February 20, 2008 and December 9, 2009. Eligible eyes (one study eye per patient) had 
active choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD, no previous treatment, visual acuity 
between 20/25 and 20/320, and neovascularization, fluid, or hemorrhage under the foveal 
center. Patients were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 treatment groups defined by drug 
(ranibizumab or bevacizumab) and by dosing regimen (monthly or as-needed [PRN]). At 
one year, patients initially assigned to monthly treatment were re-assigned randomly to 
either monthly or PRN treatment (“switched regimen group”). A volume of 0.05 ml 
containing either 0.50 mg ranibizumab or 1.25 mg bevacizumab was used for intravitreal 
injection. Patients on the PRN dosing regimen were evaluated for treatment every 4 weeks 
and treated when fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT), new or persistent 
hemorrhage, decreased visual acuity relative to the previous visit, or dye leakage on 
fluorescein angiography was present. All patients were scheduled for follow-up visits every 
4 weeks through 104 weeks. Patients were released from their assigned treatment groups 
during the visit at 104 weeks; at that visit and thereafter, all treatments were administered 
according to best medical judgment. The study was registered (NCT00593450) on http:/
www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 Follow-up Methods
All patients who enrolled in the clinical trial, except for those known to be dead at 2 years, 
were targeted for participation in the Follow-up Study. Clinical coordinators attempted to 
contact patients and schedule an appointment for them to be seen in a CATT clinical center 
between March 14, 2014 and March 31, 2015. Patients completing a visit in a CATT clinical 
center signed a consent statement for the follow-up visit and signed a medical records 
release form if they had received care for AMD from outside the CATT clinical center. 
Patients were interviewed about treatment to either eye, visits to ophthalmologists, and 
serious medical events since their last visit in the clinical trial. Returning patients had a 
dilated eye examination, refraction and visual acuity measurement, spectral domain OCT, 
fundus color stereophotography and fluorescein angiography. All examinations were 
performed by study-certified personnel following the same protocols used during the clinical 
trial. Some patients who did not complete a visit in a CATT clinical center were willing to 
complete an interview about past care, treatment, and serious medical events and/or signed a 
medical records release form. Information on treatment, visual acuity, and imaging was 
requested from the outside ophthalmologists who provided AMD care for these patients. The 
institutional review board associated with each of the participating CATT centers reviewed 
and approved the Follow-Up study protocol and consent forms. The study was performed in 
compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and adhered to the 
tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
When patients were unable or refused to participate, could not be contacted, or were 
identified as deceased, clinical coordinators submitted patient status forms to the CATT

 Coordinating Center. After the end of the recruitment period, information on patients whose 
life status could not be verified and on patients reported as deceased, but without 
confirmation of the cause of death, was submitted to the National Death Index. When a 
match was identified (≥99% chance of being correct), the date and cause of death were 
returned to the CATT Coordinating Center for use in data analysis.
 Ascertainment of History of Patient Care and Treatment
Medical records from the CATT clinical center were abstracted for the date of each visit for 
AMD care at the center after the clinical trial ended, dates of treatment for either eye, and 
type of treatment administered (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, pegaptanib 
(Macugen), triamcinolone, photodynamic therapy, thermal laser, and any other treatment). 
When patients reported care from outside of the CATT center and signed a medical records 
release form, the same information was requested from each ophthalmologist who provided 
AMD care for the patient.
 Data and Statistical Analysis
Only patients with a visual acuity measurement between 51 months (4.3 years) and 85 
months (7.1 years) after the date of treatment assignment in the clinical trial were included 
in the data analyses, tables, and graphs on outcomes presented in this paper. The limits of the 
interval represent the minimum and maximum times between the enrollment period for the 
clinical trial and the enrollment period for the Follow-up Study. Differences in outcomes 
between drugs and among dosing regimens were assessed with analysis of variance for 
continuous outcome measures and chi-square tests for categorical outcome measures. 
Retinal thickness was classified as above (>212μ) or below (<120μ) 2 standard deviations 
from the mean of normal eyes.27 Serious medical events were coded according to the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system and further classified as 
arteriothrombotic and as previously associated with drugs affecting the VEGF pathway 
(arteriothrombotic events, systemic hemorrhage, congestive heart failure, venous thrombotic 
events, hypertension, vascular death).28–30 Investigators from 3 of the 43 CATT clinical 
centers chose not to participate in the Follow-up Study; the 27 patients from these centers 
were considered non-participants and excluded from the analyses on serious medical events. 
Statistical computations were performed with SAS 9.4.
 RESULTS
 Patients
Among the 1117 patients alive at the end of the clinical trial (end of Year 2), 203 (18.2%) 
died before the end of the Follow-up Study. Of the remaining 914 patients, 647 (70.8%) had 
a visual acuity measurement in the required time interval of 51 months (4.3 years) to 85 
months (7.1 years) after assignment of treatment in the clinical trial. The mean (SD) time 
interval between enrollment in the clinical trial and the Follow-up Study visit was 66.5 (6.7) 
months (5.5 years). The percentage of patients with a visual acuity measurement was similar 
across the 6 drug-dosing regimen groups, ranging from 68.3% to 75.0%. Most (85.5%) of 
the visual acuity information was obtained by examination at a CATT clinical center by a 
certified examiner. Three CATT centers responsible for 27 (3.0%) patients did not

 participate in the Follow-up Study. Forty-one patients (4.5%) agreed to be interviewed but 
had no visual acuity information available, 102 (11.1%) declined participation, 93 (10.2%) 
could not be contacted, and 4 (0.4%) could not provide informed consent because of 
dementia or the absence of a consent statement in their native language.
The characteristics at baseline and at 2 years of the patients who participated in the Follow-
up Study are displayed in Table 1, along with characteristics of those who did not participate 
and those who died after their 2-year visit. Non-participants had a mean age 2.3 years older 
(p<0.001) and a mean baseline visual acuity score 3.1 letters worse than participants 
(p=0.001). At 2 years, non-participants had a mean visual acuity 5.4 letters worse (p<0.001) 
than participants. Among patients assigned treatment PRN for 2 years, non-participants had 
a mean 1.8 fewer injections (p=0.01). Patients who died after 2 years were on average 5.6 
years older than participants and had worse mean visual acuity both at baseline (−4.1 letters) 
and 2 years (−7.9 letters). Baseline ocular characteristics were similar among these 3 groups 
of patients.
 Care and Treatment after Release from the Clinical Trial Protocol
Most (591 [91.3%]) of the 647 Follow-up Study patients continued care at a CATT center 
after release from the clinical trial; however, 51 (7.9%) were seen also or seen exclusively by 
non-study ophthalmologists, and 5 (0.8%) received no eye care. Records were obtained for 
49 (96%) of the 51 patients seen by non-study ophthalmologists. The mean (SD) number of 
visits for AMD care between the end of the clinical trial and the Follow-up Study visit was 
25.3 (13.3); with 8.0 (4.0) in Year 3, 7.2 (4.0) in Year 4, and 6.5 (4.0) in Year 5. The mean 
(SD) number of treatments was 15.4 (12.5) with 4.8 (4.0) in Year 3, 4.5 (3.8) in Year 4, and 
4.0 (3.6) in Year 5. The most recent treatment in the study eye before the Follow-up Study 
visit was within 3 months for 360 (55.6%) patients. There were 96 (14.8%) patients who had 
no treatments between the end of the clinical trial and the Follow-up Study visit, with a 
mean (SD) of 12.5 (8.4) visits. Among these 96 patients, 21 (48.8%) of 43 patients treated 
PRN in Year 2 of the clinical trial received no treatment during Year 2.
After release from the clinical trial protocol, more than half of the patients received a 
treatment other than the drug assigned to them in the clinical trial. Among the 328 patients 
assigned to ranibizumab, 46 (14.0%) had no treatments, 64 (19.5%) had treatments with 
only ranibizumab, and 218 (66.5%) had at least 1 other type of treatment (Table 2). Among 
the 319 patients assigned bevacizumab, 50 (15.7%) had no treatments, 99 (31.0%) had 
treatments with only bevacizumab, and 170 (53.3%) had at least 1 other type of treatment.
 Visual Acuity
Approximately half (321 [49.6%]) of the 647 Follow-up Study patients had visual acuity 
20/40 or better at approximately 5 years (Table 3). The percentage of eyes with visual acuity 
20/200 or worse was 5% to 6% at baseline through 2 years and increased to 20% by the 
Follow-up Study visit (Figure 1). The mean (SD) visual acuity score was 58.9 [20/63] (24.1) 
letters (Figure 2A). The mean (SD) change from Year 2 was −10.8 (18.9) letters and the 
mean change from baseline was −3.3 (22.3) letters. Mean visual acuity was similar among 
eyes assigned to ranibizumab (57.7 letters) and eyes assigned to bevacizumab (60.2 letters;

 p=0.19) throughout the first 2 years in the clinical trial. Relative to the mean visual acuity at 
2 years, eyes assigned to ranibizumab had lost more letters at the Follow-up Study visit 
(−12.7) than eyes assigned to bevacizumab (−8.8; p=0.008) (Figure 2A). There were no 
statistically significant differences in these vision outcomes among eyes assigned to the 
different dosing regimens (Table 4 [available at http://www.aaojournal.org] ; Figure 2B).
 Morphologic Outcomes from OCT
Spectral domain OCT scans were available for 555 (85.8%) of the Follow-up Study patients 
(Table 3). The mean (SD) total thickness at the foveal center was 278 (160) μm 
corresponding to a mean change from 2 years of −20 (132) μm (Table 3) and a mean change 
of −182 (209) μm from baseline (Figure 3A). Neurosensory retinal thickness was less than 
120 μm in 201 (36.2%) eyes, an increased percentage from 22% at 2 years (Figure 4). 
Retinal thickness was greater than 212 μm in 62 (11.2%) eyes, similar to the percentage 
(14%) at 2 years. Intraretinal, subretinal, or sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid was present 
in 458 (83.0%) of 552 gradable eyes (Figure 5). Although the percentages with subretinal 
fluid (37.7%) and sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid (36.2%) at 5 years were similar to the 
percentages at Year 2, the percentage with intraretinal fluid (61.0%) was greater than at Year 
2 (50%). There were no statistically significant differences in these spectral domain OCT 
features between eyes assigned to ranibizumab and bevacizumab in the clinical trial or 
among eyes assigned to the different dosing regimens (Table 3 and 4 [available at http://
www.aaojournal.org], Figures 3A and 3B).
 Morphologic Outcomes from Fundus Photography and Angiography
Fundus photographs were available for 527 (81.4%) of the Follow-up Study patients and 
fluorescein angiograms were available for 467 (72.2%; Table 3). Fluorescein leakage was 
detected in 111 (24.5%) eyes. The mean area of the total neovascular lesion was 12.9 (11.4) 
mm2, an increase of 4.8 (8.8) mm2 from 2 years. Geographic atrophy was present in 213 
eyes (41.4%), and was subfoveal in 85 (16.5%). Fibrotic scar was present in the foveal 
center in 93 (19.6%) of eyes and non-fibrotic scar in an additional 26 (5.5%) among 474 
gradable eyes. The mean area of the total neovascular lesion was 2 mm2 greater in eyes 
assigned to ranibizumab in the clinical trial than in eyes assigned to bevacizumab (13.9 vs 
11.9 mm2); however, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Percentages of 
eyes with fluorescein leakage and with geographic atrophy were similar between eyes 
assigned to ranibizumab and eyes assigned to bevacizumab. There were no statistically 
significant differences in these features on fundus photography and angiography among eyes 
assigned to the different dosing regimens (Table 4 [available at http://www.aaojournal.org]).
 Safety Data
Deaths and serious medical events occurring after 2 years are displayed in Table 5. There 
were 203 (18.6%) of 1090 patients who survived to 2 years but died before a Follow-up 
Study visit. Among 555 patients originally assigned to ranibizumab, 42 (7.6%) had an 
arteriothrombotic event compared with 24 (4.5%) of patients originally assigned to 
bevacizumab (p=0.04). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in the 
type of serious medical events between drug or dosing regimen groups (Table 6 [available at 
http://www.aaojournal.org]).

  DISCUSSION
The randomized clinical trials that established the efficacy of ranibizumab, bevacizumab, 
and aflibercept demonstrated that anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD improved visual 
acuity on average by 1 to 2 lines through 2 years.1,2,6–14,16,17 The CATT Follow-up Study 
provides long-term follow-up (mean 5.5 years) on 70.8% of survivors. Mean visual acuity 
declined to 3 letters worse than at baseline and 11 letters worse than at the 2 years. This 
decrease in vision was accompanied by expansion of the size of the total neovascular 
complex composed of neovascularization, scarring, and atrophy and by persistence of fluid 
on OCT. Despite these morphologic changes, 50% of CATT Follow-up Study patients had a 
visual acuity 20/40 or better, while only 20% had visual acuity 20/200 or worse. These 
results emphasize both the tremendous advances over the past 15 years in preserving vision 
for a large proportion of patients as well as the limitations of current treatment.
The characteristics of the CATT patients who returned for the Follow-up Study are 
important to interpret the 5-year results. Overall, 71% of living patients from the original 
clinical trial population returned. On average, these patients were 2 years younger, had 
visual acuity that was 3 letters better at baseline, and had visual acuity that was 5 letters 
better at 2 years than patients who did not return. Study eyes received an average of 15.4 
injections after release from the clinical trial protocol and most received regular care by their 
CATT ophthalmologist, even if not receiving frequent treatment. Among the group not 
returning were patients who dropped out of the clinical trial, were too ill to participate, 
moved out of the area, or refused to return. Thus, the Follow-up Study results are likely 
better than would have been observed if 100% of CATT patients had returned. In addition, 
some of the Follow-up Study participants did not have an OCT scan (14%), color 
photographs (19%), or a fluorescein angiogram (28%), eroding the generalizability of the 
Follow-up Study results on morphological outcomes.
Similarly, the long-term outcomes of patients treated with anti-VEGF drugs reported from 
other studies (discussed below) are likely better than if all patients originally identified had 
been observed. The magnitude of the overestimation is related to the degree of selection of 
patients for study and the percentage of patients lost to follow-up. In the only other extended 
follow-up study of patients enrolled in a key randomized clinical trial for an anti-VEGF 
drug, participants were eligible for the HORIZON study only if their ophthalmologist 
believed that further treatment with ranibizumab beyond the 2-year clinical trial period 
would be beneficial.19 Comparison of participants to non-participants in this cohort showed 
that visual acuity and lesion characteristics were better for participants, and only 388 (65%) 
of these selected 600 participants had 4-year follow-up. Several large-scale retrospective or 
registry studies have reported 4- and 5-year outcomes, but as demonstrated in a retrospective 
review of patients in Australia, patients who stop returning for care often do so soon after 
losing vision, so that patients with better vision are over-represented in these studies.18,20–24
The CATT Follow-up Study finding of 50% of patients with VA of 20/40 or better at 5 years 
and nearly 10% with VA 20/20 or better is remarkable when one considers the visual acuity 
outcomes in neovascular AMD prior to the to the development of anti-VEGF treatment. Two 
years after diagnosis, fewer than 10% of patients retained vision of 20/40 or better with no

 treatment and fewer than 15% of patients treated with photodynamic therapy retained 20/40 
or better.31–33 Visual acuity decreased to 20/200 or worse at 2 years in 45% to 75% of 
patients with no treatment and in 30% to 40% with photodynamic therapy, compared to 20% 
at 5 years in the CATT Follow-up Study.
In CATT and all randomized clinical trials of anti-VEGF treatment for neovascular AMD, 
most of the improvement in mean visual acuity from baseline occurred within the first 3 to 6 
months with little erosion of the benefit through 2 years when a fixed schedule of monthly 
(ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept) or bi-monthly (aflibercept) treatment was 
maintained.1,7,9,17,34 In CATT, patients who switched at 1 year from a monthly to a PRN 
dosing regimen received 5 to 6 injections on average and experienced a mean visual acuity 
decrease of 2 to 3 letters over the second year.7 During the 3.5 year period after release from 
the CATT protocol, patients received 4 to 5 injections per year on average and the mean 
visual acuity decreased an additional 11 letters to 59 letters (20/63). Similarly, in 
HORIZON, mean visual acuity declined by 7 letters to 20/80 with total 4 injections on 
average during the 2 years following exit from the formal clinical trials.19 In the Australian 
retrospective review, the mean number of injections over 5 years was 25 with mean visual 
acuity decreasing to 20/63.20 In contrast, the mean number of injections was 11 over 5 years 
in the Pan-American Study and the mean visual acuity at 5 years was 20/250.18 Thus, more 
frequent treatment, both in the initial 2 years and in later years appears associated with better 
long-term outcomes, and many patients require treatment through 5 years and beyond. This 
observation is in distinct contrast to the experience of treating diabetic macular edema with 
anti-VEGF therapy where the majority of patients do not require treatment beyond 3 years. 
In Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Protocol I clinical trial, a mean of 8 or 9 
injections were given in Year 1, decreasing to 2 or 3 in Year 2, to 1 or 2 in Year 3, and to 0 or 
1 in Year 4, depending on treatment assignment.35
The processes responsible for the decrease in vision in CATT and other studies are multiple 
but appear to be related to an increase in the proportion patients with an abnormally thin 
retina (<120 microns), an increase in prevalence of geographic atrophy, and a substantial 
increase in lesion size. We previously reported that retinal thinning to <120 microns was 
associated with worse VA outcomes at 1 and 2 years.36,37 The proportion of eyes with an 
abnormally thin retina increased from 22% at the end of Year 2 to 36% at 5 years.37 We also 
previously reported that the proportion of eyes with geographic atrophy was 20% at 2 years 
and this proportion increased to 41% at 5 years, with an increase in subfoveal geographic 
atrophy from 6% to 17%.7,37 Worse VA outcomes have also been associated with increased 
lesion size, and in the Follow-up Study, mean lesion size increased more than 50% over the 
3.5 year period (Table 3). These data highlight the need for agents that can prevent or 
minimize geographic atrophy and expansion of the total neovascular lesion.
The specific contribution of persistent fluid to long-term vision loss is unclear. The 
proportion of eyes with fluid decreased the most during the first year of treatment, but 
remained relatively unchanged throughout the remaining 4 years of follow up. More than 
70% of eyes demonstrated intraretinal, subretinal, or sub-RPE fluid as determined by the 
OCT Reading Center throughout the study (Figure 5). Since the elimination of fluid is the 
primary goal at most treatment visits and almost no patients received treatment at every visit,

 it is reasonable to assume that the amount of fluid was frequently small and not detected by 
the ophthalmologist or was tolerated because of stable vision. On a cross-sectional basis, the 
presence of intraretinal fluid is associated with worse visual acuity during anti-VEGF 
treatment while the presence of subretinal fluid is associated with better visual acuity.36–38 
Further studies to quantify the amount and location of residual fluid and to assess their 
impact on visual acuity are warranted.
During CATT, both the use of ranibizumab and monthly treatment were associated with an 
increased rate of development of geographic atrophy. At the end of Year 2, eyes treated with 
ranibizumab had a higher incidence (21%) of geographic atrophy than eyes treated with 
bevacizumab (17%; p=0.02).7 However, in the IVAN study, the incidence was similar in eyes 
treated with ranibizumab (28%) and with bevacizumab (31%; p=0.46), decreasing the 
likelihood of a true effect of ranibizumab on development of geographic atrophy.9 The 
association of monthly treatment with an increased rate of development of geographic 
atrophy was more consistent. At the end of Year 2 of CATT, eyes that received monthly 
treatment were more likely to have developed geographic atrophy than those treated with 
PRN therapy (24% vs 15%, p=0.003).7 In the IVAN study, 34% of eyes that received 
continuous (monthly) treatment developed geographic atrophy as compared with 26% in the 
discontinuous (PRN) group (p=0.03).9 In the HARBOR trial, eyes that received monthly 
ranibizumab had a higher incidence of geographic atrophy when compared with PRN 
treatment (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7).29 After release from the clinical trial at 2 years, very 
few patients continued monthly treatment and most were treated with at least 1 additional 
anti-VEGF drug that was different from their original treatment assignment. When 
examining the 5-year data for evidence of a residual drug or dosing effect on the 
development of geographic atrophy, there was still a higher proportion (44%) of eyes 
originally assigned to ranibizumab with geographic atrophy than eyes assigned to 
bevacizumab (38%), and a higher proportion (47%) of eyes assigned to monthly treatment 
for 2 years with geographic atrophy than eyes assigned to PRN treatment (40%). However, 
these differences were not statistically significant.
Although few patients remained on their originally assigned drug and dosing regimen 
beyond the 2-year period of the clinical trial, our study does allow assessment as to whether 
or not the drugs and dosing regimens used during the first 2 years led to any detectable 
outcome differences at 5 years. At the end of 2 years of treatment in the clinical trial, mean 
VA was 70 letters (20/40) and there was no statistically significant difference in mean visual 
acuity between eyes originally assigned to ranibizumab and eyes originally assigned to 
bevacizumab. Over the next 3.5 years of follow-up, patients originally assigned to 
ranibizumab lost more vision (−13 letters) than those originally assigned to bevacizumab (−9 
letters; p=0.008; Figure 2A). The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is clear that 2 
years of initial therapy with bevacizumab and the accompanying lesser degree of reduction 
in fluid and retinal thickness did not compromise long-term visual acuity outcomes relative 
to ranibizumab, as some had speculated. There were no obvious differences in visual acuity 
outcomes at 5 years between patients who were treated monthly for 2 years versus those 
treated PRN for 2 years.

 With most patients changing drugs over time, the ability to identify differential safety effects 
of the 2 drugs is compromised. During the period between the end of the clinical trial and 
the Follow-up Study visit, more patients originally assigned to ranibizumab had 
arteriothrombotic events than patients assigned to bevacizumab (7.6% versus 4.5%; p=0.04). 
However, during the 2 years of the clinical trial, the proportion of patient with these events 
was nearly equal with 4.7% of ranibizumab-treated patients and 5.0% of bevacizumab-
treated patients having an event (p=0.62). Because of the absence of any difference when the 
history of drug exposure was certain we do not believe that the difference in events observed 
when a large portion of patients were not receiving ranibizumab are meaningful. Otherwise, 
we did not identify any statistically significant differences between groups based on the 
initially assigned drugs with respect to death or serious medical events. Overall concerns 
about the relative safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab when treating patients with 
neovascular AMD have largely been assuaged by the results of 2 Cochrane comprehensive 
meta-analyses clinical trials comparing ranibizumab and bevacizumab.15,40
In summary, the CATT Follow-up Study provides the most complete follow up reported to 
date on the long-term outcomes for the treatment of neovascular AMD with anti-VEGF 
drugs. The original trial was designed to assess differences between ranibizumab and 
bevacizumab as well as differences between monthly and PRN dosing. Because very few 
patients remained on their originally assigned drug or dosing schedule between the end of 
year 2 and follow-up at approximately 5 years, the CATT Follow-up study results provide 
information primarily on overall treatment outcomes with anti-VEGF drugs and limited 
information on effects of different drugs and dosing regimens. Mean visual acuity at 5 years 
was 3 letters worse than baseline, highlighting an unmet need for further therapeutic 
advances. Still, 50% of patients were 20/40 or better and almost 10% were 20/20. These 
results would have been unimaginable in the era prior to the availability of anti-VEGF 
therapy.
