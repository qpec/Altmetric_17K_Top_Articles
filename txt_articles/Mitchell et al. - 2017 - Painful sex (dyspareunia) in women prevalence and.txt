Objective To estimate the prevalence of painful sex among
women in Britain, and to explore associated sexual, relationship
and health factors that should be considered in assessment.
Design Multi-stage, clustered and stratified population probability
sample survey, using computer-assisted self-interview. Sample
frame was the British Postcode Address File.
Setting Participants interviewed at home between 2010 and 2012.
Sample A total of 15 162 adults aged 16–74 years (8869 women).
Data reported from 6669 sexually active women.
Methods Age-adjusted logistic regressions to examine associations
between painful sex and indicators of sexual, relational, mental
and physical health.
Main outcome measure Physical pain as a result of sex for
≥3 months in the past year, plus measures of symptom severity.
Results Painful sex was reported by 7.5% (95% CI 6.7–8.3) of
sexually active women, of whom one-quarter experienced
symptoms very often or always, for ≥6 months, and causing
distress. Reporting painful sex was strongly associated with other
sexual function problems, notably vaginal dryness (age adjusted
odds ratio 7.9; 6.17–10.12), anxiety about sex (6.34; 4.76–8.46)
and lacking enjoyment in sex (6.12; 4.81–7.79). It was associated
with sexual relationship factors [such as not sharing same level of
interest in sex (2.56; 1.97–3.33)], as well as with adverse
experiences such as non-volitional sex (2.17; 1.68–2.80).
Associations were also found with measures of psychological and
physical health, including depressive symptoms (1.68; 1.28–2.21).
Conclusion Painful sex is reported by a sizeable minority of
women in Britain. Health professionals should be supported to
undertake holistic assessment and treatment which takes account
of the sexual, relationship and health context of symptoms.

Introduction
Painful sex (dyspareunia) is a common but neglected female
health problem.1 The population prevalence is estimated to
vary from 3 to 18% globally,2 and lifetime estimates range
from 10 to 28%.3 Wide ranges reflect significant hetero-
geneity in methodologies of prevalence studies.4 The under-
lying conditions are often difficult to diagnose and treat,2,5,6
and the aetiological factors are complex, and poorly under-
stood. Partly because of this, sexual pain disorders are often

 overlooked or badly managed, significantly exacerbating
patient distress.7 There are many potential causes, and
efforts to understand and characterise the problem are ham-
pered by classificatory challenges1,8 and scant empirical evi-
dence.9 Subtyping into deep (pain felt within pelvis) and
superficial (pain felt in vulval area) is common,9 but may
undermine attempts to treat the experience of pain holisti-
cally. In the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders10 dyspareunia and
vaginismus (involuntary spasm of musculature of the
vagina) were deleted, and a new diagnosis of Genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder was introduced.
Dyspareunia is a common and troubling complaint of
women
with
vulvodynia,
and
in
particular
provoked
vestibulodynia. Painful sex can also result from a range of
conditions causing genital pain, including vulval skin con-
ditions (e.g. lichen sclerosus), vulvovaginal and urinary
tract infections, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
endometriosis.11 Dyspareunia is often co-morbid with sex-
ual difficulties such as lack of desire and arousal,12 and
strain within the sexual relationship.13 Psychosocial corre-
lates include negative body image, catastrophising, hyper-
vigilance to pain, depression and anxiety, and low self-
esteem.12,14–16 Although these psychosocial variables may
be both aetiological and sequelae, the cross-sectional nature
of most studies limits understanding of causal direction.8
To date, most research on painful sex has been based on
small clinical samples.5,12 These studies exclude women who
have not sought help3 and are therefore not representative of
the general population. Community surveys are limited,5,17
as are studies that investigate medical and psychosocial fac-
tors simultaneously. Specific subgroups, such as adolescent
women, have also received little focused research attention.18
The objective of this study is to estimate the population
prevalence of painful sex in women and to address the gap in
data describing the health, relationship and sexual context in
which painful sex is experienced. To do this we use data from
the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles;
a large probability survey undertaken in Britain.
Methods
Participants and procedure
We present data from women aged 16–74 years who par-
ticipated in Natsal-3, a multi-stage, clustered, stratified
probability sample survey of 15 162 adults (8869 women)
in Britain, interviewed between September 2010 and August
2012. This paper is focused on sexually active women,
defined as those reporting vaginal, oral or anal sex with
one or more partners of either gender in the past year. We
also report briefly on sexually inactive women, defined as
having sexual experience, but no sex in the past year (small
numbers precluded detailed analysis of this group).
Participants were interviewed at home using a combi-
nation of computer-assisted face-to-face and self-interview
for the more sensitive questions. The survey instrument
underwent
thorough
cognitive
testing
and
piloting.19
After weighting to adjust for unequal probabilities of
selection, the Natsal-3 sample was broadly representative
of the British population as described by 2011 Census
figures.20
The estimated response rate for Natsal-3 was 57.7%,
and the co-operation rate was 65.8% (of all eligible
addresses contacted). Details of the survey methodology
are published elsewhere.20,21 Natsal-3 was approved by the
NRES Committee South Central—Oxford A (Ref: 10/
H0604/27). Participants provided oral informed consent
for interviews.
Measures
Women who were sexually active in the last year were asked
whether they had experienced any of a list of eight difficul-
ties with their sex life lasting ≥3 months in the past year,
including ‘felt physical pain, as a result of sex’ (painful sex).
(The eight difficulties were: lacked interest in sex, lacked
enjoyment in sex, felt anxious during sex, felt physical pain
as a result of sex, felt no excitement or arousal during sex,
did not reach a climax or took a long time to reach a climax
despite feeling excited or aroused, reached climax more
quickly than you would like, and had an uncomfortably dry
vagina.) Women reporting painful sex were asked how long
they had experienced this, how often symptoms occurred,
and how they felt about it. ‘Morbid pain’ was defined as
symptoms experienced for ≥6 months, symptoms occurring
very often or always, and participant fairly or very distressed
about the difficulty (morbid painful sex). Women who had
ever had a sexual experience, but were not sexually active in
the last year were asked if they had avoided sex because of
sexual difficulties (either their own or those of their part-
ner). Those who answered yes were asked to indicate the
reasons, with options including ‘felt physical pain, or feared
feeling physical pain, as a result of sex’.
Among sexually active women, we tested for associations
between reporting painful sex and a range of explanatory
variables, selected to reflect the health, relationship and
sexual context of women’s lives and to identify factors
potentially relevant to clinical assessment and management.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were carried out using the complex survey func-
tions of STATA (version 14; StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX, USA) to account for the weighting, clustering and strati-
fication of the data. We present descriptive statistics for
reporting of painful sex and morbid painful sex. We used
age-adjusted logistic regressions to examine the associations
between reporting physical pain during sex and other sexual

 function problems, demographic and health factors, sexual
behaviour, sexual relationship and attitudes to sex. We per-
formed a sensitivity analysis to check whether the observed
associations differed according to age (16–44 years age
group versus 45–74 years). Few differences were observed, so
we did not present the results stratified by age.
Results
Prevalence of painful sex and morbid painful sex
Table 1 shows the prevalence of reporting painful sex and
morbid painful sex by age group. Among sexually active
women aged 16–74 years, 7.5% (95% CI 6.7–8.3) reported
painful sex; 4.6% (4.1–5.3) reported symptoms lasting
≥6 months, of whom around half were distressed about
their symptoms. <2% (1.9%; 1.5–2.3) of all sexually active
women reported morbid painful sex (i.e. met all three mor-
bidity criteria). The proportion reporting painful sex was
highest in the youngest women (16–24 years) and those
aged 55–64 years, whereas morbid pain was highest (3.9%)
in this latter age group.
Among women aged 16–74 years, 1505 were not sexually
active in the last year and answered the item on avoidance
of sex because of sexual difficulties. Of these, 211 (17.23%)
reported avoiding sex, with 35 reporting pain, or fear of
feeling pain, as a reason for avoidance (2.49% of all sexu-
ally inactive women). [Correction added on 7 April 2017,
after first online publication: The number of non-sexually
active participants has been changed from 1708 to 1505,
and therefore the percentage calculations have been cor-
rected in the preceeding sentence.]
Association of painful sex with sexual function
problems and sexual satisfaction
Many women reporting painful sex also reported another
sexual function problem (Table 2): 62.0% reported lack of
interest in sex (compared with 31.9% of women with no
pain), 45.2% reported vaginal dryness (compared with
10.4%), 40.2% reported difficulty reaching climax (com-
pared with 14.4%), and 40.1% reported lacking enjoyment
(compared with 9.9%). Painful sex was strongly associated
with all the sexual function problems we measured, and in
particular, with vaginal dryness [age adjusted odds ratio
(aOR) 7.9; 95% CI 6.17–10.12], feeling anxious during sex
(aOR 6.34; 95% CI 4.76–8.46) and lacking enjoyment in
sex (aOR 6.12; 95% CI 4.81–7.79).
Just under a third of women reporting painful sex said
they were dissatisfied with their sex life (30.9%; compared
with 10.1% of women not reporting painful sex; aOR 4.00;
95% CI 3.09–5.16) and 28.9% said they were distressed or
worried about their sex life (compared with 9.2% of
women not reporting painful sex; aOR 4.02; 95% CI 3.11–
5.21). Women reporting painful sex were much more likely
to say that they had avoided sex in the past year because of
sexual difficulties (own or those of partner) (44.9 versus
10.7% of those not reporting pain; aOR 7.22; 95% CI
5.66–9.20).
Association of painful sex with socio-demographic,
general health, and sexual lifestyles and attitudes
Table 3 shows associations between reporting painful sex
(lasting ≥3 months) and selected socio-demographic and
health factors. After adjusting for age, reporting painful sex

Painful sex among women in Britain
 was associated with higher educational attainment (aOR
for further academic qualifications versus none 2.10; 1.39–
3.16), and with being retired (aOR for retired versus full-
time employed 1.79; 1.10–2.90).
We found strong associations between reporting painful
sex and poor health, including overall self-reported health
status (aOR for bad/very bad health versus good/very good
2.37; 1.45–3.89), reporting two or more chronic health
conditions (aOR 2.31; 1.69–3.15) and depressive symptoms
(aOR 1.68; 1.28–2.21). Reporting painful sex was also posi-
tively associated with menopausal status (aOR 3.20; 2.05–
5.00).
Table 4 shows associations between reporting painful sex
(≥3 months) and selected sexual behaviour, relationship and
attitudinal factors. In relation to other aspects of sexual
health, experiencing painful sex was associated with feeling
like one ought to have known more about sexual matters at
first sexual experience (aOR 1.81; 1.36–2.42), and with key
adverse sexual health outcomes, specifically reporting an STI
diagnosis in the past 5 years (aOR 1.85; 1.27–2.68) and pre-
vious experience of non-volitional sex (aOR 2.17; 1.68–2.80).
We found no association with frequency of intercourse
(Table 4), or with number of partners reported in the last
year (data not shown).
We did not find associations with relationship status,
relationship duration or general happiness with the rela-
tionship (data not shown). However, reporting painful sex
was strongly associated with sexual aspects of the relation-
ship; including not sharing the same level of interest in sex
(aOR 2.56; 1.97–3.33), not sharing the same sexual likes
and dislikes (aOR 2.35; 1.59–3.47), and partner having a
sexual difficulty (aOR 1.48; 1.06–2.06).
Finally, we found strong associations between reporting
painful sex and finding it difficult to talk about sex with
partners (aOR for easy versus not always easy 1.54;
1.18–2.02), as well as agreement with the statement that men
have a higher sex drive than women (aOR 1.35; 1.09–1.67).
Discussion
Main findings
Painful sex lasting ≥3 months in the last year is not
uncommon; it is reported by 7.5% of women, of whom
one-quarter
(i.e.
1.9%
of
all
sexually
active
women)
report
morbid
painful
sex
(symptoms
occurring
very
often or always, symptoms experienced for ≥6 months
and fairly or very distressed about the difficulty). The
proportion reporting painful sex is highest in young
women (16–24 years) and those in later mid-life (55–
64 years), although there was no significant trend with
age. Reporting painful sex was strongly associated with
experiencing
other
sexual
function
problems,
notably
vaginal dryness, anxiety and lack of enjoyment of sex.
The experience of pain was also associated with other
aspects of sexual function (including distress and dissatis-
faction with sex life, and sexual relationship factors), as
well as with adverse sexual experiences such as STI diag-
nosis and non-volitional sex, and with indicators of men-
tal and physical health.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of our study is that it is based on a large
national probability sample with a wide age range.20,21 We
achieved a response rate in line with other major social

 surveys in Britain22 and higher than many other popula-
tion prevalence studies of sexual function.23,24 A limitation
is that our measurement of pain was based on a single
item, rather than on clinical diagnosis; however, obtaining
clinically sufficient information is rarely possible in gen-
eral
population
surveys,25
and
would
be
particularly
challenging here given the lack of consensus on aetiology
and classification. Nonetheless, it is worth bearing in
mind that the causes of painful sex included in our sam-
ple may be wide ranging. It is likely that we have slightly
underestimated the prevalence of painful sex because our
figures include only sexually active women; of women

Painful sex among women in Britain
 who were ever sexually active but not in the last year,
2.49% said they had avoided sex because of pain, or fear
of feeling pain. [Correction added on 7 April 2017, after
first online publication: The percentage calculation has
been corrected from 2.05% to 2.49% in the preceding
sentence due to a mistake in the calculation in the
denominator.] Missing from this estimate is 150 women
who had never had a sexual experience and were not
directed to the self-complete section of the questionnaire
Another limitation is that, because of the cross-sectional
nature of the data, we are unable to infer causality. Sexual
pain may cause, stem from, or co-exist with poor psy-
chosocial, physical and sexual health, and even for in-
depth research, the challenge of delineating causal path-
ways is daunting. As with almost all research on pain, we
relied on self-report data. We sought to minimise report-
ing bias by including items on pain in the self-complete
section of the questionnaire.

 Interpretation
Prevalence studies vary in measurement and sampling
approaches, limiting the value of comparison across popu-
lation-based studies.4 Our estimates can be compared most
reliably with studies using probability sampling and one
broad item to measure pain. In the US National Health
and Social Life survey, Laumann et al. reported prevalence
of pain during sex ranging from 21% among women aged
18–29 years to 8% among women aged 50–59 years.26 The
Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships,
measuring painful sex lasting ≥1 month in the past year,
estimated a prevalence of 10% among women aged 20–
64 years.27 Our estimates were slightly lower than this, and
decreased further when stricter morbidity criteria were used
(see also ref. 28), and this effect has also been found in
other population surveys.24,29 Other studies do not measure
dyspareunia per se, but report estimates of genital pain dis-
orders such as vulvodynia. Studies using telephone surveys
to ask about detailed symptomatology generally produce
estimates of around 3.8%17 and 4.2%5 for vulvar pain of
≥6 months duration, and 8.3% for vulvodynia.30
Our data confirm the strong link between pain and
impaired sexual function found in the literature.2,7,12,31 The
relationship context of pain is beginning to receive more
attention,7 but evidence of the link between sexual pain
and relationship adjustment and satisfaction is equivocal.32
We found no association between sexual pain and general
happiness in the relationship, but strong associations with
sexual aspects of the relationship, such as not sharing the
same level of interest in sex, not feeling emotionally close,
not sharing the same sexual likes and dislikes, and difficulty
talking about sexual matters. This is consistent with the
conclusion of a recent review, suggesting that while sexual
pain is associated with sexual dissatisfaction, it is not neces-
sarily associated with poor relationship adjustment in gen-
eral. 32
A number of studies have linked childhood abuse with
later experience of painful sex.12,33 We found a link with
sex against one’s will, after the age of 13 years, suggesting
that nonvolitional sex in adolescence and adulthood is also
important. STIs are a known direct cause of genital pain34
and although this may explain the association we found, it
is also possible that previous experience of an STI leads
some individuals to associate sex with disease, possibly
engendering difficulties with arousal, and in turn, leading
to painful sex.2 In contrast to previous research,7,12,31 we
did not find an association of pain with frequency of inter-
course. It has been suggested that some women simply
endure their symptoms in order to continue having sex
with their partner2,35 and our inclusion of women with
milder symptoms (compared with clinical samples) may
have resulted in a higher proportion of women who
continue to have sex despite their symptoms. The Natsal-3
survey found that people also have sex less frequently
nowadays,21 making it harder to detect a significant associ-
ation with frequency.
Our finding of a clear association between pain and self-
reported health and reporting two or more chronic health
conditions is consistent with the literature linking pain
with a range of chronic conditions such as irritable bowel
syndrome, urinary tract infections, depression and chronic
fatigue syndrome.12,17,36 In postmenopausal women, painful
sex is typically associated with dryness resulting from vagi-
nal atrophy.37 We found that reporting painful sex was
associated with menopausal status, although several studies
have failed to find such an association.5,17,38 Our finding of
an association with depressive symptoms is supported by
case–control studies7,12,14 but has not always been found in
population studies.15,31
Although painful sex is less commonly reported by
women than lacking interest in sex and difficulty reaching
climax,39 it is the sexual function problem most commonly
experienced as distressing.28 It can lead to feelings of isola-
tion, shame, sexual inadequacy, loss of confidence and feel-
ing out of control.7,8,38 Only a fraction of women affected
by genital pain disorders ever receive an official diagnosis:
1.4% in a study of women meeting criteria for vulvody-
nia.30 In a previous paper from Natsal-3 28 we reported
that less than half of women with morbid symptoms of
sexual pain had sought professional help in the last year.
Among those who do seek treatment, negative experiences
are common, including invalidated concerns, not receiving
a formal diagnosis, and being given treatment perceived as
ineffective.5,40
Conclusion
Practical and research recommendations
In terms of clinical assessment, our data support the litera-
ture in demonstrating the importance of taking a holistic
and detailed history: thoroughly investigating symptoms,
asking about enjoyment and satisfaction, and taking into
account the relationship context. There is a need for
resources to support clinicians who feel uncomfortable
broaching the topic of sexual function and pleasure with
their patients, including advice on language and on when
to refer patients to specialists in sexual health.
We have confirmed the strong link between painful sex
and self-assessed poor health and experience of chronic
health conditions. Further research might explore the
extent to which painful sex might usefully serve as a diag-
nostic indicator of other health problems, in the same way
that erectile difficulties often signify cardiovascular prob-
lems in men.41

Painful sex among women in Britain
 Our finding of an association between painful sex and
wanting to have known more at first sexual experience has
been demonstrated elsewhere.33 Given that painful sex is
common in younger women, and that half of young
women report their first experience of intercourse as pain-
ful,42 it would seem prudent to ensure that the possibility
of pain is discussed openly in sex education and in consul-
tations between young people and health professionals.
This study provides up-to-date prevalence estimates of
painful sex in a representative sample of British women,
across a wide age range. It is also rare in exploring—simul-
taneously and in detail—associations between dyspareunia
and sexual functioning of the relationship, previous sexual
history, attitudes towards sex and general health. In doing
so, it has addressed a gap in the understanding of the social
and relationship patterning of painful sex (dyspareunia) at
population level. Our findings are important and relevant
to the work of a range of practitioners involved in gynae-
cology, oncology, psychosexual therapy, and more broadly
in therapeutic settings.
