Abstract
Background: The vaginal microbiome influences quality of life and health. The composition of vaginal microbiota
can be affected by various health behaviors, such as vaginal douching. The purpose of this study was to examine
the types and prevalence of diverse vaginal/genital health and hygiene behaviors among participants living in
Canada and to examine associations between behavioral practices and adverse gynecological health conditions.
Method: An anonymous online survey, available in English and French, was distributed across Canada. The sample
consisted of 1435 respondents, 18 years or older, living in Canada.
Results: Respondents reported engaging in diverse vaginal/genital health and hygiene behavioral practices, including
the use of commercially manufactured products and homemade and naturopathic products and practices. Over 95% of
respondents reported using at least one product in or around the vaginal area. Common products and practices included
vaginal/genital moisturizers, anti-itch creams, feminine wipes, washes, suppositories, sprays, powders, and waxing
and shaving pubic hair. The majority of the sample (80%) reported experiencing one or more adverse vaginal/
genital symptom in their lifetime. Participants who had used any vaginal/genital product(s) had approximately
three times higher odds of reporting an adverse health condition. Several notable associations between specific
vaginal/genital health and hygiene products and adverse health conditions were identified.
Conclusions: This study is the first of its kind to identify the range and prevalence of vaginal/genital health and hygiene
behaviors in Canada. Despite a lack of credible information about the impact of these behaviors on women’s health, the
use of commercially manufactured and homemade products for vaginal/genital health and hygiene is common. Future
research can extend the current exploratory study by identifying causal relationships between vaginal/genital health and
hygiene behaviors and changes to the vaginal microbiome.

Background
The vaginal microbiome (the microbial community in
the vagina) influences quality of life, defends against
pathogens, and influences fertility and reproductive
success [1–3]. Disruptions in the balance of the micro-
bial ecosystem can result in profound health conse-
quences. Current microbiome research is working to
determine the microbes that characterize a healthy
microbiome
in
order
to
link
particular
microbial
profiles with adverse gynecological and obstetrical out-
comes [2–8]. The composition of vaginal microbiota
can be affected by various health behaviors such as
antibiotic use, sexual activity, and behavioral interven-
tions such as douching and birth control methods [9,
10]. Previous research on vaginal health behaviors has
focused primarily on vaginal douching. Reports of
douching prevalence vary, but the US Centre for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention reports approximately 20%
of women between 15 and 44 years of age had douched
within the last year [11]. This practice has been linked
to adverse obstetrical and gynecological health out-
comes, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, reduced

 fertility, ectopic pregnancy, low-birth rate, pre-term
pregnancy, cervical cancer, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and
higher risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted path-
ogens [12–17]. For example, a cross-sectional survey
with almost 4000 American women found that among
asymptomatic women, the prevalence of BV was signifi-
cantly higher among those who had douched. However,
there was no relationship between BV prevalence and
douching among symptomatic women. This study also
found a significant association between BV prevalence
and the use of feminine cleansing wipes, but no associ-
ation with sprays [18]. Research examining American
women’s vaginal practices beyond douching found that
those who douched were more likely to use other com-
mercially available vaginal products such as sprays,
wipes, powders, and bubble bath for feminine cleaning
[19]. Cross-sectional studies in the US have reported
between 42 and 53% of women had used sprays, be-
tween 17 and 50% used feminine wipes, between 23
and 46% used anti-itch products, and 2% used deodor-
ant suppositories [20, 21]. The use of products in the
vaginal area for cleansing and other purposes has also
been documented in a number of African and Asian
countries [22, 23].
For the efficacy of medical interventions to be opti-
mized, they need to be applied in the context of know-
ledge of social and cultural practices that shape relevant
health behavior. As microbiome research is progressing,
it is important to understand the impact of various vagi-
nal practices on vaginal microbiota and subsequent
health outcomes. The purpose of the current research is
to develop a comprehensive understanding of the diver-
sity and frequency of vaginal/genital health and hygiene
behaviors. This paper reports on findings from a large
nation-wide online survey of Canadian participants’ vagi-
nal/genital health and hygiene behaviors and health con-
ditions. The purpose of this paper is to: i) describe the
types and prevalence of vaginal/genital symptoms and
health conditions; ii) describe the types and prevalence
of health and hygiene practices; iii) and identify associa-
tions between product use and adverse health condi-
tions. As microbiome research continues to advance our
understanding of the connection between vaginal micro-
biome and human health, our aim was to identify health
and hygiene behaviors that may influence the health of
the vaginal microbiome. This research is a first step in
improving our understanding of the role of human be-
havior on the composition of the vaginal microbiome.
Methods
Survey development
Research ethics approval was obtained from the Univer-
sity of Guelph Research Ethics Board. A comprehensive
survey about vaginal/genital health and hygiene practices
and product use was initially developed via (1) a review
of the academic literature; (2) an internet search for va-
ginal/genital hygiene products and practices; and (3)
cataloguing of vaginal/genital hygiene products available
for sale at local drugstores. Five focus groups were con-
ducted over 6 months to obtain feedback on survey clar-
ity, cultural sensitivity, and comprehensiveness. Results
from the focus groups were used to inform changes to
the survey design and content.
The final version asked questions about frequency of
use of various products in and around the vaginal area,
including products marketed specifically for use in the
vaginal area (i.e., washes, wipes, sprays, powders, de-
odorants, suppositories, anti-itch creams, moisturizers/
lubricants, douches, and menstrual products) and gen-
eral products (i.e., baby wipes, body creams, baby oil).
Use of vaginal/genital health and hygiene products in-
ternal to the vagina and external to the vagina were re-
ported at 3 months prior to completing the survey.
Respondents could provide information on their motiva-
tions for using products in open-ended text boxes. Other
questions included history of vaginal/genital symptoms
and adverse health condition diagnoses (reported within
the 6 months prior to completing the survey), history of
various vaginal/genital health and hygiene practices, and
sexual health history, among other topics. Text boxes
allowed respondents to share specific information about
products, practices, and experiences not captured in the
response options.
Recruitment
The anonymous online survey, available in English and
French, was launched in October 2012 and was avail-
able until May 2014. The survey was open to individ-
uals 18 years of age and older living anywhere in the
world, but recruitment targeted a Canadian sample.
The study was advertised as “women’s health and hy-
giene” but eligibility was not based on participant gen-
der identity and as such the survey was not limited to
participants who identified as “woman” or “female.” In-
formed consent was obtained prior to the start of the
survey. Advertisements were posted on Canadian city
webpages of online classifieds (e.g., Kijiji). Recruitment
emails with a request to help disseminate the study
were sent to Canadian organizations and groups with a
possible interest in the research (e.g., women’s health
organizations, sexual and gender diversity groups, older
women’s groups, Indigenous women’s groups). Social
media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter), including paid Facebook
advertising, was used to promote the survey around the
country. A participant recruitment firm was hired also
to assist in recruiting participants from particular
demographics.

 Participant demographics
In total, 1471 individuals completed the survey. An add-
itional 233 individuals started but did not submit the sur-
vey. The analysis includes the 1435 participants who were
living in Canada at the time they completed the survey.
The majority of participants (98.6%) identified as cisgender
women, one identified as a transwoman (0.1%), eight iden-
tified as transmen (0.6%), and 11 provided no answer
(0.8%). See Table 1 for additional participant demographics.
Data analysis
Given the exploratory nature of this study, descriptive
analysis focused on frequencies of behaviors and adverse
health conditions. Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analyses were used to test associations between
product use and adverse health conditions. Associations
were estimated using odds ratio and 95% confidence inter-
vals. Due to small cell counts, the internal and external
product variables were collapsed into dichotomous prod-
uct variables and all STIs (trichomoniasis, gonorrhea,
chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, and syphilis) were
collapsed into a single dichotomous variable. Dichotom-
ous composite variables were created for the primary out-
come (participant report of any type of adverse health
condition) and the primary risk factor (participant report
of use of any vaginal/genital health and hygiene product).
A univariate logistic regression model was fit to test this
relationship. To test for potential confounding demo-
graphic factors, a series of univariate logistic regression
models were fit to test for a relationship between selected
demographic factors of interest (ethnic/racial identity, age,
education level, and sexual orientation) and adverse health
conditions. Significant demographic variables at the p
< .05 level were entered into a multivariate logistic regres-
sion model to test the relationship between product use
and adverse health conditions. Finally, univariate logistic
regression models were fit to test the associations between
each product and each adverse health condition. Missing
data (i.e., the participant did not complete the question)
were excluded from analysis. Statistical package SPSS 23.0
[24] was used for the analysis.
Results
The results are reported in three sections: (1) respon-
dents’ reported vaginal/genital symptoms and health
conditions,
(2)
respondents’
reported
vaginal/genital
health and hygiene behaviors, and (3) associations
between commonly used vaginal/genital health and
hygiene products and adverse health conditions.
Symptoms and health conditions
Vaginal/genital
symptoms
included
itching
(74.5%),
burning (50.2%), unusual discharge (45.2%), redness
(34.9%), irritation/rash (21.3%), swelling (17.9%), and
sores (10.7%). Eighty percent reported having experi-
enced at least one symptom ever in their lifetime.
Almost 36% reported having ever experienced one to
two symptoms, 32.2% reported between three and four
symptoms, and 17.8% reported five or more symptoms,
with 3.1% reporting experiencing each of the seven
symptoms at least once in their lifetime. The median
number of symptoms reported was 2.0.
Over half of the sample reported having been clinically
diagnosed at least once in their lifetime (“ever diag-
nosed”) with a yeast infection/candida (54.1%) and a
urinary tract infection (UTI) (56.1%). Approximately
12% reported bacterial vaginosis (BV) diagnosis at least
once in their lifetime. Diagnosis of a sexually transmitted
infection (STI) was reported by a smaller proportion of

 the sample: HPV (6.0%), trichomoniasis (2.2%), genital
warts (6.1%), genital herpes (3.8%), chlamydia (5.6%),
gonorrhea (2.2%), and syphilis (0.3%). Approximately 6%
of the sample reported having ever been diagnosed with
cervical cancer.
Vaginal/genital health and hygiene product use and
practices
Respondents reported using a wide variety of commercially
manufactured and homemade health and hygiene products
(Table 2) and engaging in diverse health and hygiene prac-
tices (Table 3). The analysis presented in this paper
excludes menstrual products. Approximately 95% of the
sample reported using at least one product in the vaginal/
genital area. The number of products used by respondents
ranged from 0 to 14 (M = 3.80, SD = 2.18). Respondents re-
ported using vaginal/genital health and hygiene products
both on the outer genital area (externally) and in the vagina
(internally). Products were more likely to be used exter-
nally than internally, with the exception of some products
such as suppositories and douches that are intended for
internal use. Over 90% of respondents had ever used (life-
time use) one or more products externally, while 64%
reported using one or more products internally.
Commercially manufactured and advertised products
specified as “feminine” or for vaginal health and/or
hygiene included douches, wipes, washes, sprays, powders,
moisturizers/lubricants, deodorant suppositories, tablet
suppositories (e.g., probiotics, tablets or ovules for vaginal
infections) and anti-itch creams. Products used in the
genital area but not intended or marketed for such use
included hand sanitizers, body lotion, baby oil, baby wipes,
and shaving cream. With the exception of douches, which
included both commercially manufactured and home-
made douches, products used by respondents were mostly
commercially manufactured. Survey respondents (21.3%)
reported using a variety of different commercially manu-
factured and homemade vaginal douches. Of those partici-
pants, 19.6% (n = 45) had used at least one type of
homemade or commercially manufactured douche in the
6 months prior to completing the survey. Participants also
provided information about other products used in the
vaginal or genital area not otherwise captured by the sur-
vey. Fifteen percent indicated they had used other prod-
ucts, and half of those participants (49.8%) had used the
product in the last 3 months. The most common of these
products included medicated creams, sprays, and gels
(2.7%), cooking oils (1.6%), yogurt (topical and suppositor-
ies) (1.4%), garlic clove suppositories (1.1%), probiotic sup-
positories
(0.8%),
prescription
suppositories
(0.08%),
depilatory creams (0.8%), and petroleum jelly (0.7%).
Frequency of use ranged considerably across the differ-
ent products, with a sizable portion of participants using
a product in or around the vaginal area at least once per
day. For example, among participants who reported
using wipes externally in the past 3 months (N = 271),
30% used the product at least once a day. A similar per-
centage of participants (N = 37, 29.7%) reported using
wipes internally at least once per day in the past 3
months. Similarly high rates of daily use were found with
several other products. For example, 46.7% of partici-
pants who reported using powders externally (N = 30),
35.4% of participants who reported using washes exter-
nally (N = 65), and 18.4% of participants who reported

 using baby wipes externally (N = 256) reported doing so
at least once per day in the past 3 months. There were
also several products, including deodorant suppositories
and internal use of hand creams, baby oil, and gel saniti-
zers, that were not used daily by any participants.
Practices related to vaginal/genital health and hygiene
included sexual practices (e.g., inserting sex toys into the
vagina, G-spot injections), aesthetic practices (e.g., cos-
metic surgery, waxing pubic hair, vaginal bleaching), and
cultural/religious
practices
(e.g.,
traditional
genital
cutting).
Associations between product use and adverse health
conditions
In this section, we examine the associations between
participants’ use of vaginal/genital health and hygiene
products and adverse vaginal/genital health conditions.
Participants who reported use of any vaginal/genital health
and hygiene product(s) had approximately three times
higher odds of reporting any adverse health condition (re-
ported history of BV, yeast infection, UTI, or STI) (OR =
3.2, 95% CI: 2.4-4.2) (p < .01). Univariate and multivariate
analyses to test for confounding demographic factors are
presented in Table 4. Participant age and sexual orientation
were added to the model, but had no significant effect on
the relationship between product use and health condition
(OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 4.5-4.3) (p < .01).
Several significant associations were found between
the use of specific vaginal/genital health and hygiene

 products (anti-itch creams, moisturizers/lubricants, gel
sanitizers, feminine wipes, baby wipes, feminine washes/
gels, and douches) and a previous diagnosis of either BV,
yeast infection, or UTI. Participants who reported using
anti-itch cream had almost 18 times higher odds of
reporting a yeast infection (OR = 17.8, 95% CI: 11.9-
26.5) (p < .01), 5 times higher odds of reporting BV (OR
= 4.8, 95% CI: 2.1-10. 8) (p < .01), and two times higher
odds of reporting a UTI (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.4-3.5) (p
< .01) than participants who had not used anti-itch
creams. Participants who reported using moisturizers/lu-
bricants had 2.5 times higher odds of reporting a yeast
infection (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.8-3.5) (p < .01) and 50%
higher odds of reporting a UTI (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-
2.1) (p = .03) than participants who had not used mois-
turizers/lubricants. Participants who reported using gel
sanitizers had almost 8 times higher odds of reporting a
yeast infection (OR = 7.61, 95% CI: 2.3-25.2) (p < .01)
and almost 20 times higher odds of reporting BV (OR =
19.5, 95% CI: 4.9-77.9) (p < .01) than participants who
had not used gel sanitizers. Participants who reported
using feminine wipes had almost double the odds of
reporting a UTI (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) (p <. 01).
Similarly, participants who reported using baby wipes
had almost 60% higher odds of reporting a UTI (OR =
1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.3) (p = .02). Participants who reported
using feminine washes/gels had almost 3.5 times higher
odds of reporting BV (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.2-10.1) (p
= .03) and almost 2.5 times higher odds of reporting a
UTI (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4-4.3) (p < .01). Finally, partici-
pants who reported using a douche in the previous
6 months had almost 3 times higher odds of reporting a
yeast infection (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5-5.6) (p < .01), 7
times higher odds of reporting BV (OR = 7.0, 95% CI:
2.3-22.0) (p < .01), and more than 2.5 times higher odds
of reporting a UTI (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-5.2) (p < .01)
than participants who had not douched.
Adverse health conditions were not significantly asso-
ciated with the use of deodorant sprays, powders, baby
oils, hand/body creams, or deodorant suppositories. No
significant associations were found between having an
STI and the use of any particular vaginal/genital health
and hygiene product.
Discussion
The results of this cross-sectional survey identified the
high prevalence of particular vaginal/genital health and
hygiene behaviors among individuals living in Canada,
and identified the most commonly used commercially
manufactured and homemade products and practices,
including anti-itch creams, feminine wipes, feminine
washes/gels, douches, baby wipes, moisturizers/lubricants,
tablet suppositories, and pubic hair removal practices.
While douching has been the focus of previous research,
and douching prevalence in the current study was consist-
ent with national surveys in the US [11, 18] (around 21%
of the sample), the prevalence of other products in the
current study, particularly anti-itch creams, moisturizers/
lubricants, feminine wipes, and baby wipes in and around
the vaginal area, was higher than douching. This is
consistent with the proliferation of a range of different
commercially manufactured products for vaginal/genital
health and hygiene now available in most drug and
grocery stores.
With respect to symptom prevalence, most participants
had experienced at least one vaginal/genital symptom in
their lifetime; the most common of which were itching,
burning, and unusual discharge. Approximately half of the
sample
reported
experiencing
adverse
vaginal/genital
health conditions such as yeast infection, BV, and UTI.
Finally, several notable associations were found between
the use of particular vaginal/genital health and hygiene
products
and
various
adverse
vaginal/genital
health
conditions.
A better understanding of the types and prevalence of
vaginal/genital health and hygiene behaviors is a neces-
sary first step toward understanding the relationships
between these behaviors and adverse health conditions,
and ultimately their role in the health of the vaginal
microbiome. This is particularly important given estab-
lished connections between vaginal conditions such as
BV and other serious sexual health conditions such as
HIV and other STIs [25–27] and adverse pregnancy out-
comes such as preterm birth and endometriosis [28–30].
While we are unable to make claims about the causal
direction of these relationships, our study shows that
participants who had used any vaginal/genital health and
hygiene product(s) in the 3 months prior had approxi-
mately three times higher odds of reporting any adverse
health condition, controlling for age and sexual orienta-
tion. We also identified several key associations between
specific products and adverse health conditions to be
more fully explored in future research. While some asso-
ciations were expected, such as the use of anti-itch
creams in relation to yeast infections (a common symp-
tom of which is genital itch), other identified associa-
tions point to important areas for future research. Most
notably, the use of gel sanitizers was associated with
higher odds of having a yeast infection and BV, the use
of both feminine and baby wipes was associated with
higher odds of UTI, and vaginal moisturizers/lubricants
was associated with higher odds of both yeast infection
and UTI. Additionally, and consistent with previous
research [12–17], douching was associated with higher
odds of yeast infection, BV, and UTI.
There are several explanations for the relationships
between product use and adverse health conditions that
are worth considering. In some cases, women may be

 using certain products to address symptoms or health
conditions. In light of the high rates of reported symp-
toms, participants already experiencing gynecological
conditions may be seeking out over-the-counter or
homemade remedies for symptoms management or ces-
sation. Women who, for example, suspect a yeast infec-
tion may be seeking over the counter anti-itch creams to
manage
the
condition.
Alternatively,
vaginal/genital
symptoms and health conditions may present as a result
of using certain products. As one example, our study
found that participants who used gel sanitizers had
almost 8 times higher odds of reporting a yeast infection
diagnosis than those participants who had not used gel
sanitizers. It is possible that gel sanitizers, which often
include dyes and other chemical ingredients, cause or
exacerbate the yeast infection through disruption of the
natural vaginal microbiome or through micro-abrasions
caused inside the vagina. It will be important for future
scientific and medical research to explore the associa-
tions identified in the current study because determining
the specific nature of the relationship is critical for
informing clinical practice. Regardless of the direction of
the relationship between product use and health condi-
tions, education and outreach about product efficacy
and safety is necessary.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first study to collect comprehensive data on
diverse
vaginal/genital
health
and
hygiene
behavior
among respondents living in Canada. Previous research
examining vaginal/genital practices and their impact on
vaginal ecology or health outcomes has narrowly focused
on specific behaviors, such as douching. Our aim was to
recruit a large Canadian sample that resembled national
demographic statistics within a reasonable timeframe.
While our sample was close to resembling national
statistics across several key demographics, including eth-
nicity, sexual orientation, and education (e.g., 89% White
in sample compared to 83% nationally), we were not as
successful as we had intended in the number of partici-
pants we recruited residing in Quebec and those 40 years
and older. Despite this limitation, this research provides
the first account of vaginal/genital health and hygiene
behaviors at the national level. Although these findings
may generalize to individuals living in Canada, further
scientific research with more complex statistical analysis
is necessary.
In future research, temporal periods for engaging in
vaginal/genital health and hygiene behaviors and inci-
dence of symptoms and health conditions should be
consistent to ensure meaningful interpretation of ana-
lysis. Additional information, such as menopausal status
and the use of hormonal therapies, would be of further
benefit. Finally, given the exploratory nature of these
data and the small number of participants who reported
using certain products, our analysis was limited to descrip-
tion and regression analysis and as such causal relationships
cannot be inferred. Although several of the effect sizes for
particular associations seemed quite large, it was difficult to
get a precise estimate due to small cell counts in some
cases and these should be interpreted with caution. Future
research using prospective or case control designs can build
on these preliminary correlational findings to assess causal
links between vaginal/genital health and hygiene behaviors
and
vaginal/genital
symptoms
and
adverse
health
conditions.
Conclusions
The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify the
types and prevalence of vaginal/genital symptoms, health
conditions, and health and hygiene behaviors among
Canadians. This research can inform medical researchers
and practitioners about the diversity and prevalence of va-
ginal symptoms, adverse gynecological health conditions,
and importantly, vaginal/genital health behaviors that may
be relevant to abnormal microbial profiles as microbiome
research advances. Future biological research can extend
the current study by identifying causal relationships be-
tween vaginal health and hygiene behaviors and changes
to the vaginal microbiome.
Our findings will help inform healthcare professionals
and the public about possible areas of concern regarding
products and practices. Previous research has identified a
link between douches and vaginal infections, and as this
and other relationships between health and hygiene behav-
iors and adverse gynecological outcomes are further exam-
ined, it will be important for healthcare providers, public
health units, and governments to respond accordingly to
inform the public and put in place necessary warning labels
and restrictions. Our study shows that a large number of
respondents use products inside the vagina even when the
product is not intended for use in the genital/vaginal area
or product labels warn against internal use (e.g., vaginal
washes and wipes). Should future research find some prod-
ucts to be safe and effective for addressing vaginal symp-
toms and health conditions, healthcare providers will
similarly want to discuss this with patients. The increasing
availability and variety of vaginal health and hygiene prod-
ucts requires oversight and regulation regardless of the
causal nature of the relationship between products and
health conditions. Evidence-based information about the
safety and efficacy of these products is paramount to ensur-
ing women’s health. This information can assist women in
making informed choices when choosing products or par-
taking in various health, social, and/or cultural practices.
