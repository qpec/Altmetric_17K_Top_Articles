The Impact of a Plastic Surgeon’s Gender on 
Patient Choice

Abstract
Background: In the patient-driven market of aesthetic surgery, an understanding of the factors that patients consider in their choice of surgeon can 
inform the individual plastic surgeon’s marketing strategy. Previous studies have investigated patient gender preferences for physicians in other specialties, 
but none has investigated whether patients consider gender when choosing a plastic surgeon.
Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a plastic surgeon’s gender on patient choice.
Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a single private practice of two plastic surgeons, one male and one female, both closely matched in 
training, experience, and reputation. Two hundred consecutive patients calling for a consultation were asked if they preferred a male or female doctor; 
their preference, age, and area(s) of interest were recorded.
Results: All patients were women. Nearly half (46%) had no gender preference, 26% requested a female surgeon, and 1% requested a male. Pref-
erence for a female surgeon was significant (Binomial-test: P < 0.001). The remaining 27% requested a specific doctor, with slightly more requesting 
(53.7%) the male surgeon by name, than requested the female surgeon by name (46.3%), a difference that was not statistically significant (P = 0.683).
Conclusions: Most female patients interested in aesthetic surgery have no gender preference. Of those who do, nearly all requested a female plastic 
surgeon. More important than a plastic surgeon’s gender, however, is a plastic surgeon’s reputation.

Most surgical referrals are based on a list of doctors asso-
ciated with patients’ insurance plans, whereas the market 
for aesthetic surgery is patient-driven, and its demand is 
growing. In just 18 years (1997 to 2015) the number of 
cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has 
risen 800%,1 With approximately 6300 board-certified 
plastic surgeons in active practice2 and with many other 
physicians performing cosmetic procedures, competition 
for patients is inevitable. Knowing the factors that are 
important to a patient in search of a surgeon can inform 
the individual plastic surgeon’s marketing strategy, web-
site design, blog content, and social media presence.
Previous studies indicate that patients base their 
choice of plastic surgeon on several factors, including 
the surgeon’s reputation, board certification, years of 
experience, the method of patient referral, the surgeon’s 
training, membership in the American Society of Plastic 
Surgeons, and the physician’s demeanor.3-8 Patients with 
advanced levels of education place high value on the 
prestige of a surgeon’s medical school, residency, and fel-
lowship.9 While patients’ gender preference in choosing 
a physician has been investigated in non-plastic surgery 
specialties,9-19 there has been little more than anecdotal

evidence of such preference among plastic surgery 
patients.20
The results of studies investigating patients’ gender pref-
erences for non-plastic surgery physicians vary widely. Some 
have shown that when choosing a surgeon, most patients 
have no gender preference,9-13,19,21 although some, mostly 
women, prefer a female breast surgeon. Among patients seek-
ing other types of surgeons, both men and women prefer a 
male surgeon.9,11-14,18,22 A study investigating thirteen health 
professions found male respondents prefer male internists 
and surgeons,19 while female respondents preferred female 
general practitioners, internists, and gynecologists, though 
they had no preference regarding a surgeon’s gender.19 Other 
studies have shown female patients gender preferences are 
stronger than they are among males,19 and that their prefer-
ence for a female doctor is especially strong among adoles-
cent girls and female patients with intimate concerns, such 
as pelvic exams or psychosocial health issues.12,15
Female patients’ preference for female doctors may be 
related to both greater comfort with intimate exams19 as well 
as to communication style.6,16,19,23 Visits between female 
doctors and female patients are longer than when different 
genders meet.16 Indeed, other studies have confirmed that 
women spend more time with patients,6,18,19,23,24 engage 
in a partnership-building style,28 show more concern and 
empathy,6,18,24-28 ask more about patients’ emotions, and 
facilitate patient participation in a dialogue by speaking 
positively, smiling, and nodding.24-28 These qualities are 
shown to matter more to female patients than to males.24-
28 The exception to these findings is in the field of obstet-
rics and gynecology, in which men were found in one 
study to spend more time with patients and to engage in 
more dialogue.29 Communication style is not patients’ only 
consideration; those who prefer men feel male physicians 
are more technically competent.30
Given the variation of patients’ gender preferences for 
their physicians in other medical fields, it would be diffi-
cult to predict patients’ gender preferences for plastic sur-
geons without an investigation. The purpose of this study 
is to determine the impact of a plastic surgeon’s gender on 
patient choice.
METHODS
A prospective study was conducted in a single private 
practice of two plastic surgeons, one male and one female. 
Both plastic surgeons trained during the same time at the 
same institution, obtained board certification the same 
year, performed the same types of procedures, had similar 
reputations, and had similar online reviews and content. 
As a married couple, neither mentioned surgeon gender 
in a promotional way in marketing materials, and their 
marriage was mentioned only within the body of their in-
dividual website biographies.
Two female patient coordinators fielded calls from 200 
consecutive prospective new patients requesting a consul-
tation. The study began July 24, 2015 and was ended on 
February 2, 2016, when the study target of 200 calls was 
reached. Neither patient coordinator was assigned to a spe-
cific doctor, so calls were distributed according to which 
doctor had the soonest available appointment time. If the 
caller didn’t request a specific doctor by name, the patient 
coordinator asked the caller if she preferred a male or a 
female doctor, then documented each caller’s gender pref-
erence, age, and area(s) of interest, categorized as breast, 
body, face, and/or genital. Institutional review board (IRB) 
approval was not sought, as this was a non-clinical, non-ex-
perimental, marketing survey study, and the Helsinki 
Doctrine on Human Experimentation was not violated.
Data are presented as frequency and means with stan-
dard deviations. Statistical analysis was performed using 
IBM SPSS Software, Version 24. The data were analyzed 
using binomial and t tests. Significance was determined by 
a P value of <0.005.
RESULTS
All 200 patients calling for a plastic surgery consultation 
during the study period were women, and none were men. 
Their mean age was 39 years (range, 17-80 years; standard 
deviation, 14.036). Fifty-two patients (26%) requested a 
female doctor, 2 (1%) requested a male doctor, and 92 
(46%) had no preference regarding the gender of their sur-
geon (Figure 1). Of those patients requesting a doctor by 
gender, the preference for a female doctor over a male doc-
tor was significant (P < 0.001). Fifty-four patients (27%) 
requested a specific surgeon, of which 29 (14.5%) specif-
ically requested FLC, the male surgeon, and 25 (12.5%) 
specifically requested HJF, the female surgeon. This differ-
ence was not statistically significant (P = 0.683).

Patients’ Surgeon Gender Preference and 
Anatomic Area of Concern
When asked about the anatomic area of concern, 180 ex-
pressed an interest in a single area, and 20 expressed an 
interest in two. Of all patients, 131 patients (65.5%) had 
an interest in breast, 41 (20.5%) had an interest in body, 
29 (14.5%) had an interest in face, and 19 (9.5%) had an 
interest in genital surgery (Figure 2).
Preference for Female Doctor and Anatomic Area of 
Concern
Of the 52 patients who requested a female doctor, 32 
(61.54%) had an interest in breast, 7 (13.46%) had an in-
terest in body, 7 (13.46%) had an interest in face, and 10 
(19.23%) had an interest in genital surgery (Figure 3).
Preference for Male Doctor and Anatomic Area of 
Concern
Of the two patients who requested a male doctor, both 
(100%) had an interest in breast surgery.
No Gender Preference and Anatomic Area of Concern
Of the 92 patients with no gender preference, 58 (63.04%) 
had an interest in breast, 28 (30.43%) had an interest in 
body, 13 (14.13%) had an interest in face, and 6 (6.52%) 
had an interest in genital surgery.
Request for the Female Surgeon, and Anatomic Area of 
Concern
Of the 25 patients (12.5% of all) who specifically request-
ed HJF, the female surgeon, 17 (65.38%) were interest-
ed in breast, 2 (7.69%) were interested in body, 4 were 
(15.38%) were interested in face, and 3 (11.54%) were 
interested in genital surgery.
Request for the Male Surgeon, and Anatomic Area of 
Concern
Of the 29 patients (14.5% of all patients) who specifically 
requested FLC, the male surgeon, 22 (68.75%) were inter-
ested in breast, 5 (15.63%) were interested in body, 5 were 
(15.63%) interested in face, and none were interested in 
genital surgery.
Patient Age and Surgeon Gender 
Preference
Age differences between those patients with male and fe-
male surgeon preferences were not significant (P = 0.724), 
nor were age differences between those requesting FLC, 
the male surgeon, compared with those requesting HJF, 
the female surgeon (P = 0.292).
DISCUSSION
As insurance reimbursements have declined, the cosmetic 
surgery market has become increasingly competitive, mo-
tivating more physicians of all specialties to perform cash-
based cosmetic procedures.31 To steer prospective patients 
to their members, competing professional organizations 
have created online patient guides and surgeon search 
forms.32-34 Individual surgeons’ websites often include 
content that may be seen as attractive or reassuring to pro-
spective patients, such as a surgeon’s biography, years of 
practice experience, board-certification, area(s) of surgical 
Figure 2. Distribution of interests among 200 inquiring 
patients. Of those patients, 180 had a single interest, and 20 
had two interests, with 131 interested in breast, 41 interested 
in body, 29 interested in face, and 19 interested in genital 
surgery.

interests were categorized as breast (blue), body (red), face 
(green), and genital (purple). The vertical axis indicates the 
number of patients interested in each category.

interest, before-and-after photos, and quotes from happy 
patients. In addition, women plastic surgeons sometimes 
include their gender as a positive attribute.
While patient gender preferences have been studied 
in other medical and surgical specialties, similar stud-
ies among plastic surgery patients have been primarily 
anecdotal.20
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
a plastic surgeon’s gender matters in patient choice. The 
results indicated that nearly half of patients surveyed 
had no preference regarding the gender of their sur-
geon. If we consider only those patients who did not 
request a specific doctor, nearly two-thirds (63.01%) had 
no gender preference. Among those who did, 35.61% of 
all patients preferred a female doctor, and just 1.37% 
preferred a male. This was statistically significant. 
However, of those requesting a specific doctor, slightly 
more patients requested FLC, the male surgeon, than 
requested HJF, the female, a difference that wasn’t sta-
tistically significant.
Patients considering body surgery cared least about 
their surgeon’s gender, with nearly two-thirds (65.85%) 
having no gender preference and only 16.67% requesting a 
female doctor. Nearly a quarter of those interested in breast 
and face preferred a female surgeon, possibly indicating 
the greater privacy associated with breasts and a greater 
preference for gender concordance among older women.
Among patients with a genital interest, no one requested 
either a male surgeon or FLC, while half preferred a female 
and 16% requested HJF. Just as primary care patients pre-
ferred female doctors the more intimate their concern,18,19 
plastic surgery patients considering female genital proce-
dures may have a greater preference for a female surgeon 
for the same reason.
All patients in this study were women, mirroring the 
nationwide statistic that 90% of cosmetic surgical pro-
cedures are performed on women.1 Most patients with a 
gender preference requested a female doctor. Although 
the patients surveyed were not asked to provide a reason 
for their preference, based on studies indicating patient 
preference for gender concordance,17,22 it is possible that 
these female patients sought a same-gender doctor rather 
than any perceived superiority in the skills or qualities of 
female surgeons.17,22 At the time of this writing, just 14% 
of plastic surgeons are women, but they make up 37% of 
trainees.35 Female patients for whom gender concordance 
is important may welcome the growing choice of female 
plastic surgeons.
Nonetheless, our study reflects the results of other stud-
ies showing that the surgeon’s gender doesn’t matter to 
most patients.9-13,19,21 Instead, studies have shown that 
other qualities matter, like demeanor, thoroughness, and 
humanity.10,30 When choosing a thoracic surgeon, patients 
prefer someone assertive and independent, but for a breast 
surgeon, they prefer a more communicative doctor.10 In 
our study, gender preferences disappeared when patients 
knew enough about a doctor to request him or her by 
name, a finding aligned with these other studies showing 
that a surgeon’s personal qualities matter more to patients 
than does gender.
A patient who doesn’t know of a surgeon’s personal 
qualities may base surgeon choice on qualities gen-
erally associated more with one gender more than the 
other. Rather than ranking one gender as better or worse 
than the other, these qualities may simply indicate a 
difference. Among primary care and urology patients, 
most women preferred a female doctor, and most men 
preferred a male doctor,17 which suggests a search for 
gender concordance. Bertakis et al speculated that tradi-
tional male-female relationship dynamics may make an 
encounter between a female physician and male patient 
less comfortable for both partners than one between a 
male physician and a female patient or one in which the 
genders are the same.22
In this study, 26% of patients preferred a female doctor 
and 1% preferred a male. Given our female patient popu-
lation, this finding may indicate a search for gender con-
cordance.12,17 Our results would likely have been different 
had more patients been men. As the number of men hav-
ing cosmetic surgery increases,1 male plastic surgeons may 
want to create website content and marketing materials to 
meet this rising demand.36
Of the 27% of patients who had a gender preference, 
96% requested a female surgeon. However, given all 
the other factors patients consider in choosing a plastic 
surgeon,3-8 this factor likely plays a small role in patient 
choice. If it played a large role, we might expect female 
plastic surgeons to earn more than their male counter-
parts, but on average they earn less.37
Of the 27% who requested a specific surgeon, slightly 
more requested the male surgeon than requested the 
female, indicating that a preference for gender concor-
dance may disappear when a patient feels confident in a 
plastic surgeon’s reputation.
This study had several limitations: It was conducted 
within a single 100% aesthetic practice with few male 
patients; results may differ in a different demographic. 
Patient choice may also vary by other factors, such as 
geographic region, surgeon age, and surgeon ethnicity. 
Callers may have considered gender preference only after 
a choice was offered, and their level of conviction cannot 
be determined from this study, since it did not incorporate 
a graded metric, such as a Likert scale. Furthermore, this 
study didn’t ask patients to rank the importance of the 
surgeon’s gender relative to other factors, such as board 
certification, years of experience, physician demeanor, 
online reviews, and the method of referral, all of which 
are reported to be important in a patient’s choice.3-9,38-40

Additionally, while the number of patients interested in 
breast and body numbered nearly 100 or more, those inter-
ested in face and genital surgery were fewer. To compare 
patient gender preference according to areas of interest 
would require a larger study.
Despite these limitations, this study is the first to inves-
tigate patient gender preference in the choice of plastic 
surgeon. The findings indicate that most patients have no 
gender preference, but if they do, most prefer a female doc-
tor, which is consistent with similar studies done in other 
specialties, particularly among female patients.
Within the field of plastic surgery, women comprise 
only 14% of plastic surgeons, but they make up 37% of 
current trainees.35 The results of this study indicate that 
female patients seeking gender concordance in their sur-
geons will welcome the increasing number of women 
entering plastic surgery.
In a campaign to combat the stereotype that surgeons are 
men, female surgeons have posted photos of themselves on 
social media with the hashtags “#ILookLikeASurgeon”41,42 
and “#ILookLikeAPlasticSurgeon.” Similarly, greater pub-
lic visibility of women plastic surgeons’ faces and voices 
on behalf of professional societies may help potential 
patients, particularly women, find a connection with the 
specialty. On the other hand, as more men seek plastic 
surgery, plastic surgery organizations and individual plas-
tic surgeons, particularly men, may consider offering more 
educational materials for the male patient.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study of 200 prospective aesthetic surgery patients, 
all of whom were women, some preferred a female doc-
tor, very few preferred a male, and most patients had no 
preference. However, when patients requested a specific 
doctor, slightly more requested the male surgeon than the 
female surgeon, indicating that a surgeon’s reputation is 
far more important than his or her gender.
