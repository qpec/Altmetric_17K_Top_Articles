concentration limits for drivers on the rates of road traffic 
accidents and alcohol consumption: a natural experiment

Summary
Background Drink driving is an important risk factor for road traffic accidents (RTAs), which cause high levels of 
morbidity and mortality globally. Lowering the permitted blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for drivers is a common 
public health intervention that is enacted in countries and jurisdictions across the world. In Scotland, on Dec 5, 2014, 
the BAC limit for drivers was reduced from 0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of this 
change on RTAs and alcohol consumption.
Methods In this natural experiment, we used an observational, comparative interrupted time-series design by use of 
data on RTAs and alcohol consumption in Scotland (the interventional group) and England and Wales (the control 
group). We obtained weekly counts of RTAs from police accident records and we estimated weekly off-trade (eg, in 
supermarkets and convenience stores) and 4-weekly on-trade (eg, in bars and restaurants) alcohol consumption from 
market research data. We also used data from automated traffic counters as denominators to calculate RTA rates. We 
estimated the effect of the intervention on RTAs by use of negative binomial panel regression and on alcohol 
consumption outcomes by use of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. Our primary outcome 
was weekly rates of RTAs in Scotland, England, and Wales. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN38602189.
Findings We assessed the weekly rate of RTAs and alcohol consumption between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2016, before 
and after the BAC limit came into effect on Dec 5, 2014. After the reduction in BAC limits for drivers in Scotland, we 
found no significant change in weekly RTA rates after adjustment for seasonality and underlying temporal trend 
(rate ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·94–1·08; p=0.77) or after adjustment for seasonality, the underlying temporal trend, and 
the driver characteristics of age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation (1·00, 0·96–1·06; p=0·73). Relative to RTAs in 
England and Wales, where the reduction in BAC limit for drivers did not occur, we found a 7% increase in weekly 
RTA rates in Scotland after this reduction in BAC limit for drivers (1·07, 1·02–1·13; p=0·007 in the fully-adjusted 
model). Similar findings were observed for serious or fatal RTAs and single-vehicle night-time RTAs. The change in 
legislation in Scotland was associated with no change in alcohol consumption, measured by per-capita off-trade sales 
(–0·3%, –1·7 to 1·1; p=0·71), but a 0·7% decrease in alcohol consumption measured by per-capita on-trade sales 
(–0·7%, –0·8 to –0·5; p<0·0001).
Interpretation Lowering the driving BAC limit to 0·05 g/dL from 0·08 g/dL in Scotland was not associated with a 
reduction in RTAs, but this change was associated with a small reduction in per-capita alcohol consumption from on-
trade alcohol sales. One plausible explanation is that the legislative change was not suitably enforced—for example 
with random breath testing measures. Our findings suggest that changing the legal BAC limit for drivers in isolation 
does not improve RTA outcomes. These findings have significant policy implications internationally as several 
countries and jurisdictions consider a similar reduction in the BAC limit for drivers.

Introduction
Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are a major public health 
problem, with 1·25 million road traffic deaths globally in 
2013.1 In Great Britain, there have been large reductions 
in RTAs over recent decades, including a 72% reduction 
in fatal RTAs observed between 1979 and 2017
. However, 
RTAs remain a considerable burden on health: in 2017, 
170 993 casualties from RTAs were reported.2 Driving 
under the influence of alcohol is a major risk factor for 
RTAs, and a dose-response relation is observed between 
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and RTAs. It has been 
estimated that the odds of fatal injury increase by 1·74 for 
every 0·02% increase in BAC.3 In the UK in 2016, there 
were at least 6070 RTAs involving a driver with a BAC 
over the legal limit.4
Since Norway introduced a legal BAC limit for driving 
in 1936, other countries across Europe, North America, 
Japan, and Australasia have also introduced BAC limits

for driving,5 initially by introducing a standard BAC limit 
(of 0·05 g/dL, 0·08 g/dL, or 0·1 g/dL) and with some 
countries further lowering the limit. In Europe, only 
England, Wales, and Malta have a 0·08 g/dL BAC limit 
for drivers. These limits are the norm in many other 
jurisdictions, including many states in the USA, despite 
longstanding calls for reductions in the BAC limit 
for drivers. According to European Commission recom-
mendations,6 BAC limits should be set at 0·05 g/dL. 
The British Road Safety Act introduced a legal limit of 
0·08 g/dL in 1967, which is still in effect today. An 
exception to this law exists in Scotland, where the BAC 
limit was reduced to 0·05 g/dL on Dec 5, 2014.
The effectiveness of reducing BAC limits has 
been estimated in countries and jurisdictions within 
countries that have changed legislation to deter so-
called drink driving, which we define as driving with a 
BAC in excess of the legal limit, to prevent RTAs. 
Evaluations of the effects of a reduction in driving BAC 
limits in different parts of the world, such as Australia,7 
France,8 Austria,9 and Serbia10 provide evidence that 
such legislation is effective in reducing RTAs. A 2017 
meta-analysis11 estimated that a standardised reduction 
in the BAC limit is associated with a 5% decrease in 
non-fatal alcohol-related traffic accidents, and a reduc-
tion to 0·05 g/dL is associated with an 11% decrease in 
fatal alcohol-related crashes.
In an interrupted time-series study7 with a main focus on 
the evaluation of random breath testing, Henstridge and 
colleagues assessed the effects of a reduction in BAC limit 
from 0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL in New South Wales and 
Queensland, Australia. These changes in BAC limit for 
drivers were effected in December, 1980 (New South Wales), 
and December, 1982 (Queensland), and the evaluation was 
not confounded by random breath testing because this 
measure was introduced at a later time. The study reported 
reductions of 7% in the number of severe RTAs and of 
8% in the number of fatal RTAs in New South Wales, 
whereas reductions of 14% in severe RTAs and of 18% in 
fatal RTAs were reported in Queensland. In a differences-
in-differences analysis of data from 15 European countries 
in 1991–2003, Albalate12 found that a BAC limit for drivers 
of 0·05 g/dL or lower was associated with a 4·5% reduction 
in road fatality rates with population denominators 
and with a 7·4% reduction in road fatality rates with 
per distance driven denominators compared with higher 
limits. Importantly, these effect sizes reduced to 3·4% 
(for population denominators) and 4·3% (for per distance 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are a major public health problem, 
with 1·25 million road traffic deaths globally in 2013. There is 
strong evidence that a person’s ability to drive a vehicle is 
impaired with alcohol in their bloodstream, and drink driving is 
an important risk factor of RTAs. There is a dose-response 
relationship between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and 
RTA rates, with evidence showing that the odds of fatal injury 
increase by 1·74 for every 0·02% increase in BAC. There is 
international evidence that the frequency of severe and fatal 
RTAs reduce when a country or region changes the legal BAC 
limit from 0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL. However, these studies have 
limitations, including confounding of the effect of this BAC 
intervention by those of other interventions (such as random 
breath testing) and by poor study design (eg, before-and-after 
studies that do not account for temporal trends, the absence of 
a control group, and a low frequency of time-series data). 
To summarise the highest quality evidence, a European study 
that analysed data from 15 countries found that an equivalent 
legislation change was associated with a 7·4% reduction in road 
fatalities (decreasing to 4·3% after adjustment for random 
breath testing). An earlier study that evaluated legislation 
change in two Australian states in the early 1980s found a 
similar effect size in one state and 14–18% reductions in severe 
and fatal RTAs in the other. We searched the international 
scientific literature to identify papers and reports that evaluated 
either an introduction of BAC limit legislation or evaluated a 
lowering of a BAC limit. We searched PubMed for related papers 
published before June 19, 2018, with the search terms “blood 
alcohol concen*”, “drink AND driving”, “lowering BAC limit”, 
and “breath test*”, with no language restrictions.
Added value of this study
Our findings indicate that the reduction in Scotland’s drink-drive 
limit in December, 2014 did not have the intended effect of 
reducing RTAs. This reduction in the BAC limit for drivers 
decreased alcohol consumption from on-trade alcohol sales 
(eg, in bars and restaurants) by less than 1% but did not affect 
alcohol consumption from off-trade sales (eg, from supermarkets 
and convenience stores), which account for approximately 
three-quarters of total sales. We evaluated the effects of a change 
in drink-drive legislation from a BAC limit of 0·08 g/dL 
to 0·05 g/dL in an entire population, which reduced the risk of 
selection biases. This new evidence is important because the 
larger effect sizes seen historically might be more difficult to 
obtain in an era of improved road safety and, regardless of BAC 
limits, where drink driving is increasingly socially unacceptable.
Implications of all the available evidence
This drink-drive limit change occurred in the context of a lack 
of additional police enforcement and without random breath 
testing measures in place. Our finding of no effect of the 
intervention of reducing the BAC driving limit from 
0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL supports the hypothesis that enhanced 
enforcement might be necessary to improve RTA outcomes. 
However, further research is required to test whether 
appropriate enforcement of a change in drink-drive legislation 
from a BAC limit of 0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL would improve 
outcomes.

driven denominators), and they were no longer statistically 
significant after adjusting for random breath testing.
If any BAC intervention effect is homogeneous across 
the population under study then such an intervention 
could affect absolute inequalities in RTAs that are 
associated with socioeconomic deprivation: alcohol 
intake is positively associated with the probability of 
drink driving,13 and greater socioeconomic deprivation is 
associated with greater alcohol intake per drinker14 but 
also with lower amounts of driving.
It has been hypothesised that alcohol consumption at a 
population level (ie, per-capita alcohol consumption) is 
asso 
ciated with driving under the influence of alcohol.15 
If correct, an unintended outcome of a change in BAC 
legislation could be a reduction in per-capita alcohol 
consumption.
We aimed to evaluate whether lowering the permitted 
BAC when driving from 0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL in 
Scotland had an effect on the rate of RTAs and population-
level alcohol consumption. Further, we evaluated whether 
any effects varied by level of socioeconomic deprivation. 
Our study design allowed us to isolate the effect of 
changing the legal BAC limit when driving and to assess 
the sole effect of a change in legislation without any 
enhanced law enforcement measures such as random 
breath testing. An appropriate control was provided by 
neighbouring countries (England and Wales) to the 
intervention country (Scotland). To our knowledge, no 
previous study has evaluated whether a legislation 
change of BAC limit for drivers has led to a reduction in 
that country’s drinking at a population level. These 
matters are of significant policy importance as other 
countries and jurisdictions across the world consider 
similar lowering of BAC limits for drivers.
Methods
Study design
In this natural experiment, we used a comparative 
interrupted time-series design with data before and after 
the introduction of the lower BAC limit on Dec 5, 2014. 
The interventional group, where the intervention was 
introduced, was Scotland, and the control group, where 
the BAC limit for drivers had not changed, was England 
and Wales.
Procedures and outcomes
Our primary outcome was the weekly rates of RTAs in 
Scotland, England, and Wales. The primary outcome was 
weekly RTA rates rather than counts, because this measure 
allows for a differences-in-differences type analysis of 
effect size. Weekly counts of RTAs that occurred on public 
roads in the UK and were reported to the police (by use 
of the STATS19 accident reporting form) were obtained 
upon request from the Department of Transport. Any 
given accident could involve more than one driver and 
casualty, but we considered an accident to be the most 
appropriate unit for analysis. To calculate weekly RTA 
rates, the number of miles driven by each person at risk 
of having an RTA would be the ideal denominator, but 
these data are not available. As a proxy for this measure, 
data from automatic traffic counters16 which continually 
count vehicles that pass over them were used. Approx-
imately 300 automatic traffic counters are placed to be 
representative of the entire UK road network, including 
motorways, major roads (that provide large-scale transport 
linkage), and minor roads (that feed traffic between major 
roads and smaller roads). We accounted for poor quality or 
missing traffic count data by use of a multiple imputation 
approach that is specifically designed for time-series data.17
In the STATS19 form, the severity of an RTA is recorded 
as the most severely injured casualty—namely the 
categories of fatal, serious, or slight injuries. To facilitate 
comparison with previous studies, and because it can be 
argued that serious and fatal RTAs are more likely to 
result from drink driving, we used weekly serious or fatal 
RTA rates as a secondary outcome. We tested the 
sensitivity of combining serious with fatal RTAs by 
modelling each outcome separately. As an additional 
outcome that was likely to result from drink driving, we 
used single-vehicle night-time RTAs and the ratio of 
single-vehicle night-time to multiple vehicle day-time 
RTAs as secondary outcomes, and we also assessed multi-
vehicle day-time RTA outcomes alone.
The final secondary outcome measure, alcohol con-
sumption, was assessed by the volume of pure alcohol 
sold per-capita in off-trade and on-trade alcohol retail 
sales. This is a high-quality measure that is not reliant on 
individual self-reporting, which is prone to bias. These 
data were provided by NHS Health Scotland for the period 
2013–16, who obtained them from the market research 
company Nielsen.18 Off-trade alcohol sales (from retailers 
licensed to sell alcohol for consumption away from the 
premises, such as supermarkets and convenience stores) 
were available in weekly units, but on-trade alcohol sales 
(from retailers licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on 
the premises, such as bars and restaurants) were only 
available in 4-weekly units. We used a linear interpolation 
method to impute weekly on-trade sales. Per-capita 
estimates were obtained by dividing the total volume 
of pure alcohol sold by adult (aged 16 years and older) 
population size for Scotland, and England and Wales 
combined.
Statistical analysis
To assess the comparability of the interventional and 
control groups, we compared age, sex, and socioeconomic 
deprivation between people involved in RTAs in these 
groups. When the RTA involved more than one vehicle, 
the oldest age group, the most frequent sex, and the 
highest socioeconomic deprivation level (which was 
generated from their postcode) of the drivers involved in 
the accident was used for analysis. We used an area-based 
measure of socioeconomic deprivation levels separately 
for Scotland and for England and Wales. Socioeconomic

deprivation was measured by use of the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation that was provided by Scottish and UK 
Governments.19–21 As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated 
our analyses with the opposite rules of demographic 
assignment (the youngest age group, the least frequent 
sex, and the lowest socioeconomic deprivation level of the 
drivers).
To test for a change in RTA counts and rates after the 
new legislation was in place, we separately fitted negative 
binomial regression models to panel data sets for the 
interventional and control groups. To model RTA rates, 
traffic flows were used as the denominator. We adjusted 
the models for underlying temporal trend by fitting a 
covariate representing the week number, and we adjusted 
for seasonality by use of covariates representing 4-weekly 
periods of the year (which generated 13 months). The 
models were then further adjusted for age, sex, and 
socioeconomic deprivation of the drivers involved in 
the RTAs. To obtain a differences-in-differences type 
measure of effect, we appended the two panel data sets, 
and we assessed an interaction term between interventional 
group covariate and the binary covariate to indicate the 
pre-change and post-change in legislation (with a so-called 
pseudo change for control). In this differences-in-
differences type model, an interaction term between week 
number and the interventional group indicator allowed 
for a relaxation of the usual differences-in-differences 
parallel trends assumption. We tested whether socio-
economic deprivation moderated any effect of the law 
change on total RTA rates by including an interaction term 
between the interventional group indicator and socio-
economic deprivation in our statistical models.
We separately fitted time-series seasonal autoregressive 
integrated moving average (SARIMA) models for off-trade 
and on-trade alcohol sales and for the interventional and 
control groups. SARIMA was considered the best model 
choice to account for the very strong seasonality in the 
alcohol consumption outcome. Logarithms of the outcome 
measures were used in our models to reduce the variability 
in the time series and to aid interpretation. We identified 
the form of the autocorrelation for the SARIMA errors 
from autocorrelation plots and partial autocorrelation 
plots. SARIMA was designed, for both interventional and 
control groups, in four different formats. Off-trade sales 
models controlled for off-trade sales of the other group, on-
trade sales of the same group, and trend. Similarly, on-
trade sales models controlled for on-trade sales of the other 
group, off-trade sales of the same group, and trend. We 
tested for residual correlation with correlograms to ensure 
that final models had a good fit with so-called white noise 
normally-distributed residuals (ie, residuals without serial 
correlation).
We used a statistical significance threshold of 0·05 
throughout. We did all analyses with Stata/SE version 14.2 
software. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN38602189.

Results
We assessed the weekly rate of RTAs, the rates of serious 
and fatal RTAs, single-vehicle night-time RTAs, and 
alcohol consumption in Scotland and England and Wales 
between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2016, before and after the 
BAC limit came into effect in Scotland on Dec 5, 2014. The 
age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation characteristics of 
drivers involved in the RTAs are shown in table 1. The 
distributions of these characteristics were very similar 
between drivers in RTAs in Scotland and those in England 
and Wales, which remained consistent in the sensitivity 
analysis that used the opposite demographic assignment 
rule (appendix). The mean number of drivers (and 
vehicles) per RTA was 1·72 (SD 0·73) in Scotland and

1·84 (0·71) in England and Wales. The corresponding 
number of casualties (ie, the number of people either 
killed or injured) per RTA was 1·29 (0·77) in Scotland and 
1·33 (0·82) in England and Wales.
Weekly RTA counts and rates relative to the date at 
which the reduction in the BAC limit for drivers was 
introduced are shown in figure 1. Between Jan 1, 2013, 
and Dec 31, 2016, the weekly RTA counts in Scotland 
were generally in the range of 100–200 RTAs, and the 
weekly counts in England and Wales were in the range 
1500–2750 RTAs. Weekly RTA rates were higher in 
England and Wales than in Scotland during the study 
period; generally, there were 5–9 RTAs per 1000 traffic 
count in Scotland and 6–10 RTAs per 1000 traffic count 
in England and Wales. The weekly serious or fatal 
RTA counts in Scotland were typically in the range of 
10–45 RTAs, and the weekly serious or fatal RTA counts in 
England and Wales were in the range of 200–450 RTAs. 
By contrast, during the 4 years of the study, the weekly 
rates of serious or fatal RTAs were comparable between 
groups. It is of note that, over the study period, fatal RTAs 
represented 1·9% of all RTAs in Scotland and 1·1% of all 
RTAs in England and Wales. It was not possible to 
calculate weekly single-vehicle night-time rates because 
the time of day was not recorded by the traffic counters, 
but we were able to evaluate weekly single-vehicle 
night-time counts. The weekly single-vehicle night-time 
RTA counts in Scotland were mostly in the range of 
10–40 RTAs, and the weekly serious or fatal RTA counts in 
England and Wales were in the range of 130–275 RTAs.
We found that the reduction in BAC limit for drivers 
was not associated with a significant change in weekly 
RTA rates in Scotland, after adjustment for seasonality 
and underlying temporal trend (model c; rate ratio [RR] 
1·01, 95% CI 0·94–1·08; p=0·77; table 2). Further, relative 
to England and Wales, where the reduction in BAC limit 
for drivers did not occur, we found no change in weekly 
RTA rates after this reduction in BAC limit for drivers in 
Scotland (model c; 1·07, 0·98–1·17; p=0·10). Further 
adjustment for the driver characteristics of age, sex, and 
socioeconomic deprivation produced similar results, 
showing a significant 7% increase in weekly RTA rates in 
Scotland relative to England and Wales (model d; 1·07, 
1·02–1·13; p=0·007).
The differences-in-differences type estimate for the 
rates of serious or fatal RTAs indicated no significant 
difference in the intervention effect for Scotland relative 
to England and Wales both when adjusting for seasonality

and underlying temporal trend (model g; RR 1·04, 
95% CI 0·90–1·19; p=0·59; table 2), and when also 
adjusting for the driver characteristics of age, sex, and 
socioeconomic deprivation (model h; 1·04, 0·92–1·17; 
p=0·54). In a sensitivity analysis, we found similar 
results when modelling the rates of serious and fatal 
RTAs separately (appendix). For single-vehicle night-time 
RTA counts, the models showed no significant difference 
in Scotland (model j; 0·99, 0·87–1·15; p=0·99) but 
indicated a significant psuedo-intervention effect in 
England and Wales (model i; 0·93, 0·88–0·99; p=0·03) 
after the reduction in the BAC limit for drivers. 
Adjustment for age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation 
did not have a significant effect on these results (table 2), 
and nor did changing the demographic assignment rule 
(appendix). Further, we observed similar null effects for 
Scotland when we modelled single-vehicle night-time 
relative to multi-vehicle day-time and multi-vehicle-alone 
outcomes (appendix). We found no evidence of effect 
modification by socioeconomic deprivation for total RTA 
rates (appendix).
The weekly off-trade and on-trade per capita alcohol 
sales during the study are shown in figure 2. We found 
strong seasonal patterning in alcohol sales, with large 
peaks at the end of the calendar year and smaller troughs 
at the start of the calendar year. The change in legislation 
in Scotland was associated with no significant change in

p=0·71) but a 0·7% decrease in per-capita on-trade sales 
(–0·7%, –0·8 to –0·5; p<0·0001). The corresponding

in England and Wales indicated significant increases in 
per-capita on-trade sales (0·7%, 0·5 to 0·8; p<0·0001) but

Discussion
We found that lowering the BAC limit for drivers from 
0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL in Scotland did not decrease the 
rate of RTAs in the first 2 years after this legislation change. 
Our negative findings for total, serious or fatal, and single-
vehicle night-time RTAs were unexpected given previous 
evidence that generally supports a reduction of RTAs after 
reducing the BAC limit for drivers. The 95% CIs of our 
results (table 2) do not include effect sizes of the magnitude 
that were reported by Henstridge and colleagues7 or 
Albalate.12 We found no evidence of an effect of this 
intervention on off-trade alcohol sales, and these sales 
account for a large proportion of alcohol consumption in 
Scotland (73% of total alcohol sales in 2017).22 We did 
observe a small reduction (of less than 1%) in on-trade 
alcohol sales, and further research is underway to explore 
perceptions of the effects of the change in the BAC limit 
for drivers from the perspectives of owners and managers 
of on-trade establishments.
Our study used a well designed natural experiment, 
with England and Wales providing a counterfactual for 
RTA and alcohol consumption trends in the absence of 
the BAC intervention. The same data sources were used 
for both Scotland and England and Wales, which helped 
to reduce measurement error. The distribution of 
demographic characteristics was very similar between 
the drivers in RTAs in Scotland and those in England 
and Wales, which further validates the appropriateness 
of the control group. With our large nationally repre-
sentative data sets and with 2 years of weekly data points 
before and after the legislation change, these data had 
high statistical power, resulting in good precision around 
effect size estimates. The long follow-up means that it is 
unlikely that we have missed any lagged effect of the 
intervention.
Our study has limitations; first, we were unable to use 
alcohol-related RTAs as an outcome measure. BAC levels 
in drivers or riders involved in RTAs are often not available 
or are unreliable.7 For example, in the UK, only half of all 
drivers or riders involved in RTAs are breath tested by 
police23 and, for fatal RTAs, there are often long delays in 
attaining BAC from coroners’ reports, and BAC naturally 
reduces with time. Moreover, in the STATS19 form, the 
BAC of the driver is not recorded; more crudely, whether 
the reading was in excess of the BAC limit is recorded. 
These data would present a methodological challenge 
since the limit changed in Scotland. Second, we have not 
adjusted for potential temporally confounding factors, 
such as weather and road quality. These factors would 
only be important if they were substantially different in 
the interventional and control groups, and we do not think 
this is likely. Further, we are not aware of any other 
concurrent interventions that were being used in Scotland 
and not in England and Wales, or vice versa. Third, we 
acknowledge that not all RTAs will become known to the 
police,24 and many casualties of RTAs who attend hospital 
will not be recorded in STATS19 forms. However, these 
omissions would only bias our results if they differed 
between the interventional groups, which is unlikely. 
Finally, the traffic flow denominators obtained from 
automatic traffic counters are a proxy for distance travelled 
by each person at risk of having an RTA, and there were 
data quality issues with the denominator that we used for 
the rates (which were addressed by multiple imputation); 
however, these traffic flow counts are superior to use of a 
population denominator because they more accurately 
reflect those at risk of RTAs. Moreover, although the 
location of the (approximately) 300 automatic traffic 
counters across the UK are placed to be broadly repre-
sentative of the entire road network, they provide only a 
set of point estimates. Nevertheless, they provide good 
data on how traffic flows vary on a temporal basis and it is 
notable that the effect sizes we obtained from models 
using them closely match the results from modelling RTA 
counts (table 2).
The most plausible explanation of our finding of no 
effect of the reduced BAC limit for drivers on RTA 
outcome is that this limit was insufficiently enforced 
or publicised or both. A European Union strategy to 
support member states in reducing alcohol-related harm 
stated that a key to the success of drink-drive legislation 
after its introduction is the enforce 
ment of frequent and 
systematic random breath testing, supported by public 
education, publicity, and aware 
ness campaigns that 
involve all stakeholders.25 Further, previous research9 
supports an association between increased enforcement 
and decreased RTAs. Random breath testing is recog-
nised as the principal drink driving law enforcement 
strategy. Most of the decrease in alcohol-related traffic 
injuries and fatalities in Australia, for instance, has been 
attributed to the implementation of random breath 
tests.26,27 There is evidence that enforcement of BAC 
limits for drivers has reduced in the UK, with English 
police force data28 showing 25% fewer breath tests in 
2015 compared with 2011. In Scotland, the initial 
investment in public education and media campaigning 
at the time of the limit reduction in December, 2014 was 
not maintained in the subsequent years. Other 
explanations are, first, that the majority of drink driving 
RTAs (RTAs caused by drivers with a BAC in excess of 
the legal limit) might be caused by people who continue 
to ignore the law under the new legislation, or that 
people who previously used to drink-drive between 
the new and old limits have changed their behaviours 
but are responsible for only a small fraction of all 
RTAs. Second, it could be that larger effect sizes seen

historically for BAC lowering interventions might be 
more difficult to achieve in an era of improved road 
safety and where drink driving is increasingly socially 
unacceptable. Finally, it could be that RTAs that are not 
related to alcohol have increased in Scotland during the 
study period, masking an intervention effect; however, 
given the modelling results, we think this explanation is 
unlikely. Further research exploring these and other 
possible explanations for the findings is needed.
Our findings indicate that the reduction in Scotland’s 
BAC limit for drivers in December, 2014 did not have the 
intended effect of reducing RTAs. This limit reduction 
was associated with a reduction in on-trade alcohol sales 
by less than 1%, but there was no change in off-trade sales 
(which account for approximately three-quarters of total 
sales). This finding suggests that a reduction in BAC 
limit from 0·08 g/dL to 0·05 g/dL is not effective in 
reducing RTAs without being accompanied by other 
measures, such as enhanced enforcement. Our findings 
have important policy implications internationally as 
several countries and jurisdictions consider a similar 
reduction in BAC limit for drivers.
