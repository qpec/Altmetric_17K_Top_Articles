Nanotechnology has opened up a new, previously unimaginable world in cancer diagnosis 
and therapy, leading to the emergence of cancer nanomedicine and nanoparticle-aided 
radiotherapy. Smart nanomaterials (nanoparticle drones) can now be constructed with 
capability to precisely target cancer cells and be remotely activated with radiation to 
emit micrometer-range missile-like electrons to destroy the tumor cells. These nanopar-
ticle drones can also be programmed to deliver therapeutic payloads to tumor sites to 
achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. In this article, we examine the state-of-the-art and 
potential of nanoparticle drones in targeting lung cancer. Inhalation (INH) (air) versus tra-
ditional intravenous (“sea”) routes of navigating physiological barriers using such drones 
is assessed. Results and analysis suggest that INH route may offer more promise for 
targeting tumor cells with radiosensitizers and cannabinoids from the perspective of 
maximizing damage to lung tumors cells while minimizing any collateral damage or side 
effects.

Nanomedicine, the application of nanotechnology to medicine, has opened a new, previously 
unimaginable world in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Today new multifunctional nanoplatforms or 
smart nanomaterials (nanoparticle drones) can be constructed and endowed with image contrast 
enhancement capabilities for techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) (1, 2) and can contain therapeutic payloads programmed for targeted delivery 
to disease sites (3). The vision of combining diagnostics and therapeutics, now being referred to as 
theranostics, was considered futuristic only a few years ago but is now clearly achievable—the future 
is almost now!
Recognizing the potential impact of nanomedicine, the National Cancer Institute created the 
Alliance for Cancer Nanotechnology to leverage the potential of nanotechnology toward transform-
ing the way cancer is diagnosed, treated, or prevented. Projects funded by this Alliance have led 
to significant research breakthroughs and have even entered successful clinical trials (4). Today, 
cancer nanomedicine now includes burgeoning research and development in nanoparticle-aided 
radiotherapy (NRT). A recent article (5) provides a robust review of NRT developments for over 
a decade in NRT with gold nanoparticles (GNPs), highlighting emerging approaches, challenges, 
and opportunities for further research toward clinical translation. Beyond GNP, other research

Nanoparticles to Target Lung Cancer
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org

has highlighted the use of alternative nanoparticle platforms 
like gadolinium nanoparticles (6, 7), hafnium nanoparticles (8), 
platinum-based chemotherapy drug platforms, and others with 
theranostic capability (9, 10).
In general, the key goal for NRT and cancer drug develop-
ment efforts is the same, which is to optimize therapeutic effi-
cacy/ratio. To this end, recent advances in the design of smart 
nanomaterials proffer tremendous potential toward realizing 
this goal. Such smart materials (11) are specifically designed 
to be sensitive to a specific stimulus, such as temperature, 
magnetic field, ultrasound intensity, light or radiation, and pH, 
and to then respond in active ways including radiosensitization 
or changing their structure for drug delivery, or other func-
tions that have the potential to cogently enhance treatment 
outcomes.
Gold nanoparticles provide an excellent template for building 
such nanoparticle drones. They are biocompatible radiosensitiz-
ers (5), proffering relatively no toxicity. They can readily interact 
with photons by the photoelectric effect, to emit missile-like 
photoelectrons or Auger electrons in the micrometer range, to 
substantially boost RT damage to cancer cells. In the photo-
electric effect, photons interact with the nanomaterials, with the 
probability of photoelectric interaction inversely proportional 
to the cube of the photon energy (5). Once the photoelectron is 
emitted, this creates a vacancy that may be filled by an electron 
from a higher energy level. The resulting release of energy could 
then also knockout Auger electrons. The Auger electrons are 
shorter range and with high linear energy transfer, so can lead 
to highly localized damage. Such highly localized damage to 
tumor cells can allow minimization of the primary radiotherapy 
dose and hence normal tissue toxicity. Nanoplatforms such as 
GNPs are also particularly attractive for building nanoparticle 
drones because they can provide CT and photoacoustic imaging 
contrast and are suitable for drug loading and attaching targeting 
moieties. Depending on surface functionalization, type of drug, 
and desired application, GNPs can be easily loaded with drugs 
or other molecules through either non-covalent interactions or 
covalent conjugation. Loading of drugs onto GNPs may improve 
their stability and biodistribution in biological media since the 
drugs are protected in the carrier. In short, multifunctional 
nanoparticle drones based on GNPs hold great promise in cancer 
nanomedicine.
cHALLeNGes AND OPPOrtUNities iN 
cANcer NANOMeDiciNe AND Nrt
Despite advances in cancer nanomedicine, a major challenge is 
to ensure that a sufficiently potent concentration of the nano-
particles or drug payload reaches the disease site with minimal 
systemic or off-target toxicities. In general, nanomedicine holds 
advantage over conventional medicine because the enhanced 
permeability and retention effect allows preferential delivery of 
payloads to tumor sites, and the ability to sustainably release 
such payloads overtime once they reach the tumors. The chal-
lenge to deliver sufficiently potent payloads is particularly 
relevant for external beam NRT (5), with a lower fraction of 
kilovolt energy photons, which can interact with nanoparticles 
to activate the emission of micrometer-range electrons. The 
challenge to deliver potent concentrations of drug payloads with 
minimal side effects is particularly relevant to delivery of drugs 
like cannabinoids whose clinical translation has been hampered 
by the psychotic side effects (12). New treatment strategies are, 
therefore, needed to overcome these challenges and improve 
therapeutic efficacy, allowing enhanced tumor cell killing while 
sparing normal tissue.
PersPectives
One strategy to consider is the route by which nanoparticle 
drones with radiosensitizers or drugs can navigate physiological 
barriers to reach the tumor with minimal systemic toxicities. This 
will depend on the tumor site. One tumor site that could sig-
nificantly benefit from new strategies is lung cancer, the leading 
cause of cancer deaths. Two key routes for targeting nanoparticle 
drones to lung tumors are inhalation (INH or “air”) route and 
intravenous (IV or “sea”) route, i.e., through the blood stream.
Previous studies show that administering nanoparticles via IV 
route may result in up to 5% nanoparticles reaching the lung, com-
pared to 3.5–14.6 times higher nanoparticle concentrations when 
administered via INH (13, 14). Taking this into account, we have 
previously investigated the potential for enhancing external beam 
radiotherapy for lung cancer using high-Z nanoparticles (made 
of gold or platinum-based chemotherapy drugs) administered via 
INH (15). The results of this work indicate that administering 
nanoparticles via the INH route could enable clinically significant 
damage enhancement to lung tumors compared to using IV 
routes of administration during external beam radiotherapy for 
lung cancer. Building on this work, we conducted additional 
experiments using nanoparticle drones based on GNP using 
transgenic mouse models.
The design of such nanoparticle drones described in our previ-
ous work (16) particularly takes size and nanoparticle function-
alization into account. The size is optimized to ensure increased 
circulation and tumor uptake. Meanwhile, PEGylation confers 
stealth to the nanoparticle drones, thereby, also enabling longer 
circulation time for nanoparticles administered intravenously. 
Such longer circulation allows for higher amounts of nano-
particles to concentrate in the tumor. The hetero-bifunctional-
polyethylene glycol with amine, carboxyl, and methoxy ligands, 
also allows for conjugating various moieties such as imaging or 
targeting ligands, as well as radiosensitizers or drugs. The imaging 
capability of these nanoplatforms has already been demonstrated 
in vitro and in vivo (16). A number of recent efforts have also 
developed nanoparticle drone platforms, including biogenic 
GNPs (17, 18) and drug-loaded gold plasmonic nanoparticles 
(19, 20) for different applications. For lung tumors, the nanopar-
ticle drones are functionalized with RGD designed to target the 
integrin receptors on the lung tumor.
In experiments, transgenic mouse models bearing single-
nodule lung adenocarcinoma were employed, with features that 
closely resemble human lung tumors, as described in recent work 
(21). Nanoparticle drones were administered to Cohort A mice 
(n = 5) via INH (instillation), while the same concentration of

nanoparticle drones was administered to Cohort B (n = 5) mice 
via IV (Figure 1). The biodistribution of drones was measured via 
fluorescence imaging and ex vivo electron microcopy methods. 
Mice were dissected, and entire lungs were imaged 24 h post 
administration. The images were acquired with the same acquisi-
tion time of 88 ms for all the experiments. With spectral imaging 
software, small but meaningful spectral differences could be rap-
idly detected and analyzed. Spectral unmixing algorithms were 
employed to generate unmixed images of “pure” autofluorescence 
and “pure” fluorescence signal. A quantitative estimation of the 
fluorescence intensity was done using the Maestro software and 
Image J.
Meanwhile, transmission electron microscopy was carried 
out using a JEOL model JEM-1000 microscope at an accel-
eration voltage of 80 kV. The samples were prepared by drop 
casting method on the formvar coated copper grids. 1 mm3 
of lung tissues were fixed in 2.5% formaldehyde and 2.5% 
glutaraldehyde solution for few hours. The post fixation was 
carried out using 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h followed by 
dehydration in varying alcohol concentrations and overnight 
infiltration using Squetol resin. The polymerized resin with 
tissue was sectioned using ultramicrotome. The sections were 
placed on copper grids, and silver enhancement was done fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s recommendations. The grids were 
dried and imaged.
After each study, animals were euthanized by CO2 INH 
 
followed by cervical dislocation. Death was assured by harvesting 
tumor-bearing and other vital organs, including the cecum, liver, 
and lungs. All studies followed Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 
IACUC approved protocol.
The schematic (Figure 1A) illustrates the nanoparticle drone 
and the two different routes of administration in the transgenic 
lung tumor mouse model. The size of the nanoparticles as 
estimated by TEM (Figure 1B) showed fairly monodispersed 
nanoparticles of around 2–3 nm in diameter with spherical mor-
phology. The overall hydrodynamic diameter of the drones was 
approximately 12 nm as estimated by the dynamic light scattering 
measurements (data not shown). Meanwhile, Figure 1C shows 
the photophysical characteristics of the nanoparticle drones. As 
the figure shows, drones conjugated with AF647 showed a charac-
teristic fluorescence peak at λmax 650 nm with a slight bathochro-
mic shift of 5 nm. This can be attributed to slight aggregation or 
steric hindrance of the dye molecules after conjugation to PEG. 
The absorption studies showed a slight hump in the nanoparticle 
drone spectra at around 647 nm. However, a distinct absorption 
peak is masked due to higher degree of scattering by the GNP 
drones.
Figure 2 shows the comparative imaging studies with the 
nanoparticle drones administered via INH or IV routes at 
similar concentrations. The transgenic lung tumor model, which

we used for this study, develops tumor only in the left lung 
(21). Figures 2A,B show white light optical images of sample 
lung tumoral masses with drones reaching their target after 
administration via INH and IV, respectively. The corresponding 
fluorescent images are shown in Figures 2C,D, respectively. 
From these images, significantly higher fluorescence due to the 
drones was consistently observed for the left lung in case of INH 
administration compared to IV. This is further corroborated by 
the TEM images in Figures 3A,B for IV and Figures 3C,D for 
INH. Consistent with the findings from fluorescence imaging, the 
TEM images show nanoparticle drones abundantly distributed 
throughout the target tumor tissue in mice with INH route of 
delivery compared to sparse distribution in sample tissue sections 
of mice with IV route.
For more perspective, the pixel intensity for randomly selected 
regions of interests was quantified and compared. From the 
quantification, the drones reaching their target tumors via the 
INH (air) route were averagely about 4.8 ± 0.4 times higher, 
compared to IV (“sea”) route. This finding for nanoparticle 
drones is consistent with the previous studies showing that INH 
route provides 3.5–14.6 times higher nanoparticle concentrations 
compared to IV (13, 14). In our study, the nanoparticle drones 
can also be visualized penetrating into the tumor tissue. This 
can be attributed to the small size of drones (<100 nm), which 
facilitates enhanced diffusion and adsorption and also targeting 
by RGD peptide. Larger nanoparticles are known to deposit in the 
extrathoracic and bronchial region airways during inspiration. 
Altogether, the results support the perspective that nanoparticle 
drones administration via INH could lead to significantly higher 
targeting to lung tumors compared to IV routes. Our previous 
work (15) has showed that this could lead to a clinical significant 
radiotherapy boosting to lung tumor cells compared to IV routes.
POteNtiAL FOr cANNABiNOiDs
As discussed earlier, nanoparticle drones are particularly attrac-
tive because they can also be loaded with drugs payload like can-
nabinoids. Cannabinoids, which are the bioactive components of 
Cannabis sativa and their derivatives, may exert palliative effects 
in cancer patients by preventing nausea, vomiting, and pain 
and by stimulating appetite (12). Furthermore, studies indicate 
that cannabinoids can inhibit cancer cell growth in in vitro and 
in vivo. A Nature Reviews Cancer article (12) and other recently 
published work (22–24) highlight the potential of cannabinoids 
for treating cancer, working in synergy with radiotherapy and 
serving as radiosensitzers to enhance damage to lung tumor cells 
in particular. Consistent with this, our own experiments have 
confirmed the potential of cannabinoids in treating lung cancer, 
with results confirming that cannabinoids can enhance damage 
to cancer cells. In one study, the damage to lung tumor cells was 
found to be similar to that equivalent to 4 Gy of radiotherapy 
dose. Results indicate that the interaction can be synergistic with 
radiation. Such synergy with radiotherapy was seen when can-
nabinoid concentrations of 2 µg/ml were used. Previous studies 
have also shown synergistic interaction of cannabinoids with 
radiotherapy in vivo (23).
Despite this growing evidence with promising in vitro and 
in vivo studies, clinical translation of cannabinoids is severely 
limited by unwanted psychoactive side effects (12). Therefore, 
cannabinoid-based therapies or strategies that could circumvent 
these unwanted psychotic side effects are greatly needed. For lung 
cancer, the use of nanoparticle drones may provide an excellent 
strategy for highly targeted delivery of cannabinoid payloads to 
tumor cells to boost damage to the tumor cells and inhibit growth 
while minimizing the side effects that have hampered clinical 
translation.
In using cannabinoid-loaded nanoparticle drones, the can-
nabinoids can be readily conjugated to the amine groups present 
on the PEG on the surface of the GNPs (22, 25, 26). Recent work 
has also highlighted the use of cannabinoid-loaded polymer-based 
microparticles to inhibit tumor growth in a murine xenograft
 
model of glioblastoma multiforme (27). Such polymers can also 
be used for nanoparticle drones encapsulating cannabinoids for 
sustained delivery to tumor cells. In the work with microparticles, 
they were administered locally (28). For lung tumors, INH route 
provides advantage in delivering such cannabinoid payloads.

Alternative approaches to get cannabinoids to tumors include 
intratumoral administration (27). Such an approach will ensure 
virtually all the payload reaches the tumor. However, for lung 
tumors, this is an invasive procedure, which may generate sig-
nificant morbidities. Another approach could be via smoking. 
Unfortunately, smoking is already associated with lung cancer and 
other side effects (29), and smoking does not allow for any addi-
tional targeting of the cannabinoids to lung tumors as with tar-
geting moieties like RGD used on nanoparticle drones. However, 
comprehensive studies are needed to establish the envisioned 
advantage of using nanoparticle drones administered via INH.
Today, over 26 USA states, and an increasing number of 
countries have now legalized medical cannabis for treating 
different malignancies. The National Institutes of Health and 
World Health Organization encourage more research on medi-
cal cannabis for treating cancer, the side effects of radiotherapy 
or chemotherapy, and treatment of other diseases. With ever 
increasing interest in medical cannabis applications in the USA 
and around the world, and promising research results there is 
great need for more concerted cross-disciplinary research col-
laborations, including academic institution–industry collabora-
tions, which could accelerate medical cannabis research from 
bench to bedside.
cONcLUsiON
Overall, the use of nanoparticle drones administered via INH 
to enhance NRT, as highlighted in this article, may provide a 
good strategy for maximizing therapeutic efficacy in external 
beam NRT for lung cancer. Also there is growing evidence that 
cannabinoids can serve as radiosensitizers, enhance damage to 
tumor cells, slow tumor growth, and work synergistically with 
radiotherapy in cancer treatment. There is growing consensus 
of the need for more research in this direction, including

research to address unwanted psychoactive effects, which cur-
rently limit clinical translation. The use of nanoparticle drones 
via INH provides a promising strategy for consideration in 
overcoming this limitation by delivering sufficiently potent 
cannabinoids to lung tumors while minimizing toxicities or 
side effects. Ongoing studies are investigating the optimization 
of nanoparticle drones for highly efficacious targeting of lung 
tumors with radiosensitizers or cannabinoids while minimiz-
ing collateral damage or side effects. This perspective article 
should motivate more interdisciplinary collaborations and 
concerted research efforts in this direction toward advancing 
the promise of cancer nanomedicine to benefit patients with 
lung cancer.
