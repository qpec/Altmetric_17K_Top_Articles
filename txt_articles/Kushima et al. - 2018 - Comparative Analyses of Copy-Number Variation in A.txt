SUMMARY
Compelling
evidence
in
Caucasian
populations
suggests a role for copy-number variations (CNVs) in
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia
(SCZ). We analyzed 1,108 ASD cases, 2,458 SCZ
cases, and 2,095 controls in a Japanese population
and confirmed an increased burden of rare exonic
CNVs in both disorders. Clinically significant (or path-
ogenic) CNVs, including those at 29 loci common to
both disorders, were found in about 8% of ASD and
SCZ cases, which was significantly higher than in con-
trols. Phenotypic analysis revealed an association be-
tween clinically significant CNVs and intellectual
disability. Gene set analysis showed significant over-
lap of biological pathways in both disorders including
oxidative stress response, lipid metabolism/modifi-
cation, and genomic integrity. Finally, based on
bioinformatics analysis, we identified multiple dis-
ease-relevant genes in eight well-known ASD/SCZ-
associated CNVloci (e.g.,22q11.2, 3q29).Ourfindings
suggest an etiological overlap of ASD and SCZ and
provide biological insights into these disorders.

 shown that genetic factors contribute substantially to the etiol-
ogy of both disorders. Although ASD and SCZ are clinically
distinct disorders, available evidence suggests that genetic
overlap is present. These disorders co-occur at a higher rate
than would be expected in the general population (Chisholm
et al., 2015). A large epidemiological study showed that a family
history of SCZ in first-degree relatives is a risk factor for ASD
(Sullivan et al., 2012).
Molecular genetic studies suggest a role for rare copy-
number variations (CNVs) in ASD and SCZ. They have reported
an increased burden of de novo or rare CNVs in these disorders
(Huguet et al., 2013; Marshall et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2014). Rare
CNVs in specific loci have been identified as shared risk factors
for both disorders, including deletions at 1q21.1, 3q29, 15q11.2,
15q13.3, 17q12, and 22q11.2 and duplications at 7q11.23,
15q11.2-q13.1, and 16p11.2 (Doherty and Owen, 2014; Marshall
et al., 2017; Moreno-De-Luca et al., 2013; C Yuen et al., 2017).
Notably, these well-known ASD/SCZ-associated CNVs are
also implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders including
intellectual disability (ID) and attention deficit hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD). The molecular basis of variable phenotypic expres-
sivity of these CNVs remains poorly understood. Although these
pathogenic CNVs show incomplete penetrance, controls car-
rying such CNVs have mild cognitive impairment (Stefansson
et al., 2014). Gene set analyses of genes affected by CNVs
have implicated similar biological pathways in these disorders
including neuronal development, synapse function, and neuronal
cell adhesion (Huguet et al., 2013; Marshall et al., 2017; Pinto
et al., 2014; C Yuen et al., 2017). These pathways were also iden-
tified by exome sequencing studies (De Rubeis et al., 2014; Pur-
cell et al., 2014).
Despite important progress, the following issues remain to be
addressed. First, the majority of the previous CNV studies were
carried out in Caucasian populations, limiting the generalization
of pathogenic CNVs and relevant biological pathways to other
populations. Studies in populations other than Caucasians may

 also provide additional biological insights into the pathogenesis.
The clinical features of patients with pathogenic CNVs have not
been fully examined in non-Caucasian populations. Furthermore,
no studies have directly compared pathogenic CNVs and bio-
logical pathways between ASD and SCZ in non-Caucasian
populations. Second, identification of disease-relevant genes in
well-known ASD/SCZ-associated CNV loci (e.g., 22q11.2,
3q29) is still challenging because they are large and include
many genes, preventing elucidation of molecular pathogenesis.
In this study, we performed comparative CNV analyses of ASD
and SCZ in a Japanese population using high-resolution (>10 kb)
array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We identified
clinically significant (or pathogenic) CNVs and biological path-
ways in each disorder and observed their overlap between
ASD and SCZ. Phenotypic analysis revealed clinical characteris-
tics of patients carrying clinically significant CNVs. Finally, using
a bioinformatics approach, we identified disease-relevant genes
in eight well-known ASD/SCZ-associated CNV loci.
RESULTS
Identification and Validation of CNVs
Of the 1,132 ASD cases, 2,519 SCZ cases, and 2,110 controls
analyzed with aCGH (Table S1), 1,108 ASD cases (97.9%),
Figure 1. Workflow of This Study: CNV Dis-
covery, Quality Control, and Analysis
Abbreviations: aCGH, array comparative genomic
hybridization; CNV, copy-number variant; QC,
quality control; SCZ, schizophrenia.
2,458 SCZ cases (97.6%), and 2,095
controls (99.3%) passed our stringent
quality control (QC) filtering (Figure 1).
We obtained 14,959 rare (<1%) CNVs
from among all subjects (n = 5,661).
The median CNV size was 56.0 kb. About
50% and 70% of all CNVs were deletions
and small CNVs (<100 kb), respectively
(Table 1). We validated 99.7% (308/309)
of rare CNVs from Agilent arrays with
quantitative real-time PCR (Table S2).
Assessment of Confounding
Factors
In multiple linear regression analysis,
‘‘array
type’’
and
‘‘sex’’
influenced
genome-wide CNV burden (p < 0.05;
Table S3). Thus, we included ‘‘array
type’’ and ‘‘sex’’ as confounding factors
in the following analyses.
Genome-wide CNV Burden Analysis
Both ASD and SCZ cases had a signifi-
cantly greater genome-wide burden of
rare exonic CNVs than controls: Odds ra-
tios (ORs) of 1.09 (p = 0.0011, ASD) and
1.07 (p = 0.014, SCZ) per CNV; ORs of 1.05 (p = 1.0 3 10�5,
ASD) and 1.03 (p = 1.0 3 10�5, SCZ) per 100 kb affected by
CNVs (Table S4).
Identification and Association Analysis of Clinically
Significant CNVs
Overall, 89, 210, and 70 clinically significant CNVs were identi-
fied in ASD cases, SCZ cases, and controls, respectively
(Table 2; Table S5). In 29 of preselected 487 loci, clinically sig-
nificant CNVs were identified in both disorders: exonic CNVs
of 16 genes (e.g., ASTN2, MBD5), recurrent CNVs at 12 loci
(e.g., 7q11.23, 16p11.2), and 47,XXX. This overlap was sta-
tistically significant (p = 7.1 3 10�14, two-sided Fisher’s
exact test). Two clinically significant CNVs were detected
in three ASD cases and eight SCZ cases, but not in con-
trols. Thus, 7.8% (86/1,108) of ASD cases, 8.2% (202/2,458)
of SCZ cases, and 3.3% (70/2,095) of controls carried one or
two clinically significant CNVs, with a significant excess of
these CNVs in both types of cases compared to controls
(ASD: OR = 2.65, pcorrected = 2.0 3 10�5; SCZ: OR = 2.60,
pcorrected = 2.0 3 10�5).
For individual CNVs, nominally significant associations were
observed for deletions at 1q21.1 (OR = 11.65, puncorrected =
1.8 3 10�3), 22q11.21 (OR = 22.0, puncorrected = 1.2 3 10�4),
2840
Cell Reports 24, 2838–2856, September 11, 2018
 and 47,XXY/47,XXX (OR = 17.86, puncorrected = 7.4 3 10�3) in SCZ
and duplications at 22q11.21 (OR = 6.08, puncorrected = 0.011)
in ASD.
Identification of Candidate ASD/SCZ-Associated CNV
Loci
We identified 12 novel candidate CNV loci potentially associated
with ASD/SCZ in a Japanese population, in which significant
enrichment of exonic CNVs was observed in ASD/SCZ cases
versus controls: GALNT8, ASAP2, SPOCK3, ONECUT3, ICA1,
KIF14,
PCSK6,
CDH13,
KDM4C,
ZNF844,
CCNG1,
and
NUDCD2 (puncorrected < 0.05) (Table S6).
Phenotypic Analysis
Phenotypic data of 74 ASD and 105 SCZ patients with clinically
significant CNVs were available. ASD patients with such CNVs
had a high prevalence of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric co-
morbidities including ID (n = 32, 43.2%), ADHD (n = 30, 40.5%),
and epileptic seizures/epilepsy (n = 15, 20.3%) (Table 3; Table
S7). Around 30% of SCZ patients (30/105) had comorbidities
including ID (n = 22, 21.0%) and mood symptoms (n = 13,
12.4%) (Table S8).
In both ASD and SCZ, ID was significantly more frequent in pa-
tients with clinically significant CNVs than in those without such
CNVs (ASD: 43.2% versus 25.0%, OR = 2.29, pcorrected = 0.013;
SCZ: 21.0% versus 3.8%, OR = 6.63, pcorrected = 3.0 3 10�5).
Gene Set Analysis
In ASD cases versus controls, we found significant enrichment of
116 gene sets (q < 0.01) (Table 4; Table S9). The gene set with the
largest effect size was ‘‘GO:0034614 cellular response to reac-
tive oxygen species’’ (OR = 3.18, q = 0.0039). The 116 enriched
gene sets were functionally classified into 20 biological path-
ways including DNA/genomic integrity (15 gene sets), lipid meta-
bolism/modification (11 gene sets), protein phosphorylation/
kinase activity (8 gene sets), oxidative stress response (4 gene
sets), and small GTPase signaling (4 gene sets).
In SCZ cases versus controls, we observed significant enrich-
ment of 64 gene sets (q < 0.01) (Table 5; Table S10). Among
them, 26 gene sets (40.6%) were also significant in ASD,

 showing a highly significant overlap (p = 1.0 3 10�10, two-sided
Fisher’s exact test). Notably, the gene set with the largest effect
size was the same as in ASD: ‘‘GO:0034614 cellular response to
reactive oxygen species’’ (OR = 2.32, q = 0.0020). The 64 en-
riched gene sets were classified into 17 biological pathways
including lipid metabolism/modification (10 gene sets), syn-
apse/neuron projection (8 gene sets), and oxidative stress
response (4 gene sets). Sixteen biological pathways were com-
mon to both ASD and SCZ including actin cytoskeleton, cell
adhesion/junction, DNA/genome integrity, lipid metabolism/
modification, MAPK signaling, membrane transport, oxidative
stress response, protein phosphorylation/kinase activity, small
GTPase signaling, synapse/neuron projection, and transcrip-
tion/gene expression (Figure S1).
Finally, in ASD cases versus SCZ cases and vice versa, we
found no significant enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) gene
sets (q > 0.01).
Identification of Disease-Relevant Genes in Eight Well-
Known ASD/SCZ-Associated CNV Loci
We selected 705 and 1,028 candidate genes for ASD and SCZ
(denoted ASD-CNV and SCZ-CNV, respectively) on a genome-
wide scale, which were both intersected by case CNVs and
included in the enriched gene sets. We found that both ASD-
CNV ðGiÞ and SCZ-CNV ðGiÞ were significantly enriched
toward the top of the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ calculated by the neigh-
borhood enrichment score for the well-established genes for
ASD and SCZ (ASD-SFARI, ASD-HGMD, and SCZ-HGMD)
in the human cerebral cortex-specific functional interaction

Figure 2. Evaluation of Our Candidate Genes for ASD and SCZ
(A) The heatmap shows the enrichment of the gene set Gi toward the top of the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ calculated by the neighborhood enrichment score for the
gene set Gj. We denote our candidate genes for ASD and SCZ as ‘‘ASD-CNV’’ and ‘‘SCZ-CNV,’’ the well-established genes for ASD in SFARI as ‘‘ASD-SFARI,’’
and the well-established genes for ASD, SCZ, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson disease in the
Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) as ‘‘ASD-HGMD,’’ ‘‘SCZ-HGMD,’’ ‘‘AD-HGMD,’’ ‘‘ALS-HGMD,’’ ‘‘FTD-HGMD,’’ and ‘‘PD-HGMD,’’ respectively. The
intensity of the color in each cell shows the log-transformed significance of the enrichment. The significance was calculated by gene set enrichment analysis
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Both ASD-CNV ðGiÞ and SCZ-CNV ðGiÞ are significantly enriched toward the top of the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ calculated
by the neighborhood enrichment score for ASD-SFARI, ASD-HGMD, and SCZ-HGMD in the human cerebral cortex-specific functional interaction network
(legend continued on next page)

 network (pcorrected < 0.05; Figure 2A; Table S11). In contrast,
neither ASD-CNV ðGiÞ nor SCZ-CNV ðGiÞ was enriched toward
the top of the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ calculated by the neighbor-
hood enrichment score for four neurodegenerative diseases
(pcorrected > 0.05) except for SCZ-CNV ðGiÞ and AD-HGMD ðLjÞ.
Similar results were obtained when the gene set ðGiÞ and the
pre-ranked list ðLjÞ were reversed. Therefore, these results
suggested that our candidate genes for ASD and SCZ were
associated with the well-established genes for ASD and SCZ,
but not for neurodegenerative diseases in the human cerebral
cortex-specific functional interaction network. Figure S2 shows
network visualization of neighborhood enrichment scores for
our candidate genes and the well-established brain disorder
genes.
In the eight ASD/SCZ-associated CNV loci (3q29, 7q11.23,
15q11.2,
15q11.2-q13.1,
15q13.3,
16p11.2,
17q12,
and
22q11.2), 85 and 60 candidate genes were identified in ASD
and SCZ, respectively. Forty-seven candidate genes common
to both disorders were selected as disease-relevant genes in
these CNV loci (Figure 2B). Five loci (3q29, 7q11.23, 15q11.2,
16p11.2, 22q11.2) contained disease-relevant genes related
to synapse or neuron projection (e.g., COMT, CYFIP1). The
16p11.2 locus contained three kinase-related genes (MAPK3,
MVP, TAOK2). Finally, five loci (e.g., 22q11.2, 3q29, 15q13.3)
included genes related to genomic integrity (e.g., CDC45,
RNF168, FAN1).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found (1) an increased genome-wide burden of
rare exonic CNVs in both disorders; (2) clinically significant
(or pathogenic) CNVs in about 8% of these patients with signifi-
cant overlap; (3) 12 novel CNV loci potentially associated with
ASD/SCZ in a Japanese population; (4) multiple biological path-
ways relevant to each disorder with significant overlap; (5) a
significant association between clinically significant CNVs and
ID; and (6) 47 disease-relevant genes in eight well-known
ASD/SCZ-associated CNV loci.
An increased burden of CNVs has been reported in previous
CNV studies in Caucasian populations (Marshall et al., 2017;
Pinto et al., 2014). We replicated this finding in a Japanese pop-
ulation. Our results further suggested that the burden of exonic
CNVs was increased to a comparable extent in ASD and SCZ.
However, despite the strong evidence for the increased CNV
burden, the causes and pathophysiological significance are not
fully understood.
Clinically significant CNVs were more frequent in patients with
ASD and SCZ than in controls, supporting their pathogenicity in
both disorders. In the literature, these CNVs were previously
associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders. We emphasize that the diagnostic yields of patho-
genic CNVs were very similar between ASD and SCZ (�8%),
suggesting the diagnostic utility of aCGH for SCZ as well as
ASD. This diagnostic yield was also similar to that of 7.2% re-
ported in a recent ASD study using whole-genome sequencing
(C Yuen et al., 2017). Genetic overlap has been suggested in
epidemiological and molecular genetic studies (Doherty and
Owen, 2014; Moreno-De-Luca et al., 2013). In line with this,
our systematic and comprehensive investigation confirmed a
significant overlap of pathogenic CNVs between ASD and SCZ
in a Japanese population.
For individual CNVs, 22q11.21 deletions were associated with
SCZ, whereas reciprocal duplications were associated with
ASD. This is consistent with former reports of the diametric
pattern of this locus (Crespi et al., 2010) and a protective effect
of 22q11.21 duplications against SCZ (Rees et al., 2014a). This
may suggest the presence of dosage-sensitive genes in this
locus that have an opposite effect on the risk for ASD and
SCZ. We also found a strong association between X chromo-
some aneuploidies and SCZ, replicating the finding in our previ-
ous study (Kushima et al., 2017).
We identified 12 novel loci (genes) potentially associated with
ASD/SCZ in a Japanese population. Among them, deletion of
CDH13 was previously identified in one patient with ASD (Shen
et al., 2010). Biallelic variants in KIF14 were reported to cause
ID (Makrythanasis et al., 2018). Three genes (ICA1, KIF14, and
CDH13) play a critical role in neurodevelopment and synaptic
function. ICA1 localizes to dendrites of neurons and is involved
in glutamate receptor-mediated transmission (Cao et al., 2007).
KIF14 is essential for the generation and maturation of brain
structures (Fujikura et al., 2013). CDH13 is a negative regulator
of axon growth and inhibitory synapses (Rivero et al., 2015).
Phenotypic analysis provided further evidence for variable
phenotypic expressivity of clinically significant CNVs. Among
others, ID was strongly associated with clinically significant
CNVs in both patient groups. This is compatible with previous
findings that showed that control subjects carrying ASD/SCZ-
associated CNVs have cognitive impairment (Stefansson et al.,
2014). Furthermore, 50% (3/6) of ASD patients with psychosis
had CNVs with very large effects on SCZ risk (OR = �10;
NRXN1 deletion, 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication, 47,XXX) (Kushima
et al., 2017; Rees et al., 2014b). This may indicate early symp-
toms of SCZ. As phenotypic expressivity of clinically significant
CNVs is age dependent, a prospective longitudinal study is
required to obtain a more accurate picture of the associated
phenotypic spectrum. Regarding the molecular mechanism of
variable expressivity of these CNVs, second-hit CNVs contribute
to phenotypic variability in patients with neurodevelopmental
disorders (Girirajan et al., 2012). However, as discordant pheno-
types in monozygotic twins are not rare, other factors such as
somatic mutations were also suggested to be involved (Gottlieb
et al., 2001).
(pcorrected < 0.05; Table S11). In contrast, neither ASD-CNV nor SCZ-CNV was enriched toward the top of the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ calculated by the neighborhood
enrichment score for AD-HGMD, ALS-HGMD, FTD-HGMD, and PD-HGMD (pcorrected > 0.05), except for SCZ-CNV ðGiÞ and AD-HGMD ðLjÞ. Similar results were
obtained when the gene set ðGiÞ and the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ were reversed: ASD-SFARI ðGiÞ, ASD-HGMD ðGiÞ, and SCZ-HGMD ðGiÞ (but not AD-HGMD,
ALS-HGMD, FTD-HGMD, and PD-HGMD) are significantly enriched toward the top of the pre-ranked list ðLjÞ calculated by the neighborhood enrichment score
for ASD-CNV and SCZ-CNV.
(B) Forty-seven disease-relevant genes, which were common to ASD and SCZ, were identified in the eight well-known ASD/SCZ-associated CNV loci.

 In gene set analysis, we found evidence for a significant
overlap of biological pathways between ASD and SCZ. Among
these pathways, seven (synapse/neuron projection, cell adhe-
sion/junction, small GTPase signaling, MAPK signaling, protein
phosphorylation/kinase activity, transcription/gene expression
regulation, and actin cytoskeleton) were associated with the
two disorders in previous genetic studies (De Rubeis et al.,
2014;
Gilman
et
al.,
2012;
Gilman
et
al.,
2011;
Kirov
et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2014; Purcell
et al., 2014; C Yuen et al., 2017). In particular, small GTPase
and MAPK signaling contain many genes for neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders and are implicated in synapse plasticity and
behavior (Borrie et al., 2017). Altered kinase activity was also
found in postmortem brains of SCZ patients (McGuire et al.,
2014). The actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in structural
plasticity in the developing brain, including neuritogenesis, neu-
rite branching, and synapse formation and elimination.
Other biological pathways common to both disorders included
oxidative stress response, lipid metabolism/modification, and
genomic integrity. First, in terms of oxidative stress response,
‘‘GO: 0034614 cellular response to reactive oxygen species’’
was most strongly associated with both disorders, suggesting
a particular importance for dysregulation of the antioxidant de-
fense system. In line with this, increased oxidative stress and
decreased antioxidant capacity were observed in these patients
(Koga et al., 2016; Rossignol and Frye, 2014). A proper concen-
tration of reactive oxygen species is critical for intracellular
signaling, neurotransmission, and learning and memory pro-
cesses (Koga et al., 2016). Second, lipids are the most abundant
organic compounds in the brain, and alterations in lipid
metabolism were observed in ASD and SCZ (Gross, 2017). Phos-
pholipids play an important role in synaptic neurotransmission
and plasticity. A recent study suggested that targeting synaptic
phospholipid signaling may be a potential therapy for psychiatric
disorders (Thalman et al., 2018). Third, in the genomic integrity
pathway, ‘‘DNA replication’’ (GO: 0006260), ‘‘DNA recombina-
tion’’ (GO: 0006310), and ‘‘double-strand break repair’’ (GO:
0006302) are directly associated with the mechanism of CNV for-
mation (Carvalho and Lupski, 2016). For example, recurrent and
nonrecurrent CNVs are formed by DNA recombination-based
and DNA replication-based mechanism, respectively. Thus, de-
fects in genomic integrity may be related to an increased burden
of de novo or rare CNVs in these disorders. Considering that the
somatic mutation rate is originally much higher than the germline
mutation rate (Lynch, 2010),defects in genomic integrity mayalso
increase the burden of somatic mutations in neurons. A recent
study showed that the somatic copy number of the L1 retrotrans-
poson (a type of structural variation) in neurons increases in SCZ
(Bundo et al., 2014). Many examples of monozygotic twins have
been reported in which the presence or severity of phenotypes is
discordant due to somatic mutations (Bruder et al., 2008; Freed
et al., 2014). Therefore, defects in genomic integrity may also
be involved in variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance
of CNVs.
We confirmed that our candidate genes for ASD and SCZ,
which were selected on a genome-wide scale based on the
results of gene set analysis, were associated with the well-estab-
lished genes for ASD and SCZ in the human cerebral cortex-
specific functional interaction network. This result added validity
to our candidate genes. Based on this, 47 disease-relevant genes
were identified in eight well-known ASD/SCZ-associated CNV
loci. Among them, genes associated with the synapse or neuron
projection were COMT/RTN4R (22q11.2), CYFIP1 (15q11.2), and
TBX6 (16p11.2). Mouse models of these CNVs exhibit deficits in
dendritic complexity and synaptic function (Karayiorgou et al.,
2010; Pathania et al., 2014; Portmann et al., 2014). Three genes
related to protein phosphorylation (MAPK3, MVP, TAOK2) were
identified in the 16p11.2 locus. Dysregulation of Mapk3 signaling
is linked to altered cortical progenitor proliferation and brain
cytoarchitecture of a mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion (Pucilow-
ska et al., 2015). Furthermore, genes related to genomic integrity
were classified as disease relevant, including CDC45 (22q11.2),
RNF168 (3q29), and FAN1 (15q13.3). CDC45 and RNF168
encode proteins required for DNA replication and DNA double-
strand break repair, respectively. FAN1, which is also involved
in DNA repair, was reported as a disease-relevant gene in the
15q13.3 locus (Ionita-Laza et al., 2014). In terms of lipid modifica-
tion, two genes encoding palmitoyl transferase were identified as
disease relevant: ZDHHC8 (22q11.2) and ZDHHC19 (3q29).
ZDHHC8 palmitoylates postsynaptic proteins and regulates the
formation and function of dendritic spines and synapses (Mukai
et al., 2008).
The strength of our study is the systematic head-to-head
comparison of pathogenic CNVs and biological pathways be-
tween ASD and SCZ. Previous studies in Caucasian populations
found overlap in pathogenic CNVs between the two disorders,
but their analyses were limited to a small number of genes and
CNV loci (Burbach and van der Zwaag, 2009; Crespi et al.,
2010; Doherty and Owen, 2014; Moreno-De-Luca et al., 2013).
To our knowledge, no studies have directly and systematically
compared biological pathways between the two disorders.
One of our study’s limitations is that age and sex were not
matched between cases and controls. However, we found no
significant effects of age on CNV burden, and we adjusted for
sex in our analyses. Second, interpretation of clinical signifi-
cance of CNVs may change with time as genetic evidence be-
comes more sophisticated. A third limitation is ascertainment
bias due to comorbidity of ID. As we found a significant associ-
ation between ID and clinically significant CNVs, the comorbidity
of ID may have introduced bias in the results of association
analysis.
In conclusion, the present study in a Japanese population
revealed pathogenic CNVs and biological pathways of ASD
and SCZ and their significant overlap between these disorders.
Phenotypic analysis provided additional evidence for an associ-
ation between clinically significant CNVs and ID. The identifica-
tion of shared pathways and disease-relevant genes provides
biological insights into these disorders.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
This study was approved by the ethics committee of each participating insti-
tute, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. We studied
1,132 ASD cases, 2,519 SCZ cases, and 2,110 psychiatrically normal controls
(Table S1). Details of the subjects are described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.

 aCGH, CNV Calling, and QC
We used two types of aCGH for genome-wide CNV screening: NimbleGen
720k Whole-Genome Tiling Arrays (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI) and
Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH 400k (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). CNV calls
were made with Nexus Copy Number software, v9.0 (BioDiscovery, El
Segundo, CA) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We performed all
analyses based on rare CNVs (<1% of the total sample). All genomic locations
are given in GRCh38 coordinates. Gene annotation was based on GENCODE,
version 27.
CNV Validation
Previously, we confirmed that CNV calls from NimbleGen arrays are highly
accurate with a validation rate >99% (Kushima et al., 2017). Thus, we validated
CNV calls from Agilent arrays. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with
TaqMan copy-number assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for
randomly selected CNVs (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Assessment of Confounding Factors
Because confounding factors can produce spurious results in association
studies of CNVs, we examined their impact on genome-wide CNV burden
(total number of CNVs). For this purpose, we used a multiple linear regression
model in which the dependent variable was the total number of CNVs, and the
independent variables were the array type, phenotype, age, and sex.
Genome-wide CNV Burden Analysis
We examined CNV burden in ASD or SCZ cases versus controls. The burden of
rare exonic CNVs was measured with two different burden metrics: (1) the
number of CNVs and (2) the genomic length impacted by CNVs. Exonic
CNVs were defined as overlapping with any exon of a gene as annotated in
GENCODE, version 27.
Burden tests used a logistic regression model to predict case-control status
by CNV burden along with sex as a covariate. One-sided empirical p values
(assuming increased CNV burden in cases) were calculated based on
100,000 permutations, swapping case-control status within genotyping
batches to control for batch effect. These p values were not adjusted for mul-
tiple testing. ORs indicate an increase in the likelihood of having the disease
per unit increase in CNV burden.
Identification and Association Analysis of Clinically Significant CNVs
We assessed the clinical significance of identified CNVs according to the
American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines for interpretation
of CNVs (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Kearney et al., 2011). For
assessments, we preselected 487 loci (69 CNVs and 418 genes) that are asso-
ciated with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders (Table S12).
For statistical tests of an association between clinically significant CNVs and
disease status, the Firth logistic regression model was used, in which the case
versus control status was regressed on clinically significant CNVs with adjust-
ment for sex. One-sided empirical p values were calculated based on 100,000
permutations, swapping case-control status within genotyping batches to
control for batch effect. We adjusted these p values for multiple testing using
Bonferroni correction unless otherwise indicated.
Identification of Candidate ASD/SCZ-Associated CNV Loci
We aimed to identify candidate CNV loci for ASD and SCZ. Considering the
genetic overlap between ASD and SCZ and the limited power of our sample
size, ASD and SCZ samples were combined as cases. Then we determined
the counts of exonic CNVs that intersected a protein-encoding gene in
cases and controls, and performed a gene-based association analysis of
exonic CNVs. Genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental or
psychiatric disorders and genes in well-known ASD/SCZ-associated CNV
loci or segmental duplications were excluded from this analysis. For statisti-
cal analysis, we used the Firth logistic regression model, in which the case
versus control status was regressed on exonic CNVs in a gene with adjust-
ment for sex. One-sided empirical p values were calculated based on
100,000 permutations, swapping case-control status within genotyping
batches. Given the discovery nature of this analysis, we did not correct for
multiple testing.
Phenotypic Analysis
We examined phenotypic data of patients with clinically significant CNVs.
Based on the evidence linking ASD/SCZ-associated CNVs to lower IQ, we
tested for an association between clinically significant CNVs and ID (IQ < 70)
separately in ASD and SCZ patients. Further details can be found in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Gene Set Analysis
We tested for enrichment of rare exonic CNVs (combined deletions and dupli-
cations) in gene sets (from the GO database) relative to all rare exonic CNVs.We
directly compared the rate of CNVs that impacted a specific gene set in ASD or
SCZ cases versus controls while controlling for sources of bias (Raychaudhuri
et al., 2010). Specifically, we used a logistic regression model, in which the case
versus control status was regressed on the number of genes within a given
gene set that were intersected by rare exonic CNVs with adjustment for cova-
riates including CNV size, CNV rate, and sex. This method is robust against
case-control differences in CNV size, CNV rate, and systematic differences in
gene size (Raychaudhuri et al., 2010). The enrichment in cases was reported
as one-sided empirical p values using 100,000 permutations, swapping
case-control status within genotyping batches to control for batch effect.
Weused gene setsdefined bytheGOConsortium(http://www.geneontology.
org/). The gene2go file was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information in March 2018. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used the
false discovery rate with significance set at q (false discovery rate) < 0.01.
Identification of Disease-Relevant Genes in Eight Well-Known
ASD/SCZ-Associated CNV Loci
We aimed to identify disease-relevant genes in eight well-known ASD/
SCZ-associated CNV loci (3q29, 7q11.23, 15q11.2, 15q11.2-q13.1, 15q13.3,
16p11.2, 17q12, and 22q11.2) (Doherty and Owen, 2014). For this purpose, we
first systematically selected candidate disease-relevant genes on a genome-
wide basis based on the results of gene set analysis. Specifically, genes were
defined as candidate genes for ASD or SCZ if they were both intersected by
case CNVs and included in the enriched gene sets in ASD or SCZ, respectively.
Next, we sought to confirm that our candidate genes for ASD and SCZ were
associated with the well-established genes for ASD and SCZ, but not for
neurodegenerative diseases in the functional gene interaction network of
disease-related brain regions (human cerebral cortex) (Greene et al., 2015).
The methods are described in detail in Supplemental Experimental Proced-
ures. In brief, we examined whether our candidate genes were enriched in
the well-established genes for ASD and SCZ, but not for Alzheimer disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson dis-
ease in the context of the human cerebral cortex-specific functional interaction
network. The enrichment was calculated by the neighborhood enrichment
scores, and the significance was determined by gene set enrichment analysis
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Finally, we separately identified candidate genes for ASD and SCZ in the
above eight loci, and those common to both disorders were selected as
disease-relevant genes in these CNV loci. Relevant biological pathways
were determined based on the GO annotation of the genes.
