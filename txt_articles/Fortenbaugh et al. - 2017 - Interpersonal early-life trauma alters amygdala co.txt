Abstract
Introduction: Interpersonal early life trauma (I- 
ELT) is associated with a myriad of func-
tional impairments in adulthood, increased risk of drug addiction, and neuropsychiatric 
disorders. While deficits in emotional regulation and amygdala functioning are well 
characterized, deficits in general cognitive functioning have also been documented. 
However, the neural underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction in adults with a history of 
I- 
ELT and the potential relationship between amygdala- 
based functional connectivity 
and behavioral performance are currently poorly understood. This study examined how 
I- 
ELT affects the cognitive and neural mechanisms supporting  
sustained attention.
Methods: A total of 66 Veterans (18 with and 48 without a history of I- 
ELT) completed 
a nonemotional sustained attention task during functional MRI.
Results: The individuals with I- 
ELT showed significant impairments in sustained atten-
tion (i.e., higher error rates, greater response variability). This cohort exhibited in-
creased amygdala functional connectivity with the prefrontal cortex and decreased 
functional connectivity with the parahippocampal gyrus when compared to those 
without I- 
ELT. These connections were significantly correlated with individual differ-
ences in sustained attention performance. Notably, classification analyses revealed 
that the pattern of amygdala connectivity across the whole brain was able to classify 
I- 
ELT status with 70% accuracy.
Conclusion: These results provide evidence of a lasting negative impact for those with 
a history of I- 
ELT on sustained attention ability. They also highlight a critical role for 
amygdala functioning in cognitive control and sustained attention for those with a his-
tory of I- 
ELT, which may underlie the observed attention deficits in clinical assess-
ments and cognitive tests involving both emotional and nonemotional stimuli.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Converging evidence points to a lasting impact of trauma expe-
rienced during sensitive periods in childhood (Anda et al., 2006), 
with developmental trajectories occurring pre/periadolescence 
irremediably altered by exposure to significant stress (Bergman, 
Larsen, & Mueller, 1986; Mullen, Martin, Anderson, Romans, & 
Herbison, 1996; Perry, Pollard, Blakley, Baker, & Vigilante, 1995; 
Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). Stressors of an interpersonal nature, 
like physical/sexual abuse or family violence, occur in 9.5% (Sachs- 
Ericsson, Blazer, Plant, & Arnow, 2005) to 32% of the general 
population (Cougle, Timpano, Sachs- 
Ericsson, Keough, & Riccardi, 
2010) and are thought to cause enduring emotional or cognitive 
impairments due in great part to the human agency behind the 
threat (De Bellis & Zisk, 2014; Perry et al., 1995). It is important 
to underscore the personal nature of these traumatic events, since 
they have been documented to lead to more severe symptoms than 
impersonal traumas like accidents or natural disasters (Perry et al., 
1995). Studies of interpersonal early life trauma (I- 
ELT) have fur-
ther revealed increases in reactivity to fear- 
conditioning and startle 
paradigms (Jovanovic et al., 2009, 2011; Ornitz & Pynoos, 1989), 
decreases in stress regulation (Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, & Van 
Ryzin, 2009), and impaired emotion regulation abilities (McLaughlin, 
Hatzenbuehler, Mennin, & Nolen- 
Hoeksema, 2011). Such behav-
ioral alterations have been associated with increased risk of de-
veloping psychopathology in adulthood (Heim & Nemeroff, 2001), 
especially posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Lanius, Frewen, 
Vermetten, & Yehuda, 2010; McKeever & Huff, 2003; Pratchett & 
Yehuda, 2011).
Stress, which impacts the whole body through the concerted 
actions of hormones and neurotransmitters (McEwen, 2000), typi-
cally begins with and feeds back to the limbic system. This system 
develops throughout childhood and may be especially affected by 
exposure to I- 
ELT. Animal models provided initial evidence of a 
lasting impact of ELT on the limbic system (LeDoux, 2000, 2003). 
Human brain imaging studies subsequently showed that I- 
ELT 
was associated with altered structural integrity in the limbic sys-
tem (Aas et al., 2012; Andersen et al., 2008; Bremner et al., 1997; 
Carrion, Weems, & Reiss, 2007; Corbo et al., 2014; Dannlowski 
et al., 2012; Driessen et al., 2004; Lupien et al., 2011; Tottenham 
et al., 2010; Veer et al., 2015). Functional imaging studies have 
further shown that, when processing emotional stimuli (e.g., angry 
faces), I- 
ELT was associated with increased activity in the amyg-
dala (Bremner et al., 2005; Grant, Cannistraci, Hollon, Gore, & 
Shelton, 2011; Maheu et al., 2010), and with decreased activity 
of the hippocampus (Bremner et al., 1999; Bremner et al., 2003; 
Carrion, Haas, Garrett, Song, & Reiss, 2010) and anterior cingulate 
cortex (Bremner, Vythilingam, Vermetten, Southwick, McGlashan, 
Nazeer, et al., 2003; Bremner, et al., 2003; Bremner et al., 2004; 
Mueller et al., 2010). However, these studies have been limited by 
the consistent use of emotional stimuli, preventing assessments of 
whether I- 
ELT- 
related limbic dysfunction potentially impacts more 
general aspects of cognition.
Importantly, deficits in general cognitive abilities, which are 
relevant to everyday functioning, have been reported in chil-
dren (Wilson, Hansen, & Li, 2011) and adults exposed to child-
hood trauma (Gould et al., 2012). Sustained attention, the ability 
to maintain focus over a period of seconds to minutes while sup-
pressing distractions, is highly sensitive to stress/arousal (Scholz 
et al., 2009). Significant evidence points to an impact of I- 
ELT on 
sustained attention ability (De Bellis, Woolley, & Hooper, 2013; 
DePrince, Weinzierl, & Combs, 2009; Kaplow, Hall, Koenen, Dodge, 
& Amaya- 
Jackson, 2008; Navalta, Polcari, Webster, Boghossian, & 
Teicher, 2006; Porter, Lawson, & Bigler, 2005; Samuelson, Krueger, 
Burnett, & Wilson, 2010), yet no study to date has examined how 
I- 
ELT- 
related amygdala dysregulation may contribute to impairments 
in sustained attention or cognitive performance in neutral contexts 
more broadly. Evidence that amygdala functioning can impact sus-
tained attention in nonemotional contexts can be found in animal 
studies suggesting that the amygdala serves as a general relevance 
detector (Gallagher & Holland, 1994; Holland, 2007; Holland & 
Gallagher, 1999; Holland, Han, & Gallagher, 2000; Sander, Grafman, 
& Zalla, 2003). Additionally, emerging literature in non- 
ELT clinical 
populations suggests that amygdala functioning may interfere with 
sustained attention (Fleck et al., 2012).
In both clinical and nonclinical populations, traditional stimulus- 
evoked analyses do not typically identify the amygdala as a region 
involved in sustained attention (Esterman, Noonan, Rosenberg, & 
DeGutis, 2013; Langner & Eickoff, 2013; Sarter, Givens, & Bruno, 
2001; see Fleck et al., 2012 for an exception). However, functional 
connectivity analyses provide a complementary analytic approach 
to activation analyses, which focus on brain activation patterns to 
rare target or error events in sustained attention tasks. Contrasted 
to activation analyses, functional connectivity takes into account the 
entire task time series, and are model- 
free, capturing cofluctuations 
in activity not captured by extrinsic events in model- 
based activation 
analyses (Gonzalez- 
Castillo et al., 2012). Recent studies using func-
tional connectivity analyses suggest that this approach is sensitive 
to I- 
ELT (Philip et al., 2013; Philip et al., 2014), as well as individ-
ual differences in anxiety, intelligence, cognitive ability, and ADHD 
symptoms (Finn et al., 2015; Fortenbaugh, DeGutis, & Esterman, in 
press; Kim et al., 2011; Poole et al., 2016; Rosenberg et al., 2016). 
This approach may thus reveal previously unobserved brainâbehav-
ior associations that are relevant to our understanding of cognition 
and psychopathology.
Based on the promise of this approach, the present study investi-
gated the performance of Veterans with and without exposure to I- 
ELT 
using an innovative sustained attention measure, the gradual onset 
continuous performance task (gradCPT) (Esterman et al., 2013). We 
hypothesized that individuals with a history of I- 
ELT would show im-
paired performance on the task. Furthermore, based on findings in the 
literature indicating that the amygdala may be structurally and func-
tionally altered following a history of I- 
ELT, we tested the hypothesis 
that group- 
level differences in amygdala functional connectivity exist 
across the brain and, furthermore, are related to observed attentional 
performance differences.

2 | METHODS AND MATERIALS
2.1 | Participants
Sixty- 
six participants were recruited from the Translational Research 
Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS), a 
Rehabilitation Research and Development National Center for TBI 
Research (NCR) at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System. 
All participants were deployed Veterans from Operations Enduring 
Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn. The spe-
cific characteristics of this cohort have previously been described 
(Lippa et al., 2015). Exclusion criteria for TRACTS include: (a) history of 
neurological illness [other than traumatic brain injury (TBI)]; (b) history 
of seizures; (c) current diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or other 
psychotic disorders (not related to PTSD); (d) current active suicidal 
and/or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan requiring crisis intervention; 
or (e) cognitive disorder due to general medical condition other than 
TBI. Importantly, because our cohort was deployed, exposure to com-
bat and a history of mild traumatic brain injury were not exclusion 
criteria. The Institutional Review Board of Human Studies Research at 
the VA Boston Healthcare System approved all research procedures. 
All participants provided informed consent, and were reimbursed for 
their time and travel expenses.
History of I- 
ELT was assessed using the Traumatic Life Events 
Questionnaire [TLEQ (Kubany et al., 2000)]. Following the criteria used 
in Corbo et al. (2014), individuals were considered to have I- 
ELT (I- 
ELT+, N = 18) if they reported a history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, 
or family violence before 18 years of age, in addition to a fearful (A2) 
response (APA, 2013). Control participants (I- 
ELTâ, N = 48) were in-
dividuals without this history. Although some control participants 
(N = 26) did report exposure to a traumatic event of a noninterper-
sonal nature before 18 years old (e.g., earthquake or motor vehicle ac-
cident), they were included in the control group if they did not report 
significant distress (no A2 reaction or PTSD diagnosis). To ensure that 
group differences were specifically due to the interpersonal quality of 
the traumatic event, we further examined I- 
ELT+ versus the I- 
ELTâ who 
had been exposed to a noninterpersonal trauma before 18 years of 
age.
2.2 | Clinical assessment
As part of the standard TRACTS protocol, all participants completed 
clinical interviews regarding their deployment experiences, as well as 
pre- 
 and postdeployment traumatic experiences. In order to estab-
lish consensus on the diagnoses, three doctoral- 
level psychologists 
reviewed all clinical interviews. During this assessment period, PTSD 
diagnosis and severity was evaluated using the Clinician-Administered 
PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995). Severity of PTSD in the past 
month was computed by summing the frequency and intensity 
of symptoms in the three main clusters (Flashbacks and Intrusive 
Memories; Avoidance and Emotional Numbing; and Hyperarousal). 
Predeployment assessment of PTSD on the CAPS was used to help 
confirm assessment of I- 
ELT. History of TBI was assessed using the 
Boston Assessment of TBI-Lifetime (BAT- 
L; Fortier et al., 2013). The 
BAT- 
L covers events pre- 
, during, and post- 
military deployment, al-
lowing for computation of the total number of mild TBIs across the 
lifetime. Because of the impact of physical trauma to the brain, we used 
the BAT- 
L to exclude participants reporting a history of moderate/
severe TBIs, while recording the number of mild TBIs experienced as 
a statistical control. Combat exposure, a proxy for severity of military 
trauma, was assessed using the combat scale of the Deployment Risk 
and Resilience Inventory (DRRI; Vogt, Proctor, King, King, & Vasterling, 
2008). Severity of symptoms of depression was documented using the 
depression scale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS- 
d; 
Koenig, Jacob, & Haber, 2009). DASS results for one I- 
ELTâ partici-
pant were not available. This participant was excluded from ANCOVA 
analyses using clinical measures as covariates. All TRACTS partici-
pants completed the MRI session at the end of the testing day.
2.3 | Behavioral paradigm and stimuli
The gradCPT is a go/no- 
go continuous performance task that uses 
a not- 
X design similar to other continuous performance tasks used 
in neuropsychological assessments such as the Connors CPT task 
(Conners, 1994) and the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; 
Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley, & Yiend, 1997). Participants 
were instructed to press a button for each city scene they detected 
(frequent nontarget), and withhold response to each detected moun-
tain scene (infrequent target). The paradigm contains 20 round, gray- 
scale photographs of 10 mountain scenes and 10 city scenes that 
gradually transitioned from one to the next over 800 ms using a linear 
pixel- 
by- 
pixel interpolation (see Figure 1). These scenes are randomly 
presented with 10% mountain and 90% city images, without allowing 
FIGURE 1 Behavioral paradigm. Illustration of the trial sequence 
in the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). This 
figure shows images linearly transitioning from one to the next over 
each 800 ms interval. Images were shown one after the next for the 
entire 8- 
minute run. Participants were asked to press a button every 
time they detected a new city image and withhold pressing whenever 
they detected a rare mountain image (10% trials). The mixed images 
show the adjacent images at 50% coherence levels

identical scenes to repeat on consecutive trials. Response accuracy 
was emphasized without reference to speed. However, given that 
the next stimulus would replace the current stimulus in 800 ms, a re-
sponse deadline was implicit in the task. Images were viewed through 
a mirror in the scanner bore projected via a back projection screen.
Prior to scanning, participants were familiarized with each of the 
20 scene images and were given a 1â2 min practice of the task. Within 
the scanner, participants performed a single 8- 
min run (600 trials), 
which was the final functional task in the more extensive TRACTS 
protocol.
Following the standard method used in previous studies of the 
gradCPT (Esterman, Reagan, Liu, Turner, & DeGutis, 2014; Esterman 
et al., 2013; Fortenbaugh et al., 2015), all responses were logged 
during the course of the experiment. Following completion, button 
presses were assigned to individual trials using an iterative algorithm. 
Reaction times were calculated relative to the beginning of each image 
transition, such that reaction times (RT) of 800 ms indicate a button 
press at the moment image N was 100% coherent and not mixed with 
other images. A shorter RT indicates that the current scene was still in 
the process of transitioning from the previous, and a longer RT indi-
cates that the current scene was in the process of transitioning to the 
subsequent scene. So, for example, an RT of 720 ms would be at the 
moment of 90% image N and 10% image Nâ1, and so forth.
Once the response algorithm was run, mean reaction times (RT) 
and reaction time variability scores were calculated from the majority 
of trials in which participants responded correctly to city scenes (cor-
rect commission trials). Reaction time variability was calculated using 
the coefficient of variation (CV) or the standard deviation of the RT 
divided by the mean. Two types of errors were considered: commis-
sion errors (CE), where participants press to target mountain trials, 
and omission errors (OE), where participants failed to press to nontar-
get city trials. Using standard signal detection analyses, these errors 
were used to calculate both dâ, a measure of discrimination ability, and 
criterion, a response bias measure that reflects the bias of a partici-
pant to press to a trial image in the case of uncertainty. To calculate 
these measures, hit rates were defined as 1 - 
 CE rate, or the percent-
age of targets for which participants correctly withheld a response. 
False alarm rates were defined by the OE rate or the percentage of 
nontargets for which participants incorrectly withheld responses. All 
participants had hit rates below 100% and false alarm rates greater 
than 0%. Recent studies have shown that dâ and CV scores reflect a 
participantâs sustained attention ability on the gradCPT, whereas cri-
terion and mean RT best reflect the strategy used (Fortenbaugh et al., 
2015). All participants met the performance criteria for inclusion used 
in previous studies of this task of no periods of 30 s or greater without 
a response (Fortenbaugh et al., 2015).
2.4 | MRI acquisition, processing and analysis
Scanning was performed at the Neuroimaging Research for Veterans 
(NeRVe) center of the VA Boston Healthcare hospital on a 3T Siemens 
MAGNETOM Trio system. The functional scan was collected using a 
32- 
channel head coil while two anatomical magnetization- 
prepared 
rapid gradient- 
echo (MP- 
RAGE) structural scans were obtained 
with a 12- 
channel coil. Functional scans were acquired using one 
whole- 
brain echo- 
planar T2*- 
weighted sequence with the following 
 
parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE)  = 30 ms, 
flip angle = 90Âº, 248 volumes, acquisition matrix = 64 Ã 64, in- 
plane 
resolution 3.0 Ã 3.0 mm2, slice thickness 3.75 mm. For structural 
brain images, two MP- 
RAGE T- 
1 structural scans were acquired 
(TR = 2530 ms, TE = 3.32 ms, flip angle = 7Âº, 256 Ã 256 Ã 176, voxel- 
size = 1 mm3) and averaged to increase signal- 
to- 
noise ratio. Structural 
scans were inspected immediately after acquisition on the operator 
console by the biomedical technician in radiology and a member of 
the research study staff for motion artifacts and repeated if necessary. 
All structural images were then processed using standard FreeSurfer 
and Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI; RRID:SCR_005927) 
pipelines (Cox, 1996; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale, 1999; Fischl et al., 2004).
2.5 | fMRI preprocessing and general linear model
Functional MRI data was processed using AFNI (AFNI; Cox, 1996); and 
custom routines written in Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA, 
RRID:SCR_001622). Preprocessing steps included slice- 
time correc-
tion, motion correction using a 6- 
parameter, rigid body, least- 
squares 
alignment procedure, spatial smoothing to an 8- 
mm FWHM Gaussian 
kernel, automated coregistration and normalization of anatomical and 
functional volumes to Talairach space, and scaling of functional data-
set values to percent signal change. Data from individual participants 
were submitted to a first- 
level general linear model (GLM) analysis in 
order to regress out variance in the time series associated with the 
six motion parameters, and three nuisance regressors. These included 
cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), white matter, and the global signal time se-
ries. Functional connectivity and decoding analyses were completed 
on the residual time series from this first- 
level GLM.
2.6 | ROI selection
From the Talaraiched structural images, the TT_N27 atlas in AFNI, 
based on the EickhoffâZilles cytoarchitectonic probabilistic atlas de-
veloped in the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al., 2005), was used 
to anatomically identify our a priori primary regions of interest (ROI): 
the left and right amygdala for each participant. To assess group- 
level 
differences in functional connectivity, a bilateral amygdala ROI was 
used. In the following prediction analyses, the left and right amyg-
dala were treated as separate features. This structural atlas was also 
used to divide the brain (cortical, subcortical, and cerebellum) into 116 
 
anatomically defined ROIs in the subsequent classification analysis.
2.7 | Statistical analyses
2.7.1 | Between- 
group analyses
Given the unequal sample sizes, between- 
group behavioral and amyg-
dala connectivity comparisons were conducted using nonparametric 
MannâWhitney U-tests.
     |  5 of 16
FORTENBAUGH ET Al.
2.7.2 | Functional connectivity analyses
For whole- 
brain voxel- 
level functional connectivity analyses, the av-
erage time series extracted from the bilateral amygdala ROI was cor-
related with the time series of all other voxels. The resulting Pearson 
r- 
values were converted to Fisher z- 
scores to use in the between- 
group analyses. All resulting statistical maps were corrected for 
multiple comparisons using a new and appreciably more conserva-
tive voxel- 
cluster Monte Carlo- 
type Î± simulation than the previous 
standard Gaussian model in AFNI. First, the AFNI 3dFWHMx function 
was run using the spatial autocorrelation function (ACF) option to es-
timate the smoothness of the data using a mixed Gaussian plus mono- 
exponential model to generate random noise fields. The estimated 
parameters were then used with the 3dClustSim function, again using 
the ACF option, to estimate the minimum cluster sizes needed. Based 
on results from this analyses, between- 
group connectivity compari-
sons cluster- 
corrected thresholds for p < .05 were given by nominal 
p = .01 and cluster size â¥ 77.
2.7.3 | Decoding behavior
To determine if amygdala connectivity patterns predicted behavio-
ral performance, multiple linear regression analyses were completed 
using a leave- 
one- 
subject- 
out (LOSO) approach (Esterman, Tamber- 
Rosenau, Chiu, & Yantis, 2010), which maintains independence be-
tween the training and testing datasets. Here, separate group- 
level 
functional connectivity difference analyses using the left and right 
amygdala ROIs as seed regions were rerun 66 times, each time leaving 
one participant out. The two significant clusters (as found in the initial 
between- 
group analysis) with the bilateral amygdala ROI were rede-
fined for each analysis setting the nominal p = .01, meaning that the 
exact number of voxels in each cluster varied across the 66 permuta-
tions (range = 26â226 voxels). This resulted in a total of four features 
that were used in the linear regression analysis (i.e., the left and right 
amygdala connections to the two clusters were calculated separately). 
Here, the average functional connectivity z- 
scores for each of the 66 
participants were extracted from each of the four clusters. The aver-
age z- 
scores for the 65 participants in the training set were then used 
as independent variables in a multiple linear regression to predict ei-
ther their dâ or CV scores (i.e., the two behavioral measures primarily 
related to sustained attention ability). The coefficients of these two 
models were then applied to the functional connectivity z- 
scores of 
the one participant in the test dataset to obtain a predicted perfor-
mance value (dâ or CV). Once this procedure had been completed 
66 times with each participant left out exactly once, the predicted 
performance scores were correlated with the observed performance 
scores (e.g., predicted dâ vs. observed dâ) to test the performance of 
the model using Pearson- 
r correlation analysis.
2.7.4 | Decoding I- 
ELT status
The final analysis used a whole- 
brain ROI- 
level classification analysis 
to determine if I- 
ELT status could be predicted based on amygdala 
connectivity patterns. Classification was completed using discrimi-
nant analysis in Matlab with functions from the Statistics and Machine 
Learning toolbox and custom written functions. A naÃ¯ve Bayes clas-
sifier was used, estimating the diagonal covariance matrix with 
multivariate normal densities. This algorithm assumes features are 
conditionally independent given the class. While this assumption is 
most often not met, this type of classifier has been found to be ef-
fective at classification in a variety of settings, including probabilistic 
diagnosis (Hilden, 1984) and when using small sample sizes (Hand & 
Yu, 2001).
For this ROI- 
level analysis, the TT_N27 atlas was used to divide 
the brain into 116 ROIs. The average time- 
series for each ROI was 
correlated with the left and right amygdala time series and the result-
ing correlation values were Fisher z- 
scored. This resulted in 232 po-
tential features for the LOSO classification analysis. Using the LOSO 
approach, each participant was left out of the training dataset once. 
In each LOSO iteration, a model was built from N features across the 
65 participants in the training dataset, were N was varied from 1 to 66 
possible features. The maximum feature set of 66 was chosen to not 
exceed the number of instances (subjects). While in traditional mod-
eling analyses, increasing the number of independent variables inevi-
tably lead to increases in the amount of variance explained and model 
over- 
fitting, the same is not true when the LOSO approach is utilized. 
Indeed, increasing the number of features here leads to modeling of 
noise in the training set which can in turn decrease prediction ability on 
the test dataset (Hawkins, 2004). Feature selection was done by find-
ing the N features with the greatest between- 
group separation (I- 
ELT+ 
vs. I- 
ELTâ) based only on the 65 participants used in the training data-
set, thus maintaining independence between the training and testing 
datasets. Thus, for a given feature set size, the features included in the 
model could vary across participants. For each feature set, the z- 
scores 
from the 65 participants in the training set were used to build a classi-
fication model. This model was then applied to the z- 
scores from the 
participant left out (test dataset) from the same feature set to predict 
their I- 
ELT status (0 or 1). For every participant, accuracy of classifica-
tion was assessed for (1) overall accuracy, (2) sensitivity (proportion of 
I- 
ELT+ participant correctly classified), and (3) specificity (proportion of 
I- 
ELTâ participants correctly classified).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Behavioral differences
As seen in Table 1, the groups were matched in terms of age, gen-
der, estimated IQ, PTSD diagnosis and severity, combat exposure, 
and depression. Analyses of group- 
level behavioral differences are 
summarized in Table 2 and Figure 2. Collectively, I- 
ELT+ participants 
showed deficits in sustained attention ability (i.e., higher error rates 
and lower dâ scores) compared to the I- 
ELTâ control group. These find-
ings remained significant after simultaneously controlling for current 
PTSD and depression symptom severity, number of lifetime mild TBIs, 
and age using an ANCOVA with the four additional independent vari-
ables included as continuous covariates (I- 
ELT factor: F1,59 = 9.427,

p = .003). None of the covariates were found to be significant in this 
model (p > .22 for all three; see Table 3). We found significantly more 
omission errors in the I- 
ELT+ group and a trend toward more com-
mission errors. From the distribution of omission errors, we found no 
difference in the overall omission durations, defined by the number of 
consecutive nontarget/city trials for which participants failed to re-
spond, but observed a significant increase in the number of discrete 
omission error periods (Table 2). Thus, the increase in omission error 
rate was not due to extended periods of nonresponsiveness in the I- 
ELT+ group but rather increased rates of intermittent failures to main-
tain task performance. Furthermore, the reaction times to nontarget/
city images were significantly more variable across the whole task in 
the I- 
ELT+ group, reflected in the CV measure. In contrast, no group 
level differences were found for either criterion or the mean reaction 
time.
As noted in the Participants section, the I- 
ELTâ group included 
individuals who had been exposed to a noninterpersonal trauma be-
fore 18 years of age (N = 26/48). To examine if the behavioral differ-
ences we observed across the I- 
ELT+ and I- 
ELTâ group are specific 
to trauma of an interpersonal nature, we compared the performance 
of the 26 I- 
ELTâ participants with a history of noninterpersonal 
trauma before 18 years of age to the I- 
ELT+ group and the remain-
ing 22 I- 
ELTâ participants with no history of trauma before 18 years 
of age. For all behavioral performance measures, the same pattern 
of differences was observed for the I- 
ELT+ group compared to the 
I- 
ELTâ with or without a history of noninterpersonal trauma before 
age 18 years. In contrast, no difference was found for any behavioral 
measure when comparing the I- 
ELTâ participants with versus those 
without a history of noninterpersonal trauma before 18 years of age. 
Collectively, these results demonstrate that deficits in sustained at-
tention ability in this sample are specific to early life traumas of an 
interpersonal nature. Thus, for all of the following imaging analyses, 
no differentiation was made of participants in the I- 
ELTâ group who 
had, or had not, been exposed to a noninterpersonal trauma before 
18 years of age.
3.2 | Functional connectivity of the amygdala
Group- 
level differences in bilateral amygdala connectivity were found 
in two clusters (Figure 3). A decrease in functional connectivity was 
found between the amygdala and the right parahippocampal gyrus for 
the I- 
ELT+ group relative to the I- 
ELTâ group. In contrast, an increase 
in functional connectivity was observed between the amygdala and 
the right middle frontal gyrus in the I- 
ELT+ group. We note that the 
same two clusters survived when a more conservative threshold was 
used, with cluster- 
corrected thresholds for p < .05 given by nominal 
p = .005; cluster size â¥ 48. At an even more conservative threshold 
using a nominal p = .001 (cluster size > 17), only the right middle fron-
tal gyrus cluster survived thresholding. However, as seen below, the 
additional analyses completed next further demonstrate that informa-
tion distinguishing the I- 
ELT+ and I- 
ELTâ groups is seen in the right 
parahippocampal- 
amygdala connectivity patterns.

To test whether these effects are driven by I- 
ELT or rather common 
I- 
ELT comorbidities, a whole- 
brain ANCOVA was run comparing the 
bilateral amygdala connectivity patterns across the I- 
ELT+ and I- 
ELTâ 
groups with age, current PTSD severity, current depression severity, 
and number of lifetime mild TBIs as continuous covariates. Results of 
this analysis showed the same two clusters and differences in connec-
tivity patterns across the I- 
ELT groups after controlling for all covari-
ates, indicating that participant age and the additional clinical factors 
cannot account for the amygdala connectivity differences.
3.3 | Functional connectivity patterns predict 
behavioral performance
Leave- 
one- 
subject- 
out (LOSO) multiple linear regression analyses 
were completed to test if the functional connectivity differences 
predict behavioral performance. Figure 4 (top panels) shows the cor-
relation between the observed and predicted dâ from the LOSO mul-
tiple linear regression model. A significant positive correlation was 
observed [r = .4393, p = .0002], indicating that patterns of functional 
connectivity between the left and right amygdala to the right parahip-
pocampal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus predicted individual 
differences in sustained attention ability. Note that these ROIs were 
defined based on group- 
level differences in history of I- 
ELT, and thus 
were agnostic to individual performance measures (dâ). We used the 
same approach to also predict reaction time variability (CV) scores 
(see Figure 4). Although weaker, a significant positive correlation was 
found between the observed and predicted reaction time variability 
scores [r = .266, p = .031]. In order to illustrate the four connections 
used in the cross- 
validated multiple regression procedure, we also 
plot in the bottom half of Figure 4 the first- 
order correlations of each

connection with the two behavioral measures of interest. Without 
using the LOSO cross- 
validation procedure, across the full sample for 
dâ the left amygdala connection with the right parahippocampal gyrus 
and right middle frontal gyrus show the strongest relationship (r = .37, 
p = .002 and r = â.34, p = .005, respectively). For the right amyg-
dala connections, only the connection with the right middle frontal 
gyrus showed a significant relationship with dâ (r = â.29, p = .017). In 
contrast, of all four amygdala connections only the left amygdala to 
right parahippocampal gyrus showed a significant relationship with 
CV (r = â.25, p = .04; all others p â¥ .08). Of note, all of these corre-
lations comparing amygdala connections to behavioral performance 
independently show the relationship across the entire dataset with-
out using cross- 
validation. These first- 
order correlations demonstrate 
that when predicting behavioral performance, prediction ability is im-
proved by combining information across all four features.
To test whether including current PTSD or depression severity, or 
the age of participants, as additional independent variables improved 
prediction ability, the same LOSO multiple linear regression approach 
was utilized with seven independent variables (the four connectivity 
scores, CAPS current scores, DASS depression severity score, and the 
age of participants in years). Results of this analysis showed no im-
provement in prediction ability regardless of whether one, two, or all 
three additional variables were included as predictors in the models 
(dâ: 0.391 < r < .430; CV: 0.184 < r < .249).
3.4 | Amygdala functional connectivity predictions of 
I- 
ELT status
A whole- 
brain ROI- 
level classification analysis was completed to 
determine whether amygdala functional connectivity with the ana-
tomically parcellated whole brain (see ROI Selection) is sensitive to 
differences between participant groups and if these differences can be 
used to predict I- 
ELT status. This provides another way to assess the 
importance of amygdala- 
parahippocampal and amygdala- 
prefrontal 
connectivity to I- 
ELT status, identify other amygdala connections im-
portant to I- 
ELT status, and determine how specific/sensitive task- 
related amygdala connectivity is in predicting I- 
ELT status. Figure 5 
shows the decoding accuracy as a function of the number of features 
used in the model. The best model used 31 features with an overall ac-
curacy rate of 70% and prediction accuracy saturating for larger fea-
ture sets with no increase in the average prediction accuracy beyond 
this point, most likely due to increased modeling of noise in the train-
ing data set with greater feature numbers. The 31 features model has 
a specificity of 73%, correctly classifying 35/48 I- 
ELTâ participants. 
The sensitivity of the model is 62%, correctly classifying 11/18 I- 
ELT+ 
participants. The diagnostic odds ratio of the model is 3.55.
To determine if the overall accuracy of the 31- 
feature model was 
significantly above chance, Monte Carlo permutation testing was com-
pleted. Here, the null- 
model was that the pattern of z- 
scores is not 
related to I- 
ELT status. For this, the 31- 
feature model procedure was 
repeated 1000 times. Prior to each iteration, the I- 
ELT status labels 
(0âs or 1âs) were randomly shuffled. The entire 66 LOSO fold was then 
repeated for each shuffled label set. After each participantâs status was 
classified, the average accuracy of the model across participants was 
calculated. After 1000 iterations, the distribution of accuracy scores 
that would happen by chance was calculated. The significance of the 
31- 
feature model, the p- 
value, was then calculated as the proportion 
of the shuffled models that had an overall accuracy rate equal to or 
greater than the observed accuracy rate. Results of this showed only 
28/1000 random models that met this criterion (p = .028).
For any individual participant left out, the features used in the 
model could vary. Figure 5 shows the 12 ROIs selected as features in 
all 66 participant models with the color indicating whether the ROIs 
showed increased (yellow) or decreased (blue) connectivity with the 
amygdala seed ROIs in the I- 
ELT+ relative to the I- 
ELTâ group. These 
12 ROIs contributed 16 features to the model as follows: two ROIs 
connected to the left amygdala only, six ROIs were connected to the 
right amygdala only, and the remaining four ROIs contributed eight 
features with connections to both the right and left amygdala includ-
ing the left and right cerebellar tonsils, the left parahippocampal gyrus 
and the right middle frontal gyrus. Importantly, these features include 
ROIs spanning the same regions observed in the whole brain voxel- 
wise analysis, namely the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right 
middle frontal gyrus. Thus, taking an ROI- 
level approach, the func-
tional connectivity of the left and right amygdala with the same two 
regions seen in the voxel- 
level analyses were found to differentiate 
individuals with and without a history of I- 
ELT. Additionally, the re-

et al., 2011).
4 | DISCUSSION
In the current study, we examined the connectivity of the amyg-
dala during a sustained attention task in groups of Veterans with 
and without exposure to interpersonal early life trauma, defined as 
physical/sexual abuse or witnessing family violence before the age 
of eighteen. Our findings suggest that individuals exposed to I- 
ELT 
show general deficits in sustained attention to stimuli without emo-
tional valence. Specifically, the I- 
ELT+ group had more lapses and 
fluctuations of sustained attention, reflected in the lower dâ scores 
and increased reaction time variability (CV), respectively. In contrast, 
factors related to the strategy used by participants (Fortenbaugh

et al., 2015), reaction time and criterion, showed no difference be-
tween the groups. These observed patterns were significant only 
when comparing individuals suffering from interpersonal types of 
trauma, as opposed to any traumatic exposure during childhood. 
This was confirmed by the null finding when comparing the I- 
ELTâ 
individuals who reported noninterpersonal trauma before 18 (such 
as a car accident or natural disaster) with individuals who reported 
no traumatic exposure before 18 years of age. The observed behav-
ioral deficits in I- 
ELT+ individuals were accompanied by decreased 
connectivity between the amygdala and the right parahippocampal 
gyrus and increased connectivity between the amygdala and the 
right middle frontal gyrus while participants were engaged in the 
task. Across all participants, there was a significant association be-
tween behavioral performance (dâ and CV) and the strengths of these 
amygdala connections. Importantly, both the behavioral and amyg-
dala connectivity findings remained significant after controlling for 
current psychiatric symptoms (e.g., PTSD and depression), age, and 
number of mTBIs across the lifetime. These results suggest that the 
present findings were able to isolate unique behavioral and neuro-
biological deficits in sustained attention associated with a history of 
I- 
ELT. This is notable in that the behavioral and neuroimaging data 
is collected years and many times decades after the interpersonal 
traumatic events and can be seen despite potential differences in 
intervening events that affect cognition and neural functioning (e.g., 
positive influences such as psychotherapy or education and negative 
events such as combat exposure or other traumatic events that 
occur in adulthood).
Collectively, these results extend previous findings of behavioral 
deficits in sustained attention by highlighting a novel mechanism that 
may contribute to these deficits, namely, atypical amygdala connectiv-
ity patterns with regions normally engaged during sustained attention. 
While previous studies have suggested that a history of I- 
ELT may alter 
functional connectivity of the amygdala (Philip, Kuras, et al., 2013; 
Philip, et al., 2013; Philip et al., 2014), this work has been agnostic to 
the possible cognitive consequences. By demonstrating that altered 
connectivity patterns can predict behavioral impairments, the present 
results suggest that how limbic and attention regions communicate 
can impact fundamental cognitive processes well into adulthood.
Beyond identifying group differences in functional connectivity 
with the amygdala in circumscribed regions with a mass univariate 
voxel- 
wise approach, we also found, using multivariate modeling, that 
amygdala connectivity across the entire brain was able to predict indi-
vidual I- 
ELT status with 70% accuracy. While a 70% accuracy rate may 
not provide a more reliable measure to clinically diagnosing a history 
of I- 
ELT than self- 
report, this level of classification accuracy demon-
strates that there exists significant brainâbehavior relationships 
wherein a history of I- 
ELT is associated with significant alterations in 
amygdala functional connectivity patterns that are evident years, if not 
decades, after the traumatic events. Thus, even after accounting for 
a variety of potential confounding factors such as current PTSD and

depression symptoms, there exist significant neurobiological markers 
of early life trauma that may underlie cognitive deficits in individuals 
with I- 
ELT. Across all participants, the ROIs consistently identified in 
the classification analysis included the right middle frontal gyrus and 
parahippocampal gyrus clusters found in the voxel- 
level analysis. An 
additional region was also identified in the left inferior parietal lobe, 
falling within the frontoparietal control network. This region has been 
previously found to be engaged during the same sustained attention 
task (Esterman et al., 2013), suggesting that altered amygdala connec-
tivity in individuals with a history of I- 
ELT may broadly impact the net-
work involved in sustained attentional control processes. The lower 
sensitivity of the multivariate classification analysis compared to the 
specificity (61% vs. 73%) is consistent with the notion that not every 
individual exposed to I- 
ELT will develop the same atypical amygdala 
functional connectivity pattern. This may be due to a variety of influ-
ences, from genetic factors to age of exposure to the traumatic event. 
However, the fact that classification reached 70% when we only in-
cluded 3.5% of the potential brain connections (232/6670 connec-
tions for a 116 parcellation) highlights the high probability of amygdala 
dysfunction in this population, but also leaves open the possibility that 
functional connectivity patterns between other brain regions could 
further help to identify individuals with a history of I- 
ELT. Indeed, re-
cent analyses of functional connectivity measures during sustained 
attention tasks have highlighted broad networks of regions outside at-
tention networks that can identify individuals with sustained attention 
deficits like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Rosenberg et al., 
2016). While the present results were able to identify neurobiological 
markers that are unique to individuals with a history of I- 
ELT, future 
analyses taking into account a broader range of connections across 
the brain may be able to assess the relationships between a history 
of I- 
ELT, current psychiatric symptoms, and behavioral performance. 
Additionally, using longitudinal designs it may be possible to use this 
neurobiological marker of I- 
ELT to track behavioral performance tra-
jectories across the lifespan within groups of individuals who all share a 
history of I- 
ELT to determine if this marker is associated with different 
trajectories. For example, do individuals with a positive history of I- 
ELT 
who also have these atypical amygdala connectivity patterns benefit 
more or less from cognitive/psychological therapy compared to those 
without these amygdal connectivity patterns? Do they show acceler-
ated age- 
related cognitive declines in sustained attention ability?
With regard to previous studies of I- 
ELT and the amygdala, our 
findings provide a broader framework of the amygdalaâs role in I- 
ELT, particularly highlighting its contribution to poorer nonaffective 
cognitive performance. Studies of I- 
ELT have largely suggested that 
the impact of stress on development is seen primarily in an affective 
context (Tottenham et al., 2010). In short, emotional stimuli provoke 
an increase in the amygdalaâs reactivity, which overwhelms the in-
hibitory activity in prefrontal top- 
down control regions, resulting in 
an impaired capacity of individuals to self- 
regulate. This mechanism, 
which echoes the basic neuroanatomy of fear- 
conditioning (LeDoux, 
2000; Phelps, Delgado, Nearing, & LeDoux, 2004), likely contributes 
to increased risk for later psychological disorders like PTSD and major 
depression (Shin & Liberzon, 2010). However, this mechanism of 
dysregulated amygdala activity has previously been studied without 
taking into account the often- 
reported broader cognitive deficits in 
executive functions that are seen in many individuals exposed to I- 
ELT 
(van der Kolk, 2003). These impairments in executive function may 
not be an independent process to the amygdala- 
prefrontal emotional 
loop, but rather be a related process that further increases the risk for 
adverse outcome after childhood abuse. Because of the nature of our 
paradigm, this study adds an important dimension to this perspective 
in showing that the dysregulation of the amygdala is not contingent 
upon the presence of emotional stimuli, but rather seems independent 
of the explicit affective nature of the task being performed.
There are at least two potential mechanisms by which the ob-
served amygdala connectivity patterns may impair sustained attention. 
On the one hand, it may be that the amygdala interferes with normal 
prefrontal control mechanisms via deregulated salience detection and 
perceptual filtering (Mitchell et al., 2008). However, we also observed 
decreased connectivity between the amygdala and right parahippo-
campal gyrus in those with I- 
ELT compared to those without. This 
echoes findings from various studies of abnormal parahippocampal 
activity associated with PTSD (Francati, Vermetten, & Bremner, 2007). 
Interestingly, a study by Falconer et al. (2008) investigated inhibitory 
control in participants with and without PTSD, using a Go/No- 
Go 
task. Their findings showed that healthy participants displayed greater 
activity of the parahippocampal region compared to individuals with 
PTSD when contrasting the No- 
Go and Go trials. While this suggests 
that increased activity of the parahippocampal region is beneficial for 
cognitive performance, other studies have shown that stress may af-
fect the activity of this region and that therapies can help decrease 
its reactivity (Goldin & Gross, 2010). Thus, the overall activity of this 
region may fluctuate significantly with the level of stress experienced 
and the type of task used to probe its behavior.
Finally, it may be that the context of cognitive testing feels more 
intrinsically stressful, resulting in performance levels beyond the opti-
mal arousal window (Scholz et al., 2009). We note, however, that the 
tendency to find the present cognitive task more inherently stressful 
may be due to disruptions in the frontoparietal or limbic systems out-
lined above. Either way, it appears that, independent of emotional reg-
ulation, simple attention skills may already be impaired in individuals 
with I- 
ELT. If this is the case, then it might be beneficial for therapies 
to include attention training as a foundation for other types of be-
havior modification (e.g., tonic and phasic attention training; DeGutis 
& Van Vleet, 2010). Beyond modulating and potentially improving 
treatment outcomes, sustained attention abilities have been associ-
ated with multiple aspects of daily living and functional outcomes in-
cluding academic achievement (Steinmayr, Ziegler, & TrÃ¤uble, 2010), 
driver safety and accidents (Edkins & Pollock, 1997; Yanko & Spalek, 
2014), and the ability to develop effective social communication 
skills (Bennett Murphy, Laurie- 
Rose, Brinkman, & McNamara, 2007). 
Additionally, recent developments have suggested that sustained at-
tention ability may provide a gating mechanism that helps to preserve 
general cognitive abilities during neurodegeneration associated with 
aging (Robertson, 2013, 2014; Wilson et al., 2013). Collectively, these 
findings suggest that above and beyond any emotional disturbances

that may be associated with early life trauma, concurrent deficits in 
sustained attention ability can negatively impact multiple facets of an 
individualâs life throughout the lifespan. Additionally, as psychother-
apy is itself a learning- 
based process that involves not only cumulative 
learning but also changing how one interacts with the world, both fea-
tures that sustained attention is known to be involved with, deficits 
in sustained attention may prohibit or slow learning and achievement 
of therapy- 
related goals. Thus, addressing sustained attention deficits 
in addition to emotional and/or psychiatric symptoms may facilitate 
treatment in these areas.
This study examined performance in a sample of Veterans. While 
it may be true that Veterans represent a specific subset of the gen-
eral population, the two samples were well controlled for a variety 
of factors that may be unique to Veterans, such as combat exposure 
and number of lifetime mild TBIs. The two samples were additionally 
matched in terms of current PTSD severity, and we note that I- 
ELT has 
been associated with an increased risk for mental health issues later 
in life, including PTSD, in a variety of samples that do not share the in-
creased risk for trauma exposure in Veterans. Thus, while the specific 
type of trauma experienced in adulthood by our Veteran sample (e.g., 
combat) may be unique, the fact that these participants were exposed 
to traumatic events as adults is not. Given these factors, the inclusion 
of Veterans should not limit the generalizability our findings to male 
non- 
Veterans. Furthermore, the TRACTS cohort benefits from an in- 
depth psychological assessment that allowed us to include validated 
clinical measures as covariates in our models.
One limitation of the sample is the low number of females, which 
is representative of military samples but which prevented us from 
performing any analyses with sex as a primary factor. Specifically, it 
must be noted that of the I- 
ELT+ group, only a single participant was 
female. While it is possible that the nature of the traumatic experi-
ence may have been different depending on the sex of the participant, 
our analyses do not show significant outliers in PTSD severity or per-
formance that would indicate the presence of two behavioral pheno-
types. Most studies of childhood trauma have either examined one 
specific gender or have reported groups that were uneven, preventing 
them from conducting gender- 
related analyses of the impact of ELT 
on amygdala structure and function (Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). 
However, current research suggests that potential gender differences 
do exist in sustained attention ability and the strategy used by partic-
ipants in completing sustained attention tasks. In particular, women 
have been found to take a more cautious approach to such tasks, with 
slower overall reaction times (Blatter et al., 2006; Riley et al., 2016). 
While the cause of these gender differences remains unknown, with 
some work indicating that cultural factors such a gender inequality 
may modulate these differences (Riley et al., 2016), it remains an in-
teresting question for future work whether males and females differ 
in their sustained attention ability independent of early life experi-
ences and whether a history of early life trauma interacts with any 
potential baseline differences. Additionally, baseline differences in 
amygdala functional connectivity have been observed across men and 
women (Kilpatrick, Zald, Pardo, & Cahill, 2006), as well as differences 
in evoked amygdala activity during an emotional memory task (Cahill 
et al., 2001). To our knowledge, no work thus far has directly tested for 
gender differences in amygdala activity on sustained attention or vig-
ilance tasks using nonaffective stimuli. Given the current literature on 
gender differences in amygdala functioning on affective tasks (Cahill 
et al., 2001; Killgore, Oki, & Yurgelun- 
Todd, 2001; Schneider, Habel, 
Kessler, Salloum, & Posse, 2000), however, future work including 
greater numbers of female veterans may help to uncover any potential 
gender differences in the relationship between amygdala functioning 
and sustained attention ability.
Additional studies may also help to uncover any potential differ-
ences that may exist between the type of I- 
ELT experienced, current 
cognitive functioning, and the gradCPT task. In the present sample, I- 
ELT classification was conducted using the TLEQ and included trauma 
such as physical and sexual abuse. The TLEQ is a validated tool that 
offers the benefit of covering a wider range of traumatic events that 
may occur across the lifespan, but it was not developed to solely focus 
on early life trauma. In its breadth, the TLEQ is limited in the amount 
of information it provides in terms of abuse- 
related traumas. It also 
does not provide information relative to emotional and physical ne-
glect, which have been shown to impact psychological and biological 
development (Dannlowski et al., 2012; Hanson et al., 2013; Sheridan, 
Fox, Zeanah, McLaughlin, & Nelson, 2012). While the TLEQ does not 
delve into the specifics of types of trauma, it has been shown to be 
a valid measure for detecting whether or not early life trauma oc-
curred (Clancy et al., 2006; Corbo et al., 2014; Kubany et al., 2000; 
Van Voorhees et al., 2012). Given this and our sample size, subsamples 
based on type of I- 
ELT were not tested individually. We note, though, 
that a recent study on the validity of retrospective reports (Hardt & 
Rutter, 2004) suggests the greatest bias occurs in the details of abuse, 
not whether abuse occurs, suggesting that the broad level of classifi-
cation used in the present study (I- 
ELT+ vs. I- 
ELTâ) is most appropriate 
given our sample size and population. Considering these factors, we 
believe that our findings, while limited in terms of the impact of vari-
ous abuse- 
related traumas, do provide consistent and important find-
ings that support greater efforts towards characterizing the cognitive 
and neural impact of interpersonal trauma in childhood.
In conclusion, this study underscores the lasting negative impact 
that I- 
ELT can have on basic cognitive processes, and demonstrates a 
relationship between behavioral deficits on a nonemotional sustained 
attention task and altered amygdala connectivity. The present results 
further shows the need to explore brain activity with a global perspec-
tive that allows detecting relationships between structures that may 
not have been previously shown using other paradigms. With such an 
approach, we may be able to develop classification methods that could 
contribute to the elaboration of new and improved diagnostic tools 
and interventions.
