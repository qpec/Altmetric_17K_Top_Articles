Abstract
Background
Observational studies have reported an association between obesity, as measured by ele-
vated body mass index (BMI), in early adulthood and risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). How-
ever, bias potentially introduced by confounding and reverse causation may have
influenced these findings. Therefore, we elected to perform Mendelian randomization (MR)
analyses to evaluate whether genetically increased BMI is associated with an increased
risk of MS.
Methods and Findings
Employing a two-sample MR approach, we used summary statistics from the Genetic Inves-
tigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and the International MS Genetics
Consortium (IMSGC), the largest genome-wide association studies for BMI and MS,
respectively (GIANT: n = 322,105; IMSGC: n = 14,498 cases and 24,091 controls). Seventy
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genome-wide significant (p < 5 x 10−8) for
BMI in GIANT (n = 322,105) and were investigated for their association with MS risk in the
IMSGC. The effect of each SNP on MS was weighted by its effect on BMI, and estimates
were pooled to provide a summary measure for the effect of increased BMI upon risk of MS.
Our results suggest that increased BMI influences MS susceptibility, where a 1 standard
deviation increase in genetically determined BMI (kg/m2) increased odds of MS by 41%
(odds ratio [OR]: 1.41, 95% CI 1.20–1.66, p = 2.7 x 10−5, I2 = 0%, 95% CI 0–29). Sensitivity
analyses, including MR-Egger regression, and the weighted median approach provided no
evidence of pleiotropic effects. The main study limitations are that, while these sensitivity
analyses reduce the possibility that pleiotropy influenced our results, residual pleiotropy is
difficult to exclude entirely.

 Conclusion
Genetically elevated BMI is associated with risk of MS, providing evidence for a causal role for
obesity in MS etiology. While obesity has been associated with many late-life outcomes, these
findings suggest an important consequence of childhood and/or early adulthood obesity.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease that carries a large social and economic
burden.
• The risk factors that cause MS remain poorly understood.
• Previous observational epidemiological studies have reported an association between
elevated body mass index (BMI) in early adulthood and risk of MS; however, lifestyle
factors that influence BMI may bias the relationship between BMI and MS.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• The researchers tested whether inherited genetic variation that influences BMI is associ-
ated with MS. Such analyses provide an estimate of the relationship between BMI and
MS that is not influenced by confounding factors, with the exception of confounding by
ancestry; since assignment to genotype at conception is a random process, it breaks asso-
ciations with other potential confounding factors.
• Using data from the largest genome-wide association study consortia for MS and BMI,
the researchers provided evidence supporting elevated BMI as a causal risk factor for MS.
• A genetically determined change in the BMI category from overweight to obese was
associated with a substantially increased risk of MS in this study.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Elevated BMI could be an important, and potentially modifiable, risk factor for MS.
• This provides further rationale to address rising obesity rates and to investigate whether
interventions that promote a healthy lifestyle may help to mitigate MS risk.
Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that
results in chronic disability for the majority of those affected [1]. The disease has an important
impact on the health economy of many countries [2], since current treatment regimens are
costly and have adverse side-effect profiles and/or limited efficacy [3]. MS etiology is poorly
understood and, consequently, additional research is needed to identify potentially causal risk
factors that could help guide prevention efforts.

 Several observational studies have suggested that an elevated body mass index (BMI) in
early adulthood is associated with an increased risk of developing MS [4–6]. In the Nurse’s
Health study, a prospective cohort study of 238,371 women, BMI � 30 kg/m2 at 18 y of age
was associated with more than a 2-fold increased risk of MS (relative risk: 2.25, 95% CI 1.50–
3.37) [4]. In addition, elevated BMI has been shown to affect the immune system by promoting
a proinflammatory state [7–10], and it has been proposed that adipose-derived hormones,
such as leptin [11] and adiponectin [12], might mediate this, providing a possible mechanistic
link between obesity and risk of MS.
However, it remains uncertain whether this relationship is causal since it is difficult to fully
protect observational studies from bias due to reverse causation or confounding. Mendelian ran-
domization (MR) [13] offers a way to investigate potentially causal relationships by using
genetic associations to explore the effect of modifiable exposures on outcomes. Since alleles are
both independently segregated and randomly assigned at meiosis, bias inherent to observational
study designs, such as confounding, is likely to be greatly minimized in MR studies (Fig 1).
While increased BMI in childhood has been associated with numerous poor health out-
comes [14,15], efforts to control obesity in children has been hindered by a lack of motivation
in youth, due in part to the perception that most obesity-related diseases have a late age of
onset [16]. However, if obesity were causally associated with MS (median age of onset 29 y)
[17], this would provide a more immediate and severe consequence of early-life obesity,
increasing motivation for its control.
In order to test whether genetically increased BMI is causally associated with risk of MS, we
undertook an MR analysis using summary statistics from the Genetic Investigation of Anthro-
pometric Traits (GIANT) consortium (up to n = 339,224) [18] and the International Multiple
Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC, up to n = 14,498 cases and 24,091 controls) [19,20],
the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date for BMI and MS, respectively.
Methods
Data Sources and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Selection
Effect estimates for SNPs associated with BMI were obtained from the GIANT consortium,
which is a meta-analysis of 125 GWASs in more than 339,224 individuals [18]. For the purpose
Fig 1. Schematic representation of an MR analysis. This diagram shows that SNPs associated with BMI
were selected from the GIANT consortium. Corresponding effect estimates for these SNPs upon risk of MS
were obtained from the IMSGC. Because of the randomization of alleles at meiosis, SNPs are not associated
with confounding variables that may bias estimates obtained from observational studies.

 of this MR, we limited our selection of SNPs to those that achieved genome-wide significance
(p < 5 x 10−8) in the European sex-combined analysis (up to n = 322,105). Effect estimates of
these BMI-associated SNPs on the risk of MS were assessed using the summary statistics from
the IMSGC Immunochip study, which included 14,498 cases and 24,091 controls of European
ancestry [19]. When effect estimates were not available in the Immunochip study, since the
genotyping platform used was not genome-wide, effect estimates were obtained from the
IMSGC/Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (IMSGC/WTCCC2) GWAS, which
included 9,772 cases and 17,376 controls [20].
When a BMI-associated SNP was not present in either study, we selected proxy SNPs that
were highly correlated with the variant of interest (r2 > 0.8). We identified potential proxies
and measured linkage disequilibrium (LD) in samples of European descent from the UK10K
consortium (n = 3,781) [21]. If no proxy was found using this method, we verified our search
using SNAP [22,23]. As we did with our index SNPs, we selected summary statistics for our
proxies first from the Immunochip study and then from the IMSGC/WTCCC2 study if they
were not available in the Immunochip study.
Cohorts participating in the IMSGC and GIANT GWAS consortia received ethics approval
from local institutional review boards and informed consent from all participants. Summary
statistics from these consortia can be downloaded at the following links: IMSGC, https://www.

SNP Validation
LD assessment.
One condition of MR is that the exposure-related SNPs (the instrumental
variables) must not be in LD with each other, since this might result in confounding if a SNP is
highly correlated with another SNP used as an instrumental variable [24]. To ensure this, we
measured LD between all of our selected SNPs in European samples from UK10K (n = 3,781)
[21] using PLINK software version 1.90 [25]. SNPs were removed from our analysis if their
measured LD had an r2 greater than 0.05. We retained the SNP most strongly associated with
BMI, by p-value, when two, or more, SNPs were in LD.
Pleiotropy assessment.
An important assumption of MR is that each SNP must only
influence risk of the outcome through the exposure under investigation, as the inclusion of
SNPs that contribute through a pleiotropic pathway could bias estimates. This can be difficult
to test when examining an anthropometric trait such as BMI, which is influenced by many dif-
ferent physiological mechanisms. Consequently, BMI-associated SNPs are likely to lie in genes
of different biological effects that may, or may not, influence MS risk independently of BMI.
To assess for the presence of pleiotropy, we used MR-Egger regression [26]. In brief, the
approach is based on Egger regression, which has been used to examine publication bias in the
meta-analysis literature [27]. Using the MR-Egger method, the SNP’s effect upon the exposure
variable is plotted against its effect upon the outcome, and an intercept distinct from the origin
provides evidence for pleiotropic effects. Funnel plots can also be used for visual inspection of
symmetry. Additionally, the slope of the MR-Egger regression can provide pleiotropy-cor-
rected causal estimates; however, this estimate of slope is underpowered unless the SNPs com-
bine to explain a large proportion of the variance in the exposure with varying effect sizes [26].
An important condition of this approach is that a SNP’s association with the exposure variable
must be independent of its direct effects upon the outcome (previously described as the InSIDE
assumption) [26], which may not always be satisfied in cases in which all pleiotropic effects can
be attributed to a single confounder. Nonetheless, the MR-Egger method can provide unbiased
estimates even if all the chosen SNPs are invalid [26].

 Additionally, the weighted median approach was used to examine pleiotropy [28]. Using
this method, MR estimates are ordered and weighted by the inverse of their variance. The
median MR estimate should remain unbiased as long as greater than 50% of the total weight
comes from SNPs without pleiotropic effects. The weighted median approach offers some
important advantages over MR-Egger because it improves precision and is more robust to vio-
lations of the InSIDE assumption. Therefore, we employed both methods as sensitivity analyses
to assess whether pleiotropy had influenced our results.
Population stratification assessment.
Population stratification is another potential source
of bias for MR analyses. Because of differences in allele frequencies, a SNP can be associated
with ancestry, which itself can be associated with disease risk. To limit this, we selected SNPs
and summary statistics from analyses that included only individuals of European descent for
both BMI and MS. However, residual population stratification may exist among European sub-
groups [29]. Therefore, to understand how this may affect our results, we searched the litera-
ture to explore whether BMI and MS covary geographically within Europe.
MR Estimates
We have previously applied the principles of MR to investigate the role of vitamin D in the eti-
ology of MS [30]. Here, we employed the same methods to examine BMI as a risk factor for MS
[30–32]. In brief, we selected SNPs that were genome-wide significant for BMI in the GIANT
consortium and then obtained the effect estimates of these SNPs on BMI. Corresponding
genetic effect estimates for these SNPs on the risk of MS were selected from the IMSGC. We
then applied a two-sample MR approach by weighting the effect estimate of each SNP on MS
by its effect on BMI. These estimates were then pooled using a fixed meta-analytic model
[33,34] to produce a summary measure of the effect of genetically elevated BMI upon MS risk.
This two-sample approach has equivalent statistical power to one-sample approaches [31] and
is favorable in this setting since large GWAS consortia exist for both BMI and MS and are thus
better powered than an MR study in a single cohort with a smaller sample size.
Bidirectional MR Analysis
Next, we sought to explore whether MS influences BMI. Therefore, we elected to perform a
bidirectional MR analysis to determine the effect of genetically increased risk of MS on BMI.
To do so, we selected SNPs that were genome-wide significant (p < 5 x 10−8) for MS in either
the Immunochip study, the IMSGC/WTCCC2 study, or other previously reported MS GWASs
[19,20,35]. With MS-associated SNPs now as the exposure, we then obtained corresponding
effect estimates from GIANT as the outcome. We next applied the same methods as above.
Sensitivity Analyses
To ensure that the inclusion of proxy SNPs did not introduce random error into our results, we
conducted sensitivity analyses where groups of SNPs were excluded. First, we removed all
proxies and retained only SNPs that had been directly genotyped in the Immunochip or
IMSGC/WTCCC2 studies. Next, we excluded only proxies with allele frequencies between 0.4
and 0.6, as it can be difficult to correctly match alleles for SNPs falling within this range since
different GWAS studies report slight fluctuations in allele frequencies. Since BMI is calculated
using both height and weight measurements, we were concerned that our results might be par-
tially confounded by height. Therefore, we next removed SNPs from our analysis that were
found to be in LD (r2 > 0.05) with any loci genome-wide significant for height as reported in
GIANT’s 2014 GWAS [36]. Lastly, we performed an analysis in which genetic effect sizes on
MS were selected exclusively from the IMSGC/WTCCC2 study.

 Results
SNP Selection
Overall, we identified 77 LD-independent SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance for
BMI in the GIANT consortium. However, not all of these SNPs were genotyped in the MS
datasets. Fourteen of these SNPs were included in the IMSGC Immunochip study, and a fur-
ther 20 in the IMSGC/WTCCC2 GWAS. Of the remaining SNPs, we next identified 36 proxies
with an r2 > 0.8: 12 from the IMSGC Immunochip study and 24 from the IMSGC/WTCCC2
GWAS. We could not identify proxies for seven of the BMI SNPs. A flow diagram of this SNP
selection process is shown in S1 Fig. Therefore, in total we used 70 SNPs for our MR analysis,
as shown in Table 1. The mean r2 for proxies was 0.94.
SNP Validation
We next tested whether any of the selected SNPs were influenced by LD, pleiotropy, or popula-
tion stratification. First, none of the SNPs were found to be in LD with each other at an r2 >
0.05. Second, the intercept term estimated from MR-Egger regression was centered at the ori-
gin with a confidence interval including the null (0.0013, 95% CI −0.010–0.013, p = 0.83)
(Table 2), suggesting that pleiotropy had not unduly influenced the results. This observation
was further confirmed by Fig 2, which represents a scatterplot of the effect estimates of SNPs
associated with BMI and their corresponding effect on MS risk. The plot also displays the
regression lines of our primary MR analysis (in red) and the MR-Egger adjusted for possible
pleiotropy (in blue). Additionally, we inspected the funnel plot for any asymmetry, which
would be suggestive of pleiotropy, and found the plot to the symmetrical (Fig 3). There is a
higher prevalence of obesity among Southern and Eastern European populations [37,38]. Con-
versely, these populations have a decreased burden of MS relative to their Northern European
counterparts [39]. Given the inversely correlated distributions of obesity and MS in Europe,
the inclusion of SNPs potentially associated with ancestry within Europe would tend to bias
our results towards the null (S2 Fig). Thus, residual effects of within-Europe ancestry would,
on average, tend to underestimate true effects.
MR Estimates
Using MR analyses, a 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI (kg/m2) was associated with a
41% increase in odds of MS (OR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.20–1.66, p = 2.72 x 10−5) (Table 2; Fig 4). The
I2 estimate for heterogeneity was 0% (95% CI 0%–29%). The slope of the MR-Egger regression
was consistent with these findings (Fig 2). The results obtained using the weighted median
approach further replicated this direction and magnitude of effect (OR: 1.26, 95% CI 0.98–1.62,
p = 0.08), providing no evidence for pleiotropy.
In bidirectional MR analyses, we initially identified 110 SNPs reported by the IMSGC as
genome-wide significant for MS; however, not all of these SNPs were ascertained directly in
GIANT. Therefore, we used a total of 99 instruments for this analysis. Our results suggest that
the genetic determinants of MS do not contribute to BMI (−0.0033 SD change in BMI per log
odds increase in MS, 95% CI −0.011–0.0042, p = 0.39). The estimate for heterogeneity was
large in this case (I2: 43.5%, 95% CI 28.3%–55.6%). There was also no evidence of pleiotropy
from the MR-Egger analyses (the intercept was centered at 0.002 with a 95% CI that included
the origin [95% CI −0.0009–0.005, p = 0.17]) and an MR-Egger slope consistent with previous
estimates (S3 and S4 Figs). Results from the weighted median analyses also were consistent
with the main findings, decreasing the probability that pleiotropy influenced the results.

 Sensitivity Analyses
We excluded proxy SNPs to understand if random error, introduced by the use of imperfect
proxies, had influenced our results. First, when all proxies were removed, we found a stronger
relationship between BMI and MS, with a 1 SD change increasing odds of MS by 65% (OR:
1.65, 95% CI 1.32–2.06, p = 1.18 x10-5 (Table 2; Fig 4). Similarly, when we removed only prox-
ies with allele frequencies between 0.4 and 0.6, we observed an OR of 1.48, similar to that
obtained in the primary analysis (OR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.25–1.74, p = 3.82 x 10−6) (Table 2; Fig 4).
In addition, we removed six SNPs that were in LD with known height loci (S1 Table), but
again, this did not importantly change the results (OR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.21–1.71, p = 2.93 x 10−5)

(inverse-variance weighting [IVW]), and the blue line shows the pleiotropy-adjusted MR-Egger regression line. The
estimated slope of the MR-Egger regression, expressed as an OR, was 1.35 (95% CI 0.91–2.02). The estimated MR-Egger
intercept term was 0.0013 (95% CI −0.010–0.013)

 (Fig 4). MR results using only the IMSGC/WTCCC2 study were again concordant with our
primary analysis (S1 Text and S2 Table).
Discussion
Using an MR study design, these results provide evidence that genetically elevated BMI is
strongly associated with an increased risk of MS, where a 1 SD increase in BMI conferred a
41% increase in the odds of MS. To place this in a clinical context, the mean SD for BMI
reported among cohorts in the GIANT consortium was 4.70 kg/m2 [18]. Therefore, our esti-
mates of a 41% increase in odds of MS correspond roughly to a change in BMI category from
Fig 3. MR-Egger regression funnel plot for BMI on MS analysis. Each SNP’s MR estimate is plotted against its minor-
allele frequency corrected association with BMI. A minor allele frequency (MAF) correction proportional to the SNP-BMI
standard error is used since a low-frequency allele is likely to be measured with low precision. Similar to the use of funnel
plots in the meta-analysis literature, this plot can be used for visual inspection of symmetry, where any deviation can be
suggestive of pleiotropy. We note that our plot appears generally symmetrical.

 overweight (�25 kg/m2) to obese (�30 kg/m2) as per WHO obesity guidelines [40]. This sug-
gests that childhood and early-adulthood BMI is an important modifiable risk factor for MS.
The results of our bidirectional MR analysis indicate that MS does not influence BMI status.
The results of the MR analysis may offer some of the best evidence to assess the causal role
of BMI in MS etiology since the results are less likely to be biased by confounding or reverse
causation than traditional observational epidemiological study designs. By employing the two-
sample MR approach, we were able to increase statistical power by selecting summary statistics
from the largest GWAS studies for BMI (n = 322,105) and MS (up to n = 14,498 cases and
24,091 controls). Additionally, since genetic variants are stable over an individual’s life, our
results represent lifetime risk of MS due to elevated BMI.
These findings may carry important public health implications because of the high preva-
lence of obesity in many countries [41]. For instance, results from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that approximately 17% of youth [42] and
35% of adults [43] living in the United States are considered to be obese. Therefore, the identifi-
cation of elevated BMI as a susceptibility factor for MS places a high proportion of the popula-
tion at a relatively higher risk for MS. Mean population BMI has increased in many Western
countries over the past several decades [41], which coincides with rising MS incidence rates,
particularly evident among females [44,45].
Elevated BMI has long been associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including
those resulting in adverse cardiometabolic outcomes [46,47]; however, symptoms of these dis-
eases typically do not manifest until the fifth or sixth decade of life [48,49]. In contrast, the
median age of onset for MS is 28–31 y [50]; thus, our findings may demonstrate a more imme-
diate consequence of elevated BMI. This provides further rationale to combat increasing youth
obesity rates by implementing community and school-based interventions that promote physi-
cal activity and nutrition.
Current evidence suggests that there are several potential mechanisms through which
increased BMI may affect MS risk; however, it remains unclear which of these pathways are
critical. Vitamin D is a strong candidate, given that previous MR analyses demonstrate that
genetically elevated BMI decreases 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [51], and we have recently pro-
vided strong evidence supporting a causal role for reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as a
risk factor for MS [30].
Elevated BMI has many physiological effects, and the exact mechanisms underlying the risk
for MS conferred by an increased BMI remain unclear. For instance, obesity is known to pro-
mote a proinflammatory state [7–10], offering a potential mechanistic link to autoimmunity.
In addition, results from a recent MR study show that increased BMI produces important

 effects on metabolite, lipoprotein, and hormone profiles [10]. In particular, adiponectin and
leptin, the adipose-derived hormones, have been previously associated with MS and MS-related
disability [52–54]. Under an obesogenic state, serum leptin levels rise whereas adiponectin lev-
els fall, and this has been shown to reduce the production of regulatory T cells [55] and anti-
inflammatory cytokines [56]. However, further research, such as prospective cohort studies or
MR analyses, is required in order to understand the functional role of obesity in the risk of MS.
Our study also has limitations. First, while we undertook multiple sensitivity analyses to
assess for pleiotropy, the possibility of residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude. However, con-
sistency across these approaches, and the fact that the MR-Egger intercept was centered at the
origin, provides evidence that pleiotropy did not greatly influence the results. We can also not
directly assess whether population stratification or compensatory mechanisms (otherwise
known as canalization) may be influencing our results; however, these would likely bias our
estimates towards the null [13]. While we ensured that our SNPs were not in LD with each
other, it remains possible that they are in LD with SNPs that influence unknown risk factors
for MS. Secondly, we note that both GIANT and the IMSGC used samples from the WTCCC
cohort; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of sample overlap. This may have intro-
duced bias into our results; however, given the sample size employed, this effect would likely be
small since the WTCCC comprised ~2.5% of the overall GIANT consortium. Third, because of
our use of summary-level statistics, we could not investigate nonlinear effects of BMI. Lastly,
we cannot determine whether an established and more actionable intermediate, such as vita-
min D, is primarily driving this causal relationship, nor can we conclude whether BMI influ-
ences MS progression.
In conclusion, these results provide evidence supporting a causal role for elevated BMI in
MS etiology. This provides further rationale for individuals at risk for MS to maintain a healthy
BMI. Whether vitamin D, or another established intermediate, is predominantly mediating
this relationship warrants further investigation.

with the 77 SNPs that were genome-wide significant (p < 5 x10-8) for BMI in GIANT’s Euro-
pean sex-combined analysis. Thirty-four SNPs were genotyped directly in either the Immuno-
chip or IMSGC/ WTCCC2 studies. An additional 36 proxies were identified with an r2 > 0.8.
Therefore, we used a total of 70 SNPs for our MR analysis.

gram is meant to illustrate how residual European population stratification may influence our
results through the use of a directed acyclic graph. Since the literature reports that Northern
European ancestry is associated with increased risk of MS but decreased BMI relative to Southern
Europeans, the inclusion of BMI SNPs also associated with Northern European ancestry would
tend to bias our estimates towards the null. This is similar to instances of negative confounding,
where the presence of population stratification causes us to underestimate the true effect.
