SUMMARY
Dengue is the world’s most prevalent mosquito-borne disease, with more than 200 million people
each year becoming infected. We used a mechanistic virus transmission model to determine
whether climate warming would change dengue transmission in Australia. Using two climate
models each with two carbon emission scenarios, we calculated future dengue epidemic potential
for the period 2046–2064. Using the ECHAM5 model, decreased dengue transmission was
predicted under the A2 carbon emission scenario, whereas some increases are likely under the B1
scenario. Dengue epidemic potential may decrease under climate warming due to mosquito
breeding sites becoming drier and mosquito survivorship declining. These results contradict most
previous studies that use correlative models to show increased dengue transmission under climate
warming. Dengue epidemiology is determined by a complex interplay between climatic, human
host, and pathogen factors. It is therefore naive to assume a simple relationship between climate
and incidence, and incorrect to state that climate warming will uniformly increase dengue
transmission, although in general the health impacts of climate change will be negative.
Key words: Arboviruses, climate (impact of), dengue fever, infectious disease epidemiology.
INTRODUCTION
Dengue is the world’s most common mosquito-borne
viral infection of humans, with an estimated 284–528
million infections occurring annually [1]. Global inci-
dence of dengue has increased in recent decades, with
outbreaks of ever-increasing size being recorded in
urban centres [2]. In Australia, dengue is an epidemic
disease, with importations via viraemic travellers
causing autochthonous transmission in the wet tropics
of the country’s northeast. Outbreaks of several hun-
dred cases are recorded regularly in this region, and
the size of locally transmitted outbreaks is steadily in-
creasing [3], as is the number of imported infections,
most commonly from Southeast Asia and Papua
New Guinea [4, 5].
Mosquitoes require appropriate climatic condi-
tions, and thus changes to the Earth’s climate that
have occurred and are predicted for the future [6]
will impact the transmission of diseases they transmit.
A number of models linking meteorological variables,
climate and dengue transmission have been developed.

 Some are empirical models, whereby dengue transmis-
sion output variables are related statistically to me-
teorological data inputs (e.g. [7, 8]), whereas others
make use of process-based (i.e. mechanistic) models,
some of which include vector life-table calculations [9].
Predictions of increased geographical range for den-
gue and consequent increased population risk have
been made (e.g. [10, 11]). Jetten & Focks [12] used a
version of the vectorial capacity equation to calculate
the relative increase in dengue transmission intensity
caused by a 2–4 °C increase in global temperature,
demonstrating increased intensity and geographical
range. Patz and others [10] used a similar approach
to demonstrate increased dengue transmission poten-
tial with a 1·16 °C average global temperature in-
crease, while Hales et al. [11] created a logistic
regression model to describe the current global dengue
transmission range in terms of vapour pressure (a
measure of atmospheric moisture) and predicted
extension of the dengue transmission range. More
recently, Liu-Helmersson and others [13] used expres-
sions of vectorial capacity to calculate dengue epidem-
ic potential (the propensity of mosquitoes to transmit
dengue). Importantly, they demonstrated the strong
temperature dependence of dengue epidemic poten-
tial, and also showed that diurnal temperature vari-
ation can have positive and negative impacts on
dengue transmission.
Projections based on statistical models trained on
existing dengue transmission ranges do not necessarily
reflect the current climatological limits to dengue
transmission. In Australia, dengue transmission has
historically occurred over much of the eastern and
western seaboards, and only retracted into its current
North Queensland range in the past 50 years [14].
This suggests that the current climate is suitable for
dengue transmission across a much greater range
than currently occurs.
More recently, Åstrom and others [15] proposed an
empirical model of dengue risk under future climate
that included socioeconomic factors as predictive vari-
ables. A decrease in dengue transmission was pre-
dicted for some regions if socioeconomic and climate
factors change as predicted. This work modelled his-
torical dengue ranges and then took into account
increases in financial prosperity; a negative influence
in dengue transmission owing primarily to decreased
mosquito-human contact rates.
Mechanistic, process based models explicitly de-
scribe the relationships between the local environment,
disease vectors (e.g. mosquitoes), the pathogen and
humans. Such models have been recommended for a
more holistic study of dengue–climate relationships
[12]. The Dengue Simulation Model (DENSiM) has
been used to model dengue transmission in endemic
and epidemic settings [16]. In a study of dengue out-
breaks in North Queensland, DENSiM was para-
meterized for Australian conditions and used to
demonstrate the role of weather as a determinant of
transmission [9]. DENSiM was also used to test the im-
pact of changing virus importation rate, and climate
change, on dengue transmission in Malaysia [17]. The
entomological component of DENSiM was recently
used to determine likely changes to vector bionomics
under climate warming [18]. Having such a validated,
mechanistic dengue simulation model at our disposal
presents an opportunity to test dengue receptivity of
different regions from first principles. That is, to test
the suitability of local climate (and in turn climate
change) without relying on previous dengue geograph-
ical range data which have inherent biases in reporting.
Using the parameterized DENSiM model for
Australia [9], in this study we characterized the
climate-determined dengue receptivity of some key
Australian urban centres. Then, using climate change
projections for the mid-21st century, we determined
whether dengue receptivity would change. Our con-
clusions have important public health implications
for Australia, as well as more general significance
for climate and health research.
METHODS
DENSiM and dengue receptivity measures
DENSiM [16], parameterized for Australian condi-
tions [9], was used to assess dengue receptivity in
Queensland for current and future climates. This par-
ameterization involved the training and validation of
both entomological (Supplementary Table S1) and
human population parameters, such as age-specific
birth and death rates and population densities [9]. In
brief, DENSiM (v. 3·27, University of California,
USA) is a mechanistic computer simulation of daily
dengue transmission in a human population. Humans
may become infected and in turn immune, to dengue
virus, which can be introduced via viraemic humans
or infected mosquitoes at rates and times specified by
the user. DENSiM is supported by entomological
inputs from the CIMSiM model, which is driven by
daily meteorological observations [9]. Dengue recep-
tivity is the ease with which dengue can be transmitted

 in an environment should the virus be present. Here
we characterized dengue receptivity in terms of out-
break probability and epidemic potential (Table 1).
The latter is the reciprocal of threshold mosquito
density, the number of mosquitoes required to sustain
local transmission. While we use the term ‘epidemic
potential’ coined by others [12, 13] we interpret mean-
ing to be relating to local transmission of new cases,
rather than satisfying local criteria for epidemic defini-
tion. The fewer mosquitoes that are required to sustain
transmission, the greater the probability of local trans-
mission (epidemic potential).
Modelling of dengue receptivity in current and future
climates
We calculated epidemic potential (Table 1) in the cur-
rent
climate
(1990–2011)
for
peak
transmission
months in Australia (December, January, February).
Calculations were also made for July, the month
with the lowest average incidence.
Calculations were made for four urban centres in
Queensland (Fig. 1). Cairns (population ∼224 000)
and
Townsville
(218 000) are within the
current
dengue transmission range, with transmission recorded
in both cities in most years [5, 19]. Aedes aegypti is pre-
sent in Rockhampton (60 000) but there have been no
incident dengue cases in recent decades [14]. Neither
Ae. aegypti nor incident dengue currently occur in
Brisbane (2 066 000) (last recorded in 1956) [14].
Threshold mosquito density (m) calculations made
using DENSiM
Simulations of mosquito populations were made for
each location for the period 1990–2011 (21 years)
using the CIMSiM sub-model within DENSiM [20].
For December, January, February, and July, thresh-
old mosquito density was calculated using the method
of Jetten & Focks [12], whereby the vectorial capacity
equation [21] was rearranged so that mosquito abun-
dance (m) could be calculated when the attack rate
(vectorial capacity) was set to 1 (sustaining transmis-
sion). To enable calculation of m for each month,
DENSiM default settings for probability of transmis-
sion from each viraemic mosquito with access to each
human in the simulation (0·9) and human to mosquito
(0·75) were used [16]. A daily adult mosquito survivor-
ship of 0·83 [20] was used as a constant. From
DENSiM simulations, average monthly values of
bites per person per day, and extrinsic virus incuba-
tion period, both of which vary with weather condi-
tions
and
time,
were
obtained
from
simulation
outputs. The following equation [12] was used to cal-
culate threshold mosquito density:
m = −ln P
( )
bca2Pn ,
where m = the threshold density required for dengue
transmission, P is the daily survival probability for
an individual mosquito, b is the probability that an in-
fectious mosquito transmits dengue while biting a sus-
ceptible human, c is the probability that a mosquito
acquires dengue infection while biting a viraemic
human, a is the number of bites per person per day,
and n is the duration in days of the extrinsic incuba-
tion period.

 plausible daily values from long-term projection data,
a statistical downscaling technique was used [22]. In
brief, this involved creation of a downscaling model,
which takes large-scale (in both time and space) re-
gional climate change predictions, and converts them
to daily timescale and single-point spatial predictions.
The models are tested for accuracy using historical me-

porates rapid economic growth, a global population
rise to 9 billion in 2050, changes towards a service and
information economy, and some reductions in material
intensity. The A2 scenario was also used, with slower
transition to renewable energy sources and higher car-
bon emissions [6]. In general, temperatures are expected

 to increase in all cities tested here under both emission
scenarios, although the magnitude of temperature
change varies with carbon scenario. The outlook for
rainfall is mixed, with some decreases expected in
Rockhampton and Brisbane, and increases predicted
in Cairns and Townsville (see Supplementary material).
Simulation locations
Simulations were performed for a fixed human popu-
lation size in each location. The cities are not demo-
graphically homogeneous, but rather are composed
of clusters of suburbs. For this reason, we decided to
test dengue receptivity in groups of 10 000 people for
the first year of each simulation. Demographic data
(birth and death rates, age group size) were obtained
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Population
sizes in each location increased from the initial 10 000
according to the birth and death rates programmed
into DENSiM.
Receptivity was characterized by outbreak prob-
ability and epidemic potential (reciprocal of the thresh-
old density of mosquitoes required for transmission;
Table 1). Receptivity was evaluated for December,
January, February (northern Australian wet season
when dengue incidence is highest) and July (dry season,
lowdengueincidence). Foreachsimulation run, a single
viraemic introduction was made for the selected month
and year, making each year a replicate for each climate
scenario (current and future). Thus, for each emission
scenario and climate scenario (current and future cli-
mate), and each of the four cities, virus was introduced
separately
in
four
different
months
(December,
January, February, July). Each simulation length was
21 years, with each year acting as a replicate. This
gave a total of 48 simulation variants, each being 21
years long. These in turn were replicated 10 times
each to calculate mean values (DENSiM has stochastic
functions in-built, with variations in food delivery to
mosquito larvae). Thus, a total of 480 separate simula-
tions were performed, with data extracted to calculate
the parameters described in Table 1.
RESULTS
Probability of dengue outbreaks and epidemic potential
Current climate
Dengue transmission is possible in the current climate
in all study centres, with Cairns most suitable
and Brisbane least. Probability of local dengue trans-
mission in the current climate following a single
viraemic
introduction
in
December,
January
or
February was 100% for Cairns. For other cities the
transmission probability varied depending on month.
Transmission probability ranged from 5% to 57% for
Townsville (peaking in February) (Figs 2 and 3).
Probability of transmission under current climate was
high for Rockhampton (10–86%, peaking in January),
and was low for Brisbane (10–33%, also peaking
in
February,
with
no
transmission
predicted
in
December). Epidemic potential was highest for Cairns
and lowest for Brisbane (Fig. 4).
Future climate
In the future, location and emission scenario will de-
termine
whether
epidemic
potential
increases
or
decreases (Fig. 4). Epidemic potential is predicted to
increase for Townsville and Rockhampton under the
B1 emission scenario. A predicted decrease for epi-
demic potential for all cities is made under the A2
emission scenario using MPI ECHAM 5 (Fig. 4).
In a future climate, outbreak probability in Cairns
is predicted to be unchanged from 100% under the
B1 scenario, but may decrease slightly under the A2
scenario (Figs 3 and 4). The B1 scenario also produces
predictions of increased dengue outbreak probability
for Rockhampton, Townsville, and Brisbane, whereas
under the A2 scenario is predictive of decreased out-
break probability.
DISCUSSION
Most studies of dengue under climate change for
Australia (and globally) predict increases in incidence
and range. Contrary to earlier studies we predict that
based on climate changes alone, dengue transmission
in Australia may remain stable, increase, or even de-
crease in the future. Our modelling incorporates not
only mosquito virus carriage and ecology, but also
human serology, and biting rates. This work does
not rely on previous training of statistical models
against the current dengue transmission range, but ra-
ther uses a mechanistic approach to calculate both
mosquito abundance and infectivity, together with
human infection.
Predicted decreases in dengue receptivity are pri-
marily due to changes in vector abundance, size and
survivorship. In previous studies we demonstrated
that climate change will likely reduce Ae. aegypti
abundance in Queensland under the A2 scenario,
due to greater evaporation and temperatures reducing

 breeding site productivity, and temperatures exceeding
the thermal optima for the species more often than in
the current climate [18]. A prediction for further
decreases in dengue vector abundance in southern
Queensland is consistent with historical observations
of the retraction of dengue from this region since the
mid-20th century [14]. Future dengue receptivity cal-
culations in this study for the A2 scenario all decrease,
a finding consistent with predicted future mosquito
bionomics. Conversely, some increases in dengue re-
ceptivity under the B1 scenario were predicted for
Townsville and Rockhampton, a finding consistent
with the increased mosquito abundance previously
predicted for the B1 scenario [14].
These results also demonstrate that the extent of cli-
mate change that occurs in the future will partly deter-
mine changes to dengue transmission. However, it
would seem that higher carbon emissions may result

 in less dengue, whereas milder climate warming due to
slower increase in carbon emissions may actually lead
to more dengue. Our results are consistent with recent
findings that the relationship between climate and
dengue is likely to be context-dependent and that
decreases in dengue under climate change are to be
expected in some locations [24]. Furthermore, previ-
ous work [13] has shown that diurnal temperature
variation may either increase or decrease dengue
epidemic potential, depending on the extent of vari-
ation. While our work does not consider diurnal tem-
perature variation, we incorporate other complex

variables
(through
the
DENSiM
model) that also indicate the potential for dengue
transmission to decrease in a warming climate.
There are factors other than climate that influence
dengue transmission, as evidenced by past dengue
activity patterns in Australia [5]. While dengue

 transmission in Australia is currently restricted to nor-
thern Queensland, the principal vector, Ae. aegypti,
occurs further south. Dengue transmission previously
occurred over a much greater area in Australia.
Indeed, our results here indicate that the current cli-
mate is suitable for some dengue transmission in all
urban centres tested, including Brisbane where dengue
has not been transmitted since the 1950s. Previous
studies [14, 25] have described factors responsible for
the geographical contraction of dengue in Australia,
which occurred during a period of climate warming
from the mid-20th century. Possible causes of dengue
range retraction include improved water reticulation,
insecticide usage, and the decline in water storage
after steam rail transport was phased out in the
mid-20th century.
While we have found that climate warming is un-
likely to cause increases in dengue epidemic potential
in areas where transmission has historically occurred,
it remains vital that efforts to mitigate and adapt to
the effects of climate change continue. Climate is
not the only determinant of mosquito-borne disease
transmission, with increases in human population
size, travel, and virus mutation posing real threats to
future human health. Thus, strategies to mitigate the
impact of
dengue
in the
future
(e.g.
enhanced
surveillance and case management, vaccine develop-
ment, use of symbiont Wolbachia bacteria to control
vectors [26] remain vital, regardless of whether climate
warming is responsible for increasing dengue risk. It is
also probable that other climate impacts on health in-
cluding on food security, migration, and conflict, will
be far more significant than any changes in dengue in-
cidence [27].
There are some obvious limitations to our study.
One of which is the choice of simulation model used
here. While DENSiM offers highly detailed, location-
specific simulation, replicate model runs and data ex-
traction can be cumbersome. This naturally limited
our ability to test dengue receptivity for all but four
months of the year and for four locations. Future
approaches should perhaps consider simpler ways to
estimate mosquito abundance that permit modelling
epidemic potential on broader spatial and temporal
scales.
Our modelling suggests that a simplistic extrapola-
tion based on current climate and transmission pat-
terns may neglect factors important in transmission
dynamics, such as vector bionomics, and hence lead
to
wrong
conclusions
and
the
misallocation
of
resources. For instance, a prediction of disease in-
crease in a highly populous region may result in

 significant resource allocation for the formulation of
action plans, investment in surveillance and vector
control. If predictions are inaccurate, this may result
in unnecessary funding and may shake faith in other
disease model predictions.
It is important to maintain capacity to respond to
dengue outbreaks in Australia. Moreover, as dengue
can be transmitted through blood transfusion [28],
leading to restrictions on blood donations during
local outbreaks in Australia [29] changes to dengue
transmission in the future may impact on blood collec-
tions in these cities and therefore impact on the loca-
tion of future donation collection facilities.
Our study represents a methodological advance in
that current climate–dengue relations are not assumed
to hold under future climate and also via the incorpor-
ation of sophisticated biologically based understanding
of vector biology. We acknowledge that unanticipated
changes in demography, travel patterns, global dengue
epidemiology, and vector and virus biology may signifi-
cantly impact predictions for dengue. But the modelling
results we have presented suggest caution is appropriate
when extrapolating future dengue incidence under
climate change based on current climate–dengue
relations.
