BACKGROUND: A short interpregnancy interval (IPI) following a delivery is believed to be associated with adverse outcomes in the
next pregnancy. The optimum IPI following miscarriage is controversial. Based on a single large-scale study in Latin and South America, the
World Health Organization recommends delaying pregnancy for 6 months after a miscarriage to achieve optimal outcomes in the next
pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our aim was to determine if a short IPI (<6 months) following miscarriage is associated with adverse
outcomes in the next pregnancy.
SEARCH METHODS: Studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, Embase and Pubmed, with no time and language restrictions. The search
strategy used a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms for miscarriage, IPI and adverse outcomes. Bibliographies of the retrieved
articles were also searched by hand. All studies including women with at least one miscarriage, comparing subsequent adverse pregnancy
outcomes for IPIs of less than and more than 6 months were included. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for

 inclusion. Characteristics of the studies were extracted and quality assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. A systematic
review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare short (<6 months) versus long (>6 months) IPI following miscarriage in terms of
risk of further miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, pre-eclampsia and low birthweight babies in the subsequent pregnancy. Review
Manager 5.3 was used for conducting meta-analyses.
OUTCOMES: Sixteen studies including 1 043 840 women were included in the systematic review and data from 10 of these were
included in one or more meta-analyses (977 972 women). With an IPI of less than 6 months, the overall risk of further miscarriage (Risk
ratio (RR) 0.82 95% CI 0.78, 0.86) and preterm delivery (RR 0.79 95% CI 0.75, 0.83) were significantly reduced. The pooled risks of still-
birth (RR 0.88 95% CI 0.76, 1.02); low birthweight (RR 1.05 95% CI 0.48, 2.29) and pre-eclampsia (RR 0.95 95% CI 0.88, 1.02) were not
affected by IPI. Similar findings were obtained in subgroup analyses when IPI of <6 months was compared with IPI of 6–12 months and
>12 months.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis providing clear evidence that an IPI of less than
6 months following miscarriage is not associated with adverse outcomes in the next pregnancy. This information may be used to revise
current guidance.

Introduction
Miscarriage is a relatively common occurrence, affecting 10–15% of all
pregnancies in the UK (Bhattacharya et al., 2008). It is defined as any
pregnancy loss that occurs in the first 24 weeks (Bhattacharya et al.,
2008), although the gestational week cut off varies according to avail-
ability of neonatal care. Loss of a pregnancy through miscarriage is
associated not only with psychological distress but may also affect the
outcomes of the subsequent pregnancy resulting in further miscar-
riage, pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery (Bhattacharya et al., 2008).
Birth spacing after an initial miscarriage may help mitigate some of
these risks. The time between the end of a pregnancy and the start of
another one is defined as the interpregnancy interval (IPI) (Bentolila
et al., 2013). The optimum IPI after a live birth has been reported to
be 18–23 months, for better maternal and perinatal outcomes in the
next pregnancy (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2006). In their meta-analysis of
observational studies, Conde Agudelo et al. (2006) found J shaped
associations between IPI following a live birth and adverse outcomes
in the subsequent pregnancy. Intervals shorter than 20 months and
longer than 60 months conferred the highest risk of preterm birth,
low birthweight, and small for gestational age; while intervals shorter
than 6 months and longer than 50 months were associated with the
highest risk of perinatal deaths. The optimum IPI after a miscarriage is,
however, controversial. Some clinicians advise couples not to delay
conceiving the next pregnancy, as an increasing IPI after a miscarriage
does not appear to improve birth outcomes (Basso et al., 1998;
Goldstein et al., 2002; Love et al., 2010). Others suggest delaying
pregnancy for at least 18 months based on the optimum IPI after a
live birth (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2006). The World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) guidelines recommend waiting for at least 6 months
before trying to conceive again after a miscarriage (WHO, 2005).
These guidelines were based on a single multicentre study in Latin and
South America, which found that an IPI of less than 6 months follow-
ing miscarriage was associated with adverse outcomes in the next
pregnancy (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2004). This study however, was
unable to distinguish between miscarriage and induced abortion and
this may have affected their findings. As increased maternal age is
independently associated with increased risk of miscarriage (Aref-Adib
et al., 2008), delaying conception after a miscarriage may further
increase this risk. We therefore performed a systematic review with
meta-analyses looking at the relationship between a short IPI (less
than 6 months) compared to 6 months or more following a miscar-
riage and adverse outcomes in the next pregnancy.
Methods
Ethical approval
As this study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of aggregated
published data, formal ethical approval was not required.
Review protocol
At first a specific protocol was designed where the review question was
formulated using the Population, Exposure, Comparison and Outcome
(PECO) format. The population (P) of interest was women with at least
one pregnancy following a miscarriage, exposure (E) was IPI of less than
6 months compared (C) to IPI of 6 months or more. The pre-specified
outcomes (O) of interest were further miscarriage, preterm birth, still-
birth, pre-eclampsia and low birthweight in the pregnancy following mis-
carriage. All types of study design were assessed for eligibility. The
criteria used to identify, include and exclude studies and the methods for
analysing data were all derived from this format and agreed a priori in the
review protocol. The review was conducted and reported according
to the guidelines of the Meta-analysis of Observational studies in
Epidemiology group (MOOSE checklist). The protocol was registered
with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42016038424).
Literature search
A search strategy was initially developed in Ovid Medline then modified
and run in other databases – PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine),
Embase (Elsevier) and Scopus. The search strategy used a combination
of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for miscarriage, IPI and adv-
erse outcomes. The terms for miscarriage were: miscarriages, abortion,
222
Kangatharan et al.

 spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss. Other terms for IPI were inter-
conception interval, time to birth, birth spacing and birth interval. Terms
for adverse outcomes were pregnancy outcomes, adverse outcomes.
A further search was conducted using specific terms for IPI: long IPI, short
IPI, more than 6 months IPI, less than 6 months IPI. A specific search was
also conducted for the names of each adverse outcome, these terms were:
further miscarriage, pregnancy loss, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth-
weight, pre-eclampsia. These search terms were combined using Boolean
operators ‘AND’ or ‘OR’ as appropriate. No time or language restrictions
were applied to the search strategy. Two reviewers (C.K. and S.L.) inde-
pendently ran the searches.
Review methods
The titles and abstracts of the articles identified by this search were inde-
pendently screened by two reviewers (C.K. and S.L.) for inclusion in the
review and the full texts of those that appeared relevant were retrieved.
Bibliographies of the retrieved articles were also searched by hand.
Where there was inadequate information in the published article, authors
were contacted to request additional data.
All the retrieved full text articles were then assessed for inclusion in
the review using the predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria.
The criteria determining whether an article was going to be included were:
(i) If the populations studied were women with at least one miscarriage.
The studies with women with no miscarriage but just live births or
induced abortions were excluded.
(ii) If the studies used IPI as exposure. Studies were excluded if they did
not include IPI or the women did not have any further pregnancies.
(iii) If they had studied IPIs for less and more than 6 months. Studies
were excluded if they did not have comparison groups or did not
report findings for IPIs of less than 6 months. Nevertheless, authors
were contacted to see if they could provide appropriate data if the
range of IPI was inconsistent with this inclusion criterion.
(iv) If the studies had the outcomes that were relevant to this review.
Outcomes were broadly categorised into primary and secondary
outcomes based on frequency and consistency of association
reported in the literature, biological plausibility and clinical import-
ance. Primary outcomes were defined as further miscarriage (less
than 24 weeks of gestation) and preterm delivery (delivery before
37 weeks of gestation). Secondary outcomes were live birth, still-
birth, pre-eclampsia, and low birthweight. Studies were included if
they had adverse outcomes in the next pregnancy and excluded if
they only reported adverse outcomes in the same pregnancy.
Studies were also excluded if they were case reports, reviews or
editorials.
Quality assessment and risk of bias
Once the potentially eligible articles were retrieved, they were assessed
for methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
(CASP) checklist for cohort studies (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
(CASP), 2016). The following were extracted from each included article:
titles, authors’ names, the type of study, characteristics of the population
studied, the setting of the study (the geographical location), the outcomes
studied, the measured exposure IPI.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate using the software
Review Manager 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014. Copenhagen, Denmark). Data were entered for
each outcome if there were at least two studies addressing that outcome.
The raw numbers for each outcome in each group of IPI (≥6 months
or <6 months) as reported in the primary studies were entered in the
software to calculate the crude risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence
interval (CI) using ≥6 months as the reference category. These were
then weighted and pooled to produce forest plots and pooled RRs with
95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.
Where I2 was more than 50% signifying moderate to large statistical het-
erogeneity, a random effects model was used.
If a study varied significantly in terms of methodology or findings from
all other included studies, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding
those studies from the meta-analysis. In subgroup analyses, we split the
comparator group of >6 months into 6–12 months and >12 months for
the primary outcomes of further miscarriage and preterm birth.
Results
Figure 1 shows the process for the search and identification of studies.
The bibliographic searches identified 151 publications and 18 others
were found from a hand search of the references. Of these, 38 publi-
cations were considered relevant and the full text reviewed for inclu-
sion. Of these, 13 cohort studies (Wyss et al., 1994; Basso et al.,
1998; Goldstein et al., 2002; Buchmayer et al., 2004; Conde-Agudelo
et al., 2004; DaVanzo et al., 2007, 2012; Cox et al., 2010; Love et al.,
2010; Morgan-Ortiz et al., 2010; Bentolila et al., 2013; El Behery et al.,
2013; Sapra et al., 2014) and three RCTs (Kaandorp et al., 2014;
Makhlouf et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2015) met the inclusion criteria.
However, six of these articles had insufficient data for inclusion in
meta-analysis; the authors of these papers were contacted but were
unable to provide additional data. Therefore, 10 (Wyss et al., 1994;
Buchmayer et al., 2004; Conde-Agudelo et al., 2004; DaVanzo et al.,
2007, 2012; Love et al., 2010; Morgan-Ortiz et al., 2010; Bentolila
et al., 2013; Makhlouf et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2015) studies were
included in the meta-analyses.
Table I shows the characteristics of the included studies (13 cohort
and 3 RCTs) along with their quality assessment scores. The authors
also carried out a secondary cohort analysis of the women in the
three RCTs to look at the effect of a short IPI after a previous loss
(Kaandorp et al., 2014; Makhlouf et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2015).
Out of the 16 studies, four were set in the USA (Goldstein et al.,
2002; Makhlouf et al., 2014; Sapra et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2015),
two in Bangladesh (DaVanzo et al., 2007, 2012), two in the
Netherlands (Cox et al., 2010; Kaandorp et al., 2014) and one each
in Scotland (Love et al., 2010), Denmark (Basso et al., 1998), Sweden
(Buchmayer et al., 2004), Egypt (El Behery et al., 2013) Israel
(Bentolila et al., 2013), Switzerland (Wyss et al., 1994), Uruguay
(Conde-Agudelo et al., 2004) and Spain (Morgan-Ortiz et al., 2010).
Most studies looked at IPI in months, while two studies looked at IPI
in terms of menstrual cycles in days (Goldstein et al., 2002; Sapra
et al., 2014). All the studies used a population of women with one
miscarriage or recurrent miscarriages.
Eight studies provided data on preterm birth (Wyss et al., 1994;
Buchmayer et al., 2004; Conde-Agudelo et al., 2004; Love et al.,
2010; Morgan-Ortiz et al., 2010; Bentolila et al., 2013; Makhlouf
et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2015), seven on further miscarriage

four on live births (DaVanzo et al., 2007, 2012; Love et al., 2010;
Wong et al., 2015), four on stillbirths (DaVanzo et al., 2007, 2012;
Love et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2015), five on pre-eclampsia (Conde-
Agudelo et al., 2004; Love et al., 2010; Bentolila et al., 2013;
Makhlouf et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2015) and four on low birthweight
(Conde-Agudelo et al., 2004; Love et al., 2010; Bentolila et al., 2013;
Makhlouf et al., 2014). The study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) did
not distinguish between spontaneous and induced abortions and a
sensitivity analysis was performed including and excluding this study.
The average quality assessment score using CASP criteria was 9.4
out of 11, therefore all the included studies were of good quality with
low risk of bias. Publication bias was investigated using a funnel plot
for the outcome further miscarriage but showed no appreciable evi-
dence of this bias (Pl Supplementary Fig. S1).
Further miscarriage
Seven of the 10 studies provided data on further miscarriage after a
previous miscarriage. The risk of having a further miscarriage with IPI
of less than 6 months was significantly reduced when compared to IPI
of more than 6 months, with a pooled RR (95% CI) of 0.82 (0.78,

 0.86) (Fig. 2A). Compared to an IPI of 6–12 months, IPI of <6 months
reduced the risk of further miscarriage (pooled RR 0.82, 95% CI
0.77, 0.88). Similarly this risk was further reduced (pooled RR 0.78,
95% CI 0.74, 0.83) when compared with IPI >12 months.
Preterm birth
Out of the 10 studies included in meta-analysis, eight reported on
preterm deliveries. We performed a meta-analysis including and
excluding the study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004). The meta-
analysis including the study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) resulted
in a pooled RR of 0.93(95% CI 0.58, 1.48) (Fig. 2B). The incidence of
preterm deliveries was significantly lower (P < 0.01) when women
with IPI of less than 6 months were compared to those with an IPI of
more than 6 months: pooled RR (95% CI) of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83)
(Fig. 2B) when the study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) was excl-
uded. There was no significant increase in the risk of preterm birth
when compared with IPI of 6 to 12 months (pooled RR 1.10, 95% CI
0.64, 1.89) or with IPI of >12 months (pooled RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57,
1.97). The study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) was included in the
latter two meta-analyses.
Live birth
Four studies presented data on live births after a miscarriage. Live
births were observed to be significantly higher when women had an
IPI of less than 6 months after a miscarriage (P < 0.01), 40% higher
compared to an IPI of 6 months or more, RR of (95% CI) 1.06 (1.01,
1.11) (Fig. 2C).
Stillbirth
The reported risk of stillbirths in women after a miscarriage was not
significantly different in the two IPI groups (P = 0.09) RR (95% CI) of
0.88 (0.76, 1.02). The risk varied from 1.56 to 0.71 across the four
studies included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 2D).
Low birthweight
Four studies presented data on low birthweight, three of the studies
defined low birthweight as less than 2500 g (Conde-Agudelo et al.,
2004; Love et al., 2010; Bentolila et al., 2013) and 1 as less than the
fifth percentile for gestational age adjusted by sex and race (Makhlouf
et al., 2014). The overall risk of having low birthweight babies after a
miscarriage was not significantly different in women with an IPI of less
than 6 months (P = 0.07), compared to women with an IPI of 6 months
or more including the study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) RR (95%
CI) of 1.05(0.48, 2.29) (Fig. 2E). When this study was excluded, the
risk of low birthweight was significantly lower with IPI of <6 months
(pooled RR 0.74 95% CI 0.68, 0.81) (Fig. 2E lower panel).
Pre-eclampsia
The rate of pre-eclampsia did not appear to differ in women with IPI
of less than 6 months after a miscarriage compared to IPI ≥6 months,
including the study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) pooled RR (95%
CI) of 0.95 (0.88, 1.02) (Fig. 2F) and excluding the study 1.00 (0.90,

pre-eclampsia.
Discussion
Birth spacing is an important element of reproductive counselling.
Couples experiencing a miscarriage need to know the optimal time
to conceive another pregnancy in order to have the best possible
outcomes. In this systematic review, we evaluated 6 different out-
comes and found that an IPI of less than 6 months following a miscar-
riage was associated with lower risks of having a further miscarriage
and preterm delivery, and increased odds of having live births. There
were no differences in the risks of stillbirth, pre-eclampsia and low
birthweight babies between an IPI of less than 6 months and of
6 months or more. Based on the published evidence from 10 studies
we can therefore conclude that delaying a pregnancy for more than
6 months after a miscarriage is unnecessary as a short IPI (less than 6
months) results in no worse pregnancy outcomes but may also be
associated with better outcomes in terms of a lower risk of further
miscarriage and preterm birth and increased chance of live birth in
the next pregnancy.
This systematic review was carried out in compliance with the cri-
teria in the MOOSE checklist. At first a focussed review question was
framed using the PECO format, from which a robust search strategy

carefully assessed for quality independently by two reviewers and data
extracted for meta-analyses. The meta-analysis in this review included
10 studies. The study by Conde-Agudelo et al. (2004) provided out-
come data on further miscarriage, preterm delivery, low birthweight
and pre-eclampsia. While this was a large retrospective study

 6 months (WHO, 2005) is based, it did not differentiate between
induced and spontaneous abortions and used data from many coun-
tries where induced abortion is illegal (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2004).
Therefore, the conclusions from this study should be interpreted in
context. The meta-analyses were repeated with and without this study
in sensitivity analyses. The exclusion of this study had large effects on
the pooled outcome estimates. In several cases, such as preterm birth,
a shorter IPI was associated with more favourable outcomes.

 Meta-analyses and systematic reviews can be limited by a number
of factors. Original data collection varied across the different studies
as some used the mother’s recall of the previous pregnancies while
others used information from databases. Thus quality of the original
data is a limiting factor. In addition, studies varied in their definition of
certain outcomes such as miscarriage. While some studies made dis-
tinctions between women with spontaneous and induced abortions,
others could not – possibly due to legal constraints and religious and
cultural stigmas associated with induced abortions. Another potential
bias is publication bias, and although the literature search was rigor-
ous we were unable to search unpublished studies, which may affect
our results. We investigated this possibility using a funnel plot which
did not demonstrate any appreciable publication bias for the out-
come of further miscarriage, but may have been present for some of
the secondary outcomes with fewer publications. Furthermore confi-
dence in the results could be limited due to the small number of
studies used in the meta-analyses. A number of factors are associated
with pregnancy outcomes, including age, ethnicity, social class, smok-
ing, alcohol, BMI and previous obstetric history. However other than
maternal age, the studies also varied in addressing potential confoun-
ders. Failure to address all the potential confounders in the primary
studies included in this review could be due to the fact that they
were not recorded in the databases, or either not measured or
poorly measured. Thus this can be recognised as a potential limitation

 in this study as it can lead to over or under estimated results.
Despite this, a consistent effect was reported by all the studies con-
ducted in a variety of countries and settings, which leads us to believe
that these associations are likely to exist.
The results of this systematic review are consistent with other stud-
ies (Basso et al., 1998; Goldstein et al., 2002; El Behery et al., 2013)
that could not be included in this meta-analysis as they did not have
appropriate data. The study by El Behery et al. (2013) shows that
women conceiving within 6 months of a miscarriage had good repro-
ductive outcomes and a reduced incidence of complications, and they
noted that live births were highest when conceiving within 6 months
(79.31%) compared to conceiving after 12 months (71.6%). However,
they did not focus on an IPI of more than 6 months, but looked only at
less than 6 months IPI and more than 12 months IPI. Hence this study
could not be included in the main meta-analysis but only in the sub-
group analysis comparing IPI of less than 6 months with that of more
than 12 months (El Behery et al., 2013). Studies by Basso et al. (1998)
and Goldstein et al. (2002) show that there are no adverse outcomes
associated with short IPIs but also that adverse outcomes increase as
IPI increases (Basso et al., 1998). However they did not use the same
IPI groups as this systematic review therefore could not contribute
towards the meta-analyses.
In their systematic review of mechanisms underpinning short and
long IPI with adverse pregnancy outcomes, Conde Agudelo et al.
(2012) found evidence to support hypotheses of maternal nutritional
depletion, folate depletion, cervical insufficiency, vertical transmission
of infections and abnormal remodelling of endometrial blood vessels
as possible explanations for the association of adverse outcomes with
short IPI. Women’s natural decline in reproductive capacity with age
was the only hypothesis proposed to explain the association between
long IPIs and adverse outcomes (Conde Agudelo et al., 2012). In
cases where the IPI starts with a miscarriage, the woman’s body may
behave differently to that after a live birth. For example, the nutri-
tional depletion or folate depletion hypothesis suggests that from the
fifth month of pregnancy until a prolonged time after delivery, the
stores of maternal nutrients, such as folate, remain low leading to fol-
ate insufficiency in women with a short IPI after a live or stillbirth.
However after a miscarriage, there is a very small burden on the fol-
ate reserve and thus miscarriage is not very likely to lead to folate
deficiency in the postpartum period. This could explain the reduced
risk of adverse outcomes in a short IPI after a miscarriage (Smits and
Essed, 2001). In support of this hypothesis, there is evidence to sug-
gest that late miscarriages (after 12 weeks of gestation) are asso-
ciated with worse outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy (Edlow
et al., 2007). In addition, most women who attempt another preg-
nancy soon after a miscarriage are likely to be motivated to take bet-
ter care of their health and consequently result in better pregnancy
outcomes (DaVanzo et al., 2007). Another plausible reason may be
that those who conceive soon after a miscarriage are naturally more
fertile and consequently have better pregnancy outcomes.
This is the first systematic evidence synthesis to assess the effect of
short versus long IPI and based on the available evidence we can con-
clude that a short IPI (less than 6 months) following miscarriage is not
associated with adverse outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. Couples
wishing to conceive after a miscarriage can be counselled that delaying
pregnancy does not necessarily improve outcomes. Further research
needs to look at an IPI of less than 3 months to determine an optimum
cut off, if there is one. Individual patient data meta-analysis can offer
opportunities to study small subgroups and/or stratify by other risk fac-
tors to determine a personalised optimum IPI after miscarriage.

 Conclusion
The results of this systematic review and meta-analyses show that an
IPI of less than 6 months is associated with no increase in the risks of
adverse outcomes in the pregnancy following miscarriage compared
to delaying pregnancy for at least 6 months. In fact, there is some evi-
dence to suggest that chances of having a live birth in the subsequent
pregnancy are increased with an IPI of less than 6 months. There is
now ample evidence to suggest that delaying a pregnancy following a
miscarriage is not beneficial and unless there are specific reasons for
delay couples should be advised to try for another pregnancy as soon
as they feel ready.
