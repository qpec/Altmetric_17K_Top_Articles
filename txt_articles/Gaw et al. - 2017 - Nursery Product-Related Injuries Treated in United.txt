abstract
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the epidemiology of injuries associated 
with nursery products among young children treated in US emergency departments.
METHODS: Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were retrospectively 
analyzed for patients aged <3 years who sustained an injury associated with a nursery 
product from 1991 through 2011.
RESULTS: An estimated 1 391 844 (95% confidence interval, 1 169 489–1 614 199) nursery 
product–related injuries among children aged <3 years were treated in US emergency 
departments during the 21-year study period, averaging 56.29 injuries per 10 000 children. 
The annual injury rate decreased significantly by 33.9% from 1991 to 2003, followed by a 
significant increase of 23.7% from 2003 to 2011. The decrease was driven by a significant 
decline in baby walker/jumper/exerciser-related injuries; the increase was driven by a 
significant increase in concussions and closed head injuries. Nursery product–related 
injuries were most commonly associated with baby carriers (19.5%), cribs/mattresses 
(18.6%), strollers/carriages (16.5%), or baby walkers/jumpers/exercisers (16.2%). The 
most common mechanism of injury was a self-precipitated fall (80.0%), and the most 
frequently injured body region was the head or neck (47.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although successful injury prevention efforts with baby walkers led to a decline 
in nursery product–related injuries from 1991 to 2003, the number and rate of these 
injuries have been increasing since 2003. Greater efforts are warranted to prevent injuries 
associated with other nursery products, especially baby carriers, cribs, and strollers. 
Prevention of falls and concussions/closed head injuries associated with nursery products 
also deserves special attention.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Previous 
studies have described the epidemiology of injuries 
associated with specific nursery products, such as 
cribs and baby walkers. No study has attempted to 
examine and compare classes of nursery products 
by using a nationally representative sample.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: This study is the first to 
use nationally representative data to investigate the 
epidemiology of injuries associated with a broad 
range of nursery products among young children. 
The rise in these injuries since 2003 warrants 
increased injury prevention efforts.

Nearly every household in the United 
States with a newborn or young child 
uses nursery products, which include 
infant furniture, barriers, walkers, 
devices, and equipment used for 
transporting, bathing, or caring for 
a child. These products are intended 
to help parents raise their children. 
However, nursery products can pose 
a threat to the well-being of young 
children, especially if the products do 
not meet current safety standards. 
From 2009 to 2012, nursery 
products were the leading category 
of children’s products recalled in the 
United State, 
1 
– 
4 and they account 
for millions of dangerous products 
found in US households.5, 
 
6 Nursery 
products are known to be a source 
of child injuries7 and deaths.8, 
 
9 In 
2014, there were 69 300 emergency 
department (ED) visits by children <5 
 
years old attributable to nursery 
products.10
Few studies have evaluated injuries 
associated with multiple classes of 
nursery products among infants and 
children, including 1 small study in a 
non-US population.11 Most previous 
epidemiologic studies focus on 
injuries associated with 1 or several 
products in a single product class, 
such as strollers, 
12 
– 
14 cribs, 
15 baby 
walkers, 
16 
–20 and baby bottles, 
21 
using both regional and national data.
Nursery product safety is a critical 
yet challenging issue in injury 
prevention, complicated by the 
rapid anatomic, motor, and cognitive 
development of young children as 
well as injury profiles unique to 
specific products based on their 
design and use.15, 
 
22 Identification of 
injury characteristics and patterns 
associated with nursery products is 
therefore essential in pinpointing 
areas of greatest concern for 
caregivers, health care providers, 
manufacturers, and policy makers. 
The objective of the present study 
was to determine the epidemiology of 
injuries associated with a wide array 
of nursery products among young 
children treated in US EDs. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first to 
comprehensively investigate nursery 
product–related injuries by using a 
nationally representative sample.
MeThODs
Data source
The National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System (NEISS), 
23 which 
is operated by the US Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), 
monitors consumer product–related 
and sports and recreational activity–
related injuries treated in US EDs.24 
Approximately 100 hospitals, 
including 8 children’s hospitals, 
contribute to the NEISS, which 
represents a stratified probability 
sample of >5300 hospitals with a 
24-hour ED with at least 6 beds in the 
United States and its territories.25, 
 
26 
Professional NEISS coders abstract 
information from ED medical records, 
including patient demographic 
characteristics, the consumer product 
involved, injury diagnosis, affected 
body region, disposition from the ED, 
and a brief narrative regarding the 
circumstances of the incident.27
Nursery product–related injuries 
among children aged <3 years 
reported through the NEISS 
from 1991 through 2011 were 
retrospectively analyzed. Nursery 
product–related injuries were 
identified by using 39 discrete 
NEISS consumer product codes 
(Supplemental Information), 
24 
which were based on the product 
codes included in the CPSC annual 
report on nursery product–related 
injuries and deaths.10 Each case 
narrative was then examined, and 
cases were excluded if the injury 
did not involve a nursery product 
or involved a motor vehicle crash, 
diaper rash, animal bite, dermatitis, 
or conjunctivitis. The final data set 
contained 48 653 actual cases.
study Variables
NEISS case narratives were 
individually reviewed to identify 
the mechanism of injury, which 
was classified as follows: (1) fell 
spontaneously or due to actions of 
the patient; (2) fell due to actions 
of another person; (3) collision 
with or while using the product; (4) 
breathing related; (5) entrapment; 
(6) product failure, which includes 
product collapse or malfunction; (7) 
ingestion; (8) nonfatal submersion; 
and (9) other. In instances in which 
mechanisms of injury overlapped, the 
initial event in a sequence of events 
was considered the mechanism of 
injury. NEISS consumer product 
codes were regrouped into 12 major 
categories of nursery products, 
similar to categories used by the 
CPSC (Supplemental Information).10
The NEISS variable for age was 
regrouped into 0 to 5 months, 6 to 
11 months, 12 to 17 months, 18 to 
23 months, and 24 to 35 months. 
Injury diagnosis was categorized as 
follows: (1) ingestion; (2) aspiration; 
(3) burn; (4) laceration (including 
the NEISS categories of amputation, 
laceration, puncture, and nondental 
avulsion); (5) concussion/closed 
head injury (CHI), including internal 
organ injury to the head; (6) soft 
tissue injury, including crushing, 
contusion/abrasion, hematoma, 
and strain/sprain; (7) anoxia/
submersion; (8) fracture; (9) dental 
injury; or (10) other, including 
dislocation, foreign body, nerve 
damage, hemorrhage, electric shock, 
poisoning, internal organ injury to 
non-head body regions, and other. 
Body region was grouped into: (1) 
upper extremity, including shoulder, 
elbow, upper arm, lower arm, 
wrist, hand, and finger; (2) lower 
extremity, including knee, upper 
leg, lower leg, ankle, foot, and toe; 
(3) trunk, including upper trunk, 
lower trunk, and pubic region; 
(4) head/neck; (5) face, including 
face, eye, mouth, and ear; and (6) 
other, including injury to >25% 
of the body. Disposition from the 
ED was categorized as: (1) treated 
and released; (2) hospitalized,

including NEISS categories of 
treated and transferred, treated and 
admitted, and held for <24 hours for 
observation; (3) left against medical 
advice; and (4) fatality. Location 
of injury was grouped into home 
(including home, apartment/condo, 
and manufactured/mobile home) and 
other. Additional variables analyzed 
included sex and year.
statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by using SPSS 
version 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 
IBM Corporation) and SAS 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) statistical 
software. National injury estimates 
were calculated by using sample 
weights provided by the CPSC.25, 
 
26, 
 
28  
All data reported in the present 
article are stable national estimates 
unless otherwise noted. An estimate is 
 
considered unstable if the estimate 
is <1200 cases, the sample size 
is <20 cases, or the coefficient of 
variation is >30%. US Census Bureau 
July 1 intercensal and postcensal 
population estimates from 1991 
to 2011 were used to calculate 
injury rates.29– 
31 Piecewise linear 
regression models were used to 
analyze the trends. Trends involving 
all nursery products (Fig 1) or baby 
walkers/jumpers/exercisers (Fig 2)  
were analyzed by using 2003 as a 
breakpoint, whereas concussion/CHI 
(Fig 3) trends were analyzed by using 
2005 as a breakpoint. The estimated 
annual rate of change from the 
regression model, denoted by  
“m, 
” was reported along with the  
P value associated with the t test used 
to test for its statistical significance. 
Other analyses included the Rao-
Scott χ2 test for association, and 
calculation of relative risk (RR) with 
a 95% confidence interval (CI). The 
level of significance for all statistical 
tests was α = 0.05. This study was 
approved by the institutional review 
board of The Research Institute at 
Nationwide Children’s Hospital.

Demographic characteristics
During the 21-year study period, 
an estimated 1 391 844 (95% CI, 
1 169 489–1 614 199) children 
age <3 years were treated in US 
EDs for nursery product–related 
injuries, averaging 66 278 (95% CI, 
55 690–76 867) injuries annually

or 56.29 (95% CI, 47.30–65.29) 
injuries per 10 000 children. More 
than one-half (58.7%) of all injuries 
occurred during the first year of 
life, with infants 6 to 11 months old 
(35.5%) accounting for the highest 
proportion of injuries (Table 1). 
The median age of patients was 9.3 
months (interquartile range, 5.3–15.3 
months). More boys (54.9%) were 
injured than girls, and a majority of 
injuries occurred at home (87.9%).
Injury Trends
There was a significant decline in 
both the annual number of nursery 
product–related injuries (–33.0%; 
m = –2323; P < .001) and the injury 
rate per 10 000 children <3 years 
old (–33.9%; m = –2.00; P < .001) 
from 1991 through 2003, after which 
both the number and rate increased 
significantly through 2011 by 23.5% 
(m = 2147; P < .001) and 23.7%  
(m = 1.52; P < .001), respectively  
(Fig 1). The main contributing factor 
to the decline was the decrease in 
the number of baby walker/jumper/
exerciser-related injuries, which 
decreased significantly by 86.0% 
(m = –2051; P < .001) from 1991 to 
2003, before leveling off (–8.9%;  
m = 114; P = .299) from 2003 through 
2011 (Figs 1 and 2). Although 
several nursery product categories 
contributed to the overall increase 
observed after 2003 (Fig 2), there 
was no specific product category 
responsible for the trend. An increase 
in a diagnosis category (concussion/
CHI), rather than a product category, 
was the main contributor to the 
observed increase in injuries during 
the latter part of the study period. 
The annual number (–12.9%;  
m = –113; P = .157) and rate (–14.2%; 
m = –0.12; P = .070) of nursery 
product–related concussions/CHIs 
did not decrease significantly from 
1991 to 2005, and both the number 
(114.0%; m = 2667; P < .001) and 
rate (114.8%; m = 2.17; P < .001) 
increased significantly by >100% 
from 2005 through 2011 (Fig 3).
Injury Mechanism and nursery 
Product Involved
A self-precipitated fall was the 
most common mechanism of injury 
(80.0%) (Table 2). Patients <6 
months old were more likely to suffer 
injuries from a breathing-related 
mechanism (RR, 4.41 [95% CI, 
3.48–5.60]), caregiver-related falls 
(RR, 5.98 [95% CI, 5.16–6.92), and 
product failure (RR, 3.02 [95% CI, 
2.33–3.91]) than older patients. One- 
and two-year-old patients were more 
likely (RR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.16–2.94]) 
to be injured from being entrapped in 
a product than patients <1 year old.
Nursery product–related injuries 
were most commonly associated 
with baby carriers (19.5%), cribs/
mattresses (18.6%), strollers/
carriages (16.5%), and baby walkers/
jumpers/exercisers (16.2%) (Table 2). 
 
These groups of nursery products 
also accounted for 86.1% of the 
injuries caused by self-precipitated 
falls. Baby carriers accounted for 
54.0% of injuries among children <6  
months old, and baby walkers/
jumpers/exercisers accounted for 
36.4% of injuries among children 
aged 6 to 11 months. Baby carriers 
were 5.52 times (95% CI, 4.61–6.60; 
7.9% vs 1.4%) more likely to be 
related to a caregiver fall compared 
with other product groups, and they 
accounted for more than one-half 
(57.3%) of caregiver-related falls. 
Strollers/carriages (RR, 1.68 [95% 
CI, 1.35–2.08]; 3.6% vs 2.1%) and 
cribs/mattresses (RR, 3.18 [95% 
CI, 2.68–3.77]; 5.3% vs 1.7%) were 
associated with a greater risk of 
entrapment compared with other

product categories. Product failure 
accounted for 0.9% of injuries, and 
almost one-half were associated with 
baby carriers (29.9%) or strollers/
carriages (19.3%).
body Region and Diagnosis
The head/neck was the most 
common body region injured 
(47.1%), followed by the face 
(34.0%) (Table 1). The proportion 
of head/neck injuries decreased 
with increasing age, whereas the 
proportion of upper and lower 
extremity injuries increased with 
increasing age. Patients <1 year old 
were more likely (RR, 1.63 [95% CI, 
1.57–1.70]) to sustain an injury to the 
head/neck, and patients aged  
≥1 year were more likely (RR, 3.33 
[95% CI, 3.00–3.71]) to sustain 
an injury to the upper extremity 
compared with the other age group. 
The body region injured was not only 
associated with patient age but also 
with nursery product category and 
injury mechanism. Baby carriers, 
changing tables, portable baby 
swings, and baby bouncer seats 
combined were more likely (RR, 
1.47 [95% CI, 1.41–1.54]; 61.6% 
vs 41.8%) to be associated with 
injuries to the head/neck compared 
with the other product groups. 
Strollers/carriages (RR, 1.34 [95% 
CI, 1.27–1.41]; 43.0% vs 32.1%) and 
baby bottles/warmers/sterilizers 
(RR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.78–2.07]; 
63.2% vs 32.9%) were more likely 
to be associated with facial injuries 
compared with other product groups. 
Entrapment was 6.70 (95% CI, 6.15–
7.31; 56.6% vs 8.5%) times more 
likely to cause an upper extremity 
injury than other injury mechanisms.
Soft tissue injury (38.0%) and 
concussion/CHI (26.3%) were the 
most common diagnoses (Table 1). 
The proportion of injuries accounted 
for by concussion/CHI increased 
during the study period from 
18.6% in 1991 to 41.9% in 2011. 
The proportion of concussions/
CHIs decreased with increasing age, 
and the proportion of lacerations 
increased with increasing age. 
Patients ≥18 months old (RR, 2.17 
[95% CI, 1.92–2.46]) were more 
likely to be diagnosed with a fracture, 
whereas patients <18 months old 
(RR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.62–1.87]) were 
more likely to be diagnosed with 
a concussion/CHI compared with 
the other age group. The face was 
7.00 (95% CI, 6.25–7.85; 38.2% vs 
5.4%) times more likely to sustain 
a laceration; the upper and lower 
extremities (RR, 13.75 [95% CI, 
11.91–15.87]; 34.0% vs 2.5%) 
combined were more likely to sustain 
a fracture compared with other body 
regions.
Disposition From eDs and Fatalities
Most (95.1%) children presenting 
to an ED with a nursery product–
related injury were treated and 
released (Table 1). Of the patients 
admitted to the hospital (4.0%), 
73.7% were <1 year old. Patients 
<6 months old were 2.11 times 
(95% CI, 1.81–2.46) more likely to 
be hospitalized than patients ≥6 
months old. Baby carriers (25.8%), 
cribs/mattresses (19.5%), and baby 
walkers/jumpers/exercisers (18.7%) 
were most commonly associated with 
injuries requiring hospital admission. 
The breathing-related and nonfatal 
submersion mechanisms of injury 
combined were 6.56 (95% CI, 5.03–
8.55; 24.9% vs 3.8%) times more 
likely to lead to hospitalization than 
the other mechanisms.
Of the 0.2% of injuries that resulted 
in death, 80.2% were among 
patients <1 year old, 86.9% were 
associated with the breathing-
related mechanism, and 73.4% were 
associated with cribs/mattresses. 
Baby carriers were associated with 
an additional 10.1% of deaths.
DIscussIOn
On average, >66 000 nursery 
product–related injuries were treated 
in the US EDs annually from 1991 
through 2011. Despite the significant 
decline in both the number and rate 
of nursery product–related injuries 
from 1991through 2003, primarily 
attributable to the decline in baby 
walker/jumper/exerciser-related 
injuries, both the number and rate 
of injuries increased significantly 
from 2003 through 2011. Part of this 
increase was driven by an increase in 
the number and rate of concussions/
CHIs, which is likely attributable 
to multiple factors, including 
heightened awareness about 
concussions during recent years 
among parents, child caregivers, 
and health professionals. These 
findings agree with a recent study, 
which reported a >200% increase 
in traumatic brain injuries among 
children aged <5 years occurring 
in the home from 1991 to 2012.32 
Further research is needed to better 
define the factors contributing to the 
observed increase in concussions/
CHIs.
From 2009 to 2012, nursery products 
were the leading children’s product 
category recalled in the United 
States, 
1 
– 
4 and it is estimated that 
up to 80% of recalled children’s 
products remain in consumer 
households after a recall.6 Since 
enactment of the Consumer Product 
Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 
which (among other requirements) 
mandated safety standards for all 
durable infant or toddler products, 
33  
product recalls have begun to 
decline.6 However, components of the 
law are continuing to be phased-in, 
and its effects on nursery product–
related injuries is unlikely to be 
reflected in the results of the present 
study. Future research is warranted 
to assess the effects of this important 
consumer product legislation on 
nursery product–related injuries to 
children.
Given the success of interventions 
to prevent injuries associated 
with baby walkers, including 
strengthened safety standards and 
new safer product design,

efforts should be used to address 
injuries associated with other 
nursery products, especially the top 
contributors to pediatric morbidity 
in this study: baby carriers, cribs/
mattresses, and strollers/carriages. 
Baby carriers were the leading 
source of nursery product–related 
injuries and hospital admissions. 
Baby carrier–related falls involving 
caregivers may lead to more severe 
injuries due to factors such as 
the caregiver falling on top of the 
child or propelling the child with 
additional momentum during a fall.34 
To reduce the likelihood of these 
injuries, caregivers should attempt 
to keep living spaces free of objects 
that pose a tripping hazard. Child 
caregivers using a carrier should 
minimize the use of stairs and 
refrain from carrying other objects 
while on the stairs, using the free 
hand to grasp the handrail.35 Infants 
should be matched to carriers that 
are appropriate for their size and 
weight.36
Nearly one-third of product failures 
were associated with baby carriers, 
which included instances of handle 
detachment and product collapse. 
Baby carrier seats, especially 
detachable car seats, should be 
carefully inspected before infant 
transport. Any supporting devices 
and carrier handles should be  
locked into position before moving 
an infant or child.37 Carrier seats also 
pose an additional hazard of injuries 
due to unattended falls, which  
are associated with placement  
of seats on elevated surfaces.34, 
 
38  
Infants in carrier seats should 
always be secured using the safety 
harness straps provided, and carriers 
should be equipped with nonskid 
undersides. Caregivers should 
not place carrier seats on slippery 
surfaces, such as glass tables, or on 
soft surfaces, such as beds, where a 
tip over could lead to suffocation.37
Cribs/mattresses were the second 
most common source of injury and 
were associated with the majority of 
nursery product–related fatalities. 
Previous literature provides evidence 
that cribs are a leading nursery 
product associated with infant 
mortality.15, 
 
22, 
 
39 It is likely that 
sudden unexpected infant death 
accounted for many of these fatalities 
in our study as well as in others. 
Sleep environment hazards play a 
key role in infant injury, especially 
sudden unexpected infant death, 
and health care practitioners should 
counsel caregivers to not place 
bumper pads or soft objects, such 
as blankets or pillows, in the crib 
because of the risk of strangulation, 
entrapment, and suffocation.36, 
37  
Caregivers should only use the firm, 
snugly fitting mattress designed 
for their crib and never use 
supplemental mattresses, which may 
increase the risk of entrapment and 
suffocation.
Crib bumper pads have been 
marketed as protective barriers to 
reduce entrapment injuries, and 
some organizations, such as the 
Juvenile Products Manufacturers 
Association, maintain that bumper 
pads are safe.40 However, multiple 
fatalities attributable to bumper pad–
related suffocation or strangulation 
have been reported.41, 
 
42 Since 2011, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
has recommended against bumper 
pad use due to the risk of injury.43, 
44  
The city of Chicago45 and the state 
of Maryland46 have taken these 
recommendations further, banning 
the sale of bumper pads. Despite 
these public policy efforts, bumper 
pads can still be found in Chicago, 
47  
and more needs to be done at the 
national level to limit the sale and use 
of crib bumper pads.
Strollers/carriages were the 
third-leading source of nursery 
product–related injuries. Tip overs 
and falls involving strollers have 
been described as the predominant 
mechanism of injury in the  
literature, 
12, 
 
48, 
 
49 underscoring the 
need for caregivers to avoid taking 
strollers on stairs, hanging objects 
on stroller handles, and allowing 
other children to play with or 
hang onto a stroller while a child 
is inside.36 These measures should 
be combined with safety belt use, 
which previous studies suggest is low 
among injured children.49 In a report 
describing stroller-related injuries in 
Queensland, Australia, researchers 
noted that 8% of fall injuries were 
due to the stroller rolling away 
from the caregiver.48 The injury risk 
from stroller-roll-away could be 
mitigated through the installation of 
a “dead man brake, 
” similar to those 
on airport trolleys. Manufacturers 
should be encouraged to place these 
conditional braking systems on child 
strollers and carriages.
Almost 90% of injuries occurred at 
home, and 80% of injuries were due 
to a fall. Therefore, prevention efforts 
should focus on fall prevention in 
the home setting. Strategies for 
preventing falls include the following: 
(1) use of products’ safety devices, 
such as a strap or harness; (2) 
appropriate adult supervision; and 
(3) proper assembly/installation and 
use of products, such as adjusting the 
mattress height in a crib to prevent 
a child from climbing out. We also 
found that young children were more 
likely to injure their head and neck or 
be diagnosed with a concussion/CHI, 
whereas older children were more 
likely to injure an upper extremity or 
be diagnosed with a laceration. This 
finding is most like due to children’s 
developmental changes and how 
this development specifically affects 
how they fall. Young children have 
disproportionately large heads, 
which provides a larger target for 
injury and also raises their center 
of gravity. These children tend to 
lead with their head when they fall 
and are unable to break their fall 
with their arms because of lack of 
coordination and strength. As they 
get older, they use their arms more 
effectively to protect their heads but 
have more upper extremity injuries 
as a result.32

Several limitations exist in this study. 
The number of nursery product–
related injuries was underestimated 
because only cases treated in EDs 
were included. Injuries treated 
in urgent care centers and other 
non-ED medical facilities are not 
captured by the NEISS. Fatalities 
are also underreported in the 
NEISS because prehospital deaths 
may not be transported to an ED, 
and fatal patient outcomes after 
hospital admission are not captured 
in the NEISS database. The findings 
of this study, therefore, may not 
be representative of all nursery 
product–related injuries. In addition, 
NEISS case narratives are limited by 
the amount of detail included in ED 
medical records. Narratives may not 
consistently provide information 
about injury mechanism, factors 
contributing to the injury event, 
and which product was primarily 
involved in the injury if multiple 
products were listed. Information 
regarding socioeconomic status was 
unavailable. It is possible that some 
of these injuries were the result 
of child maltreatment. Because 
multivariate analyses were not 
performed, our results do not reflect 
the potential influence of covariates 
on the relationships examined. 
Despite these limitations, the 
strength of this study lies in its use 
of a large, nationally representative 
sample over a period of 21 years 
that includes product-specific 
information.
cOnclusIOns
To our knowledge, this study 
is the first to use a nationally 
representative database to examine 
pediatric injuries associated with 
a wide array of nursery products. 
Although nursery product–related 
injuries declined from 1991 to 
2003, primarily due to successful 
injury prevention efforts with baby 
walkers, these injuries increased 
during the final 8 years of the study 
(2003–2011). Greater efforts are 
warranted to prevent injuries 
associated with other nursery 
products, especially baby carriers, 
cribs, and strollers. Prevention of falls 
and concussions/CHIs associated 
with nursery products also deserves 
special attention. Future studies that 
further examine the circumstances of 
nursery product–related injuries and 
evaluate current safety interventions 
are needed to help inform the 
development of effective prevention 
strategies.
