Abstract
Background—With improving short-term mortality in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 
(ARDS), understanding and improving quality of life (QOL) outcomes in ARDS survivors is a 
clinical and research priority. We sought to identify variables associated with QOL, as measured 
by the EQ-5D health utility score, after ARDS using contemporary data science methods.
Methods—Analysis of prospectively acquired baseline variables and 6-month EQ-5D health 
utility scores for adults with ARDS enrolled in the ARDS Network Long-Term Outcome Study 
(ALTOS). Penalized regression identified predictors of health utility, with results validated using 
10-fold cross-validation.
Results—Among 616 ARDS survivors, several predictors were associated with 6-month EQ-5D 
utility scores, including two lifestyle factors. Specifically, older age, female sex, Hispanic/Latino

 ethnicity, current smoking, and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with lower EQ-5D 
utilities, while living at home without assistance at baseline and AIDS were associated with higher 
EQ-5D utilities in ARDS survivors. No acute illness variables were associated with EQ-5D utility.
Conclusions—Acute illness variables do not appear to be associated with post-discharge QOL 
among ARDS survivors. Functional independence and lifestyle factors, such as obesity and 
tobacco smoking, were associated with worse QOL. Future analyses of post-discharge health 
utility among ARDS survivors should incorporate measures of demographics and functional 
independence at baseline.

INTRODUCTION
Recent advances have substantially reduced short-term mortality after Acute Respiratory 
Distress Syndrome (ARDS),1 leading to a greater focus on understanding and improving 
survivors’ long-term physical, cognitive and mental health morbidities, and associated 
impairments in health-related quality of life (QOL).2
Multiple factors could potentially affect the recovery of ARDS survivors, including patient 
demographics, comorbidities, health habits, severity of the acute illness, and intensive care 
unit (ICU) treatments. Understanding the association of such factors with patient outcomes 
is necessary to develop tailored interventions to improve ARDS patients’ outcomes.3 Health 
utility scores represent an important summary measure of QOL; utility scores rate a given 
health state as a percentage of perfect health, where a score of 1 is perfect health and a score 
of 0 is considered equivalent to death, with exact scores for various possible health states in 
between assessed on the basis of large surveys of community-dwelling individuals.
Existing studies evaluating post-discharge QOL in ICU survivors have often included small 
sample sizes, used a single-center design, evaluated only a relatively small number of 
possible predictors, and failed to utilize modern data science methods for evaluating 
associations.4–6 We therefore sought to evaluate a large, extensive dataset of potential 
predictors of health utility, measured at 6 months after ARDS analyzed with modern data 
science methods, using data from several multi-center, national ARDS Network clinical 
trials and the associated ARDS Network Long-Term Outcomes Study (ALTOS).
METHODS
Study Design
We performed secondary analyses of data from ALTOS,7 which prospectively collected 
QOL outcomes for ARDS survivors from three ARDS Network multicenter, national 
randomized trials: Albuterol for the Treatment of ALI (ALTA; nebulized albuterol vs. 
placebo), Early vs. Delayed Enteral Nutrition (EDEN; early vs. delayed feeding), and 
“OMEGA” (nutritional supplements vs. placebo). These three studies had similar enrollment 
criteria (see Online Data Supplement), including an identical prospective case-finding

 definition of ARDS. Relevant to our analysis, clinical trial eligibility criteria excluded 
patients with extreme obesity (body mass > 1kg/cm), end-stage liver disease, and end-stage 
AIDS on the grounds that their outcomes would be driven by factors other than ARDS. 
ALTOS enrolled ARDS survivors from 41 of 43 ARDS Network hospitals. The ARDS 
Network trials, ALTOS, and the present study were approved by the relevant Institutional 
Review Boards, with informed consent obtained for patient participation in the ARDS 
Network trials and the ALTOS follow-up study.
Primary Outcome
For this analysis, the primary outcome was the utility score from the EQ-5D-3L quality of 
life instrument8 administered 6 months after ARDS. The EQ-5D-3L is a validated, reliable, 
widely used,69 and recommended10 self-reported QOL instrument that evaluates whether 
respondents have no, mild, or serious problems in each of five domains: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses are used to calculate an 
overall utility score based on US tariffs using a time-trade-off method whereby respondents 
indicate how much decrease in life span they would hypothetically accept to return from a 
given health state to perfect health.11 The resulting health utility score ranges from −0.11 (a 
state “worse than death”; all domains with “extreme” problems) to 1.00 (perfect health; all 
domains with “no problems”). By way of illustration, a patient with “moderate” pain or 
discomfort, but “no problems” in any other domain would have a health utility of 0.83; a 
patient with ”some problems” in all domains would have a health utility of 0.60; and a 
patient with “extreme” anxiety or depression and ”some problems” in all other domains 
would have a health utility of 0.38. While a minimal important difference (MID) in EQ-5D 
is not established in ICU survivors, a difference of 0.05–0.09 is established for general 
populations.1213
Because prior work suggests that proxy responses differ from ARDS survivor responses,14 
we only used EQ-5D results obtained directly from patients in this analysis.
Clinical predictors and covariates
We evaluated 144 baseline predictor variables from the ARDS Network clinical trials and 
ALTOS (see eTables 1–2 in Online Data Supplement for complete list). These predictors 
included demographic variables, degree of independent living prior to hospital admission, 
comorbidities, alcohol15 and tobacco use history, APACHE III severity of illness score on 
the day before enrollment, Glasgow Coma Scale score on the first study day, available ICU-
related treatment factors (including receipt of corticosteroids on the first study day), and 
daily fluid balance and clinical laboratory results. The degree of independent living was 
defined on an ordinal scale with scores of (1) home independently, to (2) home with 
informal help, to (3) home with professional help or living in an institution (e.g., 
rehabilitation facility, skilled nursing facility, or acute care hospital). For arterial blood gas 
values, we used all measures obtained on the day leading up to enrollment, including lowest, 
highest, mean and range (highest minus lowest) for each of PaO2:FiO2 ratio, PaO2, pH, and 
PaCO2. Where potentially clinically relevant, the modeling of variables included use of 
quadratic terms (e.g., for body mass index [BMI], pH, and PaCO2) and statistical interaction 
terms (e.g., minute ventilation with PaCO2 and serum creatinine with receipt of dialysis).

 For our primary analysis, we used only predictor variables available on day 1 or earlier, and 
we restricted the analysis to patients who survived with a 6-month follow-up assessment 
using EQ-5D. Further details related to modeling of predictor variables are included in the 
Online Data Supplement.
As an a priori sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis was repeated to include patients who 
died before 6-month follow-up, assigning them an EQ-5D utility score of 0 as done in prior 
research.16 Further details of this sensitivity analysis are available in the Online Data 
Supplement.
For a secondary analysis intended to evaluate predictors available at the time of hospital 
discharge, we studied only patients who were alive at hospital discharge. For this secondary 
analysis, we incorporated data available after day 1, including day 7 Brussels organ 
dysfunction scores, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Repeated measures of predictors, 
such as Brussels organ dysfunction measures, vital signs and ventilator settings from the first 
three study days were summarized using a variety of approaches (e.g., mean, maximum, and 
range) as outlined in the Online Data Supplement. We also performed a sensitivity analysis 
of this secondary analysis, repeating the secondary analysis to include patients who died 
before 6-month followup, assigning them an EQ-5D utility score of 0 as done in prior 
research.16
Statistical Methods
To select the predictor variables jointly associated with 6-month EQ-5D utility scores, we 
applied group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized linear 
regression17 on all 144 candidate variables. Further details of the regression technique, 
including an analysis of the role of hospital site, are described in the Online Data 
Supplement. Because EQ-5D utilities are known to be negatively skewed, we applied the 
Box Cox transformation to EQ-5D utilities and standardized them to have mean 0 and a 
standard deviation (SD) of 1 so that interpretations could be made in SD increments. In 
order to validate the regression model results, we used 10-fold cross validation to estimate 
the root mean squared error (RMSE) and R2.18 Variables selected from penalized regression 
were collectively fit using ordinary least squares linear regression to estimate confidence 
intervals (CIs) and p values, conditional on the variables selected, as explained further in the 
Online Data Supplement. Because penalized regression may select only one of several 
highly correlated variables, we also explored patterns of collinearity. Specifically, we 
evaluated correlation between selected predictors and unselected predictors. We also added 
key severity of illness covariates (admission APACHE III score, admission Brussels organ 
failure score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and PEEP) to the primary model to see whether inclusion of 
those acute illness severity variables changed the model substantially (further details in 
Online Data Supplement).
While we acknowledge that retrospective reports of baseline EQ-5D are potentially 
unreliable,19 in an exploratory, post-hoc analysis, we evaluated an a priori subset of 195 
patients who had “baseline” EQ-5D measured retrospectively, evaluating the effect of 
inclusion of baseline EQ-5D on the primary model (further details in Online Data 
Supplement).

 We also compared the observed regression coefficients to the MID for EQ-5D. Because we 
used a Box-Cox transformation and standardized results, the translation of coefficients into 
the MID is inexact. However, from the median value of EQ-5D, a coefficient of 0.27 was 
associated with a change of EQ-5D of 0.05; we used that threshold to evaluate whether 
regression coefficients were compatible with at least minimal clinical importance.
As recommended in prior literature,20 we imputed missing values using single imputation 
for variables where missingness was ≤15% and excluded variables with missingness >15% 
(see details of imputation strategy in Online Data Supplement).
We performed all analyses in the R Statistical Package, version 3.2.1 (www.r-project.org). 
Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05.
RESULTS
As depicted in Figure 1, a total of 1176 eligible patients were enrolled in the ARDS Network 
clinical trials, with 247 (21%) dying before hospital discharge, 44 (4%) dying after hospital 
discharge but before ALTOS re-consent, 31 (3%) declining to participate, and 156 (13%) 
meeting ALTOS exclusion criteria (see Appendix 2 of Online Data Supplement). Among 
698 eligible and consenting patients, 42 (6%) died prior to 6-month follow up, with 645 
(98%) of the 656 survivors having 6-month outcome assessments, and 616 (94%) of 656 
having complete EQ-5D results available (29 patients completed partial follow-up without 
fully completing EQ-5D). For the sensitivity analysis that included deceased patients, a total 
of 949 patients were available for analysis. Table 1 displays the distribution of baseline and 
outcome characteristics among study patients.
For the pre-specified primary analysis of 6-month EQ-5D utility scores in ARDS survivors, 
9 variables remained in the final regression model (Table 2), with 7 having statistically 
significant associations (the other two variables, pulmonary comorbidity and nadir 
respiratory rate, demonstrated low coefficients and non-significant p values). Hospital site 
was not retained in the model. The selected primary model R2 in the full data set was 0.15 
and met the regression assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity.21 The cross-validated 
RMSE was 0.975, and the cross-validated R2 was 0.03.
All 7 predictors with p <0.05 were baseline attributes; none were factors associated with 
severity of acute illness or ICU treatments, including mechanical ventilation parameters 
(e.g., PaO2:FiO2 ratio or driving pressure). At the time of hospital admission for ARDS, 
residing at home but with informal caregiver help (p<0.001) or requiring professional help 
(including residence at a skilled nursing facility or similar) (p=0.03) was associated with 
lower 6-month health utility versus residing at home independently. Older age, female sex, 
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and higher baseline BMI were all associated with lower health 
utility at 6-month follow-up. Latino ethnicity varied by hospital, from 0% to 44%.
Based on standard regression coefficients, the magnitude of associations of female sex, 
Latino ethnicity, baseline independence, AIDS, and current smoking with the 6-month 
EQ-5D utility score were all greater than the estimated MID.

 The 10 survivors with AIDS at hospital admission had higher health utility (p=0.01) than 
patients without AIDS, but, notably, AIDS comorbidity (N=24) was associated with higher 
inpatient mortality (33% vs. 58%, p=0.02). Being a current smoker (vs. non-smoker) at the 
time of hospital admission was associated with lower 6-month EQ-5D utility scores 
(p<0.001) and lower mortality (27% vs. 39%, p<0.001).
In evaluating potential collinearity (details in Online Data Supplement) ever smoking was 
moderately correlated with current smoking, but current smoking performed better in the 
primary model and was therefore retained in the model. Other patterns of collinearity were 
not important. As to whether collinearity led to inappropriate exclusion of severity of illness 
predictors, when the pre-specified severity of illness predictors were incorporated into the 
primary model, they were not significant (p>0.40), and there was no material change in 
results.
Sensitivity and secondary analyses
For the sensitivity analysis in which death was assigned a utility score of 0, a model with 3 
variables available at hospital admission was selected (eTable 3). Older age, higher 
APACHE III score, and residing at home with informal support (vs. residing at home 
independently) were all associated with lower EQ-5D utility (including death as a utility of 
0) in this sensitivity analysis.
For the secondary analysis evaluating prediction based on factors available at the time of 
discharge (uncorrected R2=0.18; eTable 4), results were similar to the primary analysis, with 
the following variables significantly associated: age, residence at home with informal help, 
ethnicity, AIDS, current smoking, female sex, and BMI. Longer hospital length of stay also 
was associated with lower utility scores. In the sensitivity analysis of this secondary analysis 
in which deceased patients were included with a utility score of 0, only residing at home 
with informal support (vs. residing at home independently) was associated with EQ-5D 
utility (OR 0.19 [0.12–0.3], p <0.001).
In the post-hoc secondary analysis of the subset of 195 patients with retrospective “baseline” 
EQ-5D, the non-cross-validated adjusted R2 in the regression model with versus without 
“baseline” EQ-5D utility was 0.32 (versus 0.12). As compared to the primary model, BMI, 
current smoking, and baseline independence remained significant or nearly significant, while 
chronic pulmonary disease became significant (see eTable 9).
DISCUSSION
In this national, multi-center study of ARDS survivors, we explored a large number of 
possible predictors using modern data science techniques and identified several baseline 
predictors associated with EQ-5D utility scores at 6-month follow-up. Markers of acute 
illness severity, however, were not associated with health utility scores. These findings are 
important considerations for the prediction of QOL after ARDS. Two lifestyle factors, 
tobacco smoking and obesity appear to be important to long-term outcomes after ARDS. If 
persistence of tobacco smoking and obesity after hospitalization were associated with lower 
health utilities in future studies, they may represent candidate interventions for future studies

 evaluating methods to improve long-term QOL among survivors of ARDS. Both lifestyle 
factors remained important predictors of 6-month health utility on multiple secondary and 
sensitivity analyses.
Our results help confirm prior observations while also identifying several predictors that 
have not been previously reported. In particular, our study suggests that the degree of 
independent living at baseline may be an important and easily measured surrogate for 
baseline impairment and QOL. Other studies have suggested that comorbidities,2223 baseline 
QOL,2324 or severity of trauma2526 are associated with worse EQ-5D utility scores at 
follow-up. In our study, comorbidities other than AIDS (as assessed using the APACHE III 
comorbidity score elements) were not associated with 6-month health utilities among 
survivors.
Acute illness severity only appeared significant in the sensitivity analysis of our primary 
model in which mortality was included, demonstrating its relevance to predicting short-term 
mortality rather than QOL in survivors. In fact, in the sensitivity analysis of our secondary 
model based on patients alive at the time of discharge and incorporating patients who died 
after hospital discharge with a health utility of 0, only the degree of independent living at 
baseline remained in the model, suggesting that acute illness severity was relevant to 
predicting hospital mortality rather than post-discharge mortality. Our secondary analysis 
evaluating for collinearity among predictor variables confirmed the lack of association 
between acute illness severity variables and EQ-5D health utility. Only rarely have prior 
studies suggested that severity of acute illness is associated with subsequent QOL.2728 The 
findings in our large cohort offer no support for an association between acute illness severity 
and post-discharge QOL outcomes. Additionally, no variables associated with ICU 
treatments, such as mechanical ventilation (e.g., plateau or driving pressures, tidal volume), 
vasopressors, or corticosteroids, were associated with health utilities in our cohort.
Tobacco smoking is associated with susceptibility to, and (in some studies) higher mortality 
from, ARDS.2930 The present study extends prior observations by documenting an 
association with lower 6-month health utilities among survivors. This association is likely 
driven by pre-existing damage from tobacco smoking. However, if ongoing smoking 
worsens QOL (particularly in patients with new pulmonary dysfunction related to their 
ARDS), it is possible that targeted smoking cessation interventions among ICU patients 
could improve long-term outcomes. In another patient population—individuals admitted for 
an acute myocardial infarction—post-hospitalization decreases in smoking were associated 
with better patient outcomes at 12 months, suggesting that benefit may still accrue even 
when tobacco smoking ceases during hospitalization.31 An ICU admission may similarly 
represent a sustained period of time without access to tobacco, in which smoking cessation 
interventions may be efficacious.32 Further evaluation of the association between persistent 
smoking and outcomes among ARDS survivors is indicated to explore our hypothesis-
generating findings.
While patients with extreme obesity were excluded from ALTOS, patients with higher 
baseline BMI in our cohort had lower 6-month utility scores after ARDS. The harms 
associated with obesity at baseline may already be done by the time of ARDS admission.

 Intentional weight loss after ICU discharge is likely to be complex: on average, ARDS 
survivors lose almost 20% of body mass during their acute illness, regaining most of that 
mass by 1 year.33 In older patients, higher BMI at the time of hospital admission is 
associated with better functional outcomes after an ICU admission.34 We suspect that this is 
a phenomenon specific to low muscle mass among vulnerable elders, whereas the ALTOS 
survivor population was generally a younger population (median [IQR] of age =50 [40,58] 
years). In general, reduction in BMI has been associated with improvement in QOL, but this 
is not well studied among ICU survivors.35 Further work to clarify the relationship between 
BMI, QOL, and intentional weight loss among ARDS survivors who are obese at the time of 
hospital admission may be indicated.
Even though patients with end-stage AIDS were excluded from enrollment into our cohort, 
the 24 patients with AIDS had high mortality (58%) in our cohort, but the 10 survivors had 
relatively high health utilities. Recent studies suggest that short-term survival for patients 
with AIDS admitted to the ICU are continually improving.3637 While few, if any, studies 
have addressed long-term QOL outcomes after ARDS for patients with AIDS, our data 
suggest the possibility that post-discharge QOL for survivors may be favorable.38
Race and ethnicity bear a complex relationship to critical illness outcomes.3940 Latino 
ethnicity varied by hospital site in our study. Although hospital site, per se, was not 
important to the prediction model, it is possible that Latino ethnicity is a surrogate for 
differences in quality at the hospital level. The large number of centers relative to the 
number of outcomes makes it difficult to know whether Latino ethnicity is a marker for 
socioeconomic status or represents variations in care related to hospital site. Since 
homelessness and non-English speaking status were exclusion criteria from ALTOS, it is 
unlikely that the association of Latino ethnicity with these socioeconomic factors accounts 
for our finding. It also means that our findings may not generalize to homeless or non-
English-speaking individuals.
The competing risk of death is an important consideration in all studies of outcomes after 
ARDS or other critical illnesses.41 The degree of independent living at the time of 
hospitalization for ARDS remained a significant predictor of 6-month QOL in the sensitivity 
analysis that included deceased patients (assigning them a utility score of 0, thereby 
including them in the worst ordinal category, as has been done in prior research4243), 
suggesting that this finding may be robust. In that analysis, APACHE III score replaced 
other predictors, not surprising given the substantial observed mortality. Further research is 
needed to evaluate optimal mechanisms for analysis of non-mortality outcomes in patient 
populations with high mortality.44
As a limitation of this study, we acknowledge that baseline QOL likely strongly affects post-
admission QOL; but is a challenge to validly measure in critical care studies.5 The observed 
association between independent living before hospital admission and post-admission QOL 
supports this concept, as does our post hoc sub-group analysis of patients in whom a 
retrospective “baseline” health utility was measured. This analysis suggested that a 
substantial proportion of the variability in 6-month health utility is associated with 
Brown et al.

 variability in the “baseline” health utility. This association was also present in the secondary 
analysis that included deceased patients with an imputed QOL score of 0.
The association of tobacco smoking with 6-month health utility may also be explained, in 
part, by smokers having lower baseline QOL, although the post hoc sub-group analysis 
incorporating “baseline” QOL suggested that the effect of current tobacco smoking (p=0.06 
in that small sub-group) may be independent of baseline QOL. In studies where baseline 
QOL has been accurately measured (e.g., in elective cardiac surgery45), impairments in 
baseline QOL are clearly associated with post-discharge impairments.46 However, baseline 
QOL is difficult to measure in ARDS patients: recall bias and the use of proxy assessments 
may introduce inaccuracies in measurement of baseline QOL; the findings of our post hoc 
sub-group analysis are therefore tentative.14 Nevertheless, our findings suggest that patients’ 
independent living status before hospital admission may be a useful and feasible proxy for 
baseline status and should be considered when evaluating patient outcomes after ARDS. 
Moreover, we also acknowledge that study patients were drawn from U.S. clinical trials with 
specific eligibility criteria, and hence, our findings may not be generalizable to all patients 
with ARDS or other critically ill populations. Specifically, many patients with already end-
stage disease—excluded from the ARDS Network clinical trials—may develop ARDS. 
Should any of these individuals with end-stage disease survive the ICU admission, their 
post-discharge health utilities may differ substantially from those observed in our cohort.
We acknowledge that our prediction model exhibits a low cross-validated R2, suggesting that 
it explains only a small amount of the variance in 6-month health utility. However, our 
decision to report cross-validated R2 was conservative relative to most prior investigations in 
this field, which did not publish R2 values for their models (and none to our knowledge 
employed cross validation), making direct comparison difficult.23242728 A study of QOL 
among patients with trauma with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) had a non-cross-
validated R2 of 0.22; in that setting the association between the brain injury and quality of 
life is dominant.26 Our primary focus in this study was to build a prediction model for long-
term health utility. On the basis of the low R2, our model should not be used for specific 
prognostication. Instead it identifies candidate predictors for further focused investigation. 
Our findings also suggest that, in general, variables available during the hospitalization 
explain relatively little of the variance in 6-month health utility, an important caveat with any 
attempt to prognosticate quality of life outcomes after ARDS. Although we undertook 
multiple sensitivity analyses to help confirm robustness of our results, these results should 
be considered hypothesis generating.
In conclusion, in this novel, data-science-driven analysis of 144 candidate predictors in a 
large, multi-center prospective cohort of ARDS survivors, tobacco smoking and obesity at 
hospital admission were associated with worse 6-month EQ-5D utility score, while acute 
critical illness and its treatments were not associated with this outcome. Living 
independently without assistance at the time of hospital admission was associated with 
better 6-month EQ-5D utility, while older age, female sex, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity 
were associated with worse health utility. These observations support further investigations 
to develop tailored interventions for ARDS patients, especially those who are current 
smokers or obese at the time of admission.

 KEY QUESTIONS
What is the key question?
What variables available during hospitalization are associated with 6-month health utility 
among ARDS survivors?
What is the bottom line?
Prior degree of residential independence, and smoking and obesity are associated with 6-
month healthy utility; acute illness severity is not.
Why read on?
To understand potential predictors of health-utility outcomes among ARDS survivors.
