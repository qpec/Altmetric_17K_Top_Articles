Study Objectives: Sleep disturbances are common in United States military personnel. Despite their exposure to combat and trauma, little is known about 
nightmares in this population. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and associated clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of 
nightmares in United States military personnel with sleep disturbances.
Methods: Retrospective review of 500 active duty United States military personnel who underwent a sleep medicine evaluation and polysomnography 
at our sleep center. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Addendum were used to characterize clinically significant 
nightmares. Subjective and objective sleep attributes were compared between groups.
Results: At least weekly nightmares were present in 31.2%; yet, only 3.9% reported nightmares as a reason for evaluation. Trauma-related nightmares 
occurred in 60% of those patients with nightmares. Patients with nightmares had increased sleep onset latency (SOL) and rapid eye movement (REM) 
sleep latency (mean SOL/REM sleep latency 16.6/145 minutes, P = .02 and P = .01 respectively) compared to those without (mean SOL/REM sleep latency 
12.5/126 minutes). The comorbid disorders of depression (P ≤ .01, relative risk [RR] 3.55 [95% CI, 2.52–4.98]), anxiety (P ≤ .01, RR 2.57 [95% CI, 1.93–3.44]), 
posttraumatic stress disorder (P ≤ .01, RR 5.11 [95% CI, 3.43–7.62]), and insomnia (P ≤ .01, RR 1.59 [95% CI, 1.42–1.79]) were all associated with nightmares.
Conclusions: Clinically significant nightmares are highly prevalent in United States military personnel with sleep disturbances. Nightmares are associated 
with both subjective and objective sleep disturbances and are frequently comorbid with other sleep and mental health disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Nightmares are defined by repeated occurrences of extended, 
extremely dysphoric, and well-remembered dreams that cause 
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other areas of functioning.1 Occasional nightmares are 
part of a normal adaptive response to life stressors and are not 
pathologic, with 85% of adults reporting at least one nightmare 
per year.2 The prevalence of clinically significant nightmares, 
which occur at least once per week, is estimated between 0.9% 
and 6.8%.3–9 In the largest study to date (69,813 adults), the prev-
alence of nightmares was 3.5% in men and 4.8% in women.10 
Participants from the World War II generation had a significantly 
higher prevalence of 7.2% in men and 7% in women. Nightmares 
are more common among patients with sleep disturbances, sleep 
disorders, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder

(PTSD).2,9,11–15 Additionally, nightmares are associated with a 
heightened risk of suicidal ideation in both military and civilian 
populations.16,17 As sleep and psychiatric disorders are frequently 
reported in United States military personnel, this population 
may have a high prevalence of nightmare disorder (NDO).18 
However, most research evaluating sleep disorders in active duty 
military personnel has focused on insomnia, obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA), and PTSD, noting that a recent study focusing on 
OSA and PTSD did not evaluate nightmares.18–20
Following traumatic experiences, sleep disturbances are 
frequently reported, including trauma-related nightmares 
(TRN).21 The nightmares of trauma survivors tend to be more 
severe and distressing than idiopathic nightmares.1,3 Though 
not exclusive to PTSD, TRN have been referred to as the 
“hallmark” of this disorder, with rates as high as 90%.22,23 Ad-

BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: The spectrum of sleep disorders in military personnel is varied and complicated by the presence of 
comorbidities and psychological disorders. Currently, little is known regarding nightmares, especially trauma-related nightmares.
Study Impact: This is the first study to report on objective and subjective sleep attributes in a cohort of military personnel, determining the prevalence 
of nightmares and polysomnographic characteristics associated with nightmares. Clinically, this highlights the need for military and civilian health care 
providers to evaluate for nightmares in individuals with sleep disturbances after traumatic experiences. From a research perspective, these findings 
provide the basis to further address nightmares, which are associated with the pressing issues of sleep and behavioral medicine disorders and 
suicidality in military and veteran populations.

Nightmares in Military Personnel
traumatic experience is of clinical importance as patients with 
disturbed sleep have poor outcomes and sleep-focused therapy 
can lead to improvement in PTSD, anxiety, and depression.24,25
Research on nightmares in military personnel is limited, 
though data suggest that veterans who have left military ser-
vice have a higher prevalence than the general population.10 
The primary objective of this study was to characterize the 
prevalence of nightmares in United States military personnel 
with sleep disturbances. The secondary objective was to de-
scribe the clinical and polysomnography (PSG)-measured cor-
relates of military personnel with nightmares.
METHODS
Study Sample
This is a retrospective cohort study of 500 military person-
nel who were referred for evaluation to an academic military 
sleep disorders center between January 2016 and December 
2016. Our laboratory performs approximately 2,500 PSG tests 
on military personnel per year. Individuals who had previously 
undergone PSG, those referred for postsurgical evaluation, or 
those who did not complete our sleep center intake question-
naire were excluded from the analysis. Groups of 50 consec-
utive-performed PSG tests on active duty military personnel 
were randomly pulled from 10 different time periods through-
out the year. We evaluated the records of 106 females and 394 
males (7 were excluded due to missing data elements). This re-
sulted in a cohort of 106 females and 387 males. All patients 
underwent our standard diagnostic evaluation, which involves 
completing a self-report questionnaire consisting of the Ep-
worth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), questions from the 
PSQI-Addendum (PSQI-A), and medical and military history 
elements. Regarding deployment experiences, patients were 
asked to report whether they had deployed to Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, Enduring Freedom, or other deployments. To assess 
the use of sleep aids, patients answered a question whether they 
were taking the following medications: zolpidem, eszopiclone, 
zaleplon, trazodone, mirtazapine, or other to include over-the-
counter medications. They were then classified as either taking 
or not taking a sleep aid. All participants underwent an attended 
level 1 in-laboratory diagnostic PSG. After data collection, all 
study variables were entered into a de-identified database prior 
to statistical analysis. This study was approved by the Wilford 
Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center institutional review board.
Study Variables
Demographic/biometric parameters (age, sex, deployment his-
tory, and branch of service), sleep center intake questionnaire, 
PSG variables, and electronic medical records (EMR) for each 
patient were reviewed.
Outcome Variables
Nightmares and Trauma-Related Nightmares
Self-reported reasons for sleep medicine evaluation were noted, 
determining if nightmares were listed as a specific symptom. 
A single item from the PSQI was used to assess nightmare 
frequency: “During the past month, how often have you had 
trouble sleeping because you have bad dreams?”26 A response 
of bad dreams at least weekly is consistent with NDO.3 The 
PSQI-A was used to assess nightmares related to trauma ex-
posure and to differentiate between NDO and TRN.27 A single 
item from the PSQI-A was used to assess TRN: “During the 
past month, how often have you had trouble sleeping because 
you had memories or nightmares of a traumatic experience?” 
For the diagnosis of TRN, individuals were required to have 
at least weekly bad dreams on the PSQI and memories/night-
mares of traumatic experiences on the PSQI-A.
Sleep Characteristics
The ESS was used to assess patients’ sleepiness. The total 
ESS score ranges from 0 (less sleepy) to 24 (more sleepy). A 
score > 10 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness.28 Self-re-
ported sleep efficiency (SE) was derived from PSQI item 4 by 
dividing reported time in bed by reported sleep time.
Insomnia
The ISI was used to assess insomnia symptoms with scores 
that range from 0 to 28. A score ≥ 15 is consistent with clinical 
insomnia.29
OSA
Patients with a PSG demonstrating apneas or hypopneas with 
an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5 events/h were rendered a 
diagnosis of OSA.
Mental Health Disorders and Traumatic Brain Injury
Diagnoses of interest to include depression, anxiety, PTSD, 
and traumatic brain injury (TBI) were obtained from each pa-
tient’s EMR.
PSG Data
Level 1 PSG tests were performed in accordance with Ameri-
can Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standards within 
an AASM accredited laboratory (Sandman Version 9.3, Em-
bla Systems, Broomfield, Colorado, United States). PSG was 
performed with 16 channels, including: electrooculogram, 
electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, electromyogram 
(submental and bilateral tibial), airflow measurements us-
ing both oronasal-thermal sensors and nasal air pressure 
transducers, transtracheal sounds via microphone, rib cage 
and abdominal movement by inductance plethysmography 
using thoracoabdominal belts, and continuous pulse oxim-
etry. Studies were scored utilizing the 2012 AASM scoring 
guidelines with hypopneas scored as a 30% drop in the na-
sal pressure from baseline for at least 10 seconds and asso-
ciated with an arousal and/or drop in oxygen saturation by 
3%.30 PSG-measured variables, to include sleep onset latency 
(SOL), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency, total sleep 
time (TST), SE, sleep stages (stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, 
stage R sleep), wake after sleep onset (WASO), arousal in-
dex, AHI, and maximal desaturation were analyzed. All test 
results were reviewed and adjudicated by a board-certified 
sleep medicine physician.

Nightmares in Military Personnel
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with a statistical software 
package (JMP Pro 12; SAS Institute; Cary, North Carolina, 
United States). Data normality was assessed with the Shapiro-
Wilk test. Statistical analysis was based on parametric and 
nonparametric methods as deemed appropriate. All variables 
underwent descriptive analysis to describe our population 
in terms of demographic characteristics. Participants were 
then classified in two groups: nightmare disorder (NDO) and 
non-nightmare disorder (non-NDO), and differences between 
groups were assessed. For a secondary analysis, we classified 
patients in two groups (ie, the “NDO only” group [patients 
having NDO without memories or nightmares of a traumatic 
experience], and the group of patients in whom trauma-related 
nightmares, “TRN” [having both bad dreams and memories or 
nightmares of a traumatic experience]), were diagnosed.
An α level of .05 was used to determine statistical signifi-
cance. Pairwise comparisons between groups were based on 
one-way analysis of variance and on the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test. Fisher exact test was used for comparisons of proportions. 
Accounting for family-wise error, post hoc statistical signifi-
cance was assessed by the Benjamini-Hochberg false discov-
ery rate controlling procedure with q = 0.20.31 To assess the 
strength of the observed differences we used relative risk (RR) 
with 95% confidence interval (CI) and the nonparametric ef-
fect size r. Data are presented as mean (standard deviation) or 
percentage (number of occurrences).
RESULTS
Patient ages ranged from 18 to 66 years (37.7 ± 8.99) with 78.5% 
being male (Table 1). Participants predominantly served in the 
Army (45.6%) and Air Force (45.2%); 9.2% Navy/Marines. Ap-
proximately 74% of the military personnel evaluated had been 
deployed. The average ESS score was 12.6 ± 4.78, with 68.4% 
of patients reporting excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS > 10). 
The average ISI score was 16.5 ± 5.53, with 64.1% of patients 
having an ISI ≥ 15, consistent with insomnia.
Next, patients were classified in the NDO and non-NDO 
groups. Whereas only 3.9% of the 493 patients reported night-
mares as a reason for sleep evaluation, 31.2% had clinically 
significant nightmares. The groups did not differ in terms of 
age, sex, or deployment history (all P > .05).
As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the NDO and non-NDO 
groups did not differ in terms of ESS scores, OSA occurrence, 
and severity of OSA (all P > .40). Compared to those in the 
non-NDO group, the patients in the NDO group were more 
likely to have elevated ISI scores consistent with insomnia 
(P < .001) and the comorbid disorders of depression (P < .001), 
anxiety (P < .001), and PTSD (P < 0.001). These findings hold 
true even after we controlled for the effect of sex using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
For self-reported sleep, patients in the NDO group had 
shorter sleep duration (P < .001) and decreased SE (P < .001). 
Regarding PSG variables, patients in the NDO group were 
characterized by longer SOL and longer REM sleep latency 
compared to those in the non-NDO group (Table 3). The ob-
served PSG differences were of a small effect size.
We compared the NDO-only group to the TRN group 
(Table 4) to assess the effect of TRN. Those in the TRN group 
were 1.49 times more likely to have deployed. The patients 
with TRN had more severe insomnia symptoms and were more 
likely to have a diagnosis of OSA (RR = 1.25), TBI (RR = 5.90), 
PTSD (RR = 5.44), anxiety (RR = 2.17), and depression 
(RR = 2.05). Interestingly, the PSG variables of patients with 
TRN were characterized by increased SE, decreased WASO, 
and higher percentage of stage N3 sleep.
Regarding the effect of branch of service, the prevalence of 
NDO was higher in Army patients (38.3%) compared to Air 
Force patients (24.6%; Fisher exact test, P = .002). Specifically, 
Army patients were 1.6 times more likely to have a diagnosis of 
NDO compared to the Air Force patients (95% CI = 1.17–2.08). 
The same trend was identified for memories or nightmares 
of traumatic experiences. That is, compared to Air Force pa-
tients (17.7%), more Army patients (30.2%) reported memo-
ries or nightmares of traumatic experiences (Fisher exact test, 
P = .003; RR = 1.70, CI = 1.20–2.41).

Nightmares in Military Personnel
Last, we explored the association between reported sleep 
aid usage and the pattern of our results. Sleep aid usage was 
reported by 79 of the patients (16%). After excluding these pa-
tients, analysis showed that our findings still held true without 
substantive differences.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to assess clinically 
significant nightmares in an active duty population referred for 
the evaluation of sleep complaints. Overall, 31.2% of military 
personnel with sleep disturbances met criteria for NDO, which 
far exceeded the rate of patients presenting with a sleep-related 
concern of nightmares. This study highlights the need to evaluate 
nightmares in military personnel with sleep disturbances, par-
ticularly those with a history of traumatic experiences.
This is not the first study that supports the notion that in-
dividuals with nightmares do not seek clinical care for this 
nocturnal disorder. In a previous study, Nadorff et al. reported 
that most of the individuals with nightmares had not discussed 
this with a health care provider. In the study by Nadorff et al., 
those with nightmares did not believe their disorder was treat-
able, which may have led to this finding.32 In our study, other 
potential reasons why nightmares were not reported as a rea-
son for a sleep medicine evaluation are their link with PTSD 
and associated stigma,33 that nightmares are expected or even 
perceived as normal after trauma, or health care providers 
have not been educated about nightmares and their associated 
adverse clinical outcomes.32

Nightmares in Military Personnel
Our study did not allow us to definitively establish the cause 
of the patients’ nightmares. Yet, the finding that military per-
sonnel with TRN were significantly more likely to have de-
ployed implies that traumatic experiences from deployment 
likely contributed to this finding. The association of TRN with 
deployments is similar to findings in the study by Schreuder et 
al. that evaluated 223 war victims 40 years after their traumatic 
experience and found 56.5% had posttraumatic nightmares.34 
Similarly, a recent study by Thordardottir et al. found 38% of 
adults who survived an avalanche had TRN 16 years later.35 
Given the high rates of TRN and their noted persistence over 
time, specifically addressing this disorder in close temporal 
proximity to the traumatic experience has the potential to im-
prove not only nightmare-associated distress but overall sleep 
quality. Another reason to address nightmares is their signifi-
cant association with suicide,36 with previous studies report-
ing that nightmares are an independent risk factor for suicide,37 
and are associated with a fivefold increase in suicidality.38

Nightmares in Military Personnel
Suicide is a pressing health concern in military personnel and 
veterans39; however, we are not aware of any studies regarding 
nightmares and suicide in this population.40
Insomnia was found overwhelmingly in those with NDO 
(86%; mean ISI score = 19.5) compared to those without NDO 
(54.2%; mean ISI score = 15.2). In military personnel with 
TRN, insomnia symptoms and self-reported SE were worse 
than in those with NDO, consistent with the concept that TRN 
are a more severe disorder.41 These findings are analogous to 
those reported by Gehrman et al., who evaluated sleep dairies 
of Vietnam veterans and found PTSD severity and nightmare-
related distress correlated with longer self-reported sleep la-
tency, increased awakenings, decreased total sleep time, and 
greater frequency of nightmares.42
On PSG, the NDO cohort had increased SOL and REM 
sleep latency. There are a number of small studies that have re-
ported variable PSG characteristics in nightmare sufferers.43–49 
REM-specific abnormalities to include absence of early REM 
periods, increased REM sleep latency, and increased REM 
periods, as well as NREM changes to include reduced slow 
wave sleep, have been reported.44,46 Other studies note more 
global changes to include increased sleep latency, sleep frag-
mentation, nocturnal awakenings, and periodic limb move-
ments.41,43,45,46 The most consistent PSG finding is an increase 
in overnight awakenings.49,50 Interestingly, when comparing 
PSG variables in patients with NDO versus TRN, those with 
TRN had improved SE, decreased WASO, and increased stage 
N3 sleep. These findings are distinctly different than their sub-
jective reports and paradoxically suggest that patients with 
TRN had improved sleep quality in the laboratory.
Specifically regarding the increased stage N3 sleep in pa-
tients with TRN, a possible explanation for this unexpected 
phenomenon is that patients with TRN are chronically sleep 
deprived in their habitual sleeping environment from their 
nightmares and hyperarousal, resulting in fragmented poor-
quality sleep. When these patients sleep in the monitored sleep 
laboratory environment that they may perceive as safe, this 
decreases their usual state of nocturnal hyperarousal, which 
could translate to more efficient sleep.51 Further support for 
this theory is that patients with nightmares rarely have this 
parasomnia captured during an attended in-laboratory PSG. 
In terms of the evaluation of NDO and TRN, future studies 
should consider home PSG with video monitoring where these 
parasomnias are more likely to occur.
Similar to insomnia, the rate of comorbid TBI, as well as 
anxiety, depression, and PTSD, was higher in the NDO group 
than the non-NDO group. However, when comparing military 
personnel with NDO versus TRN, it became apparent that the 
association with comorbid disorders was primarily in those 
with TRN. Previous research has established that nightmares, 
but not necessarily TRN, are associated with anxiety and de-
pression.52 In a recent study, Ulmer et al. evaluated veterans 
of Iraq/Afghanistan and reported findings similar to ours.53 In 
their cohort of veterans, 10.1% had TRN, which increased to 
54.1% in veterans with comorbid mental health diagnoses. Al-
though TRN are frequently present in PTSD, these findings 
suggest that TRN occur in a number of behavioral medicine 
disorders and not exclusively PTSD.
Not unexpectedly, the diagnostic rate of OSA was similar 
between the NDO and non-NDO groups at 73.4% and 74.6%, 
respectively. Yet, the TRN group had higher rates of OSA, 
particularly mild OSA, when compared to the NDO group. A 
potential reason for this is that the TRN group had higher rates 
of PTSD and TBI, and in multiple previous studies these disor-
ders have been associated with OSA.20,54 Yet, although the ex-
act etiology of this finding is unknown, it suggests that patients 
with TRN have a more complex condition. Specifically, they 
can manifest multiple sleep (ie, nightmares, OSA, insomnia) 
and comorbid disorders (ie, PTSD, depression, anxiety, TBI) 
and may represent a phenotype particularly vulnerable to the 
untoward effects of trauma.55
Our study has limitations that merit discussion. We as-
sessed the prevalence of nightmares in a sample of military 
personnel referred for the evaluation of sleep disturbances. 
This does not necessarily represent the overall prevalence of 
nightmares in the military population. Although we used vali-
dated questionnaires to determine NDO, clinical interviews 
and nightmare diaries that could have further elucidated the 
etiology and clinical manifestations of their disorder were not 
performed. The diagnoses of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and 
TBI were ascertained from the EMR and may not represent 
definitive diagnoses. The assessment of medications that could 
affect sleep was limited; a more detailed evaluation, specifi-
cally including selective serotonin and norepinephrine reup-
take inhibitors, would help determine potential effects on NDO 
and associated PSG variables. A strength of our study is that it 
provides both subjective and objective characteristics of NDO 
in a relatively large cohort of military personnel. Yet, to further 
the understanding of the effect of nightmares on sleep, future 
studies should ask whether or not patients had a nightmare 
during the PSG.
In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of nightmares 
in military personnel with sleep disturbances. Nightmares 
are likely underrecognized by clinicians and underreported 
by military personnel. Subjectively, patients with NDO had 
worse sleep than those without nightmares, which was further 
exacerbated in those with TRN. However, it is unknown if this 
was from their nightmares or their increased insomnia symp-
toms, comorbid disorders, or a combination of these illnesses. 
Interestingly, military personnel with TRN appeared to have 
better sleep quality on PSG than those with NDO only, noting 
nightmares are rarely reported in the laboratory environment. 
With the relationship between nightmares and suicidality, this 
is an unmet aspect of the care of veterans that requires integra-
tion into clinical practice and further research. As treatment of 
nightmares can improve sleep and potentially mitigate suicide 
risk, it is imperative to evaluate for the presence of nightmares 
in all trauma survivors with sleep disturbances.
