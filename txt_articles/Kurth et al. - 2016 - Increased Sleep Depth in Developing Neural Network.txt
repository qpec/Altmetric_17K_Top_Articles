Brain networks respond to sleep deprivation or restriction with increased sleep depth,
which is quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA) in the sleep electroencephalogram
(EEG). When adults are sleep deprived, this homeostatic response is most pronounced
over prefrontal brain regions. However, it is unknown how children’s developing brain
networks respond to acute sleep restriction, and whether this response is linked to
myelination, an ongoing process in childhood that is critical for brain development
and cortical integration. We implemented a bedtime delay protocol in 5- to 12-year-
old children to obtain partial sleep restriction (1-night; 50% of their habitual sleep).
High-density sleep EEG was assessed during habitual and restricted sleep and brain
myelin content was obtained using mcDESPOT magnetic resonance imaging. The
effect of sleep restriction was analyzed using statistical non-parametric mapping with
supra-threshold cluster analysis. We observed a localized homeostatic SWA response
following sleep restriction in a specific parieto-occipital region. The restricted/habitual
SWA ratio was negatively associated with myelin water fraction in the optic radiation,
a developing fiber bundle. This relationship occurred bilaterally over parieto-temporal
areas and was adjacent to, but did not overlap with the parieto-occipital region showing
the most pronounced homeostatic SWA response. These results provide evidence
for increased sleep need in posterior neural networks in children. Sleep need in
parieto-temporal areas is related to myelin content, yet it remains speculative whether
age-related myelin growth drives the fading of the posterior homeostatic SWA response
during the transition to adulthood. Whether chronic insufficient sleep in the sensitive
period of early life alters the anatomical generators of deep sleep slow-waves is an
important unanswered question.

Sleep and Developing Neural Networks
INTRODUCTION
One fundamental question in the field of neurodevelopment
concerns how inadequate sleep in children affects brain
activity and associated cognitive and behavioral outcomes (Paus
et al., 2008). A growing epidemiological literature indicates
that childhood sleep disturbance predicts future cognitive,
attentional, and psychosocial problems (Gregory et al., 2005;
Simola et al., 2014). Animal studies show that during critical
periods of life, sleep is required for plastic processes underlying
the maturation of specific brain circuits (Jha et al., 2005; Kayser
et al., 2014). In adult humans, extending wakefulness is an
experimental approach for investigating the effects of inadequate
sleep on the brain. Yet, to date, it is unknown which brain circuits
are sensitive to restricted sleep (RS) in children.
The state of deep sleep is associated with changes in neuronal
network organization (Vyazovskiy et al., 2009; Boly et al., 2012;
Kurth et al., 2013). In adults, extending wakefulness triggers a
homeostatic response in subsequent recovery sleep that is best
quantified as increased slow-wave activity (SWA, 1–
4.5 Hz) of
the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG; Achermann and Borbély,
2011). SWA reflects a recovery process in cortical and subcortical
structures that arises from highly synchronized neuronal activity
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2009) and reliably reflects the depth of sleep
(Achermann and Borbély, 2011), as well as local brain plasticity
(Huber et al., 2004, 2006). Learning or sensory stimulation during
wakefulness locally enhances SWA in subsequent sleep (Kattler
et al., 1994; Huber et al., 2004; Wilhelm et al., 2014), suggesting a
local and use-dependent regulation of SWA.
In adults, SWA is most predominant in frontal brain
regions, which are the same areas that show the largest SWA
increase following sleep deprivation (Cajochen et al., 1999;
Finelli et al., 2001). Frontal regions sustain a broad range of
cognitive demands (Duncan and Owen, 2000) and are likely
most plastic when neuronal networks are fully mature. Functions
related to the prefrontal cortex (e.g., working-memory, attention,
arithmetic performance, word fluency) are impaired by sleep
deprivation (Harrison and Horne, 1998; Drummond et al.,
1999; Chee and Choo, 2004). One prominent difference between
children and adults is the local predominance of SWA: a
posterior-to-anterior shift is observed across the first two decades
of life, a spatial trajectory that is consistent with the development
of cortical anatomy (Kurth et al., 2010, 2012). Evidence is
converging that SWA topography reflects developing networks
(Kurth et al., 2010, 2012; Buchmann et al., 2011b) and their
altered trajectories in clinical groups (Ringli et al., 2013; Tesler
et al., 2013; Bolsterli Heinzle et al., 2014).
We investigated school-age children’
s neuronal response to
acute sleep restriction by examining the effects of extending
wakefulness on cortical brain activity during sleep. Further,
we addressed whether the neuronal recovery response during
sleep is correlated with underlying white matter myelination,
a cornerstone of brain development. Because children at
this developmental stage exhibit equal predominance of SWA
in posterior and prefrontal areas (Kurth et al., 2010), we
hypothesized a homeostatic SWA response to acute sleep
restriction over both regions. As the development of cortical and
subcortical networks are linked (Kubota et al., 2013; Alcauter
et al., 2014), we also explored associations between children’
s
SWA response to acute sleep restriction and subcortical local
myelin content.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Healthy children (n = 13; 5–
12 years; six females) followed an
individualized, strict sleep/wakefulness schedule (verified with
actigraphy and sleep diaries) to stabilize sleep at least 5 days
before each of two counterbalanced assessments (Figure 1).
One night of habitual sleep (HS) was scheduled according to
reported habitual bedtimes, i.e., stabilized sleep times. The RS
condition involved an acute 50% reduced bedtime achieved via
a bedtime delay (1-night), while maintaining the same morning
wake time. Average bedtime was 20:58 ± 0:08 (M ± SE, clock
time) for HS and 2:04 ± 0:03 for RS. Average wake time was
07:00 ± 0:01 for HS and 06:59 ± 0:05 for RS. To achieve
sleep restriction, children were kept awake by interacting with
the research team in games or reading. At-home all-night 128-
channel high-density EEG (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Sensor Net,
portable system) was obtained for HS and RS. Multicomponent
relaxometry mcDESPOT (multi-component driven equilibrium
single pulse observation of T1 and T2) MRI (Deoni et al.,
2013) was performed in all subjects to quantify individual maps
of myelin water fraction (MWF; Figure 1). Before enrollment
and after explanation of the study protocol, methods and aims,
written parental consent and child assent was obtained. The
Institutional Review Board at Brown University approved all
procedures, and the study was performed according to the
Declaration of Helsinki.

were included in the analysis. (B) Illustration of the time windows used for the three different comparisons in relation to the homeostatic decrease of sleep pressure.
Each time window included 60 min artifact-free non-REM sleep (stages N2 and N3), and was identified for each individual separately. The time point of the last
common 60 min in HS was determined according to minutes of non-REM sleep passed to the corresponding 60-min-window in RS. (C) Illustration of the three time
windows exemplified in typical hypnograms for the two sleep conditions.
Sleep EEG
Electrode nets were adjusted to vertex and mastoids and filled
with gel electrolyte (ECI, Electro Gel). Following standard
laboratory procedures (Kurth et al., 2010), i.e., impedances
were below 50 k� at the start of the recording, the EEG
was sampled at 500 Hz, filtered from 0.01 to 200 Hz and
referenced to the vertex. Data were filtered offline (bandpass
0.5–
50 Hz) and down-sampled to 128 Hz. Data were then
re-referenced to the average across all channels, and standard
sleep scoring (Iber et al., 2007) was performed. Artifacts were
rejected semi-automatically on a 20-s basis (visual inspection and
power exceeding a threshold based on average power in 0.75–
4.5 and 20–
30 Hz), and poor quality channels were excluded.
Power spectral analysis was performed for all EEG derivations
as previously published (Kurth et al., 2010), including Fast
Fourier transform routine, 20-s-epochs (averages of five 4-s
epochs; Hanning window; no overlap; using pwelch from the
signal processing toolbox, MATLAB, MathWorks) resulting in
a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz. The 20-s spectral power
values of the artifact-free 20-s-epochs were then averaged to
determine SWA in the reported time windows (first 60 min,
last 60 min and last common 60 min, i.e., 180 20-s epochs for
each time window). Epochs containing artifacts were skipped,
such that the same number of epochs was met in each subject.
We used the topoplot function of the EEGLab Matlab toolbox
to display EEG activity (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). According
to a standard approach, values of 109 channels “
above the ears”
were included, in order to minimize artifacts from facial or
neck muscles [as commonly performed, e.g., (Ferrarelli et al.,
2007), Figure 2A]. Three different time windows were utilized

in this analysis (Figures 2B,C): (i) the first 60 min –to examine
the effects of RS under the highest level of sleep pressure;
(ii) the last 60 min – to compare the effects of RS at the
end of the sleep episode, just before awakening; and (iii) the
last common 60 min – to examine sleep restriction effects
during a late window in the sleep episode, while controlling for
the homeostatic decrease of sleep pressure, i.e., after a similar
duration of sleep. The 60 min-windows of artifact-free non-REM
sleep (stages N2 and N3) and data-driven clusters of electrodes
were analyzed. Statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM) was
performed using a supra-threshold cluster analysis, with single
threshold tests representing an increased or more restrictive level
of significance (Nichols and Holmes, 2002), which controls for
multiple comparisons (Huber et al., 2004; Ferrarelli et al., 2007;
Aepli et al., 2015). T-values were calculated for each electrode;
the maximal t-value across all electrodes was identified in all
permutations. From this distribution, the 95th percentile was
defined as the critical value for single threshold tests. Neighboring
electrodes exceeding a t-value of 2.18 (corresponding to p = 0.05
with n = 13) were considered a cluster. In short, data (8192,
i.e., 2ˆ13) were generated from original data by randomly
assigning the condition label and paired t-test were performed.
The maximal size of resulting electrode clusters from these
new datasets that exceeded a t-value of 2.18 was counted,
and the 95th percentile cluster size was determined. For the
HS vs. RS comparison, only clusters above this critical cluster
size were considered significant (Nichols and Holmes, 2002;
Huber et al., 2004). Whether electrodes showing a significant
effect were neighbored and belonged to the same cluster was
determined using electrode locations provided in the fieldtrip
toolbox (Matlab). SnPM was also used to compare anatomical
MWF masks (see details below) with the sleep-restriction induced
changes in the EEG. Pearson correlations were performed at each
derivation. To control for multiple comparisons of correlations,
20,000 permutations were executed, with randomization of the
order of the subjects and a critical value r = 0.55 (corresponding
to p = 0.05, two-tailed with n = 13; Nichols and Holmes,
2002).
mcDESPOT Imaging
All children were imaged using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner,
equipped with a 12-channel head RF array while watching a
movie. Age-appropriate mcDESPOT protocols comprise a series
of spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) images and fully
balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) images acquired
over a range of flip angles (Deoni et al., 2012). Inversion-prepared
(IR-) SPGR data were acquired to correct for transmit magnetic
field (B1) inhomogeneities, and the bSSFP data were acquired
with two different phase-cycling patterns to allow correction
for main magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneities. A constant voxel
dimension (1.8 mm × 1.8 mm × 1.8 mm) was used, with
the field of view and imaging matrix adjusted for age and
head size. To reduce acoustic noise, the maximum imaging
gradient slew rates and peak values were lowered, and passive
measures, including sound-insulating bore liner, MiniMuff ear
pads, and sound-attenuating ear protectors were used (Deoni
et al., 2012).
Processing involved linear co-registration of each subject’
s raw
SPGR, IR-SPGR, and bSSFP images to account for subtle intra-
scan motion and removal of non-brain signal. B0 and B1 field
map calibration was followed by MWF map calculation through
the iterative fitting of a three-pool tissue model by a constrained
fitting approach providing stable estimates (Deoni et al., 2013).
Next, individual MWF maps were non-linearly co-registered
to a common standardized space. High flip angle T1-weighted
SPGR images, acquired as part of mcDESPOT, were used for this
alignment (Deoni et al., 2012), and the obtained transformation
matrix was applied to individuals’
MWF maps. Maps were then
smoothed with a 4 mm full-width-at-half maximum 3D Gaussian
kernel within a white and gray matter mask. Finally, mean MWF
values were calculated for anatomical masks as defined in Deoni
et al. (2012), including whole brain, frontal, parietal, occipital,
temporal lobe, cerebellum, cingulum, corona radiata, capsula
interna, optic radiation, superior longitudinal fascicle, and corpus
callosum. MWF was calculated as the average of left and right
hemisphere.
RESULTS
To examine the response to sleep restriction, we contrasted the
EEG response as RS/HS ratio. Acute sleep restriction induced
a global increase in non-REM sleep EEG power over a broad
frequency range (Figure 3, first 60 min). The largest increase
occurred in the slower frequencies (SWA and frequencies up
to 10 Hz) as observed in the increased percentage of EEG
power (Figure 3A) and in the number of electrodes showing
a significant change in power (Figure 3B). We also observed
an increase in theta and sigma power. This sleep restriction
induced effect in sigma power was frequency-specific (increase
at 10–
11 and 14–
15 Hz, and little-to-no between 12 and 13 Hz)
and occurred in a local manner (i.e., a high proportion of
electrodes changed in the 10–
11 Hz range in contrast to a low
proportion of electrodes changing in the remaining sigma range).

Sleep and Developing Neural Networks
Regionally, the increase in SWA occurred within a parieto-
occipital cluster (Figures 4A,B; 13 electrodes; three survived the
restrictive single-threshold tests). The SWA increase remained
when taking into account the last 60 min of artifact-free non-
REM sleep; however, this effect was characterized by a global
rather than a local response (significant effect in a cluster
consisting of 95 electrodes, whereof 15 survive single-threshold
test, critical value t = 3.17; Figures 4C,D). When comparing the
last common 60 min (Figures 4E,F), no difference between the
conditions remained. Thus, the homeostatic SWA response to
sleep restriction was most pronounced over posterior regions and
showed the strongest regional differentiation in early sleep. In the
next steps, we thus capitalized on the first 60 min of non-REM
sleep.
Next, we examined associations between myelin content and
the regional SWA response to sleep restriction. As expected for
the age group studied (Deoni et al., 2012), correlations between
participant age and MWF in the anatomical masks revealed
positive relationships (range: 0.45–
0.82; all p < 0.05, except for
the optic radiation p = 0.05, one-tailed). Two brain areas showed
a negative relationship between the SWA response and MWF
content in the optic radiation (Figure 5, correlation coefficient
r ranged from −0.57 to −0.67), which survived controlling for
multiple comparisons yet not the single threshold tests. These
parieto-temporal areas do not overlap with the region showing
the largest SWA rebound after sleep restriction (parieto-occipital
cluster first identified in Figure 4). No other anatomical masks
showed associations between MWF and SWA.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the effects of acute sleep restriction via
a 50% bedtime delay on sleep EEG activity and associations
with brain myelin content in 5- to 12-year old children. The
main finding shows a local homeostatic SWA response to RS
in children that implies high neuronal responsiveness to sleep
restriction in a specific parieto-occipital region. Evidence in
adults indicates that the homeostatic SWA increase in response
to sleep deprivation occurs in anterior as well as posterior

FIGURE 5 | (Left) MWF in the optic radiation is related to the homeostatic SWA response (Pearson correlation at each electrode, two-tailed, p < 0.05; SnPM

derivations (Cajochen et al., 1999; Finelli et al., 2001; Knoblauch
et al., 2002). We found a negative relationship between the
homeostatic SWA response and MWF in the optic radiation
bilaterally, though not entirely symmetrical. These data suggest
that sleep need in parieto-temporal areas is related to myelin
content. Yet, it is likely that factors other than MWF may
determine the immature homeostatic response in school-age
children, as the areas with maximal SWA rebound were not
related to myelin content in MWF of any of the anatomical
masks investigated here. These preliminary and novel findings
expand previous knowledge about behavioral, sleep homeostatic
and neurocognitive processing responses to sleep loss in children
and adolescents (Jenni et al., 2005; Berger et al., 2012; Molfese
et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2014).
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that acute
sleep restriction in children induces a neuronal topographical
response that differs from adults. While adults exhibit the
most pronounced response to RS over prefrontal brain regions
(Cajochen et al., 1999; Finelli et al., 2001; Knoblauch et al., 2002),
our data show that children‘
s response is most pronounced over
parieto-occipital areas, suggesting that developing brain circuits
are particularly sensitive to RS. Although, our observed effects
according to frequency were similar to published data in adults
(Finelli et al., 2001), the region-specific power increase in the
faster sigma range in our childhood sample is not consistent
with findings from older age groups and warrants further
investigation.
Myelin growth is a main contributor to overall maturation
of brain connectivity (Fields, 2008) and cognitive functions
(O’
Muircheartaigh et al., 2013), which experience developmental
spurts across childhood (Johnson and Munakata, 2005). Recent
data indicate a role for sleep in processes associated with
membrane synthesis, oligodendrocyte proliferation and myelin
growth (Cirelli, 2005; Bellesi et al., 2013). Consistent with
these observations, we found a relationship between MWF
in the optic radiation and the SWA response; however, this
association was not observed in the exact same area where
the SWA response was most pronounced (Figures 4 and 5).
The optic radiation connects the lateral geniculate body and
the posterior thalamus with the primary visual cortex of the
occipital lobe. Functionally, the optic radiation is a part of visual,
spatial-attentional circuits (Toosy et al., 2004) and inter-related
with multi-sensory integration (Pasqualotto and Proulx, 2012).
Because recent evidence shows that neurodevelopment is more
protracted than previously appreciated (Petanjek et al., 2011),
prolonged plasticity of multi-sensory circuits may provide fine-
tuning of environmental adaptations (Ernst, 2008). Indeed, the
optic radiation continues to undergo microstructural changes
through childhood (Deoni et al., 2012). Even in our small
sample, we found a developmental trend in the increase of
MWF in the optic radiation (i.e., correlation with age, r = 0.47,
p = 0.05; one-tailed), which supports the prolonged development
of multisensory integration circuits during childhood (Gori et al.,
2008). Thus, considering that local sleep SWA reflects cortical
plasticity (Steriade and Timofeev, 2003) and parallels the spatial
trajectory of neurodevelopment (Kurth et al., 2010), we propose
that the posterior homeostatic SWA response may pinpoint brain
regions most susceptible to sleep loss.
In adults, individual differences in the white matter volume
of the corpus callosum explain 38% of the variability of
SWA (Buchmann et al., 2011a). Moreover, as measured with
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), frontal white matter tracts

Sleep and Developing Neural Networks
(forceps minor, anterior corpus callosum) and the temporal
fascicle are associated with slow wave morphology, such that
adults with higher axial diffusivity are more likely to exhibit
steeper slow wave slopes (Piantoni et al., 2013). Yet, SWA
undergoes remarkable maturation from childhood through
adolescence (Campbell and Feinberg, 2009; Kurth et al., 2010),
and our findings suggest that the brain response to sleep
restriction varies also with age. It is therefore fundamental
to understand to what degree brain maturation is reflected
in the sleep EEG (i.e., experience-independent, developmental
changes) and whether brain maturation is facilitated by the
process of sleep itself (i.e., experience-dependent/experience-
expectant).
Electroencephalogram slow waves arise from slow oscillations
of the membrane potential that alternate between hyperpolarized
“
down” states and depolarized “
up” states (Steriade et al.,
1993a,b). When sleep pressure is high, fluctuations in membrane
potentials are highly synchronized across neuronal networks
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2009), which gives rise to large amplitude
slow waves on the scalp EEG. Cortical activity is also determined
by structural and functional properties of connecting subcortical
myelinated fibers (Crunelli and Hughes, 2010; Alcauter et al.,
2014; O’
Muircheartaigh et al., 2015). Relatedly, mechanistic
bi-directional interactions between sleep and myelin plasticity
have been proposed via oligodendrocyte proliferation, the
mediators of myelin formation (Bellesi et al., 2013). Interestingly,
oligodendrocyte development and myelination may be closely
linked to neuronal activity (Stevens et al., 2002; Fields,
2011). The myelin sheath provides metabolic supplies for
high neuronal activity and maintenance (Lee et al., 2012),
and neural activity-induced glutamate release along axons
seems to trigger myelination (Kukley et al., 2007). During
development, both cortical neurons and subcortical myelin
are to some degree plastic. Because different brain regions
experience periods of increased plasticity at different times during
development (Mychasiuk et al., 2013), sleep-wake-plasticity
interactions may not be only age-specific but also region-
specific.
Our results represent an important first step in understanding
associations between white matter myelin content and local sleep
need in the developing human brain. We believe that mapping
SWA using high-density sleep EEG is a particularly useful,
non-invasive imaging modality for monitoring the brain in
pediatric populations, where other functional imaging methods
are often difficult or impossible to use (Lustenberger and Huber,
2012). These data are critical for gaining new insights into the
possible vulnerability of the developing brain as a result of
insufficient sleep; however, our findings need to be interpreted in
the context of several limitations. Foremost, the generalizability
of our results is reduced because we studied only healthy,
good sleeping children whose families agreed to complete the
experimental protocol. Further, this is a small, cross-sectional
sample in which we used SnPM to reduce the likelihood of
type-I errors by controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally,
while sleep deprivation in adults impairs cognitive functions
related to the prefrontal cortex (Harrison and Horne, 1998;
Drummond et al., 1999; Chee and Choo, 2004), whether, sleep
deprivation in school-age children similarly impairs functions
associated with parieto-occipital brain areas needs further
investigation.
In summary, our findings in school-age children revealed a
local sleep homeostatic response following acute sleep restriction
as measured by increased SWA in parieto-occipital areas and
a negative relationship between the homeostatic SWA increase
in adjacent, parieto-temporal areas and local myelin content
in the optic radiation. Our data suggest high plasticity over
parietal-occipital areas in children, which is consistent with
anatomical (Kolb and Gibb, 2014), neuroimaging (Giedd et al.,
2015) and behavioral data (Spear, 2000; Dumontheil, 2014). In
the past, SWA has been linked to cortical plasticity (Huber et al.,
2004); however, it has been suggested that cortical activity and
subcortical fiber plasticity may trigger reciprocal growth and
maintenance (Alcauter et al., 2014). Of note, our data show
that the SWA rebound after sleep restriction in children is
strongest at the beginning of the night and levels off across
time asleep (last common 60 min), which is consistent with
existing knowledge of the homeostatic time course of sleep
regulation, as reviewed in Achermann and Borbély (2011). In
comparison, our finding of a global difference in sleep pressure
between experimental conditions in the last 60 min of sleep
may provide insights into understanding a pathway by which
chronic insufficient sleep and poor behavioral outcomes are
linked (Kurth et al., 2015). Sleep deprivation in adults not only
enhances SWA but also decreases fast spindle activity, and a
reciprocal relationship between these two events has been implied
(Aeschbach and Borbely, 1993; Knoblauch et al., 2002). Because
we observed the opposite in children –sleep restriction induced
mostly an increase in slow sigma power (Figure 3A), which was
region-specific –the SWA-spindle relationship warrants further
analysis.
CONCLUSION
We propose that the local SWA response to acute sleep
restriction in children signifies increased plasticity related
to ongoing neural refinement processes. Our findings also
indicate that the local appearance of the electrophysiological
marker of sleep homeostasis, SWA, is related to brain myelin
morphology. Future studies are needed to investigate the
functional consequences of inadequate sleep during different
stages of development and to identify the key factors involved in
the generation of the posterior homeostatic response in school-
age children.
