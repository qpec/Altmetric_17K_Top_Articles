Abstract
Objectives—The Natural Cycles application is a fertility awareness-based contraceptive method, 
which uses dates of menstruation and basal body temperature to inform couples whether protected 
intercourse is needed to prevent pregnancies. Our purpose with this study is to investigate the 
contraceptive efficacy of the mobile application by evaluating the perfect- and typical-use Pearl 
Index.
Study Design—In this prospective observational study, 22,785 users of the application logged a 
total of 18,548 woman-years of data into the application. We used these data to calculate typical- 
and perfect-use Pearl Indexes, as well as 13-cycle pregnancy rates using life-table analysis.
Results—We found a typical-use Pearl Index of 6.9 pregnancies per 100 woman-years (95% CI: 
6.5–7.2), corrected to 6.8 (95% CI: 6.4–7.2) when truncating users after 12 months. We estimated 
a 13-cycle typical-use failure rate of 8.3% (95% CI: 7.8–8.9). We found that the perfect-use Pearl

 Index was 1.0 pregnancies per 100 woman-years (95% CI: 0.5–1.5). Finally we estimated that the 
rate of pregnancies from cycles where the application erroneously flagged a fertile day as infertile 
was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.4–0.7) per 100 woman-years. We estimated a discontinuation rate over 12 
months of 54%.
Conclusions—This study shows that the efficacy of a contraceptive mobile application is higher 
than ususally reported for traditional fertility awareness-based methods. The application may 
contribute to reducing the unmet need for contraception.

1. Introduction
Fertility-Awareness based methods for contraception
Fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods of contraception are methods based on identifying 
a woman’s approximately six fertile days of each menstrual cycle and a couple adapting 
their sexual behavior according to this knowledge [1, 2]. Various prospective studies have 
identified the number of fertile days in a cycle as well as day-by-day conception 
probabilities [3, 4].
The input parameters for the identification and prediction of fertile days in FAB methods are 
a woman’s cycle lengths, basal body temperature (BBT), quality of the cervical mucus, 
urine- or saliva-based fertility markers or combinations of these [5]. The mobile application 
under study in this paper uses BBT and dates of menstruation as input, with optional input of 
luteinizing hormone (LH) test results.
FAB methods provide an option for women who do not want to use hormonal contraceptives 
for medical or personal reasons. Several FAB methods provide comparable contraceptive 
effectiveness to other modern contraceptive methods [6, 7], though generally require higher 
dedication from the users.
The perfect-use failure rates of FAB methods that have been computed correctly vary from 
0.4 per 100 woman-years to 4.8% annual pregnancy probability [8–11]. Published typical-
use failure rates for FAB methods range from 1.6% per year up to above 20% [10, 12].
Several fertility monitoring devices based on FAB methods are available on the market, but 
their contraceptive efficacy are not known with a few notable exceptions [13–15].
Berglund Scherwitzl et al. estimated the typical-use efficacy of the Natural Cycles mobile 
application to be 7.0 pregnancies per 100 woman-years, and the conception probability over 
13 cycles to be 7.5% [16]. These calculations were based on 2,053 woman-years of data 
collected from 4,054 women. This was the first study to calculate the contraceptive efficacy 
of a FAB method supported by a mobile application, but did not fully adhere to the 
guidelines set out by Trussell and Kost [17]. The method failure rate, i.e. a conservative 
estimate of the rate of pregnancies in cycles where the algorithm erroneously mislabeled a

 fertile day as infertile was computed similar to studies of other fertility monitoring devices 
[18]. However, the study lacked a correctly computed perfect-use failure rate, included 
retrospective elements and did not have a 1-year follow-up. In this prospective study, we 
employ a larger dataset and longer follow-up times to calculate the perfect-use efficacy of 
the application, as well as to re-investigate the typical-use efficacy and the method failure 
rate.
2. Material and Methods
2.1 The mobile application
Users of the Natural Cycles mobile application log menstrual cycle dates and BBT data into 
a device such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. The underlying technology is a statistical 
algorithm that uses a color code to signal to the user whether a given day is likely to be in 
the fertile window [16, 19]. The predictions improve over time as the algorithm incorporates 
more user data into its calculations.
The algorithm can identify the ovulation day with high precision and concomitantly has very 
low probability of falsely attributing a fertile day as infertile [19].
In addition to menstruation and BBT data, users are encouraged to take a urine LH test on 
days close to predicted ovulation, as well as to take a pregnancy test if the data indicate a 
possible pregnancy. The application detects pregnancy by looking for a combination of (i) 
delayed menses and (ii) a longer period of elevated temperature levels consistent with the 
implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus [20]. Users may also log sexual activity. On a 
given day they can log protected, unprotected or no intercourse. This information was used 
as input for calculation of the perfect-use failure rate. Furthermore, users were asked in-app 
“What form of contraception do you use on red days?”. Answering this question was 
voluntary, and complemented the intercourse information logged by the user.
2.2 Study Design
This prospective observational analysis included all women who registered as paying users 
of Natural Cycles between August 1 2014 and August 1 2016 with the intent of preventing 
pregnancies. We included no data from menstrual cycles starting after January 31 2017 in 
the study. We followed users until they had reported a positive pregnancy test, answered a 
follow-up email or reported menstruation in the application, up until a final cut-off at March 
9, 2017.
Recruitment used end-consumer marketing techniques. All users included in the study 
agreed at registration to share data anonymously for research and were free to withdraw their 
consent at any time through their profile settings in the application. Each participant had to 
log at least 20 days of data in total (such a daily log can contain any combination of 
menstruation, BBT, LH test, pregnancy test result, sexual activity and personal notes) to be 
included in the data analysis. We imposed this lower limit mainly to exclude women who 
registered with no real intention of using the application, but also to exclude users who were 
already pregnant when registering.

 We detected pregnancies primarily through the users logging a positive pregnancy test in the 
application. We attempted to follow up with women who discontinued the method, through 
in-app messages and via email. We then classified all users lost to follow-up in one of three 
categories, based on the BBT at discontinuation, and at what time in the menstrual cycle 
they discontinued:
1.
We considered users likely to be pregnant if they discontinued at a late day of 
their luteal phase and/or reported high BBT when discontinuing after ovulation. 
We treated these women as pregnant for all calculations unless they stated 
explicitly in follow-up that they were not.
2.
We considered users very unlikely to be pregnant if they discontinued at a point 
in their cycle when it was very improbable that they were pregnant (e.g. between 
menstruation and ovulation). We do not find it accurate to denote a possible later 
pregnancy of such a user as due to contraceptive failure. We treated these women 
as not pregnant for all calculations unless they stated explicitly in follow-up that 
they were.
3.
We considered users possibly pregnant if we could not easily place them in either 
of the above categories (e.g. a user who quit early in the luteal phase with BBT 
incompatible with their follicular phase). We treated such users as having 
unknown pregnancy status. We treated these users as not pregnant in the main 
efficacy analysis. However, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which all 
possibly pregnant women were treated as pregnant, as a worst-case scenario.
We censored the exposure time of pregnant women at the time of the reported pregnancy 
test.
We removed women from the study who stated in follow-up that their pregnancy was 
planned despite using the application in the prevention mode. However, we additionally 
performed a sensitivity analysis by including these women and counting their planned 
pregnancies as contraceptive failures.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committee (EPN, 
Stockholm, diary number 2017/563-31).
2.3 Data Analysis
We estimated efficacies using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis to find 13-cycle typical-use 
pregnancy rates [21], as well as by calculating the Pearl Index for typical and perfect usage 
[22]. We calculated confidence intervals for life-tables as suggested by Kalbfleisch and 
Prentice [23]. Calculating a perfect-use efficacy of a FAB method requires knowledge of 
when the women had intercourse, in order to distinguish between perfect and imperfect 
usage.
To achieve a definition of perfect use that provides enough statistical precision while making 
minimal assumptions, we used an approach similar to Frank-Hermann et al. [10]. We treated 
certain modes of sexual behavior as constituting perfect use, and then related all pregnancies 
occurring during perfect use to all perfect-use cycles. A perfect-use cycle in this study is a

 cycle in which the user was sexually active but had no unprotected intercourse on days 
indicated as fertile. The calculation of perfect-use efficacy thus requires detailed intercourse 
information for such days. As intercourse logging was voluntary, the information needed 
was available for only a subset of cycles. In estimating the perfect-use efficacy we counted 
cycles in which a user logged either protected intercourse or no intercourse on any of the 
days indicated as fertile, while not logging unprotected intercourse on these fertile days.
Besides calculating a Pearl Index, we followed the method of Trussell and Grummer-Strawn 
in calculating the 13-cycle probability of contraceptive failure as 1-(1-p)13 [11], where p is 
the per-cycle probability of failure for a user, calculated using all perfect-use cycles and 
pregnancies. For the calculation of p each woman was allowed to contribute a maximum of 
13 cycles.
Since a woman may register at any time during her cycle, we calculated her exposure from 
registration to censoring. We added up these individual contributions to calculate the typical-
use Pearl Index using a woman-year consisting of 365 days. We additionally calculated a 
one-year Pearl Index for which each woman was allowed to contribute a maximum exposure 
of 365 days.
Finally we calculated how often a pregnancy occurred in a cycle where the application failed 
by erroneously indicating a fertile day as infertile. This estimate is what was labeled as the 
perfect-use failure rate in the previous study and is here instead labeled as the method failure 
rate [15]. We calculate this as a Pearl Index after first removing pregnancies where the user 
logged unprotected intercourse on a correctly indicated fertile day closer to ovulation.
3. Results
The study comprised 22,785 women fulfilling the inclusion criteria, who on average 
contributed 9.8 months of data, yielding a total of 18,548 women-years of exposure. 4,182 
additional women had registered without logging the 20 data points required for inclusion – 
778 of these registered without logging any data at all. Table 1 lists the exposure times of the 
women studied. 6,944 (30%) of them contributed more than a year of data.
The average age of the users was 29.2 years (1 standard deviation = 5.0 years). The women 
registered as paying users of the application in 37 different countries, with a large majority 
(79%) from Sweden. We registered a total of 1,273 pregnancies. These numbers are all 
reported after we first removed the exposure and pregnancies of 25 women who in our 
follow-up reported that their pregnancy was planned. Out of the 1,273 pregnancies, 62 were 
registered in the first cycle of usage. Figure 1 shows a flow chart describing how these 
pregnancies were determined. Table 2 shows the total number of cycles, woman-years and 
pregnancies during perfect use and typical use. In 32% of all menstrual cycles, the users 
registered some type of intercourse information (protected, unprotected or no intercourse), 
and 9.6% of the cycles were considered perfect-use cycles. In 603 (47%) of all cycles with 
pregnancies, no intercourse was reported.
Using the data in Table 2 we calculated a perfect-use PI of 1.0 (95 % CI: 0.5–1.5) 
pregnancies per 100 woman-years, and a 13-cycle pregnancy probability of 1.0% (95% CI: 
Berglund Scherwitzl et al.

 0.5–1.5). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier cumulated probability of non-pregnancy as a 
function of the number of cycles, for typical use. The 13-cycle typical-use failure rate was 
8.3% (95% CI: 7.8–8.9).
The typical-use PI was 6.9 pregnancies per 100 woman-years (95% CI: 6.5–7.2). Truncating 
each user at a maximum of 365 days yielded a PI of 6.8 (95% CI: 6.4–7.2). The difference 
between the one-year PI and the life-table figure stems from the fact that many women, 
especially those who previously used hormonal contraceptives, have longer than average 
early cycles.
At the end of follow-up, we considered 402 women possibly pregnant but with pregnancy 
status unknown. In the worst-case scenario where all these women were pregnant, the 
typical-use PI was 9.0 if all exposure times were taken into account, and 9.3 if users were 
censored after contributing 13 cycles.
The method failure rate was 0.5 pregnancies (95% CI: 0.4–0.7) per 100 woman-years.
The discontinuation rate over 12 months was 54%. The discontinuation rate per month was 
constant over the year, with the exception of cycle 0 in which very few of the selected 
women discontinued (due to the 20 data points requirement).
A sensitivity analysis including the 25 women removed due to having reported the 
pregnancy as planned showed that the typical-use Pearl Index increased from 6.9 to 7.0, the 
life-table pregnancy probability increased from 8.3 to 8.5 and the method failure rate 
increased from 0.5 to 0.6. The perfect-use failure rate decreased very slightly, from 1.0253 
to 1.02232, well within the rounding accuracy.
4. Discussion
We found that the Pearl Index including all cycles is 6.9 pregnancies per 100 woman-years, 
and that the 1-year Pearl Index is 6.8 per 100 woman-years, while the pregnancy rate at 
typical use is 8.3% per year for the first 13 cycles. All these results are consistent with the 
2016 study [16], but the precision is higher in this study. While Pearl Indexes during typical 
use could have been expected to be significantly lower in this study than in the previous one 
due to the longer exposure time, it is possible that the larger user base with a smaller fraction 
of more dedicated users (e.g. “early-adopters”) cancels this effect.”
Of the 1,273 pregnant women, 259 actively changed the mode of operation to “plan a 
pregnancy” within the application on the same date as they reported the pregnancy. While 
this change is in part due to the inherent software design, it is likely that many of these 
women planned a pregnancy without changing their stated intent prior to their pregnancy. In 
order to be as conservative as possible, we considered all these pregnancies as failures 
during typical use. As a result, the typical-use Pearl index is almost certainly biased 
upwards. In the future, women who suddenly start logging a lot of unprotected intercourse 
around ovulation will be asked to either switch to the “plan a pregnancy” mode or actively 
state that they still do not plan a pregnancy.

 The perfect-use PI was 1.0 pregnancies per 100 woman-years, and the 13-cycle pregnancy 
probability was 1.0%. These figures make it possible to compare the efficacy of Natural 
Cycles to other means of contraception. The definition of perfect use of the application in 
this study matches what the users of the application are instructed to do, i.e. to abstain or 
practice protected intercourse on red days. Other studies have calculated comparable perfect-
use efficacies of FAB methods when complemented by other methods on fertile days. Frank-
Hermann et al. calculated the efficacy of a sympto-thermal method complemented by 
condom to be 0.6 [10], and Arevalo et al. calculated the efficacy of the TwoDay method to 
be 6.3 when complemented by condom or withdrawal [9].
As we lacked sufficient knowledge of our users’ behavior over time, we could not calculate 
life-table results for perfect use. The definition of perfect use we use in this study is likely to 
yield an estimate that is biased upwards. As we only included cycles where we are confident 
users did not have unprotected intercourse on a fertile day we disregard cycles where users 
in fact abstained but did not log this information. We have no other way in practice to 
estimate efficacy during perfect use.
The method failure rate remains consistent with the 2016 study [16]. This quantity, which is 
based on an exact measurement of how often the method fails to protect the user, cannot 
easily be compared to other contraceptives. We nevertheless believe it is of interest, as it 
makes it possible to compare the performance of the Natural Cycles algorithm to other 
algorithm-based FAB methods.
The 54% discontinuation rate is consistent with what has been reported elsewhere for FAB 
methods [24]. Future studies will scrutinize this number in greater detail, as well as 
investigate which women are most likely to discontinue.
This study is one of the largest prospective studies ever performed on a FAB method, 
leading to very high precision in the estimates. The real-life nature, free from any possible 
bias from contact with clinics and health care providers, allows us to investigate the typical 
use of the application in a more direct sense than many other studies of contraceptive 
effectiveness. On the other hand, the real-life nature means it is less clear who is to be 
considered pregnant, and any such estimate must rely to some extent on credible 
assumptions about the pregnancy status. In this study we have complemented the estimate of 
efficacy during typical use with an estimate based on the worst-case assumption that 
everyone who was lost to follow-up while possibly pregnant was in fact pregnant. These two 
estimates indicate the possible span of typical-use failure rates.
The low thresholds for entering and exiting the study contribute to a relatively high drop-out 
rate. It is possible that because of the similarity between using FAB methods for prevention 
and for planning a pregnancy, several of the pregnant users were actually planning their 
pregnancies, but never changed to the pregnancy-planning mode in the application.
The lack of information on intercourse from most users is a challenge when calculating 
perfect-use efficacy of the application. Future investigators of similar data need to be aware 
of this issue.

 Implications
The measured typical- and perfect-use efficacy of the mobile application Natural Cycles 
are important parameters for women considering their contraceptive options as well as for 
the clinicians advising them. The large available dataset in this paper allows for future 
studies on acceptability, e.g. by studying the efficacy for different cohorts and geographic 
regions.
