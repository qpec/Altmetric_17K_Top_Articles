The seventh cholera pandemic has heavily affected Africa, although the origin and
continental spread of the disease remain undefined. We used genomic data from 1070
Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates, across 45 African countries and over a 49-year period, to show
that past epidemics were attributable to a single expanded lineage. This lineage was
introduced at least 11 times since 1970, into two main regions, West Africa and
East/Southern Africa, causing epidemics that lasted up to 28 years. The last five
introductions into Africa, all from Asia, involved multidrug-resistant sublineages that
replaced antibiotic-susceptible sublineages after 2000. This phylogenetic framework
describes the periodicity of lineage introduction and the stable routes of cholera spread,
which should inform the rational design of control measures for cholera in Africa.
C
holera is an acute intestinal infection caused
by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which
produces cholera toxin (CTX), responsible
for inducing a rapid and massive loss of
body fluids. The seventh cholera pandemic
(7P) began in 1961 in Indonesia, before spreading
globally, in particular to South Asia (1963), Africa
(1970), Latin America (1991), and the Caribbean
(i.e., Haiti) (2010) (1). In 2008 to 2012, half a cen-
tury after the onset of this pandemic, the global
burden of cholera was estimated at 1.4 to 4.0 mil-
lion cases of cholera annually, with 21,000 to
143,000 deaths (2). The agent responsible for
the 7P belongs to the O1 serogroup (or more rarely,
the O139 variant) and the El Tor biotype. Globally,
7P V. cholerae El Tor (7PET) isolates are geneti-
cally homogeneous and linked to a single source,
the Bay of Bengal in South Asia (3). Phylogenetic
analyses have identified at least three indepen-
dent, but temporally overlapping, waves of global
transmission during the 7P (3, 4).
Africa is the continent most affected by the
current pandemic (5); however, little is known
about the propagation routes of cholera in this
region. Basic epidemiological data from indi-
vidual countries have provided some insight into
cholera dynamics (6, 7). Conventional typing
methods such as serotyping (Ogawa and Inaba)
theoretically provide additional data to discrim-
inate lineages across outbreaks; however, they
rapidly proved inadequate or even confusing,
and the multiple molecular typing methods used
in the pregenomic era (8–13) had low resolution
or were generally unsuitable for longer-term phy-
logenetic inference. Furthermore, even in the ge-
nomic era, the use of representative African isolates
has beenvery limited. Previous large-scale genomic
studies on the 7P (3, 4) analyzed only 28 African
isolates and provided a preliminary view of over-
all disease transmission on the continent. Other
genomic studies dealing with epidemics in Africa
have been published, but these studies focused
on the disease exclusively at national or regional
levels (14–17).
We reconstructed the spatiotemporal spread
of cholera across the continent during the 7P by
analyzing the genomes of 1070 V. cholerae El Tor
isolates, including 714 new isolates sequenced
in this study (table S1 and fig. S1). The newly
sequenced African isolates (n = 569) were se-
lected to represent the widest possible temporal
and geographic distribution of cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) (figs. S2
and S3 and supplementary text note 1). In total,
we analyzed the genomes of 651 7PET isolates
collected in 45 of 54 African countries between
1966 and 2014 (table S2). Our sampling of cholera
isolates in Africa over this time frame is represen-
tative of ~1.8 million (46.8%) of the ~3.8 million
cases reported from Africa to the WHO between
1970 and 2014 (table S3 and figs. S2 and S3).
We note that only a small number of isolates
from East and Central Africa from the 1970s and
1980s were available for this study. Consequently,
the duration and geographic spread of the im-
ported sublineages (particularly for T3 and T4;
see below) may have been underestimated, and
some imported sublineages with a limited spatio-
temporal spread may have remained undetected.
Likewise, low-level and sporadic cases are also
likely underrepresented. It is also noteworthy that
this study, focusing on 7PET isolates, does not pre-
clude the existence of non-7PET lineage isolates
causing sporadic disease in Africa, as has been
seen across Latin America [see companion paper
by Domman et al. (18)] and in Mozambique (17).
We used two approaches to obtain a robust
phylogenetic framework for the inference of prop-
agation routes (19). Maximum likelihood phyloge-
netic analysis was performed on the 1070 genomes
(Fig. 1A and fig. S4), with 9300 single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs), evenly distributed over the ge-
nome (table S4). We detected a strong temporal
signal in the molecular data (fig. S5), allowing
us to use a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to
provide divergence times for a spatially and tem-
porally representative subset of 228 isolates (Fig. 1B
and fig. S6). These robust phylogenies enabled
us to infer 11 introductions of 7PET into Africa.

 Each introduction resulted in mid- to long-term
spread of cholera (introduction events T1, T3 to
T12), and one export from Africa to Peru respon-
sible for the Latin American epidemic in the
1990s [T2 (18)] (Fig. 2, table S5, and supplemen-
tary text note 2). All 651 African genomes were
assigned to serogroup O1 on the basis of their rfb
region (fig. S7).
We mapped the phylogenetic data onto histor-
ical records of African cholera outbreaks. The
genomicanalysisidentifiedthetwo“El Torstrains”
known to have invaded Africa in 1970: one in West
Africa (serotype Ogawa) and the other in East
Africa (serotype Inaba).
An “Ogawa strain” was first reported between
July and September 1970, in cholera cases in the
Black Sea region (Odessa and Kerch) of the for-
mer USSR, the Middle East (Lebanon, Israel,
Turkey, Jordan), North Africa (Libya and Tunisia),
and West Africa (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia,
Ghana) (1). This “Ogawa strain” corresponds to
our isolates from the T1 introduction. These initial
African T1 isolates were not directly related to
Iraqi isolates from 1966 (the last isolates obtained
during the western extension of the 7P before a
lull that ended in 1970) but rather related to three
Chinese isolates (1973–1981) and one Indian
isolate (1980). This suggests that the resurgence
of cholera in 1970 may not have been due to a
resumption of westward progression from Iraq,
but instead from a new introduction from South
or East Asia into Russia and the Middle East.
Cholera reached Angola in December 1971 (1).
The origin of this outbreak has remained unclear,
as (i) it occurred more than 1000 km from the
closest country with a cholera outbreak at this
time (Cameroon), and (ii) it was caused by a se-
rotype Inaba strain. Our analysis suggests a West
African origin for this outbreak, with T1 isolates
displaying a non-synonymous SNV (G103A) in the
wbeT gene. This mutation explains the serotype
switch from Ogawa to Inaba (see supplementary
text note 2, fig. S8, and tables S1 and S6). This
sublineage continued to spread throughout South-
ern Africa during the 1970s, and it circulated in
this region until the early 1990s. These findings
are supported by the report of a cholera outbreak
in the Mozambican seaport of Beira, imported by
air from Angola during late 1973 (20). This par-
ticular pattern of long-distance transmission be-
tween Angola and Mozambique may be explained
by a Portuguese decolonization war involving
these two countries at the time. This T1 sub-
lineage was also implicated in a large outbreak
in Portugal in 1974, in which 2467 cases and 48
deaths were recorded (21). Colonial troops were
stationed uphill from one of the springs sup-
plying the city in which the outbreak began (21).
These troops had been traveling back and forth
between their base and Angola, Mozambique, and
Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea Bissau) (21). All
the other Western and Southern European iso-
lates from the early 1970s were found to have
originated from West or North Africa.
After the introduction of cholera into West
Africa in 1970, we identified multiple subsequent
introductions of cholera into this region, with
further extensions to the Gulf of Guinea region
and the Lake Chad Basin on at least three oc-
casions over the next three decades: T7 (intro-
duction dates: 1982 to 1984), T9 (1988 to 1991),
and T12 (2007). The T9 introduction led to out-
breaks with high attack rates, such as those that
struck Guinea in 1994 (436 reported cholera cases
per 100,000 population) and Liberia in 2003 (1241
per 100,000) (table S7).
The second introduction of cholera into Africa
in 1970 occurred in East Africa, particularly in
Ethiopia in November 1970 (1). The strain in-
volved, another “Inaba strain,” corresponds to our
T3 isolates with a premature stop codon (C157T)

 in the wbeT gene (fig. S8 and tables S1 and S6).
The 1970 isolates from Ethiopia are most closely
related to isolates from the same year from Jordan
and Israel (22) (3- to 9-SNV separation), which is
consistent with epidemiological data from the
time that suggested an importation from the
Middle East (1).
Over the course of the 7P, we identified six
other introductions into East Africa (T4, T5, T6,
T10) (mostly the Horn of Africa) and Southern
Africa (T8, T11) (mostly Mozambique) (Fig. 2).
Our data suggest that cholera around the African
Great Lakes for a period of >10 years was due to
the introduction of the T5 and T10 sublineages.
The T5 sublineage was, in particular, associated
with outbreaks in Rwandan refugee camps in
1994, whereas the T8 sublineage was associated
with outbreaks in South Africa in 2001 to 2002
(125,000 cases) and in Zimbabwe in 2008 to 2009
(98,000 cases) (table S7). The T11 sublineage was
also found associated with this latter outbreak.
The T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T8, and, possibly, T9
introduction events involved 7PET sublineages
originating from South or East Asia that were
circulating in the Middle East before importation
into West or East Africa (Figs. 1 and 2). Moreover,
epidemiological data for T1 isolates identified
during an outbreak in the Comoros Islands (in
the Indian Ocean, off the African coast) in 1975
linked them to pilgrims returning from the Hajj,
a religious gathering involving millions of people
(20), where cholera outbreaks were frequently
described until 1989 (23). The most recent in-
troductions (T10 to T12) appear to be imported
directly from South Asia, as no Middle Eastern
isolates were found to belong to the imported
sublineages. This may be due to (i) an increase
in the movement of people between Africa and
South Asia or (ii) a lack of relevant samples, as
the most recent Middle Eastern isolate analyzed
was collected in 2003.
We observed recurrent patterns of transmis-
sion for cholera epidemics in Africa. Separate
7PET sublineages from Asia were repeatedly in-
troduced into two main regions: West Africa and
East/Southern Africa. Epidemic waves then propa-
gated regionally, in some instances spreading to
Central Africa, over periods of a few years to
28 years (Fig. 3 and table S5). Only two notable
instances of sublineage exchange between these
two circulation hotspots were identified: (i) the
spread of a sublineage between Angola and
Mozambique during the Portuguese colonial war
in the 1970s (20) and (ii) the spread of a sublineage
from the African Great Lakes Region to the western
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (6)
and the Central African Republic via the Congo
River and its tributaries in 2011 to 2012 (Fig. 2).
Our study also provides a notable historical
perspective on the evolution of antibioticresistance
in 7PET isolates. Antibiotics have been used for
decades in the treatment of cholera, as an ad-
junct to rehydration therapy, as they shorten the
duration of diarrhea, thereby limiting bacterial
spread [106 to 109 bacteria per milliliter of stool,
with the loss of up to 1 liter of diarrheal fluid per
hour (1)].
Our data suggest that African isolates became
increasingly resistant to antibiotics over time
(figs. S9 to S11). The first antibiotic-resistant
African isolates in our collection were recovered
in the early 1980s. No susceptible isolates have
been collected since 2000 [96.4% susceptible
isolates between 1970 and 1984 (n = 80/83),
36.9% between 1985 and 1999 (n = 100/271),
and 0% between 2000 and 2014 (n = 0/296)]. We
found that recent patterns of antibiotic resistance
among 7PET sublineages in Africa have been
largely driven by resistance determinants already
present within the genomes of the imported sub-
lineages, rather than by the independent local
acquisition of resistance within this region (Fig. 4,
A to C, and figs. S9 to S12).
Where it did occur, the local acquisition of
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (table S5,
fig. S9, supplementary text note 3) mostly involved
multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmids of the IncA/C
group. IncA/C plasmids are the only stably main-
tained plasmids in the 7PET lineage (24). Almost
all T5 isolates (1984 to 1998, wave 1) were found
to contain an MDR IncA/C plasmid (Fig. 4A and
fig. S12). Thissublineage, which circulated through
the African Great Lakes Region, may be derived
from a strain described in Tanzania in 1977. At
that time, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health used
1.79 metric tons of tetracycline to control an out-
break caused by a susceptible strain (25). Five
months later, 76% of the isolates were resistant
to tetracycline and other antibiotics owing to the
acquisition of an IncA/C plasmid (25). We show
that IncA/C plasmids were also acquired repeat-
edly between 1984 and 2014 in T1, T6, and T10
isolates collected in West or East Africa. These
acquisition events may also be linked to mass
chemoprophylaxis, as observed in Madagascar in

 1999 (T10), when doxycycline was used for pro-
phylaxis (26). The acquisition of resistance to
the quinolone nalidixic acid, mediated by various
point mutations in the DNA gyrase gene, gyrA,
was identified three times in Central and East
Africa (Fig. 4B, figs. S10 to S12, and table S1). The
appearance of two independent mutations [result-
ing in the substitution of Ser83 with Arg (S83R)
and Asp87 with Tyr (D87Y)] in T5 isolates may
reflect the heavy use of nalidixic acid for the treat-
ment of dysentery in Rwandan refugee camps,
which experienced concomitant outbreaks of di-
arrhea caused by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and
V. cholerae O1 at this time (27).
Since 2000, almost all antibiotic-resistant 7PET
sublineages circulating in Africa (T8 to T12) orig-
inated from South Asia and carry their ARGs
on genomic islands SXT/R391 (28) or GI-15 (29)
(Fig. 4C, figs. S6 and S11, table S5, and supple-
mentary text note 3). These more recently imported
sublineages also carry resistance mutations in gyrA
[resulting in the replacement of Ser83 with Ile
(S83I); all T10 to T12 isolates] and an additional
mutation in parC [resulting in the substitution of
Ser85 with Leu (S85L)] that decrease susceptibility
to ciprofloxacin (all T11 and T12 isolates). The T9 to
T12 isolates, which contain a similar SXT/R391
element (ICEVchInd5/ICEVchBan5), do not con-
tain tetracyclineresistancegenes. The ARG content
of these SXT/R391-containing sublineages has re-
mained very stable for more than a decade since
their introduction into Africa (Fig. 4D, fig. S12, and
table S1). The apparent incompatibility between
SXT/R391 and IncA/C plasmids in 7PET may be
due to functional interference between these
related elements (28).

tions of 7PET sublineages into Africa describe the

 factors play a much more important role in
cholera dynamics in Africa than climatic and
environmental factors (6, 7). Our data do not
suggest that aquatic environmental reservoirs
are the primary source of epidemic cholera in
Africa, as has been suggested (30). Instead, these
results highlight the role that humans play in
the long-term spread and maintenance of the
pathogen, whether by direct (human-to-human)
orindirect (pollutionof the environment with feces
from cholera patients) transmission. Undoubtedly,
the factors influencing the epidemiology and
transmission of cholera are complex, but these
data provide a detailed genetic context against
which we can gauge the impact of interventions
on future patterns of disease in this region.
