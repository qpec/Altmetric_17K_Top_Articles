Abstract
BACKGROUND—Thresholds for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms vary considerably 
among countries.
METHODS—We examined differences between England and the United States in the frequency 
of aneurysm repair, the mean aneurysm diameter at the time of the procedure, and rates of 
aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related death. Data on the frequency of repair of intact 
(nonruptured) abdominal aortic aneurysms, in-hospital mortality among patients who had 
undergone aneurysm repair, and rates of aneurysm rupture during the period from 2005 through 
2012 were extracted from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England and the U.S. 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Data on the aneurysm diameter at the time of repair were extracted 
from the U.K. National Vascular Registry (2014 data) and from the U.S. National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program (2013 data). Aneurysm-related mortality during the period from 2005 
through 2012 was determined from data obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the U.K. Office of National Statistics. Data were adjusted with the use of direct 
standardization or conditional logistic regression for differences between England and the United 
States with respect to population age and sex.
RESULTS—During the period from 2005 through 2012, a total of 29,300 patients in England and 
278,921 patients in the United States underwent repair of intact abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
Aneurysm repair was less common in England than in the United States (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.49; P<0.001), and aneurysm-related death was more common in 
England than in the United States (odds ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 3.55 to 3.64; P<0.001).

 Hospitalization due to an aneurysm rupture occurred more frequently in England than in the 
United States (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 2.19 to 2.27; P<0.001), and the mean aneurysm diameter 
at the time of repair was larger in England (63.7 mm vs. 58.3 mm, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS—We found a lower rate of repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and a larger 
mean aneurysm diameter at the time of repair in England than in the United States and lower rates 
of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related death in the United States than in England. (Funded by 
the Circulation Foundation and others.)
The decision about whether to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm requires consideration 
of a balance of risks, including aneurysm rupture if surgery is not performed and death due 
to aneurysm repair itself, as well as consideration of an individual patient’s probable life 
expectancy. The decision is influenced by patient and clinician preference, medical 
management of coexisting conditions, and the availability of and access to endovascular 
procedures as an alternative to open repair. The aneurysm diameter is the best predictor of 
aneurysm rupture1,2; the risk increases exponentially with an increasing diameter.3 
Therefore, the aneurysm diameter is a key determinant of the threshold for intervention.
International guidelines recommend that intervention should be considered once the 
aneurysm diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women.4 However, the considerable 
variation in clinical practice reflects uncertainty regarding the best threshold for 
intervention. The proportion of aneurysms that are repaired at a diameter of less than 55 mm 
has been reported to range from 6.4 to 29.0% in various countries.5
The current study aimed to compare the incidence of repair of intact (nonruptured) 
aneurysms and the aneurysm diameters at the time of repair in England with those in the 
United States. We sought to examine whether any difference in the threshold for repair of 
intact aneurysms might be associated with a discrepancy in aneurysm-related mortality 
between the two countries.

 Sample in the United States. These and other data sources that were used in this study are 
described in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
We identified cases of either endovascular or open repair of intact aneurysms between 
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, by a search for patients who had an elective 
admission associated with codes for endovascular or open repair of an aneurysm in the 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), or Office of Population 
Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures, version 4, in the 
Hospital Episode Statistics database and with relevant codes in the International 
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification in Nationwide In-patient 
Sample data. Identification involved the use of published methods6 (described in the 
Supplementary Methods section and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
For the same study period, the Hospital Episode Statistics database was used to determine 
the frequency of hospital admissions for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in England. 
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to determine the same information in the United 
States. Previously published methods7 (described in the Supplementary Methods section in 
the Supplementary Appendix) were used to determine the frequency of hospital admissions.
DATA SOURCES FOR LONG-TERM SURVIVAL AND ANEURYSM-RELATED MORTALITY
Data on long-term survival among patients who had undergone repair of abdominal aortic 
aneurysms between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, were obtained, and follow-up 
data were censored on December 31, 2009. Representative U.S. data were obtained by 
identifying all traditional Medicare beneficiaries who had undergone elective endovascular 
or open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, according to previously published selection 
criteria and coding methods8 (described in the Supplementary Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Data on patients in England were obtained from the Hospital 
Episode Statistics database, as described above.
Data on the frequency of aneurysm-related deaths during the period from 2005 through 2012 
in the United States were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) (www.cdc.gov), and those data in England were obtained from the Office of National 
Statistics (www.ons.gov.uk). Aneurysm-related death in both countries was defined as death 
associated with the causes recorded with the ICD-10 codes listed in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
DATA SOURCES FOR ANEURYSM DIAMETER AND COVARIATE RISK FACTORS
Descriptive data on the preoperative maximum aneurysm diameter at the time of elective 
repair in patients in England were obtained from the National Vascular Registry for the 
period from January through December 2014; data on patients in the United States were 
obtained from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) for the period 
from January through December 2013. Data on the prevalence of abdominal aortic 
aneurysms at each diameter among men in England during the period from 2009 through 
2014 were extracted from the National Health Service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm 
Screening Programme (NAAASP).

 Data on the prevalence of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension were obtained 
with the use of previously published methods9 (described in the Supplementary Methods 
section and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Data on the prevalence of smoking 
during the period from 2001 through 2005 were extracted from the International Mortality 
and Smoking Statistics database (version 4.12), and data on the prevalence of hypertension, 
the use of lipid-lowering medication, and the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia during the 
period from 2005 through 2010 were obtained from the World Health Organization Global 
InfoBase. Because of systematic differences in coding policies between the United States 
and England and the likelihood of resulting ascertainment bias, data on coexisting conditions 
from the Hospital Episode Statistics database, Medicare, and the Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample were not used for risk adjustment.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The direct standardization method was used to adjust for differences in age and sex between 
England and the United States for annual data on the frequency of repair of intact 
aneurysms, hospitalizations for aneurysm rupture, and aneurysm-related deaths. Study 
cohorts were stratified according to sex and 5-year age group. Cohorts in England were 
standardized with reference to the 2011 Office of National Statistics census data, and cohorts 
in the United States were standardized with reference to the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data 
(www.census.gov).
A conditional logistic-regression analysis was performed. This analysis incorporated the age 
and sex strata as blocking variables in the calculation of the adjusted difference between 
England and the United States with respect to the incidence of repair of intact aneurysms, 
hospitalizations for aneurysm rupture, and aneurysm-related deaths. A sensitivity analysis 
was performed to investigate whether the discrepancy in aneurysm-related mortality between 
the United States and England might have been partly related to differences in the 
prevalence of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension. Survival was characterized 
with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between countries by means of a 
Cox proportional-hazards model that incorporated adjustment for age, sex, year of surgery, 
and type of repair procedure (endovascular or open).
For the analysis of aneurysm diameter, crude means were reported for each country, and 
population-weighted means were calculated. A conditional regression analysis incorporating 
age, sex, and country of repair was used to assess the difference in aneurysm diameter at the 
time of repair between England and the United States and to test for statistical significance.
To model the potential effect of U.S. thresholds for aneurysm repair on rates of repair of 
intact aneurysms in England, data on the size of aneurysms at the time of repair were used to 
derive a standardized incidence of aneurysm repair per 100,000 men in the United States. 
Diameter-specific prevalence data from the NAAASP were then used to determine the 
expected standardized rate of aneurysm repair at each aneurysm diameter in England if 
England adopted U.S. rates of repair. All analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute), and Stata software, version 12.0 (StataCorp).

 RESULTS
FREQUENCY OF ANEURYSM REPAIR
During the period from 2005 through 2012, a total of 29,300 patients underwent repair of 
intact abdominal aortic aneurysms in England (according to the Hospital Episode Statistics 
data), as compared with an estimated 278,921 patients who underwent repair of intact 
abdominal aortic aneurysms in the United States (according to the Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample data). The incidence of repair of intact aneurysms in England increased from 27.11 
procedures per 100,000 persons in 2005 to 31.85 per 100,000 in 2012 (Fig. 1A). During the 
same period, the incidence of repair of intact aneurysms in the United States increased from 
57.85 procedures per 100,000 persons in 2005 to 64.17 per 100,000 in 2012.
Across all study years and after standardization for population age and sex, repair of intact 
aneurysms was significantly less common per 100,000 population in England than in the 
United States (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.49; P<0.001) (Table 
S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall during the study, the percentage of repairs of 
intact aneurysms that were endovascular procedures was lower in England than in the United 
States (45.5% vs. 67.0%, P<0.001). This lower rate persisted in 2012 despite an increase in 
endovascular repair procedures in England over time (the percentages of repairs that were 
endovascular procedures in 2012 were 67.2% in England vs. 75.4% in the United States, 
P<0.001 [Fig. 1B]).
IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY AND LONG-TERM SURVIVAL
Overall, in-hospital mortality among patients who had undergone aneurysm repair was 2.6% 
in England as compared with 1.8% in the United States (0.9% vs. 0.8% among patients who 
had undergone endovascular repair and 4.1% vs. 4.0% among patients who had undergone 
open repair). After standardization for the method of repair, age, sex, and year of surgery, 
there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between England and the United 
States (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.12; P = 0.40).
Among 11,409 patients who had undergone aneurysm repair in England and 34,073 
Medicare patients who had undergone aneurysm repair in the United States during the 
period from 2005 through 2008, the rate of 3-year survival was 78.5% in England versus 
79.5% in the United States (76.6% vs. 79.8% among patients who had undergone 
endovascular repair and 78.1% vs. 79.1% among patients who had undergone open repair) 
(Fig. 2). After adjustment for age, sex, year of surgery, and endovascular versus open repair, 
there was no significant difference in the rate of 3-year survival between patients who had 
undergone aneurysm repair in England and those who had undergone this procedure in the 
United States (hazard ratio for death, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.02; P = 0.17).
ANEURYSM RUPTURE
During the period from 2005 through 2012, a total of 17,253 patients in England and 35,922 
patients in the United States were hospitalized for aneurysm rupture. The incidence 
decreased from 21.34 hospitalizations due to aneurysm rupture per 100,000 population in 
England in 2005 to 16.30 per 100,000 in 2012 (Fig. 3A). During the same period, the

 incidence in the United States decreased from 10.10 hospitalizations due to aneurysm 
rupture per 100,000 population in 2005 to 7.29 per 100,000 in 2012. Across all study years 
and after standardization for population age and sex, hospitalization due to aneurysm rupture 
was significantly more common in England than in the United States (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% 
CI, 2.19 to 2.27; P<0.001) (Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).
ANEURYSM-RELATED DEATH
During the period from 2005 through 2012, a total of 39,740 aneurysm-related deaths 
occurred in England, as compared with 51,475 aneurysm-related deaths in the United States. 
The incidence decreased from 53.55 aneurysm-related deaths per 100,000 persons in 
England in 2005 to 34.43 per 100,000 in 2012 (Fig. 3B). Over the same period, aneurysm-
related deaths decreased in the United States from 16.24 per 100,000 persons in 2005 to 9.03 
per 100,000 in 2012.
Across all study years and after standardization for population age and sex, aneurysm-
related death was significantly more common in England than in the United States (odds 
ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 3.55 to 3.64; P<0.001) (Table S2C in the Supplementary Appendix). 
After a sensitivity analysis that included adjustment for the prevalence of smoking, 
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, aneurysm-related death remained significantly 
more common in England than in the United States (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% CI, 3.33 to 3.76; 
P<0.001).
ANEURYSM DIAMETER AT THE TIME OF REPAIR
According to the National Vascular Registry, during the period from January through 
December 2014, a total of 4128 patients in England (12% female) underwent repair of intact 
aneurysms, with a mean (±SD) maximum preoperative aneurysm diameter of 63.8±12.7 mm 
(64.1±12.9 mm in men and 61.7±10.8 mm in women) (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Endovascular repair was performed at a significantly lower diameter than open 
repair, and more men than women underwent repair below the recommended threshold 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
According to the NSQIP, during the period from January through December 2013, a total of 
2598 patients in the United States (21% female) underwent repair of intact aneurysms, with 
a mean maximum preoperative aneurysm diameter of 58.2±13.2 mm (58.6±13.4 mm in men 
and 56.3±12.0 mm in women) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Endovascular 
repair was performed at a significantly lower diameter than open repair, and more men than 
women underwent repair below the recommended threshold (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
With the use of population weighting for age and sex, the weighted mean diameter of 
abdominal aortic aneurysms at the time of repair was 63.7 mm in England, as compared with 
58.3 mm in the United States. After adjustment for age, sex, and endovascular versus open 
repair, there remained a significant discrepancy in the diameter of repaired aneurysms; intact 
aneurysms at the time of repair in England were a mean (±SE) of 5.3±0.3 mm larger than 
intact aneurysms at the time of repair in the United States (P<0.001) (Fig. 4, and Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

 Data from the NAAASP on aneurysm screening in England showed that smaller aneurysms 
were significantly more common than larger aneurysms (Fig. 5A). Among the first 700,000 
men enrolled (during the period from April 2009 through August 2014), 76 men per 100,000 
men screened presented with aneurysms at or above the mean diameter for repair in the 
United States (58.6 mm), as compared with 48 men per 100,000 who presented with 
aneurysms at or above the mean diameter for repair in England (64.1 mm).
The application of U.S. thresholds for aneurysm repair to the proportion of aneurysms at 
each screened diameter in the NAAASP would result in a left shift of the probability 
distribution for aneurysm repair in England (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Among men with aneurysms larger than 50 mm in diameter, the application of U.S. 
probabilities for aneurysm repair at a given aortic diameter to aneurysm prevalence rates 
according to the diameter derived from the screening program in England results in an 
expected probability of aneurysm repair in England that would be equivalent to the 
distribution of repair at a given aortic diameter in the United States (P = 0.17 by the 
Kruskal–Wallis test) (Fig. 5B).
DISCUSSION
This study showed that among patients with intact (nonruptured) abdominal aortic 
aneurysms, the rate of repair over an 8-year period was half as high in England as in the 
United States. Other data (from two different years) indicated that there was also a 
difference between the two countries in the mean aneurysm diameter at the time of repair, 
with an adjusted difference of 5.3 mm. National screening data for England suggest that 
these two observations may be related, because the prevalence of aneurysms at the mean 
diameter for repair in the United States was almost twice as high as the prevalence of 
aneurysms at the mean diameter for repair in England. In addition, we found that 
endovascular repair was used less frequently in England than in the United States, and 
endovascular repairs were performed at lower aneurysm diameters (in both countries) than 
open repair.
Among patients who were selected for aneurysm repair, in-hospital mortality and the rates of 
3-year survival were similar in England and the United States. This finding suggests that the 
increased rate of aneurysm repair in the United States did not come at the expense of greater 
perioperative or postoperative risk. However, two observations from our data suggest that the 
lower rate of aneurysm repair in England may have adverse consequences. Although the rate 
of hospitalization due to aneurysm rupture decreased in both countries over the 8 years 
studied, this rate was more than twice as high in England as in the United States. In addition, 
although aneurysm-related mortality also decreased over time in both countries, this rate was 
3.5 times as high in England as in the United States.
The rates of aneurysm repair and of aneurysm-related death were derived from separate data 
sets in both countries, and we have not shown a causal association between the two. 
Nonetheless, these observations, based on the same time period, suggest the possibility of a 
causal relationship and raise the question of whether outcomes in England would be 
improved if the repair thresholds used in the United States were adopted.

 Previous clinical trials have suggested that survival among patients with aneurysms smaller 
than 55 mm in diameter was the same regardless of whether they underwent immediate 
repair or imaging surveillance and delayed repair.10–13 However, all these trials began 
recruitment at least a decade ago, and clinical practice has changed considerably since 
then.8,14–17 It has been suggested that the size threshold for aneurysm repair should be 
revisited,18 and this presumably would require new clinical trials.
The current study was limited by the available national data sets in England and the United 
States. Aneurysm diameters were analyzed at different time windows in England (2014) and 
the United States (2013) because of the availability of data. Information regarding cause of 
death was extracted from governmental population-weighted data sets (from the CDC and 
the Office of National Statistics), which potentially precluded complete case ascertainment 
of all deaths within 30 days after aneurysm surgery or deaths as a result of reinterventions 
for repair of aneurysms within the definition of “aneurysm-related mortality.” Autopsy rates 
are low in both the United States and England, so it is difficult to definitively confirm 
government data on mortality due to aneurysm rupture. The contemporary diameter-specific 
prevalence of repair was available only for male patients through national screening 
initiatives; this precluded modeling of the potential effect of threshold changes on the 
prevalence of repair among women.
Although analyses were adjusted for age, the age distribution at the time of repair in the 
United States showed a left shift as compared with the distribution in England; this also 
reflects the lower diameter at the time of repair in patients in the United States (Fig. S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). However, the age discrepancy was not large enough to 
explain the observed differences in the rates of aneurysm repair, aneurysm rupture, and 
death. Screening data suggest that the prevalence of aneurysms is similar in England and the 
United States, so it is unlikely that differences in the underlying prevalence of disease 
influenced the results of this study. The estimated prevalence of aneurysms larger than 30 
mm in diameter is 1.4% among 3.1 million patients between 50 and 84 years of age in the 
United States,19 as compared with 1.3% according to contemporaneous NAAASP data on 
patients in England.
In conclusion, we compared data on abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in England with those 
data in the United States. In the United States, rates of aneurysm repair were twice as high as 
those in England over the period studied, and aneurysm repair was performed at a lower 
mean aneurysm diameter. Rates of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related death were 
significantly higher in England than in the United States.

 Figure 5. Diameter of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms and Number of Repairs in England and the 
United States
Panel A shows a frequency histogram and probability density function distribution for the 
diameter of abdominal aortic aneurysms among the first 700,000 men screened in England. 
This screening occurred between April 2009 and August 2014. A total of 48 men per 
100,000 men screened had aneurysms at or above the mean diameter for aneurysm repair in 
England, as compared with 76 men per 100,000 screened who had aneurysms at or above 
the mean diameter for aneurysm repair in the United States. Panel B shows the standardized 
numbers of repairs of abdominal aortic aneurysms in the United States as compared with the 
expected numbers of repairs of abdominal aortic aneurysms in England. The results are 
shown after application of the U.S. probability density for repair at various aortic diameters 
to the prevalence data for abdominal aortic aneurysms in England at each diameter in the 
U.K. national screening program. Data on patients in England are from the National Health 
Service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, and data on patients in the 
United States are from the NSQIP.
