Abstract
Aim: To synthesize evidence on the use of social media in nursing and midwifery
education.
Background: Social media is one type of online platform that is being explored to
determine if there is value in using interactive, digital communication tools to sup-
port how nurses and midwives learn in a variety of settings.
Design: A sequential explanatory synthesis approach will be used for this mixed
study review.
Method: Five bibliographic databases; PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and
ERIC will be searched using a combination of keywords relevant to social net-
working and social media, nursing and midwifery, and education. The search will
not be limited by year of publication. Titles, abstracts, and full papers will be
screened by two independent reviewers against inclusion and exclusion criteria,
with any disagreements resolved via a third reviewer. Selected studies will
undergo quality assessment and data extraction. Data synthesis will occur in
three sequential phases, with quantitative and qualitative data analysed sepa-
rately and then integrated where possible to provide a conceptual framework
illustrating learning via social media. Funding for this review was confirmed in
May 2016 by Sigma Theta Tau International and the National League for Nurs-
ing.
Discussion: The mixed study systematic review will produce the first rigorous syn-
thesis on the use of social media in nursing and midwifery education and will have
important implications for educators as well as students. It will also highlight knowl-
edge gaps and make recommendations on the use of this novel technology in higher
and continuing education.

INTRODUCTION
Nursing and midwifery education has undergone dramatic changes in
the last few decades with both professions transitioning from infor-
mal training approaches in clinical settings to a more formal qualifica-
tion gained through baccalaureate education and supervision in
clinical practice (American Association of Colleges of Nursing 1999;
Bourgeault, 2000; Zabalegui et al., 2006). A subsequent evolution in
the nursing and midwifery professions is the rise of information and
communication technology (ICT) in education. The growing adoption
of ICT has generated new opportunities for educators towards how
students are taught and assessed. eLearning has become common-
place as a means to convey educational material and activities, assist
students in accessing additional resources and enabling them to
undergo elements of assessment via digital means (Moule, Ward, &
Lockyer, 2010). Desktop computers and more recently mobile
devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, are being used
to facilitate elements of eLearning and enable students access a vari-
ety of educational information to support their learning needs in a
range of academic, clinical, and community environments (Andrews
& Cole, 2015; O’Connor & Andrews, 2015). However, technology
used in isolation does not guarantee learning and a pedagogical
approach is needed to support the electronic mode of education
delivery to ensure students achieve successful outcomes (Button,
Harrington, & Belan, 2014).
1.1

Background
Social networking applications are one type of popular online plat-
form that have begun to gain popularity amongst nurses and mid-
wives in the last few years (Lau, 2011; Levati, 2014). Boyd and
Ellison define social network sites (SNSs) as any web-based applica-
tion that enables people to create virtual profiles within a “bounded
system” as a means to connect and communicate with users on this
platform, which is freely available for others to view and interact
with (Boyd & Ellison, 2007, p. 211). Current examples of popular
SNSs include applications like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The
term “social media” has evolved during this period, as a neologism
used to refer to various aspects related to the creation, sharing, and
exchange of user-generated content, such as text, images, audio, and
video, on a variety of online platforms, including SNSs. Subsequently,
the term social media has come to refer to both a range of Internet
technologies (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and also the culture of commu-
nicating and sharing afforded by these sorts of online tools (Fraser,
Booth, Tietze, & McBride, 2015).
SNSs are an important type of social media, as they allow users
to share and interact with others in seamless and rapid fashions. For
instance, most SNSs allow people to generate distinct user profiles,
whereby users can create a range of identification markers (e.g.
name, location), avatar images, and other personalization compo-
nents. SNSs also provide users the ability to generate interactive
content that can be shared, manipulated, and exchanged by other
users. Images, videos, comments, and other types of media can be
created and shared in SNSs, generating (at times) an almost real-
time, digital environment where communication can occur (Fuchs,
2013). Given the high level of engagement potential offered by most
SNSs, they are commonly more dynamic and interactive than other
types of social media technology. For instance, other online plat-
forms such as blogs, wikis, podcasts, and webcasts can also be con-
sidered a form of social media. Regardless, the level of dynamic
interaction and real-time engagement afforded by these types of
social media are highly attenuated in comparison to SNSs. Given the
broad and sweeping definition of social media, for the purposes of
this review we will use the term social media to refer to an online,
virtual network in a publicly accessible environment. Specifically,
social media that fit the SNS complexion will be targeted for explo-
ration.
To date, numerous descriptive articles have been published out-
lining a large array of social media technology and educational prac-
tices in relation to nursing and midwifery (Ashton, 2016; Clifton &
Mann, 2011; Schmitt, Sims-Giddens, & Booth, 2012; Stewart, Side-
botham, & Davis, 2012), including more robust studies examining the
use of social media in this literature (Booth, 2015; Kitching, Winbolt,
MacPhail, & Ibrahim, 2015; Richardson, Grose, Nelmes, Parra, &
Linares, 2016; Uppal, Davies, Nuttall, & Knowles, 2016). There has
also been some past review efforts completed to synthesize how
social media technology has been used to support mentorship activi-
ties between nursing faculty (Bassell, 2010); for health professional
education in university settings (Smith & Lambert, 2014); and, in
nursing education in general (Arrigoni, Alvaro, Vellone, & Vanzetta,
2016). Regardless, there is a current and sizable gap in synthesis of
research exploring the efficacy, impact or value of social media in
nursing and midwifery education. The synthesis efforts to date have
typically adopted a sweeping, generalized definition of social media
that includes all ranges of technologies, from wikis, to blogs, SNSs,
podcasts, and other related online platforms (Bassell, 2010). Other
reviews have limited studies relevant to nursing or midwifery (Smith
& Lambert, 2014) or have applied weak methodological approaches
(Arrigoni et al., 2016). Due to the uniqueness and higher level of
communication fidelity afforded by SNSs, it was deemed important
Why this study or review is needed?
• Numerous technology enhanced learning platforms exist
but social media has unique properties that set it apart
from other eLearning applications.
• Nursing and midwifery education programs are beginning
to use social media in various ways to engage students
and deliver teaching and assessment.
• This mixed study systematic review will synthesize the
literature on how valuable social media is for learning
among nursing and midwifery students and the perspec-
tives of key stakeholders towards this new pedagogical
approach.

 to generate a mixed study systematic review exploring the use of
this particular form of social media in nursing and midwifery educa-
tion. By conducting this review, it is hoped that the findings will pro-
vide useful evidence for educators towards the potential of social
media like SNSs in nursing and midwifery education. Given the pro-
liferation of these types of online platforms over the last few years,
a systematic review on the use of social media in nursing and mid-
wifery education is both timely and a needed addition in the litera-
ture to support future education, practice, and policy.

THE REVIEW
2.1
|
Aims
The aim of this mixed study systematic review is to synthesize the
relevant literature on social media in nursing and midwifery educa-
tion to enhance the evidence base for using the technology in this
setting. The review will highlight knowledge gaps and provide rec-
ommendations on how to improve the use of social media in nursing
and midwifery education.
2.1.1
|
Review questions
• What is the effect of social media applications on learning among
nursing and midwifery students?
• What are the perspectives of nursing and midwifery faculty, stu-
dents and practice staff towards using social media for this purpose?
2.2
|
Design
A multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise ranging from
nursing, to education, health informatics and information systems are
involved in the design and conduct of the systematic review. A
sequential explanatory design will be employed for this mixed study
review (Pluye & Hong, 2014), with the corresponding workflow out-
lined in Figure 1. The Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analysis Protocols guideline was followed when writing
this protocol (Appendix S1) (Moher et al., 2015).
2.2.1
|
Search strategy
A scoping search will be carried out to help identify key papers and
search terms relevant to the three concepts in the review i.e. social
media, nursing and midwifery, and education. This preliminary search
will be undertaken via several online bibliographical databases
accessed through Ovid to inform the design of the search strategy.
This will be piloted in PubMed and refined for each research database
used. A combination of free text keywords and Medical Subject Head-
ing (MeSH) terms will be used where appropriate. These will include
some of the following terms; “nurs*” OR “midwi*” AND “student” OR
“educat*” AND “social media” OR “social network*” OR “Facebook”
OR “Twitter” (Table 1). As the number and type of social media
platforms being used rises continuously, we will limit the search terms
to the top most frequently used English language SNS applications
and those that are directly relevant to health care or education. The
following five online databases; PubMed Central, MEDLINE (Ovid),
CINAHL (EBSCHOHost), Scopus, and ERIC will be systematically
searched to identify published peer-reviewed scientific literature that
is relevant to the research questions. The results will be downloaded
to Mendeley, where duplicate citations will be removed and exported
to Microsoft Excel to facilitate screening and data management. Addi-
tional techniques such as reference and citation tracking will be used
to address the limitations of traditional database searching.
2.2.2
|
Eligibility criteria
The review will adhere to the following eligibility criteria that were
developed using the PICO framework i.e. population, intervention,
control, outcome (Cullum, Ciliska, Haynes, & Marks, 2013). Papers
will be included if they correspond with the following PICO criteria:
• Population will include nurses or midwives at any stage of educa-
tion i.e. undergraduate, postgraduate, or continuing professional
development. Where mixed health professional populations are
used nurses or midwives must be a clearly identifiable group.
• Interventions will include social media platforms (SNS based) used as
educational tools. Where blended eLearning interventions are used
the social media (SNS based) component must be clearly discernible.
• No comparison will be used.
• Outcomes will include: changes in knowledge and skills related to
professional
practice
or
personal
development,
which
could
include health, nursing or other expertise and clinical, interper-
sonal or cognitive skills among others; Perspectives of educators,
students, and practice staff towards this pedagogical approach,
which could include measures of student satisfaction with the
technology or their level of engagement with it or other findings
related to learning via social media.
All types of study designs will be included, such as any kind of
quantitative (descriptive, correlational, quasi-experimental or experi-
mental), qualitative (case study, ethnography, grounded theory, nar-
rative, phenomenology, or descriptive), or mixed methods design.
Due to the relativeness newness of the research topic, a specific
date range for publications will not be imposed. Only English lan-
guage peer-reviewed publications which undertake primary research
will be included, while any type of commentary, editorial or opinion
piece, thesis, conference proceeding, grey literature or a purely
descriptive or review article will be excluded.
2.2.3
|
Screening
The first phase of screening will be undertaken independently by
two reviewers. During this phase, the reviewers will individually
examine the article titles to assess their relevancy to the review
topic. Those articles which meet the review criteria will be included

 in the next round of screening. After this initial round of screening, a
pair of independent reviewers will examine the abstract of each
remaining article. Finally, the full text of all journal articles resulting
from the two previous rounds of screening will be obtained and
assessed independently by two reviewers. A third member of the
research team will be involved to resolve any conflicts that occur in
determining the relevance of the titles, abstracts, and full text
papers, so that a consensus will be reached whether to include or
exclude a study. The PRISMA guidelines will be followed to create a
flow diagram that will report the article selection process and rea-
sons for exclusion from the review (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Alt-
man, 2009).
2.3

Quality appraisal
It is recommended to critically appraise research studies in system-
atic reviews as a mechanism to assess whether each individual study
adequately addresses the different dimensions of research quality.
Furthermore, using this form of quality appraisal process can also
give an indication of the contribution of the paper to the overall
review (Popay, Rogers, & Williams, 1998). Due to the likelihood that
the included studies will be a mixture of designs, the Mixed Methods
Appraisal Tool (MMAT) will be used to undertake quality assessment
(Pluye, Gagnon, Griffiths, & Johnson-Lafleur, 2009). MMAT enables
the appraisal of several methodological criteria from quantitative,
qualitative, and mixed methods studies, including how suitable the
design is to answer the research aims, risk of bias, appropriateness
of outcome measures, quality of reporting, and the generalizability of
results (Souto et al., 2015). Two reviewers will independently assess
the quality of the included studies and any conflicts resolved
through group discussion. If necessary an independent third reviewer
will be contacted to settle any unresolved disagreements. No study
will be excluded based on the results of the quality assessment, as
methodologically weak studies may still offer valuable insights into
the use of social media in nursing and midwifery education (Barnett-
Page & Thomas, 2009).
2.3.1

Data extraction
Standardized data extraction templates will be designed in Excel and
will be based on the specific characteristics of the papers in the
review. They will be piloted and refined using a subset of articles.
Bibliographic information (authors, country, journal name, year, vol-
ume), study characteristics (theoretical framework, study design,
ethics), participant characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, type of stu-
dent, or learner), intervention characteristics (type of social media
application, educational setting, frequency, duration) and the main
findings from the results and discussion sections related to the
review questions will be extracted. Two independent reviewers will
extract data based on the relevant articles identified through the
screening process. A third reviewer will be involved where disagree-
ments arise over the relevancy of the data to the review topic.
Tables of the characteristics of the included studies will be pre-
sented to provide an overview of the quantitative, qualitative and
mixed methods papers in the review.
2.3.2
|
Synthesis
Data synthesis will follow a sequential explanatory approach for
mixed study reviews (Pluye & Hong, 2014). It will be conducted by
the primary author and discussed at regular intervals with the
review team to ensure consistency in interpretation and reporting.
The first phase will present and compare findings of quantitative
studies or mixed methods studies with quantitative data in a
pooled evidence table, to help determine the effectiveness of social
media in improving student learning. Meta-analysis will be used,
where appropriate, to increase the power and precision of the
reported interventions effects or examine their differences (Egger,
Davey-Smith, & Altman, 2001). However, it is anticipated that there
will be significant variability in terms of the characteristics of stu-
dents and the types of social media applications, educational set-
tings, and outcomes used. For studies that are not appropriate for
statistical analysis a narrative summary will be undertaken to
explore the relationship and findings both within and between the
studies to demonstrate how social media can affect student learn-
ing (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2008; Mays, Pope, &
Popay, 2005).
The
second
phase
of
synthesis
will
apply
the
framework
approach to combine the qualitative results from both qualitative
and mixed method studies (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). The narrative
summary from phase one will be used to form the initial coding
framework that will be applied to the dataset. The analytic process
outlined in Figure 2 will be followed to code and categorize data
into a comprehensive matrix of cases and themes, exploring the per-
spectives of different stakeholders towards using social media to aid
learning. This will enable the review team to move back and forth

 across the data, reflecting on the analysis and interpretation and
developing associations and patterns in concepts and themes, until a
coherent explanatory account emerges. Finally, the results from
phase one and two syntheses will be integrated to construct a con-
ceptual framework that illustrates learning via social media. The pre-
vious analyses will be interpreted, theorized, reflected on, and
reviewed to organize the results into a meaningful synthesis that
details the aspects of social media that affect student learning.

(ENTREQ) statement (Tong, Flemming, McInnes, Oliver, & Craig,
2012) will be followed when reporting the results of the mixed study

DISCUSSION
Although systematic reviews on eLearning in nursing and health
professional education have been conducted (Childs, Blenkinsopp,
Hall, & Walton, 2005; Lahti, H€
at€
onen, & V€
alim€
aki, 2014), we feel
social media is a special type of online platform with unique prop-
erties and as such a review of its specific uses in nursing and mid-
wifery education is warranted. As a relatively new technological
platform, social media has significant potential in nursing and mid-
wifery education to give students a more interactive and student
led
environment
within
which
to
create,
share,
and
consume
educational content and resources for learning. It could also assist
educators to assess student knowledge and skills on a range of
topics. This study will be the first to systematically review the lit-
erature on social media in nursing and midwifery education. The
review will be beneficial to educators as it will summarize the evi-
dence on what types of social media platforms are currently being
used and if there is a link between this technology and learning,
as similar reviews have done in other educational fields (Cheston,
Flickinger, & Chisolm, 2013). Finally, the review will highlight how
student nurses and midwives are interacting on social media to
learn and what kinds of teaching material are being developed and
digested in this new pedagogical environment. Several specifics
gaps in evidence may be identified and areas for further research
suggested.
The results of this mixed study systematic review will be widely
disseminated through several channels. It will be published in a peer
reviewed academic journal and the findings presented at national
and international nursing and midwifery education conferences. The
results of the review will also be disseminated at research and teach-
ing seminars at each of the author’s institutions in the UK, Canada,
and the USA, enabling a wide reach to numerous international edu-
cator and student audiences. It is also expected that the outcomes
of the review will be publicised via several social media outlets. This
work will help inform a future agenda for nursing and midwifery
educational research, policy, and practice.
