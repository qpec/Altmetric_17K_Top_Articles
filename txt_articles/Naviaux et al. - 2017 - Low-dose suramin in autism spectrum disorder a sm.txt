Abstract
Objective: No drug is yet approved to treat the core symptoms of autism spec-
trum disorder (ASD). Low-dose suramin was effective in the maternal immune
activation and Fragile X mouse models of ASD. The Suramin Autism Treat-
ment-1 (SAT-1) trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, translational pilot
study to examine the safety and activity of low-dose suramin in children with
ASD. Methods: Ten male subjects with ASD, ages 5–14 years, were matched by
age, IQ, and autism severity into five pairs, then randomized to receive a single,
intravenous infusion of suramin (20 mg/kg) or saline. The primary outcomes
were ADOS-2 comparison scores and Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary
Test (EOWPVT). Secondary outcomes were the aberrant behavior checklist,
autism treatment evaluation checklist, repetitive behavior questionnaire, and
clinical global impression questionnaire. Results: Blood levels of suramin were
12 � 1.5 lmol/L (mean � SD) at 2 days and 1.5 � 0.5 lmol/L after 6 weeks.
The terminal half-life was 14.7 � 0.7 days. A self-limited, asymptomatic rash
was seen, but there were no serious adverse events. ADOS-2 comparison scores
improved by �1.6 � 0.55 points (n = 5; 95% CI =
�2.3 to �0.9; Cohen’s
d = 2.9; P = 0.0028) in the suramin group and did not change in the placebo
group. EOWPVT scores did not change. Secondary outcomes also showed
improvements in language, social interaction, and decreased restricted or repeti-
tive behaviors. Interpretation: The safety and activity of low-dose suramin
showed promise as a novel approach to treatment of ASD in this small study.

Introduction
Autism affects 1–2% of children in the United States.1,2
Dozens of single genes and chromosomal copy number
variants (CNVs)3 increase the relative risk of autism spec-
trum disorder (ASD) nearly 5–50 times over the current
background risk. Yet no single gene or CNV causes ASD
in 100% of children who carry the mutation,4 and no sin-
gle DNA mutation accounts for more than 1–2% of all
ASD.5 Specific environmental factors have also been
shown to increase the risk of ASD.6,7 However, no single
child has all of the known genetic risk factors for ASD, or
is exposed to all the same environmental risks. Although
the noncore symptoms of ASD are highly heterogeneous
from child to child, making each child unique, the same
core features used for diagnosis – abnormalities in social
communication, restricted interests, repetitive behaviors,
adherence to routine, and/or atypical sensory behaviors –
are by definition expressed in every child. One approach
to addressing the challenge of many etiologies of ASD is
to define a common pathophysiology that can contribute
to the core diagnostic symptoms, regardless of the initiat-
ing genetic and environmental triggers. We hypothesized
that there is a conserved cellular response to metabolic
perturbation or danger that is shared by all children with
ASD. This is called the cell danger hypothesis.8 Aspects of
the cell danger response (CDR) are also referred to as the
integrated stress response.9–11 Preclinical studies showed
that the cell danger response in mice produced a treatable
metabolic syndrome that was maintained by purinergic
signaling. Antipurinergic therapy with suramin corrected
both the behavioral and metabolic features of these
genetic and environmental mouse models of ASD.12–14
The formulation of the cell danger hypothesis was based
on the recognition that similar metabolic pathways were
coordinately regulated as an adaptive response to cellular
threat regardless of whether the perturbation was caused
by a virus,15 a bacterium,16 genetic forms of mitochondrial
disease,10 or neurodevelopmental disorders with complex
gene–environment pathogenic mechanisms like autism.17
These metabolic pathways traced to mitochondria. Mito-
chondria are responsible for initiating and coordinating
innate immunity18 and produce stereotyped changes in
oxidative metabolism under stress19 that lead to the
regulated release of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides like
ATP and UTP through cell membrane channels.20 Inside
the cell, ATP is an energy carrier. Outside the cell, extracel-
lular ATP (eATP) is a multifunctional signaling molecule,
a potent immune modulator,21 and a damage-associated
molecular pattern (DAMP) that can activate microglia,
and trigger IL-1b production and inflammasome assem-
bly.22 Extracellular purines like ATP, ADP, and adenosine,
and pyrimidines like UTP are ligands for 19 different
purinergic (P2X, P2Y, and P1) receptors.23 The intracellu-
lar concentration of ATP (iATP) in mammalian cells is
typically 1–5 mmol/L,24 but drops when ATP is released
through membrane channels under stress. Typical concen-
trations
of
extracellular
adenine
nucleotides
in
the
unstirred water layer at the cell surface where receptors
and ligands meet are about 1–10 lmol/L, near the effective
concentration for most purinergic receptors,25 but can
increase when ATP is released during cell stress. Concen-
trations of eATP in the blood are another 500 times lower
(10–20 nmol/L).26 Purinergic effectors like ATP are also
coreleased with canonical neurotransmitters like glutamate,
dopamine, and serotonin during depolarization at every
synapse in which they have been studied23 and play key
roles in activity-dependent synaptic remodeling.27 These
and other features28–30 led us to test the hypothesis that
the CDR8 was maintained by purinergic signaling.12–14
Suramin has many actions. One of its best-studied
actions is as an inhibitor of purinergic signaling. It is the
oldest member of a growing class of antipurinergic drugs
(APDs) in development.31 Suramin was first synthesized in
1916,32 making it one of the oldest manmade drugs still in
medical use. It is used to treat African sleeping sickness
(trypanosomiasis), and remains on the World Health
Organization list of essential medications. Concerns about
the toxicity of high-dose suramin arose when the cumula-
tive antitrypanosomal dose was increased 5 times or more
over several months to treat AIDS or kill cancer cells dur-
ing chemotherapy. When blood levels were maintained
over 150 lmol/L for 3–6 months at a time to treat cancer,
a number of dose-limiting side effects were described.32
These included adrenal insufficiency, anemia, and periph-
eral neuropathy. In contrast, mouse studies suggested that
high-dose suramin was not necessary to treat autism-like
symptoms. These studies showed that low-dose suramin

 that produced blood levels of about 5–10 lM was effective
in treating ASD-like symptoms and did not produce toxic-
ity even when used for at least 4 months.12,14
Here, we report the findings of the Suramin Autism
Treatment-1 (SAT-1) trial, the first direct test of suramin,
the cell danger hypothesis, and the relevance of abnormal
purinergic signaling in children with ASD. These data help
form the foundation for future studies that will test the
safety and efficacy of suramin, provide fresh directions for
the development of new antipurinergic drugs, and add sup-
port to the hypothesis that a potentially treatable metabolic
syndrome may contribute to the pathogenesis of autism.
Materials and Methods
Study design and participants
The SAT-1 trial was an investigator-initiated, phase I/II,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial
to examine the safety and activity of single-dose suramin or
placebo in 10 children with autism spectrum disorders
(ASD). All children met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for aut-
ism spectrum disorder, and received confirmatory testing by
Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule, 2nd edition
(ADOS-2) examination. Inclusion criteria were male sub-
jects, ages 4–17 years, living in the San Diego, California
region, with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Exclusion crite-
ria included children who weighed less than the 5th per-
centile for age, took prescription medications, or had
laboratory evidence of liver, kidney, heart, or adrenal abnor-
malities. Children living more than a 90-min drive from the
testing sites in La Jolla, CA were excluded to eliminate the
possibility of aberrant behaviors resulting from extended car
travel. Children with known syndromic forms of ASD
caused by DNA mutation or chromosomal copy number
variation (CNV) were excluded in this first study. Families
were asked not to change their children’s therapy (e.g., sup-
plements, speech, and behavioral therapies) or diet through-
out the study period. The study was conducted between 27
May 2015 (date of the first child to be enrolled) and 3 March
2016 (date of the last child to complete the study).
Regulatory approvals, registration,
CONSORT, and informed consent
The research plan, clinical trial protocol, informed con-
sents, advertising, and amendments were approved by the
University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Institutional
Review Board (IRB Project #150134) before implementa-
tion. The study was authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (IND#118212), and conformed to the
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki–Ethical
Principles
for
Medical
Research
Involving
Human
Subjects,33 and the International Council for Harmoniza-
tion (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.
The trial was registered with clinical trials.gov (https://clini
caltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02508259).
Reporting
of
the
SAT-1 trial conformed to CONSORT 2010 guidelines.34
Signed informed consent, with additional consent for video
and still image photography, were obtained from the par-
ents of all participants before enrollment and randomiza-
tion. Storyboards and social stories were created to review
with parents, help children visualize and prepare for the
study, and create the opportunity to ask questions (Fig-
ure S1, Data S2).
Randomization and masking
Twenty male subjects with ASD were screened. Sixteen met
entry criteria. Ten participants could be matched by age,
nonverbal IQ, and ADOS scores into five pairs. The ran-
domization sequence was generated electronically by the
biostatistical team. Subjects within each pair were allocated
to receive suramin or saline according to the prospectively
determined randomization sequence. The randomization
sequence was concealed from the clinical team and imple-
mented by the UCSD investigational pharmacy, which pre-
pared drug and placebo for infusion. The design was
double blind. The mask was not broken until all subjects
had completed the study and all clinical data had been
collected.
Diagnostic and outcome procedures
The diagnosis of each of the enrolled participants was con-
firmed by ADOS-235 comparison scores of ≥7. Nonverbal IQ
was tested by Leiter-3 examination.36 The primary behavioral
outcomes were ADOS scores and language assessed by stan-
dardized vocabulary testing. Expressive vocabulary was assessed
by
Expressive
One-Word
Picture
Vocabulary
Test
(EOWPVT).37 Primary outcomes were measured at baseline,
and 2 days and 6 weeks after infusion. Secondary outcomes
were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC),38 Autism Treat-
ment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC),39,40 Clinical Global Impres-
sion of Improvement (CGI)41 (Data S1), and Repetitive
Behavior Questionnaire (RBQ).42 Secondary outcomes were
measured at baseline, and 7 days and 6 weeks after infusion.
Protocol deviations
The original protocol was designed to collect electroen-
cephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), bal-
ance, gait, fine
motor, and sensory
motor
data as
secondary outcomes. However, the wide range in ages
and abilities, small subject numbers, and task compliance
difficulties made collection of these data incomplete and

 insufficiently powered to draw any conclusions. In addi-
tion, we found that major language advances were in the
form of new speech fluency and new interest in speech
and social communication, and not in new vocabulary.
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Testing (PPVT) did not cap-
ture this new interest in communication. These data were
incomplete and insufficiently powered for analysis.
Drug and placebo administration
Suramin was provided as the hexasodium salt (MW
1429.2 g/mol) in 1 g lyophilized vials by Bayer Pharma AG
(Leverkusen,
Germany),
under
Dr.
Naviaux’s
IND
#118212. Lot #BXNOGW1, expiration date of 3 September
2018, was used in these studies. A 1 g vial was reconstituted
in 10 mL of sterile water for infusion to prepare a 10%
(100 mg/mL) solution. All infusions were conducted at the
University of California, San Diego School of Medicine
Clinical and Translational Research Institute (CTRI) in La
Jolla, CA. Height and weight were recorded, vital signs and
capillary oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) measured,
physical and neurological examinations were conducted,
and urine and blood for safety monitoring, pharmacology,
and metabolomics were collected before the infusion. Each
child then received a 50 mg test dose (0.5 mL of a freshly
reconstituted 10% solution) of suramin in 5 mL of saline,
or 5 mL of saline only given by slow intravenous (IV) push
over 3 min, followed by a 10-mL flush of saline. One hour
after the test dose, vital signs were repeated and a single
infusion of either suramin (20 mg/kg, minus the 50 mg test
dose, in 50 mL, up to a maximum of 1 g) or saline (50 mL
IV) was given over 30 min, followed by a 10-mL flush of
saline. One hour after completion of the infusion, vital
signs and the physical and neurological examinations were
repeated, blood was collected for safety monitoring and
pharmacology, and the family discharged to home. A typi-
cal infusion visit to the Clinical Translational Research
Institute (CTRI) lasted about 4 h from start to finish.
Safety and adverse event monitoring
Blood and urine samples were collected for safety and
toxicity monitoring at 5 times throughout the study: at
baseline (32 � 6 days before the infusion; mean � SEM),

 immediately before the infusion, 1 h after the infusion,
2 days after, and 45 days after the infusion. Unexpected
and adverse events were recorded as they occurred and
graded in severity according to the National Cancer Insti-
tute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
v4.03 (CTCAE) scale. Additional pharmacovigilence mon-
itoring included daily scripted phone calls in the first
week, then 4 weekly calls until the exit examinations at
6 weeks. Each child received a formal neurological exami-
nation by a board-certified pediatric neurologist at base-
line and at the end of the study. An independent data
safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed the data and
IRB communications for the study.
Pharmacokinetics
Plasma samples were collected for suramin pharmacoki-
netics (PK) before the infusion, at 1 h, 2 days, and
45 days postinfusion. Suramin concentrations were mea-
sured by high-performance liquid chromatography and
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described pre-
viously.13 See Supplemental Methods for details. The
small number of PK samples per subject prevented a stan-
dard, noncompartmental analysis in individual subjects.
The suramin drug concentrations were analyzed using a
population PK approach with post hoc empiric Bayesian
estimate of PK parameters in individual subjects. The PK
data were fit to a two-compartment model using the com-
puter program NONMEM (ICON, Dublin, Ireland).43 PK
parameters were scaled allometrically with volume terms
scaled to linear body weight (kg1.0) and clearance terms
scaled to weight (kg0.75). Scaled adult suramin parameters
of compartmental volumes of distribution and clearance
were used as initial parameter estimates and between sub-
ject variability only estimated for clearance (CL) and the
peripheral volume of distribution (Vd).
Pharmacometabolomics
Targeted, broad-spectrum, plasma metabolomic analysis,
covering 63 biochemical pathways, was performed by LC-
MS/MS as described previously44 with minor modifications.
In all, 431 of 610 targeted metabolites were measureable in
plasma. See Supplemental Methods for details.

The Suramin Autism Treatment-1 Trial
 Sample size calculation and statistical
analysis
This was a pilot study designed to obtain activity data
and effect size estimates upon which future sample size
calculations could be based. No data on suramin in aut-
ism were available for sample size calculations prior to
this study. Each child was used as his own control to
examine before and after treatment effects in a paired
t-test design for the analysis of the ADOS, EOWPVT,
ABC, ATEC, RBQ, and blood and urine safety data.
Paired, nonparametric analysis was done by Wilcoxon
signed-rank sum test. Categorical data, such as the pres-
ence or absence of adverse events or historical symptoms,
was analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. Two-way ANOVA
(treatment 9 time), with Sidak post hoc correction, was
used to analyze the 6-week summaries captured by the
ADOS, CGI, and blood and urine safety analysis. Cohen’s
d – calculated as the mean difference of the paired,
within-subject scores before and after treatment, divided
by the standard deviation of the differences – was used as
an estimate of effect size. Metabolomic data were log-
transformed, scaled by control standard deviations, and
analyzed by multivariate partial least squares discriminant
analysis (PLSDA), with pairwise comparisons and post
hoc correction for multiple hypothesis testing using Fish-
er’s least significant difference method in MetaboAna-
lyst,45 or the false discovery rate (FDR) method of
Benjamini
and
Hochberg.
Metabolites
with
variable
importance in projection (VIP) scores determined by
PLSDA that were greater than 1.5 were considered signifi-
cant. Methods were implemented in Stata (Stata/SE12.1,
StataCorp, College Station, TX), Prism (Prism 6, Graph-
Pad Software, La Jolla, CA), or R. Significant metabolites
were
grouped
into
pathways
and
their
VIP
scores
summed to determine the rank-ordered significance of
each biochemical pathway.

of AEs per participant was 1.9 (1.2 in the placebo group
and 2.6 in the suramin group; 1.6 in the suramin group
for a nonrash AE; RR = 1.3; 95% CI = 0.5–3.4; P = 0.77;
Table 2). No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in
this study. An independent data and safety monitoring
board (DSMB) reviewed this information, as well as the
clinical safety and toxicity data and IRB communications
from the study, and found no safety concerns.
Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at 1 h after intra-
venous
infusion
of
20 mg/kg
(558 � 41 mg/m2;
mean � SD; Table S1), the suramin concentration was
104 � 11.6 lmol/L
(Fig. 3A).
The
distribution
phase
half-life was 7.4 � 0.55 h. The suramin levels rapidly fell
below 100 lmol/L and into the target range before day
2 in all subjects, with an average plasma level of sura-
min of 12.0 � 1.5 lmol/L on day 2 (Fig. 3B, Table S1).
Target concentrations of 1.5–15 lmol/L were maintained
between 2 days and 6 weeks following the dose (Fig. 3).
The
steady-state
volume
of
distribution
was
0.83 � 0.014 L/kg (22.7 � 2.6 L/m2). The clearance was
1.95 � 0.21 mL/h/kg (0.056 � 0.011 L/h/m2). The ter-
minal
elimination
phase
half-life
(t1/2)
was
14.7 � 1.4 days
(Fig. 3B,D).
A
two-compartment
PK
model showed excellent fit between measured and pre-
dicted plasma levels (r2 = 0.998; Fig. 3C). These data are
the first in the published literature on the pharmacoki-
netics of suramin in a pediatric population.

The Suramin Autism Treatment-1 Trial
 Pharmacometabolomics
Targeted plasma metabolomics was performed immedi-
ately before infusion, at 2 days, and 6 weeks after the
infusion. The rank order of the top 35 of 48 significant
metabolites 6 weeks after suramin treatment is illustrated
in Figure 4. The rank order after 2 days is illustrated in
Figure S2. Consistent with our previously published work
using mouse models, the metabolic effects of suramin
resulted in a decrease of the cell danger response8 and
restored more normal metabolism.12,13 Purine metabolism
was the single most changed pathway (Table 3, Table S2).
Suramin increased healthy purines such as AICAR, which
is an activator of the master metabolic regulator AMP-
dependent
protein
kinase
(AMPK).
1-Methyl-adenine
(1-MA) was also increased. 1-MA is derived from 1-
methyl-adenosine, a recently recognized marker of new
protein synthesis and cell growth. Suramin decreased
other purines in the plasma such as cAMP and dGDP
(Fig. 4, Tables S3 and S4). Improvements in 1-carbon,
folate, methionine, and cysteine metabolism were also
found (Table 3, and Figure S3). Figure 5 illustrates the
similarities found in the pharmacometabolomic response
to suramin in MIA13 and Fragile X mouse models12 and
in children with ASD in this study. Twenty-one of the 28
(75%) pathways changed in ASD were also changed by
suramin treatment in the mouse models of ASD (Fig. 5).
Outcomes
The primary outcome measures were ADOS-2 and Expres-
sive One-Word Picture Vocabulary (EOWPVT) scores
(Table 4). Parents reported that after suramin treatment,
the rate of language, social, behavioral, and developmental
improvements continued to increase for 3 weeks, then
gradually decreased toward baseline over the next 3 weeks.
The blood levels of suramin at 3 weeks were estimated to
be 4.2 � 0.5 lmol/L using our PK model. ADOS-2 com-
parison scores at 6 weeks improved by an average of
�1.6 � 0.55 points (mean � SD; n = 5; 95% CI = �2.3
to �0.9; Cohen’s d = 2.9; P = 0.0028) in the suramin
treatment group and did not change in the saline group.
We calculated P values by both parametric and nonpara-
metric methods (Table 4). The mean ADOS comparison
score in the suramin-treated group was 8.6 � 0.4 at base-
line and 7.0 � 0.3 at 6 weeks. Two-way ANOVA of ADOS
scores of suramin and placebo groups measured at baseline
and at 6 weeks were also significant (treatment 9

 interaction F(1, 8) = 12.0; P = 0.0085; Figure S4A). ADOS
scores were not changed in the saline-treated group
(Table 4). EOWPVT scores did not change (Table 4). Sev-
eral secondary outcome measures also showed improve-
ments. These included improvements in ABC, ATEC, and
CGI scores (Table 4). The Repetitive Behavior Question-
naire (RBQ) scores did not capture a change.
Discussion
The aim of the SAT-1 trial was to test the safety, pharma-
cokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of low-dose suramin
in children with ASD. A self-limited rash was seen, but
no
serious
adverse
events
occurred.
Pharma-
cometabolomic analysis showed that the pathways chan-
ged by suramin treatment in ASD were previously known
mediators of the cell danger response (CDR)8 and that
purine metabolism was changed most. Seventy-five per-
cent of the pathways changed by suramin in children with
ASD were also changed by suramin in mouse models.12–14
Safety
Suramin has been used safely for nearly a century to treat
both children and adults with African sleeping sickness.
Although side effects occurred occasionally, these could
be minimized by attention to patient nutritional status,
proper dose, administration procedures, and measured
blood levels of suramin.46 The low dose of suramin used
in this study produced blood levels of 1.5–15 lmol/L for
6 weeks. Previous studies have never examined the side-
effect profile of suramin in this low-dose range. The side-
effect profile of high-dose suramin (150–270 lmol/L) is
known from cancer chemotherapy studies.32 The side-
effect profile from medium-dose suramin (50–100 lmol/
L) is known from African sleeping sickness studies.46
However, the side-effect profile of low-dose suramin
(5–15 lmol/L) used for antipurinergic therapy (APT) in
autism is unknown. Low-dose suramin was found to be
safe in five children with ASD, ages 5–14 years, in this
study.

The Suramin Autism Treatment-1 Trial
R. K. Naviaux et al.
 Study limitations
Limitations of the SAT-1 study included its small size and
the suboptimal timing of the outcome measurements.
Parents reported that the rate of new behavioral and
developmental improvements continued to increase for
the first 3 weeks after the single dose of suramin, as blood
levels of suramin fell from 12 to 4 lmol/L, then gradually
decreased toward baseline over the next 3 weeks, as blood
levels fell further from 4 to 1.5 lmol/L. This pattern of
response suggested a threshold effect at about 4 lmol/L
that could not have been predicted on the basis of what
was known about suramin before this study, and out-
comes were not measured at 3 weeks.
Another potential limitation of the trial was the self-
limited rash. The rash was asymptomatic and resolved
spontaneously in a few days. In theory, the rash may have
biased parents in a way that caused them to either
improve their scores on the ABC, ATEC, RBQ, and CGI,
or to report more side-effects or adverse behaviors at
both the 7-day and 6-week reports. Examiner-based
ADOS scoring was more resistant to this potential bias,
since the rash was not visible on exposed skin to the out-
come examiners at any time. However, a design limitation
of the study was that one of the two ADOS examiners
was also assigned to conduct scripted phone interviews
with the families, and might have been susceptible to
unconscious bias even though the study remained blinded
and the rash preceded any significant examiner-based
outcomes by one and a half months.
Another potential weakness of this study was that
ADOS scoring was not designed to be, and is not typically
used as, a repeated measure of outcomes in autism treat-
ment studies. This has occurred historically for two coun-
terbalancing reasons: (1) because it is generally believed
that ADOS scores are diagnostic and are not sensitive to
change once the diagnosis is established, and (2) because
training effects have the potential to produce improve-
ments that are artifactual. With regard to the first point,
under the right circumstances ADOS scores can be sensi-
tive to change and have recently been used successfully as
an outcome measure in a large autism treatment study.47
With regard to the second point, if training effects
occurred, they were asymmetric, since improvements were
only observed in the suramin treatment group and were
not observed in the placebo group (Table 4).
Psychopharmacology
Suramin has objective central nervous system (CNS) effects
in animal models12–14 and children with autism despite
being unable to penetrate the blood–brain barrier.48 Sura-
min also has a number of peripheral effects on innate
immunity, metabolism, pain, gut, autonomic, inflamma-
tory, and other pathways regulated by purinergic signaling
that may contribute to the beneficial effects observed.8,23
Previous studies have shown that suramin is taken up into
the CNS at the level of the brainstem, although not appre-
ciably into the cerebrum or cerebellum.13 There are eight
circumventricular organs (CVOs) in the brain that contain
neurons that lack a blood–brain barrier.49 The area post-
rema in the brainstem is one of these CVOs that monitors
the chemistry of the blood and transduces this information
to higher centers in the brain for neuroendocrine, affective,
cognitive, and behavioral integration. Rather than being a
disadvantage, the peripheral actions and indirect CNS
effects of suramin may have certain advantages by mini-
mizing the risk of CNS toxicity. While new antipurinergic
drugs (APDs) may soon be developed that can pass the
blood–brain barrier, this appears not to be required to
produce the behavioral effects of suramin in ASD.
Conclusions
The SAT-1 trial examined the effects of low-dose suramin
or placebo in 10 children with autism spectrum disorder.
No safety concerns were found. A two-compartment
pharmacokinetic model permitted accurate forecasting of
plasma drug levels from 1 h to 6 weeks after the infusion.
Metabolomic studies confirmed the importance of the cell
danger response (CDR)8 and purinergic signaling.12–14 A
single intravenous dose of suramin was associated with
improved scores for language, social interaction, and
Figure 5. Shared biochemical pathways. 75% of the pathways that
were altered by suramin in children with ASD were also altered in the
mouse models. Asterisks (*) indicate pathways that were changed at
2 days, but not at 6 weeks after treatment.

ABC, ATEC, CGI, and RBQ are severity scores; negative differences from baseline reflect decreased severity, that is, improvement. EOWPVT is a performance score; negative differences reflect a
decrease.
1A positive Cohen’s d reflects improvement, and a negative d reflects a decrease by convention. Cohen’s d is likely an overestimate of the actual treatment effect based on the large mean differ-
ences and small standard deviations found before and after treatment in this small study.

The Suramin Autism Treatment-1 Trial
R. K. Naviaux et al.
 decreased restricted or repetitive behaviors measured by
ADOS, ABC, ATEC, and CGI scores. None of these
improvements occurred in the five children who received
placebo. The generalizability of these findings is unknown.
Future studies will be needed to confirm these findings in
larger numbers of children with ASD, and to evaluate
whether a few doses of suramin given over a few months
are safe and might facilitate continued improvements.
Special note from the authors
Suramin is not approved for the treatment of autism.
Like many intravenous drugs, when administered improp-
erly by untrained personnel, at the wrong dose and sched-
ule, without careful measurement of drug levels and
monitoring for toxicity, suramin can cause harm. Careful
clinical trials will be needed over several years at several
sites to learn how to use low-dose suramin safely in aut-
ism, and to identify drug–drug interactions and rare side
effects that cannot currently be predicted. We strongly
caution against the unauthorized use of suramin.
