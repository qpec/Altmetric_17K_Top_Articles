The main aim of this study was to investigate the training characteristics of the
most successful female cross-country skier ever during the best period of her career.
The participant won six gold medals at the Olympic Games, 18 gold medals at the
World Championship, and 110 World Cup victories. Day-to-day training diary data,
interviews, and physiological tests were analyzed. Training data was systemized by
training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low- (LIT), moderate- (MIT),
and high-intensity training (HIT)], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing),
followed by a division into different periodization phases. Specific sessions utilized in the
various periodization periods and the day-to-day periodization of training, in connection
with altitude camps and tapering toward major championships, were also analyzed.
Following a 12-year nonlinear increase in training load, the annual training volume during
the five consecutive successful years stabilized at 937 ± 25 h, distributed across 543 ± 9
sessions. During these 5 years, total training time was distributed as 90.6% endurance-,
8.0% strength-, and 1.4% speed-training, with endurance-training time consisting of
92.3 ± 0.3% LIT, 2.9 ± 0.5% MIT, and 4.8 ± 0.5% HIT. Total LIT-time consisted
of 21% warm-up, 14% sessions <90 min, and 65% long-duration sessions >90 min.
While the total number of LIT sessions remained stable across phases (32 sessions),
total LIT-time was reduced from GP (76 h/month) to SP (68 h/month) and CP (55
h/month). MIT-time decreased from GP (2.8 h/month) to SP (2.2 h/month) and CP
(1 h/month). HIT-time increased from GP (2.8 h/month) to SP (3.2 h/month) and CP
(4.7 h/month). Altitude training accounted for 18–25% of annual training volume and
performed across relatively short training camps (≤16 days) with a clear reduction of
HIT training, but increased total and LIT volume compared to sea-level training. Training
before international championships included a 2-week increase in LIT and strength
volume followed by a gradual reduction of training volume and increased HIT during
the last week. This study provides unique data on the world’s most successful female
cross-country skier’s long-term training process, including novel information about the
distribution of and interplay between sessions of different forms, intensities, and exercise
modes throughout the annual season.

The World’s Best Cross-Country Skier
INTRODUCTION
Cross-country (XC) skiers optimize their training to perform
in competitions ranging from multiple 3-min sprint races to
prolonged endurance races lasting up to 2 h. These competitions
are performed across varying terrain while changing between
the different sub-techniques in classic and skating (Sandbakk
and Holmberg, 2017). Although the average aerobic energy
contribution is 70–75% in sprint races and 85–95% for longer
distances, the race format is interval-based, with increased effort
in uphill terrain and lower intensities downhill (Norman et al.,
1989; Sandbakk et al., 2011a; Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017).
Furthermore, the majority of competitions involve mass-starts
in which sprint ability is critical in determining the final result.
Accordingly, high aerobic capacity is of crucial importance in
XC skiing, as reflected by world-class XC skiers’ high VO2max
values (>80 and ∼70 mL·kg−1·min−1 for men and women,
respectively) (Saltin and Astrand, 1967; Ingjer, 1991; Sandbakk
et al., 2011b, 2016; Tonnessen et al., 2015a). However, XC skiers
also need the ability to rapidly elevate their peak oxygen uptake,
utilize a high fraction of their VO2max in all of the sub-techniques,
and have well-developed skiing efficiency and anaerobic capacity
(Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017). Unique for XC skiing, both
training and competitions involve large fluctuations in speed,
work rate, and metabolic intensity, in addition to a varying load
on the upper and lower body with the different training modes
and sub-techniques utilized. Hence, the training of XC skiers is
made up of a sophisticated puzzle of training sessions of different
forms, intensities, and exercise modes that has not yet been
examined in detail.
World-class XC skiers have previously reported 800–950
annual training hours (Tonnessen et al., 2014; Sandbakk
et al., 2016). Of the total annual training volume, >90% of
elite XC skiers’ has been reported to be endurance training,
with the remaining ∼10% performed as strength or speed
work (Sandbakk et al., 2011b, 2016; Tonnessen et al., 2014).
These studies showed a pattern of endurance training time
distributed as 88–91% low-intensity training (LIT, < VT1
aerobic threshold), 3–7% moderate-intensity (MIT, VT1 < >VT2
anaerobic threshold), and 5–8% high-intensity training (HIT,
>VT2). As also shown in other endurance sports (Stoggl and
Sperlich, 2015), a pyramidal training pattern is often found
during the preparation period, whereas more polarized training
is done in the competition phase.
Approximately 60% of the total training time is performed
during the general preparation period between May and October.
This period typically includes high volumes of LIT and 50–60%
of the endurance-training conducted as sport-specific exercise
(e.g., roller skiing and skiing), with the remainder mainly
performed as running (Tonnessen et al., 2014; Sandbakk et al.,
2016). The remaining 40% of annual training is performed
during the specific preparation and competition phase, with
decreased total volume, increased amount of HIT (including 30–
40 competitions) and higher amount of sport-specific activity
forms (Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017). While the intensity
distribution and use of activity forms during different phases
of the year are well covered by several retrospective studies
(Sandbakk et al., 2011b, 2016; Tonnessen et al., 2014), the design
of specific sessions within the different zones and modes are not
well illustrated in the current literature.
In terms of periodization, most XC skiers use a traditional
model, alternating between high- and low-volume weeks while
keeping the number of MIT and HIT sessions relatively stable
(two to three sessions per week; Tonnessen et al., 2014). However,
some athletes organize the training in blocks with increased focus
on developing specific capacities over shorter periods (Sandbakk
and Holmberg, 2017). Altitude training represents a significant
portion of world-class XC skier training and is an important
piece of the periodization puzzle (Sandbakk et al., 2016). The
main aim of these altitude training camps (living at ∼1,800–
2,000 m above sea-level and training at 1,000–3,000 m) is mainly
to positively stimulate hematological parameters, and thereby
improve performance during the subsequent training and/or
competition period (Millet et al., 2010). However, in XC skiing,
altitude training also provides an opportunity for many hours
of skiing on snow throughout the dry-land training period
(Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017). Although training at altitude
has been used by endurance athletes for several decades, accurate
descriptions of the micro periodization of successful athletes is
lacking in the literature.
To ensure peak performance, a typical tapering approach
has been to perform 2–4 weeks of overload training, followed
by 1–3 weeks with decreased load (Hellard et al., 2013).
Bosquet et al. (2007) reported that performance improvements
are highly sensitive to reductions in training volume and that
the optimal range of volume reduction is 41–60%, without
substantial decreases in training frequency, compared to the pre-
tapering training. However, a recent study (Tonnessen et al.,
2014) observed that gold medal winning athletes in XC skiing
and biathlon used a more modest and progressive reduction
in training volume, with a relatively small reduction during
the last weeks prior to gold-medal performance. The authors
speculate that this progressive tapering strategy could be ideal
in sports with a dense competition schedule, as is the case
in XC skiing. However, the study reports large individual
differences in tapering behavior and does not consider the
specific sessions utilized during the final phases of the taper.
Thus, tapering behavior in world-class endurance athletes is
lacking, particularly in athletes who have attained repeated
success in major championships.
The training of world-class XC skiers involves manipulation of
variables such as different training forms (endurance, strength,
and speed), exercise modes (loading of the upper and/or lower
body), session organization (continuous or interval), and varying
terrain, making it more complex than many other endurance
sports. This makes it particularly challenging to investigate
at a group level. Case studies allow us to investigate every
piece of the training in detail and expand our understanding
of champion performance development. Earlier case studies of
high-level endurance athletes have focused on physiological test
data (Jones, 1998, 2006; Bell et al., 2017) or short-term training
studies (Stellingwerf, 2012; Mujika, 2014; Manunzio et al., 2016;
Ronnestad et al., 2017). Only a minority of studies consist
of longitudinal training data spanning several years, and the

majority of these focus on male subjects (Ingham et al., 2012;
Tjelta, 2013; Bourgois et al., 2014; Tjelta et al., 2014; Pinot and
Grappe, 2015).
Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate
the training characteristics of the most successful female XC skier
ever during the best period of her career, including the day-to-day
periodization of her training in connection with altitude camps
and tapering toward major international competitions. In order
to interpret these findings in the perspective of her long-term
development process, the secondary aim was to characterize her
longitudinal training patterns over 17 years.
METHODS
Participant
The participant (born in 1980) is the most successful female
competitor of all time in the winter Olympics and Nordic
skiing World Championships. This includes six Olympic gold
medals (four individual, two team), 18 gold medals from the
FIS World Ski Championship (12 individual, six team), 110
individual FIS World-Cup victories, and four wins of the overall
FIS World Cup (FIS, 2017). The study was evaluated by the
regional ethics committee of mid-Norway, and approved by
the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD). Written
informed consent was obtained from the participant for the
publication of this study, which was performed according to the
Helsinki declarations.
Overall Design
To give both comprehensive understanding of and detailed
insight into the athlete’s training, the study was divided into two
parts (1) investigations of the participant’s longitudinal training,
performance, and test data spanning 17 years from the age of 20
to 37 years old (2000–2017); and (2) detailed investigations of the
training during five consecutive successful seasons from the age
of 30 to 35 years old (2010–2015), including four international
championships with nine individual gold medals.
Performance Data
Performance data for each year was calculated using both race
results and the International Ski Federation’s (FIS) ranking points
from all individual distance and sprint competitions, including
World Cup competitions, the Olympic Games, and the FIS World
championships (FIS, 2017).
Physiological Testing
The participant underwent regular VO2max and lactate profile
testing (test results presented in Table 1). No physiological tests
were performed during the competition period (CP), and the
presented results therefore represent tests from May or June
(the start of the general preparation period; GP) and October
or November (the start of the specific preparation period: SP).
All physiological testing during the period was conducted at the
Norwegian Olympic Sports Centre, primarily supervised by the
same exercise physiologist. The apparatus and testing procedures
used during the lactate profile and VO2max test are previously
described (Ingjer, 1991; Tonnessen et al., 2015a). Anaerobic
threshold (AT) was determined during treadmill running at
10.5% incline using a graded protocol, including 4–6 periods
of 5-min stages with stepwise 1-km/h increases in workload
(Enoksen et al., 2011). The same treadmill (Woodway Gmbh,
124 Weil am Rhein, Germany) was used at all tests and lactate
concentration was measured from the fingertip by an YSI 1500
sport lactate analyzer (YSI, Ohio, USA) directly after completion
of each stage. VO2 was recorded between the third and fourth
minute at each stage using an Oxycon Pro (Jaeger-Toennis,
Wurtzburg, Germany) metabolic test system. AT was determined
at the workload corresponding to 1.5 mmol/1 higher lactate
concentration than the baseline value (averaged over the two
first measurements). Total, lean, and fat mass were analyzed
for the legs, trunk, arms, and head using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) (Encore 2007, Version 11.4, General
Electric Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA), and presented in
absolute values (Table 1).
Training Monitoring
The participant recorded her day-to-day training in digital
diaries designed by the Norwegian Ski Association and the
Norwegian Olympic Federation. The training recorded for
each session included total training time distributed across
training form (endurance, strength, and sprint), activity form
(skiing, roller-skiing, running, cycling, etc.), and intensity
zone. Specific comments regarding session details were also
recorded.
To register the endurance-training intensity, the five-zone
intensity scale developed by the Norwegian Olympic Federation
was used, which has been reported to provide a valid and accurate
measurement of the duration and intensity of training by XC
skiers (Sylta et al., 2014a). However, since these zone boundaries
do not clearly correspond with underlying physiological events
(Boulay et al., 1997), we used a three zone scale based on the
ventilatory changes corresponding to the first- and second-lactate
turning point (Boulay et al., 1997; Seiler and Kjerland, 2006).
LIT refers to a training intensity below the first lactate threshold
(LT1) (<2 mM blood lactate, 60–82% of maximal heart rate;
HRmax). Moderate-intensity training (MIT) refers to an intensity
between LT1 and LT2 (2–4 mM blood lactate, 82–87% of HRmax).
High-intensity training (HIT) refers to an intensity above LT2
(>4 mM blood lactate, >87% of HRmax) (Seiler and Kjerland,
2006). Standardized intensity scales do not take into account the
individual or activity-specific variation, such as the tendency for
maximal steady-state concentrations of blood lactate tending to
be higher in activities activating less muscle mass (Beneke and
von Duvillard, 1996; Beneke et al., 2001). Hence, the participant
in this study tailored her intensity zones in accordance with both
test results and her own experience. Her self-reported intensity
zones are presented in Table 2.
Registration and Systematization of
Training Data
To register training time, the participant used a combination of
the session-goal approach and time in training zone often called
a modified session-goal approach, described in detail by (Sylta
et al., 2014b). The participant registered endurance training
by allocating the time of the different parts of the sessions
(e.g., warm-up, intervals, and cool-down) into intensity zones

HIT sessions performed as intervals, the time in the MIT/HIT
zone was registered from the beginning of the first interval
to the end of the last interval, including recovery periods.
Strength and speed training was registered from the start to the
finish of the specific strength/speed/jump part of the session,
including recovery periods. When speed training was integrated
into LIT sessions, 2 min per sprint was registered as speed
training.
All data from training diaries were systematically analyzed
session-by-session by researchers from the current research
group. Total training time and frequency of sessions were
distributed in line with “the training distribution method”
previously described (Tonnessen et al., 2014). All endurance
sessions were categorized based on duration and/or design, as
presented in Table 2.
Periodization Phases
General training data are either presented as annual training
characteristics or divided into different periodization phases, as
presented in Table 3. The day-to-day periodization of training
before, during, and after altitude camps is quantified based on
the final 2 weeks prior to altitude training, the first 2 weeks
of altitude training, and the 2 weeks after the altitude camp
in October. The training during and after the second week

of the altitude camp in 2012 was excluded from the analysis
because of illness. Tapering characteristics are quantified based
on the six final weeks of training prior to the FIS World
Championships in 2011, 2013, and 2015 and the Olympic Games
in 2014.
Interviews
To track missing data, ensure compliance with the training
diary commentaries, and verify the training intensity of different
training sessions, two structured and one semi-structured
interview with the participant were conducted during the data-
analysis phase of this study.
Missing Data
Training information was lacking for March and April of the
2010/2011 season. Data for these months was calculated based
on the years in which data was completely documented and
modified based on training plans and an interview with the
athlete. Sessions where information about session design was
lacking (10% of MIT sessions and 3% of the HIT sessions) were
only used in the time-in zone analyses.
Statistical Analyses
All data from the 2010–2015 period is presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD) of the five years. To calculate the
monthly and weekly distribution of training, total training was
divided by duration (days) of the specific phase and multiplied
by 30.4 to determine monthly time/frequency (Figures 2, 3A–D,
4A–C) or by seven to determine the weekly time and frequency
(Table 4 and Figures 5A,B). All statistical analyses were carried
out in Microsoft Office Excel 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA,
USA).
RESULTS
Longitudinal Training Characteristics
In total, 8,105 training sessions were analyzed during the period
from 2000 to 2017. These sessions comprised of 7,642 workouts
and 463 XC skiing competitions. Performance and training data
during all 17 years are presented in Figures 1A,B. Total annual
training volume increased by 80% (from 522 to 940 h) from the
age of 20–35 (2000–2015). This a yearly progression of 30 ±
53 h and an increase from ∼10 to 18 weekly training hours. The
relative distribution of endurance training into LIT/MIT/HIT
was polarized, but to a lesser extent during the latter part of her
career, i.e., ∼88/2/10 during the first part of her senior career (20–
27 years old) and ∼92/3/5 during the latter part (28–35 years old).
Subsequently, LIT volume increased from ∼430 h (20 years old)
to ∼800 h (35 years old). The amount of MIT + HIT was ∼60 h
during both the early (20–23 years old) and latter (29–35 years
old) stage of her career, but was markedly higher (∼80 h) during
a 5-year period from 23 to 28 caused by the use of extensive HIT
blocks during the general preparation phase.
Training Characteristics of the Five Most
Successful Seasons
During the five consecutive seasons, from May 2010 to April
2015, the participant achieved 107 individual podium places
in international competitions, including Olympic Games, FIS
World championships and FIS World Cup. This consisted of
63 individual World Cup victories, two gold medals from
the 2014 Olympics and seven gold medals from the three
World Championships. Annual ranking and FIS points in the
abovementioned international races were 2.5 ± 0.8 (2.0 ± 0.8
in distance races and 3.4 ± 2 in sprint races) and 9.3 ±
3.0 (including distance races and sprint qualifications points),
respectively.
Physiological tests (Table 1) showed an average VO2max of
4.39 ± 0.09 (L·min−1) and 67.7 ± 1.7 (ml·kg−1·min−1) during
the 5 years, with increased values from GP1 to GP2. VO2 at AT
was approximately 89% of VO2max.
A total of 2,713 training sessions, performed in the period
from May 2010 to April 2015 were categorized based on the
detailed design of the session (Table 3). Total annual training
volume was 937 ± 25 h, distributed across 543 ± 9 sessions. This
consisted of 849 ± 18 h (91%) endurance training, 75 ± 21 h (8%)

Endurance Training
Using the modified session goal approach, 92.3 ± 0.3% of
total endurance training time was executed as LIT, 2.9 ± 0.5%
as MIT and 4.8 ± 0.5% as HIT (including competitions).
When all endurance sessions were categorized using the
session goal method, the distribution was 76.1 ± 1.1% LIT
sessions, 7.3 ± 1.2% MIT sessions and 16.6 ± 1.2% HIT
sessions.
Annual LIT volume was 784 ± 10 h. Monthly LIT volume
decreased from GP (76 h), to SP (68 h) and further to CP (55 h)

while the number of LIT sessions remained relatively stable
across all phases (31.8 ± 1.6 sessions/month). Hence, the average
duration of LIT sessions was reduced from GP (2.0 h) to SP
(1.5 h) and CP (1.3 h). Total LIT time was distributed as 4%
sessions < 50 min, 10% as sessions [50–90> min, 42% as sessions
[90–150> min and 23% as sessions ≥150 min. The remaining
21% of LIT time was performed as warm-up or cool down in
connection with MIT, HIT, or strength sessions. The number of
LIT sessions in the different categories during the different phases
are presented in Figure 4A.
Annual MIT volume was 24.6 ± 3.6 h. Monthly MIT volume
decreased from GP (2.8 h) to SP (2.2 h) and further to CP (1.0 h).
The monthly number of MIT sessions was relative stable across
GP1, GP2, and SP (3.5 sessions), but decreased markedly in CP (2
sessions). Average duration of MIT sessions decreased from GP
(0.8 h) to SP (0.7 h) and CP (0.5 h). The annual number of 35 ± 5
MIT sessions consisted of 20% continuous sessions, 48% interval
sessions with interval-durations from 6 to 10> min, and 22% as
interval sessions with interval-durations from 10 to 15 min. The
most common MIT session was an interval session consisting of

Annual HIT volume was 40.4 ± 3.6 h. Monthly HIT volume
increased from GP1 (2.0 h) to GP2 (3.7 h), was slightly reduced

number of HIT sessions increased from GP1 (4.1 sessions) to
GP2 (7.0 sessions), SP (8.2 sessions) and CP (9.2 sessions).
Average duration of HIT sessions was approximately equal
(0.5 h) across all phases except from SP (0.4 h). The number
of annual competitions was 38.6 ± 6.3 (∼70% distance- and
∼30% sprint-competitions). Competition time increased from
GP (0.5 h/month), to SP (1.6 h/month) and further to CP (3.1
h/month). Competitions accounted for 42 and 49% of total
HIT time and number of HIT sessions, respectively. The annual
number of 79 ± 8 HIT sessions consisted of 45% continuous
sessions (including distance competitions), 38% interval training
with interval-durations from 4 to 7 min and 14% intervals with
interval-durations < 4 min (including sprint competitions). The

Strength and Speed Training
An important change during the five investigated years was
an increase in annual strength training time from ∼51 h (43%
core stabilization and 57% heavy strength training) during the
first 2 years (30–32 years old), to ∼90 h (50% core stabilization
and 50% heavy strength training) in the following 3 years. This
increase was due to both an increased number (55–75 sessions)
and duration (0.9–1.2 h) of sessions. The amount of strength
training increased from 6.0 to 10.9 h/month in GP, from 2.6
to 4.2 h/month in SP and from 1.7 to 3.0 h/month in CP.
The proportion of heavy versus core/stabilization training across
phases was relatively similar during all 5 years, with the amount
of heavy strength training increasing from GP (∼50%), to SP
(∼60%) and further to CP (∼65%).
A typical strength session consisted of 30–45 min of
core/stabilization exercises followed by 30–45 min of heavy
strength training. The core stabilization portion included various
exercises targeting muscles involved in the force transfer during
specific ski movements and exercises aiming to stabilize and
move these segments functionally while skiing. Heavy strength
sessions consisted of one or two leg exercises (e.g., squats)
and three to four upper-body exercises (e.g., seated pull-
down, standing double poling, pull-ups, lying bench-pull, and
pullover).

FIGURE 4 | (A–C) Distribution of low- (A), moderate- (B) and high-intensity
(C) sessions, categorized after duration and/or organization, across phases
during the five most successful years (2010–2015).
Annually, 14 ± 2 h of speed training, including 11.1 h ski-
specific exercises and 2.5 h of jumps/plyometrics, was performed.
The amount of speed training decreased from GP (1.7 h/month)
to SP (0.9 h/month) and CP (0.5 h/month). Speed training was
included 64 ± 9 times/year and typically performed as 6–10 ×
10–20 s sprints or 5–8 series of 10–15 plyometric jumps using
ski specific movements integrated into LIT sessions of 90–120
minutes or performed before strength sessions.
Exercise Modes
63 ± 3% (545 ± 18 h) of the yearly endurance and sprint training
was performed as sport-specific exercise modes (i.e., skating and
classical on skis or roller skis), with the remaining 37 ± 2%
(318 ± 18 h) performed as non-specific activity forms (34%
running and 3% cycling). The proportion of specific activity
forms increased from GP (52%) to SP (78%) and further to
CP (85%). Specific training time also increased from GP (44
h/month) to SP (58 h/month), but then decreased slightly to
CP (52 h/month). Sport-specific training accounted for 62, 83,
and 72% of the annual LIT, MIT, and HIT volume, respectively.
Figures 3A–D illustrate the distribution of activity forms across
the different intensities and training phases. The distribution of
training in the classic and skating techniques were approximately
equal in total training time (48 and 52%), LIT (49 and 51%),
and HIT (49 and 51%), while the proportion of skating was
substantially higher during MIT (61%).
Altitude Training
Total annual days spent at altitude was 61 ± 9, which were mainly
distributed across five altitude camps (12–14 days June/July,
12–14 days August/September, 14–16 days October/November,
10–14 days in December and 10–12 days January/February).
Total training volume at altitude ranged from 170 to 230 h,
accounting for 18–25% of the total annual training volume. The
average weekly training volume decreased from altitude camps
performed in GP (∼26 h) to SP (∼22 h) and further to CP
(∼20 h).
Training during the 2 weeks before, 2 weeks during and
the 2 weeks after the altitude camp in October/November are
presented in Table 4 and Figure 5A. Total training volume was
∼35% higher during altitude than the phases before and after.
The increased training volume occurred due to an increased
number of LIT session’s ≥2.5 h, whereas strength training time
was lower during altitude compared to the phases before and
after. The amount of training in specific modes increased
markedly at altitude, while the total volume of MIT and HIT
remained stable (∼1.5 h/week) across all three phases. However,
the MIT/HIT distribution changed from containing more HIT
before altitude (0.4 h MIT vs. 1.1 h HIT), but more MIT during
altitude (1.2 h MIT vs. 0.2 h HIT) and equal amounts of MIT and
HIT after altitude training (0.7 h MIT vs. 0.7 h HIT).
Tapering toward International Championships
The distribution of training during the final 6 weeks prior to gold
medal performance is presented in Table 4 and Figure 5B. Here,
training volume increased by 25% from pre-peaking phase 1 (day
42–29) to pre-peaking phase 2 (day 28–15), due to increased
amount of long duration LIT sessions and strength training. The
training volume was then reduced by 18% to the peaking phase
(day 14–1), which included a modest reduction in volume (6%)
during the first week (day 14–8) and a larger reduction (30%) in
the final week (day 7–1). The training volumes during the three
consecutive peaking phases were 73, 91, and 75 % of the average
GP2 training volume, respectively, while the number of sessions
was stable across all phases (∼11 sessions/week).
The amount of MIT+HIT volume remained relatively stable
across all peaking phases (∼1.3 h/week). Week-by-week analyses
showed a progressive increase in the proportion of HIT vs. MIT
during the final 3 weeks before the championship start. A detailed
description of the specific sessions performed during the final 14
days before the 2014 Olympic Games is presented in Table 5.
DISCUSSION
The present study investigated the training routines during the
best-performing period of the most successful female XC skier
of all time, analyzed in the context of her longitudinal training
patterns. Following a 12-year progressive, non-linear increase in
training load, the annual training volume during these 5 years

was ∼940 h, consisting of 91% endurance-, 8% strength-, and 1%
speed training. Endurance training was gradually more polarized,
due to reduced LIT and increased HIT, from GP to CP. 18–25%
of the annual training time was done at altitude, performed with
relatively short training camps (≤16 days) where HIT training
is reduced and LIT training increased compared to sea-level
training. Training before international championships included a
2-week increase in LIT and strength volume followed by gradual
reduction in total training volume and increased HIT during the
final week.
Longitudinal and General Training
Characteristics
In this study, in which 17 years of training were analyzed, our
participant had a 12-year progressive, non-linear increase in
training load from the age of 20 until the successful 5-year period
analyzed in detail, where annual training volume was ∼940 h,
distributed across ∼540 sessions. The overall progression in
training mainly included an increase in LIT, although in a 6-year
period she also increased the amount of HIT due to extensive
blocks of HIT training during GP. The participant was already
at a high international level and achieved her first international
gold medal at 23 years old, with training volumes slightly in
excess of 700 h. However, before the age of 25 she was not
stable at the top level in distance races and mainly performed
at a world-class level in sprint skiing; after which she performed
equally well in all disciplines and techniques. While these data
highlight the importance of a high training volume to achieve
a top international level in XC-skiing (Tonnessen et al., 2014;
Sandbakk et al., 2016; Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017), they also
indicate that a progressive increase in training load is beneficial.
Throughout the 12 initial years with increases in training
load, our participant had two major changes in “training
philosophy,” in which rapid performance improvements also
occurred. The first of these periods was in an early stage
of her senior career, where extensive blocks of HIT were
included. This led to rapid performance improvements that
stagnated after a few years, during which the progression in
training load and/or variation in stimulus were limited. The
next major performance improvement coincided with a change
to a more even distribution of training volume/intensity, a
reduction in the amount of HIT, and the implementation of
relatively large amounts of LIT. This occurred directly before
entering the successful 5-year period analyzed here. In this
period, both physiological values and performance improved
over the first year before remaining at a stable high level. The
annual training volume of >910 h consisted of ∼850 h endurance
training distributed as 92% LIT, 3% MIT, and 5% HIT when
using the modified session-goal approach to quantify training.
When quantified by the number of sessions in each zone, ∼475
endurance sessions were distributed into 76% LIT, 7% MIT, and
17% HIT. While these amounts of HIT and MIT are similar to
what was previously reported in world-class XC skiers (Sandbakk
et al., 2011b, 2016; Tonnessen et al., 2014), the volume of LIT
is remarkably high. This was combined with relatively high
amounts of strength training and regular speed training, which
may have been beneficial for maintaining muscle mass and sprint
ability. A further progression in stimuli was achieved through
inclusion of more strength training halfway through the 5-
year period, while the amount of endurance training remained
relatively stable. One unique feature of our participant is that
she combines a high aerobic capacity with greater muscle mass
than normally reported among female XC skiers (Hegge et al.,
2016), particularly in the upper-body where women typically
have the largest difference in body composition and performance
compared to men (Sandbakk et al., 2017).
In XC skiing, not just exercise volume, frequency, and
intensity are of importance. Through the 17-year period, ∼60%
of annual endurance and sprint training hours were ski specific
(skiing on snow or roller skis), while the rest was primarily
running. This alternation between exercise modes, loading the
whole body, upper body, and the legs to a different extent, is
unique for XC-skiing compared to other endurance sports. The
variation between employment of these training modes permits
high training loads during GP, while the total training load is
reduced when less variation and increased sport-specific training

is used toward CP. However, variations between exercise modes
were also employed on the micro periodization level; e.g., by
performing heavy strength training of the upper body in the
morning session followed by lower body endurance training (e.g.,
running) in the afternoon. This way of loading the upper and
lower body may not only increase the tolerable training load,
but could also reduce negative cross-over adaptation effects from
concurrent strength and endurance training. In our case, the
participant confirmed during interviews that she was conscious
about the use of terrain, e.g., by combining uphill sessions where
the legs are mainly employed, with sessions primarily loading
the upper body by using the double poling technique on the
same day. This is likely an important factor contributing to the
combination of high endurance capacity and a relatively large
muscle mass obtained by XC skiers.
Following a gradual increase in aerobic capacity, the
participant’s average VO2max was ∼68 (ml·kg −1·min−1) during
her five most successful years. This is at the same level reported
in female champions in running and orienteering (Jones, 2006;
Tonnessen et al., 2015b). Her AT increased correspondingly, and
both the participant and her coaches highlighted her gradually
improved ability to train with relatively high speed and a high
technical quality also during LIT and MIT sessions in all exercise
modes. This is supported by her lactate profiles, where her
speed at various submaximal lactate levels gradually increased
throughout her career. Similar results were shown in the female
marathon world record holder (Jones, 2006) and a world-class
rower (Bourgois et al., 2014). This is most likely a result of
her long-term progressive increase in endurance training load,
leading to enhanced peak oxygen uptake, fat utilization and
improved efficiency in all exercise modes. In this context, it is
also important to note that the body mass of the participant was
very stable throughout her senior career, and measurements of
body composition during the five successful years showed that
both her fat percentage and bone mineral density were within
healthy values. We suggest that this is an important reason for
her continuity in training during the 17 years with high loads of
endurance training.
Overall, our data indicate that a progressive increase in
training load until the age of 30 may be necessary in order to
optimize the full potential of a top-level XC skier. We hypothesize
that this allowed our champion XC skier to tolerate and respond

positively to the high training volumes utilized in the 5-year
period analyzed, where she used a polarized training pattern with
a large amount of LIT.
Training Characteristics during Five
Successful Years
Annual Periodization of Training
The total number of LIT sessions remained stable across phases
throughout the training year, while total LIT-time was gradually
reduced from GP to CP. The amount of MIT, speed, and strength
training also decreased from GP to CP, while HIT showed the
opposite pattern, which altogether induced a gradually more
polarized training pattern toward CP. The transition from
a more “pyramidal” to a more polarized endurance training
pattern was previously shown in successful athletes (Stoggl
and Sperlich, 2015). However, the large amounts of speed and
strength training during GP might be an important addition to
concurrently develop endurance and strength capacities during
the preparation period, whereas the subsequently more polarized
pattern may facilitate the ability to utilize these capacities at
competition-specific intensities.
Simultaneously, the amount of specific training increased
from 50% during GP to 85% in CP. This is in line with previous
studies of XC skiers and probably functions as an important
substitute for reduced volume during CP (Tonnessen et al., 2014).
While the sport-specific proportion of LIT and HIT increased
markedly from GP to CP, the amount of specific MIT was >80%
during all phases. In addition, the MIT sessions were performed
at relative high heart rates (87–92% of HRmax), which is higher
than normally reported in elite athletes, although RPE ratings
and lactate values were in the normal range for such sessions. The
participant confirmed that she was able to perform MIT sessions
at this level, which allowed her to accumulate and tolerate much
more time at >90% of HRmax than most of her peers. Such
training has previously been reported to be highly effective for
endurance adaptations and performance in well trained elite
athletes (Stepto et al., 1999; Sandbakk et al., 2013).
The accumulated LIT-time during GP was very high (76
h/month) and reduced in CP (55 h/month). While the
number of LIT sessions remained stable across phases (∼32
sessions/month), the amount of LIT sessions ≥90 min decreased
from GP (25 sessions/month) to CP (14 sessions/month).
Another pronounced change between phases was the increase
of LIT sessions <50 min from GP (∼0 sessions/month) to CP
(∼14 sessions/month). This methodological approach is novel,
and clearly shows how LIT sessions of different duration are
distributed differently throughout the year. The effect of duration
versus frequency of LIT sessions has not yet been examined,
although up to 90% of the total training among endurance
athletes is LIT. Interestingly, 21% (167 h) of the annual LIT
volume was warm up or cool down in connection with MIT,
HIT, or strength sessions. This part of LIT probably functions
as an important contributor to the long-term development by
enhancing the total training volume.
While the majority of MIT and HIT sessions were organized
as intervals during GP, an increase in continuous MIT and HIT
sessions was observed as the CP approached. Both exercise mode,
organization of HIT, and use of terrain got more specific closer
to CP. The fact that 42% of annual HIT time was competitions
emphasizes the importance of specific training to achieve success
in XC skiing. The participant also confirmed that competitions
were an important part of her training, particularly during her
tapering phase. The organization of endurance sessions changed
from longer to gradually prioritizing shorter LIT sessions, while
MIT and HIT sessions became more competition-specific.
Altitude Training
18–25% of annual training volume was performed during
relatively short (10–16 days) altitude camps, living at 1,800–
2,000 m.a.s.l and training at 1,000–3,000 m.a.s.l., with a clear
reduction in HIT but an increased volume of LIT compared to
sea-level training. This altitude exposure is significantly shorter
than the 4 weeks recommended to fully stimulate erythropoiesis.
However, comparable duration of camps is reported to have
beneficial effects on work economy, muscle buffering capacity,
and ventilatory factors (Millet et al., 2010). Furthermore, the
long-term effect of repeated short-duration altitude exposure
over several years is currently unknown.
The participant experienced marked progress after altitude
training, although it is not known to what extent altitude-
facilitated effects and/or the periodization of training occurring
in connection with altitude camps influence the experienced
progress. Before altitude, training changed toward a more
polarized pattern, including lower total volume and more HIT
and strength training. During altitude, HIT was reduced and
training shifted to a more pyramidal intensity distribution,
with more LIT sessions ≥2.5 h and increased amounts of MIT.
Training after altitude consisted of some easy days with reduced
volume and no MIT or HIT during the first 4 days after
altitude exposure, followed by increased intensity in training. The
participant also highlighted the opportunity to ski on snow, more
time to rest, and an increased focus on recovery as possible factors
contributing to the positive effect of altitude camps.
Tapering toward International Championships
The tapering phase prior to international championships
included a phase with frequent competitions, followed by
elevated training volume including more LIT and strength
at altitude. Thereafter, our participant reduced her training
volume and increased the amount of HIT during the final
week before championships. However, the reduction in training
volume during the final 2 weeks (18%) was much lower than
recommendations in the literature (Bosquet et al., 2007). The
same observation was made by Tonnessen et al. (2014), where
the authors speculated that this might be optimal in sports
with a dense competition schedule. As such, top athletes in XC
skiing appear to reduce their training volume less than that
recommended by the current literature. Maintenance of training
volume until the final week before the first championship event
could also be important in order to maintain performance level
over 5–6 competitions during a championship lasting 9–15 days.
Our participant integrated the competition schedule into
the tapering strategy and had a relatively similar timing

of the final competitions in the peaking phase during all
5 years. Specifically, a period with frequent competitions,
allowing less training hours, is followed by a competition
break, prioritizing altitude training with more MIT, long
duration LIT sessions and strength training. Thereafter, three
HIT sessions were performed during the final 7 days, which
include competitions at day 6–4 before the championship’s
start. However, since this analysis is based on the training
conducted prior to the first competition in each championship,
it is not certain that this was the day with the best
performance (although gold medals were won already at the first
competition).
CONCLUSION
Our
study
supports
previous
findings
highlighting
the
importance of a high training volume, using a polarized
training pattern with a large amount of LIT to reach world-class
level in XC skiing. This study provides unique data on the world’s
most successful XC skier’s long-term training process, including
novel information about the physiological development and
the distribution of and interplay between sessions of different
training forms, intensities, and exercise modes throughout
the annual season. By using a single-case approach, where
quantitative data were supported by qualitative interviews, we
were able to present the sophisticated training of a world-class
athlete from a macro- to a micro-level, allowing the generation
of new hypotheses that can be tested in future research with
larger samples.
