Abstract
Circuits in the cerebral cortex consist of thousands of neurons connected by millions of synapses. 
A precise understanding of these local networks requires relating circuit activity with the 
underlying network structure. For pyramidal cells in superficial mouse visual cortex (V1), a 
consensus is emerging that neurons with similar visual response properties excite each other1–5, 
but the anatomical basis of this recurrent synaptic network is unknown. We combined 
physiological imaging and large-scale electron microscopy (EM) to study an excitatory network in 
V1. We found that layer 2/3 neurons organized into subnetworks defined by anatomical 
connectivity, with more connections within than between groups. More specifically, we found that 
pyramidal neurons with similar orientation selectivity preferentially formed synapses with each 
other, despite the fact that axons and dendrites of all orientation selectivities pass near (< 5 μm) 
each other with roughly equal probability. Therefore, we predict that mechanisms of functionally 
specific connectivity take place at the length scale of spines. Neurons with similar orientation 
tuning formed larger synapses, potentially enhancing the net effect of synaptic specificity. With the 
ability to study thousands of connections in a single circuit, functional connectomics is proving a 
powerful method to uncover the organizational logic of cortical networks.

 Pyramidal cells in the rodent primary visual cortex (V1) respond to highly specific visual 
features, resulting in diverse receptive field preferences, in contrast with the less selective 
responses of most inhibitory neurons6–13. A model is emerging in which V1 responses arise 
from the selective amplification of thalamocortical signals1,3,4 through recurrent inputs from 
other pyramidal neurons2,5,14,15. Evidence for functionally specific cortical amplification 
has been seen in physiological2,3,14 and optogenetic4 studies; however, firm anatomical 
evidence at the synaptic level has been lacking (but see ref. 5). A recent study also showed 
that neurons with similar orientation preference share stronger connections14; however, it is 
unknown if this effect is due to stronger synapses, more synapses, or perhaps spatially 
clustered synapses. To test these hypotheses, we measured visual cortical receptive-field 
properties and then reconstructed the detailed anatomy of the same neurons, identifying 
actual synapses versus axonal-dendritic appositions8 (Fig. 1a).
We combined in vivo cellular resolution optical imaging with ex vivo EM reconstructions. 
We measured cellular calcium responses, which reflect the firing of action potentials, using 
the genetically encoded indicator GCaMP3 to characterize the sensory responses of ~300 × 
300 × 200 μm volume of an awake, behaving mouse10 (Fig. 1b–c). Visual stimuli consisted 
of drifting sinusoidal gratings of different spatial and temporal frequencies, orientations, and 
directions (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). In addition to cell bodies in layers 2/3 (L2/3), 
we measured signals (Extended Data Fig. 2) from large caliber apical dendrites that 
continued beyond the depth of our imaging volume and had branching morphologies 
consistent with deep layer pyramidal cells (see Methods). From their responses, we 
estimated the peak preferred orientation for each cell (Extended Data Fig. 3), with neurons’ 
visual preferences typically maintained across 12 days of chronic imaging (Extended Data 
Fig. 1).
After locating the functionally imaged region using vascular landmarks (Extended Data Fig. 
4 and Supplementary Video 1), we cut a series of ~3700 serial EM sections, which were 
imaged with a Transmission Electron Microscope Camera Array8 (TEMCA) at ~4 × 4 × 40 
nm/voxel. The EM-imaged region spanned 450 × 450 × 150 μm, consisting of ~10 million 
camera images and ~100 TB of raw data. We traced the processes of excitatory pyramidal 
neurons located within the middle third of the EM volume (450 × 450 × 50 μm, 
Supplementary Videos 2 and 3) using software (CATMAID16) allowing distributed 
annotation of large image datasets. Teams of trained annotators traced and validated wire-
frame models of the dendritic and axonal arbours of neurons selected for reconstruction 
(chosen because they exhibited visual responses), and located all outgoing synapses along 
the annotated axons (Fig. 1d, and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6a). For each synapse, we 
traced the postsynaptic dendrite centripetally until they reached either the cell body or the 
boundary of the aligned EM volume (Extended Data Fig. 6b, and Supplementary Data 1–3). 
We did not retrogradely trace axons providing input to selected neurons because of the lower 
probability that they originated from cells in the volume. Henceforth, we limit our 
discussion to the excitatory network from selected pyramidal cells onto spines of excitatory 
targets.
We first examined the structure of the network broadly, by examining the connectivity of 
1278 reconstructed neuronal targets (Table 1). The core of the network (201 neurons

 connected with more than one other; i.e. degree ≥ 2, no leaf nodes) exhibited a modular 
structure (Fig. 1e), quantified with a modularity index (Q, which can range from −0.5 to 1) 
that measures the degree to which a network can be divided into groups, with positive values 
indicating higher levels of connectivity within than between groups17. Modularity in the 
reconstructed network was significantly higher than would be expected by chance (Qmean = 
0.55 ± .003 vs. 0.50 ± .009, mean ± SD, P ≈ 0, Permutation test; Fig. 1e and Extended Data 
Fig. 7a–d, see Methods) and was not a consequence of higher order motifs (Extended Data 
Fig. 7). Modularity of the network offers positive evidence for pyramidal cell subnetworks 
that have previously been inferred from physiological recordings2,18,19.
We next examined the degree to which network connectivity reflects the neurons’ sensory 
properties (Figs. 1f and 2). We focused on 46 L2/3 excitatory neurons and 4 deep layer 
apical dendrites that showed reproducible responses to visual stimulation (trial correlations 
psftf < 0.05 and ppos < 0.01, excluding cells with stimulus edge effects, see Methods) and 
identified their postsynaptic targets. Within the reconstructed network, 43 functionally 
characterized neurons made 990 synapses, 443 of which were onto inhibitory interneurons 
and 547 onto other pyramidal cells (Table 1). The large fraction of synapses onto inhibitory 
neurons is consistent with past observations8,20 and seems to be a characteristic of L2/3 in 
the mouse visual cortex. Consistent with physiological studies, connectivity between 
excitatory neurons was more likely for pairs with similar orientation preferences2 (Fig. 2b, P 
< 0.05, Cochran–Armitage test). This preferential connectivity is not explained by the 
anatomical arrangement of the cell bodies whose function showed no discernible 
dependence on distance (Extended Data Fig. 8).
Since axons and dendrites of physiologically characterized neurons were traced exhaustively 
within the volume, we could further evaluate in an unbiased fashion a potential role of 
axonal and dendritic geometry in specific connectivity. We used a modified measure of 
potential synapses21, which our reconstructions allowed us to compute directly. For each 
pair of neurons, we quantified potential synapse length, or the length that each dendrite (Ld) 
traveled within a distance (s) from a given axon, where s can be considered a maximum 
distance a spine could reach to make a connection (s = 5 μm: Fig. 2a,c; s = 1 μm: Extended 
Data Fig. 9; see Methods). This helps us formulate a fine-scale version of Peters’ Rule: the 
hypothesis that the probability of a connection is proportional to the degree of axo-dendritic 
proximity, independent of other factors. As expected, connected neurons had significantly 
more Ld than unconnected pairs, that is, their geometry provided more opportunities to make 
synapses (P ≈ 0, Permutation tests, s = 5 μm, Fig. 2c; s = 1 μm: Extended Data Fig. 9). More 
interestingly, by considering potential synapse length between pairs with different relative 
orientations, we found that the neuropil is not functionally organized (P > 0.5, Permutation 
tests relative to a uniform distribution, s = 5 μm: Fig. 2d, black line, and 2e; s = 1 μm: 
Extended Data Fig. 9). Therefore, the preferential connectivity (Fig. 2d, red versus blue line, 
P < 0.05, red versus black line, P < 0.05, Permutation tests; and 2f, P < 0.05, Cochran–
Armitage test) between neurons with similar orientation preferences must be the result of 
mechanisms that take place at the scale of spines: ~1 to 5 μm. Because synapses onto the 
apical dendrites of deep layer neurons might follow different rules5,22, we also confirmed 
statistical significance (P < 0.05, Permutation test, data not shown) with only L2/3 
connections.

 Recent work suggests that, along with connection probability, the amplitude of excitatory 
postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) correlate with receptive field properties14. Mechanisms 
underlying the strength of these unitary responses are unknown, for instance whether they 
are due to multiple synapses, the spatial organization of their synapses, or stronger synapses. 
Although our sample size was not sufficient to examine the relationship between multiple 
synapses and function, past work demonstrated that virtually all pyramidal cells are 
connected by multiple synapses (reviewed in ref. 23). We therefore examined whether 
synapses connecting pairs of neurons were spatially clustered (Fig. 3a, Fig. 1d,f, thick 
arrows, and Supplementary Data 3) in a population of fifty-one reconstructed presynaptic 
neurons connected by multiple synapses onto one or more postsynaptic targets (Table 1). We 
first computed the synapse rate (λ), or synapses per 100 μm of Ld. As expected, connected 
neurons coupled by multiple synapses occur more frequently than predicted by chance, 
having far higher synapses rates for additional synapses compared to a Poisson model (P ≈ 
0, Permutation tests relative to a Poisson process with λ, Fig. 3b, compared to Fig. 2f, see 
Methods). Next, we found that pyramidal neurons were frequently interconnected by 
multiple synapses arranged close together (17.2 ± 2.9 μm, median ± SE, Fig. 3c) consistent 
with recent analyses of axon fragments in L5 apical dendrites24 and hippocampus25. A 
careful analysis of synapse locations considering potential synapse length (Ld), however, 
shows that closely spaced synapses are not specifically enriched. By comparing the relative 
magnitude of Ld for regions > 20 μm vs. < 20 μm from each synapse between a pair of 
neurons, we found that the number of distant synapses correlated (P ≈ 0, Permutation test, 
nsynapses = 195, Pearson’s r = 0.92) nearly perfectly with the expected value from the pair’s 
average density of synapses (Fig. 3d, see Methods). That is, axons and dendrites of 
connected neurons generate multiple synapses when their axon and dendrite remain close, 
but make additional synapses with an equal rate (λ) elsewhere their processes overlap within 
our limited volume. This suggests plasticity mechanisms that operate at the cellular rather 
than dendritic level, but nonetheless leaves open a potential computational role for 
positioning multiple synapses, which occur both clustered and distributed along the dendritic 
arbor.
Finally, we examined synapse size by measuring postsynaptic density (PSD) area (Fig. 4a), 
which is proportional to the number of presynaptic vesicles and spine volume26, and may be 
related to synaptic strength27–29. We found that PSD areas could be quite large (> 1.0 μm2) 
for synapses between cells with similar peak orientations (Fig. 4b–c), but were clustered at a 
smaller size (0.24 ± 0.03 μm2, mean ± SE) for the most dissimilar orientations. Connected 
cells (Fig. 4c, red line) with similar peak orientation preference exhibited larger PSD areas 
compared to control populations where the orientation selectivity differences or identity of 
connected cells were shuffled (Fig. 4c, cyan and magenta lines respectively, P < 0.01, 
Permutation tests). This functionally specific synaptic weighting was significant whether or 
not spines from apical dendrites were included in the analysis (data not shown). One 
possibility is that there are multiple classes of synapses, latent connections with smaller 
synapses, and larger synapses between similarly tuned cells.
Functional connectomics promises to build bridges between the in vivo activity of neurons, 
network connectivity, and neuronal structure30. Here, we used this approach to demonstrate 
five aspects of the excitatory cortical circuit. Independent of physiology, we demonstrate (1)

 a modular organization network organization that previously had only been inferred 
indirectly from smaller cortical subnetworks2,5,18,19, and (2) that multiple synapses between 
pairs of neurons occur far above chance levels, often closely spaced on the dendrite (<20 
μm), although there appears to be no specific mechanism favoring local clustering over 
widespread spacing. Further, we demonstrate (3) an anatomical substrate of functionally 
specific connections between neurons, and (4) that this specificity does not result from the 
spatial arrangement of the neuropil, but instead must operate at the scale of dendritic spines 
(< 1 – 5 μm). Finally, we show (5) that synapse size correlates with physiology, with larger 
synapses found between neurons with similar peak orientations. Such specific connectivity 
is consistent with intracortical amplification of afferent signals, overcoming the strong 
inhibitory tone in the awake cortex3,4,15. As methods for automated reconstruction improve, 
each of these findings will come into greater focus leading to a richer understanding of 
network structure and function.
Methods
We imaged the primary visual cortex of an awake 9-month-old C57BL/6 male mouse, as 
described previously10,13, with a custom-built two-photon microscope12. Using volumetric 
in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP3), 
we measured the time-resolved responses of a population of identified neurons to a wide 
array of stimuli including drifting gratings (up to 16 directions, 3 spatial, and 2 temporal 
frequencies). Following 12 days of imaging calcium responses in the same cohort of 
neurons, we labeled blood vessels with a tail vein injection (Rhodamine B conjugated 
dextran) and acquired an in vivo fluorescence volume. The animal’s brain was then prepared 
for large-scale transmission EM as described previously8. 3700 serial sections (< 50 nm 
thick) were cut and imaged spanning a 450 × 450 × 150 μm volume at 4 × 4 × 40 nm/voxel 
resolution. Sections representing the middle third of the EM volume were aligned and 
imported into CATMAID16 for distributed, online, manual reconstruction and targeted 
volumes around identified synapses were exported for volumetric segmentation and PSD 
analysis. EM reconstructed neurons were identified in the in vivo stack by using the blood 
vessels as landmarks. Apical dendrites originating from deeper neocortical lamina were 
similarly identified and corresponded by location and branching geometry of their apical 
tufts. Permutation tests were used in statistical analyses, unless otherwise noted.
Animal preparation
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the NIH and 
approved by the IACUC at Harvard Medical School. For cranial window implant surgery the 
mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane (1.2%–2% in 100% O2). Dexamethasone (3.2 
mg/kg, IM) was administered on the day before surgery and atropine (0.2 mg/kg, IP) at the 
beginning of surgery. Using aseptic technique, we secured a headpost in place using 
cyanoacrylate, dental acrylic, and C&B Metabond (Parkell), and made a 5 mm craniotomy 
over the left visual cortex (center: ~2.8 mm lateral, 0.5 mm anterior to lambda) as described 
previously32. A 5 mm glass cranial window was implanted consisting of an 8 mm coverslip 
cured to two 5 mm coverslips (Warner #1; total thickness: ~0.5 mm; thickness below skull:

 ~200 mm) using index-matched adhesive (Norland #71). We secured the window in place 
using cyanoacrylate and dental acrylic.
We habituated the mouse with water scheduling so that water was delivered only during and 
immediately after head restraint training. We increased the duration of head restraint 
sessions over the course of 2 weeks, from 3 min to 2 hr32. We then performed retinotopic 
mapping of visual cortical areas using widefield intrinsic autofluorescence imaging, 
measuring autofluorescence produced by blue excitation (470 nm center, 40 nm band, 
Chroma) through a green/red emission filter (longpass, 500 nm cutoff). We collected images 
using a CCD camera (Sensicam, Cooke, 344 × 260 pixels spanning 4 × 3 mm; 2 Hz 
acquisition rate) through a 5X air objective (0.14 NA, Mitituyo) using ImageJ acquisition 
software. For retinotopic mapping, stimuli were presented at 2–6 retinotopic positions for 10 
s each, with 10 s of mean luminance between trials.
GCaMP3 expression was targeted by viral injection. Dexamethasone (3.2 mg/kg, IM) was 
administered at least 2 hours prior to coverslip removal. The mouse was anesthetized 
(isoflurane, 1%–1.5%) and the cranial window was sterilized with alcohol and the coverslip 
removed. We then volume injected (50–100 ml/min, Stoelting) 30–100 nl of a 10:1 mixture 
of AAV2/1.hSynap.GCaMP3.3.SV4033 (Penn Vector Core) and 1 mM sulforhodamine-101 
(Invitrogen) to visualize the injection. Using the blood vessel pattern observed during 
widefield imaging as a guide, we made an injection in the posterior part of primary visual 
cortex at a depth of ~250 μm below the pial surface. After injection, a new cranial window 
was sealed in place and the mouse recovered.
Visual Stimulation
A 120 Hz LCD monitor (Samsung 2233RZ, 2200) was calibrated at each temporal 
frequency using a spectrophotometer (Photoresearch PR-650). We confirmed waveforms 
were sinusoidal by measuring luminance fluctuations of a full-field sinusoidally modulated 
stimulus (using a photomultiplier tube, Hamamatsu). The monitor was positioned so that the 
stimulus patch was 21 cm from the contralateral eye. Local 40° Gabor-like circular patches 
(sigmoidal 10%–90% falloff in 10°) containing either square-wave (for mapping retinotopy 
with widefield intrinsic autofluorescence and targeting GCaMP3 injections) or sine-wave 
(for mapping position of receptive fields with two-photon imaging) drifting gratings (80% 
contrast) were alternated with periods of uniform mean luminance (59 cd/m2). In an effort to 
increase the population of responsive cells and explore receptive field parameters we 
presented gratings of varying directions at multiple spatial and temporal frequencies or at 
different positions in the visual field. We presented either 8 directions at 3 spatial 
frequencies (0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 cycles per degree (cpd)) and 2 temporal frequencies (2 and 
8 Hz), 16 directions at 2 spatial frequencies (0.04 and 0.16 cpd) and 2 temporal frequencies 
(2 and 8 Hz), 8 directions at 6 positions, or 16 directions at 4 positions (45–115° eccentricity 
and −5–25° elevation), for a total of 64 stimulus types plus 10% blank trials. Stimuli were 
centered on the location eliciting maximum calcium responses in the imaged field 
(monocular cortex), which most effectively drove responses in the population for 
experiments that did not vary stimulus position. All stimuli in a given protocol were

 presented in a pseudo-random order (sampling without replacement), and presented 3 times 
per volume experiment with 2–4 experiments per volume per day.
Two-Photon Calcium Imaging
Imaging was performed with a custom-designed two-photon laser-scanning microscope12. 
Excitation light from a Mai Tai HP DeepSee laser (Spectra-Physics) with dispersion 
compensation was directed into a modulator (Conoptics) and a beam expander (Edmund 
Optics). The expanded beam was raster scanned into the brain with a resonant (4 kHz, 
Electro-Optical Products) and a conventional galvanometer (Galvoline) (240 line frames, 
bidirectional, 31 Hz) through a 0.8 numerical aperture (NA) 16X objective lens (Nikon). 
Emitted photons were directed through a green filter (center: 542 nm; band: 50 nm; 
Semrock) onto GaAsP photomultipliers (no cooling, 50 μA protection circuit, 
H7422P-40MOD, Hamamatsu). The photomultiplier signals were amplified (DHPCA-100, 
Femto), and low-pass filtered (cutoff frequency = ~700 kHz). These and the mirror driver 
signals were acquired at 3.3 MHz using a multifunction data acquisition board (PCI-6115, 
National Instruments). Images were reconstructed in MATLAB (MathWorks) and 
continuously streamed onto a RAID array. Microscope control was also performed in 
MATLAB using an analog output board (PCI-6711, National Instruments). The laser’s 
dispersion compensation was adjusted to maximize collected fluorescence.
A piezoelectric objective translator on the microscope enabled imaging multiple 300 × 300 × 
100 μm volumes with 8 planes at 4 Hz separated by ~12.5 μm allowing us to capture the 
response properties of many cells through the depth of L2/3. The imaged field of view was 
200–300 μm on a side at resolution of 0.8–1.2 μm/pixel (dwell-time ~2.7 μs). GCaMP3 was 
excited at 920 nm. Laser power was automatically adjusted as a function of imaging depth at 
the modulator with power exiting the objective ranging from 30–60 mW.
During imaging, the mouse was placed on 6” diameter foam ball that could spin noiselessly 
on an axel (Plasteel). We monitored trackball revolutions using a custom photodetector 
circuit and recorded eye movements using an IR-CCD camera (Sony xc-ei50; 30 Hz) and 
infrared illumination (720–2750 nm bandpass filter, Edmund). Visual stimuli were presented 
for 4 s with 4 s of mean luminance between trials. Recording sessions were 2–6 hr in 
duration.
Use of the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3, permitted recording from the 
same neurons over multiple days with the selectivity of calcium signals stable over several 
days of imaging (Extended Data Fig. 1)32,34,35. Within this volume we obtained calcium 
signals from cell bodies of superficial layer (L2/3) neurons and large caliber apical dendrites 
that continued beyond the depth of our imaging volume and had branching morphologies 
consistent with deep layer pyramidal cells. These were likely from L5 neurons because of 
their large caliber, and because most L6 pyramidal cells do not project their apical dendrites 
more superficially than L436,37. The calcium signals from these deep layer apical dendrites 
stem from either forward-38,39 or back-propagating action potentials40, are consistent across 
days (Extended Data Fig. 1) and along the length of the deep layer apical dendritic trunks 
(Extended Data Fig. 2), and therefore most likely reflect the response properties of the soma. 
We relocated the cohort of neurons daily by using the vasculature’s negative staining as

 fiducial landmarks. For the final in vivo imaging session, we injected the tail vein with a 
fluorescent dye to label blood vessels (Rhodamine B isothicyanate-Dextran (MW ~70k), 5% 
v/v, Sigma) and acquired a fluorescence stack to correspond the calcium-imaged neurons in 
vivo with their identities in the EM volume ex vivo8 (see below, and Extended Data Fig. 4).
EM material preparation
Following in vivo two-photon imaging the animal was perfused transcardially (2% 
formaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Cacodylate buffer with 0.04% CaCl2) and the 
brain was processed for serial-section TEM. 200 μm thick coronal vibratome sections were 
cut, post-fixed, and en bloc stained with 1% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide 
followed by 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated with a graded ethanol series, and embedded in 
resin (TAAB 812 Epon, Canemco). We located the calcium-imaged region by matching 
vasculature between in vivo fluorescence and serial thick (1 μm) toluidine blue (EMS) 
sections cut from an adjacent vibratome sections, then cut ~3700 serial (<50 nm) sections on 
an ultramicrotome (Leica UC7) using a 35 degree diamond knife (EMS-Diatome) and 
manually collected sections on 1×2 mm dot-notch slot grids (Synaptek) that were coated 
with a pale gold Pioloform (Ted Pella) support film, carbon coated, and glow-discharged. 
Following section pickup, we post-stained grids with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Large-scale TEM imaging, alignment, and correspondence
Using the custom-built Transmission Electron Microscope Camera Array (TEMCA)8 we 
imaged the ~3700 section series, targeting a ~450 × 450 μm region for each section (Fig. 
1c). Acquired at 4 nm/pixel in plane, this amounted to ~100 terabytes of raw data to date 
comprising 30 million cubic microns of brain and > 10 million (4000 × 2672 pixel) camera 
images. Magnification at the scope was 2000x, accelerating potential was 120 kV, and beam 
current was ~90 microamperes through a tungsten filament. Images suitable for circuit 
reconstruction were acquired at a net rate of 5–8 MPix/s. Approximately the middle third of 
the series (sections 2281–3154) was aligned using open source software developed at 
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (AlignTK)8 and imported into CATMAID16 for 
distributed online visualization and segmentation. Within the analyzed EM series there were 
51 missing sections. Nineteen were single section losses. There were 2 instances each of 
missing 2, 3, and 4; and 1 instance each of missing 6 or 8 consecutive sections near the 
series boundaries. Folds, staining artifacts, and some times cracks occurred during section 
processing, but were typically isolated to edges of our large sections and therefore did not 
usually interfere manual segmentation. To find the correspondence between the cells imaged 
in vivo with those in the EM data set, a global 3-D affine alignment was used with fiducial 
landmarks manually specified at successively finer scales of vasculature and then cell bodies 
to re-locate the calcium-imaged neurons in the EM-imaged volume (Extended Data Fig. 4). 
Apical dendrites arising from deep layer (putative L5) pyramidal neurons were identified by 
their characteristic morphology36,41,42 (also see below). Their correspondence was 
facilitated by the unique branching patterns of their apical tufts and those that could not be 
unambiguously identified were not included in the functional analysis.

 Reconstruction and verification
We first traced the axonal and dendritic arbours of the functionally characterized neurons in 
the EM dataset by manually placing a series of marker points down the midline of each 
process to generate a skeletonized model of the arbours using CATMAID16 (Figs. 1d, 2a, 3a, 
Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Data 1–3). We identified synapses using classical 
criteria42. For each synapse on the axon of a functionally characterized cell, dendrites of 
postsynaptic excitatory neurons were traced either to the boundaries of the aligned volume 
or centripetally back to the cell body8. We identified deep layer apical dendrites of (putative 
L5) pyramidal cells by their large caliber, high spine density, and their continuation beyond 
the bottom border of the EM volume, which spans from the pial surface through L4. For 
each neuronal target reconstruction included in the analysis, a second independent annotator 
verified the tracing by working backwards from the most distal end of every process. An 
additional round of validation was done for each synapse between functionally characterized 
cells where a third annotator who had not previously traced the pre- or post-synaptic 
process, independently verified the anatomical connectivity blind to previous tracing work. 
We began this independent round of validation at each synapse and traced the pre- and 
postsynaptic processes centripetally. If the initial reconstruction and subsequent verification 
of the reconstruction diverged, that connection and the segmentation work distal from the 
point of divergence was excluded from further analysis. EM reconstruction and validation 
was performed blind to cells’ functional characteristics and targeted cells were initially 
assigned to individual annotators pseudorandomly weighted by tracing productivity.
We performed targeted volumetric reconstructions of synapses connecting functionally 
characterized cells by developing tools to interface with CATMAID cutout, locally align, 
and catalogue volumes of interest based on location (Fig. 4a; e.g. 400 pix × 400 pix × 41 
sections or 1.6 × 1.6 × 1.64 μm volumes centered on synapses represented by CATMAID 
connectors). Presynaptic boutons, postsynaptic spines, their parent axons and dendrites, and 
postsynaptic density (PSD) areas were manually segmented with itk-SNAP (http://
www.itksnap.org/). PSD areas were calculated as described previously43 with obliquely cut 
or en face synapse areas measured using their maximum z-projection. En face or obliquely 
cut synapses were identified by serial sections that starkly transitioned from a clear 
presynaptic specialization hosting a vesicle pool, to a distinctly different postsynaptic cell, 
typically with an intervening section of electron dense area representing the postsynaptic 
density and/or synaptic cleft (e.g. Extended Data Fig. 5).
Data analysis
In vivo calcium imaging data was analyzed in MATLAB and ImageJ (NIH) as described 
previously12,13. To correct for motion along the imaged plane (x–y motion), the stack for 
each imaging plane was registered to the average field of view using TurboReg44. A 5 pixel 
border at each edge of the field of view was ignored to eliminate registration artifacts. Masks 
for analyzing fluorescence signal from neurons were manually generated corresponding to 
cells in the EM volume, registered to the in vivo anatomical fluorescence stack, and to 
individual physiological imaging planes. Time courses of cells spanning multiple 
physiological imaging planes were weighted by dwell time in each plane and averaged 
across planes. Evoked responses for each EM identified cells were measured for each

 stimulation epoch as the difference in fractional fluorescence (% ΔF/F0) between the 5 s 
after and the 2.5 s before stimulus onset (pre-stimulus activity), and averaged across 
stimulus repetitions. We quantified visual responsiveness of each cell by calculating the 
average Pearson correlation coefficient of the responses to all stimuli across repetitions 
(average trial-to-trial correlation). We defined the significance of visual responses as the 
probability (p-value) that the observed trial-to-trial correlation is larger than the correlation 
obtained from a full random permutation of the data for spatial and temporal frequency 
experiments (psftf < 0.05) and experiments where stimulus position was varied (ppos< 0.01). 
In retinotopic experiments designed to increase the number of characterized neurons, we 
found cells that did not reliably respond to stimuli ±20° from the center of the display. These 
cells that either had receptive fields smaller than our stimuli or stimuli were positioned at the 
at the edge of their receptive fields. We considered these cells as potentially driven by 
stimulus edge effects and therefore excluded such experiments from further analysis. To 
estimate the preferred orientation, direction, and spatiotemporal frequency, we modeled 
responses with a combination of a multivariate Gaussian with spatial frequency (x and y, 
deg), temporal frequency (Hz) and position (x and y, deg) as independent dimensions, a 
constant gain factor, and a static exponent. We fit the model to data using a large-scale 
nonlinear optimization algorithm (Trust Region Reflective, MATLAB Optimization 
Toolbox, MathWorks Inc.), generating multiple fits from randomly selected starting points 
and selected the best fit (least-square criterion). The quality of model fits was inspected 
visually for all neurons included in the data set.
EM connectivity was analyzed using custom written software in MATLAB and Python. 
Connectivity analysis that did not utilize functional information (Figs. 1e and 3, Extended 
Data Fig. 7) started with the entire population of excitatory neuronal targets in the 
reconstructed network. Network modularity and neuron connectivity motifs (Fig. 1e and 
Extended Data Fig. 7) were analyzed with code modified from the Brain Connectivity 
Toolbox45. We used an implementation of the Louvain method17 followed by consensus 
portioning46 for weighted and directed graphs to detect communities, or interconnected 
pyramidal neuron targets, from our EM reconstructed network purely by anatomical 
connectivity. For this analysis we included only the 201 traced neurons having multiple 
synaptic partners (degree ≥ 2). The number of synapses reconstructed between neurons was 
used as weights for all analyses. Modularity Q was given by the standard equation:
where l is the total number of edges, given by

 where N is the total set of nodes, aij is the (i,j) element of the weighted adjacency matrix, 
δ(mi,mj) is 1 if i and j are in the same community and 0 otherwise, 
 and 
 are the in and 
out degrees of the jth and ith nodes respectively, calculated by
To generate null models of connectivity matrices for hypothesis testing, we shuffled the 
reconstructed adjacency conditioned on our sample degree, weight and strength distributions 
(Extended Data Fig. 7)31,47.
Analysis of connectivity with neuronal function restricted our sample population to those 
cell pairs where both pre- and post-synaptic cells were functionally characterized. For 
orientation tuning (Figs. 1d,f, 2, 4a–c, Extended Data Figs. 5–6, 8–9), between 50 neurons, 
there were 29 connected pairs. On average, we detected 1.3 synapses per connected pair 
where we measured orientation selectivity for both cells. We varied retinotopic position and 
spatial and temporal frequencies of the grating stimulus with the goal of improved 
measurement of orientation preference for more cells. The sensory physiology of a subset of 
cells were simultaneously recorded across multiple stimulus parameters. These 120 cells 
were used for signal correlation analysis (Extended Data Fig. 10).
Potential synapse length (Ld) represents the degree to which pairs of neurons’ axonal and 
dendritic arbors come sufficiently close to make a synapse (Fig. 2a,c–f, 3b,d, Extended Data 
Figs. 9–10). For excitatory pyramidal cells, we computed this length of potential synaptic 
connectivity between all pairs by first resampling the dendritic and axonal arbour skeletons 
to a maximum segment length of 40 nm (the average thickness of the EM sections) and 
summing the length of all dendrite segments within a maximum spine length distance of the 
axon (s = 5 μm: Fig. 2, 3 and Extended Data Fig. 10; s = 1 μm: Extended Data Fig. 9). We 
use s = 5 μm based the longest spine connecting functionally connected neurons (~ 5 μm).
Analysis of neurons connected by multiple synapses (Fig. 3) was not restricted to cell pairs 
where both pre and post-synaptic cells were physiologically characterized. This population 
included 137 neurons connected by 267 synapses in 115 multi-synapse cell pairs whose 
axonal and dendritic arbours were traced exhaustively in the aligned volume. As a 
comparison population, we used 25 unique pairs connected by one synapse from the 
functionally characterized population described above, because they were also reconstructed 
throughout the aligned volume. To examine whether poly-synaptic connectivity occurs 
greater than random, we first computed a population average synapse rate (λavg) normalized 
by potential synapse length, by dividing the total number of synapses reconstructed from the 
set of 50 functionally characterized neurons by their total pairwise Ld. We next compared λ 
for individual neuron pairs each connected by different numbers of synapses (Fig. 3b). This 
was used to assess whether multiple synapses occurred more often than predicted from a 
simple Poisson model.
We examined the frequency of clustered vs. distant synapses by comparing synapse pairs 
that were separated by > 20 μm or < 20 μm. For each synapse from each pair of neurons

 connected by n synapses, we computed the total Ld within 20 μm or beyond 20 μm from that 
synapse. We then took the fraction of the overlap beyond 20 μm:
as the expected probability that each of the (n − 1) other synapses will occur > 20 μm away. 
The expected number of distant synapse was taken as (n − 1) times the fraction of overlap 
beyond 20 μm, which was compared with the actual number of distant synapses observed 
(Fig. 3d).
3-D renderings were generated using Blender (http://www.blender.org/) (Figs. 1d, 2a, 3a, 
Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Data 1–3), Imaris (Bitplane) (Extended Data Fig. 4 
and Supplemental Video 1), and itk-SNAP (Fig. 4a). Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/) 
was used for network graph layouts (Figs. 1f).
Statistics—Statistical methods were not used to predetermine sample sizes. Statistical 
comparisons between sample distributions were done with Permutation tests (i.e. Monte 
Carlo-based Randomization tests) unless otherwise noted. Permutation test were ideal as we 
do not assume the underlying distributions are normal, nor need the observations to be 
independent. For Permutation tests, we computed the incidence of differences between 
means or Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient of randomly drawn samples from combined 
sample distributions exceeding the empirical difference (Figs. 2b–d,f, 4c, and Extended Data 
Figs. 7b, 9a–b, 10c–d). Cochran-Armitage two-sided tests for trend were used on 
proportional binned data with linear weights (Figs. 2b,f). Standard errors were calculated 
from bootstrapped sample distributions. For cumulative distributions (Figs. 2c–d, 4c, and 
Extended Data Figs. 9a–b, 10c–d), we repeatedly resampled by randomly drawing with 
replacement from the sample distribution the number of observed values 1,000–10,000 times 
and extracted the standard deviation at each step of the empirical CDF. For binned data 
(Figs. 2b,f, and Extended Data Figs. 9d), each resampled distribution was binned and the 
standard deviation was computed from the resampled probabilities or rates within each bin.

 Figure 1. Functional organization of cortical excitatory network connectivity
a, Schematic representation of functionally selective connections between excitatory 
neurons. Excitatory pyramidal cells (large circles) with different preferred orientations 
provide synaptic input (smaller circles) to one another (bottom: colour code used throughout 
to indicate stimulus orientation that evokes peak physiological responses). b, Example 
stimuli (top) and time courses ΔF/F signals from single cells. c, Combined in vivo two-
photon calcium imaging followed by electron microscopy (EM). (top left) Schematic of 
imaging in the awake mouse, targeting the monocular region of the primary visual cortex

 (L2/3) pyramidal neuron (cell 1) presynaptic to a deep layer apical dendrite (cell 2), 
reconstructed from EM (colour indicates peak stimulus orientation). The thinnest process is 
the axon, dendrites of the L2/3 neuron are thicker, and the deep layer apical dendrite is 
rendered with the largest caliber. Dendritic spines were traced only if they participated in 
connections between reconstructed neurons. Presynaptic boutons (small red spheres with 
white centers) not connecting this cell pair are semi-transparent. EM micrographs of 
synapses (right) with similar overlay colours corresponding to the very similar peak 
orientation preferences for cells 1 and 2. e, Connectivity matrix of 201 excitatory neuronal 
targets in our network reconstruction with multiple synaptic partners (i.e. degree ≥ 2, no leaf 
nodes). Colour represents the number of synapses (colour key, right) between pre- and post-
synaptic neurons (same neuron order on both ordinate and abscissa). Subnetworks of 
interconnected neurons (white boxes) detected using a consensus method of Louvain 
clustering (Q = 0.55 ± .003, mean ± SD)17,31. f, Network graph of functionally characterized 
pyramidal neurons and their connections to other excitatory neuronal targets (transparent) 
viewed coronally. Arrows represent synaptic connections and their shaft thickness is scaled 
by number of synapses (range: 1–7). Neuronal targets with cell bodies in the EM volume 
drawn as circles; large caliber apical dendrites that exit the volume (deep layer pyramidal 
cells) drawn as triangles; and other postsynaptic targets (dendritic fragments) drawn as 
diamonds. Nodes are positioned by cell body location, synapse location (for dendritic 
fragments), or, for deep layer apical dendrites, by the deepest position when exiting the 
volume. Cells labeled 1 and 2 are the same as in (d). Bounding box matches region in

 Figure 2. Synaptically connected pyramidal cells predicted by function, over and above 
proximity
a, Reconstructions of three neurons with examples of potential synapse length (Ld, dotted 
outlines), which quantifies the dendritic path length of cells 2 and 3 within a maximal spine 
length (s = 5 μm) of the axon of cell 1. Neurons colour-coded by preferred stimulus 
orientation (colour key, bottom left; same as Figure 1). Note, the large Ld, but lack of actual 
synapses between cells 1 and 2 and small Ld between cells 1 and 3 where an actual synapse 
(arrow) is observed along the Ld. The axon of the postsynaptic cells and dendrites of the 
presynaptic cell are transparent. Only presynaptic boutons (small red spheres with white

 centers) from the presynaptic cell are visible. b, Synaptically connected neurons have similar 
orientation preference. Connection probability as function orientation preference difference 
across the reconstructed population (P < 0.05, Cochran–Armitage test, nconnected pairs = 29, 
nunconnected pairs = 1951). Bins include pairs of neurons with differences in preferred 
orientation of 0° to 22.5°, 22.5° to 45°, 45° to 67.5°, and 67.5° to 90°. Fractions at the 
bottom of bars are the number of connected over unconnected pairs in each bin. c, 
Synaptically connected neurons have greater potential synapse length. Cumulative 
distribution of potential synapse length was significantly greater between connected (red 
line) than unconnected pairs (blue line, P ≈ 0, Permutation test, nconnected pairs = 29, 
nunconnected pairs = 1951, s = 5 μm). Inset: Schematic of a cylinder of length Ld (transparent 
purple) around the dendrite (red) with a radius (s) equivalent to a maximal spine’s length 
where the axon (blue) comes within proximity to make a synapse. d, Cumulative distribution 
of differences in orientation preference was significantly less between connected (red line) 
than unconnected pairs (blue line, P < 0.05, Permutation test, nconnected pairs = 29, 
nunconnected pairs = 1951) or a model distribution based on potential synapse length (black 
line, P < 0.05, Permutation test, nconnected pairs = 29, nunconnected pairs = 1951). e, Potential 
synapse length (Ld) is uniform across differences in peak orientation preference between 
neurons in the model distribution. f, Synapse rate (λ: reconstructed synapses normalized by 
Ld) decreases with orientation preference difference across the reconstructed population (P < 
0.05, Cochran–Armitage test, nsynapses = 39, s = 5 μm). Error bars, b, f, and shaded regions, 
c-d, represent bootstrapped standard error. Scale bar, a, 100 μm.

 Figure 3. Multiple synapses between neurons are found above chance levels; clustered synapses 
are frequently observed, but are not specifically enriched
a, Anatomical reconstruction (left) of a L2/3 pyramidal cell presynaptic to a deep layer 
apical dendrite (thick process) by multiple synapses (right, corresponding colored boxes). 
Asterisks denote postsynaptic cell. Colour key and synapses not connecting this cell pair are 
rendered as in Figs. 1 and 2. Of 130 reconstructed presynaptic neurons, 51 had axons 
making multiple synapses onto individual neuronal targets. b, Synapse rates (λ) normalized 
by potential synapse length (Ld, s = 5 μm) for neuron pairs connect by 1–7 synapses are 
significantly higher than expected from a Poisson process with a synapse rate = λ (P ≈ 0, 
Permutation tests, nsynapses = 292). Dashed line is λavg from Fig. 2f. c, Histogram of the 
dendritic path length between pairs of synapses connecting neurons with multiple synapses. 
The median distance between synapses connecting neuron pairs was 17.2 ± 2.9 μm (median 
± SE, arrowhead). d, Multiple synapses are distributed randomly, with equal tendency to be 
clustered or distant. The cumulative number of distant (> 20 μm) reconstructed synapses, vs. 
nearby (< 20 μm), follows the cumulative number expected from a constant synapse rate, 
based on synapse multiplicity normalized by Ld, for each cell pair. X-axis sorted by
