In ‘Response to the editorial by Dr Geraghty’ 
(White et al., 2017), the authors refer to a 
2011 patient survey by Action for ME (2011a). 
They cite the survey as evidence that patients 
‘want treatments that help them to improve’, 
including graded exercise therapy (GET) 
 
and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and 
to refute Geraghty’s suggestion that ‘Their 
actions have arguably caused distress to 
patients’ (White et al., 2017: point 2; Geraghty, 
2016: 6). White et al.’s citation of the Action 
for ME (2011a) survey could suggest to read-
ers that (a) patients want GET and CBT, (b) 
patients find GET and CBT to be effective 
treatments, and thus, (c) patient survey find-
ings support PACE findings. This is not, how-
ever, what Action for ME (2011a) or other 
patient surveys show.
Patients support other 
therapies over GET and CBT
Action for ME (2011a, 2011b, 2011c) warned 
patients about widespread cuts to existing and 
future National Health Service (NHS) services for 
people with ME and asked patients which of six 
treatments/therapies they would like to be availa-
ble on the NHS, regardless of whether they had 
experienced the therapies or not. Treatments 
deemed ineffective by the PACE trial (White et al., 
2011), such as pacing (in the form of Adaptive 
Pacing Therapy, see further below) and Standard 
Medical Care, had markedly higher patient 
PACE investigators’ response  
is misleading regarding patient 
survey results

Abstract
The PACE investigators’ citation of a patient survey might mislead readers into thinking that the experience 
of people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) supports PACE findings. In fact, 
patient survey evidence directly contradicts the results of the PACE trial. A review of survey data published 
between 2001 and 2015 reveals that for most patients, graded exercise therapy leads to worsening of 
symptoms, cognitive behavioural therapy leads to no change in symptoms, and pacing leads to improvement. 
The experience of people with ME/CFS as reflected in surveys is a rich source of information, made more 
compelling by the consistency of results. Consequently, patient survey evidence can be used to inform 
practice, research and guidelines. Misrepresentation of patient experience must be vigorously challenged, to 
ensure that patients and health professionals make decisions about therapies based on accurate information.

approval ratings for availability on the NHS than 
treatments deemed effective by PACE, namely, 
GET and CBT. GET was rated the lowest of all six 
therapies. 90–94 
per cent of patients responded 
‘yes’ to pacing, medications and fatigue/condition 
management being available on the NHS, com-
pared to just 48 per cent responding ‘yes’ for GET 
and 66 per cent for CBT (Action for ME, 2011a: 5; 
Table 2). This is not the patient stamp of approval 
for PACE-approved GET and CBT that White 
et al.’s reference to the Action for ME (2011a) sur-
vey might suggest to readers. The survey supports 
the truism that patients ‘want treatments’, but did 
not assess which therapies ‘help[ed] them to 
improve’ (White et al., 2017: point 2) and demon-
strates clearly that patients show considerably less 
support for GET and CBT’s availability on the 
NHS than for other mainstream approaches, 
including pacing and medications.
A larger patient survey addressed the same 
topic; The ME Association’s (2010) survey 
asked respondents which of six therapies they 
felt were ‘helpful and acceptable’ and thus would 
recommend ‘for widespread use within the NHS’ 
(The ME Association, 2010: 25). A total of 3099 
patients responded to that question, compared to 
977 total respondents to Action for ME (2011a). 
The results rank pacing first of the six therapies, 
CBT second last and GET last. 82 per cent of 
respondents wanted pacing to be used in the 
NHS, compared to 28 per cent who wanted CBT 
and 24 per cent who wanted GET. Thus, the same 
pattern was found in both Action for ME (2011a) 
and The ME Association (2010): pacing is con-
sistently ranked as the most-wanted NHS ther-
apy by patients and GET is consistently ranked 
as the least-wanted NHS therapy. In summary, 
patient survey evidence cannot be construed to 
show widespread support for GET and CBT rela-
tive to other therapies, since it consistently ranks 
them lower.
Patients find GET and CBT 
ineffective
A wide variety of management approaches have 
been explored in surveys, some of which do not 
fit easily into the categories of ‘therapies’ or 
‘treatments’. For example, pacing is generally 
not considered a treatment for ME/CFS 
(Goudsmit et al., 2012: 1141), rather a compen-
satory self-management strategy (see further 
below). For simplicity, however, in this article, 
the term ‘therapy’ will be used to refer to any 
management approach/strategy/technique/ther-
apy/treatment explored in surveys. The terms 
‘effective’ and ‘efficacy’ will be used when 
patients report that a therapy improved or helped 
their symptoms. The ME Association surveys 
(2010, 2015) used the term ‘improve’, while 
Action for ME surveys (2008, 2014) used the 
term ‘helpful’. Similarly, ‘harmful’ and ‘harm’ 
will be used when patients report that a therapy 
led to worsening of their symptoms. Both ME 
Association and Action for ME surveys used the 
term ‘worse’. Worsening of symptoms for a con-
siderable proportion of patients will be inter-
preted as reflecting negatively on the ‘safety’ of 
a therapy.
Although the survey cited by White et al. 
(Action for ME, 2011a) did not address efficacy 
or safety of therapies, regular large patient sur-
veys are conducted, asking patients who have 
used various therapies whether their symptoms 
improved, stayed the same or got worse, such as 
Action for ME (2014; n = 2081), The ME 
Association (2010; n = 4217) and Action for ME 
and Association of Young People with ME 
(2008; n = 2763, henceforth referred to as Action 
for ME, 2008). These surveys are a valuable 
source of feedback from patients about the effi-
cacy and safety of therapies that they have expe-
rienced, in larger numbers than those that can be 
feasibly enrolled in randomised trials.
When therapies are ranked in order of the 
percentage of patients who reported that their 
symptoms improved, GET ranks low, meaning 
that it is consistently identified as being one of 
the least effective therapies for ME/CFS. In 
three large surveys, GET ranked 19th of 20 ther-
apies, 24th of 25 and joint last of 15 (Action for 
ME, 2014: 19; The ME Association, 2010: 9; 
Action for ME, 2008: 13, respectively). Most or 
all other therapies were thus more effective than 
GET in improving symptoms. Therapies rank-
ing higher than GET for effectiveness include 
pacing, medication, meditation, dietary changes, 
reflexology, acupuncture and homoeopathy 
 1170 
Journal of Health Psychology 22(9)
(Action for ME, 2014: 19). In the same surveys, 
CBT ranked joint 15th of 20, 22nd of 25, and 
13th of 15, making CBT one of the least effec-
tive therapies. Pacing, on the other hand, which 
the PACE trial deemed ineffective, ranked 2nd 
of 20, 1st of 25 and 2nd of 15 in the same sur-
veys. Only rest was more helpful. In the largest 
of the three surveys, just 22 per cent reported 
improvement with GET and 26 per cent reported 
improvement with CBT, while 71 per cent 
reported improvement with pacing (The ME 
Association, 2010: 9). In summary, patient sur-
vey evidence consistently finds that GET and 
CBT are among the least effective therapies for 
ME/CFS, while pacing is effective, in direct 
contrast to PACE trial claims.
Patients find GET harmful
Since patient surveys ask whether symptoms 
got worse, therapies can also be ranked in terms 
of which cause the most harm. In three large 
surveys, GET consistently ranked highly for 
harm, meaning that a higher proportion of 
patients reported that their symptoms worsened 
with GET than with other approaches. GET 
ranked 2nd most harmful of 20 therapies, 1st of 
25 and 1st of 15 (Action for ME, 2014: 19; The 
ME Association, 2010: 10; Action for ME, 
2008: 13, respectively). CBT generally ranks 
towards the middle for harm in the same sur-
veys: 7th of 20, 10th of 25 and 5th of 15. In the 
largest of the three surveys, 57 per cent reported 
worse symptoms from GET, 20 per cent reported 
worsening from CBT and 5 per cent reported 
worsening from pacing (The ME Association, 
2010: 10). If PACE-approved GET and CBT 
were safe and effective, we would expect 
patient surveys to show GET and CBT resulting 
in a net decrease in patients on disability bene-
fits. Instead, we see the opposite: a net increase 
in patients on disability benefits after GET 
courses (+13%) and CBT courses (+10%), 
compared to a net decrease in benefits (−1%) 
after pacing courses (The ME Association, 
2015: 75). In summary, patient survey evidence 
consistently finds GET harmful and CBT to 
have a higher rate of harm than many more 
effective therapies, in contrast to PACE trial 
claims of both GET and CBT being safe.
Figure 1 summarises patient survey evidence 
on the safety and efficacy of GET, CBT and pac-
ing. The results of five major patient surveys 
since 2001 by the two main ME patient organisa-
tions in the United Kingdom, Action for ME and 
The ME Association, are pooled to give an over-
view of patient response to each therapy. Data 
are further broken down by survey and therapy 
in Table 1. The Action for ME (2011a) survey 
cited by White et al. (2017) is not included

because it did not address the efficacy or safety 
of individual therapies. A traffic light colour cod-
ing system is used to highlight harm and benefit: 
red indicates that the patients’ symptoms were 
worse after therapy, amber that the patients’ 
symptoms remained unchanged after therapy 
and green that the patients’ symptoms had 
improved after therapy. Data should be inter-
preted bearing limitations of surveys in mind 
(see Kindlon, 2011: 64–67).
A clear pattern can be seen from Figure 1 
and Table 1: for most patients, GET results in 
worsening of symptoms (harm), CBT results in 
no change (ineffective) and pacing results in 
 1172 
Journal of Health Psychology 22(9)
improvement (effective). Patient survey find-
ings are in direct contradiction of PACE find-
ings of benefit from GET and CBT, no benefit 
from Adaptive Pacing Therapy (APT) and no 
harm from any therapy. Moreover, patient sur-
veys support Kindlon’s (2011) argument that 
harms associated with GET and CBT may be 
underreported in randomised trials including 
PACE (see also Vink, 2017). The consistency of 
results between surveys is striking, making 
patient survey evidence more compelling. Of 
particular note is that patient survey evidence 
shows that GET results in worsening of symp-
toms for more patients than it helps and patients 
find pacing effective.
Patients find pacing effective: 
why did PACE find APT 
ineffective?
As the data in Figure 1 and Table 1 demonstrate, 
patient surveys consistently show that patients 
find that pacing improves/helps their symp-
toms, with an average of 70 per cent reporting 
improvement in the surveys summarised. This 
is in keeping with research on pacing as a ‘strat-
egy which helps patients with ME/CFS limit 
exertion-related symptomatology’ (Goudsmit 
et al., 2012: 1140). The efficacy of pacing is 
also consistent with the evidence on post-exer-
tional malaise (Institute of Medicine, 2015: 
78–86) and recent research on defective energy 
metabolism in ME/CFS (Fluge et al., 2016 and 
references therein).
The ME Association (2015: 19) defined pac-
ing as ‘an energy management strategy in which 
people with ME are encouraged to achieve an 
appropriate balance between activity and rest’. 
While rest is a key component of pacing, Clark 
and White (2008) refer to ‘the many negative 
consequences of rest’. Patient survey data con-
sistently indicate that rest makes just 1 per cent 
of patients worse and is helpful to more than 
85 per cent of patients (Action for ME, 2008: 
13; Action for ME, 2014: 19; Action for ME, 
2001 cited in 2008: 13) compared to an average 
of 49 per cent worse with GET (Table 1). How 
do we explain the wide gulf between patient 
experience of pacing and rest in surveys and 
PACE claims?
The PACE trial purported to compare the 
efficacy of pacing with that of GET and CBT by 
devising a course called ‘Adaptive Pacing 
Therapy’ comprising 15 sessions with an 
Occupational Therapist and homework. White 
et al. (2011) concluded that APT was ‘not an 
effective addition’ to Standard Medical Care (p. 
823) and that ‘Our results do not support pac-
ing, in the form of APT’ (p. 834). The PACE 
trial APT manual, however, describes an exten-
sive Occupational Therapy intervention that 
includes pacing, but also encompasses relaxa-
tion techniques, sleep management, body 
mechanics, ergonomics, problem-solving and 
advice for carers (Cox et al, 2004). It is this 
wide-ranging intervention devised for PACE, 
Adaptive Pacing Therapy, that was found inef-
fective in the PACE trial. Critics have pointed 
out differences between pacing and APT 
(Goudsmit et al., 2012: 1144; Jason, 2017: 1–3), 
which could account for APT having been 
found ineffective in PACE (White et al., 2011).
Patient survey evidence suggests that pacing 
is widely used by patients, with 67 per cent of 
respondents to the Action for ME (2014) survey 
using pacing, an increase from 58 per cent in 
2008 (Action for ME, 2014: 17). Similarly, the 
ME Association’s data from 2008 showed at 
least 51 per cent were practising pacing; 2137 
of 4217 answered questions on pacing’s effect 
on their symptoms (The ME Association, 2010: 
9). The PACE trial, however, did not report the 
proportion of patients using pacing as a self-
management strategy in each treatment arm 
either at onset or at conclusion of the trial. If a 
large proportion of patients randomised to APT 
in the PACE trial were already pacing prior to 
trial commencement, as patient surveys suggest 
might have been the case, then those patients 
may already have improved as much as they 
were going to from pacing. So, for many or per-
haps most patients in the APT arm, the PACE 
trial may have been assessing the efficacy of the 
non-pacing elements of APT.
Interestingly, patients reported a higher rate of 
symptom improvement with self-managed 
 Kirke 
1173
pacing than courses on pacing (56% vs 38%, The 
ME Association, 2015), a trend also seen for 
GET and CBT (see Table 1 above). Additionally, 
self-managed pacing is more widely used than 
courses on pacing; of 840 respondents to The 
ME Association’s (2015) survey questions on 
pacing, 73 per cent reported using pacing as a 
self-management strategy, compared to 27 per 
cent who attended a course. These data could 
explain why PACE found APT, a course, ineffec-
tive, while patient surveys find pacing, mostly 
self-managed, effective. It also points to a poten-
tial issue with courses for people with ME/CFS. 
Perhaps the exertion of attending a course on 
pacing is negating some of the benefits experi-
enced with self-managed pacing. Alternatively, 
patients who are self-managing may be mitigat-
ing some flaws in courses delivered by health 
professionals, by using different strategies or 
applying strategies differently.
Whatever the explanation(s) for APT being 
found ineffective in PACE, patient survey evi-
dence highlights the importance of patients 
with ME/CFS using pacing and of health pro-
fessionals continuing to encourage it.
Further evidence of harm 
from exercise therapies
Patient-reported harm from GET is echoed by 
high rates of reported harm from physical thera-
pies in general. In The ME Association’s (2010) 
survey, three of the four most harmful therapies 
were physical: GET, physiotherapy and yoga 
(p. 10). Action for ME (2011d) completed a 
smaller survey to look at physical rehabilitation 
therapies more closely, finding that physical 
rehabilitation therapies did more harm than 
good, with 60 per cent of those who did GET 
reporting worsening of their condition (com-
pared to 22% reporting improvement), 52 per 
cent reporting worsening with exercise on pre-
scription (compared to 26% reporting improve-
ment), and 46 per cent worsening with other 
physical rehabilitation therapies (compared to 
23% reporting improvement) (p. 12).
The ME Association’s (2015) survey examined 
the effect of adding elements of GET to courses on 
CBT or pacing, that is, adding a physical rehabili-
tation element into an otherwise non-physical ther-
apy. The data suggest that the addition of elements 
of GET increased the rate of harm (see Figures 
3:4:2a, 3:4:3a and 3:4:4a, The ME Association, 
2015: 29–31). For example, when patients did a 
CBT course with no GET elements, 18 
per cent of 
patients reported worsening of symptoms, com-
pared to 34 per cent reporting worsening from a 
CBT course with GET elements.
Patient survey evidence strongly suggests that 
far from being an effective therapy for ME/CFS, 
GET and other physical rehabilitation therapies 
actively harm patients with ME/CFS, meaning 
that they cause worsening of symptoms. This is 
in line with exertion intolerance being central to 
ME/CFS (Institute of Medicine, 2015) and accu-
mulating biomedical research evidence that 
points to abnormal physiological response to 
exercise (see review by Twisk and Geraghty, 
2015) and dysfunctional energy metabolism in 
ME/CFS (Fluge et al., 2016). Patient survey evi-
dence is inconsistent with the PACE authors’ 
beliefs in the deconditioning and fear avoidance 
models of ME/CFS (White et al., 2011: 825).
PACE-author White has previously argued 
that reported exacerbation of symptoms from 
GET in patient surveys is a ‘mistaken criticism’ 
(Clark and White, 2008), occurring not due to 
GET itself but due to improper implementation 
of GET (Clark and White, 2008, 2010), based 
on an interpretation of data from an Action for 
ME (2003) survey. In that survey, of 54 patients 
who did GET, 26 (48%) reported negative out-
comes (Action for ME, 2003: 12). Clark and 
White (2008) argued that ‘in many cases, exer-
cise was being undertaken independently, with-
out the supervision of a therapist trained to 
deliver GET to patients with CFS [Action for 
ME, 2003]. In other words, it was not GET’. 
The reader might interpret this to mean that 
those who did exercise independently reported 
negative outcomes, however, the data do not 
show this. For example, only 1 of 12 patients 
who did GET with ‘no professional’ reported a 
negative outcome, compared to 12 of 18 patients 
who did GET with the supervision of a physio-
therapist (Action for ME, 2003: 12).
 1174 
Journal of Health Psychology 22(9)
Further evidence that it is GET, rather than its 
implementation, that is most problematic comes 
from Action for ME’s (2008) survey, where, as 
noted by Kindlon (2011: 65), there was
no statistically significant difference in the rate of 
people saying they were made worse from 
engaging in GET under a ‘NHS specialist’ 
(31.27%, 111/355) compared to the rest of those 
reporting such an outcome from GET in another 
scenario (33.02%, 70/212).
The ME Association (2015) survey explored 
this issue in much greater detail, examining the 
effect of a number of variables affecting imple-
mentation of GET courses, including therapist 
specialism in ME/CFS, therapist beliefs about 
ME/CFS, individual versus group delivery, par-
tial versus full course completion and whether 
elements of pacing and/or CBT were included. 
Regardless of how GET courses were imple-
mented, the rate of harm from GET remained 
above 50 per cent in all conditions (range 51%–
80%), and rate of improvement remained below 
25 per cent across conditions (range 2%–24%; 
The ME Association, 2015: 28–41). This sug-
gests that what causes harm is GET, contrary to 
Clark and White’s (2010) claim. Poor imple-
mentation does amplify this harm, but well-
implemented GET still causes worsening for 
most patients. GET courses implemented by 
therapists specialising in ME/CFS resulted in 
considerably more harm (57% of patients wors-
ened) than good (20% improved; The ME 
Association, 2015: 32). A therapy doing mark-
edly more harm than good to patients, even 
when implemented by specialists, is dangerous 
to patients. While survey limitations must be 
taken into account, these consistent findings 
should ring alarm bells for rehabilitation pro-
fessionals and those in charge of clinical guide-
lines, to ensure that harmful therapies are 
withdrawn from use.
Discussion
The stark mismatch between patients’ experi-
ence of GET/CBT/pacing as evidenced in 
patient surveys, and PACE trial investigators’ 
claims regarding safety and efficacy of GET/
CBT/APT, is at the heart of PACE-gate. White 
et al. (2017: 4) conclude their response by reit-
erating their claim that PACE ‘provide[s] 
patients, healthcare professionals, and commis-
sioners with the best evidence that both CBT 
and GET are safe and effective treatments’ and 
as such are ‘good news for patients who, in our 
experience, just want to get better’. However, 
patient survey data provide compellingly con-
sistent evidence, from larger samples than 
PACE examined, that for most patients, GET 
results in worsening of symptoms, CBT is inef-
fective and as such, these two therapies are 
unhelpful for patients who want to get better. 
Additionally, pacing emerges as consistently 
helping patients to improve. Patient surveys 
thus contradict the PACE investigators’ claim 
that ‘CBT and GET can safely be added to 
[Standard Medical Care] to moderately improve 
outcomes for chronic fatigue syndrome, but 
[Adaptive Pacing Therapy] is not an effective 
addition’ (White et al., 2017, 2011). Instead of 
supporting PACE findings, patient surveys are 
in line with critical reanalyses of the recently 
released subset of PACE trial data (Matthees 
et al., 2016; Vink, 2017; Wilshire et al., 2016).
Patient experience in the form of patient sur-
vey data is a rich source of information regard-
ing the safety and effectiveness of treatments 
and therapies and must inform practice, research 
and guidelines. Readers who wish to judge 
whether PACE trial authors’ ‘actions have argu-
ably caused distress to patients’, as Geraghty 
(2016: 6) argued, and PACE trial authors 
rejected (White et al., 2017: point 2), or who 
wish to assess whether GET and CBT are safe 
or effective, would do well to examine patient 
survey data thoroughly. The ME Association’s 
(2015) extensive report of patient experiences 
of GET, CBT and pacing, comprising both 
quantitative and qualitative data, is an excellent 
starting point and should be required reading 
for any clinician considering prescribing GET 
or CBT to patients with ME/CFS.
In spite of White et al.’s (2017) misleading 
citation of Action for ME (2011a), patient survey 
 Kirke 
1175
findings cannot legitimately be cited as lending 
support to PACE findings, since they show the 
opposite. Misrepresentation of patient experience 
must be vigorously challenged to ensure that 
therapies experienced by most patients as causing 
worsening or no change in symptoms, such as 
GET and CBT, are not promoted as something 
that patients want or have found effective. While 
biomedical research advances are beginning to 
elucidate pathophysiology and will hopefully 
lead to effective treatments, in the meantime that 
treatment gap must not be filled by unhelpful 
therapies that worsen illness and cost money. 
Sometimes, nothing is better than something. 
Most importantly, when patients say ‘This is 
harming us’, health professionals must listen.
