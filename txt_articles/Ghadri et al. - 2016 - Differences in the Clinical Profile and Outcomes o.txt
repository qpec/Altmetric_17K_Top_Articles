IMPORTANCE Apical ballooning is broadly recognized as the classic form of takotsubo
syndrome (TTS). Atypical subtypes of TTS also exist, which constitute about 20% of all cases.
To date, clinical profile and course of atypical TTS types have rarely been studied.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the clinical profile and outcomes of typical vs atypical types of TTS
in a large patient cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Records of 1750 patients from the International
Takotsubo Registry, comprising 26 participating cardiovascular centers in 9 different
countries, were reviewed and data on clinical profile and outcomes collected from January 1,
2011, to December 31, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical characteristics and in-hospital as well as long-term
outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS Of 1750 patients diagnosed with TTS between 1998 and 2014, a total of 1430
(81.7%) presented with apical TTS (defined as typical TTS) and 320 (18.3%) with
midventricular, basal, or focal TTS (all defined as atypical TTS). Patients with atypical TTS
were younger than those with typical TTS (mean [SD], 62.5 [13.3] vs 67.3 [12.9] years;
P < .001). Brain natriuretic peptide levels on admission were lower (median factor increase of
the upper limit of normal, 4.18 vs 6.59; P = .02) and left ventricular ejection fraction was
higher (mean [SD], 43.4% [10.7%] vs 40.6% [12.0%]; P < .001) in patients with atypical than
those with typical forms of TTS. ST-segment depression was more prevalent in patients with
atypical TTS (31 of 286 [10.8%] vs 90 of 1292 [7.0%]; P = .03), while ST-segment elevation
was found more frequently in patients with typical TTS (593 of 1292 [45.9%] vs 97 of 286
[33.9%]; P < .001). Patients with atypical TTS more often had neurologic disorders than those
with typical TTS (81 of 274 [29.6%] vs 286 of 1251 [22.9%]; P = .02). While in-hospital
mortality was comparable between patients with atypical and typical TTS (10 of 320 [3.1%] vs
62 of 1430 [4.3%]; P = .32), the atypical forms showed a favorable outcome at 1 year (P = .01).
However, after adjustment for confounders, only left ventricular ejection fraction less than
45%, atrial fibrillation, and neurologic disease, but not the type of TTS, were independent
predictors. After 1 year, patients with both types of TTS showed a similar prognosis at
long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Atypical TTS has different characteristics than typical TTS,
including younger age of onset, more frequent ST-segment depression, higher prevalence of
neurologic diseases, less pronounced reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction, and lower
brain natriuretic peptide values on admission. Outcomes are comparable between patients
with both types after adjustment for confounders, suggesting that both should be equally
monitored.

T
akotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as broken heart
syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, was first de-
scribed in 19901 as transient apical ballooning of the left
ventricle in the absence of obstructive coronary artery dis-
ease,predominantlypresentinfemalepatients.2However,vari-
ants of this syndrome with midventricular,3-6 basal,7-11 and

ingly,differentformsofTTScanalsooccurinthesamepatient.14
As data on atypical forms of TTS are limited, knowledge of
clinical features and outcomes is incomplete. This limited
knowledge probably results in underdiagnosing of TTS, which
poses a major risk to patients, as the adverse outcome of TTS
still remains underrecognized.15 The International Takotsubo
Registry, which was founded to systematically investigate the
disease, constitutes the largest cohort of TTS patients to date.16

Methods
Data Collection
The International Takotsubo Registry (http://www.takotsubo
-registry.com) is an ongoing prospective and retrospective
observational registry currently with 26 participating centers
from 9 countries (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). The first
results on 1750 patients including general clinical features and
outcomeshaverecentlybeenpublishedelsewhere.16Adetailed
description of the inclusion criteria, definition of the forms of
TTS, and data collection is provided in eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement.
Records of 1750 patients were reviewed and data on clini-
cal profile and outcomes collected from January 1, 2011, to
December 31, 2014. Follow-up included death from any cause
and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (com-
posite of recurrent TTS, myocardial infarction, stroke, or tran-
sient ischemic attack or death from any cause), which were as-
sessed from medical records, telephone follow-up, or clinical
visits. Complete details on follow-up have been recently
reported.16 The study protocol was reviewed by the respec-
tive local ethics committees or investigational review boards
at each collaboration site. Due to the in part retrospective na-
ture of the study, ethics committees of most study centers
waived the need for informed consent. At centers in which the
ethics committees or investigational review boards required
informed consent or in which patients were included prospec-
tively, formal written consent was obtained from patients or
surrogates.
Statistical Analysis
Differences between groups were calculated using the
Pearson χ2 test or the Fisher exact test. Laboratory
parameters were compared using the Mann-Whitney test
and Kruskal-Wallis test. The remaining continuous data
were compared using an unpaired t test and one-way analy-
sis of variance. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier
estimates and log-rank test, as well as a landmark analysis
with a landmark set at 1 year. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS, version 22.0 (IBM Corp). P < .05
(2-sided) was considered statistically significant. All graphs
were compiled with Prism 6 (GraphPad).
Results
Patient Characteristics
Atypical TTS was present in 320 patients (18.3%), including the
midventricular (255 [14.6%]), basal (39 [2.2%]), and focal (26
[1.5%]) forms (Figure 1; eTable 1 in the Supplement).16 During
the period from 1998 to 2014, atypical TTS was increasingly
diagnosed (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Patients with atypi-
cal TTS were younger than patients with typical TTS ([SD], 62.5
[13.3]vs67.3[12.9]years;P < .001),andpatientswithbasalTTS
were the youngest among the subgroup of those with atypi-
cal TTS (Table; eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). There
were no differences between patients with typical and atypi-
cal TTS in symptoms on admission and emotional (P = .09) or
physical(P = .46)triggeringfactors;however,asubgroupanaly-
sis revealed that the basal form most often occurred without
an identifiable trigger (17 of 39 [43.6%] [Table; eTable 1 and
eTable 2 in the Supplement]).
Laboratory Values
On admission, levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were
higherinpatientswithtypicalTTSthanthosewithatypicalTTS
(median factor increase of the upper limit of normal, 6.59 vs
4.18; P = .02). In contrast, levels of troponin and creatine ki-
nase were not different between both groups. Levels of
C-reactive protein on admission were higher in patients with
typical vs atypical TTS (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Electrocardiogram Results
Compared with those with atypical TTS, patients with typi-
cal TTS more often had atrial fibrillation (7.7% [100 of 1298]
vs 4.2% [12 of 286]; P = .04), ST-segment elevation (45.9%
[593 of 1292] vs 33.9% [97 of 286]; P < .001), and T-wave
inversion (42.4% [548 of 1292] vs 35.0% [100 of 286];
P = .02). In contrast, ST-segment depression was more
Key Points
Question What are the differences in clinical profile and
outcomes between typical and atypical takotsubo syndrome
(TTS)?
Findings Patients with typical and atypical TTS are characterized
by distinct clinical profiles, and substantial but comparable
in-hospital complication rates, including cardiogenic shock and
death. One-year mortality is higher in patients with typical TTS,
but after adjustment for confounders, only left ventricular ejection
fraction less than 45%, atrial fibrillation, and neurologic disease,
but not type of TTS, are independent predictors of death.
Meaning Patients with typical and atypical TTS should be equally
and closely monitored.

prevalent among patients with atypical TTS (10.8% [31 of
286] vs 7.0% [90 of 1292]; P = .03), particularly in those with
the basal form (7 of 38 [18.4%]). While duration of QTc as a
hallmark of TTS did not differ between patients with typical
and atypical TTS (mean QTc, 458.7 vs 452.7 milliseconds;
P = .08), those with the basal form exhibited significantly
longer QTc times (mean, 477.3 milliseconds; P = .01) (Table;
eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Hemodynamic Findings
Patients with typical TTS had a lower left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) on admission (mean [SD], 40.6% [12.0%] vs
43.4% [10.7%]; P < .001) than patients with atypical TTS, with
the focal form having the highest LVEF (mean [SD], 50.8%
[13.6%]) (Figure 1, Table; eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Of note, LVEF recovered to normal levels irrespective
of the initial form of TTS (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Neurologic and Psychiatric Comorbidities
Patients with typical TTS more often presented with an acute
psychiatric episode than those with atypical TTS (10.5% [132
of 1254] vs 6.3% [17 of 271]; P = .03), while patients with an
atypical form more often presented with a neurologic disor-
der (29.6% [81 of 274] vs 22.9% [286 of 1251]; P = .02) (Table;
eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Outcomes
There were no significant differences between patients with
typical and atypical TTS regarding the incidence of in-
hospital complications, such as cardiogenic shock (10.5% [147
of1404]vs7.4%[23of312];P = .10),andin-hospitaldeath(4.3%
[62 of 1430] vs 3.1% [10 of 320]; P = .32) (Table; eTable 2 in the
Supplement). The focal form of TTS showed the most favor-
able outcome, with no cases of cardiogenic shock or in-
hospital death (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Accordingly, the
frequency of acute cardiac care did not differ between pa-
tients with typical and atypical TTS (20.1% [285 of 1421] vs
23.9% [75 of 341]; P = .13) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Long-term follow-up demonstrated comparable rates of
major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in patients
with typical and atypical TTS (10.0% vs 9.2%, respectively;
P = .42), while the difference in mortality showed borderline
significance between the groups (6.0% vs 3.9%, respectively;
P = .05; eTable 2 in the Supplement). We therefore per-
formed a landmark survival analysis, showing a substantially
increased mortality rate at the prespecified landmark of 1 year
in patients with typical TTS (P = .01); however, after that point,
mortality rates were comparable between both types of TTS
(P = .99; Figure 2). More important, results of a multivariate
analysis revealed that the type of TTS was not an indepen-
dent predictor of mortality at 1 year, in contrast to LVEF less
than 45%, atrial fibrillation, and the presence of neurologic
disease (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
This study is the first, to our knowledge, to determine clinical
characteristics and outcomes of patients with atypical TTS in
a large patient population. We found several differences

between patients with atypical and typical TTS. Patients with
atypical TTS are slightly younger than those with typical TTS
and more often experience neurologic comorbidities. There-
fore, one may speculate that neurologic disorders alter a pa-
tient’
s susceptibility for TTS in general as well as particular pat-
terns of wall motion abnormalities in response to a triggering
event.
Typical TTS usually affects a large extent of the myocar-
dium. The BNP levels were consistently higher and LVEF was
lower in patients with typical TTS compared with those with
atypical TTS. The most preserved LVEF was found in patients
withfocalTTS.Thus,TTSoccursinaspectrumofdifferentphe-
notypes, with focal TTS appearing as the mildest variant of the
disease.
Contrarytothecommonbeliefthattriggeringfactorsmight
differ between types,11,17 our data show that the prevalence of
emotional or physical triggers is comparable between groups.
This finding demonstrates that the small sample sizes in pre-
viousstudiescanexertaprofoundlimitation.Wefurtherspecu-
late that individuals who present with a triggering factor have
a higher probability to be diagnosed with TTS than those with-
out such factors, representing a relevant awareness bias
during clinical routine.
It appears likely that the different wall motion patterns in
patients with typical and atypical TTS translate into differ-
ences in ECG patterns. Although previous studies did not find
such differences,18 we identified significantly more frequent
ST-segment elevations and T-wave inversions and less fre-
quent ST-segment depressions in patients with typical TTS.

coronary syndrome (ACS), it is tempting to speculate that
changes on ECG results seen in TTS reflect myocardial stun-
ning and reversible damage rather than ischemia or necrosis.
Takotsubo syndrome is usually recognized as a transient
benign disease; however, Templin et al16 demonstrated that
in-hospital complications are comparable between patients
with TTS and those with ACS. Regarding the differences in wall
motion patterns and left ventricular function, we hypoth-
esized that the outcome of typical TTS is worse than that of
atypical TTS. However, despite the younger age, higher LVEF,
and lower BNP values in patients with atypical TTS, the rate
ofseverein-hospitalcomplications(eg,lethalarrhythmias,car-
diogenic shock, or death) was as high as in patients with typi-
cal TTS. Thus, all types of TTS should be monitored as closely
as patients with ACS.
Long-termfollow-updemonstratedthattheborderlinesig-
nificance in mortality was in fact driven by the difference in
the first year after the event. However, adjustment for poten-
tial confounders revealed that the type of TTS was not an in-
dependent predictor of mortality. We can only speculate that
patients with typical TTS have a longer time to recovery and
increasedincidenceofatrialfibrillation,therebyexplainingthat
LVEF is an independent predictor of mortality. Moreover, our
data also propose that other factors beyond the type of TTS
(such as neurologic disease) may contribute to increased
mortality in patients with typical TTS.
Retrospective observations have inherent limitations but
are of critical value for elucidating understudied diseases.
Notwithstanding the grown expertise in TTS diagnosis in all
participating centers, a referral bias cannot be excluded.
Conclusions
OurstudyemphasizesthatatypicalTTSaccountsfornearly20%
of all cases of TTS and has different clinical features than
typical TTS, including younger patient age, more frequent
ST-segment depression, higher prevalence of neurologic dis-
ease, less impaired LVEF, and lower BNP values. Of all forms,
focal TTS appears to have the most favorable outcome. Com-
parison of patients with typical and atypical TTS reveals simi-
larin-hospitalcomplicationratesandoutcomes.LVEFlessthan
45%, atrial fibrillation, and the presence of neurologic disease
are independent predictors of death at 1-year follow-up.
