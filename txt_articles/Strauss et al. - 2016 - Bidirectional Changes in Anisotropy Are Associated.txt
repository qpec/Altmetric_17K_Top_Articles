ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild traumatic brain injury results in a heterogeneous constellation of deficits and symptoms that persist
in a subset of patients. This prospective longitudinal study identifies early diffusion tensor imaging biomarkers of mild traumatic brain
injury that significantly relate to outcomes at 1 year following injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed on 39 subjects with mild traumatic brain injury within 16 days of injury and 40 controls;
26 subjects with mild traumatic brain injury returned for follow-up at 1 year. We identified subject-specific regions of abnormally high and
low fractional anisotropy and calculated mean fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity across all white
matter voxels brain-wide and each of several white matter regions. Assessment of cognitive performance and symptom burden was
performed at 1 year.
RESULTS: Significant associations of brain-wide DTI measures and outcomes included the following: mean radial diffusivity and mean
diffusivity with memory; and mean fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity with health-related quality of life. Signif-
icant differences in outcomes were found between subjects with and without abnormally high fractional anisotropy for the following
white matter regions and outcome measures: left frontal lobe and left temporal lobe with attention at 1 year, left and right cerebelli with
somatic postconcussion symptoms at 1 year, and right thalamus with emotional postconcussion symptoms at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Individualized assessment of DTI abnormalities significantly relates to long-term outcomes in mild traumatic brain injury.
Abnormally high fractional anisotropy is significantly associated with better outcomes and might represent an imaging correlate of
postinjury compensatory processes.

M
ild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with a hetero-
geneousconstellationofdeficitsandsymptomsthatpersistfor
the long term in 20% of patients who experience concussion.1 The
syndrome can entail cognitive impairment, most prominently in
memory, attention, and executive function, and postconcussion
symptoms (PCS) and limitations in daily functioning.
Notwithstanding earlier constructs that frame PCS as largely fac-
titious or psychogenic and without a biologic basis, it is now widely
understood that even uncomplicated mTBI-related dysfunction re-
sults from structural pathology such as traumatic axonal injury.2,3
The inability of imaging techniques such as CT and MR imaging to
detect traumatic axonal injury has led to delayed understanding of
the clinical mTBI syndrome, despite human (eg, Bigler, 20042) and
animal (eg, Mac Donald et al, 20074) studies delineating trauma-
related histopathology following even mild head trauma.
More recently, DTI has become an established means for the
detection of human traumatic axonal injury pathology in vivo; the

 overwhelming consensus of �120 published studies indicates that
despite methodologic heterogeneity, abnormally low fractional
anisotropy (FA) derived from DTI is characteristic of patients
with mTBI.5 Cross-sectional associations of DTI abnormalities
and functional outcomes support the clinical significance of these
imaging findings.6-8
Despite strong evidence supporting the ability of DTI to detect
clinically salient traumatic axonal injury pathology and its poten-
tial to identify patients at risk for poor long-term outcomes, to
date DTI has not yet yielded a validated prognostic biomarker for
several reasons: First, only a small number of longitudinal studies
have assessed the relationship between early imaging and later
outcomes.9,10 Second, most studies define outcomes as perfor-
mance on tests of cognitive function.7,8,11,12 Only a few have ex-
amined the relationship between early imaging and subjective
measures, which may more closely approximate real-world func-
tioning, such as PCS10,11 and health-related quality of life
(HRQoL).13 The morbidity of mTBI in real-world settings may
reflect deficits not captured by standard formal cognitive testing,
such as multimodal processing and divided attention.14 Third,
image-analysis approaches have largely (though not exclusively)
used group-level delineation of DTI measures. However, delinea-
tion of ROIs at the group level, whether on an a priori basis or by
using a voxelwise analysis, is insensitive to the unique spatial dis-
tribution of traumatic axonal injury, which is likely present in
each patient. Finally, most studies report the association of low FA
with poor mTBI outcomes7,8 but do not report abnormally high
FA. The few studies assessing the functional significance of abnor-
mally high FA do so at a relatively short follow-up.9,15 The objec-
tive of this study was to address current gaps in knowledge by
characterizing the relationship between acute diffusion abnor-
malities in patients with uncomplicated mTBI and their 1-year
functional outcomes, including cognition, PCS, and HRQoL. To
address the importance of spatial heterogeneity of traumatic ax-
onal injury across subjects, we used an individualized approach to
identification of abnormality in each patient with mTBI, En-
hanced Z Score Microstructural Assessment of Pathology
(EZ-MAP),16,17 and we considered both regional and brain-wide
measures and their relationship outcome. If identified prospec-
tively, those with worse prognosis could be targeted for studies of
interventions designed to improve outcomes following mTBI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subject Enrollment and Study Design
This study was approved by the Einstein Institutional Review
Board and was conducted in accordance with the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act.
All subjects provided written, informed
consent for participation in the study.
Thirty-nine subjects with mTBI were
prospectively enrolled from 2 urban
emergency departments.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for
subjects are detailed in Table 1. Subjects
were evaluated in the emergency depart-
ment within 48 hours of injury, and di-
agnosis of mTBI/concussion was made
by an emergency department physician.
If CT was performed for clinical care of the current head injury,
then an American Board of Radiology Certificate of Added Quali-
fication–certified neuroradiologist reviewed the CT images.
Subjects were excluded if skull fracture or any acute or chronic
posttraumatic abnormality such as gliosis, localized encepha-
lomalacia, or remote hemorrhage was identified.
Forty healthy volunteers were recruited from the community via
printed advertisements. The inclusion criterion for controls was
18–70 years of age. Exclusion criteria were the same as those for
subject enrollment. This study used a prospective, within-subjects
design: The role of the group of 40 controls was to provide imaging
for comparison, to allow identification of abnormal FA.
In this longitudinal study, imaging was performed within 16
days of injury (median, 7.5 days; range, 1–16 days), and cognitive
function, PCS, and HRQoL were assessed at 1 year following
injury.
Data Acquisition
Imaging. Imaging was performed by using a 3T MR imaging scan-
ner (Achieva TX; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) with
a 5-channel head coil (SENSE Head Coil; Philips Heathcare). T1-
weighted whole-head structural imaging was performed by using
sagittal 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient
echo imaging (TR/TE, 9/4.6 ms; FOV, 240 mm2; matrix, 240 �
240; section thickness, 1 mm). T2-weighted whole-head imaging
was performed by using axial 2D turbo spin-echo imaging (TR/
TE, 4000/100 ms; FOV, 240 mm2; matrix, 384 � 512; section
thickness, 4.5 mm) and axial 2D fluid-attenuated inversion recov-
ery turbo spin-echo (TR/TE, 1100/120 ms; TI, 2800 ms; FOV, 240
mm2; matrix, 384 � 512; section thickness, 4.5 mm; number of
signals acquired, 1). DTI was performed by using single-shot
spin-echo echo-planar imaging (TR/TE, 3800/88 ms; FOV, 240
mm2; matrix, 112 � 89; section thickness, 4.5 mm; independent
diffusion-sensitizing directions, 32; b�800 s/mm2 images).
Outcome Measures
Cognition. Tests of cognitive function were administered to all
subjects, by using IntegNeuro (Brain Resource Company, Sydney,
Australia), a computerized battery of cognitive tasks.18 A sum-
mary z score was computed for each of 3 cognitive domains (ex-
ecutive function, episodic memory, and attention), selected for
study because of their known associations with the mTBI syn-
drome, by using an international database of �5000 age-, sex-,
and education-matched healthy individuals, as detailed in Table 2.

 Premorbid intelligence was estimated by using the Spot-the-
Word test, which is a measure of word recognition ability and
lexical decision-making, with good reliability (0.88) and conver-
gent validity (0.60–0.86).19
Postconcussion Symptoms and Health-Related
Quality of Life Outcome Measures
At 1 year postinjury, the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms
Questionnaire20 was administered to assess PCS, and the Sickness
Impact Profile21 was administered to assess HRQoL. Patients were
classified as having postconcussion syndrome on the basis of out-
comes at 1 year rather than 3 or 6 months; thus, those with postcon-
cussionsyndromethatlasted�1yearwerenotclassifiedinthisman-
ner.Thisclassificationrestrictsthepostconcussionsyndromepatient
group to those with more persistent and chronic symptoms.
The Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire
consists of a series of 16 symptoms; subjects are asked to rate the
severity for each item, relative to preinjury experience, on a scale
from 0 to 4. Symptoms are categorized into cognitive, somatic, or
emotional factors; and each factor is used as an independent out-
come measure.22
The Sickness Impact Profile includes 68 questions pertaining
to daily functioning and is graded on a dichotomous scale (0 or 1)
yielding 5 subscores. The physical dimension is assessed as “so-
matic autonomy” and “mobility control”; the psychological di-
mension, as “psychological autonomy and communication”; and
the social dimension, as “mobility range” and “social behavior.”23
Data Analysis
Neuroradiology Assessment. An American Board of Radiology
Certificate of Added Qualification–certified neuroradiologist re-
viewed structural MR images for posttraumatic pathology, in-
cluding hemorrhage, extra-axial collection, contusion, or trau-
matic axonal injury.
Calculation of Diffusion Parameter Images. The 32 diffusion-
weighted image sets (32 b�800 s/mm2 images) were corrected for
head motion and eddy current effects by using an affine registra-
tion algorithm, with the b�0 s/mm2 image as the target, and ten-
sor fitting was performed at each voxel by using the FMRIB Dif-
fusion Toolbox (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT).24
Image Registration. All analyses were performed after transforma-
tion of diffusion parameter images to match a high-resolution T1-
weightedtemplate(MontrealNeurologicalInstitute).25Theregistra-
tion process includes correction for EPI distortions and linear
within-subject and nonlinear subject-to-template registration steps
as previously reported.17 This spatial normalization procedure has
beenshowntoberobustacrosssubjects.26 Nonetheless,theresultsof
each registration are critically assessed by viewing each stage of the
registration output, with particular assessment of the alignment of
brain surface; deep structures including the brain stem, corpus callo-
sum, and fornix; and gray/white margins in both the deep gray mat-
terstructuresandatthecorticalmargin.Theselandmarksmustalign
within2voxeldimensionsfortheregistrationtobeaccepted,though
alignment is typically nearly exact.
White Matter Segmentation. The FMRIB Automated Segmenta-
tion Tool (FAST; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FAST)27 was
used to generate a white matter mask for the 3D T1-weighted tem-
plate brain images. This mask was eroded by 3 voxels to eliminate
locations most at risk of misregistration and was used to restrict sub-
sequent statistical analysis of FA to white matter voxels.
Subregion Segmentation of White Matter. While the analysis
was performed in the Montreal Neurological Institute template
space, the Johns Hopkins University white matter atlas28 was
adapted and used for segmentation of white matter subregions.
This segmentation procedure eliminates potential observer bias
introduced by intra- and interrater variance inherent in manually
delineated ROIs. With the FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool
(FLIRT; http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/),27 the T1-weighted tem-
plate for the Johns Hopkins University white matter atlas was
registered to the T1-weighted Montreal Neurological Institute
template used for DTI analysis. The resulting transformation ma-
trix was applied to the white matter segmentation volume of the
Johns Hopkins University white matter atlas to bring it into registra-
tion with the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Individual
Johns Hopkins University regions were combined to generate larger
white matter regions used for analysis, as detailed below.
Adjustment for Demographic Covariates. Before lesion detec-
tion, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to adjust
for the effects of age, sex, and education as detailed in Kim et al.17
Regression coefficients were determined from control subjects
only, to avoid potential interaction effects of mTBI on the afore-
mentioned putative risk factors, and were applied to the voxels
within each subject’s FA image, where covariate effects on indi-
vidual voxels were significant at P � .05 and �100 significant
voxels formed a contiguous cluster.
EZ-MAP Analysis for FA Lesion Detection.
The Enhanced Z
Score Microstructural Assessment of Pathology17 is a method
for delineating abnormal regions in individual patients with
mTBI. The EZ-MAP is based on a whole-brain voxelwise z
score of a subject� Z Score � y � x
�
sd�x�� , calculated with the
mean (x
�) and SD [sd (x)] from healthy controls at each voxel, where
we denote SD from healthy controls as sd(x). We here omit the
voxel index for notation convenience. The EZ-MAP is more ro-
bust than standard z score analysis because it incorporates esti-
mated sampling variance of individual z scores by using a boot-
strap procedure, which is finally calculated as EZ � Z Score
�
ˆ B�x� .
�
ˆB�x� is �1 due to sample-to-sample variation of z scores.17 Ab-

 normal clusters were further delineated by applying a cluster size
threshold determined on the basis of the Gaussian random field
theory. This technique has been optimized and validated previ-
ously for assessment of individual subjects, and the EZ-MAP
showed greater robustness in varying control samples compared
with the z score and the 1-versus-many t test, approaches that
have been adopted in other single-subject analyses of FA imaging
data in mTBI.16,17 The EZ-MAP thus generated was thresholded
with 2 criteria: �EZ� � 1.96 for each voxel and cluster size P value
1% (corrected for multiple comparisons by the Gaussian random
field theory).16,17 A subject FA value from an abnormal FA lesion
detected by EZ-MAP is in the range of magnitude: y
�
x
� � 1.96 � K�x�, where K�x� � sd�x� � �
ˆB�x�. Because �
ˆB�x� is
�1 as aforementioned, the value of SD (K) from the control mean
in the EZ-MAP is �1.96. Validation of the EZ-MAP method in
Kim et al17 serves as the premise for its application in the current
study.
Calculation of Imaging Variables
The procedure for calculating brain-wide and regional DTI
measures for subsequent analysis is summarized in On-line
Figs 1 and 2.
Brain-Wide Imaging Measures. Each subject-specific EZ-MAP of
abnormal FA regions was segregated into 2 separate maps: 1) all
voxels showing abnormally high FA, indicated below as hFA, and
2) all voxels showing abnormally low FA, referred to below as lFA.
These maps were then used as masks and were applied to each
subject’s DTI parameter images: FA, axial diffusivity (AD), radial
diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). Mean FA, AD, RD,
and MD were thus calculated separately across all hFA voxels and
across all lFA voxels, yielding 2 measures for each diffusion pa-
rameter in each subject. Additionally, the total volume (number
of 1-mm3 voxels) of hFA and lFA was also computed for each
subject (On-line Fig 1).
Regional Imaging Measures. We selected 9 white matter regions
known to be susceptible to mTBI and/or to serve functions asso-
ciated with mTBI morbidity, as follows: the left frontal lobe, right
frontal lobe,8 left temporal lobe, right temporal lobe,10 left thala-
mus, right thalamus,12 left cerebellum and right cerebellum,29
and corpus callosum (On-line Fig 2).7
Two new class variables were generated, representing the fol-
lowing: a) the presence (1) or absence (0) of hFA in each region,
and b) the presence (1) or absence (0) of lFA for each region
(On-line Fig 2). The 2 class variables were independently gener-
ated for each region. As a result, it is possible that hFA and lFA
lesions will coexist within a single brain region. The 2 subgroups
of subjects classified by using each class variable (a or b) were
tested for significant differences in long-term outcomes.
Statistical Analyses: Relationship between Early Imaging
and Long-Term Outcomes
All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS (Version 22.0, Re-
leased 2013; IBM, Armonk, New York). Both brain-wide and re-
gional imaging measures (as defined above) were used in distinct
analyses.
The Spearman rank correlation analysis is robust to outliers
and was used to evaluate the monotonic association of brain-wide
early imaging variables and long-term (1 year) outcomes.
In addition, a regional analysis of abnormal FA was performed
to facilitate investigation of structure-function associations, de-
spite the fact—which is an expected feature of traumatic brain
injury (TBI) pathology—that not all subjects exhibited abnor-
malities in the same brain location. Student 2-sample t tests were
used to compare long-term outcomes between groups of subjects
who did-versus-did not exhibit hFA or lFA within a given ana-
tomic region (listed above).
False Discovery Rate Control for Statistical Analyses
The total number of hypotheses tested for association between
imaging measures and long-term outcomes are as follows: In the
brain-wide assessment of abnormal diffusion metrics across all
areas of hFA and lFA in each subject, 5 imaging parameters (FA
lesion volume, mean FA, mean AD, mean RD, and mean MD)
were correlated with 12 outcomes for each total hFA and total lFA,
totalling 120 (5 � 2 �12) tests. For regional analyses, we exam-
ined the difference between the 2 groups in 12 outcome measures
for each of 9 brain regions, in which subjects were classified by the
presence or absence of hFA and lFA within each brain region; 216
(2 � 9 � 12) tests were required for these analyses. Thus, in total,
336 comparisons were performed across the entire study. We
grouped the 336 comparisons into 10 subgroups by 5 outcome
categories (memory, attention, executive, PCS, and HRQoL) and
analysis approaches, brain-wide and regional. The significance of
individual tests was determined by using the Benjamini Hochberg
method at a false discovery rate � 0.15 for each subgroup.30,31
RESULTS
Study Subjects: Sample Size, Demographics, Mechanisms
of Injury, and Baseline Functional Status
Thirty-nine subjects with mTBI and 40 control subjects met the
inclusion criteria. Subjects with mTBI underwent DTI within 16
days of injury. Twenty-six subjects returned for 1-year follow-up
and were included in the analysis. During the time elapsed be-
tween enrollment and follow-up, 6 of the 26 subjects moved to
locations too far from the testing center to allow on-site, comput-
erized cognitive assessment; they were, however, available to com-
plete the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire
and Sickness Impact Profile by phone interview.

 significant difference in age (t � �0.134, P � .894), sex (�2 �
1.247, P � .264), or years of education (t � �1.919, P � .059)
between the 26 subjects and 40 controls. Nevertheless, potential
effects of age, sex, and education were addressed by voxelwise
regression adjustment, with application of regression coefficients
to all FA voxels in which demographic covariate effects were sig-
nificant at P � .05 across �100 contiguous voxels.16 All subjects
were diagnosed with mTBI in the emergency department, and no
abnormalities were identified on conventional CT or MR imag-
ing. In this relatively young sample, with a mean age of 38.5 years,
changes of microvascular ischemia and stroke were not observed.
Preinjury cognitive ability was estimated through administra-
tion of the Spot-the-Word test, a measure of reading achieve-
ment, a “hold” ability that is resistant to the effects of brain in-
jury.19 We found no difference between the 26 subjects and a
subset of 18 controls (those for whom data were available) on the
Spot-the-Word test (t � �1.152, P � .256), indicating that the
subjects’ preinjury intellectual functioning was not significantly
different from that of controls. There were no differences in age
(t � 1.353, P � .184), sex (�2 � 0.834, P � .361), years of educa-
tion (t � 1.227, P � .228), Spot-the-Word scores (t � �0.019,
P � .985), and loss of consciousness at the time of injury (�2 �
1.805, P � .179) between the 26 subjects included in the analysis
and the 13 subjects lost to follow-up (note that loss of conscious-
ness data were available for only 12/13 lost to follow-up).
Functional Outcomes at 1 Year: Cognitive Function,
HRQoL, and PCS
Figure 1A depicts a range of z scores for each of the 3 cognitive
domains, with impairment defined as z score values of �1.5 SDs
below the mean for the given domain. Figure 1B shows the prev-
alence of symptom endorsement related to HRQoL according to
dimension (social, psychological, and physical). Figure 1C, -D
demonstrate the prevalence of symptom endorsement related to
PCS and the percentage of those meeting the criteria for the diag-
nosis of postconcussion syndrome based on the Rivermead Post
Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire cutoff criterion.32
Microstructural Abnormalities at the Time of mTBI
Using the procedures described above, we detected regions of hFA
in 24/26 subjects (mean total volume � 9398 �L; maximum �
27,660 �L) and lFA in 25/26 subjects (mean total volume � 6923
�L, maximum � 39,686 �L). All subjects showed at least 1 region
of hFA or lFA, though not all showed both. The mean hFA aver-
aged across all subjects (0.641) was significantly higher than the
mean lFA (0.278, P � .001). MD and RD were significantly higher

 in lFA (0.625, 0.567) regions than in hFA regions (0.517, 0.357)
(P � .001, P � .001). AD was not significantly different between
hFA (0.805) and lFA (0.740) regions.
Loss of Consciousness and Microstructural Abnormalities
Ten of 26 of subjects experienced loss of consciousness at the time
of injury. Mean hFA and mean lFA values within 16 days of injury
were not significantly different between those with and without
loss of consciousness at the time of injury (t � �0.904, P � .375;
t � 0.923, P � .365, respectively).
Relationship between Microstructural Abnormalities and
Functional Outcomes
Whole White Matter Assessment. Brain-Wide Imaging Mea-
sures and Cognitive Performance. Imaging measures were as-
sociated with 1-year memory performance, but not with atten-
tion or executive function. The associations with memory were
significant for higher RD from areas of hFA at baseline (� �
�0.562, P � .015) and higher MD from areas of hFA at baseline
(� � �0.488, P � .040) (On-line Fig 3).
Brain-Wide Imaging Measures and PCS. Neither hFA nor
lFA were associated with PCS when averaged across the whole
brain.
Brain-Wide Imaging Measures and HRQoL. Higher MD and
higher RD from areas of lFA (� � 0.513, P � .009; � � 0.514, P �
.009) were significantly associated with worse somatic autonomy.
Lower mean FA from regions of lFA were significantly associated
with worse psychologic autonomy and communication (� �
�0.596, P � .002) and worse emotional stability (� � �0.581,
P � .002) at 1 year postinjury (On-line Fig 4). FA, AD, RD, and
MD from regions of hFA were not significantly associated with
HRQoL.
Regional White Matter Assessment.
Regional Imaging Mea-
sures and Cognitive Performance. Subjects with hFA in the left
frontal and left temporal white matter performed better than
those without hFA in these regions on tasks of attention at 1 year
postinjury (t � 2.985, P � .008 and t � 3.322, P � .004, respec-
tively) (Fig 2).
Regional Imaging Measures and PCS. Subjects with hFA in
the right thalamus white matter experienced fewer emotional
postconcussion symptoms than did those without hFA in this
region (t � �0.398, P � .003). Subjects with hFA in the left or
right cerebellar hemisphere experienced fewer somatic postcon-
cussion symptoms than did those without abnormality (t �
�3.365, P � .003; t � �3.38, P � .003, respectively) (Fig 3A, -C).
Regional Imaging Measures and HRQoL. There were no sig-
nificant differences in HRQoL between individuals with and
without hFA or lFA within individual regions.
DISCUSSION
This prospective, longitudinal study leverages individualized as-
sessment of DTI16,17 to demonstrate associations between early
imaging and 1-year mTBI outcomes.
Imaging studies of mTBI outcomes generally use either a pri-
ori ROI or group-level voxelwise comparisons of subjects and
controls to extract imaging measures for study. Most important,
neither of these approaches acknowledges nor has the ability to
characterize the widely recognized substantial spatial variation in
injury location, which is a principal feature of mTBI.33 As a result,
these standard approaches will include areas with and without
tissue injury in the imaging measures they study. We therefore
used a technique that specifically identifies abnormalities in each
individual patient (EZ-MAP), without dilution by values from
normal tissue (inevitable with group-level delineation).
We have previously demonstrated the robustness17 and appli-
cation16 of the EZ-MAP to the detection of microstructural ab-
normalities in patients with mTBI. In this study, we further dem-
onstrate that the EZ-MAP method is highly effective in identifying
brain pathology related to long-term outcomes. Similar to using
the EZ-MAP, various other studies have used individual subject-
level procedures33,34 to detect pathology in DTI datasets from
patients with mTBI. Our approach differs in that we used regres-
sion adjustment for covariates and EZ-MAP bootstrap resam-
pling, to better characterize the population variance. Imaging
measures summarized over brain subregions, such as the frontal
lobe, surpassed whole-brain summary measures (eg, mean FA
across all abnormal white matter voxels) in identifying relation-
ships between DTI measures and functional outcomes. Although
this result may be related to differences in the statistical approach
between the whole-brain measures and subregion measures (cor-
relation analysis versus dichotomous analysis, respectively), it po-
tentially reveals an important phenomenon: Structure-function
relationships are more effectively detected when measures are ex-
tracted from delimited brain regions relevant to a particular func-

 tion and not diluted by measures from regions not specifically
supporting that function.
Using the EZ-MAP approach, we found regions of hFA, in
addition to regions of lFA, in almost all subjects. A minority of
prior studies, most of which used group-level techniques to iden-
tify abnormalities, also reported high FA and have attributed this
finding to cytotoxic edema, altered myelin sheath water compo-
sition, or inflammation. Thus, hFA has been considered an addi-
tional biomarker for injury pathology due to mTBI.6,9,15 In con-
trast, our use of individual-level delineation of abnormalities
reveals associations of hFA with better long-term outcomes.
These associations may reflect differences in the type of abnor-
mality identified by using individual-level versus group-level ap-
proaches. Whereas hFA delineated at the group level might rep-
resent damage to common areas injured across subjects, regions
of abnormally hFA identified at the individual level might reflect
subject-specific compensatory mechanisms that enhance diffu-
sion anisotropy through structural or functional changes, such as
myelination or increased synaptogenesis at the level of the den-
dritic spine, which is mediated by actin polymerization.35 Nota-
bly, studies have shown that short-term reversible increases in
anisotropy develop with cognitive training, presumably through
similar neuroplastic mechanisms.36
Relating structural changes to their functional consequences is
important in understanding the import of imaging findings and
characterizing injury effects in patients with TBI. Thus, the re-
gional analyses we performed are most salient and reveal several
interesting structure-function relationships. Notably, most liter-
ature on neuroanatomic structure-function relationships focuses
on gray matter. However, white matter axons form the infrastruc-
ture of distributed neural networks, which underlie the domains
of higher functioning so commonly impacted by the white matter
injury that follows TBI.37,38 We found significant regional associ-
ations of frontal and temporal hFA with performance on tasks of
attention, tested by using the Digit Span Forward, Continuous
Performance Task, and switching of attention (digits) tasks; the
latter 2 depend on processing speed and therefore index neural
network function. Moreover, the frontal39-41 and temporal
lobes42 both directly play an important role in attention. The sig-
nificant association of hFA in the thalamus with emotional PCS is
not surprising, given the susceptibility of the thalamus to mTBI
and its role as the major relay network of the brain, with extensive
limbic and prefrontal connectivity.43,44 We also identified associ-
ations of cerebellar abnormalities with somatic PCS, including
dizziness, nausea/vomiting, double vision, and blurry vision,
which reflect the role of the cerebellum in balance and spatial
orientation.
In addition to FA, which characterizes overall coherence of
diffusion direction, we explored the utility of AD, RD, and MD.
Preclinical experimental studies posit low AD as a marker for
intra-axonal injury and high RD as a marker for transaxonal/
axolemmal injury and demyelination.4 We found that high RD,
but not low AD, significantly correlated with worse outcomes. We
may not have identified abnormally low AD as a correlate of out-
comes because the expected decrease in AD may be masked by
increased AD related to gliosis and edema, which evolve in the late
acute setting, the timeframe during which our subjects underwent
DTI (mean, 7 days).45 In a postmortem analysis of patients with
multiple sclerosis, increased RD correlated with the severity of
demyelination and decreased axonal attenuation, presumably be-
cause the 2 are interrelated.46 We found that mean RD, but not
mean AD, was significantly associated with memory and somatic
autonomy in correlation analyses, consistent with this pattern.
Because high RD may be a manifestation of transaxonal injury, as
suggested by preclinical studies,47 it may indicate more severe and
irreparable axonal pathology and therefore might serve as a better
early predictor of long-lasting dysfunction.
Several limitations of this study should be considered. Aniso-
tropic voxels with 4.5-mm section thickness limit spatial resolu-
tion and may lead to spuriously low FA, particularly when multi-
FIG 3. Associations between regional imaging measures and long-

toms. The asterisk indicates an outlier. C, Subjects with hFA in the

cerebellum, only 2 reported somatic postconcussion symptoms.

 ple crossing fibers are included within a single voxel.48
Nonetheless, this limitation applies equally to mTBI and control
subjects, who underwent identical imaging procedures; therefore,
we do not expect a systematic bias to result. Despite the standard-
ization of imaging, this limitation may partially account for the
absence of significant associations between the presence of low FA
and outcomes on the regional level. Moreover, the nature of the
interdependence of the various DTI parameters should be noted
because for instance, increased AD and RD might lead to high MD
but not low FA, and an increase in AD alone would affect MD and
FA. As such, primary identification of abnormality based on a
summary measure such as FA may ultimately be of less value than
a measure such as RD and may serve as the basis for future study.
In our study, of the 39 subjects who underwent acute imaging, 26
completed PCS and HRQoL assessment (33% attrition) and 20
were available for cognitive testing (49% attrition). Attrition in
mTBI cohorts is a particular challenge to research in head trauma
because subjects are disinclined to follow-up either because they
do not perceive themselves as injured or because of injury-related
dysfunction and stress. The rate of attrition we encountered is well
within the range reported in mTBI studies (35%–88%),49-51 and
we did not identify demographic or injury-severity differences
between those who did or did not complete follow-up. Nonethe-
less, the possibility of bias due to selective attrition cannot be
completely excluded. PCS and HRQoL are assessed by self-report,
and studies have shown that symptoms related to postconcussion
syndrome are common in other disease conditions, such as
chronic pain,52 and in healthy controls.53 Thus, a further poten-
tial limitation is that symptom measures were not tested in the
control sample. We addressed this issue by excluding subjects
with preexisting conditions that might cause symptoms, includ-
ing prior head injury, and by using tools that have been exten-
sively validated and widely applied to TBI.20,21 Ultimately, the
shortcomings of subjective assessment tools underscore the im-
portance of other, more objective indicators of impairment that
might not otherwise be appreciated. This limitation is thus a ma-
jor motivation for the current study. Finally, a future step might
be to evaluate similar effects in a larger cohort of patients with
mTBI and in a group of healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS
In this prospective, longitudinal study of urban subjects with
mTBI, we confirm that both brain-wide and regional individual-
ized quantification of microstructural changes shortly following
mTBI are associated with important outcomes at 1 year after in-
jury. We further identify abnormally high FA and support the
hypothesis that it may be a marker of compensatory neural mech-
anisms and harbinger of favorable outcome, which may open new
avenues toward TBI treatment.
