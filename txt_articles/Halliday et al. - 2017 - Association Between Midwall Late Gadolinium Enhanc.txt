BACKGROUND: Current guidelines only recommend the use of an implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy for the primary 
prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those with a left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) <35%. However, registries of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests 
demonstrate that 70% to 80% of such patients have an LVEF >35%. Patients 
with an LVEF >35% also have low competing risks of death from nonsudden 
causes. Therefore, those at high risk of SCD may gain longevity from successful 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy. We investigated whether late 
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance identified 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without severe LV systolic dysfunction at high 
risk of SCD.
METHODS: We prospectively investigated the association between midwall LGE 
and the prespecified primary composite outcome of SCD or aborted SCD among 
consecutive referrals with dilated cardiomyopathy and an LVEF ≥40% to our center 
between January 2000 and December 2011 who did not have a preexisting 
indication for implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.
RESULTS: Of 399 patients (145 women, median age 50 years, median LVEF 
50%, 25.3% with LGE) followed for a median of 4.6 years, 18 of 101 (17.8%) 
patients with LGE reached the prespecified end point, compared with 7 of 298 
(2.3%) without (hazard ratio [HR], 9.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9–21.8; 
P<0.0001). Nine patients (8.9%) with LGE compared with 6 (2.0%) without (HR, 
4.9; 95% CI, 1.8–13.5; P=0.002) died suddenly, whereas 10 patients (9.9%) 
with LGE compared with 1 patient (0.3%) without (HR, 34.8; 95% CI, 4.6–266.6; 
P<0.001) had aborted SCD. After adjustment, LGE predicted the composite end 
point (HR, 9.3; 95% CI, 3.9–22.3; P<0.0001), SCD (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.7–
13.8; P=0.003), and aborted SCD (HR, 35.9; 95% CI, 4.8–271.4; P<0.001). 
Estimated HRs for the primary end point for patients with an LGE extent of 0% 
to 2.5%, 2.5% to 5%, and >5% compared with those without LGE were 10.6 
(95% CI, 3.9–29.4), 4.9 (95% CI, 1.3–18.9), and 11.8 (95% CI, 4.3–32.3), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Midwall LGE identifies a group of patients with dilated 
cardiomyopathy and an LVEF ≥40% at increased risk of SCD and low risk of 
nonsudden death who may benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
implantation.

uidelines only recommend the use of implantable 
cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) for the primary pre-
vention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those with a left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35%.1,2 However, 
registries of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests demonstrate 
that 70% to 80% of such patients have a LVEF >35%, 
indicating that, in fact, the major burden of SCD occurs 
in patients with less severe degrees of LV impairment.3,4 
The need to identify the subgroup of patients with mild 
and moderate reductions in LVEF at high risk of SCD 
has been highlighted by guidelines and statements from 
the American Heart Association, American College of 
Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology, and Heart 
Rhythm Societies.2,5–7 It is important to note that such 
patients are likely to have a lower risk of death from 
competing causes and fewer symptoms compared with 
patients with lower LVEF and may potentially have more 
to gain in terms of quality-adjusted life years from suc-
cessful ICD therapy. This finding is particularly pertinent 
after the DANISH trial, which highlighted the importance 
of selecting patients with a low risk of death from other 
causes.8
Late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular mag-
netic resonance (LGE-CMR) has shown that ≈30% of 
patients with DCM have midwall LGE, which represents 
replacement fibrosis, and that this provides incremental 
prognostic information to LVEF.9–17 Whether midwall LGE 
also identifies a high risk of SCD in patients with DCM 
and less severe reductions in LVEF, who might conse-
quently benefit from an ICD, is unknown.18 Accordingly, 
we investigated whether midwall LGE is associated with 
SCD and aborted SCD in a large cohort of consecutive 
patients with DCM and LVEF ≥40%. A LVEF cutoff of 
≥40% on CMR was chosen because this approximates 
to an LVEF of 35% on echocardiography, the current ar-
biter of primary prevention ICD implantation.1,2,19–21
METHODS
Patients seen in our cardiomyopathy service or referred for 
CMR assessment between November 2000 and December 
2011 with DCM and an LVEF ≥40% were prospectively identi-
fied at the time of the scan and entered in a registry. Of 399 
patients, 193 were included in a previous study of all-comers 
with DCM investigating LGE and all-cause mortality regardless 
of LVEF.9 These patients underwent extended follow-up for 
the current stand-alone, focused investigation in this select 
population. All participants provided informed consent, and the 
study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service. 
The inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of DCM confirmed 
using the World Health Organization/International Society and 
Federation of Cardiology criteria on the basis of an elevated 
left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface 
area and reduced LVEF, compared with published age- and 
gender-specific reference values.22 Exclusion criteria are listed 
in Figure 1 and included the presence of significant coronary 
artery disease (CAD), defined as a stenosis of ˃50% in a major 
coronary artery, infiltrative disease, or valvular cardiomyopa-
thy. To ensure that patients with ischemic aetiologies were not 
included, those individuals with infarct patterns of LGE were 
also excluded.23 Patients with a history of sustained ventricu-
lar tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation, or syncope were 
excluded given a potential preexisting secondary prevention 
indication for ICD implantation. These patients have been 
included in an additional analysis in Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). No patients had a preexisting indication for 
ICD implantation on the basis of primary prevention of SCD.
CMR was carried out on 1.5 Tesla scanners (Sonata/
Avanto, Siemens) using a standardized protocol (online-only 
Data Supplement). The presence and location of midwall LGE 
were assessed by 2 independent Society of Cardiovascular 
Magnetic Resonance level 3-accredited operators blinded to 
clinical outcomes, with a third providing adjudication if neces-
sary (MA, CI, FA). LGE was considered present if midmyocardial 
or subepicardial and visible in 2 phase-encoding directions and 
2 orthogonal planes. The mass of LGE (grams) was quantified 
by a blinded operator using the full-width at half-maximum tech-
nique (CMR42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc) and indexed 
as a percentage of LV mass (MA, CI).
The prespecified primary end point was a composite of 
SCD or aborted SCD. SCD was defined as unexpected death 
≤1 hour of the onset of cardiac symptoms in the absence of 
progressive cardiac deterioration, during sleep, or ≤24 hours 
of last being seen alive.24 Aborted SCD was defined as an 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study demonstrates that midwall late gado-
linium enhancement identifies patients with dilated 
cardiomyopathy and mild and moderate reductions 
in left ventricular ejection fraction at high risk of sud-
den cardiac death.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, midwall late 
gadolinium enhancement, and mild or moderate 
reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction should 
be recognized as having a high risk of sudden car-
diac death.
• This finding is important because these patients 
are not currently offered implantable cardio-
verter defibrillators for the primary prevention of 
sudden cardiac death on the basis of guideline 
recommendations.
• Because of low competing risks of death from non-
sudden causes, it is possible that these patients will 
benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
implantation.
• Randomized trials investigating the benefit of phar-
macological therapies and implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator implantation in patients with late gado-
linium enhancement and less severe reduction in left 
ventricular ejection fraction are now required.

appropriate ICD shock for ventricular arrhythmia, success-
ful resuscitation after ventricular fibrillation, or sustained VT 
causing hemodynamic compromise and requiring cardiover-
sion.25 The principal secondary end point was all-cause mor-
tality. Additional secondary end points were (1) a composite 
of cardiovascular mortality (SCD, heart failure [HF], stroke, 
or thromboembolism), cardiovascular hospitalization, or car-
diac transplantation; and (2) a HF composite of HF death, 
unplanned HF hospitalization, or cardiac transplantation. Death 
was attributed to HF if preceded by progressive deterioration 
in symptoms and signs. HF hospitalization was defined as an 
admission with new or worsening signs and symptoms of HF 
requiring intensification of HF-specific treatment.24
Patients were followed up throughout the study by postal 
questionnaire or telephone interview, through family physi-
cians, clinics, and hospital notes. The duration of follow-up was 
calculated from the baseline scan until an end point occurred 
or last patient contact. Specifically, for the primary end point, 
any patients meeting the prespecified criteria for an event 
were censored from that date. A committee of cardiologists 
who were blinded to CMR data adjudicated outcomes (VV, AL, 
UT, ZK, DA, NP, AV). Deaths were also identified using the UK 
Health and Social Care Information Service to ensure none 
were missed. The adjudication committee established cause 
of death from death certification, postmortem results, and 
medical records using the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidance.24 Aborted SCD was 
confirmed from records including ICD electrograms when 
necessary.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics among those with and without LGE 
were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous 
data or Fisher exact test for categorical data. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves were generated and compared using the log-
rank test. Event times were measured from the baseline CMR 
date for ≤8 years. The associations between end points and 
the presence of LGE were analyzed using uni- and multivari-
able proportional hazard models. Results are presented as 
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 
multivariable model adjusted for these covariates: LVEF, New 
York Heart Assocation (NYHA) class, and age. As part of a 
sensitivity analysis, the univariable model was also adjusted 
using inverse-probability weighting by a propensity score, tak-
ing into account 13 baseline covariates, including the pres-
ence or absence of an ICD, allowing time-varying weights for 
this during follow-up. Details and full results of the propensity 
score analysis can be found in Tables I and II and Figure II in the 
online-only Data Supplement. To examine the dose-response 
relationship between LGE extent and the primary end point, 
estimated HRs were calculated for 4 groups depending on the 
extent of LGE: (1) no LGE, (2) 0% to 2.5%, (3) 2.5% to 5%, and

(4) >5% of total LV mass using univariable proportional hazard 
models. We did not report estimates per 1% increase in LGE 
because of a clear nonlinear relationship between LGE extent 
and the primary end point. The percentage extent of LGE 
giving the largest c-statistic for the prediction of the primary 
end point was calculated from 1000 bootstrap samples. The 
C-statistic measured the degree to which a model can distin-
guish between cases and controls, taking values between 0.5 
and 1.0, with larger values indicating better discrimination. To 
estimate the incremental predictive power of LGE above and 
beyond LVEF, a predicted 5-year risk of the primary end point 
was calculated from a Cox proportional model, which included 
LGE and categories of LVEF (40% to 43%, 44% to 47%, 48% 
to 51%, 52% to 55%, and 56% to 59%).
For comparison of participants with and without LGE, the 
sample size was estimated to provide ˃90% power to detect 
a significant difference in the primary end point if the true haz-
ard ratio was ≥3. Statistical analyses were performed using 
Stata version 14 (StatCorp; SN and JG performed analyses). A 
P-value of <0.05 was taken as significant.
RESULTS
At baseline, 424 patients met the inclusion criteria, of 
which 25 either withheld consent for follow-up or had 
moved abroad (Figure 1). The report therefore focuses 
on 399 patients, of whom 145 were women, the me-
dian LVEF was 50% (interquartile range: 46% to 54%), 
and midwall LGE was present in 25.3%. Disagreement 
on the presence of LGE occurred in 8 cases, requiring 
adjudication by a third reviewer. Median follow-up until an 
event or last contact was 4.6 years (interquartile range: 
3.5–7.0).
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. 
Patients with midwall LGE were older (P=0.03) and 
more likely to be men (P<0.001), have diabetes mel-
litus (P=0.015) and receive loop diuretics (P=0.009). 
They also had lower heart rates (P=0.02) and diastolic 
blood pressure (P=0.02). The most common clinical 
presentation was with signs or symptoms of HF (n= 
176; 44.1%). An additional 69 (17.2%) patients pre-
sented with symptoms of palpitation secondary to atrial 
arrhythmia or ventricular ectopy, 7 (1.8%) with symp-
toms of light-headedness or presyncope and 3 (0.8%) 
with first-degree atrioventricular block or a blunted chro-
notropic response. A further 39 (9.8%) patients were 
diagnosed after referral for family screening. Common 
indications classified as Other included diagnostic un-
certainty or an abnormal ECG, such as the finding of 
left-bundle-branch block.
In line with guidelines, an ischemic etiology was con-
sidered in all patients and excluded as follows.23 All pa-
tients underwent LGE-CMR, and those with infarct pat-
terns of enhancement were excluded.23 In addition, 268 
(67.1%) patients underwent invasive or computed tomog-
raphy coronary angiography, and a further 41 (10.3%) 
had perfusion imaging (nuclear or CMR) or stress echo-
cardiography, with no provocation of ischemia. Of the 
remaining, 60 (15.0%) were ≤40 years of age without a 
history of angina or a family history of premature CAD, 
and further investigation was deemed unnecessary. All 
of the remaining 30 (7.5%) patients were free of angina 
and considered to have a low risk of CAD; in the absence 
of a class 1 indication, this was not performed.23 It is 
important to note that none of the patients underwent 
coronary revascularization or suffered an acute coronary 
syndrome during the follow-up period.
Primary End Point: Sudden Cardiac Death and 
Aborted Sudden Cardiac Death
During follow-up, 18 of 101 patients (17.8%) with LGE 
reached the primary end point compared with 7 of 299 
patients (2.3%) without (HR, 9.2; 95% CI, 3.9–21.8; 
P<0.0001) (Figure 2). After adjusting for LVEF, NYHA 
class, and age, the presence of LGE predicted SCD and 
aborted SCD (HR, 9.3; 95% CI, 3.9–22.2; P<0.0001) 
(Table 2). The results were qualitatively the same after 
adjustment based on the propensity score (Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). There was little evidence 
of a dose-response relationship between LGE extent and 
the primary end point. Estimated HRs for patients with 
an LGE extent of 0% to 2.5%, 2.5% to 5%, and >5% were 
10.6 (95% CI, 3.9–29.4), 4.9 (95% CI, 1.3–18.9), and 
11.8 (95% CI, 4.3–32.3), respectively. In keeping with 
this relationship, the cutoff percentage extent of LGE 
that provided the largest c-statistic was >0% (95% CI, 
0.0–8.5; c-statistic, 0.72).
Overall, 9 of 101 patients (8.9%) with LGE and 6 of 
299 (2.0%) without died suddenly (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.8–
13.5; P=0.002). Correspondingly, 10 of 101 patients 
(9.9%) with LGE compared with 1 out of 299 patients 
(0.3%) without (HR, 34.8; 95% CI, 4.6–266.6; P<0.0001) 
suffered aborted SCD. After adjusting for LVEF, NYHA 
class, and age, the presence of LGE predicted SCD (HR, 
4.8; 95% CI, 1.7–13.8; P=0.003) and aborted SCD (HR, 
35.9; 95% CI, 4.8–271.4; P<0.001) when analyzed indi-
vidually (Table 2). The results were qualitatively the same 
after adjustment based on the propensity score (Table II 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
The predicted 5-year risk of aborted and actual SCD 
using a model including both LGE and LVEF was marked-
ly different than a model using LVEF alone (Figure 3). For 
example, a patient with an LVEF of 45% had a 5-year pre-
dicted risk of 7.8% on the basis of LVEF alone, which fell 
to 3.2% in the absence of LGE but increased to 20.2% if 
LGE was present.
During follow-up, 32 patients (9.0%) had an ICD im-
planted before the occurrence of the primary end point, 
17 of whom also received cardiac resynchronization 
therapy. Eighteen patients received ICDs in line with pri-
mary prevention guideline recommendations after dete-
rioration in LVEF from baseline, 2 after new episodes of

sustained VT without haemodynamic compromise, and 
12 outside of conventional guideline recommendations 
after review at multidisciplinary meetings.1,2 Out of the 
latter 12 patients, 1 had a pathogenic lamin A/C muta-
tion, 2 had a pacing indication with nonsustained VT, 3 
had nonsustained VT and a family history of SCD, 4 had 
a history of nonsustained VT alone, and 2 presented with 
worsening HF and left bundle-branch block and had car-
diac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator. Of 32 
patients who received an ICD system, 4 patients (23.5%) 
with and 0 patients (0.0%) without LGE had aborted sud-
den deaths. Of 367 patients without an ICD system, 9 
patients (10.7%) with and 6 patients (2.1%) without LGE 
died suddenly.
Secondary End Points
All-Cause Mortality
During follow-up, 32 deaths occurred, of which 19 were 
cardiovascular and 13 were not (cancer, end-stage lung 
disease, sepsis, and acute small bowel obstruction). The 
overall mortality rate was higher in patients with LGE 
(12.9% versus 6.4%; HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–4.6; P=0.02) 
(Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). After ad-
justment for LVEF, NYHA class, and age, a trend toward 
higher mortality in those patients with LGE was noted; 
however, this did not reach statistical significance (HR, 
2.0; 95% CI, 1.0–4.1; P=0.056).
Cardiovascular Death, Hospitalization, and Transplantation
There were 19 cardiovascular deaths (including 15 SCDs 
and 3 HF deaths) and 42 unplanned cardiovascular hos-
pitalizations. Two patients underwent cardiac transplan-
tation, 1 of whom had full histopathologic examination of 
the explanted heart. The gross and microscopic exami-
nations correlated with LGE-CMR images (Figure IV in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Overall, this composite 
end point was more common in patients with LGE com-
pared with those without (30.7% versus 10.7%; HR, 3.6; 
95% CI, 2.2–5.8; P<0.0001) (Figure III in the online-only 
Data Supplement). After adjusting for LVEF, NYHA class, 
and age, the presence of LGE remained an independent 
predictor of the cardiovascular composite end point (HR, 
3.2; 95% CI, 1.9–5.4; P<0.0001).
HF Death, HF Hospitalization, and Transplantation
There were 3 deaths secondary to HF and 18 unplanned 
HF admissions. The incidence of this composite end 
point was nominally more common in those with LGE 
compared with those without, although the difference 
was not statistically significant (7.9% versus 4.4%; HR, 
1.9; 95% CI, 0.8–4.6; P=0.15) (Figure III in the online-
only Data Supplement). This remained the case after 
adjustment for LVEF, NYHA class, and age (HR, 1.7; 95% 
CI, 0.7–4.2; P=0.27).
DISCUSSION
This large study in a population of well-treated and well-
characterized DCM patients with mild or moderate LV 
impairment is the first investigation to demonstrate

that midwall LGE on CMR is associated with a 9-fold 
 
increased risk of SCD and aborted SCD in this select 
subgroup. It is important to note that none of the patients 
within the cohort had a preexisting indication for ICD 
implantation at baseline, demonstrating the incremental 
value of LGE-CMR in risk stratification in this population. 
This focused investigation emphasizes the importance of 
extending risk stratification beyond LVEF assessment and 
extends earlier observations in HF populations, including 
both ischemic and nonischemic etiologies.12,26 Prediction 
of SCD and aborted SCD was independent of established 
prognostic variables, including LVEF, NYHA class, and 
age and qualitatively the same after adjustment for a 
large number of covariates based on a propensity score.
International guidelines and statements have high-
lighted the need to identify those patients with an LVEF 
>35% at highest risk of SCD because the major bur-
den of SCD lies within this subgroup and is currently not 
accounted for by primary prevention ICD guidelines.3–7 
Furthermore, as we move to an era of precision medi-
cine, an expanding cohort of patients are being identified 
with milder reductions in LVEF in whom optimal therapy 
remains unclear.27 The DANISH trial has reemphasized 
the need to refine our current approaches to risk strati-
fication.8 Although the trial demonstrated a reduction in 
SCD in patients with severely reduced LVEF randomized 
to ICD implantation, this finding was not associated with 
a significant reduction in all-cause mortality because of 
high rates of nonsudden cardiac death and noncardiac 
death.8 In other words, in this population of sick patients, 
ICD therapy simply changed the mode of death but not 
the overall mortality rate. This outcome illustrates the 
importance of selecting patients with a high risk of SCD 
and a low risk of nonsudden death who will be exposed 
to longer periods at risk of arrhythmias and may there-
fore have the most to gain from ICD therapy. Indeed in 
subgroup analysis of the DANISH trial, those patients 
most likely to benefit from ICD therapy were those at low 
risk of nonsudden death, specifically patients <59 years 
of age and those with an N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic 
peptide <1177pg/mL.8 Patients with mild or moderate 
reductions in LVEF have a low risk of nonsudden death 
and are also less likely to have limiting HF symptoms 
compared with those with more severe LV impairment 
and may therefore have the potential to gain a greater 
number of quality-adjusted life years after an aborted 
SCD. Our new data suggest a role for LGE-CMR in the 
identification of patients with less severe LV impairment 
who are at high risk of SCD and low risk of nonsudden 
death and who may therefore benefit from ICD implanta-
tion.
In patients with an LVEF ≥40%, over a median fol-
low-up of 4.6 years, the risk of the primary end point 
in those with midwall LGE was 17.8%. In a similarly de-
signed study with marginally longer follow-up (median 
5.3 years), the risk of SCD and aborted SCD in all-comer 
DCM patients with an LVEF ≤35% was 17.9%, increas-
ing to 27.9% in the subgroup with LGE, but dropping to 
only 11.1% in those without LGE.9 We have therefore ob-
served an approximately equivalent rate of SCD events 
in patients with an LVEF ≥40% and LGE compared with 
all those with an LVEF ≤35%. This observation provides 
support for the CMR-Guide (NCT01918215) randomized 
trial, which aims to evaluate the benefit of ICD therapy in 
patients with LVEF 36% to 50% and LGE.
The greatest increment in SCD risk occurred between 
patients with no LGE and those with the smallest extent 
(0% to 2.5%). This finding was confirmed by analysis of 
Harrell’s c-statistic, which demonstrated an LGE extent 
cutoff of >0% as the best discriminator of event-free sur-
vival time. The lack of a linear dose-response relationship 
between the extent of LGE and the primary end point is 
novel and suggests that binary risk models based on the 
presence or absence of LGE are appropriate rather than 
models that examine risk based on the extent of LGE 
that assume linearity.9,16
Myocardial fibrosis is a widely accepted substrate for 
ventricular arrhythmia, supporting the biological plausi-
bility of the findings. An electromapping study in patients 
with DCM demonstrated LGE in all patients with inducible 
VT or a history of sustained VT and mapped the arrhyth-
mia to the corresponding location.28 In addition, areas of 
fibrosis interacting with channels of healthy myocardium 
in the peripheral heterogeneous zone of the scar have 
been associated with reentry wavefronts and targeting 
of these at catheter ablation reduces VT.29–32 It is there-
fore conceivable that the surface area of the gray zone 
between scar and healthy tissue determines the risk of

VT, rather than the mass of the scar, explaining the lack 
of a dose-dependent association between LGE extent 
and SCD events in our study.17,18
Limitations
This study was performed in a single, large-volume, ex-
perienced center. Although this enables the use of a 
standardized protocol and scan interpretation from the 
same independent operators, it introduces the possibil-
ity of referral bias. We do, however, report similar base-
line characteristics to other registries.13,33 Moreover, 
the referral base is broad, from specialist and nonspe-
cialist centers, and we report a range of common in-
dications for the scan. Data from 193 of 399 patients 
were included in an earlier investigation on all-comers 
with DCM.9 These patients had extended follow-up in 
this study, which is unique in examining a focused clini-
cal question in a targeted population using an alterna-
tive prespecified primary end point to address an unmet 
clinical need.
We also recognize the modest number of events in 
the study. We specified strict criteria for the primary end 
point, excluding appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing, to 
generate the most clinically meaningful data. Within this 
large study, we have identified a strong predictor of clini-
cally important events responsible for a major burden of 
SCD in the DCM population. Based on the event rates in 
this study, a randomized trial of defibrillator therapy ver-
sus medical therapy in patients with an LVEF >40% and 
midwall LGE followed up for 5 years would require 971 
patients to have 80% power to detect a difference in all-
cause mortality at a significance level of 5%, assuming a 
60% reduction in SCD with the intervention. This is com-
parable to the sample size of other large device trials.8
In this study, CAD was not excluded in all cases by cor-
onary angiography. However, LGE-CMR has been shown 
to be as accurate in the diagnosis of the etiology of HF.23 
In addition, the majority of patients who did not undergo 
coronary angiography were ≤40 years of age without a 
history of angina or a family history of premature CAD. 
Only 30 patients, all without a history of angina, were 
˃40 years of age and had no additional investigations 
to exclude CAD. None of the patients suffered an acute 
coronary syndrome or had coronary revascularization 
during the study. Although we accept that CAD cannot 
be definitively excluded in this small group, significant 
CAD is nevertheless unlikely. The small size of this group 
means that this is unlikely to have biased the data to a 
significant extent.
ICD implantation was more frequent in patients with 
LGE; however, our results were consistent after adjust-
ing for this as part of the propensity score analysis (Ta-
ble II in the online-only Data Supplement). Although it is 
possible that the higher rate of ICD implantation reflects 
selection bias, the presence of LGE was not cited as an 
indication for implantation in any case. Among patients 
who had an ICD implanted, the rate of aborted SCD was 
higher in those with LGE compared with those without. 
Furthermore, despite the higher rate of ICD implantation 
in those with LGE, these patients had a higher rate of 
SCD. We acknowledge the limitations of aborted SCD 
as an end point and recognize that a proportion of ar-
rhythmias resulting in appropriate shocks may have ter-
minated spontaneously. However, our data on the asso-
ciation with SCD add robustness. We also recognize that 
a proportion of SCDs may relate to aneurysmal rupture 
and cerebral hemorrhage; however, in the absence of a 
biologically plausible link between LGE and these events, 
the effect would be to dilute the association between 
LGE and SCD rather than enhance it. ICD programming 
was at the discretion of the individual units. We did not 
routinely measure B-type natriuretic peptide, but we have 
included alternative variables that strongly predict prog-
nosis in HF, such as indexed left atrial volume and NYHA 
class. Contemporary CMR techniques such as T1 map-
ping were not available at the outset, but we note a lack 
of consistency in the findings of other studies investigat-
ing its role in outcome prediction, with little evidence of 
incremental value in addition to LGE.34,35
CONCLUSION
For the first time, we demonstrate that in patients with 
DCM and mild or moderate LV systolic impairment who 
do not meet conventional criteria for an ICD, the pres-
ence of midwall LGE identifies a subgroup at high risk of 
SCD. The risk of SCD in this subgroup was comparable 
to that seen in all-comer patients with an LVEF <35%; it 
is important to note that their risk of nonsudden cardiac 
death was low, suggesting that ICD therapy may have 
the potential to reduce all-cause mortality and extend 
quality life.
