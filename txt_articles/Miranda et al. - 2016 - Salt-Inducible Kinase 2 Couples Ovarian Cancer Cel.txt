In Brief
Miranda et al. show that in serous ovarian
cancer SIK2 is overexpressed in
adipocyte-rich metastatic deposits
compared with primary lesions.
Adipocytes induce calcium-dependent
activation and autophosphorylation of
SIK2, which drives tumor cell survival and
metabolism. SIK2 depletion prevents
metastasis in vivo.

SUMMARY
The adipocyte-rich microenvironment forms a niche for ovarian cancer metastasis, but the mechanisms
driving this process are incompletely understood. Here we show that salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is over-
expressed in adipocyte-rich metastatic deposits compared with ovarian primary lesions. Overexpression
of SIK2 in ovarian cancer cells promotes abdominal metastasis while SIK2 depletion prevents metastasis
in vivo. Importantly, adipocytes induce calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation of SIK2. Acti-
vated SIK2 plays a dual role in augmenting AMPK-induced phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in
activating the PI3K/AKT pathway through p85a-S154 phosphorylation. These findings identify SIK2 at the
apex of the adipocyte-induced signaling cascades in cancer cells and make a compelling case for targeting
SIK2 for therapy in ovarian cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Despite high overall initial response to standard chemotherapy
(Muggia et al., 2000), the majority of ovarian cancer patients
die from the progressive growth of recurrent chemotherapy-
resistant disease. The high mortality associated with this tumor
is mainly due to late presentation of metastatic disease that is
almost exclusively confined to the abdominal cavity. One of

Significance
Unlike many solid tumors, high-grade serous ovarian cancers rarely metastasize outside the adipocyte-rich environment of
the abdominal cavity. A major cause of death in ovarian cancer is malnourishment following intestinal obstruction secondary
to abdominal metastasis. Therefore, identifying the mechanisms involved in establishing abdominal tumor metastases is
crucial for appropriate therapeutic intervention. Here we used a combination of ovarian cancer tissue analysis, primary
adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell co-culture, chemical genetics, selective SIK2 inhibitors, and in vivo models of cancer metas-
tasis to demonstrate that SIK2 drives survival and metabolism in ovarian cancer cells following activation by adipocytes. We
believe that these findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer.

 the main sites of ovarian cancer metastasis within the abdomen
is the omentum, which is an adipocyte-rich tissue that covers
the small intestine in the abdominal cavity (Lengyel, 2010;
Pradeep et al., 2014). Previous work has shown that free fatty
acids synthesized by adipocytes enhance ovarian cancer metas-
tasis in fat-rich environments by stimulating fatty acid oxidation
and cancer cell proliferation (Nieman et al., 2011). Due to the
preferential metastatic potential of ovarian cancers to the
abdominal cavity, unraveling the mechanisms controlling this
process may provide disease-specific opportunities for thera-
peutic exploitation.
SIK2 is an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related
protein kinase with a well-established role in the regulation
of metabolism (Dentin et al., 2007; Horike et al., 2003;
Muraoka et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012). We previously showed
that SIK2 is required for ovarian cancer cell proliferation and that
its expression inversely correlates with survival in ovarian cancer
(Ahmed et al., 2010), and that it is also required for proliferation of
prostate cancer cells (Bon et al., 2015). In this work, we tested
the role of SIK2 in ovarian cancer metastasis.
RESULTS
SIK2 Drives Ovarian Cancer Metastasis to the Omentum
In experiments characterizing SIK2 expression in 170 serous
ovarian cancers using a validated SIK2 antibody (Figures S1A–
S1C), we confirmed that SIK2 was overexpressed in high-grade
serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs, Figure S1D) and unexpect-
edly noted that SIK2 expression was higher in omental meta-
stases compared with ovarian primary tumors. We therefore
performed SIK2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paired samples
from ovarian primary tumors and metastatic omental deposits
from 50 patients. Automated quantification confirmed that
SIK2 expression was significantly increased in omental metasta-
ses compared with the ovarian primary tumors (p = 0.0003, t test,
Figures 1A and 1B) with the highest SIK2 level being at the inter-
face between adipocytes and cancer metastasis (Figure 1A). To
test whether SIK2 overexpression promoted peritoneal spread,
we used an established model of ovarian cancer metastasis (Mo-
tohara et al., 2011). SKOv3 cells stably overexpressing SIK2
(SKOv3-SIK2-WT) that were implanted orthotopically at the
ovarian bursa formed significantly larger abdominal metastases
compared with empty vector-transduced cells (Figures 1C and
1D). This observation was validated in an independent experi-
ment measuring tumor weight and the number of metastatic
nodules (p < 0.0001 for each measurement, t test; n = 15 per
group, Figures 1E and 1F). In a further experiment wild-type
SKOv3-SIK2 (SKOv3-SIK2-WT) cells significantly reduced sur-
vival of mice compared with SKOv3 empty vector control cells
(p = 0.01, log rank test, n = 12 mice per group, Figure 1G).
Consistent with the observation in patient samples, we also
found that SIK2 levels were significantly higher in the metastatic
lesions compared with the orthotopic primary implantation site
in empty vector-transduced and SIK2-WT models (p = 0.019
and p = 0.02, one-tailed t test, respectively; Figures 1H and 1I).
To further confirm the role of SIK2 in promoting ovarian cancer
abdominal metastasis, we generated OVCA432 cell lines that
stably overexpressed SIK2-WT, empty vector, or the kinase-
inactive SIK2 K49M mutant (OVCA432-SIK2-WT, OVCA432-
empty
vector,
or
OVCA432-SIK2-K49M,
respectively)
for
independent validation of the mouse experiments at a second
institute. OVCA432-SIK2-WT formed significantly larger and
more frequent metastases that were associated with higher
volume of ascites compared with empty vector-transduced
OVCA432 (p = 0.001, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.002, respectively,
one-way ANOVA, n = 5 mice per group, Figures 1J–1L). Impor-
tantly, the metastatic load in OVCA432-SIK2-K49M was equiva-
lent to that of OVCA432 empty vector control, suggesting
that the enzymatic activity of SIK2 is essential for the increased
metastatic potential.
To test whether endogenous SIK2 is required for the metasta-
tic dissemination of ovarian cancer cells in vivo and validate our
previously reported results (Ahmed et al., 2010; Bon et al., 2015),
we screened 14 ovarian and breast cancer cell lines for pheno-
typic effects following SIK2 depletion, and this confirmed that
SIK2 was required for cancer cell proliferation and AKT phos-
phorylation (Figures S2A–S2D). We also confirmed that deple-
tion of SIK2 in the luciferase-expressing OVCA432 cell line was
possible and that this decreased AKT phosphorylation (Figures
S2E–S2F). Either SKOv3 or luciferase-expressing OVCA432
were implanted into the ovarian bursa of nude mice, and mice
were treated with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcho-
line (DOPC) nanoliposomes carrying either non-targeting small
interfering RNA (siRNA) or SIK2 siRNA as previously described
(Ahmed et al., 2010). We confirmed SIK2 depletion (Figure S2G)
and measured the effect of treatment on both primary tumor size
and metastatic load (Figure 2A). SIK2-targeting siRNAs had a
modest effect on primary tumor (not shown). However, there
was a significant (71%) reduction of the percentage of metastatic
nodules and their weight in both the SKOv3 and the OVCA432
models (p < 0.0001 for each measurement, t test, n = 10 mice
per group, Figures 2B–2E) and in tumor luminescence in the
OVCA432 model (Figures 2F and 2G, p = 0.007, two-way
ANOVA). Note that restricting the analysis to the first 21 days

 demonstrated no significant effect of depletion on tumor burden
(Figures 2F and 2G, p = 0.642, two-way ANOVA), indicating that
equivalent tumor burden was present at the start of the experi-
ment. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SIK2
plays an important role in ovarian cancer metastasis to the
abdominal cavity.

SIK2-driven mechanism by which adipo-
cytes signal to ovarian cancer cells to
promote metastasis. To test this hypoth-
esis,
we
considered
it
important
to
develop a marker to assess SIK2 activity
in cancer cells. As we, and others, have
previously observed autophosphoryla-
tion of SIK2 (Ahmed et al., 2010; Katoh
et al., 2006; Sakamaki et al., 2014), we
reasoned
that
such
phosphorylation
events might be utilized as a direct
readout of SIK2 activity. To identify SIK2
autophosphorylation sites, we generated
and characterized a catalytically active glutathione S-trans-
ferase-tagged truncation of SIK2 (Figures S3A and S3B) for
in vitro kinase assays, mapped the autophosphorylation sites
of SIK2 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-
MS), and identified the autophosphorylation sites S90, S343,
and S358 (Figures 3A and 3B). Interestingly, these residues
have been previously reported as protein kinase A (PKA) phos-
phorylation sites but not as SIK2 autophosphorylation sites
(Henriksson et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2014). Since the S358
was previously reported (Henriksson et al., 2012) to be the key
residue mediating SIK2 protein stability, we developed and

 characterized an antibody for detection of its phosphorylation
(Figures 3C–3H). In vitro, the antibody only detected a signal in
the presence of ATP, indicating that it specifically revealed
pS358 and not the total protein (Figure 3C). The signal was signif-
icantly reduced by the ATP-competitive SIK2 inhibitor HG-9-91-
01 (Clark et al., 2012) and was abolished by l-phosphatase
treatment (Figure 3C). We confirmed that the detected band in
cell lysates was that of SIK2, since siRNA treatment abolished
the band signal (Figure 3D). S358 phosphorylation was depen-
dent on the activity of full-length SIK2 as shown by immunopre-
cipitation of ectopically expressed V5/myc-tagged full-length
SIK2 or its kinase-dead mutants (K49M or T175A) followed by
in vitro kinase assays (Figures 3E–3H). The antibody did not
detect a band for the S358A mutant, further confirming its spec-
ificity for detecting phosphorylation only at the S358 residue (Fig-
ure 3F). Importantly, S358 phosphorylation was not required for
the activity of SIK2 since the S358A mutant retained full kinase
activity (Figures 3G and 3H), as shown by in vitro kinase assays
using ATPgS and an anti-thiophosphate ester antibody. As S358
autophosphorylation is not involved in activating SIK2 (unlike, for
example, T175, Figures 3G and 3H), it was plausible to utilize
pS358 as a readout of SIK2 kinase activity.
The level of S358 phosphorylation directly correlated with the
magnitude of SIK2 activity as demonstrated by the SIK2 inhibitor
HG-9-91-01 in SKOv3 cells that stably expressed wild-type SIK2
(Figure 3I). This effect was not an artifact of the HG-9-91-01 in-
hibitor since the Src inhibitor dasatinib, which we found binds
to SIK2 in vitro (Figures S3A and S3B), also significantly reduced
SIK2
S358
phosphorylation
(Figure
3I).
Interestingly,
we
observed a reduction of the total level of SIK2 protein at higher
inhibitor concentrations, and this is consistent with the previ-
ously reported role of S358 phosphorylation in maintaining the
stability of the protein (Henriksson et al., 2012). This was also
confirmed by comparing the mRNA level and the protein level
of ectopically expressed full-length wild-type SIK2 and the
K49M kinase-dead mutant (Figures S3C–S3E).
We also observed that cells stably expressing a gatekeeper
mutant, SIK2 T96M, had increased SIK2 kinase activity com-
pared with the wild-type SIK2 as evidenced by higher S358
phosphorylation despite comparable levels of SIK2 mRNA (Fig-
ures S3F–S3H). This was akin to the observed effect of the
methionine gatekeeper mutations in tyrosine kinases, which sta-
bilize the catalytically active DFG-in conformation (Azam et al.,
2008; Kornev et al., 2006).
We performed in vitro kinase assays in the presence or
absence of recombinant PKA and found that although PKA
was able to phosphorylate SIK2 as previously reported (Henriks-
son et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2014), the majority of the detected
phosphorylation was due to autophosphorylation (Figures S3I
and S3J).
To unequivocally confirm that S358 is indeed a SIK2 auto-
phosphorylation site and to identify substrates for SIK2 that
might contribute to the establishment of omental metastases,
we conducted a chemical genetic screen (Figure 4A). This
approach takes advantage of a conserved ‘‘gatekeeper resi-
due,’’ which is in close proximity to the adenine ring of ATP
(Eblen et al., 2003). Mutating this residue to a smaller amino
acid creates additional space and allows the kinase to utilize
‘‘bulky’’ N6-substituted ATP analogs, which cannot be accepted
by wild-type kinases (Eblen et al., 2003). By utilizing an analog
which also carries a g-thiophosphate (ATPgS), substrate pro-
teins of the mutant kinase are specifically thiophosphorylated
and can be isolated either by immunoprecipitation (Allen et al.,
2005) or a covalent capture approach (Blethrow et al., 2008;
Carlson and White, 2012).
We confirmed the previously reported position of the gate-
keeper residue (T96) (Clark et al., 2012) by sequence alignment
with kinases that have previously been rendered analog sensi-
tive, including ERK2 (Eblen et al., 2003), CDK1 (Ubersax et al.,
2003), and AMPKa2 (Banko et al., 2011) (Figure S4A). The
T96G mutant, but not the wild-type kinase, was capable of utiliz-
ing the ‘‘bulky’’ N6-benzyl- and N6-phenylethyl-ATPgS analogs
(Figure 4B). We then generated SKOv3 cell lines stably overex-
pressing SIK2 T96G or wild-type and cultured them in heavy or
control SILAC media, respectively, allowing a quantitative com-
parison of the two (Carlson and White, 2012). Cell lysates were
incubated with the bulky N6-phenylethyl-ATPgS in vitro and
analyzed by western blotting (Figure 4C). Lysate containing the
T96G mutant had extensive thiophosphate labeling compared
with almost none in the wild-type, demonstrating specific thio-
phosphorylation of SIK2 substrates (p = 0.009, t test, Figure 4D).
Analysis of labeled digested lysates confirmed that SIK2 S358
was indeed an autophosphorylation site (Figures 4E and S4B).
Neither S90 nor S343, which we observed using LC-tandem
MS (MS/MS) analysis of recombinant SIK2, were detected in
this screen. Interestingly, we also identified a phosphorylation
site at S154 on p85a (PI3KR1), the regulatory subunit of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. Since we previously
reported a possible link between SIK2 and AKT activity (Ahmed
et al., 2010), this observation suggests a direct mechanism for
modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by SIK2.

(A) Schematic representation of the chemical genetic screen approach. SKOv3 cells stably overexpressing SIK2 wild-type or T96G are cultured in either light-
(R0K0) or heavy-labeled (R10K8) SILAC, respectively. Equal amounts of lysate (by protein mass) from each cell line are separately incubated with a ‘‘bulky’’
ATPgS analog, which is specifically used by the T96G mutant to label SIK2 substrates. Following protein precipitation to remove any remaining analog, both
samples are mixed together and subjected to proteolytic digestion. Thiophosphorylated peptides are then covalently captured on an iodoacetyl resin and eluted

 ovarian cancer cells significantly activated SIK2 and induced the
phosphorylation of AKT in SKOv3-SIK2-WT cells with no increase
in SIK2 transcription (Figures S5A and S5B). Targeted depletion
of SIK2 revealed that it was required for adipocyte-induced
AKT phosphorylation (Figure 5B). Adipocytes also significantly
(p = 0.0006, t test) increased the proliferation of SKOv3 ovarian
cancer cells that expressed endogenous levels of SIK2, as indi-
cated by crystal violet staining of co-cultured cells (Figure S5C).
Targeted depletion of SIK2 or its chemical inhibition prevented
the adipocyte-mediated increase in cancer cell proliferation
(p > 0.05 for depletion or chemical inhibition, one-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by Tukey’s test, Figures 5C and 5D). PI3K inhibition also
prevented the adipocyte-mediated increase in cancer cell prolif-
eration (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, Figure S5D)
indicating that the PI3K pathway is also required for adipocyte-
induced proliferation.
Previous work has established that freshly isolated adipocytes
induce ovarian cancer cell proliferation through a mechanism
that is dependent on free fatty acids (FFAs) and that FFAs were
required for abdominal metastasis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo
(Nieman et al., 2011). PLC is a known mediator of FFA receptor
signaling (Ichimura et al., 2009) that in turn increases intracellular
calcium levels, resulting in activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-depen-
dent protein kinases, which are known to activate AMPK (Woods
et al., 2005). We therefore asked whether intracellular calcium
levels could also modulate SIK2 activity and mediate adipo-
cyte-induced SIK2 activation. Calcium chelation using the
cell-permeable chelator BAPTA-AM (Figure 5E) significantly
decreased SIK2 S358 phosphorylation (Figures 5F and 5G) in a
dose-dependent manner (r = �0.72, Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient, p = 0.008), whereas preventing the uptake of calcium
to the ER using the sarco-ER Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump
blocker thapsigargin significantly increased the cytoplasmic
calcium levels (Figure 5E) and induced SIK2 activation (Figures
5H and 5I).
We characterized the FFA composition of the omentum from
three subjects with no ovarian cancer (Figure S5E) and
confirmed that two of the three most represented fatty acids in
the normal human omentum, oleic and linoleic acids, increased
the intracellular calcium concentration in SKOv3 cells, with oleic
acid showing a significant dose-response effect (p < 0.01, one-
way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test, Figure S5F).
We next tested the role of calcium in mediating the effect of ad-
ipocytes in activating SIK2. Calcium chelation using BAPTA-AM
blocked SIK2 activation in cancer cells that were co-cultured
with adipocytes and, consequently, blocked AKT phosphoryla-
tion (Figures 5J and 5K). These results confirm that SIK2 activa-
tion by adipocytes is dependent on the increase in intracellular
calcium and that SIK2 activation is required for adipocyte-
induced AKT activation.
Since PLC stimulation is known to occur downstream of FFA
signaling (Ichimura et al., 2009), we tested whether small-mole-
cule agonists of PLC could activate SIK2. The PLC agonist
m-3M3FBS significantly increased intracellular calcium concen-
tration (Figure 5E) and SIK2 S358 phosphorylation (Figures 5H
and 5I). SIK2 activation by PLC required an increase in intracel-
lular calcium, since calcium chelation using BAPTA-AM pre-
vented SIK2 phosphorylation (Figures 5H and 5I). PLC-induced
SIK2 S358 phosphorylation was abolished by treatment with
HG-9-91-01 SIK2 inhibitor but not by using the PKA inhibitor
H-89 (Figures S5G and S5H). This indicated that PKA was not
involved in PLC-dependent SIK2 phosphorylation at S358 in
ovarian cancer cells and that this pathway specifically induced
SIK2 activation, in contrast to forskolin treatment (Figure S5I).
This strongly suggested that SIK2-independent mechanisms,
such as PKA activation, are required for S358 phosphorylation
upon forskolin treatment, as previously reported (Patel et al.,
2014).
Since calcium-induced activation of AMPK is independent of
LKB1, a known master regulator of the AMPK family of kinases
(Lizcano et al., 2004), we tested whether calcium-induced SIK2
activation was also independent of LKB1. LKB1 depletion did
not block the thapsigargin-mediated increase in SIK2 S358
phosphorylation or AKT phosphorylation (Figure S5J). This
confirmed that the observed activation of SIK2 following calcium
induction was independent of LKB1. Taken together, the
above data confirm that adipocytes induce SIK2 activation in
ovarian cancer cells through the increase in intracellular calcium
concentration.
SIK2 Activation Is Required for Adipocyte-Induced
Metabolic Effects in Ovarian Cancer Cells
Since SIK2 is known to indirectly regulate the transcription of key
genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and to regulate fatty acid
oxidation (Du et al., 2008; Muraoka et al., 2009; Park et al., 2014),
we tested whether it was required for adipocyte-induced fatty

 acid oxidation. Consistent with previous work, we found that co-
culture of adipocytes with SKOv3 cells significantly increased
the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which
is a critical enzyme responsible for acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) trans-
fer to mitochondria for initiation of fatty acid oxidation. SIK2 inhi-
bition significantly reduced the adipocyte-mediated increase in
CPT1 expression, indicating that SIK2 was required for fatty
acid oxidation (Figure S6A). CPT1 expression was higher in
omental metastases compared with primary tumors in patients
with HGSOCs, consistent with the increased omental SIK2
expression (Figure S6B).
Adipocytes are known to increase the phosphorylation of
AMPK and consequently inactivate acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC) through its phosphorylation at S79 (Munday et al., 1988;
Nieman et al., 2011; Winder et al., 2000). Since ACC inhibition
is required for increased CPT1 expression, we hypothesized
that SIK2 could modulate the activity of ACC. SIK2 directly phos-
phorylated ACC in vitro and this was additive to AMPK-induced
phosphorylation (p < 0.05, Friedman non-parametric test, Fig-
ures 6A and 6B). In cells, SIK2 inhibition decreased the
phosphorylation of ACC in the SIK2-WT but not in the SIK2-
T96M inhibitor-resistant cells, indicating that SIK2 specifically
increased the phosphorylation of ACC (Figures 6C and 6D).
Exposure of ovarian cancer cell lines OVCA432 or SKOv3 that
expressed endogenous levels of SIK2 to adipocytes increased
ACC phosphorylation, but not in the presence of HG-9-91-01
(Figure 6E). Treating OVCA432, Hey, and A2780 cell lines with
either m-3M3FBS or thapsigargin significantly increased ACC
and AKT phosphorylation. These effects were blocked by HG-
9-91-01 treatment (Figure 6F).
To directly test the effect of SIK2 on fatty acid oxidation,
which occurs in mitochondria and is dependent on respiration
and oxygen consumption in cells, we first measured the
extracellular oxygen consumption (EOC) in several cell lines
following glucose starvation to identify suitable culture condi-
tions for analysis. The OVCA432 cell line showed evidence of
significant EOC following overnight reduction of glucose to
either 5 mM, 1 mM, or complete starvation, with the latter giving
the highest magnitude of EOC (not shown). In contrast, other
cell lines tested (SKOv3, OVCAR3, and Hey) required incuba-
tion for at least 1 week in 5 mM glucose before it was possible
to observe EOC (not shown). EOC was dependent on fatty acid
oxidation since the irreversible inhibition of CPT1 using eto-
moxir (Woods et al., 2005) abolished EOC (Figure S6C) in
contrast to PI3K inhibition using A66, which only had a
minor effect (not shown). Treatment using HG-9-91-01 signifi-
cantly reduced the EOC rate in multiple cell lines (p < 0.001,
paired t test, Figure 6G) and in a dose-dependent manner
(p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, Fig-
ure S6D), indicating that SIK2 is required for fatty acid oxidation
and mitochondrial respiration.
These data indicate that SIK2 collaborates with AMPK in inhib-
iting ACC and in promoting fatty acid oxidation in ovarian cancer
cells following adipocyte-induced stimulation.
The Regulatory Subunit of PI3K Is a Direct Catalytic
Target of SIK2
Previous work has established that omental metastases had
significantly higher AKT phosphorylation compared with ovarian
primary tumors (Nieman et al., 2011). We therefore next sought
to determine how SIK2 modulates the PI3K-AKT pathway. We
tested p85a, the regulatory subunit of the PI3K complex, since
it was identified as a putative SIK2 substrate in our chemical
genetic screen (Figures 4E and S4B). The identified p85a
phosphorylation site (S154) resided in the known SIK2 phos-
phorylation consensus sequence L-x-[HKR]-[ST]-x-S-X(3)-L at
L149-L158 (LYRTQSSSNL). Incubation of recombinant, full-
length SIK2 or its kinase domain with a peptide corresponding
to L149–L158 of p85a confirmed that SIK2 catalyzes the phos-
phorylation of this sequence (Figure S7A). To confirm that
p85a is a direct substrate of SIK2, we demonstrated that the
SIK2 kinase domain catalyzed phosphorylation of full-length
p85a as shown by incubation with g-[32P]ATP or ATPgS (also
note the SIK2 autophosphorylation signal, confirming our previ-
ous results) (Figures 7A and 7B). Importantly, ectopically ex-
pressed full-length SIK2, but not the kinase-inactive K49M
mutant, phosphorylated p85a in vitro (Figure 7C). Phosphopep-
tide mapping of p85a following incubation with SIK2 (kinase
domain or full-length) revealed that it was phosphorylated at
S154 in the BH domain, confirming the results of the chemical
genetic screen, and S541 in the iSH2 domain (Figures 7D and
7E). Both of these domains have been previously shown to
play important roles in regulating p110 catalytic activity (Liu
et al., 2014). We generated antibodies against phospho-S154
and phospho-S541 and performed in vitro kinase assays using
wild-type p85a or mutated forms, and confirmed that they

measurements presented in the line graph.

 were both SIK2 phosphorylation targets (Figures 7F and S7B).
The BH domain is thought to bind to proteins that modulate
PI3K activity (Chagpar et al., 2010; Musacchio et al., 1996; Tolias
et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 1994). Examining the structure of the
iSH2 domain in complex with p110 indicated that S541 was in
close proximity to the strongly positively charged surface of
p110 (Figure S7C) and the positively charged R534 of p85a.
Consistent with this notion, the R534A p85a mutant was effec-
tively transcribed in mammalian cells but not expressed at pro-
tein level. This loss of protein expression was rescued by the
expression of the positively charged R534K or the negatively
charged R534E mutants, confirming the importance of electro-
static interactions in this region for the stability of the protein (Fig-
ures S7D and S7E). In contrast to the pS154 antibody that was
highly specific for detecting the phosphorylated form of p85a
and sensitive to changes in SIK2 activity in an in-house optimized
ELISA test (Figure S7F), the pS541 antibody was less specific
(Figure S7B). We therefore focused our downstream validation
on S154 phosphorylation, which also appeared to increase in a
SIK2-dose-dependent manner (Figure 7G). SIK2 siRNA-medi-
ated depletion or chemical inhibition confirmed that it was
required for p85a S154 phosphorylation in SKOv3 cells (Figures
7H and 7I). Immunoprecipitation of the activating SIK2 T96M
mutant induced higher phosphorylation of p85a at S154
compared with the wild-type kinase (Figure 7J). SKOv3-T96M
cells induced significantly higher AKT phosphorylation com-
pared with SKOv3-WT cells (Figure 7K). Moreover, thapsigar-
gin-mediated intracellular calcium increase and SIK2 activation
also increased p85a phosphorylation at S154 compared with
the untreated cells (Figure 7L), indicating that p85a phosphoryla-
tion and concomitant AKT phosphorylation can be triggered by
calcium-mediated SIK2 activation. Consistent with these obser-
vations, incubation of the PI3K complex with recombinant SIK2
led to a profound increase in PI3K activity in vitro (up to 13.8-
fold), while chemical inhibition of SIK2 induced a dose-depen-
dent reduction in PI3K activity (Figures 7M and S7G) down to
its basal level. These data confirm that p85a is a direct catalytic
substrate of SIK2 and that SIK2 S154 phosphorylation signifi-
cantly increases the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway in ovarian
cancer cells.
p85a Phosphorylation Is Required for SIK2-Driven PI3K
Pathway Activation
In cells it was difficult to reliably assess the effect of p85a muta-
tions on PI3K activity, due to variation in protein expression
despite equivalent levels of transcription between p85a-WT
and p85a-S154A (data not shown). In addition, consistent with
previous findings (Cuevas et al., 2001), we observed that p85a
overexpression significantly reduced AKT phosphorylation, pre-
sumably by competing with the PI3K complex for phospho-Y-
peptides at the cell membrane as we previously reviewed (Liu
et al., 2014). To test the effect of p85a mutations on AKT phos-
phorylation and the robustness of the observation of SIK2-medi-
ated PI3K activation, we utilized an alternative well-established
system for inducing PI3K activation through treatment with low
doses (2 nM) of rapamycin (O’Reilly et al., 2006) (Figure S8).
SIK2 depletion in two independent ovarian cancer cell lines
significantly reduced rapamycin-induced AKT phosphorylation
and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to its cytotoxic effect (Figures
8A and 8B). Low doses of rapamycin activated SIK2 as evi-
denced by the increased S358 phosphorylation (Figures 8C
and 8D). As SIK2 S358 has been previously reported as a phos-
phorylation site for AKT2 (Dentin et al., 2007), we asked whether
the observed SIK2 phosphorylation was secondary to AKT acti-
vation. SIK2 inhibitors blocked rapamycin-induced SIK2 phos-
phorylation in cells stably expressing wild-type SIK2 but not
the inhibitor-resistant T96M mutant (Figures 8C and 8D). This
confirmed that SIK2 was activated by rapamycin in ovarian can-
cer cells and that this event was upstream of the observed AKT
phosphorylation. Finally, we generated stable cell lines express-
ing wild-type p85a or its mutated form S154A, which cannot be
phosphorylated by SIK2, and found that p85a-S154A expression
significantly reduced rapamycin-induced AKT phosphorylation
(p < 0.001, t test, Figures 8E and 8F). This confirmed that S154
phosphorylation is crucial for the observed PI3K activation and
consequent AKT phosphorylation. Taken together, these results

 demonstrate that SIK2 phosphorylation of p85a S154 is required
for SIK2-dependent activation of the PI3K pathway in ovarian
cancer cells.
DISCUSSION
In this work we used a combination of direct analysis of high-
grade serous ovarian cancer tissue, adipocyte-cancer cell co-
culture, chemical biology, and protein biochemistry to unravel
a previously unrecognized role of SIK2 in coupling metabolism
with survival at the cancer metastatic niche. We show that
SIK2 is activated by co-culture with adipocytes and that upon
activation, SIK2 directly phosphorylates ACC and PI3K and,
thus, simultaneously regulates both fatty acid oxidation and
cancer cell proliferation and survival. We believe that targeting
SIK2 offers an important therapeutic opportunity in preventing
abdominal metastasis in ovarian cancer.
Ovarian cancer cells metastasize almost exclusively to the
adipocyte-rich environment in the abdominal cavity (Lengyel,
2010; Pradeep et al., 2014). The most common cause of death
in ovarian cancer patients is intestinal obstruction and malnutri-
tion secondary to abdominal metastasis. Understanding the
mechanisms involved in metastasis of ovarian cancer to the
abdominal cavity is, therefore, an important research priority
(Bowtell et al., 2015). Our results demonstrate that adipocytes
activate SIK2 through the PLC/intracellular Ca2+ pathway, result-
ing in PI3K activation and ACC phosphorylation. It is highly plau-
sible that additional SIK2 phosphorylation downstream targets
may play important roles in the adipocyte-induced SIK2 activa-
tion pathway. For example, given the recently described role of
SIK2 in modulating the function of members of the HDAC family
of enzymes (Ozanne et al., 2015; Walkinshaw et al., 2013) and
their role as potential therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer
(Chen et al., 2011), it will be of interest to investigate the potential
link between SIK2 and HDACs in ovarian cancer. In addition,
since metastasis is a multi-step process, we cannot exclude
the possibility that SIK2 may play additional roles in the metas-
tasis process such as regulating adhesion or invasion.
Lizcano et al. (2004) reported that LKB1, a putative tumor-sup-
pressor kinase and a master regulator of members of the AMPK
superfamily, phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue
(T175) in the T loop of the SIK2 kinase domain and that this phos-
phorylation is essential for SIK2 catalytic activity. Although it is
clear that in certain cellular contexts LKB1 may act as a potential
tumor suppressor, recent evidence suggests that it plays an
important role in promoting survival of spheroids derived from
ascites of ovarian cancer patients or ovarian cancer cell lines
(Peart et al., 2015). We provide strong evidence in this study
that LKB1 is not essential for SIK2 catalytic activity. Moreover,
kinase assays from our work and several other investigators
(Katoh et al., 2006; Sakamaki et al., 2014) show that SIK2 auto-
phosphorylation (and thus its catalytic activity) or SIK2-induced
phosphorylation of peptide or full protein substrates is triggered
by the addition of ATP in vitro, confirming that LKB1 is not essen-
tial for the catalytic activity of SIK2.
We observed that SIK2 S358, a residue known to be a sub-
strate of AKT2 and PKA (Dentin et al., 2007; Henriksson et al.,
2012), was also a site of autophosphorylation. In adipocytes,
S358 phosphorylation by PKA seems to be important for
14-3-3 binding, stabilization, and relocalization (Henriksson
et al., 2012). In mouse primary hepatocytes SIK2 S358 phos-
phorylation is induced following glucose treatment without
altering SIK2 kinase activity (Patel et al., 2014). Other reports
suggest an inhibitory effect of PKA on SIK2 following glucagon
treatment (Wang et al., 2012). We believe that these discrep-
ancies can be explained by the previously unreported observa-
tion that S358 is not only a transphosphorylation site but also a
site of autophosphorylation.
Recent work has unraveled the role of crosstalk between can-
cer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in inducing
aberrant production and transport of metabolic intermediates
such as lactate, glutamine, and fatty acids, all of which can be
utilized by cancer cells for the production of energy (Romero
et al., 2015; Suh et al., 2014). Cancer cells have been shown to
induce important changes in adipocytes that favor dedifferentia-
tion, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and production of
FFAs for consumption by cancer cells (Romero et al., 2015). Un-
derstanding the key pathways that are involved in such crosstalk
between cancer cells and the so-called tumor-associated adipo-
cytes will identify important therapeutic opportunities in ovarian
cancer. In this work, we propose that SIK2 is a key modulator of
proliferation and fatty acid oxidation that is activated by the inter-
action with adipocytes at the metastatic niche.
In summary, we propose SIK2 as an attractive candidate for
the treatment of ovarian cancer. Small molecules targeting
SIK2 will have the potential to block two major pathways that
contribute to the establishment and growth of tumor metastasis.

Fresh omental tissue was obtained from surgically resected normal metas-
tasis-free omentum of patients with benign ovarian tumors. Omental tissue
samples were collected prospectively within a translational study that was
ethically approved (Number 11/SC/014, Berkshire NRES Committee), and all
subjects gave informed consent. The tissue was dissolved in digestion buffer
(DMEM/F12 [Gibco]/0.1% BSA [Sigma]/0.2% collagenase type I [Gibco]),
incubated at 37�C for 1 hr, and centrifuged at 300 3 g for 1 min. The superna-
tant fraction containing adipocytes was washed three times with wash buffer
(Hank’s balanced salt solution + 0.2% BSA). The remaining upper yellow layer
containing the adipocytes was used for co-culture with ovarian cancer cells.
Mouse Ovarian Tumor Models
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from CLEA Japan or from the National Cancer
Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, and were
bred and maintained according to institutional guidelines. All animal experi-
ments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the animal
ethics committee of Keio University or the MD Anderson Cancer Center Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
(E and F) SKOv3-empty vector and SKOv3 stably expressing V5-tagged p85a wild-type (SKOv3-p85-WT) or its mutated form p85a S154A (SKOv3-p85-S154A)
were treated with either diluent or rapamycin (2 nM), and immunoblotting was performed using the indicated antibodies (E). In (F), bar plot shows means + SEM of
band fluorescence intensities of AKT pS473 for rapamycin-treated cells normalized to DMSO-treated cells from three independent replicates.

 Transplantation assays were performed as previously described (Motohara
et al., 2011). In brief, cancer cells were suspended in DMEM-F12 and injected
orthotopically into 7-week-old nude female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were then
incubated for up to 6 weeks or until they became moribund. Mice were eutha-
nized and tumors extracted from either primary or metastatic sites were
paraffin-embedded for IHC. For monitoring the effect of depletion of SIK2,
ovarian cancer cells were injected directly into the left ovary of anesthetized
female nude mice. Seven days after cell injection, mice were randomly divided
into two groups: (1) control siRNA/DOPC and (2) Sik2 siRNA/DOPC (n = 10
mice per group).
Measuring Extracellular Oxygen Consumption
EOC was determined using the EOC assay kit (Abcam) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions.
Detailed additional methods are available in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
