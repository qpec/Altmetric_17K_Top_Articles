Abstract
Previous studies have demonstrated that the Pleistocene saber-toothed cat Smilodon fatalis
had many forelimb adaptations for increased strength, presumably to grapple with and sub-
due prey. The Rancho La Brea tar pits yield large samples of juvenile limb bones forming a
growth series that allow us to examine how Smilodon kittens grew up. Almost all available
juvenile limb bones were measured, and reduced major axis fits were calculated to deter-
mine the allometric growth trends. Contrary to expectations based on their robust limbs,
Smilodon kittens show the typical pattern of growth found in other large felids (such as the
Ice Age lion, Panthera atrox, as well as living tigers, cougars, servals, and wildcats) where
the limb grows longer and more slender faster than they grow thick. This adaptation is
thought to give felids greater running speed. Smilodon kittens do not grow increasingly more
robust with age. Instead, they start out robust and follow the ancestral felid growth pattern,
while maintaining their robustness compared to other felids. Apparently, the growth of felid
forelimbs is highly canalized and their ontogeny is tightly constrained.
Introduction
For decades, paleontologists have noted that saber-toothed cats, such as the North American
Pleistocene Smilodon fatalis, are more robustly built (Fig 1) than most felids [1–10]. Most
recent authors have concluded that saber-toothed predators probably killed their prey with
quick slashing bites to the throat, using powerful forelimbs to hold the prey down during
attack [2–10]. Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh [9] used X-radiographs to show that
Smilodon forelimbs were more robust and had thicker cortical bone than comparable bones of
most other similar-sized felids.
But how and when did Smilodon kittens acquire their robust forelimbs as they grew? Do
they have a more robust growth pattern than other felids, or do they achieve this robustness by

 other means? Very few fossil mammals are known from enough juvenile limb bones to assess
this question. However, the collections of late Pleistocene fossils from Rancho La Brea tar pits
yield thousands of bones of Smilodon fatalis and the contemporary tiger-sized felid Panthera
atrox, including hundreds of juvenile bones in various ontogenetic stages (Fig 2). These are
among the few fossil collections in the world that allow research in postnatal ontogenetic
allometry.
Until recently, there was very little published literature on postnatal ontogenetic allometry
of living mammals to allow comparison with the fossil samples at Rancho La Brea. Kilbourne
and Makovicky [11] provided the first published data on postnatal long-bone growth in several
living felids, including the tiger (Panthera tigris), the cougar (Puma concolor), the Old World
wildcat (Felis silvestris), and the serval (Leptailurus serval). Their data and analyses provide a
standard to which we can compare juvenile bones of La Brea felids.
Kilbourne and Makovicky [11] found that many living felids show evidence of more rapid
growth of the length of their distal limb elements, relative to their cross-sectional area, so their
limbs become more gracile as they grow. This is a common adaptation of many cursorial
mammals, which have lengthened their distal limb elements (radius, ulna, tibia) relative to
bone shaft thickness. Biomechanical studies have shown that this decreases the rotational

 inertia in longer-limbed animals [12, 13]. In this study, we compare the tiger-sized Panthera
atrox to determine whether it grew to its adult body proportions in the same way as do modern
tiger kittens. We also wanted to see if Smilodon fatalis kittens grew up with the same changes
in their limb proportions as other felids, or with a more robust ontogenetic limb growth pat-
tern than other felids.
Materials and methods
We measured nearly every unbroken juvenile humerus, radius, femur, and tibia of S. fatalis
and P. atrox in the collections of the La Brea Tar Pits Museum (formerly the George C. Page
Museum) to get the largest sample size possible for this analysis. These specimens have a vari-
ety of different catalogue numbering systems, but all come from the main curated collection in
the La Brea Tar Pits Museum. Catalogue numbers of all specimens are given in the original
data tables (S1 Table, S2 Table). Sample sizes are given in Tables 1–8; original data are given in
the Supplementary Tables. Measurements were made following the protocols of Kilbourne
and Makovicky [11], focusing on measuring the length of the diaphysis of the shaft of each
bone. In the case of adult or subadult bones, measurements of shaft length were made from the
diaphyseal-epiphyseal sutures. Measurements shorter than 460 mm were made with metric
digital calipers; those over 460 mm, and circumference measurements, were made with a flexi-
ble metric measuring tape. In addition to measuring diaphysis length, we measured midshaft
circumference, and two linear measures of the midshaft: lateral width and antero-posterior
depth. This allowed us to compare diaphysis lengths to both circumference, and also cross-sec-
tional area.
Basic statistics and regressions were calculated and plotted using Microsoft Excel. Although
they do not state it clearly, Kilbourne and Makovicky [11] plotted length on the ordinate and
circumference on the abscissa, so that convention is followed here as well. Following the con-
ventions of allometric studies, raw data were log-transformed using natural logs, and plotted
in log-log space, so that the exponential slope of allometry would give a simple linear slope.
We used Excel to calculate the simple least-squares regression of the data. Since there is no
dependent or independent variable in this study, as the least-squares regression method

 assumes, we adopted the more commonly used Reduced Major Axis (RMA) method of corre-
lation to determine the slope between the two variables (calculated using the “smatr” software
routine for the R software package) (S3 Table). This software package also calculates the slope
confidence interval (CI). However, we found there were slight differences between our RMA
results and those published by Kilbourne and Makovicky [11], even when we analyzed their
original data with the R software package. Consequently, in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7, we calculated
all our own results, rather than reprint the numbers given by Kilbourne and Makovicky [11].
We followed the conventions of Kilbourne and Makovicky [11] in plotting length vs. cir-
cumference, which should give an isometric slope in log-log space of approximately 1.0 (linear
dimension vs. linear dimension). This allowed us to compare our results to the data of living
mammals examined by Kilbourne and Makovicky [11]. We also calculated cross-sectional area
and compared it to shaft length, to see if it scaled along the expected isometric slope of 2.0
(length vs. area), or if it was significantly allometric with a slope very different from 2.0. Sup-
porting information is available elsewhere (S1 Table and S2 Table)
Results
Length vs. circumference
Our results are plotted in Figs 3 and 4, and reported in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7. Using a least-
squares regression analysis first, we found very high correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from
0.793 to 0.932 in S. fatalis, which had larger sample sizes, and from 0.733 to 0.906 for P. atrox,
which had fewer specimens. Least-squares regression slopes ranged from 1.0–1.5 in S. fatalis,
suggesting that all its limb bones became more robust as it grew, and from 0.7 to 1.2 in P.
atrox, with the front limbs giving more robust slopes, and the hind limbs close to isometric
growth. In every case, the least-squares regression slopes of the La Brea cats were in the same
range of values as the slopes for living cats, suggesting that they have very similar growth
trends.
Since there is no independent or dependent variable in this analysis, we calculated a
reduced major axis instead of using the least-squares slope. First, we examined P. atrox (Fig 3),
whose limbs might be expected to grow more gracile like those of a tiger or any other very
large cat. The RMA slope for the humerus (Fig 3B) is 1.32, almost identical to the 1.36 slope of
the tiger and most other living cats, and statistically gracile. The hind limb RMA slopes are
1.63 for the femur (Fig 3F) and 1.08 for the tibia (Fig 3H), again suggesting gracile to isometric
growth in these limbs, and very similar to the gracile slopes seen in the living felids. Interest-
ingly, the radius gives a slope of 0.34 (Fig 3D), which would indicate robust proportions. How-
ever, this is based on only eight specimens, the smallest sample in the entire study, so it might
be affected by small sample size and inadequate range of sizes from smallest juveniles to adults.
Likewise, the confidence interval for the RMA of most of the P. atrox is relatively large because
of the small sample sizes, so the slopes of most of the limbs are not significantly different from
isometric growth.
What about the slopes for Smilodon? Do they grow more robust, as predicted from previous
research, or are they gracile like other cats? The humerus RMA slope (Fig 3A) is 1.65 and the
radius RMA slope (Fig 3C) is 1.44, which are as gracile or more gracile than nearly all the other
cats in the study, so they do not show a growth pattern of increasing robustness, contrary to
expectations. There is no expectation that the hind limbs would be particularly robust, and
indeed their RMA slopes are 1.65 for the femur (Fig 3E) and 1.71 for the tibia (Fig 3G), the
most gracile of all the cats in this study. Due to the large sample sizes, nearly all the Smilodon
slopes are statistically significant, and small confidence intervals show they are significantly
different from the isometric slope, and even from other comparably sized cats like the tiger.

 Length vs. cross-sectional area
The results of the comparisons of length vs. cross-sectional area are shown in Tables 2, 4, 6 and
8, and Figs 3 and 4. The RMA slopes for both S. fatalis and P. atrox on all four limbs range
from 0.40–0.77, which are very close to the 0.5 slope for isometric growth expected for a linear
dimension vs. a squared dimension. The least squares results also give slopes in 0.4–0.7 range,
consistent with the RMA slopes. This is a bit different from the isometric to gracile slopes of
length vs. circumference, but clearly by this measure, they do not appear to be noticeably
robust, nor is S. fatalis much different from P. atrox. Unfortunately, there are no published
data for the length vs. area of limb bones in living cats to compare to, so the meaning of this
result cannot be assessed comparatively.
Discussion
As many paleontologists have long demonstrated, Smilodon forelimbs show many robust fea-
tures of their shafts and articular surfaces (Fig 1), compared to other large cats of comparable
size [1–10]. For example, the forelimb bones of S. fatalis are roughly the same length as those
of the tiger, P. tigris, but the shafts of the humerus, ulna and radius are noticeably thicker in S.
fatalis than in P. tigris, and they have broad articular surfaces with much heavier bony ridges
and processes. As Meacham-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh [9] demonstrated, S. fatalis also
has thickened cortical bone as compared to other similar-sized cats. However, we have neither
the expertise nor the access to the appropriate equipment to exam the change in cortical thick-
ness through growth. Based on the results of this study, however, we predict that the cortical
thickness of forelimb bones in Smilodon will be relatively thicker than that of any other felid,
even in the youngest kittens.
Thus, there is no question that based on adult bones, S. fatalis was much more robust in its
forelimbs than other felids of comparable size. This is consistent with the idea that they were
ambush predators rather than pursuit predators, and used their powerful forelimbs to quickly
wrestle prey to the ground and pin it before slashing its vulnerable throat or belly with their
saber-like canines.
However, there is no relative increase in robustness during growth of the forelimbs of Smi-
lodon kittens compared to other felids (Figs 3 and 4, Tables 1–8). Instead, the dimensions of
these bones follow the same trends as in other large cats, and nearly all their limbs (including
the forelimbs) scale with the same gracility as other large cats.
If saber-tooth kittens grew with the same gracile trends as other large felids, how did they
achieve their remarkably robust adult forelimbs? It is clear that the felid hallmark of increasing
gracility of the limb bones during ontogeny was not changed by the need for robust limbs in
adult Smilodon. Saber-tooth kitten growth does not override the canalized pattern of develop-
ment of most felids to have long, gracile development of their limbs for running.
Instead, saber-tooth kittens achieved their adult limb proportions by starting out with rela-
tively robust limbs when they were young kittens (Fig 5). In Fig 5, the growth curve of saber-
tooth kittens has the same slope as those of tiger or cougar kittens, but it is shifted toward the
more robust direction in the axes. For the same length, the saber-tooth kitten forelimb element
(humerus or radius) always has a larger circumference than a comparably sized tiger or cougar.
This is also indicated by the Y-intercept of the regression line of the humerus and radius,

 which was always higher in Smilodon than in the tiger (Tables 1 and 3). Thus, the unique fea-
tures of robustness in S. fatalis forelimbs are achieved by starting with robust juvenile limb
proportions, and they did not reprogram or override the primitive growth pattern of gracility
inherent in felid ontogeny.

case, the slope of their growth trend is the same, showing that all large felids grow along a common pattern emphasizing gracile forelimbs and cursoriality.
However, the robustness of adult Smilodon forelimbs is achieved not by shifting the slope of the growth curve toward more robust directions in the axes, but by
starting with more robust limbs as a kitten and maintaining the same growth trends as found in other felids. A. Humerus. B. Radius.
