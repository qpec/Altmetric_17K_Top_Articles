Abstract
Background
The objective was to estimate temporal associations between mental disorders and physi-
cal diseases in adolescents with mental-physical comorbidities.
Methods
This article bases upon weighted data (N = 6483) from the National Comorbidity Survey
Adolescent Supplement (participant age: 13–18 years), a nationally representative United
States cohort. Onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edi-
tion lifetime mental disorders was assessed with the fully structured World Health Organi-
zation Composite International Diagnostic Interview, complemented by parent report.
Onset of lifetime medical conditions and doctor-diagnosed diseases was assessed by self-
report.
Results
The most substantial temporal associations with onset of mental disorders preceding onset
of physical diseases included those between affective disorders and arthritis (hazard ratio
(HR) = 3.36, 95%-confidence interval (CI) = 1.95 to 5.77) and diseases of the digestive sys-
tem (HR = 3.39, CI = 2.30 to 5.00), between anxiety disorders and skin diseases (HR =
1.53, CI = 1.21 to 1.94), and between substance use disorders and seasonal allergies
(HR = 0.33, CI = 0.17 to 0.63). The most substantial temporal associations with physical
diseases preceding mental disorders included those between heart diseases and anxiety
disorders (HR = 1.89, CI = 1.41 to 2.52), epilepsy and eating disorders (HR = 6.27, CI =
1.58 to 24.96), and heart diseases and any mental disorder (HR = 1.39, CI = 1.11 to 1.74).

 Conclusions
Findings suggest that mental disorders are antecedent risk factors of certain physical dis-
eases in early life, but also vice versa. Our results expand the relevance of mental disorders
beyond mental to physical health care, and vice versa, supporting the concept of a more
integrated mental-physical health care approach, and open new starting points for early dis-
ease prevention and better treatments, with relevance for various medical disciplines.
Introduction
As the health of young people contributing to future population health and global economic
development has been neglected yet, it has now become a ‘pressing issue’ [1]. The World
Health Organization (WHO) and key medical journals such as the Lancet are dealing with the
challenges that non-communicable diseases and mental disorders are imposing on the health
care systems, and it has been claimed that these conditions need to be considered in global
efforts in improvements of health, social policy, and health-care delivery [2–4].
The relevance of the integration of mental and physical health arises from adult studies doc-
umenting the systematic co-occurrenceof mental disorders and physical diseases [3, 5–10].
Findings from longitudinal studies suggest that depression may be a risk factor for the develop-
ment of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease [11–
13], autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis [14], asthma,
back pain, and migraines [12]. Temporal associations between depression and rheumatoid
arthritis as well as respiratory diseases seem to be bidirectional [12, 15, 16]. Furthermore, post-
traumatic stress disorder has been found to precede coronary heart disease [17], type II diabe-
tes [18], and respiratory diseases [19], whereas irritable bowel syndrome may be an antecedent
risk factor of epilepsy [20]. The healthcare significance of mental-physical comorbidity is
underlined by diminished quality of life and unfavorable course of disease [21], substantial
healthcare costs, higher treatment demand, longer treatment duration, and impaired treatment
response in persons with mental-physical comorbidity [22, 23]. Integrating mental and physi-
cal health has gained attention and advanced into the focus of major journals, current strategic
research goals and task forces [24–26].
Despite this relevance, the understanding of mental-physical comorbidity in children and
adolescents is scarce, even though some studies support a relationship between mental disor-
ders and physical diseases already during childhood or adolescence [27–35]. First evidence
from longitudinal studies suggest that epilepsy may be a risk factor for the development of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [36], that asthma may precede affective and anxiety
disorders [37, 38], and that eating disorders may be an antecedent risk factor of a variety of
physical diseases [31]. These studies, however, mostly used clinical samples and focused on
selected mental or physical problems, and it has been suggested to further develop the life
course perspective [39].
The current understanding of the etiology of mental-physical comorbidity is largely based
on theoretical models attempting to explain how mental disorders and physical diseases come
to be comorbid. These theories suppose that one condition operates as risk factor for the other,
or that shared risk factors underlie both mental disorders and physical diseases [5, 40]. How-
ever, studies providing implications regarding trajectories in the development of mental-physi-
cal comorbidity are lacking. Therefore, knowledge on the temporal course of conditions has
been claimed as highly relevant [41, 42].

applied for access to the data set, they had to
complete the application form including
information on the scope of the research project,
the principal investigators, and the need for the
restricted data. Furthermore, they had to prepare a
data protection plan in which they specified how
data would be handled to prevent unauthorized
persons from gaining access to the data. The
principal investigators had to sign a restricted data
use agreement specifying the terms of the use of
the data. Further research staff with access to the
data had to sign a supplemental agreement. All
researchers who would be working on the project
had to provide their curriculum vitae. Additionally,
on the website of the ICPSR it is stated that
researchers who want to apply for restricted data
need to have an appointment at a research
institution and an academic degree (possibly
doctorate). ICPSR is a large and well-established
institution specifically aimed at providing long-term
data access. Therefore, data storage at ICPSR
ensures that data are well-documented and
accessible in the foreseeable future. In the rare
case of modifications to data in the repository (e.g.

 To better understand the developmental trajectories of mental-physical comorbidity, the
main objective of this study was to estimate in adolescents with mental-physical comorbidity
the temporal association of mental disorders and physical diseases, using data on the age of
onset of a wide range of mental and physical morbidities from a representative national cohort
study.
Methods
Study sample
We based this study on data of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Sup-
plement (NCS-A), a national representative survey of initially 10148 United States (US) adoles-
cents (ages 13–18), of which 10123 were students at the time of the survey. Data collection took
place between February 2001 and January 2004 [43–45]. Further details on the study protocol
of the NCS-A have been describedpreviously [34, 43, 44, 46]. We based our analyses on a sub-
sample of 6483 NCS-A participants for which parents or guardians completed a Self Adminis-
tered Questionnaire (SAQ), as describedpreviously [34]. Details on the subsample for which
no parent report was available, and differences between these two subsamples, are available in
supplementary Table 1 of a previous publication that was based on the same dataset [35]. Ado-
lescent and parent provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by
the Human Subjects Committee of Harvard Medical School and the University of Michigan.
Diagnostic Assessment
Mental disorders. To assess lifetime mental disorders, trained interviewers administered a
computer-assisted version of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
Version 3.0 [45, 46]; details have been describedpreviously [43, 47]. Additional information
on adolescents’ mental health was collected from parents or guardians based on the SAQ focus-
ing on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder,
major depressive disorder, and dysthymic disorder, because collecting information from
parents about those disorders has been found to be diagnostically valuable [48–50]. Informa-
tion from adolescents and parents was combined. A mental disorder was considered present
when diagnostic criteria were met either based on information obtained from adolescent or
parent, and, in case of discrepancies, the earlier age was used as age of onset.
We grouped specific mental disorders into the following disorder categories: Any affective
disorder (major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and bipolar I or II disorder), any anxiety disor-
der (agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, panic disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, and separation anxiety disorder), any behavior disorder (atten-
tion deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder), any
substance use disorder (alcohol abuse or dependency and drug abuse or dependency),any eat-
ing disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder). If an adolescent,
based on either adolescent or parent report, fulfilleddiagnostic criteria for more than one dis-
order with a certain disorder category, we used the earliest age as age of onset of the respective
disorder category.
Physical diseases. The lifetime presence (‘yes’
, ‘no’) and the age of onset of physical dis-
eases were assessed solely with adolescent self-report, based on a checklist on chronic condi-
tions, which has been applied in the US National Health Interview Survey in similar form [51].
Checklists have been extensively used in national studies [51–54]. It has been shown that chil-
dren are able to reliably and validly report on their health already at early life stages [55–57]. In
this respect, self-report and medical records show good concordance [58], with checklists

 Statistical analyses
We used weighted data in all statistical analyses, which were conducted with STATA/MP 11
(Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). Weights were provided with the NCS-A dataset,
and had been calculated based on a wide range of sociodemographicvariables with regard to
[43, 44] to ensure representativeness of the NCS-A study sample with the US adolescent popu-
lation. We estimated temporal relationships between mental disorders and physical diseases by
calculating separate discrete-time proportional hazard models with a non-parametric baseline
hazard function using complementary log-log regression, with one of the major classes of men-
tal disorders or ‘any mental disorder’ and one physical disease or ‘any physical disease’ defined
as outcome and as time-varyingpredictor, respectively, and vice versa [60]. We present hazard
ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. If diagnostic criteria for more than one mental

 disorder were fulfilledwithin a mental disorder class, we used the age of onset of the first men-
tal disorder in this class as age of onset of the total class. As we had to deal with complex survey
data, we applied the Taylor series linearization method. In accordance with previous studies
[61, 62], we included sociodemographicvariables shown in Table 1 in our analyses to control
for potential confounding. Adjusted results are presented. To account for the large number of
pairwisetest, we used an internal subsampling strategy, as previously described[34, 63].
For a low number of subjects information on physical diseases from adolescent self-report
was missing. We restricted each analysis to subjects with complete data (see Figs 1 and 2 for
completer sample sizes according to each physical disease category). We defined statistical sig-
nificance at 0.05 and two-sided tests were applied.

Temporal prediction of physical diseases by mental disorders
Results of the adjusted discrete-time proportional hazard models estimating the temporal asso-
ciations between physical diseases and mental disorders, with mental disorders preceding phys-
ical diseases, in the total sample are presented in Fig 1 (results from subsamples available on

Discussion
This article provides temporal association estimates of lifetime mental disorders and physical
diseases, based on data from 6483 adolescents of a nationally representative cohort. The most
substantial results indicate that affective disorders are a risk factor of arthritis and diseases of
the digestive system, that anxiety disorders are a risk factor of skin diseases, and that substance
use disorders are a protective factor of seasonal allergies. Vice versa, heart diseases may indicate
a risk of anxiety disorders and any mental disorder, and epilepsy a risk of eating disorders.
Our results contribute to previous findings on mental-physical comorbidity mostly resulting
from association studies in clinical or population-based samples in adults and documenting
comprising relationships between mental disorders and physical diseases [3, 5, 6], including
the comorbidity patterns observedin the present study [65–70]. However, as yet, there has
been no evidence suggesting a link between substance use disorders and allergies [71], and
even though comorbidity between epilepsy and mental disorders has been describedin chil-
dren [28, 30], epidemiologicaldata on the co-occurrenceof epilepsy and eating disorders are
lacking.
There is rare evidence from adult intervention trials providing insight into the developmen-
tal trajectories of co-occurringmental disorders and physical diseases. A contribution of
depression in arthritis is supported by a study demonstrating benefits of improved depression
care that extended beyond reduced depressive symptoms and included decreased pain in older
adults with arthritis and comorbid depression [72]. That anxiety may precede the onset of skin
diseases is elucidated by studies of patients with atopic dermatitis reporting improvement in
anxiety levels and skin conditions after psychotherapy [73, 74]. For eating disorders and epi-
lepsy, it has been hypothesized based on case reports, that epilepsy arising from a right hemi-
spheric focus and right frontal intracerebral lesions–with their close relationship to the limbic

 system–could play a role in the development of eating disorders [75, 76]. This view is sup-
ported by the emerging importance of antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of eating disorders
[77]. Finally, for affective disorders preceding diseases of the digestive system, our findings are
in line with positive associations between current depression and subsequent disease activity in
adult patients with Crohn’s disease or the development of ulcers in previously ulcer-free sub-
jects [78, 79].
In contrast to findings from meta-analyses of studies in adults [80, 81], our data do not sug-
gest anxiety as a risk factor of heart diseases, which may be due to the young age of subjects, as
anxiety-induced pathophysiological processes might take decades to develop. Vice versa, the
prognostic relevance of cardiovascular diseases for anxiety disorders is less clear in the adult lit-
erature. Even though there is some evidence for increased anxiety levels after myocardial
infarction [82–84], prospective data providing pre-infarction information is mostly not avail-
able, and studies addressing causality are lacking.
Different biological, behavioral, cognitive, and social pathways mediating the relationships
between mental disorders and physical diseases have been proposed, but even though study
designs to inform about developmental trajectories have already been applied successfully [85],
specific comorbidity patterns remain to be determined [5, 40, 86]. Until then, the available data
may help to generate hypotheses on the nature of these pathways.
With regard to depression and arthritis, previous work documents the pain-enhancing
potential of brain circuits that may be disturbed in depression [87] and, vice versa, the analgesic
effects of antidepressants [88], indicating that depression-related brain networks might con-
tribute to the etiology of arthritis. Further pathway candidates are the immune system and the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as local inflammation, followed by a systemic
reaction, and inappropriately low secretion of cortisol are typical features of arthritis [89, 90],
and disturbances of the immune system and the HPA axis have been describedin persons with
depression [91, 92].
Regarding depression-related onset of diseases of the digestive system, the pathophysiology
of the brain-gut axis, involving the corticotropin-releasing factor system [93] may play a role
[94], as experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that acute and chronic stress have
impacts on the gastrointestinal system, being permissive in the development of gut diseases
[95].
In terms of potential mechanisms underlying the observedprediction of skin diseases by
anxiety disorders, it is of note that psychological stress has not only been associated with atopic
dermatitis symptom severity [96], but also with various skin health-relevant immune alter-
ations, including slowed wound healing and augmented induction of inflammatory processes
and immunoglobulin E (IgE) production [97, 98]. To date, there is only preliminary evidence
on the psychoneuroimmunology of anxiety disorders, suggesting that high levels of anxiety
might be associated with impaired cellular immunity and IgE synthesis [99, 100].
The reduced risk of seasonal allergy related to substance use disorders in our study may be a
consequence of increased consumption of certain substances, for example alcohol, and related
immunological changes [101–103], but such positive consequences should be interpreted with
caution as it is well established that substance use disorders are associated with increased risk
of morbidity and mortality [104].
Body perception and interoceptive conditioning may contribute to the heart disease-related
increased risk of anxiety disorders [105]: Heartbeat sensitivity has been shown to be increased
in persons suffering from congenital heart diseases compared to healthy controls [106] and
studies using heartbeat perception tasks in anxiety disorders support the notion of higher inter-
oceptive sensitivity towards the heartbeat as etiological factor in anxiety diseases [107].
Changes in neuronal structure and function resulting from epileptic seizures [108], possibly

 contribute to the risk of eating disorders related with epilepsy. A systematic review of case
reports concluded that although simple changes in appetite and eating behavior occurredwith
hypothalamic and brain stem lesions, the characteristic psychopathology of eating disorders
was associated with right frontal and temporal lobe damage [109]. On a molecular level, it has
been documented that 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C, G protein-coupled
(HTR2C)-receptor-deficient mice showed disturbed feeding behavior and were prone to spon-
taneous death from seizures, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptors may play a role in linking eat-
ing disorders and epilepsy [110].
Strengths of our study include the large nationally representative sample [43], the broadness
of mental disorders and physical diseases included, the use of a fully structured diagnostic
interviewfor the assessment of mental disorders, with good quality criteria [43, 47], and the
integration of child and parent information [50]. Good response rate and the minimal amount
of missing data make it unlikely that loss of subjects has introduced selection bias. Still, the
results of this study should be interpreted in light of several limitations; some have been dis-
cussed previously, including self-report measures of physical diseases [34], the cross-sectional
design, and the use of retrospective data, involving the risk of recall bias [46, 111]. Specifically,
the wording of the questions in the physical diseases checklist in the CIDI ("Did a doctor or
other health professional ever tell you that you had any of the following illnesses. . .") might have
led to underestimated values, because to positively answer any of these questions the adolescent
must have sought a health professional and recalled the diagnosis.
However, a suitable longitudinal dataset allowing studying the chronology of onset of men-
tal disorders and physical diseases in mental-physical comorbidity patterns is lacking while
needed to corroborate our findings. Until then, these findings are important to guide future
research by providing hypotheses, not least given the novel probing strategy of the National
Comorbidity Surveys that has been shown to increase the accuracy of age of onset reports
[112]. Moreover, the young and relatively homogenous age range of NCS-A participants within
the peak-onset period of mental disorders [113] diminishes the risk of potential bias by age-
related impairment in the recall of age of illness onset [114]. Furthermore, lifetime prevalence
estimates (reported by our group for the main categories of mental disorders and for physical
diseases in [34] and in [62] for specific mental disorders) and age of onset distributions of men-
tal disorders and physical diseases (see S4 Table) are generally in line with previous findings
[115–134]. Still, participants could have been rather young at disease onset that could have
occurreda decade or more prior to the assessment. This might have introduced recall bias.
However, as already mentioned, previous work demonstrated that children’s self-reports on
their health are largely reliable and valid [55–57].
Moreover, according to the risk-factor concept by Kraemer and colleagues [135] and due to
the cross-sectional design of the study, the presented findings cannot inform about ‘causal risk
factors’ but rather about ‘risk factors’ defined as factors preceding the outcome. Besides the
temporal relationship, other aspects suggesting causality [136] may be considered, including
the strengths of the relationships, for example those between affective disorders and arthritis,
with HRs > 3, the specificity of associations, their mechanistic plausibility as discussed above,
as well as evidence from the few intervention trials or consistency with the few prospective
studies depicted above. Finally, we restricted our analyses to the main categories of mental dis-
orders and physical diseases instead of focusing on subcategories. This hampered integration
of results into the literature but ensured sufficient number of cases for each comorbidity pat-
tern, thereby complying with statistical assumptions.
Given the high lifetime prevalence of some comorbidity patterns [34, 35], the partly sub-
stantial temporal relationships between lifetime mental disorders and physical diseases, and
the high burden for the individual and health economics [21–23, 66], our findings carry

 relevance for psychiatric and medical health care and the roles of psychiatrists and other medi-
cal specialists in patient management [26], and they can inform research priorities and guide
task forces, health policy plans and medical education [137]. In line with current strategic
research goals [24, 25, 138], our results may pave the way to improve diagnostic approaches,
prevention and treatment of mental-physical comorbidity, for example by considering that
treatment of a mental disorder may have implications for a physical disease, and vice versa
[139].
A large body of evidence from the WHO World Mental Health Survey documented that the
epidemiology of mental-physical comorbidity in adults is comparable worldwide [5], suggest-
ing that the temporal course of onset of mental disorders and physical diseases in adolescents
might as well be similar worldwide. However, generalizability of our findings from an adoles-
cent sample on an adult population might be limited, for instance, due to the increasing influ-
ence of lifestyle-related factors across the lifespan and, hence, the rather late onset of certain
physical disorders [140–142].
Future studies should, besides surveyinglongitudinal data, include subclinical manifesta-
tions of mental disorders and physical diseases, for example using non-invasive measures of
arterial structure and function for heart diseases, that occur before the onset of symptoms, in
order to better understand the temporal sequence of the relationships. Additionally, it may be
worth scrutinizing the comorbidity of mental and physical conditions with regard to the rele-
vance of age of onset, duration of the conditions, and temporal distance between ages of onset
(in future studies). Moreover, randomized-controlled intervention trials in representative pop-
ulations and animal models would be important to shed light on the causality and underlying
biological, psychological and behavioral mechanisms of the relationships between mental dis-
orders and physical diseases that we revealed, to foster the development of interdisciplinary
preventive approaches and interventions, including the development of clinical guidelines deal-
ing simultaneously with mental disorders and physical diseases [143].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of the temporal associa-
tion of mental disorders and physical diseases in adolescents with mental-physical comorbidity
in a nationally representative survey, based on data from 6483 subjects. The most substantial
results indicate that affective disorders may increase the risk of arthritis and diseases of the
digestive system, that anxiety disorders may increase the risk of skin diseases, and that sub-
stance use disorders may decrease the risk of seasonal allergies. Vice versa, heart diseases may
indicate a risk of anxiety disorders and any mental disorder, and epilepsy a risk of eating disor-
ders. The clear temporal relationships between mental disorders and physical diseases for spe-
cific comorbidity patterns suggest that certain mental disorders may be risk factors of certain
physical diseases at early life stages, and vice versa. These results predominantly expand the rel-
evance of mental disorders in adolescence beyond mental health care to physical health care,
and vice versa, supporting the concept of integrative care, and open new starting-points for
early disease prevention and better treatments, which is relevant for various medical
disciplines.
