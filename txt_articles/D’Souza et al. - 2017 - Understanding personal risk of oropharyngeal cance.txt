Background: Incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer is increasing. There is interest in
identifying healthy individuals most at risk for development of oropharyngeal cancer to inform screening strategies.
Patients and methods: All data are from 2009 to 2014, including 13 089 people ages 20–69 in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), oropharyngeal cancer cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER 18) registries (representing �28% of the US population), and oropharyngeal cancer mortality from National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS). Primary study outcomes are (i) prevalence of oncogenic HPV DNA in an oral rinse and gargle sample,
and (ii) incident oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer.
Results: Oncogenic oral HPV DNA is detected in 3.5% of all adults age 20–69 years; however, the lifetime risk of oropharyngeal
cancer is low (37 per 10 000). Among men 50–59 years old, 8.1% have an oncogenic oral HPV infection, 2.1% have an oral HPV16
infection, yet only 0.7% will ‘ever’ develop oropharyngeal cancer in their lifetime. Oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was higher in
men than women, and increased with number of lifetime oral sexual partners and tobacco use. Men who currently smoked and
had �5 lifetime oral sexual partners had ‘elevated risk’ (prevalence ¼ 14.9%). Men with only one of these risk factors (i.e. either
smoked and had 2–4 partners or did not smoke and had �5 partners) had ‘medium risk’ (7.3%). Regardless of what other risk
factors participants had, oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was ‘low’ among those with only �1 lifetime oral sexual partner
(women ¼ 0.7% and men ¼ 1.7%).
Conclusions: Screening based upon oncogenic oral HPV detection would be challenging. Most groups have low oncogenic
oral HPV prevalence. In addition to the large numbers of individuals who would need to be screened to identify prevalent
oncogenic oral HPV, the lifetime risk of developing oropharyngeal caner among those with infection remains low.

Introduction
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most commonly sexually
transmitted infection in the United States. HPV now causes
�70% of all oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPC) in the
United States [1] and the incidence of HPV-related OPC (HPV-
OPC) among men has more than doubled over the past 20 years
[2]. Indeed, OPC is projected to be more common than cervical
cancer in the United States by 2020 [3]. Given the ‘epidemic’ of
HPV-OPC, there is interest in identifying specific groups that
could benefit from screening, if effective tests were developed.
Sexual behaviors responsible for exposure to oral HPV infec-
tion are common (80% of the US population reports ever per-
forming oral sex) [4]. Given the ubiquitous exposure to HPV
infection and resulting anxiety [5], there is interest in identifying
healthy individuals most at risk for development of OPC. As
oncogenic oral HPV infection is the precursor to malignancy,

 identification of individuals with oncogenic oral HPV infection
may point to individuals with premalignant disease. Such risk tri-
age could both inform screening approaches and assist the public
in understanding personal risk. This analysis therefore aims to
understand how common HPV16, oncogenic HPV and HPV-
OPC are in groups of people with different risk factor profiles.
Methods
Study population
This study included 13 089 people ages 20–69 years old who participated
in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
between 2009 and 2014 and had oral HPV DNA testing. Analyses involv-
ing number of oral sex partners were limited to ages 20–59, with data for
number of oral sex partners, resulting in a sample size of 9425. Incidence
and incidence-based mortality data from SEER 18 registries between
2009 and 2014 [6] were used with NCHS mortality data for projections of
OPC risk.
HPV measurement
As previously described [7, 8] oral HPV DNA was tested in exfoliated
cells collected from an oral rinse and gargle sample using PCR amplifica-
tion using PGMY 09/11 consensus primers and line blot for the detection
of 37 specific HPV types. Oncogenic oral HPV was defined as detection
of any of the following 12 types: HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56,
58, 59 [9].
Analytic methods
Analyses of NHANES oral HPV data were weighted by Mobile
Examination Center (MEC) exam sampling weights, and conducted
using SUDAAN software (release 11.0.1, Research Triangle Institute) to
account for survey sample design. Projected OPC risk was calculated
using DevCan software [10].
To better understand subgroup risk, prevalence of oncogenic HPV
and HPV16 were explored stratifying by multiple factors including sex,
sexual behavior, age, and current smoking. Groups with similar preva-
lence were combined to create parsimonious risk stratification of people
with similar prevalence.
Results
Oncogenic oral HPV and oral HPV16 infection are rare in the
general US population. As expected, prevalence of infection is
higher among men than women of every age group (oncogenic
HPV; 6.0% versus 1.1%, P < 0.001; Table 1). Prevalence of onco-
genic oral HPV is contrasted with risk of OPC in Table 1 by sex
and age groups. While oncogenic oral HPV is detected in 3.5% of
all adults age 20–69, the lifetime risk of OPC is low (37 per
10 000). For example, among men 50–59 years old, 8.1% have an
oncogenic oral HPV infection, 2.1% have an oral HPV16 infec-
tion, yet 0.7% will ‘ever’ develop OPC in their lifetime; and risk of
developing OPC in the next 10 (0.2%) or 20 (0.4%) years is even
lower (Table 1).
While prevalence of oncogenic oral HPV infection is low, the
distribution of infections is not representative of the population
(supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Indeed 84% of oncogenic oral HPV infections in 20- to 69-year
olds were among men. To elucidate why oncogenic oral HPV was
more concentrated among certain groups, behavioral characteris-
tics were considered. Performing oral sex and smoking are each
strongly associated with detection of oncogenic oral HPV

 (Table 2) and HPV16 (supplementary Table S2, available at
Annals of Oncology online). Oncogenic oral HPV prevalence is
low (<2.5%) among both men and women who never performed
oral sex. Prevalence of oncogenic oral HPV increased with num-
ber of lifetime oral sexual partners, up to 14.4% in men age 20–
59 years old with �10 lifetime oral sexual partners (Table 2).
Oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was explored by sex, sexual
behavior, and tobacco use to better understand groups that have
higher and lower prevalence (Figure 1). Regardless of what other
risk factors participants had, oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was
low among those with only �1 lifetime oral sexual partner (wom-
en ¼ 0.7% and men ¼ 1.7%). Oncogenic oral HPV prevalence
doubled among women with �2 versus 0–1 lifetime oral sexual
partners (1.5% versus 0.7%, P ¼ 0.02), but remained low among
women with higher number lifetime oral sexual partners
(Table 2). Oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was highest among
men who currently smoked and had �5 lifetime oral sexual part-
ners (14.9%, 95% CI ¼ 11.4–19.1). Men with only one of these
risk factors (i.e. either smoked and had two to four partners or
did not smoke and had �5 partners) had ‘medium risk’, with
7.3% (95% CI ¼ 5.8–9.1) oncogenic oral HPV prevalence
(Figure 1). Findings were similar when considering oral HPV16
infection specifically.
Discussion
This analysis highlights that the yield of oncologic oral HPV
screening would be limited in most groups in the United States.
With the increasing incidence of OPC, there is a need to

 understand how to identify individuals at risk of OPC.
Oncogenic oral HPV detection is attractive as it samples the rele-
vant epithelium in a non-invasive method, has relatively low cost
and serves as a biomarker for HPV-OPC. However, for screening
to succeed, a high prevalence population is needed to limit false
positives, and balance the psychologic and physical harms of
screening with the benefits.
From this analysis, it is clear that screening based upon onco-
genic oral HPV detection would be challenging. Women across
all categories have low prevalence of infection and low risk of
OPC and therefore benefits of screening are unlikely to outweigh
harms in this group. The higher prevalence of oncogenic oral
HPV in men than women is thought be due to both a higher per
partner risk of acquisition when performing oral sex [11, 12], and
decreased clearance among men than women [11, 13]. While
there are specific risk groups of men enriched for oncogenic oral
HPV, most men have low prevalence of infection. Even among
the elevated risk group, the majority of men do not have a preva-
lent oncogenic oral HPV. In addition to the large numbers of
individuals who would need to be screened to identify prevalent
oncogenic oral HPV, the lifetime risk of developing OPC among
those with infection remains low [11, 14].
These characteristics suggest that other tests will need to be
combined or supplant present methods to accurately identify
those with the greatest risk of OPC in the population. Serum
HPV oncoprotein antibody tests are specific [15], but are even
rarer than oral HPV16 infection [16], so may be impractical to
use in most groups. An additional challenge for screening is that
precursor lesions for HPV-OPC have not been found and the
ability to detect lesions early in an ‘elevated-risk’ group is
unknown.
With growing appreciation of the relationship between oral
sex, infection, and cancer, some individuals have questions about
their risk of having oncogenic oral HPV infection. To address
Figure 1. What is my risk of oral HPV? Prevalence of oral HPV16 and any oncogenic oral HPV infection by risk group. In the ‘very low-risk’
group (among women with 0–1 lifetime oral sexual partners), oncogenic oral HPV was similar among smokers and nonsmokers (1.8% versus
0.5%, P ¼ 0.26). In the ‘low-risk’ group of women, oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was 1.5% among women with two or more lifetime oral sex-
ual partners. In the ‘low-risk’ group of men, oncogenic oral HPV prevalence was 1.7% among men with 0–1 lifetime oral sexual partners and
was higher among men who did not smoke and had 2–4 lifetime oral sexual partners (4.1%, P ¼ 0.0042). In the ‘medium risk’ group, oral
HPV16 prevalence was 7.1% among men who smoke and had 2–4 partners and 7.4% among men who do not smoke and had 5þ partners
(P ¼ 0.87).

 concerns about infection among individuals with high number of
oral sex partners or others concerned about their cancer risk, the
infographic can be used to reassure that oncogenic oral HPV
prevalence is low among most groups. This analysis has several
imitations. Data on oral HPV infection were cross-sectional, with
no information linking HPV and SEER data used for cancer risk.
Comparing oncogenic oral HPV prevalence and OPC risk in this
way informs potential future screening studies, and personal risk
assessment. In summary, this analysis shows that screening based
upon oncogenic oral HPV infection will not be useful and
presents data to communicate to the layperson the low risk of
infection and cancer.
