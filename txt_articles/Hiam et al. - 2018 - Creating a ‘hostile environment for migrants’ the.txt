migrants’: the British government’s use of
health service data to restrict immigration is
a very bad idea

Abstract: In January 2017, the UK Government made public a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the Department of Health, National Health Service
(NHS) Digital and the Home Office. This Memorandum allows for the more expedited
sharing of a patient’s non-clinical data, specifically from the NHS England to the Home
Office. The Government justified the MoU as in the ‘public interest to support effective
immigration enforcement’. In this review, we seek to unpack this justification by
providing, first, a background to the MoU, placing it in the context of creating a ‘hostile
environment’ for migrants – a project initially sought by Theresa May in her time as
Home Secretary. We then explore the potential impact of data sharing on individual
health, public health and on health professionals. We conclude that the MoU could
threaten both individual and public health, while placing health professionals in an
unworkable position both practically and in terms of their duties to patients around
confidentiality. As such, we agree with colleagues’ position that it should be suspended,
at least until a full consultation and health impact assessment can be carried out.

Introduction
In 2017, a fire in a tower block – Grenfell Tower – in which at least 80 people died,
revealed a deep divide in the UK’s population (McKee, 2017). Councillors in one

 of the wealthiest parts of the country had ignored safety concerns long voiced by
some of their poorest residents, many of whom were migrants (Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea, 2017). In the aftermath of the fire, the deep divisions
became further apparent, as some of these migrants declined health care and other
public services, fearful of the threat of detention and deportation (Gordon, 2017).
Such fears were likely influenced by several very public changes to health care and
public services, in which the British Government overtly targeted migrants in
order to reduce overall net immigration. These changes included the extension of
charges for using the National Health Service (NHS) (Steele et al., 2014), as well as
a recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) allowing NHS Digital – the
provider of information, data and IT systems to the NHS in England – to share data
on individuals with the Home Office. The announcement, by British Prime Minister
Theresa May, of a year-long amnesty for undocumented migrants did little to assuage
fears, and charities across London responded by establishing support and even a
temporary health care clinic for those in need, safe from immigration authorities
(Adamson, 2017; Doctors of the World, 2017; Hiam, 2017).
While the impact of the new charging regime is explored elsewhere (Steele et al.,
2014; Britz and McKee, 2016; Hiam and McKee, 2016), we seek to understand
the possible consequences of the MoU and resulting data disclosure. Casla et al.
(2017) recently highlighted some of these concerns, including the right of health to
all. Here we explore these in more detail, beginning by placing it in the context of
the Government’s other policies on access to health care, before examining the
effects it may have on the health of the individual, the population and on health
care professionals. We concur with Casla et al. that there is a need for more
detailed consideration of the MoU, and call for its suspension until a full public
consultation and reassessment of its impacts is undertaken.
Background to the memorandum
While eligibility for free treatment by the NHS has never been absolute or
universal, in recent years, the UK Government has increasingly enforced the
principle that the service is only available to those ‘ordinarily resident’ in the
United Kingdom. In April 2015, the Government changed how the NHS in
England charges migrants, visitors and former residents of the United Kingdom
for hospital treatment. First, an immigration health charge (or ‘surcharge’)
payable by non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals who apply for a visa to
enter or remain in the United Kingdom for more than 6 months was introduced,
and subsequently increased in cost. Second, the Government also increased the
scale and scope of charging for NHS services for those not eligible for free-at-the-
point-of-use care. Those who are not ‘ordinarily resident’ – that is, those who are
not ‘broadly, living in the UK on a lawful, voluntary and properly settled basis for
the time being’ (NHS, 2017a) – who have not paid the levy are to be charged for
non-urgent secondary care, including non-emergency hospital services, mental

 health and community care. From October 2017, non-NHS providers of NHS
care, such as charities, will be required to charge for such care, and a requirement
of upfront charging will be introduced, unless this would delay urgent or imme-
diately necessary care (NHS, 2017b).
As a result, NHS bodies are now obliged both to check the status of a patient
presenting to their service against flags placed on the patient file indicating status,
while obtaining from the patient information about their residency status to
identify whether they should be charged and, if they incur debts, to pass this
information back to the Home Office (Department of Health, 2012). An
outstanding NHS debt of £500 is now a basis for refusal of right to remain,
and potentially leading to removal from the UK according to amendments to
Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules (UK Government, 2016; Home Office,
Department of Health, NHS Digital, 2017). In this way, charging for NHS ser-
vices is now linked to immigration enforcement. In addition, responsibility for
surveillance of migrants has been dispersed throughout the public sector, and
among landlords and banks, amongst others, who must determine residence sta-
tus before providing services (UK Government, 2013).
In practice, however, numerous issues with departmental sharing of informa-
tion for the purposes of immigration enforcement have been identified. First, the
system for transferring information between various NHS bodies and the Home
Office was dysfunctional, plagued by burdensome administrative processes. Prior
to January 2017, NHS Digital only identified the area in which the individual was
registered as a patient, while the Home Office had to contact local NHS organi-
sations to obtain their contact information (Gordon, 2017). This required a series
of actions by many different parties, using several systems.
The MoU sought to simplify this situation, allowing NHS Digital to trace the
personal data of the individual and supply it directly to the Home Office, thereby
cutting out the need to contact local NHS bodies for information (Gordon, 2017).
The Government justified the MoU on the basis that there is a ‘substantial public
interest in sharing this non-clinical information to support effective immigration
enforcement’ and for protection of people who might be at risk (Gordon, 2017).
The agreement came into force on 1 January 2017, without a public consultation
ever taking place. The Government only undertook a limited stakeholder review,
justifying the lack of consultation and review on the basis that the MoU was only
for the ‘operationalisation of existing functions’ (Gordon, 2017).
These functions are grounded in Section 261 of the Health and Social Care Act
2012. Section 261(5)(e) allows disclosure in connection with investigation of a
criminal offence. Section 261(5)(d) permits disclosure where it is necessary, or
expedient, for the NHS to have information for the purpose of exercising its
functions under or by virtue of any provision of any Act. Section 261(5)(c) allows
disclosure where it is necessary or expedient for the purposes of protecting the
welfare of the individual. Any disclosure of data is subject to consideration of
individual circumstances, the person to whom the information is disclosed, and

 the purpose of the disclosure. NHS digital is required, by Section 261(5)(e), to take
account of common law that would otherwise prohibit or restrict the disclosure,
weighing the public interest in favour and/or against disclosure. It must do this on
a case-by-case basis. The public interest justification offered for breaching confi-
dentiality is for ‘maintaining effective immigration controls’, as ‘it is in the public
interest that limited UK resources and public services (including the NHS, jobs,
schools, housing) are protected from unnecessary financial and resource
pressures’ (Home Office, 2017).
However, on closer inspection, this statement is somewhat problematic. First, it
ignores mounting evidence that problems facing many public services, particularly
health and social care, reflect cuts in public funding under the guise of austerity
(Loopstra et al., 2015, 2016; Hiam et al., 2017). In fact, although difficult to
assess the estimated cost to the NHS of EEA and non-EEA visitors is ~1.8% of
the total NHS England spend (Appleby, 2013). It also ignores any public interest
in protecting public health, and having a health system that preserves con-
fidentiality and is trusted.
The Government has acknowledged that ‘the increased transparency enabled by
the MoU and Review may itself have an effect [of deterring immigrants seeking
health services]’ (Gordon, 2017). This view is shared by many health care work-
ers, who have refused to co-operate with data collection obligations that facilitate
charging (Bulman, 2017). In response, the National Audit Office has advised on
mechanisms to encourage enforcement (National Audit Office, 2016). In these
circumstances, we ask whether the MoU could harm patients, the public at large,
and health practitioners? If so, what should be done?
Issues for individual patients
The Government justifies the sharing of data with the Home Office on the basis
that it ‘is potentially able to bring suspected immigration offenders back into
contact, to either regularise their stay or work towards their removal’ (Gordon,
2017). It also states that it ‘is particularly important in respect of safeguarding
responsibilities towards vulnerable children and adults who may be at risk’.
However, as the Government has noted, there is a risk that migrants, fearful of the
consequences of data sharing, may not seek health care (Department of Health,
2015). Public Health England has asserted that there is a lack of statistical
evidence to suggest that this is happening, as there is a dearth of research. It has,
however, conceded that:
[i]f patients have concerns that their personal information, even simple identifiers, could
be shared with law enforcement or immigration enforcement agencies for the purposes of
pursuing them for actual or alleged breaches of law or immigration rules, then this risks
creating a real barrier to their engagement. Any barriers, actual or perceived, to patients
accessing healthcare can have serious consequences. In particular this may impact upon
asylum seekers, refugees and undocumented migrants or migrant groups legally in the UK

 who may be distrustful of sharing personal information for fear that it could be accessed
by migration enforcement to locate them or their friends and family (Public Health
England, 2017).
Previous research supports these concerns. In the United States, fear of
disclosure of undocumented status can both reduce or delay health-seeking
behaviour for several diseases, including tuberculosis (Asch et al., 1994; Martinez
et al., 2015). In the UK a fear of deportation does influence testing for commu-
nicable diseases, including HIV (Dodds et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2010),
although migrants do not carry a high burden of infectious disease. Victims of
human trafficking have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to worries about
disclosure, even when legal protections are offered to them (Kings College Lon-
don, 2017). These findings are borne out by accounts not only from the scene of
the Grenfell Tower fire, with reports of individuals assessed by volunteer
doctors as requiring hospital treatment, for example, for head injuries, refusing it
(Gentleman, 2017a), but across the country, where many, including pregnant
women, are too afraid to go to hospital, despite the clear medical need (Gentle-
man, 2017a, 2017b).
While such outcomes may on face appear clearly undesirable to the United
Kingdom, it is critical to consider the context in which they have been imple-
mented; the MoU is situated within a series of Government policies designed to
create a ‘hostile environment’ for migrants (Steele et al., 2014). It was recently
revealed that the Government had acquired data on distribution and needs of
rough sleepers – data intended to allow for the allocation of services and to protect
this vulnerable group – and then used it to target areas for immigration enforce-
ment against homeless migrants, including specifically EEA nationals (Townsend,
2017). The fears that these actions generate clearly jeopardise the health of
individual migrants and, as the next section shows, also the health of the
population at large.
Issues for the public at large
Although most migrants arrive in good health, exhibiting the ‘healthy migrant
effect’, and are at low risk of infectious diseases (European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control, 2015), undiagnosed and untreated infections, and lack of
routine immunisations, can result in issues for the local population and commu-
nities into which migrants are received (Legido-Quigley et al., 2013; Kentikelenis
et al., 2014). Failure to treat non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and
hypertension, may increase future health care needs and costs and burdens on
health services, as well as impairing the ability of the individual to contribute to
the economy (Bozorgmehr and Razum, 2015). Thus, any measurable impact on
the health care-seeking behaviour of individuals risks impacting on public health
more widely.

 Issues for health care workers
When taking the Hippocratic Oath, new doctors swear that ‘whatsoever I shall see
or hear in the course of my profession … I will never divulge, holding such things
to be holy secrets’ (Miles, 2005). As a result, patient confidentiality remains a core
obligation for all in the medical profession. The General Medical Council (GMC)
provides guidance on how to operationalise this requirement in daily practice,
and, in Good Medical Practice, it makes it clear that ‘patients have a right to
expect that their personal information will be held in confidence by their doctors’
(GMC, 2013). In April 2017, the GMC re-emphasised that ‘[a]sking for a patient’s
consent to disclose information shows respect, and is part of good communication
…’ (GMC, 2017).
As detailed above, the expectation of confidentiality is not absolute. Disclosure
of a patients’ personal information may be necessary to support the direct care of
the individual, for the protection of patients and others, or for other purposes
covered by statutory obligations designed to protect the public interest. In all these
cases, the objective is to prevent harm to the patient or others. Doctors who fail to
follow GMC’s guidance on confidentiality and disclosure and who exhibit serious
or persistent failures put their registration at risk.
Balancing confidentiality with disclosure of information involves challenges for
practitioners. The GMC states that, for a disclosure to take place, it must be clear
that ‘the benefits to an individual or to society of the disclosure must outweigh
both the patient’s and the public interest in keeping the information confidential’.
Considerations to be taken into account are listed in Box 1.
Looking at these in turn, it is self-evident that disclosure will bring harm or distress
to the patient and, as noted above, there is now evidence from several countries that
disclosure of immigration status will impede the future engagement with treatment of
Box 1. Considerations in deciding whether disclosure is justified
a) The potential harm or distress to the patient arising from the disclosure – for
example, in terms of their future engagement with treatment and their overall health
b) The potential harm to trust in doctors generally – for example, if it is widely perceived
that doctors will readily disclose information about patients without consent
c) The potential harm to others (whether to a specific person or people, or to the public
more broadly) if the information is not disclosed
d) The potential benefits to an individual or to society arising from the release of the
information
e) The nature of the information to be disclosed, and any views expressed by the patient
f) Whether the harms can be avoided or benefits gained without breaching the patient’s
privacy or, if not, what is the minimum intrusion

 some people in some circumstances. Second, there is also clear evidence from the
events following Grenfell Tower that such measures can erode trust in doctors. In
both of these cases, the offer of an amnesty by the government can be considered an
implicit acceptance of these arguments. Third, where disclosure concerns risks of
communicable disease transmission or terrorism, the risk of harm from non-
disclosure are relatively clear, assuming that the information on which disclosure is
based is accurate and non-discriminatory. However, this is far from clear in relation
to immigration, where any theoretical benefits to society are very far from certain.
Where the government does have a case is the Home Office contention that this
involves disclosure that is at or close to the level of minimum intrusion. In this they
are supported by a ruling in the Court of Appeal in which four non-UK residents
challenged the transmission of information identifying them from the Department
of Health to the Home Office (Court of Appeal, 2015), in an appeal that was
joined by the British Medical Association. The Court held that such information
was ‘less intrusive’ than disclosure of detailed information about an individual’s
medical condition and treatment. While noting that this did not mean that it was
not intrusive at all, or that the information was not inherently private, it was held
that it meant that it would be easier to justify disclosure. However, that judgement
was on issues of data protection and did not take into account the other issues
included in the GMC criteria.
Taking these criteria as a whole, it is unsurprising that many British doctors
have asked whether their professional ethics conflict with the policy of their
Government, in this case a policy promulgated by an MoU and not even by
primary legislation that has undergone parliamentary scrutiny. Of course, this
is a quandary that is faced by doctors in many countries now and in the past,
sometimes even involving judicial and extra-judicial attacks on doctors treating
individuals deemed unworthy by governments (Arie, 2014; Vlassov, 2014).
Also, it must be remembered that many health care staff are themselves
migrants. The data from the GMC reveals that 30,472 doctors come from the EU
and other countries in the EEA, while 71,139 were trained elsewhere in the world,
outside the UK. Data collected by the House of Commons library show that, in
December 2016, 22,081 nurses working in NHS hospital or community services
had an EU nationality, accounting for 7% of the total (Baker, 2017). Creating an
environment where these health care workers are reminded daily that migrants are
seen as a burden on the United Kingdom, and current migration levels are unde-
sirable, may have significant impacts on morale and their on-going contribution to
the NHS. Troublingly, a haemorrhaging of foreign staff from the NHS was noted
after Brexit, with EU staff leaving in large numbers, while the numbers of regis-
trations simultaneously dropped dramatically (Boffey, 2017). A critical decline in
foreign staff and overseas-trained doctors in the NHS will in fact affect the sus-
tainability of the service, threatening the quality of health care for the population
at large. Accompanied by a reduction in applications for training places in
shortage in fields like nursing and midwifery, there are real reasons for the public

 to be concerned about the staffing of the NHS, and therefore wait times, as well as
safe and excellent care.
Conclusion
The British Government, while presenting the MoU as justified, has acknowledged
that its impacts must be appraised more fully, yet it suggests this can safely be done
after implementation. It has delegated this task to Public Health England, to be
completed within the next 2 years. However, there are already strong grounds to
believe that the MoU threatens individual and public health, while placing health
professionals in an invidious position. Consequently, we support the calls by
Doctors of the World, the National AIDS Trust and Liberty, to suspend it until
there has been a detailed consultation on its impacts (Doctors of the World,
National AIDS Trust 2017), especially on migrants, and, if implemented, it should
be as a pilot in a few areas and rigorously evaluated. This measure could change
the doctor–patient relationship potentially irreparably, while driving even more
staff to feel unwelcome in the United Kingdom, shifting their health care expertise
elsewhere. Once again, the government has steam-rolled significant changes to the
NHS, without consulting those forced to impose them: the health profession.
