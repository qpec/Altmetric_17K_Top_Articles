ABSTRACT 
 
Identifying molecular residual disease (MRD) after treatment of localized lung 
cancer could facilitate early intervention and personalization of adjuvant thera-
pies. Here, we apply cancer personalized profi
 ling by deep sequencing (CAPP-seq) circulating tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) analysis to 255 samples from 40 patients treated with curative intent for stage I–III lung 
cancer and 54 healthy adults. In 94% of evaluable patients experiencing recurrence, ctDNA was detect-
able in the fi
 rst posttreatment blood sample, indicating reliable identifi
 cation of MRD. Posttreatment 
ctDNA detection preceded radiographic progression in 72% of patients by a median of 5.2 months, and 
53% of patients harbored ctDNA mutation profi
 les associated with favorable responses to tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint blockade. Collectively, these results indicate that ctDNA MRD 
in patients with lung cancer can be accurately detected using CAPP-seq and may allow personalized 
adjuvant treatment while disease burden is lowest. 
 
SIGnIFICAnCE: This study shows that ctDNA analysis can robustly identify posttreatment MRD in 
patients with localized lung cancer, identifying residual/recurrent disease earlier than standard-of-
care radiologic imaging, and thus could facilitate personalized adjuvant treatment at early time points 
when disease burden is lowest.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer-related 
mortality worldwide ( 
1 
). In patients with nonmetastatic lung 
cancers, a subset can be cured after primary surgical resection, 
radiotherapy, and/or combined treatment approaches, including 
chemotherapy ( 
1, 2 
). Following curative-intent fi
 rst-line therapies, 
current routine clinical surveillance involves serial radiographic

 Early Detection of Lung Cancer MRD by ctDNA Profiling

imaging (1, 2). However, such surveillance can detect only mac-
roscopic disease recurrence and is frequently inconclusive due 
to posttreatment normal tissue changes (3, 4). Unfortunately, 
outcomes are especially poor after clinical disease progression (5). 
Therefore, a sensitive and specific biomarker that detects molecu-
lar residual disease (MRD) before macroscopic recurrence and 
potentially enables initiation of adjuvant treatment while disease 
burden is minimal is a major unmet need.
Liquid biopsy approaches represent a promising strategy 
for disease surveillance in solid tumors (6). Circulating tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) has been shown to identify MRD shortly after 
completion of local therapy in patients with nonmetastatic 
breast and colon cancers using assays that require personaliza-
tion (7, 8). These studies demonstrated the ability of ctDNA 
to predict disease recurrence with high specificity using assays 
that primarily tracked a single mutation in each patient. How-
ever, ctDNA was not detected in ≥50% of patients who ulti-
mately recurred (7, 8), suggesting that increased sensitivity for 
ctDNA detection may be beneficial. We previously reported 
development of cancer personalized profiling by deep sequenc-
ing (CAPP-seq), a next-generation sequencing-based method 
that tracks multiple mutations per patient, can achieve lower 
limits of detection ∼0.002%, and does not require the crea-
tion of personalized assays (9, 10). In this study, we set out 
to determine whether CAPP-seq ctDNA analysis can reliably 
identify MRD in patients with localized lung cancer. We also 
addressed the hypothesis that integrating multiple mutations 
and mutation types improves sensitivity for disease detection 
and explored if ctDNA analysis might guide personalized 
interventions such as targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
RESULTS
We retrospectively profiled 255 blood and tissue samples 
from 40 patients with localized lung cancers being treated with 
curative-intent first-line therapies and 54 healthy adults (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Tables S1–S3). All patients 
had biopsy-proven non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 
37, 93%) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n = 3, 7%), with 7 
patients (18%) having stage IB and 33 patients (82%) having 
stage II or III disease (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5).
Plasma samples were collected before treatment and at 
follow-up visits, which occurred every 2 to 6 months and were 
usually coincident with surveillance CT or PET/CT scans 
(Fig. 1A). For ctDNA analysis, we applied a 188-kb CAPP-seq 
selector targeting 128 genes recurrently mutated in lung can-
cer (Supplementary Table S6; refs. 9, 10).
Using an optimized ctDNA detection approach we recently 
described (10), we detected pretreatment ctDNA in 37 patients 
(93%) with an average of 5 mutations per patient and median 
mutant allele fraction (AF) of 0.62%, nearly 10-fold lower than 
we previously observed in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma 
(11). Among the mutations we detected pretreatment were 
nonsynonymous mutations in the candidate driver genes 
TP53, KRAS, KEAP1, EGFR, STK11, NF1, and CDKN2A (Fig. 
1B). Candidate driver genes were defined as genes that were 
found to be statistically significantly mutated in NSCLC or 
SCLC in prior studies (Supplementary Methods; Supplemen-
tary Table S6; refs. 12–15). The majority of mutations (82%; 
“other mutations”) we identified were not previously classi-
fied as driver mutations and consisted of “private” or “pas-
senger” mutations that have no known functional impact 
(Fig. 1C). This matched the fraction of nonsilent passenger 
mutations we observed in 1,178 NSCLC tumors from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) when considering the same 
genomic coordinates covered by our CAPP-seq panel (9,671 
out of 11,738; 82%; Supplementary Table S7).
In order to assess the clinical specificity of our approach 
for disease monitoring, we also applied CAPP-seq to cell-free 
DNA extracted from the plasma of 54 healthy adults (Supple-
mentary Tables S2 and S8). The median age of healthy donors 
was 57 years (range, 27–82), which was somewhat lower than 
for patients (median 66.5 years; range, 47–91; P < 0.05). ROC 
analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.97, with maximal 
sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 96%, respectively, and was 
superior to detection by candidate driver or other mutations 
alone (Fig. 1D). Pretreatment ctDNA detection rates were 89% 
for adenocarcinoma, 93% for squamous cell carcinoma, and 
100% for other NSCLC subtypes and SCLC. Among patients 
with ctDNA detectable before therapy, pretreatment ctDNA 
concentration was highly correlated with metabolic tumor 
volume (Pearson r = 0.55, P = 0.0004; Fig. 1E). Concentration 
of ctDNA in pretreatment plasma was significantly lower in 
patients with stage I compared with those with stage II–III 
tumors (P = 0.002; Fig. 1F). Baseline characteristics did not 
correlate with overall survival (OS; Supplementary Table S9).
To explore serial ctDNA analysis for disease surveillance 
during follow-up, we performed posttreatment monitor-
ing of the 37 patients with detectable pretreatment ctDNA 
by both cross-sectional imaging and ctDNA analysis (Sup-
plementary Table S1). The presence of ctDNA was evalu-
ated by searching for the presence of previously identified 
tumor mutations in posttreatment plasma using CAPP-seq 
and a previously described Monte Carlo–based approach 
(see Methods). We detected ctDNA in at least one post-
treatment time point in 20 patients (54%), and all 20 of 
these patients ultimately recurred. Both candidate driver 
and passenger mutations were important for ctDNA 
detection during surveillance, with detection of only 
driver mutations in 35%, only passenger mutations in 
35%, and both types of mutations in 30% of patients 
 
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S10). The most frequently 
detected mutations in surveillance samples included muta-
tions in TP53, KRAS, EGFR, and KEAP1 (Fig. 2B). Patients 
with detectable ctDNA at any posttreatment time point had 
significantly lower freedom from progression (FFP) and sur-
vival than those in whom we did not detect ctDNA after com-
pletion of therapy (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2). 
Results remained highly significant when accounting for guar-
antee-time bias (P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S11; ref. 16).
Detection of ctDNA preceded radiographic progression as 
determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria (17) in 72% of patients and 
by a median of 5.2 months (Fig. 2D). Although RECIST criteria 
are frequently used to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical tri-
als, they are not routinely used in clinical practice, where diag-
nostic radiology reports usually more generally classify scans 
as showing (i) no evidence of disease, (ii) recurrent/persistent 
 
disease, or (iii) equivocal findings due to an inability to distinguish 
tumor from posttreatment tissue changes or other processes 
(18). We therefore systematically analyzed all posttreatment

radiology reports (n = 227) for patients in our cohort and classi-
fied them into these three groups (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Table 
S1). Analysis of ctDNA served as a reliable predictor of ultimate 
outcomes in patients with negative or equivocal scans (Fig. 2E 
and F). These findings suggest that ctDNA analysis may be a 
useful adjunct to routine imaging studies.
We next asked whether ctDNA could be detected at a pre-
specified “MRD landmark,” which was defined as the first 
posttreatment blood draw within 4 months of treatment 
completion and generally corresponded to the time of the first 
follow-up scan (1). Landmark methodology was used in order 
to minimize guarantee-time bias (16). Thirty-two patients had 
their first posttreatment ctDNA assessment within 4 months 
of treatment completion and were thus included in this analy-
sis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Analyzing the mutations detected 
in pretreatment plasma or tumor specimens, we detected 
ctDNA in 17 patients (53%) at the MRD landmark, with a 
median mutant allele fraction of 0.20% (Supplementary Fig. 
S3). We detected an average of 2 mutations per patient at the 
MRD landmark, >50% less than pretreatment, indicating that

tracking of multiple mutations including drivers and passen-
gers is beneficial for MRD detection.
We next sought to explore whether detection of ctDNA 
MRD was associated with outcome. FFP at 36 months after 
the MRD landmark was 0% in patients with detectable and 
93% in patients with undetectable ctDNA MRD (P < 0.001, HR 
43.4; 95% CI, 5.7–341; Fig. 3A). Only 1 patient who ultimately 
recurred had undetectable ctDNA at the MRD landmark, 
and in this patient ctDNA became detectable 8 months 
later, coincident with local disease recurrence (Supplementary 
Fig. S4). Analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) and OS 
revealed similar results (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S5), 
with patients with undetectable ctDNA at the MRD landmark 
experiencing significantly better long-term survival than those

 Early Detection of Lung Cancer MRD by ctDNA Profiling

with detectable ctDNA (P < 0.001). In contrast, radiographic 
response assessment by computed tomography (CT) at the 
MRD landmark was not prognostic in this cohort (Supple-
mentary Fig. S6). Detection of ctDNA was strongly prognostic 
in both node-negative patients who predominantly received ste-
reotactic ablative radiotherapy or surgery, and in node-positive 
patients who predominantly received chemo 
radiotherapy (Sup-
plementary Fig. S7), and remained significant by Cox regression 
with multiple covariates (P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S12). 
Results remained highly significant when considering only 
patients with NSCLC (Supplementary Fig. S8). Because some 
patients had already progressed clinically or radiographically by 
the prespecified MRD landmark, we also performed a post hoc 
subset analysis in which we assessed patients at an earlier land-
mark of 6 weeks after treatment. Thirteen patients had blood 
drawn by this time point and were thus eligible for this analysis. 
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed similar results with significantly 
higher FFP and OS in patients with undetectable posttreatment 
ctDNA compared with those with detectable ctDNA at this 
early posttreatment time point (Supplementary Fig. S9).
To quantify the impact of tracking multiple variants on the 
sensitivity of MRD detection, we compared our approach to 
tracking a single mutation. With single-mutation tracking, 
the MRD detection rate was 58% on average, significantly 
lower than the 94% detection rate when using all variants 
 
(P = 0.001; Fig. 3C). Therefore, tracking of multiple muta-
tions maximizes sensitivity of lung cancer MRD detection.
The ability to detect MRD could facilitate testing if early 
intervention, prior to clinical recurrence, could improve out-
comes. We therefore explored types of treatments that could 
potentially have been offered to patients in our cohort at 
the time of MRD detection. In three patients, we identified 
EGFRL858R mutations in ctDNA at the MRD landmark, preced-
ing clinical progression by an average of 3 months. For exam-
ple, patient LUP20 was an 81-year-old who received stereotactic 
ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for stage IB disease and had an 
excellent radiographic response (Fig. 4A). However, this patient 
presented with symptomatic brain metastases 3 months later 
for which she refused treatment, and she died shortly thereaf-
ter. Of note, she did not have pretreatment brain MRI. A PET-
CT 2 weeks after diagnosis of brain metastases demonstrated 
increased size and FDG avidity in the right adrenal gland, 
suspicious for metastasis. We detected EGFRL858R at the MRD 
landmark prior to the development of symptoms, suggesting 
that this patient could potentially have been offered early ini-
tiation of an EGFR TKI and/or brain MRI surveillance.
Although expression of PD-L1 is the best established predic-
tive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors (19), patients 
with NSCLC whose tumors harbor >200 nonsynonymous 
mutations per exome also appear to be enriched for responders 
(20). Tumor genotyping using smaller gene panels can be used 
to infer tumor mutation burden (TMB) in tumor biopsies (21), 
but this approach has not been applied to ctDNA. We therefore 
derived an equation relating CAPP-seq mutation burden to 
whole-exome mutation burden using data from TCGA (Fig. 
4B). We validated this equation by performing both CAPP-seq 
and whole-exome sequencing on DNA from 5 NSCLC tumor 
samples (Supplementary Fig. S10). Using this equation, we 
identified patients with NSCLC in our cohort whose predicted 
TMB exceeded 200 variants. One such patient (LUP238) with 
stage IIIA lung squamous cell carcinoma whose tumor was 
predicted to harbor 331 exome mutations by CAPP-seq achieved 
a complete metabolic response by PET/CT to curative-intent 
first-line concurrent chemoradiotherapy (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, 
we detected ctDNA at 0.27 hGE/mL at the MRD landmark, and 
the patient developed a symptomatic brain metastasis 5 months 
later that had not been present on pretreatment brain MRI and 
which was treated with radiosurgery. The patient developed 
biopsy-proven widespread metastases 4 months later, which 
were refractory to chemotherapy. Similarly, another patient with 
stage III disease (LUP241) was predicted to harbor 207 nonsyn-
onymous mutations and developed brain metastases 6 months 
after treatment that resulted in death and were not present on 
the pretreatment brain MRI. It is possible that these patients 
may have benefitted from early initiation of immunotherapy.
Extending this analysis to all patients with detectable 
ctDNA MRD, we found that 20% could have been poten-
tial candidates for early administration of EGFR TKIs, 33% 
for immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the remaining 47% 
for chemotherapy (Fig. 4D). Importantly, these analyses are 
exploratory and hypothesis-generating and will need to be 
tested in prospective clinical trials before any consideration 
of routine clinical application.
DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that ctDNA analysis is a promising 
approach for MRD detection in patients with localized lung 
cancers and that it can identify recurrence significantly earlier 
than routine CT imaging. Within our cohort, all patients 
with detectable ctDNA during posttreatment surveillance 
developed progressive disease, whereas all patients whose 
ctDNA remained undetectable remained disease-free. The 
sensitivity of our approach for detecting MRD in patients 
who ultimately recurred was higher than seen in recent 
ctDNA studies for other cancer types, likely due to a combi-
nation of technical and biological differences (7, 8).
We found that analysis of ctDNA detected disease recurrence 
earlier than imaging in 72% of patients with a median lead time 
of 5.2 months, opening a window of opportunity in which to 
treat patients while tumor burden and heterogeneity are at 
their lowest. Given the poor outcomes we observed in patients 
with detectable posttreatment ctDNA MRD, it is likely that 
this subgroup could benefit from adjuvant treatment. Previ-
ous trials of adjuvant chemotherapy in nonmetastatic NSCLC 
demonstrated a ∼5% absolute survival benefit at 5 years (22), 
meaning that ∼20 patients need to be treated per patient who 
benefits. This relatively large number is in part because a sig-
nificant subset of patients enrolled in these trials were cured by 
local therapy and thus received no benefit from the additional 
treatment. We anticipate that selection of patients for adjuvant 
therapy based on detection of MRD, rather than based on nodal 
status or clinical risk factors such as primary tumor size and 
nuclear grade, will better enrich for patients who need adjuvant 
treatment while sparing those unlikely to benefit from toxicity.
In our cohort, ctDNA MRD detection was highly prognostic 
for both node-negative and node-positive patients with lung 
cancer. We thus envision that detection of MRD will be useful 
for patients in both groups, with an important caveat that our 
analysis included only 9 evaluable patients with node-negative

disease. For patients with node-negative disease, adjuvant sys-
temic therapy is currently usually not given, because the major-
ity of these patients are cured by surgery and/or radiotherapy 
and because adjuvant chemotherapy may be detrimental in 
some of these patients (1, 22). Administration of adjuvant 
chemotherapy in these patients remains controversial and is 
currently based on clinical risk factors such as tumor size (1). 
Thus, there is an opportunity for testing the utility of adjuvant 
systemic treatment based on detection of MRD. For patients 
with node-positive disease, consolidation systemic therapy is 
currently part of the standard of care in most patients receiv-
ing chemoradiotherapy (1). However, it is likely that a subset 
of these patients is cured by chemoradiotherapy alone, with 
multiple randomized trials showing no survival benefit of 
consolidation chemotherapy (23, 24). Thus, personalization of 
adjuvant/consolidation treatment decisions could potentially 
be beneficial for both node-positive and node-negative patients 
with stage I–III NSCLC. Importantly, the utility of chemo-
therapy treatment based on ctDNA MRD analysis will need to 
be tested in prospective clinical trials.
Targeted therapeutics are currently not administered first-
line in patients with localized NSCLC and instead are reserved 
for treatment of recurrence. It is tempting to speculate that 
patients with detectable MRD who are candidates for such tar-
geted agents might benefit from early initiation of treatment. 
Selection of agents could be based on analysis of pretreatment 
tissue samples, including mutation testing and PD-L1 expres-
sion (19, 20). Our exploratory analysis suggests that assessment 
of actionable mutations and mutational load in ctDNA could 
serve as an additional approach for identifying patients who 
may benefit from early administration of tyrosine kinase or 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly when diagnostic 
tissue specimens have been consumed or cannot be obtained. 
Notably it remains unclear if early targeted intervention based

 Early Detection of Lung Cancer MRD by ctDNA Profiling

on MRD detection will improve lung cancer patient outcomes, 
and prospective trials will be required to test this concept.
One attractive feature of ctDNA-based assays is their high 
specificity compared with existing clinical approaches for 
determining risk of recurrence. Our approach had a specific-
ity of 96% in healthy controls and 100% in patients with lung 
cancer who did not develop recurrence. This is similar to spe-
cificities observed in recent studies on breast and colorectal 
cancer ctDNA MRD using other assays (7, 8). Of note, these 
specificities are significantly higher than those for clinical risk 
factors that are currently used for informing adjuvant chemo-
therapy recommendations in stage I NSCLC. For example, 
the most commonly applied risk factor of primary tumor size 
≥ 4 cm has a specificity of only ∼50% for predicting recurrence 
(25), and therefore future trials basing adjuvant treatment 
decisions on the presence ctDNA MRD may lead to less over-
treatment. That said, applications of ctDNA MRD detection 
to patients with very low risks of recurrence, such as patients 
with very small stage IA tumors, could lead to higher false-
positive rates. If necessary, specificity of ctDNA-based MRD 
approaches could likely be further increased by increasing 
stringency of detection thresholds or repeat assaying.
Many of the patients in our cohort were treated with radio-
therapy, which causes pulmonary tissue inflammation and 
fibrosis that can be difficult to distinguish from residual/
recurrent disease on cross-sectional imaging (3). Accordingly, 
in our cohort the majority of surveillance scans were clinically 
interpreted as being equivocal, even though nearly half of these 
scans were subsequently followed by recurrence. Measurement 
of ctDNA served as an arbiter of equivocal imaging, with 
high sensitivity and specificity for predicting recurrence. Thus, 
ctDNA has the potential to supplement analysis of surveillance 
imaging by aiding the interpretation of equivocal scans.
Despite biological differences between SCLC and NSCLC, 
we included both histologies in this study. Our rationale 
was based on the premise that MRD detection and correla-
tion with outcomes was relevant and broadly applicable to 
diverse lung cancer histologies, including NSCLC and SCLC. 
Additionally, the employed CAPP-seq panel covered muta-
tions present in both histologic subtypes. Notably, when we 
considered NSCLC alone, correlation of ctDNA MRD detec-
tion and clinical outcomes remained highly significant. Our 
results suggest that future studies focused specifically on 
MRD detection in SCLC are warranted.
Using a next-generation sequencing–based approach that 
involves creation of personalized assays for each patient, the 
TracerX consortium recently also found that detection of 
ctDNA during surveillance of patients with early-stage NSCLC 
precedes imaging-based recurrence (26). Unlike the current 
study, the TracerX study did not specifically assess the prog-
nostic value of early ctDNA MRD detection (26). Additionally, 
in the TracerX cohort pretreatment ctDNA was detected in 
only 19% of lung adenocarcinomas (26), compared with 89% in 
our study. Reasons for the lower detection rates in the TracerX 
study compared with our study are likely due at least in part to 
differences in patient cohorts, such as the higher percentage 
of stage I patients in the TracerX study and the higher analytic 
sensitivity of the ctDNA detection method we used (10, 26).
The somatic mutation burden in lung cancers correlates 
with the duration of tobacco exposure (27), but a minority 
of such mutations involve genes known to drive lung cancers 
(12, 13, 27, 28). In a separate study, the TracerX consortium 
recently reported a comprehensive analysis of mutational 
heterogeneity using deep multiregion exome sequencing of 
327 tumor regions from 100 patients (28). Although the vast 
majority of all detected mutations were classified as nondriv-
ers, such variants were only slightly less likely to be clonal 
than driver mutations (57% vs. 64%) and most fit a muta-
tional signature associated with smoking that dominates 
during early tumorigenesis (28). Consistent with this obser-
vation that passenger mutations are often clonal, we found 
that inclusion of nondriver mutations improved noninvasive 
disease detection using ctDNA without compromising speci-
ficity or predictive value for residual disease after definitive 
therapy. Therefore, as in tumor specimens, most somatic vari-
ants we detected in the plasma of patients with lung cancer 
were in nondriver genes. However, these nondriver mutations 
appear to faithfully reflect the clonal burden of disease and 
are useful for posttreatment MRD detection and surveillance.
Limitations of our study include a relatively long accrual 
period, which could have introduced unknown selection biases 
but conversely resulted in a relatively long median follow-
up time. Additionally, although all patients were treated with 
definitive local therapy, the types of treatment were heterogene-
ous and included mostly patients treated with radiotherapy. 
Thus, in addition to validation of our findings in similar 
cohorts, future studies focused on surgically treated patients 
are warranted. Finally, it is important to note that our approach 
is unique compared with other ctDNA detection methods 
because of the dedicated bioinformatic approach for tracking 
groups of previously identified mutations posttreatment and 
the high analytic sensitivity. It is unclear whether other tech-
niques for ctDNA detection would yield similar results.
In conclusion, we found that ctDNA is a promising bio-
marker for early detection of MRD in patients with localized 
lung cancer and can reliably identify patients at high risk 
for recurrence. Tracking multiple mutations improves the 
sensitivity of MRD detection, and both driver and passenger 
mutations are useful for tracking and monitoring disease. 
Validation of our findings and prospective clinical trials test-
ing therapeutic strategies based on ctDNA MRD assessment 
will be required to establish clinical utility.
METHODS
Study Design and Patients
The samples analyzed in this article were collected as part of 
two observational registry studies focused on molecular analysis 
of thoracic malignancies and other tumors (NCT01385722 and 
NCT00349830). For our study, we identified a subset of patients from 
these registries treated between June 2010 and March 2016, to ana-
lyze retrospectively with the primary goal of analyzing the association 
of ctDNA MRD with FFP after definitive therapy of localized lung 
cancers. Eligible patients included in this study were age >18 years 
with untreated primary lung cancers, had AJCC v7 stage IB, II, or III 
disease with WHO NSCLC or SCLC histology and received curative-
intent treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or surgery 
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The study statistical plan used the assump-
tion that 50% of enrolled patients would have detectable posttreat-
ment ctDNA (based on 1-year progression-free survival data from the 
RTOG 0617 standard-dose arm; ref. 29), such that an accrual of 35

patients would be expected to yield 86% power to detect a difference of 
75% versus 25% risk of progression for patients with positive or nega-
tive posttreatment ctDNA, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. A goal of 
 
45 patients was targeted to account for attrition. Blood samples from 
5 patients were included in a prior publication (9).
Eligible patients underwent pretreatment imaging by chest CT and 
whole-body PET-CT and genotyping with CAPP-seq on tumor tissue 
or plasma using matched germline DNA. All patients with stage II or 
higher disease underwent pretreatment brain MRI, as did the major-
ity of patients with stage I disease. This was followed by treatment 
with surgery or radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy). After 
first-line therapy, patients were followed every 3 to 6 months with 
cross-sectional imaging and blood collections (Fig. 1A). For all but 
2 patients the second blood sample was collected after completion 
of all treatments (LUP127 collected during and LUP235 collected 
before consolidation chemotherapy). The median time between the 
end of all treatment and the first posttreatment blood sample was 
56 days. Healthy adult blood donors (n = 54) were recruited through 
the Stanford Blood Center (Supplementary Fig. S1). All samples 
were collected with informed consent and institutional review board 
approval in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All plasma 
samples were analyzed by CAPP-seq as previously described (9, 10).
Criteria for ctDNA MRD Detection and 
Posttreatment Monitoring
ctDNA MRD and serial posttreatment plasma samples were analyzed 
for presence of mutations identified pretreatment using CAPP-seq on 
plasma and plasma-depleted whole blood as previously described, with 
an additional clonal hematopoiesis filter (9, 10). Briefly, ctDNA MRD 
analysis was performed at a prespecified landmark that occurred within 
4 months after treatment completion and typically coincided with the 
first posttreatment CT scan. For MRD and serial posttreatment time 
points, the set of mutations identified pretreatment were assessed as 
a group in the posttreatment blood sample, and a Monte Carlo–based 
ctDNA detection index was measured to determine significance. Given 
concern for clonal hematopoiesis, variants with reads in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells had to also be called by the CAPP-seq variant 
caller (9, 10) for detection. At each time point, ctDNA detection status 
was determined by CAPP-seq using a Monte Carlo–based ctDNA detec-
tion index cutoff point of ≤0.05, as previously established (9, 10). If 
ctDNA detection index was >0.05, ctDNA was classified as not detected 
at that time point, whereas if it was ≤0.05 it was classified as detected, 
in accordance with our prior studies (9, 10). The ctDNA-mutant AF 
at each time point was calculated by averaging the mutant AFs for all 
mutations used for detection calling. ctDNA concentration was calcu-
lated by multiplying the mutant AF by the cell-free DNA concentration 
determined by Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and using the assump-
tion that each haploid genomic equivalent weighs 3.3 pg.
Landmark Analyses and Definition of MRD
To protect against guarantee-time bias, we used landmark analysis 
and time-dependent Cox models (16, 30, 31). The “MRD landmark” 
for ctDNA response was prespecified as the first phlebotomy collec-
tion following completion of curative-intent first-line therapy, and 
occurring no more than 4 months from the end of therapy. MRD 
was defined as Monte Carlo–based ctDNA detection at the MRD 
landmark using mutations identified pretreatment (ctDNA index ≤ 
0.05). ctDNA detection at the MRD landmark was used to categorize 
patients as posttreatment MRD positive or negative.
Statistical Analyses
Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that detection of 
residual ctDNA at the first blood draw after definitive local therapy 
is associated with high risk of recurrence. Our secondary aim was to 
test the hypothesis that patients who ever have ctDNA detected after 
local therapy have worse outcomes. We considered the following 
survival endpoints: FFP (event defined as RECIST 1.1–based radio-
graphic, ref. 17; or clinical progression, with nonprogressors cen-
sored at last radiographic follow-up), event-free survival (EFS; event 
defined as posttreatment ctDNA detection or RECIST 1.1–based 
radiographic progression, ref. 17), DSS (event defined as death from 
cancer), and OS (event defined as death from any cause). Categori-
cal time-to-event analyses of clinical endpoints including FFP, EFS, 
DSS, and OS were conducted using the Kaplan–Meier method with 
log-rank test to estimate P values and the Cox exp(beta) method to 
estimate hazard ratios. The relationship of ctDNA concentration 
as a continuous variable with outcome was assessed using Cox pro-
portional hazards regression. The Wald test was used to assess the 
significance of covariates, and hazard ratios were calculated by the 
exp(beta) method. Time-dependent Cox regression was performed as 
previously described (16). See Supplementary Methods for details.
