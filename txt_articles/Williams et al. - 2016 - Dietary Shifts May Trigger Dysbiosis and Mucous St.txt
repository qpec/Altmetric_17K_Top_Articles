Dietary shifts can result in changes to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota, leading
to negative outcomes for the host, including inflammation. Giant pandas (Ailuropoda
melanoleuca) are physiologically classified as carnivores; however, they consume an
herbivorous diet with dramatic seasonal dietary shifts and episodes of chronic GIT
distress with symptoms including abdominal pain, loss of appetite and the excretion
of mucous stools (mucoids). These episodes adversely affect the overall nutritional
and health status of giant pandas. Here, we examined the fecal microbiota of two
giant pandas’ non-mucoid and mucoid stools and compared these to samples from
a previous winter season that had historically few mucoid episodes. To identify the
microbiota present, we isolated and sequenced the 16S rRNA using next-generation
sequencing. Mucoids occurred following a seasonal feeding switch from predominately
bamboo culm (stalk) to leaves. All fecal samples displayed low diversity and were
dominated by bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes and to a lesser extent, Proteobacteria.
Fecal samples immediately prior to mucoid episodes had lower microbial diversity
as compared to mucoids. Mucoids were mostly comprised of common mucosal-
associated taxa including Streptococcus and Leuconostoc species, and exhibited
increased abundance for bacteria in the family Pasteurellaceae. Taken together, these
findings indicate that mucoids may represent an expulsion of the mucosal lining that is
driven by changes in diet. We suggest that these occurrences serve to reset their GIT
microbiota following changes in bamboo part preference, as giant pandas have retained
a carnivorous GIT anatomy while shifting to an herbivorous diet.

INTRODUCTION
The host-symbiont relationship within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of animals is critical, as
these symbionts play a fundamental role in fiber digestion, modulation of the host immune
system, and maintenance of host-bacterial homeostasis (Hooper et al., 2002; Flint et al., 2012).
In particular, microorganisms associate with the gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue to exclude
pathogens and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that serve as an energy source for the host

Williams et al.
Mucoids in Giant Pandas
(Johansson et al., 2011; Flint et al., 2012). Also, SCFAs cause
the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) to increase expression of
tight junction proteins, thus further increasing the barrier to
pathogens (Brown et al., 2003; Louis and Flint, 2009).
The GIT biology of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is
peculiar because they are evolutionarily related to carnivores and
possess the GIT morphology of a carnivore, yet they consume an
exclusively herbivorous diet. This feature is surprising, given that
the switch from an omnivorous to an herbivorous diet occurred
approximately 2 to 2.4 million years ago (Davis, 1964; Schaller
et al., 1985; Jin et al., 2007), yet giant pandas have not evolved
adaptations seen in traditional herbivores, like a rumen or an
enlarged cecum, to aid in fiber degradation. It remains unclear
how pandas persist solely on bamboo, as they consume large
amounts of the fibrous plant (Schaller et al., 1985), relative to
other herbivores of their size. However, it has been suggested that
they rely on bamboo’
s hemicellulose content, rather than more
difficult to digest cell wall components such as lignin and cellulose
(Dierenfeld et al., 1982).
Both wild and captive pandas annually undergo dramatic
shifts in bamboo part preference between culm (stalk) and leaves
(Schaller et al., 1985; Tarou et al., 2005; Hansen et al., 2010;
Williams et al., 2012) resulting in significant changes in fecal
consistency and GIT microbial communities (Nickley, 2001;
Williams et al., 2012; Xue et al., 2015). These dietary shifts
have been attributed to changes in bamboo composition, as
Schaller et al. (1985) found levels of silica to increase in the leaf
portion of bamboo during times when pandas preferred the culm
portion. This increase in silica content has been associated with
anti-herbivory defense pathways in plants, which may explain
why pandas undergo such a dramatic change in diet preference
(Schaller et al., 1985; Ito and Sakai, 2009).
These endangered bears also suffer greatly from GIT disorders
both ex situ and in situ (Qiu and Mainka, 1993; Loeffler et al.,
2006). In humans, when the host-gut microbe relationship is
severely disturbed, a condition termed dysbiosis can occur, and
the host can experience an inflammatory response; if unchecked,
this can develop into a chronic condition (Fava and Danese,
2011). Similarly, captive giant pandas undergo chronic GIT
distress, with bouts of abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite,
resulting in the excretion of a mucous-like stool (mucoid),
although no investigation into their composition has occurred
to date (Edwards et al., 2006; Loeffler et al., 2006). Necropsies
from pandas that chronically suffer from this condition often
show evidence of ulcerative and necrotizing suppurative colitis
(Loeffler et al., 2006).
While mucoid occurrence has been associated with the
presence of some pathogenic microorganisms (Loeffler et al.,
2006), a direct link between specific pathogens and mucoids
has not been found. Increases in dietary protein are known
to result in greater occurrences of mucoids (Edwards et al.,
2006; Janssen et al., 2006), suggesting that diet may be the
underlying cause. However, captive giant pandas fed a high-
fiber bamboo diet still commonly experience mucoids, so the
cause and means to prevent these episodes remains unclear.
The timing of mucoids is also critical, as they typically occur
during a seasonal dietary shift directly following the breeding
season, and any decreased nutritional status during gestation
or lactation may affect offspring (Steinman et al., 2006; Zhang
et al., 2006). Here, we used next-generation sequencing to
characterize the fecal- and mucoid-associated microbiota in two
giant pandas and to determine if drastic changes in diet correlate
to a concomitant shift in the GIT microbiota and the expulsion
of mucoids. Comparison of the bacterial communities associated
with mucoid episodes (mucoid) to fecal samples, both within
(non-mucoid) and outside the sample season (winter), provides
insights into possible microbial contributions to this important
chronic ailment in giant pandas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Animals
The two giant pandas (“
YaYa,”female, studbook number: 507,
and “
LeLe,”male, studbook number: 466) used in this study were
housed at the Memphis Zoological Society, Memphis, TN, USA.
Samples were collected under a signed biomaterials request form,
and no IACUC protocol was needed as this project was viewed as
non-invasive by the institution.
Behavior Analysis of Bamboo
Consumption
The study of bamboo consumption behavior at the Memphis Zoo
has been ongoing since the fall of 2003 and was conducted as
previously described (Hansen et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2012).
In brief, behavior data were collected in 20-min periods in 30-
s increments while the bear was feeding on bamboo using an
ethogram focusing on foraging behaviors. These behaviors were
divided into three consumption categories: leaf, culm (stalk), and
other (shoot or branch). For each month, the total consumption
behaviors were quantified by time spent consuming specific parts
and each individual’
s behavior was expressed as a percentage of
the total consumption behaviors.
Sample Collection
Fresh fecal (n = 5 female, 13 male) and mucous excretion
(n = 1, 5) samples were collected. All samples were transported
on
dry
ice,
and
stored
at
−80◦C
prior
to
processing.
Samples were classified as “
winter,”“
non-mucoid,”or “
mucoid”
(Supplementary Table S1). Winter control samples (n = 5,5)
were collected on 02/12/13, during a season with historically low
mucoid occurrence and prior to first mucoid excretion in this
study. Additional sample collection occurred between 6/29/14
and 8/22/14. During this period, collected male and female
stool samples were categorized into non-mucoid or mucoid
movements. The date of the movement was also recorded to
study temporal changes. Of note, the male produced a mucoid
sample on 07/17 (day 14) that was not successfully sequenced but
a non-mucoid fecal sample on this date was.
DNA Extraction
Total genomic DNA from fecal samples was extracted via
mechanical disruption and hot/cold phenol extraction following

the protocol described by Stevenson and Weimer (2007) with
the following modification: 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol was used in place of phenol:chloroform at all steps. DNA
was quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and stored
at −20◦C following extraction.
Library Preparation and Sequencing
Library preparation was carried out following manufacturer’
s
recommendations (Illumina, 2013) with some modifications.
In brief, an amplicon PCR targeted the V3–
V4 region of the
16S rRNA gene using a forward (V3-4F, TCGTCGGCAGCGT

primer
(Klindworth et al., 2013) in a 25-µL reaction with 1X KAPA HiFi
Hot Start Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems), 0.2 mM each primer,
and 1–
10 ng DNA. Amplification conditions were as follows:
95◦C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 95◦C for 30 s, 55◦C for 30 s, 72◦C for
30 s, and a final elongation of 72◦C for 5 min. PCR products were
purified via gel extraction (Zymo Gel DNA Recovery Kit; Zymo,
Irvine, CA, USA, USA) using a 1% low melt agarose gel (National
Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Purified products underwent an
indexing 25 µL-PCR reaction (1x KAPA HiFi Hot Start Ready
Mix, 0.2 mM indices, and 5 µL of purified product) with the
same reaction conditions as amplicon PCR with the exception of
a reduction in the number of cycles to 8.
The final index PCR product underwent gel extraction (Zymo
Gel DNA Recovery Kit; Zymo, Irvine, CA, USA), and the
resulting purified product concentration was determined by a
Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Samples were combined to yield
an equimolar 4 nM pool. Following manufacturer’
s protocol,
sequencing was conducted on an Illumina MiSeq using reagent
kit V3 (2 x 300 bp cycles), as described previously (Illumina,
2013). All sequences were deposited into the National Center
for Biotechnological Information’
s Short Read Archive under
Accession Number SRP065974.
Data Analysis
Sequence analysis was carried out using mothur v.1.34.1
following the MiSeq SOP (Kozich et al., 2013). In brief, contigs
were formed from 16S rRNA reads, and poor quality sequences
were removed. Sequences were trimmed and filtered based on
quality (maxambig = 0, minlength = 250, maxlength = 600).
Unique sequences were aligned against the SILVA 16S rRNA
gene alignment database (Pruesse et al., 2007) and classified
with a bootstrap value cutoff of 80, and operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) found with <2 sequences in the total dataset were
removed. Chimeras (chimera.uchime) and sequences identified
as members of Eukaryota, Archaea, and Cyanobacteria lineages
were also removed.
Statistical Analyses
Sequence coverage was assessed in mothur by rarefaction curves
and Good’
s coverage (Good, 1953). Samples were then iteratively
subsampled 10 times to 600 sequences per sample, and OTU
abundances were calculated as the whole-number means across
iterations. Differences in bacterial community were visualized
by non-metric dimensional scaling plots (nMDS, iters = 10,000;
Shepard, 1966) of Bray-Curtis (Bray and Curtis, 1957) and
Jaccard (Jaccard, 1912) similarity (beta-diversity) indices, also
calculated in mothur.
All other statistical analyses were carried out in R [vegan
package (Oksanen et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2015)] or SAS
9.3 software (Cary, NC, USA), and data were expressed as
the mean ± SEM and considered significant if P < 0.05.
In R, differences in taxonomic profiles were assessed at the
phyla, family, and OTU levels. Due to uneven sampling,
analysis
of
similarity
(ANOSIM)
was
used
to
compare
community structure (Bray–

and

types.
Samples
were randomized with respect to sample type and tested to
ensure true significance. Similarity percentages (SIMPER)
analyses were then used to determine the contributions of
taxonomic groups to differences observed in the ANOSIM.
In SAS, the general linearized model (PROC GLM) was
used to determine if diversity differed with respect to sample
type.
RESULTS
Bamboo Consumption Behavior
Dramatic shifts in eating behavior were observed in both pandas
(Figure 1). In general, the bears consumed more culm than
leaf throughout the year, but shifted to higher proportions of
leaf consumption for the months of August and September.
The pandas consumed negligible amounts of leaf material in
May (0.88%) and increased their leaf consumption to its highest
relative proportion in August, (59%) around the time of mucoid
sampling in this study. Following this peak, leaf consumption
steadily declined through December (Figure 1).

Mucoids in Giant Pandas
Sequence Coverage and Taxonomy
For all samples (n = 34), a total of 457,358 raw and 375,406
high-quality (11,376 ± 2,170 sequences per sample) 16S rRNA
sequences were generated using Illumina MiSeq paired-end
sequencing (Supplementary Table S2). A Good’
s coverage value of
>0.99 (Supplementary Table S2) and a leveling off of rarefaction
curves (Supplementary Figure S1) indicated that sequencing was
adequate to detect the majority of bacterial diversity present
in all samples. A 97% OTU analysis corresponding to species-
level classification (Schloss and Handelsman, 2005) identified 118
unique OTUs across all samples with 14 to 84 OTUs per sample
type (Supplementary Table S2).
Sequences from 15 phyla were found across all samples, with
70 ± 5.8% belonging to the Firmicutes and 28 ± 5.7% belonging
to the Proteobacteria (Supplementary Figure S2). All other
phyla represented less than 1.0% relative sequence abundance.
Bacterial classes with >1.0% included the Clostridia (40 ± 4.9%),
Gammaproteobacteria (27 ± 5.7%), Erysipelotrichia (16 ± 2.9%),
and Bacilli (15 ± 3.2, Supplementary Figure S2). Orders
with >1.0% representation corresponded to the Clostridiales
(30 ± 4.9%), Enterobacteriales (25 ± 5.7%), Erysipelotrichales
(16 ± 2.9%), Lactobacillales (15 ± 3.2%), and Pasteurellales
(1.3 ± 0.65%, Supplementary Figure S2). At the family and genus
levels, 99 and 98% of the sequences were annotated, respectively.
Sample Type Affects Overall Bacterial
Diversity
Mucous stools (mucoid) and fecal samples (non-mucoid) were
obtained from the same season and compared to fecal samples
from a historically low-mucoid season (winter). Sample diversity
varied over the sampling period for both male and female giant
pandas (Figure 2). In particular, both male and female displayed
higher Shannon’
s diversity than winter samples. At the beginning
of mucoid season sampling diversity decreased dramatically
prior to the appearance of the first mucoid (Figure 2). Overall,
mucoid samples from both pandas displayed higher diversity,
as measured by indices taking into account both presence and
abundance of all taxa in the sample (Shannon: 1.7 ± 0.26, inverse-
Simpson: 4.0 ± 1.0), than winter and non-mucoid fecal samples
(Shannon, ANOVA, P = 0.0166). Although not significant, these
samples were less dominated by single OTUs (inverse Berger-
Parker: 2.6 ± 0.56, P > 0.05, Table 1). Non-mucoid fecal samples
displayed the lowest average diversity with the highest variation
(Shannon: 1.1 ± 0.13, inverse-Simpson: 2.6 ± 0.32) of all sample
types, and were dominated by a single OTU (inverse Berger-
Parker: 1.9 ± 0.20; Supplementary Table S2).
Overall Fecal Communities Differ
According to Sample Type
The male and female samples were grouped by sample
type (winter, non-mucoid, and mucoid), and total bacterial
community structure (Bray–
Curtis) and composition (Jaccard)
within the winter and non-mucoid groups, with sample types
tested both individually and combined, did not significantly
differ by animal (ANOSIM, P > 0.05, Supplementary Tables
S3 and S5). The mucoid group could not be tested as the female
FIGURE 2 | Shannon’s diversity index for the (A) male and (B) female
giant panda over the sampling period. Non-mucoid feces are black dots
and non-mucoid feces occurring on the same day as a mucoid are

are shaded in gray. The male panda experienced a mucoid on day 14 but this
sample was not successfully sequenced and is not included here.
had only one mucoid sample. Fecal communities were found to
differ by sample type, as statistical analysis revealed differences
in community structure (Bray–
Curtis) at the phyla (ANOSIM,
P = 0.035), family (P = 0.00030) and OTU levels (P = 0.00040)
(Supplementary Table S4). Community composition (Jaccard)
was also found to vary significantly with respect to sample
type across all three taxonomic levels (ANOSIM, P = 0.040,
0.0007, and 0.00040, respectively; Supplementary Table S4).
These differences in overall bacterial community composition
and structure were visualized by non-metric dimensional scaling
(nMDS; Figure 3; Supplementary Figure S3). No significant
differences with respect to sample type were observed when
randomized (ANOSIM, P > 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).
Few Taxonomic Groups Shape Overall
Bacterial Community
To determine which taxonomic groups contributed to the
significant differences observed between sample types, analyses
at the phyla, family and OTU levels were conducted. Only
two
phyla,
the
Proteobacteria
and
the
Firmicutes,
were
found to drive differences between the three sample types

observed, with five families found to be important in sample
comparisons. For WN, the Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae,
and Erysipelotrichaceae, were found to be important drivers
(SIMPER, contribution to overall dissimilarity: 31, 28, and 18%,
respectively; Table 1). These three families, with the addition
of the Streptococcaceae, were found to significantly shape
differences in WM comparisons (Table 1). An additional family,
the Leuconostocaceae, was also observed to significantly drive
differences in NM bacterial communities (Table 1).
Of the 118 OTUs observed in the samples, only six were found
to significantly contribute to the differences seen in the sample
types (Figure 4). Three OTUs, an Escherichia-Shigella species
(OTU 2), a Clostridium species (OTU 1), and a Turicibacter
species (OTU 3), were influential in shaping differences in the
WN comparison (SIMPER, contribution to overall dissimilarity:
31, 28, and 18%, respectively; Table 1). These, as well as an
additional two OTUs, contributed to differences observed in BM:
a Streptococcus species (OTU 12) and an unclassified member of
the Pasteurellaceae (OTU 11; Table 1). For the NM analysis, all
of the previously observed OTUs, except OTU 11, contributed
to differences as well as a Streptococcus species (OTU 4) and a
Leuconostoc species (OTU 6) (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
Here, we characterized the bacterial microbiota associated with
fecal and mucous stools in giant pandas and correlated these
communities to feeding shifts to determine the dietary and
microbial contributions to mucoid episodes, a chronic and
detrimental condition among these herbivorous carnivores. Fecal
samples in this study were grouped as feces from a non-mucoid
season (winter), feces immediately preceding or following a
mucoid episode (non-mucoid), or mucus stools (mucoid).
Consistent with previous reports (Zhu et al., 2011; Xue
et al., 2015), all fecal samples had low diversity (Table 1)
and were dominated by bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes
and Proteobacteria, with substantial contributions from the
genera
Clostridium,
Escherichia-Shigella,
Streptococcus
and
Turicibacter. Mucoid season samples (non-mucoid and mucoid)
were obtained from a predominately leaf-eating season and
tended to have less abundant Clostridium species and more
abundant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, particularly
Escherichia-Shigella. Similar seasonal trends were observed
previously with the same animals using culture techniques
(Williams et al., 2012). However, the opposite trends were
previously reported using next-generation sequencing of samples
across a dietary change to more leaf for both wild and captive
giant pandas (Xue et al., 2015). This discrepancy could be due to
dietary differences as the pandas in the Xue et al. (2015) study
consumed a different species of bamboo, as well as steamed
bread, throughout the study. Importantly, it was not noted that
consumption of bread varied with bamboo portion preference.
Also, a wide range of methodological differences between the two
studies, such as fecal sample processing (blending vs. vortexing),
DNA extraction, or primer bias, may account for the observed
differences (Brooks et al., 2015; Wagner Mackenzie et al., 2015).

differences, there is a shift in the Gram-positive to Gram-
negative ratio due to changes in the relative abundances of the
phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The Firmicutes (Gram-
positive) are commonly considered protective commensals
(Craven et al., 2012) and dominated winter samples, but were
less abundant in non-mucoid and mucoid samples. Inversely, the
Proteobacteria (Gram-negative) include aggressive, pathogenic
species (Baumgart et al., 2007; Craven et al., 2012), and they
were found to be increased in the non-mucoid and mucoid
samples, relative to winter. The largest changes in both phyla
were observed between the winter and non-mucoid samples,
indicating that these giant pandas experiences significant changes
within their microbiota between seasons, possibly as a result of

Mucoids in Giant Pandas
differences in diet throughout the year. Such extreme changes,
as well as the higher variability seen among non-mucoid fecal
samples during the mucoid season (Figure 2), are often indicative
of a dysbiosis between the host and its microbiota (Frank et al.,
2007) and a lack of this dysbiosis could explain why the winter
season has historically low mucoids.
We also found that the Proteobacteria Escherichia-Shigella
species (OTU 2) underwent a dramatic increase from winter
(0.22 ± 0.12%) to non-mucoid samples (43 ± 8.2%), and the
phylum Actinobacteria were absent in winter but present in
mucoids. Increases in the abundances of these bacteria are
indicative of a dysbiotic event (Darfeuille-Michaud et al., 1998;
Baumgart et al., 2007; Krogius-Kurikka et al., 2009; Craven
et al., 2012), particularly in humans with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), a condition that most similarly reflects the chronic
mucoids suffered by giant pandas. Therefore, we hypothesize
that diet-induced dysbiosis between the giant panda and its gut
microbiota, may trigger mucoid episodes similar to dysbiosis-
triggering IBD symptoms in humans.
In addition to differences between winter and non-mucoid
samples, mucoids were characterized by a number of unique taxa,
indicating their divergence from other seasonal changes in the
giant panda’
s fecal microbiota. Specifically, mucoids contained
intermediate abundances of the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria,
specifically Clostridium (OTU 1), Turicibacter (OTU 3), and
Escherichia-Shigella (OTU 2). This presence indicates that
mucoids differ from feces produced in the days surrounding
mucoid episodes, and these bacteria may be members of
the giant panda GIT microbiota that are shed during these
events. Additionally, some differences between the mucoid and
both non-mucoid and winter fecal samples were similar to
differences between the mucosa- and fecal-associated microbial
communities found in other animals (Zoetendal et al., 2002;
Malmuthuge et al., 2013). Though not significant, mucoids had
a higher abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, particularly the
class Flavobacteria, and are these taxa are more commonly
found associated with the mammalian mucosal lining than
with fecal material (Jakobsson et al., 2015). Furthermore, a
single unclassified OTU in the family Pasteurellaceae (OTU 11)
and a Streptococcus (OTU 12) were found only in mucoids,
and these taxa are known mucosa-associated bacteria in other
animals (Kuhnert and Christensen, 2008; Kaci et al., 2014).
Taken together, we speculate that mucoids are a combination of
excreted mucosa, along with continued excretion of fecal material
following the panda’
s switch to leaves.
Although mucoids have been observed throughout the year
in captive pandas, they are more frequently observed in the
summer months following decreases in dietary fiber (Nickley,
2001; Williams, 2011). A similar relationship has been observed
in goats, where decreased fiber intake resulted in changes in the
bacterial community and fermentation, leading to a decreased
caecal pH and an increased lipopolysaccharide concentration.
These alterations to mucosal morphology were associated with
intense epithelial damage and local inflammation as a result of
dietary change (Metzler-Zebeli et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014). Given
that diet also changed for the giant pandas in our study prior to
mucoid collection (Figure 1), we speculate that this may also lead
to similar mucosal injury, subsequent changes in GIT microbiota,
and the need for mucoid excretion.
Under this model, the giant panda’
s dramatic shift to the less
fibrous leaf portion of bamboo might also cause a change in its
mutualistic GIT microbiota. Diet is known to be a major driving
force of the GIT microbiota (Flint et al., 2012), and a seasonal
shift is evident when comparing winter and non-mucoid samples
(Figures 3 and 4) both in our study, as well as in previous reports
(Williams et al., 2012; Xue et al., 2015). Decreases in dietary
fiber and the altered microbiota may then result in inflammation
and damage to the mucosal barrier by processes similar to those
seen in goats (Metzler-Zebeli et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014).
Without an intact mucosal barrier, the panda experiences further
dysbiosis, and fails to maintain its GIT microbiota, as seen by the
higher variability within the non-mucoid samples (Figures 2–
4).
This dysbiosis, and possibly mucosal damage, reaches a critical
level characterized by very low diversity (Figure 2). In order to
“
reset”the system, the mucosal layer along with the altered GIT
microbiota is shed, resulting in increased diversity in mucoids,
as the mucosa is generally more diverse than feces (Zoetendal
et al., 2002; Malmuthuge et al., 2013). Shedding would allow
for the reestablishment of the mucosal barrier and a healthier
GIT microbiota, as shown by the more winter-like composition
and diversity of non-mucoid samples immediately following a
mucoid episode (Figures 2 and 4). This cycle continues in the
weeks following the panda’
s sudden change from a culm-rich to a
leaf-rich diet until such as time as a stable microbial community
and mucosal barrier establish for the new diet. However, this
dysbiosis hypothesis remains to be tested in giant pandas.
Interestingly, one mucoid sample from the male panda (day
35) did not fit our proposed model as it had diversity (Figure 2)
and composition (Figure 4) more similar to winter fecal samples.
Non-mucoid samples from the same day, both before and after
the mucoid episode, had higher diversity and characteristic
non-mucoid communities. Importantly, another mucoid with
characteristic mucoid diversity and composition occurred the
following day (day 36). Thus, we speculate that the day 35 mucoid
was a failed shedding event and thus contained more fecal
material than mucosa, thereby skewing its observed diversity
toward a lower value. Since this shedding failed to remove
sufficient mucosa, another episode (day 36) was needed in order
to achieve a “
reset”of the system.
Giant panda mucoid episodes can have several negative
nutritional and health impacts, as giant pandas typically do not
feed during these periods. Moreover, these mucoids are more
prevalent following the typical breeding season, and reduced
nutritional status can be transferred to offspring both during
gestation and lactation, potentially impacting cub development.
Further work in this area is needed to assess the mucosal injury
and dysbiosis hypothesis proposed here. Moreover, investigating
possible practices like dietary supplements, might help alleviate
GIT distress and the subsequent decline in nutritional status
in giant pandas. This work is the first characterization of the
mucoid-associated microbiota in giant pandas and serves as
an initial step toward elucidating the mechanism behind this
phenomenon that affects the overall health of this critically
endangered species.
