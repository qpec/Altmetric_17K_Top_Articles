ABSTRACT
Background: Stomach fullness is a determinant of satiety. Although
both the viscosity and energy content have been shown to delay
gastric emptying, their relative importance is not well understood.
Objective: We compared the relative effects of and interactions
between the viscosity and energy density on gastric emptying and
perceived satiety.
Design: A total of 15 healthy men [mean 6 SD age: 22.6 6 2.4 y;
body mass index (in kg/m2): 22.6 6 1.8] participated in an experi-
ment with a randomized 2 3 2 crossover design. Participants received
dairy-based shakes (500 mL; 50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and
30% fat) that differed in viscosity (thin and thick) and energy density
[100 kcal (corresponding to 0.2 kcal/mL) compared with 500 kcal
(corresponding to 1 kcal/mL)]. After ingestion, participants entered
an MRI scanner where abdominal scans and oral appetite ratings on
a 100-point scale were obtained every 10 min until 90 min after
ingestion. From the scans, gastric content volumes were determined.
Results: Overall, the gastric emptying half-time (GE t50) was 54.7 6
3.8 min. The thin 100-kcal shake had the lowest GE t50 of 26.5 6 3.0
min, followed by the thick 100-kcal shake with a GE t50 of 41 6 3.9
min and the thin 500-kcal shake with a GE t50 of 69.5 6 5.9 min, and
the thick 500-kcal shake had the highest GE t50 of 81.9 6 8.3 min.
With respect to appetite, the thick 100-kcal shake led to higher full-
ness (58 points at 40 min) than the thin 500-kcal shake (48 points at
40 min).
Conclusions: Our results show that increasing the viscosity is less
effective than increasing the energy density in slowing gastric empty-
ing. However, the viscosity is more important to increase the perceived
fullness. These results underscore the lack of the satiating efficiency of
empty calories in quickly ingested drinks such as sodas. The increase
in perceived fullness that is due solely to the increased viscosity, which
is a phenomenon that we refer to as phantom fullness, may be useful in
lowering energy intake. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl
as NTR4573.

INTRODUCTION
An understanding of satiety may help decrease over-
consumption. Many factors contribute to satiety from the portion
size (1) to orosensory exposure (2, 3). Post-ingestive feedback
from the stomach and intestinal tract on the nutrient content (4, 5)
and volume (6) also affect satiety.
Gastric feedback affects satiety through stretch receptors via
distension, the rate of emptying, and nutrient and energy con-
tents. The increase of feelings of satiety through gastric dis-
tension has been shown in previous work (7, 8). Mackie et al. (9)
manipulated the gastric emptying rate (GER)5 with the use of
isovolumetric and isocaloric liquid and semisolid meals. It was
shown that the condition slowed gastric emptying, which re-
sulted in larger distension and induced enhanced satiety.
Viscosity has been shown to have an effect on satiation and
satiety in multiple studies (10–13). However, the literature has
been inconsistent when it comes to whether viscosity directly
slows gastric emptying. In certain studies, the viscosity did not
slow gastric emptying (14, 15); in other studies, the viscosity
delayed the GER (16, 17). Hoad et al. (18) reported no difference
in gastric emptying between a control guar gum and an intragastric
gelling stimulus but did find different fullness scores. The satiating
effects of viscosity that have been shown may be related to oral
exposure and could be independent of gastric feedback (12).
To our knowledge, Marciani et al. (19) are the only group who
studied viscosity and energy density on gastric emptying in one
single study. They showed that gastric emptying was slowed by
both the viscosity and energy content and concluded that the
energy content delays gastric emptying more effectively than does an
increased viscosity. Concurrently, they showed that the per-
ceived satiety was affected more by the viscosity. However, the
authors stated that further work is necessary with other levels

 of energy and viscosity. More specifically, there are the following
2 areas in which this work can be extended: the energy condition
(320 kcal) is compared with shakes with zero energy (excluding
dextrose for osmolarity), and the stimuli contain only carbohy-
drates and fats. It may be important to include the effects of
protein (20). More importantly, it may be valuable to compare
smaller and larger energy loads with one another to see what the
relative delaying effect is of increased energy density. In addition
to looking at gastric emptying by measuring changes in the
gastric volume, as is commonly practiced, it should prove in-
teresting to also compare gastric emptying per the time unit to
further understand gastric emptying dynamics.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to further elucidate the con-
tributions and effects of viscosity and energy on gastric emptying
dynamics and appetite as measured through ratings and intake.
We hypothesize that the viscosity and energy would slow gastric
emptying. On the basis of studies mentioned previously (18, 21),
we expected that a higher energy content would decrease the
GER more than would an increased viscosity.
METHODS
Subjects
The subject group consisted of 15 healthy men [mean 6 SD
age: 22.6 6 2.4 y; BMI (in kg/m2): 22.6 6 1.8]. The healthy
adult men were recruited through a website and flyers that were
distributed around the campus of Wageningen University. A
flowchart of the study is shown in Supplemental Figure 1S.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: male sex; age between 18 and
35 y; BMI between 18 and 25; self-reported good general health;
willingness to comply with study procedures; and willingness to
be informed of incidental findings. Exclusion criteria were as
follows: unexplained weight loss or gain .5 kg in the past 2 mo;
oversensitivity to any of the food items used in the experiment;
any reported pathologies relating to the gastrointestinal tract that
might influence the results; use of any medications that may
influence gastrointestinal function; having any contraindications
for undergoing an MRI; not signing the informed consent form;
not signing the MRI safety questionnaire before each session;
and being employed or studying at the Department of Human
Nutrition, Wageningen University.
Potential subjects filled out an inclusion questionnaire to allow
them to be screened for eligibility. Subsequently, subjects attended
a screening meeting that included measurements of weight and
height and an explanation of the study procedures including the
MRI procedures. Subjects were unaware of the exact aim of
the study; they were only informed that we were investigating
the digestive system. We kept the subjects naive to the fact that
we varied the energy contents of the shakes.
Before the study, a sample-size calculation was performed.
The calculation was based on an estimated effect size with an
expected difference 6 SD of w11 6 7 min. With statistical
significance set at 0.05, which is the significance level in a 2-sided
crossover study, a power of 90% would be achieved with 15
subjects. The power calculation was included for review by the
Medical Ethical Committee of Wageningen University.
The procedures followed were approved by the Medical Ethical
Committee of Wageningen University in accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 2013 (NL48059.081.14).
This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR4573.
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Design
Subjects came to our facilities 4 times in a randomized 2 3 2
crossover design. Each subject was always scanned at the same
time of day. Subjects were offered to drink 1 of 4 shakes, the
order of which was based on a scheme that was generated with
the use of the website http://www.randomization.com. The scheme
was created with the use of balanced permutations. Five randomly
selected, willing subjects came for one additional session after
completing the 4 sessions to perform a control measurement with
the ingestion of 500 mL H2O.
Session procedures
Subjects were instructed to fast for $3 h and to only drink
watery fluids in that time and not in the previous 1 h before each
session. After arrival, subjects provided baseline appetite ratings
and were scanned for baseline stomach contents. After this as-
sessment, subjects exited the scanner and consumed a shake.
The shakes were consumed from a blinded cup with a 1-cm
diameter straw to allow for the consumption of both the thick
and thin shakes through the straw. Subjects were instructed to
consume the shake within 2 min. All participants finished the
shake within this time. Subjects rated the shakes on a 100-mm
visual analog scale (VAS) on liking, sweetness, thickness, and
creaminess. Subjects were then positioned in the scanner, and
stayed there for 90 min, gave subjective ratings via the intercom,
and underwent a gastric MRI scan every 10 min (for an over-
view of the session, see Figure 1). At the end of the session, the
subjects were offered a sandwich meal of which food intake was
recorded.
Treatments
The ingredients for the shake were cream (AH Basic; Albert
Heijn BV), dextrin-maltose (Fantomalt Nutricia), vanilla sugar
(Dr.Oetker), whey powder (Whey Delicious Vanilla; XXL Nu-
tritions), and water. Fiber in the form of locust bean gum was
added to the shakes (1 g for the thin shakes, 20 g for the 100-kcal
shake, and 10 g for the 500-kcal shake) to manipulate the vis-
cosity. The viscosity was visibly affected. Rheology measure-
ments were performed in line with previous work (10). The flow
behavior is shown in Supplemental Figure 2S. Energy was
manipulated by differing grams of added ingredients. Macro-
nutrients of the shake were combined to reflect a mixed meal
in which 50% of the energy came from carbohydrates, 30% of
the energy came from fat, and 20% of the energy came from
protein (the composition is shown in Table 1). Shakes were
mixed in a container with an internal whisking ball for w30 s.
All shakes were prepared w15 min before intake and offered
at 208C.
Table 1 also gives an overview of the liking, creaminess,
sweetness, and thickness VAS ratings. Liking was significantly
different between shakes with different energy loads. Creaminess
was significantly higher for both the thick shake and the 500-kcal
condition. Sweetness was significantly higher for the 500-kcal
shake. The viscosity and energy significantly increased the
reported thickness. The perceived thickness was greater for the

 high-viscosity condition than for the low-viscosity condition. In
addition, a greater energy load increased the perceived thickness
both in the low- and the high-viscosity conditions.
Outcome subjective appetite ratings
Subjects rated hunger, fullness, prospective consumption,
desire to eat, and thirst on a 100-mm VAS at baseline (i.e., before
intake of the shake). After ingestion, these ratings were obtained
orally every 10 min over the scanner intercom system and were
orally scored by the subject from 1 to 100 points (22).
Gastric volume
Subjects were scanned with the use of a 3-T Siemens Verio MRI
scanner (Siemens AG) with a T1-weighted spin-echo sequence
(HASTE; 24 6-mm slices, 2.4-mm gap, 1.19 3 1.19-mm in-plane
resolution; Siemens AG) and a breath-hold command on expira-
tion to fixate the position of the diaphragm and the stomach. The
duration of one scan was w19 s. Syngo fastView MRI soft-
ware VB17 (http://www.healthcare.siemens.com/medical-imaging-
it/syngo-special-topics/syngo-fastview; Siemens AG) was used to
manually delineate the gastric content on every slice (Figure 2).
The gastric volume at each time point was calculated by multi-
plying the surface area of the gastric content per slice with the
slice thickness, including the gap distance, and summed over the
total slices showing the gastric content. Gastric emptying was
defined as the decrease in gastric content in milliliters over time.
Food intake
After 90 min, subjects were offered a 500-mL bottle of water
and a surplus of ham and cheese sandwich squares. The
serving consisted of 20 squares with the message that more was
available if required; one square was w312 kJ/75 kcal. Partic-
ipants were instructed to eat until they were pleasantly satisfied.
The number of sandwich squares eaten was recorded and used to
calculate intake.

 Control session with water
A subset of 5 participants returned for a fifth session in which
they underwent the same procedure with 500 mL H2O instead of
a shake. Because of the rapid emptying of the water, the scanning
time for those sessions was limited to 25 min after ingestion.
Results, including the water control, are shown in Supplemental
Figures 3S and 4S.
Statistical analyses
The gastric emptying half-time (GE t50) was calculated ac-
cording to the linear exponential model for gastric emptying that
was developed on the basis of earlier models in Zurich (23, 24).
The data were fitted to the model, and the GE t50 was extracted
with the use of R software (version 3.2.2; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing).
The GER was calculated by subtracting gastric volumes to the
amount of millimeters that was emptied in the 10 min between
scans. The AUC over the course of 90 min was calculated for
subjective ratings. The AUC was calculated with the use of
Graphpad Prism 5 software (Graphpad Software) according to
the trapezoidal rule.
All data were quantitative. Data are expressed as means 6 SDs
unless otherwise stated. Testing for differences between treat-
ments for gastric emptying was done with the use of a general
linear mixed model of GE t50 scores, for GER with the use of
a general linear mixed model of the emptied amounts, and for
appetite scores with the use of a general linear mixed model of
the AUC. The energy load and viscosity were included as fixed
factors, and subjects were included as a random factor in the
model. For the subjective appetite ratings analysis, baseline
measurements were included as a covariate (25). Analyses were
performed with the assumption of a first-order autoregressive
covariance structure. Post hoc �
Sídák-adjusted tests were per-
formed to further examine the main effects. Statistical analy-
ses were performed with IBM SPSS 20 software (IBM). The
significance level was set at P = 0.05.
RESULTS
Gastric emptying
Figure 3 shows the gastric volume over time of the different
treatments. The thin 100-kcal shake had the lowest GE t50 of 26.5 6
3.0 min (95% CI: 11.9, 41.4 min), which was followed by the thick
100-kcal shake with a GE t50 of 41 6 3.9 min (95% CI: 26.4,
55.9 min) and the thin 500-kcal shake with a GE t50 of 69.5 6
5.9 min (95% CI: 54.9, 84.4 min), and the thick 500-kcal shake
had the highest GE t50 of 81.9 6 8.3 min (95% CI: 67.3, 96.8 min).
For the GE t50, there was a significant effect of the viscosity
(P = 0.006, F = 8.4) and energy content (P , 0.001, F = 81.8).
Estimated means were closer together for the viscosity (100 kcal:
48.2 6 5.4 min; 500 kcal: 61.6 6 5.4 min) than for the energy

Mean 6 SEM gastric volumes measured by multiplying the

emptying curve of the individual subject, the gastric emptying half-time was
extracted, and the mean gastric emptying half-time was calculated per treat-
ment (thin 100 kcal: 26.5 6 3.0 min; thick 100 kcal: 41 6 3.9 min; thin 500
kcal: 69.5 6 5.9 min; and thick 500 kcal: 81.9 6 8.3 min). A mixed model
analysis showed that the viscosity significantly increased at 50 min (P =
0.006, F = 8.4) as did the energy content (P , 0.001, F = 81.8). Post hoc
tests showed that all pairwise comparisons were significant with the excep-
tion of the thin and thick 500-kcal shakes. n = 15.

 load (thin: 33.9 6 5.4 min; thick: 75.8 6 5.4 min). Post hoc tests
showed that the GE t50 was significantly higher under both the
low-viscosity condition (P , 0.001, F = 43.0) and the high-
viscosity condition (P , 0.001, F = 38.9). The gastric emptying
time was significantly higher because of an increased viscosity
under the low–energy-load condition (P = 0.033, F = 4.8) but
not under the high–energy-load condition (P = 0.065, F = 3.6).
Significant effects of increasing the energy load on the GE t50
were an increase of 42.9 min under the thin condition and of
40.9 min under the thick condition. The viscosity increased the
GE t50 by 14.5 min in the 100-kcal condition.
The curve for the GER is shown in Figure 4. In Supplemental
Table 1S, the emptying rate (kcal/min) for each time bin is
shown. Significant differences were shown in bins 2, 3, and 8, of
which bin 2 showed the largest mean emptying differences (thin
100-kcal shake: 102 mL; thick 100-kcal shake: 85 mL; thin 500-
kcal shake: 35mL; thick 500-kcal shake: 40 mL). The differ-
ences between the 100- and 500-kcal shakes were significant. In
Supplemental Table 2S, complete pairwise comparisons of the
4 shakes/bin, including P values, are shown.
Appetite ratings
An overview of all AUC mean values and P values for the
main effects are shown in Table 2. Hunger was not significantly
affected by the viscosity or energy load. Fullness ratings over
time are shown in Figure 5. The AUC for fullness was signifi-
cantly higher after increasing the viscosity (P = 0.007, F = 8.1;
estimated means of the AUC were 3976.3 6 264.6 under the
thin condition and 4718.6 6 264.6 under the thick condition).
The effect of increasing the viscosity on fullness was an increase
of 984.2 points on the AUC. For prospective consumption, there
was a significant interaction effect (P = 0.038). Increases of
prospective consumption ratings of the energy load under the
high-viscosity condition (P = 0.043, F = 4.4) and increases of
the prospective consumption ratings of viscosity under the high–
energy-load condition (P = 0.001, F = 13.0) were significant.
The effect of increasing the viscosity was an increase of 1129.9
points on the AUC. The effect of increasing the energy load was
an increase of 654 points on the AUC. For the desire to eat, there
was a significant interaction effect as well (P = 0.026). The post
hoc analysis showed that desire-to-eat ratings were significantly
decreased by increasing the viscosity but only under the high–
energy-load condition (P = 0.018, F = 6.1). The effect of in-
creasing the viscosity was an increase of 1210.3 points on the
AUC. Curves for hunger, prospective consumption, and desire to
eat are shown in Supplemental Figure 5S.
Ad libitum intake
Participants consumed w7 sandwich squares after the ses-
sion, which corresponded to 1.75 ham and cheese sandwiches.
There were no significant differences in intakes of sandwiches
between treatments (effect of viscosity: P = 0.190, F = 1.8;
effect of energy load: P = 0.804, F = 0.062) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In the current experiment, we studied the effects of viscosity
and energy load on gastric emptying and satiety. The increase of
the energy load led to slower gastric emptying over time; the
increase of viscosity only significantly slowed the emptying
under the low–energy-load condition. The GER was very similar
for the two 100-kcal conditions despite the substantial difference
in viscosity. The viscosity significantly changed the appetite
ratings, whereby fullness scored higher, and the desire to eat
scored lower.
In confirmation of our hypothesis, we showed that gastric
emptying of a low energy load was quicker than that of a stimulus
with a higher energy load. This result corresponds with the
finding of a study of Marciani et al. (19). In addition, gastric

ENERGY AND VISCOSITY AFFECT GASTRIC EMPTYING

 emptying was delayed by increasing the viscosity, albeit less
effectively (21). Our findings indicate that the difference in
gastric emptying between a thin low-energy fluid and a thick low-
energy fluid can be completely explained by the quicker drainage
within the very first moments after consumption. If we correct for
the draining in the beginning by looking at the GER per 10 min,
the viscosity has little to no effect.
It is known that gastric sieving of water occurs, which can be
mitigated by blending the water with the stimulus (26). The
blending of a stimulus may influence both the energy load sensed in
the duodenal of the emptied gastric content as well as the viscosity
of the content in the stomach. Because of this phenomenon, it
remains unclear whether this blending slows emptying by increasing
the energy load, increasing the viscosity, or both. Our research
showed that increasing the energy load by a factor 5 from 100 to 500
kcal slowed gastric emptying significantly more than did increasing
the viscosity by a much larger factor. Therefore, our results indicate
that the gastric sieving effect is due to the sieved fluid, namely water,
having a low caloric content. In the blended condition, the fluid
fraction is much more caloric. These calories, regardless of vis-
cosity, can be the cause of delayed emptying.
The thin 100-kcal shake in our experiment showed an w100-mL
lower starting volume than that of the other 3 shakes. This lower
starting volume was also apparent in the water control treatment.
Approximately 100 mL seeped through before the gastric con-
tent was retained. The slope of the subsequent emptying curve
seemed very similar between the 100-kcal thin and thick shakes.
This relation was also reflected in the GERs, which appeared to
be very similar for the shakes with equal energy loads. This
result suggests that, in our experiment, the GER was not driven
by viscosity and that previously reported differences (27) might
have been due to gastric seeping of the first milliliters of
a stimulus, which is both thin and contains a low energy load.
This seeping through of the first 100 mL may also have been an
important effect that confounded results in studies that used
indirect methods to assess differences in gastric emptying dy-
namics such as the plasma acetaminophen concentration or C13
labeling. Additional research in this area is warranted to estab-
lish the effects of viscosity and energy density on this initial
seeping through of gastric contents. Furthermore, it may be
important in the future to measure the gastric volume during
ingestion as well to catch the content before it seeps through.
It has been suggested, and it seems logical, that slower gastric
emptying increases feelings of satiety (4). Clegg et al. (4) showed
a larger AUC for fullness after the consumption of a smooth soup
than after the consumption of a chunky or solid meal. They con-
cluded, on the basis of their gastric emptying data, that this effect
was due to the longer gastric distension by the soup. Our results may
suggest an alternative explanation for the satiating power of soup.
We showed that subjective ratings were more heavily influenced by
viscosity than they were by the energy load, which was most ap-
parent in the self-reported fullness. It would be expected that
perceived fullness follows the gastric volume quite naturally.
However, we showed higher ratings for the thick 100-kcal shake
than for the 500-kcal thin shake although the former emptied much
more quickly. For example, we showed that both thick shakes and
both thin shakes had comparable fullness ratings at 40 min after
ingestion; however, mean scores for the thick shakes were only w8
points lower on a 100-point scale. When we looked at the gastric
content at 40 min, w350 mL was retained in the stomach after
consumption of the 500-kcal shake, but 250 mL was retained after
consumption of the 100-kcal thick shake, and only 110 mL was
retained after consumption of the thin shakes. Thus, the thin shakes
yielded similar fullness ratings although the stomach was filled
with 350 mL in one condition and 110 mL in the other condition.
Concurrently, we showed low fullness ratings without the
postprandial peak of the other stimuli for the thin 500-kcal shake.
This well-known effect is often referred to in popular science as
the “empty calories” in sodas. Not only did we show an empty
calories effect of the thin 500-kcal shake, but in contrast, we also
showed that there was high fullness even when the shake was
emptied quickly. Thus, increasing the perceived thickness cre-
ated a kind of phantom fullness, whereby there was a perceived
feeling of fullness that was is not congruent with the actual gastric
content. This hypothesis has been supported by results from work
with low-calorie foams (28), which reduced the appetite.
Thus, the link between subjective fullness and gastric fullness
may be weaker than it sometimes has appeared in previous work
(29). The importance of effort and mouth feel has been shown in
multiple studies (30). Hunger is suppressed more or for a longer
period (31, 32), intake is reduced (3, 12), and, through longer
mastication, satiety is increased (33, 34). We propose that taste
and mouth feel are perhaps contributing factors to subjective

 feelings of fullness. This possibility may offer an alternative
explanation to findings in earlier studies that concluded that
greater satiety was caused by delayed gastric emptying (9), both
of which may have resulted from a greater oral and sensory
exposure of viscous stimuli. The importance of the perception in
the mouth was underlined in a study that showed that gastric
emptying was only slowed down when stimuli were administered
orally and not when they were administered intragastrically (35).
A design that used sham feeding showed that the oral exposure
through sham feeding was not enough to delay gastric emptying
(36). To further understand this outcome, similar paradigms with
the inclusion of hormone-concentration measurements would be
highly interesting. If taste and mouth feel contribute to fullness
feelings as we propose, the manipulation of mouth feel should
change hormone concentrations such as those of cholecystokinin.
Research that uses an MRI requires a supine position. In our
study, subjects remained completely stationary in their supine
position for 90 min. This supine position meant that the gastric
content flowed slower through the pyloric sphincter because
gravity did not propagate the flow as effectively as it would in
a standing or sitting position. Our observed emptying may have
been slower than it would have been in a more-natural position
(37), which meant that appetite scores and calculated emptying
times may not transfer directly to the natural situation because of
the overestimation of absolute effects. A second effect of the
supine position was that the observed emptying may have rep-
resented more-active emptying by gastric contractions.
In conclusion, gastric emptying is slowed by increases in both
the energy load and the viscosity. However, increasing the energy
load is the most important factor. Viscosity loses its retarding
effect if the energy load is increased to a meal size of 500 kcal.
This effect indicates that the viscosity may not affect satiety and
satiation through delaying gastric emptying. We showed sig-
nificant changes in subjective ratings that were due to viscosity,
which indicated that increased satiation and satiety are affected
by viscosity through mouth feel and oral exposure. Moreover,
subjects showed no tendency to compensate for the caloric intake
during the meal afterward. A thick shake containing 100 kcal will
yield higher fullness ratings and lead to similar intake when
compared with a thin shake containing 500 kcal. We may find use
for this phantom-fullness effect (i.e., a sense of fullness and
satiation caused by the taste and mouth feel of a food irrespective
of its caloric content). Thick low-caloric liquid meals may leave
people feeling fuller and more satiated, thereby preventing
compensatory overconsumption afterward.
