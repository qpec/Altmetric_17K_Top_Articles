For years, branch retinal vein occlusion is still a controversial disease in many aspects. An increasing amount of data is available
regarding classification, pathogenesis, risk factors, natural history, and therapy of branch retinal vein occlusion. Some of the
conclusions may even change our impression of branch retinal vein occlusion. It will be beneficial for our doctors to get a
deeper understanding of this disease and improve the treatment skills. The aims of this review is to collect the information
above and report new ideas especially from the past a few years.
1. Introduction
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common
type of retinal vascular disorder, after diabetic retinal dis-
ease, and one of the most common causes of the sudden
painless unilateral loss of vision [1]. RVO can be divided
into
two
main
types:
branch
retinal
vein
occlusion
(BRVO) and central retina vein occlusion (CRVO). The
International Eye Disease Consortium reported the preva-
lence of retinal vein occlusion in the USA, Europe, Asia,
and Australia which contained 68751 individuals aging
from 31 to 101 years of 15 studies which shows that
the prevalence of RVO was 5.20 per 1000 for any RVO,
4.42 per 1000 for BRVO, and 0.80 per 1000 for CRVO.
It suggested that roughly 16 million people in the world
suffer from this vascular disorder and BRVO is about 4
times more common [2]. Generally, BRVO has a better
prognosis than CRVO. Without therapeutic intervention,
visual acuity can still improve generally in eyes with BRVO
but clinically significant improvement beyond 20/40 was
uncommon [3].
2. Classification
BRVO can be divided into two different types according to
Hayreh et al.: major BRVO, when one of the major branch
retinal vein is occluded, and macular BRVO, when one of
the macular venules is occluded, and these two types have
different fundus changes [4, 5]. Major BRVO comprises a
nonischemic form and an ischemic form detectable in one
third and two thirds of cases, respectively, and ocular neovas-
cularization can only be found in ischemic major BRVO [6].
The typical arteriovenous crossing of major BRVO is situated
along the course of a major venous branch. The location of
the arteriovenous crossing with respect to the optic disc
determines the extension of the area involved [7]. It is
reported that 65% of BRVO occurred in the superior tem-
poral quadrant. This is postulated to be due to increased
arteriovenous crossing at this site or increased symptoms
when the fovea becomes involved to affect the vision [8, 9].
Macular BRVO represents a particular venous occlusion in
which the obstruction is limited to a small vein draining a
specific sector of the macula located between the superior

 and inferior temporal arcades [10]. Unlike ischemic major
BRVO, macular BRVO does not develop retinal neovascu-
larization (NV) because the ischemic area is too small to
provide a sufficient stimulus for NV. A further group is
hemi-vein occlusion, a distinct clinical entity presenting
as occlusion of only one trunk of the central retinal vein
in the area of the anterior part of the optic nerve. Hayreh
et al. considered it as a separate type since its pathogenesis
is quite similar to CRVO [10]. With the help of basic techno-
logy such as fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiog-
raphy (FFA), spectral domain optical coherence tomography
(SD-OCT), visual field testing, and full-field electroretino-
gram (ff-ERG), BRVO and macular edema are usually easy
to diagnose and classify [11–14]. In addition, new technology
such as OCT angiography (OCTA) can measure vascular
density and the foveal avascular zone. OCTA can also
observe the superficial and deep capillary networks, nonflow
areas, vascular dilation, and intraretinal edema, which can be
helpful in diagnosis and follow-up [15–19].
3. Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of RVO is multifactorial while BRVO may
be due to a combination of three primary mechanisms:
compression of the vein at the arteriovenous (A/V) crossing,
degenerative changes of the vessel wall, and abnormal hema-
tological factors. Arteriolar sclerosis due to various reasons
such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia can result in more
compression of the veins, which is the primary cause of
BRVO. Zhao et al. evaluated the anatomic position of the
crossing vessels in 106 eyes with BRVO and found the artery
anterior to the vein at the obstructed site in 99% of affected
eyes [20]. Also, the mechanical obstruction of the vein
through the rigid artery in the A/V crossing may result in tur-
bulent blood flow producing damage to the vein vascular
endothelium and intima media and the sequence of events
leading to occlusion of the vein, as reported by Christoffersen
and Larsen [21]. Hyperviscosity due to high hematocrit has
also been found to be associated with BRVO [22]. Viscosity
is mainly dependent upon the hematocrit and plasma fibrin-
ogen, and isovolumetric hemodilution does also positively
impact it [23]. Another discussed hematological disorder
in the pathogenesis of BRVO is the dysregulation of the
thrombosis-fibrinolysis balance. The coagulation cascade
including different blood factors results in the production
of thrombin which converts circulating fibrinogen to fibrin.
The coagulation sequence is held in check and inhibited by
specific anticoagulants including protein C, protein S, and
antithrombin. However, the results of published studies
are inconsistent, and the role of coagulation factors in the
development of RVO remains unclear [24]. It is well rec-
ognized that submacular hemorrhage from neovascular
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinal artery
macroaneuryms (RAMs) often causes severe visual impair-
ment [25, 26]. Previous experimental studies have suggested
several
mechanisms
by
which
subretinal
hemorrhage
damages the overlying photoreceptors, such as clot retrac-
tion, iron toxicity (hemosiderosis), induction of fibrosis,
and blockage of nutrient diffusion from the choroidal
circulation [27]. In BRVO, some of these mechanisms
may be involved in the formation of foveal damage,
although the mechanisms involved are not completely
understood. An experiment carried out recently indicated
that BRVO can cause acute endothelial cell apoptosis and
increased permeability. Subsequently, the upstream vascular
network remains destabilized, characterized by pericyte
dropout, abnormally high endothelial cell turnover, and
sensitivity to hypoxia. These early changes might pave
the
way
for
capillary
loss
and
subsequent
chronic
ischemia and edema that characterize the late stage
disease [28].
4. Cystoid Macular Edema
Cystoid macular edema (CME) is the main cause of impaired
vision due to BRVO and occurs in 30% of BRVO eyes [29]. It
was hypothesized to be caused by fluid flux from vessels to
tissue according to Starling’s law, which is based on the
breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier as a result of
damage to the tight junctions of capillary endothelial cells,
vitreoretinal adhesion, and secretion into the vitreous of
vasopermeability factors produced in the retina [30–33].
Noma et al. suggested that in patients with BRVO, vascular
occlusion induces the expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) which is promoted by hypoxia and
retinal nonperfusion and interleukin-6 (IL-6), resulting in
blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and increased vascu-
lar permeability which results in macular edema [34–36].
Moreover, aqueous levels of other growth factors such as
placental growth factor (PIGF), platelet-derived growth fac-
tor (PDGF)-AA, and various inflammatory factors including
soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1), mono-
cyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-8, IL-12, and IL-13 as well as soluble vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (sVEGFR)-1 and sVEGFR-2 were
found to be significantly higher and correlated with CME
[36–38]. The inflammatory factors may induce an increase
of vascular permeability and disrupt the blood-aqueous
barrier, but further studies are needed to elucidate the
exact pathophysiology [39]. Recently, a study reported that
aqueous angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) level in patients
with ME due to BRVO is also significantly higher [40].
The ANGPLTL4 mediates the development of vascular
permeability and angiogenesis in hypoxic conditions, is
overexpressed
in
general
ischemic
retinopathy,
and
promotes the development of CME [41, 42]. If marked
hypoxia persists, irreversible structural changes in the
macular occur, and the disturbed visual acuity (VA) is
almost always lasting. Moreover, it is recently reported
that aqueous erythropoietin (EPO) level is also higher than
normal in BRVO patients, especially during the acute
period [43]. The EPO was found to be associated with
retinal
ischemia
and
provides
neuroprotective
effects
against
ischemia-reperfusion
injury
and
light-induced
retinal degeneration in animal models [44, 45]. It was
discovered that there exists a strong correlation between
EPO and VEGF. Higher concentrations of vitreous EPO
2

 in BRVO are exclusively caused by the retinal hypoxia and
are related to CME [46].
5. Risk Factors
BRVO has many known ophthalmic and systemic risk
factors considering its complicated pathogenesis. It is widely
known that advancing age is an important risk factor for
BRVO since the main pathogenic mechanism of BRVO
is arterial stiffness that causes venous compression in the
common adventitial sheath [2, 47]. Systemic vascular dis-
eases like hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and metabolic diseases like
diabetes mellitus (DM) are all connected with BRVO. A
meta-analysis showed that, in BRVO, the odds ratio for
HTN, HLD, and DM is 3.0, 2.3, and 1.1, respectively [48].
A study in 2014 enrolled 492488 patients older than 55 years
demonstrated that HTN seems to be the main driver of the
increased risk for incident BRVO and those with more severe
HTN were at even greater risk. Also, they discovered that
persons with “uncomplicated” DM had no difference in the
risk of being diagnosed with BRVO, while those with end
organ damage from DM had a 36% increased risk, but no
association between dyslipidemia and BRVO was found.
However, the presence of dyslipidemia actually attenuated
some of the increased risk of BRVO among persons who
had multiple components of the metabolic syndrome [49].
Also Lam et al. reported that risk factors for developing
BRVO younger than 50 years were very similar to those in
older people (HTN, HLD, and high body mass index
(BMI)); therefore, these two articles together can make a
whole story [50]. It is not completely clear what role throm-
bophilia plays in the BRVO pathogenesis. Blood abnormali-
ties play a controversial role in the pathogenesis of BRVO,
and erythrocyte volume, level of fibrinogen, and hematocrit
appear to be important [22–24]. Three recent meta-analyses
of RVO and thrombophilic factors demonstrated that only
hyperhomocysteinemia and anticardiolipin antibodies play
a role in the pathogenesis of RVO [24, 29, 51]. Additional
studies also reported other less common risk factors such as
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), inadvertent retrobulbar nee-
dle perforation, axial length and vitreous chamber depth,
liver or renal diseases, and even posterior vitreous adhesion
[52–57]. Moreover, BRVO may also be easier to find in peo-
ple with gene defects, like adiponectin +276 G/T and AGTR1
A1166C single-nucleotide polymorphism, which are related
to arterial stiffness [58]. Blacks were also found to be at
increased risk of developing incident ophthalmic venous
occlusive disease, even after controlling for HTN, other
components of the metabolic syndrome, and sociodemo-
graphic factors [49]. These results support earlier work by
the International Eye Disease Consortium, which showed a
greater prevalence of BRVO among blacks compared with
whites [2]. There are many hypotheses as to why blacks
may be at greater risk for end organ vascular damage, ranging
from reduced access to high-quality health care, to racism
potentially leading to chronic stress, to living in neighbor-
hoods with higher levels of pollution, and to living in unsafe
neighborhoods impacting their ability to exercise, which can
all lead to an increased burden of vascular disease [2].
6. Natural History
BRVO has a relatively better vision outcome compared to
CRVO, with 50% to 60% of eyes recovering vision to 20/40
or better without treatment and with 25% which may develop
retinal neovascularization [6]. The natural course of BRVO is
determined by the site and degree of occlusion, the integrity
of arterial perfusion to the affected sector, and the efficiency
of the developing collateral circulation [59]. According to
Hayreh et al., the median time to macular edema resolution
was 21 months in those with major BRVO and 18 months
in those with macular BRVO. Overall, for eyes with initial
VA of 20/60 or better, VA improved or remained stable in
75% for major BRVO and 86% for macular BRVO. In those
with initial VA of 20/70 or worse, VA improved in 69% for
major BRVO and in 53% for macular BRVO, with median
final VA of 20/60 for both BRVO types [60]. On follow-up,
in temporal main BRVO, visual field defect improved or
remained stable in 68% of eyes with minimal to mild initial
defect and improved in 52% of eyes with moderate to severe
initial defect. In macular BRVO, visual field defect remained
stable or improved in 85% of eyes with minimal to mild
initial defect [9]. A meta-analysis reported that 10% of the
patients can observe the development of fellow eye involve-
ment [3]. Although a majority of BRVO eyes had variable
amounts of VA improvement without treatment, there was
a lack of improvement in some eyes, which may be due to
the same factors as those seen in ischemic central retinal vein
occlusion: ischemic damage to macular retinal ganglion cells,
pigmentary degeneration, and development of an epiretinal
membrane from prolonged macular edema [5, 61–65].
7. Treatment
The treatment of BRVO is comprised of three main stages:
identification and treatment of modifiable risk factors,
specific treatment of the vascular occlusion, and treatment
of BRVO complications such as macular edema, retinal
neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, and traction retinal
detachment so as to improve visual acuity and metamor-
phopsia [66]. The main purpose of all treatments is the
resolution of the macular edema (the leading cause of
impaired visual acuity and metamorphopsia) before the
foveal photoreceptor layer is damaged [67, 68]. The manage-
ment of macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein
occlusion has greatly improved in recent times with the
introduction of a therapy based on intravitreal injection of
antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) molecules
and steroids [69]. Patient outcomes even with identical treat-
ments can be vastly different due to disease, and patient

 the perifoveal capillary network [60, 81, 82], retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) integrity [83, 84], serious retinal detach-
ment [85], and subretinal hemorrhage [86]. Some of these
prognostic factors are still controversial. Basically, patients
with a younger age, milder symptom (such as nonischemic
BRVO), shorter duration of CME, and better response to
early treatment tend to have a better outcome. A recent
survey reported that retina specialists treating CME second-
ary to RVO recommend different treatments for patients
than they would choose for themselves. This suggests that
cognitive biases exist and one should take this into consider-
ation when making treatment recommendations for their
patients [87].
7.1. Anti-VEGF. Inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) have revolutionized the treatment of CME
associated with BRVO, a condition that is sensitive to
VEGF. Several lines of evidence suggest that VEGF is a
major mediator for CME in BRVO [33, 34] and have
demonstrated the resolution of CME and improvement
of vision in response to pharmacologic VEGF inhibition
[88]. The most commonly used anti-VEGF drugs at this
time are bevacizumab (Avastin), aflibercept (Eylea), and
ranibizumab (Lucentis). Selected clinical trials are col-
lected in Table 1 [89–99].
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized and chimeric
IgG1 type monoclonal antibody, directed against all the
isoforms of the VEGF peptide to block angiogenesis. Many
studies have reported that visual acuity and macular edema
improved significantly after intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB)
treatment and also cause a significant decrease in sVEGFR-1,
VEGF, PDGF-AA, MCP-1, and IL-8 [38, 89]. A recent study
showed that after IVB treatment, there is an increase of reti-
nal venous outflow that may possibly influence the resolution
of macular edema [100]. Compared with intravitreal triam-
cinolone acetonide, intravitreal bevacizumab can achieve
better long-term VA outcomes with much lower rate of
adverse events (e.g., cataract and glaucoma), despite the fact
that triamcinolone acetonide may achieve equal visual acuity
and morphology improvement for the first few months right
after treatment [101, 102]. Also, IVB can result in better
outcome in the recurrent CME, while subthreshold grid laser
was completely ineffective [103]. However, CME due to
BRVO has a relatively high rate of recurrence. Only 30%–
34% of IVB-effective eyes can achieve persistent resolution
of CME, whereas most need additional treatments to opti-
mize visual acuity [104–106]. The duration from symptom
onset to initial IVB could affect the CME recurrence rate
but not the efficacy rate after a single IVB injection [104].
Aflibercept is a fusion protein that combines key domains
from human VEGF receptors VEGFRs-1 and VEGFRs-2
with the constant region Fc of human immunoglobulin G
and binds multiple VEGF-A isoforms. The VIBRANT study
(n = 183) included patients from North America and Japan
and showed that 52.7% of the affected eyes had a visual
improvement of more than 15 Early Treatment of Diabetic
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters with a mean improve-
ment of 17 ETDRS letters. It also recommended a treatment
mode of intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) every 8 weeks after a
24-week period of IVA every 4 weeks to obtain an optimal
outcome at 52 weeks [91].
Ranibizumab is a Fab fragment that specifically binds all
isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor A. Both the
BRAVO study (n = 397) and the BRIGHTER study (n = 455)
demonstrated with ranibizumab a statistically significant
superior improvement in best-correctedvisual acuity (BCVA)
compared with laser alone in patients with BRVO. No ocu-
lar side adverse effects (SAEs) were reported in this group
[90, 107]. Although many studies claimed that intravitreal
ranibizumab (IVR) can improve retinal nonperfusion, the
effect was usually limited [108]. As discussed above, patients
treated with IVR often have CME recurrence and needed
frequent additional injections to cause complete CME reso-
lution [95]. It is reported that four years after initial treat-
ment, half of the patients still require treatment, but most
of the outcomes were excellent [97]. In the natural course
of acute BRVO, intraretinal hemorrhage and CME are
absorbed gradually. However, IVR accelerates the speed of
absorption of intraretinal hemorrhage and is associated with
a rapid reduction of CME. Because there has been no
evidence that anti-VEGF drugs modify the function of
macrophages and microglia which can phagocytose debris
and red blood cells, one can only postulate that ranibizumab
does not facilitate the absorption of intraretinal hemorrhage
directly but rather suppresses new bleeding and thus seem-
ingly accelerates absorption [109].
Recently, conbercept (KH902), a recombinant and solu-
ble VEGF receptor fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1
with 100% human protein sequence, has been developed.
Because the addition of the binding domain of VEGFR-2,
conbercept can bind to all isoforms of VEGF-A, VEGF-B,
and placental growth factor, so it has a very strong effect on
antiangiogenesis [110, 111]. KH902 has been widely used
in China to treat ocular neovascular diseases which include
wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy with great success
and has been approved by FDA for stage III clinical trial
[112–114]. This kind of VEGF inhibitor is much cheaper,
while theoretically more efficient. However, conbercept has
not been proven to treat CME secondary to BRVO or
CRVO yet, but the phase III clinical trial has started in
China recently.
Different anti-VEGF drugs may have varying treatment
patterns and dosages. The recommended dosage is 0.5 mg,
2.0 mg, and 1.25mg for ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevaci-
zumab, respectively [115, 116]. Some specialists preferred a
monthly injection, while others employ a treat and extend
(TREX) or an as needed (pro re nata) regimen [93, 106,
117–120]. A recent study reported that BRVO patients can
receive good VA and central macular thickness (CMT) out-
comes with a lower frequency of intravitreal ranibizumab.
The total mean number of injections over 12months
follow-up was 2.1 for BRVO and 3.4 for CRVO [119]. In
addition, frequent injection of VEGF inhibitors may also
increase the risk of SAEs and could possibly lead to retinal
atrophy secondary to obstruction of neuroprotective cyto-
kines and regression of normal vasculature [121, 122]. There
is still limited data on the comparative effectiveness of differ-
ent anti-VEGF drugs at this time because the design of the

 studies varies from each other. Interestingly, bevacizumab is
the preferred treatment option by 61% of the US retina spe-
cialists followed by aflibercept (17%) and ranibizumab
(17%), as revealed by the American Society of Retina Spe-
cialists (ASRS) 2015 Membership Preferences and Trends
Survey. This indicates that economical considerations con-
tribute a major part toward decision making in clinical
practice [123].
7.2. Corticosteroids. Intravitreal corticosteroids is another
option, particularly in situations where the cost of treat-
ment and the monthly treatment burden of anti-VEGF
therapy is too difficult for patients [124]. The most com-
monly used steroid drug is triamcinolone acetonide (TA),
which is reported to have similar or even better short-
term outcomes especially in nonischemic BRVO compared
with anti-anti-VEGF drugs. Research has demonstrated
that both 3-month intravitreal injections of an anti-
VEGF agent bevacizumab and two IVTA injections 2
months apart could be effective in respect to both visual
and anatomical outcomes [125]. TA has much lower prices
but has a higher rate of adverse events like increased intraoc-
ular pressure (IOP), cataract progression, and sterile pseu-
doendophthalmitis [101, 124, 126–130]. The SCORE study
(n = 411) showed that the outcome of IVTA 1 mg groups is
similar to IVTA 4 mg groups and can lower the rate of
adverse events [131]. TA has numerous mechanisms of
action, including anti-inflammatory effects, antiangiogenic
properties and inhibition of VEGF, and other inflammatory
cytokine expressions, such as IL-6, ICAM-1, and MCP-1
[132, 133]. Ozkiris et al. evaluated the effect of TA injection
on persistent CME in BRVO that failed to respond to previ-
ous laser photocoagulation. During a mean follow-up time of
6.2 months, best-corrected VA improved significantly from
1.01 at baseline to 0.55 (LogMAR) at one month after the
injection. VA after 3 months was 0.56, and at the end of
follow-up was 0.62 [134]. Moreover, intravitreal TA (IVTA)
may also improve macular sensitivity and morphology in
patients with either ischemic or nonischemic BRVO [135].
Response to TA differs among eyes with edema, some
only needing one injection, while most patients still need
treatment for multiple times [136, 137]. Predictive factors
for successful IVTA treatment were younger age, shorter
duration of CME, initial onset CME, concurrent serous reti-
nal detachment, few concomitant systemic diseases, intact
foveal capillary ring, eyes with cystoid spaces in the outer
plexiform layer, and nonischemic BRVO [134, 138].
Posterior subtenon triamcinolone acetonide (STA) has
the advantage of easy injection and decreased risk of intraoc-
ular complications such as IOP elevation and cataract pro-
gression compared with IVTA, but the efficacy of STA is
thought to be slightly less than that of IVTA [136, 139, 140].
Another steroid therapy is the dexamethasone intravit-
real implant (Ozurdex), which provides continuous steroid
delivery over a more sustained period, permitting longer
duration of action and has been proved by previous stud-
ies [141–145]. The 12-month result of GENEVA trial (
n = 1196) showed that eyes receiving DEX implant 0.7 or
0.35 mg
achieved
a
15-letter
improvement
in
BCVA
significantly faster than the eyes receiving sham treatment.
At day 180, the cumulative response rate was 41% in the
DEX implant 0.7 mg group, 40% in the DEX implant
0.35 mg group, and 23% in the sham group. There was
no significant difference in efficacy and safety between
0.7 mg group and 0.35 mg group. However, the overall
incidence of ocular adverse events was significantly higher
in the DEX implant 0.7 mg group (62.9%) and DEX
implant 0.35 mg group (61.9%) than in the sham group
(42.8%; P < 0 001). The only adverse events that occurred
significantly more frequently were eye pain (P = 0 023),
ocular hypertension (P ≤ 0 002), and anterior chamber
cells (P ≤ 0 031). Most of the participants met the visual
acuity or retinal thickness criteria for retreatment at day
180 which showed as safe and well tolerated over 12 months.
The safety and efficacy profile after a second treatment with
DEX implant was generally similar to that seen after the first
treatment, and patients who had delayed treatment never
matched the improvement of those treated earlier in the
disease process [146, 147]. The ORVO study (n = 17) also
demonstrated that Ozurdex can reduce several properme-
ability proteins such as persephin, pentraxin 3, hepatocyte
growth factor, endocrine gland VEGF, insulin-like growth
factor binding proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines
like MCP-1 and IL17-E [148, 149]. Also, the SHASTA
study (n = 289) demonstrated that the visual acuity and
central retinal thickness significantly improved both after
initial or retreatment. 32.6% of patients were observed with
elevated IOP whereas only 1.7% needed glaucoma surgery
[150]. However, the OMAR study recently found no differ-
ence between Ozurdex and TA regarding anatomical or
functional outcomes or the incidence of side effects,
although the number of intravitreal injections was reduced
by using Ozurdex [151]. Selected clinical trials are summa-
rized in Table 2 [131, 146, 148, 150, 152]
7.3. Laser Photocoagulation. Venous occlusion is merely the
initiating event that causes retinal ischemia and high levels
of VEGF. The high levels of VEGF cause additional capillary
closure and worsening ischemia, resulting in a positive feed-
back loop and disease progression over time in some patients
[153, 154]. In 1986, the Branch Vein Occlusion Study
(BRVOS) reported the efficacy of grid-pattern laser photoco-
agulation for treating macular edema due to BRVO and rec-
ommended this method as the standard treatment for BRVO
[155]. The efficacy of grid-pattern laser photocoagulation is
thought to result from changes in the biochemical processes
within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or hypoxia in
the neural retina [156, 157]. The pigment epithelium-
derived factor, which can inhibit retinal and choroidal neo-
vascularization by inducing apoptosis in activated vascular
endothelial cells, is reported to be upregulated in photocoa-
gulated human retinal pigment epithelial cells [157, 158].
VEGF expression is found to increase a few days after laser
treatment and then start to decrease [159]. Moreover, direct
photocoagulation to leaking vessels and microaneurysms is
found to be beneficial for treating chronic macular edema
associated with chronic BRVO of longer than 12 months
duration [160].

 Peripheral scatter photocoagulation can reduce retinal
ischemia. Theoretically, it may provide a way to interrupt
the positive feedback loop in patients with BRVO and reduce
the need for injections of a VEGF antagonist. However, the
RELATE trial found that peripheral scatter laser did not
benefit in BCVA, resolution of edema, or number of ranibi-
zumab injections [92]. The group has also come up with
three speculations: (1) the untreated area is hypoxic and
can still release enough VEGF to cause persistent or recurrent
edema; (2) chronic hypoxia, high levels of VEGF, and recur-
rent leakage can lead to structural changes in retina vessels;
and (3) the reduction of VEGF is countered by inflammation
and production of propermeability factors induced by photo-
coagulation [92].
Conventional laser therapy can result in enlarged retinal
scars, subretinal fibrosis, choroidal neovascularization, and
reduced macular sensitivity [161–164]. Subthreshold micro-
pulse diode laser photocoagulation (SMDLP) is a less inva-
sive treatment than conventional focal or grid laser therapy
designed to produce lesions on the retinal pigment epithe-
lium (RPE) while having minimal effect on the neurosensory
retina. Small studies have demonstrated good clinical out-
comes with micropulse laser, for initial visual acuity better
or worse than 20/40, although larger studies are necessary
[165–168]. However, in specific subsets of patients such
as recurrent CME after conventional laser treatment, anti-
VEGF treatment is still the preferred treatment rather than
SMDLP [102].
Efficacy of conventional laser treatment is always lim-
ited, compared with anti-VEGF therapy and corticoste-
roids [90, 91, 169]. As a result, anti-VEGF therapy has
taken the place of conventional laser treatment as first-line
treatment for CME, and many studies put laser treatment
as a rescue therapy or in combination therapy [97, 101, 170].
Another rarely used technique is laser-induced arteriolar
construction (ACo), first described by L’Esperance in 1975.
ACo is based on the sacrificial constriction of the afferent
arteriole in the occluded BRVO region. Results using
ACo have reported significantly improved BCVA in BRVO
patients [171, 172]. Constriction of the afferent artery in
the BRVO region accelerated the restoration of potassium
channels and IL-6. These alterations may contribute to
faster resorption of retinal edema and may decrease the
level of inflammation [173]. However, further prospective
randomized studies are needed.
7.4. Surgery. Considering the mechanism of vein occlusion,
arteriovenous sheathotomy (AVS) would appear to be a
reasonable treatment for BRVO. In 1988, Osterloh and
Charles were the first to report a surgical procedure
involving dissection of the common adventitial sheath at
the level of the arteriovenous blockage site for decompres-
sing the arteriovenous crossing [174]. The AVS not only
released the pressure at A/V crossing but also decreased
the IL-6 expression [175]. The efficacy of this method, how-
ever, was controversial [176–179]. A recent clinical trial
using a modified control group demonstrated that eyes which
went through AVS had significantly better vision acuity and
central macular thickness than those in the control group,
which is thought to be more convincing than the previous
studies. But they also conducted internal limiting membrane
peeling during the surgery, which may have some impact on
the result [180]. Another study found that the pars plana vit-
rectomy (PPV) combined with AVS is safe and effective
and can cause the disappearance of collateral vessels at
the blockage site, which is an important clinical marker
for intravascular reperfusion [181].
In 2004, Charbonnel et al. reported that eyes with an ini-
tial posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) had less improve-
ment of visual acuity than those without a PVD after AVS
and suggested that the surgical detachment of posterior
hyaloid could be as important (or more) as the sheathotomy
itself [182]. This theory was replicated by another study
which showed that there was no significant difference in the
improvement of macular function between the vitrectomy
with or without arteriovenous adventitial sheathotomy group
[183]. Similarly, vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane
(ILM) peeling has been suggested as a potential treatment
because it is generally believed that vitreous traction on the
macula leads to fluid accumulation in the retina. Removal
of posterior hyaloid may improve oxygenation of the retina
[184]. However, Arai et al. found no difference in the results
of vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling
and that without ILM peeling, emphasizing the importance
of vitrectomy [185]. Vitrectomy can help remove the vitreo-
macular traction and thus improve cytokines that affect
vascular permeability. It was also reported that the oxygen
tension is higher after vitrectomy, resulting in capillary
shrinkage, reduced blood vessel leakage, and absorption of
macular edema [186]. Posterior vitreous adhesion is thus
considered an independent risk factor and also a prognostic
factor for BRVO, and vitrectomy may be the most valuable
part of the surgery [56, 75].
Another surgical method is the retinal bypass surgery, the
feasibility has been proved recently this year, but the efficacy
still needs further study [187]. Although surgery may not be
the first choice to most physicians, it is still an option when
other treatment is not effective in some patients [188].
7.5. Medical Treatment. It is reported that an increase in
small platelet aggregates may play a component in BRVO
pathogenesis.
Beraprost
and
ticlopidine
inhibit
small
aggregate formation in BRVO patients and may represent
effective antiplatelet treatments [189]. Houtsmuller et al.
compared the effect of ticlopidine, an antiplatelet aggrega-
tive factor, versus placebo in 54 patients with BRVO and
found a significant improvement in visual acuity in 69%
BRVO patients of ticlopidine group versus 52% of the pla-
cebo group in a six-month follow-up [190]. Glacet Bernard
et al. examined the efficacy of troxerutin, an antierythrocyte
and antiplatelet aggregative drug, versus placebo in 26
patients with BRVO less than five months from symptom
onset. In a two-year follow-up, there was a significant
improvement in visual acuity, as well as in macular edema,
in patients treated with troxerutin compared to those treated
with placebo [191].
Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) intravitreally or
directly into the retinal vein is another treatment option
9
Journal of Ophthalmology
 for BRVO. Small studies have demonstrated the safety and
an improvement in visual acuity and foveal thickness with
t-PA treatment [192–196].
Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been
also used and are considered to be effective for the treat-
ment of BRVO, supporting the hypothesis that BRVO is
a venous thrombotic disorder. No increased risk of vitre-
ous hemorrhages was observed during treatment with
LMWH while there was an improvement in the visual
acuity [197, 198].
NSAIDs have been used to reduce the occurrence and
severity of macular edema after cataract surgery, without
causing elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). A recent
study with 15 BRVO patients suggested that intravitreal
diclofenac is also safe and effective in improving BCVA
and decreasing CMT in patients with BRVO and ME with
the mean visual acuity improvement from 0.115 ±0.03
preoperatively to 0.356 ±0.29 (LogMAR). The mean pre-
operative CMT decreased from 453.2 μm± 55.3 μm to
340.47 μm± 101 μm at 3 months [199].
These medical therapies have demonstrated possible
efficacy in treating CME due to BRVO in small studies.
However, due to a small number of patients, further studies
are necessary to ensure effectiveness.
7.6. Isovolemic Hemodilution. BRVO has been found to be
associated with hyperviscosity due to higher hematocrit
and plasma viscosity [22, 200]. Viscosity is mainly depen-
dent upon the hematocrit and plasma fibrinogen. Higher
blood viscosity is less important when blood flow rate is
rapid. In conditions of low flow, as is likely in a vein pre-
disposed to occlusion, the effect of viscosity becomes
increasingly significant as a result of increased red cell
aggregation. The enhanced aggregation at slow flow rates fur-
ther decreases flow leading to a vicious cycle of increased vis-
cosity promoting increased aggregation which further
increases viscosity, resulting in a state of “rheological
obstruction” [22, 201]. Additionally, the occlusion-induced
hypoxia will increase blood viscosity as acidosis increases
red cell aggregability and reduces red cell deformability
[202, 203]. And both these red cell anomalies may pre-exist
in patients with BRVO [204]. A study investigated 34 BRVO
patients and obtained positive effect on the visual outcome
with a target hematocrit of 35%. The visual acuity in the iso-
volemic hemodilution therapy group improved by 0.20 Log-
MAR units at 6 weeks and 0.43 −LogMAR units at 1
year, which was statistically significant compared with that
in the control group [23]. However, the systemic compli-
cations of this method make it less desirable than other
available therapies.
7.7. Combined Therapy. There are many forms of treatment
to BRVO as described above. Therefore, some investigators
came up with the idea that combination therapy with two
or more agents may be beneficial to get better outcomes with
lowered dose, rate of adverse events, and less frequent treat-
ment. Repeated intravitreal injections of an anti-VEGF can
cause adverse effects such as ocular pain, ischemic retinopa-
thy, and endophthalmitis, in addition to the high cost of
anti-VEGF drugs like ranibizumab [205, 206]. It is reported
that bevacizumab combined with macular grid and scatter
laser photocoagulation targeted retinal photocoagulation
(TRP) of peripheral nonperfused areas (NPAs) could signifi-
cantly improve vision, reduce macular edema, and prevent
the recurrence of CME better than bevacizumab alone [207,
208]. Also, a lower number of reinjections were observed in
the combined treatment [209]. The application of topical
bromfenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during
IVB therapy in eyes with ME secondary to BRVO, was found
to have the advantage of reducing the number of injections
although it did not affect the visual prognosis [210]. Other
combination therapies that have been investigated include
corticosteroids with laser, anti-VEGF agents with corticoste-
roids, anti-VEGF agents with laser, and AVS or PPV with
corticosteroids, to name a few [211–219]. Although most of
these studies reported excellent outcomes, it is difficult to
compare between studies to discern which is the best
combination.
15. Conclusion
Branch retinal vein occlusion is a very common retinal dis-
ease. Numerous studies have been carried out evaluating
every aspect of this ocular vascular dysfunction. The most
commonly used treatments at this time are anti-VEGF drugs
and corticosteroids, since they bring about significant
improvement in VA and CMT with relatively fewer compli-
cations. Even if one treatment is not effective in particular
patients, there are numerous treatments and combination
therapies that can be considered. Novel treatments have rev-
olutionized our care of patients with retinal vein occlusions.
Further studies into the pathophysiology, risk factors, and
treatment of retinal vein occlusions remain ongoing, and
we continue to improve our treatment of patients with this
difficult disease through personalized medicine and develop-
ment of new methods and treatments.
