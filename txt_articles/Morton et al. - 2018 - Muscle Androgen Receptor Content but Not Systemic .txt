The factors that underpin heterogeneity in muscle hypertrophy following resistance
exercise training (RET) remain largely unknown. We examined circulating hormones,
intramuscular hormones, and intramuscular hormone-related variables in resistance-
trained men before and after 12 weeks of RET. Backward elimination and principal
component regression evaluated the statistical significance of proposed circulating
anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone,
dihydrotestosterone, insulin-like growth factor-1, free insulin-like growth factor-1,
luteinizing hormone, and growth hormone) and RET-induced changes in muscle mass
(n = 49). Immunoblots and immunoassays were used to evaluate intramuscular free
testosterone levels, dihydrotestosterone levels, 5α-reductase expression, and androgen
receptor content in the highest- (HIR; n = 10) and lowest- (LOR; n = 10) responders
to the 12 weeks of RET. No hormone measured before exercise, after exercise, pre-
intervention, or post-intervention was consistently significant or consistently selected
in the final model for the change in: type 1 cross sectional area (CSA), type 2 CSA,
or fat- and bone-free mass (LBM). Principal component analysis did not result in large
dimension reduction and principal component regression was no more effective than
unadjusted regression analyses. No hormone measured in the blood or muscle was
different between HIR and LOR. The steroidogenic enzyme 5α-reductase increased
following RET in the HIR (P < 0.01) but not the LOR (P = 0.32). Androgen receptor
content was unchanged with RET but was higher at all times in HIR. Unlike intramuscular
free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or 5α-reductase, there was a linear relationship
between androgen receptor content and change in LBM (P < 0.01), type 1 CSA
(P < 0.05), and type 2 CSA (P < 0.01) both pre- and post-intervention. These
results indicate that intramuscular androgen receptor content, but neither circulating
nor intramuscular hormones (or the enzymes regulating their intramuscular production),
influence skeletal muscle hypertrophy following RET in previously trained young men.

Androgen Receptor and Muscle Hypertrophy
INTRODUCTION
There is substantial individual variability in RET-induced skeletal
muscle hypertrophy (Hubal et al., 2005; Davidsen et al., 2011).
The post-exercise rise in circulating, presumably anabolic,
hormones (e.g., T, GH, and IGF-1) are believed to be causative in
determining RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Kraemer
et al., 2017; Mangine et al., 2017). However, there is substantial
contrary evidence for a causal, or even related (i.e., sharing
common variance) role of such hormones in both RET-
induced increases in muscle protein synthesis (West et al.,
2009) and hypertrophy (West et al., 2010; West and Phillips,
2012; Mitchell et al., 2013; Morton et al., 2016; Mobley et al.,
2018).
It is plausible that, as opposed to systemic circulating
hormones, local intramuscular androgenesis could mediate
RET-induced
muscle
hypertrophy
as
has
been
proposed
for older men (Sato et al., 2014). In addition, the RET-
induced
increase
in
intramuscular
androgen
receptor
content has been significantly correlated with RET-induced
muscle hypertrophy (Ahtiainen et al., 2011; Mitchell et al.,
2013). Thus, it may be that an increase in intramuscular
androgens
and/or
their
receptors,
via
an
autocrine
mechanism,
are
important
in
determining
RET-induced
hypertrophy.
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
the
heterogeneity in RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy,
measured
using
multiple
indices,
was
associated
with
circulating hormones, intramuscular hormones, intramuscular
steroidogenic enzyme content, or androgen receptor content. We
performed additional statistical and intramuscular analyses
on
data
from
a
previous
study
in
healthy,
resistance-
trained men (n = 49; Morton et al., 2016). To further
explore the relationship between systemic hormones and
hypertrophy we used backward elimination and principal
component regression on systemic hormone concentrations
both
at
rest
and
post-resistance
exercise
with
indices
of
hypertrophy
as
separate
outcome
variables
in
all
participants. To evaluate the significance of intramuscular
androgenesis we completed an analysis on only our highest-
(HIR – top quintile) and lowest- (LOR – bottom quintile)
responders
that
included
evaluation
of
intramuscular
T,
DHT,
5α-reductase
expression,
and
androgen
receptor
content. Consistent with our previous work (West et al.,
2010;
West
and
Phillips,
2012;
Mitchell
et
al.,
2013;
Morton
et
al.,
2016),
we
hypothesized
that
circulating
systemic hormones would not be related to any measure of
hypertrophy; however, we hypothesized, given previous findings
(Ahtiainen et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2013), that androgen
receptor
content
would
be
associated
with
RET-induced
hypertrophy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Resistance Exercise
Training Intervention
Forty-nine resistance-trained (performing RET at least 2
days/week [range 3–
6 days/week] for 4 ± 6 years) young
men volunteered for this study. Each participant was informed
of associated risks with the RET intervention and testing
and the study was carried out in accordance with the
recommendations of the most recent Tri-Council statement on
research in human participants1. The protocol was approved
by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board and all
subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered at
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ as NCT02139865. An overview of
the RET intervention can be read in detail in the original
manuscript (Morton et al., 2016). Briefly, participants were
randomly allocated to either a high repetition (HR) or low
repetition (LR) group. The HR group performed all exercises
with relatively light resistance [∼30–
50% of their repetition
maximum (RM)] until volitional failure (20–
25 repetitions)
and the LR group performed all exercises with relatively
heavy resistance (∼75–
90% RM), also until volitional failure
(8–
12 repetitions). Each participant underwent a 12-week
RET intervention where they performed whole-body RET 4
days/week and received 30 g of whey protein isolate twice
per day (BioPRO; Davisco Foods International, Le Sueur, MN,
United States).
Blood Collection and Hormone Analysis
The pre- and post-intervention testing day was performed
after an overnight fast at the same time of day for each
participant. Each participant performed an acute bout of
resistance exercise within their designated group assignment
(HR or LR) and blood was drawn from an intravenous
catheter inserted in an antecubital vein. Two 4 mL vacutainer
tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
United States) were collected pre-exercise and 0-, 15-, 30-,
and 60-min post-exercise. One 4 mL tube was allowed to
clot for 30 min at room temperature to later isolate serum
and the other was heparinized to later isolate plasma. Blood
sample analysis was done blinded for: cortisol (nM), LH
(IU/L),
lactate
(mM),
DHEA
(ng/mL),
T
(ng/mL),
free
T (fT; ng/dL; i.e., testosterone that is not bound to sex
hormone-binding globulin or albumin in the blood), DHT
(ng/mL),
and
GH
(ng/mL)

(fIGF-1;

using

post-resistance exercise AUC was calculated for each hormone,
using the trapezoidal rule, with time points at 0, 15, 30, and
60 min.

Panels A–C adapted from Morton et al. (2016).
Stepwise Regressions
HR and LR data were collapsed due to a lack of difference
in both circulating hormones and outcomes between-groups
(Morton et al., 2016). The outcomes considered were type 1
fiber CSA, type 2 fiber CSA, and fat- and bone-free (lean) body
mass (LBM). Each outcome at each time of measurement (i.e.,
the change, absolute pre-, and absolute post-intervention values)
were regressed against hormones from each time point: pre-
intervention resting, pre-intervention post-exercise AUC, post-
intervention resting, and post-intervention post-exercise AUC.
Backward elimination, with the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) as the elimination criterion, was used to choose the final
model. The post-exercise AUC values used in the analysis did not
subtract out the resting concentrations. We did, however, run the
analysis with the resting concentrations subtracted from the AUC
raw values and there were no major differences in our results.
Immunoblot Analysis
As
previously
described
(Aizawa
et
al.,
2010),
after
homogenization,
the
protein
concentration
of
resulting
supernatant was determined by a Bradford protein assay,
and muscle proteins (both cytoplasmic and nuclear, 20 µg
protein) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States). The membranes were
blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in phosphate-
buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated
for 12 h at 4◦C with primary antibodies against androgen
receptor (#3202, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,
United States) and 5α-reductase (H00006715, Abnova, Taipei,
Taiwan) diluted to 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The membranes
were washed three times with PBST before being incubated
for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (#7074, Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, United States) diluted to 1:3000
in the blocking buffer. The membranes were then washed
with PBST three times. The proteins were detected using an
enhanced chemiluminescence plus system (GE Healthcare
Biosciences) and visualized on an LAS4000 imager (GE
Healthcare Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified using
ImageJ version 1.46 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, United States).
Enzyme Immunoassays for
Intramuscular Hormones
Muscle sample was homogenized using the same method as the
immunoblot analysis. The levels of T and DHT in skeletal muscle
were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
kit, after being diluted 200 times with each assay buffer as
previously described (Horii et al., 2016). The immobilized
polyclonal antibodies were raised against T (Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, MI, United States) and DHT (IBL Hamburg,
Germany) before secondary horseradish peroxidase antibodies
were added. Optical density at 450 nm was qualified on a
microplate reader (BioLumin 960; Molecular Dynamics, Tokyo,
Japan) and were assayed in duplicate. The coefficient of
variation value was 3.0 and r2 = 0.974 in the present study.
The researchers that performed the intramuscular analyses
(KS and SF) were not blinded to which samples were HIR
and LOR.

components derived from systemic hormones measured: (A) pre-intervention post-exercise, (B) post-intervention post-exercise, (C) pre-intervention resting, and
(D) post-intervention resting. The dotted horizontal line indicates the cut-off point where the principal components above explained ≥80% variance between the
original data set of hormones.
Principal Component Analysis and
Regression
The data were centered and scaled before principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed on the hormones from each time
of measurement (pre-intervention resting, pre-intervention post-
exercise AUC, post-intervention resting, and post-intervention
post-exercise AUC). The purpose of PCA is to use orthogonal
transformation to create a set of new linear, uncorrelated
variables (principal components), a subset of which is taken
that effectively accounts for most of the variability seen in
the original data. Ultimately, these principal components are
linear combinations of the original variables (e.g., hormones)
that are later used as covariates in regression analyses herein.
We present the PCA here in scree plots. Backward elimination
was performed on the principal components (i.e., principal
component regression) using AIC as the model fit criterion. PCA
and principal component regression were performed in R (R Core
Team, 2017).
High- vs. Low-Responders
Skeletal muscle biopsies from each participant’
s vastus lateralis
and DXA were used to assess the change in fiber CSA (both
type 1 and type 2) and LBM, respectively, as described in
detail elsewhere (Morton et al., 2016). The determination
of HIR and LOR was done by individually ranking (from
1 to 49) the change in each outcome for each participant
and then averaging each participant’
s rank across all three
outcomes (type 1 CSA, type 2 CSA, and LBM). With a
probability of type II error (alpha) of 0.05, a type I error
probability (beta) of 0.20, and a relatively moderate expected
difference in RET-induced changes in muscle mass between
HIR and LOR (effect size, f = 0.60), a priori sample size
calculations required 18 participants (nine in each group).
Thus, the top quintile (n = 10) of ranked participants were
categorized as the HIR and the bottom quintile (n = 10) of
ranked participants were categorized as the LOR. Statistical
analyses between HIR and LOR was performed using SPSS
(version 22.0, Chicago, IL, United States). Type 1 CSA, type
2 CSA, LBM, and all intramuscular hormone-related data
were analyzed using a two-factor (group × time) repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with group (HIR vs.
LOR) and time (pre- vs. post-intervention) as the experimental
variables. If indicated, independent two-tailed t-tests were run
to evaluate any differences between-groups at a specific time
point (e.g., pre-intervention intramuscular T). Correlations
between intramuscular outcomes and the change in type 1
CSA, type 2 CSA, and LBM were performed in SPSS (version
22.0, Chicago, IL, United States). Statistical significance was
accepted when P < 0.05. Data are presented as box and

RESULTS
Changes in Muscle Mass With
Resistance Exercise Training
Fifty-six
participants
were
recruited
and
49
participants
completed the whole intervention (HR: n = 24, LR: n = 25;
23 ± 2 years, 86 ± 5 kg, 181 ± 6 cm). Two individuals
dropped out from the LR group due to work relocation and a
non-intervention related injury and five individuals dropped
out of the HR group due to either a change in location or
a non-intervention related injury. Twelve weeks of RET
resulted in an increase in type 1 CSA (665 ± 149 µm2),
type 2 CSA (978 ± 189 µm2), and LBM (1.22 ± 1.37 kg,
P < 0.01; Figures 1A–C, respectively; Morton et al., 2016).
There
were
no
differences
between
repetition
groups
(HR versus LR – see Morton et al., 2016) for any of the
outcomes.
Stepwise Regressions
For each outcome (change in type 1 CSA, type 2 CSA,
and LBM) none of the post-exercise AUC (Table 1) or
the
resting
concentrations
(Table
2)
of
any
hormone
measured either pre- or post-intervention were consistently
significant (i.e., significant with multiple outcomes or at
more than one time of measurement) in the final models.
Furthermore,
the
coefficients
of
determination
(i.e.,
R2)
values were low (<0.25) for all outcomes at each time of
measurement indicating that little of the variation seen in
the hypertrophic response can be explained by any model
fitted here. Similar results were found when evaluating the
pre- and post-intervention type 1 CSA, type 2 CSA, and LBM
against
resting
hormone
concentrations
(Supplementary
Table 1).
Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis was performed on centered and
scaled predictors and is presented here as scree plots for
the pre-intervention post-exercise AUC (Figure 2A), post-
intervention post-exercise AUC (Figure 2B), pre-intervention
resting concentrations (Figure 2C), and post-intervention resting
concentrations (Figure 2D). As illustrated by the shallow-sloped
FIGURE 3 | Intramuscular (A) free testosterone concentration, (B) dihydrotestosterone concentration, (C) 5α-reductase expression, and (D) androgen receptor
content presented pre- and post-intervention in both high- and low-responders. Representative immunoblots for 5α-reductase expression (C) and androgen
receptor content (D) are shown between HIR and LOR both pre- and post-intervention with their respective weights. Values are presented as median (lines) with
interquartile range (boxes), range (minimum and maximum), and mean (cross). †Significant difference between pre- and post-intervention (P < 0.01). ∗Significant

scree plots, no principal component was particularly effective at
explaining variance in the original data set.
We chose to keep the number of principal components that
explain ≥80% of the variance in the original predictors, which
resulted in seven principal components included in each of our
principal component stepwise regressions. Running principal
component stepwise regression (regardless of whether the
hormones were evaluated at rest, post-exercise, pre-intervention,
or post-intervention) revealed that no principal component
was consistently significant or consistently included in any of
the final models and that the final R2 never exceeded 0.25
and was as low as 0.05 (Supplementary Tables 2–
4). These
results indicate that very little of the variation seen in the
hypertrophic response to RET can be explained by any of the
fitted models.
High- vs. Low-Responders
There was a significant difference between HIR and LOR
in the change in type 1 CSA (HIR: 2106 ± 412, LOR:
−520 ± 450 µm2), type 2 CSA (HIR: 2642 ± 756, LOR:
−373 ± 593 µm2), and LBM (HIR: 2.1 ± 0.8, LOR: 0.6 ± 0.8 kg,
P ≤ 0.001; Figures 1D–F). There was no difference in
the number of participants from each training group (HIR:
four and six and LOR: six and four from HR and LR,
respectively).
There was no difference in any resting hormone concentration
between HIR and LOR with the exception of the post-
intervention resting concentration of LH (HIR: 3.67 ± 0.63; LOR
4.59 ± 1.15 IU/L, P < 0.01) and lactate (HIR: 0.52 ± 0.05;
LOR: 0.55 ± 0.07 mM, P = 0.02), which were greater in the
LOR. There was no difference in the post-exercise AUC for any
hormone between HIR and LOR with the exception of pre-
intervention post-exercise cortisol, which was higher in the HIR
(HIR: 576 ± 100; LOR: 508 ± 199 nM; P < 0.001).
Intramuscular Hormones
There were no differences in the pre-intervention, post-
intervention, or change in intramuscular T or DHT between
HIR and LOR (Figures 3A,B, respectively). The change in
5α-reductase expression was significant in HIR (pre: 1457 ± 450,
post: 1957 ± 543 AU, P < 0.01) but not in LOR (pre:
1748 ± 559, post: 1994 ± 840 AU, P = 0.32; Figure 3C).
The pre-intervention (HIR: 10827 ± 2789, LOR: 7759 ± 1323
AU, P < 0.01) and post-intervention (HIR: 11406 ± 2789,
LOR: 7801 ± 1189 AU, P = 0.01; Figure 3D) intramuscular
androgen receptor content was significantly greater in HIR
versus LOR. There was no change in intramuscular androgen
receptor content pre- to post-intervention (�319 ± 1314
AU, P = 0.75) and there was a linear relationship between
the participants’pre- and post-intervention androgen receptor
content (r = 0.92).
There were no significant correlations between the pre-
intervention, post-intervention, or change in intramuscular T,
DHT, or 5α-reductase with the change in type 1 CSA, type
2 CSA, or LBM (P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 5). In
contrast, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and the average
between pre- and post-intervention androgen receptor content
was significantly correlated with the change in LBM (pre: r = 0.76,
P < 0.01; post: r = 0.75, P < 0.01; average: r = 0.77, P < 0.01),
type 1 CSA (pre: r = 0.51, P = 0.03; post: r = 0.49, P = 0.04;
average: r = 0.51, P = 0.03), and type 2 CSA (pre: r = 0.61,
P < 0.01; post: r = 0.65, P < 0.01; average: r = 0.64, P < 0.01;
Supplementary Table 5 and Figure 4). One participant’
s data
was removed from the regression analyses that included the
change in LBM because it was identified as a statistical outlier
via the robust regression and outlier removal method at a
coefficient of 1% (Motulsky and Brown, 2006). We have indicated
the location of this participant in Figure 4 for illustrative
purposes.

DISCUSSION
The main finding of the present study, consistent with
our previous work, was that no systemic hormone shared
significant variance with RET-induced changes in skeletal muscle
fiber CSA or skeletal muscle mass in resistance-trained men
(Tables 1, 2). We extend these findings to include local muscle-
measured hormonal concentrations, which also did not show
a significant association with any index of hypertrophy. We
found that HIR had increased 5α-reductase content following
12 weeks of RET and had significantly higher androgen
receptor content, which did not change with RET, than
LOR both prior to- and after-RET (Figure 3). We conclude
that neither systemic nor local muscular hormone availability
influence RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy
young men. Consistent with previous work, we propose
instead that the magnitude of RET-induced skeletal muscle
hypertrophy is modulated in part by intramuscular androgen
receptor content (Figure 4) and likely other intramuscular
variables.
Circulating Hormones and Resistance
Exercise Training
Recent publications (Kraemer et al., 2017; Mangine et al., 2017)
and guidelines (Ratamess et al., 2009) claim that circulating
hormones are mechanistically and directly related to, and
predictive of, RET-induced changes in skeletal muscle mass
despite contrary evidence that they are not (West et al., 2010;
West and Phillips, 2012; Mitchell et al., 2013; Morton et al.,
2016; Mobley et al., 2018). In a previous study, we ran 120
correlations, each on 49 participants, between 10 different
hormones and various measures of changes in muscle mass
and strength. We found that only the post-exercise rise in
cortisol was correlated with changes in type 2 CSA (pre-
intervention: r = −0.34, P = 0.02; post-intervention: r = −0.31,
P = 0.04) (Morton et al., 2016). Others have found significant
correlations between the post-exercise rise in circulating GH
(McCall et al., 1999) and T (Ahtiainen et al., 2003; Brook
et al., 2016) with changes in muscle mass but those correlations
were run on samples consisting of less than 11 participants,
which could give rise to spurious correlations. Here, we ran
an additional 48 stepwise regressions from 49 participants, 10
hormones, and three separate hypertrophy-related outcomes
including muscle fiber size. We found that no hormone was
consistently significant, nor did any final model have a high
coefficient of determination, i.e., all R2 values were below
0.25. Moreover, PCA was not effective at reducing the total
variance amongst the original hormone data (Figure 2) and
there was no regression model with the principal components
used as covariates that explained a meaningful proportion of
the variability in any outcome (Supplementary Tables 2–
4).
There is now substantial evidence to suggest that circulating
systemic hormones measured at rest (McCall et al., 1999;
Morton et al., 2016; Mobley et al., 2018) and/or post-exercise
(Ahtiainen et al., 2003; West et al., 2010; West and Phillips,
2012; Mitchell et al., 2013; Morton et al., 2016) share no
common variance and are thus neither related to nor predictive
of RET-induced changes in muscle mass in healthy young
participants.
A recent study (Mangine et al., 2017) used partial least
squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and reported
that a model with composite hormonal scores (T, GH, IGF-1,
insulin, and cortisol) and a composite measure of hypertrophy
(muscle CSA and thickness from the vastus lateralis and rectus
femoris) resulted in a significant coefficient of determination
(R2 = 0.73). The interpretation of this finding was that the
composite hormonal score was related to a composite score of

Androgen Receptor and Muscle Hypertrophy
hypertrophy. What is troubling with this interpretation is that
the model without T (the model’
s best hormonal predictor)
still had a substantial coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.43)
with the hypertrophy composite score and was statistically
significant. In fact, individual removal of the other hormones
(GH, IGF-1, insulin, and cortisol) showed negligible effect on
the shared variance of the model and yet the model without
its ‘
best’predictive hormone, T, accounted for almost 60% of
the variance seen with that hormone present in the model.
While the authors argued for unexplained interactions between
hormones as being a reason for the model variance without
T, we suggest it is more likely that PLS weights capitalize on
chance to exaggerate the correlations (Goodhue et al., 2012).
While we see value in PLS-SEM for examination of large datasets,
there are substantial limitations to interpretation when small
sample sizes (n = 26) are used (Goodhue et al., 2012). Defining
PLS as an appropriate SEM method has also been called into
question for estimation and inference (Rönkkö and Evermann,
2013) and the coefficient of determination (e.g., R2) is a poor
yardstick for assessing PLS-SEM model fit because inconsistent
estimators can produce models with high R2. Consequently,
not all well-fit models are predictive (Henseler et al., 2014)
and not all predictive models are well-fit (McIntosh et al.,
2014).
High- vs. Low-Responders to Resistance
Exercise Training
To investigate potential determinants of the heterogeneity in
RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Hubal et al., 2005;
Davidsen et al., 2011; Morton et al., 2016), we stratified 49
participants into HIR (n = 10) and LOR (n = 10) based
on their change in three indicators of skeletal muscle mass
(type 1 CSA, type 2 CSA, and LBM; Figure 1). Despite
large between-group differences in each outcome there were
no meaningful differences in any circulating pre- or post-
exercise hormone measured either pre- or post-intervention.
Considering steroid hormones are lipid-soluble (e.g., they
diffuse across the sarcolemma according to their concentration
gradient) it is not surprising that intramuscular T and
DHT measured pre- and post-intervention were also not
different between HIR and LOR (Figure 3). The lack of
difference in circulating and intramuscular hormones between
HIR
and
LOR
provides
evidence
that
neither
hormone
delivery to the muscle nor the transfer of steroid hormones
inside the muscle are rate-limiting steps in healthy, young
individuals.
Androgen receptor content was significantly higher both
pre- and post-intervention in the HIR compared to the LOR
(Figure 3) and was correlated with changes in muscle mass
(Figure 4). Though another group has found no difference
in androgen receptor content between HIR and LOR to
RET (Mobley et al., 2018), it is important to acknowledge
the differences in study design (e.g., untrained vs. trained
participants) and outcome measurements (i.e., cluster analysis
based on muscle thickness vs. an aggregate score of DXA and fiber
CSA) between them and our work, respectively. The function

receptor content and changes in muscle mass. Correlations are presented in
panels for: (A) type 1 CSA (r = 0.51, P = 0.03), (B) type 2 CSA (r = 0.61,
P < 0.01), and (C) LBM (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). In (C), the outlier that was

receptor content and LBM is included on the figure as an ‘×.’
of an androgen receptor is, when bound with an androgen,
to translocate to the nucleus and modify expression of target
genes [reviewed elsewhere (Beato and Klug, 2000)], many of
which are known targets involved in skeletal muscle growth
and development (Wyce et al., 2010). Indeed, when androgen
receptors are knocked out in male mice there is a significant
reduction in muscle mass and strength (MacLean et al., 2008).
Importantly, most steroid hormones have a high affinity with

Morton et al.
Androgen Receptor and Muscle Hypertrophy
their steroid receptors. For example, the dissociation constant of
the androgen receptor to T and DHT is only ∼0.2 to 0.5 nM
(Wilson and French, 1976). In the present study, at rest, the
molarity of serum T (HIR: 28 ± 7; LOR: 31 ± 7 nM), serum
fT (HIR: 0.5 ± 0.01; LOR: 0.5 ± 0.01 nM) and serum DHT
(HIR and LOR: 0.7 ± 0.2 nM) all exceeded 0.2–
0.5 nM.
Given there was no difference in circulating or intramuscular
hormones between HIR and LOR, along with high androgen-
androgen receptor binding affinity, it seems likely that both
at rest and post-exercise existing androgen receptors would
have been saturated in skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that
though androgen delivery may be a rate-limiting step for RET-
induced muscle hypertrophy in hypogonadal men (Bhasin et al.,
1997; Kvorning et al., 2013), androgen receptor content is the
more important variable in RET-induced androgen-mediated
skeletal muscle protein accretion in healthy men (Diver et al.,
2003).
Limitations
We performed 120 correlations in a previous study (Morton
et al., 2016) and 48 stepwise regressions here (24 on original
data and 24 on the principal components). Applying multiple
analyses on the same data was intentional data mining to
demonstrate the lack of ability of resting or post-exercise
circulating and intramuscular hormones to predict baseline
or RET-induced changes in skeletal muscle mass. We could
have performed additional statistics to account for multiple
testing but this would be uninformative because none of our
models explained much variance (as assessed by R2 values,
which did not exceed 0.25). We also acknowledge that although
we included a large sample size (n = 49) for our systemic
hormone analysis we limited ourselves to a relatively smaller
sample size (n = 20) for our HIR and LOR comparison.
We fully admit that in the case of the androgen receptor
correlation what we present is an inflated estimate due to
the choice of measuring only higher and lower responders
to our training protocol. We did our analysis this way to
illustrate the difference in RET-induced muscle hypertrophy
and investigate the influence of circulating and intramuscular
hormone-variables on two distinct groups. Though we were
limited by the amount of tissue collected, it is a fair critique that
our correlational analysis would be more telling if we included
all participants and if we performed additional analyses [e.g.,
nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of androgen receptor content
as well as multiple gene expressions (Cheung et al., 2017)].
Hence, there is an opportunity for future work to focus on the
specific biology that governs androgen receptor regulation and
function. Others have postulated that mass spectrometry analysis
(as opposed to immunoassays) is necessary to detect small,
intramuscular concentrations of steroid hormones (Handelsman
and Wartofsky, 2013); however, our intent was to analyze our
samples using methods similar to those that others have used
in exercise science, which may be dissimilar to those in clinical
endocrinology. We recognize that using DXA to measure changes
in LBM is not the gold standard, which is why we elected
to also include change in type 1 and type 2 fiber CSA to
determine our HIR and LOR (Buckinx et al., 2018). In regards
to our interpretation, it is naïve to suggest that androgen
signaling is exclusively operational via its tendency to bind to
an androgen receptor [reviewed elsewhere (Herbst and Bhasin,
2004; Dubois et al., 2012)]. Though transcriptional regulation
(e.g., androgen–
androgen receptor signaling) is evidenced here
as a potent modulator of RET-induced changes in muscle mass,
it is also clear that post-transcriptional regulation is at least
equally as important for protein synthesis (Schwanhausser et al.,
2011) as has been highlighted by recent findings (Figueiredo
et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2017; Mobley et al., 2018) and
reviews (Chaillou et al., 2014; McGlory et al., 2017). Lastly,
though there is genetic influence that underpins RET-induced
skeletal muscle hypertrophy, there are still many environmental
considerations, for example consuming adequate dietary protein
(Morton et al., 2017), that modulate RET-induced muscle
hypertrophy.
CONCLUSION
We performed backward elimination and principal component
regression on a relatively large cohort (n = 49) of resistance-
trained men and conclude that the post-exercise AUC (i.e.,
acute transient net hormonal exposure) and resting hormone
concentrations measured in the blood do not share common
variance with RET-induced changes in muscle mass. That
is, systemic hormone concentrations are not related to, or
in any way predictive of, RET-induced changes in muscle
mass. Performing subset analysis on the highest- and lowest-
responders revealed that androgen receptor content, not
intramuscular androgen levels, does not change with RET
in trained participants but is significantly higher in HIR
than LOR to RET. This study, in conjunction with others
(Bamman et al., 2007; Petrella et al., 2008; Davidsen et al.,
2011; Eynon et al., 2013), provides evidence that the relative
increase in skeletal muscle mass following RET is underpinned
by local intramuscular factors and not systemic hormonal
concentrations.
