Background: The treatment of depression has been hampered by low efficacy of 
antidepressant medications and safety concerns with alternative modalities. Recent 
work demonstrated that multi-Watt transcranial near-infrared light therapy (NILT) can 
effectively treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). The current objective is to explore multi-Watt 
NILT efficacy in a proof-of-concept study as a treatment for depression.
Methods: Thirty-nine sequential patients treated for TBI between March 2013 and 
May 2017 provided depression self-assessment data and/or were administered the 
Hamilton depression rating scale. Each completed the Quick Inventory of Depression 
Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS) before and after treatment. Patients received multi-
Watt NILT using near-infrared lasers (810/980 nm at 8–15 W) applied to forehead and 
temporal regions bilaterally for 9–12 min to each area. Pre- and posttreatment scores 
were analyzed by paired t-tests.
results: All met QIDS criteria for mild to severe depression and 69% had prior antide-
pressant trials. For 36 of the 39 patients, after 16.82 ± 6.26 treatments, QIDS scores 
indicated a robust response (decrease of QIDS total score by ≥50%). For 32 of 39 
patients, posttreatment QIDS scores indicated a remission from depression (decrease of 
QIDS total score ≤5). Overall, the QIDS score fell from 14.10 ± 3.39 to 3.41 ± 3.30 SD 
(p = 6.29 × 10−19). With 12 or fewer treatments, QIDS score dropped from 14.83 ± 2.55 
to 4.17 ± 3.93. Patients receiving ≥13 treatments showed a change in QIDS score 
from 13.67 ± 3.64 to 3.11 ± 3.14. Those (N = 15) who received the entire treatment 
course within ≤8 weeks (5.33 ± 1.72 weeks) showed a change in QIDS score from 
13.86 ± 3.14 to 4.5 ± 3.94. Suicidal ideation resolved in all, but two patients. Patients 
remained in remission for up to 55 months after a single course of treatment.
conclusion: This is the first report of high-powered NILT showing efficacy for depression. 
Multi-Watt NILT showed far greater efficacy and persistent benefit compared to low-power 
(<1 Watt) infrared light treatments. Patients saw benefit often within four treatments and 
resolution of depressive symptoms occurred within 4 weeks for some. These data raise 
an intriguing possibility—that multi-Watt NILT may be a safe, effective, and rapid treat-
ment for depression comorbid with TBI and possibly primary major depression disorder. 
A double-blind, placebo controlled trial is warranted to verify these proof-of-concept data.

Depression is arguably the leading cause of disability and lost 
productivity worldwide with an estimated 350 million people 
suffering from depression globally and many going untreated. 
Treatment efforts have focused on psychotherapy and pharma-
cological interventions; however, growing evidence indicates that 
current antidepressant medications fall far short of adequately 
treating depression. Overall, only 35% of patients with major 
depression disorder (MDD) respond to the first serotonergic 
antidepressant (1, 2). Studies examining the sequential use 
of antidepressants for unresponsive MDD also have yielded 
disappointing results. For example, the STAR-D trials examined 
antidepressant response in patients unresponsive to a first trial 
of serotonergic antidepressant and achieved only a 13% response 
rate after a sequence of four different antidepressants with multi-
ple mechanisms of action (2, 3).
One limitation of the pharmaceutical treatment of depression 
has been the excessive focus on monoaminergic agents—those 
affecting serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Despite rela-
tively poor response rates (1, 2) and significant (2) to profound 
(4–6) side effects and risks, monoaminergic agents have been the 
mainstay of psychiatry, even in the face of growing evidence that 
the monoaminergic pathways have limited impact of depression, 
leading Nassir Ghaemi to state,
Psychiatry… use(s) hundreds of made-up labels for 
professional purposes, without really getting at the 
reality of what is wrong with the patient…We have a 
huge amount of neurobiology research now to conclude 
that the 20th century neurotransmitter theories of psy-
chopharmacology basically are false. (7)
More aggressive interventions, such as electroconvulsive 
therapy (8), TMS (9), vagal nerve stimulation (10), and deep 
brain stimulation (11) have shown promise, but represent an 
impractical and risk-laden solution for depression worldwide.
In 2016, one of the authors (TAH), along with colleagues 
from Massachusetts General, reviewed the current theories on 
the causes of depression in the context of the potential of a new 
treatment modality (12). Biological mechanisms which may 
contribute to depression include: oxidative stress, decreased 
metabolism, inflammation, and neurodegenerative processes. 
Evidence supports elevated oxidative stress in patients with 
depression, including elevated levels of superoxide dismutase, 
involved in removal of toxic oxidative radicals (13) and decreased 
levels of catalase, which protects cells from oxidative damage 
(14). Recent studies of levels of nucleotide triphosphates in 
patients with depression have shown decreased cellular energy 
availability (15) and a correlation was demonstrated between 
antidepressant treatment response and restoration of larger 
nucleotide triphosphate totals (15). Proinflammatory cytokines 
are elevated in those with depression (16) and the role of inflam-
matory pathways in altering neurotrophic support may underlie 
multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression (17). 
Depression is associated with a loss of neurons, reduced synapse 
numbers, and dearborization of dendrites in the hippocampus 
and frontal cortices (18–21). Patients with MDD often exhibit 
significant atrophy of the hippocampus (22, 23). These structural 
rearrangements can be partially reversed with monoaminergic 
antidepressants (20, 24) and some have proposed that hip-
pocampal neurogenesis is essential for antidepressant effects 
(25). Prolonged antidepressant benefits of certain antidepressant 
agents appear tied to synaptogenesis and synaptic potentiation 
resulting from upregulation of the neurotrophin, brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (26), increased expression of BDNF 
receptors (trkB), and activation of the mechanistic target of rapa-
mycin pathway (27). Notably, trkB receptor inhibition prevents 
prolonged antidepressant effects (28). These prolonged effects 
potentially may represent persistent neuroplastic and neurore-
generative actions of BDNF (26).
One non-invasive treatment in use for pain, inflammation, 
headache, stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is near-infra-
red (NIR) light, which has effects on oxidative stress, metabolism, 
inflammation, and neurotrophin levels (12, 29–32). While not 
fully understood, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic 
benefits of NIR light appear to depend upon the absorption of NIR 
photons in the wavelength range of 600–1,200 nm by cytochrome 
c oxidase in the mitochondria (30, 32, 33). This appears to initiate 
modulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of nuclear 
factor kappa B (a redox sensitive transcription factor) (34), 
which lead to the replication of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear 
early-response genes. In addition, NIR light in a fluence range 
of 0.9–36 J/cm2 induces decreased expression of proapoptotic 
genes, increased expression of antiapoptotic genes, and increased 
expression of neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor 
and BDNF (29, 30, 32). Subsequently, synaptogenesis, dendritic 
arborization, and neurogenesis are increased [for reviews see 
Chung et al. (30) and Henderson and Morries (35)].
The early studies of transcranial NIR light therapy (NILT) for 
TBI or depression has yielded some informative results. Naesser 
et al. (36) described two patients with TBI who were treated over 
4–60 months with low-power (0.5 W) NIR using 870 nm light-
emitting diodes (LEDs) at a surface fluence of 13.3 J/cm2. While 
these patients experienced cognitive improvement, the benefits 
were only transient and required continued daily treatments to 
maintain (36). A larger group of eleven subjects with TBI were 
studied more systematically with 20 min treatments 3 times/
week for 6 weeks using 870 and 633 nm wavelength NIR at a 
power of 0.5 W (37). Eight of these subjects also experienced 
depression, ranging from mild to severe. The scores on the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II indicated that three of the eight sub-
jects with depression showed some improvement in depression 
symptoms, shifting from severe to moderate depression in one 
case and from moderate to mild depression in two cases over 
the 8-week course of treatment (37). It is unclear whether these 
benefits were transient or persistent. Schiffer et al. (38) treated 
10 patients with treatment-resistant depression [mean Hamilton 
depression rating scale (HAM-D) total score 23.9 ± 8.8 SD] with 
a single application of low-power NIR. Using an 810 nm LED 
applied for 4 min to two sites on the forehead at a fluence of 
60 J/cm2, a significant reduction in HAM-D score was observed. 
This benefit was transient with return of symptoms after 4 weeks 
(38). Cassano et al. (39) have reported similar findings in four 
 3

adults diagnosed with MDD (mean HAM-D score 19.8 ± 4.35 
SD). Treatment consisted of applying low-power 808 nm NIR 
light to four sites on the forehead for 2 min at each site with a 
fluence of 84 J/cm2. Patients received a total of six treatments 
and HAM-D scores dropped to 13.0 ± 5.35. This benefit also 
appeared transient (39). In contrast, Morries et al. (32) treated 
ten patients with multi-Watt NILT (8–15 W) and found marked 
and persistent improvement in multiple symptoms associated 
with TBI, including reductions in sleep disturbance, depressive 
symptoms, and anxiety. They have reported functional neuro-
imaging changes in a separate patient with long-standing TBI 
who was treated with multi-Watt NILT (40). Taken together, 
this literature suggests that NIR-induced neuroplasticity may 
be beneficial for both TBI and depression (whether intrinsic or 
secondary to TBI).
While these prior studies suggest a role for NIR light as a 
therapeutic modality for depression, the transient nature of the 
benefit in some studies warrants clarification. The distinction 
appears to lie in the use of low power NIR light emitted by LED 
devices versus multi-Watt NIR light emitters. NIR light from LED 
devices is generally under 1 W in power at the source. Our prior 
laboratory studies have shown that NIR light from LED devices 
does not penetrate the thickness of human skin (35). In contrast, 
multi-Watt NIR energy does penetrate at least 3–4 cm into the 
mammalian brain (35) or cadaveric brain (41). Thus, it is likely 
that only more powerful multi-Watt NIR light is capable of pen-
etrating into the human brain (35, 41, 42), delivering appropriate 
fluence at depth in the brain, and sufficiently stimulating BDNF 
and other factors to produce a lasting antidepressant effect.
Our clinical work has focused on treating patients with TBI 
using multi-Watt NILT (32, 43). MDD is the most frequent 
psychiatric comorbidity after TBI with prevalence rates of 
14–77% (44). We and others have found that a large proportion 
of patients with mild-to-moderate TBI experience some of the 
symptoms of depression, including low mood, sleep disruption, 
suicidal ideation, and anhedonia. For example, Fann et al. (45, 
46) have reported a high prevalence of depressive symptoms 
within 1 year after a TBI. They examined 559 patients within 
1 year of a TBI using structured clinical interview and found a 
cumulative rate of 53% for MDD as determined by the Patient 
Health Questionnaire. By comparison, the 12-month prevalence 
rate of MDD in the general population is 6.7% (45). In our 
published sample of patients treated using NILT for TBI, 90% 
of the patients had depressive symptoms and 100% had anxiety 
symptoms. Depressive symptoms may be part of persistent post-
concussive symptomatology or may represent an Adjustment 
Disorder with Depressed Mood; however, both Fann et al. (45, 
46) and Mauri et al. (44) used standardized structured clinical 
interviews and standardized scales in their determination of 
criteria for MDD.
Herein, we describe a series of 39 patients treated for TBI, but 
who also manifested depressive symptoms and met criteria for 
moderate to severe depression by Diagnostic Statistical Manual, 
fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. All, but three, of the patients 
demonstrated considerable to complete improvement in their 
depressive symptoms as measured clinically and by multiple 
depression rating scales in response to multi-Watt NILT.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Sequential patients who were seen in our outpatient clinic 
between March 2013 and May 2017 for the treatment of TBI also 
completed depression questionnaires in an unblinded proof-
of-concept retrospective clinical study. The Quick Inventory of 
Depression Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS) (47, 48) was 
performed before and after a course of treatment. Scores were 
analyzed as paired t-tests (Microsoft Excel 2010) after testing 
for violation of normality assumption by boxplot comparison. A 
one-tailed t-test was used as there had been no clinical evidence 
for NILT worsening depression. An a priori power analysis was 
not performed, although the N to detect a 50% change in QIDS 
score (definition of treatment response) is less than 10 subjects. In 
addition, patients seen between August 2013 and May 2017 were 
separately evaluated by a Board-certified psychiatrist for DSM-IV 
criteria for MDD with at least moderate depression (HAM-D 
total score between 14 and 28). HAM-D was repeated after 
treatment as part of standard assessment. Data from the HAM-D 
were analyzed by the same methods as those from the QIDS. This 
study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of 
Denver University and all subjects gave written informed consent 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. IRB approval was 
obtained from Denver University for retrospective study.
Patients received multi-Watt NILT using NIR lasers with 
wavelengths of 810 and 980 nm and a power range of 8–15 W 
as previously described (32). Briefly, Class IV lasers, either the 
LT1000 (LiteCure, Newark, DE, USA), a 10 W adjustable NIR 
laser emitter with wavelengths of 810/980 nm capable of deliver-
ing continuous or pulsed NIR light, the Diowave 810 (Diowave, 
Riviera Beach, FL, USA), an adjustable NIR emitter up to 15 W 
with a wavelength of 810 nm capable of delivering continuous or 
pulsed NIR energy, or the Aspen Laser (Denver, CO, USA), an 
adjustable NIR emitter up to 15 W with wavelengths of 810 and 
980 nm capable of delivering continuous or pulsed NIR energy 
were utilized. The fluence delivered to the skin of patients ranged 
from 55 to 81 J/cm2. No other treatment modalities (medica-
tions, exercise regimen, supplements) were added, discontinued, 
or changed while receiving NILT. Infrared light was applied to 
the scalp overlying the forehead and temporal regions bilaterally. 
Application to each area lasted 9–12 min and the total time for 
each session was 30 min. The number of treatments was variable, 
depending upon individual patient improvement and ranged 
from 8 to 34 treatments. Temperature of the skin surface was 
monitored with a laser digital sensor. A continuous sweeping 
motion was utilized to minimize skin heating and cover a larger 
area. Symptoms were monitored clinically and with instruments 
described above.
resUlTs
A total of 39 patients were treated with NILT for TBI and 
provided depression scale responses before and after treatment 
(see Table 1). Twenty were female (51%) and the mean age was 
40.5 ± 16.9 years. Of the 39 patients, 27 had a prior diagnosis of 
depression by an outside clinician. 69% had taken antidepressant 
medication prior to evaluation for treatment and 74% were taking

antidepressants during the course of NILT treatment. Average 
duration of treatment with traditional antidepressants exceeded 
72 months and all 39 patients continued to have symptoms of 
depression. No patients started or stopped a medication during 
the course of treatment. Of the 39 patients, 9 had been deemed 
“treatment-resistant” by an outside clinician. Based on the power 
densities of 55–81 J/cm2 delivered to the skin of patients in our 
clinic, our laboratory data (25) indicate that at the depth of 3 cm 
into the human brain, we would be delivering 0.8–2.4 J/cm2. This 
is exactly within the range which has been shown to activate 
growth factors, other genes, and neuroregenerative processes 
within animal models (19, 20). Patients experienced significant 
improvement in their symptoms of TBI (TBI-related results for 
a portion of these patients have been reported elsewhere) (32).
For 36 patients (92%), there was a dramatic decrease in depres-
sion symptoms. Patients often described benefit after the first four 
treatments. The mean number of treatments was 16.8 ± 6.26. For 
some patients, only eight treatments were given. All patients 
had QIDS scores in the range of mild to severe depression at 
baseline (see Figure 1). Overall, the baseline QIDS score was 
14.10 ± 3.39, in the range of moderate depression. At endpoint, 
patients experienced a significant reduction of their depressive 
symptoms with a mean endpoint QIDS total score of 3.41 ± 3.30 
SD (p = 6.29 × 10−19, one-tailed t-test, repeated measures). 
Thirty-six patients (92%) responded to the treatment (decrease 
of QIDS total score ≥ 50% from baseline) and 32 patients (82%) 
remitted from depression (QIDS total score ≤ 5). Patients who 
received 12 or fewer treatments (N = 12) showed a change in 
QIDS score from 14.83 ± 2.55 to 4.16 ± 3.92 (p = 4.63 × 10−6, 
one-tailed t-test, repeated measures). Patients who received ≥13 
treatments (N = 27) similarly showed a change in QIDS score 
from 13.67 ± 3.64 to 3.11 ± 3.14 (p = 2.33 × 10−13, one-tailed 
t-test, repeated measures).
Of particular note, those who were treated in ≤8 weeks 
(N = 15) showed a robust response with a change in QIDS score 
from 13.87 ± 5.56 to 4.50 ± 3.94 (p = 5.56 × 10−6, one-tailed 
t-test, repeated measures). Indeed, six of the patients received the 
entire course of treatment (8–16 treatments, mean 10.63 ± 1.99) 
in ≤4 weeks. One patient categorized as a non-responder received 
the entire course of treatment in 4 weeks.
Suicidal ideation was present in 77% of the patients at baseline. 
Responses to QIDS question #12 (“Thoughts of death or suicide”) 
was 1.0 ± 0.79, with eight patients responding with a 2 (think-
ing of suicide “several times a week for several minutes”) or a 3 
(thinking of suicide or death “several times a day in depth”). After 
treatment, two patients (non-responders) continued to endorse 
suicidal ideation. The mean response for question #12 of the 
QIDS posttreatment was 0.05 ± 0.22.
Ninety-two percent of patients endorsed feeling sad at base-
line. The mean baseline response to QIDS question #5 pertaining 
to feelings of sadness was 1.87 ± 0.86. After treatment, the mean 
response to QIDS question #5 was 0.37 ± 0.63. Four patients 
did not achieve remission (QIDS scores ≥5) due to complaints 
of low energy, excessive sleep, or poor concentration, which can 
be residual symptoms of TBI. Three additional patients did not 
show treatment response. One patient who did not show treat-
ment response went on to receive ketamine infusion therapy and 
experienced improvement in depressive symptoms. A second 
non-responder was lost to follow-up. The third non-responding 
patient had received ten treatments with NILT and then went 
on to receive ketamine infusion therapy, but after two infusions 
discontinued that treatment modality. This patient remained 
depressed and went on to receive a poly-pharmacy regimen, but 
remained depressed.
The effects of multi-Watt NILT on depression did not appear 
to be transient. We have follow-up interviews with 31 responder 
patients at posttreatment intervals of 2, 6, 12, and (in five cases) 
55 months. One of the patients reported a return of depressive 
symptoms, although remaining free of TBI-related symptoms. 
At follow-up, none of the patients endorsed suicidal ideation 
when re-questioned using QIDS question #12. At follow-up, 
62% reported not feeling sad (1 on QIDS question #5). The 
remainder endorsed intermittent feelings of sadness (2 on QIDS 
question #5).
Hamilton Depression Scale data reflected similar findings. 
The mean HAM-D score at baseline was 21.48 + 5.24 which is in 
the severely depressed range. After treatment, the mean HAM-D 
score was 6.0 ± 5.12 (p = 6.45 × 10−13, one-tailed t-test, repeated 
measures).
Adverse events were few. Six patients (15%) described head-
ache after the initial one to three NILT treatments, but not with 
additional NILT treatments, thereafter. Eleven (28%) described 
feeling tired or fatigued after the initial one to three NILT treat-
ments, but this resolved with further NILT treatment. Localized 
skin warming was noted by all patients, but was described as 
“comfortable.” Skin temperature increased no more than 3°C with 
rapid cooling after removal of the NIR light.

showed a change in QIDS score from 14.83 ± 2.55 to 4.16 ± 3.92 (p = 4.63 × 10−6). Patients who received ≥13 treatments (N = 27) similarly showed a change in

score from 13.87 ± 5.56 to 4.50 ± 3.94 (p = 5.56 × 10−6).

patients, 36 experienced a treatment response. Overall, 92% 
responded to the multi-Watt NILT and 82% remitted from their 
depressive symptoms.
Patients did not experience discomfort or adverse reactions to 
the treatment. Localized skin warming was present, but benign. 
Headache and fatigue after the first few treatments were the only 
adverse events reported, but these side effects appeared to resolve 
with further treatment.
Time to response and time to remission were notable. Patients 
saw benefit often within four treatments. In two cases (one with 
moderate depression and one with severe depression), resolution 
of depressive symptoms was achieved with only eight treatments. 
Patients who received ≤8 weeks of treatment (N = 15) showed 
no significant difference from the entire group. Notably, these 
patients had a drop in QIDS score indicative of remission 
(13.87 ± 3.14 to 4.50 ± 3.94) within 8 weeks. Six patients (15%) 
were treated over the course of ≤4 weeks. Five of the six patients 
achieved remission of depressive symptoms. The remaining 
patient was a non-responder. The time to response (with excep-
tions already noted) was often more rapid than that found for 
typical antidepressants, usually 6–8 weeks. The rapid response is 
not dissimilar to what has been described for ketamine infusion 
therapy (26, 49, 50). The rapidity of response will need to be 
clarified in future studies.
Our 82% treatment remission rate is superior to that described 
for oral antidepressants (1, 2) and to that described by Schiffer 
et al. (60%) in 10 patients (38) and Cassano et al. (50%) in 
four patients (39) using low power infrared light. In addition, 
our posttreatment interviews for up to 55 months posttreat-
ment show a large proportion of the patients remained free of 
depression symptoms. Therefore, these benefits do not appear 
to be transient, as was observed in studies of low-power NIR 
phototherapy (38, 39).
The magnitude, rapidity, and persistence of the response to 
the antidepressant effects of the multi-Watt (10–13 W) NILT 
may be explained by the superior penetration of multi-Watt 
NILT (25) compared to LED-based low-power (0.5 W) used 
in prior studies (38, 39). Our recent tissue studies demonstrate 
no penetration of low-level (0.5–6.0 W) NIR energy through 
3 cm of skin, skull and brain (35). However, at 10–15 W, 0.45 
to 2.9% of 810 nm light penetrated 3 cm of tissue. A 15 W 
810 nm NIR device (continuous or non-pulsed) delivered 2.9% 
of the surface power density to 3 cm of depth. Pulsing at 10 Hz 
reduced the dose of light delivered to the surface by 50%, but 
2.4% of the surface energy reached the depth of 3 cm (35). 
Based on the power densities of 55–81 J/cm2 delivered to the 
skin of patients in our clinic, our laboratory data indicate that at 
the depth of 3 cm into the human brain, we would be delivering 
0.8–2.4 J/cm2. This range corresponds with fluence shown to 
activate growth factors, such as BDNF, and neuroregenerative 
processes in animal models (29, 30). These laboratory data sup-
port that not only is low-level NIR energy unlikely to penetrate 
significantly into the human brain, but that multi-Watt NILT, 
as used in the present study, is capable of delivering effective 
doses of NIR energy to at least 3 cm into the brain through skin, 
skull, and dura.
There are certain limitations to this study. It is an open-label 
series of patients receiving treatment as usual in our clinic. All of 
the patients were being treated for TBI with secondary depres-
sion, so it is unclear whether multi-Watt NILT would work

equally well in patients with primary MDD without comorbidity. 
The symptoms responsive in this patient series might be equally 
well-explained as an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood 
related to troublesome symptoms of TBI. Alternatively, the symp-
toms of depression may be too entangled in the postconcussive 
syndrome to be considered as a separate phenomenon from the 
overarching TBI-related syndrome. Lastly, it is an open-label 
study susceptible to placebo effect.
These open-label single-arm data raise the possibility that 
NILT may be a safe, effective, and rapid treatment for depression 
comorbid to TBI. Indeed, some of our patients responded within 
4 weeks which is much more rapid than the response typical of 
standard oral antidepressants. Given the positive, but transient, 
antidepressant effects of low power infrared light (38, 39), these 
data suggest that multi-Watt NILT also may yield clinical benefit 
in primary major depressive disorder. At a time when Medicine 
is faced with a growing disappointment in traditional antidepres-
sants (6, 7, 45) and alternative treatments such as TMS (8, 9), 
vagal nerve stimulation (10), and deep brain stimulation (51), 
which are expensive and difficult to obtain in the current insur-
ance climate, offer only a marginal improvement in response rate. 
For example, TMS has a response rate of 48.7% and a remission 
rate of 33.6% in a recent meta-analysis (8). Deep brain stimula-
tion, after the initial excitement, has demonstrated a response 
rate of 39.9% and a remission rate of 26.3% (51). Ketamine 
infusion therapy (26, 49, 50, 52) has shown early promise, but 
also considerable concerns and limitations. As an alternative, 
NILT appears to be a potentially safe and viable solution. These 
data are only a prelude. The patients were primarily in treatment 
for TBI; hence, the depressive symptoms may have reflected the 
impact of brain injury. A double-blind, placebo controlled trial 
is warranted to verify these preliminary data. Nevertheless, we 
have followed our responders (N = 36) for 31–55 months and 
they have remained depression-free. Given the depression relapse 
rate of 45% in untreated patients (1, 2, 4–6), this is an additional 
unique feature of multi-Watt NILT as a potential treatment 
modality for depression.
