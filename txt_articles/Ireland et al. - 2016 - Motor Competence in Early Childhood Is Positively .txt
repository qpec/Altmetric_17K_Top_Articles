ABSTRACT
The onset of walking in early childhood results in exposure of the lower limb to substantial forces from weight bearing activity that
ultimately contribute to adult bone strength. Relationships between gross motor score (GMS), at 18 months and bone outcomes
measured at age 17 years were examined in2327 participantsintheAvon LongitudinalStudyofParents and Children (ALSPAC). Higher
GMS indicated greater motor competence in weight-bearing activities. Total hip bone mineral density (BMD) and hip cross-sectional
moment of inertia (CSMI) were assessed from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Bone measures including cortical bone
mineral content (BMC), periosteal circumference (PC), cortical thickness (CT), cortical bone area (CBA), cortical BMD (BMDC) and
cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) were assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at 50% distal-
proximal length. Before adjustment, GMS was associated with hip BMD, CSMI, and tibia BMC, PC, CT, CBA and CSMI (all p < 0.001) but
not BMDC (p > 0.25). Strongest associations (standardized regression coefficients with 95% CI) were between GMS and hip BMD (0.086;
95% CI, 0.067 to 0.105) and tibia BMC (0.105; 95% CI, 0.089 to 0.121). With the exception of hip BMD, larger regression coefficients were
observed in males (gender interactions all p < 0.05). Adjustment for lean mass resulted in substantial attenuation of regression
coefficients, suggesting associations between impaired motor competence and subsequent bone development are partly mediated
by alterations in body composition. In conclusion, impaired motor competence in childhood is associated with lower adolescent bone
strength, and may represent a risk factor for subsequent osteoporosis. © 2015 The Authors. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research

one is strongly influenced by the habitual strains to which it
is exposed. Due to the short levers muscles work with,
muscular forces are the greatest stressors of bone.(1) Locomotion
results in the largest muscle forces regularly experienced by the
body, estimated at three times body weight even during
walking.(2) The attainment of independent walking at around
12 months of age represents the first postnatal exposure of the
lower limb bones to these large forces. Accordingly, an increase
in bone strength has been observed at �15 months of age (ie,
shortly after typical walking onset age) that could not be
explained by changes in body size.(3) Recent work has shown a
strong relationship between time since onset of walking and
bone strength at 15 months, independent of body size or
perinatal factors such as birth weight or gestational age.(4)
Children who had been walking for �5 months had over 50%
greater bone mass and 100% greater torsional bone stiffness at
15 months than children who had yet to walk, despite no
association between walking onset age and bone strength at
birth. It is plausible, therefore, that early-life mobility and
resultant bone loading may contribute directly to bone strength
in childhood and adolescence, thereby representing a risk factor
for subsequent osteoporosis.
Motor competence is the ability to carry out motor tasks, and is
commonly measured using standardized questionnaires(5) or
clinic-based assessments.(6,7) Low bone strength has been
observed in adolescents with motor difficulties,(8) and children,
adolescents, and adults with low motor competence.(9) However,
few studies have prospectively collected data on early-life motor
competence and how it influences bone strength in later life. In
particular, effects of competence in locomotor skills such as
walking and jumping are likely to stress the lower limb bones.
Growth velocity in early childhood is greater than at any other

 time of life,(3) including the pubertal growth spurt. This period
maytherefore representan important time for bone mass accrual.
Motor competence may also influence bone strength via changes
in physical activity (PA) and/or body composition. Poor motor
competence in childhood is associated with reduced PA levels
in adolescence,(10) which is known to affect bone strength.(11,12)
Low motor competence is also associated with greater trunk
adiposity.(9) However, although muscle and bone size are closely
related to, even independent of, allometric scaling,(13) associa-
tions between motor competence and muscle size/lean mass
(LM) remain unexplored.
In the present study, we examined relationships between
early-life motor competence, and skeletal development in late
adolescence, in a large population-based birth cohort. We
hypothesized that greater motor competence in early childhood
would be positively associated with bone strength as assessed in
later life. In further analyses we aimed to examine to what extent
observed relationships could be explained by altered body
composition, levels of PA, or motor competence in later
childhood.
Subjects and Methods
Cohort description
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
is a geographically-based birth cohort study investigating
influences on health and development of children and young
people. Pregnant women resident in the former Avon Health
Authority in South West England, having an estimated date of
delivery between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, were
invited to take part, resulting in a cohort of 14,541 pregnancies
and 13,988 children alive at 12 months.(14) Ethical approval was
obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics committee and
relevant local ethics committees. Data in ALSPAC are collected
via several methods: self-completion postal questionnaires sent
to parents, linkage to computerized records, abstraction from
medical records, and from examination of the children at
research clinics. The study website (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/
alspac/researchers/access) contains details of all the data that
are available through a fully searchable data dictionary.
Exposure variable: Motor competence
An estimate of motor competence in early childhood was
obtained at around 18 months of age using a scale developed by
ALSPAC including elements derived from the Denver Develop-
mental Screening Test.(5) Mothers were asked to complete a
series of questions as to whether their child regularly,
occasionally, or had never completed movements such as
walking, climbing, and jumping. These answers were used to
calculate a continuous Gross Motor Score (GMS). Age at time of
questionnaire completion was also recorded.
Outcome measures: DXA and peripheral quantitative
computed tomography
Participants attending the 17 year research clinic underwent a
total body DXA scan using a GE Lunar Prodigy (Madison, WI, USA)
in standard scanning mode. Data were analyzed using in-built GE
LunarenCoresoftware(version12),fromwhichtotal bodyLMand
fat mass (FM) were obtained. Total hip bone mineral density
(BMD) was obtained from a hip scan. In addition, hip cross-
sectional moment ofinertia(CSMI) atthesite ofminimumfemoral
neck width was calculated using the manufacturer’s automated
advanced hip analysis (AHA) software. DXA measures of BMD are
influenced by body size during growth. To ensure that observed
effects were not simply an artifact of growth, total hip BMC
adjusted for total hip bone area was also examined.(15) Similar
results were obtained for hip BMD and size-adjusted BMC;
therefore,onlyBMDvaluesarereported.A peripheralquantitative
computed tomography (pQCT) scan at the 50% tibial site was also
taken using an XCT 2000 scanner (Stratec, Pforzheim, Germany).
Measurements were analyzed and results exported using the
Automated Analysis Tools in Version 6.00B of the software
supplied with the machine. Analysis of tibial cortical bone was
completed using a threshold of 650mg/mm3, which accurately
assesses bone geometry.(16) Cortical BMC, cortical bone area,
and cortical BMD were measured. In addition, periosteal and
endocortical circumferences, cortical thickness, and CSMI derived
from a circular ring model were recorded.(17) Muscle area was also
measured from pQCT images as described.(18) Briefly, images
were filtered using the in-built F03F05F05 filter, before a
threshold of 30 mg/mm was used to remove fat from the image
and calculated total bone area was subtracted. Precision of bone
outcomes was assessed from repeated scans using the coefficient
of variation (CV). Due to differing rates of compliance the number
of individuals with repeated measurements varies between
measurement modalities. CV for total hip BMD was 1.2% and hip
CSMI 7.5% based on 153 repeat scans. For pQCT outcomes, CVs
based on 126 repeat scans were as follows: cortical BMD ¼ 1.1%,
cortical BMC ¼ 2.6%, periosteal circumference ¼ 1.5%, endo-
cortical circumference ¼ 3.4%, cortical thickness ¼ 2.1%, and
CSMI ¼ 5.8%.
Other measures
Perinatal variables (birth weight and gestation, length at
delivery) were obtained from hospital records, and maternal
social class was recorded from a questionnaire completed at
32 weeks gestation. Between 7 and 8 years, children’s motor
skills were assessed using the ALSPAC Coordination Test (ACT)
during an ALSPAC clinic visit, which were used to provide a
measure of motor competence in later childhood. The ACT
consists of a subset of tests from the Movement Assessment
Battery for Children (MABC).(6) These tests examined balance
(heel-to-toe walking), ball skills (throwing bean bag into box),
and manual dexterity (placing pegs), representing the three
domains of coordination identified by principal component
analysis of MABC standardization data.(7) Age at time of testing
was recorded. At the age 17 years research clinic, as well as bone
measures described in the previous section, mass and height
were recorded from which BMI was calculated, and participants
who agreed participated in an accelerometer substudy.(19)
Puberty was assessed by self-completion questionnaires using
diagrams based on Tanner staging of pubic hair distribution for
both genders. A uniaxial Newtest accelerometer was worn
for 7 consecutive days, only removing it when it might get wet
or when playing contact sports. They were also asked to record
a diary when the monitor was worn. A valid recording was
defined as a minimum of 8 hours of recording on 2 separate
days, and length of measurement period was recorded. A
previous calibration study identified a threshold of 3g as
representing the transition from moderate impact activities such
as brisk walking to high impact activities such as jogging or
jumping.(19) Therefore, the number of counts over 3g was
calculated using custom-designed code in Stata 11.2 (StataCorp,
1090
IRELAND ET AL.
Journal of Bone and Mineral Research
 College Station, TX, USA). Counts were initially stratified into 33
predefined g-bands, and then separated by the designated
threshold. The number of counts was then adjusted for the
length of the measurement period for each individual.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were completed using the R statistical
environment(version3.1.2;https://www.r-project.org/).Children
between the 5th and 15th centile of standardized coordination
tests are considered to be “at risk” of impairment, whereas a
result below the 5th centile is defined as definite motor
impairment.(10) To allow consideration of movement score as a
categorical variable, 5th and 15th centile scores for GMS were
established for the whole cohort, and applied to partition the
subgroups for whom complete cases (including all perinatal,
early childhood, and adolescent measures) were obtained.
Multiple linear regression was used to examine GMS group
differences in bone measures, while adjusting for potential
confounders (gender, age at exposure and outcome, and
maternal social class). In addition to this analysis, relationships
between GMS as a continuous variable and bone outcomes were
examined. GMS results were not normally distributed, and this
could not be rectified by log or root transformation. However,
model residuals were homoskedastic showing normality of error
terms. In Model 1, relationships between movement scores and
bone outcomes were minimally adjusted for height or tibia
length for DXA and pQCT outcomes, respectively, due to the
strong association between body size and bone strength. In
Model 2, data were further adjusted for maternal social class,
gender, and age at exposure and outcome. For Model 3, early-life
factors (gestational age and birth weight) were added to
Model 2 as possible further confounders. Models 4 and 5 were
also adjusted for adolescent LM and then FM, respectively, which
could act as possible mediators. Finally, in Model 6 associations
between GMS and bone outcomes were further adjusted for ACT
score to assess whether they were mediated by persisting
advantages in motor competence in later childhood. In
Models 2 through 6, gender�movement score interactions
were also examined. Relationships are reported as standardized
(beta) regression coefficients indicating standard deviation (SD)
increase in bone outcome per SD increase in movement score,
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Missing data was assumed to
be missing at random, and only complete cases were analyzed.
Modeling assumptions were checked by inspecting residual
plots.
Results
Participant characteristics
The present analysis is based on 2327 ALSPAC offspring with
complete measures, including perinatal data, a GMS score at
18 months, ACT results at age 7 years, and pQCT and DXA
measures at age 17.8 years (Fig. 1). Participant characteristics
(birth weight, gestation length, and maternal social class) in the
present analysis were similar to those for whom complete
perinatal data was obtained (n ¼ 9973), although there was a
greater proportion of males (54%) in the larger cohort than in
the present analysis (44%). Males classified as at risk of having
impaired motor skills according to GMS had lower body mass at
17 years than healthy children, whereas other characteristics,
including birth weight, gestational age, and height at 17 years,
were equivalent (Table 1). Females classified as having impaired
motor skills had lower gestational age and BMI at 17 years than
healthy children.
DXA and pQCT outcomes at 17 years old by GMS
category
We compared bone measures at 17 years between healthy, at risk,
and impaired groups based on the GMS at 18 months stratified by
gender. In unadjusted analyses, compared to controls, males with
impaired GMS had a lower hip BMD as measured by DXA, whereas
no difference was observed for the at risk group (Table 2).
Incontrast, maleimpaired and atriskgroups wereboth lower than
male controls for hip CSMI as measured by DXA, and cortical BMC,
cortical area, periosteal circumference, cortical thickness, and
cortical CSMI as measured by pQCT. Total body LM and muscle
CSA were also lower in at risk and impaired groups compared to
controls, whereas no differences were seen for total body FM
(Table 2). In females, the impaired group had lower hip BMD than
controls. Impaired females had lower cortical BMC, cortical CSA,
periosteal circumference, cortical thickness and cortical CSMI than

 both healthy and at risk groups. Muscle CSA was also lower in the
impaired group compared to the at risk group and controls,
whereas no differences were seen for total body FM or LM. In
analyses adjusted for age, gender, height, and maternal social
class, negative trends were observed in hip BMD, and in pQCT
parameters including periosteal circumference and cortical
thickness, on moving from healthy, to at risk, to impaired
individuals. Figure 2 shows results of these analyses for hip BMD
and cortical BMD, stratified by gender and with data from both
genders combined. There was evidence of a movement score by
gender interaction (ie, p < 0.05) for hip CSMI, and tibia cortical
BMC,corticalCSA,periostealcircumference,corticalthickness,and
CSMI with greater effects of movement score in males in all cases.
DXA and pQCT outcomes at 17 years old by GMS as a
continuous variable
To examine the role of further confounders, regression analyses
were performed between GMS score as a continuous variable
and bone outcomes using a range of models. In Models 1 and 2,
equivalent positive relationships were observed between GMS
score and hip BMD, hip CSMI, cortical BMC, cortical area,

 periosteal circumference, cortical thickness, and cortical CSMI to
those described above according to GMS classification (Table 3).
There was little attenuation after adjustment for gestational age
or birth weight, which could also act as possible confounders
(Model 3). Subsequently, we explored the role of altered body
composition as a possible mediator, by additionally adjusting for
LM and FM at age 17 (Models 4 and 5). Associations with hip DXA
and pQCT bone outcomes were substantially attenuated by
adjustment for LM, as judged by decreases in regression
coefficients (Table 4). Nevertheless, with the exception of hip
BMD, there was still strong evidence for an association between
GMS score and bone parameters. Further adjustment for FM
resulted in only minor reductions in coefficients, despite
significant relationships between FM and a number of bone
outcomes. This was also true when associations were adjusted
for FM prior to LM in an alternative Model 4 (results not shown),
suggesting that FM did not substantially mediate relationships
between GMS and bone outcomes. Model 6 was adjusted for
ACT score to study whether GMS and ACT were related to bone
outcomes via a common pathway. Although GMS score was
associated with ACT score (–0.106; 95% CI, 0.085 to 0.127;
p < 0.001), adjustment for ACT resulted in only minor attenua-
tion of regression coefficients for associations between GMS and
bone outcomes.
All models showed evidence of a gender interaction for all
parameters apart from hip BMD. This consisted of a stronger
association in males compared to females (Tables 3 and 4). For
example, in Model 6, male coefficient for periosteal circumfer-
ence (beta coefficient 0.079; 95% CI, 0.036 to 0123) was much
larger than the respective female coefficient (0.043; 95% CI,
0.003 to 0.083). An exception was cortical BMD, which showed
negative and positive associations in males and females,
respectively (in Model 6, males: –0.054 [95% CI, –0.112 to
–0.004]; females: 0.086 [95% CI, 0.023 to 0.15]).
When grouped by ACT centile at 7 years, DXA and pQCT
variables tended to be greater in healthy than at risk and
impaired individuals (data not shown). Regression analyses
between ACT score (as a continuous variable) and bone
outcomes revealed similar associations to those seen for GMS
score, with the exception that beta coefficients were negative
reflecting the fact that individuals with impaired coordination
had higher scores (Supporting Tables 1 and 2). Only adjustment
for LM in Model 4 resulted in substantial attenuation of
associations between ACT and bone outcomes, and all models
showed evidence of a gender interaction, consisting of a
stronger association in males compared to females for all
parameters; apart from cortical BMD, which showed null
associations throughout.

EARLY LIFE MOTOR COMPETENCE ASSOCIATED WITH ADOLESCENT BONE STRENGTH
1095
 Exploration of further models: accelerometry subcohort
Finally, we examined whether PA plays a role in mediating the
association between motor and skeletal development, by
further analyzing models adjusted for PA levels, based on the
subset of 350 participants with matching accelerometry data
obtained at the time of the age 17 years bone assessments.
Number of impacts >3g per minute of accelerometer use,
representing higher levels of impact to which the skeleton
preferentially responds, were used as our primary PA measure.
There was no gender�GMS interaction on PA (p ¼ 0.31);
therefore, data from both genders were pooled. GMS at
18 months was positively associated with PA at age 17 years
(0.145; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.198; p ¼ 0.007) (model 1). PA at 17 years
old was also associated with hip BMD at 17 years old in
this subset (0.133; 95% CI, 0.083 to 0.184; p ¼ 0.008). GMS was
associated with hip BMD (0.122; 95% CI, 0.072 to 0.172;
p ¼ 0.015) as in the main dataset (results shown for Model 2).
The latter association was substantially attenuated by further
adjustment for body composition (ie, Model 5) as in the main
dataset (0.052; 95% CI, 0.006 to 0.097; p ¼ 0.259), but only weakly
attenuated by adjustment for PA (0.105; 95% CI, 0.055 to 0.155;
p ¼ 0.037).
Discussion
Having investigated associations between motor competence
in early childhood and bone strength in adolescence, greater
motor competence at 18 months was found to be associated
with higher hip BMD and predicted bone strength at 17 years,
particularly in males. These associations were partially, but
not completely, attenuated by adjustment for body composi-
tion (particularly LM). In contrast, the association between
motor competence and hip BMD was only marginally
attenuated by adjusting for PA. Hence, differences in body
composition, as opposed to PA, appear to partly mediate the
observed relationships between motor skills and bone
development.
That early-life motor competence was positively associated
with bone strength in adolescence extends previous work,(4) in
which bone strength advantages in early-walking children was
attributed to greater habitual loading of the lower limbs.
Habitual loading is a primary determinant of bone strength, with
prolonged disuse(20,21) and exercise/PA(4,22) resulting in up to
50% loss and gain of tibial bone mass, respectively. Greater
diaphyseal BMC was observed at the mid-tibia, which appeared
to result from greater periosteal circumference (and hence
cortical area and moment of inertia), rather than differences in
BMD.
A
similar
pattern
has
been
observed
in
regular
exercise,(22–24) high levels of vigorous PA,(11,12,25) and in early
locomotion,(4) supporting a role of altered loading in effects of
motor competence on bone.
PA assessed by accelerometry is an indicator of habitual
loading of the bones and is positively associated with bone
strength,(11,12,25–27) particularly in males.(27) The greatest loads
experienced by bone result from internal muscle forces(1);
accordingly, strong relationships also exist between muscle size
(as an indicator of muscle strength) and bone strength(13,28)
even when adjusted for body size. In boys, childhood motor
competence is positively associated with PA in later child-
hood(10) and body composition.(9) This suggests that early-life
motor competence may influence adolescent bone strength
through effects on PA and body composition. We explored these
relationships further by adjustment of regression models for
LM/muscle CSA, FM, and—in a subcohort—PA assessed by
accelerometry. GMS was positively associated with LM as
measured by DXA, particularly in males, although no association
was seen with FM. Adjustment for LM or muscle size resulted in
substantial attenuation of relationships between early-life motor
competence and bone strength, whereas adjustment for FM did
not substantially influence these associations. Further adjust-
ment for PA resulted in only weak attenuation of beta
coefficients, suggesting that PA assessed by accelerometry
does not play a primary role in mediating this relationship. One
caveat is that PA is strongly related to body composition, which
is in turn an important determinant of bone strength, with
positive effects of both LM(13) and FM(29) observed in children.
Therefore, it may be that muscle size is acting as an indicator of
physical
activity.
Given
these
complex
interrelationships
between early motor development, LM, PA, and bone outcomes,
caution is needed when proposing causal pathways, particularly
given the limited number of participants in whom information
on all these variables was available. Associations between
movement score and bone outcomes could also be mediated by
effects on growth and development. However, this seems
unlikely because in addition analyses in 1655 participants
(700 males) for whom details of pubertal development at
13.5 years were available there was no effect of GMS or GMS by
gender interaction.
Effects of early-life motor competence on bone strength in
adolescence were generally more pronounced in males than
females. These findings are consistent with a previous report
in ALSPAC that effects of early-life motor competence on PA
in later childhood appear limited to males.(10) Similarly, the
relationship between early-life motor competence and LM in
adolescents, which partly mediates the relationship with bone
strength, was considerably stronger in males compared to
females (results not shown). Taken together, these results
suggest that motor competence has a greater influence on
habitual loading in males. Resultant effects on bone may be
compounded by the fact that the skeleton of adolescent males
appears more responsive to high impact activity(27) and long-
term exercise(22,23) compared to females. However, skeletal
growth and maturation is slower in boys compared to girls,(30)
and cortical BMD at age 17 years is lower in males compared to
females consistent with the fact that males are yet to complete
cortical consolidation.(27) Therefore, gender differences in
effects of motor competence on bone strength could theoreti-
cally represent effects on the rate of maturation, rather than final
bone mass achieved. Repeat DXA measures are currently being
obtained in this cohort at age 24 years, and examination of
whether associations with GMS score persist into adulthood
should be possible to address this possibility.
Although relationships between motor competence and
bone were observed for both motor skill scores examined,
associations were generally stronger for GMS at 18 months than
ACT score at 7 years. This is likely to reflect the fact that GMS at
18 months is related to locomotory tasks likely to stress the
lower limb bones, whereas ACT score at 7 years also measures
upper limb and fine motor tasks. Furthermore, adjustment for
ACT score did not substantially attenuate relationships between
GMS and bone outcomes, suggesting the two scores represent
different aspects in terms of how motor competence influences
bone development.
Bone mass accrual rates slow in mid-late teens and bone
mass typically peaks in the third decade(31,32) and has a sizeable

 effect on fracture risk in later life.(33) Therefore, attainment of
high bone strength by the end of adolescence is important for
the prevention of fractures later in life.(34) Growth velocity and
periosteal apposition in infancy is even greater than that during
adolescence.(3,35) Recent evidence has shown that greater
periosteal circumference in early life is maintained for several
decades,(36) but that the ability to increase bone strength via
exercise following skeletal maturity is greatly diminished—
particularly at epiphyseal sites.(23) Hence, this early-life growth
spurt could also represent an important period in the acquisition
of bone mass, and a period when exercise effects on bone have
pronounced long-term effects. This is supported by studies
showing strong effects of early-life PA on bone, whereby a 1.0 SD
difference in age of independent walking was associated with a
0.5 SD difference in bone mass and torsional strength.(4) Similar
large effect sizes were observed between the different motor
competence groups in this study. Motor competence below the
5th centile at 18 months was associated with a 0.45 SD lower
total hip BMD in males, and 0.25 SD in females compared to the
cohort mean. Fracture risk approximately doubles for each 1.0
SD decrease in BMD; therefore, males and females below the 5th
centile could be assumed to have a 35% to 40% and �20%
greater fracture risk, respectively. However, the amount of
variation in bone strength explained by variation in GMS in
Model 6, as reflected by beta coefficients, was relatively small.
This suggests that other factors such as associated differences in
LM explains most of the differences in bone strength according
to GMS score.
One limitation of our study is missing data for exposures
and outcomes, which may have underestimated the strength
of the associations shown. The participants included in this
study are only a selected subgroup of the whole cohort;
therefore, the extent to which these findings can be extended
to the wider population may be limited. The ALSPAC cohort is
a longitudinal observational study, and hence causality cannot
be attributed for observed associations. In addition, there
remains the risk of residual confounding, that factors not
included in the analysis influence exposures and outcomes. A
further limitation is that birth weight and gestational age were
obtained from hospital records rather than according to a
standard protocol during study visits. In addition, pQCT is
subject to partial volume effects, which can affect cortical BMD
measurements. However, in further analyses where a correc-
tive algorithm(17) was applied, results were unchanged. A
further limitation is that we were unable to examine how
motor competence affects trabecular bone because scans
were only performed at the mid-tibia.
In conclusion, we found that impaired motor competence in
early life was associated with reduced bone strength in
adolescence. Whereas pediatric conditions resulting in delayed
motor development are known to be associated with impaired
bone development, our results suggest a similar relationship
may exist in the wider population. Further studies are justified to
examine whether early-life motor competence represents an
independent risk factor for osteoporosis, by investigating
whether an equivalent relationship exists with bone outcomes
in later life.
