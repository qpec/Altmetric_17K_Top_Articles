A Prospective Study of the Impact of Current Poverty, History
of Poverty, and Exiting Poverty on Accumulation of Disease
Damage in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
Edward Yelin,1 Laura Trupin,2 and Jinoos Yazdany2
Objective. To estimate the effect of current pov-
erty, number of years in poverty, and exiting poverty on
disease damage accumulation in systemic lupus erythe-
matosus (SLE).
Methods. For this study, 783 patients with SLE
were followed up from 2003 to 2015 through annual
structured interviews. Respondents were categorized in
each year by whether they had a household income of
£125% of the US federal poverty level. Linear and
logistic regression analyses were used to assess the
impact of poverty in 2009, number of years in poverty
between 2003 and 2009, and permanent exits from pov-
erty as of 2009 on the extent of disease damage
(according to the Brief Index of Lupus Damage [BILD]
score) or accumulation of a clinically meaningful
increase in disease damage (defined as a minimum
2-point increase in the BILD damage score) by 2015.
Results. After adjustment for sociodemographic
features, health care characteristics, and health behav-
iors, poverty in 2009 was associated with an increased
level of accumulated disease damage in 2015 (mean dif-
ference in BILD damage score between poor and non-
poor 0.62 points, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
0.25–0.98) and increased odds of a clinically important
increase in damage (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% CI 0.98–
2.85). Being poor in every year between 2003 and 2009
was associated with greater damage (mean change in
BILD score 2.45, 95% CI 1.88–3.01) than being poor for
one-half or more of those years (mean change in BILD
score 1.45, 95% CI 0.97–1.93), for fewer than one-half of
those years (mean change in BILD score 1.49, 95% CI
1.10–1.88), or for none of those years (mean change in
BILD score 1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.49). Those exiting
poverty permanently had similar increases in disease
damage (mean change in BILD score 1.30, 95% CI 0.90–
1.69) as those who were never in poverty (mean change
in BILD score 1.36, 95% CI 1.23–1.50) but much less
damage than those who remained in poverty (mean
change in BILD score 1.98, 95% CI 1.59–2.38).
Conclusion. The
effects
of
current
poverty,
“dose” of poverty, and exiting poverty suggest that pov-
erty plays a critical role in the accumulation of damage
in patients with SLE.
Despite many years of research showing the effect
of poverty on disease outcomes and mortality in general
(1,2), and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or
other autoimmune conditions specifically (3–6), our
understanding of the reasons behind these effects is lim-
ited. It is not yet established whether it is poverty per se
or factors associated with poverty that account for its
effects. Such factors could include inadequate access
to health care and lower quality of care (7–9), harmful
health behaviors, residual effects of long-term poverty
on human capital (the combination of formal training,
skills, and experience) to deal with disease (10,11), or the
immediate effects of such phenomena as exposure to
adverse neighborhoods, stress, and economic deprivation
(12,13).
In the present report, we describe the results of a
longitudinal study of observational data from patients
with SLE evaluating the extent to which the relationship
between poverty and disease outcomes meets the crite-
ria for causal plausibility. We tested several hypotheses
as to why the poor experience dramatically poorer

 outcomes, including stress, economic deprivation, adverse
neighborhood circumstances, depression, and cognitive
impairment. We also evaluated the impact of poverty at
one time point, the impact of the number of years in pov-
erty, and the effect of permanently exiting poverty on the
extent of subsequent damage accumulation in patients
with SLE.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data source. The data source for the present study is
the Lupus Outcomes Study (LOS) (14). The LOS began in
2003 by enrolling individuals who had previously participated
in studies of genetic risk factors for lupus. Two-thirds of the
participants were recruited from such nonclinical sources as
public service announcements, patient support groups, and
word of mouth; the remainder were recruited from academic
and community clinical practices. To ensure that every individual
included in the LOS met the American College of Rheumatol-
ogy diagnostic criteria for lupus (15), the medical records of
each participant were reviewed by rheumatologists or nurses
working under a rheumatologist’s supervision. The sampling
outside of tertiary care centers permitted us to evaluate a wide
range of kinds and quality of care for SLE, including a range of
specialties assuming primary responsibility for the care of SLE
and the extent of health insurance coverage.
The principal data collection for the LOS was an
annual structured telephone interview lasting ;45 minutes.
The survey covered the following information: signs and symp-
toms of disease; validated measures of disease activity (16)
and accumulated damage (the Brief Index of Lupus Damage
[BILD] [17]); assessments of cognitive status and mood
(18,19); a complete enumeration of all health care encounters
for lupus, including specialty of the physicians evaluating the
condition and patients’ current medications as ascertained
using questionnaire formats adapted from the National Health
Interview Survey (20); measures of quality of SLE care (21);
assessment of the nature of the interactions between patients
and providers and health systems (22,23); health behaviors,
including height and weight and smoking history, as determined
using items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sys-
tem (24); a record of health insurance coverage based on items
from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (25); the extent of
stress as determined by the Perceived Stress Scale (26); the
extent of economic deprivation, such as food, housing, and
medical
care insecurity (27);
and
standard demographic
measures.
LOS participants reported on their household income
in each annual survey, which, when combined with data on
household size, enabled us to categorize each participant into
those whose household income was at or below 125% of the
US federal poverty level (the cutoff defining poverty in the
present study) versus those whose household income was
above 125% of the US federal poverty level. This definition
was chosen because it is the cutoff for eligibility for several
federal programs and because many of the LOS respondents
live in expensive areas of the country.
Contextual information about the area surrounding
the participants’ residential addresses was matched via geo-
coding to survey data from the American Community Survey
at various levels of geographic aggregation. Most of the con-
textual information was added at the level of the US Census
block group, encompassing between 600 and 3,000 individuals
in the immediate neighborhood. The data included the pro-
portion of neighbors in poverty, median income, median earn-
ings, rates of home ownership, and racial composition (28).
Information on income inequality from the Census data was at
the level of the county in which the LOS participants resided
(29). Because of its relationship to personal poverty, the prin-
cipal contextual measure was whether the neighborhood was
an area of concentrated poverty, which could exacerbate the
effect of personal poverty. For the study analyses (reported
below), areas of concentrated poverty were those in which at
least 30% of individuals met the federal poverty standard
defined above.
Study analyses. The goal of treatment in lupus is to
reduce the frequency and magnitude of flares in disease activ-
ity and to reduce the subsequent accrual of damage to organ
systems (30). Prior studies of lupus outcomes required peri-
odic access to specialists to assess activity and damage, both of
which precluded annual measurement and limited studies to
participants with some ongoing contact with research centers.
In contrast, in the present study, we developed and validated
measures of accumulated disease damage and quality of care
based on patient self-report and validated a previously devel-
oped measure of disease activity (16,21,31). All of these mea-
sures were available as of the 2009 interview. Accordingly, at
the time of the 2015 interviews, we assessed the impact of sets
of variables, i.e., those measured in 2009 or earlier that were
previously hypothesized to affect long-term outcomes in
patients with SLE, on change in the BILD damage score as of
2015. The principal independent variables included poverty
status in 2009 and poverty status since the inception of the
LOS through 2009; the latter permits the estimation of the
impact of episodic poverty contrasted against permanent pov-
erty, as well as the effect of permanently leaving poverty.
We began by developing a base model of outcomes
incorporating poverty status and sociodemographic features
(age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, and marital status), health
behaviors (smoking status and body mass index), and health
care characteristics (number of physician visits, managed care
versus fee-for-service sector, specialty mix of the providers
treating lupus, and whether the lupus care met a standard of
high quality, defined as a pass rate of $85% on the validated
set of quality indicators [services provided] for the care of
lupus patients [32]).
We then tested various mitigating circumstances that
might reduce or exacerbate the impact of poverty on out-
comes, including the persistence of poverty and residence in
an area of concentrated poverty, as well as other characteris-
tics of the community, as outlined above. We also assessed
whether the impact of income on outcomes continued
throughout the income distribution or, instead, was limited to
those in the lowest tiers of income. In additional analyses, we
focused on whether higher education levels, a proxy for human
capital, can offset the impact of poverty-level incomes;
whether intergenerational socioeconomic status, as measured
by parental education, worsened the effect of current poverty;
the extent to which current stress as measured by the Per-
ceived Stress Scale (26) accounted for the effect of poverty;
and whether exiting poverty had a beneficial impact on
POVERTY AND DISEASE DAMAGE IN SLE

 outcomes. Poverty may be associated with receipt of substan-
dard care, which could result in greater accumulation of SLE
damage. Accordingly, in sensitivity analyses, we also evaluated
the impact of 3 different regimens involving the use of predni-
sone: prednisone monotherapy, defined as a dosage of 7.5 mg/
day for at least 3 months in the prior year in the absence of
other immunosuppressive medications; prednisone use at a
dosage of at least 10 mg/day for at least 3 months in this same
time period; or prednisone use at a dosage of 20 mg/day for at
least 3 months in this same time period.
We then assessed the conjoint impact of the level of
perceived
stress,
social
support,
cognitive
function,
and
depressed mood on outcomes beyond the economic, demo-
graphic, and health characteristics outlined above. In addition,
we assessed whether tangible measures of economic depriva-
tion, such as food, housing, and medical care insecurity,
expected in the ensuing 2-month period after the annual inter-
view had effects beyond that of the generalized measure of
stress. On a community level, we also evaluated the incremen-
tal effect of the number of friends and family available to pro-
vide tangible social support (33) to mitigate the effects of
living in areas of concentrated poverty.
We used ordinary least squares regression to estimate
the impact of poverty and other characteristics on change in
the extent of accumulated damage between 2009 and 2015.
We also analyzed the impact of poverty on whether a mini-
mum clinically important difference (MCID) in damage had
occurred. In the BILD damage measure, the MCID was
defined as a clinically meaningful increase in the damage score
of $2 points based on the ability to predict an elevated risk of
subsequent mortality (34). Logistic regression was used to esti-
mate the impact of poverty and covariates on the probability
of a change in the BILD score for newly accumulated damage
at the level of at least the MCID as defined above.
In 2009, there were 849 respondents to the LOS survey
who had been interviewed continuously since 2003. Of these,
67 had died by 2015 (7.9%) and were excluded from the pres-
ent analysis. Of the remaining 782 patients, 643 (82.2%) were
interviewed continuously between 2009 and 2015, 36 (4.7%)
were lost to follow-up between 2009 and 2015, and 103
(13.2%) declined to continue in the study during this time
frame. Among the 643 who had been interviewed continuously
between 2009 and 2015, 97 (15.1%) had a missing value for 1
of the principal variables in the analysis.
To account for the impact of attrition due to loss to
follow-up, lack of participation, or item nonresponse, we used
multiple imputation with chained equations to model missing
values, based on 15 replications (35–37). We herein report the
results based on the use of multiple imputation, but in no
instance were the results substantially different in direction or
magnitude from those in the analyses among patients inter-
viewed continuously through 2015. As a sensitivity analysis, we
included those who were deceased by 2015 in analyses com-
pleted with multiple imputation. As expected, including the
deceased subjects strengthened the relationship between pov-
erty and accumulated damage, because those who subse-
quently died were more likely both to have been poor and,
prior to death, to have experienced a higher level of accumu-
lated damage. The results reported herein, however, are based
on the primary analyses, in which those who died as of 2015
were excluded.
In addition to the foregoing estimations, we evaluated
whether
there
were
statistically
significant
interactions
between poverty and select other characteristics, including liv-
ing in an area of concentrated poverty, cognitive impairment,
extent of symptoms of depression (as measured using the Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] [38]),
and level of perceived stress. Despite the fact that those in
poverty had more adverse levels of each of these variables, the
only variable for which the interaction with poverty status was
statistically significant, and thus the only one reported in the
main analysis, was living in an area of concentrated poverty.
Several of the mechanisms proposed—for example,
having symptoms of depression, cognitive impairment, high lev-
els of perceived stress, or low technical quality of care—could
be said to mediate the impact of poverty on the outcomes.
Accordingly, we formally tested whether the impact of poverty
on the outcomes was a direct effect or whether it operated
through the proposed mechanisms (39–41). In no instance did
the proposed mediating variables account for more than one-
quarter of the variance in outcomes associated with poverty,
even though the mediating variables were significantly related
to the outcomes, indicating that lack of statistical power did not
account for the small effect of the variables on the outcomes.
Finally, we assessed the impact of community characteristics
other than concentrated poverty, but none of these other char-
acteristics had a substantial effect on outcomes.
RESULTS
Among the LOS participants, the mean age was
49.8 years, the mean duration of lupus was 16.9 years,
94% were female, and 37% were members of racial/
ethnic minority groups (Table 1). In total, ;15% of the
783 participants met the study definition of poverty.
Among the LOS participants, ;8% lived in areas
of concentrated poverty and ;8% reported having
extreme difficulty living on their incomes.
Those LOS participants in poverty, compared to
the remaining participants who did not meet the study
definition of poverty (designated non-poor), reported
higher disease activity levels, higher levels of accumu-
lated damage, higher CES-D scores (worse depression),
and higher levels of cognitive impairment (as measured
using the z score on the Hopkins Delayed Recall Test
[42]). LOS participants in poverty were much more
likely to report high levels of perceived stress and
slightly smaller social networks (Table 1).
The results for BILD scores of accumulated
damage between 2009 and 2015 by poverty status,
in models with or without adjustment for demographic
characteristics, disease duration, health care characteris-
tics, and health behaviors, are shown in Table 2. From
2009 to 2015, the mean change in the BILD disease
damage score was substantial, at 1.43, representing an
;75% increment over the 2009 mean score of 1.9.
Those SLE patients in poverty experienced substantially

* Disease activity was assessed on the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (potential score range 0–47, with higher scores indicating higher
disease activity). Disease damage was assessed using the Brief Index of Lupus Damage (potential score range 0–18, with higher scores indicating
higher levels of damage). The quality indicator pass rate was assessed as the proportion of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with eligible
services (defined quality indicators) received. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score was assessed with a
potential score range of 0–60 (with higher scores indicating greater depression). The Hopkins Delayed Recall Test z score was determined using
the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test—Revised. Areas of concentrated poverty were defined using US Census block groups with .30% of
households with an income of #125% of the federal poverty limit. The Perceived Stress Scale score was assessed with a potential score range of
0–16 (with higher scores indicating greater stress levels). The social network score was determined using the Berman Social Network scoring
system.

 greater accrual of disease damage between 2009 and
2015 than those who were not in poverty. The mean dif-
ference in change in the BILD damage score between
the poor and non-poor was 0.68 (95% confidence inter-
val [95% CI] 0.34–1.02) before adjustment, and was 0.62
(95% CI 0.25–0.98) after adjustment (Table 2).
We also compared the groups for the proportion
of patients who experienced a clinically meaningful
increase in the BILD damage score, defined as a 2-point
increment, or MCID, in the score. In both unadjusted
and adjusted models, those in poverty had a higher likeli-
hood of experiencing an MCID increase in the BILD
score (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.11–
2.67; adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.98–2.85) (Table 2).

tuated the effect of personal poverty on the extent of
accrued damage (Table 3). Personal-level poverty was

 area, but the poor living in areas of concentrated pov-
erty accrued far more damage than the poor not living
in such areas (after adjustment, mean change in BILD
score 2.71 points, 95% CI 1.93–3.49). In contrast, there
was no effect of the racial composition of the local com-
munity, the median level of household income and earn-
ings, and inequality of local income on damage accrual
(data not shown).
The data in Table 3 also show that the extent of
damage accrual was proportional to the “dose” of pov-
erty prior to 2009, with the persistence of poverty having
a significant effect on the extent of damage accrual.
Thus, in models with or without adjustment for demo-
graphic characteristics, disease duration, health care
characteristics, and health behaviors, those who were
never poor prior to 2009 experienced less damage
accrual than those who were episodically poor, the latter
of whom, in turn, experienced less damage accrual than
those who were always poor during the study period.

up to $40,000 per year had significantly higher levels of
damage accrual than those with higher incomes. Beyond
a household income of $40,000 per year, however, dam-
age accrual did not differ by level of income, suggesting
that there is a ceiling effect.
We also investigated several mechanisms that
could account for the impact of poverty on damage
accrual, starting with the education level of the LOS par-
ticipants and that of their parents. As shown in Table 4,
we found no difference in damage accrual between those
in poverty who had at least some college and those with a
high school education or lower, both of whom experi-
enced higher levels of damage accrual than those who
were not in poverty. We also observed no difference in
accrued damage between the poor whose parents had at
least some college versus those whose parents had a high
school education or lower, with both groups having higher
levels of damage accrual than those not in poverty.
In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, LOS
participants who were never in poverty during the study
time period, in whom the mean BILD score of newly
accumulated damage from 2009 to 2015 was 1.36 (95%
CI 1.23–1.50), had similar levels of damage accrual as
those who left poverty (mean change in BILD score

POVERTY AND DISEASE DAMAGE IN SLE

 1.30, 95% CI 0.90–1.69), in contrast to those who
remained in poverty, who had a mean score of accumu-
lated damage of 1.98 (95% CI 1.59–2.38). Those who
left poverty as recently as 1 year before the 2009 base-
line interview experienced a level of damage accrual
very similar to those who were never in poverty.
To evaluate the extent to which those who were
destined to leave poverty differed from those who
remained poor, we compared their baseline damage
scores. The 2 groups did not differ significantly or sub-
stantially in baseline damage scores, suggesting that any
selection bias in those who subsequently were to leave
poverty was minimal (data not shown).
In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated the differen-
tial impact of prednisone usage between the poor and
non-poor. The poor were significantly more likely than
the non-poor to receive prednisone at a dosage of at
least 7 mg/day for at least 3 months in the absence of
any other immunosuppressive agents in the prior year
(3.8% versus 1.5%; P , 0.01), to receive prednisone at a
dosage of 10 mg/day for at least 3 months in this period
(20.3% versus 6.9%; P , 0.01), and to receive predni-
sone at a dosage of 20 mg/day for at least 3 months in
this period (7.6% versus 2.4%; P , 0.01). Each of the
prednisone regimens was associated with a significantly
greater amount of accumulated damage. However, the
regimens did not have a significant or substantial impact
on the effect of poverty on accumulated damage (data
on the effect of the regimens not shown).
Potential mechanisms for the effect of poverty on
accumulated damage include the level of perceived stress,
extent of cognitive impairment, and presence of symp-
toms of depression. Each of these phenomena was signif-
icantly associated with accrued damage in unadjusted
and adjusted models that included poverty status (data
not shown). However, the combined effect of all of these
potential mechanisms reduced the impact of poverty on
damage by ;43%, from a mean change in BILD score of
0.68 to 0.39 (Figure 1), but still left a residual effect of
poverty. When the measure of personal economic depri-
vation was added, a self-report of having extreme diffi-
culty living on one’s income had little effect beyond the
more encompassing measure of stress levels (data not
shown). Although the higher prevalence of stress,
impaired cognition, and depressed mood contributed to
damage accrual among the poor, there was no interaction
of any of these variables with poverty; that is, the effect of
each of these did not differ by poverty status.
DISCUSSION
The present study of patients with SLE advances
the literature on poverty and outcomes in this disease in
several ways. We observed not only that poverty at any
one time period was related to the extent of subsequent
accumulation of damage, but also that the “dose” of pov-
erty, in terms of the proportion of years with a poverty-
level income, also affected the amount of damage accrual.
Furthermore, exiting poverty permanently was associated
with a disease course that closely resembled that experi-
enced by individuals who were not poor at any time dur-
ing the study period, as opposed to the disease course of
those who were episodically poor, an effect observed
within 1 year or 2 years of having first left poverty.
The LOS permitted us to test several hypotheses
from the literature about the mechanisms underlying the
relationship between poverty and outcomes. We first
developed a basic model incorporating demographic
characteristics, health status, health behaviors, number of
physician visits, and the characteristics of the health care
system. This model accounted for a small part of the
effect of poverty on accumulated damage. Stress, cogni-
tive impairment, and symptoms of depression accounted
for more of the effect. Nevertheless, even after taking all
of these factors into account, there remained a residual
effect of poverty. Taken together with the finding that
exiting poverty resulted in a lower level of accumulated
damage, the observation that the poor living in areas of
concentrated poverty had worse outcomes than the poor
living elsewhere suggests that poverty itself plays a large
role in why the poor experience worse outcomes of SLE.

age between 2009 and 2015 was examined in models with poverty
alone or with poverty in combination with demographic, health status,
health behavior, and health care characteristics, poverty in combina-
tion with all of these factors plus stress, or poverty in combination
with all of these factors plus cognitive impairment and symptoms of
depression. Bars show the mean with 95% confidence interval.

 In observational studies, the plausibility of an
association, even one in which the exposure precedes
the outcome, is increased when the outcome is propor-
tional to the “dose” of the exposure and when the with-
drawal of the exposure leads to improved outcomes.
In the present study, we were able to observe that the
number of years in poverty affects the magnitude of
accumulated damage. While we could not experimentally
remove the exposure of poverty, we were able to observe
that those who left poverty experienced less accumulated
damage than those who remained in poverty, and in fact,
the damage levels were similar to those in subjects who
were never in poverty, consistent with the view that
exiting poverty may improve outcomes in SLE.
Finally, the impact of income on the extent of accu-
mulated damage occurred only among those with house-
hold incomes below $40,000 per year, suggesting that it is
low income, rather than gradations in income beyond low
income levels, that affects damage accrual, a finding that is
at odds with that reported in population-wide studies of
the health impacts of income gradations (43).
However, even in an observational study with 12
years of follow-up, it is not possible to completely disen-
tangle the effect of poverty from the other characteristics
of the poor beyond their poverty. The fact that we did not
observe that those who exited poverty had substantially or
significantly lower levels of accumulated damage prior to
exiting poverty than those who remained in poverty sug-
gests that selection bias probably did not account for all of
the impact of exiting poverty. Another risk of observa-
tional studies is that severe disease may cause some indi-
viduals to fall into poverty, rather than the notion that
poverty causes poor outcomes. In this study, however, we
measured poverty status for 6 years prior to measuring
the extent of accumulated damage, increasing the proba-
bility that the poverty was antecedent to the outcome.
Finally,
the use of a self-report
proxy
for
physician-observed damage measures may have biased
the results, although we had previously established that
the BILD is a reliable indicator when compared to
physician-observed measures (16), and we validated its
use for longitudinal studies (34). Use of the proxy did
permit us to include individuals with SLE who had mini-
mal contact with the health system, in turn permitting
the analysis of a wider variation in the kind and quality
of health care than in studies conducted among patients
in tertiary care settings. The study design also permitted
us to observe damage accumulation from 2009 forward,
in effect modeling the increment of damage from the
point of presentation to health care providers. However,
because we did not follow up respondents from the
point of disease onset forward, it is possible that the
effects of health care may have been substantial prior to
enrollment in the LOS.
The results indicating that variations in health care
and health behaviors play a limited role in explaining dif-
ferences between the poor and non-poor in the extent of
accumulated damage in SLE should be seen in the con-
text of dramatic improvements in SLE care over the last
several decades (4,44,45), improvements that probably
have been sufficiently diffused to encompass the care of
both groups. Further improvements in care may, there-
fore, play an important role in attenuating disparities
between the poor and non-poor in the extent of accumu-
lated damage in SLE.
We previously demonstrated that technical quality
of care and ratings of interactions with providers and
health plans, especially coordination of care, by patients
with SLE is predictive of subsequent outcomes of the dis-
ease (32,46). The sensitivity analyses in which we evalu-
ated the impact of 3 prednisone regimens as a possible
additional factor contributing to outcome differences
between the poor and non-poor indicate that, although
the poor are more likely to receive each of the tested
regimens, little of the difference in accumulated damage
was due to their more frequent receipt of each of the
regimens. This is consistent with the results of the pri-
mary analysis that showed limited effects of variations in
health care in explaining differences in damage accrual
between the poor and non-poor. Overall, the present
study shows that the effects of poverty extend far beyond
variations in technical quality of care and in how patients
with SLE interact with providers and health systems to
incorporate the life circumstances of the individual.
The observation that stress, cognitive impairment,
and symptoms of depression account for a significant
amount of variation in extent of accumulated damage
associated with poverty and that exiting poverty sets
patients with SLE on a more benign course of disease all
raise important questions about what should be done to
deal with the poverty status of those with SLE and who
might best address these concerns. Coordination of care
is traditionally seen in terms of the medical care services
needed, which, in the case of patients with SLE, includes
helping individuals with the condition gain access to
Medicaid and organizing referrals to the range of provid-
ers to deal with the diversity of manifestations common
in this disease. However, such care coordination might
also encompass ensuring access to the benefits that
reduce the impacts of poverty, a role that is not tradition-
ally seen as within the purview of health care providers.
These benefits might include income support programs,
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (i.e.,
food stamps) (47), and housing assistance, for example,

 rent
subsidies
and
vouchers
to

to
better
neighborhoods (48). Of course, such coordination of ser-
vices, traditionally provided by social workers, is difficult
to fund in the present US health care system, and is likely
to become more difficult if such mechanisms as the
Accountable Care Organizations, a provision in the cur-
rent US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are
not maintained in health policy in the years to come.
The observation that high levels of perceived stress
account for a significant amount of the effect of poverty
suggests that attention within the health care system to
stress management may be a worthwhile supplement to
traditional medical care for SLE. However, there is likely
to be a limit to the amount that the profound stress asso-
ciated with persistent poverty and living in areas of con-
centrated poverty can be mitigated by stress management
programs, primarily because dealing with the daily issues
of food, housing, and medical care insecurity reduces the
capacity to handle other issues that arise (13), including
the development of a severe illness such as SLE.
The potential value of the opportunity to move
out of neighborhoods with high concentrations of pov-
erty (49) was made clear by the findings of the present
study, in which, among the poor, accumulated damage
was found to be greater in those living in such areas. The
burgeoning literature on the salutary effects of moving
out of areas of concentrated poverty incorporates a range
of effects, such as the likelihood of high school gradua-
tion, attendance at and completion of college, and subse-
quent earnings, with the positive effects greater for those
who left areas of concentrated poverty at younger ages
(49). However, the evidence for health effects is, at pres-
ent, limited to the observation that risk factor profiles
(50)
and
self-reported
subjective
health
(51)
may
improve. Nevertheless, advocacy for patients with SLE to
obtain housing vouchers so that they have the option of
leaving adverse neighborhoods may be warranted; at the
very least, research to evaluate the impact of such a strat-
egy should be initiated.
In the present study, we could explain only part of
the role that poverty plays in subsequent disease damage
through the specific mechanisms tested, including the
extent of human capital of the individual and the individu-
al’s parents, variations in kind and quality of medical care,
health behaviors, level of stress (or experience of eco-
nomic deprivation), and cognitive and mental health sta-
tus. It is possible that one could account for a greater
amount of the effect of poverty on outcomes through a
more extensive list of potential mechanisms or through
better measurement of each mechanism. However, it is
likely that there is much more about poverty that results
in adverse disease outcomes than can be captured by
these mechanisms, and that, although we can ask health
providers to be cognizant of the impact of poverty in their
clinical encounters (52), indeed to assume some responsi-
bility for what goes on outside of the health care setting
(53), much of the impact of poverty lies beyond health
care and must encompass anti-poverty policy more gener-
ally. In addition, there may be hidden but profound differ-
ences between individuals with SLE who do exit poverty
and those who do not exit poverty that limit the potential
effect of anti-poverty efforts for the long-term poor.
The results reported herein speak to the impor-
tance of poverty in the accumulation of disease damage
in SLE, but the extent to which redress of the impacts of
poverty can occur within clinical settings remains an open
question. The findings of the present study add to the evi-
dence that there is something etiologically important
about poverty with respect to SLE damage, but much
more needs to be done to know to what extent the effects
of poverty can be mitigated within the health care system,
even construed to include advocacy for benefits such as
housing vouchers, which are not traditionally thought to
be within the purview of health care providers.
