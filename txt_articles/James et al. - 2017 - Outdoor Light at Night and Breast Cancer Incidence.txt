BACKGROUND: Animal and epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to light at night (LAN) may disrupt circadian patterns and decrease nocturnal
secretion of melatonin, which may disturb estrogen regulation, leading to increased breast cancer risk.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between residential outdoor LAN and breast cancer incidence using data from the nationwide U.S.-based
Nurses’ Health Study II cohort.
METHODS: We followed 109,672 women from 1989 through 2013. Cumulative LAN exposure was estimated using time-varying satellite data for a
composite of persistent nighttime illumination at ∼ 1 km2 scale for each residence during follow-up. Incident invasive breast cancer cases were con-
firmed by medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
adjusting for anthropometric, reproductive, lifestyle, and socioeconomic risk factors.
RESULTS: Over 2,187,425 person-years, we identified 3,549 incident breast cancer cases. Based on a fully adjusted model, the estimated HR for inci-
dent breast cancer with an interquartile range (IQR) (31:6 nW=cm2=sr) increase in cumulative average outdoor LAN was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.11).
An association between LAN and breast cancer appeared to be limited to women who were premenopausal at the time of a case [HR = 1:07 (95% CI:
1.01, 1.14) based on 1,973 cases vs. HR = 1:00 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.09) based on 1,172 cases in postmenopausal women; p-interaction = 0:08]. The
LAN–breast cancer association was observed only in past and current smokers at the end of follow-up [HR = 1:00 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.07) based on
2,215 cases in never smokers; HR = 1:10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) based on 1,034 cases in past smokers vs. HR = 1:21 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.37) for 300 cases
in current smokers; p-interaction = 0:08].
CONCLUSIONS: Although further work is required to confirm our results and to clarify potential mechanisms, our findings suggest that exposure to res-
idential outdoor light at night may contribute to invasive breast cancer risk. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP935
Introduction
International differences in breast cancer incidence rates and
increases in rates among populations that migrate from low- to
high-risk areas support a role of environmental determinants of
breast cancer (Reynolds et al. 2004b; Willett 2001). In addition,
twin studies show that inherited genetic factors explain only a
minor proportion of susceptibility to breast cancer, which further
implicates the environment in driving breast cancer risk (Lichtenstein
et al. 2000). Recent evidence has demonstrated associations between
night-shift work and invasive breast cancer (Schernhammer et al.
2006b), and shift work is currently classified as a 2A “probable
human carcinogen” by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer(IARC)(Straif etal. 2007). Ithas beenhypothesizedthat the
relationship between night shift work and invasive breast cancer is
mediated by exposure to light at night (LAN) (Schernhammer et al.
2006b). Evidence points to the potential role of exposure to LAN in
contributing to breast cancer risk (Blask et al. 2011; Stevens et al.
2007; Stevens 2009), and animal and epidemiologic data suggest
that exposure to LAN can modulate pineal gland function to
decrease melatonin secretion (Haim and Zubidat 2015; Jasser et al.
2006) and disrupt circadian patterns and sleep (Blask et al. 2014;
Stevens et al. 2007), which may increase breast cancer risk (Blask
2009). Mechanistically, light falling onto specific retinal ganglion
cells at night triggers the pineal gland to stop the release of melato-
nin and disrupts the circadian system (Blask et al. 2014). Outdoor
LAN has been used as a surrogate for greater total evening and
nighttime circadian-effective light exposure because people living
in communities with higher outdoor LAN likely drive on roads that
are lit by street lighting, experience higher levels of light exposure
during evening outdoor activities, and have more outdoor light
intrusion into their bedrooms in the evening (Stevens 2011),
although it is unclear how well outdoor LAN captures personal
LAN exposure(Reaetal.2011).
With the above biological mechanisms as a foundation, recent
studies have examined links between outdoor LAN and breast
cancer in six ecological analyses (Keshet-Sitton et al. 2016a;
Kim et al. 2015; Kloog et al. 2008; Kloog et al. 2010; Portnov
et al. 2016; Rybnikova et al. 2015), two case–control studies
(Bauer et al. 2013; Keshet-Sitton et al. 2016b), and one prospec-
tive cohort in California (Hurley et al. 2014). These studies have
all reported associations between outdoor LAN and breast cancer;
however, to our knowledge, no prior study has participants living
throughout the continental United States; time-varying, resi-
dence-level exposure data; and individual-level information on
anthropometric, reproductive, lifestyle, and sociodemographic
risk factors.
Previous studies have reported that the association between
LAN and breast cancer may be modified by body mass index
(BMI), menopausal status, and urbanicity (Hurley et al. 2014;
Keshet-Sitton et al. 2016c; Portnov et al. 2016). In addition, race
and socioeconomic status (SES) (Palmer et al. 2012), as well as
air pollution (Parikh and Wei 2016; Wong et al. 2016), and
smoking (Cui et al. 2006; Gaudet et al. 2013; Gaudet et al. 2016;
Gram et al. 2015; Reynolds et al. 2004a) have been associated

Research
 with breast cancer risk in past analyses, and these exposures
could have possible synergistic effects on breast cancer risk in
concert with LAN if these factors increase susceptibility to breast
cancer. Analyses within the Nurses’ Health Study cohorts have
shown some regional differences in breast cancer risk (Laden
et al. 1997), and differing underlying susceptibility may lead
associations between LAN and breast cancer risk to vary across
regions. Night-shift work has been consistently associated with
breast cancer within the Nurses’ Health Study cohorts, and it has
been proposed that this association may be mediated by circadian
disruption (Schernhammer et al. 2001; Schernhammer et al.
2006b). Because both LAN exposure and night-shift work are
hypothesized to increase breast cancer risk through the same
pathway of circadian disruption, it is possible that these two fac-
tors may by synergistic. For instance, for women working rotat-
ing shifts, their circadian patterns may be disrupted on the days
they work night shifts, and LAN exposure may additionally dis-
rupt their circadian patterns on days that they are working day
shifts or not working.
Using data from the nationwide U.S.-based Nurses’ Health
Study II (NHSII) from 1989 through 2013, we aimed to examine
the association between outdoor LAN and invasive breast cancer
incidence. We hypothesized that there would be a positive associ-
ation between LAN and invasive breast cancer incidence. A pri-
ori, we also aimed to examine whether this association differed
by menopausal status, tumor estrogen receptor status, race, smok-
ing, night-shift work, census-tract SES, air pollution exposure,
region, or urban/nonurban residence status.
Methods
Population
NHSII is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 116,430 women
who were registered nurses, 25–42 y of age, and living in 14 U.S.
states when enrolled in 1989. Participants complete biennial
questionnaires on lifestyle factors, health behaviors, medical his-
tory, and incident disease. Response rates at each questionnaire
cycle have consistently been ∼ 90%. All mailing addresses over
follow-up were geocoded to the street or ZIP code centroid level
to obtain latitude and longitude (Figure 1A). NHSII participants
have changed residences since baseline, and currently there are
≥24 nurses in each of the 48 U.S. continental states. We excluded
women who did not have a geocoded address at the street seg-
ment level (n = 17,629 at baseline), who had missing LAN expo-
sure information (n = 1,299 at baseline), who had missing
information on menopausal status (n = 2,320 at baseline), or who
had a prior history of breast cancer at baseline (n = 685 at
baseline).
Informed consent was implied by return of the baseline ques-
tionnaire. The institutional review boards of Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health approved the original NHSII as well as this analysis.
Outcome
We identified incident invasive breast cancer cases by self-report
on biennial questionnaires from 1989 through 2013. A study phy-
sician performed medical record review to confirm cases (ICD-8
code 174.0) (WHO 1965) and to abstract information on inva-
siveness. Over 82% of cases were confirmed after medical record
review; the remaining cases were confirmed by state cancer regis-
tries, death records, contact with participants, or contact with
next of kin. Tissue block collection and tissue microarray (TMA)
construction were described in detail previously (Sisti et al. 2016;
Tamimi et al. 2008). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was
performed according to a standard protocol (Sisti et al. 2016;
Tamimi et al. 2008). Cases were considered estrogen receptor
(ER) positive if any tissue core showed any nuclear staining for
ER. Cases with complete absence of staining for ER were consid-
ered ER negative. For cases missing ER status by IHC (77% of
all cases), ER status was based on the pathology report or on the
medical record. We could not determine ER status for ∼ 25% of
cases, primarily in the later years, because study staff are still
working to collect data. For the years 2011–2013, we are actively
collecting tissue, and the majority of data on tumor ER status for
these years are based on pathology reports. We have previously
demonstrated a very high concordance between pathology reports
and TMA (Collins et al. 2008). Additionally, we have shown in
previous analyses that cases missing tumor marker information
were not significantly different from cases with tumor marker in-
formation in terms of characteristics and accepted breast cancer
risk factors (Wang et al. 2015).
Exposure
Data on annual outdoor LAN were derived from satellite imagery
data from the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s
(DMSP’s) Operational Linescan System, maintained by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s)
Earth Observation Group (NOAA National Geophysical Data
Center 2015). This database contains annual composites made af-
ter excluding the outer quarters of the satellite swath, sun and
moon luminance, glare, clouds, atmospheric lightning, and
ephemeral events such as fires. Although these images capture
only a fraction of the light originating from the Earth’s surface,
they represent the relative levels of nighttime illumination at
ground level (Hsu et al. 2015). The processed imagery data are
georectified to a 30 arc-second grid equivalent to ∼ 1 km2.
Previous studies have shown that the low-dynamic range 6-bit
DMSP data do not vary within urban areas, where levels of LAN
are high (nearly every residence in an urban or suburban area was
assigned the maximum value of 63) (Hurley et al. 2013).
Therefore, we used the DMSP Global Radiance Calibrated
Nighttime Lights high-dynamic range data, which can be trans-
formed into units of radiance (nW=cm2=sr) (Figure 1B) (Hsu
et al. 2015). High-dynamic range data were available for 1996,
1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2010. To ensure comparabil-
ity across years and satellites, we used interannual calibration
coefficients provided by NOAA to derive exposure estimates
(NOAA 2017). We assigned a nighttime radiance value for each
geocoded address in each questionnaire year from 1989–2011
using ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA). If a participant changed
addresses during follow-up, their estimated exposure was updated
at the date of the new questionnaire in which they indicated their
new address. For addresses before 1997, exposure was assigned
based on the 1996 LAN data. For addresses after 1997, exposure
was assigned based on the most recent past LAN measure. We
calculated cumulative average outdoor LAN for each participant
at each questionnaire response, which accounted for changes in
LAN over time as well as for participant changes of address.
Statistical Analysis
Person-years of follow-up were accrued from the return date of
the 1989 questionnaire until the participant became a case or
died, or until the end of follow-up (31 May 2013). Person-time
was skipped if a participant missed a questionnaire or temporarily
moved outside of the contiguous United States, but these partici-
pants could contribute person-time to the analysis if they filled
out a subsequent questionnaire or moved back to the contiguous
United States. We used the date of the last questionnaire

 completed as the end of follow-up. Deaths were usually reported
by families, and deaths among nonrespondents were identified by
searching the National Death Index, which has been validated in
prior studies in this cohort (Rich-Edwards et al. 1994). We fit
time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression models to cal-
culate the hazard ratio (HR) for developing breast cancer (overall
and by ER status) associated with cumulative average outdoor
LAN, using both continuous LAN based on an interquartile range
(IQR) increase (31:6 nW=cm2=sr) as well as quintiles of LAN
with a test for trend based on the median value for each quintile.
We used likelihood ratio tests to compare the fit of models that
included cubic splines with models having linear terms only to

 test for statistically significant departures from linearity. To test
for violations of the proportional hazards assumption, we
included interaction terms of LAN exposure and calendar time
and performed likelihood ratio tests.
Analyses were stratified by age at follow-up and by calendar
year, and we adjusted for all of the following covariates a priori
as potential confounders based on questionnaire data because
they are potential breast cancer risk factors and may be correlated
with LAN. Time-invariant factors included race (white/non-
white), benign breast disease history at baseline (yes/no), family
history of breast cancer at baseline (yes/no), age at menarche
(years), height at baseline (inches), BMI at age 18 (kilograms per
meter squared), and personal income assessed in 2001 (thousands
of U.S. dollars per year; <15=15–19=20–29=30–39=40–49=
50–74=75–99=100–149= ≥ 150). Time-varying factors included
parity and age (years) at first birth [nulliparous/1–2 children
(before 25/25–29/≥30)/3–4 children (before 25/25–29/≥30)/5–8
children (before 25/ ≥25], BMI (kilograms per meter squared;
based on self-reported weight at each questionnaire and height at
baseline), menopausal status (yes/no), oral contraceptive use (yes/
no), mammography screening (yes/no), smoking status (current/
past/never), marital status (married/nonmarried), living alone (yes/
no),night-shiftwork(never/everperformingshiftworkafter1989),
alternative healthy eating index (AHEI) (continuous) (Chiuve et al.
2012), and physical activity [total metabolic equivalent of task
hours per week (MET hrs/wk)]. Family history of breastcancer was
defined as a mother, sister, or grandmother with any type of breast
cancer. Menopausal status was assessed every two years based on
self-report and was used as time-varying in analyses. Physical ac-
tivity was evaluated every 2–6 y based on a validated measure of
self-reported total physical activity in the past year (Wolf et al.
1994). Values were carried forward for years between physical ac-
tivity questionnaires. The AHEI, an overall diet quality measure
based on alcohol consumption, foods, and nutrients predictive of
chronic disease risk, was calculated from food frequency question-
naires asking about typical consumption in the past year (Willett
et al. 1985) that were completed every 4 y. Values were carried for-
ward for years between food frequency questionnaires. We
accounted for area-level SES by including census-tract median
homevalueandincome,andwealsoadjustedforcensus-tractpopu-
lation density and for region of United States based on geocoded
address. Census datacame fromthe 2000U.S.Census(U.S.Census
Bureau 2000). To reduce potential confounding by air pollution
exposures that have been associated with breast cancer in previous
studies (Parikh and Wei 2016; Wong et al. 2016), we adjusted for
modeled 24-mo average particulate matter <2:5 lm (PM2:5) expo-
sure,whichwaspredictedateachgeocodedaddressusingageneral-
ized additive mixed model (Yanosky et al. 2014). The PM2:5 model
extended from 1989–2006; values from 2007–2013 were carried
forward. We used indicator variables in models to account for miss-
ing values in covariates, which has been shown to be a valid
approach for dealing with missing data without losing power (Song
2016).
To assess whether the association between LAN and breast
cancer differed across subpopulations, we examined effect modi-
fication by current menopausal status, BMI (BMI <30 vs. BMI
≥30), race (white vs. nonwhite), smoking (current vs. past vs.
never), PM2:5 (quintiles), census-tract population density (quin-
tiles), census-tract median income (quintiles), census-tract home
value (quintiles), census region (northeast, midwest, west, and
south), census-tract urbanicity (urban vs. nonurban), and night-
shift work (no night-shift work since 1989 vs. any night-shift
work since 1989). Urbanicity was determined by the participant’s
residence in an urban (≥50,000 people) or nonurban [urban clus-
ter
(10,000–49,999
people)
or
small
town/rural
(<10,000
people)] census tract. To evaluate whether the association
between continuous LAN and breast cancer risk varied across
these factors, we fit separate Cox proportional hazards models
within strata of these factors and estimated stratum-specific HRs.
For all time-varying factors, analyses were stratified by person-
time. To test for significance of statistical interaction between
LAN and each factor, we used a likelihood ratio test comparing
models with cross-product terms and main-effects-only models.
Observations with missing values for each factor were excluded
from effect modification analyses. We examined whether there
was heterogeneity in the association between LAN and breast
cancer risk by tumor ER status (negative vs. positive) using the
contrast test method (Wang et al. 2016). We performed sensitiv-
ity analyses restricting observations to 1997–2013 and estimating
cumulative average LAN exposure starting in 1997, when con-
current LAN satellite data were available. An alpha level of 0.05
was used to define statistical significance, and all analyses were
performed in SAS v.9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
We observed 3,549 invasive breast cancer cases over 2,187,425
person-years of follow-up among the 109,672 eligible cohort
members from 1989–2013. Over the person-time contributing to
this analysis, participants were predominantly white and were
more likely to be premenopausal and married (Table 1). The ma-
jority of person-time came from participants who lived in metro-
politan areas, and two-thirds of the person-time came from
participants who lived in the northeastern or midwestern United
States. As expected in a population of nurses, 42% of the person-
years contributed came from women who had performed night-
shift work. Higher cumulative average LAN was associated with
higher average values over follow-up for census-tract population
density and median home value as well as with nulliparity, non-
white race, and being nonmarried.
Estimated associations between cumulative average outdoor
LAN and breast cancer are shown in Table 2. There was an esti-
mated 14% increased risk of breast cancer in the top quintile of out-
door LAN compared with the lowest quintile of LAN (95% CI:
1.01, 1.29) in the fully adjusted model. The association was strong-
est for the highest quintile but was not monotonic with increasing
LAN. Cubic spline models did not significantly improve model fit
relative to linear models (data not shown). Continuous analyses

[HR = 1:06 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.13) based on 105,304 women and
2,954breastcancercases](Table3).
Analyses stratified by current menopausal status at the time of
breast cancer diagnosis suggested that the positive association
between LAN and breast cancer was specific to premenopausal
women [HR per IQR increase in LAN for premenopausal
women=1.07 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.14) based on 1,973 cases; HR for
postmenopausal women=1.00 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.09) based on
1,172 cases; p for interaction=0.08] (Table 4; see also Figure
S1). We did not detect statistically significant heterogeneity in
the HRs for outdoor LAN when comparing ER-positive versus
ER-negative tumors (see Table S1; p for heterogeneity=0.33),
although we did observe a positive association for ER-positive tu-
mor types [HR per IQR increase in LAN=1.06 (95% CI: 0.99,
1.13) based on 2,137 cases], which comprised the majority of
cases, and no association for ER-negative tumors [HR=0.98
(95% CI: 0.85, 1.13) based on 512 cases]. Associations were

increase in LAN=1.09 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.18) based on 1,196
cases] compared with those who had never worked night shifts
since 1989 [HR=1.03 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.09) based on 2,353 cases]
(Table 5; see also Figure S1). The association between LAN and
breast cancer was observed only in past and current smokers [HR
for current smokers=1.21 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.37) based on 300
cases; HR for past smokers=1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) based on
1,034 cases; HR for never smokers=1.00 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.07)
based on 2,215 cases; p for interaction=0.008] (Table 6; see also
Figure S1). There were no statistically significant differences in
the association between LAN and breast cancer by BMI, race,
PM2:5, census-tract median income, census-tract median home
value, census region, census-tract population density, or census-
tract urban/nonurban status (see Figure S1).
Discussion
In this nationwide prospective analysis of female nurses, we
observed a positive association between cumulative average ex-
posure to residential outdoor LAN and breast cancer risk, which
was robust to adjustment for many important breast cancer risk
factors. This association was generally consistent across catego-
ries of BMI, race, PM2:5, and census-tract level median income,
median home value, population density, and urban/nonurban sta-
tus. The association between LAN and breast cancer was
observed only among current and past smokers and premeno-
pausal women. The association between LAN and breast cancer
risk was more pronounced among women who had worked night
shifts and was linked most strongly to ER-positive tumor types,
although differences were not statistically significant across these
factors.
Studies have observed an association between exposure to
LAN and cancer risk in animal models (Blask et al. 2014;
Stevens et al. 2007); however, few epidemiologic studies have
examined the association between outdoor LAN and breast can-
cer. Several ecological studies reported that satellite-based LAN
was associated with breast cancer incidence at the country or
community level (Keshet-Sitton et al. 2016a; Kim et al. 2015;
Kloog et al. 2008, 2010; Portnov et al. 2016; Rybnikova et al.
2015). For example, one study reported a 73% higher incidence
of breast cancer in communities with the highest LAN than in
those with the lowest LAN across 147 communities in Israel
(Kloog et al. 2008). Although these studies were consistent with
our findings, they were limited by their inability to link individual
exposure and outcome as well as by the lack of information on
individual-level confounding. A case–control study using breast
cancer cases and lung cancer controls in the U.S. state of Georgia
suggested a link between higher levels of outdoor LAN exposure,
assessed at the geocoded address, and breast cancer risk. The
authors found that high LAN exposure (>41 nW=cm2=sr) was
associated with increased odds of breast cancer compared with
low LAN exposure (≤20 nW=cm2=sr) [OR = 1:12 (95% CI: 1.04,
1.20)] (Bauer et al. 2013). In a small case–control study in Israel,
participants who reported living near “strong artificial light at
night sources” had higher odds of being a breast cancer case
[OR = 1:52 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.12)] (Keshet-Sitton et al. 2016b). To
the best of our knowledge, there has only been one prior prospec-
tive cohort study examining outdoor LAN and breast cancer
risk. Hurley et al. (2014) examined California Teacher’s Study

 (CTS) data on 106,731 participants and found that women
living in areas with the highest quintile of LAN (range:
53:4–175:2 nW=cm2=sr) compared with the lowest quintile
(range: 0–14:2 nW=cm2=sr) had the highest risk of invasive
breast cancer [HR=1.12 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.26)]. The authors
assessed LAN exposure for baseline addresses (1995–96) using
high-dynamic range LAN data for 2006. Consistent with our find-
ings, the association appeared to be specific to premenopausal
women [HR for the highest vs. lowest LAN quintile=1.34 (95%
CI: 1.07, 1.69) vs. 1.04 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.20), respectively, for
postmenopausal women], although the difference was not signifi-
cant (p for interaction = 0:34). Because only one year of high-
dynamic range data was available at the time of analysis, the
CTS study did not include time-varying information on exposure.
The present analysis extends that research by including time-
varying exposure information at a broader range of outdoor LAN
levels (ranging from 0:39–248:1 nW=cm2=sr) and by expanding
the geographic scope to the entire contiguous United States. Our
results corroborate the findings of the CTS and provide further
evidence that outdoor LAN may be associated with increased
breast cancer risk.
Our analysis of effect modification of the LAN–breast cancer
relationship by smoking status revealed that associations were
only evident in current and past smokers. Smoking has been asso-
ciated with breast cancer in some studies (Cui et al. 2006; Gaudet
et al. 2013; Gaudet et al. 2016; Gram et al. 2015; Luo et al. 2011;
Reynolds et al. 2004a), although other studies have not reported
associations (Egan et al. 2002; Palmer and Rosenberg 1993). A
prior study of 459 NHSII participants reported that creatinine-
corrected melatonin concentrations in spot urine samples were
significantly lower in women with ≥15 pack-years of smoking
than in never smokers (Schernhammer et al. 2006a), and lower
melatonin has been associated with increased breast cancer risk
(Schernhammer and Hankinson 2009). Our finding of increased
relative risks among smokers exposed to higher LAN suggests
that LAN and smoking may share similar melatonin-mediated
pathways to breast cancer risk.
This study is one of the first analyses of LAN and breast can-
cer that incorporates information on night-shift work. In stratified
analyses, the association between LAN and breast cancer was
stronger among participants who worked night shifts at any time
since 1989 than among those who did not, although the difference
was not statistically significant (interaction p-value = 0:10). This
finding suggests that both exposure to LAN and night-shift work
contribute jointly to increase breast cancer risk, possibly through
mechanisms involving circadian disruption.
Although our results should be interpreted with caution given
the small numbers of ER-negative cases, this analysis suggests
that the association with LAN was limited to ER-positive tumors.
This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that LAN acts
through
estrogen
receptor
signaling–mediated
pathways
to
increase breast cancer risk. Hurley et al. (2014) also examined
associations with LAN according to ER (and progesterone recep-
tor) status, but they noted that numbers of cases within subgroups
were small, and they did not report quantitative estimates from
this analysis.
Our study has a few limitations. First, exposure misclassifica-
tion could occur because of missing satellite data and data proc-
essing errors. In addition, satellite-based measures of outdoor
LAN are a proxy for total personal exposure to LAN, and a study
has demonstrated that outdoor LAN measures may not capture
true individual exposure to LAN, including indoor sources, that

 is thought to drive breast cancer risk (Rea et al. 2011). Although
total personal exposure to LAN may be important to discern the
etiologic association between LAN and breast cancer, the associ-
ation between outdoor LAN and breast cancer risk may be rele-
vant in a policy context because city- or county-scale policies
that limit outdoor nighttime lighting may affect ambient LAN
levels. Alternatively, outdoor LAN could be a proxy for an
unmeasured breast cancer risk factor, where policies to limit out-
door LAN would have little effect. In addition, in this analysis,
LAN data were available starting in 1996, so there was a tempo-
ral mismatch between LAN measures and our breast cancer data
for earlier observations. However, analyses restricted to years af-
ter 1996 showed similar results. Although we successfully geo-
coded 85% of addresses to the street level, residences that could
not be geocoded may differ in urban/nonurban characteristics,
and thus, they may differ in LAN exposure. Given the relatively
low proportion of missing exposure data, any selection bias is
expected to be minimal. In addition, participants were 25–42 y
old at baseline in 1989, so this analysis is missing data on expo-
sure before this period, which might be an etiologically important
time window. With any study of neighborhood factors and health,
there is a possibility that participants may self-select into certain
neighborhoods they deem “healthier” than others. However,
adjustment for established breast cancer risk factors reduces the
likelihood that neighborhood self-selection explains the associa-
tions that we observed. Because >95% of participants classified
themselves as white, we were underpowered to detect differences
in the association between outdoor LAN and breast cancer by
race/ethnicity, and our findings may not be generalizable to
women who are not white. Because all participants were nurses
at enrollment, the generalizability of our findings to lower SES,
nonworking groups is also potentially limited. Finally, although
we adjusted for air pollution and population density, we cannot
rule out the possibility that other factors that are correlated with
outdoor LAN [e.g., economic activity (Rybnikova and Portnov
2015)] might explain the observed association between LAN and
breast cancer risk.
This analysis has a number of strengths. First, this study was
conducted over more than two decades with time-varying infor-
mation about outdoor LAN recorded at the residence level.
Second, this study applied high-dynamic range, objective satellite
data to capture potentially important intraurban differences in
outdoor LAN and included information on higher levels of LAN
exposure. Third, we have time-varying information on a number
of factors, including menopausal status, family history of breast
cancer, parity, oral contraceptive use, smoking status, diet, physi-
cal activity, air pollution, and area-level SES. To our knowledge,
no prior LAN analyses have examined effect modification by
smoking status, and our findings suggest that the association
between LAN and breast cancer risk existed only in current or
past smokers. This is also the first LAN study of which the
authors are aware to incorporate information about night-shift
work into the analysis, with >42% of the study population having
worked night shifts since 1989. Thus, we were able to adjust for
potential confounding by many established and suspected breast
cancer risk factors. Finally, this nationwide study covers a broad
geographic range of outdoor LAN levels, including participants
in both urban and nonurban areas.
Conclusions
This prospective study, conducted over 22 y of follow-up with
time-varying and objective measures of ambient LAN across the
contiguous United States, provides evidence that women living in
areas with high levels of outdoor LAN may be at higher risk of
breast cancer even after accounting for individual and area-level
risk factors for breast cancer. Athough further work is required to
confirm our results and to clarify potential mechanisms, our find-
ings suggest that exposure to outdoor light at night may contrib-
ute to breast cancer risk.
