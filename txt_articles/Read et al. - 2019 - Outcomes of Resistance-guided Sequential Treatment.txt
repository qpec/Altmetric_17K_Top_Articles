Background. Rising macrolide and quinolone resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium necessitate new treatment approaches. We 
evaluated outcomes of sequential antimicrobial therapy for M. genitalium guided by a macrolide-resistance assay.
Methods. In mid-2016, Melbourne Sexual Health Centre switched from azithromycin to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 
7 days) for nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis. Cases were tested for M. genitalium and macrolide-resistance muta-
tions (MRMs) by polymerase chain reaction. Directly after doxycycline, MRM-negative infections received 2.5 g azithromycin (1 g, 
then 500 mg daily for 3 days), and MRM-positive infections received sitafloxacin (100 mg twice daily for 7 days). Assessment of test 
of cure and reinfection risk occurred 14–90 days after the second antibiotic.
Results. Of 244 evaluable M. genitalium infections (52 women, 68 heterosexual men, 124 men who have sex with men) diag-
nosed from 20 June 2016 to 15 May 2017, MRMs were detected in 167 (68.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 62.2%–74.2%]). 
Treatment with doxycycline decreased bacterial load by a mean 2.60 log10 (n = 56; P < .0001). Microbiologic cure occurred in 73 of 
77 MRM-negative infections (94.8% [95% CI, 87.2%–98.6%]) and in 154 of 167 MRM-positive infections (92.2% [95% CI, 87.1%–
95.8%]). Selection of macrolide resistance occurred in only 2 of 76 (2.6% [95% CI, .3%–9.2%]) macrolide-susceptible infections.
Conclusions. In the context of high levels of antimicrobial resistance, switching from azithromycin to doxycycline for presumptive treat-
ment of M. genitalium, followed by resistance-guided therapy, cured ≥92% of infections, with infrequent selection of macrolide resistance.
Keywords. Mycoplasma genitalium; urethritis; antibiotic resistance; azithromycin; sitafloxacin.
Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted cause of non-
gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and is associated with cervicitis, 
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and poor obstetric out-
comes [1, 2]. Recommended first-line treatment for M. gen-
italium has been azithromycin, but this is now known to fail 
in at least 10% of susceptible infections, leading to selection 
(posttreatment detection) of strains with macrolide-resistance 
mutations (MRMs) at positions 2058 or 2059 in the 23S ribo-
somal RNA (rRNA) gene [3, 4]. We use the term “selection,” 
but it is unknown to what extent this represents the selection of 
resistance emerging during treatment vs selection of minority 
populations with preexisting resistance mutations. Macrolide 
resistance is now reported in >50% of diagnosed infections in 
many countries, having been uncommon a decade ago [5–11].
Culturing M. genitalium is difficult and performed in few 
centers worldwide, limiting our understanding of its antibi-
otic susceptibilities. Mycoplasma genitalium has no cell wall, 
limiting treatment choice to macrolides or later-generation 
fluoroquinolones [3, 12]. The streptogramin pristinamycin 
has recently been shown to cure only 75% of macrolide-resis-
tant infections [13]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis has shown 
a decline in cure for moxifloxacin from 100% in studies prior 
to 2010, to 89% in studies from 2010 onward [14]. ParC fluo-
roquinolone resistance mutations, which reduce the efficacy of 
moxifloxacin, were recently detected in 14%–15% of Australian 
cases, 27%–40% of cases in human immunodeficiency virus–
infected men in the United States, and 47% of cases in Japan 
[8, 15–17]. These data suggest that continuing to treat M. gen-
italium with single agents will increase the prevalence of resis-
tance and reduce remaining treatment options [12].
In response, European, British, and Australian treatment 
guidelines have recently recommended azithromycin be 
replaced as initial treatment for NGU, with doxycycline 100 mg

 Treatment of M. genitalium • CID 2019:68 (15 February) • 555
twice daily for 7 days [18, 19]. Doxycycline is highly effective for 
Chlamydia trachomatis but only cures about a third of M. gen-
italium infections; however, it does not appear to select further 
identifiable resistance in treatment failures. Furthermore, stud-
ies of extended azithromycin treatment of M. genitalium show 
better outcomes for infections that were previously treated with 
doxycycline than those that were not, suggesting that doxycy-
cline may have influenced the outcome of subsequent macro-
lide treatment [3, 4]. Because several studies have shown that 
M. genitalium infections with lower loads were more likely to 
be cured, it may be that doxycycline lowered bacterial load, ren-
dering M. genitalium more susceptible to a subsequent macro-
lide [11, 13, 20].
In 2016, in response to macrolide resistance exceeding 50%, 
(20% of these also quinolone resistant) [11, 17] and diminishing 
treatment options, the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) 
introduced a 3-step approach to treatment of M. genitalium. First, 
azithromycin was replaced with doxycycline (100 mg twice daily 
for 7 days) for the treatment of NGU, proctitis, and cervicitis. 
Second, patients were tested with a combined diagnostic/resis-
tance assay that detected M. genitalium and the 5 main MRMs in 
23S rRNA (ResistancePlus MG, SpeeDx, Australia) [21]. Third, 
treatment for M. genitalium was guided by the macrolide-resis-
tance result. Macrolide-susceptible infections received a higher 
extended dose of azithromycin of 2.5 g (1 g followed by 500 mg 
daily for a total of 4 days), and macrolide-resistant infections 
received sitafloxacin 100 mg twice daily for 7 days. This dose of 
azithromycin was selected because, although some studies sug-
gest better outcomes with 1.5 g compared with 1 g [4], we found 
no significant improvement in M. genitalium cure with 1.5 g 
compared to the 1-g dose and postulated that the dose increase 
was insufficient to consistently increase proportions cured [11]. 
Sitafloxacin was used instead of moxifloxacin because in vitro 
data show lower mean inhibitory concentrations than moxiflox-
acin in moxifloxacin-susceptible isolates, and sitafloxacin retains 
activity in some strains with moxifloxacin resistance (Jorgen 
Jensen, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, personal commu-
nication, June 2015). Patients diagnosed with M. genitalium 
without NGU, proctitis, or cervicitis, such as sexual contacts of 
individuals infected with M. genitalium, were also pretreated with 
a week of doxycycline. We aimed to increase the proportion of 
M. genitalium infections cured above 90% and to reduce selection 
of macrolide resistance.
METHODS
This was a prospective evaluation of patients treated by resis-
tance-guided therapy for M. genitalium infections at MSHC 
from 20 June 2016 to 15 May 2017. MSHC is the only pub-
lic clinic treating sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in 
Melbourne, a city of 4.5 million. Cases were evaluated if they 
did not receive azithromycin initially, they received doxy-
cycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, were diagnosed with 
 
M. genitalium using a diagnostic-resistance polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) assay (ResistancePlus MG, SpeeDx Pty Ltd, 
Australia), and if treatment was based on their macrolide-resis-
tance result. Those with no detectable MRMs received azithro-
mycin 2.5 g (1 g followed by 500 mg daily for a total of 4 days), 
and those with detectable MRMs received sitafloxacin 100 mg 
twice daily for 7 days.
Patients were asked to return for a test of cure using the same 
assay 21–28 days after starting sitafloxacin or azithromycin 
(28–35 days after commencing doxycycline). Nurses made at 
least 2 attempts to contact those who failed to attend. Clinicians 
performing a test of cure used a template to enter data in the 
electronic medical record. The template listed key variables, 
including persistence of symptoms, adherence to each anti-
biotic, adverse events, and posttreatment sexual exposure to 
new or continuing partners, and whether those partners were 
treated.
A substudy to measure the impact of doxycycline on organism 
load was performed in 56 patients with M. genitalium urethritis. 
When patients returned for their second antibiotic, a subset of 
patients were asked for a urine sample, and the number of doses 
of doxycycline taken was recorded. These urine samples were 
stored frozen at –80°C and at the end of the study were tested 
simultaneously by quantitative PCR for M. genitalium load 
alongside the original diagnostic sample. To examine selection 
of macrolide resistance, Sanger sequencing was also performed 
on pre- and posttreatment samples that had been classified as 
susceptible by the resistance PCR assay, treated with azithromy-
cin, and failed, to determine if selection of macrolide resistance 
had occurred, as described previously [7].
Patients were included in the study if (1) treatment followed 
the protocol; (2) they returned for a test of cure at 14–90 days 
after starting their second antibiotic; and (3) they did not report 
ongoing condomless sex with a pretreatment partner, unless 
this partner had also completed treatment. Patients not meeting 
these criteria were excluded, regardless of test-of-cure result, to 
prevent bias.
Test-of-cure results were stratified by posttreatment reinfec-
tion risk, based on responses to questions on the clinical tem-
plate. Reinfection risk was categorized as follows: no sex since 
treatment, sex with 100% condom use, any condomless sex with 
a fully treated partner, any condomless sex with a new partner, or 
any condomless sex with a partner who had not completed treat-
ment. The association with each category and positive test of cure 
was examined by univariate logistic regression. Pretreatment 
and posttreatment M. genitalium bacterial load data among men 
with NGU were log10 transformed and means were compared by 
paired t test. Proportions of men who have sex with men (MSM) 
and heterosexuals with macrolide resistance were compared by χ2 
test. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of proportions were cal-
culated by exact methods. The Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee 
approved this study (approval number 232/16).

RESULTS
Of 429 M. genitalium infections diagnosed during the study 
period, 313 (73%) were treated according to the resistance-guided 
protocol (Figure 1). The commonest reasons for not following 
the protocol were azithromycin treatment at diagnosis (eg, coex-
isting gonorrhea) or contraindications to fluoroquinolones. Of 
313 treated according to the protocol, 49 did not return and 4 
returned outside the 14- to 90-day follow-up interval, leaving 
260 (83.1%) in whom treatment outcome could be determined. 
A further 16 were excluded because they reported condomless 
sex with untreated or incompletely treated partners. This exclu-
sion was supported by the strong association with a positive test 
of cure (odds ratio, 6.65 [95% CI, 1.85–23.84]; Table 1).
Characteristics of the remaining 244 participants are shown 
in Table 2. The median time to test of cure, from the start of 
the second antibiotic, was 28 days (interquartile range [IQR], 
22–35 days) and patients commenced their second antibiotic 
a median of 7 days (mean, 8.5 days) from initiation of doxycy-
cline. The 2 most common presentations were NGU (45%) and 
being a sexual contact of a person with M. genitalium infection 
(24%); 75% of all participants reported symptoms. Macrolide-
resistance mutations were detected in 167 of 244 (68.4% [95% 
CI, 62.2%–74.2%]) infections, and were more common in MSM 
(87.1% [95% CI, 79.9%–92.0%]) than in heterosexual men and 
women (49.2% [95% CI, 40.3%–58.1%]) (P < .0001).
Treatment Outcomes
Of the 77 macrolide-susceptible cases receiving doxycycline 
then 2.5 g azithromycin, 73 were microbiologically cured 
(94.8% [95% CI, 87.2%–98.6%]) and 4 had positive tests of cure 
Figure 1. Selection of cases and outcomes of resistance-guided sequential treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections. Bottom row: data in parentheses indicate the 
95% confidence interval. aReasons why 116 patients were not treated according to the resistance result and were excluded: women treated for pelvic inflammatory disease 
(n = 33), treatment initiated in the community (n = 23), patients given single-dose azithromycin at diagnosis, mostly with ceftriaxone for gonorrhea (n = 22), individuals who did 
not return for treatment (n = 16), patients given pristinamycin because quinolones were contraindicated (n = 12), other variations in dose or medication choice (n = 10). bThese 
individuals reported condomless sex with an untreated sexual partner. cSanger sequencing of pretreatment samples from these 4 individuals identified macrolide-resistance 
mutations (MRMs) in 1 sample. MRMs were detected in 2 of the remaining 3 samples, meaning MRMs emerged during treatment in 2 of 76 cases.

(5.2% [95% CI, 1.4%–12.8%]). Macrolide-resistance mutations 
were detected in the posttreatment samples of 3 of the 4 fail-
ures by the resistance PCR assay. Sequencing of the 23S rRNA 
gene in the posttreatment samples confirmed that 3 were mac-
rolide resistant and 1 was wild type. This wild type was detected 
40 days posttreatment in a woman reporting no missed doses 
and full condom use with a new partner. Subsequent sequencing 
of the 23S rRNA gene in the pretreatment samples from these 4 
individuals detected MRMs in 1 sample (with a posttreatment 
MRM detected) that had not been detected by the resistance 
PCR assay. Therefore, selection of MRM was observed in only 2 
of the azithromycin failures (2/76 macrolide-susceptible infec-
tions; 2.6% [95% CI, .3%–9.2%]). Of the 167 macrolide-resis-
tant cases treated with doxycycline followed by sitafloxacin, 154 
were microbiologically cured (92.2% [95% CI, 87.1%–95.8%]), 
and 13 had positive tests of cure (7.8% [95% CI, 4.2%–12.9%])

(Figure 1). Overall, 227 of 244 (93.0% [95% CI, 89.1%–95.9%]) 
were cured. The proportion cured did not differ between sex-
ual risk groups, sites of infection, and symptom status, lying 
between 91.1% and 95.1% in these groups.
Adherence and Adverse Events
Adherence data were recorded by clinicians in 217 of 244 
(88.9%) patients for doxycycline, 152 of 167 (91.0%) patients 
for sitafloxacin, and 63 of 77 (81.8%) patients for azithromycin. 
Self-reported adherence was high with 89.9%, 90.8%, and 100%, 
respectively, reporting taking all doses of prescribed antimicro-
bials (Table 3). Adverse event data were recorded in 224 of 244 
(91.8%) patients and, of these, the proportions reporting no 
adverse events were 86.6% for doxycycline, 91.4% for azithro-
mycin, and 80.5% for sitafloxacin. Commonly reported adverse 
events were as follows: for doxycycline: nausea (5.4%) and diar-
rhea (4.9%); for azithromycin: nausea (5.7%); and for sitaflox-
acin: diarrhea (11.7%) and tendon/joint pain (5.2%) (Table 3). 
The only reported adverse event leading to cessation of sitaflox-
acin was 1 case of patchy hypoesthesia on the limbs and face of 
a man, which did not appear to be peripheral neuropathy and 
resolved after 3 weeks.
Bacterial Load
Mycoplasma genitalium load in urine, before and during or 
immediately after doxycycline, was measured in 56 men with 
urethritis. At the time of sample collection, men had taken a 
median of 13 of 14 doses (IQR, 11–14 doses). Mycoplasma gen-
italium load was undetectable in 22 (39%) men, reduced but 
detectable in 28 (50%) men, and increased in 6 (11%) men. 
Mean bacterial load declined by 2.60 log10 from pretreatment 
levels (P < .0001; Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that >92% of anogenital M. genitalium 
infections can be cured in a population where two-thirds of 
cases are macrolide resistant and 20% of macrolide-resistant 
cases are likely quinolone resistant [15, 17]. This was achieved 
by pretreating with doxycycline and selecting a second anti-
microbial with a macrolide-resistance assay. Selection of mac-
rolide resistance occurred in <3% of macrolide-susceptible 
infections treated with sequential therapy. Replacing azithro-
mycin with doxycycline for initial treatment of STI syndromes 
has the dual advantage of reducing overall use of azithromycin 
and reducing M. genitalium load. We hypothesize that reduc-
tion in bacterial load before commencing the second antimi-
crobial contributed to the high proportion cured and reduced 
the rate of selected macrolide resistance. In our clinic popula-
tion, adherence to this regimen was high and antimicrobials 
were generally well tolerated, but fourth-generation fluoro-
quinolones are expensive, and almost 20% of patients taking 
sitafloxacin reported some adverse event. Further research 
is required to determine if all components of this treatment 
protocol (ie, doxycycline pretreatment, choice and dosage of 
antibiotics) are necessary to achieve these high levels of cure.
The outcomes in the doxycycline-azithromycin treatment 
arm are better than in contemporary studies of azithromy-
cin treatment of unselected M. genitalium. A meta-analysis of 
21 studies of single-dose 1 g azithromycin showed that pro-
portions cured fell from 85% before 2009 to 67% afterward, 
consistent with a rising prevalence of resistance [22]. In the 
3 randomized trials comparing doxycycline and single-dose 
azithromycin for NGU, proportions with M. genitalium cured

 Treatment of M. genitalium • CID 2019:68 (15 February) • 559
following azithromycin declined from 87% to 67% to 40% in 
studies published in 2009, 2011, and 2013, respectively [23–25]. 
A meta-analysis by Horner et al found that single-dose 1 g azi-
thromycin failed in 13.9% of 353 cases known to be macrolide 
susceptible, resulting in the selection of macrolide resistance 
in 12.0% (95% CI, 7.1%–16.9%) [4]. With doxycycline pre-
treatment and an increased dose of azithromycin, we observed 
selection of macrolide resistance in only 2 of 76 macrolide-sus-
ceptible cases (2.6% [95% CI, .3%–9.2%]). While Horner et al’s 
meta-analysis reported selected resistance in a similar pro-
portion of cases (3/82 [3.7%]) treated with azithromycin 1.5 g 
over 5 days [4], in a recent study at our center, 4 of 34 (11.8%) 
cases treated with the 1.5-g azithromycin regimen developed 
selected resistance [11]. Horner et al’s meta-analysis excluded 
56 cases treated with 1.5 g azithromycin that had previously 
received doxycycline and, interestingly, there were no cases of 
selected resistance among these [4]. As the proportion of cases 
with selected resistance in our study (2.6%) is not significantly 
lower than any of these estimates, we cannot determine to what 
extent the low rate in our study is due to the doxycycline vs the 
increased dose and duration of azithromycin.
Outcomes in the doxycycline-azithromycin arm also depend 
upon the sensitivity of the PCR test for detecting resistance 
mutations. In this study, 1 of the 4 azithromycin treatment fail-
ures was found to be macrolide resistant when the pretreatment 
sample was sequenced. Therefore, false-negative results from 
the resistance PCR assay may account for some failures of azith-
romycin in cases thought to be macrolide susceptible. Published 
evaluations of the ResistancePlus assay have varied in their 
methods, likely explaining some variation in reported sensitiv-
ity, but false-negative results do occur [21, 26, 27]. Clinicians 
should be aware of this limitation, particularly when confronted 
by unexpectedly macrolide-susceptible cases such as after azith-
romycin treatment failure.
The outcomes in the doxycycline-sitafloxacin arm appear 
better than expected given that ParC fluoroquinolone-associ-
ated resistance mutations were found in 12 of 60 (20% [95% CI, 
8.4%–20.4%]) of all macrolide-resistant M. genitalium infec-
tions at MSHC in 2012–2013 [17]. Four years later we would 
therefore expect moxifloxacin to fail in at least 20% of patients 
in the macrolide-resistant group. However, the sequential dox-
ycycline-sitafloxacin regimen failed in a significantly lower pro-
portion 7.8% (95% CI, 4.2%–12.9%) of infections (P = .010). 
Sequencing is under way to determine the prevalence of ParC 
and GyrA resistance mutations in this group and to identify 
mutations associated with sitafloxacin failure.
It appears likely that doxycycline pretreatment contributed 
to the relatively high efficacy (92%–95%) of antibiotics in this 
study population. Lower bacterial load predicts treatment suc-
cess with macrolides and pristinamycin, and we observed a 
significant 2.6-log fall in M. genitalium load among men with 
NGU after 7 days of doxycycline [11, 13, 20]. Further research 
with controls is required to determine the impact of doxycy-
cline pretreatment on fluoroquinolone failure and whether 
sequential or simultaneous treatment is more effective.
There are important limitations in the ability of this study to 
determine treatment efficacy. First, the intervention has multi-
ple components, which were not implemented separately. We 
cannot therefore disentangle the effect of doxycycline prem-
acrolide from the higher dose of azithromycin in improving 
cure and reducing selection of macrolide resistance. Further 
research is required to establish the contribution of each com-
ponent to improved cure. However, given current unacceptable 
failure rates with recommended regimens, this approach pro-
vides an interim measure to combine with monitoring of treat-
ment outcomes until further data become available. We also 
cannot determine if sitafloxacin is superior to moxifloxacin in 
this population, as suggested by in vitro data. Second, there is 
no control group in this study. However, the controlled trials 
of treatments for PID and NGU were not adequately powered 
to assess efficacy for M. genitalium because it causes a minority 
of cases in these syndromes. Randomized trials of treatments 
specific for M. genitalium have not been conducted, in part 
because diagnosis is usually delayed until after syndromic ther-
apy is commenced. The absence of controls means that it is even 
more important to exclude individuals with a high risk of rein-
fection from the analysis of treatment efficacy. While self-report 
is not considered highly reliable, we observed increased treat-
ment failures only in the group with the highest reported risk of 
reinfection, suggesting that this is a valid measure. All patients 
reporting this level of risk were excluded, removing any bias 
toward a favorable result. Finally, the effect of doxycycline on 
bacterial load was only measured in men with NGU and it may 
not be the same in other sites of infection or in asymptomatic 
infection.
Replacing azithromycin with doxycycline for the initial 
treatment of STI syndromes, and increasing the dose of azi-
thromycin, appears to increase proportions cured and to 
reduce selection of macrolide-resistant mutants. The increased 
dose of azithromycin was well tolerated. Furthermore, resis-
tance-guided treatment enables continued use of the cheaper 
and safer azithromycin for macrolide-susceptible infections. 
As the prevalence of macrolide resistance rises, there are fewer 
opportunities to use azithromycin. However, this study indi-
cates the potential benefits of resistance-guided treatment, 
and future assays detecting quinolone resistance will refine 
treatment approaches and improve outcomes [28]. Studies of 
sequential resistance-guided therapy using doxycycline fol-
lowed by moxifloxacin are under way. Point-of-care assays for 
M. genitalium with resistance outputs are also in development 
and, when combined with point-of-care testing for chlamydia 
and gonorrhea, will enable a shift from syndromic management 
to resistance-guided etiologic treatment [28]. These assays will 
allow randomization for studies to occur before treatment

commences, facilitating controlled trials of M. genitalium 
treatments. While resistance-guided treatment currently cures 
≥92% of M. genitalium infections, this requires a later-gener-
ation fluoroquinolone with the cost and potential side effects 
this entails. These risks should be considered before patients are 
tested for M. genitalium.
