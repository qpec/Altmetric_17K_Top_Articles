Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of viral respiratory tract infections, and are associated
with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals and patients with pre-existing
pulmonary conditions. The therapeutic options available are extremely limited and therefore novel therapeutics
for HRV infections are of significant interest. Cathelicidins have been shown to have potent antiviral activity
against a range of pathogens and are known to be key immunomodulatory mediators during infection. We
therefore assessed the antiviral potential of cathelicidins from humans and other mammalian species against
HRV, together with the potential for the human cathelicidin to modulate apoptotic pathways and alter cell
viability during HRV infection. We demonstrate that LL-37, the porcine cathelicidin Protegrin-1, and the ovine
cathelicidin SMAP-29 display potent antiviral activity towards HRV and that this activity is visible when either
the virus is exposed to the peptides prior to cell infection or after cells have been infected. We further de-
monstrate that, in contrast to established findings with bacterial infection models, LL-37 does not induce
apoptosis or necrosis in HRV-infected lung epithelial cells at physiological or superphysiological concentrations,
but does reduce the metabolic activity of infected cells compared to uninfected cells treated with similar peptide
concentrations. Collectively, the findings from this study demonstrate that the mechanism of action of cathe-
licidins against rhinovirus is by directly affecting the virus and we propose that the delivery of exogenous
cathelicidins, or novel synthetic analogues, represent an exciting and novel therapeutic strategy for rhinovirus
infection.
1. Introduction
Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of viral
respiratory tract infections and are associated with significant mor-
bidity and mortality in young children, in the elderly, in im-
munocompromised individuals, and in patients with pre-existing pul-
monary conditions [1]. HRVs have historically been associated with
relatively benign upper respiratory tract infections (i.e. the common
cold). However, studies have recently provided clear evidence of the
major role that rhinoviruses can play in triggering exacerbations of
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [2,3], in causing
severe bronchiolitis in infants and children [4,5], as well as pneumonia
[6]. There are no current specific effective treatments for HRV infec-
tion, and prevention by vaccination has thus far been shown to be al-
most impossible due to the fact that there have been more than 100
circulating serotypes of HRV identified [7]. The therapeutic options
available are predominantly supportive and are only applicable for mild
upper respiratory infections, however, for serious respiratory infections
in immunocompromised individuals there are no efficient treatments
available. The development of specific effective therapies for HRV in-
fections is therefore an urgent requirement.
Cationic Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) constitute a major compo-
nent of the innate immune system and can be found in a variety of life-
forms, contributing to the first-line of defense against invading patho-
gens. The sole human cathelicidin, a cationic antimicrobial peptide of
18 kDa called hCAP-18, is encoded by the CAMP gene and is expressed
in a variety of cell types including neutrophils, macrophages and epi-
thelial cells. The precursor peptide hCAP-18 is cleaved in to its active
form, LL-37, by extracellular proteinase-3 [8] and while concentrations
of approximately 5 μg/ml have been detected in bronchoalveolar la-
vage (BAL) fluid in healthy infants [9], concentrations of LL-37 can rise
to ∼30 μg/ml in the BAL fluid of patients with respiratory infection, or
with cystic fibrosis (CF) [10]. Cathelicidins have been shown to mod-
ulate innate and adaptive immunity, predominantly mediated through
their interaction with cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells and T
cells [11–13]. Cathelicidin knockout mouse-models show an increased

 susceptibility to bacterial infections of the skin, lung, urinary tract, and
gastrointestinal tract which confirms the crucial role of cathelicidins in
the immune response to bacterial infections [14,15].
We have previously shown that LL-37 displays potent antiviral ac-
tivity against the respiratory pathogen, influenza A virus (IAV) both in
vitro and in vivo [16], and several other studies have revealed a role for
LL-37 in defence against a variety of other viral pathogens including
Respiratory
Syncytial
Virus
(RSV),
dengue
virus,
Human
Im-
munodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), vaccinia
virus and Adenovirus [17–24]. In addition, we and others have shown
that cathelicidins from other mammalian sources such as murine
(mCRAMP),
porcine
(Protegrin-1),
ovine
(SMAP-29)
and
bovine
(BMAP-28, indolicidin) have direct antiviral activity against these
human pathogens and other emerging pathogens, including Dengue
virus [16,20,22,25–28] (Reviewed in detail in [29]). It has also recently
been demonstrated that vitamin D-mediated upregulation of cathe-
licidin in human bronchial cells from CF patients resulted in reduced
HRV load in vitro, and that treating cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial
cells with LL-37 (20 μg/ml) post-infection resulted in a significant re-
duction in viral replication, although the underlying mechanism re-
mains unclear [30].
In addition to their direct antimicrobial and antiviral activity, ca-
thelicidins have also been shown to have a potent capacity for altering
inflammatory cytokine responses and apoptotic pathways in healthy
and infected cells [31–35], at physiological, and inflammatory, con-
centrations. We have previously shown that LL-37 is capable of en-
hancing the apoptosis of infected airway epithelial cells, together with
inducing rapid secondary necrosis in apoptotic neutrophils. Ad-
ditionally, the porcine cathelicidin, Protegrin-1, has been shown to
induce necrosis in U937 tumor cells, and Ca2+-dependent necrotic cell
death in human K562 erythroleukemia cells [36,37]. While the un-
derlying mechanisms for the cathelicidin-mediated induction of ne-
crotic cell death or apoptosis in a number of cell types remains to be
fully established, it is a clear indicator of the immunomodulatory po-
tential of cathelicidins, the role of which in viral infection remain to be
understood.
Due to the potent antiviral activity of cathelicidins and their ability
to modulate the immune system, along with the urgent need to develop
specific effective antiviral treatments against rhinovirus, this study in-
vestigates the antiviral activity of the human cathelicidin, LL-37, to-
gether with cathelicidins from ovine (SMAP-29) and porcine (Protegrin-
1) sources against HRV in in vitro models of infection. In addition, we
also investigate the underlying antiviral and cell-based mechanisms of
the anti-HRV activity displayed by LL-37 in order to more clearly un-
derstand the direct and indirect antiviral capacity of cathelicidins in
HRV infection. We show that the human cathelicidin, LL-37, together
with the porcine and ovine cathelicidins Protegrin-1 and SMAP-29,
display potent antiviral activity against HRV, through a mechanism
distinct from the induction of apoptosis.

2.1. Reagents
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), Eagle’s minimal es-
sential medium (E-MEM), L-glutamine, Foetal bovine serum (FBS), non-
essential
amino
acids
(NEAA),
PBS,
trypsin/EDTA,
BSA,
and
Fibronectin were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK. Vectashield
Hardset
mounting
medium
with
49,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole
(DAPI) was supplied by Vector Laboratories, UK. CellTiter96 Aqueous
Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) and CytoTox 96 Non-
Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (LDH) were supplied by Promega, UK.
The Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated Deoxyuridine
Triphosphate Nick-End Labelling (TUNEL) Assay was supplied by Roche
Applied Science. Reconstituted peptide masses were characterised by
MALDI-TOF analysis (Proteomics Facility Moredun Research Institute,
UK).
2.2. Peptide synthesis
The peptides were assembled using the Fmoc/tBu solid-phase pep-
tide synthesis approach [38] using either model 433A (Applied Bio-
systems, CA, USA) or model Liberty (CEM Corporation, NC, USA) au-
tomated peptide synthesizers followed by cleavage in the trifluoroacetic
acid
(TFA)/phenol/thioanisole/ethanedithiol/water
(10:0.75:0.5:
0.25:0.5, w/w) mixture at 25 °C for 90 min followed by precipitation
with cold diethyl ether. The crude peptides were purified by pre-
parative reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-
HPLC). The peptide purity (> 98%) was confirmed by analytical RP-
HPLC, and the masses were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Following
lyophilization, the purified peptides were obtained in the form of their
TFA
salts;
namely:
LL-37
(LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIV
QRIKDFLRNLVPRTES), LL-37 analog having “scrambled” sequence
(RSLEGTDRFPFVRLKNSRKLEFKDIKGIKREQFVKIL),
termed
sLL-37
(control
peptide).
Since
porcine
Protegrin-1
(PG-1;
RG-
GRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR −amide) was obtained in its reduced form, its
two disulfide bridges, connecting Cys-6 and Cys-15, and Cys-8 and Cys-
13, were formed by air oxidation of the HPLC purified, all-reduced
peptide. SMAP-29 was synthesized in the same way as described above
for LL-37. All peptides were dissolved in endotoxin-free ultrapure water
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and stored at −20 °C until use.
2.3. Respiratory epithelial cell culture
The WI-38 human fetal embryonic lung fibroblast cell line was
purchased from the Public Health England (PHE) Culture Collection,
Salisbury, UK, and cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (E-
MEM), supplemented with 1%
L-glutamine (v/v), 1% non-essential
amino acids (v/v), 1% streptomycin/penicillin (v/v) and 10% fetal
bovine serum (v/v). The A549 adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal
epithelial cells were provided by Edinburgh Napier University. Cells
were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 1% L-glutamine (v/v), 1%
non-essential amino acids (v/v), 1% streptomycin/penicillin (v/v) and
10% fetal bovine serum (v/v). WI-38 cells and A549 were cultured at
37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
2.4. Virus propagation
Human Rhinovirus strain 1B (RV1B) was purchased from the
National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV) of Public Health
England Virus Collection, Salisbury, UK. HRV was propagated in the
Hela and WI-38 cell line by infecting cells in serum-free DMEM for 2 h
at 33 °C. The inoculum was then removed and cells were incubated for
24–48 h in low serum media (5% FBS supplemented DMEM). WI-38
cells were then frozen at −20 °C for 3 h and virus was harvested by
freezing and thawing the cells and subsequently centrifuging at
14,000 × g and recovering the supernatant, which was subsequently
frozen and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use.
2.5. Viral titer assessment (TCID50)
A TCID50 assay was used to determine the infectious titer of rhi-
novirus. In order to determine the virus titer of the virus stocks, WI-38
cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured overnight. Ten-fold
serial dilutions of the original virus stock were made using serum-free
media and subsequently added to the cells which were then incubated
for 1 h at 33 °C. Following incubation, the inoculum was removed and
cells were cultured in 5% media (v/v) for a period of 5 days before
analysis. TCID50 was subsequently determined using the Reed-Muench
method [39]. The same procedure was repeated in A549 epithelial cells.
For experimental assessment of the antiviral effects of cathelicidins
(human LL-37, scrambled LL-37, ovine SMAP-29, or porcine PG-1), WI-

 38 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 per well in a 96-well plate and cultured
overnight. Rhinovirus (stock titer of 5.2 × 108 TCID50) was exposed to
varying concentrations of cathelicidins for 2 h at 33 °C. After 2 h in-
cubation, 10-fold serial dilutions of the HRV-peptide mixture were
prepared. Cell media was aspirated and the serial dilutions of the
peptide/virus mixture were used to infect WI-38 cells for 1 h. After 1 h
the inoculum was removed and cells were cultured in low-serum (5% v/
v) media and incubated for a period of 5 days at 33 °C before de-
termining the virus titer by TCID50 assay.
2.6. Molecular quantitation of viral infectivity
To assess viral infectivity following cathelicidin exposure, an in vitro
infection model was employed. Briefly, A549 cells were grown to
confluency overnight in a 12 well plate incubated at 37 °C and were
subsequently subjected to two different treatment approaches. For ap-
proach 1) HRV was exposed to peptide for 1 h prior to infection of
confluent A549 cells at an MOI of 1 for 1 h. Cells were then washed
with PBS, and re-immersed in low-serum (5% v/v) complete DMEM.
For approach 2), cells were infected with serum-free media containing
HRV at an MOI of 1 for 2 h, and subsequently washed with PBS, before
re-immersion in DMEM containing 1% (v/v) Ultroser G with LL-37
(0–30 μg/ml) and incubated for 22 h at 33 °C. Media was aspirated and
ice cold PBS was added to each well. Cells were scraped from the sur-
face of the plate with a cell-scraper, and cell suspension was harvested
and centrifuged at 230 × g for 5 min. Supernatant was aspirated and
cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until extraction. Total RNA extraction
was performed by resuspending cell pellets in situ in RLT buffer from
RNeasy® mini kits (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and collecting lysate into
sterile DNase/RNase free tubes. Once samples were lysed, RNA was
extracted from the lysates using the RNeasy® mini kit system following
manufacturers protocols. RNA integrity was determined using an
Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent, UK), where RIN ≥ 8 was used as a quality
filter for further downstream analyses. Viral RNA was quantified using
a Genesig Human Rhinovirus (all subtypes) qPCR kit (Primer Design)
according to manufacturer’s protocol.
2.7. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) quantification and MTS assay
The LDH assay was performed using the LDH cytotoxicity detection
kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Metabolic
activity was assessed by use of the CellTiter96
Aqueous Non-
Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay) (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, A549 cells were seeded at
2 × 104 per well in a 96-well plate and cultured overnight at 37 °C.
Cells were infected with HRV at an MOI of 10 (with or without LL-37).
Cells were also incubated with peptide alone. After incubation of cells
with HRV and/or peptide at 33 °C, supernatant was aspirated and LDH
activity was measured. Cells were resuspended in DMEM containing
MTS reagent and metabolic conversion of MTS reagent was assessed
after 2 h by measuring the optical density at 595 nm. Controls included
untreated cells as negative control, and cells treated with Triton-X as
positive control for reduction in metabolic activity.
2.8. Flow cytometric analysis
A549 cells were grown to confluency at 37 °C, and infected with
serum-free media containing HRV at an MOI of 1 for 2 h, and subse-
quently washed with PBS, before re-immersion in DMEM containing 1%
(v/v) Ultroser G with LL-37 (0–30 μg/ml) and incubated for 22 h at
33 °C. Media containing virus and peptide was aspirated and replaced
with Trypsin/EDTA solution and incubated for 5 min to detach the cells
from the surface of the plate. Trypsin activity was neutralised via the
addition of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS and cells were subse-
quently centrifuged at 230 × g for 5 min and supernatant was dis-
carded. Cells were resuspended in 2mls of annexin V binding buffer and
a wash step was repeated twice. Finally, cells were resuspended in 2mls
of binding buffer containing FITC-labeled annexin V (BD Pharmigen,
Oxford, UK) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min.
Cells were once again centrifuged to remove FITC-annexin V, and
subsequently resuspended in binding buffer before analysis by flow
cytometry. Immediately prior to analysis, 5 μl of μg/ml propidium io-
dide was added to cells.
2.9. TUNEL assay
A549 cells (3 × 105) were grown in the apical compartment of
Transwell®
polycarbonate-permeable
supports
(pore
size
0.4 μm,
Corning Life Sciences) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After cells had adhered to
the membrane, the media in both compartments was aspirated and
replaced with DMEM containing 1% (v/v) Ultroser G and LL-37 at
varying concentrations (0–50 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of
HRV (MOI 10). Cells were incubated for 6 h at 33 °C and 5% CO2. Cells
were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (3.7% formaldehyde)
for 10 min, then washed once in PBS. Cells were then permeabilised in
ice cold 0.1% Triton X-100/0.1% sodium citrate for 3 min and washed
twice with PBS. An in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied
Science, UK) was used to label cells according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Transwell membranes were excised with a scalpel and
mounted on a glass slide in 50 μl Vectashield Hardset (containing
DAPI). At least four random fields of view were counted, each con-
taining more than 80 cells. The total number of DAPI-positive nuclei
was assessed for each treatment to evaluate total cell number and the
number of TUNEL-positive cells is expressed as a percentage of the total
number of DAPI-positive nuclei.
3. Results
3.1. LL-37 has direct antiviral effects against rhinovirus and reduces
replication in airway epithelial cells
To determine if the human cathelicidin LL-37 has direct antiviral
activity against HRV in an in vitro model of infection, two experimental
approach were used to distinguish between the direct effects of LL-37
on the virus, or cell-mediated effects of the peptide on viral replication.
Human rhinovirus (strain RV1B) was incubated with varying con-
centrations of exogenous LL-37 peptide (0–50 μg/ml) for 2 h prior to
infection of human lung epithelial (WI-38) cells (Fig. 1A), or cells were
exposed to LL-37 (0–50 μg/ml) during active HRV infection (Fig. 1B).
For the virus pre-treatment regimen, following serial dilutions of the
peptide/virus mixture, the virus titer in cell supernatants following
peptide treatment was quantified by TCID50 assay 5 days post infection.
It was found that, irrespective of treatment approach, LL-37 sig-
nificantly reduced the HRV titer only at the highest concentration of
peptide tested. We also assessed toxicity of the LL-37 peptide towards
WI-38 in this context and found that no toxicity was observed at doses
of LL-37 that were found to be antiviral (50 μg/ml) (Fig. 1C). We did,
however, identify a statistically significant reduction in the metabolic
activity of the cells at 100 μg/ml of LL-37.
After determining that superphysiological concentrations of exo-
genous LL-37 were able to reduce the HRV-mediated cytopathic effects
and thus total viable viral particles, we wanted to address whether LL-
37 was able to reduce HRV RNA copy number. HRV was incubated with
either a vehicle control (0 μg/ml), or an inflammatory concentration of
LL-37 (30 μg/ml) prior to infection of A549 alveolar epithelial cells.
Alternatively, HRV-infected cells were treated with physiologically
normal or inflammatory, concentrations of LL-37 at 2 h post infection
with virus. After a further 22 h, cells were harvested, RNA isolated and
viral RNA was quantified using an HRV-specific qPCR kit. LL-37 pre-
treatment (30 μg/ml) of virus resulted in a statistically significant re-
duction in viral copy number compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 2A).
In addition, it was found that this concentration of LL-37, but not

 10 μg/ml, elicited a statistically significant reduction in viral copies
detected when a post infection treatment approach was employed
(Fig. 2B). A control peptide with identical amino acid composition but
scrambled sequence was also employed in order to determine the im-
portance of sequence specificity in the antiviral effects observed. HRV
was treated with 30 μg/ml of scrambled control peptide or vehicle
control for 2 h prior to infection of cells. In contrast to the reduction in
viral copy number observed when HRV was treated with 30 μg/ml LL-
37 peptide (Fig. 2A), it was found that treatment with 30 μg/ml sLL-37
did not alter viral copy number detected after treatment (Fig. 2C).
3.2. LL-37 reduces the metabolic activity of airway epithelial cells infected
with rhinovirus but does not enhance host cell apoptosis or necrosis
To evaluate the effect of LL-37 exposure on the viability of airway
epithelial cells, A549 epithelial cells, highly permissive to Rhinovirus
replication, were infected with HRV at an MOI of 10 for 2 h, prior to
treatment with LL-37 (0–100 μg/ml) for 3 h. Peptide treatments were

tivity against human rhinovirus. *Human rhinovirus was (A)
pre-incubated with cathelicidin peptide (LL-37) for 2 h prior
to infection of WI-38 cells, or (B) simultaneously exposed to
LL-37 during infection of WI-38 cells. A TCID50 assay was
subsequently performed to assess the virus titer in cells 4 days
after infection. The virus used was RV1B. Figures are re-

cells, (B) cells were infected for 2 h then washed and treated
with peptide for 22 h or (C) pre-incubated with scrambled LL-
37 (sLL-37) for 2 h prior to infection of A549 cells. The virus
used was RV1B. Viral mRNA was isolated and quantified by

dependent experiments and show total virus RNA copy

 also conducted in cells in the absence of any viral infection as control.
The mitochondrial metabolic potential of the cells was assessed by MTS
assay, and cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase release, indicative of da-
mage to the cell, was quantified. HRV infection did not result in any
significant change to cell metabolic activity or LDH release, but LL-37
did induce significant reductions in A549 cell metabolic activity at
superphysiological concentrations (50 and 100 μg/ml), and this effect
was significantly more pronounced when cells were infected with HRV
(at peptide concentrations ≥20 μg/ml) (Fig. 3A). However, there did
not appear to be any major effects on LDH release by cells (Fig. 3B).
Apoptosis of airway epithelial cells induced by LL-37 in the presence
of HRV infection was evaluated by FACS quantification of FITC-labelled
annexin V and propidium iodide staining. A549 epithelial cells were
infected with HRV at an MOI of 1 for 2 h prior to treatment with LL-37
(10 and 30 μg/ml), or camptothecin as a positive control (30 μM) for a
further 22 h. Significant increases in apoptosis or necrosis were not
observed in any of the treatment conditions utilised (Fig. 4A and B).
This data was further confirmed by assessment of nuclear DNA frag-
mentation by TUNEL assay at 6 h post infection with an MOI of 1 in the
presence and absence of LL-37 (Fig. 4C). Exposure of cells to the su-
perphysiological concentration of 50 μg/ml LL-37 resulted in a statis-
tically significant increase in cell death induced by LL-37 in both
healthy and infected cells.
3.3. Ovine and porcine cathelicidins display potent conserved antiviral
activity against human rhinovirus
To assess whether the anti-rhinovirus activity of cathelicidins was a
species-specific property, we synthesised cathelicidins from porcine
(Protegrin-1) and ovine (SMAP-29) species. Human rhinovirus (strain
RV1B) was then incubated with two concentrations of each peptide
(75–150 μg/ml) for 2 h prior to infection of human lung epithelial (WI-
38) cells. Consistent with human cathelicidin results, it was shown that
SMAP-29 and Protegrin-1 exerted direct antiviral effects on the virus,
although to a lesser extent than that exhibited by LL-37. The antiviral
effect of SMAP-29 was demonstrated at 150 μg/ml, resulting in a 70%
reduction in virus titer (Fig. 5A) although treatment with SMAP-29 at
75 μg/ml did not alter virus titer. The porcine cathelicidin Protegrin-1
exerted a direct antiviral effect at both concentrations tested, with ap-
proximately a 90% reduction in virus titer at the concentrations tested
(Fig. 5B).
4. Discussion
It is well established that cathelicidins possess broad-spectrum an-
timicrobial and antiviral activity against a wide range of bacterial and
viral pathogens. The human cathelicidin, LL-37, has been shown to
have antiviral activity against vaccinia virus, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), influenza, HIV and adenovirus, among others [16–19,21,22]. In
addition, the murine cathelicidin, mCRAMP, the ovine cathelicidin
SMAP-29 and the porcine cathelicidin, Protegrin-1, show specific an-
tiviral potential against a number of viral pathogens including vaccinia
virus, influenza, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and dengue [16,22,27,40].
Additionally, vitamin D treatment of cells isolated from CF patients led
to reduced HRV loads in vitro, and it was suggested that this effect was
mediated by upregulation of hCAP-18. This was further supported by a
reduction in virus observed after exposure of the CF cells to 20 μg/ml of
recombinant LL-37 during the HRV infection process.
In this study, we demonstrate that the human cathelicidin displays
direct antiviral activity against HRV in vitro, and that this effect was
visible when the virus was exposed to peptide prior to infection, and
when cells were treated with peptide post-infection. This is consistent
with other studies investigating the antiviral effects of LL-37 against
RSV which have revealed that LL-37 has the potential to act both di-
rectly on the virus and on the host cell, but in those instances, pre-
incubation of peptide with virus yielded the most significant antiviral
effect [18,41]. Direct antiviral activity of LL-37 has also been char-
acterised against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) type 1, a number of
adenovirus serotypes, dengue virus, vaccinia virus and influenza virus
[16,21,22,24,42]. The antiviral effect of the LL-37 peptide was de-
monstrated to be sequence specific as a scrambled LL-37 peptide with
identical amino-acid composition but with a random sequence did not
display any anti-HRV activity. This is in accord with our previous study
examining the antiviral activity of LL-37 against influenza virus, which
revealed that a scrambled LL-37 peptide did not show anti-influenza
activity, in comparison to LL-37 which exhibited potent activity against
influenza A in vitro and in vivo [16], together with other studies which
have revealed a sequence specificity for LL-37 against RSV and dengue
[18,24].
In situ hybridisation studies have revealed that airway epithelial
cells are the primary site of HRV infection and replication in the re-
spiratory tract [43], therefore these cells are the preferred target for
antiviral therapeutics aimed at combating established HRV infections.
In order to establish if the reduction in HRV replication in airway
epithelium induced by LL-37 that we observed could be attributed to
induction of death in the host cell, we assessed mitochondrial metabolic
activity and cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase release by healthy and
HRV-infected host cells following peptide treatment. It was revealed
that following HRV infection, there was a significant reduction in cell
metabolic activity at lower concentrations of LL-37 (≤30 μg/ml) in
infected cells, compared to healthy cells which did not show any al-
teration of metabolic activity until ≥50 μg/ml LL-37 was applied. In-
terestingly, there was no significant increase in LDH from the cytosol in
HRV-infected cells at any LL-37 concentration tested, although 100 μg/
ml of LL-37 in healthy cells did induce a significant increase in LDH
released from cells, suggesting a cytotoxic effect only at the highest
Fig. 3. LL-37 reduces the metabolic activity of airway epithelial cells infected with rhi-
novirus but does not induce host cell necrosis. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were
infected with human rhinovirus (strain RV1B) for 2 h prior to treatment with the ca-
thelicidin LL-37 (0–100 μg/ml) for 6 h. (A) Cell metabolic activity, indicative of viability,
was assessed by MTS assay and (B) cytotoxic release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) was assessed by LDH assay. Figures are representative of three independent ex-
periments and represent mean absorbance values ± SEM. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using one-way ANOVA to compare LL-37 treated samples with negative control
(0) in the presence and absence of virus (** P ≤ 0.01, *** P ≤ 0.001).

 concentration. While decreased metabolic activity could be associated
with increased cytotoxicity due to membrane damage, a lack of cyto-
toxicity at LL-37 concentrations < 50 μg/ml in healthy cells is con-
sistent with previous studies [21]. This data could indicate that the
antiviral effects exhibited by LL-37 may not just be attributable to direct
effects on the virus, but via a depression of the metabolic activity of the
host cell. However, while our previous studies demonstrated a role for
LL-37 in the rapid induction of necrosis in apoptotic neutrophils [32],
this data suggests that increased susceptibility to necrosis induced by
LL-37 is not exhibited in airway cells infected with HRV. Despite this, it
is clear that mitochondrial specific cytotoxic effects of LL-37 resulting
in reduced metabolic capacity in these cell types may be enhanced
during infection, as we and others have indicated a role for LL-37 in
inducing or enhancing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in healthy
and infected cells [31,44,45].
Previously, it was shown that physiological concentrations of LL-37
could enhance the apoptotic cell death in airway epithelial cells in-
fected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [31], and thus the induction of
apoptotic cell death by LL-37 in HRV-infected cells could represent a
potential mechanism for peptide-mediated impairment of viral re-
plication. In this context, we used Annexin V/P.I. staining, in tandem
with TUNEL labelling for apoptosis specific DNA fragmentation and, in
contrast to observations using bacterial infection, the data indicate that
apoptosis was not induced by LL-37 in HRV-infected cells. Thus, in-
duction of apoptosis did likely not represent the mechanism by which
the viral loads were reduced by LL-37, and therefore the direct antiviral
activity of the peptide was responsible. However, our previous studies
have revealed that LL-37 does possess the capacity to alter in-
flammatory responses in murine models of influenza infection in vivo,
and thus cathelicidin mediated alteration of inflammatory cytokine
secretion in viral infection should be explored in future studies. This is
particularly relevant in the context of HRV infection which has been
demonstrated to induce upregulation of multiple proinflammatory cy-
tokine/chemokine genes together with IFN-β secretion in the murine
and human lung [2,46,47], leading to severe exacerbations of COPD
and asthma. While the induction of inflammation may have a sig-
nificant role to play in the host antiviral response against this infection,
controlled attenuation of the inflammation by cathelicidins in the
context of airway disease exacerbation may prove to be of important
therapeutic value.
Cathelicidins from other mammalian species have been shown to
display potent antimicrobial capacity against a range of human pa-
thogens. The porcine β-sheet cathelicidin, Protegrin-1, has been shown
to have antiviral activity against Dengue virus, lentivirus and HIV
[27,48–50], but lacks antiviral activity against influenza virus [16]. The
ovine cathelicidin, SMAP-29, has previously been shown to have anti-
bacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among others,
together with activity against Cryptococcus and Candida species [51],
although its antiviral activity has yet to be established. To examine
whether the antiviral activity of cathelicidins was species-specific, we
synthesised both of these peptides and assessed their direct antiviral
Fig. 4. LL-37 does not modulate apoptotic cell death pathways in airway epithelial cells infected with human rhinovirus. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected with
Rhinovirus (strain RV1B) and treated with a range of LL-37 concentrations for (A)6 h or (B) 24 h. (A) Cells were fixed and apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. Three random fields of
view, each containing more than 100 cells, were counted for each sample, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was expressed as a percentage of the number of DAPI-positive nuclei.
(B) Cells were stained with Annexin V-Fluos and Propidium Iodide (PI) and the percentage of cell population that was either AV + PI- (early apoptosis) or AV + PI+ (late apoptosis) was
categorized as apoptotic. Data represent mean values ± SEM, for n = 3 independent experiments for each condition (*** P ≤ 0.001 compared to control treatment).

 activity against HRV. Protegrin-1 displayed potent antiviral activity at
both concentrations tested, with SMAP-29 displaying direct antiviral
activity but to a lesser extent. This suggests that anti-HRV capacity is a
conserved activity of cathelicidins from different sources, and that this
family of peptides possesses direct antiviral capacity.
5. Conclusions
In summary, this study demonstrates that the human cathelicidin
LL-37, together with ovine and porcine cathelicidins, display powerful
and direct antiviral activity against HRV. Our data indicate that this is
mediated by direct activity against the virion, rather than by induction
of apoptotic or necrotic cell death in the host airway cells. However, the
contribution of cathelicidins in the modulation of the host in-
flammatory response to this virus remains to be determined. Our data
suggests that exogenous prophylactic or therapeutic synthetic peptide
delivery, with design informed by cathelicidins from different mam-
malian species, could represent a key avenue for therapeutics designed
to reduce the exacerbations of serious airway conditions as a result of
infection with HRV.
