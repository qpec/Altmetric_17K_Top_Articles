Abstract
Background—Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by social communication 
deficits and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. Varied immunological findings have been 
reported in children with ASD. To address the question of heterogeneity in immune responses, we 
sought to examine the diversity of immune profiles within a representative cohort of boys with 
ASD.
Methods—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from male children with ASD (n=50) 
and from typically developing (TD) age-matched male controls (n=16) were stimulated with either 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Cytokine production was assessed after 
stimulation. The ASD study population was clustered into subgroups based on immune responses 
and assessed for behavioral outcomes.
Results—Children with ASD who had a pro-inflammatory profile based on LPS stimulation 
were more developmentally impaired as assessed by the Mullen's Scale of Early Learning 
(MSEL). They also had greater impairments in social affect as measured by the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule (ADOS). These children also displayed more frequent sleep disturbances 
and episodes of aggression. Similarly, children with ASD and a more activated T cell cytokine 
profile after PHA stimulation were more developmentally impaired as measured by the MSEL.
Conclusions—Children with ASD may be phenotypically characterized based upon their 
immune profile. Those showing either a pro-inflammatory response or increased T cell activation/

activated immune profiles. These data suggest that there may be several possible immune 
subphenotypes within the ASD population that correlate with more severe behavioral impairments.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterized by stereotyped interests, repetitive behaviors and impairments in social 
communication. Currently 1 in 68 children have been identified as having ASD (1, 2). 
Despite the high prevalence of ASD, the etiology(ies) and pathogenesis remain poorly 
understood. Numerous published findings have identified widespread differences in the 
immune systems of children with ASD, both at the systemic and cellular levels (3). These 
differences have been associated with impairments in the core features of ASD as well as 
other aberrant behaviors, decreased adaptability and more impaired cognition in children 
with ASD (4, 5). Neuroimmune interactions begin during early neurodevelopment and 
continue throughout life, with the immune system supporting many aspects of neuronal 
function. Dysregulation in the immune system could increase sensitivity to altered 
neurologic function from a variety of sources, particularly during early development (6). 
Importantly, altered immune function in the brain of individuals with ASD is suggested by 
evidence of neuroglial activation and neuroinflammation in the CNS (7), as well as the 
presence of antibodies reactive to neuronal tissue (8-12) in a subset of children with ASD. 
These immune differences may be related to numerous genetic associations linked with 
immune functions in ASD, such as linkages to the major histocompatibility complex (HLA) 
genes (13-15).Consequently, research that identifies the biological basis of the immune 
dysfunction in children with autism may facilitate early detection, prevention and/or 
treatment.
Among the immunological findings in ASD, reports of increased pro-inflammatory markers 
remain the most consistently observed. These include increased levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6, and chemokines such as MCP-1, in plasma, 
cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and post mortem brain tissue (4, 16-19). As noted, many of these 
studies highlight a connection between immune dysregulation and more impaired behaviors 
(5). These findings suggest a pro-inflammatory immune profile is prevalent within the ASD 
population, or at least in a subgroup of the population, where immune activation may be 
linked to more impaired behavioral symptomology.
In this study we utilize a cohort of children which consists of children primarily from 
Northern California with a broad presentation of ASD severity and extent of comorbid 
features along with age- and geographically matched typically developing (TD) controls. We 
hypothesized that within this well-defined cohort of children, a subgroup could be identified 
based on immune function that would be associated with a characteristic behavioral profile.

 To determine this relationship, children in the study received a battery of cognitive and 
behavioral assessments along with a number of physiological measures including 
neurological and immunological evaluations. Immune measures were used to cluster 
children into subgroups and behaviors were assessed between resulting groups.
Material and Methods
Subjects
Participants were enrolled through the Autism Phenome Project (APP) study conducted at 
UC Davis M.I.N.D. institute. The study protocols including recruitment and behavioral 
assessments have been previously described in detail (20, 21). Because of the gender 
disparities in ASD, we choose to focus on males to eliminate issues of gender differences. In 
brief, following clinical evaluation for diagnostic confirmation, participants were placed in 
one of two groups: (1) children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD [N=50, median age 3.21 
(interquartile range 2.80–3.52)] years; or (2) children who were confirmed as typically 
developing (TD) controls [N=16, 2.80 (2.47-3.14)] years. Final diagnosis of ASD was 
confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (22) and the Autism 
Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (23). The ADOS and ADI-R consists of a 
standardized, semi-structured interview and a diagnostic algorithm from the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IVTR) (24), 
with definitions of autism from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10) (25). Inclusion criteria for the TD children included scores on the Lifetime Edition 
of the Social Communication Questionnaire (26), a screening tool for ASD, below the 
recommended screening cutoff for young children of 11 and developmental scores within 2 
standard deviations of the mean on all subscales of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning 
(MSEL) (27). Exclusion criteria for TD controls included a diagnosis of intellectual 
disability, pervasive developmental disorder, or specific language impairment, or any known 
developmental, neurological, or genetic disorder. The TD controls were recruited through 
interactions with school districts and other outreach mechanisms. The exclusion criteria for 
all subjects consisted of the presence of Fragile X syndrome or other serious neurological 
(e.g., seizures), psychiatric (e.g., bipolar disorder), or known medical conditions including 
autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. The administration of all 
diagnostic instruments was carried out by experienced clinicians at the MIND Institute.
All children enrolled in the study were assessed for developmental performance using 
MSEL. The MSEL has components for visual reception, fine motor, receptive language and 
expressive language. Standardized developmental quotients (DQs) were calculated for each 
subscale of the MSEL by dividing each child's age-equivalent score by their chronological 
age at the time of testing and multiplying by 100 in order to provide a consistent metric for 
cognitive measures and to accommodate floor effects. The Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBCL) (28) was provided by parents of children in the study and consists of questions 
designed to measure behavioral issues in children, including sleep, hyperactivity, and 
aggression.
Participant groups did not differ significantly for age. All children were free of any major 
immune modifying medications and in good health and free of fever (temperature <

 100.5°F) at the time of blood draw. All participants were native English speakers, 
ambulatory, and had no suspected vision or hearing problems. All subjects were screened via 
parental interview for current and past physical illness. This study was approved by the 
institutional review boards at the University of California, Davis. Informed consent was 
obtained prior to participation.
Cell isolation
Peripheral blood (8.5 ml) was collected in an acid-citrate-dextrose Vacutainer tube (BD 
Biosciences; San Jose, CA) and processed within 12 hours of collection. Blood was 
centrifuged for 10 min at 2300 rpm, and plasma was drawn off and stored at −80°C. The 
blood pellet was mixed 1:1 with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Gibco, Gaithersburg, 
MD) without Ca2+ or Mg2+. The diluted blood was then layered, carefully, over a Ficoll-
Paque gradient (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and centrifuged at 1,700 rpm for 30 
minutes at room temperature. PBMC were then harvested from the interface layer and 
washed twice with HBSS. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were 
then re-suspended at a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL in tissue culture medium 
consisting of: RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% low endotoxin heat inactivated 
fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific; Tarzana, CA), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 IU/ml 
streptomycin (Sigma, St Louis, MO).
Cellular Stimulations
Isolated PBMC were stimulated for 48 hours in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS, Gibco), 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin alone or with the addition of either 1.0 
μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) 
or 8 μg/mL Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma) and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2. After 
this period, cells were collected and spun at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatants were 
collected and stored at −80°C until analyzed by Luminex multiplexing technology. 48 hours 
stims were used to relate this work to previous work by our group.
Luminex multiplex analysis
Supernatants from LPS stimulated cultures were quantified for GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, 
IL-12(p40), MCP-1(CCL2) and TNFα, and supernatants PHA stimulated cultures were 
quantified for IFNγ, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-17 using human multiplexing bead immunoassays 
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). Supernatants from media alone (unstimulated) cultures were 
analyzed as controls for the cytokines listed above. Samples were run per manufacturer 
recommendations. Specifically, 25μL of supernatant was incubated with antibody-coupled 
beads. After a series of washes, a biotinylated detection antibody was added to the beads, 
and the reaction mixture was detected by the addition of streptavidin–phycoerythrin. The 
bead sets were analyzed using a flow-based Luminex™ 100 suspension array system (Bio-
Plex 200; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Unknown sample cytokine concentrations were 
calculated by Bio-Plex Manager software using a standard curve derived from the known 
reference cytokine concentrations supplied by the manufacturer. A five-parameter model was 
used to calculate final concentrations and values are expressed in pg/ml. The sensitivity of 
this assay allowed the detection of cytokine concentrations with the following limits of 
detection: IFNγ (4.0 pg/mL), GM-CSF (2.3 pg/mL), IL-1β (0.7 pg/mL), IL-6 (0.4 pg/mL),

 IL-10 (0.3 pg/mL), IL-12p40 (12.3 pg/mL), IL-13 (0.3 pg/mL), IL-17 (0.4 pg/mL), MCP-1 
(1.2 pg/mL) and TNFα (0.2 pg/mL). Values below the limit of detection (LOD) were 
replaced with one-half the LOD. Supernatant aliquots were thawed only once.
Cluster Analysis
Cluster analysis was performed using a k-medians algorithm using a Euclidean dissimilarity 
measure on all children, including both children with ASD and TD, in the study. Based on 
previous observations in the literature (Reviewed in 5), a number of cytokines associated 
with inflammatory or T cell processes, previously reported as altered in ASD, were used to 
discriminate subgroups in ASD based on cytokine production after immune challenge. For 
analysis of the LPS data, the inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and TNFα 
were used as discriminating variables; for PHA-treated samples, IFNγ (TH1) and IL-13 
(TH2) were used. Two groups were assumed for the LPS data, “pro-inflammatory” verses 
“non-inflammatory”, and three groups for the PHA data, “TH1-skewed”, “TH2-skewed”, or 
“non-skewed”. Biplots for LPS data were generated using IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and 
TNFα as variables. For the PHA data, biplots were generated using IFNγ and IL-13 as 
variables. In both cases variables were standardized.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using STATA 12 software. Data was determined to be non-
parametric using the Shapiro-Wilks test for normality. The Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used 
for between subject group comparisons. A probability value (p) of less than 0.05 was 
considered to be significant.
Results
We stratified children in this study based on immunological measures using a k-median 
cluster analysis algorithm. Children with ASD were grouped into two clusters. The first 
cluster (ASDhigh; n=22) consisted of subjects whose PBMC displayed a pro-inflammatory 
response profile based on cytokine production after stimulation with LPS. The second 
cluster (ASDlow; n=28) consisted of subjects who displayed a less robust response to LPS 
(Figure 1A). Children in the ASDhigh group displayed significantly increased production of 
IL-1β [1,465.7 (1,115.9-2,028.2) pg/mL vs. 994.3 (558.1-1,668.1) pg/mL; p = 0.04], IL-6 
[4,060.5 (3,061.7-5,552.3) pg/mL vs. 2,768.1 (1917.2-3916.5) pg/mL; p = 0.01], IL-10 
[474.6 (358.8-734.5) pg/mL vs. 275.2 (119.0-376.0) pg/mL; p < 0.01], and MCP-1 
[22,891.9 (18,903.5-29,395.6) pg/mL vs. 8,414.1 (3,945.4-11,500.0) pg/mL; p < 0.01] when 
compared with the ASDlow group (Figure 1B-F).
Using this cluster analysis we next assessed differences in behavioral measures between the 
ASDhigh and ASDlow groups. Children in the ASDhigh group displayed more impaired 
developmental scores as measured by the MSEL including differences in verbal and non-
verbal development (Figure 2). ASD children with the more inflammatory immune profile 
also displayed more impaired social affect as measured by the social affect domain of the 
ADOS [17.5 (13.0-19.0) vs. 14.5 (12.0-16.5); p = 0.03] and a trend for increased ADOS 
severity scores, with 64% (14/22) obtaining the maximum severity score of 10 in the

 ASDhigh but only 31% (9/28) in the ASDlow group attaining that score, although this did not 
reach statistical significance [10.0 (8.0-10.0) vs. 8.0 (7.0-10.0); p = 0.07] (Figure 3). A 
greater number of sleep issues [5.0 (3.0-8.0) vs. 3.0 (1.0-5.0); p = 0.04] and increased level 
of aggression [21.0 (17.0-25.0) vs. 13.0 (7.0-16.0); p < 0.01] was also reported by caregivers 
as measured by the CBCL in the ASDhigh group (Figure 4).
As the various immune cells work as a coordinated network, we sought to determine if T 
helper cell cytokines profiles could also help to elucidate immune endophenotypes in the 
ASD group. Children with ASD were placed into groups using a k-median cluster algorithm, 
with the assumption of three groups (“TH1 skewed”, “TH2 skewed”, and a “non-skewed” 
group based on cytokine responses following challenge with PHA) (Figure 5A). The TH2 
skewed group (ASDTH2) (n=12) displayed significantly more IL-13 [21.9 (15.7-48.5) pg/mL 
vs. 4.9 (0.2-8.2) pg/mL; p < 0.01], a prototypical TH2 cytokine, than the non-skewed group 
(ASDTN) (n=19), which showed neither increased production of IL-13 or IFNγ (Figure 
5B). Similarly, The TH1 skewed group (ASDTH1) (n=6) had significantly higher production 
of IFNγ, the prototypical TH1 cytokine, than the non-skewed group [93.8 (65.5-133.9) 
pg/mL vs. 1.0 (0.1-3.7) pg/mL; p <0.01] (Figure 5C).
When assessing behavioral correlates in the clustered groups based on cytokine responses to 
PHA, the ASDTH1 group displayed more developmental impairment compared to the 
ASDTN group as measured on the MSEL for developmental quotient (DQ) [45.4 (40.9-57.1) 
vs. 637 (49.3-91.2); p = 0.02], verbal developmental quotient (VDQ) [32.8 (26.7-41.4) vs. 
59.5 (35.9-80.3); p = 0.03], and non-verbal developmental quotient (NVDQ) [59.3 
(53.7-67.6) vs. 75.0 (66.1-90.0); p = 0.04] (Figure 6). The ASDTH2 group was similarly 
cognitively impaired relative to the ASDTN group and showed significantly more impaired 
cognitive scores on the MSEL, DQ [46.6 (39.4-59.1) vs. 63.7 (49.3-91.2); p < 0.01], VDQ 
[35.0 (25.0-45.5) vs. 59.5 (35.9-80.3); p = 0.02], NVDQ [61.7 (47.9-68.1) vs. 75.0 
(66.1-90.0); p < 0.01] (Figure 6).
Discussion
We have found that when children with ASD were categorized into pro-inflammatory and 
non-inflammatory groups based on the production of inflammatory related cytokines by 
their PBMC stimulated with LPS in culture, those with pro-inflammatory profiles showed 
more impaired developmental and behavioral scores, as well as increased problems with 
sleep and aggression. These children also displayed more impaired social affect, and a trend 
towards increased severity of core autism symptoms. Although the ADOS severity scores 
did not reach significance, two thirds of the children in the ASDhigh group had a maximum 
score of 10, with the others in that group near the upper limits of the scoring range, whereas 
less than a third had a maximum score in the ASDlow group. These findings are in agreement 
with previously reported findings in cultured monocytes (29) and plasma (4) from children 
with ASD that found increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were associated 
with more severe behavioral impairments.
Cytokines, pro-inflammatory ones in particular, play a number of roles in regulating 
behaviors. IL-1β and TNFα are both key messengers involved in sickness behavior during

 illness and infection, and their cross-communication with the neuroendocrine system can 
lead to social withdrawal (30, 31). In addition, regulation of IL-1β is important for proper 
neuronal function, as sustained expression of IL-1β in the hippocampus has been shown to 
impair spatial memory in mice (32), and blockage of IL-1β can alter synaptic plasticity (33). 
Regulation of TNFα is also important, as it can induce cell death in neurons and plays a role 
in synaptic pruning (34). All three of the major inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, TNFα, and 
IL-6, have a complex relationship with sleep and sleep regulation. All three are considered 
somnogenic, but are themselves also regulated by circadian rhythms through a complex 
biofeedback mechanism (35).
In addition to production of innate inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS, a number of 
studies have reported increased levels of T-cell-associated cytokines in children with ASD, 
which are associated with more impaired behaviors (36). The cytokines reported are often 
suggestive of an immune skewing towards either an allergy/asthma, TH2 (4, 16, 37), or an 
anti-microbial, TH1 (18, 19, 38, 39) profile. We did not find a clear dominance of either 
immune profile, therefore we sought to determine if T helper cell skewing to either TH1 or 
TH2 predicted differences in behavioral phenotype. For the analysis presented in this study, 
only the last 37 ASD subjects receiving the same batch of PHA were used. Subjects in the 
earliest part of the study received a separate batch of PHA and had significantly different T 
cell responses in both subjects with ASD and TD controls. We found that children with ASD 
and a TH2 immune profile showed significantly decreased developmental scores compared 
to non-cytokine skewed children; however, this disparity in developmental rate was also 
present in children with a TH1 profile when compared to non-cytokine skewed children. This 
suggests that there is perhaps a general lack of T cell regulation in some children with ASD, 
which leads to either a TH1 or TH2 skewing, and immune cell activation associated with 
alterations in behavior, such as increased developmental impairment. This would be 
consistent with an increased pro-inflammatory profile in general, rather than a specific 
allergy/asthma or cell mediated pattern of immune responses. In our previous studies (4), we 
also noted that increased inflammatory T cell cytokine profiles (e.g. TNFα) in children with 
ASD were related to more impaired behaviors.
Similar to inflammatory cytokines, TH1 and TH2 associated cytokines have a number of 
effects on behaviors. IFNγ, the archetypal TH1 cytokine, is associated with increased 
“emotionality” in mice (40) and has been shown to be elevated in patients with depression 
(41). TH2 cytokines appear to have a more beneficial function with IL-4 KO mice showing 
cognitive impairments that can be rescued by transfer of bone marrow from wild type mice 
(42). However, IL-4 is also increased in response to stress and may reflect allergic 
inflammation resulting in the increase of other pro-inflammatory cytokines (43). It should be 
noted that in this study we did not look at IL-4 cytokine production as our previous studies 
in similarly aged pediatric populations found that the production of IL-13 was a better proxy 
for TH2 skewing from PHA stimulated cultures and was more reliably and more frequently 
detected above the minimum readable levels of the Luminex assay.
While several studies have assessed immunological findings as they relate to behaviors in 
ASD, to our knowledge this is the first study to attempt an assessment of behavioral 
phenotypes in children with ASD based on functionally determined immune response

 profiles. This method of identifying subgroups within ASD, based on functional cytokine 
clustering, is less prone to technical errors than with a single analyte approach as it does no 
rely solely on the measure of a single cytokine. Assessing subjects based on an immune 
profile is also more in line with the complex nature of the immune network of interactions 
following perturbation, were individual cytokines serve multiple interconnected roles. Thus, 
a profile of multiple cytokines in response to stimulation offers a more physiologically 
relevant method to assess immune function in individuals and between groups.
Within the ASD group, there appears to be multiple immune endophenotypes. Children with 
a more pronounced response to immune stimulation, be it LPS (innate) or PHA (T cell), 
demonstrate the greatest developmental and behavioral impairments and show differences in 
core and comorbid behaviors similar to that previously described in a variety of 
immunological studies in ASD (4, 5, 44). It remains unclear if these immunological 
abnormalities are directly related to developmental and behavioral characteristics or are an 
epiphenomenon; However, the ability to describe subgroups of children with ASD based 
upon their reactivity cluster suggests that their involvement in the pathology of ASD is more 
than coincidental.
Although immune abnormalities were first described in ASD over forty years ago, no 
consensus has been reached as to what constitutes clinically significant immune dysfunction 
in ASD. Many factors such as study design, age of cases, use of siblings who often display a 
broader immune phenotype as controls, the use of adults as controls in studies of childhood 
ASD and less stringent diagnosis of ASD could contribute to a lack of accord among the 
studies of immune dysfunction in ASD. In addition, clinic based studies may introduce 
certain biases not observed in population based case-control studies. Issues with study 
design notwithstanding, the heterogeneity of ASD has been suggested to be a major 
contributor to the disparity in immune findings described to date, and presents a major issue 
in all ASD studies. Trials attempting to modulate the immune system in children with ASD 
have met with mixed results. The use of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) has resulted in 
varied results. Most children see no benefit whereas a small number reportedly display 
remarkable behavioral improvements (45, 46). The use of antibiotics to alter gut flora and 
systemic immune responses has met with similar results, with a minority of children 
experiencing benefit (47). Studies involving immune therapies in conjunction with anti-
psychotic medications, such as cox-2 inhibitors and Risperidone, have had better results; 
children receiving both therapies showed marked improvement relative to Risperidone alone 
(48). Collectively these studies suggest that immune therapies can benefit some children 
with ASD, but more stringent methodological studies are needed. Given the heterogeneity of 
ASD, there remains a great need to further elucidate immune dysfunction in children with 
the disorder, and to work towards establishing immune endophenotypes within the broader 
spectrum in order to better target current and future therapies.
We demonstrate in this study that is it is possible to characterize developmental/behavioral 
differences in children with ASD based on immune profiles. This novel method for 
categorizing children with ASD may have beneficial roles in behavioral and/or 
pharmaceutical therapy trials that may lead to the development of more individualized 
treatment recommendations based on both biological and behavioral characteristics.

 Figure 1. Cluster analysis of PBMC cytokine response to LPS
Children with ASD were clustered into two groups based on a k-medians cluster analysis 
using the inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and TNFα as measured in 
PBMC cell culture supernatants after LPS stimulation. The distribution of subjects based on 
this clustering are shown using a (A) biplot to indicate the vectors each particular cytokine 
has in discriminating the groups. Vectors points in the direction which is most like the 
variable represented by the vector. Axis represent principal complements 1 and 2. Post 
clustering analysis of cytokines production between the groups shows the ASDhigh groups 
produces significantly more (B) IL-1β (p=0.04), (C) IL-6 (p=0.01), (D) IL-10 (p<0.01), and 
(E) MCP-1 (p<0.01) than the ASDlow group. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01.

 Figure 2. Cognitive scores in ASDhigh vs. ASDlow children
Children in the ASDhigh group displayed more cognitive impairment than children in the 
ASDlow group. This was evidenced by significantly lower T-scores on the developmental 
quotient (DQ) (p=0.04) section and the non-verbal development quotient (NVDQ) (p<0.01) 
section of the MSEL. The verbal developmental quotient (VDQ) section also showed 
decreased T-scores, but this failed to reach significance (p=0.15). * p<0.05, ** p<0.01.

 Figure 3. ADOS subscale scores in ASD high vs. ASDlow children
Children in the ASDhigh group showed increased social deficits as measured by ADOS 
compared with children in the ASDlow group. In particular, children in the ASDhigh group 
had significantly increased (A) social affect issues (p=0.03). There was no evidence for 
increased (B) repetitive behaviors in this group. Overall severity (C) was higher in the 
ASDhigh group, but did not reach significance (p=0.06). * p<0.05.

 Figure 5. Cluster analysis of PBMC cytokine response to PHA
Children with ASD were clustered into three groups based on a k-medians cluster analysis 
using the T-helper associated cytokines IL-13 and IFNγ as measured in PBMC cell culture 
supernatants after PHA stimulation. The distribution of subjects based on this clustering are 
shown using a (A) biplot to indicate the vectors each particular cytokines has in 
discriminating the groups. Axis represent principal complements 1 and 2. Vectors points in 
the direction which is most like the variable represented by the vector. Post analysis of 
cytokine production between groups shows the ASDTh2 group produces significantly more 
(B) IL-13 (p<0.01) and ASDTH1 groups produces significantly more (C) IFNγ (p<0.01) 
than the ASDTH non-skewed group. ** p<0.01.

 Figure 6. Cognitive scores in children with ASD with an activated T Cell profile
Children in both the ASDTH2 and ASDTH1 groups displayed more cognitive impairment
