 Background—Obesity complicates medical, surgical, nursing and informal caregiving in severe 
illness, but the impact of obesity on hospice utilization, location of death, and Medicare 
expenditures is unknown.
Objective—To describe the associations between body mass index (BMI) and hospice utilization 
and Medicare expenditures in the last six months of life.
Design—Retrospective cohort.
Setting—The Health and Retirement Study.
Participants—5,677 community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who died 
between 1998 and 2012.
Measures—Hospice enrollment, days enrolled in hospice, in-home death, and total Medicare 
expenditures measured in the six months before death. Generalized linear models were used to 
examine the association of increasing BMI and mean predicted outcome in the four measures. 
BMI was modeled as a continuous variable with a quadratic functional form.
Results—For a decedent with BMI of 20 kg/m2, the predicted probability of hospice enrollment 
was 38.3% (95% CI, 36.5% to 40.2%), the predicted hospice duration was 42.8 days (95% CI, 
42.3 to 43.2 days), the predicted probability of in-home death was 61.3% (95% CI, 59.4% to 
63.2%), and the predicted total Medicare expenditures was $42 803. As decedent BMI increased 
from 20 to 30 kg/m2, the predicted probability of hospice enrollment decreased by 6.7 percentage 
points (95% CI, −9.3 to −4.0 percentage points), predicted hospice duration decreased by 3.8 days 
(95% CI, −4.4 to −3.1 days), predicted probability of in-home death decreased by 3.2 percentage 
points (95% CI, −6.0 to −0.4 percentage points), and predicted total Medicare expenditures 
increased by $3471 (95% CI, $955 to $5988). For decedents with morbid obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/
m2), there were larger effects; the predicted probability of hospice enrollment decreased 15.2 
percentage points (95% CI, −19.6 to −10.9 percentage points), hospice duration decreased 4.3 
days (95% CI, −5.7 to −2.9 days), and in-home death decreased by 6.3 percentage points (95% CI, 
−11.2 to −1.5 percentage points) compared to decedents with BMI of 20 kg/m2.
Limitations—Baseline data was self-reported, and the interval of reported height and weight to 
time of death varied among participants.
Conclusion—Among community-dwelling decedents of the Health and Retirement Study, there 
was an independent association between obesity and reduced hospice service utilization, and in-
home death, and higher Medicare expenditures in the last six months of life.

Introduction
Seventy percent of US adults aged sixty years and older are overweight or obese.(1) Obesity 
is associated with shorter life expectancy, increased risk of hospitalization and higher 
utilization of intensive care services.(2–4) Obesity is also associated with variation in the 
quality of care in cancer screening, immunizations, cancer care, and intensive care.(4–8)
For individuals with obesity, there are technical and logistical issues that arise during 
hospitalizations, surgery, and end-of-life care that require special attention. Obesity

 challenges the ability of healthcare providers and caregivers to conduct thorough physical 
assessments, assist with mobility and self-care, recognize frailty and malnutrition, and 
perform certain indicated procedures.(8–11) In addition, weight stigma has been found to 
modify patients’ and providers’ behaviors, potentially resulting in delayed diagnoses, the 
provision of sub-optimal care, and weaker therapeutic alliances.(12–15) To date, however, 
no studies have examined the association between obesity and use of hospice, a cornerstone 
of end-of-life care.
To understand the effect of BMI on hospice utilization and Medicare expenditures at the 
end-of-life, we used the Health and Retirement Study to examine hospice enrollment, total 
hospice days, decedents’ place of death, and Medicare expenditures as a function of 
participant BMI, controlling for demographic, medical, functional, and geographic factors. 
In the context of the unique challenges to care for individuals with obesity, we hypothesized 
that: first, higher BMI would be associated with decreased hospice utilization and fewer 
home deaths due to patient, provider, and system factors affecting referral to and enrollment 
in hospice services; and second, higher BMI would be associated with increased healthcare 
expenditures due to increased utilization of hospital and healthcare services.
Methods
Study Population
We examined survey and Medicare claims data for participants in the Health and Retirement 
Study (HRS) who died between 1998 and 2012, the most recent data available.(16) The HRS 
is a nationally representative panel survey that biennially interviews US adults over the age 
of 50 concerning health and financial issues. Since 1992, the HRS has enrolled more than 
30,000 participants with a follow-up response rate consistently over 90%; the recruitment 
and survey methods have been previously described.(17) The HRS survey of each 
participant covers a wide range of personal and household level data including detailed 
medical, economic, and social characteristics.(16) We studied decedents who had previously 
consented to linkage of survey data with their Medicare claims data to give additional 
information on healthcare utilization and expenditures beyond HRS-collected data. 
Respondents were eligible for the present study if they had complete fee-for-service 
Medicare Parts A and B claims data for the last 180 days of life. To focus on healthcare 
utilization among a community-dwelling population, we excluded respondents in nursing 
care facilities at the last survey wave. We also excluded respondents with missing 
information on BMI, date of survey, marital status, geographic location, functional status or 
cognitive function.
Outcomes
Participants with any Medicare hospice claims were considered hospice enrollees. For each 
patient, any day with a Medicare claim for hospice was counted as a day of hospice services.
(18) Using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review claims files, each day was classified 
as at home (no facility claims) or in a facility (claims for hospital, skilled nursing, or long-
term acute care). We calculated total Medicare spending during the last 180 days of life 
across all domains in Medicare files (inpatient, outpatient, physician/supplier, durable

 medical, hospice, home health, and skilled nursing). Expenditures were adjusted to 2012 US 
dollars using the medical component of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price 
Index.
Other Variables
The primary independent variable of interest was BMI. We calculated each decedent’s BMI 
using self-reported height and weight from the last survey interview before death. We 
defined the probable date of death using Medicare claims data linked to the National Death 
Index. We used respondent-reported measures of gender, race (non-white races were 
collapsed due to sample size), Hispanic ethnicity, marital status (widowed, single, separated, 
divorced, or married), and total household assets adjusted to 2012 US dollars. We identified 
28 comorbid medical conditions from one year prior to the defined end-of-life period (6 
months before death) using the Elixhauser method International Classification of Diseases, 
9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes from Medicare claims.(19) We used measures for 
the number of limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of 
daily living (IADL), and cognitive function (normal, mild cognitive impairment/cognitive 
impairment, no dementia, or dementia).(20) We linked decedents with a measure of regional 
end-of-life expenditures (average Medicare expenditures in the last six months of life 
reported by the 2012 Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care by hospital referral region, separated 
into quintiles) using each decedent’s zip code linked to its corresponding hospital referral 
region.(21) Cause of death was determined from the Centers for Disease and Control 
National Center for Health Statistics National Death Index (NDI) which categorizes causes 
of death by 113 ICD-10 codes. These codes were categorized as infectious, malignancy, 
diabetes mellitus, neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary, renal, or 
other. After the respondent’s death, the HRS interviews proxy informants (typically 
surviving partner or adult children) about the respondent’s end-of-life care. To examine 
whether obese patients were more likely to have an unexpected death, we used the exit 
interview question “Was the death expected at about the time it occurred or was it 
unexpected?” Response options include: “yes,” “unsure,” or “no;” responses “no” and 
“unsure” (N=14) were grouped together at negative responses. The interval of time between 
response to the last survey and time of death was calculated using the date of survey 
administration and date of death from NDI data.
Statistical Analyses
We modeled hospice enrollment, days enrolled in hospice, in-home death and Medicare 
expenditures using generalized linear models. The models used a binomial distribution and 
logit link for hospice enrollment and in-home death, a Poisson distribution and log link for 
total hospice days, and a gamma distribution and log link for expenditures. We examined 
possible models for the functional form of BMI included as a categorical variable (using 
NIH obesity categories), a linear functional form, and a quadratic functional form based on 
theory and empirical evidence (see Appendix, Statistical Model Selection and Composition).
(22) We report findings from our final models using BMI fit as a quadratic functional form 
based upon theory, previous evidence about how BMI should vary with each outcome, and 
comparisons of overall model fit as well as discrimination and calibration testing. Models 
controlled for age at death, gender, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, total

 household assets, comorbid illnesses(19), limitations in ADLs and IADLs, cognitive 
function (normal, mild cognitive impairment/cognitive impairment, no dementia, or 
dementia), quintile of regional end-of-life expenditures, and year of death.
As sensitivity analyses, to explore the extent to which the association of BMI and the 
outcomes was influenced by the length of time between the collection of BMI information 
and death, the above model was changed to include an interaction term between BMI and 
the time interval from the survey-collected self-reported height and weight to death.(23) To 
explore the extent to which the association of BMI and the outcomes was influenced by the 
cause of death and proxy-reported expected death, each of these terms were added separately 
to the above model. We also fit models with BMI defined as a categorical variable. We also 
repeated the analysis with the complete, fee-for-service, decedent HRS cohort (including 
nursing home patients) to see if selecting community dwelling respondents biased the 
overall results.
We reported each outcome in terms of the mean predicted outcome (probability of hospice 
enrollment, days enrolled in hospice, probability of in-home death and Medicare 
expenditures) at five BMI levels (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 kg/m2) and significance testing using 
95% confidence intervals. The mean predicted outcome was estimated by the statistical 
model, for a given BMI level while holding all other covariates at their own values.(24) 
Probabilities were reported as percent chance of the outcome occurring between 0% and 
100%. If the 95% confidence interval did not contain the null hypothesis value, the results 
were considered statistically significant. We used Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp) software for 
all analyses, specifically the “glm” and “margins” commands.
Role of the Funding Source
Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the HRS study. University of 
Michigan Institutional Review Board-Medical deemed this study of decedents exempt from 
institutional review board review. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs, National Institute on Aging, and National Cancer Institute financially 
supported the authors of this article. The funding sources had no role in the design, conduct, 
analysis or interpretation of the data or approval of the manuscript.
Results
Of 9,859 HRS decedents who consented to Medicare linkage, we excluded 2,485 with any 
managed care enrollment during the last six months of life. We also excluded 1,352 
decedents who reported living in a nursing facility at the last survey wave and participants 
with missing information from the last survey on: date of survey (88), height or weight from 
the last survey (93), ZIP code (23) marital status (3), activities of daily living information 
(41), or cognitive function (97) (Appendix Figure 1).
The final cohort included 5,677 decedents. Of these, 424 (7%) were underweight (BMI 
<18.5 kg/m2), 2,509 (44%) were normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2), 1,763 (31%) 
were overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2), 864 (15%) were obese (BMI 30 to <40 kg/m2), 
and 117 (2%) were morbidly obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m2); the median BMI was 24.7 kg/m2

 (Interquartile Range [IQR] 21.5 to 28.2 kg/m2). The median age at death was 81.2 years 
(IQR 73.8 to 87.5 years). The median time from last respondent survey to death was 15.6 
months (IQR 8.2 to 22.6 months). Sample characteristics by BMI category are reported in 
Table 1. A complete description of all medical comorbidities by BMI category is reported in 
Appendix Table 1.
The overall observed incidence of hospice enrollment was 34.7%. Subjects with higher BMI 
had a significantly lower likelihood of hospice enrollment compared to an individual with a 
BMI of 20 kg/m2 (Figure 1). An individual with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 had a predicted 
probability of hospice enrollment of 23.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.5% to 26.7%) 
compared to an individual with a BMI of 20 kg/m2 who had a predicted probability of 
38.3% (95% CI, 36.5% to 40.2%; Table 2). Among those who enrolled in hospice, the 
predicted total hospice days decreased as individual BMI increased. An individual with a 
BMI of 40 kg/m2 spent 4.3 fewer days (95% CI, −5.7 to −2.9 days) in hospice care than an 
individual with a BMI of 20 kg/m2. This effect was driven by decreased numbers of days 
spent in home hospice, and there was not a clinically significant increase in facility hospice 
care for patients with obesity (Appendix Table 2).
The overall observed incidence of in-home death was 59.6%. Individuals with higher BMI 
had a significantly lower likelihood of in-home death compared to an individual with a BMI 
of 20 kg/m2 (Figure 1). An individual with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 had a predicted probability of 
in-home death of 55.0% (95% CI, 51.0% to 58.9%) compared to an individual with a BMI 
of 20 kg/m2 who had a predicted probability of 61.3% (95% CI, 59.4% to 63.2%; Table 2).
In the last six months of life, total predicted Medicare expenditures increased as BMI 
increased. The mean total predicted expenditures were $42 803 (95% CI, $41 085 to $44 
521; Table 2) for an individual with a BMI of 20 kg/m2. In contrast, for an individual with a 
BMI of 30 kg/m2, the mean total predicted Medicare expenditures were $3471 (95% CI, 
$955 to $5988) higher compared to an individual with a BMI of 20 kg/m2. Predicted 
expenditures for those with a BMI of 30 kg/m2, 35 kg/m2, and 40 kg/m2 were constant, but 
there was also a decrease in precision related to small sample size at the upper extremes of 
the study sample’s BMI range (Figure 1). When examining the component Medicare 
expenditures, these expenditures were driven by inpatient, outpatient, and physician/supplier 
expenditures that increased by a mean of $4343 (95% CI, $2008 to $6678) for decedents 
with a BMI 30 kg/m2 compared to the base case BMI 20 kg/m2 (Table 3). However, these 
expenditures were offset by lower home health, durable medical, and hospice Medicare 
expenditures, which were decreased by a mean of $1173 (95% CI, $659 to $1688) for 
decedents with a BMI 30 kg/m2 compared to a decedent with a BMI of 20 kg/m2. Because 
of differences in both enrollment and length of stay, predicted hospice Medicare 
expenditures for an individual with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 ($1321 [95% CI, $949 to $1692]) 
were 60% lower than individuals with a BMI of 20 kg/m2 ($3357; [95% CI, $2896 to 
$3818]).
To examine whether this analysis was confounded by the cause of death or whether the death 
was unexpected, we re-fit the model with these variables included. Diabetes- and renal-
related causes of death were more common for obese and morbidly obese respondents than

 normal BMI (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2) respondents (Appendix Table 3). When we included 
the decedent’s cause of death as a covariate, we observed trends and effect sizes that were 
consistent with the results from the original model (Appendix Table 4). The likelihood that a 
proxy reported the death as “expected” decreased as BMI increased: 55% of deaths were 
“expected” by proxies for normal weight compared to 45% for morbidly obese (Appendix 
Table 3). When we included an “expected death” as a model covariate, the effect sizes also 
remained stable (Appendix Table 4). When we included an interaction term between BMI 
and the time interval from survey data collection, the trends and effect sizes of the outcomes 
were comparable (Appendix Table 4).
The main outcomes, reported by BMI categories, are reported in Appendix Tables 5 and 6, 
and the trends and effect sizes of the outcomes were comparable to when BMI was modeled 
as a continuous variable. The main outcomes including nursing home patients were 
comparable to the community-dwelling study cohort and are presented in Appendix Table 7. 
The complete statistical model coefficients, standard errors, and constant for model 
predicting hospice enrollment are reported in Appendix Table 8.
Discussion
In this large national sample of older American decedents, we found that increased BMI was 
independently associated with decreased hospice enrollment, duration of hospice services, 
in-home death, and increased Medicare expenditures in the last six months of life after 
adjustment for key sociodemographic, medical, functional status, and geographic factors. 
Increasing BMI was associated with higher expenditures for inpatient, outpatient, and 
physician claims although these were partially offset by lower hospice, durable medical 
equipment, and skilled nursing expenditures in this community-dwelling population. Obesity 
was a risk factor for lower quality of end-of-life care, here defined as enrollment in hospice, 
length of hospice stay, and in-home death. Additional research should focus on 
understanding the mechanisms underlying this vulnerability at the end of life.
In this study, we demonstrated that higher BMI was a strong negative predictor of hospice 
enrollment. Indeed, the predicted probability hospice enrollment was 40% lower for 
decedents with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 compared to those with a BMI of 20 kg/m2. Hospice 
enrollment has previously been shown to vary by gender, race, ethnicity, primary diagnosis, 
location before enrollment, referring physician, patient preferences concerning life-
sustaining treatment, and site of death, (25–30) but this is the first study, to our knowledge, 
to identify obesity as an independent risk factor for disparity in the use of hospice services. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that hospice utilization is associated with improved 
quality of care for individuals and their families, with reduced psychiatric morbidity and 
increased perceived healthcare quality rating in bereaved caregivers,(31–36) heightening 
concerns about the impact of underutilized hospice care in this population.(33, 37, 38)
We hypothesize that the effect of obesity on hospice enrollment may act through two 
mechanisms: referral behaviors and enrollment policies. First, prolonged cachexia 
experienced by some individuals at the end-of-life is recognized by family members and 
physicians as closely related with the dying process.(39) Individuals who do not experience

 profound cachexia may be less likely to be recognized as appropriate referrals for palliative 
or hospice services by providers compared with more cachectic individuals who may appear 
less robust physically. The trajectories of illness and dying may vary as a function of patient 
obesity within diseases. Patients with obesity may experience a more sudden decline in 
performance status or increase in metabolic abnormalities, which may lead to more sudden 
deaths than patients without obesity. In this study, the effect of obesity was not substantially 
moderated by whether the death was expected or the cause of death was known. However, 
there is presently little available research on the association between trajectories of illness 
and obesity, and this may be an important factor in the provision of high quality end-of-life 
healthcare.
Second, hospice enrollment policies vary from hospice to hospice, and some policies restrict 
access to care for individuals with higher cost medical care.(27) Obese individuals in home 
hospice may require increased nursing assistance, including the need for mechanical patient 
lift devices to provide proper patient positioning and personal care in the terminal phase of 
dying.(40) The need for extra nursing personnel or mechanical lifts may make home hospice 
care infeasible for individuals with obesity and their caregivers.(41)
Obesity is associated with increased utilization of healthcare services and associated 
expenditures.(42–45) In this community-dwelling cohort, we found that Medicare 
expenditures for obese participants were 13% higher (a difference of $4,343) for inpatient, 
outpatient, and physician expenditures but 20% lower (a difference of $1,173) for hospice, 
home health, and durable medical equipment. The etiology of increased expenditures for 
people with obesity has been explained by the relative increased prevalence of medical 
conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.(46–48) However, 
higher BMI presents many challenges to medical management beyond increased medical 
multimorbidity. Higher BMI is associated with decreased access to medical care, increased 
difficulty managing medical issues in an outpatient setting comparative to an inpatient 
setting, and more challenges transitioning from inpatient care back to home care.(49–53) 
Finally, there is an established record of negative provider attitudes and implicit bias against 
individuals with obesity, and these attitudes may continue to influence care for individuals 
with obesity at the end-of-life.(13, 14) Each of these factors may impede the provision of 
optimal medical, nursing, and supportive care for obese individuals either independently or 
together, thus explaining the independent effect of obesity on end-of-life healthcare 
expenditures.
There are several potential limitations of our study. We used a self-reported BMI measure 
that was collected a median of 16 months before death and the time interval from this pre-
death biometric to death varied within the study cohort. A sensitivity analysis examining 
whether this time interval had an effect on the association of BMI and the outcomes showed 
this was not substantial and did not change the overall effect. We only examined community-
dwelling adults using fee-for-service Medicare claims, but our results were not significantly 
different when nursing home-dwelling decedents were included in the sample. The study 
sample did not include respondents who are enrolled in managed care Medicare plans; this 
group may have substantially different characteristics and resource use at the end-of-life, 
which may limit the generalizability of these results.(54) Although we controlled for the

 presence of more than two dozen medical conditions, functional status (ADL and IADL 
limitations, and cognitive function) at the last core survey interview, cause of death, and the 
decedent proxy’s judgment of whether the death was expected or not, residual confounding 
may have inadequately controlled for differences in medical conditions and trajectories of 
illness that are affected by obesity.
These potential limitations notwithstanding, this study has identified a significant 
relationship in decedents between obesity and decreased probability of hospice enrollment 
and in-home death and, among those who were enrolled, fewer days of hospice care. The 
consequences of obesity for healthcare utilization and expenditures are substantial, and 
individuals with obesity are vulnerable to suboptimal end-of-life care. As stakeholders look 
for opportunities to improve the value of care by increasing quality and decreasing low-value 
services, the disparities in hospice utilization and Medicare expenditures by patient BMI 
provide an excellent opportunity for improvement. Policy interventions could include 
increased reimbursement for home care services of obese individuals who require multiple 
support personnel, reimbursement for patient lifts and other special durable medical 
equipment in health care facilities, or concurrent palliative care for select patients with 
severe levels of obesity. All people, regardless of body size, and their families should have 
equal opportunities to experience the benefits of high quality end-of-life healthcare.

Predicted Probability of Hospice Enrollment, Total Hospice Days, Predicted Probability of 
In-Home Death, and Total Medicare Expenditures by Body Mass Index*
Panel A shows the predicted probability of hospice enrollment in the last six months of life 
as a function of participant body mass index. Panel B shows the predicted total hospice days 
in the last six months of life as a function of participant body mass index. Panel C shows the 
predicted probability of in-home death in the last six months of life as a function of 
participant body mass index. Panel D shows the predicted total Medicare Expenditures in the 
last six months of life as a function of participant body mass index.
*Adjusted for decedent age, race/ethnicity, marital status, individual Elixhauser medical 
conditions (28), total household assets, number of activities of daily living, number of 
instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive function (normal, mild cognitive 
impairment/cognitive impairment, no dementia, or dementia), regional end of life 
expenditures quintile, and year of death. Gray area represents the 95% confidence interval of 
the estimates.
