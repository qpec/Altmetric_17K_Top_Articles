Abstract
Background: JUUL is the fastest growing and highest selling brand of e-cigarette/vapor products in the USA.
Assessing the effect of JUUL vapor products on adult smokers’ use of conventional tobacco cigarettes can help
inform the potential population health impact of these products.
Methods: Online surveys assessed past 30-day use of conventional cigarettes, JUUL vapor products, and other e-
cigarettes/vapor products, monthly for 3 months, in a non-probabilistic sample of 15,456 US adults (21+ years).
Participants were established current smokers of conventional cigarettes and recruited at their first purchase of a
JUUL Starter Kit in a retail store or through JUUL’s website. Logistic regression models examined factors associated
with participants’ odds of reporting past 30-day abstinence from cigarette smoking at the 3-months assessment.
Results: Past 30-day smoking abstinence at the 3-months assessment was reported by 28.3% of the intent-to-treat
(ITT) sample (n = 15,456) and 47.1% of an efficacy subset sample that completed the 3-months assessment (n = 9272).
Covariate-adjusted odds for reporting past 30-day smoking abstinence at the 3-months assessment were significantly
higher among participants who primarily used Mint or Mango flavored JUULpods (versus Virginia Tobacco flavor) in
the past 30 days; exclusively used JUULpods in characterizing flavors (versus tobacco flavors) in the past 30 days; used a
JUUL vaporizer on all 30 of the past 30 days; purchased their first JUUL vaporizer in a retail store (versus online); and
first purchased a JUUL Starter Kit to help quit smoking completely. Odds for reporting past 30-day smoking abstinence
were significantly lower among participants who, at study enrolment, had smoked regularly for ≥ 20 years, smoked ≥
20 cigarettes per day, and smoked on all 30 of the previous 30 days.
Conclusions: At least 28.3% of adult smokers had quit smoking cigarettes completely after using a JUUL vaporizer for
3 months. More frequent use of a JUUL vaporizer and primary use of JUULpods containing characterizing flavors,
particularly Mint and Mango, appears to be important to new JUUL users’ chances of quitting smoking. The impact of
banning retail sales of flavored JUULpods on adult smokers’ likelihood of quitting should be closely assessed.

 Background
Tobacco harm reduction (THR) products and policies
aim to prevent or reduce harm by promoting substitu-
tion
of
combustible
tobacco
with
less
hazardous
non-combustible sources of nicotine to smokers who are
unable or unwilling to quit smoking in response to con-
ventional tobacco control measures [1]. Tobacco and
nicotine products that present a reduced risk of ill health
to an individual relative to smoking cigarettes have po-
tential to benefit the health of the whole population to
the extent that (i) they are used in place of more harmful
tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes) by individuals who
currently use such products and were unlikely to have
quit or reduced their use of such products in the ab-
sence of the reduced-risk product, and to the extent that
(ii) they are not used by individuals who are not current
users of more harmful tobacco products and would
likely have not initiated or re-initiated use of such prod-
ucts in the absence of the reduced-risk product.
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)—hand-held devices
that use battery power to heat a solution of propylene
glycol, glycerol, and often flavorings and nicotine, to
produce an aerosol that the user inhales—have emerged
in the past decade with the greatest potential for meet-
ing criteria for definition as tobacco harm reduction
products. Since their introduction to the US market in
2007, e-cigarettes have rapidly grown in popularity
among adults in several countries as an alternative to
smoking conventional cigarettes [2–6], and the increas-
ing use of e-cigarettes has been associated with signifi-
cant increases in rates of smoking cessation at the
population level [7–10]. E-cigarettes are now the most
popular assisted method of quitting smoking in the
USA, used in 35% of smokers’ most recent quit attempts
[11]. By comparison, nicotine patches or gums were used
in 25% of most recent quit attempts. Though data on
the safety of long-term use of nicotine by inhalation will
not be available until e-cigarettes have been in wide-
spread use for several decades, several US and global
health authorities agree that the currently available evi-
dence suggests e-cigarette use is likely to be less harmful
than smoking cigarettes. The magnitude of potential re-
duced harm to the individual user and the potential im-
pact of e-cigarettes on the health of whole populations,
however, continues to be debated [12].
JUUL Labs Inc. is a San Francisco-based company that
manufactures pre-filled e-liquid pods known as “JUUL-
pods” for use in an electronic nicotine delivery system
(ENDS) known as a “JUUL vaporizer.” JUUL is the fast-
est growing and highest selling e-cigarette/vapor product
in the US market, which is sized at approximately $5.5
billion for 2018 [13]. According to Neilsen data, past
52-week retail sales of JUUL products in the US in-
creased from $150.0 million in July 2017 (+ 652.9%
versus July 2016) [14] to $1.3 billion in August 2018 (+
761.4% versus August 2017) [15], making JUUL the first
e-cigarette brand to record over $1 billion in sales in a
52-week period through tracked channels. With a past
52-week sales total more than three times higher than
its nearest competitor (an e-cigarette called VUSE,
$404.0 million), JUUL now has a greater past 52-week
share of the US e-cigarette market than all other
e-cigarette brands combined, having increased its market
share from 17.7% in July 2017 to 55.7% in August 2018
[5]. Neilsen additionally notes these are likely to be un-
derestimates of JUUL’s true sales and market share, as
Nielsen does not track sales through several channels
where JUUL products are sold, such as online and vape
shops. Assessing the potential population health impact
associated with the rapid and substantial increase in
sales of JUUL vapor products in the USA has become vi-
tally important.
According to JUUL’s website, JUUL vapor products are
intended for adult smokers who want to switch from
combustible cigarettes. Under the Modified Risk To-
bacco Product (MRTP) provision and the drug provi-
sions in section 911 and section 201(g) of the Federal
Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FD&C) respectively, manu-
facturers are prohibited from marketing a new tobacco
product, including JUUL vapor products, as a safer,
healthier, or less risky alternative to smoking tobacco, or
effective as an aid to smoking cessation without FDA
authorization to make such claims. Yet, anecdotal user
testimonies, many of which are shared daily on social
media platforms and internet discussion forums dedi-
cated to vaping (e.g., E-Cigarette Forum), suggests many
adult
smokers in the USA
started using a JUUL
vaporizer with an intention to use it as an alternative to
continuing to smoke regular cigarettes, and many report
that, whether intended or not at the outset of use, using
a JUUL vaporizer has helped them to quit smoking com-
pletely or to cut down the number of cigarettes they
smoke. There are no published data, however, on the
likelihood that adult tobacco smokers who begin using a
JUUL vaporizer then switch completely to use of a JUUL
vaporizer, or the likelihood that adult tobacco smokers
who begin using a JUUL vaporizer then continue to use
a JUUL vaporizer in addition to continuing to smoke
conventional cigarettes. Additionally, no data are available
on the user characteristics and product use factors that
are positively and negatively associated with smokers’ like-
lihood of quitting smoking through use of a JUUL
vaporizer. Previous research has, for example, identified
the frequency with which smokers use e-cigarettes and
the use of e-cigarettes containing non-tobacco flavors as
important determinants of a smokers’ likelihood of com-
pletely substituting e-cigarettes for conventional cigarettes
[16–21].

 Understanding the role that flavors play in the popula-
tion’s use of e-cigarettes, and the impact that flavored
e-cigarette products have on the population’s use of
more harmful tobacco products, like conventional ciga-
rettes, has been identified by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as a public health research prior-
ity. The ability to inhale e-cigarette vapor aerosol in a
vast and growing variety of characterizing flavors—a dis-
tinguishable taste or aroma, other than the taste or
aroma of tobacco—is thought to be a major feature ac-
counting for the appeal of e-cigarettes to adult smokers
as an alternative to continuing to smoke cigarettes.
However, the same concerns that led the US Congress
to ban the sale of cigarettes with characterizing flavors
in 2009 now exist for e-cigarettes. In particular, concerns
have been raised, and some evidence has been reported,
that non-tobacco flavored ENDS products, particularly
fruit and sweet e-liquid flavors, are driving the appeal of
e-cigarettes to youth, and that youth who initiate nico-
tine use through ENDS products will be more likely to
subsequently try using more harmful tobacco products
that deliver nicotine more efficiently, such as cigarettes
[22–28]. FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, has sum-
marized the need to weigh the potential risks and bene-
fits of flavored ENDS products to the whole population:
“On this issue, we see two sides—on the one hand, we
need to know the role that flavors, including menthol,
play in attracting youth to initiate tobacco use. But on
the other hand, we also need to know whether…certain
flavors may help adult cigarette smokers switch to po-
tentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery; for ex-
ample,
when
flavors
are
used
in
non-combustible
products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems. It
is possible for flavors to do both harm and good, per-
haps in different product types” [29]. Collecting data that
characterize the association between adults’ use of fla-
vored JUUL vapor products—the most widely used
brand of vapor products in the USA—and their likeli-
hood of quitting smoking in the short and long-term is
therefore vitally important to estimating the potential
population health impact of these products.
Through six monthly online surveys of a panel of US
adult established current smokers recruited at the point
of first purchase of a JUUL vaporizer in a retail store or
through JUUL’s e-commerce store, this study examined
demographic, smoking-related, and JUUL-related factors
associated with self-reported past 30-day abstinence
from cigarette smoking after ad libitum use of a JUUL
vaporizer for three and six months. Of specific interest
was the extent to which smokers’ odds of reporting past
30-day abstinence from smoking varied as a function of
their frequency and volume of use of JUULpods in six
non-tobacco flavors (versus two tobacco flavors). At the
point of writing, data collection from the sixth and final
monthly survey had not yet completed. Results are
therefore reported for the first 3 months of this study.
Methods
Sample and recruitment
Eligible individuals were US adults aged 21 years and
older who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime, now smoke cigarettes “every day” or on “some
days,” and had purchased their first JUUL Starter Kit
from a US retail store or through JUUL Labs Inc.’s
e-commerce store at http://www.juul.com within the
past 7 days. Veratad Technologies’ age verification soft-
ware, AgeMatchSM, was employed by JUUL Labs Inc. to
verify, at the point of an attempted online purchase, that
individuals were of aged 21 years or older. A JUUL
Starter Kit contains a JUUL vaporizer, a USB charging
dock, and one e-liquid pod in each of four flavors (1x
Virginia Tobacco, 1x Cool Mint, 1x Mango, and 1x
Crème Brulee). Each JUULpod contains 5% nicotine by
weight, and each pod contains 0.7 ml, equivalent to
59 mg/ml nicotine per pod.
Individuals were invited to participate in this study in
two ways. First, JUUL Labs Inc. sent email invitations
to 37,536 age-verified adults who had purchased a
JUUL Starter Kit through JUUL’s e-commerce store be-
tween 4 April 2018 and 25 June 2018. The email invited
individuals to participate in a 6-month online survey
study about their use of combustible cigarettes, JUUL
vapor products, and other e-cigarettes and vapor prod-
ucts. Invitations were sent to the email address associ-
ated with a customer’s age-verified verified account.
Email invitations containing a web-link to the survey
were scheduled to be sent to these individuals approxi-
mately 4 days after completing their online purchase of
a JUUL Starter Kit so as to be received by the individ-
ual within 1–2 days after the scheduled delivery of their
purchased product(s).
Second, individuals who purchased a JUUL Starter Kit
in a retail store were invited to participate via 3″ × 2.5″
cards that were manually inserted into the packaging of
500,000 JUUL Starter Kits, which were then distributed
at random to approximately 10,000 licensed store re-
tailers of JUUL vapor products across the USA. Starter
Kits containing invitation cards were distributed across
April 2018. Printed on each invitation card insert was
the invitation text, the survey web address, and a unique
six-digit alphanumeric code. Individuals who purchased
a JUUL Starter Kit that contained an invitation card in-
sert were invited to type the survey web address—sur-
vey.juul.com—into their web browser, and then, when
prompted, type the six-digit code displayed on their invi-
tation card insert. Entry of a valid code routed the indi-
vidual to an Account Creation webpage, and then to the
study Informed Consent Form. Each six-digit code was
Russell et al. Harm Reduction Journal           (2019) 16:22 
Page 3 of 17
 valid for one entry; attempts to re-use the code were
blocked. Requiring the entry of a unique, one-time ac-
cess code ensured that only individuals who had pur-
chased a JUUL Starter Kit in a retail store could proceed
to the Account Creation webpage, and requiring individ-
uals to create a user account ensured that only one sur-
vey could be completed per account.
Procedure
The first page of the survey displayed an Informed Con-
sent Form (available upon request), which described the
purpose of the survey, the names and contact details of
the study investigators, information about who is eligible
to take part and how survey data will be used, assur-
ances of participant anonymity and confidentiality, and
the source of funding for this study. Participants were
informed that they were being invited to take part in six
monthly online surveys about their use of combustible
cigarettes, JUUL vapor products, and other e-cigarettes
and vapor products. Individuals who satisfied eligibility
criteria and gave informed consent to participate began
the survey. Participants were routed to questions that
were applicable to them on the basis of a response or
combination of responses to a previous question or
questions. The survey instrument was designed with the
assumption that all respondents to a question would be
asked the next question, unless there were specific in-
structions routing a subgroup of respondents to a differ-
ent question. Participants answered survey questions at
their own pace. If a participant did not complete the sur-
vey, all data provided up to the point of exit from the
survey were not recorded.
The baseline survey took around 15–20 min to
complete. Participants who completed the baseline sur-
vey received an automated email invitation to complete
a follow-up survey every 30 ± 5 days for the next
6 months. An email invitation to participate in a
follow-up survey was configured to be sent automatically
to participants 25 days after the date of completion of
the previous survey, with reminder emails sent 28 days
and 31 days after the date of completion of the previous
survey. Web-link access each follow-up survey expired
10 days after the first email invitation was sent. Partici-
pants received a USD$30 virtual Visa Reward Card by
email for each survey they completed.
Measures
Cigarette smoking in the past 30 days
The primary outcome measure in this study was past
30-day abstinence from smoking, which was determined
at each assessment by a “No” response to the question,
“In the past 30 days, have you smoked a cigarette, even
one or two puffs?” Participants who indicated they have
smoked a cigarette in the past 30 days were asked two
further questions about their frequency of smoking in
the past 30 days—“Do you now smoke cigarettes…”
(every day; some days; not at all), and “On how many of
the past 30 days did you smoke cigarettes?”1 (1–
30 days)—and one question about their intensity of
smoking in the past 30 days—“On those days that you
did smoke, how many cigarettes did you usually smoke
each day? A pack usually has 20 cigarettes in it”. Partici-
pants who did not provide valid answers to these four
questions were excluded from the analytic sample.
Cigarette smoking history
Questions assessed the age at which participants first
smoked a cigarette, first started smoking regularly, the
number of months/years for which participants had been
smoking cigarettes regularly, and the number of ciga-
rettes participants had smoked in their lifetime.
Use of a JUUL vaporizer and JUULpod flavors in the past
30 days
Questions assessed the number of days in the past
30 days on which participants had used a JUUL
vaporizer and the total number of JUULpods they had
consumed in each of eight commercially available flavors
(Virginia Tobacco, Mint, Mango, Crème, Fruit, Cucum-
ber, Classic Tobacco, and Menthol) in the past 30 days.
Participants were coded as a “primary user” of a specific
flavor of JUULpod when they reported having consumed
more pods in that flavor than in any other flavor. For ex-
ample, a participant who reported having consumed ten
Mango flavored JUULpods and five Mint flavored JUUL-
pods in the past 30 days would be coded as a primary
user of Mango flavored JUULpods.
Participants were coded as “past 30-day exclusive users
to tobacco flavors” if they reported use of only Virginia
Tobacco and/or Classic Tobacco in the past 30 days.
Participants were coded as “past 30-day exclusive users
to characterizing flavors” if they reported use of only
Mint, Mango, Crème, Fruit, Cucumber, and/or Menthol
in the past 30 days. Participants were coded as “past
30-day users of both tobacco and characterizing flavors”
if they reported consumption of at least one pod in Vir-
ginia Tobacco or Classic Tobacco flavor and at least one
pod in Mint, Mango, Crème, Fruit, Cucumber, or Men-
thol flavor.
Use of e-cigarettes other than a JUUL vaporizer in the past
30 days
Questions assessed participants’ frequency and intensity
of use of e-cigarettes and vapor products other than
JUUL vaporizer in the 30 days prior to the baseline sur-
vey.
Participants who
indicated they
had
used
an
e-cigarette other than a JUUL vaporizer in the past
30 days were asked about the characteristics of the
Russell et al. Harm Reduction Journal           (2019) 16:22 
Page 4 of 17
 e-cigarette they used most often in the past 30 days, in-
cluding the brand of this e-cigarette, whether it was re-
chargeable
and
refillable,
and
what
flavors
and
concentration of nicotine they used regularly in this
e-cigarette/vapor product.
Reasons for purchasing and using a JUUL starter kit
At baseline, participants were asked to identify which, if
any, of a list of health, social, financial, sensory, and con-
venience reasons were reasons why they first decided to
purchase a JUUL Starter Kit.
Demographics
Questions assessed age, sex, census region, race-ethnicity,
educational attainment, and annual household income.
Data analysis
As this study is still collecting data, present analyses
are restricted to data collected up to and including
the 3-month follow-up survey assessment. Rates of
past 30-day abstinence from smoking at the 3-month
follow-up
assessment
are
reported
for
the
intention-to-treat (ITT) sample (N = 15,456) that com-
pleted the baseline survey assessment, stratified by
place of first purchase of a JUUL Starter Kit (retail
store
purchasers
N = 7823
vs.
JUUL
website
pur-
chasers N = 7633). In this analysis, at each follow-up
assessment, participants with a missing response to
the question “In the past 30 days, have you smoked a
cigarette, even one or two puffs?” were recoded as
“current smokers” under the worst-case scenario as-
sumption
that
these
participants
had
returned
to
baseline patterns of cigarette smoking.
Rates of past 30-day abstinence from smoking at the
3-month follow-up assessment are also reported for an
efficacy subset comprising participants who provided
smoking data at the 3-month follow-up assessment (n =
9272; 60.0% of the ITT sample), stratified by place of
first purchase of a JUUL Starter Kit (retail store pur-
chasers n = 4260 vs. JUUL website purchasers n = 5012).
Rates of past 30-day point prevalence abstinence from
smoking observed in the ITT sample and in the efficacy
subset sample were therefore considered as lower and
upper bound estimates of the rates of past 30-day point
prevalence abstinence from smoking, respectively, at the
3-month follow-up assessment.
Factors associated with past 30-day abstinence from
smoking at the 3-month assessment were examined
through two logistic regression models, with each model
conducted in two steps. In model 1 step 1, six demo-
graphic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, annual house-
hold income, education level, and US census region);
four smoking history variables (age of first smoking, life-
time years of regular smoking, number of smoking days
in the 30 days prior to the baseline assessment, number
of cigarettes smoked per day in the 30 days prior to the
baseline
assessment);
one
e-cigarette
use
variable
(current use of a secondary e-cigarette); and four JUUL
use variables (place of first JUUL purchase, number of
days of JUUL use in the past 30 days, primary JUULpod
flavor used in the past 30 days, and having purchased a
JUUL to help quit smoking) were entered as predictor
variables. To assess the extent to which the effect of par-
ticipants’ primary use of JUULpod flavors on past 30-day
abstinence from smoking at the 3-month assessment var-
ied by place at which participants purchased their first
JUUL, an interaction term for “primary JUULpod flavor
use”*“place of first JUUL purchase” was entered at step 2.
Model 2 replicated model 1 with the variable “primary
JUULpod flavor used in the past 30 days” replaced by the
variable “JUULpod flavors used regularly in the past
30 days.” Odds ratios are reported unadjusted and ad-
justed for the effects of other variables in the model. Odds
ratios in these regression models indicate the proportion-
ate change in a participant’s odds of reporting past 30-day
abstinence from smoking associated with the indicator on
the categorical predictor variable. P values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Past 30-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking at
3-months assessment
In the ITT sample, overall past 30-day point prevalence
abstinence from smoking at the 3-month assessment
was 28.3% (n = 4367/15,456), with past 30-day point
prevalence abstinence from smoking higher among retail
purchasers (30.0%; n = 2346/7823) than among online
purchasers (26.5%; n = 2021/7633). When the analysis
was restricted to only those participants who completed
the 3-month assessment, past 30-day point prevalence
abstinence from smoking was 47.1% (n = 4367/9272),
with past 30-day point prevalence abstinence from
smoking higher among retail purchasers (55.1%; n =
2346/4260) than among online purchasers (40.3%; n =
2021/5012). We therefore estimate that, at the 3-month
assessment, between 30.0% and 55.1% of new retail pur-
chasers of a JUUL vaporizer and between 26.5% and
40.3% of new online purchasers of a JUUL vaporizer, all
of whom were current smokers at the point of first pur-
chase of a JUUL vaporizer, had not smoked a cigarette in
the past 30 days (Fig. 1).
Factors associated with past 30-day smoking abstinence
at the 3-month assessment
Demographic, cigarette smoking, and e-cigarette use
characteristics of participants who reported and did not
report past 30-day smoking abstinence at the 3-month
assessment are summarized in Table 1. In model 1 step
Russell et al. Harm Reduction Journal           (2019) 16:22

 1, participants’ adjusted odds of reporting past 30-day
abstinence from smoking significantly varied by four
JUUL-related variables—primary JUULpod flavor used in
the 30 days prior to the 3-month assessment; number of
days of JUUL use in the 30 days prior to the 3-month
assessment; place of first purchase of a JUUL Starter Kit;
and whether or not participants first purchased a JUUL
Starter Kit to help them quit smoking cigarettes—three
smoking-related variables—number of smoking days in
the 30 days prior to the baseline assessment, number of
cigarettes smoked per day at the baseline assessment,
and lifetime years of regular smoking—and one demo-
graphic variable—education level (Table 2).
Model 1
JUUL-related predictors Compared to those who pri-
marily used Virginia Tobacco flavored JUULpods in the
30 days prior to the 3-month assessment, those who pri-
marily used Mint flavored JUULpods (aOR = 1.37; 1.13,
1.66) or Mango flavored JUULpods (aOR = 1.26; 1.05,
1.52) were 37% and 26% more likely, respectively, to
have not smoked a cigarette in the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment. Mint and Mango were the most
common primary flavors, with primary users of Mint
and Mango flavored JUULpods in the 30 days prior to
the 3-month assessment together accounting for 49.8%
of all participants who had not smoked a cigarette in the
30 days prior to the 3-month assessment, and 44.7% of
all participants who completed the 3-month assessment.
Compared to those who primarily used Virginia Tobacco
flavored JUULpods, those who primarily used Classic
Tobacco flavored JUULpods (aOR = 0.54; 0.35, 0.84)
were 1.85 times less likely to have not smoked a
cigarette in the 30 days prior to the 3-month assessment.
Compared to those who primarily used Virginia Tobacco
flavored JUULpods, odds for reporting past 30-day
smoking abstinence at the 3-month assessment were not
significantly different among those who primarily used
Crème, Fruit, Cucumber, or Menthol flavored JUUL-
pods, or among those who did not have a primary flavor
in the 30 days prior to the 3-month assessment. The
interaction term entered at step 2 was non-significant,
indicating that the association between primary JUUL-
pod flavor used in the 30 days prior to the 3-month as-
sessment and past 30-day smoking abstinence at the
3-month assessment was not significantly moderated by
the place at which participants purchased their first
JUUL vaporizer.
Compared to those who purchased their first JUUL
vaporizer through the e-commerce store on JUUL’s web-
site, those who purchased their first JUUL vaporizer in a
retail store were 37% more likely to have not smoked a
cigarette in the 30 days prior to the 3-month assessment
(aOR = 1.37; 1.22, 1.53). Compared to those who used a
JUUL vaporizer on all 30 of the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment, those who used a JUUL vaporizer
on 20–29 days (aOR = 0.51; 0.45, 0.58), 10–19 days
(aOR = 0.38; 0.32, 0.45), and 1–9 days (aOR = 0.56; 0.45,
0.68) in the past 30 days were 1.96 times, 2.63 times,
and 1.79 times less likely, respectively, to have not
smoked a cigarette in the 30 days prior to the 3-month
assessment. Compared to those who did not purchase
their first JUUL vaporizer in order to help them to quit
smoking cigarettes completely, those who did purchase
their first JUUL vaporizer in order to help them to quit

 smoking cigarettes completely were 34% more likely to
have not smoked a cigarette in the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment (aOR = 1.34; 1.16, 1.55).
Smoking-related predictors Smoking heaviness, fre-
quency, and duration at the point of first purchase of a
JUUL Starter Kit were all negatively associated with par-
ticipants’ odds of reporting past 30-smoking abstinence
at the 3-month assessment. Compared to those who had
smoked cigarettes on all 30 of the 30 days prior to the
baseline assessment, those who had smoked cigarettes
on 20–29 days (aOR = 1.55; 1.36, 1.77), 10–19 days
(aOR = 2.28; 1.91, 2.71), and 1–9 days (aOR = 2.87; 2.40,
3.43) of the 30 days prior to the baseline assessment
were approximately 1.6 times, 2.3 times, and 2.9 times
more likely to have not smoked a cigarette in the 30 days
prior to the 3-month assessment. Compared to those
who were smoking 1–9 cigarettes per day at the baseline
assessment, those who were smoking 20 or more ciga-
rettes per day at the baseline assessment were 19% less
likely to have not smoked a cigarette in the 30 days prior
to the 3-month assessment (aOR = 0.84; 0.71, 0.99). Com-
pared to those had smoked regularly for 20 or more years
in their lifetime at the baseline assessment, those who had
smoked regularly for 0–12 months (aOR = 1.78; 1.29, 2.44)
and 1–5 years (aOR = 1.57; 1.20, 2.05) were 78% and 57%
more likely, respectively, to have not smoked a cigarette in
the 30 days prior to the 3-month assessment.
Demographic predictors Compared to those who had
not graduated high school, those with a General Educa-
tion Diploma (GED) were 51% more likely to have not
smoked a cigarette in the 30 days prior to the 3-month
assessment (aOR = 1.51; 1.02, 2.22).
Model 2
All eight variables that emerged as significant predictors
of past 30-day smoking abstinence at the 3-months as-
sessment in model 1 remained significant in model 2,
with no non-significant predictors in model 1 becoming
significant in model 2. The added variable—JUULpod
flavors used in the 30 days prior to the 3-month assess-
ment—was significantly associated with
participants’
odds of reporting past 30-day abstinence from smoking
at the 3-month assessment. Compared to those who ex-
clusively used JUULpods in tobacco flavors in the 30 days
prior to the 3-month assessment, those who exclusively
used JUULpods in characterizing flavors were 30% more
likely to have not smoked a cigarette in the 30 days prior
to the 3-month assessment (aOR = 1.30; 1.07, 1.57).

non-significantly less likely to have not smoked a

(aOR = 0.88; 0.71, 1.09). Finally, the interaction term en-

 after purchasing their first JUUL vaporizer from a retail
store or e-commerce website. Of those who responded
to the 3-month assessment, 47.1% reported having not
smoked any cigarettes for at least the past 30 days. Eight
variables were significant in predicting smokers’ likeli-
hood of reporting past 30-day abstinence from smoking
after using a JUUL vaporizer for 3 months. Daily use of a
JUUL vaporizer in the past month, primary use of Mint or
Mango flavored JUULpods, exclusive use of JUULpods in
characterizing flavors, purchasing one’s first JUUL Starter
Kit in a retail store, and purchasing one’s first JUUL
vaporizer to help to quit smoking completely were all as-
sociated with significantly higher adjusted odds of not
having smoked any cigarettes in the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment. Smoking regularly for more than
20 years, smoking more cigarettes per day and smoking
on more days in the 30 days before purchasing one’s first
JUUL Starter Kit, and primary use of Classic Tobacco fla-
vored JUULpods (versus Virginia Tobacco flavored pods)
were all associated with significantly lower adjusted odds
of not having smoked any cigarettes in the 30 days prior
to the 3-month assessment.
JUULpods in non-tobacco flavors, particularly Mint
and Mango, appeared to play an important role in help-
ing smokers to quit within the first 3 months of using a
JUUL vaporizer. In addition to being the most com-
monly
used
flavors
in
the
JUULpod
flavor
range,
smokers who primarily vaped JUULpods flavored to
taste like Mint or Mango in the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment were 37% and 26% more likely, re-
spectively, to have not smoked any cigarettes in the
30 days prior to the 3-month assessment (compared to
primary users of Virginia Tobacco flavored JUULpods).
Likewise, smokers who had exclusively used JUULpods
in characterizing flavors—Mint, Menthol, Mango, Cu-
cumber, Fruit, and/or Crème—in the 30 days prior to
the 3-month assessment were 30% more likely to have
not smoked any cigarettes in the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment (compared to exclusive users of
JUULpods in tobacco flavors).
Purchasing one’s first JUUL Starter Kit in a retail store
also appeared to play an important role in the success of
smokers’ quit attempts. Compared to smokers who pur-
chased their first JUUL Starter Kit through the e-commerce
store at JUUL’s website, smokers who purchased their first
JUUL Starter Kit in a retail store were 37% more likely to
have not smoked any cigarettes in the 30 days prior to the
3-month assessment. Additionally, a non-significant inter-
action term indicated that the beneficial effect of primary
use of Mint or Mango pods (versus Virginia Tobacco pods)
was statistically equivalent for individuals who purchased
their first JUUL Starter Kit in a retail store and for individ-
uals who purchased their first JUUL Starter Kit through the
e-commerce store on JUUL’s website.
Together with evidence that use of non-tobacco fla-
vors (versus tobacco flavors) was more strongly associ-
ated with 3-month quit outcomes, the finding that
smokers who purchased their first JUUL Starter Kit and
e-liquid pods in a retail store are more likely to have quit
smoking 3 months later is significant in the light of an
announcement from JUUL Labs Inc. on 13 November
2018. This announcement stated that, in response to
concern expressed by the FDA about the role of
non-tobacco flavors in increasing the appeal of vaping to
youth, JUUL Labs Inc. has stopped selling its Mango,
Crème, Fruit, and Cucumber flavored pods to the over
90,000 retail stores in the USA that currently sell JUUL’s
flavored pods, including convenience stores and specialty
vape stores. This voluntary action by JUUL Labs Inc. to
suspend retail sales of flavored products preceded an an-
nouncement by FDA on 15 November 2018 of an
intention to revisit its discretionary extension of the pre-
market application compliance date to August 2022 for
newly regulated non-combustible tobacco products that
are flavored, including all flavors other than tobacco,
mint, and menthol. The changes being sought by FDA
Commissioner Gottlieb would require all flavored ENDS
products (other than tobacco, mint, and menthol flavors
or
non-flavored
products)
sold
in
age-restricted,
in-person locations, and, if sold online, under heightened
practices for age verification.
FDA’s proposal to ban the retail sale of flavored ENDS
products is an effort to strike a careful balance between
maintaining adult smokers’ access to potentially less
harmful sources of nicotine through ENDS for adults
who want to transition away from combustible ciga-
rettes, and reducing youth appeal and access to ENDS
products. This policy will mean that, in the near future,
adult smokers aged 21 years and older in the USA who
want to purchase JUULpods flavored to taste like
Mango, Crème, Fruit, and Cucumber will only be able to
do so (legally) through the e-commerce store at JUUL’s
website. Adult smokers will still be able to purchase
Mint flavored pods in retail stores, which present evi-
dence suggests is both the most popular flavor and the
flavor most strongly associated with past 30-day smok-
ing
abstinence
at
the
3-month
assessment.
Adult
smokers will only be able to purchase JUULpods in four
flavors in retail stores, three of which—Virginia Tobacco,
Classic Tobacco, and Menthol—are considerably less
popular than Mint and Mango and associated with sig-
nificantly lower 3-month quit rates compared to Mint
and Mango. In light of data from the present study then,
the restrictions imposed by this policy will mean adults
will be less able to purchase the flavors of JUULpods
that are the most preferred and most strongly associated
with short-term quitting success, from the points of pur-
chase that are more strongly associated with short-term
Russell et al. Harm Reduction Journal           (2019) 16:22 
Page 13 of 17
 quitting success. It will therefore be vitally important to
measure the impact of suspending retail sales of flavored
JUULpods on rates of use of JUULpods by both adult
smokers and youth, and in turn, on associated rates of
smoking cessation and initiation. In particular, there is a
need for population surveillance systems through which
researchers can compare the strength of the prospective
association between adults’ use of flavored ENDS prod-
ucts and smoking cessation at the population level, and
the prospective association between youths’ use of fla-
vored ENDS products and smoking initiation at the
population level.
It is possible that banning retail sales of flavored ENDS
products could have little impact on adult smoking quit
rates if smokers simply migrate to a retail-available sec-
ond or third flavor choice that they also find to be a sat-
isfying alternative to cigarettes. Present evidence of the
stronger association between primary use of Mint and
Mango JUULpods should not be interpreted as evidence
that the retail availability of JUULpods in these flavors is
essential to increasing rates of smoking cessation. It is
possible that, when unable to purchase Mint and Mango
pods in retail stores, a proportion of smokers who would
prefer to purchase these flavors will switch to using
JUULpods in the tobacco and mint/menthol flavors that
will continue to be available, rather than discontinuing
their use of a JUUL vaporizer altogether. The uncon-
trolled nature of our study design means we cannot
know what proportion of those quitters who were retail
purchasers and primary users of Mango flavored JUUL-
pods would have used JUULpods in tobacco or mint/
menthol flavors and quit smoking even if Mango fla-
vored JUULpods had been unavailable for purchase in
retail stores during this study.
It is perhaps more plausible, however, to expect the
loss of retail store access to Mango flavored JUULpods—
the second most popular flavor and a flavor associated
with a significantly higher 3-month quit rate than flavors
that will still be available for purchase in retail stores
(Virginia Tobacco, Classic Tobacco, and Menthol)—will
result in fewer adult smokers achieving smoking abstin-
ence in the first 3 months of using a JUUL vaporizer,
and may result in an increased drop-off in the number
of primary retail-Mango pod users who had quit smok-
ing at the 3-month assessment remaining quit at the
6-month assessment of this study. This latter hypothesis
will be addressed by data from the 6-month assessment
of this study when available.
A third and much less likely possibility is that the pro-
portion of smokers who achieved smoking abstinence in
the third month of using a JUUL vaporizer in this study
would have been higher had Mango flavored JUULpods
not been available to purchase in retail stores during the
period of this study. Given evidence that Mint and
Mango flavored JUULpods are more strongly preferred
by adult smokers to JUULpods in tobacco flavors, and
significantly more strongly associated with smoking ces-
sation within the first 3 months of using a JUUL
vaporizer, regulatory actions that FDA may take to pre-
vent youth access to flavored ENDS products that also
have the effect of preventing or reducing adult smokers’
access to JUULpods in these non-tobacco flavors risk
losing a substantial number of successful smoking quit
attempts that are solely or sufficiently attributable to use
of JUULpods in these non-tobacco flavors. In this sense,
the present study may provide useful reference informa
tion
for
studies
of
a
similar
nature
conducted
post-implementation of any policies that affect adult
smokers’ access to flavored ENDS products.
Smokers who used a JUUL vaporizer more frequently
in the 30 days prior to the 3-month assessment were
also significantly more likely to have not smoked a
cigarette in those 30 days. This is consistent with find-
ings from nationally representative surveys [16, 17]. For
example, data from the 2014 and 2015 US National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) showed that over half
(52%) of daily e-cigarette users had quit smoking in the
last 5 years. Daily e-cigarette users were 3.15 times more
likely to have quit smoking compared to those who have
never used an e-cigarette (28.2%). Those who used
e-cigarettes on only some days were least likely to have
quit (12.1%). The observation of similarly strong associa-
tions between daily use of a JUUL vaporizer and past
30-day cigarette abstinence outcomes in this study
reinforce the notion that adults who are using a JUUL
vaporizer to help them to quit smoking should be en-
couraged to use their JUUL vaporizer as needed each
day.
Adult smokers in this study were, at the point of their
first purchase of a JUUL Starter Kit, more likely to be
males aged 21–34, daily smokers of 1–9 cigarettes, and
smoking cigarettes regularly for less than 10 years. Con-
sistent with the literature on the negative association be-
tween severity of cigarette dependence and odds for
quitting smoking, participants’ likelihood of completely
switching
from
combustible
cigarettes
to
a
JUUL
vaporizer after 3 months decreased as their frequency,
heaviness, and duration of cigarette smoking at baseline
increased. These data have several important implica-
tions for the current and potential impact of JUUL vapor
products on smoking cessation and smoking-related dis-
ease in the US adult population.
First, at present, new JUUL users are more likely to be
lighter smokers who have been smoking for fewer years
of their lifetime, and present data indicate that odds for
quitting smoking within 3 months of initiating use of a
JUUL vaporizer are highest among these smoker groups.
By appealing more to younger, lighter, shorter-term
Russell et al. Harm Reduction Journal           (2019) 16:22 
Page 14 of 17
 smokers who, by virtue of their reduced heaviness and
duration of exposure to cigarette smoke are likely to be
presently experiencing fewer health problems related to
cigarette smoking, and by being more effective in help-
ing these smokers to quit within 3 months, the use of a
JUUL vaporizer for even a short period of time may be
highly effective in diverting younger, less dependent
smokers away from smoking before they begin to experi-
ence serious smoking-related health problems and be-
come increasingly dependent on cigarettes. However,
given that lighter smokers may have been comparably
likely to try and succeed in quitting smoking with
non-pharmacological
interventions,
and
given
that
long-term inhalation of vapor from a JUUL vaporizer is
unlikely to be without some health risks, the potential
benefits of switching from light smoking to regular use
of JUUL vaporizer need to be weighed against the poten-
tial risks that could be incurred through prolonged ex-
posure to daily, high doses of nicotine and varying levels
of other harmful and potentially harmful constituents of
vapor if these switchers were to go on to become
long-term or lifelong JUUL users.
Second, there is a need to understand the extent to
which
the
lower
proportions
of
older,
heavier,
longer-term, and female cigarette smokers who opted
into this study are reflected in the whole population of
JUUL users, and if so, why these smoking sub-groups,
who are at greater risk for developing smoking-related
diseases, are less likely to use JUUL vapor products.
There is also a clear need to better understand why, be-
yond lifetime cigarette exposure, smokers who are at the
greatest risk of developing smoking-related diseases—
those smoking more cigarettes per day, smoking more
days in the month, and have smoked for more years in
their lifetime at the point of first purchase of a JUUL
Starter Kit—have the greatest difficulty in completely
substituting a JUUL vaporizer for combustible cigarettes
within 3 months. Specifically, research should seek to
understand the extent to which these smokers’ lower
likelihood of using a JUUL vaporizer and lower likeli-
hood of completely switching to a JUUL vaporizer could
be addressed by innovating the look, feel, taste, nicotine
delivery, and satisfaction of existing JUUL products to
be increasingly socially acceptable and pharmacologically
appealing to heavier, more frequent, and longer-term
cigarette smokers, and by increasing marketing of JUUL
vapor products toward these smoking sub-groups. It
should
be
acknowledged,
however,
that,
for
many
smokers, there may be no level of innovation of an
e-cigarette that will replicate or compete with the satis-
faction of smoking a cigarette. Assisting these individuals
to quit smoking sooner may require provision of ad-
junctive behavioral support, concurrent use of other
products and methods that are empirically supported for
smoking cessation, and/or education and practical skills
training on
how
to use
JUUL vapor
products
to
maximize their chances of quitting smoking.
A final important finding of this study was that,
though the quit rate at 3 months was significantly higher
among smokers who purchased their first JUUL Starter
Kit to help them to quit smoking cigarettes, the un-
adjusted quit rate (45.5%) among the 17% of smokers
who did not buy their first JUUL Starter Kit to help to
quit smoking was also high. This finding suggests that
many
smokers
who
had
initiated
use
of
a
JUUL
vaporizer with an intention to dual use cigarettes and
the JUUL vaporizer ultimately came to prefer exclusive
use of a JUUL vaporizer to dual use of both products.
That a high proportion of smokers without an initial
intention to quit smoking ultimately did quit smoking is
encouraging given that many smokers tend to initiate
use of e-cigarettes primarily out of curiosity about the
taste and effects of vaping, and with skepticism about
the extent to which vaping can replace, let alone com-
pete with, smoking cigarettes. Smokers may perceive a
need to use a JUUL vaporizer, or indeed any e-cigarette,
for at least several weeks or months to be assured that
e-cigarettes can meet their wants and needs that have
long been well served by cigarettes, and so increase ini-
tially low levels of interest, motivation, and self-efficacy
for switching to levels necessary for them to begin to
contemplate and then attempt to switch completely
away from cigarettes. Future research that identifies the
typical duration of use a JUUL vaporizer at which
smokers whom had an initial intention to use a JUUL
vaporizer in addition to cigarettes come to formalize and
pursue a long-term goal of using a JUUL vaporizer in
place of cigarettes could provide crucial insights into the
early subjective experiences (e.g., sensorial, hedonic,
physical, emotional) of using a JUUL vaporizer that
prompt smokers to re-evaluate their motivation and per-
ceived need to continue smoking cigarettes.
The conclusions of this study are limited in several
ways. First, the sample is not representative of the US
adult population of smokers or e-cigarette users, nor
was the study designed or intended to estimate the
prevalence or frequency of use of JUUL vapor products
among the e-cigarette-using population of US adults.
The study aimed to elicit data on individual characteris-
tics and patterns of cigarette smoking and use of JUUL
vapor products that are prospectively associated with in-
creased and reduced odds of quitting smoking in a large,
self-selecting
sample
of
adult
established
current
smokers who had very recently started to use a JUUL
vaporizer and who agreed to participate in each survey
in exchange for US$30. The recruitment methods were
therefore biased toward outlets where new JUUL users
would be found, and so the study conclusions do not

 represent the individual user characteristics, patterns of
product use, or smoking outcomes associated with any
other ENDS product, and may also not represent new
JUUL purchasers who declined the invitation to partici-
pate in this study.
By including only those who were adult established
current smokers at the time of their first purchase of a
JUUL Starter Kit, this study additionally does not yield
data on the proportion of all new JUUL purchasers who
are adults (versus adolescents) or current smokers (ver-
sus former smokers and never smokers). In turn, this
study yields no data about the rate of smoking initiation
and smoking relapse among those who were not actively
smoking or had never smoked a cigarette, respectively,
when they purchased their first JUUL Starter Kit. Esti-
mating these rates are essential for modeling the impact
of using JUUL vapor products on the health of the whole
US population, the majority of which are non-users of
tobacco products.
We must also stress that the short-term self-reported
smoking outcome data reported here should not be
taken as evidence that using a JUUL vaporizer can be ef-
fective for helping smokers to quit in the long-term. To
our knowledge, no data have been published that de-
scribe the extent to which use of a JUUL vaporizer is as-
sociated
with
long-term
abstinence
from
cigarette
smoking, or the extent to which short-term changes in
smoking behavior associated with JUUL use are predict-
ive of longer-term, clinically significant changes in smok-
ing behavior, or smoking-related health outcomes. The
extent to which study participants who reported positive
short-term smoking behavior change after 3 months of
using a JUUL vaporizer ultimately relapse to baseline
smoking patterns or sustain early positive changes up to
and including 6 months of JUUL use will be examined
when the data from the 6-months assessment of this
study become available.
Finally, we stress that the data presented here on the
rates of quitting smoking associated with different pat-
terns of JUUL use for 3 months do not permit conclu-
sions about the potential impact of JUUL use on the
current or future health status of study participants. No
data have been presented that would permit the conclu-
sion that adults who switched completely from smoking
cigarettes to using a JUUL are likely to have increased or
reduced their exposure to harmful and potentially harm-
ful toxicants, or their risk for developing serious health
problems. The present study collected no data that could
adequately characterize the health impact of switching
from smoking cigarettes to using a JUUL vaporizer.
Studies that characterize the risk/safety profile of JUUL
vapor products relative to combustible cigarettes, other
ENDS products, and FDA-approved smoking cessation
products and medications, and which characterize the
patterns of use of JUUL vapor products that increase
and decrease risks to users’ health, are urgently needed.
Conclusions
Between 28.3% and 47.1% of adult new users of the
JUUL vaporizer, who were established daily or non-daily
smokers when they began using a JUUL vaporizer, had
not smoked any cigarettes in the third month of using a
JUUL vaporizer. Those who used a JUUL vaporizer every
day, purchased their first JUUL Starter Kit in a retail
store, primarily used JUULpods flavored to taste like
Mint or Mango, and exclusively used JUULpods in char-
acterizing flavors were significantly more likely to have
not smoked any cigarettes in the third month of using a
JUUL vaporizer. Given this evidence of the importance
of
JUULpods
containing
characterizing
flavors—and
their availability in retail stores—to smokers’ likelihood
of quitting smoking in the short-term, the impact of a
pending suspension of retail sales of flavored JUULpods
on adults’ likelihood of quitting smoking should be
closely assessed. Present data may be used as reference
information for assessing the impact of policies that re-
strict the accessibility of flavored JUUL vapor products
on the rate of smoking cessation among adults who at-
tempt to switch completely to JUUL vapor products. As
part of a broader collection of data on the human health
impact of JUUL vapor products, these data can also as-
sist the FDA Center for Tobacco Products to determine
whether issuing a marketing authorization order for
JUUL vapor products would be appropriate for the pro-
tection of the public health under section 910 of the
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 387j).
Endnotes
1This question was only asked to those who reported
smoking on “some days.” A value of “30” was imputed
for those who reported having smoked ‘every day’ in the
past 30 days.
