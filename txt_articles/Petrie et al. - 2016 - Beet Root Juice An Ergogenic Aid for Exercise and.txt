Abstract
Background: Exercise has positive neuroplastic effects on the aging brain. It has also been shown that ingestion of beet root juice (BRJ) 
increases blood flow to the brain and enhances exercise performance. Here, we examined whether there are synergistic effects of BRJ and 
exercise on neuroplasticity in the aging brain.
Methods: Peak metabolic equivalent (MET) capacity and resting-state magnetic resonance imaging functional brain network organization are 
reported on 26 older (mean age = 65.4 years) participants randomly assigned to 6 weeks of exercise + BRJ or exercise + placebo.
Results: Somatomotor community structure consistency was significantly enhanced in the exercise + BRJ group following the intervention 
(MBRJ = −2.27, SE = 0.145, MPlacebo = −2.89, SE = 0.156, p = .007). Differences in second-order connections between the somatomotor cortex 
and insular cortex were also significant; the exercise + BRJ group (M = 3.28, SE = 0.167) had a significantly lower number of connections 
than exercise + placebo (M = 3.91, SE = 0.18, p = .017) following the intervention. Evaluation of peak MET capacity revealed a trend for the 
exercise + BRJ group to have higher MET capacity following the intervention.
Conclusions: Older adults who exercised and consumed BRJ demonstrated greater consistency within the motor community and fewer 
secondary connections with the insular cortex compared with those who exercised without BRJ. The exercise + BRJ group had brain networks 
that more closely resembled those of younger adults, showing the potential enhanced neuroplasticity conferred by combining exercise and BRJ 
consumption.
Keywords: Beet root juice—Neuroimaging—Brain health—Physical functioning
Researchers have established a link between brain plasticity and 
exercise in the aging brain (1,2). Researchers have also observed 
improvements in exercise performance and increased blood flow to 
the brain with the ingestion of beet root juice (BRJ) due to increased 
availability of nitric oxide (NO) (3–6). We hypothesized that there 
may be synergistic effects of BRJ and exercise on neuroplasticity 
in the aging brain. To that end, we designed a clinical trial to test 
whether exercise combined with regular ingestion of BRJ would 
induce neuroplasticity as measured by functional brain network 
community structure and improve exercise tolerance as measured 
by peak MET capacity compared with elderly participants who were 
only exercising. Specifically, in the current study, functional brain 
networks and exercise tolerance were assessed before and after a 
6-week aerobic exercise intervention that was combined with either 
a BRJ or placebo supplement in a double-blind study design.
Exercise has been demonstrated to promote several mechanisms 
that support brain plasticity, leading to both structural and func-
tional brain changes. Among older adults, both gray and white mat-
ter volume (7,8) and hippocampal volume (9) have been shown to 
increase following aerobic exercise interventions. In another study, 
older adults with a higher VO2 max, an index of cardiovascular fit-
ness, demonstrated significantly greater activation in attentional 
control regions and significantly less activity in the anterior cingulate 
cortex during a cognitive task (10). More recently, Voss and col-
leagues conducted a 1-year aerobic intervention in older adults and 
found that not only did aerobic training improve older adults’ resting

 functional efficiency in cognitive networks, but it also increased the 
functional connectivity between their default mode network and 
frontal executive network (1).
BRJ has been shown to be an encouraging nutritional comple-
ment to exercise. Inorganic nitrate found in BRJ is metabolized by 
oral bacteria and converted to nitrite in the body (11,12), and the 
nitrite is reduced to NO allowing it to act beneficially to lower blood 
pressure (BP) and increase blood flow, especially to hypoxic areas of 
the body (4). When combined with exercise, the nitrate from BRJ has 
been shown to improve exercise performance. For example, research-
ers have demonstrated improved performance in well trained row-
ers following 6 days of drinking a BRJ supplement (3). Others have 
reported improved performance in a 5K run and lower ratings of 
perceived exertion (RPE) following consumption of baked beet root 
(13). Improved exercise performance measured by increased peak 
power and elevated work rate after 15 days of BRJ has also been 
reported (14). BRJ has also been shown to improve exercise endur-
ance (5,15,16), and perhaps one of the most well-established benefits 
of BRJ in relation to exercise is the ability to reduce O2 cost during 
exercise, even at low doses (17–19). In addition, BRJ has been dem-
onstrated to acutely improve regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 
frontal lobe white matter of elderly people (4) and has also been 
shown to modulate CBF of the prefrontal cortex during cognitive 
tasks with some improvement in task performance (20).
Finally, recent work by Hugenschmidt and colleagues demon-
strated that the integrity of the brain is associated with mobility 
in older adults (21). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) data were collected in older participants who were 
divided into three levels of physical functioning based on scores 
from the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (22). Significant 
differences in somatomotor cortex connectivity and secondary con-
nections to the insula based on the SPPB classification were seen. 
Specifically, older adults with low levels of mobility showed reduced 
consistency in the motor community and a greater number of con-
nections with the insular region as compared with a population of 
younger adults.
Here, we expanded on the work of Hugenschmidt and colleagues 
and tested whether there are synergistic effects of BRJ and exercise 
on neuroplasticity in the aging brain. Our primary hypothesis was 
that the combined effects of exercise + BRJ would lead to greater 
connectivity in the brain motor community than exercise + placebo. 
In addition, we hypothesized that the brain motor community of 
participants in the exercise + BRJ group would have fewer second-
ary connections with the insula than those randomized to exercise 
+ placebo. Finally, given the ergogenic effect of BRJ on exercise per-
formance, we hypothesized that participants in the exercise + BRJ 
group would have improved peak aerobic capacity during a tread-
mill test to exhaustion as compared with exercise + placebo.
Methods
Design and Participants
This was a randomized controlled double-blind placebo-controlled 
trial. Twenty-seven community-dwelling, hypertensive, older men 
and women were recruited for this study. One participant was 
removed from data analysis due to an MRI data error resulting in a 
final N = 26. Participants were 55 years or older, had a systolic BP 
between 130 and 160 mm Hg taking no more than two hypertensive 
medications, and were sedentary (defined as performing <60 min-
utes of moderate levels of exercise each week performed in bouts 
>10 minutes). Hypertensive participants were selected because of the 
known effects of BRJ on the cardiovascular system and the potential 
benefits that that BRJ might have for this population. Exclusion cri-
teria included the use of tobacco products, a Modified Mini-Mental 
State Exam score less than 80, or a diagnosis of active neurologi-
cal dysfunction. Furthermore, participants were ineligible if they 
were taking medications known to interfere with nitrate/nitrite 
metabolism.
BRJ Supplement
Each week participants were given 7 days of BEET IT Sport Shot 
(http://www.beet-it.com/) with 560 mg of nitrate or the Placebo 
BEET IT Sport Shot (http://www.beet-it.com/) containing very little 
(1.1 mg) nitrate, depending on the randomization. The participants 
were instructed to consume one 70-mL (2.4 oz.) beverage each day 
within 30 minutes of opening the bottle and to consume the bever-
age 1 hour before the exercise intervention.
Exercise Intervention
The aerobic exercise intervention consisted of a center-based, indi-
vidualized, moderately intense walking program of 18 sessions: three 
50-minute sessions per week for 6 weeks. All participants walked on 
motorized Life Fitness TR-9500HR treadmills at an RPE of 12–13 
on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale. The first 4 weeks 
were used to acclimatize participants to the training protocol and 
progressively increase the walking time toward the goal of 50 min-
utes per session. Participants were guided through a series of stretch-
ing exercises before and after walking.
Network Organization of Somatomotor Cortex
All participants completed two brain MRI scans: one preinterven-
tion, prior to randomization and one following the 6-week exercise 
intervention. The preintervention and postintervention scans were 
performed at the same time of day for each participant and were 
performed within 2 hours of ingestion of the drink (BRJ supplement 
or placebo). The two brain MRI scans were performed on noninter-
vention days: The first scan was within 2 days of the first exercise 
intervention, and the second scan was within 2 days after the final 
exercise intervention.
Detailed methodology on the acquisition of images and the cal-
culation of brain networks for analysis from the MRI data can be 
found in Supplementary Material. The community structure of the 
brain network from each individual participant for the resting-state 
fMRI scans was determined using network modularity (23) and the 
Louvain algorithm (24). Communities within the brain are defined 
as groups of nodes that are more connected to each other than to 
nodes in other groups. Once the community structure was deter-
mined for each participant, the consistency of community structure 
across participants was assessed using scaled inclusivity (SI) (25). SI 
evaluates the overlap of modules across participants while penaliz-
ing for disjunction (26). It produces values ranging between 0 and 1, 
where 1 represents absolute consistency across all participants and 
values less than 1 indicate disjunction of modules. SI values were 
compared across groups.
Given that the overarching hypothesis of the current work was 
that exercise and BRJ would have synergistic effects on motor cor-
tex organization, analyses focused on somatomotor communities. 
A region of interest (ROI) was generated based on the somatomotor 
community structure of a group of 19 older adults with high physi-
cal functioning from a prior study (Supplementary Figure 1) (21). 
SI was computed for the entire brain of each participant using the

 somatomotor ROI as the referent. The mean SI was then computed 
across the voxels within the somatomotor ROI.
Next we sought to identify how the somatomotor cortex con-
nected to areas beyond its community boundaries using second-
order connectivity analyses. We did not assess first-order connections 
(nodes directly connected to the somatomotor cortex) because first-
order connections often remain within the community of interest. 
Therefore, second-order connections provide a better idea of the 
somatomotor cortex’s connectivity to other communities. Based on 
the findings of Hugenschmidt and colleagues (21), we determined 
the number of second-order connections from the somatomotor 
cortex to the insula. The insula was defined using the Automated 
Anatomical Labeling Atlas implemented in WFU Pickatlas software 
(27). The left and right insula were combined into a single ROI, and 
the average number of connections across all voxels within the ROI 
was computed (Supplementary Figure 1).
Assessment of Peak MET Capacity
To evaluate change in cardiovascular fitness, participants completed 
a graded exercise test to determine peak volume of oxygen consump-
tion (VO2peak) on a motorized treadmill and metabolic cart (Medical 
Graphics Ultima). Metabolic equivalent (MET) capacity was calcu-
lated by dividing the VO2peak in mL/kg/min by a standard resting meta-
bolic rate of 3.5 mL/kg/min. A physician-supervised, individualized 
ramp treadmill protocol was conducted whereby participants walked 
at a brisk pace with the speed based on their comfort and fitness. 
For lower fit individuals, the grade was increased at a rate of 1% per 
minute, and for higher fit individuals, the grade was increased at a rate 
of 2% per minute. Heart rate, rhythm, BP, and oxygen uptake were 
monitored during the test and throughout a 6-minute recovery period.
Statistical Analyses
Means and standard deviations as well as frequency distributions 
were used to describe participant characteristics, whereas group 
differences for the network metrics and peak MET capacity were 
evaluated via general linear models. In these analyses, the pretest 
for each outcome variable was used as a covariate enabling us to 
examine group differences by comparing least squared means at the 
time of follow-up testing. Sex was also used as a covariate in the 
peak MET capacity analysis because it is well known that men have 
higher MET capacities than women. A natural log transformation 
was employed to normalize the network metric data prior to con-
ducting the general linear models because the raw data for these 
metrics were not normally distributed.
Results
Descriptive characteristics for the study sample can be found in 
Table 1. The two experimental groups of older adults were equivalent 
in age, distribution by sex, body mass index, years of education, and 
resting systolic BP.
Intervention Adherence
Participants were asked to complete 18 exercise sessions over a 
period of 6 weeks; 85% of the participants (22 of 26) had 100% 
attendance. Two individuals in the BRJ group had adherence rates 
of 89% and 96%, whereas two individuals in the placebo group had 
adherence rates of 83% and 96%. The first 4 weeks were used to 
acclimatize participants to treadmill walking at an RPE of 12–13 for 
50 minutes three times each week. From Weeks 5 to 18, the mean 
(SD) distance walked each session for the BRJ group was 2.46 miles 
(0.52), whereas it was 2.45 miles (0.44) for the placebo group, a 
nonsignificant difference (p = .68).
Supplement Adherence
Based on daily log data, 23 of 26 participants were 100% adher-
ent to supplement intake. One person in the placebo group had an 
adherence rate of 86%, whereas two participants in the BRJ group 
had rates of 98%.
Nitrate/Nitrite Response to Supplement 
Consumption
Analysis of the blood samples revealed that the groups had similar 
levels of nitrate and nitrite at baseline before beverage consump-
tion (26 ± 28 mM nitrate for Placebo and 84 ± 72 mM nitrate for 
BRJ, and 0.15 ± 0.07 mM nitrite for Placebo and 0.18 ± 0.10 mM 
nitrite for BRJ). Nitrate/nitrite levels after consumption of BRJ 
were much higher than for placebo: 21 ± 8 mM nitrate for 
Placebo and 422 ± 127 mM nitrate for BRJ, and 0.14 ± 0.07 mM 
nitrite for Placebo and 0.32 ± 0.18 mM nitrite BRJ; p < .001 for 
group differences for both nitrate and nitrite levels. The nitrite/
nitrate data are the average levels before and after taking BRJ on 
each clinic visit.
Peak MET Capacity
Table 2 provides the raw means for the peak MET data by treatment 
group and time of assessment along with the least squared means 
which represent adjusted posttest scores controlling for the peak 
MET value at the time of pretesting and participants’ sex. A general 
linear model showed a group effect that approached, but did not 
achieve, significance (p = .11) for the exercise + BRJ group to have 
higher MET capacity following exercise training than exercise + pla-
cebo with a partial eta2 of .11.

 placebo and BRJ groups. For these images, the calibration bar rep-
resents the consistency (SI) of the motor community across partici-
pants. As depicted in Figure 1, the high values represent maximal 
consistency in the population while the low values represent lower 
consistency across participants.
The community in the somatomotor cortex included the primary 
motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and midline supplementary 
motor regions. As seen in Figure 1 and the log transformed means, 
the motor community was more consistent for participants follow-
ing exercise training in the BRJ group (MBRJ = −2.27, SE = 0.145, 
MPlacebo = −2.89, SE = 0.156). Indeed this comparison was statistically 
significant, F(1,23) = 8.65, p = .007, and represents a large effect size 
(eta2 = 0.27); see descriptive data in Table 3.
To show how the motor functional community interacted with 
other brain regions, second-order connectivity analyses between the 
somatomotor cortex and the insula were performed. The adjusted 
treatment means (SE) in Table 4 shows that the number of second-
order connections between these regions was significantly lower 
following treatment in the BRJ condition (M = 29.82, SE = 9.5) 
compared with placebo (M = 68.42, SE = 10.3), F(1,23) = 6.67, 
p = .017. Once again the effect size for this comparison was large, 
eta2 = 0.225.
Discussion
We examined changes in functional brain networks associated with 
exercise + BRJ supplementation in older adults with a focus on the 
somatomotor cortex. In support of our primary hypothesis, we 
found that the motor community structure was more consistent in 
older adults in the exercise + BRJ supplementation group as com-
pared with exercise + placebo. In addition, the number of connec-
tions between the somatomotor cortex and insula was much lower 
in the BRJ than placebo group following the intervention. Although 
the group difference for peak MET capacity was not statistically 
significant, the data did trend in the expected direction, with those 
in the exercise + BRJ group having a nonsignificantly higher peak 
MET capacity than exercise + placebo. To our knowledge, this is the 
first experiment to test the combined effects of exercise and BRJ on 
functional brain networks in the motor cortex and secondary con-
nections of the motor cortex with the insula.
Brain plasticity refers to the phenomenon of altered neural struc-
ture, function, and connections in response to environmental or bod-
ily demands (28). While neuroplasticity was once thought to be a 
phenomenon of younger brains, scientists have recognized that this 
process also occurs within the aging human brain (1). Specifically, 
cognitive interventions, aerobic exercise, and other interventions 
have recently been shown to affect brain structure and function of 
older adults (1,9,29–31). We hypothesized that BRJ might enhance 
neuroplasticity based on the fact that BRJ enhances exercise toler-
ance and performance (5,14–16) and modulates CBF, at least in an 
acute setting (4,20). Here, we show that BRJ, when used in conjunc-
tion with exercise, facilitates brain plasticity of somatomotor brain 
regions as compared with exercise + placebo alone. The fact that we 
observed trends, as opposed to statistically significant group differ-
ences in peak MET capacity, is likely due to the small sample size 
and the relatively brief period of training—6 weeks.
The discovery of greater consistency within the motor commu-
nity in older adults who had exercised regularly while ingesting BRJ 
is consistent with Hugenschmidt and colleagues’ findings (21). In 
their study, functional brain networks were compared between three 
groups of older adults with varying levels of mobility as determined 
by the SPPB. They found decreased consistency in the somatomotor 
cortex among the lowest mobility group of older adults as compared 
with young adults. Of additional interest are our findings of a greater 
number of connections between the somatomotor cortex and insula

 in the placebo group. The insula has many functions, such as the 
integration of visual, somatosensory, vestibular, and cognitive input, 
which are all essential for optimal mobility (21). Hugenschmidt and 
colleagues observed an association between decreased mobility func-
tion and enhanced connectivity between the somatomotor cortex 
and a region including the posterior insula (21). They suggest that 
low levels of mobility may result in increasing such compensatory 
connections between the motor cortex and insula. In our study, par-
ticipants in the exercise + placebo group showed an average number 
of secondary connections similar to the prior reported population 
with mid-level SPPB scores (21). Our participants who had exercised 
and consumed BRJ for 6 weeks had an average number of second-
ary connections comparable with the younger population (mean 
age = 26.4 years) in that same study. Although we cannot suggest 
that the exercise + BRJ resulted in brain health or mobility similar to 
the younger adults, the data do suggest that the combination of BRJ 
with exercise resulted in neuroplasticity that substantially exceeded 
exercise alone.
BRJ is clearly an encouraging nutritional supplement that may 
improve functional health in older adults, and the proposed primary 
mechanism of benefit of BRJ is the rise in plasma nitrite caused by 
the high levels of dietary nitrate in BRJ (32). Consumed nitrate, once 
absorbed from the intestine, is taken up from the plasma by salivary 
glands and concentrated in saliva; nitrate is subsequently reduced to 
nitrite by oral bacteria and ultimately absorbed into the circulatory 
system (32,33). Nitrite appears to be reduced to NO during hypoxia. 
NO is an antioxidant and a potent vasodilator (34,35), is a critical 
relaxation factor synthesized in endothelial cells (36,37), and is key 
to vascular compliance. For this study, we hypothesized that reduc-
tions in brain blood flow associated with hypertension and aging-
associated leukoaraiosis result in low-grade hypoxia (38) and that 
these reductions might be offset by the NO-mediated vasodilation 
in hypoxic regions due to the increased amount of circulating nitrite 
from the BRJ ingestion. Indeed, results from our lab have shown 
that 24 hours of a high nitrate diet supplemented with a single dose 
of BRJ leads to increased regional CBF in older adults (39). Coupled 
with exercise (a hypoxia-inducing activity), we propose that the bio-
logical mechanism underlying the neural plasticity shown in Figure 1 
resulted from increased NO bioavailability after drinking BRJ.
Of note, some studies have suggested that there may be a risk, 
although unlikely, of cancer from having a diet that is very high in 
nitrates. A recent review panel sponsored by the NIH recently pub-
lished a review of dietary nitrate and cardiovascular disease and con-
cluded that the very low cancer risk seems to be with meat and very 
high levels from water sources of nitrate, but not vegetable sources, 
like beetroot juice (40).
This study has limitations. For example, as noted earlier, the 
treatment was relatively brief (6 weeks), and the sample size was 
small. In addition, for financial reasons, we were not able to design 
a full factorial study crossing BRJ supplementation (yes/no) with 
exercise training (yes/no). Finally, the population validity of these 
findings is restricted to older adults with controlled hypertension.
In summary, despite limitations, we believe our findings are 
compelling and warrant a large-scale clinical trial given the aging 
of the population, the concerns in geriatric medicine related to 
both physical functioning and brain health, and the growing 
interest in nutritional supplements. We know that exercise pro-
motes both structural and functional neuroplasticity and that BRJ 
improves exercise performance (1,3,7,15,19). In the current study, 
we observed that exercise + BRJ improved functional connections 
within the motor community and resulted in fewer compensatory 
connections between the motor cortex and insula than exercise + 
placebo. Although the data on peak MET capacity did not reach 
conventional levels of statistical significance, the fact the exercise 
+ BRJ resulted in an improvement over exercise + placebo by 0.44 
in peak MET capacity is notable and clearly has potential clinical 
relevance. In future studies, we would also recommend that inves-
tigators include novel motor-based tasks that involve mobility with 
cognitive decision making and/or agility.
