In Brief
Genital herpesvirus infections cause
urinary and gastrointestinal retention,
which is poorly understood. Using a
mouse model of genital infection, Khoury-
Hanold et al. demonstrate that HSV
spreads via nociceptors to the enteric
nervous system (ENS). The resulting
neutrophil-mediated ENS destruction
and loss of peristalsis lead to toxic
megacolon and death.

SUMMARY
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a leading cause of
genital herpes, infects oral or genital mucosal epithe-
lial cells before infecting the peripheral sensory ner-
vous system. The spread of HSV-1 beyond the
sensory nervous system and the resulting broader
spectrum of disease are not well understood. Using
a mouse model of genital herpes, we found that
HSV-1-infection-associated lethality correlated with
severe fecal and urinary retention. No inflammation
or infection of the brain was evident. Instead,
HSV-1 spread via the dorsal root ganglia to the auto-
nomic ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in
the colon. ENS infection led to robust viral gene tran-
scription, pathological inflammatory responses, and
neutrophil-mediated destruction of enteric neurons,
ultimately resulting in permanent loss of peristalsis
and the development of toxic megacolon. Laxative
treatment rescued mice from lethality following gen-
ital HSV-1 infection. These results reveal an unex-
pected pathogenesis of HSV associated with ENS
infection.
INTRODUCTION
Herpesvirus infections are among the most common human
viral infections in the world and persist for the life of the host
(Virgin et al., 2009). Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and
HSV-2, respectively) infect the epithelial cells of the oral or gen-
ital mucosa before infecting the peripheral sensory nervous
system. Within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), they establish a
latent infection that periodically reactivates to spread to the
next susceptible individual. The successful implementation of
this strategy requires that these viruses evade immune clear-
ance and avoid causing excessive damage to host tissues.
This is particularly important given that sensory neurons are
non-renewable.
Historically, HSV-1 and HSV-2 are associated with oral and
genital herpes, respectively. However, in many Western nations,
HSV-1 recently surpassed HSV-2 as the leading cause of genital
herpes infections (Malkin, 2004). Furthermore, the World Health
Organization estimates that, in addition to the 417 million people
with genital HSV-2 infections, there are �140 million people
living with genital HSV-1 infections (Looker et al., 2015a,
2015b). Following genital herpes infection, patients typically
report recurrent, painful lesions that develop on and around
the genitals, although viral reactivation and shedding also
frequently occur in the absence of these symptoms (Wald
et al., 1995). Despite the high prevalence of genital HSV-1 and
HSV-2 infections, the ability of these viruses to spread beyond
the sensory nervous system and the resulting broader spectrum
of disease is not well understood.
Primary genital HSV-2 infections cause acute sensory defects,
urinary retention, and constipation (Caplan et al., 1977; Goodell
et al., 1983). Despite the fact that up to 15% of women report uri-
nary retention following HSV-2 infection (Whitely et al., 1998), the
exact mechanism remains unclear. Price and Notkins hypothe-
sized that if a neurotropic virus spread to and replicated within
the peripheral autonomic ganglia, this might result in further viral
spread to the innervated ‘‘target’’ tissue and subsequent disrup-
tion in neuronal signaling or tissue atrophy due to lack of innerva-
tion (Price, 1977). Any of these scenarios would be predicted to
negatively impact normal tissue function.
Although humans are the only natural hosts for HSV-1 and
HSV-2, mouse models of genital HSV infection mimic some as-
pects of human disease, including urinary bladder retention
(Parr and Parr, 2003; Reinert et al., 2012). In the current study,
we used this model to investigate viral spread throughout the pe-
ripheral nervous system and its impact on the corresponding
innervated tissues. We found that following infection of DRG
sensory neurons, HSV-1 spreads to the enteric nervous system
(ENS) and causes neutrophil-mediated neuronal damage leading
to the loss of intestinal peristalsis and the development of toxic
megacolon. Comparing the transcriptomes of the infected
DRG and intestinal musculara, which contains the ENS, we
showed that viral gene transcription is limited and incomplete
in the DRG, whereas the viral genome is fully transcribed in the
gut wall. Finally, mice treated with a laxative or a neutrophil-
depleting antibody were protected from lethal HSV-1 infection.
These results implicate enteric neuron infection and destruction
in the disease pathogenesis of genital herpes, highlight the
distinct consequences of a tissue-mismatched response to an

 otherwise non-lethal virus, and suggest a possible expansion of
the disease spectrum for HSV in humans.
RESULTS
Genital Herpes Infection Causes Colonic Dysmotility
and Megacolon
HSV-1 is now the leading cause of genital herpes infections
in many Western nations (Malkin, 2004), but its disease spectrum
is poorly understood (Looker et al., 2015a). Therefore, we used
a mouse model of genital HSV-1 infection to study disease path-
ogenesis. Following vaginal infection with 104 plaque-forming
units (PFU), 106 PFU, or 108 PFU of HSV-1, �10%, 30%, or
60% of infected mice succumbed to infection, respectively (Fig-
ure 1A). Viral loads in the vaginal mucosa of mice infected with
either 106 or 108 PFU HSV-1 were identical 1 day postinfection
(d.p.i.) and did not predict lethality (Figures S1A–S1C). We
decided to use 106 PFU HSV-1, because this allowed us to
study the susceptible and resistant mice with a single inoculum
dose.
Prior reports show that mice develop hindlimb paralysis
following genital HSV-2 infection (Fleck et al., 1993; Parr et al.,
1994). Consistent with previous studies (Reinert et al., 2012), we
detected both viral antigen (Figure S1D) and replication-compe-
tent virus in the brain stems (Figure S1F) of HSV-2-infected
mice, indicating that CNS infection occurs after HSV-2 infection.
In contrast, we did not observe hindlimb paralysis in HSV-1-in-
fected C57BL/6 mice at any dose tested (data not shown).
Further, we did not detect viral antigen, signs of inflammation,
or replication-competent virus in the brain stem of HSV-1-in-
fected mice (Figures S1D and S1E) (Yordy et al., 2012), suggest-
ing an alternate pathogenesis. Instead, a surprising correlate of
lethality was that mice infected with HSV-1 developed toxic meg-
acolon, which we defined as a > 2-fold increase in the weight of
the colon due to fecal retention (Figure 1B), as well as urinary
bladder retention (Figure 1C). To delineate the two groups,
HSV-1-infected mice that develop megacolon will be depicted
by orange symbols, whereas infected mice that do not develop
megacolon and survive the infection will be depicted as blue sym-
bols, where applicable. Notably, all the mice that died of HSV-1

 infection developed megacolon (Figure 1D). Mice infected with
HSV-2 also uniformly developed megacolon and urinary bladder
retention following vaginal infection (Figures S1G and S1H).
To formally assess gastrointestinal (GI) motility, we measured
the time required for a dye (carmine red), administered by oral
gavage, to transit the length of the GI tract. By 7 d.p.i., we
observed a significant increase in GI transit time (Figure 1E), indi-
cating a defect in peristalsis. This GI dysmotility predicted sub-
sequent mortality in a majority of mice (Figure 1F). To determine
where along the GI tract this defect in peristalsis occurs, mice
were fed a non-absorbable and non-digestible high-molecular-
weight fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (FD70) (Tsuka-
moto et al., 2011). In control mice, peak fluorescence activity
was detected in the proximal and mid sections of the large intes-
tine 2.5 hr after oral feeding of FD70 (Figure 1G). In contrast,
HSV-1-infected mice displayed an accumulation of FD70 in the
small intestine, suggesting a defect in the passage of luminal
contents from the small intestine to the large intestine (Figure 1G).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that genital HSV infec-
tion results in severe colonic dysmotility and megacolon.
Lethality Following Genital HSV-1 Infection Is Due to
Toxic Megacolon
Our data indicated that GI dysmotility and the development of
megacolon are correlated with mortality (Figure 1D). To test the
causality of megacolon in lethality, we treated mice with an os-
motic laxative by replacing the drinking water with a 15% (w/v)
polyethylene glycol (PEG; MiraLAX) solution. Laxative treatment
fully restored normal GI transit times in HSV-1-infected mice
(Figure 1H) and resulted in a 100% survival rate (Figure 1I). On
the other hand, laxative treatment did not rescue mice from lethal
HSV-2 infection, despite restoration of normal GI transit times
(Figures S1I and S1J). Taken together, these data indicate that
the primary cause of death following genital HSV-1 infection is
due to not encephalitis but rather toxic megacolon.
HSV-1 Infection Spreads to the Enteric Nervous System
Following vaginal infection, HSV-2 spreads to distal neuronal
sites such as the sensory neurons of the DRG and the autonomic
neurons of the paracervical ganglia and the sympathetic chain
(Parr and Parr, 2003). However, the pattern of HSV-1 spread is
unknown. It was also unclear whether HSV-1-induced megaco-
lon was the result of viral spread to the spine and subsequent
disruption in signaling to the intestines or whether the virus could
spread directly to the intestines and disrupt autonomic signaling
in situ. To address this question, we measured viral titers from
multiple tissues following vaginal HSV-1 infection (Figure 2A).
Within 2 days, HSV-1 spread from the vagina to the urinary
bladder, paracervical ganglia, and DRG. Subsequently, HSV-1
spread to the lumbosacral and, to a lesser extent, the cervical-
thoracic spinal cord. Notably, the highest viral load was detected
late during infection in the large intestine. Virus was not routinely
detected in the terminal ileum of the small intestine, the liver, or
the sympathetic chain. These data indicated that viral dissemi-
nation, while broad, was not systemic and was limited to a set
of tissues linked by adjacent epithelial cells or neuron-to-neuron
connections.
Given the high viral titers detected in the large intestine, we
next examined which cell types were infected with HSV-1. Immu-
nohistochemistry revealed that HSV antigen was confined to the
ENS, specifically the myenteric ganglia of the longitudinal
muscle, and was not present in either the submucosal or the
epithelial layers (Figure S2A). Abundant mononuclear and poly-
morphonuclear leukocyte recruitment to the longitudinal muscle
was also evident in the infected large intestine (Figure S2A). To
visualize the infected myenteric plexus more clearly, we imaged
the large intestine longitudinal muscle, which contains the myen-
teric plexuses, by whole-mount microscopy. Mock- and HSV-1-
infected mice with normal colons had a similar distribution of
myenteric neurons and glial cells with no detectable HSV-1 anti-
gen (Figures 2B and S2B). However, mice with viral-induced
megacolon showed a clear presence of HSV-1 within the enteric
ganglia at 7 d.p.i. (Figure 2B). By 9 d.p.i., HSV-1 staining was
mostly absent (Figure 2B), which coincided with the eventual
elimination of the virus from the large intestine at later time points
(Figure 2A). Strikingly, we also observed a paucity of neurons
throughout the mid and distal colon (Figure 2B). Indeed, electron
microscopy of the myenteric plexus 6 d.p.i. revealed swollen
mitochondria (arrows) and mature viral particles (arrowheads)
within degenerating neurons (Figures 2C1–2C4) (Chu-Wang
and Oppenheim, 1978). Furthermore, mature viral particles
were occasionally observed in adjacent smooth muscle cells
(Figure 2C5). Finally, we observed phagocytic polymorphonu-
clear cells engulfing infected cell debris (Figure 2C6). Taken
together, these results indicate that HSV-1 infects the auto-
nomic ganglia of the ENS and the surrounding smooth muscle,
resulting in neuronal damage. These data suggest that GI dys-
motility is due to either immune-mediated inhibition of peristalsis
(Boeckxstaens and de Jonge, 2009) or viral-induced neuronal
cell death.
Nociceptors Are Necessary for HSV-1 Spread to the ENS
Given that HSV-1 was detected in multiple neuronal and non-
neuronal sites, we next sought to determine the route by which
virus spreads from the vagina to the ENS. To examine whether
nociceptors are required for HSV-1 spread to the large intestine,
we used resiniferatoxin (RTX), a capsaicin analog that selectively
binds the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V
member 1 (TRPV1) receptor, to ablate peripheral nociceptors
(Riol-Blanco et al., 2014). Treatment with RTX abrogated noxious
heat sensation (Figure S3A), thus indicating successful nocicep-
tor ablation. While RTX treatment did not affect HSV-1 infection
and replication within the vaginal epithelium (Figure 3A), it pre-
vented virus from reaching the DRG (Figure 3B). Subsequent
viral spread to the large intestine (Figure 3C) and viral-induced
GI dysmotility, megacolon, and mortality (Figures 3D–3F) were
also prevented following RTX treatment. These data indicated
that neuronal spread (rather than epithelial cell spread) via
peripheral TRPV1+ nociceptors is required for HSV-1 to spread
from the vagina to the large intestine. Furthermore, blocking
HSV-1 entry into the peripheral sensory nervous system pre-
vented viral-induced GI dysmotility and megacolon.
Robust Viral Gene Transcription in the Intestinal
Musculara, but Not the DRG
Our findings suggested that enteric neurons are susceptible to
damage and elimination during an HSV-1 infection (Figure 2).
In contrast, sensory DRG neurons are resistant to viral-induced

 cell death and are not eliminated by HSV infection (Yordy et al.,
2012) or cytotoxic T cell infiltration (Simmons and Tscharke,
1992). This raised the intriguing possibility that there are tissue-
specific strategies that mitigate neuronal damage in the DRG
but are absent in the ENS. To better understand these underlying
differences, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis
on the DRG and the large intestine musculara containing the ENS
6 days after HSV-1 infection. To analyze the viral transcriptome,
sequenced reads from each tissue were first mapped to the hu-
man herpesvirus 1 genome (GenBank: NC_001806.1). The num-
ber of reads mapping to each nucleotide position are displayed

(Figure 4A). Robust and complete viral tran-
scription through all known HSV-1 coding
regions was observed in the large intestine
musculara of mice with virus-induced meg-
acolon (Figure 4A, outer track). However,
sequence analysis of the infected DRGs re-
vealed that viral transcription through mul-
tiple coding regions was less robust or, in
some cases, undetectable (Figure 4A, inner
track). Furthermore, when compared to
mock levels, approximately half of the
beta (early) and gamma (late) genes failed
to reach statistical significance in the
DRG (Figure 4B), whereas all HSV-1 genes were significantly ex-
pressed in the large intestine musculara (Figure 4C). These data
indicate that HSV-1 transcription and replication is restricted in
sensory, but not enteric, neurons.
Distinct Inflammatory Consequences of HSV-1 Infection
in the DRG versus the Large Intestine Musculara
We next sought to analyze the host response to HSV-1 infection.
Comparing control mice to those with virus-induced megacolon,
we observed 2,884 downregulated and 2,882 upregulated genes
that reached statistical significance in the large intestine
792

 musculara. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to categorize
the downregulated genes, we observed that canonical pathways
pertaining to neuronal signaling such as ‘‘calcium signaling,’’
‘‘axonal guidance signaling,’’ and ‘‘cardiac b-adrenergic sig-
naling’’ were enriched, which is consistent with a defect in
autonomic neuronal signaling and smooth muscle peristalsis
(Figure S4A). Indeed, genes encoding multiple neurotransmitter
receptor subunits were significantly downregulated in the large
intestine musculara following HSV-1 infection (Figure 5A). The
most highly enriched upregulated pathways revealed a signature
indicative of innate immune responses to viral infection such
as pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and antigen receptor
signaling (Figure S4A). Indeed, many interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were
highly upregulated, including the neutrophil chemokines Cxcl1,
Cxcl2, Cxcl3, and Cxcl5 and their receptor, Cxcr2 (Figure 5A).
By comparison, the transcriptional response in the HSV-1-
infected DRG was muted: only 8 genes were significantly down-
regulated, and 473 genes were significantly upregulated. IPA

canonical pathway analysis revealed a
T cell signature within the infected DRGs
(Figures S4B and 5B). In contrast to the in-
testinal musculara, only a limited number
of chemokine genes were upregulated in
the DRG, specifically those related to
effector T cell (e.g., Cxcl9, Cxcl10) and
monocyte (e.g., Ccl2) recruitment (Fig-
ure 5B). Notably, there was a paucity of
genes encoding chemokines involved in
neutrophil recruitment, ISGs, and innate
sensors in the DRG. Taken together, these
results suggest that in response to the
same viral infection, these two tissues
engage markedly different immune re-
sponses. Whereas signatures of T cell
recruitment and activation dominate the
DRG response, the intestinal musculara exhibits a hyper-inflam-
matory response conducive to leukocyte recruitment.
Neutrophils Contribute to Immunopathology and
Megacolon
Our RNA-seq findings indicated that HSV-1 infection of the DRG
and intestinal musculara resulted in two distinct host gene signa-
tures. Therefore, we further analyzed the host response by as-
sessing immune cell recruitment to these infected tissues by
flow cytometry. In line with the robust T cell gene expression
signature in both tissues following HSV-1 infection, we detected
a modest increase in activated CD4+CD44+ and CD8+CD44+
T cells 6 d.p.i. (Figures S5A and S5B) and a significant increase
by 9 d.p.i. in both the DRG and the large intestine musculara (Fig-
ures 6A and 6B). In addition, there was a significant increase in
CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the large intestine mus-
culara (Figure 6C) consistent with an excessive inflammatory
environment. However, distinct patterns of leukocyte recruit-
ment between the DRG and large intestine musculara emerged.
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 788–799, June 8, 2016
793
 By 9 d.p.i., with the exception of a modest increase in inflamma-
tory monocytes and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), the
number of innate leukocytes in the DRG returned to baseline
(Figures S5D–S5F and 6D–6F). In contrast, we observed a signif-
icant increase in the number of inflammatory monocytes, cDCs,
natural killer (NK) cells, and neutrophils in the intestinal muscu-
lara (Figures S5D–S5G and 6D–6G).
Given the influx of inflammatory leukocytes into the infected
large intestine (Figures S2A, S5, and 6), we hypothesized that
HSV-1 infection of the ENS might result in disrupted enteric
neuron signaling to smooth muscles via two non-mutually exclu-
sive mechanisms: (1) viral replication (Kramer and Enquist, 2012)
or inflammation (Boeckxstaens and de Jonge, 2009) would
disrupt neuronal signaling, or (2) viral infection and replication
would result in neuronal cell death. Both of these scenarios
would ultimately result in GI dysmotility. Therefore, to begin to
assess the potential role for immune-mediated GI dysmotility,
we infected Rag2�/� mice with HSV-1 and determined that the
adaptive immune system was dispensable for HSV-1-induded
megacolon (Figure S5H) and lethality (Figure S5I). However,
T and B cells were required for protection against a neuro-atten-
uated strain of HSV-1 (Figure S5I), as previously described (Leib
et al., 2009). These data indicated that while the adaptive im-
mune system is required for neuroprotection against HSV, it is
not required for the immunopathology observed in the ENS
following infection.
Given that neutrophils were recruited to the large intestine
musculara, but not to the DRG (Figures 6G and S5G), we
next sought to address their contribution to disease. Neutro-
phils were depleted using the anti-Ly6G (1A8) antibody (Daley
et al., 2008) beginning 5 d.p.i. Neutrophil depletion had no ef-
fect on viral replication in the genital tract (Figure S6A). Further-
more, this treatment did not prevent viral infection of the large
intestine (Figure S6B) and the development of HSV-1-induced
GI dysmotility at 8 d.p.i. (Figure 7A). However, mice depleted

predicted subsequent lethality in �90%

depletion improved the odds of surviving
this episode of GI dysmotility by �5-fold
(Figure 7B). Surviving mice that suffered
transient colonic dysmotility recovered
normal GI motility 2 weeks after infection
in the absence of neutrophils (Figure 7C). To explore how
neutrophil-depleted mice recover GI motility following HSV-1
infection of the myenteric plexus, we used whole-mount micro-
scopy to image the ENS. In the absence of neutrophils, the
ENS remained intact, whereas the ganglia of control-treated
mice were eliminated during infection (Figure 7D). These data
indicate that in the absence of neutrophils, viral replication or
inflammation in the musculara leads to a transient period of
GI dysmotility, which eventually recovers following viral clear-
ance. However, in the presence of neutrophils, further destruc-
tion of the ENS by neutrophils leads to toxic megacolon and
death.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that HSV-1 infection in mice results
in lethality due to toxic megacolon. Following replication in the
vaginal epithelium, HSV-1 infects the innervating sensory neu-
rons of the DRG. At this site, viral gene transcription was
confined, leading to the induction of a small set of host-response
genes that recruited and maintained T cells. In approximately
one-third of infected mice, HSV-1 infection spread from the
DRG to the ENS. Here, HSV-1 infection resulted in extensive
viral gene transcription and viral replication. This led to the
induction of a large number of host-response genes, including
inflammatory chemokines. Consequently, neutrophils were re-
cruited to the large intestine musculara and mediated the
destruction of the enteric ganglia. In the absence of neutrophils,
viral infection or inflammation led to a transient inhibition of
peristalsis, which later recovered following viral clearance, and
ultimately led to improved survival rates. Alternatively, chronic
treatment with an osmotic laxative bypassed the need for an
intact ENS and prevented the development of toxic megacolon
and lethality. Our results indicate that distinct peripheral
neuronal tissues vary in their capacity to restrict HSV-1 and limit

 immunopathology, thus revealing an unexpected disease mech-
anism following genital herpes infection.
In contrast to our findings, previous studies have shown that
BALB/c mice infected with HSV-1 develop lethal encephalitis
following infection via the oral (Kastrukoff et al., 1986) or intraper-
itoneal routes (Lopez, 1975). However, this does not occur in
C57BL/6 mice, which are generally more resistant to CNS dis-
ease (Kastrukoff et al., 1986; Lopez, 1975). Curiously, HSV-1 in-
fected the vagus nerve following oral infection in BALB/c mice
(Gesser and Koo, 1996; Gesser et al., 1994), leading to enceph-
alitis. In these susceptible mice, the infected vagus nerve would
provide the virus a direct neuronal path to both the brain stem
and the ENS of the upper GI tract. However, following vaginal
infection in C57BL/6 mice, HSV-1 must first infect sensory neu-
rons before transmitting to sacral spinal neurons of the dorsal
horns. We speculate that in a more resistant mouse strain,

 such as C57BL/6, HSV-1 is restricted from spreading from the
lumbosacral spinal cord to the brain stem due to cell-intrinsic
(Yordy et al., 2012) or cell-extrinsic (Johnson et al., 2008; Knick-
elbein et al., 2008) mechanisms and instead spreads to the ENS.
Our data indicate that TRPV1+ nociceptors are required for
viral spread from the genital tract to the ENS of the large intes-
tine. These results support two possible routes that might result
in the transfer of virus from the genital tract to the ENS. A first
possibility is that HSV-1 is transported via the DRG to the lumbo-
sacral spinal cord. From there, virus could spread transsynapti-
cally to any one of several spinal neurons that provide extrinsic
signaling to the intestines (Brookes et al., 2013). The second
possible route predicts that HSV-1 infects a subpopulation of
nociceptive DRG neurons that simultaneously extend axons
into both genitourinary and intestinal tissues (Chaban et al.,
2007; Christianson et al., 2007). Therefore, these ‘‘dichoto-
mizing’’ neurons provide a direct link for virus to transmit be-
tween the female reproductive tract and the large intestine.
Future studies that clarify how the virus spreads from the DRG
to the ENS might help to explain why only a subset of HSV-1-in-
fected mice developed megacolon.
Comparing the HSV-1-infected DRG to the ENS, our transcrip-
tome analysis revealed striking differences in both viral and host
gene expression. Viral gene expression in the ENS was robust
across all known coding regions of the genome. In the DRG,
on the other hand, transcription through many coding regions
was undetectable, and mRNA expression of many of the early
and late genes failed reach statistical significance. This pattern
of viral gene expression is indicative of abortive replication but
may ultimately serve to limit the induction of pathological pro-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as seen in the large in-
testine musculara. Indeed, the DRG recruited activated T cells in
response to infection, which are required to limit viral replication
and cell death (Simmons and Tscharke, 1992) and restricted the
entry of neutrophils (Figure 6G) (Stock et al., 2014). The intestinal
musculara, on the other hand, supported the recruitment of both
T cells and neutrophils. In this regard, it appears that the mech-
anisms controlling leukocyte recruitment to the gut wall are more
similar to those of the skin or vagina (Shin and Iwasaki, 2013;
Stock et al., 2014). Our data demonstrate the importance of
barring neutrophil recruitment to the peripheral nervous system,
given that lytic viral infection of the ENS is not the primary cause
of neuronal destruction, and suggest it is the immunopathology
inflicted by activated neutrophils that causes agangliosis and
toxic megacolon. Surprisingly, neutrophil-depleted mice recov-
ered from transient virus-induced or inflammation-induced GI
dysmotility and ultimately restored motility in the large intestine.
Understanding the process of neuronal repair and restoration in
this model might shed light on the treatment of idiopathic gastro-
intestinal motility disorders.
Figure 7. Depletion of Neutrophils Rescues Mice from HSV-1-Induced Mortality
Beginning 5 d.p.i., mice were treated with 500 mg anti-Ly6G neutrophil depleting antibody (1A8) or isotype control (IgG) every other day.

assessment could take place. Data are shown as mean ± SEM and are pooled from 4-5 independent experiments totaling 8–32 mice per group. Statistical
significance was measured by a Mann-Whitney test (exact) (A) or by a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (B), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001; ns, not

 Orally acquired HSV-1 can spread to multiple sensory and
autonomic ganglia, thus demonstrating a broad neuronal
tropism throughout the head, neck, and torso (Arbusow et al.,
2010; Richter et al., 2009; Warren et al., 1978). Furthermore,
studies have shown that both primary infection and reactivation
of latent HSV-1 can cause paralysis of the vagus nerve (e.g.,
trouble swallowing and vocalizing) (Bachor et al., 1996) and her-
pes esophagitis (Canalejo Castrillero et al., 2010). However, the
clinical prevalence and implications of HSV-1 infection in the
sacral ganglia and ENS remain understudied. While small-scale
studies have linked the presence of herpesvirus family members
to chronic idiopathic pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), HSV is only oc-
casionally detected in patient samples (De Giorgio et al., 2010;
Debinski et al., 1997). A direct causal link between HSV infection
and chronic intestinal motility disorders might be difficult to draw
because the virus may be cleared from the ENS before the diag-
nosis is made. Our findings suggest that future clinical studies
should assay patients for the presence of HSV at the onset of
GI dysmotility before viral clearance takes place. Taken together,
our current results and previous clinical evidence suggest an
underappreciated role for HSV infection of the ENS in intes-
tinal motility disorders in humans, and extends the disease spec-
trum of HSV beyond the genital mucosa and sensory nervous
system.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
C57BL/6 (B6) female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories or
the National Cancer Institute and subsequently bred and housed at Yale Uni-
versity. Rag2�/� mice were bred and housed at Yale University. All animal pro-
cedures were performed in compliance with Yale Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee protocols.
Viruses and In Vivo Infections
Wild-type (D68HR) HSV-1 (strain 17syn+) and beclin binding domain deletion
virus (D68H) (strain 17syn+) were kind gifts from Dr. David Leib (Geisel School
of Medicine at Dartmouth) (Leib et al., 2009). Wild-type HSV-2 (strain 186syn+)
was a kind gift from Dr. David Knipe (Harvard Medical School). All HSV strains
were maintained and propagated using Vero cells. In vivo infections were
performed as previously described (Shin and Iwasaki, 2012). Briefly, 5- to
8-week-old female mice were treated with Depo-Provera (GE Healthcare).
Five to seven days later, the vaginal lumen was cleared of mucous with a
Calginate swab (Fischer Scientific) and 10 mL containing 106 PFU, unless
otherwise noted, of virus were delivered into the vaginal lumen with a pipette.
Viral titers from indicated homogenized tissues were determined by a standard
plaque assay using Vero cells as described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Measuring GI motility
To measure the total GI transit time, mice were orally gavaged with a 6% w/v
carmine red (Sigma), 0.5% methocellulose, and 0.9% NaCl solution. Mice
were monitored for at least 4.5 hr and the time required to pass the carmine
red dye in the feces was recorded. Alternatively, GI motility was measured us-
ing a non-digestible, non-absorbable high-molecular-weight FITC-labeled
dextran (FD70) as previously described (Tsukamoto et al., 2011). Briefly,
mice were fed a 10-mL bolus of FD70 and sacrificed 2.5 hr later. The entire
GI tract was dissected and separated into 13 sections: stomach, 8 sections
of small intestine, cecum, and 3 sections of large intestine. The small and large
intestines were each measured and divided into equal sections relative to their
total lengths. The contents of each section were opened in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf
tube with 800 mL PBS. After vigorous vortexing, the samples were clarified by
centrifugation and fluorescence was measured from the supernatants on a
SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) fluorescence plate reader.
Treatment with Osmotic Laxative
At time of infection, the drinking water was replaced with a 15% w/v solution of
MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350, Bayer) for the duration of the experiment.
Isolation of Large Intestine Musculara and Whole-Mount Microscopy
The musculara of the large intestine was isolated by micro-dissection as previ-
ously described (Gulbransen et al., 2012), fixed overnight at 4�C in Zamboni’s
fixative (American MasterTech), and stained for whole-mount microscopy as
previously described (Nasser et al., 2007). Briefly, following antigen retrieval
and blocking, samples were incubated with successive primary and secondary
antibody overnight at 4�C. Tissues were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade
mounting medium with DAPI (Life Technologies) and imaged using a Leica
TCS SP8 confocal microscope. Images were collected and uniformly processed
using the Leica Application Suite software. Further information and antibodies
used for staining are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Electron Microscopy
Following euthanasia, mice were perfused with a solution of Zamboni’s fixative
(American MasterTech) and 0.5% glutaraldehyde. DRG and large intestine
musculara were dissected and post-fixed overnight at 4�C. Following dehy-
dration, ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica ultramicrotome, collected on
Formvar-coated single-slot grids, and analyzed with a Tecnai 12 Biotwin elec-
tion microscope (FEI). Images were uniformly processed to enhance the
contrast using Photoshop CC (Adobe).
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Following euthanasia, mice were perfused with a 10% solution of neutral buff-
ered formalin. Tissues were post-fixed overnight at room temperature and then
stored in 70% ethanol. Slides were prepared from paraffin embedded blocks
and H&E stained or stained with anti-HSV-1/2 (Biocare Medical) by Amos
Brooks of the Yale Pathology Tissue Services lab.
Peripheral Ablation of Sensory Neurons
Resiniferatoxin (RTX) was used to denervate 5- to 6-week-old female mice as
previously described (Riol-Blanco et al., 2014). Briefly, mice were given esca-
lating (30 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) injections of RTX (subcutaneously)
over the course of 3 days. Control mice were treated with vehicle alone (DMSO
in PBS). Mice were then allowed to rest for 2 weeks before denervation was
confirmed by the tail-flick assay (Le Bars et al., 2001). Mice were subsequently
treated with Depo-Provera and infected with HSV-1 as described above.
Neutrophil Depletion
To deplete neutrophils, mice were treated every other day with 500 mg intraper-
itoneal anti-Ly6G (1A8, BioXCell) starting 5 d.p.i. and ending on 11 d.p.i.
Neutrophil depletion was confirmed in the peripheral blood 24 hr after the first
injection.
Detection of HSV Genome by qPCR
Dissected DRG were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at �80�C until further
processing. Tissues were thawed, and DNA was isolated using the DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Relative abundance of the HSV-1 genome to the host Tert gene was
determined by qPCR using primers listed in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
RNA-Seq and Analysis
Total RNA from the large intestine musculara was isolated using TRIzol
(Ambion) and further purified using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (QIAGEN),
both according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from the lumbo-
sacral DRG was isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (QIAGEN). Sam-
ples were further processed and sequenced at the Yale Center for Genome
Analysis. High-quality samples with a RIN score of at least 7.0 were sequenced
with a 150-bp paired end read using an Illumina 2500 HiSeq sequencer. Raw
sequence reads were trimmed of sequencing adaptors and low-quality re-
gions by btrim (Kong, 2011). The trimmed reads were mapped to the mouse
genome (GRCm38) by tophat2 (Kim et al., 2013), and the counts of reads for
each gene were based on Ensembl annotation (release 70). After the counts
were collected, the differential expression analysis was done by DEseq2
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 788–799, June 8, 2016
797
 (Love et al., 2014), which calculated the adjusted p values. Differentially ex-
pressed genes with at least a 2-fold difference in expression and an adjusted
p value < 0.05 were analyzed using IPA (QIAGEN). Volcano plots were con-
structed using ggplot2 in R with additional editing and annotating using Adobe
Illustrator. For HSV-1 genes, the trimmed reads were mapped to human
herpesvirus 1 genome (NC_001806.1) by bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg,
2012). The differential expression analysis was done by DEseq2 (Love et al.,
2014) using normalization factors from host RNA-seq data for each sample.
The Circos plot was generated as previously described (Krzywinski et al.,
2009) and further edited and annotated using Adobe Illustrator.
Flow Cytometry
Single-cell suspensions were prepared from isolated large intestine musculara
or DRG by digesting samples in a 2 mg/mL Collagenase D and 15 mg/mL
DNase I solution for 15 min (DRG) or 30 min (musculara) and extruded through
a 70-mm filter. Dead cells were labeled using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua
Dead Cell kit (Invitrogen). Cell number was determined by CountBright abso-
lute counting beads (Invitrogen). All samples were acquired on an LSRII equip-
ped with a 532-nm green laser (BD Biosciences), and all data were analyzed
using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Antibodies used for staining are listed in
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
