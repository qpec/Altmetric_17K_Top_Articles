Abstract
BACKGROUND—Andexanet alfa (andexanet) is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy 
protein that has been shown to reverse the inhibition of factor Xa in healthy volunteers.
METHODS—In this multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-group study, we evaluated 67 
patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after the administration of a factor Xa 
inhibitor. The patients all received a bolus of andexanet followed by a 2-hour infusion of the drug. 
Patients were evaluated for changes in measures of anti–factor Xa activity and were assessed for 
clinical hemostatic efficacy during a 12-hour period. All the patients were subsequently followed 
for 30 days. The efficacy population of 47 patients had a baseline value for anti–factor Xa activity 
of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or ≥0.5 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin) and had 
confirmed bleeding severity at adjudication.
RESULTS—The mean age of the patients was 77 years; most of the patients had substantial 
cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly gastrointestinal or intracranial. The mean 
(±SD) time from emergency department presentation to the administration of the andexanet bolus 
was 4.8±1.8 hours. After the bolus administration, the median anti– factor Xa activity decreased

 by 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 94) from baseline among patients receiving 
rivaroxaban and by 93% (95% CI, 87 to 94) among patients receiving apixaban. These levels 
remained similar during the 2-hour infusion. Four hours after the end of the infusion, there was a 
relative decrease from baseline of 39% in the measure of anti–factor Xa activity among patients 
receiving rivaroxaban and of 30% among those receiving apixaban. Twelve hours after the 
andexanet infusion, clinical hemostasis was adjudicated as excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients in 
the efficacy analysis (79%; 95% CI, 64 to 89). Thrombotic events occurred in 12 of 67 patients 
(18%) during the 30-day follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS—On the basis of a descriptive preliminary analysis, an initial bolus and 
subsequent 2-hour infusion of andexanet substantially reduced anti–factor Xa activity in patients 
with acute major bleeding associated with factor Xa inhibitors, with effective hemostasis occurring 
in 79%. (Funded by Portola Pharmaceuticals; ANNEXA-4 ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02329327.)
In randomized clinical trials, factor Xa inhibitors have been shown to be safe and effective 
for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism and for stroke prevention in 
patients with atrial fibrillation.1–4 However, factor Xa inhibitors have been associated with 
major and even fatal bleeding events.1–4 Such episodes of acute major bleeding may be 
difficult to treat because there is no reversal agent. Andexanet alfa (andexanet) has been 
designed and developed specifically to reverse the effects of both direct and indirect factor 
Xa inhibitors. It is a recombinant, modified human factor Xa decoy protein that binds factor 
Xa inhibitors but does not have intrinsic catalytic activity.5,6 In healthy older volunteers who 
were receiving either apixaban or rivaroxaban, a bolus and infusion of andexanet sharply 
reduced both the unbound fraction of the plasma level of factor Xa inhibitor and anti–factor 
Xa activity, with minimal serious adverse effects.7 The Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to 
the Anticoagulation Effects of FXA Inhibitors (ANNEXA-4) study was designed to evaluate 
the use of andexanet in patients with acute major bleeding that was potentially life-
threatening. This interim report describes the 67 patients for whom data were complete as of 
June 17, 2016.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
ANNEXA-4 is an ongoing, multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-group study of 
andexanet in patients with acute major bleeding. Starting on April 10, 2015, patients were 
enrolled at 20 centers in the United States, 1 center in the United Kingdom, and 1 center in 
Canada. The protocol and the statistical analysis plan are available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
Patients were eligible to participate in the preliminary analysis if they were at least 18 years 
of age and were reported to have received one of four factor Xa inhibitors - apixaban, 
rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or enoxaparin - within the past 18 hours (at a dose of at least 1 mg 
per kilogram of body weight per day for enoxaparin). Acute major bleeding was defined as 
one or more of the following features: potentially life-threatening acute overt bleeding with 
signs or symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (e.g., severe hypotension, poor skin

 perfusion, mental confusion, or low cardiac output that could not otherwise be explained); 
acute overt bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 g per deciliter or 
a hemoglobin level of 8 g per deciliter or less if no baseline hemoglobin level was available 
(or an investigator’s opinion that the hemoglobin level would fall to 8 g per deciliter or less); 
or acute symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ (e.g., retroperitoneal, intraarticular, 
pericardial, intracranial, or intramuscular with the compartment syndrome). All the patients 
provided written informed consent.
Key exclusion criteria were the scheduling of surgery within less than 12 hours after 
presentation (with the exception of a minimally invasive surgery or procedure); intracranial 
hemorrhage in a patient with a score of less than 7 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (which 
ranges from 15 [normal] to 3 [deep coma]) or an estimated intra-cerebral hematoma volume 
of more than 60 ml; expected survival of less than 1 month; the occurrence of a major 
thrombotic event within 2 weeks before enrollment; or receipt of one of the following agents 
within 7 days before screening: vitamin K antagonist, dabigatran, prothrombin complex 
concentrate, or whole blood or plasma. Details regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
STUDY TREATMENTS
Patients received an andexanet bolus during a period of 15 to 30 minutes, followed by a 2-
hour infusion of the drug. The following doses were used: for patients who had taken 
apixaban or rivaroxaban more than 7 hours before the administration of andexanet, the bolus 
dose was 400 mg and the infusion dose was 480 mg. For patients who had taken enoxaparin, 
edoxaban, or rivaroxaban 7 hours or less before the administration of the bolus dose or at an 
unknown time, the bolus dose was 800 mg and the infusion dose was 960 mg. These 
andexanet doses were selected because their use was associated with a rapid reversal of anti–
factor Xa activity of 80% or more in previous studies. The dosing efficacy was confirmed by 
means of pharmacokinetic modeling that took into account differences in plasma protein 
binding and extravascular distribution of the factor Xa inhibitors.5 The 2-hour duration of 
infusion was chosen to exceed the expected time to achieve a definitive hemostatic plug.8 
Investigators were encouraged to restart anticoagulant therapy as clinically indicated.
STUDT POPULATIONS AND OUTCOMES
The prespecified safety population included all the patients who received andexanet, and the 
efficacy population included only patients in whom the baseline anti–factor Xa activity was 
later determined to be 75 ng per milliliter or more (or ≥0.5 IU per milliliter for those 
receiving enoxaparin) and the acute major bleeding episode was later adjudicated to meet 
the study criteria. All analyses except those related to safety were performed in the efficacy 
population. The two coprimary outcomes were the percent change in the anti–factor Xa 
activity and the rate of excellent or good hemostatic efficacy 12 hours after the andexanet 
infusion. Anti–factor Xa activity was measured by means of a validated chromogenic assay 
of factor Xa enzymatic activity.

 STUDY ASSESSMENTS
Patients were assessed at the following times: 3 hours and 15 minutes before the 
administration of the andexanet bolus (baseline); at the end of bolus administration (15 to 30 
minutes after initiation); at the end of the 2-hour infusion; at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours 
after the end of the infusion; and at 3 days and 30 days. Blood samples were obtained to 
measure anti–factor Xa activity and the unbound fraction of the plasma level of factor Xa 
inhibitor during a 12-hour period. Endogenous thrombin potential was measured at baseline, 
at 8 hours, at 12 hours, and on day 3. Methods for measurement of these values have been 
described previously.7
For patients with intracranial hemorrhage, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed within 3 hours before the initiation of 
the andexanet bolus and at 1 hour, 12 hours, and 30 days after the end of the infusion. 
Patients with intracranial bleeding were evaluated at baseline with the use of the modified 
Rankin scale for global disability and handicap, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms or 
disability) to 6 (death).
All adverse events were collected throughout the 30-day study period. Thrombotic events 
were adjudicated according to prespecified criteria (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), and deaths were classified as cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular.
HEMOSTATIC EFFICACY
The independent adjudication committee reviewed each case to determine hemostatic 
efficacy on the basis of predetermined criteria (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Committee members also reviewed the eligibility of each patient. The hemostatic efficacy 
criteria were adapted from those used in a study evaluating prothrombin complex 
concentrate.9
Briefly, intracranial hemorrhage was assessed by means of serial CT or MRI scans that were 
reviewed by an independent core laboratory. For intracerebral hemorrhage, an increase in 
volume of 20% or less from baseline at both 1 hour and 12 hours after infusion was 
considered to be excellent hemostasis, whereas an increase in volume of 35% or less from 
baseline at 12 hours was considered to be good. The scoring for sub-arachnoid and subdural 
bleeding events was similar, except that the maximal hematoma thickness was used. Other 
nonvisible bleeding, which included all gastrointestinal bleeding, was evaluated on the basis 
of both the corrected hemoglobin level and hematocrit at 12 hours, as compared with 
baseline, with a decrease in both hemoglobin and hematocrit of less than 10% considered to 
be excellent and a decrease of 20% or less and with the administration of no more than two 
units of additional coagulation intervention (e.g., plasma or prothrombin complex 
concentrate) considered to be good. (The corrected levels for hemoglobin and the hematocrit 
were calculated by subtracting 1 g per deciliter from the hemoglobin level or 3% from the 
hematocrit for each unit of packed red cells that was administered.)
For visible bleeding, a cessation of bleeding was considered to indicate excellent hemostatic 
efficacy if it occurred within 1 hour after infusion and good hemostatic efficacy if it occurred 
within 4 hours and no additional coagulation intervention was required. For musculoskeletal

 bleeding, factors that included pain relief, unequivocal improvement in objective signs of 
bleeding, and no increase in swelling were considered to indicate excellent hemostatic 
efficacy if they occurred within 1 hour after infusion and good hemostatic efficacy if they 
occurred within 4 hours.
STUDY OVERSIGHT
The study was designed and coordinated jointly by the Population Health Research Institute 
(PHRI) at McMaster University and Portola Pharmaceuticals. Investigators at PHRI gathered 
and analyzed the data. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the study 
data. The study was overseen by an academic steering committee whose members vouch for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data, wrote all the drafts of the manuscript, and made 
the decision to submit the final draft for publication. The steering committee members and 
representatives of Portola Pharmaceuticals have mutual confidentiality agreements.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are reported as means (±SD) or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous 
variables and frequencies for categorical variables. We computed the percent change from 
baseline with a two-sided nonparametric confidence interval for the median.10 The rate of 
effective hemostasis is presented with an exact 95% confidence interval, as calculated with 
the use of the binomial test. All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute), or S-PLUS software, version 8.2 (TIBCO Software).
RESULTS
STUDY PATIENTS
The mean age of the patients was 77 years, and all the patients had a history of thrombotic 
events and cardiovascular disease (Table 1). All the patients received a bolus and subsequent 
andexanet infusion and were followed for 30 days or until death. Of the 67 patients, 32 were 
receiving rivaroxaban (median daily dose, 20 mg), 31 were receiving apixaban (median daily 
dose, 5 mg), and 4 were receiving enoxaparin. The primary site of bleeding was 
gastrointestinal in 33 patients (49%) and intracranial in 28 (42%), with other bleeding sites 
in 6 (9%) (Table 2). The mean time from presentation in the emergency department to the 
initiation of the andexanet bolus was 4.8±1.9 hours.
Twenty patients were not included in the efficacy population, since subsequent 
measurements of the baseline anti–factor Xa activity were less than 75 ng per milliliter (or 
<0.5 IU per milliliter for enoxaparin) in 17 patients and were missing in 2 patients. 
Adjudicators ruled that 2 of these 19 patients and 1 additional patient did not meet the 
criteria for acute major bleeding. The study is ongoing and will enroll patients until there are 
162 patients available for the efficacy analysis, with an expected safety population of 
approximately 230.
PHARMACODYNAMIC OUTCOMES
In the efficacy population, among the 26 patients who were receiving rivaroxaban, the 
median value for anti–factor Xa activity fell from 277.0 ng per milliliter at baseline to 16.8

 ng per milliliter at the end of the bolus administration, a relative decrease of 89% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 58 to 94) (Fig. 1). The median value for anti–factor Xa activity was 
30.6 ng per milliliter at the end of the 2-hour infusion, a relative decrease of 86% from 
baseline (95% CI, 55 to 93). Four hours later, the median value was 177.7 ng per milliliter, a 
relative decrease of 39% from baseline (95% CI, 27 to 45).
Among the 20 patients who were receiving apixaban, the median value for anti–factor Xa 
activity was reduced from 149.7 ng per milliliter at baseline to 10.3 ng per milliliter at the 
end of the bolus administration, a relative decrease of 93% (95% CI, 87 to 94). At the end of 
the 2-hour infusion, the median value for anti–factor Xa activity was 12.5 ng per milliliter, a 
relative decrease of 92% (95% CI, 85 to 94). Four hours later, the median value was 103.0 
ng per milliliter, a relative decrease from baseline of 30% (95% CI, 23 to 46); subsequently, 
at 8 hours and 12 hours, the value for anti–factor Xa activity remained at similar levels.
The single patient in the efficacy group who was receiving enoxaparin had a reduction in 
anti– factor Xa activity from 0.61 IU per milliliter to 0.15 IU per milliliter at the end of the 
bolus administration; the value was 0.19 IU per milliliter after the 2-hour infusion and 0.46 
IU per milliliter at 4 hours and decreased gradually after that measure. Details regarding the 
effects of andexanet on endogenous thrombin potential (thrombin generation) and on the 
unbound fraction of the plasma level of the two direct factor Xa inhibitors are provided in 
Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
CLINICAL OUTCOMES
Of the 47 patients in the efficacy population, 37 were adjudicated as having excellent or 
good hemostasis (79%; 95% CI, 64 to 89), with 31 patients adjudicated as having excellent 
hemostasis and 6 as having good hemostasis, 12 hours after the andexanet infusion (Fig. 2). 
One patient could not be evaluated because of an administrative issue. Of the 9 patients who 
were adjudicated as having poor or no hemostatic efficacy, 5 were receiving rivaroxaban and 
4 apixaban. Of these patients, 3 had gastrointestinal bleeding, 4 intracranial bleeding, and 2 
other primary bleeding sites. The rates of excellent or good efficacy were 84% for 
gastrointestinal bleeding and 80% for intracranial bleeding, rates that were consistent in 
other subgroups that were examined.
Of the 10% of patients with the highest anti– factor Xa activity at the end of the infusion, 4 
had received rivaroxaban and 1 had received apixaban; all received the lower dose of 
andexanet. The median values for anti–factor Xa activity in these patients were 487.1 ng per 
milliliter (interquartile range, 298.7 to 505.8) at baseline and 327.4 ng per milliliter 
(interquartile range, 283.9 to 330.1) at the end of the infusion. All these patients were 
adjudicated as having excellent or good hemostasis.
The mean scores on the modified Rankin scale for patients with intracranial bleeding were 
2.2±1.9 at baseline and 2.0±2.0 at 30 days among the survivors. Before andexanet treatment, 
the procoagulant treatments that had been used were platelet infusion in 1 patient and 
plasma infusion in another. After the administration of andexanet until 12 hours, 4 patients 
received plasma, tranexamic acid, or platelets.

 SAFETY
Of the 67 patients in the safety population, there were no infusion reactions and no 
antibodies to factors Xa or X and no neutralizing antibodies to andexanet developed. Figure 
3 shows the time course of thromboembolic events and deaths. Thrombotic events occurred 
in 12 patients (18%), including 1 with myocardial infarction, 5 with stroke, 7 with deep-vein 
thrombosis, and 1 with pulmonary embolism, with some patients having more than one 
event. Four patients had a thrombotic event within 3 days after andexanet treatment, and the 
rest occurred between 4 and 30 days. There were 10 deaths (15%), with 6 adjudicated as 
cardiovascular events and 4 as non-cardiovascular events. Anticoagulation was resumed in 
18 patients (27%) within 30 days, but a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation was restarted 
before the event in only 1 of the 12 patients with a thrombotic event. (An additional patient 
had received prophylactic doses of enoxaparin before the occurrence of a deep-vein 
thrombosis.)
DISCUSSION
In the ANNEXA-4 study, we enrolled patients with a high burden of major cardiovascular 
disease who had acute major bleeding associated with the use of a factor Xa inhibitor. The 
site of bleeding was most often gastrointestinal or intracranial; anti–factor Xa activity was 
considerably elevated in most patients and, as such, was likely to be a major impediment to 
clinical hemostasis. The administration of an andexanet bolus and infusion resulted in rapid 
and substantial reversal of anti–factor Xa activity. The clinical response 12 hours after the 
andexanet infusion, as measured by adjudicated hemostatic efficacy with the use of 
predetermined criteria, was excellent or good in 79% of the patients and was consistent 
across a variety of subgroups. After full enrollment in the ongoing study has provided 
adequate statistical power, further analysis should provide details regarding the relationship 
between the reduction in anti–factor Xa activity and clinical hemostatic outcomes.
Andexanet was infused over a period of 2 to 2.5 hours, and there was partial return of anti– 
factor Xa activity toward pretreatment values at 4 to 4.5 hours after the initiation of 
andexanet. Clinical hemostatic efficacy, as assessed for 12 hours after the end of the 
infusion, was excellent or good in a high percentage of patients. This finding supports the 
idea that prolonged reversal of factor Xa inhibition may not be necessary to achieve a good 
hemostatic response. We cannot determine from our study how many of the patients would 
have achieved hemostatic efficacy without andexanet administration. It is possible that 
further refinements in the administration of andexanet could lead to more complete reversal 
of anti–factor Xa activity and improved clinical outcomes. Baseline anti–factor Xa activity 
was somewhat higher for patients receiving rivaroxaban than for those receiving apixaban, 
which may be related to a higher median daily dose of rivaroxaban (20 mg) than of apixaban 
(5 mg). Rates of hemostatic efficacy were similar for patients who were receiving the two 
agents.
The study was performed as a single-group cohort study because a randomized trial would 
have had logistical and ethical challenges. Nonetheless, the study was performed with a high 
level of rigor. Strict eligibility criteria restricted enrollment to patients with severe bleeding. 
Furthermore, patients were not included in the efficacy analysis if the adjudication

 committee did not agree that the severity of bleeding met the specific inclusion criteria. In 
addition, patients were included in the efficacy analysis only if the baseline value for anti–
factor Xa activity was 75 ng per milliliter or higher, a factor that reduced the likelihood that 
good or excellent hemostasis would occur without reversal of anticoagulation. This cutoff 
level had resulted in an inhibition in thrombin generation of 30 to 35% in phase 2 studies.5 
The hemostatic efficacy outcome consisted of precise and objective criteria applied by an 
independent adjudication committee. For example, evaluation of intracranial hemorrhage 
depended on a quantitative comparison of baseline and follow-up CT or MRI scans by a core 
laboratory.
The results of two previous studies of anticoagulation reversal in patients with acute major 
bleeding were recently reported; one with idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal11 and 
another with prothrombin complex concentrate for warfarin reversal.9 The idarucizumab 
study enrolled 51 patients who had clinical features that were similar to those of the patients 
in our study, including a mean age of 77 years and a rate of intracranial hemorrhage of 35%. 
The study of prothrombin complex concentrate enrolled a younger population (mean age, 69 
years) with arate of intracranial hemorrhage of only 12%. Although the investigators in the 
idarucizumab study did not perform formal assessment of hemostatic efficacy, the study of 
prothrombin complex concentrate used efficacy criteria that were similar to those used in our 
study, with reports of good or excellent efficacy in 71% of patients (95% CI, 64 to 81). In 
the idarucizumab study, there were five deaths (12%) during 30 days of follow-up, a rate that 
was similar to that in our study. In the study of prothrombin complex concentrate, the rate of 
death at 45 days was 6%, a percentage that perhaps reflected the patients’ younger age and 
lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage. Thrombotic events occurred in 10% of 51 patients in 
the idarucizumab study, in 8% of 103 patients in the study of prothrombin complex 
concentrate, and in 18% of 67 patients in our study. The rate of reinitiation of 
anticoagulation was 69% by 90 days after idarucizumab treatment and 27% by 30 days after 
andexanet treatment; the rate of reinitiation was not reported in the study of prothrombin 
complex concentrate.
In conclusion, in this preliminary report of an ongoing cohort study in patients with acute 
major bleeding associated with the use of factor Xa inhibitors, andexanet rapidly reversed 
anti– factor Xa activity and was not associated with serious side effects. Effective hemostasis 
was achieved 12 hours after an infusion of andexanet in 79% of the patients. Thrombotic 
events occurred in 18% of the patients in the safety population, and 15% of the patients died 
during follow-up. A controlled study would be required to assess whether the frequency of 
these events exceeded that expected in patients at increased risk for thrombotic events.

 Figure 1. Anti–Factor Xa Activity and Percent Change from Baseline in Patients Receiving 
Rivaroxaban and Apixaban (Efficacy Population)
Shown are the values for anti–factor Xa activity (as measured by means of a validated 
chromogenic assay of factor Xa enzymatic activity) and the percent change from baseline in 
patients with acute major bleeding who received andexanet to counteract the anticoagulant 
effects of rivaroxaban or apixaban. Tukey box-plot values are expressed as the median 
(horizontal line in each box) and 25th and 75th percentiles (top and bottom of each box), 
with whiskers (top and bottom of each I bar) drawn to the highest data point within 1.5 times 
the upper quartile and to the lowest data point within 1.5 times the lower quartile. Outliers 
are shown as dots. The bolus of andexanet was administered during a period of 15 to 30 
minutes, and the drug infusion lasted 2 hours. Subsequent time points are measured from the 
end of the infusion. The scales of the y axes for the two plots differ to allow proper 
demonstration of outliers. One patient in the efficacy population was receiving enoxaparin

 and is not included in these plots. The numbers below the graphs show the median values for 
anti–factor Xa activity, the percent change in median values from baseline, and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for this change.

 Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis of Hemostatic Efficacy
Shown are the percentages of patients in the efficacy population who were adjudicated as 
having excellent or good hemostatic efficacy 12 hours after treatment with andexanet on the 
basis of prespecified criteria (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The size of the data 
points is proportional to the number of patients included in the subgroup analysis.

 Figure 3. Thrombotic Events or Death during the 30-Day Study Period
Shown are timeline data for 18 of 67 patients in the safety population who had a thrombotic 
event or died after being treated with andexanet, starting with the bolus administration as 
baseline. Included are the patient’s age and sex, the indication for anticoagulation, and the 
site of the acute major bleeding event. The result of adjudication of hemostatic efficacy for 
patients who were included in the efficacy analysis is shown as excellent or good hemostasis 
(HE+) or poor or no hemostatic efficacy (HE−).
