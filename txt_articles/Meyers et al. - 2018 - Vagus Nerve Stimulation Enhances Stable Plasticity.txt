Background and Purpose—Chronic impairment of the arm and hand is a common consequence of stroke. Animal and 
human studies indicate that brief bursts of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in conjunction with rehabilitative training 
improve recovery of motor function after stroke. In this study, we tested whether VNS could promote generalization, 
long-lasting recovery, and structural plasticity in motor networks.
Methods—Rats were trained on a fully automated, quantitative task that measures forelimb supination. On task proficiency, 
unilateral cortical and subcortical ischemic lesions were administered. One week after ischemic lesion, rats were randomly 
assigned to receive 6 weeks of rehabilitative training on the supination task with or without VNS. Rats then underwent 
4 weeks of testing on a task assessing forelimb strength to test generalization of recovery. Finally, the durability of VNS 
benefits was tested on the supination task 2 months after the cessation of VNS. After the conclusion of behavioral testing, 
viral tracing was performed to assess synaptic connectivity in motor networks.
Results—VNS enhances plasticity in corticospinal motor networks to increase synaptic connectivity to musculature of the 
rehabilitated forelimb. Adding VNS more than doubled the benefit of rehabilitative training, and the improvements lasted 
months after the end of VNS. Pairing VNS with supination training also significantly improved performance on a similar, 
but untrained task that emphasized volitional forelimb strength, suggesting generalization of forelimb recovery.
Conclusions—This study provides the first evidence that VNS paired with rehabilitative training after stroke (1) doubles 
long-lasting recovery on a complex task involving forelimb supination, (2) doubles recovery on a simple motor task that 
was not paired with VNS, and (3) enhances structural plasticity in motor networks.

N
europlasticity supports recovery after stroke; thus, strat-
egies that enhance plasticity in conjunction with reha-
bilitation hold promise in improving recovery. Recently, 
vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with motor training has 
emerged as a strategy to drive robust and long-lasting plas-
ticity.1 VNS provides precisely timed engagement of neuro-
modulatory systems during rehabilitation to drive plasticity 
in motor networks.2,3 In multiple rat models of stroke, VNS 
paired with rehabilitative training significantly improved 
recovery of forelimb movement speed and volitional strength 
compared with training without VNS.1,4–7
A pilot study in chronic stroke patients reported that pair-
ing VNS with rehabilitative exercises tripled recovery com-
pared with rehabilitative training without VNS. Patients 
who received VNS paired with standard rehabilitative exer-
cises demonstrated a significant increase in Upper-Extremity 
Fugl-Meyer score, even though VNS was never paired with 
Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer testing. These clinical results 
suggest that the beneficial effects of VNS might generalize to 
untrained movements. In this study, we tested the hypothesis 
that VNS-dependent functional improvements would general-
ize to untrained tasks. Furthermore, we also assessed the dura-
bility of the enhanced functional recovery.
The neural mechanism underlying VNS-supported stroke 
recovery is currently unknown. The corticospinal tract (CST) 
is the main pathway from cortical motor networks to spinal 
circuits8 and is a key component in motor dysfunction after 
stroke.9 We used retrograde transneuronal tracing to test the 
hypothesis that VNS drives plasticity in the CST.10

Subjects
Thirty-one adult female Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River) weigh-
ing ≈250 g throughout the study were used. All rats were maintained 
above 85% of their average body weight for their specific age. The 
rats were housed in a 12:12 reversed light cycle environment, and 
behavioral training was performed during the dark cycle to increase 
daytime activity levels. All handling, housing, surgical, and behav-
ioral training procedures were approved by the University of Texas at 
Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Supination Assessment Task Behavioral Testing
The supination assessment task was performed as previously 
described.11 In brief, animals were trained to reach out of a slot, grasp, 
and rotate a spherical manipulandum clockwise. The manipulandum 
was affixed to a rotary encoder that provided turn angle measure-
ments. Control software adaptively scaled the success turn angle 
thresholds based on the median of the preceding 10 trials to a maxi-
mum turn angle threshold of 60°. Training continued until animals 
achieved a 75% success rate, defined as trials in which the turn angle 
exceeded 60°, averaged across 6 consecutive training sessions. All 
animals then underwent unilateral ischemic lesions.
No behavioral testing was conducted for the 7 days after lesion. 
After this 7-day recovery period, animals were reassessed on the 
supination task for 4 sessions with at least 50 trials each session, with 
these data being used for the post-time point in all analyses.
Unilateral Ischemic Lesions
Unilateral ischemic lesions of primary motor cortex and dorsolat-
eral striatum were administered similar to previously described.5,12 
Rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg, IP), 
xylazine (20 mg/kg, IP), and acepromazine (5 mg/kg). A 26-gauge 
Hamilton Syringe was used to inject endothelin-1 (Bachem, 
Torrance, CA; 1 mg/mL in saline) at the following cortical locations: 
anterior/posterior 2.5, 1.5, 0.5, and −0.5 mm, and mediolateral 2.5 
and 3.5 mm relative to bregma, at a depth of 1.8 mm. An additional 
injection site at 3.0 mm lateral and 0 mm anterior/posterior from 
bregma at a depth of 6 mm was administered to target the dorsolat-
eral striatum. All injections consisted of 1 μL endothelin-1 delivered 
over 2 minutes.
Vagus Nerve Cuff Implant and Stimulation Delivery
After ischemic lesions, vagus nerve stimulating cuffs were implanted 
as previously described6 in all animals. In brief, a stimulating cuff 
electrode was placed around the left cervical vagus nerve and 
attached to a connector anchored to the skull. After the lesion and 
VNS implant surgery, all animals were administered enrofloxacin 
(Baytril: 10 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (Buprenex: 0.03 mg/kg). 
Animals then remained in their homecage for 1 week.
After the homecage recovery period, rehabilitative training on the 
supination task commenced for 6 weeks. All rats received equiva-
lent rehabilitative training, which consisted of freely performing the 
behavioral task. Rats in the VNS+Rehab group received stimulation 
paired with successful trials during first 5 weeks of rehabilitation 
(Figure 1B). The software monitoring the rotary encoder provided 
a trigger signal to the isolated pulse stimulator (Isolated Pulse 
Stimulator; AM Systems, Sequim, WA) to administer VNS immedi-
ately when the rotary encoder crossed the adaptively scaled turn angle 
threshold (Figure 1B; Movie IV in the online-only Data Supplement). 
All rats in the Rehab group were similarly connected to the stimula-
tor, but a trigger signal was not sent to the pulse stimulator during 
training. As in previous studies, stimulation consisted of a 500 ms 
train of pulses at 30 Hz, and each biphasic pulse was 0.8 mA in ampli-
tude and 100 ms in pulse duration.5
Treatment Group Assignment 
and Exclusion Criteria
The first rats were randomized into treatment groups (n=6 Rehab; 
n=8 VNS+Rehab). The remaining rats were dynamically allocated 
to balanced groups based on maximal postlesion turn angle to 
ensure equivalent baselines for comparison (n=4 Rehab; n=5 
VNS+Rehab). All behavioral testing was performed by blinded 
experimenters, and all behavioral analysis was automated to elimi-
nate bias. Twelve rats were excluded from this study based on 
the following exclusion criteria: (1) did not survive the ischemic 
lesion and VNS implant (n=4); (2) did not display at least a 50% 
reduction in success rate (n=4); and (3) headcap or stimulating 
cuff failure (n=4). Eight of the 12 exclusions (1 and 2) were done 
before group assignment and thus could not impact interpretation 
of results. Data including animals with headcap or cuff failures 
are included in the Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement as 
an intent-to-treat analysis, and exclusion had minimal effects on 
statistical comparisons.
Isometric Pull Task Behavioral Testing
Behavioral testing on the isometric pull task commenced on week 
7 after the completion of rehabilitative training on the supina-
tion task. Isometric pull testing was performed as previously 
described.13 Animals were trained to reach through a slot in the 
behavioral chamber and pull on an aluminum pull handle affixed 
to a force transducer. The adaptive thresholding algorithm used the 
median maximal pull force of the preceding 10 trials, with a 10-g 
minimum and 120-g maximum adaptive threshold bounds. Success 
rate was defined as the percentage of trials greater than the maximum 
threshold (120 g).
Pseudorabies Virus Injections and Analysis
Retrograde transneuronal tracer injections using pseudorabies 
virus (PRV-152), kindly provided by Dr Lynn Enquist (Princeton 
University, Princeton, NJ; Virus Center Grant P40OD010996), were 
performed in a subset of rats (Rehab n=5; VNS n=5: 2 subjects died 
during PRV surgical procedure resulting in group sizes of Rehab 
n=4; VNS n=4) after the conclusion of behavioral testing on week 
13 postlesion (Figure 1A). Animals were deeply anesthetized, and 
an incision was made over the medial face of the radius and ulna of 
the trained right forelimb to expose the flexor digitorum profundus 
and palmaris longus, the main extrinsic forelimb grasping muscles 
in the rat. Fifteen microliters of PRV-152 was injected into the belly 
of each muscle in 3 separate injections of 5 µL. The skin was then 
sutured, rinsed with saline, and treated with antibiotic ointment. 
The PRV-152 used in this study was ≈8.5×108 plaque-forming units. 
At 144 hours post-injection, rats were transcardially perfused with 
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH, 7.5). The brain and 
spinal cord were removed, postfixed overnight, then cryoprotected 
in 30% sucrose.
The brain was blocked and frozen at −80°C in Shandon M1 embed-
ding matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Forebrain 
blocks were cryosectioned at 35 µm and immediately slide mounted. 
Slides were coverslipped then scanned at ×10 magnification using the 
Virtual Slide Microscope VS120 (Olympus Life Sciences Solutions, 
Waltham, MA). PRV-152 neurons were visually identified by an 
experimenter blinded to treatment group and counted on every other 
forebrain section restricted to layer V sensorimotor cortex. All experi-
menters processing the tissue and analyzing cell counts were blinded 
to the group of the animal.
Statistics
All data are represented as mean±SEM. All comparisons were 
planned in the experimental design a priori, and significant differ-
ences were determined using unpaired t tests (Figures 2D and 3C) 
and 2-way repeated measures ANOVAs followed by unpaired t tests 
(Figure 2A and 2B). Confidence intervals for all comparisons are pro-
vided in the text and in the online-only Data Supplement. α level was 
set to 0.05 for single comparisons. On the basis of an effect size of 
1.342 from a previous study,6 10 rats per group would yield a power

Results
Stroke Impairs Forelimb Supination
Rats were trained on the supination task and reached profi-
ciency within 21±3 days. Both groups of animals were highly 
proficient at the task, and no significant differences between 
groups were observed (Figure 2A and 2B; Movie I in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Ischemic lesions substantially reduced performance on the 
supination task (Movie II in the online-only Data Supplement). 
One week postlesion, both groups exhibited significant reduc-
tions in peak turn angle (Figure 2A; Rehab: paired t test post 
versus pre, P=9.5×10−8; VNS+Rehab: paired t test post versus 
pre, P=1.85×10−6) and success rate (Figure 2B; Rehab: paired 
t test post versus pre, P=9.5×10−9; VNS+Rehab: paired t test 
post versus pre, P=7.17×10−7). No difference was observed 
between groups (Figure 2; post: peak turn angle: unpaired t 
test, P=0.21; success rate: unpaired t test, P=0.45).
VNS Paired With Rehabilitative Training 
Improves Forelimb Rotational Function
First, we tested whether VNS paired with rehabilitative supi-
nation training improves recovery of forelimb rotational func-
tion. Animals in the VNS+Rehab group underwent identical 
rehabilitative training as the Rehab group (Figure 2C), but 
brief 500 ms trains of VNS were delivered coincident with 
successful trials (Figure 1B; Movies III and IV in the online-
only Data Supplement).
VNS+Rehab significantly improved recovery of peak turn 
angle compared with Rehab, consistent with an enhanced

recovery of forelimb supination (Figure 2B; 2-way repeated 
measures ANOVA, weeks 1–6, F[6, 102]=4.60, P=3.61×10−4). 
Significantly improved performance was observed during all 6 
weeks of therapy (VNS+Rehab versus Rehab, unpaired t test, 
P<0.01 for weeks 1–6). In addition, VNS+Rehab improved 
success rate compared with Rehab alone (Figure 2B; 2-way 
repeated measures ANOVA (interaction effect of time×group), 
F[6, 102]=5.12, P=1.22×10−4). Post hoc tests revealed signifi-
cant improvements during all weeks of therapy (VNS+Rehab 
versus Rehab, unpaired t test, P<0.01 for weeks 1–6). The 
number of trials performed did not differ between groups 
(Figure 2C; weeks 1–6; Rehab: 9006±824 trials [confidence 
interval (CI), ±1865]; VNS: 7673±730 trials [CI, ±1683]; 
unpaired t test, P=0.38), suggesting that the VNS improve-
ment cannot be accounted for by training intensity. Taken 
together, these results indicate that VNS paired with rehabili-
tative training significantly improves forelimb rotational func-
tion compared with rehabilitative training alone.
Benefits of VNS Therapy Generalize 
to Untrained Tasks
To test if the benefits of VNS generalize to a similar, untrained 
task, we next evaluated forelimb strength of all subjects using 
the isometric pull task. The isometric pull task requires similar

reach and grasp motion as the supination task, but emphasizes 
volitional forelimb strength rather than forelimb supination 
(Figure 1B and 1C). Neither group received VNS during this 
phase of testing (Figure 1C).
Animals that previously received VNS paired with reha-
bilitative training on the supination task performed sig-
nificantly better on the isometric pull task compared with 
animals that underwent rehabilitative training without VNS 
(Figure 2A; 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, weeks 7–10; 
F[1, 17]=8.44, P=9.86×10−3). Post hoc comparisons revealed 
significantly improved peak pull force during weeks 7 to 10 
(Rehab versus VNS+Rehab, unpaired t test, P<0.05 during 
weeks 7–10). Similar improvements were observed in suc-
cess rate (Figure 2B; 2-way repeated measures ANOVA; F[1, 
17]=4.45, P=0.04; unpaired t test, P=0.03 during week 7). 
These results indicate that previous VNS-dependent benefits 
generalize to similar untrained tasks.
Benefits of VNS Therapy Are 
Maintained for Multiple Weeks
After the completion of generalization testing during weeks 
7 to 10, animals returned to the supination assessment task 
for an additional 2 weeks of testing (Figure 1A). No reduc-
tion in PEAK turn angle or success rate was observed in the 
VNS+Rehab group (Figure 2; weeks 5–6 and 11–12, 1-way 
repeated measures ANOVA, peak turn angle: F[3, 24]=0.40, 
P=0.84; success rate: F[3, 24]=0.28, P=0.84). Subjects in 
the VNS+Rehab group remain significantly improved com-
pared with the Rehab group for both turn angle (Figure 2A; 
weeks 11 and 12, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, F[1, 
17]=10.90, P=4.21×10−3) and success rate (Figure 2B; Weeks 
11 and 12, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, F[1,17]=12.76, 
P=2.34×10−3). These results indicate that the benefits of 
VNS are maintained for up to 7 weeks after the cessation of 
stimulation.
VNS Does Not Affect Lesion Size
Consistent with previous studies,4–6 no significant differ-
ence in cortical (Figure 2D; Rehab: 3.31±0.95 mm3 [CI, 
±2.32]; VNS+Rehab: 3.41±0.73 mm3 [CI, ±1.80]; unpaired 
t test, P=0.93) or subcortical lesion size (Figure 2D; Rehab: 
0.38±0.15 mm3 [CI, ±0.37]; VNS+Rehab: 0.56±0.20 mm3 
[CI, ±0.50]; unpaired t test, P=0.49) was observed between 
groups. Improved recovery in the absence of a reduction in 
lesion extent is consistent with the notion that VNS improves 
recovery by enhancing plasticity in motor networks.1
VNS Alters Cortical Synaptic Connectivity 
to Musculature of the Trained Forelimb
Plasticity in descending motor networks controlling task-
relevant forelimb muscles is associated with recovery after 
stroke.10,14 Therefore, we next tested the hypothesis that 
VNS paired with rehabilitative training improves recov-
ery by increasing synaptic connectivity within motor net-
works controlling the grasping muscles of the forelimb. We 
injected the retrograde transsynaptic tracer PRV-152 into 
the extrinsic digit flexors of the rehabilitated (right) fore-
limb and counted labeled cortical neurons 6 days later. VNS 
resulted in a 6-fold increase in labeled sensorimotor corti-
cal neurons in the lesioned (left) hemisphere (Figure 3C; 
VNS+Rehab, 14.25±3.20 PRV-positive cells [CI, ±10.18]; 
Rehab, 2.25±0.85 PRV-positive cells [CI, ±2.72]; unpaired t 
test, P=0.011) and a 3-fold increase in the unlesioned (right) 
hemisphere (Figure 3C; VNS+Rehab, 17.0±1.91 PRV-positive 
cells [CI, ±6.09]; Rehab, 6.0±1.47 PRV-positive cells [CI, 
±4.68]; unpaired t test, P=0.004). These results demonstrate 
that VNS paired with rehabilitative training enhances synaptic 
connectivity in descending motor circuits after stroke.
Discussion
In this study, we evaluated whether VNS paired with reha-
bilitative training could improve recovery of forelimb rota-
tional function and whether the functional benefits generalize 
to an untrained forelimb task. We find that VNS paired with 
rehabilitative training more than doubles recovery of supina-
tion function compared with extensive rehabilitative training 
alone. Furthermore, subjects that received VNS during train-
ing on a task emphasizing forelimb supination displayed sig-
nificantly improved performance on a separate task measuring 
forelimb strength compared with subjects undergoing training 
without VNS. Recovery of supination function persists for at 
least 7 weeks after cessation of VNS, indicative of robust and 
long-lasting improvements of forelimb function. Moreover, we 
provide the first evidence that VNS paired with rehabilitative 
training promotes plasticity after stroke. These findings support 
VNS therapy as an effective poststroke intervention and provide 
insight into the neural mechanisms that may subserve recovery.
The ability to supinate the forearm is essential for dexter-
ous hand function. Loss of supination ability is a major con-
tributor to poststroke disability, and recovery is limited even 
after rehabilitation in both rodents15,16 and humans.17,18 The 
development of strategies to improve recovery of forearm 
rotational function is critical to reduce poststroke disability. 
Previous studies demonstrate that VNS improves some met-
rics of recovery after stroke,4–6 but it is unknown if VNS could 
improve recovery of fine movements, like supination, that are 
generally resistant to rehabilitation. Consistent with previous 
literature, the present study shows that intensive task-oriented 
rehabilitation yields only modest recovery of forelimb supina-
tion function.11,19 Adding VNS to rehabilitative training more 
than doubled recovery. These results suggest that pairing VNS 
with a range of rehabilitative exercises that incorporate rota-
tional movements may be beneficial for patients.
Generalization of recovery to nonrehabilitated tasks is an 
important consideration for translating potential rehabilitative 
therapies to clinical use. In practical terms, assuming a fixed 
amount of time with a physical therapist, it would be useful 
to determine whether a patient should receive a greater num-
ber of VNS pairings on a more restricted set of exercises or 
a greater breadth of rehabilitative exercises with fewer VNS 
pairings on each. Generalization of stroke recovery in previ-
ous studies has been mixed, with some studies demonstrat-
ing that task-oriented recovery compromises performance on 
untrained tasks,20,21 whereas other studies demonstrate a trans-
fer of benefits.22,23 VNS-dependent plasticity is highly specific 
to the paired event1; therefore, it was unclear if enhancement

of recovery would be restricted to the trained exercise. We 
find that VNS paired with the supination task substantially 
improved subsequent performance on the isometric pull task. 
Importantly, no animals received VNS during pull task train-
ing, indicating that the VNS-mediated improvements are likely 
attributed to improved forelimb motor control. In the context 
of previous work, animals in this study that received VNS with 
supination training recovered to similar levels on the isometric 
pull task as animals that received VNS during rehabilitation on 
the isometric pull task (Figure 4), providing strong evidence of 
generalization. The improved function driven by VNS in the 
absence of task-directed training on the pull task is consistent 
with the notion that VNS augments spontaneous biological 
recovery.24 Spontaneous biological recovery strongly predicts 
recovery after stroke,25 and the influence of VNS on spontane-
ous biological recovery may suggest that benefits would gener-
alize beyond specifically rehabilitated tasks in stroke patients. 
It is important to note that both the supination and isometric 
pull tasks involve engagement of the distal forelimb; thus, the 
degree of generalization to particularly dissimilar tasks (eg, 
ladder rung, gait analyses) remains unclear. Despite these limi-
tations, these results provide insight for the development of 
rehabilitative paradigms for future clinical trials.
The durability of improvements after cessation of VNS 
is a key consideration in translating VNS therapy for stroke 
recovery to the clinic. Previous studies in multiple models of 
neurological injury demonstrate that VNS therapy improves 
recovery of forelimb function for up to a week after the cessa-
tion of stimulation.5,7,26 The present study extends these find-
ings and observed no detectable decline in performance up to 
7 weeks after the cessation of stimulation.
The mechanisms that underlie VNS-dependent recovery are 
unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated an association 
between reorganization of CST projections and recovery after 
stroke.10,14,27–29 PRV enables multisynaptic tracing of motor net-
works connected to the injected muscles, providing specific 
labeling throughout neural hierarchical chains.30 Previous stud-
ies have shown connectivity changes within the CST in the first 
month after stroke10; therefore, we performed PRV tracing 2 
months after the cessation of VNS to assess CST connectivity 
when the lesion-induced plasticity cascades have subsided.24,31 
Our findings demonstrate that VNS increases synaptic con-
nectivity in CST motor networks to rehabilitated musculature. 
Furthermore, the VNS-dependent reorganization of synaptic 
connectivity in descending motor circuits is not labile, but robust 
and enduring. These findings reveal the first evidence of VNS-
dependent enhancement of plasticity after stroke and are con-
sistent with role of CST reorganization in poststroke recovery.
Restoration of arm and hand function in stroke patients is 
a key priority for long-term quality of life, and current treat-
ment options are limited.32,33 A recent open active compara-
tor pilot trial demonstrates that delivery of VNS paired with

rehabilitation is safe and feasible in chronic stroke patients. 
Moreover, patients who received VNS paired with rehabilita-
tion exhibited a clinically significant 3-fold increase in Upper-
Extremity Fugl-Meyer scores compared with those patients 
receiving rehabilitation alone, providing preliminary evidence 
that VNS therapy may be efficacious.34 Here, we report that 
VNS therapy yields significant, lasting improvements in fore-
limb supination function and that VNS-dependent enhancement 
of recovery generalizes to a similar, untrained task. Moreover, 
we demonstrate that VNS paired with rehabilitative training 
enhances neuroplasticity in corticospinal motor networks to 
task-relevant musculature, which may provide insight into the 
neural changes that subserve VNS-dependent improvement of 
recovery. Taken together, the findings from this study extend 
the viability of VNS as a safe, effective, and robust therapeutic 
strategy to improve motor dysfunction after stroke.

Figure 4. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) delivered on supination 
training results in equivalent recovery on the isometric pull task 
compared with previous studies in which VNS was delivered dur-
ing pull training. A, Experimental timelines of previous VNS stroke 
studies and the current study. B, Pull forces of the VNS+Rehab 
and Rehab groups. Previous studies demonstrate recovery on 
the isometric pull task in which VNS was delivered. The current 
study extends these findings by showing equivalent recovery on 
the isometric pull task despite that VNS was delivered only dur-
ing supination training.
