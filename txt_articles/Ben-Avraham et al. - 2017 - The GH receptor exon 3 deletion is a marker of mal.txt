Although bothgrowthhormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor1(IGF-1) signaling were shown toregulate life span
in lower organisms, the role of GH signaling in human longevity remains unclear. Because a GH receptor exon 3 de-
letion (d3-GHR) appears to modulate GH sensitivity in humans, we hypothesized that this polymorphism could play a
role in human longevity. We report a linear increased prevalence of d3-GHR homozygosity with age in four
independent cohorts of long-lived individuals: 841 participants [567 of the Longevity Genes Project (LGP) (8%
increase; P = 0.01), 152 of the Old Order Amish (16% increase; P = 0.02), 61 of the Cardiovascular Health Study
(14.2% increase; P = 0.14), and 61 of the French Long-Lived Study (23.5% increase; P = 0.02)]. In addition, mega
analysis of males in all cohorts resulted in a significant positive trend with age (26% increase; P = 0.007), suggest-
ing sexual dimorphism for GH action in longevity. Further, on average, LGP d3/d3 homozygotes were 1 inch taller
than the wild-type (WT) allele carriers (P = 0.05) and also showed lower serum IGF-1 levels (P = 0.003). Multivariate
regression analysis indicated that the presence of d3/d3 genotype adds approximately 10 years to life span. The LGP
d3/d3-GHR transformed lymphocytes exhibited superior growth and extracellular signal–regulated kinase activa-
tion, to GH treatment relative to WT GHR lymphocytes (P < 0.01), indicating a GH dose response. The d3-GHR
variant is a common genetic polymorphism that modulates GH responsiveness throughout the life span and pos-
itively affects male longevity.
INTRODUCTION
Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) play a cen-
tral role in development, differentiation, growth, and metabolism
among divergent taxa (1). For instance, the absence of the IGF-1 gene
is associated with poor prenatal growth both in rodents and in humans
(2). The activities of IGF-1 are regulated by six IGF binding proteins
(IGFBP1 to IGFBP6), which act as carrier and modulatory proteins
for IGF-1 and are produced in a diverse array of tissues via complex
regulatory processes. Among these six proteins, IGFBP3 is complexed
to more than 90% of the circulating IGF-1 (3).
Dwarf individuals appear to live longer among many species (4, 5),
suggesting a role for the GH/IGF-1 axis in modulating aging and life
span. A considerable body of in vitro experimental evidence also sug-
gests an important role for the IGF axis in human longevity and
aging-related processes in a tissue-specific manner (3). Furthermore,
several studies in selected human populations lend support on the role
of thisaxisin healthandlife span. Forinstance, we have previously iden-
tified a cluster of functional mutations in the IGF-1 receptor in cente-
narians(6). We showedthat Laron dwarfs, who are naturally short, have
decreased prevalence of diabetes, cancer, and stroke, suggesting
increased health span although life span in this small sample size cannot
be determined accurately (7). Also, we previously established that cen-
tenarians with lower levels of IGF-1 had significantly longer survival (8).
Clearly, individuals with severe GH deficiency have reduced life expect-
ancy (9), suggesting that some GH is necessary for survival. On the other
hand, interventional GH therapy in humans is commonly used to reverse
age-related morbidities; hence, the kind of deficiency that will be most
beneficial for health span and longevity needs to be further established.
GH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland and circulates in a
pulsatile manner, with peaks during sleep. The production of GH is
mediated by ghrelin and GH-releasing hormone and inhibited by so-
matostatin and IGF-1 feedback inhibition. The peaks of circulating
GH are modulated by several factors, including age, health conditions,
gender, and nutrition. GH production is decreased with age; however, it
is never completely diminished (10). That said, there is accumulating
evidence that GH may play a crucial role in modulating aging. Surpris-
ingly, GH deficiency or diminished secretion has been linked to longev-
ity phenotypes both in mice models and in humans with familial
longevity (11, 12).
The GH receptor (GHR) gene is located on the short arm of chro-
mosome 5 (p12-p13.1) and has nine coding exons (13). It consists of
two common isoforms: (i) full-length GHR—flGHR (NM_000163)
and (ii) a shorter form with a deletion of exon 3 in which exon 2 is

 spliced in frame to exon 4, resulting in the deletion of 22 amino acids
within the N-terminal domain of the receptor—d3-GHR (14, 15). The
allele frequencies of these isoforms among human populations range from
68 to 90% and 10 to 32% for flGHR and d3-GHR (15–17), respectively.
The effects of GHR isoforms on human health have provided mixed
results. Likewise, results on the efficacy of human GH (hGH) therapy to
d3-GHR human subjects are variable. Following the initial observation
of a positive association between growth response and hGH therapy
among d3-GHR carriers (16), both positive (16, 17) and no relationship
(18, 19) have been reported, resulting in two meta-analyses showing
modest positive dominant effects of the d3-GHR genotype for the re-
sponse to GH in various etiologies of short stature (20, 21). In two Ge-
nome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) based on single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) (22, 23), the GHR locus showed association with
final height. However, to our knowledge, the association of d3-GHR
with final height has not been examined possibly because individuals
with d3-GHR are expected to maintain normal GH action despite lower
GH production, as hypothesized by Bougnères (24) and Pantel et al. (25).
Hence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that increased GH sensitivity can
also alter IGF-1 secretion (26, 27) and therefore regulate longevity (28, 29).
Given the potential role of the GH/IGF axis in longevity, we hypoth-
esize that low IGF-1 levels will assure longevity of the d3-GHR carriers.
To address this hypothesis, we genotyped d3-GHR locus in four human
cohorts with long-lived participants, and we tested its association with
longevity-related phenotypes and stature with a relatively common
GHR variation.
RESULTS
Relationship between d3-GHR and phenotypic traits
d3-GHR and longevity
In Ashkenazi males, but not in females, a marked difference in allele
frequency for the exon 3 deletion polymorphism (d3-GHR) was found
between centenarian and control, as well as offspring and control
groups. Whereas the male control group carried only 4% homozygote
deletions, male offspring of centenarians and male centenarians carried
11 and 12%, respectively. Although these differences did not reach sta-
tistically significant levels among the offspring (P = 0.07), they crossed
the significance threshold in centenarians (P < 0.05) versus control
(Fig. 1). Note that the mean age difference between the centenarians
and their offspring is about 30 years. We applied age trend analysis to test
therelationshipbetweenthed3-GHRpolymorphisminpooledcontroland
centenarian’s data. The results showed a significant positive trend (P =
0.017), implying an enrichment of this allele with advancing age (Fig. 2A).
We further validated these results in three independent cohorts—the
Old Order Amish (OOA), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and
the French Long-Lived Study (FLLS). In the OOA, homozygosity for
the d3-GHR increased with age among males, from 5% at 45 years of
age to 21% at 75 years of age (P = 0.02) (Fig. 2B). In CHS, these differ-
ences showed similar trends; the homozygotes increased from 8.3% at
75 to 85 years of age to 26.5% at 86 to 95 years of age (P = 0.14; Fig. 2C).
In the French cohort, the frequency of d3-GHR homozygotes increased
from 6.45% at <100 years of age to 30% at >100 years of age (P = 0.02)
(Fig. 2D). Finally, we conducted a mega analysis with males of the
four cohorts in which d3-GHR homozygotes increased from 6.45% at
<100 years of age to 30% at >100 years of age (P = 0.02) (Fig. 2E). These
results demonstrate a consistent relationship between homozygosity for
the d3-GHR deletion allele and longevity among the cohorts studied.
However, this observation was limited only to males; the frequency of
d3-GHR deletion homozygosity among females did not differ with
age in any of the cohorts studied.
d3-GHR and height
Because d3-GHR has been shown to be associated with shorter stature
(30), we investigated height among homozygotes for this deletion using
a recessive model adjusted for gender, age, and group in our Ashkenazi
Jew study cohorts (AJs). In the combined data set of AJ subjects, d3-GHR
homozygotes across ages were taller compared to wild type (WT) and
the heterozygotes by 1 inch {(67.3 inches versus 66.3 inches, P = 0.05;
tableS1),thisphenomenonmightbedrivenbytheeffectobservedamong
centenarians [66.8 inches versus 64.7 inches, P = 0.05; table S1 (other val-
idation cohorts did not have this phenotype)]}.
Relationships among d3-GHR, IGF-1, and IGFBPs
We further tested whether the d3-GHR polymorphism was related to
the levels of IGF-1 and its IGFBPs. Previously, Suh et al. (6) demon-
strated high IGF-1 levels and short stature among female offspring of
centenarians and suggested a mechanism by which IGF-1 insensitivity
could occur in females. However, this finding was not replicated among
males in the offspring of centenarians. In contrast, the frequency of the
homozygote GHR deletion polymorphism increased in males in all co-
horts, suggesting gender specificity. Also, this increment was associated
with low IGF-1 (tables S1 and S2 under dominant model). d3-GHR
homozygote deletion carriers or those with heterozygote under domi-
nant model showed significant low levels of IGFBP1 compared with
WT, in offspring (table S3) and in allelic or dominant model among
all groups (table S1), and control and offspring combined (table S4).
Other IGFBPs did not reveal this relationship.
d3-GHR and GHBP
We further tested for association of the d3-GHR deletion with the levels
of GHBP. All association tests revealed a significant inverse relationship
between the carriers of the deletion and Growth Hormone Binding Pro-
tein (GHBP) levels (Fig. 3 and tables S1 to S4).
d3-GHR and survival
Of the 196 genotyped male subjects in the longevity cohort, 16 were
homozygous for the deletion (>8% of total). The relationship between
the d3-GHR deletion genotypes and mortality assessed through
Kaplan-Meier survival function suggests that the probability of survival

 was significantly greater among the deletion carriers than the noncar-
riers (P = 0.01; Fig. 4). The survivors were 10 years older, on average,
than the WT carriers, suggesting plausible beneficial effects of this poly-
morphism on age and longevity.
Functional studies of d3-GHR polymorphism
To assessthe functionalimpactof the deletion, we determinedthe in vitro
effects of GH stimulation (100 ng/ml) on the rate of proliferation of
transformed lymphocytes from male centenarians. In the basal state,
lymphocytes from d3-GHR homozygous subjects had lower prolifera-
tion rates compared to WT homozygotes. However, in the presence of
GH, we observedhigherproliferation ratesin d3 homozygotes(Fig. 5A).
In addition, we assessed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) in transformed lymphocytes from male cente-
narians. Lymphocytes from d3-GHR homozygotes displayed lower basal
activation of ERK compared to WT homozygotes. Conversely, higher
activation of ERK was found in response to GH treatment (100 ng/ml),
compared to WT homozygotes (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5B). No effect on the
phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription
5 (STAT5) and AKT was evident (fig. S1), suggesting a unique,
pathway-specific effect of the d3-GHR polymorphism on GH signaling

studies that use high doses of GH.
DISCUSSION
Although numerous genes have been shown to influence longevity (31),
certain genes, including Igf1, appear to affect life span across diverse or-
ganisms, ranging from worms to humans (32). In humans, IGF-1 is as-
sociated with key biochemical pathways that regulate energy metabolism,
immunity, inflammation, and imprinting and hence influence growth,
development, and senescence from fetus to old age (33). Hence, it is rea-
sonable to suggest that the IGFs exert pleiotropic effects on a wide range
of cellular, physiological, and morphological variables throughout the life
span of individuals. For instance, IGF-1 has been shown to prevent age-
related myopathy through attenuation of myocyte death, repair muscle
damage through regeneration of skeletal muscles in old animals, and up-
regulate telomerase activity (34). Furthermore, as presented elsewhere,
mutations in Igf1 have been shown to bring about a series of correlated
responses: decreased IGF-1 levels, lower incidence of heart failure and
mortality, and increased longevity in mice (35). Our results corrobo-
rate similar studies conducted on other cohorts. For instance, an
inverse relationship between reduced IGF-1 levels and longevity has
been reported on an Italian centenarian cohort (36) and in the Leiden
85-plus Study (37).
Similarly, GHR deficiency is associated with an unchanged life span
but with a reduced incidence of cancer and diabetes (7). The phenotypic
effects of GHR could be attributed to the direct activation of tyrosine ki-
nase or indirect induction of IGF-1 (38), whose excess can be detrimental.
In centenarians, most IGF-1 regulation seems to respond to caloric
and protein nutritional signals, not from GH. IGF-1 is not lower in car-
riers of d3-GHR during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood despite
several reports showing that the GHR genotype may influence circulat-
ing IGF-1 under basalconditions.People with d3-GHR orfl-GHR alleles
produce comparable amounts of circulating IGF-1 (16, 39–41). That
said, we suspect people with d3-GHR alleles to have a decreased GH
secretion. GH secretion by pituitary somatotropic cells is normally regu-
lated by hypothalamic neuroendocrine mediators that are, at least par-
tially, sensitive to feedback effects of IGF-1 or metabolic substrates. A
higher level of GH transduction signaling through the d3-GHR would
result in the following conditions: a greater GH impact on liver and the
growth plate; and among other targets, increased IGF-1 generation, less
feedback exerted on pituitary GH production, lower circulating GH
levels, less binding to the d3-GHR–equipped cells, and reestablishment
of a desirable level of GH action on relevant targets.
It appears that deletion of the GHR gene exon 3 might have origi-
nated from complex genomic events taking place after the emergence of
Old World monkeys, followed by homologous recombination between
two retro-elements in Homo sapiens. Thereafter, it spread throughout
the human clades to be present now in approximately 25% of Caucasian
chromosomes.
Strawbridge et al. (26) suggested thatd3-GHR mayoffer some degree
of protection against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because the per-
cent of individuals homozygous for the d3-GHR allele was only 7% in
T2DM versus 27% in Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT). The diminu-
tion of T2DM prevalence may increase longevity. This protective effect
of the d3-GHR genotype is independent of IGF-1, because no significant
differences of circulating IGF-1 were observed across the three d3-GHR
genotypic groups. This is consistent with previous GWAS and studies
that have not found that the GHRgenotype contributesto the individual
variation of circulating IGF-1 (42).
The mode of GH secretion has not yet been studied in centenarians.
It is possible that people exposed lifelong to lower GH secretion live
longer, because the activity of GH is involved with many physiological

 systems associated with longevity. In addition, we and others have re-
ported an association between low IGF-1 and longevity (8, 37, 43). Simi-
larly, several others (16, 39–41) have shown numerically higher IGF-1
levels in d3-GHR carriers, which did not reach significant levels be-
cause of absence of recessive model analysis or small sample size. Further,
people with d3-GHR may have increased in number because of these ad-
vantages, including low GH secretion for a given IGF-1 level: If nutrition
increases IGF-1 in these people, then they will keep their GH relatively
low through a more efficient feedback. We should remember that
GH–IGF-1 relationships are regulated to favor growth in young ages
but fit other purposes in older ages, such as body composition, insulin
secretion, and energy flux. Finally, GHRKO mice demonstrated longer
life expectancy and lower IGF-1 levels compared with WT (44). Follow-
ing this line of thought, we suggest that people with d3-GHR should
maintain normal GH action despite less GH being produced. The
inverse relationship between low IGF-1 and increased d3-GHR preva-
lence (as indicated in this paper) supports the notion that d3-GHR is
favorable to longevity.
The positive association between d3-GHR homozygote frequencies
and longevity in the three distinct populations with different demographic
histories found in our study agrees with the earlier reports that reduced
GH/IGF signaling may be involved in modulating human longevity and
could signify a broader phenomenon. The positive relationship between
the d3-GHR homozygote frequency and longevity, as well as height,
suggests that decreased levels of GHR expression in homozygotes
may have favorable effects on longevity. Further, whereas in most re-
ports d3-GHR homozygote carriers are associated with short or no
difference in stature, Audi et al. (19) demonstrated a tendency of the
d3-GHR homozygote carriers to be taller, and Strawbridge et al. (26) re-
ported significant 2+-inches-taller normal glucose-tolerant d3/d3
subjects in an additive model compared with the other genotypes. This
general trend was further confirmed through cell culture studies, in
which cells carrying GHR homozygote exon 3 deletions displayed a sig-
nificantly slower rate of growth and lower activation of ERK at baseline.
However, with GH treatment, d3-GHR homozygous lymphocytes
showed superior growth and ERK activation, relative to homozygous
WT lymphocytes. This phenomenon could be explained by the positive
relationship of GHBP with longevity among AJs, further suggesting the
plausibility of a consistent relationship between d3-GHR variation and
GH secretion from cellular to organism levels over the life course of in-
dividuals. These observationssuggest thatIGF-1 may exert positive plei-
otropy (45) on many traits associated with healthy longevity. Our
observation that IGFBP1 is higher in the d3-GHR subjects suggests that
they are more insulin-sensitive (46).
Our study provides the first consistent evidence linking the GHR to
human longevity. Although our study consists of four cohorts with a
total of 841 subjects, the sample size ranged from 60 to 600; hence, it
is generally low relative to the sample sizes used in many association
studies. Mutations in GH-related genes may exert pleiotropic (45)
effects throughout the life span of individuals, which appears to be a
universal feature of most if not all major longevity assurance genes. Be-
cause IGFs are found across a wide range of organisms and perform
similar functions among these, as suggested by Waddington (47), they
could be viewed as “canalized” genes playing a vital role in the survival
of organisms across taxa. Although the GHR deletion appears to show
age-, cohort-, and gender-specific effects, we hypothesize that a combi-
nation of empirical and systems analyses would provide answers toward
understanding the contextual effects of GH on longevity in relation to
age, stage, and gender.
In summary, our findings suggest that the d3-GHR, as indicated by
the distribution of homozygotes among the four populations examined,
may be involved in modulating human longevity. These results may
have implications in devising precision medicine strategies, such as
GH-related interventional therapies in the elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and phenotyping
The Ashkenazi centenarian cohort (Longevity Genes Project)
The contemporary AJ population worldwide is descended from a
founder population (estimated to be several thousand) originating in
the 15th century. To a large extent, thispopulation exhibits bothcultural
and genetic homogeneity. For these reasons, the AJ population has been
successfully used in the discovery of many disease-associated genes (48).
The AJ cohort in the present study, which consists of three groups: cen-
tenarians, their offspring, and controls (see below), was recruited as pre-
viously described (49–52). Most of the participants in this cohort were
born in or moved to the United States before World War II. The ages of
197 male AJ centenarians with exceptional longevity were 95 or above,
as verified from their passports. Offspring of the long-lived centenarians
consisted of 223 subjects (49.3% male and 50.7% female) with a mean
age of 68.4 years (range, 49 to 88 years). The control group, used for the
purpose of comparison with the offspring group, consisted of 147 indi-
viduals (64% male and 36% female) recruited from two different
sources: (i) spouses of the offspring (n = 65) and (ii) a group of inde-
pendently recruited AJ from the Einstein Aging Study (n = 82) (53). In
the control group, we excluded individuals if the parents lived to the age
of >85 years. The mean age of the control group was 71 years (range, 43
to 92 years). Because there were no differences between any measured
traits or GHR genotype frequencies between the two subgroups, they
were combined and were treated as one control group. A detailed med-
ical history questionnaire was administered, and a physical examination
on the AJ was performed as previously described (49–51). Informed
written consent was obtained from the participants in accordance
with the policy of the Committee on Clinical Investigations of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
Independent (validation) cohorts
In addition to the 567 subjects from the AJ cohort, DNAs from the
OOA, the CHS, and the FLLS were genotyped. Additional details of
these cohorts are provided below.
Old Order Amish. The Amish Family Calcification Study (AFCS)
was initiated in 2001 at the University of Maryland to identify the joint
determinants of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and vascular calcification
specific to the Amish community of Lancaster County, PA. The Amish
immigrated to the United States from Western Europe in the late 1700s
and represent a genetically homogeneous founder population. The AFCS
cohort consisted of 428 males and 627 females with an average age of
55 years (range, 25 to 98 years). Of these, 152 white males with a mean
age of 56.4 years (range, 21 to 85 years) and d3-GHR genotypes were
reported in this study (table S5A). The AFCS was approved by the Uni-
versity of Maryland Institutional Review Board (IRB), and written
informed consent was obtained from all research participants.
Cardiovascular Health Study. Thisisaprospectivepopulation-based
cohort study consisting of 5888 adult men and women who are 65 years
and older. They were recruited from four field centers: Forsyth County,
NC; Sacramento County, CA; Washington County, MD; and Pittsburgh,
PA (54). Baseline examination for the original cohort, of whom 4925 or
95% self-identified their ethnicity as white, was performed over 1 year,

 beginning in May 1989. Of these, 61 white males with a mean age of
77 years (range, 65 to 94 years) and d3-GHR genotypes were reported
in this study (table S5A). All clinical examinations/procedures were
conducted under institutionally approved protocols for use of hu-
man subjects.
French Long-Lived Study. The FLLS included 325 French long-
lived Caucasian male participants from 87 to 110 years old and 381
adult controls from 34 to 85 years old. Of these, 61 white males with
a mean age of 94 years (range, 70 to 109 years) and d3-GHR genotypes
were reported in this study (table S5A). Written informed consent was
obtained from the study participants.
Phenotyping
Wide ranging phenotypic data encompassing physiological (lipids: cho-
lesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol) (51), and IGF-1–related biomarkers (IGF-2,
IGFBPs, insulin, and GHBP) (55), disease prevalence (myocardial in-
farction, stroke, diabetes, or cancer), and anthropometric (height and
weight) (51) traits have been collected from the Ashkenazi centenarians,
their offspring, and age-matched (to the offspring) controls (table S5B).
Genotyping
Genotyping of the d3-GHR polymorphism was performed using two
consecutive polymerase chain reactions(PCRs) using the same genomic
DNA sample, one with the G1-G2 set of primers followed by another
with the G1-G3 set of primers (table S6). We used 50 ng of genomic
DNA in a 50-ml PCR reaction mix consisting of 25-ml Amplitaq Gold
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.1 pM of each primer, and
double-distilled water. The PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad instru-
ment with the following conditions: 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72°C for
7 min. We then analyzed the PCR-amplified products by electropho-
resis on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The lengths of
the PCR products for the G1-G2 and G1-G3 were 532 and 935 base
pairs (bp), respectively. These bands were classified as follows:
935 bp–935 bp = homozygote for WT, 935 bp–532 bp = heterozygote,
and 532 bp–532 bp = homozygote for the deletion.
Analysis of transformed lymphocytes
Blood samples obtained from subjects were rapidly processed at the
General Clinical Research Center at the Albert Einstein College of Med-
icine for generating Epstein-Barr virus–transformed lymphocytes using
the established methods. Informed written consent was obtained from
all the participants, in accordance with the policy of the Committee on
Clinical Investigations of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. To
assess the ability of GH to activate signal transduction via the GHR,
we incubated lymphocytes harboring mutation and those without the
mutation, as described (6). Growth assays on these cells were recorded,
followed by total cell protein extraction from cell lysates. These were
further subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; immuno-
blotting with total- and phospho-AKT, STAT5 and ERK using antibo-
dies from Cell Signaling; and densitometry. Results are means ± SD.
Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t tests.
Statistical analysis
Data on serum triglycerides were ln-transformed for analysis and were
back-transformed for presentation. Four comparisons of phenotypic
data were performed on the AJ cohort: (i) within each group (that is,
centenarian, offspring, and control—all of whom are of AJ descent);
(ii) between centenarians, offspring, and controls; (iii) between off-
spring and controls; and (iv) between centenarians and controls. All
analyses were adjusted for age and sex. We applied the most fre-
quently used models in association studies: allelic (carriers of the de-
letion versus none), dominant (WT versus heterozygote and deletion
homozygote), additive (WT versus heterozygote versus deletion homo-
zygote), and recessive (deletion homozygote versus WT and hetero-
zygote) in each comparison (tables S1 to S4).
Analysis of genotype data
Genotypes were checked for Mendelian consistency using the PedCheck
software (56) before analysis. Mendelian errors were resolved or removed
before analysis. Allele frequencies were calculated by gene counting, and
all the genotypes conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. We eval-
uated the association between SNP genotype and phenotype (for exam-
ple, IGF levels or height) under the additive or dominant models using a
variance component approach. We modeled the probability that the
subject was a case or control as a function of the individual’s age, sex,
and genotype, conditional on the correlations in phenotype among
relative pairs. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 12.
