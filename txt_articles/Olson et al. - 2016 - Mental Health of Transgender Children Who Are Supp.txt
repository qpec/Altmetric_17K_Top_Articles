Mental Health of Transgender Children 
Who Are Supported in Their Identities
Kristina R. Olson, PhD, Lily Durwood, BA, Madeleine DeMeules, BA, Katie A. McLaughlin, PhD
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Transgender children who have socially transitioned, that is, who identify as 
the gender “opposite” their natal sex and are supported to live openly as that gender, are 
increasingly visible in society, yet we know nothing about their mental health. Previous 
work with children with gender identity disorder (GID; now termed gender dysphoria) has 
found remarkably high rates of anxiety and depression in these children. Here we examine, 
for the first time, mental health in a sample of socially transitioned transgender children.
METHODS: A community-based national sample of transgender, prepubescent children (n = 
73, aged 3–12 years), along with control groups of nontransgender children in the same age 
range (n = 73 age- and gender-matched community controls; n = 49 sibling of transgender 
participants), were recruited as part of the TransYouth Project. Parents completed anxiety 
and depression measures.
RESULTS: Transgender children showed no elevations in depression and slightly elevated 
anxiety relative to population averages. They did not differ from the control groups on 
depression symptoms and had only marginally higher anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender 
identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations 
in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially 
striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned 
transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than 
previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Transgender 
individuals have been found to have highly elevated 
rates of anxiety and depression, but little is known 
about the mental health of transgender children 
whose identities are affi
 rmed and supported by 
their families.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: More families are allowing 
their transgender children to live and present to 
others as their gender identity. This is the fi
 rst study 
to examine mental health in these children, fi
 nding 
that they have low levels of anxiety and depression.

National media are increasingly 
presenting stories of a subset of 
prepubescent transgender children 
(those who persistently, insistently, 
and consistently identify as the 
gender identity that is the “opposite” 
of their natal sex). More striking 
to many, a large number of these 
children have “socially transitioned”: 
they are being raised and are 
presenting to others as their gender 
identity rather than their natal sex,1–4 
a reversible nonmedical intervention 
that involves changing the pronouns 
used to describe a child, as well as 
his or her name and (typically) hair 
length and clothing. These stories 
have sparked an international 
debate about whether parents of 
young transgender children should 
support their children’s desire to 
live presenting as their gender 
identity.5–9 Despite considerable and 
heated discussion on the topic, and 
despite these children’s increasing 
appearance at gender clinics,6 there 
have been no reports to date on 
the mental health of transgender 
children who have socially 
transitioned, forcing clinicians to 
make recommendations to parents 
without any systematic, empirical 
investigations of mental health 
among socially transitioned children.
Most studies of mental health among 
transgender people have examined 
adolescents and adults. These studies 
consistently report dramatically 
elevated rates of anxiety, depression, 
and suicidality among transgender 
people.10–16 These elevated rates of 
psychopathology are likely the result 
of years of prejudice, discrimination, 
and stigma11,17; conflict between 
one’s appearance and stated 
identity18; and general rejection by 
people in their social environments, 
including their families.19,20 There 
is now growing evidence that social 
support is linked to better mental 
health outcomes among transgender 
adolescents and adults.21–26 These 
findings suggest the possibility 
that social transitions in children, 
a form of affirmation and support 
by a prepubescent child’s parents, 
could be associated with good mental 
health outcomes in transgender 
children.
Although there are no large studies 
of transgender prepubescent 
children, a number of studies have 
examined children who were at the 
time diagnosed with what was called 
gender identity disorder (GID), now 
termed gender dysphoria (GD; for 
more on both terms and others used 
throughout this article, see Table 
1). The group of children diagnosed 
with GID likely included children 
who were transgender as well as 
others (eg, children who wished 
and acted but did not believe they 
were a member of the other gender 
and were distressed as a result). 
Importantly, most of the studies 
of children with GID/GD were 
conducted at a time when parental 
support and affirmation of children’s 
gender nonconforming behaviors 
and identities were uncommon. In 
contrast, the current work focuses 
on what is likely a much narrower 
group of children, a small subset of 
the group that previously would have 
been diagnosed with GID: those who 
(1) identify as (not merely wish) they 
were the “opposite” gender as their 
sex at birth and (2) have socially 
transitioned so that they appear to 
others as the gender they feel, rather 
than that assumed by their sex at 
birth.
By and large, studies of children 
with GID reported high rates 
of psychopathology, especially 
internalizing disorders such as 
anxiety and depression27–32. For 
example, 36% of a group of 7- to 
12-year-olds with GID reached 
the clinical range for internalizing 
problems.33 Furthermore, 2 large 
studies of 6- to 11-year-olds with 
GID (including >100 children in 
Utrecht, the Netherlands, and 300 
children in Toronto, Canada) found 
average internalizing scores in 
the clinical and preclinical range, 
respectively, suggesting that 
many children in both samples 
showed high levels of internalizing 
psychopathology. Some have argued 
that these high rates of internalizing 
psychopathology among children 
with GID/GD as a sign that GID/GD is 
itself a form or consequence of such 
psychopathology.27
In contrast, 2 smaller studies suggest 
that children whose gender identities 
are affirmed and supported have 
relatively good mental health. One 
study reported on 26 children aged 
3 to 12 years with GID who were 
recruited through a clinic that 
advised parents to support their 
children’s gender expression. These 
children showed reduced rates of 
psychopathology34 compared with 
those reported in other studies 
conducted at clinics that do not 
support such gender expression.35 
However, this study has received 
some criticism for methodologic 
limitations36 and had a small sample 
size. Furthermore, the degree to 
which these findings generalize to 
transgender children and especially 
to transgender children who have 
been allowed to fully socially 
transition, is unknown. In addition, 
a qualitative analysis of interviews 
of parents of 5 transgender children 
who had socially transitioned found 
that parents recalled a reduction 
in mental health problems after 
a social transition.37 Although no 
formal quantitative measures were 
provided, these findings again 
suggest that socially supported 
transgender children might have 
better mental health than children 
with GD or transgender children who 
are not supported in their identities.
The current study addresses a critical 
gap in knowledge by examining 
parental reports of anxiety and 
depression among a relatively large 
cohort of transgender children, all of 
whom are supported by their families 
and have socially transitioned (ie, 
they present to others as the gender 
consistent with their identity, not

their natal sex and use associated 
gender pronouns consistent with that 
identity). We focused on internalizing 
psychopathology because previous 
work indicates that transgender 
children are particularly likely 
to have internalizing, as opposed 
to externalizing, symptoms.33,35 
We compared these supported, 
transgender children’s rates of 
anxiety and depression to their 
nontransgender siblings and to 
typically developing nontransgender 
children matched to transgender 
children on age and gender identity.
METHODS
This work, including recruitment 
and methods, was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board at the 
University of Washington.
Participants
To be included in this study, 
transgender children had to (1) 
identify as the gender “opposite” 
their natal sex in everyday life (ie, 
they identified as male or female, 
but not the gender that aligned 
with their sex at birth), (2) present 
in all contexts (eg, at school, in 
public) as that gender identity, (3) 
use the pronoun matching their 
gender rather than their natal sex, 
(4) be 3 to 12 years old, and (5) be 
prepubescent (ie, anyone eligible for 
hormone blockers was excluded from 
the present study). We recruited 
a national, community sample via 
support groups, conferences, a Web 
site advertised via media stories, 
and word of mouth. Our sample 
included 73 transgender children 
(Mage = 7.7 years; SD = 2.2 years; 
22 natal females, 51 natal males;

TABLE 1  
Defi
 nitions of Terms
Term
Use in This Article
Other Uses, Terms, and Comments
Transgender
In this article, we use “transgender” to refer to children who have 
a binary identity (male or female) and for whom this identity 
is not aligned with their sex at birth. This means natal boys 
who identify as girls and natal girls who identify as boys. In our 
sample, these children have all socially transitioned as well.
“Transgender” is often used to mean a broader range of 
people—anyone whose gender identity does not align with 
his or her sex at birth. This categorization can include, for 
example, people who identify as male and female, neither 
male or female, or somewhere between male and female. 
The sample included in the current work does not include 
such children, hence our use of a narrower version of this 
term.
Social transition
This phrase is used to refer to a decision by a family to allow a 
child to begin to present, in all aspects of the child's life, with 
a gender presentation that aligns with the child’s own sense 
of gender identity and that is the “opposite” of the gender 
assumed at the child’s birth. Social transitions involve changes 
in the child’s appearance (eg, hair, clothing), the pronoun used 
to refer to the child, and typically also a change in the child’s 
name.
Social transitions are currently controversial in clinical 
psychology and psychiatry, but are increasingly being 
pursued by parents. More and more pediatricians, 
therapists, and teachers are supporting these transitions 
as well. Importantly, these transitions do not involve any 
medical, physiologic, or hormonal intervention.
Natal sex
We use this term to refer to the sex assigned by a physician 
at the child’s birth. This phrase is meant as a synonym for 
“anatomical sex,” “biological sex,” or “sex assigned at birth.”
The term “natal sex” is controversial, with many using the 
phrase “sex assigned at birth” instead. However, the 
latter term is still unfamiliar to many people with limited 
exposure to transgender individuals. Because this paper 
is aimed at reaching a broad audience of pediatric health 
professionals, we use the more commonly understood term 
“natal sex.”
“Opposite” gender
We occasionally use the phrase “opposite” gender in this article 
when describing our sample of transgender children. Children 
whose gender is the “opposite” of their natal sex refers to natal 
boys who identify as girls and natal girls who identify as boys. 
Because the latter phrasing is longer and more awkward, we 
opted for the former.
This phrasing of “opposite” gender implies that gender is 
binary, when in fact it is not. There are many people who do 
not identify as male or female. We use this phrase because 
most readers will be more familiar with this terminology, 
and our goal is to reach a broad audience of pediatric 
health professionals.
Gender identity
We use this term to refer to a child’s sense of his or her own 
gender. Although in most children, gender identity “aligns” with 
a child’s natal sex, in transgender children, it does not.
Gender identity is often separated from gender presentation 
or gender expression (ie, the gender one appears to others 
as, or how a child expresses his or her gender identity). 
In this study, however, participants’ gender identities 
align with their gender presentation/expressions because 
children have socially transitioned.
Gender Identity Disorder 
(GID)/Gender Dysphoria 
(GD)
Until 2014, GID was the offi
 cial diagnosis given to children who 
had behavioral preferences and identities (or desires to be) 
the “other” gender. With the publication of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, this 
diagnostic category was renamed gender dysphoria (GD) after 
substantial debate about whether this is or is not a “disorder.”
The term GD describes a broader segment of the population 
than children qualifying as “transgender” for the current 
study. For example, a natal male who wishes to be a 
female, who behaves in accordance with female cultural 
stereotypes, and who has considerable concern about his 
identity but who does not believe he is female, would be 
diagnosed with GD but would not count as transgender in 
the current study.

70% white non-Hispanic) and 
included all consecutive cases run 
by our research group meeting these 
criteria, starting with the first for 
whom we had these measures.
In addition, we recruited 2 control 
groups. Our first control group 
was a set of 49 siblings (Mage = 
8.3 years; SD = 2.5 years; 19 natal 
females, 30 natal males; 76% white 
non-Hispanic) of the transgender 
children reported earlier who were 
also aged 3 to 12 years. Whenever 
possible, the sibling closest in age 
was recruited. The second group of 
controls consisted of 73 typically 
developing children with no history 
of cross-gender behavior (Mage = 
7.8 years; SD = 2.2 months; 51 natal 
females, 22 natal males; 71% white 
non-Hispanic) who were matched to 
each transgender child based on age 
and gender identity (eg, transgender 
girls had female controls). These 
unrelated controls were recruited 
from a university database of families 
in the Seattle area interested in 
participating in research about 
child development. Importantly, 
all parents were informed that this 
was part of a longitudinal study 
about gender nonconforming 
children’s development, even 
though their children were not 
gender nonconforming. Recruitment 
and data collection is part of 
the TransYouth Project, a large, 
longitudinal study of American and 
Canadian transgender children’s 
development, and matched controls 
from that larger study were used in 
the current work.
Measures
Internalizing Psychopathology
Symptoms of anxiety and depression 
were reported using the National 
Institutes of Health Patient Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information 
System parental proxy short forms 
for anxiety and depression.38 When 
possible, 2 parents completed these 
forms, and the averages are reported 
(n = 90); in all other cases, only 1 
parent completed the forms (n = 
115). (Importantly, results did not 
change if only mothers’ responses 
[most often the only parent present 
when there was one reporter] were 
analyzed.) These scales are nationally 
normed and provide t-scores such 
that a score of 50 represents the 
national mean, with a SD of 10.
Demographics
Parents completed several 
demographic questions, including 
their child’s race, sex, and age, and 
their household income (in quintiles: 
1 = <$25 000/year, 2 = $25 001–
50 000, 3 = $50 001–75 000, 4 = 
$75 001–$125 000, 5 = >$125 000/
year). This information is reported by 
participant group in Table 2. With the 
exception of gender (siblings were 
more likely to have a male gender 
identity than transgender or age-
matched control participants; the 
latter 2 groups were matched on this 
variable), the 3 groups did not differ 
on demographic variables.
RESULTS
Anxiety and depression t scores are 
reported in Table 3 by participant 
sample and natal sex. Transgender 
children’s rates of anxiety and 
depression were first compared 
with the scale’s midpoint (50), 
an indicator of average levels of 
depression and anxiety symptoms.38 
In terms of depression, transgender 
children’s symptoms (M = 50.1) 
did not differ from the population 
average, P = .883. In contrast, 
transgender children had elevated 
rates of anxiety compared with 
the population average (M = 54.2), 
t(72) = 4.05, P < .001. Mean anxiety 
symptoms of transgender children 
were not in the clinical, or even 
preclinical, range, but were elevated.
To assess differences between 
transgender and control children 
in our sample, we ran a 3 (group: 
transgender, siblings, controls) 
× 2 (natal sex) between-subjects 
analysis of variance for depression 
and anxiety. Natal sex was used in

this analysis, rather than affirmed 
gender, because work with children 
with GID/GD used this convention,35 
allowing interested readers to make 
comparisons to past work with 
that sample and because previous 
work has suggested differences 
in internalizing psychopathology 
between natal boys compared with 
girls with GID.35,39 For depression, 
there were no main effects of 
group, P = .320 or sex, P = .498, nor 
was there an interaction between 
condition and sex, P = .979. For 
anxiety, we found a marginally 
significant effect of group, F(2189) = 
2.91, P = .057, and no effect of sex, P = 
.990, nor an interaction, P = .664.
DISCUSSION
Socially transitioned, prepubescent 
transgender children showed typical 
rates of depression and only slightly 
elevated rates of anxiety symptoms 
compared with population averages. 
These children did not differ on 
either measure from 2 groups of 
controls: their own siblings and a 
group of age and gender-matched 
controls. Critically, transgender 
children supported in their identities 
had internalizing symptoms that 
were well below even the preclinical 
range. These findings suggest that 
familial support in general, or 
specifically via the decision to allow 
their children to socially transition, 
may be associated with better mental 
health outcomes among transgender 
children. In particular, allowing 
children to present in everyday life 
as their gender identity rather than 
their natal sex is associated with 
developmentally normative levels of 
depression and anxiety.
Critically, socially transitioned 
transgender children showed 
substantially lower rates of 
internalizing symptoms than children 
with GID reported in previous 
studies35 (see Table 4). Our findings 
align with at least 1 other report of 
low mental health problems among 
children with GID supported in 
their gender identities,34 a sample 
that may have included some 
socially transitioned transgender 
children. Comparisons between 
previous reports of children with 
GID and the current sample should 
be made cautiously, however, 
because the criteria for inclusion 
(transgender identities vs GID) and 
specific measures of internalizing 
psychopathology (PROMIS vs CBCL) 
differ across studies.
One might reasonably ask whether 
this study provides support for all 
children with gender dysphoria to 
socially transition. A few points are 
key to consider. First, all children 
in our study (unlike many children 
with the GD classification), had 
binary identities, meaning they 
identified as male or female. Thus, we 
cannot make predictions about the 
expected mental health of children 
who identify as male and female, 
as neither male nor female, or who 
identify as the gender associated 
with their natal sex but nonetheless 
exhibit behavior more often 
associated with the “other” gender 
after a social transition. Thus, just 
because a child behaves in a way 
consistent with a gender other than 
their natal sex does not mean that 
child is transgender nor that a social 
transition is advisable. Second, the 
children in this study were unique in 
many critical ways. They transitioned 
at a time when such transitions are 
quite controversial5–9 and yet did 
so anyway. Surely not all families 
with transgender children make 
this decision, meaning there are 
likely characteristics that are unique 
to these families. In addition, the 
transgender children in this study 
all socially transitioned much earlier 
than nearly all transgender adults 
alive today in the United States and

Canada. Why might they have done 
so? Possibilities that we cannot rule 
out are that these children displayed 
earlier signs of their transgender 
identities, that they were more 
insistent about those identities, that 
they represent the most extreme 
end of the spectrum of transgender 
identities, or that parents today 
are just more educated about the 
existence of transgender children. It 
is too early to tell the ways in which 
these children and these families are 
unique. Finally, the children in this 
study were not randomly assigned 
to social transitions, precluding the 
ability to make causal claims about 
the impact of social transitions 
on mental health. These data are 
suggestive, nonetheless, that social 
transitions are associated with 
positive mental health outcomes for 
transgender children.
We cannot rule out several 
alternative explanations for our 
findings. First, rather than a 
direct impact of parental support, 
these generally positive mental 
health findings could be a more 
indirect result of parent support: 
namely, feeling supported in 
general (independent of a social 
transition) may lead to higher self-
esteem,40 which in turn may lead 
to better mental health.41 Second, 
as alluded to earlier, there could 
be some unique third variable that 
explains the observed occurrence 
of typical mental health among 
socially transitioned transgender 
children. For example, perhaps some 
attribute unique to the subset of 
transgender children who are able 
to convince their parents to allow 
them to transition (eg, verbal skill, 
self-confidence) is responsible for 
these children having particularly 
good mental health, and it was this 
unique cognitive ability or aspect of 
personality that is either correlated 
with better mental health or leads 
to better mental health when a 
child feels he or she achieved his or 
her goal. Future studies examining 
children before and after social 
transitions may be able to address 
this concern. Finally, parents of 
transgender children could have 
biased reporting, reflecting a desire 
for their children to appear healthier 
than they are. We have no reasons to 
believe this was an issue but in the 
future aim to include other reporters 
(eg, teachers) to address this concern 
that others are likely to raise.
In addition to studying other 
explanations for these data, the 
current work begs for more 
research not only on children with 
other transgender identities (eg, 
children who identify as both or 
neither male and female), but also 
for work with children who have 
clear binary transgender identities, 
like the children in the current 
study, but who are not supported or 
affirmed by their families in these 
identities. Finding such children 
and particularly convincing their 
parents to allow them to participate 
in research, will be a challenge but 
one that is ultimately necessary for 
a clear understanding of the specific 
impact of transitions for these 
children.
Despite their overall relatively good 
mental health, socially transitioned 
transgender children did experience 
slightly more anxiety than the 
population average, although still 
well below the preclinical range. 
What might explain this result? 
Despite receiving considerable 
support from their families, these 
children likely still experience 
relatively high rates of peer 
victimization or smaller daily micro-
aggressions, particularly if their peers 
know that they are transgender42 
which can in turn lead to marked 
elevations of anxiety symptoms and 
anxiety disorders.43–45 Additionally, 
any transgender children who are 
living “stealth” or “undisclosed” (ie, 
whose peers are unaware of their 
transgender status), may experience 
anxiety about others discovering 
their transgender identity; previous 
work with adults has suggested that 
concealing a stigmatized identity 
can lead to psychological distress.46 
Furthermore, transgender children 
do not have the typical bodies of 
children with their gender identities, 
which could be a source of distress. 
Even when transgender children 
are allowed to use the bathroom, 
locker room, or be on the team with 
children who share their gender, the 
mere existence of these distinctions 
likely highlights the ways in which 
their bodies do not align with cultural 
expectations for children of their 
gender identity group. Relatedly, 
some children in our sample are 
approaching puberty, and most 
are aware that puberty will cause 
physical changes in an unwanted 
direction (unless puberty blockers 
are administered), which could 
generate considerable worry and 
anxiety.
Importantly, although these socially 
transitioned prepubescent children 
are doing quite well in terms of their 
mental health at this point, parents 
and clinicians of such children 
should still be on the lookout for 
potential changes in the status of 
their children’s mental health. In 
general, the prevalence of depression 
is relatively low in prepubescent 
children and rises dramatically 
during adolescence.47 It is possible 
that transgender children will exhibit 
greater anxiety and depression than 
their peers during the adolescent 
transition because of the sources of 
distress mentioned earlier, which 
will likely become worse with time 
(a possibility we aim to test with 
prospective follow-up of this sample). 
Thus, while adolescence is a time 
of increased perceptions of stress 
for many adolescents,48 many of 
these issues are exacerbated for 
transgender teens. Transgender 
adolescents, whether they do or do 
not delay puberty through medical 
intervention, often experience 
body dysphoria (as their bodies 
do not match the bodies of their

same-gender peers), making sex and 
relationships even more worrisome 
than among their nontransgender 
peers.49
CONCLUSIONS
In sum, we provide novel evidence 
of low rates of internalizing 
psychopathology in young socially 
transitioned transgender children 
who are supported in their gender 
identity. These data suggest at least 
the possibility that being transgender 
is not synonymous with, nor the 
direct result of, psychopathology 
in childhood.27 Instead, these 
results provide clear evidence that 
transgender children have levels of 
anxiety and depression no different 
from their nontransgender siblings 
and peers. As more and more parents 
are deciding to socially transition 
their children, continuing to assess 
mental health in an increasingly 
diverse group of socially transitioned 
children will be of utmost 
importance.
