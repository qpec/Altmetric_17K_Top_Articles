Abstract
Objectives: The objective was to determine the effect of apneic oxygenation (AP OX) on first pass
success without hypoxemia (FPS-H) in adult patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the
emergency department (ED).
Methods: Continuous quality improvement data were prospectively collected on all patients intubated in
an academic ED from July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015. During this period the use of AP OX was introduced
and encouraged for all patients undergoing RSI in the ED. Following each intubation, the operator
completed a standardized data form that included information on patient, operator, and intubation
characteristics. Adult patients 18 years of age or greater who underwent RSI in the ED by emergency
medicine residents were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was FPS-H, which was defined as
successful tracheal intubation on a single laryngoscope insertion without oxygen saturation falling below
90%. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of AP OX on FPS-
H.
Results: During the 2-year study period, 635 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 380 (59.8%) had AP
OX utilized and 255 (40.2%) had no AP OX utilized. In the AP OX cohort the FPS-H was 312/380 (82.1%)
and in the no AP OX cohort the FPS-H was 176/255 (69.0%) (difference = 13.1%, 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 6.2% to 19.9%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of AP OX was associated
with an increased odds of FPS-H (adjusted odds ratio = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5 to 3.3).
Conclusions: The use of AP OX during the RSI of adult patients in the ED was associated with a
significant increase in FPS-H. These results suggest that the use of AP OX has the potential to increase the
safety of RSI in the ED by reducing the number of intubation attempts and the incidence of hypoxemia.

 incidence of adverse events increases drastically.1 Stud-
ies also suggest that hypoxemia is associated with
adverse outcomes in some critically ill patients such as
those
with
traumatic
brain
injury.7–9
To
maximize
patient safety a reasonable goal for emergency intuba-
tion should be to achieve first pass success without the
occurrence of hypoxemia (FPS-H).
Apneic oxygenation (AP OX) is a concept that has
been understood for decades based on studies per-
formed in the operating room.10–13 It, however, has only
recently been evaluated for use during emergency intu-
bation.14–16 AP OX involves the delivery of oxygen to
the upper airway, typically by nasal cannula, during
periods of apnea.17 Studies in the controlled setting of
the operating room on elective surgical patients have
demonstrated that the use of AP OX can significantly
delay
the
onset
of
oxygen
desaturation,
effectively
extending the period of safe apnea.18,19 AP OX may be
a useful technique for rapid sequence intubation (RSI)
in the ED as it may be able to improve the safety of the
procedure by extending the safe apnea time thereby
reducing the number of intubation attempts and the
incidence of hypoxemia. The goal of this investigation is
to determine the effect of AP OX on FPS-H.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This is a single-center observational study of ED intuba-
tions performed over the 2-year period from July 1,
2013, to June 30, 2015, recorded in a continuous quality
improvement (CQI) database. It was conducted at a 61-
bed tertiary care academic ED and Level I trauma cen-
ter with an annual census of approximately 70,000 visits.
This institution has an ACGME-accredited 3-year emer-
gency medicine (EM) residency program, as well as a
5-year
combined
EM/pediatrics
residency
program.
Intubations in this ED are performed primarily by EM
residents under direct EM attending supervision. Multi-
ple laryngoscopes were available in the ED during the
study period, including the direct laryngoscope, the
GlideScope video laryngoscope, and the C-MAC video
laryngoscope. Residents receive extensive training on
airway management including both direct laryngoscopy
and video laryngoscopy. All residents participate in a
1-month anesthesiology rotation during their first post-
graduate year (PGY) and also have extensive training in
the simulation lab throughout their residency training.
On July 1, 2013, AP OX was introduced in our ED for
emergency
intubation.
EM
residents
were
strongly
encouraged to use AP OX with a nasal cannula at an
oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min for all patients undergoing
RSI. This was not required by protocol, but suggested
as a best practice based on expert recommendation.17
The recommended oxygenation technique is to place a
standard nasal cannula at 15 L/min on the patient and
then add to that a nonrebreather face mask at 15 L/min.
After at least 3 minutes of preoxygenation, RSI drugs
are administered and when paralysis ensues the face
mask is removed, the AP OX nasal cannula is left in
place, and laryngoscopy is performed. A classic RSI
technique is used in our ED and thus patients do not
receive positive pressure ventilation during RSI, unless
necessitated by hypoxemia. The device available in the
ED that is used for preoxygenation is the CareFusion
AirLife adult oxygen mask (Product No. Ref 001203) and
the device available for the administration of AP OX is
the TeleFlex Medical Hudson RCI nasal cannula with 7-
foot Star Lumen tubing (Product No. Ref 1103).
The study design generally conformed with the rec-
ommendations of the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) state-
ment.20 This project was granted exemption by the
University of Arizona institutional review board.
Study Population
This study included adult patients 18 years of age and
older who underwent RSI in the ED by an EM resident.
Only patients that had complete oxygen saturation data
documented as well as a starting saturation ≥90% were
included in the analysis (see Figure 1 for details of
patients included in the study).
Methods and Measurements
After each ED intubation a single-page (double sided)

 and captures important clinical information regarding
the procedure. Data captured on the CQI form included
patient, operator, and intubation characteristics. Infor-
mation collected included patient age, sex and diagno-
sis, operator PGY, reason for intubation, presence of
difficult airway characteristics (DACs), drugs used for
intubation, device used on each attempt, outcome of
each
attempt,
and
the
starting
and
lowest
oxygen
saturation during the entire intubation. Oxygenation
methods used before and during intubation are also
documented. The duration of preoxygenation before
intubation is documented as follows: none, 1 minute,
2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, or >5 min-
utes. This is not formally timed, but rather based on
the operator’s estimation of time. The use of AP OX
and the oxygen flow rate used during intubation is
documented as follows: none, 5 L/min, 10 L/min, 15 L/
min, or >15 L/min.
An intubation attempt was defined as the insertion of
the laryngoscope blade into the mouth of the patient,
regardless whether an attempt was made to insert a tra-
cheal tube. First pass success (FPS) was defined as suc-
cessful tracheal intubation on a single laryngoscope
insertion. FPS-H was defined as FPS without oxygen
saturations falling below 90% during the intubation.
Difficult airway characteristics documented on the
CQI form include blood or vomit in the airway, pres-
ence of a cervical collar or immobility, airway edema,
facial or neck trauma, small mandible, short neck, large
tongue, restricted mouth opening, and obesity.
The senior investigator reviewed all data forms in real
time and any incomplete forms were returned to the
operator for completion. These forms were included in
the study, unless they had missing oxygen saturation
data. Based on cross-referencing with the electronic
medical record and the hospital admission log there
were no missing data forms in the database (100% com-
pliance). The data from the paper forms were entered
into Excel for Windows 2013 (Microsoft) and then
transferred and coded into STATA 13 (StataCorp) for
statistical analysis.
Outcome Measure
The primary outcome was FPS-H, which was defined as
successful tracheal intubation on a single laryngoscope
insertion without oxygen saturations falling below 90%.
Data Analysis
Patients were categorized into two cohorts: those that
had AP OX utilized (AP OX cohort) and those who did
not have AP OX utilized (no AP OX cohort). Summary
statistics were calculated for patient, intubation, and
operator
characteristics.
Continuous
normally
dis-
tributed variables were reported as means with stan-
dard
deviations
(SDs).
Patient
age
was
the
only
continuous variable in the data set. Categorical vari-
ables were reported as percentages.
A standard multivariate logistic regression analysis
was performed to evaluate the association between AP
OX and FPS-H. Confounders considered to be pertinent
based on clinical expertise of the investigators as well
as previous investigations were: trauma status, device
type (video laryngoscope vs. direct laryngoscope), start-
ing oxygen saturation at time of intubation (>93% vs.
≤93%),
duration
of
preoxygenation
(<3 minutes
vs.
≥3 minutes),
neuromuscular
blocking agent (NMBA),
induction agent, number of DACs, reason for device
selection, and operator PGY (1, 2, or ≥3 years). The
intent was not to develop a parsimonious model; thus
all potential confounders were included in the model
and no automated variable selection techniques were
used. There was no theoretical basis to consider any
model interactions. The goodness of fit of the model
was checked by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The model
was checked for multicollinearity by evaluating variance
inflation factors. Influential observations were identified
by Pregibon’s Delta-Beta. All analyses were conducted
in STATA 13 (StataCorp).
There are no previous studies using the outcome vari-
able FPS-H on which to base a power calculation. Based
on our experience in our institution with intubation suc-
cess and hypoxemia we estimated that FPS-H might
increase from a baseline rate of 70% to 80% with the
use of AP OX. Thus the study was powered to detect a
10% absolute change in FPS-H. Using an alpha of 0.05
and power of 80%, we estimated that 250 subjects
would be required in each cohort.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Subjects
A total of 1,140 intubations were performed in the ED
over the 2-year study period. After excluding patients
who were less than 18 years of age (117), did not
undergo RSI (167), were not intubated by EM residents
(35), had incomplete saturation data (143), or had a
starting saturation <90% (43), 635 patients were eligible
for analysis. In this group 380 patients (59.8%) were in
the AP OX cohort and 255 patients (40.2%) were in the
no AP OX cohort (see Figure 1 for details of the study
group).
The majority of patients in both cohorts were intu-
bated for airway protection (AP OX 74.7% and no AP
OX 76.9%). Very few patients were on bilevel positive
airway pressure (BiPAP) prior to intubation (AP OX
6.8% and no AP OX 6.7%). Trauma patients comprised
26.3% of the AP OX intubations and 42.4% of the no
AP OX intubations (see Table 1 for specifics of patient,
operator, and intubation characteristics).
Main Results
There were 380 patients who received AP OX and 255
patients who did not receive AP OX. In the AP OX
cohort the oxygen flow rates used were as follows: 59
(15.5%) received 5 L/min, 56 (14.7%) received 10 L/min,
158 (41.6%) received 15 L/min and 107 (28.2%) received
>15 L/min.
In the AP OX cohort the FPS-H was 312/380 (82.1%)
and in the no AP OX cohort the FPS-H was 176/255
(69.0%;

to 13.2%). In the AP OX cohort the incidence of hypox-
emia in those with FPS was 30/342 (8.8%) and in the no
AP OX cohort the incidence of hypoxemia in those with

AP OX cohort the overall incidence of hypoxemia was
51/255 (20.0%; difference = �7.4%, 95% CI = �13.3%
to �1.4%).
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the
use of AP OX was associated with an increased odds of
FPS-H (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5 to
3.3; see Table 2 for details). According to the Hosmer-
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, the model fit the data
well (p = 0.349). There were 22 patients with repeat vis-
its. After repeat visits were excluded, the results did not
change (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5 to 3.3). There was no
multicollinearity between variables in the model. There
were
a
few
influential
observations
which
when
excluded from the model did not change the results.
DISCUSSION
Airway management in the ED frequently requires tra-
cheal intubation, which is typically performed using an
RSI technique.21 Intubation under emergent conditions
has been shown to be associated with a high incidence
of adverse events.1–6,9,22,23 There are multiple reasons
for this including the precipitous nature of these intuba-
tions, the unfasted state of the patients, and the underly-
ing physiologic derangements of the patients. Studies

Sakles et al. • AP OX FOR RSI IN THE ED
 have
shown
that
multiple
intubation
attempts
are
associated with adverse events.1,2,6 Hypoxemia in the
early phase of some critically ill patients has also been
associated with worse outcomes.7,8 It would seem rea-
sonable, then, that to maximize patient safety, the goal of
emergency intubation in the critically ill is to achieve
FPS-H. In this study we sought to determine the effect of
AP OX on FPS-H in patients undergoing RSI in the ED.
We found that the use of AP OX was associated with a
significant increase in FPS-H during RSI in the ED by
emergency physicians. The improvement in FPS-H was
due to both an increase in FPS (+7.6%) and a decrease in
the incidence of oxygen desaturation in patients with FPS
(�7.4%) in patients who had AP OX utilized.
Maximizing FPS-H is of great clinical importance as
studies
have
demonstrated
that
multiple
intubation
attempts, as well as hypoxemia, are associated with an
increase in adverse events.1,2,6–8 A 10-year study by
Mort6 of critically ill patients requiring emergent intuba-
tion found that when more than two attempts were
needed to successfully secure the airway there was a
marked increase in hypoxemia, aspiration, bradycardia,
and cardiac arrest. A multicenter ED study by Hase-
gawa et al.2 found that when successful intubation was
completed in two or less attempts the incidence of at
least one adverse event was 9% compared to 35% when
more than two attempts were required. A study by
Sakles et al.1 in the ED found that when intubation was
successfully completed on the first attempt the incidence
of one or more adverse events was 14.2%. However,
when a second attempt was required to achieve suc-
cessful
intubation
the
incidence
of
adverse
events
increased to 47.2%. While these studies have shown the
importance of minimizing the number of attempts to
prevent adverse events, other studies have demon-
strated that the occurrence of hypoxemia in some criti-
cally ill patients is associated with adverse outcomes.7,8
For example, Chi et al.7 demonstrated in a prospective
multicenter study that the occurrence of hypoxemia in
the prehospital phase of patients with traumatic brain
injuries was associated with an increase in the odds of
mortality. This is of great importance as hypoxemia has
been demonstrated to occur with surprising regularity
during emergent intubations. A recent study by Bodily
et al.24 evaluated the incidence and duration of oxygen
desaturation during RSI in the ED. They found that of
166 patients undergoing RSI nearly 36% experienced
oxygen desaturation, with a median duration of 80 sec-
onds. Strategies to reduce the number of attempts and
the occurrence of hypoxemia during intubation can
potentially improve the quality of care for patients in
the ED.
Although the use of AP OX was encouraged through-
out the study period, it was only used in 60% of the
patients undergoing RSI in our ED. While this may
seem like a low compliance, it must be borne in mind
that there is currently very little evidence demonstrating
the effectiveness of AP OX during emergency airway
management. In fact, when his study was initiated there
was not a single paper published evaluating AP OX for
emergency airway management. The decision to incor-
porate AP OX into our practice environment was based
on expert opinion, which in turn was based on data
extrapolated on stable, elective surgical patients in the
operating room.17 It is noteworthy that the use of AP
OX increased greatly over the 2-year study period from
39% in the first month to 88% in the last month. It is
interesting that when AP OX was used, the oxygen flow
rate used by operators varied considerably, with less
than half using the suggested 15 L/min. This is likely a
cultural phenomenon due to the fact that physicians
have historically been instructed to use no more than
6 L/min when using a nasal cannula.25 A recent study
by Brainard et al.,26 however, found that 15 L/min of
oxygen through a standard nasal cannula was well tol-
erated by volunteers and produced no adverse events.
As practitioners become more comfortable with using
high-flow oxygen through standard nasal cannula there
will likely be more acceptance of using a flow of 15 L/
min. Over our study period the use of AP OX at the
suggested flow of 15 L/min increased from 33% in the
first month to 61% in the last month.
The literature on AP OX for RSI in critical patients is
limited
and
has
yielded
somewhat
conflicting
results.14,16 A before-and-after study on AP OX by
Wimalasena et al.14 in the prehospital setting demon-
strated a reduction in the incidence of oxygen desatura-
tion when AP OX was incorporated into their RSI
protocol. AP OX at 15 L/min was incorporated into
their RSI protocol and a comparison was made between

 the 310 patients who were intubated in the 2-year per-
iod before the implementation of AP OX and the 418
patients in the 2-year period after its implementation. In
this undifferentiated patient population the use of AP
OX was associated with a decrease in the incidence of
desaturation from 22.6% to 16.5%. Their 6.1% reduction
in the incidence of desaturation during RSI is similar to
the 7.4% reduction we found. Interestingly, they found
no difference in FPS between patients who had AP OX
utilized and those who did not, whereas we found a sig-
nificant improvement. A possible explanation for this
discrepancy is that the intubations performed in their
study were performed by experienced physicians and
paramedics, whereas in our study the intubations were
performed by EM residents during their training. It is
conceivable
that
the
possible
delay
in
desaturation
afforded by AP OX allowed our less experienced opera-
tors more time for laryngoscopy, and thus they were
able to achieve a higher FPS.
The only randomized, controlled trial evaluating the
effectiveness of AP OX for emergent intubation found
that AP OX had no benefit in reducing the incidence of
hypoxemia.16 In this study by Semler et al.16 150 criti-
cally ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) were ran-
domized to receive AP OX at 15 L/min by high-flow
nasal cannula or “usual care” (no AP OX). They found no
difference in the median lowest arterial saturation (92%
vs. 90%) or in the incidence of desaturation to <90%
(44.7% vs. 47.2%). Their ICU patient population, how-
ever, was significantly different than our ED population.
Over half of their patients required intubation for respi-
ratory failure and almost one-third of them were on non-
invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) prior to
intubation. This indicates that their patient population
had a very high incidence of underlying pulmonary dis-
ease. This is in contrast to our patient population where
the majority of patients were intubated for airway pro-
tection and very few were on non-invasive positive pres-
sure ventilation (NIPPV) prior to intubation. It is possible
that AP OX is effective in patients with normal lung
function but is of limited or no benefit in patients with
severe pulmonary disease, particularly those with signifi-
cant right-to-left shunts. If a patient requires NIPPV to
adequately oxygenate before intubation, it seems unli-
kely that AP OX is going to be effective in maintaining
oxygen saturations during apnea. Clearly, further work
is necessary to determine which critical patients can
benefit from AP OX during emergent intubation.
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, which
controlled for multiple potential confounders, we found
the use of AP OX to be associated with an increased
odds of FPS-H. Operators who utilized AP OX were
twice as likely to achieve FPS-H. We also identified
other factors that were associated with FPS-H, some of
which are modifiable and some which are not. A start-
ing oxygen saturation >93% was associated with an
almost fivefold increase in FPS-H. This is consistent
with the work of Davis et al.27 who found that patients
who had a starting oxygen saturation of ≤93% during
prehospital
RSI
universally
desaturated
during
the
intubation attempt. This highlights the importance of
optimizing oxygenation prior to any attempts at intuba-
tion.17 Interestingly, in our multivariate regression anal-
ysis preoxygenation was not found to be associated
with FPS-H. This is likely due to a type II error as the
vast majority of patients in our study received preoxy-
genation. To confidently determine the effect of preoxy-
genation we may have needed more patients who did
not receive preoxygenation in the study.
Our
multivariate
logistic
regression
also
demon-
strated that the use of a video laryngoscope was posi-
tively
associated
with
FPS-H.
These
results
are
consistent with numerous studies that have demon-
strated a higher FPS with the use of a video laryngo-
scope.28–32 An operator PGY of 3 or more was also
associated with an increase in FPS-H, which is consis-
tent with other studies evaluating the performance of
EM residents.33–35 The only factor identified in the
regression analysis that was associated with a reduction
in FPS-H was the number of DACs, which has been
demonstrated in other studies to be associated with a
reduced odds of FPS.33,36
LIMITATIONS
This study has several limitations. The main limitation is
that this was an observational study and thus the
patients were not randomized into the AP OX and no
AP OX cohorts. There may be differences in the two
cohorts, beside the use of AP OX, which may have an
effect on the outcome of FPS-H. For example, there
were more trauma patients and more patients with diffi-
cult airways in the no AP OX cohort. These differences
could be partly responsible for the difference in FPS-H
we observed in our study. We attempted to control for
the differences by performing a multivariate logistic
regression analysis that incorporated many of the likely
confounders. These variables included reason for device
selection,
trauma
status,
device
used,
NMBA
used,
induction agent used, DACs, operator PGY, use of pre-
oxygenation, and starting oxygen saturation. After per-
forming the multivariate regression analysis, we still
found that AP OX was associated with a higher FPS-H.
Nonetheless, there may be unidentified confounders
that we were unaware of that may have affected the
results. For example, it may be that operators that chose
to utilize AP OX were more skilled and conscientious
about
maintaining
adequate oxygenation
saturations
during intubation. This potentially could be responsible
for some of the increase in FPS-H we observed in this
study.
Another limitation is that all data collected in the
study, including oxygen saturations, were documented
by the operator after the intubation was completed.
Thus there is the possibility of inaccuracies in the data
set due to the self-report nature of our data collection. It
is has been well demonstrated that self-report data on
emergent intubations can vary from an objective analy-
sis of the actual events. For example, Kerrey et al.37 per-
formed a video review of 114 pediatric RSIs in the ED
and found that operators tended to overreport FPS and
underreport adverse events. FPS, as measured during
video review by the investigators, was found to be 6%
lower than what the operators had documented in the
written record. It would have been preferable to have
more objective data in our study, such as that obtained
708
Sakles et al. • AP OX FOR RSI IN THE ED
 by video review, but this unfortunately was not possible
in our institution. Although there might be some under-
or overreporting in our data set, there is no reason to
believe that this would be different between the two
cohorts. Another limitation is that we had to exclude a
large number of patients who had missing oxygen satu-
ration data. Inclusion of these patients in our study
could have affected our results. Residents are taught to
be cognizant of the oxygen saturations during intuba-
tion and document them on the airway data form. How-
ever, they are instructed to omit the oxygen saturation
data from the form if they do not know the actual satu-
rations. We believe that it is preferable to have missing
data rather than inaccurate data in our airway database.
Finally, another limitation is that all intubations per-
formed in this study were by EM residents, the majority
with video laryngoscopes, and thus our results may not
be generalizable to other ED clinical settings. For exam-
ple AP OX may be of less benefit to operators who are
very skilled at laryngoscopy and can complete the intu-
bation very quickly.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we found that the use of apneic oxygena-
tion during rapid sequence intubation in the ED was
associated with an increase in first pass success without
hypoxemia. Apneic oxygenation has the potential to
improve the safety of emergency airway management
by reducing the number of intubation attempts and the
incidence of hypoxemia. A randomized control trial is
warranted to confirm these findings.
