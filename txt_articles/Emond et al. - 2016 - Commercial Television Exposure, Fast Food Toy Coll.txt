Abstract
Objective—To assess the associations between children's exposure to TV networks that aired 
child-directed advertisements for children's fast food meals with the collection of fast food meal 
toy premiums and frequency of family visits to those restaurants.
Study design—One hundred parents of children 3–7 years old were recruited from a rural 
pediatrics clinic during 2011; families receiving Medicaid were oversampled. Parents reported the 
child's television viewing habits and family visit frequency to the fast food restaurants 
participating in child-directed TV marketing at the time, and their child's requests for visits to and 
the collecting of toy premiums from those restaurants. Logistic regression models assessed 
adjusted associations between a child's TV viewing with more frequent restaurant visits (≥monthly 
in this population). Structural equation modeling assessed if child requests or toy collecting 
mediated that association.
Results—Thirty-seven percent of parents reported ≥monthly visits to the select fast food 
restaurants. Among children, 54% requested visits to and 29% collected toys from those 
restaurants. Greater child commercial TV viewing was significantly associated with more frequent 
family visits to those fast food restaurants (adjusted odds ratio 2.84 for each one-unit increase in 
the child's commercial TV viewing scale, p<0.001); toy collecting partially mediated that positive 
association.

 Conclusions—Higher exposure among children to commercial TV networks that aired child-
directed ads for children's fast food meals was associated with more frequent family visits to those 
fast food restaurants. Child desire for toy premiums may be a mediating factor.
Fast food companies have frequently participated in child-directed marketing (i.e., 
marketing that targets those under the age of 12). In 2009, more than $714 million was spent 
in the U.S.1 with TV advertising accounting for 90% of all child-directed marketing over 
traditional and newer media.1 Exposure to food ads on TV influences the food preferences 
and requests of children, 2–4 however, mediating mechanisms are not clear. A study of all 
fast food meal ads aired in the U.S. during July 2009–June 20105 demonstrated that child-
directed ads frequently featured premiums such as toys and were less likely to emphasize 
food compared with adult-directed ads. A study among 100 children aged 3–7 years old—
those in the target audience for child-directed fast food meal ads—demonstrated that 
children were equally as likely to notice premiums after viewing a child-directed fast food 
meal ad as they were to notice food.6 Moreover, consumer data covering 2006–2009 
submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by major food, beverage and fast food 
companies1 suggested that the decision among families to eat at a fast food restaurant is 
often driven by children, and the promotion of toys in fast food meals is an effective way to 
shape a child's requests. Data were proprietary, however, and specific data reported by any 
company were not included in that report.
This study examined cross-sectional associations between a child's commercial TV exposure 
over networks that featured child-directed ads for children's fast food meals with frequency 
of family visits to the two fast food restaurants that were the major participants in child-
directed TV advertising at the time.5 We hypothesized that greater commercial TV viewing 
by the child would be associated with a greater frequency of family visits to those select fast 
food restaurants. Further, we hypothesized that child requests for visits to those restaurants 
and the collection of toy premiums from those restaurants would mediate that association.
Methods
Data were collected as part of a 2011 study to assess how young children interpret fast food 
advertising;7 data were analyzed in 2014. Briefly, families of children aged 3–7 years were 
identified from medical records at a rural New England hospital. Eligible families were sent 
letters describing the study with an opt-out option (3% declined). Of the 217 eligible 
parents, 133 agreed to participate; 23 participants failed to show for the study visit and 10 
visits were excluded because of technical errors, resulting in a final sample of 100 children 
and one of their parents or guardians. Although children viewed TV advertisements for fast 
food meals and underwent a structured interview, parents completed a questionnaire. The 
Institutional Review Board at Dartmouth College approved all study procedures.
Outcome measure: Frequency of visits to fast food restaurants
Study measures were specific to the two fast food restaurants that were the primary 
participants in child-directed TV advertising at the time the study was completed.5 In 
separate questions, parents reported how often in a typical month they ate at a McDonald's 
or Burger King restaurant (never, <1 a month, 1–3 times a month, 1–6 times a week, every

 day). A composite variable based on the most frequent response to either question was 
created. Only one parent reported visits 1–6 times a week, and no parent reported visits 
every day. Thus, responses were dichotomized as <1 a month versus ≥1 times a month.
Exposure: Child's commercial TV viewing
Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, Cartoon Network and Disney are ad-supported cable TV networks 
that cater to preschoolers and young children. Those four network channels are part of paid 
cable or satellite TV subscriptions in the U.S, and the majority of U.S. households (79%), 
including the majority of lower-income households with children (62%), have such 
subscriptions.8 During 2009–2010, 79% of all child-directed fast food ads were aired on 
those four networks.5 Parents reported how often their child watched TV over those four 
networks on a Likert scale (never, <1 a month, 1–3 times a month, 1–6 times a week and 
every day). Minutes per day of viewing on each network were not collected. We therefore 
took the average response over those four networks to create one scale to reflect exposure to 
children's TV networks that featured child-directed advertising for children's fast food meals 
(Cronbach's alpha=0.76), anchored at never (0) to daily (4) on each network. Parents also 
reported their child's frequency of viewing TV on PBS, which was included in analyses as a 
proxy for ad-free TV exposure. Additionally, parents reported the hours their child viewed 
TV on a weekday and over the weekend; response options for each item were 0, <1 hour, 
and 1–2, 2–4 hours and 4+ hours. Few parents reported no TV viewing or more than 4 hours 
of TV viewing a day, and therefore categories were collapsed as <1 hour, 1–2 hours and >2 
hours per day. Parents also reported the number of TVs in the home and the presence of a 
TV in the child's bedroom.
Potential Mediators: Child requests for fast food and toy collecting
Parents were asked to rate their agreement with the following items with respect to the two 
specific fast food restaurants included in this study: 1) my child requests trips to these 
restaurants and 2) my child collects toys from these restaurants. Each item was scored on a 
5-point Likert scale and responses were dichotomized as agree (strongly agree, agree) versus 
disagree (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion).
Covariates
A scale for parental expectancies of fast food value (Cronbach's alpha=0.72) was created by 
summing parental responses to the following items: 1) I like the taste of the food at these 
restaurants, 2) you get a lot for your money at these restaurants, 3) my family likes the price 
of the food at these restaurants and 4) eating in these restaurants is convenient (strongly 
disagree (0) to strongly agree (4)). Parents reported on child race/ethnicity, parental 
education, household income and health insurance status. Child's weight and height were 
extracted from the medical record, and age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles were 
computed;9 overweight status was defined as ≥85th percentile.
Statistical analyses
Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of more frequent visits to 
the select fast food restaurants on the child's commercial TV viewing time, adjusted for

 parental education, Medicaid insurance status and parental fast food expectancies. Those 
covariates were included because they were related to monthly visits at the p<0.10 level 
from bivariate analyses. Household income was also associated with monthly visits at the 
p<0.10 level, yet health insurance status and household income were highly, positively 
correlated (p<0.001). Thus, for a parsimonious model, health insurance status (objectively 
measured) was included as a covariate but household income (self-reported) was not. 
Finally, structural equation modeling was used to formally test if child requests for fast food 
or child toy collecting mediated the association between the child's commercial TV viewing 
and more frequent visits to the select fast food restaurants, adjusted for the same covariates 
list above. Results were interpreted under a joint significance approach,10 which concludes 
mediation is present when the direct paths from the exposure to the mediator and from the 
mediator to the outcome are both statistically significant. Robust weighted least-square 
estimators were used to estimate parameters in the model; p-values <0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using the R Language and Environment 
for Statistical Computing, version 3.0.2 (Vienna, Austria) and Mplus, version 6.12 (Muthén 
& Muthén, Los Angeles, CA).
Results
Among the 100 child participants, mean age was 5.3 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.4), 
one-half were male, and most were white (87%) and non-Hispanic (95%). Fifty-five percent 
of parents graduated college and 37% of families received Medicaid health insurance. 
Thirty-seven percent of parents reported more frequent visits to the select fast food 
restaurants. Factors significantly associated with more frequent visits (Table I) were lower 
levels of parental education, lower household income, receiving Medicaid health insurance, 
greater parental expectancies of fast food value, more TVs in the home and a TV in the 
child's bedroom (all p<0.05). More time spent by the child watching TV on weekdays and 
on weekend days was also associated with more frequent visits, as was more time spent 
viewing commercial TV. Frequency of viewing PBS was not associated with more frequent 
visits to the select fast food restaurants.
Only 19 (19%) parents reported that their child did not view any of the four commercial 
cable networks. Among those 19 parents, 15 were college graduates and 14 received private 
health insurance. Children's mean commercial TV viewing scores were positively correlated 
with total time spent viewing TV on weekdays and on weekends. Mean (SD) commercial 
TV scores by hours of TV viewing on weekdays were: 0.8 (0.8) for <1 hour of TV, 1.5 (0.9) 
for 1–2 hours of TV, and 2.3 (1.0) for >2 hours of TV (p<0.001). Mean (SD) commercial 
TV scores by hours of TV viewing on weekends were: 0.8 (0.9) for <1 hour of TV, 1.3 (0.9) 
for 1–2 hours of TV, and 2.0 (0.9) for >2 hours of TV (p<0.001).
Fifty-four children (54%) requested visits to one of the two fast food restaurants. Mean 
commercial TV scores were greater among children who made requests compared with 
those who did not (1.5 vs. 1.1; p=0.030). Twenty-nine children (29%) collected toy 
premiums from the restaurants, and mean commercial TV scores were greater among those 
who collected toys compared with those who did not (1.9 vs. 1.1; p<0.001). Of the 29 
children who collected toy premiums, 24 (82.8%) also made requests to visit the select fast

 food restaurants; 5 (17.2%) collected toy premiums but did not request visits to the select 
fast food restaurants. PBS TV viewing was not associated with requests (p=0.534) or toy 
collecting (p=0.391).
In a series of adjusted logistic regression models (Table II) a greater frequency of viewing 
commercial TV by the child was significantly associated with more frequent visits to the fast 
food restaurants by the family (Model 1), but the child's PBS TV viewing frequency was not 
(Model 2). Specifically, families were 2.84 times more likely to frequently visit the select 
fast food restaurants with each 1-point increase in the child's commercial TV viewing score. 
We plotted the log-odds of the adjusted predicted probabilities of more frequent fast food 
restaurant visits against the child's commercial TV viewing scores, and results supported a 
linear dose response relationship (Pearson's rho 0.88, p<0.001). Additionally, child requests 
for trips to the select fast food restaurants (Model 3) and child collecting of toy premiums 
from those restaurants (Model 4) were both associated with more frequent visits by the 
family.
Figure 1 (available at www.jpeds.com) presents results from the adjusted structural equation 
model that assessed the mediating effect of child toy collecting on the association between 
the child's commercial TV viewing and more frequent visits to the select fast food 
restaurants. Toy collecting was a partial mediator of that path under a joint significance test. 
Specifically, there was a statistically significant direct path from child's commercial TV 
viewing to toy collecting and from toy collecting to more frequent visits to the select fast 
food restaurants. The mediation was not complete, however, as there remained a statistically 
significant direct path between the child's commercial TV exposure and more frequent 
visits. In a similar adjusted structural equation model (not shown), child requests for visits to 
the select fast food restaurants appeared to be a mediator between the child's commercial TV 
viewing time and more frequent visits to the select fast food restaurants. Namely, there were 
positive direct paths from the child's commercial TV viewing to child requests (OR 1.58; 
95% CI 0.97–2.56; p=0.063) and from child requests to more frequent visits (OR 1.63; 95% 
CI: 0.93–2.87; p=0.091). However, findings did not reach statistical significance.
Figure 2 presents the associations between the child's commercial TV score and toy 
collecting, stratified by family frequency of visiting the select fast food restaurants. The 
mean child's commercial TV score appeared greater among children who collected fast food 
toys within both strata, although neither difference reached statistical significance.
Discussion
Among this sample of parents and their young children, the more frequently a child viewed 
commercial TV that featured child-directed fast food meal advertising, the greater the 
likelihood their family visited fast food restaurants that marketed directly to children on TV 
at the time. In contrast, there was no association between a child's PBS TV viewing and visit 
frequency to those restaurants. Additionally, greater commercial TV exposure was 
associated with requests to and the collecting of toy premiums from fast food restaurants 
that marketed to children on TV, and the child's collecting of toy premiums partially 
mediated the positive association between commercial TV exposure and more frequent visits

 to those restaurants. Results are consistent with consumer research data as summarized by 
the FTC that suggested child requests often shape a family's decision to visit a fast food 
restaurant, and that premiums are an effective way to influence a child's requests.1 This 
study reports evidence of a mediating mechanism in that relationship in the publicly 
accessible scientific literature.
This study was cross-sectional, and we are unable to determine the temporality of the 
associations between toy collecting and fast food visits. Those associations are likely 
reciprocal, in that more frequent visits to the select fast food restaurants lead to more toys 
received by the child, which in turn increases a child's desire for more visits to the select fast 
food restaurants. Therefore, we assumed toy collecting by the child reflected the child's 
desire for fast food toys and was on the causal path between commercial TV viewing and 
fast food restaurant visits. In support of that assumption, children who collected toys were 
largely a subset of those who made visit requests to the select fast food restaurants. We also 
observed a positive, although not statistically significant, association between the child's 
commercial TV viewing and toy collecting among families that frequently visited the select 
fast food restaurants. Therefore, although we do not know if exposure to child-directed TV 
ads for fast food preceded the initial visit to one of the select fast food restaurants for the 
purpose of receiving a toy, study findings provide some of the first evidence that a child's 
commercial TV exposure likely reinforces the desire to visit fast food restaurants for the 
purpose of collecting toys.
Several studies have documented a positive link between a child's overall TV viewing and 
their food preferences and requests.2–4,11 The study is unique as it provides a framework to 
model potential mediating effects between a child's commercial TV exposure and family 
food purchases. Specifically, findings begin to document that a child's food preferences may 
be partially shaped by a desire for toy premiums featured in TV ads. Findings need 
confirmation in larger studies enrolling more diverse samples. Further, future studies should 
collect more detailed measures of a child's TV viewing habits, child pestering for fast food 
visits and toys, and a parent's behavior of visiting fast food restaurants. Importantly, 
prospective studies that monitor the change in a child's exposure to commercial TV, 
awareness of TV ads for fast food and requests to visit fast food restaurants are needed to 
clarify causal pathways.
Study findings must be interpreted cautiously in light of study limitations. Foremost, we 
argue that children who collected fast food toy premiums also desired those toys; however, 
we did not ask parents if their child requested visits to fast food restaurants in order to 
collect toys. Visit frequency to the two fast foods restaurants included in this study was 
lower than expected when considering national estimates. For example, 17% of children in 
the U.S. consume fast-food burgers on any given day.12 Families in our study were recruited 
from a non-metropolitan area where there are limited fast food restaurants, and limited 
access to a motor vehicle among lower-income families in this area further impacts visit 
frequency to fast-food restaurants.13 Thus, study findings are not generalizable to the U.S. as 
a whole and in particular are not generalizable to metropolitan communities.

 As with any cross-sectional study, we must be cautious in judging cause-and-effect. It is also 
possible that self-reported measures were underreported, or that other unmeasured variables 
confounded reported associations. For example, children with greater commercial TV 
exposure also likely view many ads including ads for toys, and fast food premiums are often 
cross-marketed with popular TV and movie characters.1 Thus, it is possible that children 
with greater commercial TV exposure may be more receptive to fast food premiums because 
of greater exposure to toy ads or cross-promotional marketing practices. This study did not 
include other methods of child-directed marketing such websites, advergames,14 restaurant 
signage and point of purchase marketing,15 and we did not assess the child's dietary intake 
or food purchases (including children's meals) at fast food restaurants. Those measures 
should be addressed in a larger, more generalizable longitudinal study. Finally, study 
measures were specific to the fast food restaurants that participated in child-directed TV 
advertising at the time, and we are not able to address if commercial TV exposure related to 
increased visits to other types of restaurants.
Results from this study provide an initial step in documenting the influence that fast food 
premiums may have on child requests and ultimately parental fast food purchases. 
Specifically, study findings provide preliminary evidence of a strong, positive association 
between the child's commercial TV exposure and more frequent family visits to the fast food 
restaurants that engaged in child-directed TV advertising at the time. Findings further 
suggest that a child's collection of toy premiums from those fast food restaurants may 
partially mediate that positive association. Given that most foods and beverages offered at 
fast food restaurants continue to be nutritionally poor, a more critical examination of child-
directed marketing of fast food meals is warranted.
