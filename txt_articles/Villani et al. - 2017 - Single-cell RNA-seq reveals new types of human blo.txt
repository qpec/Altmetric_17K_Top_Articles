 Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis and 
antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized subtypes. However, their identities and 
interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) of ~2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. 
Our study reveals: a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but 
potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of 
DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and 
circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more 
accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and 
disease.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are mononuclear phagocytes found in blood, lymphoid organs, and all 
tissues. One of their central functions is to ingest materials such as pathogens, present 
processed epitopes to T cells, and regulate innate and adaptive immune responses (1–3). 
DCs are heterogeneous and consist of multiple subtypes with unique functions that have 
been defined over the past decade in mice and humans. However, it is unclear how many DC 
subtypes exist, how they are related to each other, and how they differ from other 
mononuclear phagocytes.
Numerous studies have shown that human dendritic cells express high levels of major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (e.g., HLA-DR), a molecule essential for antigen 
presentation, and lack key markers of T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, granulocyte 
and monocytes. In the blood, DC subtypes include CD11C+ conventional DCs (cDCs), 
consisting of either CD141+ or CD1C+ cells, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), consisting of 
CD123+ cells. cDCs are effective at antigen-specific stimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 
whereas pDCs specialize in producing type I interferons in response to viruses. pDCs and 
cDC subtypes differ in their expression of numerous sensors, pathways and effectors, and 
play distinct roles in the immune response (1–3).
The different DC subtypes have historically been defined by a combination of morphology, 
physical properties, localization, molecular markers, functions and developmental origins, 
converging to the current model described above (1–3). However, the definition of DCs is 
still likely to be biased by the limited markers available to identify, isolate and manipulate 
the cells. Such biases, in turn, would alter the assignment of function and ontogeny to each 
DC subtype.
To overcome some of these limitations, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
(4,5) to better assess the diversity of blood DCs and monocytes, leading us to identify new 
subtypes of DCs and monocytes, refine their existing classification, and pinpoint a precursor 
of cDCs in the blood. Using discriminative markers associated with the newly defined DC 
subtypes, we also assessed the functions of some of the DC subtypes. Overall, our analysis 
provides a relatively unbiased and comprehensive map of human blood DCs and monocytes.

 Strategy for discovery and validation of DC and monocyte subtypes
To determine the subtypes of DCs and monocytes in human blood, we developed an 
experimental and computational strategy to (i) perform single-cell RNA-sequencing on DCs 
and monocytes derived from a single healthy individual; (ii) identify clusters of cells that are 
similar to each other; (iii) find discriminative markers per cluster; (iv) prospectively isolate 
cells corresponding to key clusters using newly identified surface markers; (v) validate the 
identity of the sorted cells using scRNA-seq; (vi) confirm the existence of these cell types in 
up to 10 independent healthy individuals; and (vii) perform functional analyses for selected 
cell types.
Single-cell profiling of blood DCs and monocytes
We analyzed blood DC and monocyte populations from Ficoll-enriched cells that were 
isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 1A) excluding cells expressing 
markers of B, T and NK cells (6). For DCs, we sampled LIN−HLA-DR+CD14− cells across 
the CD11C+ fraction (to enrich for CD141+ and CD1C+ cDCs) and the CD11C− fraction (to 
enrich for CD123+ pDCs) (Fig. 1B). For monocytes, we sampled LIN−CD14lo/++ cells 
(including classical CD14++CD16−, intermediate CD14++CD16+, and non-classical 
CD14+CD16++). We used additional markers (DCs: CD123, CD141, CD1C; monocytes: 
CD14, CD16) to create overlapping gates that comprehensively and evenly sample DCs and 
monocytes (6).
To define subpopulations and identify useful markers for further isolation, we performed 
deep scRNA-seq using a modified version of Smart-Seq2 protocol (6), followed by 
sequencing of ~1–2 million paired-end reads per cell (7,8). Of 768 DCs and 372 monocytes 
initially profiled in the selected individual for discovering subsets, we focused on 742 DCs 
and 339 monocytes that passed quality control (QC) filters (6) with an average of 5326 
unique genes detected per cell. In subsequent validation and characterization phases, we 
additionally profiled ~1200 cells.
Unbiased classification of LIN−HLA-DR+CD14− subsets
We defined six cell clusters within the LIN−HLA-DR+CD14− population using unsupervised 
analysis that did not rely on known markers of DCs. Briefly, we identified 595 genes 
exhibiting high variability across single cells, reduced the dimensionality of these data with 
principal components analysis (PCA), and identified five significant PCs using a previously 
described permutation test (6, 9). We used these PC loadings as input to t-distributed 
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (10) for visualization, and clustered cells using a 
graph-based approach similar to one recently developed for mass cytometry data (6, 11). We 
observed six clusters numbered DC1 to DC6 as follows: two clusters mapping closely to the 
well-established DC subsets, with cluster DC1 mapping to CD141+ DCs and cluster DC6 to 
pDCs (based on the post hoc overlap of transcript and surface marker expression); two 
clusters containing the CD1C+ cDCs, cluster DC2 (CD1C_A) and cluster DC3 (CD1C_B); a 
cluster corresponding to the poorly characterized CD141−CD1C− population, cluster DC4;

 and one cluster that does not correspond to any of the known blood DC subtypes, cluster 
DC5 (Fig. 1C; fig. S1).
We identified 242 genes [area under curve (AUC) ≥ 0.85] that best classified cells into these 
six putative cell populations (Fig. 1D and fig. S2A; see tables S1 and S2 for a list of 
markers, including surface markers). Although cluster DC1 mapped most closely to CD141+ 
DCs, this commonly used CD141 (THBD/BDCA-3+) marker was a poor discriminator for 
this cluster, being also expressed by cells captured in clusters DC5 and DC6 (pDCs) (fig. 
S2B). Because CLEC9A appeared to be a perfect discriminative surface marker for the DC1 
cluster, we refer to this subset henceforth as CLEC9A+ DCs. Clusters DC2 and DC3 mapped 
to CD1C+ DCs. CD1C was the best and sole marker uniquely shared by both clusters. The 
DC4 cluster mapped to the CD141−CD1C− population and was accurately delineated by 
FCGR3A/CD16. The DC5 cluster was best defined by the surface markers AXL and 
SIGLEC6. Finally, the DC6 cluster mapped to pDCs. However, several markers commonly 
used to identify pDCs (e.g. IL3RA/CD123, CLEC4C/CD303) were also expressed in the 
population defined by the DC5 cluster, leading us to define a new combination of markers 
that distinguish pDCs from the DC5 population. Altogether, we identified sets of 
discriminative markers that can be used in combination to isolate cell populations 
corresponding to known DC subsets (but with higher purity) as well as to previously 
uncharacterized subsets.
Two subpopulations within CD1C+ DCs
The CD1C+ DCs were distributed across two clusters with similar numbers of cells, which 
we termed CD1C_A (cluster DC2) and CD1C_B (cluster DC3). Comparing the two clusters, 
the CD1C_B cells were distinguished by their expression of a strong unique signature that 
includes acute and chronic inflammatory genes (12–14) such as CD14, S100A9 and 
S100A8, whereas CD1C_A cells were marked only by slightly higher levels of MHC class II 
genes (Fig. 2A and table S3).
We validated the presence of the two populations by prospective isolation based on newly 
identified markers, followed by scRNA-seq. To isolate these cells by flow sorting, we 
developed a panel incorporating surface markers derived from the set of uniquely expressed 
genes: FCGR2B/CD32B for CD1C_A, and CD163 and CD36 for CD1C_B subsets (Fig. 
2B). scRNA-seq of prospectively isolated cells from each subset recapitulated the original 
split observed in CD1C+ DCs (Fig. 2C). Unlike monocytes and pDCs, both CD1C_A and 
CD1C_B subsets (isolated with the newly identified markers) were potent stimulators of 
naïve T cell proliferation (P < 0.05, paired t test), consistent with the known functional 
characteristics of cDCs (Fig. 2D). Activation of both CD1C subsets with lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS), R848 (a TLR7/TLR8 agonist), and polyinosine-polycytidine [poly(I:C)] highlighted 
functional differences between these subsets (fig. S3 and table S4), with CD1C_A secreting 
higher levels of the immune mediators CCL19, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-12B, and IL-18. 
Thus, scRNA-seq revealed unappreciated heterogeneity in this particular subset, leading to 
new hypotheses about the functions of CD1C+ DCs.

 Discovering monocyte subsets and their relationships to DC subsets
Some key genes known to be associated with monocytes were also expressed by CD1C_B 
(cluster DC3) and CD141−CD1C− (cluster DC4) cells (e.g., CD14 and FCGR3A/CD16, 
respectively). To analyze the relationships between monocytes and DCs cells, we profiled 
372 single blood monocytes (Fig. 1A and Fig. 3A). On the basis of 339 monocytes that 
passed QC, we identified four clusters (Fig. 3B and fig. S4A) distinguished by 102 classifier 
genes (AUC ≥0.85; Fig. 3C, fig. S4B, and table S5) upon analyzing them with the DC single 
cell data. The two largest clusters, Mono1 and Mono2, contained the CD14++CD16− 
(“classical”) and CD14+CD16++ (“non-classical”) monocytes, respectively. However, 
Mono1 and Mono2 also included 88 of the 124 cells derived from the “intermediate” 
monocyte gate (CD14++CD16+) (fig. S4A), demonstrating that the intermediate monocytes 
do not form a homogeneous population. The two smaller clusters, Mono3 and Mono4, 
contained 40 of the 124 intermediate cells and expressed many of the Mono1 (classical 
monocyte) signature genes. Mono3 expresses a unique combination of genes that have the 
potential to affect cell cycle, differentiation, and trafficking (e.g. MXD1, CXCR1, CXCR2, 
VNN2), whereas Mono4 distinctively expressed a cytotoxic gene signature (e.g. PRF1, 
GNLY, CTSW) resembling previously reported “natural killer dendritic cells,” in addition to 
co-expressing Mono1 gene set (15–17) (Fig. 3C and fig. S4B). We conclude that the 
previously defined classical and non-classical subtypes are contained in two distinct clusters 
(Mono1 and Mono2, respectively), but that the intermediate monocytes are far more 
heterogeneous than previously appreciated, being distributed across two known and two new 
clusters (fig. S4A).
All monocyte subtypes shared a signature that distinguishes them collectively from CD1C+ 
DC (cluster DC2 and DC3), CLEC9A+ DC (cluster DC1), and pDC (cluster DC6) 
populations (e.g., ITGAM/CD11B, ITGB2/CD18, TLR2, and CLEC7A) (Fig. 3, B and C, 
and fig. S4B). Thus, despite co-expressing genes such as CD14 and S100A8, Mono1 and 
CD1C_B/DC3 cells were part of distinct clusters (Fig. 3B and C). CD1C+ DCs (DC2 and 
DC3) expressed unique markers (e.g. CD1C, CLEC10A, FCER1A, FCGR2B, and CD1D) 
enriched for antigen processing (P < 2.66 × 10−10), MHC II (P < 1.79 × 10−8), and leukocyte 
activation (P < 1.14 × 10−6) gene ontology (GO) terms (Fig. 3C and table S6) (6). In 
contrast, Mono1 cells were enriched for defense response (P < 2.15 × 10−14), inflammatory 
response (P < 9.59 × 10−14), and chemotaxis (P < 6.77 × 10−10) genes.
Finally, we interrogated the relationship between CD16-expressing CD141−CD1C− cells 
(cluster DC4) and CD16+ monocytes (cluster Mono2). Although the two populations shared 
many genes (e.g., FCGR3A), they formed distinct clusters (Fig. 3B) defined by a unique 
discriminative gene set (Fig. 3C and tables S7 and S8). DC4 cells were enriched for type I 
interferon signaling pathway (P < 1.53 × 10−13) and response to virus (P < 4.77 × 10−9) GO 
terms, whereas Mono2 cells were enriched for immune system process (P < 1.09 × 10−14) 
and leukocyte migration (P < 3.57 × 10−8) GO terms. Although we conclude that monocytes 
and DCs are distinct from each other in the steady state, our data do not address potential 
interconversion between cell fates or distinct ontogeny.

 AXL+SIGLEC6+ population and its relation to cDCs and pDCs
As described above, a population emerged from the unbiased cluster analysis (cluster DC5; 
Fig. 1), defined by co-expression of unique markers (e.g., AXL, SIGLEC1, SIGLEC6, and 
CD22/SIGLEC2) (Fig. 4A, fig. S5A and tables S1–S2). Flow cytometry analysis of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 independent donors confirmed the 
existence of AXL+SIGLEC6+ cells (“AS DCs”) within the original DC gate (Fig. 4B) at a 
frequency of 2 to 3%, consistent with what was originally observed in the initial scRNA-seq 
analysis (30 of 768 DCs; Fig. 1C). scRNA-seq profiling of prospectively sorted AS DCs 
(isolated with the gating strategy in Fig. 4B) showed that the newly sorted cells clustered 
together with the original cluster (Fig.4C and fig. S5B), validating our enrichment strategy.
AS DCs exhibited a spectrum of states based on gene expression (Fig. 4D) defined by cells 
enriched for a pDC-like signature (e.g., IL3RA, IGJ, NRP1, MZB1) and cells enriched for a 
cDC-like signature (IFI30, ITGAX, LY86, GLIPR2, FGR, LYZ, ENTPD1). We validated 
this observation by flow cytometry, using the surface markers IL3RA/CD123 and ITGAX/
CD11C that respectively correlated with pDC and cDC gene signatures (Fig. 4, B and D). 
We exploited the combinatorial expression of AXL, SIGLEC6, CD123 and CD11C (at both 
mRNA and protein levels) to prospectively isolate the ends of this spectrum representing two 
putative AS DC subtypes (see gating strategy in Fig. 4B), and further validated their 
identities by scRNA-seq (Fig. 4E and fig. S5, C to F). Across all 10 individuals tested, the 
two AS DC subpopulations represented a very small fraction of the Lin−HLA-DR+ 
populations (Fig. 4F). Notably, lower levels of AXL and SIGLEC6 protein were associated 
with increased HLA-DR, CD11C and CD1C, whereas higher levels of AXL and SIGLEC6 
were associated with increased CD123, CD303, and CD141 and decreased HLA-DR (fig. 
S5, C to J). This latter relationship was also observed by t-SNE analysis of flow cytometry 
data, where a peninsula with graded expression of AS DCs was located at the base of the 
CD1C+ DC cluster and adjacent to the pDC cluster (Fig. 4G). Trajectory mapping of these 
cells across different levels of the surface markers CD123 and CD11C further indicated that 
AS DCs form a continuum from a pDC transcriptional state to a CD1C+ DC transcriptional 
state (fig. S5, C to F). Taken together, our data suggest that AXL+SIGLEC6+ DCs are 
related but not identical to cDCs or pDCs.
pDCs are phenotypically and functionally distinct from CD123+CD11C− AS 
DCs
Because pDCs and AXL+SIGLEC6+CD123+CD11C−/lo DCs shared expression of many 
genes (Fig. 4, D and E, and fig. S6A), we assessed whether these cell types also shared 
functional properties. We found that the genes specifically expressed by pDCs, but not by 
AS DCs, were associated with the known biological properties of pDCs. This includes, for 
example, genes associated with pathogen sensing and induction of type I interferons (IRF7, 
TLR7, SLC15A4, and PACSIN1), secretion (e.g. DERL3, LAMP5, and SCAMP5), and the 
pDC master regulator transcription factor TCF4, along with its binding targets (e.g. SLA2, 
PTCRA, PTPRCAP) (Fig. 5A and fig. S6A) (18–19). In contrast, CD123+CD11C−/lo AS 
DCs expressed cDC markers, including CD2, CX3CR1, CD33/SIGLEC3, CD5, and

 SIGLEC1/CD169, both at protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 5A and fig. S6, A to C). pDCs 
were also morphologically distinct from AS DCs. Both AS DC subsets possessed the same 
cerebriform nucleus and cytoplasmic features of cDCs (Fig. 5B). We hypothesized that 
although CD123+CD11C−/lo AS DCs expressed pDC markers, including IL3RA/CD123 and 
CLEC4C/CD303 (fig. S5, G to J), they are functionally distinct from pDCs.
To compare the functional properties of “pure” pDCs to AS DCs and cDCs, we used the 
markers identified in our study to isolate pure pDCs by excluding AS DCs, CLEC9A+ DCs, 
CD1C+ DCs and monocytes by FACS. As expected, pure pDCs produced their hallmark 
cytokine, interferon-α (IFN-α), while AS DCs produced negligible amounts of IFN-α upon 
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulation (P < 0.001; Fig. 5C). In contrast, the 
CD123loCD11C+ AS DC subset secreted IL-12p70 at similar levels to other cDCs, while 
pure pDCs and CD123hiCD11C−/lo AS DCs did not produce IL-12p70 (P < 0.01; Fig. 5C). 
Other factors, such as IL-8, were produced at high levels by the CD123+CD11C−/lo AS DC 
subset but not by pDC (P < 0.001; fig. S6D). Finally, pure pDCs induced undetectable or 
low levels of T cell proliferation in response to LPS or LPS+R848 stimulation, respectively 
(P < 0.05; Fig. 5D). We conclude that “pure” IFN-α-producing pDCs (depleted of AS DCs) 
do not upregulate CD86 (fig. S6, C and E), are diminished in their ability to induce T cell 
proliferation, and that contamination of AS DCs within the traditionally defined pDC gate is 
likely responsible for T cell stimulation activities measured in prior reports (18–20).
AS DCs stimulate T cell proliferation and are present in tonsils
Because AS DCs expressed the costimulatory CD86 and components of antigen 
presentation, we hypothesized that they could stimulate T cell proliferation (fig. S6, A, C, 
and E). Strikingly, both AS DC subtypes were potent stimulators of allogeneic CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cell proliferation, unlike pDCs (P < 0.01), and were marginally superior to CD1C+ 
and CLEC9A+ DCs (Fig. 5E).
Similar to other DCs, AS DCs expressed CLA and CD62L but not CCR7 protein (fig. S6F), 
suggesting potential homing to peripheral tissue such as skin and lymph node from the 
circulation. Because CD123+ pDCs were observed in the T cell area of the human tonsil 
(21), we evaluated whether CD123+ AS DCs were also present by staining human tonsils 
with antibodies to CD123 and AXL. We found AS DCs adjacent to CD3+ T cells, admixed 
with CD123+AXL− pDCs (Fig. 5F). Flow cytometry confirmed this finding, showing that 
the CD123+CD11C−/lo AS DCs represented 0.7% and CD123−CD11C+ AS DCs represented 
1.7% of the CD45+LIN−HLA-DR+ fraction (Fig. 5F). Thus, AS DCs are able to stimulate T 
cells and are present in the T cell zones of tonsils.
Identification of circulating CD100hiCD34int cDC progenitors
Finally, we interrogated CD11C−CD123− cells within the HLA-DR+CD14− gate used for 
isolating DCs that were not considered in the initial analysis because they were not 
previously thought to include DCs (red dashed gate in Fig. 1B and updated gate in Fig. 6A 
used for these experiments). Analysis of CD11C−CD123− scRNA-seq data revealed six 
clusters in this gate (fig. S7, A and B). Cells in cluster 6 expressed genes associated with

 hematopoiesis, DC progenitors, and genes essential for DC development (e.g. SATB1, 
RUNX2, KIT, HLX, ID2) (22–25) and were marked by high expression of the cell surface 
protein SEMA4D (CD100). We therefore hypothesized that cluster 6 could represent a 
progenitor population.
To assess the progenitor potential of this compartment, we cultured FACS-purified CD11C
−CD123− cells with MS5 stromal cells and cytokines that induce DC differentiation (6), 
based on a published human DC progenitor differentiation assay (26). After several days in 
culture, the cells were evaluated by flow cytometry, using a panel of antibodies that identify 
pDCs and CD1C+ and CLEC9A+ DCs (6), and by scRNA-Seq profiling of CD45+ immune 
cells for a more comprehensive assessment. For comparison, under the same conditions, we 
monitored the differentiation potential of isolated pDCs, CD1C+ and CLEC9A+ DCs, and 
AS DC subtypes (see fig. S7, C and D).
After 7 days of culture, cells isolated from the CD11C−CD123− gate gave rise to CLEC9A+ 
and CD1C+ DCs but not pDCs, according to flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses (Fig. 
6B). We narrowed down the search for the progenitor cells to the CD45RA+CD39−CD100+ 
pool of cells based on the unique cluster-6 marker CD100/SEMA4D (fig. S7B), along with 
candidate markers that we tested [based on DC progenitors in the bone marrow (CD45RA) 
and tissue DC (CD39) markers] (Fig. 6C, fig. S5J, fig. S6, B and F, and fig. S7, B to H). 
After iteratively testing each sorted population for differentiation potential, we discovered 
that only the CD100hiCD34int cells generated CLEC9A+ and CD1C+ DCs (Fig. 6C and fig. 
S7F). scRNA-seq of CD100hiCD34int cells mapped these cells to the original cluster 6, 
including the expression of the same DC differentiation and progenitor function genes (fig. 
S7B).
We validated the existence of CD100hiCD34int progenitors in 10 individuals, with a 
frequency of ~0.02% of the LIN−HLA-DR+ fraction of PBMCs (Fig. 6D). These cells were 
morphologically primitive, possessing high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and circular or 
indented nuclei (Fig. 6D), in contrast to AS DCs, pDCs, and CD1C+ and CLEC9A+ DCs 
(Fig. 5B). Although CD100hiCD34int cells expressed HLA-DR and low levels of the 
costimulatory molecule CD86 (fig. S6E) and lymph node homing gene CCR7 (Fig. S7, B 
and H), they had low T cell stimulatory potential (Fig. 5, C and E), which suggests that these 
cells are not functional cDCs. Furthermore, CD100hiCD34int cells retained significant 
proliferative capacity (P < 0.05; Fig. 6E), in accordance with their primitive morphology, 
phenotype and expression profile. Although CD100hiCD34int cells were KIT/
CD117+CD45RA+ and CSF1R/CD115−, CD1C−, CD141−, CD123− – a profile similar to 
that of a previously reported circulating human DC progenitor (24, 27, 28) – they differ from 
the published progenitor in having a more primitive morphology and lacking CSF2R/CD116 
and FLT3/CD135 expression (fig. S7, G and H).
Differentiation potential of AS DCs
When we seeded cultures with pDCs and CD1C+ and CLEC9A+ DCs, we found that they 
generally retained the same phenotype throughout the differentiation assay (Fig. 6F and fig. 
S7, I and J). Upon observing a gene expression spectrum of AS DC states that includes

 pDC-like and CD1C+-like DC signatures (fig. S5, C to F), we also seeded AS DCs to assess 
their potential to transition towards other DC subsets [ensuring no contamination with CD1C
+ and CLEC9A+ DCs (fig. S7I and J)]. After 7 days in culture, we observed cells with high 
levels of CD1C (n=6 donors) and rare cells with surface CLEC9A and CADM1expression 
(Fig. 6F), irrespective of the FLT3L concentration used (Fig. 6F) or whether the culture was 
seeded with either of the two AS DC subpopulations representing both ends of the spectrum 
(fig. S7K). Notably, both AS DCs at day 0 and the cells differentiated from AS DC did not 
express BATF3 (a transcription factor required for terminal differentiation of CLEC9A+ 
DCs), CADM1 or XCR1, which are key CLEC9A+ DC discriminative markers (table S2) 
(23, 29–33) (fig. S5, D and E).
We found that AS DCs did not divide during the transition into CD1C+ DCs, in contrast to 
CD100hiCD34int cells that divided and differentiated into CD1C+ as well as CLEC9A+ DCs. 
Furthermore, CD100hiCD34int differentiation into CD1C+ DCs is not likely to transition 
through AS DCs, because CD100hiCD34int did not express AXL or SIGLEC6 genes at day 0 
or during differentiation. AS DCs are thus functional cDCs that exist in a continuum of 
states in vivo (fig. S5, C to F), with the potential to transition toward CD1C+ DCs.
Mapping malignant cells from patients to the healthy DC atlas
We leveraged our human DC atlas to compare pathogenic cells driving blastic plasmacytoid 
dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), a rare and aggressive hematological malignancy 
previously known as NK cell leukemia/lymphoma (34, 35), to healthy DC populations. 
Because the ontogeny of these cells remains unclear (34–38), we performed scRNA-seq on 
CD45+HLA-DR+CD123+ blasts from four BPDCN patients (n = 174 cells) (6). The first 
principal component highlighted gene sets clustering all four patients together with healthy 
blood pDCs (Fig. 6G). Analysis of BPDCN samples together with healthy DCs showed 
highest overlap with pDC and AS DC gene expression signatures (fig. S8A). Because pure 
pDC and AS DC subsets co-express many genes yet have distinct biological functions (Figs. 
4 and 5), we further analyzed the genes overlapping among BPDCN, pure pDCs, and cDCs 
(fig. S8B). Despite sharing some pDC genes (e.g., NRP1, IL3RA, DERL3, LAMP5, PTCRA 
and PTPRCAP), several key genes essential for pDC function were missing or were 
expressed only slightly in patient cells (e.g. GZMB, IRF7, CLEC4C/CD303, IRF4, and 
SLC15A4; fig. S8B). Only a small number of cDC genes were expressed in patient cells, 
including SIGLEC6, LTK, FCER1A, CD59, CADM1, and TMEM14A. Note that all four 
patient samples shared a set of discriminative genes (fig. S8B and table S9) that included 
several genes expressed in B cells (e.g. FCRLA, IGLL1, TCL1A, and IGLL5; fig. S8C) or 
with hematopoietic progenitors (e.g. SOX4 and CLEC11A). Collectively, our analysis 
suggests that although BPDCN malignant cells express some key B cell markers, they are 
most closely related to pDCs.
Discussion
DCs and monocytes are defined according to a combination of molecular markers, 
functional properties and ontogeny (39). However, it remains unclear whether the expression 
of existing markers tracks with the more complex internal states of cells. To address this

 question, we determined the states of blood DC/monocytes through comprehensive profiling 
of gene expression at single cell resolution, empirically inferred cell subtypes, identified 
optimal surface markers for purifying the hypothesized cell subtypes, and showed that 
prospectively purified cell types corresponded to inferred subtypes based on scRNA-seq. 
Our study has generated a more accurate taxonomy that includes six DC subtypes and four 
monocyte subtypes, as well as a circulating, dividing progenitor of cDCs.
Previous studies classified human blood DCs into one pDC and two cDC populations. Our 
study identifies six DC populations: DC1 corresponds to the cross-presenting CD141/
BDCA-3+ cDC1, which is best marked by CLEC9A; DC2 and DC3 correspond to new 
subdivisions of the CD1C/BDCA-1+ cDC2; DC4 corresponds to CD1C−CD141−CD11C+ 
DC, which is best marked by CD16 and shares signatures with monocytes; DC5 is a unique 
DC subtype, AS DCs; and DC6 corresponds to the interferon-producing pDC, purer than 
previously identified pDC population defined by standard markers (e.g., CD123, CD303/
BDCA-2+) and contaminated with AS DCs. In the process of addressing how DCs resemble 
monocytes, we also identified four monocyte subtypes: the two known ones, as well as two 
new ones that have not been functionally characterized. Although DC2/3 and DC4 shared an 
expression signature with monocytes, our data do not suggest how they acquired these 
shared modules (e.g., common precursor, interconversion or independent convergence). 
Finally, we derived specific expression signatures for each DC and monocyte subtype, 
including transcription factors, cytokines, and cytokine receptors (fig. S9, A to F; table S10), 
providing a resource for further understanding of subtype functions and ontogeny.
The CD1C/BDCA-1+ DC subdivision (DC2 and DC3) is further supported by parallel 
observations in their murine CD11b+ DC homologs (40–43), which comprise an Esamlo 
subset with higher expression of myeloid genes such as CD14 and potent cytokine 
production, and an Esamhi subset with better MHC class II-dependent priming of CD4+ T 
cells (40–41).
AS DCs, which were found within the pDC gate, formed a continuum between pDC and 
CD1C+ DCs (fig. S5, C to F). Consistent with this observation, AS DCs were able to 
transition towards the CD1C+ DC state in vitro (with <1% of differentiated AS DCs 
phenotypically resembling CLEC9A+ DCs, which could be contaminants). However, 
because AS DCs (at both ends of the continuum) morphologically resemble cDCs and are 
able to stimulate T cell proliferation, yet do not proliferate themselves, they seem less likely 
to serve as a progenitor that generates cDCs and are more likely to be a functional DC 
variant that can be modulated to resemble CD1C+ DCs. Although AS DCs most closely 
resemble CD1C+ cDCs in basic functional properties and expression signatures, they are 
likely to have distinct functions because they localize to the T cell zone of tonsils and 
express several lectins, which recognize diverse glycans, and AXL, which interacts with 
apoptotic cells and Zika virus (44–46).
An unresolved question concerns the importance of AS DCs sharing an expression signature 
with pDCs. Consistent with our findings that AS DCs are found in the traditional pDC flow 
cytometry gate, a recently described human CD2hi pDC subset (20) appears to correspond to 
AS DCs based on expression of CD2, AXL, CX3CR1, LYZ and CD86 (fig. S6C),

 localization to tonsils, and a similar ability to trigger naïve T cell proliferation. Furthermore, 
a murine study identified non-canonical CX3CR1+CD8α+ cDCs (nc-cDCs), which express 
pDC and cDC signatures (e.g., CX3CR1, CD11c and MHCII), do not produce IFN-α, and 
activate T cell proliferation (47–48). Interestingly, pDC and nc-cDCs require E2-2/TCF4 to 
develop, and reduced levels of E2-2 lead to higher ID2 and expression of cDC genes (18, 47, 
48). Consistent with this finding, we observed E2-2/TCF4 expression in human pDCs (Fig. 
5A), with decreasing levels of E2-2/TCF4 and increasing levels of ID2 as AS DCs transition 
to CD1C+ DCs (fig. S5, C to F). These findings suggest that AS DCs are similar to human 
CD2hi pDCs and murine nccDCs.
The discovery of AS DCs led us to update the strategy for isolating pDCs. When we 
removed AS DCs from pDCs isolated with standard markers (e.g. CD123 and CD303), the 
resulting pDCs were highly attenuated in their ability to induce T cell proliferation and 
produce T cell stimulatory ligands (e.g. IL-12), consistent with reports that found several 
markers splitting pDCs into those that stimulate or do not stimulate T cells (18, 20, 49–52). 
We thus propose that our purer pDC population corresponds more closely to the “natural 
interferon-producing cells (IPCs)” (21, 53). These cells also appear to share more properties 
with plasma B cells than DCs, as indicated by morphology, higher expression of 
endoplasmic reticulum secretory machinery, known rearrangement at the Ig 
(immunoglobulin) locus, and expression of B-cell related transcripts. We also found that 
BPDCN cells share the pDC signature as well as additional B cell genes (e.g. IGLL1, IGLL5 
and TCL1A). We conclude that even though pure pDCs fall into the MHC II-expressing 
gate, they have markers, gene signatures, and functions distinct from those of cDCs.
In contrast to AS DCs, the CD100hiCD34int cells appear to be cDC progenitors, judging by 
their primitive morphology, absence of cDC functions and signatures, and potent ability to 
proliferate and generate a large and equal number of CD1C+ DCs and CLEC9A+ DCs 
within 7 days of culture. The recently identified human pre-cDC (24–28), which has 
proliferative capacity and differentiates into CD1C+ and CD141+ DCs, appears to have some 
functional and phenotypical similarities to our CD100hiCD34int progenitors, even though 
our cells appear to be morphologically more primitive and lack the expression of CD116 and 
CD135, which were previously reported as markers (24). Single cell profiling studies are 
needed to determine whether and how these precursors are related.
CD100hiCD34int cells also appear to be different from peripheral blood CD34hi HSCs. 
Culturing of CD100hiCD34int cells gives rise only to CLEC9A+ DCs and CD1C+ DCs (and 
no other cell types) in 7 days. In contrast, peripheral blood CD34hi HSCs under the same 
culture conditions for up to 14 days did not give rise to CLEC9A+ cDCs. Furthermore, 
CD100hiCD34int cells have a transcriptional signature distinct from that of blood CD34hi 
HSCs. Mapping CD100hiCD34int to other bone marrow progenitors may help to resolve the 
origin of these cells.
Our results have several implications. The discovery of several DC subsets will enable a 
more complete understanding of DCs in tissues, inflammation, and disease. Furthermore, the 
identification of circulating CD100hiCD34int progenitors provides a well-defined cell type 
for generating DCs in vitro and for therapeutic targeting. Our new strategy for isolating pure

 pDCs, combined with the knowledge that the functions of contaminating AS DCs were 
incorrectly attributed to pDCs, should lead to more definitive annotation of pDC functions 
with implications for their therapeutic application (54–56). More generally, our use of the 
DC atlas to understand BPDCN cells illustrates how single cell analysis can pinpoint 
relationships of diseased cells to healthy cells. Finally, some susceptibility genes identified 
in human genetics association studies are expressed in the DCs and monocytes subsets 
defined in this study, suggesting new potential roles in disease (fig. S10, A and B and table 
S11, A to C).
Using single-cell transcriptome profiling, we deconvoluted admixtures of cell types (e.g., 
pDCs, “intermediate” monocytes, cDC progenitors), revealed rare cell types (e.g., AS DCs) 
and elucidated complex relationships between cell types (e.g., spectrum of states for AS 
DCs) – thus addressing limitations in the existing classification that relies on a small number 
of markers (39). Nonetheless, some DC/monocyte subtypes were likely missed because they 
do not express MHC class II at rest, can only be defined by non-RNA molecules, are 
distinguished by low-abundance transcripts, or are only present during inflammation, disease 
or within tissues. To build a comprehensive immune cell atlas, future studies will need to 
address these challenges as well as localize these cell types within lymphoid and non-
lymphoid tissues.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
The study was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the institutional review 
board at Partners (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute; Boston, USA) and Broad Institute (USA), as well as the Newcastle 
upon Tyne Hospitals (UK) Research Ethics Committee. All patients provided written 
informed consent for the genetic research studies and molecular testing. Healthy donors 
were recruited from the Boston-based PhenoGenetic project, a resource of healthy subjects 
that are re-contactable by genotype (57), and the Newcastle community. Individuals were 
excluded if they had a history of cancer, allergies, inflammatory disease, autoimmune 
disease, chronic metabolic disorders or infectious disorders. All healthy donors were 
nonsmokers, had a normal BMI and normal blood pressure, and were between 25 and 40 
years of age.
Cell isolation, flow cytometry staining, cell sorting, and analysis
For profiling of healthy cells, PBMCs were isolated from fresh blood within 2 hours of 
collection, using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation as previously described (58). 
Single-cell suspensions were stained per manufacturer recommendations with different 
panels of antibodies (table S12) designed to enrich for certain population for single-cell 
sorting and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) (6). Flow cytometry and FACS-
sorting of PBMC was performed on a BD Fortessa or BD FACS Fusion instrument, and data 
analyzed using FlowJo v10.1. Single-cells were sorted into 96-well full-skirted Eppendorf 
plates chilled to 4°C, pre-prepared with lysis buffer consisting of 10μl of TCL buffer 
(Qiagen) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Single-cell lysates were sealed,

 vortexed, spun down at 300 g at 4°C for 1 min, immediately placed on dry ice and 
transferred for storage at −80°C. Tonsil was mechanically disrupted to obtain single-cell 
suspension.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing
Smart-Seq2 protocol was performed on single sorted cells as described (7, 8), with some 
modifications (6). For DCs, a total of 8 × 96-well plates (768 single DCs) were initially 
profiled from the same blood draw and sort from the index volunteer and subsequent 
validation performed on an additional 10 healthy individuals. For monocytes, a total of four 
plates were profiled (372 single monocytes and 12 population samples). An additional 975 
single cells were profiled to further characterize the CD1C+ DC subsets (n=125), AXL
+SIGLEC6+ cells (n=372), CD11C−CD123− compartment at day 0 (n=164), differentiation 
assay outputs (n=218), CD100hiCD34int cells (n=96), and BPDCN patient samples (n=269). 
Note that some of these single cells were excluded from the analysis after applying QC 
filters and analytically confirming cell type (6).
Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses
Raw sequencing data were processed as previously described (59) (see tables S13 to S16 for 
cell identities that accompany raw data and gene expression matrices). Briefly, short 
sequencing reads were aligned to the UCSC hg19 transcriptome. These alignments were 
used to estimate transcriptomic alignment rates, and were also used as input in RSEM v 
1.2.1 to quantify gene expression levels (transcripts per million; TPM) for all UCSC hg19 
genes in all samples. We filtered out low-quality cells from our data set based on a threshold 
for the number of genes detected (a minimum of 3000 unique genes per cell for cells 
sequenced at HiSeq depth, and 2000 unique genes per cell for cells sequenced at MiSeq 
depth). All genes that were not detected in at least 0.5% of all our single cells were 
discarded, leaving 21,581 genes for all further analyses. Data were log-transformed 
[log(TPM+1)] for all downstream analyses, most of which were performed using the R 
software package Seurat (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat; http://satijalab.org/seurat/). See 
(6) for further details, including R script used to generate clusters.
DC differentiation assay on MS5 stromal cells
DC differentiation assay was performed as described (23–25) with minor adaptation. Briefly, 
1×104 purified progenitors, DC, and monocyte subsets were cultured in 96-well flat bottom 
plates layered with 4×104 murine MS5 stromal cells (DSMZ, Germany) in the presence of 
human FLT3 ligand (FL; 100 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotec), recombinant human SCF (20 ng/ml; 
R&D Systems), and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) (10 ng/ml; Peprotech). MS5 stromal cells were seeded 24 hours prior to co-
culture. Growth factors were replenished on day 3 of culture. Cells were in culture for up to 
7 days prior to harvesting by physical dissociation on ice. Cells were then stained on ice 
either for flow cytometry analysis (see output panel in table S12) or single-cell index sorting 
of CD45+ cells for scRNA-seq of culture output analysis.

 Cytokine production measurements
Purified subsets were cultured at 5×103 cells per well in 96-well round-bottom plates in the 
presence of LPS (100ng/ml; Invivogen) and ODN2395 (1μM; Invivogen) or ODN5328 
(ODN2395 control, 1μM; Invivogen), or in the presence of LPS, poly (I:C) (25μg/ml; 
Invivogen) and R848 (2.5μg/ml; Enzo Life Sciences). Culture supernatants were harvested 
after 24 hours and analyzed using a multiplexed cytokine assay (ProcartaPlex, eBioscience), 
or by leveraging the 92 inflammatory-related protein biomarker panel and four controls 
provided by Olink Proteomics (Uppsala, Sweden) (6).
Assessing T cell stimulatory potential
DC, monocyte, and progenitor subsets were purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors 
by FACS sorting (BD FACS Fusion; see table S12 for sorting panels and antibodies). For T 
cell stimulatory potential, purified DCs, monocytes, AXL+SIGLEC6+ subsets, and 
progenitor subset were cultured at cell density 5×104 per well. All purified cell subsets were 
matured with LPS (100ng/ml, Sigma) and R848 (2.5μg/ml, Invivogen), or with just LPS 
(100ng/ml), for 24 hours prior to co-culture with 5×105 CFSE-labeled allogeneic 
unfractionated CD3+ T cells at a 1:10 DC:T cell ratio. T cell proliferation was assessed by 
measuring CFSE dilution on day 5 of culture.
Cytospin and immunostaining
Cytospin of FACS-purified cells was prepared as described (60) using Shandon Cytospin 4 
(Thermo Scientific). Giemsa-Wright staining was performed using Advia S60 (Siemens) and 
imaged using Axioimager.Z2 microscope with Axiovision software v4.8 (Carl Zeiss, 
Germany). Human tonsil paraffin sections were immunostained with the antibodies: anti-
AXL (MM0098-2N33, Abcam), CD123 (BR4MS, Leica Biosystems) and CD3 (LN10, 
Leica Biosystems) using a Ventana Benchmark XT instrument.
Monitoring cell proliferation
PBMCs were labeled with Cell Trace Violet (CTV, Life Technologies) according to 
manufacturer’s protocol. CTV-labeled FACS-purified progenitors and DC subsets were 
cultured on murine MS5 stromal cells as described above and analyzed on day 5 to assess 
proliferation measured by CTV dilution.

cell fractions in dashed gate were tested for differentiation potential (see fig. S7, A to F). 
Bottom: Output from CD100hiCD34int fraction (population 3, beige gate). (D) Frequency of 
CD100hiCD34int subset as of LIN(CD3,CD19,CD20,CD161)−HLA-DR+ PBMCs (n=9 
healthy donors). Morphology of CD100hiCD34int cell by Giemsa-Wright stain. Scale bar, 
10μm. (E) Proliferative capacity of peripheral blood Cell Trace Violet (CTV)-labeled CD34+ 
HSCs (purple), CD100hiCD34int (3, beige), AXL+SIGLEC6+CD123+CD11C−/lo (1, pink), 
and AXL+SIGLEC6+CD123loCD11C+ (2, blue), as measured by CTV dilution after 5 days 
in culture on MS5 stromal cell line supplemented with GM-CSF, SCF and FLT3LG. Left: 
Representative overlay histogram. Right: Composite bar graphs illustrating percentage of 
proliferated cells and number of proliferations undergone from three donors shown 
(*P<0.05, paired t-test). (F) Output from differentiation assays seeded with CLEC9A+ DCs, 
CD1C+ DCs, pDCs, and AXL+SIGLEC6+cells isolated using gating strategy in (A). AXL
+SIGLEC6+x2 = double FLT3L concentration. Also shown in (C) and (F) are representative 
culture outputs on day 7 and composite bar graphs (mean ± SEM; n=6 donors). (G) PCA 
analysis incorporating monocytes (n=339), DCs (n=742), and four BPDCN patient samples 
(n=174) using the R software package Seurat. PC1 versus PC2 demonstrates the close 
transcriptional proximity between all four BPDCN samples and pDCs (dashed black circle); 
black bracket indicates overlapping cells. PC1 and PC2 variance is 3.8%. Each dot 
represents an individual cell; colored legend for each subset is shown at the right.
