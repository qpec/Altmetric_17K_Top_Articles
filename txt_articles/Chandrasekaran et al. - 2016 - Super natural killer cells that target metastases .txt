Abstract
Tumor draining lymph nodes are the first site of metastasis in most types of cancer. The extent of 
metastasis in the lymph nodes is often used in staging cancer progression. We previously showed 
that nanoscale TRAIL liposomes conjugated to human natural killer cells enhance their 
endogenous therapeutic potential in killing cancer cells cultured in engineered lymph node 
microenvironments. In this work, it is shown that liposomes decorated with apoptosis-inducing 
ligand TRAIL and an antibody against a mouse natural killer cell marker are carried to the tumor 
draining inguinal lymph nodes and prevent the lymphatic spread of a subcutaneous tumor in mice. 
It is shown that targeting natural killer cells with TRAIL liposomes enhances their retention time 
within the tumor draining lymph nodes to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. It is concluded that this 
approach can be used to kill cancer cells within the tumor draining lymph nodes to prevent the 
lymphatic spread of cancer.

Introduction
It has been estimated that 29–37% of cancer patients with breast, colorectal and lung cancers 
are diagnosed with metastases in their tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLN) [1]. These 
patients are at a higher risk for distant organ metastases through the vast network of 
lymphatic capillaries. Lymph nodes (LN) are oval-shaped organs filled with immune cells 
where the lymphatic capillaries converge, providing an opportunity for the resident immune 
cells to act against virus infected host cells and cancer cells that may be present in the lymph 
fluid. An important subset of immune cells patrolling the LN is the natural killer (NK) cell 
population, representing about 1–5% of mononuclear cells [2]. Despite evidence of NK cell 
mediated anti-tumor immune response in the LN of experimental animals [3], the LN still 
remains the first site of metastasis in melanomas and carcinomas [4]. Tumor cell survival is 
promoted by primary tumor-induced NK cell abnormalities in the TDLN [5]. It has been

 shown that human NK cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as LN display a different 
phenotype [6], allowing distinction from the bulk of the NK cells present in the blood. This 
presents an opportunity to engineer endogenous NK cells in the TDLN to specifically kill 
cancer cells to prevent the lymphatic spread of cancer. NK cell mediated anti-tumor immune 
response often involves the expression of Tumor necrosis factor-α Related Apoptosis 
Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) on its surface, which initiates apoptosis by interacting with death 
receptors on cancer cells [7]. TRAIL has widely investigated as a potential therapeutic agent 
since its discovery in 1975 [8]. Despite the selectivity of TRAIL in inducing apoptosis in 
cancer cells, there are yet few promising reports on its clinical efficacy [9]. This has 
motivated several groups to design new formulations to address the limited clinical efficacy 
of TRAIL.
The advent of use of host immune cells to fight cancer has led to some innovative 
immunotherapeutic approaches. Several of these efforts have progressed to the clinic in the 
past decade, such as IL-2 therapy [10], ipilimumab [11] (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and 
chimeric antigen-receptor engineered T-cell therapy [12]. This has motivated the design of 
new immunotherapeutic approaches as an alternative to side-effect prone chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy often used in the treatment of advanced stages of cancer [13]. 
Nanotechnology-based immunotherapeutic approaches have received attention as a potential 
route of administering immunomodulatory cytokines/antibodies because of their ability to 
reduce systemic toxicity compared to conventional formulations [14]. The delivery of 
immunotherapeutic agents via nanoscale carriers has the advantages of (i) penetrating 
through the smallest capillaries dimensions, (ii) specifically targeting tumors when 
engineered with targeting moieties and (iii) eliciting a localized stimuli-sensitive response 
because of their capacity to release the immunotherapeutic drug in response to specific cues 
within the tumor such as pH, hypoxia etc. Nanoscale carriers such as liposomes have been 
FDA approved for use in chemotherapy and marketed as DOXIL (liposomal doxorubicin) 
[15] and Abraxane (albumin bound paclitaxel) [16]. Taking a cue from the body’s natural 
defense mechanism, we previously showed that “super” natural killer cells formed through 
attachment of TRAIL-coated liposomes to NK cells via targeting antibody can effectively 
induce apoptosis in human cancer cell lines in engineered in vitro LN microenvironments 
[17]. When cocultured with human cancer cell lines that are known to metastasize to LN in 
experimental animal models, engineered super natural killer cells were able to induce 
apoptosis in cancer cells to a significantly higher degree compared to unmodified NK cells.
The goal of the present study was to determine if TRAIL liposomes targeted to NK cells that 
traffic to the tumor draining inguinal LN of mice bearing a subcutaneous human xenograft 
tumor could effectively prevent the metastasis of a primary tumor to the TDLN. Orthotopic 
models are also used for studying cancer metastasis in experimental animal models [18]. 
While orthotopic models have the advantage of providing a more realistic microenvironment 
for the primary tumor to metastasize, subcutaneous models are often used in studies 
investigating the lymphatic spread of cancer [19]. Here, we describe a therapeutic approach 
to target and kill cancer cells in the subcutaneous tumor draining inguinal LN by 
functionalizing natural killer cells with liposomes conjugated with the apoptosis-inducing 
ligand TRAIL, and an antibody against NK1.1 antigen expressed on murine NK cells (Fig.

sustained retention time in the TDLN, effectively prevents the lymphatic spread of the 
primary tumor.

Mice and In Vivo Tumor Model
Cornell University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all 
the experimental protocols and methods performed in mice. 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 
mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were housed 
at the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility at Cornell University in filter-top cages under 
pathogen-free conditions with free access to water and food. These mice were used for 
toxicology and pharmacokinetics experiments. 6- to 8-week-old male B6.129S7-
Rag1tm1Mom/J mice (B6Rag1) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. B6Rag1 mice have 
a “non-leaky” immunocompromised phenotype. They lack mature T-cells and B-cells 
allowing human cancer cell lines to propagate but have its innate immunity intact (high NK 
cell activity). The high NK cell activity is advantageous for evaluating the therapeutic 
efficacy of engineered liposomes directed towards NK cells in the tumor draining LN. The 
animals were weighed weekly and monitored for signs of distress by the Cornell Center for 
Animal Resources and Education (CARE) facility staff.
For spontaneous metastasis to the inguinal LN, luciferase-expressing SW620 cells (2×106 
cells/100 μL of PBS) were injected subcutaneously into the lower left abdominal flank. 
After cancer cell injection, animals were monitored weekly for primary tumor growth and 
metastasis to the inguinal lymph node using an in vivo luciferase-based reporter assay. 
Luciferin was administered at 150 mg/kg per animal intraperitoneally using a 30G insulin 
syringe needle. Animals were placed under anesthesia using 2% isoflurane and imaged 10 
min post-injection for maximum bioluminescence signal. Images were acquired at 10 s 
exposure time using a Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System. For quantification of total flux 
wherever reported, in-house developed region of interest (ROI) measurement tools were 
used to compare the signal intensity.
Preparation of Liposomes
Multilamellar liposomes (10 mM in 1 mL) composed of EggPC, Chol, DSPE-mPEG2000 
and DSPE-mPEG2000-maleimide at molar ratios 2:1:0.05:0.05 were prepared using a lipid 
extrusion method [20]. The maleimide functional group on DSPE-mPEG2000 allows for 
attachment of thiolated proteins. Briefly, lipids were allowed to form a thin film by mixing 
them in desired proportions and leaving them overnight in a vacuum glass chamber to 
ensure complete removal of chloroform. They were then hydrated in a buffer composed of 
20 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl in PBS at pH 7.5. Hydrated lipids formed multilamellar 
vesicles which were then disrupted by 15 freeze (2 min)/thaw (3 min) cycles before 
extrusion. The lipid suspension was then forced through a polycarbonate filter with 
successively smaller pore size (400 nm, 200 nm and 100 nm) mounted on a holder in a 
heating block (Avanti® mini-extruder). The temperature was maintained at 60 °C, which is

 above the phase transition temperature of the lipids. Anti-NK1.1, TRAIL and anti-mouse 
IgG were thiolated using 1 mM Traut’s reagent following a protocol supplied by the 
manufacturer. Excess Traut’s reagent was removed using a desalting column. The 
modification of TRAIL and Anti-NK1.1 via Traut’s reagent does not alter their biological 
activity (data not shown). Thiolated proteins were conjugated to the liposome surface by 
incubating them with liposomes overnight at 4°C (500 nM of TRAIL and 500nM of anti-
NK1.1). To remove unbound proteins, liposomes were diluted in liposome buffer and 
ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 6 hr at 4°C. Freshly prepared nanoscale liposomes were 
characterized using a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) to ensure successful conjugation 
of proteins. Unconjugated liposomes were measured to be 94.87 ± 2.8 nm in diameter with a 
zeta potential of −4.8 ± 3.2 mV and conjugated liposomes were measured to be 138 ± 6.2 
nm in diameter with a zeta potential of −11.8 ± 6.7 mV. Liposome-bound TRAIL was 
quantified using ELISA following solubilization of liposomes in 0.5% Tween 20 buffer. The 
concentration of TRAIL was determined to be 26.5 ng/mL, which is equivalent to 3.6 ng/mg 
of lipid.
TRAIL Sensitivity Experiment
SW620 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a seeding density of 100,000 cells per mL and 
allowed to proliferate for one day before being treated with TRAIL. Media was changed 
before TRAIL treatment to ensure the removal of floating cells. Cells were then incubated 
with media containing 0–100 ng/mL of TRAIL and cultured for 24 hr. A standard 
colorimetric MTT assay was performed after 24 hr in culture to determine the percentage of 
viable cells. The absorbance was measured at 690 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek 
Instruments). The absorbance was normalized with respect to untreated control and the 
viability reported as percentages.
Mouse Natural Killer Cell Isolation
Mice were euthanized by CO2 administration following an IACUC-approved protocol. The 
left and right inguinal LN were isolated from mice by making a small incision above the 
hind limb region near the abdomen. The isolated LN were digested by placing the LN in 
between frosted slides immersed in cell culture media. The resulting single cell suspension 
from the LN tissue was then used for downstream analysis such as flow cytometry wherever 
appropriate. NK cells from single cell suspensions obtained from the inguinal LN were 
isolated using an EasySep mouse NK cell enrichment kit following a protocol supplied by 
the manufacturer. The purity of the NK cell isolation was verified via flow cytometry by 
labeling the isolated cells with anti-CD335 to identify NK cells and CD3 to identify T-cells.
Natural Killer Cell Activity Assays
NK cells isolated from the inguinal LN of mice that received different treatments were 
cultured in vitro to measure their activity. Growth rate, IFN-γ secretion, and cytotoxicity 
were measured to examine differences in NK cell activity. Isolated NK cells were seeded in 
48-well plates at a seeding density of 103 cells/well. The number of cells was counted on the 
3rd and 7th day of culture using an automated cell counter (BioRad). The media conditioned 
by cultured NK cells was assayed for levels of IFN-γ on the 1st and 7th day of culture using

 ELISA. The cytolytic activity of NK cells was quantified using a 7-AAD/CFSE staining kit. 
It has been shown that murine NK cells can induce cytotoxicity in the cultured mouse 
melanoma cell line B16F0 [21]. To determine NK cell cytotoxicity, B16F0 melanoma cells 
(Target cells) were pre-labeled with a green fluorescent probe CFSE and cultured with 
murine NK cells (Effector) at predetermined target/effector cell ratios (5:1, 10:1 and 15:1). 
The cell mixture was incubated overnight to allow for NK cell cytolytic activity. The cell 
mixture was incubated with 7-AAD (fluorescent marker for dead cells) and analyzed using 
flow cytometry (Guava easyCyte™ flow cytometer, Millipore) to determine the degree of 
cytotoxicity of NK cells.
Pharmacokinetic Experiments
To determine how long TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes can remain bound to the surface of 
NK cells in the inguinal LN, wild-type C57BL/6 mice received subcutaneous injections of 
buffer, TRAIL/IgG or TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes (0.8 mg lipids in 50μL) (three mice 
per group) on both the left and the right abdominal flanks. The left and right inguinal LN 
were harvested 24 hr post-injection and dissociated single cell suspensions from all of the 
LN were pooled together to isolate NK cells. The isolated NK cells were then deposited onto 
microscope slides using a Shandon Cytospin 3 (Harlow Scientific). The fixed and 
permeabilized cells were then stained with antibody against anti-human TRAIL (to label 
TRAIL on the liposomes) followed by a FITC conjugated secondary antibody and DAPI to 
label the nuclei. The cells were then imaged using a Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal 
microscope and 10 confocal images for each time point were used to quantify the percentage 
of NK cells bound with liposomes. For the TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 group, additional time points 
of t=48, 72 and 96 hr were investigated to quantify the percentage of NK cells bound with 
liposomes.
Treatment Groups and Conditions
Based on the size of the primary tumor 2 weeks after subcutaneous tumor implantation, 25 
mice were divided into 5 groups. Animals within each group received injections of buffer, 
soluble TRAIL (26.5 ng/mL), TRAIL/IgG liposomes, Anti-NK1.1 liposomes or TRAIL/
Anti-NK1.1 liposomes. Each group received 50 μL subcutaneous injections (0.8 mg of 
lipids) directly adjacent to the primary tumor. The animals were treated on every third day 
based on observations from the pharmacokinetics of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes. By the 
end of week 6, mice in the control groups showed signs of distress and pain owing to 
ulceration and tissue necrosis of the skin overlying the developing tumor. This dictated the 
humane end point of the study. At the end of 6 weeks, mice in all the treatment groups were 
euthanized and inguinal LN harvested and used for further downstream experiments.
Ex Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging and Histology
For assessing the tumor burden in the inguinal LN, harvested LN were placed in PBS 
containing 300μg/mL of D-luciferin. The organs were immersed for 5 min at 37°C before 
imaging. The LN were then arranged adjacent to each other in a black tape-covered cell 
culture lid and imaged at 1 s exposure time using a Xenogen IVIS 200. An in-house built 
ROI tool was used to quantify the signal intensity from individual LN to compare the extent 
of tumor burden in the inguinal LN between different treatment groups. The LN were then

 transferred to 4% PFA overnight at room temperature. Representative LN from each 
treatment group were imaged using a digital camera and sent to the Histology Laboratory at 
Cornell University for H&E staining and scoring by a veterinary pathologist.
Toxicology Experiments
Previous studies from our lab have shown that TRAIL liposomes do not induce cell death in 
human leukocytes, endothelial cells [22] and NK cells [17]. We used wild-type mice for 
toxicology experiments to evaluate the effect of TRAIL liposomes on T-cells, which are 
known to be sensitive to TRAIL [23]. On the contrary, there are studies that suggest that 
despite expressing receptor for TRAIL, T-cells and NK cells are resistant to TRAIL due to 
the expression of decoy receptors and cFLIP that inhibits the TRAIL pathway [24]. To 
determine the effect of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 on local lymph node tissue, non-tumor bearing 
wild-type C57BL/6 mice received TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1, TRAIL/IgG, or buffer injections 
subcutaneously (three mice per group) once every 3 days. After 6 weeks of treatment, 
inguinal LN were harvested and dissociated into single cell suspensions. The cells were 
analyzed using an Annexin-V FITC and Propidium Iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit. The 
assay is based on the ability to differentiate cells in different stages of apoptosis. Annexin-V 
is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis and PI is impermeable to live cells and apoptotic 
cells, but stains dead cells by binding tightly to the nucleic acid. The labeled cells from 
inguinal LN were analyzed using flow cytometry to quantify the proportion of viable cells. 
To assess liver toxicity owing to TRAIL administration, serum levels of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured at the end of 
the study using a colorimetric detection kit (BioVision). Serum was isolated from whole 
blood of animals in the different treatment groups at the conclusion of the experiment and 
the concentrations of ALT and AST were determined using a protocol provided by the 
manufacturer. Toxicity to liver was also assessed by H&E staining of the collected liver 
tissue.
Flow Cytometry
The expression of death receptors in SW620 cells, expression of NK1.1 antigen on NK cells 
isolated from the inguinal LN of a wild-type C57BL/6 mouse, and the interaction of 
subcutaneously injected liposomes with different types of cells within the LN were analyzed 
on a Guava easyCyte™ flow cytometer using appropriate fluorescent antibodies and their 
corresponding isotype controls.
Statistical Analysis
Where appropriate, pairwise differences in the bioluminescent tumor signals were analyzed 
at selected time points using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All statistical analyses were 
performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 for Mac OS X (GraphPad software). Based on pilot in 
vivo experiments, total sample sizes of 5 mice per group achieved 80% power to detect a 
difference of at least 1.93 standardized units using the Dunnett multiple comparison test (3 
comparisons against control) at the α=0.05 groupwise significance level. Significance 
analysis for NK cell activity assays, liver enzyme activity assays, Annexin-V/propidium 
iodide assay were analyzed using Student’s t-test at the α=0.05 significance level.

 Results
Pharmacokinetics of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes
To assess the relative distribution of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes within the inguinal LN, 
we injected liposomes subcutaneously on the lower left and right abdominal flanks. 
Subcutaneously injected TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes remained bound to NK cells within 
the skin draining inguinal LN 24 hr post-injection with very minimal interaction with other 
cell types in the LN (Fig. 1B). To characterize liposome binding to different cell 
subpopulations within the LN, LN were isolated from mice that received subcutaneous 
injection of buffer, TRAIL/IgG liposomes, naked liposomes or TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 
liposomes 24 hr post injection. The isolated cells were labeled with B220, CD3, CD11c, 
CD335 and CD11b antibodies to label B-cells, T-cells, dendritic cells, NK cells and 
macrophages, respectively. The cells were also labeled with anti-TRAIL antibody to label 
human TRAIL on the surface of liposomes. Minimal adhesion of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 
liposomes was observed for B-cells, T-cells and dendritic cells. However, CD335+ NK cells 
from mice that received TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposome injections showed a significant shift 
in fluorescent peak intensity thus confirming the specific interaction of liposomes with NK 
cells in the inguinal LN (Fig. 1B). Additionally, NK cells were isolated (Fig. S1A) and 
verified for the expression of NK1.1 antigen on its surface (Fig. S1B) using the anti-NK1.1 
antibody isolated from a hybridoma cell line. Confocal micrographs of isolated NK cells 
show a gradual reduction in the number of liposome bound NK cells after subcutaneous 
drug delivery (Fig. 1C). About ~28% of NK cells were bound with liposomes at t=72 hr and 
~2% of NK cells were bound with liposomes at t=96 hr (Fig. 1D).
Characterization of in vivo tumor model
When SW620 cells expressing luciferase were injected subcutaneously into the lower 
abdominal flank, tumor development was observed at the site of injection 1 week after 
injection. Luciferase allows monitoring of the growth of the primary tumor and the 
establishment of inguinal LN metastasis using noninvasive whole body bioluminescence 
imaging (BLI) [25]. The growth of the primary tumor and the establishment of lymph node 
metastasis in the skin draining inguinal LN were monitored weekly using a Xenogen IVIS 
imager (Fig. 2A). By week 6 mice started to develop ulceration in the skin overlying the 
subcutaneous primary tumor and were characterized with impaired movement dictating a 
humane endpoint for the study. Quantification of the total amount of photons (total flux) 
emitted by luciferase expressing primary tumor indicated an uninterrupted growth of the 
primary tumor up to 6 weeks post-implantation (Fig. 2B). The pigment associated signal loss 
in C57BL/6 mice [26] allows for visualization of the primary tumor and inguinal lymph 
node metastasis when the animals were imaged on their ventral and dorsal side, respectively. 
Sequential imaging of inguinal LN after subcutaneous injection of luciferase-tagged SW620 
cells demonstrated initial metastasis formation 2–3 weeks post tumor inoculation that 
developed into macroscopic metastasis during 3–6 weeks post tumor inoculation (Fig. 2B). 
The SW620 cell line was established from the primary tumor draining mesenteric LN of a 
human colon cancer patient. It has been reported to be a TRAIL-resistant cell line when 
compared to its isoclonal SW480 cell line established from the primary colon tumor [27]. 
Despite this, we found SW620 to be sufficiently sensitive to TRAIL over a range that

 includes the TRAIL concentration on liposomes used in this study (Fig. S2). SW620 cells 
expressed death receptors that initiate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (Fig. S2A) and were 
sensitive to TRAIL in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S2B). SW620 cells treated 
with 100ng/mL of TRAIL showed characteristic morphological features of cells undergoing 
apoptosis (rounded and detached) when compared to untreated controls with live cells 
(spindle shaped and attached) (Fig. S2C).
Tumor burden in inguinal lymph nodes
To test the ability of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes to prevent the metastasis of primary 
tumors to the LN, 25 mice were divided into 5 groups based on the size of the primary tumor 
2 weeks after tumor implantation to achieve matched tumor size in each group. At the 
beginning of week 3, each group received buffer, soluble TRAIL, TRAIL/IgG liposomes (to 
account for non-specific interaction), Anti-NK1.1 liposomes (carrier without TRAIL) or 
TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes subcutaneously for 4 weeks on every 3rd day. Two mice 
under distress were sacrificed at the end of week 5, one each from the buffer and soluble 
TRAIL treatment groups, as recommended by Cornell veterinary staff. The animals were 
monitored weekly using BLI for the growth of the primary tumor (Fig. S3) and the tumor 
burden in the tumor draining inguinal LN (Fig. 3). Whole animal BLI indicated increased 
tumor burden in the skin draining inguinal LN in control groups (buffer, soluble TRAIL, 
TRAIL/IgG liposomes and Anti-NK1.1 liposomes) (Fig. 3A). The TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 
treatment group showed a dramatic reduction in the ability of the primary tumor to 
metastasize to the inguinal LN (Fig. 3A). Time series analysis of total flux from the 
luciferase reporter showed a dramatic reduction in tumor burden in the inguinal LN for 
TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 treated mice throughout the study, whereas the total flux in control 
groups demonstrated a steady increase with time (Fig. 3B). There was no significant 
difference in tumor burden by the end of week 2 before treatment (Fig. 3C). However, at the 
end of week 6, comparison of the total flux from animals in different treatment groups 
showed a significant decline in tumor burden for the TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 treatment group 
(Fig. 3D).
Ex vivo analysis of harvested lymph nodes
At the conclusion of the study, inguinal LN were removed and ex vivo BLI imaging was 
performed on harvested LN to assess the extent of tumor burden in animals from different 
treatment groups. Interestingly, strong BLI signal was detected in inguinal LN harvested 
from control groups but no BLI signal was detected in the TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 treatment 
group (Fig. 4A). The size and appearance of the LN isolated from TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 
treated mice closely resembled the LN isolated from mice in the aged-matched control group 
with no tumor. Numerical quantification of total flux from ex vivo BLI imaging shows a 
significant reduction in signal intensity for LN harvested from the treatment group (Fig. 4B). 
Metastasis to the inguinal LN was characterized by significantly enlarged LN tissue (Fig. 
4C). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed on harvested LN sections and 
interpreted by an independent animal pathologist. The pathology results were consistent 
with the observations from ex vivo BLI analysis (Fig. 4C). The examined H&E sections 
from the control groups were reported to contain LN either partially or fully encapsulated by 
neoplastic cells. In addition to the presence of cancer cells in the periphery of the tissue, the

 interior of the tissue was found to be infiltrated with glands, clusters and sheets of neoplastic 
cells surrounded by fibrous tissue and few lymphoid cells (Fig. 4C). Inguinal LN were 
completely replaced by tumor with scarcely present lymphoid follicles throughout the tissue 
section. In comparison, LN from TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 treatment group were not enlarged or 
infiltrated by cells from the primary tumor (Fig. 4C).
Effect of liposome treatment on NK cell activity, LN tissue and liver
We next investigated the effect of treatment on NK cell activity and toxicity to the local LN 
tissue. The conjugation of TRAIL liposomes to NK cells does not alter their activity. Results 
showed that NK cells isolated from the inguinal LN of mice treated with TRAIL/Anti-
NK1.1 liposomes for 6 weeks showed no significant difference in growth rate, cytotoxic 
potential and cytokine secretion levels when compared to NK cells isolated from control 
mice (Fig. 5A, B and C). NK cells were isolated from mice that received buffer, TRAIL/IgG 
and TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposome injections subcutaneously for 6 weeks. The isolated cells 
were cultured in vitro for up to 7 days. Their growth rates were compared by counting the 
number of cells on day 3 and day 7 of culture. Results showed that TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 
liposomes did not alter the growth rate of NK cells (Fig. 5A). It has been shown that mouse 
NK cells can induce apoptosis in murine melanoma cell line B16F0 [21]. Coculturing 
isolated NK cells with B16F0 melanoma cells at increasing proportions of isolated NK cells 
indicated that liposome conjugation does not alter their cytotoxic ability (Fig. 5B). Previous 
works demonstrate that mouse NK cells cultured in IL-2 containing media secrete 
interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and this has been used as a metric for evaluating NK cell activity 
[28,29]. NK cells isolated from the different treatment groups showed no significant 
difference in IFN-γ secretion levels (Fig. 5C). TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes did not induce 
significant toxicity to the local LN tissue (Fig. 5D, E and F), consistent with our previous in 
vitro studies [17,22]. The morphology of cells isolated from the LN of animals that received 
subcutaneous injections of buffer, TRAIL/IgG and TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes for 6 
weeks did not show any characteristic features of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 5D). The 
isolated cells were then analyzed using an Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) binding 
assay for determining the extent of apoptotic cells in the LN. The cells were classified into 
four categories based on the degree of Annexin-V and PI staining: viable cells (negative for 
Annexin-V and PI), early apoptotic cells (positive for Annexin-V only), late apoptotic cells 
(positive for Annexin-V and PI), and necrotic cells (positive for PI only). Flow cytometry 
scatter plots (Fig. 5E) and the percentage of viable cells (Fig. 5F) show no significant 
difference in cell viability, indicating that the liposome treatment did not cause harm to the 
local LN cells.
Previous studies have shown that hepatocytes in the liver can exhibit sensitivity to TRAIL at 
extremely high doses [30]. To assess liver toxicity arising from liposomal TRAIL 
administration, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) were measured after 6 weeks of liposome injections. Liver 
transaminases are common biomarkers of liver injury [31]. The concentrations of these 
intracellular transaminases in the serum are normally low, and their presence is indicative of 
damage to the membranes of hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis. The serum levels of liver 
enzymes and H&E stained sections of liver were assessed for common signs of

 hepatotoxicity induced by TRAIL. Mice that received TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposome 
injections showed no signs of hepatotoxicity as evidence by the absence of significant 
elevation in the serum levels of liver enzymes (Fig. S4A) and absence of significant 
apoptosis in H&E stained liver sections (Fig. S4B) as compared to mice that received buffer 
or TRAIL/IgG liposome injections. Further, no notable fluctuation in body weight in 
animals from different treatment groups was observed, although tumor-bearing animals 
show reduced body weight when compared to non-tumor bearing control mice (Fig. S5).
Discussion
The LN often acts as a bridgehead for the lymphatic spread of cancer. Cancer cells in the LN 
often form micrometastatic lesions and then disseminate through the extensive network of 
lymphatic capillaries to result in distant organ metastasis [32]. NK cells in the LN and 
circulation elicit their anti-tumor immune response by expressing TRAIL on their surface. 
Alternatively they can also secrete vesicles containing cytotoxic proteins such as perforins 
and granzymes, that mediate cancer cell death [33]. Both of these pathways are known to 
impair cancer metastasis in experimental animal models [34,35]. But NK cell mediated anti-
tumor immune response is dampened in tumor-bearing immunocompromised hosts [36]. In 
this work, we were interested in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of NK cells in the TDLN 
by coating them with TRAIL liposomes, to evoke a TRAIL-mediated response in cancer 
cells. This approach largely relies on the TRAIL pathway owing to prior studies that 
demonstrate the ability of TRAIL receptor-deficient cancer cells to successfully metastasize 
to the lymph nodes [37,38]. The ability to culture NK cells in vitro has led to several studies 
that have explored the use of NK cells in anti-tumor immunotherapy [39,40]. However, 
overarching problems with current NK cell mediated therapeutic approaches include: 
systemic toxicity, immune rejection, and inability to elicit long lasting immune response to 
prevent future relapse [41].
It has been shown that human cancer cells injected subcutaneously in the lower abdominal 
flank of mice spontaneously metastasize to the skin draining inguinal LN [42]. We 
characterized the spontaneous LN metastasis of human colon cancer cell line SW620 in 
partially immunocompromised B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J (B6Rag1) mice (Fig. 2). The 
presence of functional NK cells in B6Rag1was crucial for testing the efficacy of liposomes 
directed towards functional NK cells. The IC50 of TRAIL on SW620 cells is approximately 
25 ng/ml in vitro. Although the concentration of TRAIL on liposomes is 26.5 ng/mL, the 
presentation of TRAIL in its natural membrane bound form could potentially increase their 
bioactivity as suggested by other studies [43,44]. Since it is difficult to target LN via the 
intravenous route, other routes for drug delivery, such as subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and 
intramuscular injections are often used to deliver liposomes to LN [45][46]. It has been 
reported that NK1.1 expressing NK cells actively patrol the inguinal LN in B6Rag1 mice 
[47]. The pharmacokinetics of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes (Fig. 1) is consistent with 
works that demonstrate a highly motile population of NK cells that patrol mouse LN 
[48,49]. When comparing the extent of tumor burden in the tumor draining inguinal LN, 
TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes were able to significantly reduce the incidence of LN 
metastasis in all 5 mice in the treatment group (Fig. 3 and 4). To eliminate any potential 
bias, mice were randomly divided into 5 treatment groups based on the size of the primary

 tumor by the end of week 2. There was no significant difference in the size of primary tumor 
(Fig. S3C) and inguinal lymph node metastasis (Fig. 3C) among different treatment groups. 
The ability of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes to bind to NK cells to form “super” NK cells 
played a significant role in reducing the ability of tumor cells to metastasize to the draining 
LN. The soluble form of TRAIL or liposome bound TRAIL without the NK cell targeting 
antibody showed no significant effect in reducing the tumor burden in the TDLN (Fig. 3 and 
4). Also, given that the uninterrupted but slow growth of the primary tumor in the TRAIL/
Anti-NK1.1 treatment group (Supplementary Fig. 3), it is clear that complete elimination of 
the primary tumor is not necessary to prevent metastasis to the LN. The slower growth of the 
primary tumor in the treatment group could be due to tumor infiltrating super NK cells 
working to slow their growth. We found that there was no significant difference in the 
percentage of primary tumor infiltrating NK cells across all treatment groups 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Given the low amount (1–5%) of tumor infiltrating NK cells along 
with the unmitigated growth of the primary tumor in all groups, we conclude that 
subcutaneously injected liposomes reach the TDLN via skin draining lymphatics and bind to 
TDLN-resident NK cells to elicit TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. It has been shown that 
subcutaneous injection of drug adjacent to the primary tumor is efficient in animal models 
for delivering drugs to the LN [50]. However, other routes of administration such intra-LN 
injections have been shown to be more efficient in lymphatic drug delivery in human 
clinical trials [51].
In this study, we demonstrated the ability of TRAIL liposomes conjugated to NK cells 
within the TDLN to prevent the metastasis of a subcutaneous primary tumor using a human 
xenograft model. The majority of cancers metastasize through the lymphatic system and LN 
metastasis is a negative prognostic factor in many cancers [52]. By targeting TRAIL 
liposomes to NK cells, their therapeutic potential is enhanced by presenting TRAIL in its 
natural form, bound to the surface of NK cells. In this case there is no need to force other 
type of cells such as dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells to present TRAIL, which are often 
used for lymph node-targeted nanoparticle delivery [14]. Given the successful elimination of 
tumor cells from the TDLN, future work could be directed towards exploring other potential 
routes for liposome administration in an orthotopic syngeneic animal model with an intact 
immune system and testing the efficacy in patient LN derived NK cells and tumor cells after 
surgical procedures. The proposed approach holds several advantages for LN targeted tumor 
therapy: high uptake in the TDLN, ability to present the therapeutic substance to cancer cells 
in its natural form, and low toxicity to local LN tissue.

fluorescence (FITC conjugated anti-human TRAIL) from B220+ B-cells, CD3+ T-cells, 
CD11c+ dendritic cells, CD335+ NK cells and CD11b+ macrophages from the inguinal 
lymph nodes of mice injected with buffer (filled), naked liposomes (– – – – – – – – ), 
TRAIL/IgG liposomes (············) or TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes (___________) 24 hr 
post-injection. (C) Representative fluorescent confocal micrographs of NK cells isolated 
from the inguinal lymph nodes of mice subcutaneously injected with naked (t=24 hr), 
TRAIL/IgG (t=24 hr) or TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes (t=24, 48, 72 and 96 hr) labeled 
with nuclear stain DAPI and anti-human TRAIL on the liposome surface. Scale bar=20μm. 
(D) Numerical quantification of the percentage of NK cells bound with liposomes with 
different functionalizations. Bars represent the mean and standard deviation from 10 
different confocal images for each time point.

 Fig. 2. Characterization of in vivo tumor model
(A) Sequential noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of B6Rag1 mice implanted with 
2×106 SW620-luc cells subcutaneously on the lower left abdominal flank shows the growth 
of a primary tumor and the development of metastasis in the tumor draining inguinal lymph 
node with time. Tumor development was monitored by luciferase signal, measured by in 
vivo imaging at week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after tumor implantation. The color scale indicates 
bioluminescence signal intensity. The pigment-associated signal loss allows the 
visualization of the primary tumor and inguinal lymph node metastasis separately when the 
animal is imaged on its back and front, respectively. (B) Quantification of total flux from a 
circular region of interest (ROI) around the primary tumor and inguinal lymph node 
metastasis. Each point represents the mean ± standard deviation of total flux from 5 different 
mice. The photon flux increases with time, showing the growth of primary tumor and 
inguinal lymph node metastasis upon tumor implantation.

 Fig.3. Metastatic burden in the tumor draining inguinal lymph nodes
(A) Sequential non-invasive bioluminescence imaging shows the growth of inguinal lymph 
node metastases in mice under different treatment conditions. Three representative mice per 
group are shown at week 2, 4 and 6 for each treatment condition. The color scale indicates 
bioluminescence signal intensity. (B) Quantification of total flux, indicating the tumor 
burden in the inguinal lymph nodes with time. Each point represents the mean ± standard 
deviation for 5 mice at each time point (4 mice at week 6 for buffer and soluble TRAIL 
treatment groups). (C) Box and whisker plot comparing total flux from the inginal lymph 
nodes in mice from different treatment groups at week 2. NS, Not Signficant (Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test) (D) Box and whisker plot comparing the total flux from the inguinal lymph 
nodes in mice from different treatment groups at week 6. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 (Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test) and n=5 mice per group (4 mice for buffer and soluble TRAIL treatment 
groups).

 Fig. 5. Mouse NK cell activity assays and toxicity to LN tissue
(A) Growth of NK cells isolated from the untreated and treated groups shows no significant 
difference in their growth based on cell counts on day 3 and day 7 of culture. n=3 for all 
samples. Each point represents the mean ± standard deviation of the number of cells. (B) 
Triplicate cultures containing different proportions of effector (NK cells from control and 
treatment groups) to target cells (B16F0 murine melanoma cells) were initiated one day after 
isolating NK cells. n=3 for all samples. Each point represents the mean ± standard deviation 
of the percentage cytotoxicity of NK cells isolated from each treatment group. (C) The 
media conditioned by isolated NK cells was assayed for IFN-γ levels on day 1 and day 7 of 
culture using an ELISA kit. n=3 for all samples. Bars represent mean and standard deviation 
of IFN-γ levels from each treatment condition. (D) Representative images of cells isolated 
from the inguinal lymph nodes of control and TRAIL/IgG and TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 treated 
C57BL/6 mice 6 weeks after treatment. Scale bar=100 μm. (E) Representative Annexin-V/
propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry scatter plots of cells isolated from untreated mice and
