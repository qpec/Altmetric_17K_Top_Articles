Abstract Phagocytic immune cells kill pathogens in the phagolysosomal compartment with a
cocktail of antimicrobial agents. Chief among them are reactive species produced in the so-called
oxidative burst. Here, we show that bacteria exposed to a neutrophil-like cell line experience a
rapid and massive oxidation of cytosolic thiols. Using roGFP2-based fusion probes, we could show
that this massive breakdown of the thiol redox homeostasis was dependent on phagocytosis,
presence of NADPH oxidase and ultimately myeloperoxidase. Interestingly, the redox-mediated
fluorescence change in bacteria expressing a glutathione-specific Grx1-roGFP2 fusion protein or an
unfused roGFP2 showed highly similar reaction kinetics to the ones observed with roGFP2-Orp1,
under all conditions tested. We recently observed such an indiscriminate oxidation of roGFP2-
based fusion probes by HOCl with fast kinetics in vitro. In line with these observations, abating
HOCl production in immune cells with a myeloperoxidase inhibitor significantly attenuated the
oxidation of all three probes in bacteria.

Introduction
When bacteria encounter professional phagocytic immune cells, such as neutrophils or macro-
phages, they are engulfed and phagocytized. Within the phagosome, an intracellular compartment
formed during phagocytosis, bacteria are exposed to a complex mixture of toxins, chiefly among
them
oxidative
and
nitrosative
species
(Hurst,
2012;
Segal,
2005;
Urban
et
al.,
2006;
Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013). This mechanism, termed respiratory burst, is initiated by the reduc-
tion of oxygen to superoxide radicals through NADPH oxidase NOX2, an enzyme that is assembled
at the phagosomal membrane (Chanock et al., 1994; Segal and Abo, 1993). From superoxide,
other reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are formed and released
into the phagosomal space (Hampton et al., 1998). The respiratory burst is potentiated through
lysosomal degranulation that releases myeloperoxidase (MPO) and other microbicidal proteins into
the phagosome (Hurst, 2012). MPO catalyzes the formation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong
oxidant, from H2O2 and chloride ions (Furtmu
¨ller et al., 2003). These ROS can oxidize and damage
virtually any cellular molecule, and together with other subsequent mechanisms, ultimately lead to
microbial death. In contrast, individuals with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a genetic disease
with impaired NADPH oxidase activity, as well as mice that lack components of the NADPH oxidase
are strongly susceptible to microbial infection (Hampton et al., 1998; Holmes et al., 1967; Man-
dell, 1974; Segal, 2005; Segal et al., 2000; Vethanayagam et al., 2011; Winkelstein et al., 2000).

 The mechanisms that kill bacteria in phagocytic immune cells are still not fully understood. However,
investigation of the phagosomal environment is quite challenging due to its transient nature and the
complexity of the mixture of oxidative species (Nu
¨sse, 2011).
Several methods have been employed for the detection of phagosomal ROS, including fluores-
cent redox-sensitive dyes. However, most of these methods have a number of limitations such as
non-specificity, irreversibility, non-quantitative information, or a lack of subcellular localization (Nau-
seef, 2014). The most widespread compound to detect H2O2 in intact cells is 2’,7’-dihydrodichloro-
fluorescein
(H2DCF),
which
can
be
oxidized
to
fluorescent
2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF)
(Chen et al., 2010; Maghzal et al., 2012). DCF oxidation, however, is considered mainly qualitative,
as it is observable in the absence of H2O2 and is stimulated by metals, peroxidases, and cytochrome
c. Therefore, it does not provide detailed quantitative and compartment-specific information
(Meyer and Dick, 2010; Rota et al., 1999; Tarpey et al., 2004). Recently, roGFP2 (reduction-oxida-
tion-sensitive green fluorescent protein 2) has been used to study oxidative and nitrosative stress
dynamics in Salmonella inside macrophages (van der Heijden et al., 2015). roGFP2 has several
advantages when compared to commercially available fluorescent redox-sensitive dyes. As a GFP
variant, it can be genetically introduced into virtually any biological system and can be even targeted
to specific cellular compartments (Dooley et al., 2004; Hanson et al., 2004). Its redox state, which
depends on the redox state of the biological system, can then be measured with the help of an engi-
neered pair of cysteine residues close to the fluorophore. The reversible disulfide bond formation
between these cysteines triggers a slight conformational change, which results in a reversible change
of the protonation status of the fluorophore. The reduced and oxidized form of roGFP2 therefore
have distinct fluorescence excitation maxima at 395 and 490 nm, respectively (Dooley et al., 2004).
Either the 405/488 nm ratio with laser-based excitation or 390/480 nm ratio on filter-based recording
devices can thus be used to directly determine the probe’s redox state (Meyer and Dick, 2010).
This ratiometric approach compensates for variations due to differences in absolute roGFP2 concen-
trations, allowing for quantitative monitoring. These probes thus allow compartment-specific real-
eLife digest A group of cells of the immune system defends the body against infections by
wrapping themselves around bacteria, and effectively ‘eating’ them. During this process, called
phagocytosis, the cell also douses the bacterium with a deadly cocktail of chemicals, including an
antiseptic – hydrogen peroxide – and bleach. This mixture chemically burns, and then kills, the
invader. The immune cells create hydrogen peroxide and bleach through chemical reactions that
require two enzymes, NOX2 and MPO. The NOX2 enzyme is activated first, and produces a
compound which is then transformed into hydrogen peroxide. In turn, hydrogen peroxide is used by
MPO to make bleach.
Phagocytosis is still poorly understood, and difficult to study: for example, it is not clear when the
toxic mix is released, and which of its components are the most important. Here, Degrossoli et al.
peer into this process: to do so, they genetically engineer bacteria and give them a built-in chemical
burn tracker. The bacteria are made to carry fluorescent proteins which normally glow under blue
light, but start to also react to violet light if they are exposed to a chemical burn.
Under the microscope, when these bacteria encounter immune cells, they start glowing under
violet light only a few seconds after they have been phagocytized. This shows that, during
phagocytosis, the chemical mix is used almost immediately. The new technique also reveals that
cells without a working NOX2 enzyme – which cannot produce hydrogen peroxide – could not burn
the bacteria. However, hydrogen peroxide is also used by MPO to create bleach. If just MPO is
deactivated, the cells can burn the bacteria, but much less efficiently. This, and the speed with which
these fluorescent proteins were burnt, shows that the bleach is the main component of the toxic mix
used during phagocytosis.
Chronic granulomatous disease is a condition where patients can have a faulty version of NOX2,
which makes it harder for them to fight infection. Understanding the mechanisms and the enzymes
associated with phagocytosis could lead to improved treatment in the future.

 time ratiometric quantification of the intracellular redox status in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic
cells (Arias-Barreiro et al., 2010; Bhaskar et al., 2014; Meyer and Dick, 2010; van der Heijden
et al., 2015).
Here, we report the use of three different roGFP2-based fluorescent redox probes to quantita-
tively track the redox state of bacteria during the phagocytic process. Using the H2O2-sensitive
roGFP2-Orp1 probe expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, we could show with fluorescence
spectroscopy and quantitative fluorescence microscopy that phagocytosis by a neutrophil-like cell
line leads to probe oxidation within seconds. Comparison of roGFP2-Orp1’s oxidation kinetics to
the oxidation kinetics of the glutathione-specific Grx1-roGFP2 probe and the oxidation kinetics of
unfused roGFP2 suggested that the presence of a strong oxidant in the phagosome is over-riding
the specificity of the fusion probes. Based on previous in vitro studies and chemical inhibition of
myeloperoxidase, we conclude that HOCl is the major reactive species during the onset of the respi-
ratory burst in neutrophils and initiates non-specific thiol oxidation in phagocytized bacteria.
Results
Expression of the roGFP2-based fusion probes in Escherichia coli
When bacteria are phagocytized by professional phagocytic immune cells, they are exposed to a
toxic cocktail of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) gener-
ated by the action of NADPH-oxidase and superoxide dismutase. We wanted to monitor the
increase in H2O2 and potentially other reactive species inside the bacterial cell during those host-
pathogen interactions in situ. Thus, we expressed the roGFP2 fusion probe roGFP2-Orp1 in Escheri-
chia coli MG1655. This probe is specifically designed to measure H2O2 in biological systems.
We could express roGFP2-Orp1 stably in E. coli from a plasmid (Figure 1A). Using fluorescence
spectroscopy, we could determine the oxidation state of the probe inside the E. coli cytoplasm using
the ratio between the excitation wavelengths of 405 and 488 nm (Dooley et al., 2004;
Gutscher et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 2004). Addition of the strong oxidant Aldrithiol-2 (AT-2, 2,20-
Dipyridyl disulfide) to the bacterial cells led to full oxidation of the probe, while addition of DTT
resulted in full reduction (Figure 1D and G). The exposure to reactive species in the phagolysosome
could also interfere with the glutathione redox potential (EGSH) within the cell. Thus, we introduced
an expression plasmid encoding Grx1-roGFP2 into E. coli. Grx1-roGFP2 was specifically designed to
measure the glutathione redox potential (EGSH).We could stably express Grx1-roGFP2 in E. coli
(Figure 1B), fully reduce it with DTT, and fully oxidize it with AT-2 (Figure 1E and H). Additionally,
we expressed unfused roGFP2 in E. coli and performed the same experiments (Figure 1C,F,I).
roGFP2-Orp1 expressed in E. coli reacts toward exogenous hydrogen
peroxide
Having established that the probe could be fully reduced and fully oxidized in E. coli, we then tested
the response of the roGFP2-Orp1 probe towards exogenous H2O2. As expected, roGFP2-Orp1
changed its redox state when E. coli was exposed to a bolus of exogenous hydrogen peroxide at
concentrations as low as 10 mM (Figure 1J). Within a short period of time, the probe’s redox state
returned to the pre-H2O2 steady state, indicating that the bacterial cell can recover from the oxida-
tive insult. Higher concentrations of exogenous hydrogen peroxide led to longer recovery times of
the probe, until at concentrations of 10 mM, the probe did no longer recover (Figure 1J).
PLB-985 cells, when differentiated to neutrophils, phagocytize E. coli
Neutrophil granulocytes are the first line of defense against bacteria in the blood stream. They can
phagocytize microorganisms and kill them. One of the main killing factors employed by neutrophils
is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during the so-called oxidative burst
(Segal, 2005; Verchier et al., 2007). For our experiments, we selected the myeloid PLB-985 cell line
that can be differentiated to neutrophil-like cells (Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010). To differentiate PLB-985
cells we exposed them to DMSO (Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010) and added interferon g (IFNg). After 5
days of incubation, differentiated cells showed significantly higher expression of CD11b and CD64
than undifferentiated cells, while CD16 and CD66b expression was unaltered (Figure 2A–D). Differ-
entiated cells lost their spherical shape, and the cells showed a morphology typical of neutrophils

 when stained with May-Gru
¨ nwald-Giemsa stain (Figure 2E–H). Differentiated cells internalized IgG-
opsonized E. coli, demonstrating their phagocytic capacity (Figure 3A). In contrast, the usage of
undifferentiated PLB-985 cells or non-opsonized E. coli led to significantly decreased internalization
of bacteria, despite their presence in the surrounding medium (Figure 3B and D). When IFNg was
not added during the differentiation process, phagocytosis was less pronounced (Figure 3C). Our
microscopic data was corroborated and quantified by flow cytometry (Figure 3G–I). For subsequent
experiments, we used DMSO+ IFNg-differentiated cells and opsonized E. coli, because under those
conditions the neutrophil-like cells had the highest phagocytic capacity.
roGFP2-based probes are oxidized in phagocytized E. coli
We then monitored the oxidation state of roGFP2-Orp1 in E. coli during phagocytosis. Thus,
roGFP2-Orp1-expressing E. coli were co-incubated with differentiated neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells
and the ratio of fluorescent intensity at 405/488 nm excitation was measured as readout of the
probe’s oxidation state in a fluorescence plate reader. The oxidation state of the probe increased,
when opsonized E. coli expressing roGFP2-Orp1 were incubated with neutrophil-like cells. The oxi-
dation kinetic showed a gradual increase in the 405/488 nm ratio, as soon as E. coli was incubated
with neutrophil-like PLB-985, reaching a plateau after 60 min of incubation and remaining stably oxi-
dized until the end of the measurement (2 hr). In contrast, the probe was not oxidized when bacteria
were incubated with medium or undifferentiated cells (Figure 4A). When E. coli expressing Grx1-
roGFP2 was cultured with neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells, the redox response of the probe was highly
similar to the response observed with roGFP2-Orp1 (Figure 4B), and we essentially observed the
same oxidation kinetics with the unfused roGFP2 probe (Figure 4C).
Probe oxidation is dependent on effective phagocytosis
The oxidation kinetics of the roGFP2-Orp1 probe in E. coli cultured with differentiated PLB-985 cells
was not as fast as in an E. coli bacteria suspension that was directly exposed to high concentrations
of H2O2 (compare Figure 1J and Figure 4A). We argued that this could mean that bacteria experi-
ence redox stress from the host cells only upon phagocytosis. To examine if phagocytosis indeed
plays a role in probe oxidation in the E. coli cytoplasm, we blocked phagocytosis by treating the
neutrophil-like cells with Cytochalasin D (CD). Cytochalasin D-pre-treated, differentiated PLB-985
cells did phagocytize opsonized E. coli less effectively than untreated, differentiated PLB-985 cells or
cells treated with DMSO (vehicle control) (Figure 5A). To verify the effective blocking of phagocyto-
sis, we used opsonized FITC-labeled Zymosan and tested the phagocytic capacity of Cytochalasin
D-treated and untreated PLB-985 cells. In this case, we quenched the fluorescence of attached
Zymosan particles, giving us a more exact readout of the phagocytic capacity. Zymosan phagocyto-
sis was almost completely blocked in Cytochalasin D-treated neutrophil-like cells when compared to
the control or cells pre-incubated with DMSO (vehicle control) (Figure 5B). Having established the
inhibition of phagocytosis, we tested the redox state of roGFP2-Orp1 in E. coli in the presence of
differentiated, Cytochalasin D-treated PLB-985 cells. The 405/488 nm ratio of roGFP2-Orp1 did not
change significantly over time (Figure 5C). Similarly, oxidation of the Grx1-roGFP2 fusion and

 unfused roGFP2 probe was phagocytosis-dependent (Figure 5D & E) indicating that bacteria are
exposed to reactive oxygen species only when internalized.
Once phagocytized, the redox state of the bacterial cytoplasm changes
promptly
Our data with exogenous hydrogen peroxide demonstrated that the roGFP2-Orp1 probe reacts
with very fast kinetics toward hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, the probe’s 405/488 nm ratio in E. coli
cells exposed to neutrophil-like cells changed more gradually. In combination with the significantly
lower probe oxidation in E. coli exposed to phagocytosis-impaired neutrophil-like cells, we hypothe-
sized that phagocytosis is the rate-limiting step for probe oxidation. To test if the probes are indeed
oxidized only upon phagocytosis, we monitored the dynamics of probe oxidation using quantitative
fluorescence microscopy. Our experiments show that the probe remains in a reduced state in bacte-
ria not yet phagocytized, but this changes promptly within seconds upon phagocytosis (Figure 6,
Video 1). The gradual increase in probe oxidation in E. coli exposed to neutrophil-like cells thus
reflects the gradual phagocytosis of individual bacteria over time.

 roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation is dependent on NOX2 activity
The initial superoxide generated during the oxidative burst is produced by NADPH oxidase. Super-
oxide itself is highly reactive, but also the originator of further reactive species that are produced
subsequently during the oxidative burst, chiefly among them H2O2, through superoxide dismutase
action (Dupre
´-Crochet et al., 2013; Klebanoff et al., 2013; Segal et al., 1980; Segal, 2005; Win-
terbourn, 2014). Thus, we tested the influence of NOX2 on probe oxidation in E. coli. The genera-
tion of reactive species by PLB-985 cells was confirmed using the oxidant-sensitive dye 2’,7’-
Dichlordihydrofluorescein-diacetate (H2DCFDA), which is oxidized intracellularly to 2’,7’-Dichlorfluor-
escein (DCF) by a number of reactive oxygen species (Chen et al., 2010; Yazdani, 2015). Neutro-
phil-like PLB-985 cells, when stimulated with PMA, showed higher DCF fluorescence than non-
stimulated cells (Figure 7A), confirming previous reports that these cells do indeed produce ROS
(Segal et al., 1980). ROS production was also stimulated by opsonized E. coli (Figure 7B). Based on
the previous findings and our own data, we argued that cells lacking NOX2 activity should not be
able to induce roGFP2-Orp1 probe oxidation in E. coli cells. PLB-985 cells lacking gp91phox, the cata-
lytic subunit of NOX2, were indeed unable to induce significant oxidation of roGFP2-Orp1 in E. coli
(Figure 8).
Probe oxidation is dependent on myeloperoxidase
Although PLB-985 cells lacking NOX2 activity were incapable to induce significant oxidation of
roGFP2-Orp1 in E. coli, the virtually identical behavior of all three roGFP2-based probes in our
phagocytosis experiments is inconsistent with superoxide-derived H2O2 as the main factor in probe
oxidation. All three probes have different specificities: Unfused roGFP2, for example, is known to
react slowly with H2O2 and glutathione in vitro and thus is not well-suited for the detection of tran-
sient and weak oxidative stress (Meyer and Dick, 2010). Additionally, the Grx1-roGFP2 probe rap-
idly equilibrates with the cell’s glutathione redox potential, but is not directly affected by hydrogen
peroxide (Gutscher et al., 2008). However, we showed recently, that, in vitro, the specificity of these
three probes breaks down in the presence of strong oxidants. All roGFP2-based probes react similar
and with fast kinetics with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and polysulfides in vitro (Mu

 myeloperoxidase inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH). Pre-treatment of neutrophil-like
cells with ABAH resulted in a significant attenuation of the probes’ response (Figure 10A–C) and
release of reactive species as measured with an 2’,7’-Dichlordihydrofluorescein-diacetate assay (Fig-
ure 7). Phagocytosis was not affected by ABAH treatment (Figure 10E–F). We thus conclude that
hypochlorous acid is the major reactive species that leads to intracellular thiol oxidation as observed
in all three roGFP2-based probes.
Discussion
Phagocytosis accompanied by the respiratory burst is an important mechanism by the innate
immune system to protect against invading bacteria. However, our knowledge on the early events
within the phagosome as well as inside engulfed bacteria is quite limited. This is mainly due to a lack
of methods that would allow specific, spatio-temporal, and quantitative measurements of ROS and
changes in the cell’s redox status (Balce and Yates, 2013; Kalyanaraman et al., 2012; Winter-
bourn, 2014). To close this gap, we set up a phagocytosis assay using neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells
and E. coli bacteria expressing roGFP2-based probes in their cytoplasm.
Our initial hypothesis was that H2O2 plays a major role in microbial oxidation during early phago-
cytosis, as NADPH oxidase is the first enzyme in the respiratory burst cascade and the generated
superoxide is thought to be quickly converted to hydrogen peroxide (Segal et al., 1980;
Segal, 2005). We therefore used roGFP2-Orp1 in E. coli to specifically measure H2O2 accumulation
in the bacterial cell. The probe was oxidized rapidly inside E. coli in the presence of 1 mM H2O2, but
recovery was observable within approximately 30 min. Permanent probe oxidation was achieved
upon addition of 10 mM H2O2, suggesting that the bacteria are incapable of detoxifying these high
concentrations.
We then tested the response of roGFP2-Orp1, but also Grx1-roGFP2 and unfused roGFP2 to co-
incubation and phagocytosis by PLB-985. All probes were effectively oxidized under these conditions
and showed virtually the same kinetics. This was somewhat unexpected, since the roGFP2-Orp1
probe typically shows high specificity toward hydrogen peroxide, whereas the Grx1-roGFP2 probe
was
designed
to
rapidly
and
specifically
equilibrate
with
the
glutathione
redox
couple
(Gutscher et al., 2008): in vitro, H2O2 treatment of purified Grx1-roGFP2 did not lead to significant
probe oxidation even at concentrations as high as 100 mM (Mu
¨ller et al., 2017a; 2017b). In the
same vein, unfused roGFP2 only slowly equilibrates with the glutathione redox couple and did not
show significant oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and oxidized glutathione in vivo and in vitro
(Meyer and Dick, 2010; Mu
¨ller et al., 2017a; 2017b). However, we previously showed that all three
probes are effectively oxidized by HOCl in vitro (Mu
¨ller et al., 2017a; 2017b), and HOCl is well
known to be highly reactive with most thiols (Peskin and Winterbourn, 2001; Storkey et al., 2014).
To test if this holds true in an in vivo setting in bacteria as well, we treated E. coli expressing any of
the three probes with increasing concentrations of HOCl. The response was instant at all concentra-
tions and comparable for all three probes. It is therefore likely that a complex mixture of reactive
species, with HOCl as the main component, leads to the oxidation of the probes in E. coli.
In a parallel approach, ROS formation in differentiated PLB-985 cells stimulated with PMA was
found strongly increased as well. Others have compared the activity of PLB-985 (and cell line HL-60,
which is essentially the same cell line [Drexler et al., 2003]) to that of neutrophils. It was shown that

bacteria expressing the Grx1-roGFP2 fusion probe (B) and unfused roGFP2 (C) showed kinetics virtually identical to E. coli cells expressing roGFP2-
Orp1.

 this cell line, when differentiated to neutrophils, expresses slightly less myeloperoxidase than blood
neutrophils (Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010) and had a generally weaker functional response. However, in
other studies, superoxide production and MPO activity have been described to be comparable or
even exceeding that of human neutrophils (Hua et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 1988).
Since HOCl and other reactive species produced during the oxidative burst are ultimately derived
from superoxide produced by NADPH-oxidase, roGFP2-based probe oxidation was largely dimin-
ished when PLB-985 cells lacking NOX2 activity were used in the co-cultivation assays. Our data also
indicates that E. coli experiences the largest amount of oxidative stress within the phagolysosome,
since the probe expressed in non-phagocytized bacteria was significantly less oxidized in the same
co-cultivation assay (Figure 6; Video 1). This is somewhat surprising, as especially H2O2 is thought
to easily diffuse through membranes (Dupre
´-Crochet et al., 2013).
Our hypothesis that HOCl could be responsible for the unspecific roGFP2 probe oxidation in
phagocytized E. coli was further substantiated using the myeloperoxidase inhibitor ABAH. Pre-treat-
ment of neutrophil-like cells with ABAH resulted in a significant decrease of the probes’ oxidation
and release of reactive species as measured with a DCF assay. Taken together, these results suggest
HOCl is most likely the major reactive species responsible for roGFP2 oxidation in E. coli ingested
by PLB-985 cells.
Our results provide some insights into the nature of ROS released within the phagosome. While
production of different ROS at the onset of phagocytosis was known and described before and has
been observed using roGFP2 expressed in bacteria (van der Heijden et al., 2015), the exact compo-
sition and concentrations of individual reactive species as well as their time-resolved release remain
largely elusive (Dupre
´-Crochet et al., 2013; Hurst, 2012; Klebanoff et al., 2013; Winterbourn and
Kettle, 2013). As soon as neutrophils ingest opsonized bacteria and the vacuole is formed, degranu-
lation begins within seconds and NADPH oxidase becomes activated and produces superoxide,
which dismutates to H2O2 (Segal et al., 1980; Segal, 2005). When the granules are fused to the
phagosome, MPO levels increase, leading to the formation of HOCl and derived chloramines
(Hurst, 2012; Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013). This HOCl generation in the phagolysosome could
be directly observed in porcine neutrophils phagocytizing zymosan particles with the help of a chem-
ical probe selective for HOCl (Koide et al., 2011). Due to its high abundance, MPO thus can be
regarded as a sink for hydrogen peroxide, which would favor the view that it does not accumulate to
concentrations high enough to harm bacteria (Dupre
´-Crochet et al., 2013; Klebanoff et al., 2013;
Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013). Instead, HOCl and potentially HOCl-derived chloramines seem to
play the major role in the oxidation of bacterial macromolecules (Chapman et al., 2002; Clark and

 Borregaard, 1985; Klebanoff et al., 2013; Vissers and Winterbourn, 1987). These results are in
agreement with previous studies in which bacterial killing following phagocytosis was analyzed
(Palazzolo et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2009). GFP bleaching in phagocytized bacteria suggested
that cytoplasmic HOCl concentrations were significant (Hurst, 2012; Winterbourn and Kettle,
2013). Our approach allowed real-time tracking of the roGFP2 oxidation state during phagocytosis
and thus provided strong evidence of the presence of HOCl or derived chloramines within the cyto-
plasm of bacteria within seconds after phagocytosis.
Interestingly, most individuals with MPO deficiency do not particularly suffer from microbial infec-
tions (Kutter et al., 2000; Nauseef, 1988; Parry et al., 1981). Inhibition of MPO, the enzyme pro-
ducing HOCl in neutrophils, led to lower probe oxidation but did not fully inhibit oxidation,
indicating that ROS produced prior to HOCl can still affect the thiol redox state of proteins in E.
coli’s cytoplasm, or alternatively, that ABAH did not fully inhibit MPO, as has been described

Materials and methods
PLB-985 culture and differentiation
The human myeloid leukemia cell line PLB-985
(obtained
from
DSMZ,
German
collection
of
microorganisms and cell culture) was cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) at 37˚C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2.
Cells were authenticated based on their ability to
differentiate to neutrophils and the associated
expression of the respective surface markers (see
below). Their mycoplasma status was not tested
by us, however, all cell lines distributed by DSMZ
are certified mycoplasma negative. Cell cultures were passaged twice a week to maintain a cell den-
sity between 2 � 105 and 1 � 106 � mL�1. For neutrophil-like phenotype differentiation, exponen-
tially growing cells at a starting density of 2 � 105 � mL�1 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMax and 1.25% DMSO for 5 days (Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010).
The phagocytic function of the PLB-985 cells was stimulated with 2000 U � mL�1 interferon-g (Immu-
noTools, Friesoythe, Germany), added to the culture on day 4 during the differentiation period
(Tlili et al., 2011). Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion and was typically >90%. The
efficiency of differentiation was estimated by morphological analysis with May-Gru
¨ nwald-Giemsa
stain and flow cytometric analysis of the expression of surface markers CD11b and CD64 using spe-
cific phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). 105 PE stained cells
were monitored by flow cytometer BD FACSCanto II (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) equipped with three lasers, with blue (488 nm, air-cooled, 20 mW solid state), red (633
nm, 17 mW HeNe) and violet wavelengths (405 nm, 30 mW solid state). The red fluorescence (PE
emission) was collected after passing through a 585/42 nm band pass (BP) filter. Data was analyzed
using Flow Jo software Version 10.2 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).
Construction of genetically encoded, redox-sensitive fluorescent
probes for expression in E. coli
Construction of plasmid pCC_roGFP2 for expression of unfused roGFP2 (Table 1) in E. coli was
described previously (Mu
¨ller et al., 2017a). For the expression of roGFP2-Orp1 and Grx1-roGFP2 in
E. coli, the respective gene regions were amplified using the primer pairs listed in Table 1 from
pQE-based vectors that served as template (Table 2). Subsequently, the PCR products were cloned
into empty pCC using the restriction enzymes NdeI and EcoRI. pCC expresses proteins in E. coli
with an IPTG-inducible Tac promoter (Masuch et al., 2015). E. coli XL1 blue was used as a cloning
host. The pCC vectors containing the three redox-sensitive fluorescent probes (roGFP2, Grx1-
roGFP2, and roGFP2-Orp1) were subsequently transformed into E. coli MG1655 and 100 mg/mL
ampicillin was added to the growth medium for maintenance of the plasmid (Table 2).

E. coli strains harboring pCC vectors containing the roGFP2-based probes (Table 2) were cultured in
LB liquid medium with 200 mg/mL of ampicillin at 37˚C overnight. The optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) was measured and the bacterial suspension was diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 with fresh

roGFP2-based probes was then induced with 100 mM IPTG and the culture was incubated at 20˚C
overnight. These bacterial cells, now containing roGFP2-based probes, were then washed twice in
40 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and re-suspended in 1 mL HEPES buffer to a final OD600 of 0.3. The
fluorescence intensity was measured in an FP-8500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The
emission wavelength was fixed at 510 nm and excitation wavelength was scanned from 350 to 500
nm. Bandwidths of excitation and emission were set to 5 nm. The cell suspension in the cuvette was
continuously stirred with a magnetic stir bar and the temperature of the temperature controller
EHC-813 (Jasco) was set to 25˚C. Fluorescence excitation ratios (405/488 nm) were used as measure-
ment of probe oxidation (Arias-Barreiro et al., 2010; Meyer and Dick, 2010). Oxidation with 100
mM aldrithiol-2 (AT-2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and reduction with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT,
Sigma-Aldrich) were used to fully oxidize and fully reduce the probes, respectively (Figure 1D–F).

 Measurement of roGFP2-based probe oxidation state in a 96-well
format
E. coli cells expressing roGFP2-based probes as described above were washed twice in PBS pH 7.4
and resuspended in PBS pH 7.4 with 0.5% FBS to a final OD600 of 0.1–0.3. FBS was omitted in
experiments where no PLB-985 cells were present (Figure 1J and Figure 8). Fifty microliters of this
E. coli suspension were placed in the wells of a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate (Nunc, Rochester,
NY). Fluorescence intensity was recorded during every minute for 10 min using the Synergy H1
multi-detection microplate reader (Biotek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) at the excitation wave-
lengths 405 and 488 nm and emission wavelength at 530 nm. Then 50 mL of the selected chemical
solution or the respective PLB-985 cell suspension was added to the wells and the fluorescence
intensity was monitored for another 2 hr under the same conditions. The signals of fully oxidized and
fully reduced probes were obtained by adding 100 mM AT-2 or 50 mM DTT to the bacteria culture
at the start of the 2 hr measurement. The fluorescence excitation ratios (405/488 nm) were used as
measurement of probe oxidation and all values were normalized to the values obtained for fully oxi-
dized (AT-2-treated) and for fully reduced (DTT-treated) bacteria cultures.
Phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells
E. coli cells expressing roGFP-based probes (as described above) were opsonized by incubation for
30 min at 37˚C with 1 mg. mL�1 human immunoglobulin G (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS pH 7.4, then
washed twice in PBS and re-suspended in PBS with 0.5% FBS to an OD600 of 0.1. 50 mL of opsonized
E. coli was then added to 50 mL of differentiated PLB-985 cell suspension (107 mL�1) in PBS with
0.5% FBS. Thus a ratio of 10 E. coli bacteria per PLB-985 cell was used to initiate phagocytosis. Cells
and bacteria were then co-incubated at 37˚C, and phagocytosis was stopped by adding 100 mL of
ice-cold PBS at certain time points. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and samples were
kept on ice until subjected to flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto II flow
cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company) with an argon laser operating at 488 nm using the 530/
30 emission filter to detect the fluorescence of the roGFP2-based probes expressed in phagocytized
bacteria. For each sample, a total of 10,000 viable cells were counted. The mean fluorescence inten-
sity (MFI) multiplied by the percentage of viable cells that had ingested fluorescent particles was
used to evaluate the phagocytic capacity of PLB-985 cells. In some experiments, phagocytosis was
inhibited by treatment of differentiated PLB-985 cells with 250 mM cytochalasin D (Sigma-Aldrich) for
30 min at 37˚C before co-incubation with opsonized bacteria.
Fluorescence microscopy
Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells from the phagocytosis assay were centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min and
resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2.5 mg. mL�1 TRITC-conjugated phalloidin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated with phalloidin for 40 min at room temperature, protected
from light. Excess phalloidin was removed by centrifugation and cells were resuspended by pipetting
up and down in buffered glycerol containing 0.5 mg/mL DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then visual-
ized on a slide in a BX51 fluorescence microscope with a U-UCD8 condenser, a U-LH100HGAPO
burner, a U-RFL-T power supply, a 63X/1.4 NA oil objective and a 450–490 nm excitation/500–550

 Figure 10. Inhibition of myeloperoxidase abrogates probe oxidation. Addition of myeloperoxidase inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH)
does not inhibit phagocytosis of opsonized E. coli (A) or Zymosan (B), as evidenced by flow cytometry. However, neutrophil-like cells pre-incubated with
ABAH are less capable of oxidizing roGFP2-Orp1 (C), Grx1-roGFP2 (D), or unfused roGFP2 expressed in E. coli (E). Arrows indicate the addition of PLB
985 cells or medium to bacteria.

 camera and the Cell Imaging Software (Olympus) and composite figures were prepared using
ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) and Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) software.
Fluorescence live-cell imaging and ratiometric image processing
Differentiated PLB-958 cells were stained with 0.25 mM Celltracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific, USA) in RPMI 1680 at 37˚C and 5% CO2 for 30 min, washed once with PBS and diluted in PBS
with 0.5% FBS to a final concentration of 107 cells. mL�1. 1 mL of the cell suspension was poured
onto an imaging dish (m-Dish 35 mm, high, Ibidi, DE). Opsonized roGFP2-Orp1 E. coli cells were
added with a ratio of five E. coli cells to one PLB-958 cell. Fluorescence images were acquired with
an LSM 880 ELYRA PS.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). Images were
acquired in three different channels: channel I: Ex405nm/Em513nm, channel II: Ex488nm/Em513nm, chan-
nel III: Ex561nm/Em674nm, bandwidth settings channels I and II: 13 nm, channel III: 59 nm. Individual
single channel images were exported using ZEN 2.1 (Zeiss, DE). Ratiometric images were generated
with ImageJ 1.51e (National Institutes of Health, USA) as described (Collins, 2007). The image back-
ground was corrected using a rolling ball algorithm and images were transferred to 32-bit format.
Images were thresholded and converted to binary mask. Images from channel I and channel II were
aligned using the ImageJ plugin „MultiStackReg“ and ratiometric images were calculated using
„Ratio Plus“. Ratiometric images were colored using the „Lookup table“ feature from the plugin
„NucMed“. The display range of all ratiometric images were adjusted to the same range before con-
verting them into RGB format. For the ratiometric time series assembly, images were smoothed in
order to reduce noise. After background subtraction, normalized 405/488 nm ratio image series
were calculated and assembled to a movie using Software kindly provided by Fricker (2016).
DCFH oxidation assay
Intracellular oxidation of 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) to 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF)
by PLB-985 cells was analyzed using the cell permeable derivative 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein

 diacetate (DCFH-DA). PLB-985 cells (107. mL�1) were pre-incubated with 1.25 mM DCFH-DA (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS with 0.5% FBS during 15 min at 37˚C. Then 50 mL were placed
in the wells of a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate (Nunc). Fluorescence intensity was recorded every
1 min for 10 min using the Synergy H1 multi-detection microplate reader (Biotek) at an excitation
wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. Cells were then activated by addition
of 50 ng � mL�1 phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) or incubation with 10-fold
excess of E. coli bacteria. Fluorescence intensity was then recorded every 1 min for 1 hr.
Myeloperoxidase inhibition
Myeloperoxidase activity in neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells was inhibited by pre-incubation of cells with
500 mM 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37˚C prior to subse-
quent experiments.
Data analysis
All 96-well-plate-based fluorescence measurement experiments were repeated at least three times
with biologically independent replicates and the results are expressed as the mean ±standard devia-
tion as represented by error bars. Representative data is shown for fluorescence spectroscopy, flow
cytometry and microscopy image data.
