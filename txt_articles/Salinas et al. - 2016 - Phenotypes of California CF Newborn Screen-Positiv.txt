Background: At the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (IVS8)-(TG)m(T)n
locus, a lower number of thymidines (legacy names 9T vs. 7T vs. 5T) and a higher number of (TG) repeats (TG-
11 vs. 12 vs. 13) are associated with decreasing translation of functional CFTR protein in vitro. Methods:
Retrospective cohort study comparing phenotypes of California CF newborn screen-positive children (followed
2–8 years) who had two CF-causing mutations (diagnosed as CF) with those who had one mutation from a panel
of 40 CF-causing mutations (CF40mut) and one (IVS8)-(TG)11, 12, or 13-5T mutation detected by sequencing
(diagnosed as CFTR-related metabolic syndrome [cRMS]). Results: The study included 428 children, of which
234 had two CF-causing mutations, and were used to compare with the other 194 children with one CF-causing
mutation and one isolated 5T allele [CF40mut/(TG)13-5T = 21, CF40mut/(TG)12-5T = 85, and CF40mut/(TG)11-
5T = 88]. Among children with CF40mut/(TG)13-5T, 38% were diagnosed with CF by 8 years, based on sweat
chloride results and clinical presentation. Six percent of those with CF40mut/(TG)12-5T, and none with
CF40mut/(TG)11-5T, reached diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: CFTR (IVS8)-(TG)m-5T allele (TG) tract length
determination provides valuable information in predicting the risk of developing a CF phenotype. Of the three
types of 5T alleles evaluated, screen-positive children with genotype CF40mut/(TG)13-5T progressed from
CRMS to CF at a high rate, while there was little evidence of clinical disease in those with CF40mut/(TG)11-5T.
Additional data from longer follow-up intervals are needed to fully understand the natural history of individuals
with a CF40mut/(TG)m-5T genotype.
Introduction
C
ystic fibrosis (CF) phenotypes vary from severe,
progressive pulmonary disease with pancreatic insuffi-
ciency (PI) to mild pulmonary disease with pancreatic suf-
ficiency (PS) depending on many factors such as gene
modifiers, the environment, the CF transmembrane conduc-
tance regulator (CFTR) genotype, and the level of residual
chloride channel function (Noone et al., 2000; Cutting,
2010). Some CFTR mutations, including the (IVS8)-(TG)m-
(5T) allele, are associated with phenotypes that are either
mild or present as single organ disease with nonapparent lung
disease, referred to as CFTR-related disorders (Bombieri
et al., 2011).
The (IVS8)-(TG)m-(5T) allele is carried by *10% of the
general population, and it can be inherited by itself or less
commonly as part of a complex CFTR allele such as R117H.
When in cis with the CFTR R117H allele, R117H penetrance
is increased leading to severe lung disease, but often PS
(Kiesewetter et al., 1993; Zielenski et al., 1995). The Clinical
and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) mutation da-
tabase (www.cftr2.org) lists each (IVS8)-(TG)m-(5T) allele
as a ‘‘mutation of varying clinical consequence,’’ which
means that one of these alleles in trans with a CF-causing
mutation may be associated with a phenotype ranging from
normal to severe (Sosnay et al., 2013). Our current clinical
experience is insufficient to accurately predict the phenotypic
risks associated with these alleles.
This study aims to understand IVS8-5T allele penetrance,
as a function of the adjacent TG repeats length, by following
a population of newborns identified by the California CF
newborn screening (NBS) program, which conducts DNA

 sequencing on newborn blood spots with a single copy of one
of 40 CF-causing mutations. An earlier California CF NBS
study reported that sweat chloride (SC) and immunoreactive
trypsinogen (IRT) concentrations increased in newborns with
F508del/(TG)m-5T as ‘‘m’’ increased from 11 to 13 (Keiles
et al., 2012). We previously reported on 57 subjects carrying
one CF-causing mutation in trans with one or more non-CF-
causing mutations (Salinas et al., 2015). This work expands
the study population size and follow-up duration of the earlier
studies, and focuses on clinical characteristics and risk of CF
diagnosis by age 8. Description of the natural history of
children in the IVS8-5T subcohort is the focus of this study.
Methods
We used follow-up data retrospectively to describe the nat-
ural history of CF NBS-positive newborns identified in the first
4 years of the program. With the California CF NBS algorithm,
hypertrypsinogenemic newborns (top 1.6%) are considered
screen positive either when two CFTR mutations are detected
by a panel of 40 CF-causing mutations (CF40mut) or 1 by the
panel and ‡1 by subsequent DNA sequencing (Kharrazi et al.,
2015). If on sequencing CFTR (IVS8)-(TG)m-(T)n, poly T
status revealed a 5T, TG tract length was reported (Strom et al.,
2003; Kammesheidt et al., 2006; Keiles et al., 2012).
Screen-positive infants (considered to potentially have CF,
CFTR-related metabolic syndrome [CRMS], or to be CF
carriers) were referred to one of 16 California CF centers for
diagnostic confirmation, follow-up, and treatment using CF
Foundation guidelines (Borowitz et al., 2009). Laboratory
and clinical data were entered into the state’s centralized
web-based database for the initial assessment visits (first 6–
12 months of life) until a diagnosis of CF, CRMS, or CF
carrier was established and yearly thereafter for CF and
CRMS patients. Infants were categorized as CRMS if they (1)
had at least two CFTR mutations identified by screening, in
which at least one was not classified as CF causing by
CFTR2; (2) were asymptomatic; and (3) had an SC <60 mM
beyond 6 months of age (Borowitz et al., 2009). A CF di-
agnosis was given to infants who had (1) at least one SC
‡60 mM; and/or (2) two CF-causing mutations based on the
CFTR2 classification. All infants with initial SC <60 mM had
a repeat SC test and parental DNA testing to confirm phasing
(routinely since July 2011). Personal identifiers were re-
moved and data were analyzed at Children’s Hospital Los
Angeles (CHLA). The CHLA Institutional Review Board and
the California Health and Human Services Agency Com-
mittee for the Protection of Human Subjects approved the
study and waived informed consent.
The study population was derived from all CF NBS-
positive children (n = 848) identified from 2,172,002 births
from July 16th, 2007 to July 31st, 2011. The children were
followed for 2–6 years with clinical data collected until
August 1st, 2013 (initial follow-up period). Those with
(IVS8)-(TG)m-5T were stratified into three TG repeat length
groups: (IVS8)-(TG)13-5T, (IVS8)-(TG)12-5T, and (IVS8)-
(TG)11-5T. Children with (IVS8)-(TG)m-5T known to be
part of complex alleles [such as R117H/(TG)m-5T and
F311del/1525-42G>A/(TG)12-5T] were excluded. Children
with two CF-causing mutations and a CF diagnosis were
included for phenotypic comparison. A supplementary set of
analyses were conducted comparing the subgroup of CF
NBS-positive F508del homozygous children to those with
genotype F508del/(IVS8)-(TG)m-5T stratified by TG repeat
length. Lost to follow-up was defined as no medical visit for
‡18 months.
SC, PI/PS status, growth parameters, rate of first acqui-
sition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the first year of life,
and persistent colonization with P. aeruginosa were com-
pared among the four genotype groups [CF40mut/CF-causing,
CF40mut/(TG)13-5T,
CF40mut/(TG)12-5T,
and
CF40mut/
(TG)11-5T].
SC test
Infants with initial negative SC (<60 mM) had repeat
testing at *6, 12, and 24 months and later if indicated and the
highest value documented.
PI/PS status
Pancreatic status was based on the most recent fecal
elastase (FE) value as PI if FE <200 mg/g (Farrell et al., 2008).
In the 31% of children missing FE values, pancreatic status
was assigned based on use of pancreatic replacement en-
zymes, as previously described (Sosnay et al., 2013).
Growth
Growth through 12 months was assessed based on weight
for height z-scores (WHZ; CDC growth curves from year
2000) for children with a minimum of three growth mea-
surements using all available measurements from each sub-
ject to estimate the best fitting curve for each genotype group.
P. aeruginosa status
To assess P. aeruginosa colonization, we documented any
positive culture, age at first acquisition in the first year of life,
and persistence of colonization. Cultures were obtained
during clinic visits by deep throat swabs (Borowitz et al.,
2009). Persistent colonization was defined by modified
LEEDS criteria: (1) mucoid type, ever; and (2) at least two
positive cultures within 12 months (Lee et al., 2003; Pressler
et al., 2011). Unknown was used for those with missing data
(fewer than two collected cultures per year and/or fewer than
2 years of follow-up).
Clinical diagnosis
Final clinical diagnosis for all (IVS8)-(TG)m-5T subjects
was obtained directly from California CF care centers in
November 2015, *2 years beyond the initial data collection
(additional follow-up period; 4–8 years of follow-up). CF
clinicians justified the final diagnosis based on SC, micro-
biology, symptoms, overall clinical course, and imaging
reports.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons among the four genotype groups on demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics were made with ANOVA
or Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests for continuous variables and
chi-square tests for categorical variables. Longitudinal growth
data (WHZ) during the first year of life were analyzed using
repeated measures mixed models to fit quadratic curves for
each group, with CF further divided into PI and PS. Dunnett’s

 post hoc comparisons of least squares estimated means were
made with CF-PS children as the reference group. A similar
approach was used to analyze sequential SC data, fitting linear
curves for each group, with post hoc Tukey-adjusted contrasts
for pairwise comparisons of intercepts and slopes. Time to first
positive culture for P. aeruginosa during the first year of life
was analyzed with the Kaplan–Meier method and groups
compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multiple lo-
gistic regression analyses assessed the significance of initial
clinical characteristics on CF diagnosis within 8 years. For this
analysis, initial SC and IRT were dichotomized at levels as-
sociated with CF diagnosis. (TG)11-5T subjects were ex-
cluded as none were diagnosed with CF. Statistical analysis
was performed with SAS/STAT� v9.2 software. Statistical
tests were two sided with a Type I error of p < 0.05.
Results
Population
Of 32,818 hypertrysinogenemic newborns, 848 were con-
sidered to be California CF NBS positive. Within this group, we
excluded those identified with (1) mutations in cis, (2) CF40mut
and a mutation of varying clinical consequence, unknown dis-
ease liability, or non-CF causing, (3) CF40mut/R117H/(TG)m-
5T (n=5 of a total of 27 with CF40mut/R117H, which corre-
sponded to 3% of all CF NBS positives), and (4) CF40mut/
(TG)m-5T as part of a complex allele (n = 52: 6%). Four
hundred twenty eight individuals were analyzed [CF=
234, CF40mut/(TG)13-5T= 21, CF40mut/(TG)12-5T=85, and
CF40mut/(TG)11-5T = 88]

The
total
prevalence
of
CF40mut/(TG)m-5T was 194 or 23% of all CF NBS positives,
with 2.5% (TG)13-5T, 10% (TG)12-5T, and 10% (TG)11-5T.
Compared to the CF group, CF40mut/(TG)m-5T children
were more likely to be female ( p = 0.0002), have a higher
mean birth weight ( p < 0.0001), have a lower mean IRT
( p < 0.0001), and have a higher lost to follow-up rate
( p < 0.0001). The CF40mut/(TG)13-5T group had more His-
panics than the CF group ( p = 0.02; Table 1), while the
CF40mut/(TG)11-5T group had fewer ( p = 0.0001; Table 1).
Sweat chloride
No infants in the CF40mut/(TG)13, 12, and 11-5T subgroups
had an initial SC value of ‡60mM. Maximum SC values were
higher in CF40mut/(TG)13-5T compared with CF40mut/
(TG)12-5T and CF40mut/11(TG)-5T children ( p = 0.0001,
Table 1). Mixed model analysis of SC results among TG 11,
12, and 13 subgroups, using a linear fit, showed that SC was
significantly related to both increasing age ( p < 0.0001) and
TG repeat length ( p < 0.0001). CF40mut/(TG)13-5T had the
highest starting point (a) and the highest rate (b) of increase in
SC (Fig. 1). During the first six study years in CF40mut/
(TG)12-5T children, none had a maximum SC ‡60mM, while
33% had an intermediate range of SC (30–59mM). Among
CF40mut/(TG)13-5T children, 15% had maximum SC ‡60mM
and 45% had an intermediate SC (Table 1).
PI/PS status
No CF40mut/(TG)m-5T subjects had meconium ileus at
birth or PI detected during their follow-up periods (Table 1).
Growth
Growth analysis in the first 12 months showed a significant
difference in WHZ scores between CF-PS and CF-PI children
( p = 0.03), but no significant difference between CF-PS and
(TG)13-5T: p = 0.89, (TG)12-5T: p = 0.97, and (TG)11-5T:
p = 0.87 groups (Fig. 2). Secondary WHZ analyses showed
significant birth weight effect ( p = 0.004), but no independent
effect of gender ( p = 0.74) or race/ethnicity (Hispanic vs. all
others, p = 0.19). Adjustment for birth weight did not alter the
comparisons between CF-PS and the other subgroups [CF-PS
vs. CF-PI: p = 0.03; vs. (TG)13-5T: p = 0.85, (TG)12-5T:
p = 0.99, and (TG)11-5T: p = 0.73].
P. aeruginosa
First detection of P. aeruginosa in a respiratory culture was
assessed through age of 12 months. The probability of ac-
quiring P. aeruginosa was higher among CF40mut/(TG)13-5T
compared with CF40mut/CF-causing mutation children (25%
vs. 18%, p = 0.0498), CF40mut/(TG)12-5T (0%; p = 0.0006),
and CF40mut/(TG)11-5T (4%; p = 0.0033) (Table 1 and Sup-
plementary Fig. S4). There was a higher chronic coloniza-
tion rate in the CF40mut/TG)13-5T compared with CF40mut/
(TG)12-5T and CF40mut/(TG)11-5T groups (no statistical
analyses due to missing data; Table 1).
Clinical diagnosis of CF
2 years beyond the initial data collection, three additional
CF40mut/(TG)13-5T and two CF40mut/(TG)12-5T children
had increased SC, such that final prevalence of SC ‡60 mM
was 29% (18%, 52%) (95% CI) and 2% (0%, 8%), respec-
tively, in 4–8 years of follow-up (additional follow-up data).

(TG)M-5T PHENOTYPES IN CF SCREEN POSITIVES
499
 As of November 2015 (age 4–8 years), 8/21 (38%) (18%,
62%) of CF40mut/(TG)13-5T, 5/85 (6%) (2%, 13%) of
CF40mut/(TG)12-5T, and 0/88 (0%) (0%, 4%) of the
CF40mut/(TG)11-5T children had been converted from the
CRMS category to a CF diagnosis. Mean age at CF diagnosis
was similar in both (TG)13-5T and (TG)12-5T subgroups
(27 – 24 months). Of the 13 subjects ultimately diagnosed
with CF, 5 (38%) were based on clinical justifications alone
(e.g., chronic respiratory symptoms, abnormal chest x-ray;
Tables 2 and 3).
F508del subanalyses: 61% of CF40mut/(TG)m-5T children
carried F508del as the CF40mut. Subanalyses were performed
comparing phenotypes of children with F508del/(TG)13,
12, and 11-5T subgroups to F508del homozygous chil-
dren with results similar to the whole CF40mut/(TG)m-5T
cohort (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 and Supplementary
Figs. S2, S3 and S5).
Logistic regression probing the association between initial
clinical characteristics and CF diagnosis within 8 years
among children with CF40mut/(TG)13 or 12-5T mutations
suggests that a CF diagnosis was more likely [OR (95% CI),
p] for (1) (TG)13-5T relative to (TG)12-5T [20.7 (5.9–72.3),
p < 0.0001]; (2) an IRT >80 ng/mL [6.1 (1.3–28.2), p = 0.02];
(3) an initial SC ‡25mM [6.3 (1.9–21.4), p = 0.003]; or (4) a
Hispanic ethnicity [5.2 (1.5–17.5), p = 0.01]. Gender and P.
aeruginosa were not predictors of a CF diagnosis. A stepwise
multivariate logistic regression analysis among CF40mut/
(TG)13-5T and CF40mut/(TG)12-5T subjects showed that IRT
>80ng/mL and CF40mut/(TG)13-5T genotype were indepen-
dent predictors of a CF diagnosis [adjusted OR 15.4 (1.7–
142.9), p = 0.01 and 10.4 (2.4–43.5) p = 0.001], respectively.
The small number of CF diagnoses among CF40mut/(TG)-5T
subjects limited further additions to the multivariate model.

squares), CF40mut/(TG)12-5T (n = 64, open upward trian-
gles), and CF40mut/11(TG)-5T (n = 36, black downward
triangles). Children with <3 growth measurements were ex-
cluded. There was a statistically significant difference be-
tween CF-PS and CF-PI ( p = 0.03), while there was no
statistically significant difference between CF-PS and indi-
vidual 5T subgroups [vs. (TG)13 p = 0.89, vs. (TG)12 p = 0.97,
and 11(TG) p = 0.87]. Secondary WHZ analyses showed sig-
nificant birth weight effect ( p = 0.004) and no independent
effect of gender ( p = 0.74) or race/ethnicity (Hispanic vs. all
others, p = 0.15). Adjustment for birth weight did not alter the
comparisons between CF-PS and the other subgroups [CF-PS
vs. CF-PI: p = 0.03; vs. (TG)13: p = 0.89, (TG)12: p = 0.99,
and (TG)11: p = 0.73]. PS, pancreatic sufficient.

 Discussion
We clinically followed a large cohort of children with
genotype CF40mut/(IVS8)-(TG)m-5T, identified through the
California CF NBS IRT/DNA/DNA sequencing three-step
screening algorithm. Variations in phenotype and eventual
CF diagnosis were associated with different (TG) repeat
lengths adjacent to the poly-T tract at the CFTR (IVS8)-
(TG)m-5T locus. The 106 subjects with genotypes CF40mut/
(TG)13-5T or CF40mut/(TG)12-5T together represented
12.5% of all California CF NBS-positive newborns. After 8
years of follow-up, by an average age of 27 months, 12%
were considered to have CF. The percentage of screen posi-
tives detected to have genotypes, including a 5T allele, would
be lower in populations screened by standard IRT/DNA al-
gorithms (Parad and Comeau, 2005).
Our results support prior in vitro studies of (TG) 11, 12,
and 13. Exon 9 splice efficiency, studied in cultured nasal
epithelial cells and a CFTR minigene system, revealed exon
9+ transcripts in 82%, 61%, and 54% with (TG)11, 12, and 13,
respectively, confirming that exon 9 splicing efficiency de-
creased as the number of TG repeats increased (Hefferon
et al., 2004). A classical CF diagnosis has been described in
both late-diagnosed patients with genotype CF-causing muta-
tion/(IVS8)-(TG)13-5T and (TG)12-5T and (IVS8)-(TG)m-5T
homozygotes. (TG)11-5T is more commonly seen in individ-
uals with CFTR-related disorders such as congenital bilateral
absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) or pancreatitis, and in-
frequently inpatients with a CF diagnosis(Cuppens et al., 1998;
Noone et al., 2000; Hefferon et al., 2004; Farrell et al., 2008).
Our findings support those reported by Groman et al. in which
134 individuals with a genotype of CF-causing mutation/5T
were evaluated for phenotype and TG repeat length.Ninety-one
percent (97/107) of symptomatic individuals (CBAVD or
‘‘nonclassic’’ CF) had a 5T allele associated with (TG)12 and
13-5T, while among asymptomatic individuals, 78% (21/27)
had a 5T allele associated with (TG)11-5T. They concluded
that determination of TG repeat number provided more ac-
curate prediction of 5T allele pathogenicity (Groman et al.,
2004).
An SC concentration ‡60 mM is considered diagnostic for
CF (Farrell et al., 2008). The SC test is less sensitive and less
specific in reliably identifying CFTR dysfunction in indi-
viduals with nonclassical presentations (Groman et al., 2005)
(Stewart et al., 1995; Quinton et al., 2012). In our study, 38%
of those ultimately diagnosed with CF had initial SC between
20 and 30 mM. CF40mut/(TG)13-5T and CF40mut/(TG)12-5T
had the steepest rate of rise of SC in the first 6 years of life,
while SC rise in (TG)11-5T children was closer to the
*1 mM /year increase described in healthy 5–10-year-old
children (Mishra et al., 2008).
All CF40mut/(TG)m-5T subgroups and CF-PS children had
normal growth, as assessed by WHZ. Pancreatic status, not
genotype, was associated with growth patterns. That all
CF40mut/(TG)m-5T subjects were PS is consistent with current
observations in CF-causing mutation/(IVS8)-(TG)m-5T
cohorts, which is that this genotype is characteristically
linked to a milder form of CF and prolonged survival
(Hodson et al., 2008).
Higher than normal rates of P. aeruginosa colonization
(Carlson et al., 2009; Rosenfeld et al., 2012) among CF40mut/
(TG)13-5T relative to CF40mut/(TG)12-5T and CF40mut/
(TG)11-5T children may be explained by a marginal quantity
of functional CFTR that leads to an altered milieu on the
respiratory epithelial surface, but it is not clear why this rate
is higher than those children with two CF-causing mutations.
As previously described in a population with atypical CF
presentation, P. aeruginosa infection was more likely among
individuals with a higher SC and two CFTR mutations
(Groman et al., 2005). While P. aeruginosa may rarely be
detected among CFTR mutation carriers and healthy infants,
it is generally a hallmark of the presence of CFTR dysfunc-
tion (Groman et al., 2005; Carlson et al., 2009; Rosenfeld
et al., 2012).

(TG)M-5T PHENOTYPES IN CF SCREEN POSITIVES
501
 The results of our study are important for clinicians. Over a
third of children with a positive CF NBS and genotype
CF40mut/(TG)13-5T were diagnosed with CF by age 8. These
infants may appear normal at birth and have normal SC on
initial testing. Thus, families of these patients need to be
counseled carefully that their children have a significant risk of
developing CF, and close follow-up is recommended. Al-
though limited to a small number of CF diagnoses, our logistic
regression analysis should remind clinicians that infants with
genotype CF40mut/(TG)13-5T and IRT >80ng/mL must be
followed closely. Because only 6% of CF40mut/(TG)12-5T
infants and no CF40mut/(TG)11-5T infants developed clinical
CF by age 8, parents may be counseled that early aggressive
follow-up is not required. Because data are inadequate on later
outcomes, pediatricians and families might be informed to
consider evaluation by a CF specialist, should chronic ab-
dominal or respiratory symptoms develop. Maintaining con-
tact with (TG)12-5T families is important, either by yearly CF
center clinic visits or through the primary care physician.
Differing lost to follow-up rates were observed among
CF40mut (TG)m-5T subgroups, raising the possibility of se-
lection bias. Because late development of symptoms would
presumably prompt families to return to a CF center for care,
impact of this bias on our main findings is likely small. Given
the benign clinical picture observed on follow-up, a decision
was made by the California CF NBS consortium to discharge
CF40mut/(TG)11-5T children from CF center follow-up after
July 1st, 2011. Since that date, (IVS8)-(TG)11-5T, if not part
of a complex allele, was no longer reported as CF NBS
positive. Longer follow-up is required to quantify the risk of
CBAVD, pancreatitis, bronchitis, and other late-onset CFTR-
related disorders in these individuals.
Other study limitations include the following: missing
data, the retrospective design, the web-based system de-
signed by the screening program to evaluate performance
(not clinical research), and a short follow-up period to fully
understand mutation penetrance.
Mutation panels used by many NBS programs were de-
signed for adult carrier screening. ACMG guidelines de-
signed direct detection of 5T only reflexly if the R117H
mutation is detected. CFTR (IVS8)-(TG)12 and 13-5T are
prevalent mutations that can result in CF outside of the usual
period of time that initial SC testing is performed. As these
mutations are not part of commonly used IRT/DNA mutation
panels, programs will misclassify a portion of CF NBS-
positive infants with one mutation and an initial SC <30 as CF
carriers. Our data support the addition of reflex CFTR
(IVS8)-(TG)12 and 13-5T mutation testing after one CF-
causing mutation is identified through CF NBS.
In conclusion, CF was ultimately diagnosed in about one
third of CF NBS positives with genotype CF40mut/(TG)13-
5T. Screen-positive children with genotype CF40mut/(TG)12-
5T also progressed from CRMS to CF, but at a lower rate.
There was little evidence of clinical disease in CF40mut/
(TG)11-5T children followed for 4–8 years. It is important to
determine the length of the (TG) repeat tract in children
identified with a CFTR (IVS8)-(TG)m-5T allele as one of two
CFTR mutations identified through either CF NBS or diag-
nostic testing of symptomatic individuals to better understand
the risk of developing disease. Long-term follow-up and
additional CFTR functional assays (such as nasal potential
difference and intestinal current measurements) should be
considered for screen positives carrying a CF-causing mu-
tation with a (TG)12 or 13-5T.
