Wound complications in total hip and 
knee arthroplasty can lead to deep pros-
thetic infection, management of which can 
be difficult, expensive and with potential 
for disastrous outcomes.

several factors such as wound healing, 
prolonged wound discharge, early dis-
charge from hospital and management 
superficial wound complications influence 
the outcome.

dressings may be a reasonable way of 
achieving improved predictability and 
safety in wound healing following hip 
and knee arthroplasty surgery.

Incisional negative pressure wound ther-
apy dressing appears to predictably 
improve wound discharge, wound heal-
ing, minimise wound complications and 
improve length of stay following routine 
hip and knee arthroplasties.
Incisional negative pressure wound 
therapy dressings (inpWTd) in routine 
primary hip and knee arthroplasties
A RANdomIsed coNtRolled tRIAl
Objectives
Wound complications are reported in up to 10% hip and knee arthroplasties and there is 
a proven association between wound complications and deep prosthetic infections. In this 
randomised controlled trial (RcT) we explore the potential benefits of a portable, single use, 
incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressing (inpWTd) on wound exudate, length 
of stay (Los), wound complications, dressing changes and cost-effectiveness following total 
hip and knee arthroplasties.
Methods
A total of 220 patients undergoing elective primary total hip and knee arthroplasties were 
recruited into in a non-blinded RcT. For the final analysis there were 102 patients in the 
study group and 107 in the control group.
Results
An improvement was seen in the study (inpWTd) group compared to control in all areas. 
peak post-surgical wound exudate was significantly reduced (p = 0.007). overall Los reduc-
tion (0.9 days, 95% confidence interval (cI) -0.2 to 2.5) was not significant (p = 0.07) but 
there was a significant reduction in patients with extreme values of Los in the inpWTd group 
(Moses test, p = 0.003). There was a significantly reduced number of dressing changes 
(mean difference 1.7, 95% cI 0.8 to 2.5, p = 0.002), and a trend to a significant four-fold 
reduction in reported post-operative surgical wound complications (8.4% control; 2.0% 
inpWTd, p = 0.06).
Conclusions
Based on the results of this RcT incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressings have 
a beneficial role in patients undergoing primary hip and knee arthroplasty to achieve pre-
dictable length of stay, especially to eliminate excessive hospital stay, and minimise wound 
complications.

IncIsIonal negatIve pressure wound therapy dressIngs (Inpwtd) In routIne prImary hIp and knee arthroplastIes
Bone & JoInt research
 

these dressings appear to be particularly beneficial in 
patients with an American society of Anesthesiologists 
grade ⩾ 3 and a body mass index ⩾ 35 in reducing 
wound complications. the additional cost of these 
dressings is perhaps justifiable taking in to account all 
of these factors.
strengths and limitations
 

this is a very first randomised controlled trial studying 
the effects of an innovative wound dressing using the 
beneficial aspects of negative pressure wound ther-
apy in primary hip and knee arthoplasty, without 
compromising early post-operative mobilisation.
 

the limitations of this study being; this is a non-
blinded study, the routine practice of changing 
wound dressings at the second day post-surgery and 
working towards expected date of discharge (four 
days post-surgery at the time of study period) was dif-
ficult to control, and the incidence of surgical wound 
complications were recorded rather than directly 
inspected.
Introduction
total hip and knee arthroplasties (tHA, tKA) are two of 
the most successful and predictable orthopaedic proce-
dures. Although life changing,1 they can be associated 
with serious complications, sometimes with devastating 
consequences. Prolonged incisional wound drainage has 
been correlated with superficial surgical site and deep 
prosthetic infection.2-5 Incidence of post-operative 
wound complications is influenced by diabetes, obesity, 
quality of soft tissues, use of steroids, soft-tissue han-
dling, and duration and complexity of surgery.6-8 
evidence is sparse regarding nutrition and wound 
 
healing.9 united Kingdom surgical site infection (ssI) sur-
veillance data indicate that higher body mass index (BmI), 
longer duration of surgery and higher American society 
of Anesthesiologists (AsA) grading increase the incidence 
of ssI in hip arthroplasties. For knee arthroplasties, on the 
other hand, it has been shown that female gender, as 
opposed to BmI, increases the incidence of ssI.10-12
With the changing economics in health care, length of 
stay (los) is increasingly seen as a preventable expense. 
Adoption of enhanced recovery protocols for hip and 
knee arthroplasties have reduced the los.9,13-16 However, 
early discharge from the hospital has the potential for 
wound complications being managed in the community 
and an increase in readmissions to hospital. this was rec-
ognised by the ssI reports and National Institute for 
Health and care excellence (NIce) publication on ssI 
arthroplasties.10,17 the economic and patient implica-
tions of superficial ssI leading to deep infection are well 
recognised.18-21 therefore it is reasonable to argue that 
‘predictable wound healing’ is a key factor in achieving 
overall ‘predictable outcome’.
the united Kingdom NIce, in a publication on surgical 
site infection,17 highlighted the gap in published evi-
dence on the use of alternate wound dressings for inci-
sional surgical wounds22-25 and suggested that chronic 
wound dressings could be used for surgical incisions to 
minimise the risk of ssI.
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWt) is one such 
potential option. NPWt for chronic wounds was intro-
duced in the early 90s;26,27 its effectiveness in chronic 
wounds, pressure sores and diabetic foot ulcers is well 
established.28-30 over the last ten years the role of NPWt 
has been extended to acute wounds.31,32 Its application 
as a prophylactic measure for incisional wounds, 
although suggested as long ago as 2002 by Webb,33 
remains a novel concept. In a recent review publication,34 
the mechanisms of action of incisional NPWt have been 
attributed to improved blood supply,35-39 reduced lateral 
tension along wound edges,40-42 decrease in oed
ema,26,33,43-46 reduced subcutaneous haematoma and 
seroma,41,47,48 improved lymphatic drainage49 and pre-
vention of wound contamination.43
the routine use of incisional NPWt until recently was 
largely restricted by the size of the apparatus and the 
expertise required in application of the dressing. However, 
with the introduction of smaller battery-operated, ultra-
portable, single-use and disposable NPWt devices and 
ready-made incisional wound dressings,50,51 the concept 
of ‘incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressings’ 
(iNPWtd) has become more feasible. currently there are 
two such devices marketed in the united Kingdom; one 
by Kinetic concepts, Inc. (san Antonio, texas) as Prevena, 
and the other by smith & Nephew Healthcare ltd (Hull, 
united Kingdom) as PIco. Both claim therapeutic effects 
equal to those of the larger traditional devices. PIco is a 
canister-less design with a sandwiched dressing compo-
nent which allows negative pressure to be distributed 
across the skin and uses absorption and vaporisation to 
manage exudate from the wound (Fig. 1).52
With the positive experiences of using these dressings in 
complex revision hip and knee surgery (publication await-
ing), it was hypothesised that iNPWtd could be adopted 
for primary tHAs and tKAs as a means of controlling 
wound exudate levels and therefore influencing the length 
of stay without increasing post discharge complications. A 
randomised controlled trial (Rct) was designed to evalu-
ate iNPWtd effectiveness in patients undergoing primary 
elective hip and knee arthroplasties at our institution.
patients and Methods
the objective of this study was to assess the potential 
benefits of the portable disposable incisional negative 
pressure wound therapy dressing in the setting of routine 
elective tHAs and tKAs. the primary outcome was to 
measure the impact of iNPWtd on wound healing and 
effect on los. the secondary outcomes were assessment 
of wound complications such as prolonged wound

exudate and superficial wound infections, number of 
dressing changes and the overall cost-effectiveness of the 
dressing.
the smith & Nephew PIco dressing was chosen for 
the following reasons: the dressing is versatile with vari-
ous size options, is smaller and has a quieter pump which 
is better tolerated by patients as shown by our clinical 
experience to date.
this was a non-blinded single-centre randomised con-
trolled parallel group study in patients undergoing rou-
tine elective tHAs and tKAs at our elective orthopaedic 
hospital. the study was designed and reported in line 
with the consolidated standards of Reporting trials state-
ment.53 the study was conducted between october 
2012 and october 2013. the study period was from sur-
gery to six week post-operative follow-up. ethical 
approval was obtained from the National Research ethics 
service (NRes committee south West – exeter; Rec No 
12/sW/0094).
three participating surgeons (slK, Nmg and RdB), 
experienced in performing primary and revision hip and 
knee joint arthroplasties took part in the study. All con-
secutive patients undergoing routine tHAs and tKAs (for 
any indication) under these three consultant surgeons 
were approached by the surgeon or his registrar, and will-
ing patients were recruited to the study, provided they 
met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients 
who had known allergies to dressings, were undergoing 
revision joint surgery, were unwilling to attend additional 
clinics, and those on warfarin were excluded. Patients on 
warfarin were excluded primarily because of the antici-
pated extended los to allow their prothrombin time and 
international normalised ratio (INR) to reach therapeutic 
levels before being discharged.
Patient consent and randomisation were undertaken 
by the research team upon admission. the randomisation 
was performed using sealed opaque envelopes with a 
block size of 20 shuffled envelopes with a 1:1 allocation. 
these envelopes were prepared in advance and were 
opened by the research personnel for the recruited 
patient on the day of surgery. the first patient was 
enrolled into the study on 5 october 2012. A total of 220 
patients were recruited into the trial, with 110 in each 
group.
the dressings were applied in theatre immediately 
after the wound closure. the study group received PIco 
NPWt dressings and the control group received conven-
tional dressings: either mepore (mölnlycke Health care 
AB, gothenburg, sweden) or tegaderm (3m Health care 
ltd, loughborough, united Kingdom) as per the sur-
geon’s preferred practice. All patients received 1.5 g of 
cefuroxime antibiotic at induction and one dose post-
surgery. Patients were operated on by either the consult-
ant surgeon or by the trainee under direct supervision. 
Wounds were closed in a layered fashion with skin staples 
or subcuticular monocryl (ethicon Inc., Johnson-Johnson, 
New Brunswick, New Jersey) sutures to close the skin.
For the NPWt group the protocol was to leave the 
dressing in place for a week (design of PIco and pump is 
programmed to last seven days). the control group 
patients had their dressing changed to oPsIte Post-op 
visible dressing (smith & Nephew Healthcare ltd) on the 
second post-operative day as per the usual routine prac-
tice. For both groups the dressing was changed earlier or 
again if there was progressive exudate filling 50% or 
more of the dressing. All patients received enoxaparin 
(clexane; 
sanofi-Aventis, 
Holmes 
chapel, 
united 
Kingdom) post-surgery (four weeks for hips and two 
weeks for knees). In the hospital, patients were seen on a 
daily basis in the morning by the same team of two 
research personnel, in order to minimise errors and main-
tain consistency. the following information was recorded: 
level of wound exudate, any dressing change and rea-
sons, discharge readiness from a wound perspective, los 
and reasons for delay in discharge.
Wound exudate level was graded on a five-point scale 
based on the fraction of the wound length stained by 
exudate as noted on the dressing (table I). the length of 
the dressing was split into four quarters for this measure-
ment. Where there was minimal staining along the length 
of the incision wound, this was assessed as either grade 1 
or 2 based on lateral spread. No standardised-validated 
methodology exists for this assessment, but given the 
essentially one-dimensional nature of the wound, this 
methodology was deemed reasonable for the study. If 
the dressing was changed prior to morning inspection, 
the extent of exudate at the time of dressing change was 
captured as a part of data collection, as was the reason 
for changing the dressing.
From the wound perspective, the patient discharge 
criteria were set at dry dressing or non-progressive mini-
mal staining on the dressing. All patients were subjected 
to an enhanced recovery protocol following surgery, and 
discharged home when medically safe and sufficient 
home/community care was in place.
Post-discharge, all patients were contacted by tele-
phone at two weeks post-surgery, and in addition the

study group were seen in a wound clinic (by the same 
wound care nurse) at one week post-surgery to ensure 
safety with the new dressing and removal of the iNPWtd. 
All patients were seen at six weeks post-surgery in the 
consultant-led follow-up clinic as per routine practice. 
Wound-related complications such as recurrence of 
wound exudate, surgical site infections, dressing-related 
issues, readmission to hospital and any further surgical 
interventions were documented at each encounter by 
the research personnel.
statistical analysis. the exudate level measurements 
were summarised as a single variable by their peak level. 
distributions of all variables were investigated for normal-
ity using Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots, which plot the 
quantiles of a variable against the quantiles of a normal 
distribution with the same mean and standard devia-
tion. Analysis of los was based on the intention to treat 
(Itt) population, whereas analyses of wound properties 
were based on the per protocol (PP) population because 
those outcomes were only collected for this population. 
subanalysis based on stratification by hip or knee surgery 
was performed. mean los of the two groups was ana-
lysed using a non-parametric method specifically devel-
oped for highly skewed data (method t3).54 differences 
in peak wound exudate level and complication rates were 
analysed using Fisher’s exact test. the influence of con-
founding factors was analysed using a logistic regression 
model or a proportional odds logistic model. conditional 
inference trees and model-based recursive partitioning 
were used to find meaningful treatment-subgroup inter-
actions. the sample size was chosen to permit detection 
of a difference in los of 0.6 days, assuming a two-tailed 
significance level of p = 0.05 and 80% power, and based 
on a standard deviation of 1.5 days as found in an ear-
lier study at our institution.55 All statistical analyses were 
performed using R v 3.0.3 (R Foundation for statistical 
software, vienna, Austria) and g*Power v 3.1.3 (university 
of düsseldorf, germany). A two-tailed p-value below 0.05 
was assumed to denote statistical significance.
Results
the Itt population consisted of 108 patients in the con-
trol group (two patients in the control group had their 
surgery cancelled on the day) and 107 patients in the 
study group (two patients in the study group withdrew 
consent after randomisation and a third immediately 
after surgery) (Fig. 2).
the PP population consisted of 107 patients in the 
control group (one further patient received NPWt dress-
ing by error) and 102 in the study group (one further 
patient withdrew two days post-operatively due to prob-
lems with the tubing on dressing, and four further 
patients due to protocol deviations as shown in Fig. 2).
Demographics. Based on the PP population of 209 
patients, there were 116 hip arthroplasties and 93 knee 
arthroplasties. the patient demographics are shown in 
table II. the two groups were well balanced, except for 
the fact that the proportion of patients with a BmI > 35 
in the study group (17%) was twice that in the control 
group (8%). on average, the patients had two of the fol-
lowing comorbidities: BmI > 30 (82), hypertension (76), 
hypercholesterolaemia (32) and diabetes (17).
Wound exudate. the majority of patients, as anticipated 
in a routine primary joint arthroplasty, had grade 0 to 
2 peak level of exudate (Fig. 3, table III). the level and 
number of peak exudates differed significantly between 
the two groups (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.007), with 
more patients in lower grades and fewer patients in 
higher grades in the study group compared with the 
control group. only 4% of the study group had grade 
4 exudate as compared with 16% in the control group, 
a four-fold reduction. the number of patients who had 
grade 3 exudate was small in both groups. the difference 
in peak exudate level between the two groups did not 
depend significantly on the procedure (hip versus knee, 
multinomial regression, interaction term p = 0.38).
two confounding factors, use of drain and skin clo-
sure with staples, influenced wound exudate levels fol-
lowing surgery. drains reduced peak exudate by a factor 
of 5 (grades 3 and 4), and staples reduced the overall 
exudate levels, but not grade 4. the usage of drains and 
skin staples between the two groups was similar (table II).
length of stay. over 50% of the patients were discharged 
within three days of their surgery in both groups. the 
range and spread of los was smaller for the study group 
(one to ten days) as compared with the control group 
(two to 61 days) (table Iv). extreme values for los 
were significantly lower in the study group (moses test, 
p = 0.003).
the mean los for the Itt population was 3.8 days 
(95% (confidence interval) cI 3.5 to 4.2) for the study 
group and 4.7 days (95% cI 3.8 to 6.4) for the control 
group (difference 0.9 days, 95% cI -0.2 to 2.5, p = 0.07). 
this reduction in los, although measurable, was not sta-
tistically significant (table v). the los was not markedly 
different for the PP population. the study group had a 
significantly smaller probability of excess los due to 
wound leakage (odds ratio (oR) 0.11, 95% cI 0.002 to 
0.81, p = 0.02).
the mean los for the control group was strongly 
affected by two outliers, both related to wound compli-
cations. to analyse the sensitivity to these two outliers, 
their los was capped at 13 days (the third shortest los 
 332

in the control group). this reduced the los of the control 
group to 4.1 days (95% cI 3.8 to 4.7) and the difference 
in los to 0.3 days (95% cI -0.16 to 1.0), still shorter for 
the study group (table v). the los was significantly 
affected by several confounding factors such as age, AsA 
grade and drain usage, but also by factors more difficult 
to quantify such as a ward culture of working towards 
expected date of discharge and social factors delaying 
discharge. the influence of these confounding factors 
across the two groups was not significant.
Wound complications. A total of 11 out of 209 (5.2%) 
patients encountered surgical wound-related compli-
cations (table vI) and nine of these were following dis-
charge from the hospital. Wound complications were 
mainly in the control group and in knee arthroplasties. 
therefore, the majority of these complications (9/11) 
were recorded (two-week phone call check) rather than 
directly inspected.
In the control group, nine patients (8.4%) developed 
wound complications following surgery: two as inpatients

IncIsIonal negatIve pressure wound therapy dressIngs (Inpwtd) In routIne prImary hIp and knee arthroplastIes
Bone & JoInt research
(one following knee and one following hip arthroplasty; 
both had prolonged wound exudate and required surgical 
washouts) and seven following discharge from the hospi-
tal. the complications were exudating wounds and the 
majority (7/9) were treated for suspected superficial ssI 
with antibiotics in the community. one other patient was 
re-admitted for pain and stiffness following knee arthro-
plasty and underwent arthroscopic washout.
In the study group, two patients (2.0%) developed 
wound complications following discharge. Both were 
morbidly obese (BmI > 40) and had knee arthroplasties; 
one had been treated with antibiotics by their general 
practitioner for cellulitis. there were no late conse-
quences in either group.
overall there was a four-fold reduction in post-operative 
wound complications (oR 4.0, 95% cI 0.95 to 30, p = 
0.06 Fisher’s exact test) in the study group compared 
with the control group. this difference in incidence of 
wound complications - study group 2% and control 
group 8.4% - was just below statistically significant. 
Recursive-partitioning analysis suggested that iNPWtd 
would be beneficial specifically for patients with an AsA 
grade ⩾ 3 and a BmI ⩾ 35 (p = 0.02 for iNPWtd × group-
membership interaction term). A higher BmI, AsA grade, 
diabetes, smoking/former smoking and skin closure with 
staples were factors that increased the risk of wound 
complications across the two groups (table vII) and the 
spread of these factors was similar across the two groups 
(table II).
the other notable complication was an occurrence of 
blisters in the study group (11%) and the control group 
(1%). Blisters were minor (< 1cm) and seen around the 
composite/adhesive junction of the dressing, about 2 cm 
from the incision and mainly in knee arthroplasties (18%, 
tHA - 3.7%). Blisters were inspected in the study group 
(at one-week wound check) and noted for the control 
group at two weeks phone call check. All patients healed 
without further complications. there was a wide varia-
tion in the occurrence of blisters in the study group 
between three surgeons (surgeon 1: 4% (one tKA, one 
tHA), surgeon 2: 21.2% (six tKA, one tHA) and surgeon 
3: 10.5% (two tKA) and highest for a surgeon who relied 
on the trainee to apply the dressing). Avoiding stretching 
of the dressing and applying to a flexed knee appeared to 
minimise blisters once this was recognised.
Dressing changes. In the study group, the intention was 
to leave on the iNPWt dressing, which was designed to be 
left untouched for a week unless the amount of exudate 
dictated otherwise (exudate filling more than 50% of the 
dressing). For the control group, as per the routine, there 
would be a minimum of one dressing change and fur-
ther changes based on the extent and amount of wound 
exudate (exudate filling more than 50% of the dressing). 
there was a significant reduction in the mean number of 
dressing changes in the study group (2.5 95% cI 2.2 to 
2.8) compared with the control group (4.2 95% cI 3.6 
to 5.2) (p = 0.002; difference 1.7 95% cI 0.8 to 2.5). the

dressing changes in the study group were due to a com-
bination of factors: five were due to excessive wound exu-
date, others were device-related and a further unintended 
few were as a result of routine practice in the ward.
Cost effectiveness. there is a cost factor associated with 
iNPWtd; PIco seven-day treatment systems are marketed 
at £125, substantially more expensive than the traditional 
wound dressing. taking into account reduced los for the 
study group (£275 per day hospital bed),56 fewer wound 
complications, fewer dressing changes (nurse time) and 
potential cost savings for wound care in the community 
due to reduced number of wound complications in the 
study group, the additional cost of the iNPWtd appears 
justifiable; however, we accept that a detailed analysis of 
financial modelling is required and a more detailed analy-
sis will be the subject of a future publication.
overall, the iNPWtd was easy to apply and well toler-
ated by patients. there were a few device-related issues: 
one pump failure and ten suction tube disconnections 
from dressing or the pump due to the long tube getting 
in the way whilst changing clothes and mobilising. eight 
additional patients required re-application of the iNPWtd 
as a result of loss of vacuum, unrelated to the dressing. 
the PIco NPWt system is supplied with one pump and 
two separately packed dressings. the second dressing 
was used in 25% of patients.
Discussion
during 2013 and 2014, nearly 200 000 hip and knee 
arthroplasties were performed in the united Kingdom 
and the proportion of patients with higher AsA and BmI 
undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty has increased over 
the years.57 Post-discharge wound complication rates 
reported by patients via PRoms (patient-reported out-
come measures) are much higher (10% of hip arthroplas-
ties and 13% of knee arthroplasties)57 than those 
recognised by ssI reports.11,12 considering both data do 
not represent the whole population, the realistic ssI is 
probably somewhere in between.
management of wound complications in the commu-
nity can be variable. eventual complications such as deep 
prosthetic infection requiring revision surgery are not 
only devastating to the patient, but are also a negative 
performance indicator for the treating surgeon. National 
joint registries in most countries now collect this informa-
tion against the surgeon. therefore it is not surprising 
that surgeons prefer to keep patients in hospital until the 
wound is dry to minimise post-discharge complications, 
which can be a limiting factor for a timely discharge from 
hospital. consequently it is reasonable to argue that 
there is a need for a predictable way of managing surgical 
wounds following joint arthroplasties, and portable 
iNPWtd may be a way of achieving this.
In this first Rct studying the effects of iNPWtd on 
wound healing in primary hip and knee arthroplasties, 
we found improvements in all of the areas we set out to 
assess. Wound exudates were significantly lower in the 
study group (p = 0.007). this was particularly the case 
for grade-4 exudate, where there was a four-fold reduc-
tion for the study group. there was a reduction in los for 
the study group (0.9 days, 95% cI -0.1 to 2.5, p = 0.07). 
Although this reduction was influenced by the two out-
lier patients, both patients had in fact remained longer in 
hospital for wound-related complications and subse-
quent treatment. even when capped at 13 days the dif-
ference in los was still shorter for the study group 
patients. Further analysis also indicates that the extreme 
values for los are significantly improved by iNPWtd 
(moses test, p = 0.003), suggesting a better predictabil-
ity in los with iNPWtd. there was a four-fold reduction 
in post-operative wound-related complications (oR 4.0, 
95% cI 0.95 to 30), although this did not reach statistical

significance (p = 0.06). two of the patients in the control 
group had persistent wound exudate and required for-
mal surgical washouts resulting in excessive los; this 
was not seen in the study group. Accepting that the com-
plications noted in the community were recorded rather 
than inspected complications, these were again mainly in 
the control group, indicating better wound healing with 
iNPWtd. our analyses also suggested that iNPWtd would 
be beneficial specifically for patients with an AsA ⩾ 3 and 
a BmI ⩾ 35 in reducing wound complications. As 
expected, there was a reduction in requirement for dress-
ing changes (p = 0.002).the cost of iNPWtd is perhaps 
justifiable if one were to take into account the additional 
cost incurred due to increased wound complications, 
increased dressing changes and resultant increase in los 
in the control group.
there are a number of limitations to this study: a) this 
was a non-blinded study, given the obvious difference 
between the two dressings, both to research personnel as 
well as to the clinician; b) the routine practice of changing 
wound dressings at second day post-surgery and working 
towards expected date of discharge (four days post-sur-
gery at the time of study period) was difficult to control, 
due to the number of nursing staff involved in patient 
care; c) the incidence of surgical wound complications 
was recorded rather than directly inspected as the infor-
mation was obtained over telephone at the two-week 
 
telephone check; d) wound-related data were not col-
lected following protocol failure, which meant an Itt 
analysis was only possible for los; and finally, e) we were 
unable to standardise the wound closure methodology, 
as this would have meant changing surgeons’ practice.
skin staples have been implicated in the increased risk 
of wound complications.58,59 An Rct looking at this spe-
cifically in hip and knee arthroplasties reports otherwise.60 
In this study, wound closure with skin staples was a con-
founding factor for wound complications, as was knee 
arthroplasty as opposed to hip arthroplasty, AsA ⩾ 3 and

BmI ⩾ 35 (table vII). on the other hand, interestingly, 
wound complications were far lower in the study group 
despite the higher usage of skin staples as compared with 
the control group (table II). two patients in the study 
group who had wound complications had a BmI of > 40 
and had knee arthroplasties. the choice for skin staples for 
surgeons with mixed practice was influenced by the qual-
ity of the skin (poor or thin skin not amenable to subcu-
ticular suture). Additionally, there were twice as many 
patients with BmI ⩾ 35 in the study group. therefore, 
iNPWtd appears to reduce the risk of wound complica-
tion and enhance wound healing despite these confound-
ing factors; this, we feel, is a result of reduction in wound 
oedema and stabilisation of wound edges.
As with any new device there are a few clinical and 
practical issues. the long tubing is prone to detachment 
and the pump lacks an integral clip for attachment to 
clothing (which resulted in one patient withdrawing 
from the study). this dressing is not suitable when there 
is excessive wound ooze and considerations must be 
given for a surgical washout. Blisters, as reported previ-
ously,61 are an issue with iNPWtd. these are minor, away 
from wound edges and minimised with careful applica-
tion of the dressing.
In conclusion, based on the study findings, iNPWtd 
offers a safe and predictable control of wound exudate in 
incisional wounds following hip and knee arthroplasties. 
It could allow patients to be discharged early without an 
exudating wound or post-discharge wound complica-
tions being a limiting factor. Incisional iNPWtd may be a 
choice where there is a rapid turnover of patients and bed 
planning is crucial. Perhaps for these dressings to be truly 
versatile and further conducive to their use in hip and 
knee arthroplasty, the pump needs to be smaller and 
form an integral part of the dressing.
