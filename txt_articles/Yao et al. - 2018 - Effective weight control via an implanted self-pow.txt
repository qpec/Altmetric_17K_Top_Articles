In vivo vagus nerve stimulation holds great promise in regulating food intake for obesity
treatment. Here we present an implanted vagus nerve stimulation system that is battery-free
and spontaneously responsive to stomach movement. The vagus nerve stimulation system
comprises a flexible and biocompatible nanogenerator that is attached on the surface of
stomach. It generates biphasic electric pulses in responsive to the peristalsis of stomach. The
electric signals generated by this device can stimulate the vagal afferent fibers to reduce food
intake and achieve weight control. This strategy is successfully demonstrated on rat models.
Within 100 days, the average body weight is controlled at 350 g, 38% less than the control
groups. This work correlates nerve stimulation with targeted organ functionality through a
smart, self-responsive system, and demonstrated highly effective weight control. This work
also provides a concept in therapeutic technology using artificial nerve signal generated from
coordinated body activities.

besity resulted from ingesting calories in excess of normal
biological requirement is a major risk for a large number
of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease1,2,
diabetes mellitus1,3, chronic kidney disease1, gallbladder diseases4,
certain cancers3,5, musculoskeletal disorders6, and even genetic
variation7. Treatment of obesity imposes an enormous economic
burden on the global healthcare system8–10. According to a recent
global survey, over 710 million people worldwide, including 107.7
million children and 603.7 million adults, are plagued by obesity
problems, and about 4 million people died of overweight- or
obesity-related diseases in 201510. Common approaches for
treating obesity include non-surgical and surgical treatments.
Daily physical exercise and taking weight-loss drugs are common
non-surgical weight reduction regimens, but there is a high
potential of weight rebound or side effects from drugs11. Current
bariatric surgical procedures such as gastric bypass, biliopancreatic
diversion, and sleeve gastrectomy have demonstrated a significant
impact on weight loss, but these procedures are invasive with the
potential of serious complications12–14. The rising healthcare
standards demand new obesity treatment strategies that are
effective, easy to operate, and have less side effects.
Neuromodulation, as a non-destructive and reversible ther-
apeutic strategy, can manipulate body functions by stimulating or
influencing neurophysiological signals through the neural net-
works to achieve therapeutic purpose15,16. It has been known for
a century that the vagus nerve (tenth cranial), a mixed para-
sympathetic nerve containing both afferent and efferent nerve
fibers, acts as a signal bridge to transport information between the
brain (the center of the nervous system) and the body (head,
neck, thorax, and abdomen)17–19. Recent breakthroughs in neu-
romodulation for body weight control have provided potential
opportunities for therapeutic interventions and brought renewed
promises and vitality to the development of new anti-obesity
strategies. A number of studies have demonstrated that pulsed
electrical stimulations on vagus nerve could induce multiple
physiologic functions related to food intake, energy metabolism,
and glycemic control, which can result in appreciable weight
loss20–22. An implantable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device
for weight control was recently approved by Food and Drug
Administration and commercialized20,23. Major concerns of
current
electrical
stimulation
are
potential
compensation
mechanisms that blunt physiological responses14 and vicinity
tissue damage that induces adverse effects17,24,25. In addition, the
electrical system is bulky and complicated in operation. All the
electrical stimulations need to be programed externally and
the device needs to be charged periodically13,26. How to achieve
real-time-responsive and self-sustainable stimulation remains a
major challenge for this promising weight control strategy.
In this work, we present a correlated VNS system that is battery
free and automatically generates electrical stimulations in corre-
lation to stomach movement. A flexible nanogenerator device is
developed to be attached to the stomach surface and produce
biphasic electrical pulses in response to the peristalsis of stomach.
The electric signals can stimulate the vagal afferent fibers to reduce
food intake and eventually achieve weight control. We successfully
demonstrated this strategy on rats and achieved 38% weight loss
in as short as 15 days without further rebound, exceeding all
current electrical stimulation approaches. This work provided an
effective weight control strategy that is self-responsive, battery
free, and directly correlating food intake to stomach movements.
Results
Development and working principle of the VNS device. The
correlated VNS system for weight control is designed following
the principle depicted in Fig. 1a. The stomach motion is used as
the sole source to generate pulsed voltage signals, which in
response will stimulate the vagus nerves to reduce food intake.
This self-responsive function is enabled by a triboelectric nano-
generator (TENG)27–31 attached on the surface of stomach, which
generates biphasic electric pulses when the stomach is in peri-
stalsis. Here, a bilateral VNS is implemented by wrapping the two
gold (Au) leads around the anterior vagus nerves (AVNs) and
posterior vagus nerves (PVNs) at the proximity of the gastro-
esophageal junction (Fig. 1b). The AVNs and PVNs were ~6 mm
apart and could be clearly observed via multiple staining images
(Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figure 1). Connecting at this position
could provide a focused stimulation to the small unmyelinated C
fibers and avoid stimulating fibers that join the trunk from the
heart and lungs32.
To ensure the mechanical robustness and flexibility of
implanted devices and to avoid potential erosion in the
physiological environment, the entire VNS device was packaged
by a multilayer film composed of polyimide, polydimethylsi-
loxane (PDMS), and ecoflex. Au leads were connected to the
tips of Cu wire electrodes and partially exposed for electrical
signal transmission (Fig. 1d, fabrication details are included in
Supplementary Figure 2a and b, which was described in
Supplementary Note 1). The TENG was able to generate
reasonably high voltage and current output under normal
contact-separation motions, with an optimal output power of
~40 µW at an external load of 20MΩ (Supplementary Figure 2c,
d and e). Based on the impedance of the vagus nerve, the
stimulation voltage was found to be around 200 mV (Supple-
mentary Figure 2d). Similar outputs were obtained from various
displacement motions, suggesting that the TENG was able to
respond to complex stomach motions (Supplementary Figure 3).
To confirm the biocompatibility of the packaged VNS device,
mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells were cultured on the encapsulated
device surface and in a reference cultural dish for 4 days to
examine and compare the cell attachment, proliferation, and
morphology. Cells in both media exhibited similar density and
equivalent morphology. No dead or distorted cells were
observed from the encapsulation material surface (Supplemen-
tary Figure 4). The fluorescent staining results showed that the
3T3 cells can spread and form intact cytoarchitecture in both
groups (Fig. 1e, f). In addition, 3-{4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
thiazolyl}−2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
revealed that the relative viability of 3T3 cells on encapsulation
material was more than 98% within 4 days, comparable to the
cells cultured in the culture dish (Fig. 1g). These results
confirmed that the encapsulated device is non-cytotoxic and
biocompatible.
When the stomach is under peristalsis stomach33,34, the
corresponding motion cycle of the triboelectric layers in the
VNS device is depicted in Fig. 2a (i)–(iv). As the stomach is
distended, the two triboelectric layers are pushed into contact,
where oppositely charged surfaces are created based on their
different electron affinity (stage i). The following contraction of
the stomach pulls the bottom electrode layer (BEL) layer away
from the polymer layer, and thus drives electrons flowing from
the top electrode layer (TEL) electrode to the BEL through the
two connections with the vagus nerve (stage ii). When the
stomach is fully contracted, the triboelectric layers are fully
separated, where maximum charge transfer is reached and the net
current through the nerve drops back to zero (stage iii). The BEL
layer is then brought back toward the polymer layer in the
following stomach distention (phase iv), resulting in an opposite
current flow through the vagus nerve until the stomach reaches
the original distended stage (i) again. The recorded voltage output
within one cycle at the frequency of 0.05 Hz is shown in Fig. 2b
and corresponding stages are marked along the curve. This

 contributes to the cyclic alternating electrical signals as the
stomach continues peristalsis.
To investigate how the implanted VNS device functioned in
response to stomach movements, voltage signals were first
measured between the two Au leads. The stomach was arbitrarily
deformed by cyclically pressurizing it via a gavage needle at a
series of frequencies of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 Hz (Fig. 2c).
Correspondingly, the voltage signals were also measured when
the two Au leads were connected to the vagus nerve in a rat’s
body (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Movie 1). Both voltage signals
exhibited similar amplitudes ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 V. It
should be noted that the recorded voltage was lower than the
actual operational voltage due to the finite internal impedance of
the measurement system (1MΩ). Higher voltage outputs were
recorded from higher frequency. While the stomach deformations
(i.e., pressure change) remained constant, higher voltage signal
could be attributed to a higher displacement rate, suggesting
faster stomach motion is favorable for more intense stimulation.
The implanted devices were removed from the rats 1 day, 7 days,
15 days, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after implantation, and
their voltage output was measured accordingly. All the devices
showed a good structural integrity without any observable defects
(Supplementary
Figure
6).
The
nearly
unchanged
voltage
amplitude confirmed good stability and durability of the VNS
device in the biological environment (Fig. 2e).
Electrophysiological signals were measured from the cervical
vagal trunk on the same day, and 7 and 15 days after implantation
(Supplementary Figure 7). As shown in Fig. 2f, when there was no
external stimulation, a regular electrophysiological signal from the
vagus nerve can be detected. The voltage amplitude was ~0.5 mV
with 11 electric pulses per signal group (Fig. 2g). When the VNS
device was activated, the amplitude increased to ~0.8 mV, and the
number of electric pulse per group increased to 18–19. This
measurement clearly showed that the VNS device can stimulate
vagus nerves effectively. Similar electrophysiological signals could
be detected at different time points post implantation, which
evidenced the vagus nerves were effectively stimulated by the VNS
device during the implantation period. Electrophysiological signals
were further measured in response to a range of stimulation
voltage from 50 to 740 mV. The stimulated state of the vagus
nerve was detected as the voltage from VNS device was above
100 mV. The signal intensity from the vagus nerve increased
monotonically following the stimulation voltage (Supplementary
Figure 8, Supplementary Note 2).
Biocompatibility and biosafety of implanted VNS device. Rats
with the VNS device implanted on stomach and the Au leads
connected to the vagus nerve were defined as the VNS-active
group. Small animal computed tomography (CT) was used to
produce three-dimensional (3D) x-ray images of representative
rat models as a function of implantation time to investigate the
implantation stability when the rat was under normal daily
activity (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Figure 9, and Movie 2). The high
contrast spot (Au is a good contrast agent for CT) inside the rat
was the implanted VNS device. No position shifting was observed
during the entire 12 weeks of implantation period. This high
stability could be attributed to the good biocompatibility of the
packaged VNS device, which was observed being completely
imbedded possibly by omentum and tightly fixed to the stomach
surface post study (Supplementary Figure 10). The right panel of
Fig. 3a shows an enlarged CT image of the implantation area,

 where the Au leads and exposed tip (with much brighter contrast)
can be clearly identified, wrapping around at the vagus nerve
region. In contrast to the VNS group, the sham group had the
same VNS device implanted on stomach but without Au leads
connecting the Cu wire electrodes to the vagus nerve (the com-
pletely packaged Cu wires were still placed at the same vicinity of
the vagus nerve, Fig. 3b). 3D CT images showed the same stable
VNS implantation in the sham group. The enlarged image
revealed the insulated leads exhibiting a uniformly low contrast.
As a comparison, rats in the laparotomy (Lap) group, which rats
were subjected to surgery but without the VNS device implan-
tation, were also imaged and showed only the skeleton of the rats
(Fig. 3c). The Sham, Lap, and Intact (rats without any operation)
groups are defined as the control groups.
Whole blood and chemical analysis were performed on the
four
groups
of
rats
for
biosafety
assessment
during
the
implantation period. Compared to the hematology data in intact
group, the blood glucose (GLU) concentration (Fig. 3d) in VNS
and Sham group decreased at week 2 due to reduced food intake
after surgery, and eventually recovered to the normal levels. The
indicators of infection such as lymphocytes (Fig. 3e), hemato-
poietic function such as red blood cell (RBC) (Fig. 3f) and
hemoglobin (Supplementary Figure 11a), hepatological function
such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Fig. 3g) and albumin
(Supplementary Figure 11b), renal function such as creatinine
(Fig. 3h) and blood urea nitrogen (Supplementary Figure 11c),
and electrolyte metabolism such as calcium (Ca) (Fig. 3i) and
phosphorus (Supplementary Figure 11d) all remained steady
during the entire implantation period. In general, all the blood
testing results were within the normal range shortly after the
device implantation and did not show any abnormality35,36,
suggesting that the VNS device is highly hemocompatible. The
comprehensive blood analyses, together with the imaging results,
confirmed that implanting the VNS device on stomach surface
did not cause any measurable adverse effect to the rats. All rats
with the VNS implantation exhibited normal daily behaviors,
which were not different from the intact groups (Supplementary
Movie 3).
Pathological tests were conducted on most vital organs,
including heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bowel, stomach, and
esophagus. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were collected
from these organs at different time points (1 day, 7 days, and
15 days) post implantation. All the organs showed no deforma-
tion and abnormal lymphatic cell invasion (Fig. 3j), which further
confirmed that all the rats were in a good health condition, and
the VNS device had no systemic side effects. Histological analysis
of the vagus nerves 15 days after implantation showed no signs of
nerve cell shape change or invasion of inflammation cells
(Supplementary Figure 12). This revealed the vagus nerves were
not damaged by connecting the VNS device.
Weight control by implanted VNS device. The weight control
performance was first examined in the four groups of rats (VNS,
Sham, Lap, and Intact) that were fed and grown under the same
conditions. The average initial weight of rats was 250 g, and their
body weight and food intake were monitored on a daily basis.
After 100 days, the body size of the VNS group was significantly
smaller than all three control groups (Fig. 4a). The recorded body
weight and corresponding daily food intake over time are shown
in Fig.
4b, c, respectively. Since the implantation surgery was
conducted on the seventh day of this study, all four groups
exhibited the same body growth trend and the same amount of
food consumption over the first week, indicating that all rats were
under the identical growth conditions and their results were
comparable. Immediately after the surgery, the VNS and Sham
groups (both had VNS implanted) exhibited an obvious weight
loss. Accordingly, their food intake was also largely reduced likely
due to the VNS device attachment. The Lap group, which had the
same surgical procedure/opening, did not show any abnormity in
weight change or food intake when compared to the intact group,
suggesting that surgery itself had minimal impact on weight
control. As the rat’s body adapted to the VNS device implanta-
tion, the amount of food intake of the Sham group quickly
recovered to the same level as the other two control groups after
~15 days of implantation. As a result, the average body weight of
the Sham group bounced back after the initial 2–3 days, and
increased following the same trend of the other two control
groups (Lap and Intact). After 60 days, all three control groups
exhibited a very close body weight of 535 ± 18 g (Sham), 538 ± 32
g (Lap), and 538 ± 32 g (Intact) (n = 6 for each control group),
confirming that neither surgery nor simple stomach attachment
had any effect on weight control. On the contrary, although the
food intake of the VNS group recovered as well after the initial
reduction and reached a steady level after ~15 days, the daily
consumption of food was only ~2/3 of those consumed by the
other control groups. Therefore, the average body weight of the
VNS group exhibited a much slower growth rate. It reached a
steady value of 350 ± 23 g (n = 6), about 63% of the other three
control groups. Box plots were implemented to provide a statistic
analysis of the final body weight (on the day of sacrifice, Fig. 4d)
and food intake (on the last day before euthanasia, Fig. 4e). The
differences between the VNS group and three control groups were
statistically significant (P < 0.001) for both body weight and food
intake, while the differences between all three control groups were
not (P > 0.2). Such comparison clearly revealed that spontaneous
nerve stimulation by the implanted VNS device had obvious
impact on weight control.
All the rats were sacrificed after the 100-day weight control
study for anatomical examinations. Similarly, the anatomical
adipose tissues (epididymal fat pad and perirenal fat pad,
representative of the body fat level)37 in the VNS group were
significantly smaller than the control groups (Fig. 4f). The average
weight of the epididymal fat pad and perirenal fat pad were only
4.01 and 1.36 g, 58 and 67% smaller than the control groups,
respectively (Fig. 4g). The epididymal fat pad/body weight ratio
(EBR) was calculated by dividing the fat pad weight by the total
body weight. Average EBR was maintained at 1.14% in the VNS
group, significantly lower than the control groups which all
exhibited EBR of ~1.7% (Fig. 4h). By comparing the weight
difference between the VNS and control groups, our correlated
VNS system rapidly achieved 35% weight loss within 18 days and
maintained a weight-loss ratio as high as 38% for remaining study
period (75 days), which largely exceeded other reported electrical
stimulation approaches based on similar rat models38–43 (Fig. 4i).
To further exploit the capability of the VNS system for weight
loss, the same implantation surgery and analyses were conducted
on grown adult rats that have been fed for 7 weeks and reached a
steady average body weight of ~500 g. Little body weight gain was
observed for the intact group during the 70-day study period,
while the VNS group exhibited an obvious body size reduction
(Fig. 5a). Similar as the previous study, the Lap group exhibited
no difference when compared to the intact group, while the Sham
group quickly recovered to the same levels after the initial drop in
both body weight and food intake (Fig. 5b, c, respectively). Food
intake of the VNS group exhibited a much slower recovery rate
and eventually remained at the steady value that was ~2/3 of the
control groups. Accordingly, the average body weight of the VNS
group exhibited a steep drop over the first 25 days after
implantation, followed by a small recovery and stabilized at
~400 g. The final body weight (Fig. 5d) and food intake (Fig. 5e)
showed significant differences between the VNS group and

 control groups, and no significant difference were found among
the control groups. The final average body weight was controlled
at 410 ± 17 g (n = 4), significantly smaller than the control groups
(Sham: 575 ± 22 g; Lap: 569 ± 39 g; and Intact: 574 ± 48 g, n = 4
for each control group). Significant differences were also found in
the adipose tissue sizes (Fig. 5f) and weight (Fig. 5g). The final
EBR was controlled at 1.26% in the VNS group, while the three
control groups maintained a much high value from 1.69% to
1.77% (Fig. 5h). The calculated weight-loss percentage peaked at
38% at day 29 and gradually reached a stable 28% (Fig. 5i).
Discussion
In this work, we present a correlated VNS system as an effective
therapeutic strategy for obesity, which provided correlated
nerve stimulation signal in response to stomach peristalsis. The
VNS device was built based on a flexible TENG that was
attached to the stomach wall of rats and could generate biphasic
electric pulses when the stomach wall moved. The TENG
electrodes were directly connected to the vagus nerve, where the
stomach motion-generated voltage signals stimulated the vagus
nerve to reduce food intake. We envision that this correlated
stimulation could provide less amount but more targeted sti-
mulation so that the nerves might be more responsive to the
stimulation, and thus more effective to control food intake. The
VNS device exhibited excellent biocompatibility without any
signs of side effects from the whole blood and chemical ana-
lysis. CT and hematology indicators revealed the implantation
was very stable and remained at the same position during the
entire testing period. The weight control performance was
examined and compared among the VNS, Sham, Lap, and
Intact groups of rats that were fed and grown under the same
conditions. From the weight-gain test, the average body weight
and EBR can be controlled at 350 g and 1.14% in the VNS
group, compared to 559–564 g and 1.65–1.69% in the other
three control groups with insignificant differences. The VNS

 system rapidly achieved 35% weight loss within 18 days, which
was maintained 38% during the remaining 75-day testing per-
iod. From the weight-loss test, the average body weight and
EBR was controlled at 410 g and 1.26% in the VNS group,
compared to 570–575 g and 1.69–1.77% in the other three
control groups. Rats in the VNS groups were also able to
recover their normal weight pattern immediately after the
implanted VNS devices were removed (Supplementary Fig-
ure 13, Supplementary Note 3). Our correlated VNS system
demonstrates outstanding weight control results, which largely
outperformed other reported chronic microchip VNS systems
based on similar rat models. In addition, this correlated VNS is
battery free and less invasive compared to the bariatric surgical
strategies (e.g., gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion or
sleeve gastrectomy) for weight control. For future clinical trials,
a switch may be needed by the VNS device to control the
treatment. This could be achieved by integrating a shutter
switch to the electrical wires from the VNS device, as it has been
proved that a disconnected device has no impact to food
intake and weight change. More broadly, this development
demonstrated a successful example of a self-responsive and
real-time peripheral neuromodulation mechanism that may be
more effective for achieving therapeutic purpose.
Methods
Device fabrication and encapsulation. Polyimide film (50 μm) was used as the
core package layer that was proven to be biocompatible and corrosion resistant for
bio-implanted devices44,45. Casting and curing a pre-polymer to PDMS (15:1
PDMS; Dow Corning, USA) covers the entire device as the shell package (1 mm) to
enhance the leakproof and ensure good structural flexibility and stability. To fur-
ther increase the flexibility to closely fit the non-planar surfaces of stomach and
maintain sensitivity in response to stomach motions, a layer of ecoflex (200 μm)
was coated onto the surface as another shell structure of the device46–48. The PTFE
surface was treated by reactive ionic etching to introduce nanostructured features
to enhance the electrical output49 (Supplementary Figure 2a). The overall VNS

 device dimensions are approximately 16 × 12 × 2.5 (L × W × T) mm3 and the
weight was measured to be only ~0.8 g.
Electrical characterization of VNS devices. The electrical performance of all
implanted VNS devices were measure by a portable oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO1012A,
internal impedance is 1MΩ). The voltage signals shown in Fig. 2b, d were measured
directly from an implanted VNS device where the two Au leads were connected to the
vagus nerve. The stomach motions were induced by injecting water into the stomach
using a gavage needle through the mouth and the injection volume difference was 2
mL. The voltage signal shown in Fig. 2c was measured by pressing the VNS devices in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution under different frequency when the VNS
device was connected to an external load with the same impedance of the implanted
area. Voltage signals in Fig. 2e and Supplementary Figure 3 were measured by the
pressing the VNS devices at frequency of 4 Hz when connected to an external load of
0.3MΩ, the same as the impedance of the vagus nerve. The voltage and current output
of TENGs as a function of load (10Ω to 200MΩ) was measured by a Stanford Research
Systems model SR 560 low-noise preamplifier (internal impedance is 100MΩ). The
impedance of implanted VNS device was characterized from 0.01 to 10,000 Hz using
an Autolab PGSTAT302N station (Supplementary Figure 5).
Electrophysiological properties of vagus nerve. A Sprague–Dawley rat was
anesthetized and its right cervical vagal trunk was carefully exposed (Supplementary
Figure 7a). A pair of bipolar platinum hook electrodes was then placed under the right
vagal nerve immediately. The exposed nerve tissue was covered with warm (37 °C)
paraffin oil. The electrical signals were recorded and analyzed by a Cambridge Elec-
tronic Design (CED) 1401 interface (Cambridge, UK) with Spike 2 software to monitor
the change the electrical signal of the VNS device (Supplementary Figure 7b and c).
The VNS device was implanted in rat’s body with Au leads being connected to anterior
and PVNs. The implanted VNS devices were activated by gently pressing the abdomen
of the rats at a frequency of 1 Hz. In addition, VNS devices with different sizes were
fabricated to study the response of vagus nerve in corresponding to the amplitude of
stimulation voltage (Supplementary Figure 8).
Animals and diets. All animal experiments were conducted under a protocol
approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Seven- and eight-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats were acquired
from Envigo (New Jersey, USA). All rats were housed in separated cages at a
temperature-controlled room (22 °C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access
to water and Purina PMI-certified rodent chow 5002 (LabDiet, MO, USA).
Food intake and body weight. Body weight and food intake was recorded at 8:00
p.m. every other day. The daily food intake was determined from the difference in
food quality between each measurement and divided by two. All rats were deprived
of food for 12 h before surgical implantation and blood test. Percentage of weight
loss (Pweight loss) over time in Figs. 4i and 5i was calculated according to the
formula: Pweight loss = (WIntact–WVNS)/WIntact × 100%, where WIntact and WVNS
represent the average weight of the Intact group and the VNS group, respectively.
Histological staining of vagus nerve and vital organs. Tissue slices of the bottom
of esophagus and its surrounding tissue were prepared. H&E staining, immuno-
histochemical (Supplementary Figure 1a), and immunofluorescent (Supplementary
Figure 1b) staining using anti-S-100 rabbit anti-rat poly-antibody50 showed clearly
the anterior vagal trunk and posterior vagal trunk distributed on both sides of the
esophagus. Vital organs including heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bowel, stomach,
and esophagus were retrieved from rats for H&E staining after euthanasia at different
time points (1 day, 7 days, and 15 days) post implantation. In addition, vagus nerves
were re-evaluated after the device being implanted for 15 days, and the additional
H&E staining results were shown in Supplementary Figure 12.
Cell morphology and immunofluorescence staining. After 3T3 cells were cul-
tured on encapsulation or cell plates in 24-well plates, cell morphology was
observed directly using an inverted optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-U,
Japan). The cytoskeleton and nucleus were stained with Texas Red-X phalloidin
(591/608 nm) and blue fluorescent Hoechst (352/461 nm) (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific), respectively. The samples were fixed with 2–4% formaldehyde for 15 min and
then rinsed three times with pre-warmed PBS. The samples were incubated with
Texas Red-X phalloidin (100 nM) and Hoechst (50 nM) for 30 min at 37 °C. After
staining, cells were rinsed with pre-warmed buffer for three times and imaged using
a Nikon A1RS confocal microscope.
MTT assay. After 3T3 cells were cultured on the packaging film on 24-well plates,
MTT assay (Thermo Fisher scientific) was performed to examine cell proliferation.
After incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for up to 4 days,
100 μL of MTT solution was added to each well. After 4-h incubation, the medium
was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (500 μL/well) was added to dissolve the pre-
cipitated fomazan. The optical density (n = 3) of the solution was evaluated using a
microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 490 nm.
Device implantation. In brief, anesthesia was induced by inhalation of 2–5% iso-
flurane and maintained with 2% isoflurane. Following anesthesia, rats were fixed in
supine position. The abdomen of rats was scrubbed with iodine scrub, and then alcohol
prior to surgery. An incision of 2–5 cm was made on the left upper abdomen of rats.
The device was placed beside the stomach. The anterior and posterior vagus nerves
were identified and separated from the gastroesophageal junction. For the VNS group,
Au wires were placed in contact with the nerves and secured with sterile surgical tape.
For the sham group, the device was implanted with insulated electrodes connecting to
the vagus nerves. Afterwards, the muscle and skin were sutured layer by layer and the
stitches were removed 2 weeks later. The implantation procedure is shown step by step
in Supplementary Figure 14. The entire surgery lasted approximately 15 min.
CT scan. CT whole-body scan was performed to evaluate the position and integrity
of the VNS device post implantation, which can generate 3D images and recon-
struct a high-definition 2D projection image of rats with a resolution of up to 100
µm. In brief, rats were placed in the prone position after anesthesia and scanned by
an Inveon micro positron emission tomography/CT scanner (Siemens Medical
Solutions, USA) at 1 day, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks post implantation. CT
images were reconstructed and presented as 3D projection or slices.
Hematology data. Whole-blood and chemical analysis were performed for safety
assessment pre-implantation and 2, 6, and 12 weeks post implantation. Blood was
drawn from the tail vein of the rats and various tests were performed using an Abaxis
VetScan HM5 Hematology Analyzer (Abaxis, USA) and VS2 Blood Chemistry
Analyzer (Abaxis, USA). No centrifugation or other treatment were needed.
Anatomic examination and adipose tissue collection. After rats were euthanized
at the end of the study, an incision was made on the abdomen. The stomach along
with the VNS device were taken out for further analysis. In addition, epididymal fat
pad and perirenal fat pad were removed and weighed for further analysis (Sup-
plementary Figure 15).
Statistical analysis. For the final body weight, food intake, and adipose tissue
weight, statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests.
