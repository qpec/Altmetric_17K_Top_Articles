bowel syndrome (IMAGINE): a multicentre randomised 
controlled trial

Summary
Background Hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been used primarily in patients with refractory 
symptoms in specialised departments and delivered on an individual basis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that 
hypnotherapy would be more effective than educational supportive therapy, and that group hypnotherapy would be 
non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy for patients with IBS referred from primary and secondary care.
Methods We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial (IMAGINE) in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with 
IBS, aged 18–65 years, who were referred from primary or secondary care were randomly allocated (3:3:1) in blocks of 
six using a computer-based random number table procedure by staff not involved in the treatment to receive six sessions 
of individual or group hypnotherapy or group educational supportive therapy (control group). The primary outcome 
was adequate relief of IBS symptoms, with responders defined as patients who reported adequate relief when asked 
once weekly on three or four occasions in 4 consecutive weeks. We compared hypnotherapy (both groups) with control 
in the intention-to-treat population (excluding individuals subsequently found to be ineligible for enrolment), and 
assessed non-inferiority of group hypnotherapy versus individual hypnotherapy in the per-protocol population (with a 
non-inferiority margin of 15%) at 3 months and 12 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN22888906, and is completed.
Findings Between May 31, 2011, and April 6, 2016, 494 patients referred for psychological treatment for IBS were 
assessed for eligibility, of whom 354 were randomly allocated to the three groups: 150 to individual hypnotherapy, 
150 to group hypnotherapy, and 54 to educational supportive therapy. After exclusion of individuals subsequently 
found to be ineligible for enrolment, 142 patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 146 in the group hypnotherapy 
group, and 54 in the control group were included in the intention-to-treat population. Of these, 22 (15%) patients in 
the individual hypnotherapy group, 22 (15%) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 11 (20%) in the control group 
dropped out before or during therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the adequate response rate was 40·8% 
(95% CI 31·7–50·5) in the individual hypnotherapy group, 33·2% (24·3–43·5) in the group hypnotherapy group, 
and 16·7% (7·6–32·6) in the control group at 3 months.  At 12 months, 40·8% (31·3–51·1) of patients in the 
individual hypnotherapy group, 49·5% (38·8–60·0) of patients in the group hypnotherapy group, and 22.6% 
(11·5–39·5) of patients in the control group reported adequate relief. Hypnotherapy was more effective than control 
at 3 months (odds ratio 2·9, 95% CI 1·2–7·4, p=0·0240) and 12 months (2·8, 1·2–6·7, p=0·0185). In the per-protocol 
analysis, 49·9% (39·2–60·6) in the individual hypnotherapy group and 42·7% (32·3–53·8) in the group hypnotherapy 
group had adequate relief at 3 months, and 55·5% (43·4–67·1) of individual and 51·7% (40·2–63·0) of group 
hypnotherapy patients reported adequate relief at 12 months. Group hypnotherapy was therefore non-inferior to 
individual hypnotherapy. Eight unexpected serious adverse reactions (six in the individual hypnotherapy group and 
two in the group hypnotherapy group) were reported, most of which were cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, and 
were judged by the medical ethics committee as not being related to the therapy.
Interpretation Hypnotherapy should be considered as a possible treatment for patients with IBS in primary and 
secondary care. Furthermore, group therapy could allow many more patients to be treated for the same cost.

Introduction
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional 
gastrointestinal disorder characterised by recurrent 
episodes of abdominal pain, discomfort, and altered 
bowel habits in the absence of structural or biochemical 
abnormalities.1 Diagnosis is made using consensus-based 
criteria, the most recent being the Rome IV criteria.2 
Patients with IBS can have incapacitating symptoms, 
leading to impaired quality of life3 and a substantial 
economic burden on society.4–6 Pharma 
cotherapy has 
little effectiveness, although the antibiotic rifaximin, anti

linaclotide, and lubiprostone can be effective in some 
patients.7 Psychological interventions have been shown 
to be effective, but their application is limited by a 
shortage of trained therapists.7,8
Since 1984, there has been increasing interest in the 
use of hypnotherapy for IBS.9 Meta-analyses of studies 
in secondary-care and tertiary-care settings suggest 
effective 
ness, but more high-quality trials, especially in 
primary-care patient groups, are needed before firm 
conclusions can be drawn.7,10,11
Despite its reported effectiveness, hypnotherapy has 
not yet been widely adopted, probably in part because it 
is usually delivered on an individual basis, which limits 
the number of patients that can be treated. In addition, 
hypno 
therapy is considered to be useful mainly for 
treatment-refractory patients in tertiary care.12–14 Group 
application could make hypnotherapy suitable for 
broader application if it is shown to be as effective as 
individual sessions and useful in primary care. To date, 
there has been only one direct comparison of group 
versus individual hypnotherapy for IBS, which suggested 
no difference in efficacy. However, the study involved 
only 33 patients, who were referred from secondary and 
tertiary care.15
We designed a randomised controlled trial to assess 
the efficacy of hypnotherapy, delivered on a group or 
individual basis, for patients with IBS in primary and 
secondary care, compared with a control group receiving 
educational supportive therapy.16 We hypothesised that 
hypnotherapy would be more efficacious than edu-
cational supportive therapy, and that hypnotherapy in a 
group setting would be non-inferior to individual 
therapy.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a multicentre, 12-week, parallel-group random-
ised controlled trial with three arms (IMAGINE). Details 
on the study design are reported elsewhere.16
The study population consisted of patients with IBS, 
aged between 18 and 65 years, referred by primary-care 
physicians and hospital specialists from 11 secondary-
care hospitals in the Netherlands. All patients met the 
Rome III criteria for IBS, confirmed by the Dutch 
version of the IBS module from the Rome Foundation,17 
officially translated by two study authors (CEF, YRvR). 
Patients were excluded if they had insufficient command 
of the Dutch language, were unwilling to participate in 
group sessions, had a psychiatric condition that required 
additional treatment first (eg, severe depression, post-
traumatic stress syndrome, or psychosis), had comorbid 
chronic bowel diseases, or had a history of major gastro-
intestinal surgery or radiotherapy.
The study was done according to the principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with 
the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Act. The study protocol was approved by the Medical 
Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre of 
Utrecht (Netherlands; approval number 10-201/O). All 
par 
tici 
pants gave written informed consent before taking 
part.
Randomisation and masking
After an intake session with a hospital-based psychologist 
and hypnotherapist, in which inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were checked and informed consent was signed, 
patients were randomly allocated (3:3:1) to one of 
three groups: individual hypnotherapy, group hypno-
therapy, or educational supportive therapy (control). 
Random 
isation, using a block size of six, was done by 
means of a computer-based random number table pro-
cedure, by staff not involved in treatment of the patients. 
As group treatment required six patients, random 
isation 
was done block-wise to prevent prolonged waiting time 
for individual patients. Patients and therapists were not 
masked to the treatment. Patient data were coded and 
those doing the analysis were masked to treatment 
group allocation.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before the start of the study, we searched PubMed for 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in English 
between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2010, on the effectiveness 
of hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 
Hypnotherapy has shown effectiveness in IBS, but mainly for 
patients with refractory symptoms, delivered in specialised 
departments, and in an individual setting. Systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses describe the evidence as still insufficient 
because of methodological shortcomings, and recommend 
further investigation with high-quality trials with long-term 
follow-up, especially with regard to the efficacy of 
hypnotherapy in a primary-care setting.
Added value of this study
In our multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with 
IBS in primary and secondary care, hypnotherapy significantly 
increased adequate relief of complaints compared with 
educational supportive therapy. We also found that group 
hypnotherapy was non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Hypnotherapy gives adequate relief of IBS complaints, not only 
for patients in tertiary care with refractory disease, but also for 
patients from primary and secondary care. Hypnotherapy can be 
considered as a treatment option for all patients with IBS, 
irrespective of symptom severity and IBS subtype. Group delivery 
could facilitate widespread use of hypnotherapy in daily practice.

Procedures
For individual hypnotherapy, patients were offered a total 
of six 45-min sessions, which took place every 2 weeks. 
Hypnotherapy followed a structured protocol with the 
same content for each session. After introduction and 
explanation of the therapy, the first step was hypnotic 
induction, followed by suggestions, illustrated by images 
described in the protocol, to normalise motility of the gut 
and reduce pain and feelings of discomfort. Possible 
questions concerning the hypnotic process were 
discussed and the importance of practising the exercises 
at home was emphasised. The treatment procedure was 
developed by an investigator (CEF), based on the 
Manchester protocol for hypnotherapy in IBS, which was 
previously developed and validated by Whorwell and 
colleagues.18
For group hypnotherapy, patients participated in a total 
of six 60-min group sessions, with six patients with IBS 
per group, which took place every 2 weeks. The same 
protocol as for individual hypnotherapy was used.
Both the individual and group therapy groups were 
given homework assignments consisting of CD-recorded 
hypnotherapeutic exercises that required 15–20 min daily. 
Our 2009 pilot study was done in one of the collaborating 
hospitals, in which 32 patients with IBS received the gut-
directed hypnotherapy according to the manual either in 
group sessions or on an individual basis. The manual was 
found applicable, and group treatment was found to be 
non-inferior to individual treatment (unpublished data).
Individual and group treatments were given by the 
same therapists. All therapists were qualified psycholo-
gists who were trained as hypnotherapists, but most of 
them did not have specific experience with patients with 
IBS. Before the start of the study, they were instructed on 
the intervention by one of the authors (CEF).
According to earlier recommendations, optimal control 
interventions for the evaluation of psychological thera-
pies require similar numbers of contacts and lengths of 
sessions with the therapist as the treatment under study, 
and content that is relevant for patients.19 We therefore 
developed an educational supportive therapy consisting 
of a total of six 60-min group sessions, which took place 
every 2 weeks, with six patients per group. This therapy 
was designed on the basis of existing literature on the 
knowledge and educational needs of patients with IBS.20–
23 An extensive general explanation of IBS was given, and 
complaints, thoughts about complaints, coping mecha-
nisms, limitations, avoidance behaviour, and the effects 
of the IBS complaints on social relations were discussed. 
Information on dietary aspects of IBS was given according 
to the UK National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) guidelines.11 An explanation of the 
benefits of exercise for IBS complaints was discussed and 
an explanation of the stress system was given, and ways 
of coping were discussed. Homework, requiring 15–20 min 
per day, was assigned. Educational supportive therapy 
was provided by nurse practitioners or psychological 
assistants who were specifically trained by the author 
(CEF) for the control intervention.
Patients were allowed to continue medical care but were 
asked not to change medication during participation, 
except on their doctor’s advice. Medications were recorded 
before and after the treatment and at the 9-month follow-
up with the Trimbos/iMTA Questionnaire (TiC-P).
Adequate relief of symptoms was assessed at 3 months 
(immediately after treatment) and 12 months (9 months 
after the end of treatment). Adequate relief is a validated 
outcome in IBS research, consisting of a single question 
with a yes or no response: “Did you have adequate relief of 
IBS related abdominal pain or discomfort in the past 
week?”.24 The question was asked once weekly for 
4 consecutive weeks.24,25 A responder was defined as a 
patient who answered “yes” three or four times in the 
4 weeks.
IBS symptom severity was measured at baseline, 
3 months, and 12 months, using the IBS Severity Scoring 
System (IBS-SSS), a validated instrument that assesses 
five features (pain severity and frequency, abdominal 
distension, bowel satisfaction, and inter 
ference with life 
in general) and their intensity using visual analogue 
scales.26
Disease-specific quality of life was assessed at baseline, 
3 months, and 12 months, using the Irritable Bowel 
Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) scale,27 which has 
been validated in various populations and includes 
30 items on nine scales: dysphoria, interference with 
activity, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social 
reaction, sexuality, relationships, and an overall scale. The 
sum score is used as the outcome.
Psychological symptoms were assessed at baseline, 
3 months, and 12 months, with the Dutch version of the 
Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90),28,29 a 90-item, multi-
dimensional, self-reported inventory for the evaluation 
of psychological problems and psycho 
pathology on 
nine subscales: agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, somati-
sation, insufficiency of thought and action, distrust and 
inter 
personal sensitivity, hostility, sleeping problems, and 
psychoneuroticism (total score). The sum score is used as 
outcome. The SCL-90 is a validated and widely used 
questionnaire with good psychometric qualities.28
Dysfunctional cognitions were assessed at baseline, 
3 months, and 12 months, with the Cognitive Scale for 
Functional Bowel Disorders (CS-FBD), developed by 
Toner and colleagues.30 The CS-FBD consists of 31 items 
that measure a patient’s level of dysfunctional cognitions 
concerning their IBS. It is a valid and reliable outcome 
measure scale.32
Self-efficacy was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 
12 months, using the Self-efficacy Scale (SES),31 a seven-
item questionnaire designed to measure the confidence 
patients have in their capacity to influence their somatic 
complaints. It was originally developed for patients 
suffering from chronic fatigue and adapted by two authors 
(CEF, YRvR) by permission of Bleijenberg and colleagues.31

The TiC-P was used to measure direct medical costs due 
to health-care use for psychiatric illness during the past 
4 weeks, and indirect non-medical costs due to productivity 
loss during the past 2 weeks.32 The questionnaire was 
adapted for use in IBS for this study and was assessed at 
baseline, 3 months, and 12 months. Direct medical costs 
included the total costs for visits to the primary-care 
doctor and specialist and the costs for medication in the 
past 4 weeks.
Patients in the hypnotherapy groups were requested to 
record the number of times they used the provided CD or 
did the hypnotherapeutic exercises in the past week for 
52 consecutive weeks.
Outcomes
In line with previous recommendations on optimal 
outcome assessment in trials on functional gastro-
intestinal disorders, we chose adequate relief of IBS 
symptoms as the primary outcome.33,34 Secondary out-
comes were IBS symptom severity (assessed using the 
IBS-SSS), quality of life (assessed using IBS-QOL), 
psycho 
logical symp 
toms (assessed using SCL-90), dys-
functional cognitions (assessed using CS-FBD), self-
efficacy (assessed using SES), and costs (assessed using 
TiC-P). 
Adverse events were recorded by the therapists and sent 
to the principal investigator, who sent a report to the 
medical ethics committee to judge the case.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of the hypnotherapy treatments compared with 
the control treatment was based on the intention-to-treat 
principle (excluding patients subsequently found to be 
ineligible for enrolment). For the comparison between 
hypnotherapy and control, we assumed a 32% difference 
in response, based on an earlier reported response rate for 
individual hypnotherapy of 57%10 and a placebo response 
rate of 25%.35 Powering the study for only this comparison 
would require 44 patients in both arms, assuming an α of 
0·05, a power (1 – β) of 0·80, a cluster size of six patients 
per therapist, and an intra-class correlation coefficient of 
0·05.
In line with the recommendations from the CONSORT 
statement, analysis of the non-inferiority of group hypno-
therapy compared with individual hypnotherapy was 
based on the per-protocol principle.36 For the comparison 
of non-inferiority of group hypnotherapy compared with 
individual hypnotherapy, the maximum acceptable differ-
ence for non-inferiority was set at 15%. With an α of 0·05 
and power of 0·80, 135 patients were required in each 
group to show non-inferiority. Com 
bining the sample size 
of both comparisons, assuming 10% loss to follow-up, 
and using six patients per group, 354 were required.
The primary outcome at 3 months and 12 months 
was analysed by logistic regression, incorporating a resi-
dual covariance (ie, generalised-estimated-equations type) 
matrix in the regression model to correct for repeated 
measure 
ments.37 Under the presumption of non-
inferiority of individual hypnotherapy compared with 
group hypnotherapy, we analysed the combined results of 
both groups versus the control group, reporting the odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs and p values. To evaluate the 
non-inferiority hypothesis, we estimated the proportion of 
adequate relief (with 95% CIs) within each group.
Continuous secondary outcomes at 3 months and 
12 months were analysed with a linear regression model 
that also incorporated a residual covariance matrix. From 
these models, we estimated the mean of the outcomes for 
all treatment groups and differences between these 
means (with 95% CIs). In all analyses, we included the 
time of visit (3 months and 12 months), the type of 
treatment (individual, group, or control), and interaction 
between time of visit and treatment. Visit-by-treatment 
interactions were included to obtain the comparison 
between treatment groups for each visit separately. 
Baseline measurements, available for all secondary 
outcomes, were included to correct for any imbalance 
between groups and to optimise power.
As done by Gonsalkorale and colleagues,12 we did a pre-
specified analysis of the effect of hypnotherapy com 
pared 
with educational supportive therapy in different types of 
IBS (constipation-predominant, diarrhoea-pre 
dominant, 
and mixed type). We also did subgroup analyses according 
to referral (primary or secondary care; prespecified 
analysis) and symptom severity (IBS-SSS; post-hoc 
analysis). 
Subsequently, we analysed any potential bias due to 
missing outcome measurements; in line with recom-
mendations,38 we did analyses for the primary outcome 
with correction for IBS-QOL, SCL-90, and IBS-SSS at 
baseline.
To avoid any risk of bias and loss of statistical power, 
we used multiple imputation techniques.38,39 No outcome 
measures were imputed. Missing data were imputed 
ten times and, when applicable, analyses were done for 
each imputation separately. The results were pooled with 
Rubin’s rule. Multiple imputation was done with SPSS 
version 21. All analyses were done with SAS version 9.4.
This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN22888906, and is completed.

supportive therapy (n=54). Before the study started, 
13 hospitals had offered their cooperation. For various 
reasons, only 11 hospitals included patients for the trial 
(appendix p 1). Before the trial started, four psychological 
practices in primary care reported that they did not receive 
enough referrals from general practitioners to form 
groups of patients needed in the trial. Therefore, these 
centres were advised to refer eligible patients to clinical 
psycholo 
gists in the participating hospitals.
After randomisation, six patients in the individual 
therapy group and two in the group therapy group were 
excluded from the analysis because they were diagnosed 
with a somatic disease that explained their symptoms 
(one oesophageal and lung cancer, one colorectal cancer, 
one pancreatic cancer, two inflammatory bowel disease, 
one neuralgia, and two unknown other disease).40 
Additionally, two patients in the individual hypnotherapy 
group and two patients in the group hypnotherapy group 
were found to be older than 65 years after randomisation 
and were excluded.
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups 
(table 1). We observed few missing values in baseline 
measure 
 
 
ments. Missing values were mainly due to 
patients skipping individual questions in otherwise 
completed questionnaires.
22 (15%) patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 
22 (15%) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 11 (20%) 
in the control group dropped out before or during therapy.
Patients’ compliance in reporting the use of the CD was 
low; after 12 months, only 44 (16%) of the 269 patients 
who started hypnotherapy returned their list of CD use, 
which was considered insufficient for analysis.
After 3 months (at the end of therapy), data for the 
primary outcome were available for 102 patients in the 
individual hypnotherapy group (76% of those who started 
therapy), 92 in the group hypnotherapy group (69%), and 
35 (76%) in the control group. Of these patients, 41 (40%) 
in the individual hypnotherapy group, 32 (35%) in the 
group hypnotherapy group, and six (17%) in the control 
group had adequate relief of symptoms. Adequate relief 
results at 12 months were available for 91 patients in the 
individual hypnotherapy group (67% of those who started 
therapy), 80 (60%) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 
31 (67%) in the control group. Of these, 38 (42%) in the 
individual hypnotherapy group, 40 (50%) in the group 
hypnotherapy group, and seven (23%) in the control 
group had adequate relief of symptoms (table 2).
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the adequate response 
rate was 40·8% (95% CI 31·7–50·5) in the individual 
hypnotherapy group, 33·2% (24·3–43·5) in the group 
hypnotherapy group, and 16·7% (7·6–32·6) in the control 
group at 3 months. At 12 months, 40·8% (31·3–51·1) of 
patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 49·5% 
(38·8–60·0) of patients in the group hypnotherapy group, 
and 22.6% (11·5–39·5) of patients in the control group 
reported adequate relief. Treatment response was signi-
ficantly better in both hypnotherapy groups com 
bined 
after 3 months (OR 2·9 [1·2–7·4]) and after 12 months 
(2·8 [1·2–6·7]; table 3) than in the control group. The 
number needed to treat for hypnotherapy was 4·9 after 
3 months and 4·4 after 12 months.
In the per-protocol analysis, the proportion of 
responders was 49·9% (39·2–60·6) in the individual 
hypnotherapy group and 42·7% (32·3–53·8) in the group

hypnotherapy group at 3 months. At 12 months, 55·5% 
(43·4–67·1) of individual and 51·7% (40·2–63·0) of group 
hypnotherapy patients reported adequate relief. Treatment 
response in terms of primary outcome was therefore non-
inferior in the group hypnotherapy group compared with 
individual hypnotherapy at both timepoints (table 3).
Patients in all three groups showed improvements in 
IBS symptom severity, quality of life, psychological 
complaints, IBS-related cognitions, and self-efficacy 
compared with baseline, with slightly better outcomes for 
the hypnotherapy treatments than control (table 2). In all 
groups, total medical costs diminished between base 
line 
and 12 months. At 3 months and 12 months, patients in 
all groups reported less IBS-related work absence, less 
work hindrance, and a better work efficiency compared 
with baseline (table 2), with no significant differences 
between groups (table 4). In the intention-to-treat analysis 
of secondary outcomes, we found no significant 
differences between the combined hypno 
therapy treat-
ments and control (table 4), and the per-protocol analysis 
showed no differences between the mean scores in the 
two hypnotherapy groups at either 3 months or 12 months 
(table 5).
At 3 months and at 12 months, patients referred from 
secondary care had a higher chance of being a responder 
after hypnotherapy than did those referred from primary 
care (appendix p 2). Additional analysis of patients 
referred from primary versus secondary care showed that 
the two groups did not differ in IBS subtype, IBS-SSS 
score, or IBS-QOL score at baseline, but patients referred 
from secondary care had significantly higher scores on 
the SCL-90 subscales somatisation, insufficiency of 
thought and action, distrust and interpersonal sensitivity, 
and hostility (appendix p 3).
In the subgroup analysis by IBS symptom severity and 
IBS subtype, no statistically significant differences in 
treatment efficacy were found for primary outcome 
measures at either time point (appendix p 2).

Discussion
In our randomised controlled trial of patients with IBS 
referred from primary and secondary care, 3 months 
of treatment with hypno 
therapy was more effective 
than an educational control intervention. In addition, 
hypnotherapy delivered in a group format was non-
inferior 
to 
individually 
delivered 
hypnotherapy. 
Differences in treatment effect persisted after 9 months 
of follow-up. Patients in both hypno 
therapy groups and 
in the control group also showed improvements in 
quality of life, psychological complaints, cognitions, and 
self-efficacy, and direct and indirect medical costs 
diminished. However, between-group differences were 
not significant. Furthermore, treatment effects were 
more pronounced in patients referred from secondary 
care, who appeared to have higher psycho 
logical problem 
scores, but we found no significant differences between 
subgroups according to symptom severity and IBS 
subtype.
To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised 
controlled trial of hypno 
therapy for IBS to date.7,10 
Whereas previous studies were limited by a lack of 
heterogeneity among patients with IBS, potentially 
affecting the generalisability of the results,41 patients 
included in our study were recruited from both primary 
and secondary care across the Netherlands.
In this trial, we not only assessed the effectiveness of 
hypnotherapy compared with a high-quality control 
inter 
vention, but also tested whether group-delivered 
hypno 
therapy was non-inferior to individually delivered 
therapy. Given the general shortage of therapists, group 
therapy could facilitate broader implementation of 
hypnotherapy in daily clinical practice.
We chose the adequate relief questionnaire as the 
primary outcome measure, because this subjective out-
come adequately reflects the effect of IBS symptoms on 
individual patients, independently of symptom severity. 
In functional disorders, the perception of sym 
ptoms is as 
important as actual symptom severity.42 In our trial, 
better adequate relief scores were not accompanied by 
significant improvements in IBS symptom scores. The 
explanation for this finding might be that, in contrast to 
educational 
therapy, 
hypnotherapy 
improves 
the 
perception of IBS symptoms without having a major 
effect on symptom severity.43 Thus, the main effect of 
hypnotherapy might be diminishing the impact of 
symptoms on patients by changing their mind-set and 
improving internal coping mechanisms.
In our study, we used a well designed control inter-
vention. In line with recommendations, we constructed an 
intervention that did not involve hypnotherapy but was 
similar in all other treatment components: time, attention, 
active intervention, and contact with therapist.15,44,45 This 
informative educational programme covered relevant 
topics and information gaps of patients with IBS.20–23
There were several limitations to the study. First, it was 
embedded in routine clinical practice, which increases 
the validity and generalisability of the results, but also 
affects the conduct of the study. Four (1%) patients were 
included in the study incorrectly. Furthermore, eight (2%) 
patients were found, post hoc, to have been incorrectly 
diagnosed with IBS. This proportion is within the

reported range of patients misdiagnosed with IBS (who 
have other gastrointestinal diseases causing the symp-
toms) according to Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines.46 
The presumptions used for the power calculation in this 
study might have been suboptimal. The presumed 
hypnotherapy response rate might have been too high 
and the estimate of the response in the control group too 
low, based on the results of a larger study on placebo 
effects.47 Additionally 27 patients (8% overall) withdrew 
from the intervention after random 
isation, and a 
substantial number of the question 
naires sent out after 
3 months and 12 months were not returned. Therefore, 
in line with existing recom 
mendations, we imputed 
missing (baseline) data and did extensive sensitivity 
analyses to ensure the validity of the results.38 Although 
results from these analyses were very similar, a bias due 
to withdrawal and non-response, especially for the non-
inferiority comparison, cannot be fully excluded. We also 
did not assess patients’ expectations and hopes regarding 
therapy before commencing it. The effect of treatment is 
largely deter 
mined by the combination of patients’ 
expected symptom relief and desire for symptom 
relief.48,49 For optimal comparison in studies investigating 
psycho 
logical treatment for IBS, the expectations of 
patients in the control group should be similar to those 
of patients in the active intervention arm. We suggest 
that future trials should map the expectations of patients 
in all trial groups before starting the intervention.
In our study, we chose the number of weeks with 
adequate symptom relief as the primary outcome. 
Previous studies that used IBS-SSS score as the primary 
outcome reported greater therapeutic effects on IBS 
symptoms compared with our results: in previous 
studies, mean scores improved from before therapy to 
after therapy, from 338 to 158,12 329·2 to 165·4,14 
259 to 196,46 and 317·8 to 189·0.47 In our study, these 
scores improved from 293·0 at baseline to 254·3 after 
3 months and 234·8 after 12 months. One study reported 
a reduction of 50 points or more on the IBS-SSS after 
treatment in 76% of patients.14 A possible explanation for 
these differences in scores might be differences in 
patient selection. Previous studies used Rome I criteria 
(1990) or Rome II criteria (1999), whereas we used the 
Rome III criteria (2006), which require fewer days with 
complaints for a diagnosis than did previous versions.50 
In addition, most previous studies have been done in 
tertiary-care settings, where baseline symptom scores 
have been higher, and there is some evidence that 
patients 
with 
higher 
scores 
respond 
better

hypnotherapy. In a study in patients with IBS in primary 
care who received five sessions of hypnotherapy in 
addition to usual management, no significant differences 
in symptoms or quality of life over 12 months were 
observed in comparison with usual management only.51 
However, despite the absence of symptomatic improve-
ment as measured by the IBS-SSS, most patients in the 
intervention group reported an improvement in their 
condition. In another study, in which patients from 
secondary care either received 12 sessions of hypno-
therapy or were placed on a waiting list, the two groups 
did not differ significantly at 3 months with regard to 
symptoms or quality of life.52 In that study, the patients 
receiving hypnotherapy also reported very positive 
experiences in terms of general wellbeing and better 
coping with their symptoms. The results of our trial 
confirm the observation that, despite the absence of 
effect on IBS symptom severity, patients with IBS in 
primary and secondary care experience generalised 
improvement from hypnotherapy. This might be 
explained by the fact that, in contrast to more severe 
cases seen in tertiary care, hypnotherapy results in a 
more positive experience in terms of a better coping style 
in patients from primary and secondary care, although 
actual symptom severity does not change.
In three previous studies, therapy consisted of 
12 hypnotic sessions,12,14,53 whereas one study54 used 
seven sessions, and our study used six sessions. In 
addition, therapists in the Manchester group have more 
than 5 years’ experience with IBS-focused hypnotherapy,14 
whereas most of the hypnotherapists in our study did not

have specific experience with IBS. Although the hypno-
therapists were experienced clinical psycho 
logists who 
were trained by the principal investigator in gut-directed 
hypnotherapy, according to a standardised manual, we 
cannot exclude that inexperience of these therapists 
resulted in an underestimation of the effect of 
hypnotherapy. There is reasonably good evidence that 
hypnotherapy is effective in patients with treatment-
refractory IBS seen in tertiary care, and NICE recom-
mends hypnotherapy in patients not responding to 
pharmacological and dietary interventions. Within this 
group of tertiary-care patients, those with higher 
symptom severity scores tend to respond better to 
hypnotherapy, probably because such patients have a 
more complex form of the disorder to which additional 
psychological factors contribute. Furthermore, these 
patients are more likely to fully engage in this time-
consuming form of treatment, which is often perceived 
as the last chance for improvement of the disease. It is, 
therefore, perhaps unsurprising that hypnotherapy was 
not as effective in our study, in which patients had less 
complex disease than do those in tertiary care. The 
SCL-90 scores of patients in our study were around the 
average level seen in patients in general practice;31 thus, 
their psychological status was the same as that of the 
consulting population in primary care. Compared with 
mean scores of psychiatric patients, all three groups had 
below average scores on most SCL-90 dimensions, except 
for the somatisation and sleep disturbance scales. The 
high somatisation score in patients with IBS was 
previously reported in a systematic review.55 In the 
SCL-90, as well as in the other secondary outcomes, the 
absence of significantly greater improvement in the 
hypnotherapy group than in the control group might be 
due to lower scores at baseline on these questionnaires 
than those of patients in tertiary care in other studies.
Some earlier studies on group hypnotherapy for IBS 
showed better results than did the current study.16,54,56 
This difference might be related to the fact that we 
adhered strictly to practising the hypnotherapy exercises, 
whereas others combined hypnotherapy with the 
opportunity to discuss questions and share information 
about IBS. Education on IBS and hypnosis might both 
independently contribute to the treatment effect. In 
clinical practice, a stepped-care approach, in which 
patients receive education as a first step and hypnosis as 
second step, could be a way to further optimise the 
treatment effect.
In the subgroup analysis, we found a difference in 
effect between patients referred by a specialist (secondary 
care) and those referred by their general practitioner 
(primary care). Additional analysis suggested a difference 
in psychological complaints, but not in symptom severity, 
between the groups. Whitehead and colleagues,57 
suggested a dual-aetiology hypothesis, which divides 
patients with IBS into those whose “symptoms primarily 
have a biological basis and others whose symptoms 
primarily have a psychological basis”. Hypnotherapy 
might work best for patients with more psychological 
complaints. In future research on the effect of 
hypnotherapy, stratification according to psychological 
symptoms should be considered.
In conclusion, using a global outcome measure, this 
study showed that both individual and group hypno-
therapy are significantly more effective than control 
treat 
ment, although all three treatments reduced symp-
tom severity. This observation highlights the complexity 
of IBS symptomatology, in which the patient’s perception 
of their illness has a marked effect on their experience. 
In addition, we have shown that group hypno 
therapy is 
non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy, making it a 
practical proposition for use in primary care. Future 
research should focus on the optimal number of 
sessions, the effect that the patient’s expectations have 
on the final outcome, and on the predictive value of 
psychological symptoms for the outcome of hypno-
therapy.
