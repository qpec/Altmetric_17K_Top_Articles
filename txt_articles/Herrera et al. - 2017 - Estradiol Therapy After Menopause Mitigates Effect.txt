Context: Postmenopausal estradiol therapy (ET) can reduce the stress response. However, it remains
unclear whether such reductions can mitigate effects of stress on cognition.
Objective: Investigate effects of ET on cortisol response to a physical stressor, cold pressor test (CPT),
and whether ET attenuates stress effects on working memory.
Design: Women completed the CPT or control condition across two sessions and subsequently
completed a sentence span task.
Setting: General community: Participants were recruited from the Early vs Late Intervention Trial
with Estradiol (ELITE).
Participants: ELITE participants (mean age = 66, standard deviation age = 6.8) in this study did not
suffer from any major chronic illness or use medications known to affect the stress response or
cognition.
Interventions: Participants had received a median of randomized 4.7 years of estradiol (n = 21) or
placebo (n = 21) treatment at time of participation in this study.
Main Outcome Measures: Salivary cortisol and sentence span task performance.
Results: Women assigned to estradiol exhibited blunted cortisol responses to CPT compared with
placebo (P = 0.017) and lesser negative effects of stress on working memory (P = 0.048).
Conclusions: We present evidence suggesting ET may protect certain types of cognition in the
presence of stress. Such estrogenic protection against stress hormone exposure may prove beneficial
to both cognition and the neural circuitry that maintains and propagates cognitive faculties. (J Clin
Endocrinol Metab 102: 4457–4466, 2017)
E
stradiol therapy (ET) after menopause may protect
women from the deleterious effects of stress exposure
(1), via the hormone’s ability to reduce hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to mental and immune
stressors (2–4). One such deleterious effect of stress is
interference with prefrontal cognitive processes such as
working memory (5). Because ET can reduce the HPA
response to stress, the hormone may also mitigate the
effects of stress on working memory by limiting the
cortisol response to the stressor.

 Evidence from the double-blinded, placebo (PL)-
controlled, randomized Early vs Late Intervention Trial
withEstradiol(ELITE;ClinicalTrials.govno.NCT00114517)
suggests that estradiol treatment, in the absence of stress
threat, does not exert an effect on cognition (6). However, the
ability of ET to reduce the stress response might benefit some
types of cognitive processes when under stress. In particular,
cortisol impairs working memory (7–9). Thus, the ability of
ET to dampen the cortisol response to acute stressors may
mitigate the impairing effect of stress on working memory due
to the attenuated cortisol release. If this is the case, then
maintenance of estradiol levels after menopause with ET may
improve working memory performance under stress.
In this study, we examined how ET affected the stress
response and modulated the effects of acute stress on
working memory. We hypothesized that ET would
decrease the bioavailable cortisol response to stress,
thereby limiting the effects of stress on working memory
performance. In addition, we examined whether there
were differences according to whether ET was initiated
within 6 years of menopause (early initiation) or beyond
10 years of menopause (late initiation). A possible critical
window for hormone therapy (10, 11), related to the
theory of a healthy cell bias for estradiol action (12), may
result in different effects of ET when treatment is initiated
years later past menopause, such as abolishment of the
attenuating effect of HPA reactivity, or even potentiation
of a stress response.
Materials and Methods
Participants
This study was approved by the University of South-
ern California Institutional Review Board. Forty-nine post-
menopausal women were recruited from ELITE, where
participants received either 1 mg oral micronized 17b-estradiol
(E2) daily, or PL, for a median of 5 years. Participants were
enrolled within 6 years of menopause (early initiation) or beyond
10 years of menopause (late initiation), creating four groups:
early initiation-E2, early initiation-PL, late initiation-E2, and late
initiation-PL. The primary outcome of ELITE was the rate of
change in intima-media thickness of the right carotid artery.
Secondary outcomes were (1) cognitive measures, including
verbal memory, executive function, and global cognition, and (2)
development/progression of coronary atherosclerosis measured
by cardiac computed tomography (13).
ELITE participants in this study had received E2 or PL for a
median of 4.7 years at time of participation (see Table 1 for
exclusionary criteria). Women with an intact uterus received
sequential progesterone (45 mg delivered via 4% vaginal gel),
or a PL-matched gel if assigned to PL, daily for 10 days in each
30-day cycle. Women were instructed to take their medication
upon awakening with brushing teeth or breakfast. Our study
sample included three women with unilateral oophorectomies
(one with accompanying hysterectomy) and two women with a
hysterectomy without oophorectomy.
Sessions
Participants completed one stress and one control session,
order counterbalanced. All women provided written informed
consent at the beginning of their first session. Of 49 women
enrolled in the study, 42 (n = 21 E2; n = 21 PL) completed both
sessions and were included in the analyses (participant attrition/
withdrawal explained in Table 1). At both sessions, participants
provided
saliva
samples,
completed
questionnaires,
and
completed a working memory task (see Fig. 1A for session
timing protocol).
Sessions for this study took place when women attended
their ELITE research clinic sessions between the hours 7:00 to
14:00. Although desirable to conduct stress studies in the af-
ternoons to control for the diurnal cortisol rhythm, it has been
shown that although baseline free cortisol levels are affected by
time of day, the magnitude of the cortisol response to laboratory
stress does not differ in the morning or afternoon (22).
Hormone sampling
Bioavailable levels of free cortisol, estradiol, and proges-
terone were measured in saliva (23, 24). Participants refrained
from exercise and food/drink (except water) within 1 hour, sleep
within 2 hours, and caffeine and alcohol within 3 hours of their
session start time.
Baseline cortisol levels follow a diurnal cycle (25), with peak
baseline levels occurring 30 minutes after waking (26). To avoid

 seeing women during the acrophase, women were told to
awaken at least 2 hours prior to their appointment start time. To
verify participants had been awake for the minimum amount of
time, at the beginning of each session, they were asked what time
they woke up.
The baseline sample was collected via passive drool and was
processed for free cortisol and sex hormone levels. The post-
stress sample was processed for free cortisol only and was
collected using two sponge sorbettes (bvi Visitec, Wallham,
MA). Sorbettes were placed in participants’ mouths, one at a
time, and remained in the mouth until the sponge was ade-
quately moist. Participants were told to not chew or suck on the
sponge. Sorbettes were then placed in a tube for storage and
frozen. Samples were packaged and transported frozen in dry ice
to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified
analytical laboratories (Salimetrics, LLC, State College, PA),
where samples were processed using enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay. Lower limits of detection were ,0.007 mg/dL for
cortisol, 0.1 pg/mL for estradiol, and 5 pg/mL for progesterone.
All samples were processed in duplicate. Interassay and intra-
assay variations were 4.4% and 5.0% for cortisol, 3.9% and
6.9% for estradiol, and 5.0% and 9.1% for progesterone.
Stress manipulation
Participants completed the cold pressor test (CPT) or control
across the two sessions. The CPT is a physical stressor that has
been shown to induce cortisol secretion (27). Participants
submerged their nondominant hand, up to the wrist, in ice water
(0°C to 5°C immediately before hand immersion) for as long as
possible up to 3 minutes. The control condition used warm
water (37°C to 40°C immediately before hand immer-
sion). Order of the CPT and control sessions was randomly
counterbalanced.
Subjective measures of stress and pain before and
after CPT
Participants completed pre– and post–hand-immersion pain
and stress ratings using visual analog scales. Immediately before
immersing their hand in water, participants rated how much
pain they were currently feeling and how much stress they were
currently feeling, from none to most possible. Immediately after
removing their hand from the water, participants completed
two additional ratings for the peak amount of stress and pain
felt while their hand was in the water, again from none to
most possible.
Working memory: sentence span task
The working memory task began ~21.5 minutes after stress
onset. Sentences were presented one at a time on a computer
screen, via PsyScope (28). Participants were told to remember
the last word of each sentence. After presentation of a sentence,
participants reported whether the sentence made semantic and
syntactic sense. At the end of each load, participants were asked
to recall the last word of each sentence in that load. “Makes
sense” and “Nonsense” judgments were recorded by key press
on a computer keyboard, while word recall was recorded on a
paper scoring sheet by the experimenter (see Fig. 1B for sentence
Figure 1. (A) General protocol and timing of all sessions, relative to cold pressor test (CPT) onset. Order of first CPT condition (cold or warm
water) counterbalanced. A subset of negative, positive, and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (16) was used in the
emotional picture slideshow. Emotional picture slideshow occurred between the CPT and the working memory task. It was expected that the
emotional picture slideshow would not affect the magnitude of the free cortisol response to CPT, as viewing International Affective Picture
System does not elicit increases in salivary cortisol levels (17). (B) Sentence span protocol and timing. Sentences were collected from various
sources and have been used in similar tasks (18–20). Nonsense sentences were created by inverting the four words just before the final word of
a sentence as done in Turner and Engle (21). Sentences were presented on the center of the screen with the last word in all capital letters (e.g.,
The boy said HELLO) for 5 seconds. Immediately after sentence presentation, participants made “Makes sense” and “Nonsense” judgments
before seeing the next sentence. Participants completed 13 blocks. Blocks 1 and 2 were practice and consisted of one-sentence and two-
sentence loads, respectively. At the end of each block, the participant was prompted to tell the experimenter the last word of the one or two
sentences just viewed, in the order they were presented. The remainder of the task proceeded in the same fashion and included four blocks of
two-sentence load, three blocks of three-sentence load, and two blocks each of four-, five-, and six-sentence loads.

 span timing and protocol). Loads spanned from two to six
sentences.
A lenient scoring criterion was used; women were given
one point for each word they remembered whether or not
they recalled the words in the order presented. This task took
~11 minutes to complete. Participants saw different sentences at
each session.
Statistical analysis
To examine subjective effects of CPT, we conducted separate
2 (stress: CPT vs control) 3 2 (treatment: estradiol vs PL) 3 2
(initiation: early vs late) mixed-model analyses of variance
(ANOVAs)
on
post–hand-immersion
minus
pre–hand-
immersion difference scores for stress and pain ratings. To
examine cortisol response, we conducted a 2 (stress: CPT vs
control) 3 2 (time: baseline vs 15-minute poststress onset) 3 2
(treatment: estradiol vs PL) 3 2 (initiation: early vs late)
mixed-model ANOVA on free cortisol response to stress.
Sentence span loads were divided into low and high loads: The
average proportion of words recalled in two- and three-
sentence loads (low load) and in the four-, five-, and six-
sentence loads (high load) were dependent variables in a 2
(stress: CPT vs control) 3 2 (load: low load vs high load) 3 2
(treatment: estradiol vs PL) 3 2 (initiation: early vs late)
mixed-model ANOVA. Additional post hoc independent and
paired t tests were conducted where appropriate. Boxplots did
uncover outliers; however, removal of these data did not
change the overall presented results. For this reason, all data
have been included in the analyses. Outliers have been depicted
in the figures, and any differences in results have been de-
scribed in the respective figure caption.
Results
Hormone levels and demographics
As expected, women receiving ET had significantly
higher E2 levels than women receiving PL [mean dif-
ference (Mdiff) = 46.52 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 9.37 to 83.66]. Groups did not differ in their pro-
gesterone levels [Mdiff = –12.85 pg/mL; 95% CI, –77.63
to 51.92]. ET and PL did not differ in any demographic
information, verbal intelligence, negative affect, positive
affect, or depression scores during the sessions (Table 2).
Pre- and post-CPT stress and pain ratings
Participants found the CPT more stressful than the
control task as shown by higher stress rating difference
scores (post–hand-immersion rating minus pre–hand-
immersion rating) in the CPT than the control condi-
tion [F(1,38) = 53.255; P , 0.001; hp
2 = 0.584; Mdiff
(CPT-control) = 42.6; 95% CI, 30.8 to 54.4]. With this
same measure, ET participants reported larger increases
in subjective stress than PL participants [F(1,38) = 6.170;
P = 0.018; hp
2 = 0.140; Mdiff = 11.6; 95% CI, 2.1 to 21.1].
Timing of initiation of randomized treatment relative to
menopause had no effect on the stress ratings difference
scores in the control or CPT sessions (P . 0.05; see
Fig. 2A).
Compared with control, CPT also led to significantly
higher pain rating difference scores (post–hand-immersion
rating minus pre–hand-immersion rating) [F(1,38) =
94.852; P , 0.001; hp
2 = 0.714; Mdiff (CPT-control) =
51.9; 95% CI, 41.1 to 62.6] with increases during the
CPT session and decreases in the control session.
Randomized treatment and time of initiation relative to
menopause had no effect on the pain ratings in either the
control or CPT sessions (P . 0.05; Fig. 2B).
Cortisol response to CPT
The working memory task occurred ~21 minutes after
stress onset, when free cortisol levels typically begin to
peak (33). Saliva was collected immediately prior to
behavioral tasks. Cortisol analyses focused on this time
frame to test differences in approximate peak levels.
Free cortisol levels significantly increased in the CPT
session, not the control session [F(1,38) = 4.358; P =
0.044; hp
2 = 0.103; Mdiff = 0.035 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.001
to 0.070]. A time by stress interaction [F(1,38) = 11.486;
P = 0.002; hp
2 = 0.232] revealed cortisol levels increased
only in response to CPT. There was a significant in-
teraction of time and treatment [F(1,38) = 6.266; P =
0.017; hp
2 = 0.142] with an increase in cortisol over time
only observed in PL. Neither treatment nor initiation
factors significantly affected free cortisol levels during the
CPT or control sessions.
Analysis of the CPT session alone, collapsed across
initiation groups, confirmed the previous patterns. Free
cortisol levels increased from pre- to post-CPT [F(1,40) =
8.960; P = 0.005; hp
2 = 0.183; Mdiff = 0.058 mg/dL; 95%
CI, 0.019 to 0.097]. A time-by-treatment interaction
[F(1,40) = 4.368; P = 0.043; hp
2 = 0.098] was driven by PL
participants experiencing significant increases in free
cortisol [t(20) = 2.921; P = 0.008; Mdiff = 0.098 mg/dL;
95% CI, 0.028 to 0.169] and ET participants experi-
encing no change in cortisol levels [t(20) = 0.916; P .
0.05; Mdiff = 0.018 mg/dL; 95% CI, –0.022 to 0.057]
(Fig. 3). The same analysis testing the control session
revealed no main effects or interactions (Fig. 3).
Working memory
CPT decreased word recall working memory perfor-
mance compared with control [F(1,38) = 7.083; P =
0.011; hp
2 = 0.157; Mdiff = –0.043; 95% CI, –0.075 to
–0.010], as did increasing loads [F(1,38) = 231.648; P ,
0.001; hp
2 = 0.859; Mdiff = –0.204; 95% CI, –0.231 to
–0.177] (Fig. 4). An initiation by load interaction
[F(1,38) = 4.981; P = 0.032; hp
2 = 0.116] revealed a pattern
of larger decreases in performance as load increased in
late-initiation than early-initiation groups. A three-way

 interaction of stress, load, and treatment [F(1,38) =
4.168; P = 0.048; hp
2 = 0.099] showed that although
both ET and PL had poorer performance on high
loads than low loads, ET participants did not differ in
their performance after CPT or the control condition in
either load, whereas PL participants showed poorer
performance on low loads after CPT compared with the
control condition (Fig. 4). Neither treatment nor initi-
ation exerted main effects.
When ET participants were tested alone, decreased
performance as load increased was confirmed in both
CPT and control sessions [F(1,20) = 66.046; P , 0.001;
hp
2 = 0.768; Mdiff = –0.203; 95% CI, –0.255 to –0.151].
However, CPT did not significantly affect performance
[F(1,20) = 2.581; P . 0.05; hp
2 = 0.114; Mdiff = –0.032;
95% CI, –0.074 to 0.010]. In contrast, when PL par-
ticipants were tested alone, CPT impaired performance
[F(1,20) = 4.856; P = 0.039; hp
2 = 0.195; Mdiff = –0.054;
95% CI, –0.105 to –0.003], as did increases in load
[F(1,20) = 233.605; P , 0.001; hp
2 = 0.921; Mdiff = –0.203;
95% CI, –0.231 to –0.176]. A stress by load interaction
[F(1,20) = 5.770; P = 0.026; hp
2 = 0.224] indicated
that CPT exerted its effect on the low-load blocks,
with performance on low-load blocks worse after CPT
[t(20)= –3.219; P = 0.004; Mdiff = –0.09; 95% CI, –0.15
to –0.03], whereas performance on high-load blocks
remained the same across CPT and control sessions
[t(20) = –0.595; P . 0.05; Mdiff = –0.02; 95% CI, –0.08
to 0.04].
t tests showed ET and PL groups performed similarly
on low-load blocks during the control session, but that
ET performed significantly better than PL participants
during the CPT session [t(40) = 2.350; P = 0.024; Mdiff =
0.11; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.20] (Fig. 4). Similar analyses
comparing performance on high-load blocks revealed no
differences between ET and PL participants during the
control session [t(40) = 1.514; P . 0.05; Mdiff = 0.09;
95% CI, –0.03 to 0.21] or CPT [t(40) = 1.232; P . 0.05;
Mdiff = 0.06; 95% CI, –0.04 to 0.17].
Discussion
Previous research among women has shown that short-
term random assignment to estrogen therapy decreases
cortisol responses to stressors (34, 35). Our study ex-
tends these findings, providing evidence that long-term
ET after menopause can reduce the free cortisol response
to a physical stressor, with similar effects regardless as
to whether treatment is initiated within or beyond 6 years
of menopause. Our findings also extend the cognitive

 findings reported from ELITE (6). In ELITE, when
women were tested in the absence of threat, ET failed to
influence cognitive performance regardless of when ET
was initiated. Results in the control session of our study
support this finding. However, our study also shows that
ET can exert a beneficial effect on cognition after an
episode of acute stress.
Although our primary hypotheses were supported,
an unexpected finding was the larger increase in subjective
stress ratings in the ET as compared with the PL condi-
tion, as reflected in the post– minus pre–hand-immersion
difference scores (Fig. 2A). This finding may speak to the
robust nature of the E2 effect on the free cortisol response.
Despite ET women reporting higher levels of subjective
stress, these women still showed significantly lower free
cortisol responses to the physical stressor than did their PL
counterparts.
We also tested effects of ET on working memory
during stress. Both hydrocortisone administration (8)
and psychological stressors (5) impair working mem-
ory performance. We hypothesized that by decreasing
free cortisol responses to stress, ET should also protect

sessions. Women completed visual analog scales for subjective stress ratings immediately before and immediately after immersing their hand in
water in both sessions. Difference scores were calculated by subtracting pre–hand-immersion ratings from post–hand-immersion ratings, thus
positive values indicate an increase in stress and negative values indicate a decrease in stress. There were main effects of stress condition and
treatment, with no other main effects or interactions. Five outliers were detected for stress rating difference scores during the control session.

 working memory from stress-induced impairment.
Indeed, random assignment to ET reduced the stress
response and prevented stress-induced decrements in
working memory performance, whereas assignment to
PL did not prevent stress-induced decrements. This ET
protection was limited to the low-load working mem-
ory blocks, which may have been due to a floor ef-
fect reducing our ability to see stress impairments in the

condition and a significant time 3 stress condition interaction, with an increase over time in the CPT session, and no change in the control

of stress condition and load, as well as a load 3 initiation interaction and stress condition 3 load 3 treatment interaction. All women performed
worse on high-load blocks than low-load blocks regardless of session. ET and PL performed similarly on low-load blocks during the control
session; however, ET performed significantly better than PL during the CPT session. ET also performed similarly in both the control and CPT
sessions, whereas PL performed worse in the CPT session than the control session. ET and PL performed similarly on high-load blocks during both
the control and CPT sessions. Four outliers were detected for working memory performance during the stress session: one in the low load and
three in the high load. Removal of these outliers resulted in the following differences: (1) in the overall ANOVA, the load by time-of-initiation
interaction is no longer significant; (2) the main effect of stress was no longer significant in the PL-only analyses, although all other interactions
and follow-up analyses remained the same; and (3) the significant follow-up independent t test showing differences between ET and PL women

 high-load blocks, as women generally performed worse
on the high-load blocks regardless of treatment group,
initiation group, or CPT vs control session.
One interpretation for the pattern of higher pre– to
post–hand-immersion stress ratings with lower cortisol
responses to CPT could be that ET women were expe-
riencing chronic stress, which has been shown to blunt
cortisol responses to acute stressors (36). Chronic stress
leading to blunted cortisol responses also is associated
with elevated baseline cortisol levels (36), which may
contribute to the blunted stress responses through a
ceiling effect. However, because ET and PL women did
not differ in their baseline levels and PL women reached
numerically higher levels of cortisol post hand immersion
in the CPT session, we do not believe our observation is
driven by this mechanism. Further, ET and PL women did
not differ in their perceived stress at the beginning of each
session (Table 2). Not only did ET and PL women not
differ in their subjective rating for stress level that day,
both groups reported stress levels on the lower end at
each session, with average ratings for each group at each
session ranging from 2.4 to 3.6 (maximum of 9).
Instead, it is possible that corticosteroid binding globulin
(CBG) can explain the blunting effect of E2 on the stress
response and the subsequent prevention of stress-induced
decrements in working memory. Cortisol primarily binds to
CBG, leaving only 5% to 10% available to act on tissue
(37). Estradiol has been shown to increase CBG in plasma
(38), which could account for the lower free cortisol levels in
response to stress in ET, despite reporting larger changes in
subjective stress from immediately before to immediately
after CPT exposure. Further, as E2-induced CBG upregu-
lation binds more of the released cortisol, less cortisol is left
available to act on tissue, including prefrontal cortical re-
gions integral to working memory (39).
The ability of ET to reduce the HPA response to
a variety of stressors also has important implications
beyond attenuating acute stress-induced decrements in
cognitive performance. Aging has been associated with
hyperactive dysfunction of the HPA axis in response to
stress (40). The dysfunction is attributed to a reduced
ability of the primary negative feedback source in the
brain, the hippocampus, to dampen the HPA response to
acute stressors. This failure leads to prolonged gluco-
corticoid secretion and exposure, causing additional re-
ceptor loss in the hippocampus and further inability to
effectively dampen the HPA response to future stressors.
In addition to prolonged exposure of glucocorticoids
leading to receptor loss, prolonged stress exposure leads
to hippocampal degeneration (41), as well as prefron-
tal cortical degeneration (42). Importantly, due to the
heavy involvement of these regions in cognition, it is
possible that degradation resulting from age-related
hyperactivation of the HPA axis may impair cognitive
processes.
However, the ability of ET to reduce cortisol response
to acute stressors may prevent this age-related hyper-
activation of the HPA axis (43) by preventing bouts of
prolonged HPA responses to acute stressors. Protection of
the brain via ET may be twofold, as E2 can directly protect
neuronal tissue from various neurotoxic insults, including
glucocorticoids (44). Thus, whether via upregulation of
CBG, protecting brain regions in the face of HPA dysre-
gulation, or other mechanisms, ET-induced reductions to
cortisol exposure may delay or minimize the age-related
dysfunction of the axis and any potential cognitive effects
related to hyperactivation-induced neuronal damage. On
the other hand, the rapid and dramatic decline in E2 levels
during menopause may leave women more vulnerable to
the detrimental effects of stress hormone exposure on
HPA, neural, and cognitive integrity.
Although our hypotheses regarding effects of treat-
ment on stress response and stress effects on cognition
were supported, we found time-of-treatment initiation
relative to menopause only affected performance on high-
load blocks. Because we found no interaction between E2
and time of initiation on load, it appears that the effect of
initiation on load simply reflected the age difference
between groups (Table 2) rather than an effect of time of
ET initiation. Such failure to find any treatment by ini-
tiation interactions could indicate that a critical window
for ET administration does not apply to all physiologi-
cal and cognitive domains; however, the lack of inter-
action may also result from one of the limitations of this
study. Eligibility criteria for this study were quite strin-
gent, requiring women recruited from ELITE to be free
from cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairment
and not using b-adrenergic, corticosteroid, or psycho-
active (e.g., antidepressants, antianxiolytics, or Adderall)
medications. Thus, despite older age in the late-initiation
treatment group, these women lacked serious illness,
including cardiovascular conditions associated with ag-
ing, such as prior myocardial infarction. Based on the
premise of the healthy cell bias theory (12), the good
health of our sample may have translated to reduced age-
related brain changes and placed them in a category
above the threshold of decline or damage, protecting
them from the potentially deleterious effects of E2 on
cognitive function observed in at-risk populations (45).
Replication with a larger sample is important to
confirm these effects. It also is unclear if other executive
functions, or cognitive domains not encompassing ex-
ecutive function, are offered the same protection under
stress. A prior study examined a set of cognitive functions
such as vigilance and episodic memory and found that
older women (average age 65) who had 3 months of E2

 supplementation as well as social stress before testing
showed worse performance than those who experienced
social stress without prior E2 supplementation. It is
possible that performance on these tasks benefits from
stress, and by reducing the stress response, E2 attenuated
those benefits. However, there was no stress-free com-
parison group, which limits conclusions (46). We also
included no measures of total (bound and unbound)
cortisol levels, which would be beneficial in elucidating
which mechanisms might be involved in E2-induced re-
ductions of free cortisol levels after stress exposure.
Despite theselimitations, thisstudysuggeststhereareother
roles of ET besides relief from menopause-related symptoms,
including limiting effects of stress on working memory and
perhaps aiding in maintenance of proper HPA reactivity.
With the growing interest in estrogens that limit the negative
effects of ET, such as selective estrogen receptor modula-
tors (47) and the tissue-selective estrogen complex (48), ET
after menopause may become a more feasible treatment of
symptoms and a preventative strategy against a host of other
health-related declines observed to increase after menopause,
including age-related dysfunction of the HPA axis and the
associated neural damage caused by such dysfunction.
