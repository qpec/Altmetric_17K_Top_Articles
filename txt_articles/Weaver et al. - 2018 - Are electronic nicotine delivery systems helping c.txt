Abstract
Background
The potential of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to reduce the cardiovascular
and other disease risks of smoking is of great interest. While many smokers report using
ENDS for cessation, their impact under real-world use patterns and conditions on adult
smokers’ quitting behavior is uncertain. The objective of this study was to generate more
recent and comprehensive evidence on the effect of “real world” ENDS use on the popula-
tion quit rates of adult smokers while taking account of frequency and duration of use, device
type, e-liquid flavor, and reasons for use.
Methods and findings
We conducted a population-based, prospective cohort study of a random probability sample
of 1284 U.S. adult smokers recruited in August/September 2015 and re-contacted one-year
later (September 2016) from GfK’s KnowledgePanel, a national, probability-based web-
panel designed to be representative of non-institutionalized U.S. adults. Among the 1081
baseline smokers who remained members of KnowledgePanel, 858 completed the follow-
up survey. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence for at least 30 days prior to follow-
up. Secondary outcomes were making a quit attempt during the 12-month study period and
number of cigarettes smoked per day at follow-up. The adjusted odds of quitting smoking
were lower for those that used ENDS at baseline (9.4%, 95% CI = 5.22%-16.38%; AOR =
0.30, 95% CI = 0.13–0.72) compared to smokers who did not use at ENDS (18.9%, 95%
CI = 14.24%-24.68%). Smokers who used ENDS daily at some point during the study period
were also less likely to quit smoking than nonusers (AOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.04–0.82).

Conclusions
We found no evidence that ENDS use, within context of the 2015–2016 US regulatory and
tobacco/vaping market landscape, helped adult smokers quit at rates higher than smokers
who did not use these products. Absent any meaningful changes, ENDS use among adult
smokers is unlikely to be a sufficient solution to obtaining a meaningful increase in popula-
tion quit rates. Additional research is needed to reconcile the divergent literature and monitor
the impact of ENDS in an environment of rapidly evolving markets and regulatory policies.
Introduction
Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have generated significant interest for their
potential cardiovascular effects, as well as their potential to reduce the cardiovascular disease
and other health risks of smoking [1–8]. Whereas several tobacco control experts have
expressed support for the harm reduction potential of ENDS [9–20], a spirited debate has
ensued [21–25]. Two of the central pillars on which the harm reduction argument rests are: (a)
use of ENDS is substantially less harmful than smoking cigarettes and (b) their use leads to
higher population-level smoking quit rates [6,13,26–30]. Although more research is necessary
before the full extent of the risks from ENDS use are known [31,32], the extant research sug-
gests that use of ENDS is likely substantially less harmful than smoking combustible cigarettes
[25,33–37], with most debate focusing on how much less harmful [28]. Reduced risk, however,
is insufficient for achieving population-level harm reduction without effecting switching from
a higher risk to a lower risk product. Nearly one-half of smokers reported having ever tried
and approximately one in six currently using ENDS in 2014 [38], with more recent data sug-
gesting these numbers increased in 2015 [39]. Quitting and/or reducing the harms of smoking
are cited as the main reasons smokers use ENDS [40], and some smokers have credited ENDS
with helping them to successfully quit smoking [41,42]. Two randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), conducted in New Zealand and Italy, found limited support for their efficacy in smok-
ing cessation [43,44]. Whereas the effects of ENDS with nicotine compared to placebo (non-
nicotine) ENDS were non-significant in these two studies, the pooled effect was statistically
significant [45]. One of these studies also found higher cessation, though not statistically signif-
icant, for ENDS compared to the nicotine patch; however, participants’ access to products dif-
fered in the two conditions [44]. A recent naturalistic RCT found that, whereas ENDS were
associated with reduced smoking, the numerically positive effect on quit attempts and absti-
nence was not significant [46]. In contrast, two meta-analyses of primarily longitudinal cohort
studies found lower odds of quitting among ENDS users, casting doubt on the claim that
observed declines in U.S. adult population smoking rates can be attributed to ENDS [47,48].
Reflecting the conflicted and nuanced scientific literature, two other meta-analytic studies
with different study-eligibility criteria found either no significant effect [49] or a positive effect
of ENDS use on quitting [50]. However, the quality of extant evidence has been rated very low
in several reviews [45,48,49,51], prompting the US Preventive Services Task Force to conclude
the evidence insufficient to recommend ENDS for smoking cessation [52]. More recently, a
National Academies of Science committee concluded that there “is limited evidence that e-cig-
arettes may be effective aids to promote smoking cessation,” but “there is moderate evidence

 from observation studies that more frequent use of e-cigarettes is associated with an increased
likelihood of cessation” [37].
Well-controlled RCTs can provide critical evidence of the potential of ENDS for effecting
smoking cessation, whereas well-designed longitudinal cohort studies can offer unique and
important insights on the population-level effectiveness of ENDS under “real world” use and
conditions [37,47,53,54]. However, insights gleaned from past longitudinal cohort studies have
been clouded by methodological limitations [21,48,51,53], specifically insufficient attention to
the motivations and intentions for using ENDS, characteristics of the ENDS device related to
the delivery of nicotine, overall user satisfaction, and frequency of use [37,53]. Smokers note
many different reasons for using ENDS [55,56], and accounting for whether they use ENDS pri-
marily to quit smoking or for other reasons (e.g., to use in situations where smoking is not per-
mitted) is important [56,57]. Even when the primary reason for using ENDS is to quit smoking,
certain device types and patterns of use may be more conducive to quitting than others
[36,53,58]. ENDS with nicotine delivery profiles comparable to the combusted cigarette may
better alleviate smokers’ nicotine cravings and serve as a more acceptable alternative for ciga-
rettes. In contrast to disposables and many rechargeable/cartridge-based ENDS, newer and later
generation ENDS that are predominantly open-systems with more powerful batteries have pro-
duced nicotine delivery profiles more comparable to combusted cigarettes [59,60]. However,
the few studies that have examined the effect of device type on quitting smoking have yielded
mixed results [56,61]. Smoking behavior may also be affected by e-liquid flavor, though this
research remains limited [62–65]. To our knowledge, no RCTs and only one prospective cohort
studies of ENDS and smoking have considered the effect of e-liquid flavor despite important
implications for regulatory policy [66]. Results from multiple cross-sectional survey studies
using large, nationally representative samples have provided compelling evidence that frequent
use (daily or at least >5 times in the last month) is associated with recent former smoker status
[67–69]. Two cohort studies have found limited evidence in support of a positive association
between daily ENDS use with subsequent substantial reduction in cigarettes smoked, cessation
attempts, and, for one of these studies, increased quitting if using a tank system, compared to
non-users [61,70]. However, other research has found either no effect of frequency (or device
type) on smoking abstinence [56] or an association of more frequent ENDS use with subsequent
greater quantity and frequency of smoking [71]. Another study found no difference in smoking
abstinence at follow-up between daily ENDS users and non-users; whereas non-daily users
were less likely to be abstinent compared to non-users [72].
In summary, the research on the impact of ENDS use on adult smokers’ quitting remains
inconsistent and methodologically limited. Further, due to the rapid evolution in technology
and marketing of ENDS, along with population shifts in patterns of use [36,57], results of older
studies may not apply to the present [37]. Therefore, the objective of this national, prospective
cohort study is to generate more recent and comprehensive evidence on the effect of “real
world” ENDS use on the population quit rates of adult smokers while addressing key limitations
of prior studies, specifically by taking account of frequency of use, device type, e-liquid flavor,
and reasons for use. We hypothesized that ENDS use among smokers would be prospectively
associated with quitting outcomes after adjusting for baseline differences in potential confound-
ing factors, and this association would depend on device, use patterns, and intensions for use.
Methods
Study design and participants
Participants were recruited from GfK’s KnowledgePanel, a national, probability-based web-
panel designed to be representative of non-institutionalized U.S. adults. For this prospective

 cohort study, a sample of 1284 current, established smokers at baseline was identified among
respondents to the 2015 (August-September) Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions Survey
(TPRPS) for a 12-month follow-up study on their smoking and ENDS use. A study completion
rate of 76.0% was obtained for the baseline survey. In August-October 2016, 1018 baseline cur-
rent smokers who had remained members of GfK KnowledgePanel were invited to complete
the follow-up survey, which yielded 858 respondents (66.8% of the baseline smokers; 84% of
those invited for the follow-up survey). The institutional review board of the Georgia State
University approved this study with a waiver of informed consent.
Outcome variables
The primary outcome variable was smoking abstinence for at least 30 days at follow-up mea-
sured by responding (a) “not at all” to “Do you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or
not at all?” and (b) “no” to “In the past 30 days, have you smoked a cigarette, even one or two
puffs?” Secondary outcome variables were (a) making at least one attempt to quit smoking
completely since the baseline survey, including successful quit attempts, and (b) among those
smoking at follow-up, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD). Detailed infor-
mation about these measures can be found in S1 Table.
Primary ENDS exposure variables
All survey participants were shown preamble text with pictures describing ENDS and their dif-
ferent features. When answering questions about their ENDS use, participants were instructed
to “think only about use of these products without marijuana, marijuana concentrates, mari-
juana waxes, THC, or hash oils.” Current ENDS use at baseline was then assessed by “Do you
now use electronic vapor products every day, some days, rarely, or not at all?” Smokers who
reported using ENDS “every day,” “some days,” or “rarely” were defined as baseline ENDS
users (n = 248), whereas those reporting “not at all,” or, on prior questions never use or no
awareness of ENDS were defined as baseline nonusers (n = 606). In addition, we separately
classified smokers by whether they used ENDS during the study period spanning from baseline
survey to follow-up. Participants who reported current use of ENDS at baseline and/or follow-
up, any past 30-day use of ENDS at follow-up, or any use of ENDS since the baseline survey
were classified as any ENDS users (n = 347), whereas those who reported no current use at
baseline and at follow-up and no use in between baseline and follow-up were classified as non-
users during the study period (n = 507). Those who reported any ENDS use during the
12-month study period were further subdivided as follows: (a) ENDS use at both baseline and
follow-up (n = 129), (b) ENDS use during the study period but not at baseline (n = 53), or (c)
ENDS use at or after baseline but not at follow-up (n = 165). Frequency of ENDS use, impor-
tance of quitting smoking as reason for using ENDS, and ENDS product characteristics (flavor
and device type) were assessed as potential effect modifiers of ENDS use on quitting smoking.
We operationalized each as follows (see S1 Table for more details regarding their
measurement):
1. Smokers who used ENDS were classified as daily ENDS users if they reported daily use of
ENDS or using �25 days during the past 30 days at either baseline or follow-up (n = 53).
2. To assess whether smokers were using ENDS for quitting or for other reasons, they were
asked to indicate how important ENDS were to help them “quit smoking regular cigarettes”
on a 7-point scale (0 = Not at all important to 6 = Very important). Quitting smoking was
considered an important reason for using ENDS if a smoker responded 3 or higher (0 = not
at all important to 6 = very important) (n = 248).

 3. At both baseline and follow-up, ENDS users were asked to indicate among a list of 10 flavor
categories, including “tobacco flavor,” which flavors they usually used (or “last used” if they
were no longer using ENDS at follow-up). They were coded as (a) tobacco flavor or unfla-
vored user if they selected only tobacco flavor or unflavored at baseline and follow-up
(n = 96); (b) a menthol/wintergreen/mint flavor user if they indicated they selected this fla-
vor at baseline or follow-up, but no other flavor other than tobacco flavor or unflavored
(n = 57); (c) other flavor user if they selected any flavor other than tobacco or menthol/win-
tergreen/mint at baseline or follow-up (n = 174).
4. ENDS users were asked at baseline and follow-up if the device they used most of the time
was (a) rechargeable, (b) used cartridges (if rechargeable), or (c) used a tank system (if
rechargeable but did not use cartridges). If they reported using a tank system, they were
classified as a tank user (n = 87); if they reported using a cartridge system but no tank sys-
tem, they were classified as a cartridge user (n = 113); else if were coded as a disposable/
other ENDS user (n = 48).
Adjustment variables
Sociodemographic variables, smoking history and intensity, quit intentions and history, other
combustible tobacco use, physical health, prior mental health treatment, and alcohol use were
identified as potential confounders and measured at baseline. Smoking dependence was mea-
sured separately by (a) intensity of smoking (i.e., average number of cigarettes per day), (b)
perceived addiction to smoking, and (c) strength of cravings to smoke cigarettes. Length of
smoking was measured by number of years smoked. Motivation to quit smoking was mea-
sured separately by (a) reported intentions to quit smoking, (b) number of past-year quit
attempts, (c) prior use of FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation,
and (d) regret having started smoking. Dual/poly combustible tobacco use was measured by
items assessing concurrent use of traditional cigars, little cigars and cigarillos, or hookah.
Other respondent characteristics were measured by questions from profile surveys pre-admin-
istered by GfK to all KnowledgePanel members assessing: (a) physical health (self-reported
physical health status and whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, chronic bronchitis
or COPD); (b) prior mental health treatment (having ever seen a psychiatrist, psychologist, or
social worker for counseling or therapy); (c) past month consumption of alcohol; and (d)
sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, educa-
tion, income). To address potential panel conditioning bias, the number of smoking-related
studies completed by the respondent in the past year was computed by GfK and controlled for
in the analysis. Detailed information about these measures can be found in S1 Table.
Measures of methods used to quit smoking
In order to better interpret results of primary results regressing smoking outcomes on ENDS
exposure variables, we also assessed the methods and resources smokers used in their attempts,
either successful or unsuccessful, to quit smoking. If a participant reported they had
completely quit smoking for good, they were asked “When you quit smoking for good, did you
do any of the following?”: responding yes/no to (a) “gave up cigarettes all at once?” (cold tur-
key); (b) “gradually cut back on cigarettes?”; (c) “switched completely to electronic vapor prod-
ucts, such as. . .?”; (d) “substituted some of my regular cigarettes with electronic vapor
products, such as. . .?”; (e) “used nicotine replacements like the nicotine patch, nicotine gum,
nicotine lozenges, nicotine nasal spray, or nicotine inhaler?”; (f) “used medications like Well-
butrin, Zyban, buproprion, Chantix, or varenicline?”; (g) got counseling, help from a

 telephone help or quit line, a website such as Smokefree.gov, books, pamphlets, videos, a quit
tobacco clinic, class, or support group, or an internet or web-based program, or from a doctor
or other health professional?”; (h) “used little cigars, filtered cigars or cigarillos to quit smoking
cigarettes?”; (i) “used any of the following: traditional cigars, snus, chewing tobacco, dip or
snuff, dissolvables, hookah, or ‘heat-not-burn’ to quit smoking cigarettes?; and (j) “relied on
the support of friends and family to help you quit smoking cigarettes?” If the participant was
still smoking at the follow-up survey, they were asked to report the methods or resources they
had used to try to quit smoking since the baseline survey. Detailed information about these
measures can be found in S1 Table.
Statistical analysis
We first calculated proportions and their 95% confidence intervals for ENDS use at baseline
and for smoking and ENDS use at follow-up among baseline dual users. We then used
weighted logistic regression or weighted general linear models to assess whether ENDS users
were more likely to be smoke daily at baseline and whether they differed on study covariates.
For our primary analyses, associations between ENDS use and binary outcomes (i.e., making a
smoking quit attempt and 30-day smoking abstinence), controlling for potential confounders,
were estimated by adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from weighted logistic
regression models. Weighted general linear models were used to estimate the association
between ENDS use and CPD among those participants still smoking at follow-up, controlling
for potential confounders. For all primary analyses, models were estimated separately for each
operational definition of ENDS exposure (viz., baseline ENDS use vs. nonuse at baseline; any
ENDS use and sub-patterns of any ENDS use vs. no use during the study; by frequency of
ENDS use; by importance of ENDS use for quitting; by flavor use; and by device type). When
the ENDS exposure variable had more than two levels, exploratory pairwise tests were con-
ducted. Furthermore, all primary analyses were repeated while restricting the sample to partic-
ipants who were daily smokers at baseline. Finally, among smokers who reported a quit
attempt during the study, either successful or unsuccessful, we estimated weighted proportions
and associated 95% confidence intervals for each assessed method or resource used during
their quit attempt(s), stratified by their use of ENDS and whether they were 30-day abstinent
from smoking at the follow-up survey.
For all analyses, a study-specific post-stratification weight, based on demographic and geo-
graphic benchmarks from the March 2015 Current Population Survey, was used to adjust all
analyses for sources of sampling and non-sampling error. Missing data were handled using
two different approaches. The first approach involved a complete-case analysis whereby partic-
ipants missing data on one or more variables in a model were excluded from that analysis. A
post-stratification weight variable that adjusts for attrition bias was used with this approach.
For the second approach, we used the Mplus statistical package (v. 8) to generate 50 imputed
datasets based on Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) estimation of an unrestricted
mean and variance covariance model, which included all analysis variables and additional vari-
ables from the baseline survey that were predictive of missingness. The fraction of missing
information ranged .20 to .52 for parameter estimates of key interest to this study. As the gen-
eral pattern of results were similar between the two approaches, results from the complete-case
analysis with weight adjustment for missingness are presented in this paper, and results from
the multiple-imputation approach are presented in S2–S6 Tables. The few instances where dif-
ferences in patterns of statistical significance were observed between the two approaches are
noted in text. A two-tailed α = .05 was set a priori for all analyses, which were conducted using
the Survey package (v. 3.31.5) for the R statistical program (v. 3.4.0) [73,74].

 Results
Descriptive data
Among smokers who completed the follow-up survey, 27.1% (95% CI: 22.6%, 32.0%) reported
using ENDS at baseline. One year later, 90% of dual users were still smoking. Over half (53.5%,
95% CI = 43.5%, 63.1%) continued to smoke and use ENDS, and 37.4% (95% CI = 28.6%,
47.1%) were still smoking but had discontinued ENDS. Only 9.2% (95% CI: 5.1%, 15.8%)
reported having quit smoking at follow-up (Table 1).
We also examined whether those who used ENDS were more likely than non-users to be
daily smokers at baseline. Among smokers who did not use ENDS at baseline, 73.5% (95% CI:
66.8, 81.2%) smoked daily compared 70.5% (95% CI: 60.6, 78.7%) among those who were
using ENDS at baseline (p = .56). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in
the proportion of daily smokers among those who used ENDS at any point during the study
and those that did not: 74.7% (95% CI: 66.8, 81.2%) and 71.4% (64.8, 77.2%), respectively (p =
.50).
Covariate distributions for those that used ENDS at any point during the study and for
non-users are reported in Table 2. Compared to smokers who did not use ENDS, smokers
who used ENDS during the 12-month study were younger (41.5 vs. 45.1 years) and were more
likely to perceive they were addicted to smoking cigarettes (87.7% vs. 78.0% perceived being
somewhat or very addicted); to report a history of psychiatric/psychological therapy (50.1% vs.
38.2%); to use little cigars, cigarillos, or hookah (41.9% vs. 28.2%); to report having a prior
diagnosis of asthma, chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.8% vs.
9.7%); and to report participating in zero tobacco-related surveys hosted by GfK during the
past year. Interestingly, less than one-third of ENDS users and of non-ENDs users (32.8% and
25.9%, respectively; p = .17) reported ever using an approved nicotine replacement therapy or
pharmaceutical drugs to quit smoking. No statistically significant differences were observed at
baseline for quit intentions, number of smoking quit attempts in the past year, smoker regret,
number of years smoking, cigarettes per day smoked, having strong cravings to smoke, or
socio-demographic variables other than age.
Associations between ENDS use and quitting outcomes
While baseline ENDS users did not differ from baseline non-users in their adjusted odds of
making a subsequent smoking quit attempt over the next 12 months (53.7% vs. 48.6%;
AOR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.56–1.77) (Table 3, Model 1a), smokers who reported ENDS use at any
time during the study period had nearly twice the adjusted odds of making a quit attempt as
those who did not use ENDS at all during the same period (58.5% vs. 44.4%; AOR = 1.92, 95%
CI = 1.15–3.19) (Model 2a). This latter association was not statistically significant in analysis of
multiply imputed data (see S3 Table, Model 2).

 lower adjusted odds of quitting smoking than baseline non-users (Model 1a: 9.4% vs. 18.9%;
AOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13–0.72) and those smokers who reported any ENDS use during the
12-month study had 75% lower odds of quitting smoking than non ENDS-users (Model 2a:
7.7% vs. 22.2%; AOR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.11–0.57). Those who reported using ENDS through-
out the study (i.e., at baseline and follow-up) had the lowest adjusted odds of quitting com-
pared to nonusers (4.8%; AOR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01–0.18), as well as those who used ENDS
during the study but had discontinued using them before the follow-up survey (p < .05). Sensi-
tivity analyses were conducted where we either dropped the minimum abstinence period crite-
rion of 30 days or increased it to six months; the general pattern of results remained
consistent.
Turning to analyses of baseline daily smokers, we found no statistically significant associa-
tion between ENDS use at baseline and making at least one subsequent smoking quit attempt
(Model 1b), although we did find that those who used ENDS at any point during the study
period did have 2.4 (95% CI: 1.4, 4.3) times the odds of making a subsequent quit attempt

Statistical adjustments are made for baseline perceptions of addiction, cravings to smoke, cigarettes per day smoked, number of years having smoked, past year quit
attempts, use of nicotine replacement theory, poly-use of other combusted tobacco, smoker regret, socio-demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education,
household income, MSA status, marital status, sexual orientation, US Census region, children in household), perceived physical health, presence of asthma, chronic
bronchitis or COPD, receiving psychological therapy, alcohol consumption, and past year participation in other tobacco studies through GfK.
�Thirty-six cases were dropped from complete-case analyses due to missing data on the covariates, including 8 cases whom reported ENDS use at baseline (cf. Table 1).
One additional case was dropped from the analysis for past year quit attempt due to missing data on this outcome variable. See S3 Table for results among all baseline
smokers based on multiply imputed data.
†Exploratory pairwise comparisons were conducted for Models 2 and 2a. AOR with matching superscripts within an outcome model indicate that these groups were
significantly different.

 compared to their non-using counterparts (Model 2b). The proportion that reported quitting
smoking at follow-up was considerably lower, regardless of ENDS use, for daily smokers com-
pared to the full sample of daily and nondaily smokers. Similar to the full sample, baseline
daily smokers who reported using ENDS throughout the study (i.e., at baseline and follow-up)
reported significantly lower adjusted odds of quitting smoking at follow-up compared to those
who did not use ENDS during the study (3.0% vs. 9.2%; AOR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03–0.48) and
to those who reported using ENDS during the study but not at follow-up (p < .05). Although
the adjusted odds of quitting did not differ significantly for other temporal patterns of ENDS
use compared to non-use, similar to the overall smoker sample, we observed no instance
where ENDS users were more likely to quit than non-ENDS users.
ENDS use frequency (Model 3). Considering the frequency of ENDS use, intentions for
using ENDS to quit smoking, use of flavored ENDS, or use of a tank-system ENDS did not
substantially change the aforementioned pattern of results (Table 4). Only 19.2% (95%
CI = 12.6–28.0) of ENDS users reported any daily use during the study period. Whereas non-
daily ENDS users (though not daily users) had higher adjusted odds of making a quit attempt
than non-users (59.7% vs. 44.2%; AOR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.24–3.69), both non-daily (7.5%;
AOR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.11–0.64) and daily (9.3%; AOR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04–0.82) ENDS
users had lower odds of quitting smoking. In analysis of multiply imputed data, the effects of
frequency of ENDS use on making a quit attempt were smaller and statistically non-significant
(see S4 Table, Model 3).
Among those who were daily smokers at baseline (Model 3b), 53.8% of daily ENDS users
and 53.2% of non-daily ENDS users reported a quit attempt; however, only non-daily ENDS
users were significantly more likely to than non-users of ENDS to report a quit attempt
(31.2%; AOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.7). While a greater proportion (13.0%; 95% CI: 5.2%,
29.1%) of baseline daily smokers who used ENDS daily had quit smoking compared to their
counterparts who did not use ENDS (9.2%; 95% CI: 5.6%, 14.8%), after adjusting for covari-
ates, the odds of quitting was lower, albeit not statistically significantly lower, for daily ENDS
users compared to nonusers.
Importance of ENDS use for quitting smoking (Model 4). Similarly, whereas smokers
who indicated that quitting smoking was an important reason for their use of ENDS (the
majority) were more likely to report at least one quit attempt (60.8%; AOR = 1.80, 95%
CI = 1.01–3.21), odds of quitting smoking were lower for ENDS users regardless of level of
importance (important: 8.1%; AOR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.10–0.59) (Model 4a). Importance of
using ENDS for quitting smoking was not associated with making a quit attempt, and the
adjusted odds for none or low importance in predicting quitting smoking was not statistically
significant in analysis of multiply imputed data (see S4 Table, Model 4).
Similar to the overall smoker sample, daily smokers at baseline who indicated that quitting
smoking was an important reason for their use of ENDS were more likely to report at least one
quit attempt than their counterparts who did not use ENDS (Model 4b: 55.5% vs. 31.2%;
AOR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.23–4.60). However, they were less likely to have quit smoking a year
later (4.0%; AOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.10–0.88).
ENDS flavors (Model 5). There was limited evidence that e-liquid flavor might influence
quitting rates. Tobacco-flavored or unflavored ENDS users (2.7%; AOR = 0.11, 95%
CI = 0.02–0.50) and users of other flavors (e.g., fruit, dessert, spice; 8.8%; AOR = 0.22, 95%
CI = 0.08–0.59) had significantly lower adjusted odds of quitting than non-users (Model 5a).
In the multiple imputation analysis, only users of other flavors had significantly lower odds of
quitting smoking see S4 Table, Model 5). The comparison with non-users’ adjusted odds of
quitting was not statistically significant for menthol/wintergreen/mint users. Although the
estimated odds of quitting for menthol/mint/wintergreen and other flavor users were more

 than twice (AOR = 3.4 and 2.0; 95% CI = 0.48–24.1 and 0.38–10.2; respectively) the estimated
odds for tobacco/unflavored users, these differences were not statistically significant, possibly
due to insufficient statistical power.

 Among baseline daily smokers (Model 5b), both menthol/wintergreen/mint users and
other flavor users were more likely to report a quit attempt (AORs = 6.0 and 2.4, respectively)
than nonusers of ENDS, and menthol/wintergreen/mint users were more likely to report a
quit attempt than tobacco/unflavored users (p < .05). Only daily smokers who used tobacco/
unflavored ENDS were significantly less likely to report quitting smoking (AOR = 0.04) com-
pared to their counterparts who did not use ENDS.
ENDS device type (Model 6). While cartridge ENDS users were significantly more likely
to report a subsequent quit attempt (60.1%; AOR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.02,3.8), they had signifi-
cantly lower adjusted odds of quitting (5.5%; AOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05–0.48) compared to
non-users. The comparisons were similar in direction but not statistically significant for dis-
posable or tank system users (Model 6a). In analysis of multiply imputed data, tank users also
had significantly lower rates of quitting (see S4 Table, Model 6). While the odds of quitting for
users of tank systems were more than twice the odds of quitting for disposable ENDS users,
this difference was nonsignificant (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 0.60–10.2).
Among baseline daily smokers, both cartridge and disposable/other ENDS users were more
likely to report a subsequent quit attempt (AORs = 2.3 and 3.2, 95% CIs: 1.07, 4.78 and 1.06,
9.51, respectively) compared to their ENDS non-using counterparts. Similar to the full smoker
sample, only daily smokers who used cartridge ENDS were significantly less likely to report
quitting smoking (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.87).
ENDS use and smoking intensity among non-quitters
Among participants who were still smoking at follow-up, there were no significant differences
observed in the average number of cigarettes per day (CPD) smoked between ENDS users and
non-users, regardless of whether we considered ENDS use status only at baseline (Model 7a:
Mean CPD = 10.8 vs. 12.2 for baseline ENDS use and non-use, respectively; adj. Mdiff = -0.56,
95% CI = -1.68–0.56) or at any time during the study (Model 8a: Mean CPD = 11.5 vs. 12.0 for
any ENDS use and non-use, respectively; adj. Mdiff = -0.03, 95% CI = -1.01–0.94) or if analysis
is limited to baseline daily smokers (Models 7a and 8a) (Table 5).
The lack of clinically meaningful or statistically significant difference in smoking intensity
between ENDS users and non-users also held regardless of frequency of ENDS use (Models 9a
and 9b), importance of quitting smoking as a reason for using ENDS (Models 10a and 10b), or
e-liquid flavor (Models 11a and 11b) for both all smokers and baseline daily smokers (Table 6).
In contrast, smokers who reported using disposable/other ENDS reported smoking more ciga-
rettes per day at follow-up than both nonusers of ENDS (adj. Mdiff = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.15–3.61)
and tank system users (p < .05) (Model 12a). This pattern also held when analyses were
restricted to for baseline daily smokers (Model 12b).
Methods used to quit smoking
Table 7 shows the quit methods and resources reported by smokers whom made a quit
attempt, either successful or unsuccessful, during the study. Among those who did not use
ENDS but had quit smoking, the majority (72.5%) reported quitting by giving up cigarettes all
at once (i.e., “cold turkey”). Approximately one-third cut back gradually (35.1%) and relied on
the support of friends and family (29.3%). Those who did not use ENDS and were still smoking
had similar rates of trying to quit cigarettes all at once (65.7%) as those who had successfully
quit, but were more likely to report quitting by gradually cutting back on cigarettes (69.5%).
Among those who used ENDS during the study and had quit smoking, a majority reported
quitting cigarettes all at once (66.6%), 38.5% reported they had switched completely to ENDS,
and 25.7% reported switching partially to ENDS. However, as the sample size for this group is

 very small (n = 29, of whom 26 reported the method(s) they used to quit smoking), caution is
warranted. Among those who used ENDS and were still smoking at the follow-up survey, most
reported gradually cutting back on cigarettes in order to quit (71.5%), trying to quit cigarettes
all at once (58.7%), and switching partially to ENDS (54.9%).
Discussion
The decline of U.S adult smoking rates has accelerated in recent years [75]. In this study, 16%
of smokers in 2015 had stopped smoking a year later. However, we found no evidence that
ENDS, at least within the context of the US regulatory and tobacco/vaping market landscape
during 2015–2016, were helping adult smokers quit at a higher rate than smokers who did not
use these products, despite ENDS users being more likely to make a quit attempt. Our findings
indicate that, at the time of this study, ENDS under “real world” use and conditions may have
suppressed or delayed quitting among some adult smokers, though interpretation of negative
effects of ENDS use should consider the high rate of quitting (18%-22%) among non-ENDS
users in this study. While this quit rate is higher than a PATH Study estimate for adult smok-
ers, ages 25+ years, who did not use ENDS at wave 1 (11.3%), it is comparable to the quit rate
among the PATH younger adult smokers, 18–24 years, 21.3% [76]. Furthermore, among those

 who had not quit smoking by follow-up, our study did not find evidence that ENDS use was
associated with a reduction in cigarette consumption after adjusting for covariates. While
aligned with several prior studies [47,71,77–81], these findings diverge from other studies that
have found positive associations of ENDS use with quitting smoking [45,61,82,83]. Inconsis-

 RCTs, to satisfy six proposed quality standards [53]. Our study may be the only longitudinal
cohort study to include the consideration of ENDS “dose,” device type, e-liquid flavors, and
whether they are being used for quitting or other purposes. Our results are robust and consis-
tent even after taking into account these factors: regardless of frequency or duration of ENDS
use, device type, quitting as reason for use, or e-liquid flavor, ENDS users quit at a lower rate
than non-ENDS users. While the few, limited RCT studies indicate the potential of ENDS to
help at least some smokers quit, our study, along with a number of population cohort studies,
strongly suggest that the potential of ENDS as a disruptive technology capable of helping
smokers quit combustibles is not being realized. There are several potential explanations for
these findings. First, the effectiveness of ENDS for promoting cessation may be greater for
early-adopters (before 2015) [82] compared to later adopters (in 2015–2016), despite the early
market dominance of disposable and cig-a-like devices with poorer nicotine delivery. Later
adopters of ENDS may differ from early adopters in important yet unidentified ways. Patterns
and characteristics of ENDS use may also explain the findings. Many smokers were neither
using ENDS daily nor using tank systems despite past research suggesting daily use of
advanced systems that offer better nicotine delivery to be predictors of quitting success
[61,69,82]. Whereas a recently published analysis of the PATH study found that daily ENDS
and tank system users were more likely to have quit smoking cigarettes or reduced their

�Sample sizes vary by quit method due to missing data.
†If the respondent was no longer smoker at the follow-up survey (regardless of duration of abstinence), they were asked to report any of the methods and resources they
used “when they quit smoking for good.” If they were still smoking at the follow-up survey, they were asked to report any of the methods or resources they used to “try
to quit smoking” since the baseline survey.

 smoking compared to nonusers [84]; another recent, well-designed study of smokers found
that few of the smokers that used ENDS post-discharge used them regularly, and that this was
associated with lower rates of cessation at 6-months post discharge from the hospital com-
pared to nonusers [85]. Although neither daily use nor use of tank-system ENDS improved
quitting over non-ENDS use in this study, this study may have been underpowered to detect
higher quitting among tank-system users compared to disposable or cartridge users, and to
detect higher quitting among daily users compared to non-daily users. ENDS vary consider-
ably in their features and nicotine delivery across and within subtype and though nicotine
delivery among some systems may be comparable to cigarettes, many systems are less efficient
in this regard [60,86–91]. Tank systems also may not adequately mimic the experience of
smoking a cigarette. Recent innovation and advancements in ENDS engineering, including
cartridge-systems (e.g., JUUL), or other nicotine-delivery systems (e.g., heat-not-burn) may
offer more appealing and satisfying options to facilitate complete switching for smokers
[92,93]. Third, many dual users may use ENDS as a complement, rather than a substitute, to
cigarettes [94,95]. In times/places when/where smoking is either prohibited, discouraged or
inconvenient, smokers may use ENDS as a way to cope with their cravings in those situations.
This type of dual use pattern is unlikely to result in higher quit rates compared to non-ENDS
users and is concerning as smoking even one cigarette per day is associated with a substantially
higher risk of coronary heart disease and stroke [96]. Lastly, a significant portion of smokers
inaccurately believes that ENDS pose higher or similar risks to health as combustible cigarettes
[97]. Misinformation and uncertainty about the risks of ENDS relative to smoking may have
discouraged complete switching from combustibles to ENDS for many smokers.
Taken together, our results suggest that the current ways that ENDS are used under “real
world” conditions may not increase population quit rates and generate meaningful net public
health benefits. In the absence of substantial changes in product characteristics that would
make ENDS more satisfying and appealing to adult smokers, policies and regulations that
incentivize adult smokers to switch to ENDS, and efforts to accurately communicate the risks
of ENDS to adult smokers and the general public, a substantial net public health benefit from
ENDS in the U.S. seems unlikely. These findings, considered within the context of the current
literature, have important regulatory implications. From the perspective of product character-
istics, helping smokers quit combustibles will need evidence-based product standards and pre-
market reviews that will encourage innovations in products that truly increase population quit
rates. For example, the FDA has recently issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPRM) regarding the role of flavors in tobacco product use, including in smokers switching
to potentially reduced-harm tobacco products.[98] Much of the research on the impact of fla-
vored ENDS has focused on the toxicity of flavor additives and their appeal to youth, whereas
relatively little research has considered their impact on adult smokers. The results of our study
suggest whereas the majority of ENDS users reported using flavors other than tobacco or men-
thol/wintergreen/mint, only the latter were significantly more likely than non-ENDS users to
report a subsequent quit attempt, and none of the flavors was associated with greater likeli-
hood of quitting than non-users. In fact, tobacco/unflavored ENDS users, as well as users of
fruit, candy, and other flavors (other than menthol or mint) were associated with lower odds
of quitting compared to non-ENDS users. Further study of flavors is necessary to better under-
stand how e-liquid flavors influence decisions of smokers to use ENDS and their smoking
outcomes.
Moreover, the findings of this and other studies support the notion that focusing on ENDS
alone may be insufficient. Regulations and policies that incentivize smokers to switch
completely to reduced-harm and reduced-risk products are needed. For example, product
standards aimed at reducing the addictiveness of cigarettes may also be required to achieve

 population harm reduction through switching to lower-harm tobacco products or cessation of
all tobacco. This notion is in line with recently announced plans by the FDA to reduce the nic-
otine within cigarettes while using regulations to promote the availability and acceptability of
reduced-harm nicotine and tobacco products (as well as FDA-approved medicinal nicotine
products) [99–101]. In addition, education campaigns that accurately communicate the risks
of ENDS and other reduced-risk products may also encourage more complete switching from
combustibles to ENDS, and in turn boost the potential of ENDS to increase the population
quit rate.
Limitations
Interpretation and drawing of conclusions from this study must be tempered by consideration
of its methodological limitations. Foremost, the observational design of this study limits the
ability to draw causal inferences. Despite adjustment for an extensive list of potential con-
founders, we cannot adequately test for unmeasured confounders. Observational studies of
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) have also often failed to find a positive effect on long-
term smoking cessation, particularly after NRT became available without a prescription
[102,103]. Among other explanations, unmeasured confounders have been cited as a possible
reason for these studies to replicate the positive effects observed in RCTs [103]. While addi-
tional U.S.-based RCTs that improve upon the weaknesses of past RCTs are much needed,
RCTs are limited in their capability of assessing population-level effects of ENDS under real-
world use patterns and conditions. Related, alternative approaches for handling observed con-
founding, such as propensity score weighting or entropy balancing adjustment, might have
yielded different results. However, studies examining the association between ENDS use and
cessation that have used propensity score weighting or entropy-balancing adjustment have
obtained similar results as this study [85,104]. Second, whereas the use of a national probability
sample is a strength of this study, use of an online panel prohibited biochemical verification of
quitting or ENDS use. While the validity of self-reported cigarette smoking has been supported
[105], the accuracy of self-report of ENDS use is less known. Third, although the sample size of
this study either exceeds or is comparable to that of similar prior cohort studies, it might have
been insufficient for conducting adequately powered comparisons of subgroups of ENDS
users. Related, while retention of two-thirds of our sample over the one-year follow-up period
is comparable or superior to most similar cohort studies, our reliance on statistical weighting
adjustments to address attrition may not fully account for all relevant predictors of missing-
ness. Finally, while this cohort study provides more recent data than other published cohort
studies, caution is needed in generalizing its findings to the future given the continued rapid
changes in the regulatory and market landscape for tobacco products.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that use of current ENDS products in real world conditions do not seem to
improve the chances of quitting for smokers, and, under the current landscape, may not be the
disruptive technology that increases the population quit rate and reduces the harm of combus-
tibles. Additional steps may be needed to spur innovation to create low-harm and low-risk
products that adequately deliver nicotine, address the misperceptions of relative harm of
ENDS compared to cigarettes, and encourage cessation and complete switching from combus-
tibles to low-harm and low-risk products among smokers who do not want to quit smoking.
While this paper advances the current evidence-base by providing more recent data from the
first longitudinal cohort study of a moderately large, nationally representative US sample to
address recently proposed quality standards, additional research is needed to reconcile the
