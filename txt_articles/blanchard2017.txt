Abstract The fraternal birth order effect is the tendency for
older brothers to increase the odds of homosexuality in later-
bornmales.Thisstudycomparedthestrengthoftheeffectinsub-
jects from small versus large families and in homosexual sub-
jects with masculine versus feminine gender identities. Meta-
analyses were conducted on 30 homosexual and 30 heterosex-
ual groups from 26 studies, totaling 7140 homosexual and
12,837heterosexualmales.Themagnitudeofthefraternalbirth
order effect was measured with a novel variable, the Older
Brothers Odds Ratio, computed as (homosexuals’ older broth-
ers 7 homosexuals’othersiblings) 7 (heterosexuals’older
brothers7heterosexuals’othersiblings),whereother siblings
=oldersisters?youngerbrothers? youngersisters.AnOlder
Brothers Odds Ratio of 1.00 represents no effect of sexual ori-
entation;valuesover1.00arepositiveevidenceforthefraternal

consistent. The Older Brothers Odds Ratio was significantly[
1.00 in 20 instances,[

Introduction
Ithasnowbeen25yearssinceIpublishedmyfirststudyonbirth
order and sexual orientation in males (Blanchard & Sheridan,
1992).Thatstudybeganagradualrevivalofresearchinterestin
atopicsporadicallyrevisitedfordecadeswithnoparticularcon-
clusiononwhetheror whyhomosexualmenhavea different
averagebirthorderthanheterosexualmen(seehistoricalreview
by Blanchard, 1997).
Researchinthesucceedingyearsestablishedseveralimpor-
tant facts. First, homosexual men do have a higher birth order
(i.e.,laterbirths)thanheterosexualmen,andthisdifferencecan
beattributedtotheirgreaternumberofolderbrothers(Blanchard
& Bogaert, 1996b). Older brothers increase the odds of homo-
sexuality in later-born males, whereas older sisters, younger
brothers,andyoungersistershavenoeffectonthoseodds.This
phenomenonhasthereforebeentermedthefraternalbirthorder
effect (FBOE).
The second finding was that biological brothers increase the
odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were
reared in different households, whereas stepbrothers or adoptive
brothers have no effect on sexual orientation (Bogaert, 2006).
Thus, the most direct evidence currently available indicates that
the effect of older brothers on younger brothers is mediated by
somelong-termchangeintheirmother’suterineenvironment.To
my knowledge, no one has ever attempted to repeat Bogaert’s
(2006) study. However, its implication that the FBOE operates
prenatally rather than postnatally is indirectly supported by evi-
dencethathomosexualmaleswitholderbrothershavelowerthan
expectedbirthweights(Blanchard&Ellis,2001;Blanchardetal.,
2002;VanderLaan,Blanchard,Wood,Garzon,&Zucker,2015).
The third finding was that the FBOE occurs in different
culturesandinwidelyseparatedgeographicregions.TheFBOE
has been demonstrated in Brazil (VanderLaan et al., 2016),
Canada (Blanchard & Bogaert, 1996b), Iran (Khorashad et al.,

Bozkurt, & Sonmez, 2015), the UK (King et al., 2005), and the
U.S. (Schwartz, Kim, Kolundzija, Rieger, & Sanders, 2010).
I have previously authored or co-authored three meta-anal-
yses of studies on the FBOE. Each of these meta-analyses
addressedaspecificquestionortargetedaspecificsubsetofthe
literature, and each used a completely different methodology.
Jones and Blanchard (1998) addressed the narrow question of
whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in
later-born males, orsimply a weaker effect than older brothers.
To this end, we developed competing mathematical models of
thetwopossibilitiesandcomparedthefitofthesemodelstothe
empirical data available at that time. Jones and Blanchard con-
cludedthatanytendencyforhomosexualmalestobebornlater
among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their ten-
dency to be born later among their brothers.
In Blanchard (2004), I reported a meta-analysis of studies
frommyownresearchprogram.Thesestudiesincluded10,143
malesubjects(3181homosexualsand6962heterosexuals).The
results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men have
more older brothers than do heterosexual men and the conclu-
sion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sis-
ters,youngerbrothers,oryoungersisters)aresecondaryconse-
quences of the difference in older brothers.
Blanchard and VanderLaan (2015) performed a meta-anal-
ysisofstudiesinwhichneitherwenoranyofourcustomarycol-
laborators carried out the collection or the analysis of the orig-
inaldata.The purposeofthisselectioncriterionwastoproduce
results that would be as free as possible from our own potential
unconscious biases. Although the data-analytic procedure was
different from that used by Blanchard (2004), the conclusions
were closely similar.
Among the remaining questions that might be answered
usingmeta-analysisofpublishedorarchiveddataiswhetherthe
magnitudeoftheFBOEisgreaterinmalesampleswithlargeror
withsmallerfamily sizes.1Previousresearchfocusedonmath-
ematical statistics does not generate consistent predictions for
this precise question. Suarez and Przybeck (1980) based their
mathematical modeling on the assumption of a causal relation
betweenexcessbrothersandmalehomosexuality.Althoughtheir
equations assume that all brothers rather than older brothers
influence a subject’s sexual orientation, the form of their rea-
soning seems to hold if the relevant parameters concern older
siblings instead of all siblings. They developed two different
models, both ofwhichpredicted that theproportion of brothers
in the sibships of homosexual men should decrease as family
size increases. Both of their models provided a good fit to the
archivaldatatheyexamined.SuarezandPrzybeckdidnotoffer
anyopiniononwhethercomparisonsofhomosexualandhetero-
sexual groups would be more likely to find significant differ-
ences if the compared groups had large family sizes or small
family sizes. The thrust of their analysis, however, seems to
imply that the FBOE would be easier to detect if the compared
groupshadsmallfamilysizes.Thatisbecausehomosexualmen
fromsmallfamilieswouldhavethegreatestproportionofolder
brothers (see Suarez & Przybeck, 1980; Fig.2).
The studies by Cantor, Blanchard, Paterson, and Bogaert
(2002) and Bogaert (2004) were based on the assumption of a
causal relation between older brothers and male homosexuality.
The parameters of their equations were estimated directly from
empiricalcomparisonsofhomosexualandheterosexualmen.Can-
toretal.concludedthattheproportionofhomosexualmenwhocan
attributetheirsexualorientationtoolderbrothersincreaseswiththe
numberofolderbrothers,risingfrom0%ingroupsofhomosexual
men with no older brothers to over 50% in groups with three or
moreolderbrothers.Cantoretal.also,however,offerednoopinion
ontheimplicationsforbetween-groupscomparisons.Incontrastto
theanalysesbySuarez andPrzybeck,theanalysesbyCantoretal.
and Bogaert (2004) seem to imply that the FBOE would be easier
to detect if the compared groups had large family sizes. That is
because homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the
FBOE would be most likely to come from large families.
Addingto the difficulty of makingtheory-based predictions
about the optimal family size for studying the FBOE is the
possibilitythattherelativeprevalenceofotheretiologicfactors
in sexual orientation may also vary with family size. One such
hypothetical factor would be a genetic variant that predisposes
malestohomosexualitybutpredisposestheirfemalerelativesto
greater fertility,perhaps by increasingsexual attractionto men
inbothgroups.Thehypothesizedexistenceofoneormoresuch
genetic variants is sometimes associated with the balancing
selection hypothesis of homosexuality, that is, the proposition
that the smaller number of direct descendants of homosexual
men, compared with heterosexual men, is offset by a larger
numberofotherclosebiologicalrelatives.Severalstudieshave,
in fact, confirmed the prediction of the balancing selection
hypothesisthathomosexualresearchsubjectswillreportlarger
family sizes than heterosexual control subjects (e.g., Iemmola
& Camperio Ciani, 2009; King et al., 2005; Schwartz et al.,
2010; VanderLaan & Vasey, 2011; but see Blanchard, 2012;
Kishida&Rahman,2015).If‘‘gaygenes’’withtheseeffectsare
one (but not the only) cause of homosexuality in males, we
might expect that homosexual men from larger families would
bemorelikelytohaveacquiredtheirsexualorientationthrough
this direct genetic route. Such men would have average birth
orders,bothinrelationtobrothersandinrelationtoallsiblings,
1 TheavailableevidencealreadyindicatesthattheFBOEcannotbedetected
when family size is strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-
called stopping rules) of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male
child,orafterachildofeachsex(Blanchard&Lippa,2007;Xu&Zheng,2014,
2017; Zucker, Blanchard, Kim, Pae, & Lee, 2007). In these particular situa-
tions,whicharenotaddressedinthepresentpaper,neitherhomosexualnorhetero-
sexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful.

 and thus would dilute evidence of the FBOE. This possibility
furthercomplicatespredictionsabouttherelativemagnitudeof
the FBOE in large versus small families. For these reasons, the
most certain way to establish the relation (if any) between
family size and the FBOE is through empirical rather than
theoretical or deductive means.
The relation between mean family sizes and the magnitude
of the FBOE is of practical relevance both for evaluating the
resultsofpublishedstudiesandforplanningfutureones.Ithere-
foreconductedthepresentmeta-analysispartlyasasteptoward
answering this question.
Thisstudyhada secondgoal,namelytoinvestigatewhether
the FBOE is greater in feminine or transgender homosexual
malesthaninrelativelymasculinehomosexualmales.Wampold
(2013) conjectured that fraternal birth order correlates posi-
tively with the preference for the receptive role in anal inter-
course and that the preference for the receptive role in anal
intercoursecorrelatespositivelywithfemininityinhomosexual
males (see, for example, Zheng, Hart, & Zheng, 2012), from
which it should follow that fraternal birth order correlates
positivelywithfemininityinhomosexualmales.Swift-Gallant,
Coome,Monks,andVanderLaan(2017),inanempiricalstudy,
did find a positive correlationbetween fraternal birth order and
thepreferenceforthereceptiveroleinanalintercourseaswellas
a positive correlation between the preference for the receptive
role in anal intercourse and femininity in homosexual males.
They did not, however, find a significant correlation between
fraternal birth order and femininity. Several other studies have
investigated whether the FBOE is greater in feminine homo-
sexual males, andnone of them found evidence for such a rela-
tion (Bogaert, 2003, 2005a; Kishida & Rahman, 2015; Seme-
nya,VanderLaan,&Vasey,2017).However,themeta-analytic
methodologyofthepresentstudyofferedadifferentandpoten-
tiallymorepowerfulapproachtothequestion,andtheanswerto
this question is still pertinentto interpretingthefindings of past
studies and to planning future ones.
Inordertoestablishconfidenceintheanswerstomyfirsttwo
questions, I first needed to demonstrate that the FBOE was
clearlypresentinthematerialassembledforinvestigation.This
was accomplished by adding a third goal to the study, namely
conducting an updated meta-analysis on the magnitude and
reliability of the FBOE itself.
Method
Studies and Samples Analyzed
The analysis consisted of 60 groups, 30 homosexual2 and 30
heterosexual, from 26 studies. My second meta-analysis
(Blanchard,2004)contributed28ofthese.Mythirdmeta-anal-
ysis (Blanchard & VanderLaan, 2015) contributed 10 more. I
could not use all the groups from that meta-analysis because
severalstudiesdidnotreportthemeanolderbrothers,oldersis-
ters, and so on, for their groups,3 and because 10 groups from
Rahman and his colleagues were included in a later study
(Kishida&Rahman,2015),whichIusedforthepresentanalysis.
After I retrieved the usable data from studies in my two
previousmeta-analyses,I searchedthepublishedliterature and
myownarchivaldataforstudiesthatmetthefollowingcriteria:
1. The study sample consisted entirely of singleton births, or
else the number of multiple births was simply the (small)
number expected by chance.
2. Homosexual orientation was classified according to the
subject’s self-report or from phallometric testing and not
from proxy variables like same-sex marriage.
3. Means for all four types of siblings (older brothers, older
sisters,youngerbrothers,andyoungersisters)werereported
by the publishing authors or else were computable from
archival data in my files.
4. Thereportedmeanswerecomputeddirectlyfromrawdata
and not estimated from incomplete data.
5. The means were not known to be distorted by stoppage
rules (e.g., Blanchard & Lippa, 2007).
This search produced an additional 22 groups.4 The descrip-
tions of the 60 groups are given in Table 1. The number of sub-
jectsin each group isalsoreportedinthistable.Alldata used in
this study are presented in the Appendix.
Measurement of Family Size
Iusedaspecialindexoffamilysize,OtherSiblings,definedas
the total number of siblings other than older brothers. In other
words, Other Siblings = older sisters ? younger brothers ?
younger sisters. This measure, first used in Blanchard et al.
(2000), was specifically designed for comparing homosexual
male study groups with heterosexual male control groups. The
computingformulawasoriginallydevelopedforapplicationto
thesiblingcountsreportedbyindividualsubjects;inthepresent
study, it was applied to the means for each group.
2 The groups included pedophiles with a sexual preference for boys and
male-to-female transsexuals with a sexual preference for men. These

groupscanaccuratelybe labeledashomosexual(according tobiological
sex), but they do not have a social identity as gay.
3 ThestudiesthatdidnotreportallmeanswereFrancis(2008),Iemmola
andCamperioCiani(2009),Kangassalo,Po
¨lkki,andRantala(2011),and
Robinson and Manning (2000).
4 I identified only two published studies that met the indispensable
criterion 3 but failed some other criterion, and that are not mentioned in
the Introduction or Discussion of this article. These were Bogaert
(2005b, 2010), which did not satisfy criterion 4. I can mention, for the
sake of completeness, four other studies that I did not use in my meta-
analysis because they did not meet criterion 3 and sometimes also other
criteria: Bearman and Bru
¨ckner (2002), Bogaert (1998), McConaghy
et al. (2006), and Zietsch et al. (2012).

 Results
Analyses of Unpaired Groups
The first part of the data analysis concerned the third goal of
the study, namely the reliability of the FBOE itself. Of equal
orgreaterimportance,italsodemonstratedtheneedtocontrol
for family size in FBOE research, and it laid the groundwork
fortheoutcomevariableusedinthesecondpartofthedataanal-
ysis. This first set of analyses ignored the fact that the groups
were originally collected in pairs and treated them as if they
were completely independent entities. The groups’ summary
variables were treated as single data points with no variance of
their own. These analyses did not weight the individual data
points in any way.
Each group’s mean number of Older Brothers is plotted
againstitsmean numberofOther Siblings inFig.1.Thehomo-
sexual groups are indicatedbyblack dots,andtheheterosexual
groups are indicated by white dots. I fitted separate regression
lines through the homosexual and heterosexual groups using
quadratic equations.5 I added the lines primarily as an aid to
visualinterpretationofthefigure;theseregressionshavenorole
in the central analyses presented later.6
Figure 1illustratestwogeneralizableaspectsofthisdataset.
(1) For any narrow range of values along the Other Siblings
dimension (e.g., 1.50–2.00 siblings), the homosexual groups
tend to have more older brothers than the heterosexual groups.
Thus, for example, in the air space above the 1.50–2.00 stretch
of the X-axis, the black dots are mostly higher than the white
dots.Statedgenerally,ifahomosexualgroupandaheterosexual
group have equal totals of older sisters, younger brothers, and
younger sisters, then thehomosexual group will probably have
more older brothers. (2) If two groups differ substantially in
Other Siblings, it can be misleading to compare them with
regard to Older Brothers, at least when one is working in raw
data.Forexample,theexpectednumberofOlderBrothersfora
heterosexual group with 3 Other Siblings is about equal to the
expected number of Older Brothers for a homosexual group
with2OtherSiblingsandhigherthantheexpectednumberfora
homosexual group with 1 other sibling.
InordertoadjustOlderBrothersforfamilysize,Idividedthis
variable by Other Siblings, thus producing a new variable: the
Older Brothers Ratio. Because the present research used pub-
lished means from other investigators, I calculated the Older
Brothers Ratio for each group by dividing its mean number of
OlderBrothersbyitsmeannumberofOtherSiblings.Notethat
the identical value would result from dividing a group’s total
numberofOlderBrothersbyitstotalnumberofOtherSiblings.

 traditionally computed sibling sex ratio (e.g., Jensch, 1941a,
1941b; Lang, 1936, 1940, 1960), which is the ratio of brothers to
sisters collectively reported by a given group of subjects.7
I replotted the new variable, Older Brothers Ratio, against
Other Siblings in Fig.2. The new variable had essentially no
correlationwithOtherSiblings.Iagainplottedregressionlines,
usingquadraticequations,simplytoaidvisualinterpretationof
the figure.8 The FBOE is again apparent in this figure from the
generally greater height of the black dots relative to the white
dots.
TheoverallclassificationaccuracyobtainablewiththeOlder
BrothersRatiowasassessedwithbinarylogisticregression.All
60groupsservedasthecases.ThecriterionvariablewasSexual
Orientation, and the single predictor variable was the Older
Brothers Ratio. This predictor classified 93% of groups (56 of
60)correctly.Obviously,thisresultwasstatisticallysignificant,
v2(1)= 49.73, p\.0001.9 Two homosexual groups were mis-
classified as heterosexual (Blanchard & Zucker, 1994; Currin,
Gibson,&Hubach,2015a,2015b),andtwoheterosexualgroups

Breedlove, & Ellis, 2006,‘‘Bogaert—Other’’sample; Vasey &
VanderLaan, 2007).
The location of the four misclassified groups is shown in
Fig.3.Mostofthemisclassifiedgroupsfellatthelowendofthe
OtherSiblingsdimension;however,sodidmostofthecorrectly
classified groups. A t test comparing the four misclassified and
56 correctly classified groups found no tendency for the mis-
classified groups to have lower values for Other Siblings,
t(58) = .16, n.s.
There was some additional useful information that could
be extracted from the data depicted in Figs. 2 and 3. For the
homosexual groups, the mean Older Brothers Ratio was .50
(SD=.21). When the one possible outlier (Khorashad et al.,
2017,homosexualgroup)wasexcluded,themeanoftheremain-
ing 29 homosexual groups was .46 (SD=.08). For the hetero-
sexualgroups,themeanwas.32(SD=.06).Thesevaluescould
be helpful to future FBO researchers inevaluatingthe typicality
of their samples’ results.
The variable, Older Brothers Ratio, can be viewed as the
odds that any randomly selected sibling of a research subject
will beanolder brother,ormoreconcisely,theodds ofan older
brother.Forreadersunfamiliarwiththedistinctionbetweenodds
and probability, odds=probability7(1-probability). In this
context, it is noteworthy that the heterosexual groups’ Older
Brothers Ratio of .32 is close to the theoretical odds of .33 that
would obtain if all four categories of siblings were equally
probableat.25;thatis,.33=.257(1-.25).SeealsoBlanchard
(2014, Footnote 1).

 Analyses of Paired Groups
As previously stated, the analyses up to this point ignored the
informationthatthegroupswereoriginallycollectedinpairs.In
contrast, the analyses in the second part of the investigation
made full use of this information. These analyses addressed all
three of the study’s main goals, namely the updated meta-
analysis of the FBOE, the potential difference between femi-

Updated Meta-analysis of the FBOE
OntheviewoftheOlderBrothersRatioasatypeofodds,divid-
ingtheOlderBrothersRatioofahomosexualgroupbytheOlder
Brothers Ratio of its original heterosexual control group yields
anOlder BrothersOdds Ratio for that pair. TheOlderBrothers
Odds Ratio is a ratio of ratios: (homosexuals’ older brothers
7homosexuals’othersiblings)7(heterosexuals’olderbroth-
ers7heterosexuals’othersiblings).Values[
1.00indicatethat
a homosexual group has a higher proportion of older brothers
among its siblings than does its heterosexual control group. In
other words, values[
1.00 are positive evidence of the FBOE.
The value of 1.00represents the point of zero effect, and values
\
1.00 would represent direct evidence against the FBOE. It
shouldbenotedthatthisoddsratioisnotthesameastheusually
calculated multiplicative change in the odds of homosexuality
produced by each older brother (e.g., Blanchard & Bogaert,
1996b).
Figure 4 shows the Older Brothers Odds Ratios for the 30
pairs of groups plotted against the mean number of Other Sib-
lingsforthehomosexualgroupineachpair.Figure 4alsoshows
a reference line at 1.00, representing no effect of sexual orien-
tation. The first thingthat one notices is that the Older Brothers
Odds Ratio is [
1.00 for 29 of the 30 groups. The binomial
probability of this result under the null hypothesis of no sexual
orientationeffect is p\.000001.Theone discrepantresult was
fromthestudybyCurrinetal.(2015a,2015b);aspreviouslyindi-
cated, this result concerned their homosexual group, not their
heterosexual control group.
TheOlderBrothersOddsRatiodatawerefurtherinvestigated
in two parallel meta-analyses. Both meta-analyses were per-
formedwiththeReviewManager(RevMan)computerprogram
(version5.3.Copenhagen,Denmark:TheNordicCochraneCen-
tre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Both used the inverse-
variance weighting method; one used a random effects model,
and the other used a fixed effects model. I will report the results
obtainedundertherandomeffectsmodel.Thismodelwasmore
conservative in the sense that it consistently produced higher
(i.e.,lesssignificant)pvalues;however,therewasnoinstancein
whichonemodelproducedapvaluebelowthetraditionalcutoff
of.05andtheotherdidnot.Insubgroupsanalyses,thetwomod-
els produced practically identical pooled estimates of the Older
Brothers Odds Ratio when the subgroup in question showed no
significant evidence of heterogeneity, and they produced quite
similar estimates even when heterogeneity was detected.
Figure5 shows a forest plot for the meta-analysis of all 30
samples along with inferential statistics for the pooled and

corresponded to the variables already identified in the Intro-
duction as potentially relevant (i.e., gender identity and family

the foregoing results was essentially the same as the original

non-feminine samples.

 the feminine and non-feminine groups are identified by black
and white dots in Fig.4.
The pooled Older Brothers Odds Ratio for the feminine/
transgender groups was 1.85, 95% CI [1.50, 2.29], which was
significantly [
1.00, z= 5.65, p\.00001. These groups still
showed evidence of substantial heterogeneity, v2(11) =55.53,
p\.00001, I2=80%. The pooled estimate for the non-femi-
nine/cisgendergroupswas1.27,95%CI[1.20,1.35],whichwas
also significantly[
1.00, z=7.71, p\.00001. These groups,
however, did not show evidence of heterogeneity, v2(17)=
20.01, p=.27,I2= 15%. The 95% confidence intervals for the
pooled feminine and non-feminine groups did not overlap, and
thetestforsubgroupdifferences(Deeksetal.,2011)confirmed
thatthefemininegroupshadsignificantlyhigherOlderBrothers
Odds Ratios (i.e., higher ratios of older brothers) than did the
non-feminine groups, v2(1)=10.97, p=.0009.
Family Size and Fraternal Birth Order
My strategy for investigating the relation between family size
and the magnitude of the FBOE was to divide the feminine
subgroup into two sub-subgroups with larger and smaller fam-
ily sizes and to do the same with the non-feminine subgroup.
The measure of family size was the mean number of Other
Siblings for the homosexual group in each pair (I ignored the
mean numbers of Other Siblings for the heterosexual control
groups).Becausethismeasureisthesamevariabledefiningthe
X-axis in Fig.4, that figure serves to illustrate the relations (or
lack thereof) examined in this analysis. The criterion for clas-
sifying a group as having a larger or smaller family size was a
mean number of Other Siblings C2.00 or\
2.00, respectively.
Therewere7feminine/transgendergroupswithsmallerfamily
sizes and 5 with larger family sizes, and there were 13 non-
feminine/cisgendergroupswithsmallerfamilysizesand5with
larger family sizes.
The pooled Older Brothers Odds Ratio for the feminine
groups with smaller families was 1.96, 95% CI [1.39, 2.77],
which was significantly [
1.00, z= 3.81, p= .0001. These
groups showed evidence of substantial heterogeneity, v2(6)=
37.02, p\.00001, I2= 84%. The pooled estimate for the fem-
ininegroupswithlargerfamilieswas1.72,95%CI[1.31,2.25],
which was also significantly[
1.00, z=3.94, p\.0001. These
groups also showed evidence of heterogeneity, v2(4) =17.01,
p=.002, I2= 76%. The test for subgroup differences showed
that the Older Brothers Odds Ratios of these subgroups did not
differ,v2(1) =.34,p= .56.Thus,therewasnoevidencethatthe
feminine groups with smaller families and those with larger
familiesdiffered in regard to theirOlder Brothers Odds Ratios.
The findings for the non-feminine groups yielded similar
conclusionsregardingtheeffectoffamilysizebutnotregarding
heterogeneity among the samples. The pooled Older Brothers
Odds Ratio for the non-feminine groups with smaller families
was 1.28, 95% CI [1.18, 1.38], which was significantly[
1.00,
z=6.09, p\.00001. These groups showed no evidence of
heterogeneity, v2(12)=16.55, p= .17, I2=28%. The pooled
estimate for the non-feminine groups with larger families was
1.24, 95% CI [1.12, 1.38], which was also significantly[
1.00,
z=4.00, p\.0001. These groups also showed no evidence of
heterogeneity, v2(4) =3.31, p=.51, I2= 0%. The test for sub-
group differences showed that the Older Brothers Odds Ratios
of these subgroups did not differ, v2(1)=.15, p=.70. There-
fore, as in the previous analysis, there was no evidence that the
groups with smaller families and those with larger families
differed in their estimated Older Brothers Odds Ratios.
Discussion
The results, no matter how they were analyzed, confirmed the
reliability ofthe FBOE in the studies selected for investigation.
The measure of fraternal birth order adjusted for family size,
older brothers7other siblings, classified over 93% of the 60
groupscorrectly.Therewasnoapparentpatterninthemisclassi-
fied groups. Four misclassifications out of 60 seems consistent
with random error, especially when only about 15–29% of the
men in any given homosexual group can attribute their sexual
orientation to the FBOE (Blanchard & Bogaert, 2004; Cantor
et al., 2002).
When considered pairwise, the homosexual group had a
higher (adjusted) fraternal birth order than its original hetero-
sexual control group 97% of the time, that is, in 29 of 30 pairs.
For 20 of these 29 pairs, the difference was statistically signif-
icant.Intheonediscrepantcaseinwhichthehomosexualgroup

statistically significant.
Additional, more quantitative investigation of the data was
carried out in a series of hierarchically organized meta-analy-
ses.Asintheotherpairwiseanalyses,theoutcomevariablewas

Themeta-analysisfoundthat,estimatedfromall30samples,
the Older Brothers Odds Ratio was 1.47. This means that the
ratio of older brothers to other siblings was 47% greater for
homosexualsthanitwasforheterosexuals.Thisresultcanbere-
cast in different terms, namely the proportion of older brothers
(olderbrothers7allsiblings)ratherthantheoddsofolderbroth-
ers(olderbrothers7othersiblings).Recomputedintheseterms,
the result was that the proportion of older brothers was 31%
greater in the sibships of homosexuals than in the sibships of

 heterosexuals. The latter value is the so-called risk ratio. (The
statistic has this name for historical reasons; it can be computed
for good things, bad things, or neutral things). In the context of
thisstudy,theriskratiowasalwayslowerthantheoddsratio—in
this instance, 1.31 versus 1.47.
For most people, an effect measure calculated on a mix of
feminine/transgender and non-feminine/cisgender homosexual
males will be less useful or interesting than effects measures
calculated separately for these groups. The pooled Older
Brothers Odds Ratio for the feminine groups was 1.85, and the
valueforthenon-femininegroupswas1.27.Thecorresponding
risk ratios were 1.52and 1.19. The differences between groups
werehighlysignificant.Tosumuptheresultssofarincommon
language:Femininehomosexual maleshave more older broth-
ers than non-feminine homosexual males, and non-feminine
homosexualmales,inturn,havemoreolderbrothersthanhetero-
sexual males.
Thedifferencebetweenfeminineandthenon-femininehomo-
sexualmaleswasthefirstnovelfindingofthisstudy.Incontrastto
previous studies (Bogaert, 2003, 2005a; Kishida & Rahman,
2015;Semenyaetal.,2017),thisstudydidfindevidencethatthe
FBOE was significantly stronger in feminine or transgender
homosexual groups than in other homosexual groups. The dis-
crepancy in results may be the resultof a largemethodological
difference: Unlike previous studies, the present study con-
trasted entire groups of highly feminine homosexual males
withentiregroupsofrelativelytypicalhomosexualmales.The
earlier studies examined either highly feminine homosexual
males or typical homosexual males but not both, and within-
group variance in femininity was assessed with questionnaire
measures.Inotherwords,theearlierstudiesmayhavesuffered
from a restriction-of-range problem.
This finding is important to theory for two related reasons.
First, masculinity–femininity is one of the most salient behav-
ioral variables within the male homosexual population (Bailey
& Zucker, 1995), and second, the relation between FBO and
masculinity–femininityrepresentsoneofthefewdemonstrated
linksbetweenanyestablishedbehavioralvariableandaspecific
etiologic pathway.
Theinterpretationofthepresentfindingismoreuncertain.It
mayreflecta dosage effectofsome maternalproduct that oper-
atesdirectlyonthefetalbrainduringprenatallife.Accordingto
this hypothesis, a smaller number of older brothers simply
increasesthe oddsof sexualorientationtowardmales,whereasa
largernumbernotonlyincreasesthoseoddsbutalsoleadstowider-
ranging emotional and behavioralpropensitiestypical of females.
A second possible hypothesis also assumes that the relation
between number of older brothers and the odds of homosexu-
alityconcernsprenatallife,butitpositsthatanydosageeffectper-
tains solely to sexual orientation itself. According to this
hypothesis, it is the experience of growing up in a highly male-
dominatedsibshipthatsomehowpredisposesahomosexualboy
to behave in a feminine manner or identify as a girl.
The distinction between the foregoing hypotheses can be
illustrated with the example of gay men who were adopted at
birth by biologically unrelated parents. These men might have
biological older brothers (whom they have never met) through
their birth mother or adoptive older brothers (with whom they
wereraised)orboth.Thefirstexplanationpredictsthatthemen’s
femininityshouldvaryasafunctionoftheirnumberofbiological
older brothers; the second explanation predicts that their femi-
ninityshouldvaryasafunctionoftheirnumberofadoptiveolder
brothers.
A third possibility is that the neurodevelopmental pathway
triggered by older brothers is inherently more feminizing than
pathwaystriggeredbyotheretiologicfactors(e.g.,‘‘gay’’genes
or prenatal hormone exposure). Thus, a group of homosexual
males selected for generalized femininity is likely to contain a
higher proportion of individuals who acquired their sexual ori-
entation via the older brother pathway. Other hypotheses,
equally speculative, are also possible. The present study could
not address such questions.
The study’s second novel finding is that it does not matter,
withregardtothemagnitudeoftheFBOE,whetherhomosexual
andheterosexualgroupsbeingcomparedonolderbrothershave
largeorsmallfamilysizes,solongastheyhavethesamefamily
size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition). There are
many research designs that might have been used to approach
thisquestion,anditispossiblethatsomeofthemmighthaveled
to a different conclusion. It is also possible thatthe inclusionof
severalhomosexualandheterosexualgroupswithverysmallor
very large family sizes would have altered the results. I tend to
doubt, however, that a strong relationship that would be
apparent with another research design would be completely
invisibleinthisstudy.Theprovisionalconclusionthatsizedoes
not matter (within limits) is relevant as fraternal birth order
research approaches the next step in its evolution, namely
movement into the laboratory.
Blanchard and Bogaert (1996b) proposed that the FBOE
reflects the progressive immunization of some mothers to male-
specific (i.e., Y-linked) antigens by each succeeding male fetus
and the concomitantly increasing effects of anti-male antibodies
on sexual differentiation of the brain in each succeeding male
fetus. According to this maternal immune hypothesis, cells (or
cell fragments) from male fetuses enter the maternal circulation
during childbirth or perhaps earlier in pregnancy. These cells
include substances that occur only on the surfaces of male cells,
primarily male brain cells. The mother’s immune system rec-
ognizes these male-specific molecules as foreign and produces
antibodiestothem.Whenthemotherlaterbecomespregnantwith
another male fetus, her antibodies cross the placental barrier and
enter the fetal brain. Once in the brain, these antibodies bind to
male-specificmoleculesonthesurfaceofneurons.Thisprevents
these neurons from ‘‘wiring-up’’ in the male-typical pattern, so
that the individual will later be attracted to men rather than
women.
Arch Sex Behav
123
 At the time that Blanchard and Bogaert (1996b) advanced
the maternal immune hypothesis as an explanation of the
FBOE, relatively little was known about Y-linked antigens. As
knowledge of Y-linked antigens accumulated in the following
years, however, it became possible to identify candidate anti-
gens for the maternal immune hypothesis according to certain
obvious criteria (e.g., Blanchard & Klassen, 1997). These cri-
teria included tissue localization (brain), timing of expression
(prenatal),andcellularlocation(externalcellmembrane).When
the relevant information became available, Blanchard et al.
(2002) nominated PCDH11Y as one candidate gene/antigen,
andBlanchard(2004)nominatedNLGN4Yasanother.Itwould
not be possible at present to do a prospective study of these
proteins starting with pregnant women, but it is already feasible
to examine mothers of adult males for evidence of past immune
reactions to them, using ELISA or ELISpot assays.
The present study was not focused on methodology per se;
however, some of the graphical and data-analytic approaches
developedinitcanbeappliedmorewidely.TheOlderBrothers
Ratio and Older Brothers Odds Ratio, in particular, are handy
forcomparing FBOEmagnitude indifferent studies(including
futurestudies)inawaythatautomaticallytakesfamilysizeinto
account. I will illustrate this with the particularly interesting
exampleofFrischandHviid(2006).Ididnotincludethisstudy
inmymeta-analysisbecausetherearenotableproblemswithits
raw data (Blanchard, 2007; Blanchard & VanderLaan, 2015),
and because I was interested in generating quantitative esti-
matesfortheOlderBrothersRatioandtheOlderBrothersOdds
Ratio and not simply in demonstrating greater-than/less-than
relationships.Thisstudyisnoteworthy,however,becauseithas
been cited as an important failure to find the FBOE in a very
large sample (Kishida & Rahman, 2015).
From Table 4 in Frisch and Hviid (2006), one can calculate
the(approximate)totalnumbersofolderbrothers,oldersisters,
younger brothers, and younger sisters for the homosexual and
heterosexualgroups.Fromthesesums,itiseasytocalculatethe
Older Brothers Ratios and the Older Brothers Odds Ratio. The
OlderBrothers Ratio forFrisch and Hviid’shomosexual group
was .35 (69971985) and the Older Brothers Ratio for their
heterosexualgroupwas.29(147,7047503,873).Thus,theOlder
Brothers Odds Ratio for this study was 1.20, that is (699 7
1985) 7 (147,704 7 503,873).The99%confidenceinterval
forthisvalueis1.07–1.35.11Thisintervalincludesthepresent
study’sestimatedmeanOlderBrothersOddsRatioof1.27for
non-feminine homosexual groups, but it does not include the
no-effect value of 1.00. Thus, a study that was regarded both
bytheoriginalinvestigatorsandbysubsequentcommentators
as an important failure to detect the FBOE turns out to have
results comparable to those of positive studies when family
size is taken into account.
Limitations
The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was consid-
erable heterogeneity among the feminine/transgender homo-
sexual groups, that is, their observed Older Brothers Odds
Ratios were more different from each other than one would
expect fromrandom error(chance) alone. In otherwords,there
were substantial differences between effect estimates where
similarity of effect estimates is the desirable outcome. When
heterogeneity is present, the pooled effect estimate might not
correspond to any single population. In this study, heterogene-
ity could be theresultofdifferencesin thesubjectsthemselves,
culturaloreconomicdifferencesinfluencingtheirlikelihoodof
attending a gender identity clinic, differences in the methods
usedtocollecttheirsibshipdata,oranycombinationoftheseor
other potentialfactors.Thereare atleasttwo waysin which the
feminine groups were certainly more variable than the non-
feminine groups: They were more diverse geographically and
culturally,andtheyincludedsubjectsexamined inchildhood.I
did not attempt to investigate the unexplained heterogeneity
using subgroups analysis, partly because I did not hypothesize
geography/culture or age at examination as variables before-
hand, and partly because it would be desirable to have a larger
number of feminine/transgender samples (with appropriate
heterosexual controls) before such an analysis is attempted. I
have put all the data used in this study into the‘‘Appendix,’’so

become available.
Conclusion
Fraternal birth order is, by far, the most broadly established fac-
tor influencing sexual orientation in men. The subjects who
contributed siblings to this meta-analysis came from Canada in
the north to Brazil in the south, from Iran in the east to Samoa in
the west.They were born over nearly a 150-year period, starting
in1861(Blanchard&Bogaert,1996a).Somewerepsychiatryor
clinical psychology patients, some were convicted sex offend-
ers,andsomewereresearchvolunteers.Somewereexaminedin

FBOE, especially the underlying mechanism it reflects and
whether the same mechanism completely explains the differ-
ence between feminine/transgender and non-feminine/cisgen-
derhomosexualmales.ThesimplefactoftheFBOE’sexistence,
however, seems almost beyond doubt at this point.
