Objective To examine 27 low-value procedures, as 
defined by international recommendations, in New South 
Wales public hospitals.
Design Analysis of admitted patient data for financial 
years 2010–2011 to 2016–2017.
Main outcome measures Number and proportion 
of episodes identified as low value by two definitions 
(narrower and broader), associated costs and bed-
days, and variation between hospitals in financial year 
2016–2017; trends in numbers of low-value episodes 
from 2010–2011 to 2016–2017.
Results For 27 procedures in 2016–2017, we identified 
5079 (narrower definition) to 8855 (broader definition) 
episodes involving low-value care (11.00%–19.18% 
of all 46 169 episodes involving these services). These 
episodes were associated with total inpatient costs of 
$A49.9 million (narrower) to $A99.3 million (broader), 
which was 7.4% (narrower) to 14.7% (broader) of the 
total $A674.6 million costs for all episodes involving 
these procedures in 2016–2017, and involved 14 348 
(narrower) to 29 705 (broader) bed-days. Half the 
procedures accounted for less than 2% of all low-value 
episodes identified; three of these had no low-value 
episodes in 2016–2017. The proportion of low-value care 
varied widely between hospitals. Of the 14 procedures 
accounting for most low-value care, seven showed 
decreasing trends from 2010–2011 to 2016–2017, 
while three (colonoscopy for constipation, endoscopy for 
dyspepsia, sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma in 
situ) showed increasing trends.
Conclusions Low-value care in this Australian public 
hospital setting is not common for most of the measured 
procedures, but colonoscopy for constipation, endoscopy 
for dyspepsia and sentinel lymph node biopys for 
melanoma in situ require further investigation and action 
to reverse increasing trends. The variation between 
procedures and hospitals may imply different drivers and 
potential remedies.
IntroductIon
One important component of efforts to 
increase value in healthcare is identifying 
and minimising use of ‘low-value care’, 
defined as
use of an intervention where evidence 
suggests it confers no or very little 
benefit on patients, or risk of harm 
exceeds likely benefit, or, more broadly, 
the added costs of the intervention 
do not provide proportional added 
benefits.1
Reducing low-value care is important 
for improving both health outcomes for 
patients and the efficiency of the health 
system. 
Such 
quality 
improvement 
depends on knowing how much low-value 
care occurs, where and why it occurs.
Despite national and international 
campaigns drawing attention to the 
concept of low-value care, including the 
Choosing Wisely and Royal Australasian 
College of Physicians (RACP) EVOLVE 
initiatives,2–4 we have limited under-
standing of the extent of these practices 
in Australia5 6; measurement work to 
date has taken place almost exclusively 
in North America.7 We aimed to use 
indicators based on hospital administra-
tive data to examine low-value care in 
New South Wales (NSW) public hospi-
tals. By restricting to this setting, we 
are estimating low-value care that is the 
responsibility of a single payer (NSW 
Health).
Many 
studies 
of 
low-value 
care 
are based on indirect measures.1 For 
example, geographic variation analysis 
examines rates of services in different 
areas, with the interpretation that higher 
than average rates may be partly due to 
overuse or low-value care. In contrast, 
our work involves direct measurement—
specifically identifying episodes where the 
care appears to be contrary to published 
recommendations.
Our 
study 
provides 
estimates 
of 
low-value care involving 27 procedures in 
the NSW public hospital system in 2016–
2017 and the associated costs, together 
with trends over the preceding 7 years.

Methods
setting and data
NSW is the most populous state of Australia, with 
7.6 
million residents in 2015 ( 
www. 
healthstats. 
nsw. 
gov. 
au). There are 225 public hospitals and 203 
private hospitals.8 For this study, we focused on public 
hospitals, which provided almost 2 
million episodes 
of inpatient care in financial year 2016–2017. Care 
at a public hospital is available free to residents, but 
patients may choose to be admitted to a public hospital 
as a private patient, using private health insurance. We 
included both public and private patients at public 
hospitals in this study.
We used hospital admitted patient data in the Health 
Information Exchange (HIE) data warehouse at the 
NSW Ministry of Health for the seven financial years 
(1 July to 30 June) 2010–2011 to 2016–2017. Hospital 
admissions are recorded as ‘stays’, which comprise one 
or more ‘episodes’. A new episode begins when care 
type changes (eg, from acute care to rehabilitation). 
Details of diagnoses and procedures are recorded for 
each episode.
We extracted the following variables: facility iden-
tifier, stay number and episode sequence number (to 
identify episodes); encrypted patient identifier (to 
identify admissions by the same patient); Australian 
Classification of Health Interventions procedure codes 
(to identify the procedure, and determine if it was low 
value); International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) diag-
nosis codes (to identify if the procedure was low value); 
episode length of stay (for bed-days); and episode start 
and end dates (to limit to study period).
The NSW hospital admissions data allow recording 
up to 50 procedure codes and 55 diagnosis codes. 
These include one principal procedure (which should 
be the procedure the patient was admitted for) and 
one principal diagnosis (which should be the diag-
nosis responsible for most of the hospital stay). For 
most indicators, we accepted procedure and diagnosis 
codes in any position, without distinguishing between 
principal and additional codes. American Society of 
Anesthesiologists risk scores were obtained from the 
sixth digit of the anaesthesia procedure codes.9 Family 
history of disease was recorded if an ICD-10-AM code 
for family history of the disease (a relevant ‘Z’ chapter 
code) was present. Personal history was recorded if 
an ICD-10-AM code for personal history was present 
(relevant ‘Z’ code), or if a code for the disease itself was 
present. For some indicators, we examined diagnosis 
codes for any episodes recorded for the same patient 
in the previous 12 months when looking for diagnoses 
that justify the procedure. However, the data set was 
not fully linked; in general, previous admissions for 
patients could only be identified if they were to the 
same hospital as the index admission.
Total costs for episodes involving low-value care 
were extracted from the NSW Health Activity Based 
Management casemix database to provide an esti-
mate of expenditure associated with providing these 
‘index’ low-value services (ie, only expenditure on the 
episode involving the low-value intervention, not any 
follow-up expenditure that may have resulted at a later 
date due to the index event).
Analysis
We identified low-value episodes for 27 procedures 
(online supplementary table 1) using an approach based 
on seminal work in the USA.10 In brief, international 
and Australian recommendations as to when a test or 
intervention is low value (such as those produced via 
Choosing Wisely,3 11–13 RACP EVOLVE4 and the UK 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ‘do 
not do’ recommendations14) were reviewed to identify 
those that are measurable in the data. For a recom-
mendation to be measurable, we applied previously 
reported criteria15:
1. It had to relate to care that can occur in the NSW inpa-
tient setting.
2. It had to involve a service that can be recorded in the 
admissions data (eg, prescribing and pathology requests 
are not recorded in this data set).
3. It had to be possible to reasonably identify low-value 
care using the variables in the data.
4. The care had to be normally recorded in the data (eg, 
Australian Coding Rules state that most imaging proce-
dures are ‘not normally coded’).
We translated the 27 measurable recommendations 
into operational definitions expressed in terms of the 
variables in the data set (online supplementary table 
1). Because terms in the recommendation often do 
not map directly to data variables, and diagnosis and 
procedure codes may not precisely identify patients for 
whom care is low value, there is inherent uncertainty in 
identifying whether an intervention is low value when 
using administrative data. To account for this uncer-
tainty, following the method implemented by Schwartz 
et al,10 we created narrower and broader definitions of 
low-value care.15 We first developed a narrower defini-
tion that aimed to capture only low-value care, at risk 
of not identifying all low-value care, then broadened 
the criteria to try to capture all low-value care, at risk 
of including appropriate care (see online supplemen-
tary box 1 for example). We then convened a work-
shop where 27 clinicians reviewed the overall method, 
and then in groups reviewed three to five indicators 
each for face validity and acceptability (see online 
supplementary box 2 for specialties involved in the 
review).15 In addition, a health information manager 
reviewed the indicators to identify inappropriate or 
omitted diagnosis and procedure codes.
Our analysis was from the health payer perspective, 
using a ‘service-based measure’, one of three low-value 
care measurement perspectives detailed in the frame-
work by Chalmers et al.16 We identified episodes in 
which each procedure was provided, and calculated

the proportion of these that were low value. This 
measure provides an indication of how much health 
system activity is low value.
Our main analysis is a snapshot for financial year 
2016–2017 that provides a baseline for future moni-
toring. We present numbers and proportions of 
low-value care for the 27 procedures, together with the 
costs and bed-days associated with these episodes for 
NSW as a whole. We also show the variation between 
hospitals. For each procedure, smoothed 99% bino-
mial control limits around the mean state rate were 
calculated for each hospital using the number of 
procedures provided by the hospital.17 Hospitals with 
percentages of low-value episodes outside these limits 
were classified as having high or low rates. To ensure 
sufficient numbers when examining hospital varia-
tion, we excluded hospitals that did not perform the 
procedure in at least five episodes in 2016–2017 (these 
hospitals are regarded as not normally performing the 
procedure), and then excluded procedures that did not 
occur at more than five hospitals (to preserve hospital 
anonymity).
For the 14 procedures with highest levels of low-value 
care in 2016–2017, we estimated average percentage 
changes in numbers of low-value episodes over finan-
cial years 2010–2011 to 2016–2017. Numbers of 
narrower and broader definition low-value procedures 
and non-low-value procedures are plotted for each 
financial year.
Analysis was conducted in R V
.3.4.1 (

project.

SQL queries in the HIE Sybase IQ server.
results
In total for the 27 procedures in 2016–2017, we 
identified 5079 episodes as low value according 
to our narrower definitions, or 8855 as low value 
according to the broader definitions. These accounted 
for 11.00% (broader, 19.18%) of all 46 
169 episodes 
involving any of these procedures. Figure 1 and 
table 1 provide an overall summary of the study. Thir-
teen of the 27 procedures accounted for 1.1% of the 
low-value episodes. Three of these (postoperative 
radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy, endometrial 
biopsy for investigation of infertility and electrocon-
vulsive therapy in children) had no low-value care in 
NSW public hospitals in 2016–2017.
The total cost of episodes involving low-value care for 
these 27 procedures in 2016–2017 was $A49.9 million 
(narrower) to $A99.3 million (broader) (table 2). This 
was 7.4% (narrower) to 14.7% (broader) of the total 
$A674.6 million costs for all episodes involving these 
procedures in 2016–2017. Abdominal hysterectomy 
accounted for the greatest total costs for low-value 
care ($A10.5 million (narrower) to $A17.1 million 
(broader); median $A9700 per episode), followed 
by 
endoscopy 
($A10.4 
million 
(narrower) 
to 
$A12.8 million (broader); median $A2200 per 
episode) and colonoscopy ($A9.4 million (narrower) 
to $A13.4 million (broader); median $A6735 per 
episode). Episodes involving low-value care for these 
27 procedures accounted for 14 
348 (narrower) to 
29 
705 (broader) bed-days in 2016–2017 (table 2).

involving the procedure at more than five hospitals in 
2016–2017. Almost all of these procedures had hospi-
tals with low-value rates higher than the upper 99% 
control limit. Many procedures also had hospitals with 
rates below the lower 99% control limit. Abdominal 
hysterectomy and knee arthroscopy were associated 
with the greatest variation in rates between hospitals.
Seven of the 14 procedures accounting for 99% 
of low-value episodes showed a decreasing trend in 
numbers of low-value episodes, while three showed 
an increasing trend (figures 1 and 3). Compared 
with 2010–2011, there were 40% (narrower) to 
21% (broader) fewer low-value knee arthroscopies in 
2016–2017 and 17% 
fewer total knee arthroscopies. 
Almost all renal artery angioplasties were identified as 
low value, and use decreased by 34% (44 episodes) 
over the 7 years. In contrast, low-value endoscopies 
in people <55 years were 44% (narrower) to 67% 
(broader) higher in 2016–2017 while total endoscopies 
in this age group were 13% higher than in 2010–2011.
dIscussIon
Following the approach Schwartz et al10 used to 
measure 26 investigations and procedures in the US 
Medicare population,10 we developed indicators 
of low-value care for 27 procedures in NSW public 
hospitals. Half of these procedures were associated 
with negligible low-value care in this setting. Of the 
remaining 14 procedures, seven showed a decreasing 
trend, and only three an increasing trend, in low-value 
care. Berwick and Hackbarth18 famously estimated 
(in a US context) that 30% of healthcare is ‘waste’.18 
This included categories such as fraud, administrative 
waste, pricing failures and low-value care. Our study 
of only 27 procedures offers a glimpse of the low-value 
care contribution to the ‘waste’ figure in Australia. It

All costs are in $A. Note that costs and bed-days are totals for the episodes in which the low-value procedure occurred, and include all other procedures that occurred in those episodes. Costs are only available 
for episodes that receive activity-based funding.
High volume means the number of low-value episodes in 2016–2017 was greater than or equal to the median number (23). High proportion means the percentage of procedures identified as low value in 2016–
2017 was greater than or equal to the median percentage (12.5%).

is encouraging that 13 of the public hospital inpatient 
procedures we could measure show negligible levels of 
low-value care in NSW
. Also, procedures such as knee 
arthroscopy that are widely recognised as being low 
value are already decreasing in this setting. Neverthe-
less, low-value care is clearly prevalent in this setting, 
consuming considerable resources in dollar terms as 
well as bed-days.
Several denominators are possible in presenting 
low-value care measures.16 We used a service denomi-
nator, primarily because our interest was in the health 
system perspective, but also because our data were 
limited to the public hospital setting. Most similar 
studies have used patient-population or patient-indi-
cation denominators, and cannot be directly compared 
with our results.16 For example, while we found about 
20% of carotid endarterectomies in NSW public 
hospitals were low value, Schwartz et al reported 
that 0.1 per 100 US Medicare beneficiaries received a 
low-value carotid endarterectomy.10 With 1.2 
million 
NSW residents aged 65 years and over, our 80–93 
low-value carotid endarterectomies in public hospitals 
would be much less than 0.1 per 100 populations over 
65, but we do not know how many low-value endar-
terectomies occur in private hospitals.
Based on numbers and trends, the 27 procedures fall 
into three groups that may require different responses 
(figure 1). For the 13 procedures with very low 
numbers of low-value episodes and the seven that are 
decreasing, background surveillance is appropriate to 
detect and respond to ‘outbreaks’. On the other hand, 
the three procedures with high numbers of potentially 
low-value episodes and increasing trends are a priority 
for further investigation to understand the drivers and 
determine what can and should be done to reduce 
low-value use of these procedures. The remaining four 
procedures with no clear trend should also be investi-
gated further. The lack of state-wide trend may result 
from different regional trends, with the potential to 
learn from regions with decreasing trends to gain rapid 
turnaround in regions with increasing trends.
Further investigation of these procedures will 
initially involve more detailed analyses of the hospital 
admissions data to identify factors associated with high 
or low counts and rates of low-value care, or factors 
associated with differing trends between regions or 
hospitals. The wide variation between hospitals indi-
cates the potential to reduce low-value care. Even if 
some low-value care is inevitable because of clinical 
uncertainty, arguably hospitals with high rates should 
be able to reduce their low-value episodes at least 
to the state average. We intend to investigate factors 
explaining the variation in future work. Studies in 
other countries have identified associations between 
patient characteristics and low-value care,19 20 and 
associations with the number of specialists in an area,20 
and we will go on to explore these possibilities in our 
setting. As patients can elect to be treated privately in

Figure 2 Variation in use of selected low-value procedures in New South Wales (NSW) hospitals. Each point represents one hospital performing the 
relevant procedure. The red bars indicate the state average proportion, and grey points are consistent with the state average. Orange points are above and 
blue points below 99% control limits around the state rate. For definitions of low-value care, see online supplementary table 1. ERCP, endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography; EVAR, endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.
NSW public hospitals, another interesting question 
is whether low-value care differs between public and 
private patients in these hospitals. In the USA, payer 
type and insurance status do not seem to affect rates of 
low-value care.21 22
Most procedures in this study have value for many 
patients. For example, colonoscopy is a high-value 
investigative and interventional procedure in bowel 
cancer and other gastrointestinal conditions. However, 
in younger patients with no indication other than 
constipation, colonoscopy has a lower diagnostic yield 
than in general population screening.23 Our indica-
tors aim to specifically identify patients for whom the 
procedures are low value—a ‘direct’ measure. This is 
important, as indirect measurements based on overall 
rates of procedures carry the risk that providers might 
reduce all use of services—high-value and low-value—
rather than just low-value use. To avoid this possibility, 
we only developed indicators for recommenda-
tions where we and clinicians we consulted believed 
low-value care could be identified with reasonable 
specificity.15
In defining when a procedure is low value, we 
relied on recommendations from Choosing Wisely 
and similar sources. Choosing Wisely lists have been 
criticised for having too many low-impact items,24 and 
for unclear processes and variable criteria for incor-
porating evidence into item development.25 While the 
low-value status of many Choosing Wisely services 
is generally supported by sound evidence, including 
clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews or 
randomised controlled trials, this is not universal.26 
We did not critique the evidence base for each of the 
Choosing Wisely recommendations that we measure, 
but rather have taken them at face value on the basis 
of having been developed by reputable professional 
bodies. Recommendations we took from other sources 
were based on systematic reviews or randomised 
controlled trials.
Like all direct low-value care measurement studies, 
our estimates are limited by the data available, which 
do not include the detailed clinical information often 
required to make treatment decisions.27 Because of 
uncertainty in whether individual procedures are truly 
inappropriate, we have reported estimates based on 
narrower and broader criteria, following the approach 
taken in the USA.10 The differences between the 
narrower and broader results can be seen to reflect any 
differences between the true low-value care rate and 
our estimates, and illustrate the implications of such 
differences for the health system response to low-value 
care.10
Our indicators are specific to the recommenda-
tions they are based on, and do not consider other 
possible inappropriate use of the procedures. For 
example, Choosing Wisely Canada also recommends 
against repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms that 
are <5.5 cm for men or <5 cm for women. We do

Figure 3 Estimates of low-value care from financial year 2010–2011 to 2016–2017 for 14 procedures with most episodes involving low-
value care (narrower definition) in 2016–2017. For definitions of low-value care, see online supplementary table 1. ERCP, endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography; EVAR, endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; VUR, vesicoureteric reflux. 
not have access to aneurysm size so our indicator for 
endovascular repair would consider repair of a small 
aneurysm as not low value unless the patient met our 
criteria of high risk; thus it is a conservative measure.
Our cost and bed-day estimates simply sum the values 
for the low-value episodes. For some procedures, appro-
priate care would still involve hospital admission, so 
the cost and bed-day values overestimate the potential 
resources that could be redirected towards better value 
care.
The data also governed which recommendations we 
could measure. The 27 procedures are those we could 
measure, not necessarily the most important for health 
system efficiency or patient outcomes, and clinicians 
in Australia may not have recognised these services as 
requiring action, as most of them were selected from 
international lists. In addition, we used public hospital 
inpatient data only, so could not capture low-value 
care occurring in other settings, such as the emergency 
department, general practice or private hospitals. We 
also could not measure low-value prescribing or test 
ordering, although the large number of recommenda-
tions relating to prescribing and test ordering suggests 
clinical groups find these areas of great concern.28 A 
full understanding of the societal impact of low-value 
care requires estimates across the entire health sector, as 
well as measurement of the downstream consequences 
of low-value care, such as adverse events, side effects, 
hospitalisations, procedures and associated costs that 
might result from the index event. However, as a starting 
point we contend that effective action is more likely in 
response to estimates related to a clearly defined setting 
under the responsibility of a single payer, as provided 
here.
Any action based on these results needs to be carefully 
considered, to avoid undermining the clinician good-
will associated with Choosing Wisely.29 The stated aim 
of Choosing Wisely is to increase conversation among 
clinicians and patients about what care confers tangible 
benefit. Feedback of these results to hospitals and clini-
cians, perhaps in partnership with Choosing Wisely, can 
add to this conversation, providing information about 
what low-value services are increasing or decreasing, 
or why hospitals vary in their levels of low-value care. 
Provider feedback has been found effective in some, but 
not all, evaluations.30 Simple interventions with minimal 
impact on clinician autonomy, such as requiring that a 
physician request permission for a procedure, can also 
work to reduce low-value procedures.31
Although we classified half of our procedures as 
having negligible low-value care, this should not be taken 
as suggesting low-value care is not a problem in NSW

public hospitals. Most procedures we measured are inva-
sive and expensive, with clear surgical risks to patients. 
In the USA, low-cost high-volume services make the 
greatest contribution to low-value care.32 In NSW
, we 
should acknowledge these results and look elsewhere to 
new data sources for examining less invasive, potentially 
low-value care, but with much higher rates of utilisation, 
such as unnecessary diagnostic testing or imaging.
Reducing low-value care has the potential to improve 
outcomes for patients while reducing costs. Our 
results provide a baseline for understanding the extent 
of the phenomenon, and for monitoring the effects 
of programmes aimed at highlighting and reducing 
low-value care, such as Choosing Wisely Australia3 or 
the EVOLVE initiative of the RACP
.4 As is occurring 
internationally, indicators such as those developed here 
will continue to be refined with input from clinical and 
research communities, and new indicators will be added 
as campaigns such as Choosing Wisely further articulate 
what constitutes low-value care in specific instances. 
Measurement is a crucial precondition to support clin-
ical and policy communities to explore the drivers and 
potential remedies for low-value care.
