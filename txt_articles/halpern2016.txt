IMPORTANCE Studies demonstrate that use of prostate-specific antigen screening decreased
significantly following the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation
against prostate-specific antigen screening in 2012.
OBJECTIVE To determine downstream effects on practice patterns in prostate cancer
diagnosis and treatment following the 2012 USPSTF recommendation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Procedural volumes of certifying and recertifying
urologists from 2009 through 2016 were evaluated for variation in prostate biopsy and
radical prostatectomy (RP) volume. Trends were confirmed using the New York Statewide
Planning and Research Cooperative System and Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The study
included a representative sample of urologists across practice settings and nationally
representative sample of all RP discharges. We obtained operative case logs from the
American Board of Urology and identified urologists performing at least 1 prostate biopsy
(n = 5173) or RP (n = 3748), respectively.
EXPOSURES The 2012 USPSTF recommendation against routine population-wide
prostate-specific antigen screening.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in median biopsy and RP volume per urologist and
national procedural volume.
RESULTS Following the USPSTF recommendation, median biopsy volume per urologist
decreased from 29 to 21 (interquartile range [IQR}, 12-34; P<.001). After adjusting for
physician and practice characteristics, biopsy volume decreased by 28.7% following 2012
(parameter estimate, −0.25; SE, 0.03; P < .001). Similarly, following the USPSTF
recommendation, median RP volume per urologist decreased from 7 (IQR, 3-15) to 6 (IQR,
2-12) (P < .001), and in adjusted analyses, RP volume decreased 16.2% (parameter estimate,
−0.15; SE, 0.05; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Following the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, prostate
biopsy and RP volumes decreased significantly. A panoramic vantage point is needed to
evaluate the long-term consequences of the 2012 USPSTF recommendation.

P
rostate cancer is the most common nondermatologic
malignancy among men in the United States, with an
estimated 220 000 new cases and 27 540 deaths in
2015.1 Owing to its high incidence and the potential for cure
with early detection, population-based screening programs
were widely implemented in the United States during the
1990s. However, following the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian Cancer randomized clinical trial2 showing no mortal-
ity benefit to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, the US
PreventiveServicesTaskForce(USPSTF)recommendedagainst
population-based PSA screening in 2012.2
Following the USPSTF recommendation against prostate
cancer screening, the use of screening PSA and and digital rec-
tal examinations decreased substantially over the ensuing
years.3-6 These sequelae raise the undesirable possibility that
the decline in screening may ultimately result in excess mor-
tality and adverse cancer-specific outcomes.7,8 Given these
concerns, it is critical to examine the downstream effects of
decreased PSA screening to inform future policy. Single-
institutional studies demonstrate a reduction in prostate bi-
opsies following the USPSTF recommendation; however, na-
tionally representative studies are lacking.9,10 Moreover, there
is a dearth of studies evaluating national practice patterns in
prostate cancer treatment following the USPSTF recommen-
dation. We sought to determine changes in practice patterns
inprostatebiopsyandradicalprostatectomy(RP)followingthe
2012USPSTFrecommendationusingproceduralvolumesfrom
a nationally representative sample of urologists and then vali-
dating with biopsy volumes from New York state and RP vol-
ume from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS).
Methods
Data Source
We obtained operative case logs from the American Board of
Urology (ABU) for urologists applying for certification be-
tween 2009 and 2016 (n = 5270). The ABU is the national
agency responsible for conferring urology board certification
on licensed US medical practitioners. Eligible candidates for
initial board certification or recertification are required to sub-
mit operative case logs for 6 consecutive months during the
18-month period preceding the certification application date.
Logs include all procedures captured by Healthcare Common
Procedural Coding System code that are billed by the candi-
date urologist. Of note, the case log for application in a par-
ticular year documents cases that were actually performed in
theprioryear.Forexample,arecertificationapplicationfor2015
is accompanied by a case log documenting procedures per-
formed in 2014. Recertification is mandated every 10 years for
all practicing urologists with the exception of those who were
initially certified prior to 1985. Thus, annual aggregate case log
data represent approximately 10% of practicing urologists.
We identified all urologists who applied for ABU initial cer-
tificationorrecertificationwhoperformedatleast1prostatebi-
opsy (n = 5173) or RP (n = 3748). Prostate biopsy was identified

Datafrom2additionalsourceswereusedtovalidatetrends
within the ABU data. First, we identified all prostate biopsies
performed within the New York Statewide Planning and Re-
search Cooperative System between 2011 and 2014. The New
York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System is
a comprehensive, all-payer reporting system within New York
state that captures both inpatient and outpatient clinical en-
counters.Usingthesedata,trendsinprostatebiopsieswerede-
lineated according to biopsy indication that was obtained from
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diag-
nosis codes associated with each biopsy and not available in
the ABU data. Second, we queried the Healthcare Cost and Uti-
lization Project NIS provided by the Agency for the Health-
care Research and Quality to examine national trends in an-
nual hospitalizations for RP. The NIS is a 20% sample of
discharges from all community hospitals participating in
HealthcareCostandUtilizationProject,whichrepresentsmore
than 95% of the US population.13 We used International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure code 60.5 to
identify all RPs performed over time.
A waiver of Weill Cornell Medicine institutional review
board approval for the study was granted by the Office of Re-
searchIntegritybecausenoidentifiablepatientinformationwas
obtained for the current analysis. As such, no patient or sur-
geon consent was required.
Statistical Analysis and Variables
Summary statistics including median and interquartile range
(IQR) were used to describe the number of procedures and sur-
geon characteristics before and after the USPSTF recommen-
dation. Surgeon characteristics included sex, urologic subspe-
cialty (self-reported by each certifying physician), surgeon
practice region, and population as reported by the ABU. Ow-
ing to the stepwise evolution in the USPSTF recommenda-
tion during the course of multiple publications from October
2011 through May 2012, we used 2012 as the threshold to de-
tect change in use, consistent with prior studies.2,14,15 Com-
parison of the number of procedures in the 4-year intervals
prior (2009-2012) and following (2013-2016) the cutoff were
performed using t test and χ2 test, where applicable. Log-
linear regression was performed to identify predictors of pro-
cedural volume and assess trends following the USPSTF rec-
ommendation.Sensitivityanalyseswereperformedtoevaluate

Results
Trends in Prostate Biopsy
Following the USPSTF recommendation, the median prostate
biopsy volume among urologists decreased from 29 (IQR,
16-44) to 21 (IQR, 12-34) (P < .001) (Table 1). The temporal
trend in total prostate biopsy volume is presented in Figure 1.
Prostate biopsy volume decreased the most in practice set-
tings of less than 100 000 people in the population (median,
29; IQR, 19-45 vs median, 19; IQR, 11-29; P < .001). Addition-
ally, there was slight regional variation in median prostate
biopsy volume with the fewest biopsies performed in the
New England region (median, 27; IQR, 15-42). The temporal
trend in prostate biopsy volume in the New York Statewide
Planning and Research Cooperative System is presented in
eFigure 1 in the Supplement. Following the USPSTF recom-
mendation, the total number of annual biopsies decreased by
12.7%. The greatest decrease in biopsy volume was seen in
those biopsies performed for an indication of abnormal PSA
(26.7%), whereas biopsy volume for an indication of cancer
surveillance increased by 28.8% during the study period (597
vs 769; P<.001).

istics, there remained a significant 28.7% decrease in biopsy
volume following 2012 (PE [SE], −0.25 [0.03]; P<.001).
Trends in Radical Prostatectomy
Following the USPSTF recommendation, median RP volume
per urologist decreased from 7 (IQR, 3-15) to 6 (IQR, 2-12)
(P < .001) (Table 3). Temporal trend in total RP volume is pre-
sented in Figure 2. Radical prostatectomy volume decreased
among urologists practicing in all population densities ex-
cept practice settings with populations of 100 000 to 250 000
people. There was regional variation in RP volume, with New
England urologists performing the fewest RPs (median, 4; IQR,
2-11) and North Central urologists performing the most (me-
dian, 8; IQR, 3-16.5). Similarly, the number of hospital dis-
charges following RP from the NIS decreased by 30.3% (from
83 881 to 58 430) following the USPSTF recommendation
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Linearregressionrevealedthatcertificationyearafter2012
was associated with lower RP volume (PE [SE], −0.15 [0.05];

cialty were associated with increased RP volume (PE [SE], 0.77
[0.13]; P < .001 and 0.94 [0.09]; P < .001, respectively). Radi-
cal prostatectomy volume significantly varied by geographic
region, with lower RP volume in the New England practices
compared with the North Central, South Central, Southeast-
ern, and Western practice regions (PE [SE], 0.58 [0.08], 0.38
[0.09], 0.29 [0.08], and 0.37 [0.08], respectively; all P < .001).
Practice region of greater than 1 million was associated with
higher RP volume (PE [SE], 0.35 [0.07]; P < .001). After ad-
justing for physician and practice characteristics, there re-
mained a significant 16.2% decrease in RP volume following
2012 (PE [SE], −0.15 [0.05]; P=.003).
Discussion
The 2012 USPSTF recommendation against PSA screening was
associated with drastic change in US prostate cancer screen-
ing practices. Following the 2012 USPSTF recommendation,
multiple studies demonstrate a substantial decrease in PSA
screening and incidence of early-stage prostate cancer follow-
ingtheUSPSTFrecommendation.3,4However,fewstudieshave
examined the downstream effects of the effect of the USPSTF
recommendation on diagnostic and therapeutic prostate can-
cer practice patterns.
We present the novel finding of a decrease in RP volume
forprostatecancerfollowingtheUSPSTFrecommendation.Al-
though the reason for this decline is likely multifactorial, stem-
mingfromadecreaseintheincidenceofprostatecanceraswell
as greater adoption of active surveillance for low-risk prostate
cancer and treatment substitution with nonsurgical thera-
pies, our finding that RP volume has declined is noteworthy
given that peak RP rates occurred in the mid 1990s following
the advent of PSA testing.16,17 Additionally, we found that na-
tional variation in prostate cancer care persists, as previously
demonstrated in 1993 by Lu-Yao et al,17 who found lower rates
ofRPintheNewEnglandandMid-AtlanticregionsoftheUnited
States.17
Wealsofoundasignificantdecreaseinprostatebiopsyvol-
ume following the USPSTF recommendation, consistent with
single-institutional studies. Banerji et al10 evaluated the num-
ber of prostate biopsies performed at an academic institution
during the 30-month period before and after the USPSTF rec-
ommendation and found a 31% decrease in the number of
biopsies. Likewise, McGinley et al9 examined biopsy rates in
a large urology group practice of 32 physicians and found a

significant decrease following the USPSTF recommendation.
Ournationalstudyisnoteworthybecausewedemonstrategeo-
graphic variation in prostate biopsy volumes across aca-
demic and community practice settings and health plans and
demonstrate an overall decrease in prostate biopsies follow-
ing USPSTF recommendation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate changing trends in the in-
dications for prostate biopsy, with fewer patients undergoing
this procedure for abnormal PSA. This finding strengthens the
associational relationship found in prior studies insofar as it di-
rectly links decreased PSA testing with biopsy volume. In con-
trast, the number of biopsies performed for active surveil-
lance of prostate cancer has increased, consistent with studies
demonstrating an uptake in observation of men with low-risk
prostate cancer.18
Expertshaveexpressedconcernregardingthelong-termef-
fect of the USPSTF recommendation on prostate cancer–
specificmorbidityandmortalityintheUnitedStates.7Thiscon-
cern is reinforced by the findings of this study demonstrating
that decreased prostate cancer screening has been accompa-
nied by a downtrend in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
for prostate cancer. However, given that lead time associated
with PSA screening is estimated at 5 to 7 years and the indolent
natureofprostatecancer,aresultantincreaseinprostatecancer–
specific mortality would likely remain undetectable for an-
otherdecade.19Thus,longer-termpopulation-basedstudieswill
be necessary to determine the true effect of the USPSTF rec-
ommendation on prostate cancer–specific mortality.
Our findings must be interpreted within the context of the
study design. First, the study population represents approxi-
mately 10% of all practicing urologists per year, which may in-
troduce sampling bias, and our volume decrease estimates

likely underestimate the true shift in procedural volume be-
cause trained urologists before 1985 do not require recertifi-
cation,andtheremaybenonboard-certifiedproceduraliststhat
we are not capturing. However, ABU data have been used
widely to assess practice pattern changes across the spec-
trumofurologicproceduresandconditions.12,20-22Second,ABU
data consist of self-reported 6-month case logs from indi-
vidual practitioners’billing software, and the ABU reserves the
righttoauditallsubmittedcaselogs.Practitionerstypicallysub-
mitHealthcareCommonProceduralCodingSystemcodesfrom
accounting software.23 Therefore, there is no reason to sus-
pect overestimation or underestimation of procedural vol-
ume.Third,theNISdoesnotcaptureoutpatientRP,whichmay
account for an increasing proportion of RP owing to favorable
reimbursement in the out-of-network preferred provider or-
ganization setting. This could result in the underestimation of
RP volume, which may contribute to the observed down-
trend. Finally, the trends evaluated herein cannot be inter-
preted as the causal effects of the USPSTF recommendation
alone. Many other factors may have contributed to the down-
trend in procedural volume such as the uptake of active sur-
veillance,substitutionwithalternativetherapies,uptakeofMRI,
use of biomarkers to improve risk stratification in the setting
of abnormal PSA, and concerns regarding biopsy-related
morbidity.16,18,24 Therefore, it is difficult to delineate the ex-
act contribution of these additional factors.
Conclusions
Following the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, prostate bi-
opsy and RP volumes decreased significantly. These findings
represent the direct downstream effects of the USPSTF rec-
ommendation. While the pendulum of prostate cancer screen-
ing continues to swing, a more extended vantage point is
needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of the 2012
USPSTF recommendation with regard to stage at presenta-
tion, outcomes following treatment, and disease-specific mor-
tality in prostate cancer. Because revision of the USPSTF rec-
ommendation is in progress, policy makers should weigh the
downstream effects of the 2012 USPSTF recommendation and
consider future unintended consequences.
