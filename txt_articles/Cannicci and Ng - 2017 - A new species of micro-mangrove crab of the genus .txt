Abstract
The sesarmid genus Haberma Ng & Schubart, 2002, currently contains two species of small mangrove 
crabs with the first two pairs of the male ambulatory legs possessing characteristic subchelate dactyli 
and propodi. A new species, H. tingkok, is here described from Hong Kong. It can be separated 
from H. nanum Ng & Schubart, 2002 (from Singapore), and H. kamora Rahayu & Ng, 2005 (from 
Indonesian Papua) by its carapace shape, proportions of the ambulatory legs, and structures of the 
male pleon and male first gonopod.

Introduction
The genus Haberma was established by Ng and Schubart (2002) for a small species of 
mangrove sesarmid crab from Singapore, H. nanum; and was characterised by an entire

lateral carapace margin, the absence of stridulatory ridges and tubercles on the male chela 
and dactylus, and the possession of subchelate male first and second ambulatory legs. A 
second species, H. kamora Rahayu & Ng, 2005, was subsequently described from Papua 
in Indonesia. In this paper, a third species from mangroves in Hong Kong is described.
The sesarmid fauna of Hong Kong is not well studied. Stimpson (1858, 1907) 
reported four species of Sesarmidae Dana, 1851, s. str., and Shen (1940) recognised 
only seven species from the territories. Soh (1978) was the first to do a major study, 
recording 15 species of which four were new records and three were new species. Of 
the new species, Naruse and Ng (2008) synonymised Holometopus serenei Soh, 1978, 
under Chiromantes haematocheir (De Haan, 1833). One recent taxonomic change is 
recognising what had been called “Parasesarma plicatum (Latreille, 1803)” as Parases-
arma affine (De Haan, 1837) instead (Rahayu and Ng 2010). Perisesarma maipoensis 
(Soh, 1978), previously regarded as a Hong Kong endemic, is now also known from 
Vietnam (Ng et al. 2010). Rahayu and Ng (2005: 24) recorded Parasesarma tripectinis 
(Shen, 1940) from Hong Kong, and noted it was a senior synonym of Parasesarma 
acis Davie, 1993 (see also Ng et al. 2008). It can be expected that with more intensive 
surveys, additional species of Sesarmidae will be discovered.
The terminology used follows that in Ng et al. (2008) and Davie et al. (2015). 
Measurements, in millimetres, provided are of the maximum carapace width and 
length, respectively. The following abbreviations are used: G1 = male first gonopod; 
G2 = male second gonopod; P2–P5 = pereopods 2–5 (ambulatory legs 1–4). Material 
examined is deposited in the Swire Institute of Marine Science of the University of 
Hong Kong (SWIMS); the Zoological Reference Collection of the Lee Kong Chian 
Natural History Museum, National University of Singapore (ZRC); and the Zoological 
Museum of Florence University (MZUF).

in having the lateral margins of the carapace gently concave, resembling the condition 
observed in H. kamora (Fig. 6B) but the carapace still looks relatively quadrate and the 
supraorbital margin is less sloping. Its subchelate P2 and P3 are less prominent, mainly

because the setae on the distal margin of the propodus and that of the dactylus are less 
developed, being very short. In addition, its pleon is less semicircular in shape, being 
more triangular and closer to that observed in H. kamora (Fig. 6D).
Colour. In life, carapace dark brown with light brown mottling; ambulatory legs 
mottled brown with darker bands on carpi and propodi; chelae light-orange to orange, 
with fingers darker coloured (Fig. 1A, B). Ventral surfaces of cephalothorax and am-
bulatory legs light yellow with numerous fine brown spots (Fig. 1B).
Etymology. The species is named after the Ting Kok mangrove area, which has 
been designated a “Site of Special Scientific Interest” in Hong Kong. The name is used 
as a noun in apposition.
Remarks. Haberma tingkok sp. n. can easily be separated from H. nanum Ng & 
Schubart, 2002, and H. kamora Rahayu & Ng, 2005, by the carapace appearing pro-
portionately broader (Fig. 3A) rather than more distinctly quadrate (Fig. 6A, B). While 
their carapace width to length proportions do not differ substantially, this difference in 
carapace shape is due mainly to the lateral margins of H. tingkok being straighter and 
less sinuous (Fig. 3A); which in H. nanum and H. kamora, are distinctly more sinu-
ous (Fig. 6A, B). This also affects the shape of the supraorbital margin. In H. tingkok, 
the margin is relatively longer and gently curves laterally to the external orbital tooth 
(Fig. 3A). In H. nanum and H. kamora, the supraorbital margin appears shorter as it 
curves obliquely to the margin (Fig. 6A, B). This difference in carapace shape applies 
for both sexes (Fig. 2). In addition, the male P4 and P5 propodi are prominently more 
elongated (Fig. 2A, 4D, E) than those of H. nanum and H. kamora (Fig. 6A, B). The 
margin of the frontal lobe of H. tingkok is the most convex in the genus (Fig. 3A); in 
H. nanum, the margin is almost straight (Fig. 6A) whilst in H. kamora, it is gently con-
vex (Fig. 6B). The male telson of H. tingkok is distinctive as it is semicircular (Figs 3B, 
4F); in H. nanum and H. kamora, the telsons are relatively longer and more triangular 
(Fig. 6C, D). The distal chitinous part of the G1 of H. tingkok (Fig. 4H–L) is more 
curved than that of H. nanum (cf. Ng and Schubart 2002: fig. 4B, C); and while it is 
more similar in form to that of H. kamora, the chitinous distal part of the G1 of this 
species is relatively longer (cf. Rahayu and Ng 2005: fig. 3H, I).
One character not described in Ng and Schubart (2002) and Rahayu and Ng 
(2005) is the presence of a short, uneven ridge on the outer surface of the ambulatory 
merus, at the subdistal part just before the carpus (Fig. 4B–E). It is present on all the 
legs, being more prominent in P2 and P3. This ridge is present also in H. nanum and 
H. kamora, but is relatively less well developed compared to H. tingkok.
Ecology. The specimens were found climbing trees of Kandelia obovata Sheue, 
Liu & Yong, 2003, and Aegiceras corniculatus (L.) Bianco, 1837, in the mid intertidal 
area of the Ting Kok mangrove stand, in Tolo Harbour. The area is the largest man-
grove stand on the eastern coast of Hong Kong and is largely dominated by K. obovata 
trees, up to 3 m tall. All specimens, including the ovigerous females, were collected at 
a height of approximately 1.5–1.8 m above the substrate, walking on the bark of the 
branches at ebbing and low tides.
