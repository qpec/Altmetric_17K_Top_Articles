Background-—Financial barriers to health care are associated with worse outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
Yet, it is unknown whether the prevalence of financial barriers and their relationship with post-AMI outcomes vary by sex among
young adults.
Methods and Results-—We assessed sex differences in patient-reported financial barriers among adults aged <55 years with AMI
using data from the Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients study. We examined the prevalence
of financial barriers and their association with health status 12 months post-AMI. Among 3437 patients, more women than men
reported financial barriers to medications (22.3% vs 17.2%; P=0.001), but rates of financial barriers to services were similar (31.3%
vs 28.9%; P=0.152). In multivariable linear regression models adjusting for baseline health, psychosocial status, and clinical
characteristics, compared with no financial barriers, women and men with financial barriers to services and medications had worse
mental functional status (Short Form-12 mental health score: mean difference [MD]=�3.28 and �3.35, respectively), greater
depressive symptomatology (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: MD, 2.18 and 2.16), lower quality of life (Seattle Angina
Questionnaire–Quality of Life: MD, �4.98 and �7.66), and higher perceived stress (Perceived Stress Score: MD, 3.76 and 3.90; all
P<0.05). There was no interaction between sex and financial barriers.
Conclusions-—Financial barriers to care are common in young patients with AMI and associated with worse health outcomes
1 year post-AMI. Whereas women experienced more financial barriers than men, the association did not vary by sex. These findings
emphasize the importance of addressing financial barriers to recovery post-AMI in young adults. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:

oung women (aged ≤55 years) with acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) have worse health outcomes, including
poorer health status, higher mortality, and greater risk for
readmission, than similarly aged men.1–4 The reasons for
these disparities remain largely unexplained. Whereas some
reports reveal higher rates of certain comorbidities among
young women with AMI, many studies have found weak or no
sex differences in relevant risk factors.5–8 Few studies have
evaluated the effect of socioeconomic factors on health
outcomes in young patients. Yet, studies in older AMI
populations have shown that older adults with financial
barriers to health care have a greater risk of rehospitalization,
poorer quality of life, and longer delays in seeking care than
patients without financial barriers.9,10
Financial barriers may be uniquely relevant for younger
women with AMI. Women in the general population are more
likely than men to delay needed care, postpone preventive
health services, and skip doses of medications attributed to
cost.11–14 These differences may be attributed to financial
inequities given that, in aggregate, women have higher rates
of poverty and lower wages than men and have historically
faced higher prices in the individual insurance market.11,13
Additionally, financial barriers may be more prevalent in
younger populations with AMI, given the higher rates of

 uninsurance, underinsurance, and medical debt compared
with older adults who are eligible for Medicare.9,15,16 In
addition, young men and women may encounter other
financial stressors, such as caring for children and aging
parents.17 Taken together, these observations suggest that
young women with AMI may be at particularly high risk of
financial barriers to health care, which may adversely impact
health outcomes and contribute to why young women have
worse health status and psychosocial outcomes post-AMI
than similarly aged men.
In this study, we characterized financial barriers among
young women and men with AMI and their relationship with
health status and psychosocial outcomes post-AMI. Specifi-
cally, we used data from the VIRGO (Variation in Recovery:
Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) Study,
the largest multicenter, prospective study of young adults
with AMI, to investigate sex differences in the prevalence and
associations of financial barriers to health care services and
medications
with
12-month
patient-reported
outcomes,
including health status (symptoms, functioning, and quality
of life), stress, and depressive symptoms. These data can help
to identify patients at elevated risk for adverse outcomes and
inform strategies to improve outcomes.
Methods
Study Sample
The VIRGO study, as described previously,18 is a prospective,
observational study aimed to examine sex differences in
presentation, treatment, and outcomes of young patients with
AMI. Patients aged 18 to 55 years with AMI presenting to 103
hospitals in the United States and 24 hospitals in Spain were
eligible for enrollment.
AMI was confirmed by the presence of elevated cardiac
biomarkers (troponin or creatinine kinase) and supporting
evidence of myocardial ischemia, including at least 1 of the
following: symptoms of ischemia or electrocardiographic
changes suggestive of new ischemia (new ST-T changes,
new or presumably new left bundle branch block, or the
development of pathological Q waves). To be eligible,
participants had to either present directly to the enrolling
institution or be transferred within the first 24 hours of
symptoms. Patients with elevated cardiac markers as a
complication of elective coronary revascularization, who were
unable to provide informed consent or be contacted for
follow-up, were incarcerated, did not speak English or
Spanish, or had an AMI as the result of physical trauma were
excluded from the study.
Of the 5585 patients who were screened, 3572 (women-
to-men ratio of 2:1) with clinically confirmed AMI were
enrolled between August 2008 and May 2012. We excluded
patients with missing data to questions about financial
barriers to health care (n=64). Patients from Australia
(n=72) were also excluded in this analysis, given that they
were lost to follow-up at a much higher rate than patients in
the United States and Spain. Therefore, the final cohort in this
study included 3437 patients. Patients missing data on
financial barriers did not differ significantly from patients
without missing data with respect to age, race, marital status,
living alone, or employment (all P>0.1).
Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected
by medical chart abstraction and standardized in-person
interviews administered by trained personnel during the index
AMI admission. Follow-up telephone interviews were admin-
istered by the Yale Follow-Up Center in the United States and
ANAGRAM-ESIC in Spain at 1 and 12 months to assess
patient-reported
outcomes.
Institutional
research
board
approval was obtained at each participating center, and
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Financial Barriers
We measured perceived financial barriers to medical care by
patient self-report. This approach of using patient-reported
questions allowed us to characterize financial barriers from
the patient’s perspective, rather than inferring how finances
are impacting a patient’s ability to obtain health care based on
indirect measures like insurance status or income. Two
questions, previously used to classify financial barriers to
health care services or financial barriers to medications,9
were assessed during the index hospitalization: “In the past
year, have you avoided obtaining health care services because
of cost?” (yes/no) and “In the past year, how often have you
not taken a medication that your doctor prescribed because
of cost?” (5-point Likert scale ranging from “never” to
“always”). We collapsed responses to the question on cost-
related nonadherence to medications into a dichotomous
variable indicating financial barriers to medications, with
“never” or “rarely” categorized as no and “occasionally,”
“often,” or “always” categorized as yes. Because financial
barriers to services have been shown to relate to AMI
outcomes differently than financial barriers to medications,
patients were classified into 4 mutually exclusive groups
based on their responses to the 2 questions9: (1) no barriers;
(2) barriers to services only; (3) barriers to medications only;
and (4) barriers to services and medications.
Health Outcome Measures
We assessed health status, quality of life, depressive symp-
toms, and perceived stress at baseline and 12 months post-
AMI. Health status was measured using the Short Form-12
(SF-12) physical and mental component scores (PCS and

 MCS). The SF-12 quantifies patients’ mental and physical
functional status and has been shown to be reliable and
valid.19 The PCS and MCS scores range from 0 to 100, in
which higher numbers indicate better health status. A score of
50 reflects the population mean, and 10 points represents 1
SD. Quality of life was evaluated using the Seattle Angina
Questionnaire (SAQ), a validated instrument that measures
patients’ disease-specific health status through a 19-item self-
administered questionnaire.20 The instrument measures 5
dimensions of coronary artery disease and has been used
widely in research among patients with AMI and other
cardiovascular disease.21,22 The quality of life score ranges
from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher quality
of life. A mean difference of greater than 5 points between
groups
is
considered
clinically
significant.20
Depressive
symptomatology was measured using the 9-item Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). This instrument has been
widely employed in cardiac populations.23–25 Scores range
from 0 to 27, with higher scores representing greater
depressive symptomatology.26,27 A score greater than or
equal to 10 suggests moderate depressive symptoms. Finally,
perceived stress was evaluated using the Perceived Stress
Scale (PSS), a 14-item questionnaire that measures the
degree to which a patient’s life situation was perceived as
stressful, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading. Each
item of the PSS uses a 5-point Likert scale, resulting in an
overall score ranging from 0 to 56 with higher scores
indicating greater stress.28
Statistical Analyses
To examine whether financial barriers varied in prevalence
and association with 12-month outcomes between men and
women, we classified men and women, separately, into the 4
financial barrier groups and compared baseline demographic,
health care access and utilization, clinical, and process of care
characteristics between financial barrier groups using chi-
squared tests for categorical variables and Student t tests or
ANOVA for continuous variables. To assess the relationship
between sex and reporting financial barriers to services and
financial barriers to medications, we performed sequential
logistic regression, adjusting for sex, other demographic
characteristics, and cardiovascular risk factors hypothesized
to be associated with financial barriers.
Unadjusted associations between financial barriers and
health outcome measures (SF-12 PCS and MCS, PHQ-9, PSS,
and SAQ–Quality of Life [QoL]) stratified by sex were
evaluated by plotting mean health and psychosocial status
scores at baseline and 12 months by financial barrier groups
and tested statistically by using ANOVA. To assess the
independent relationship between financial barriers and 12-
month health outcomes, we used linear regression models
with least squares means, adjusting for baseline health and
psychosocial status (to account for the relationship between
baseline and 12-month health outcomes) and clinical charac-
teristics. The group without financial barriers to services or
medications was used as the reference category in all
regression analyses. In addition, we tested interactions
between sex and financial barriers to health care to determine
whether the effect of financial barriers differed across sexes.
Covariates for the final models were selected using a
combination of clinical judgment, past literature, and face
validity (defined as P<0.1).1,9,10,29 They included patient
demographics (age, sex, race, marital status, living status,
education, and employment) and clinical characteristics, such
as cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities (diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, smoking, past myocardial infarction
[MI], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart
failure, past stroke, depression [except in the model for
depression
12 months
post-AMI],
low
social
support
[ENRICHD Social Support Inventory], alcohol abuse, and body
mass index [BMI] groups), clinical presentation (ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], Global Registry of
Acute Coronary Events [GRACE] Score, renal dysfunction, and
time to presentation), and inpatient care (reperfusion ther-
apy).
Missing data on covariates were minimal. At baseline, only
5.1% of the sample was missing any covariate data, 0.6% was
missing >1 covariate, and 0.3% was missing >2 covariates. At
12 months, each health outcome measure had missing
information from between 21% and 23% of participants.
Patients missing 12-month outcomes who were excluded
from the analysis were more likely to be of black race, less
educated, unemployed, and uninsured. Patients missing 12-
month outcomes also had more comorbidities on admission,
though clinical presentation and inpatient care did not vary.
Our primary analysis excluded patients who died in the year
post-AMI (n=72; 2%) and those with loss to follow-up (n=657;
19%). We therefore conducted a sensitivity analysis using
multiple imputation for missing health outcome measures.
All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software
(version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

 barriers to medications (22.3% vs 17.2%; P<0.01). These sex
differences in financial barriers to medication persisted even
after adjustment for demographics and cardiovascular risk
factors (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01–1.51; Table 2). In
addition, a greater percentage of women than men reported
not having enough money to make ends meet at the end of
the month, finding it difficult to receive care, and feeling that
their medical costs in the past year were a moderate or a
severe burden (all P<0.01).
Women and men reporting at least 1 financial barrier,
compared to the group with no financial barriers, were
more likely to be single, less educated, unemployed, and
uninsured. They were also more likely to report lower social
support and lacking sufficient finances to make ends meet
(Tables 3 and 4). Women and men with any financial
barrier, compared to the group without barriers, reported
higher out-of-pocket spending, greater difficulty receiving
care, less access to a primary care physician (PCP), and
greater economic burden from medical costs. Delivery of
reperfusion therapy, aspirin on admission, and aspirin at
discharge did not vary by the presence of financial barriers
(all P>0.05).
Compared to patients with financial barriers to only
medications, women and men with barriers to only services
were more likely to report not having any health insurance,
not having a PCP, and experiencing difficulty receiving care.
By contrast, a greater proportion of patients with barriers to
only medications reported not having enough money to make
ends meet at the end of the month compared to patients with
barriers to only services.
Women and men with at least 1 financial barrier had a
greater prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, past MI,
and smoking than patients without financial barriers. At
baseline, women and men with at least 1 financial barrier
reported lower functional status and quality-of-life scores,
more depressive symptomatology, and more stress than
patients with no financial barriers (Figures 1 and 2). Addi-
tionally, at baseline, women in any given financial barrier
group reported poorer functional status and quality of life
along with more depressive symptoms and stress than men in
the peer financial group.
Association of Financial Barriers With 12-Month
Health Outcomes
At 12 months following hospitalization for AMI, adults in the 4
financial barrier groups had higher unadjusted mental func-
tional status, quality of life, and perceived stress scores
compared with baseline (Figures 1 and 2). Additionally, most
groups reported improved physical functional status and
depressive symptomatology. However, 12-month health sta-
tus outcomes differed by financial barrier group. The group
with no financial barriers reported the highest physical and
mental functional status and quality-of-life scores and lowest
depression and stress scores; by contrast, the group with
financial barriers to both medications and services reported
the lowest physical functional status and quality-of-life scores
and highest depression and stress scores.

 These associations remained similar after adjustment for
baseline health and psychosocial status as well as demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics. After adjustment, in
comparison to patients without financial barriers, women
and men with financial barriers to both services and
medications reported lower mental functional status (SF-12
MCS: women, b �3.28, SE 0.73, P<0.001; men, b �3.35, SE

financial barriers to both services and medications also
reported lower physical status at 12 months (SF-12 PCS: b

barriers. No interactions between sex and financial barriers
were observed in any of the fully adjusted models (all P>0.1;

nearly identical results for all health outcomes.

Financial Barriers and AMI Recovery

 Discussion
In this study of young women and men with AMI, financial
barriers to health care were more common among women,
though the negative association with health outcomes was
similar by sex. Women and men with financial barriers to
health care services and medications reported worse health
and psychosocial status during the index hospitalization and
12 months later, manifested as poorer mental functional sta-
tus, lower quality of life, greater depressive symptomatology,
and higher perceived stress. These differences across finan-
cial barrier groups persisted after adjustment for potential
confounding factors, including clinical comorbidities and
baseline health status.
With over 3400 young patients and comprehensive data on
socioeconomic status (SES), the VIRGO study provided an
opportunity to fill a gap in understanding whether financial
barriers contribute to sex-based disparities in AMI outcomes
among young men and women. We extend past literature

 showing a relationship between economic status and health
outcomes among older populations with AMI by showing that
financial barriers are common in the young adult population
with AMI, with young women having a modestly greater
prevalence of financial barriers than men.9,10 These sex
differences in prevalence may reflect the greater poverty,
lower wages, or greater vulnerability to underinsurance that
women in the general population face.11,13 Moreover, the
overall prevalence of financial barriers among young patients
with AMI in VIRGO was higher than in other populations.
Nearly 1 in 3 patients reported financial barriers to health care
services and approximately 1 in 5 patients reported financial
barriers to medications. Although these proportions are
comparable to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of the
general population aged 18 to 65 years,11 they are higher
than the rates of financial barriers to services (1 in 5) and
medications (1 in 8) observed among older AMI patients in the
Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocardial Infarction: Event
and Recovery (PREMIER) study.9 Moreover, women were also
more likely to report not having enough money to make ends
meet at the end of the month, finding it difficult to receive
care, and feeling that their medical costs in the past year were
a moderate or a severe burden. Collectively, these findings
convey that many young women experience substantial
financial barriers impacting their ability to afford medications
and receive the services they need.
However, contrary to our hypothesis that the effect of
financial barriers on health outcomes would be stronger
among women than among men with AMI, we did not find
such a difference. Although the medical literature is limited,
there is some evidence to suggest that sex may modify the
effect of SES on health outcomes. For example, a recent study
showed that the gap in life expectancy between people of low
and high income varied by sex.30 Additionally, past work in
other populations has found sex differences in the relation-
ship between SES and health measures, including cardiovas-
cular risk factors (obesity,31 hypertension,32 and diabetes
mellitus33–36) and outcomes.37–40 A broader social science
literature has also tried to disentangle the interplay between
SES, sex, and health.41,42 The findings of our study indicate

 that financial barriers to health care universally hamper
recovery post-AMI, regardless of sex. This observation may
indicate that financial barriers act as an “equalizer,” such that
the continued need to access costly services and guideline-
based medications recommended for optimal recovery post-
AMI is jeopardized for men and women with financial barriers
equally.43,44 Taken together, these findings suggest that
financial barriers are a risk factor for poor health outcomes
post-AMI for both young women and men.
There are several explanations as to why patients with
financial barriers may have poorer 12-month health outcomes
than patients without barriers. In our study, we found that the
gap in health status, quality of life, stress, and depression
between patients with and without financial barriers was
present at the time of AMI and then persisted at 12 months,
suggesting that patients with financial barriers are at a
disadvantage at all points during recovery. However, this
relationship between financial barriers and adverse 12-month
outcomes remained even after adjustment for baseline health
and psychosocial status. Additionally, patients with financial
barriers may utilize health care resources at lower rates than
patients without financial barriers post-AMI. Indeed, we found
that women and men in this study with financial barriers to
both medications and services were more likely than patients
with no financial barriers 1 month post-AMI to report not
adhering to medications (12.4% vs 6.0%), greater difficulty
scheduling follow-up visits (12.0% vs 3.0%), and higher rates
of not participating in cardiac rehabilitation after referral
attributed to cost (48.0% vs 15.6%). Moreover, the economic
burden of medical costs may have downstream effects on
psychosocial health and quality of life for patients with
financial barriers. In VIRGO, patients with financial barriers
were more likely to report that their medical costs were a
severe economic burden (41.8% vs 10.8%) and had greater
out-of-pocket spending on health care than patients with no
financial barriers at 1 month post-AMI.
There are numerous implications of our findings. Although
we are unable to draw inferences about cause and effect in an
observational study, our results suggest that self-reported
financial barriers may identify young patients at risk for poor

to young adults, including individual-level factors (eg, employ-
ment status, household income, insurance status, insurance
premiums and co-pays, caregiver responsibilities, and house-

resources, access to primary care), would be beneficial.
Additionally, the strong relationship between financial barriers

 and health outcomes emphasizes the need to address the
downstream effects of these barriers on adoption of guide-
lines-based care and self-management, given that patients
with financial barriers may be discharged with evidence-based
secondary prevention treatments that they cannot afford.
Although a comprehensive review of effective interventions is
beyond the scope of this article, initiatives that reduce
uninsurance and underinsurance, such as expansion of state
Medicaid programs and low-premium health plans may be
helpful in addressing some of the financial barriers to health
care.45
This study has several limitations. First, with a small
number of patients in certain financial barrier groups, there
may be some imprecision in the derived estimates. However,
this should have biased our results to the null. Second, 12-
month outcomes were missing in approximately one quarter
of responders. Given that patients missing 12-month out-
comes data were more likely to be less educated, unem-
ployed, and uninsured and had a greater disease burden, the
association of financial barriers with post-AMI outcomes may
be
underestimated
in
the
present
study.
Nonetheless,
analyses repeated using multiple imputations for missing
health outcomes data showed nearly identical results. Third,
we did not study the association between financial barriers
and mortality, recurrent MI, or revascularization, given that
these events were uncommon in this study cohort. In this
observational study of sex differences in AMI outcomes,
extensive in-hospital interviews were conducted to obtain
patients’ baseline health status. Although randomization did
not exclude critically ill patients (and efforts were made to
enroll them in the study), the nature of the study may have
selected for a healthier population. Future research should
seek to understand the relationship between financial barriers
and these clinical outcomes among young adults with AMI.
Fourth, the findings in our study may not be generalizable to
patients with AMI seen at hospitals that did not participate in
VIRGO. Nonetheless, the VIRGO study is the largest multi-
center prospective study of young adults with AMI (including
103 sites in the United States and 24 in Spain) and has one of
the largest cohorts of young adults aged ≤55 years hospital-
ized with AMI. The composition of the VIRGO study cohort is
consistent with other studies of younger patients with AMI.46
Finally, we relied on self-reported measures of financial
barriers and health outcomes, which may be susceptible to
potential biases of reporting. However, to the extent possible,
we adopted validated self-reported surveys that have been
widely used among AMI populations. There has been no
evidence of directional misclassification, whereby patients
systematically under- or over-report a finding.19–28
This study observed that financial barriers to health care
are common among young women and men with AMI and
strongly associated with poor health outcomes 12 months
after the event. These findings indicate that researchers,
health care providers, and policy makers should continue to
devote attention to patients who experience financial barriers
to health care, which may capture the patient’s experience
more comprehensively than indirect measures like insurance
status and income. Financial barriers are common, especially
among young women, which may create stress and lead them
to forego services or medications attributed to cost, thereby
impacting outcomes. Future research aimed to improve post-
AMI health outcomes, such as health status, depression,
stress, and quality of life, should consider how best to address
financial barriers to health care and ameliorate their effect.
