Background: Violence is a major concern and is prevalent across several mental 
disorders. The use of substances has been associated with an exacerbation of psy-
chiatric symptoms as well as with violence. Compared to other substances such as 
alcohol and cocaine, existing literature on the cannabis–violence relationship has been 
more limited, with most studies being conducted in the general population, and has 
shown controversial results. Evidence has suggested a stronger relationship when 
examining the effects of the persistency of cannabis use on future violent behaviors. 
Though, while cannabis use is highly prevalent amid psychiatric patients, far less 
literature on the subject has been conducted in this population. Hence, the present 
prospective study aims to investigate the persistency of cannabis use in psychiatric 
patients.
Method: The sample comprised of 1,136 recently discharged psychiatric patients
provided by the MacArthur Risk Assessment Study. A multi-wave (five-assessment) 
follow-up design was employed to allow temporal sequencing between substance use 
and violent behaviors. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine 
the effect of persistency of cannabis use on violence, while controlling for potential 
confounding factors. Potential bidirectional association was also investigated using the 
same statistical approach.
results: Our results suggest a unidirectional association between cannabis use and 
violence. GEE model revealed that the continuity of cannabis use across more than one 
time wave was associated with increased risks of future violent behavior. Patients who 
reported having used cannabis at each follow-up periods were 2.44 times more likely to 
display violent behaviors (OR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.06–5.63, p < 0.05).
conclusion: These findings are particularly relevant as they suggest that the lon-
ger individuals report having used cannabis after a psychiatric discharge, the more 
likely they are of being violent in the following time waves. These results add to our 
understanding of the negative consequences of chronic cannabis use amid psychiatric 
patients.

Persistent Cannabis Use and Violence

Violence causes a serious public health burden (1). Literature 
has suggested that violence and criminality are greater in indi-
viduals with severe mental illnesses (SMI) when compared to 
the general population (2). Even higher rates of violence have 
been firmly established for those with substance use disorders 
(SUDs) (3). Moreover, substance use has been independently 
correlated with violence both in the general population and 
in the mentally ill (2, 4, 5). It is a great concern being asso-
ciated with many adverse outcomes. It has been responsible 
for a great amount of the increased risk attributed to mental 
disorders (6–8) and has been linked to exacerbated psychiatric 
symptoms (e.g., psychotic symptoms) (9). While studies vary 
greatly, the general association between substance use, crime, 
and violence has long been established (3, 10, 11). Compared 
to other substances, the alcohol–violence relationship has been 
studied to a much greater extent both cross-sectionally and 
longitudinally (12–15). There is also quite strong evidence for 
the link between stimulants (i.e., cocaine and methampheta-
mine) and violence (3, 16).
However, while cannabis is a main substance of use in reports 
on arrests, violence, emergency room, and therapeutic admis-
sions as well as involuntary injuries (17), the existing literature 
on its association with violence is more limited, notably amid 
psychiatric patients with most studies provided from the general 
population. Unlike studies of other drugs, the cannabis–violence 
relationship has provided controversial results (18). Cannabis 
use has often been found to have a positive link with aggressive 
behaviors both in cross-sectional and in longitudinal studies 
(18–24). For instance, results from the longitudinal Dunedin 
Study, which examined the relative risk for violence among 
different psychiatric disorders, indicated that after controlling 
for confounding variables such as other psychiatric disorders 
or other substance misuses (including alcohol dependence), 
marijuana-dependent individuals were 3.8 times more likely to 
report violence than controls (25). Cannabis use has been shown 
to be positively associated with violence among other studies 
on the mentally ill as well (26–28). While studies have shown 
a positive cannabis–violence association, a few have suggested 
more mixed results whereas its use was not related to violence 
or even suppressed it (18, 29). For instance, amid the psychiatric 
population, a lack of association was reported in a population of 
schizophrenia patients after the inclusion of other potential risk 
factors (30).
Several studies in the general population have also reported 
on the directionality of the cannabis–violence association as 
to whether involvement in violence may cause cannabis use or 
vice versa or whether they are intertwined in a more complex 
manner (31). Preliminary evidence nonetheless has suggested 
a dose–response relationship between cannabis smoking and 
violence/delinquency (32–36). Though, few longitudinal studies 
have been conducted, which are more suitable to examine causal 
relationships than cross-sectional studies (37). Moreover, some 
have more so examined a possible reciprocal relation between 
cannabis smoking and violence, further limiting the causal infer-
ences that may be reached (35, 38–41). However, these analyses 
provided rather weak evidence. Interestingly, recent evidence 
has suggested a stronger relationship when examining the 
effects of the persistency of cannabis use on subsequent violent 
behaviors (32, 35, 41). Yet, only a limited amount of research has 
paid attention to this potentially important factor, none to our 
knowledge amid the psychiatric population.
Overall, no clear consensus has been established on the 
association and directionality of the cannabis–violence relation-
ship. The main reason for these discrepant results may lie in 
the incongruent methodologies across studies (37) since they 
differ significantly with respect to measurement, developmental 
periods studied and the length of time between waves (42). 
Moreover, existing studies conducted have mostly been cross-
sectional and may have been compromised by the likely presence 
of time-invariant (e.g., personality traits) and time-dynamic 
confounders (e.g., substance use) (43). In fact, the inclusion of 
covariates (confounders) known to influence both cannabis use 
and violence in statistical analyses, such as alcohol use or antiso-
cial personality traits, has not always been reported (34). Studies 
that have not controlled for the effect of such variables may have 
overestimated the amplitude of the relationship between cannabis 
and violence. Indeed, a significant weakening of the association 
has been observed in studies that included these confounding 
variables. Furthermore, studies differ as to the population under 
study. Surprisingly far less attention has been directed toward 
investigating the relationship and directionality of the associa-
tion as well as the association with persistent cannabis use amid 
psychiatric patients. Yet, cannabis use is known to occur more 
commonly in individuals with SMI (44).
Due to these gaps and the limited literature amid psychi-
atric population, this study aims to investigate the cannabis– 
violence relationship in a large sample of recently discharged 
psychiatric patients, with a focus on the persistency of cannabis 
use. To address several methodological limitations of prior 
literature, analyses of the data provided by the MacArthur 
Risk Assessment Study within a prospective design has been 
privileged. We hypothesized that a unidirectional association 
between cannabis and violence will be found and that per-
sistency of cannabis use in individuals with mental health 
problems across time-points will be a significant predictor of 
subsequent physical assaults after controlling for important 
covariates of both cannabis use and violence revealed in the 
literature.

ethics committee from each site’s institutional review boards. 
A description of the MVRAS protocol has been detailed else-
where (6, 45). Following hospitalization discharge, participants 
were interviewed every 10 weeks for a total of 5 different time 
waves. Of the 1,136 participants assessed at baseline, 846 were 
re-interviewed at time 1 (74.5%), 830 at time 2 (73.1%), 772 at 
time 3 (68.0%), 755 at time 4 (66.5%), and 754 at time 5 (66.4%).
study Design
To ensure temporal proximity, we examined the relationship 
between cannabis use [independent variable (IV)] and the 
presence of violent behaviors [dependent variable (DV)] in the 
following 10 weeks at each assessment. We used a prospective 
approach to test whether persistency of cannabis use across time-
points would predict subsequent violent behaviors. First, canna-
bis use during the last follow-up period was coded dichotomously 
for each time-point (IV = non-user vs. user, 0-1) [e.g., (T1: 0-1), 
 
(T2: 0-1), (T3: 0-1), (T4: 0-1)]. Second, persistency of cannabis 
use was computed as a cumulative (ordinal) variable of cannabis 
use (dichotomous) across the following time waves [i.e., IV1 = T1 
(0-1)], IV2 = T1 + T2 (0-1-2), IV3 = T1 + T2 + T3 (0-1-2-3), 
 
and IV4 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 (0-1-2-3-4). The same was per-
formed for both cocaine and alcohol use.
For this study, violent behaviors were coded into a dichoto-
mous variable (0/1) for each time-point to document the pres-
ence or absence of a violent behavior since the last follow-up. 
Table 1 describes the procedure used for our study’s design. 
Other potential confounding factors, such as psychopathic traits 
and impulsivity, were also considered in the statistical analyses.
assessments
Primary Diagnoses
Primary diagnoses were established after admission according 
to the DSM-III-R Checklist (46). Primary diagnoses included 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders, affective disorders, SUDs, 
and personality disorders.
Substance Use
At each time-point interview, participants were asked about 
their use of alcohol and other drugs since the previous follow-up 
period (in the prior 10 weeks). Since alcohol use and cocaine 
use are both known to be associated with cannabis use (47) and 
violence (3), we included these covariates in statistical analyses.
Psychopathic Traits
The Psychopathy Checklist Screening Version (PCL: SV) (48) 
contains 12 items assessing psychopathic traits. Each item is rated 
on a 3-point scale, with 0 being non-applicable, 1 being possibly 
or partially present, and 2 being present. The tool showed good 
psychometric properties among psychiatric patients (48, 49). 
As suggested by Hart et al. (48), we used a 3-point ordinal variable 
based on cut-off scores (total) in our analyses with psychopathic 
traits graded as the following: low psychopathic traits = total 
score ≤12; moderate psychopathic traits = total score <13–17; 
high psychopathic traits = total score ≥18.
Impulsivity
The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale [BIS-11; (50)] is a 30-item 
questionnaire developed to assess attentional impulsiveness 
(e.g., “I have racing thoughts”), motor impulsiveness (e.g., “I do 
things without thinking”), and cognitive/non-planning impul-
siveness (e.g., “I say things without thinking”) in clinical and 
non-clinical populations. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale 
(1 = Rarely/Never, 2 = Occasionally, 3 = Often, 4 = Almost 
always/Always).
Outcome
At each time-point interview, the participants were asked 
ques 
tions about violent behaviors they committed in the past 
10 weeks. Violence was assessed with the MacArthur Com-
munity Violence Instrument [MCVI; (45)], based on Lidz et al. 
(51), documenting aggressive behaviors, such as assaults, acts of 
battery, threats made with a weapon, used of a weapon against 
others, as well as rape.
statistical Methods
First, we examined the effect of persistency of cannabis use on 
violence using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a 
binomial distribution and a log link. Since substance consump-
tion is time-dynamic; we, therefore, adjusted GEE on substance 
use with time. Multivariate analyses were then performed using 
the same approach adjusting for potential covariates such as 
time, age, sex, age at first psychiatric admission, other substance 
misuse, psychopathic traits, impulsivity, and primary diagnosis. 
The GEE is known to be flexible in handling correlated data 
structures (52), several outcome data types (e.g., binary, con-
tinuous), time-varying and time-invariant factors and missing 
data (53). The present sample size was large enough to estimate 
parameters with accuracy and, thus, to keep the stability of the 
working correlation matrix (54). Since cannabis use and violence 
were both coded dichotomously, we tested bidirectionality by 
using the same GEE model (with the same covariates) with a 
binomial distribution and a log link. Reverse directionality was 
tested by reversing variables (IV and DV) in multivariate models 
(i.e., cumulative violent behaviors on subsequent cannabis use) 
(35). Variables included in the models showed low levels of multi-
collinearity [variance inflation factor (VIF) <2.0]. All statistical 
analyses were performed using SPSS for MAC version 23.

men (58.7%), single, separated, or divorced (86.7%), Caucasians 
(69.3%) and mainly diagnosed with a pri 
mary affective disorder 
(52.6%). Schizophrenia spectrum disorders was diagnosed in 
245 individuals (21.6%) of the sample, while 272 (23.9%) were 
primarily diagnosed with a SUD and 21 (1.8%) with a personality 
disorder. Moreover, the mean age at first psychiatric admission 
was 21.81 years (SD = 7.06) and most participants had a history of 
 
4 or less psychiatric hospitalizations (66.0%). Participants reported 
having ever consumed alcohol (96.5%), cannabis (83.2%), 
 
or cocaine (59.2%) in their life.
The highest proportion of the total sample, that is 588 (61.9%) 
participants, was found to have never used cannabis at any of 
the time-periods. On the other hand, 157 (16.5%) participants 
consumed cannabis at 1 time-point, 77 (8.1%) at 2 time-points, 
77 (8.1%) at 3 time-points, and 51 (5.4%) at 4 time-points. Violent 
behaviors were reported in 265 patients (23.3%) at time 1, 251 
(22.1%) at time 2, 167 (14.7%) at time 3, 160 (14.1%) at time 4, 
and 136 (12%) at time 5.
Persistency of cannabis use and risk  
of subsequent Violence
As shown in Table 2, unadjusted GEE results revealed that the 
persistent use of cannabis significantly predicted violence occur-
ring in the following time-point when comparing to no use of 
cannabis (one time-point: OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.19–2.15, p < 0.01; 
two time-points: OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.27–2.86, p < 0.01; three 
time-points: OR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.66–4.46, p < 0.001; four time-
points: OR = 4.04, 95% CI: 1.99–8.19, p < 0.001).
Continuous use of alcohol across time-points statistically 
predicted future violent behaviors (one time-point: OR = 1.42, 
95% CI: 1.07–1.89, p < 0.05; two time-points: OR = 1.44, 95% 
CI: 1.02–2.04, p < 0.01; three time-points: OR = 1.99, 95% 
CI: 1.30–3.04, p < 0.01; four time-points: OR = 3.39, 95% CI: 
1.99–5.78, p < 0.001). However, only cocaine consumption at 
one and three follow-up periods were significant predictors of 
violence (one time-point: OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12–2.17, p < 0.01; 
three time-points: OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.49–4.80, p < 0.01). 
For univariate analyses on potential covariates, see Table S1 in 
Supplementary Material.
The results from the GEE model suggest that the relationship 
between continued use of cannabis and subsequent violence 
remains relatively stable after adjustments for time-varying vari-
ables such as other substances use as well as fixed demographic 
and clinical covariates. In fact, as shown in Table 3, cannabis use 
over time was a significant predictor of violence when consumed 
at two time-points (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.08–2.70, p < 0.05), three 
time-points (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.16–3.74, p < 0.05), and four 
time-points (OR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.06–5.63, p < 0.05).
Moreover, only the continuous use of alcohol over the four 
follow-up periods significantly increased the odds of future 
violent behaviors (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.25–4.28, p < 0.001). 
 
No statistically significant result was observed in the multivariate 
analysis regarding the cocaine–violence relationship. Figure 1 
shows that the odds of having reported a violent behavior aug-
mented significantly as the number of follow-up periods with 
a reported cannabis consumption increased as well. Moreover, 
for analyses including potential covariates see Table S2 in Sup-
plementary Material.
Finally, testing for reverse directionality of the relationship 
between cannabis use and violence showed that violence across 
time-points was not a statistically significant predictor of can-
nabis use when controlling for the same covariates included in the 
preceding model (one time-point: OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.64–1.24, 
p = 0.507; two time-points: OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.71–1.59, 
p = 0.771; three time-points: OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.44–1.49, 
p = 0.500; and four time-points: OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.10–1.41, 
p < 0.147).

Persistent Cannabis Use and Violence
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org

DiscUssiOn
The primary purpose of this study was to examine the rela-
tionship between continued use of cannabis and violence in 
patients recently discharged from acute psychiatric facilities. 
Significant findings regarding the adverse effects of cannabis 
use on violence amid this population were found, notably that 
the continuity of cannabis usage is a moderate predictor of 
subsequent violent behavior.
First, we found that the persistency of cannabis use during 
follow-up periods was associated with an increased risk of sub-
sequent violence. Although we observed that violent behaviors 
tended to decrease across follow-up periods, the association 
nevertheless remained statistically significant. As suggested by 
the authors of the MVRAS (55), this decrement of violence may 
likely be explained by patients becoming more involved in treat-
ment over time or by an increase of social support. Interestingly, 
in comparison to the other substances considered in our study 
(alcohol and cocaine), the persistent use cannabis over time 
showed a more constant relationship for violence than alcohol 
and cocaine use. As for the latter substance, while prior literature 
has shown a cocaine–violence association (3), our results did not 
confirm such an association possibly due to the lack of cocaine 
consumers at the different time waves. As depicted in Figure 1, 
individuals having consumed cannabis at more than 1 time-point 
were significantly at higher risk of future violent behaviors. In fact, 
as the number of follow-up periods with a reported substance use 
increased, the odds of subsequent violence had risen importantly. 
This was found while controlling for the effect of time, potential 
time-invariant confounders such as impulsivity and psychopathic 
traits as well as time-varying covariates, including alcohol and 
cocaine use. These findings are in line with results from an impor-
tant longitudinal study amid the general population controlling 
for the same characteristics as in our study, including antisocial/
psychopathic traits, alcohol, and other drug use as well as mental 
illness (35). Overall, our results imply that patients who reported 
having used cannabis at each follow-up periods (all four time-
points) were 2.44 times more likely to display violent behaviors. 
This is important as this suggests a moderate relationship between 
cannabis use and violence.
Second, while there remains ambiguity in the directionality of 
the association between cannabis use and violence as to whether 
the use of this drug impacts violence or vice versa, our results 
pointed toward a unidirectional relationship between its con-
tinued use and violence. Hence, contrarily to studies reporting 
a reciprocal relationship (35, 38–41), we rather found that it was 
cannabis use that predicted future violent behavior. The reverse 
relationship was not statistically significant. Therefore, while the 
association between cannabis and violence found in this study 
was moderate, persistency of cannabis use across time should 
be regarded as an indicator of future violent behaviors following 
psychiatric discharge. This relationship may imply a possible 
causative role for cannabis use on violence. In fact, past research 
on the neurobiological effects of chronic cannabis use may aid us 
to understand the relationship found in our study. For instance, a 
recent meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on chronic cannabis 
users showed structural and functional deficits in the prefrontal 
cortex mainly associated with inhibitory processing (56). These 
neural deficits, limiting the ability to suppress a strong tendency 
to act, are also reported as important components of impulsive 
aggression (57–59) as well as of antisocial personality disorder 
and psychopathic traits (60). Although the sequence of these

events remains inconclusive, it is plausible that an earlier age 
of chronic onset of cannabis use (more specifically before brain 
maturation: prior to 16 years old) could deteriorate neural struc-
tures associated with inhibition and, thus, lead to an increased 
risk of developing adult antisocial behaviors (56, 61–64). This is of 
particular importance in order to promote awareness about youth 
substance use and should be targeted by future studies.
limitations
While a large longitudinal study design was employed to assess the 
association between cannabis use and violence amid psychiatric 
patients, a few limitations are worth to bear in mind. First, the 
sample size decreased in statistical analyses due to individuals lost 
across follow-ups and missing data. However, this does not take 
away the importance of our findings, considering the large sample 
size remaining. Second, since our hypotheses were not based on 
the effect of cannabis use on the number of violent acts, we focused 
solely on the presence of a violent behavior during follow-up peri-
ods. Using the MCVI, we employed a single dichotomous variable 
to assess the presence or absence of a violent behavior across 
follow-up periods. Thus, we assessed a relatively large definition of 
the construct. While this surpassed the general scope of our study, 
it would certainly have been interesting to evaluate the associa-
tion between cannabis use and specific types of violent behaviors. 
Some studies have indeed found that cannabis use was associated 
with certain types of violence (e.g., physical aggression, intimate 
partner violence) (18, 65). Third, while our initial objective was 
to observe the effect of cannabis use on the presence of a physical 
assault at follow-up, our data utilized did not allow us to examine 
a dose–response relationship, as preliminary evidence has shown 
amid the general population (32–36). Finally, the data used in 
our study was self-reported (i.e., violence and substance use). 
Therefore, future studies should replicate our findings by using 
alternative methods such as urine toxicology analyses (substance 
use) as well as hospital/criminal records (violent behaviors). Also, 
although we included several covariates in our analyses, we did 
 
not control for the potential influence of mental state factors as 
mediators of the cannabis–violence association. Likewise, future 
studies will need to test the possible effects of psychiatric diag-
noses on the relationship between cannabis use and violence. In 
addition, further research must be conducted on the relationship 
between cannabis-related characteristics and violence, such as the 
frequency, the number of cannabis joints smoked, and the canna-
bis potency ratio [Cannabidiol (CBD)/Delta-9-Tetrahydrocanna-
binol (THC)], to better understand the association found in this 
study. Though cannabis potency and synthetic cannabinoid con-
sumption have been considerably increasing since 2000 (66–68), 
we still nonetheless found that persistency of cannabis use is a 
relevant risk factor for violence following psychiatric discharge.
cOnclUsiOn
To conclude, our findings are relevant as they aid to shed light on 
the cannabis–violence association that has been less extensively 
studied amid psychiatric patients, in whom cannabis use is twice 
as prevalent in contrast to the general population (44). Compared 
to prior studies, we employed a prospective design to precisely 
examine the association between the continuation of cannabis 
use and violence. Our results are particularly relevant and may 
have clinical and violence risk management implications as we 
exposed that the persistency of cannabis use across different time 
waves was associated with an increased risk of violence in a large 
sample of patients recently discharged from acute psychiatric 
facilities. The results from this study show the necessity of further 
literature on the topic to specify the dose–response relationship 
with violence. This will have an important impact on preventive 
strategies to limit the risks of violence associated with cannabis 
that leads to many major social and health consequences (69).
