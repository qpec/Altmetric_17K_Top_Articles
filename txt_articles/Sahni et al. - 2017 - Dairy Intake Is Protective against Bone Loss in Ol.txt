Abstract
Background: Previous studies showed beneficial effects of specific dairy foods on bone health in middle-aged adults.
Objective: We examined the association of milk, yogurt, cheese, cream, fluid dairy (milk + yogurt), and milk + yogurt + cheese
intakes with bone mineral density (BMD) and 4-y percentage of change in BMD [n%BMD; femoral neck, trochanter, and lumbar
spine (LS)]. We further assessed whether these associations were modified by vitamin D supplement use in this cohort of older
adults.
Methods: Food-frequency questionnaire responses, baseline BMD (hip and spine, n = 862 in 1988–1989), and follow-up
BMD (n = 628 in 1992–1993) were measured in the Framingham study, a prospective cohort study of older Caucasian men
and women aged 67–93 y. Outcomes included baseline BMD and n%BMD. Dairy-food intakes (servings per week) were
converted to energy-adjusted residuals, and linear regression was used, adjusting for covariates. These associations were
further examined by vitamin D supplement use.
Results: The mean age of the participants was 75 y. In the full sample, dairy-food items were not associated with BMD (P = 0.11–
0.99) or with n%BMD (P = 0.29–0.96). Among vitamin D supplement users, but not among nonusers, higher milk, fluid dairy, and
milk + yogurt + cheese intakes were associated with higher LS BMD (P = 0.011–0.009). Among vitamin D supplement users, but
not among nonusers, higher milk + yogurt + cheese intakes were protective against trochanter BMD loss (P = 0.009).
Conclusions: In this population of older adults, higher intakes of milk, fluid dairy, and milk + yogurt + cheese were
associated with higher LS BMD, and a higher intake of milk + yogurt + cheese was protective against trochanter BMD loss
among vitamin D supplement users but not among nonusers. These findings underscore that the benefits of dairy intake
on the skeleton may be dependent on vitamin D intake.

Introduction
It is estimated that 10 million Americans >50 y old have
osteoporosis (1), a disease characterized by low bone mass and
progressive deterioration of bone tissue (2). The consequences of
osteoporosis include increased risk of fracture, loss of physical
function, increased mortality and morbidity, and decreased quality
of life (3). Osteoporosis prevention includes regular physical
exercise and adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D (1). Dairy
foods are good sources of calcium and vitamin D and provide more
protein, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus than any
other food (4, 5). Yet, >80% of the US population does not meet the
recommended dairy intake (6) of 3 servings/d (7).
Our previous research and that of others have suggested a
positive link between milk intake and bone mineral density
(BMD)8 (8–12). Although previous studies of BMD have

 focused primarily on young, premenopausal women (13–16),
most evaluated milk intake and did not consider other dairy
foods with different nutritional profiles or total vitamin D
intake. Under normal dietary conditions, ;30–40% of the
calcium contained in milk and cheese is absorbed in the gut
through vitamin D–dependent transport across the duodenum,
facilitated diffusion, or under the influence of lactose in the distal
small intestine via the paracellular route (4). Vitamin D
stimulates calcium absorption, which is beneficial for building
bones and preventing bone loss over time, and a recent study
showed that there was no threshold of calcium absorption with
increased vitamin D intakes (17). However, recent data evalu-
ating the effect of vitamin D on BMD have been inconsistent. A
meta-analysis (18) and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (19)
concluded that there was no evidence of an overall benefit of
vitamin D supplementation on BMD, yet there was a small but
relevant effect on calcium absorption. It thus remains unclear
whether the effect of vitamin D on calcium absorption is
substantial enough to translate into beneficial effects on BMD,
especially in older, calcium-replete women who are represented
in the recent clinical trial (19). Additionally, recommended
intakes of vitamin D are difficult to achieve without fortified
foods or supplements (20). Further, RCTs to date have focused
almost exclusively on calcium and vitamin D supplement use
and not on dairy intake, which is a concentrated source of both
calcium and vitamin D (in vitamin D–fortified dairy foods).
This prospective cohort study examined the association of
dairy-food intake [servings per week of milk, yogurt, cheese,
cream, fluid dairy (milk + yogurt) and milk + yogurt + cheese]
with BMD and bone loss and if these associations were modified
by additional vitamin D intake via supplements in older adults
from the Framingham Original Cohort. Our hypothesis was that
higher intake of all dairy foods except cream would be
associated with higher BMD and lower BMD loss in this older
population of men and women but that vitamin D supplement
users would realize greater benefits than nonusers.
Methods
Study population. The sample included participants in the Framing-
ham Osteoporosis Study, an ancillary study of the Framingham Heart
Study. This population-based cohort study began in 1948 to examine
risk factors for heart disease. The original participants (5209 men and
women, aged 28–74 y) were selected as a population-based random
sample of households in Framingham, Massachusetts (21). Of 5209
men and women who formed the original cohort, 1164 cohort
members participated in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study, when
BMD measurements were taken in 1988–1989. Of these participants,
we excluded men and women with incomplete FFQ information
(based on the criteria of >12 food items left blank in the FFQ), energy
intakes <2.51 or >16.74 MJ (<600 or >4000 kcal/d), or missing
covariate information [BMI (in kg/m2), n = 1; milk and yogurt intake,
n = 1]. The final analytic sample for the cross-sectional study of dairy
intake and BMD included 862 men and women with a valid FFQ in
1988–1989 and $1 baseline bone site measured in 1988–1989. The
final sample for the longitudinal cohort study of dairy intake and
bone loss included 628 men and women with a valid FFQ in 1988–
1989 and $1 longitudinal bone site measured at the 4-y follow-up
examination in 1992–1993.
Outcome ascertainment. BMD was measured in the original cohort in
1988–1989 and in 1992–1993 at the femur, spine, and radius, as
previously described (22). BMD of the proximal right femur [femoral
neck (FN) and trochanter] and lumbar spine (LS; average L2–L4) were
measured in gram per square centimeter by using a Lunar DP3 dual-
photon absorptiometer at baseline. At the 4-y follow-up examination,
BMD was measured by using DXA (DPX-L; Lunar Radiation Corpo-
ration). There were strong correlations between measures taken with
dual photon absorptiometry and DXA; however, because of a small but
consistent shift in BMD values between the 2 methods, FN BMDs were
adjusted for a change from DP3 to DPX-L technology by using published
corrections (23). BMD at the radial shaft was measured in gram per
square centimeter with a Lunar SP2 single-photon absorptiometer
(Lunar Radiation Corporation) at both examinations.
Dietary assessment. Usual dietary intake was assessed with the
semiquantitative, 126-item Willett FFQ at the baseline examination
for this study in 1988–1989 (24). This FFQ has been validated against
four 7-d dietary records in the Nurses� Health Study (25) and against
multiple diet records and blood measurements for many nutrients,
including protein, in several populations (26, 27). The corrected
correlation coefficients ranged from 0.57 to 0.94 for dairy products.
Questionnaires were mailed to the study participants before their
scheduled clinic visit. They were asked to complete the questionnaires
based on their intake over the previous year and bring them to the
clinic examination, where the questionnaires were reviewed with
participants by clinic staff. Intake of dairy exposure variables was
assessed in servings per week by using the food-list section of the
FFQ. Willett�s questionnaire specifies the serving size for each dairy
food as follows: milk, skim or low-fat or whole (8-ounce glass or
237 mL); ice milk (1/2 cup or 118 mL); cottage or ricotta cheese (1/2
cup or 118 g); other cheese (1 slice, 1-ounce serving, or 30 g); cream
(1 tablespoon or 15 g); sour cream (1 tablespoon or 15 g); ice cream
(1/2 cup or 118 g); cream cheese (1 ounce or 30 g); and yogurt (1 cup or
237 g). Milk intake was calculated as the sum of intake of skim milk,
low fat milk, whole milk, and ice milk. Cheese intake was calculated
as the sum of intake of cottage and ricotta cheese and other cheeses.
Cream intake was calculated as the sum intake of cream, sour cream,
ice cream, and cream cheese. Yogurt intake was also estimated in
servings per week (fat free, reduced fat, and full fat combined). A
variable for fluid dairy intake was created, which included milk and
yogurt in servings per week. A variable for total dairy intake was
created, which included intake of milk, yogurt, and cheese in servings
per week. Intakes of dietary calcium (expressed as mg/d), dietary
vitamin D (expressed as IU/d), calcium supplement use (expressed as
mg/d), vitamin D supplement use (yes or no), calcium (expressed as
mg/d), protein (expressed as g/d) intake from nondairy-food sources,
and total energy (expressed as kcal/d) were assessed by using the
food-list section of the FFQ.
Potential confounding factors. Sex, age (years), height (meters),
weight (kilograms), smoking (current or noncurrent), physical activity,
total energy (expressed as MJ/d), alcohol (expressed as g/d), caffeine
(expressed as g/d), calcium supplement use (expressed as mg/d), vitamin
D supplement use (yes or no), and current estrogen use (yes or no) in
women only were measured at the baseline examination for this study in
1988–1989. The dietary intakes and supplement use were assessed by
using the FFQ. Furthermore, intake of total energy and total intake of
dairy-specific nutrients (from dairy and other sources), such as dietary
calcium, and vitamin D were measured by using the food-list section of
the FFQ.
Height at examination 1 (1948–1949) was measured without shoes,
in inches (converted to meters), and measurements of weight were taken
at the 20th examination in pounds (converted to kilograms) with a
standardized balance-beam scale. Smoking status was assessed via the
questionnaire in 1988–1989 as current cigarette smoker (smoked
regularly in the past year), former smoker, or never smoked. Physical
activity was measured with the Framingham physical activity index,
which asked about the number of hours spent in heavy, moderate, light,
or sedentary activity and the number of hours spent sleeping during a
typical day (28). Physical activity index scores at the baseline examina-
tion (1988–1989) were used unless missing; if an individual was missing
data, the physical activity index from 2 y earlier was used. To adjust for
current estrogen use, participants were divided into 3 groups: 1) men, 2)
women who never used estrogen or used it formerly, and 3) women
currently using estrogen (>1 y).

 Ethics. All participants gave informed consent for their participation in
the study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
for Human Research at Boston University, Hebrew Rehabilitation
Center, and Tufts University.
Statistical analysis. The primary exposure variables included intake of
milk, yogurt, cheese, cream, and a combination of milk + yogurt +
cheese. Study outcomes included baseline and 4-y percentage of change
in BMD at the FN, trochanter, and LS. We tested for interaction by sex
by including an interaction term of individual dairy-food intake and sex
in the adjusted models. Similarly, we also tested for interaction by
vitamin D supplement use by including an interaction term of individual
dairy-food intake and vitamin D supplement use in the adjusted models.
Because we tested interactions for 4 dairy-food groups, only interactions
that were significant at P < 0.0125 [a level of 0.05/number of dairy foods
examined (n = 4)] were examined to avoid false-positive results. All dairy
exposures were adjusted for total energy intake by using the residual
method (29). Dairy intakes were regressed on total energy intake to
create residuals, which were then added to the predicted dairy intake for
the mean energy intake of the study population.
To determine the cross-sectional association between dairy intake
variables (modeled as continuous variables, in servings per week) and
BMD at each site, we used multivariable linear regression to calculate
regression coefficients (b) estimating the difference in BMD associated
with a 1-unit increase in dairy intake (i.e., an increase of 1 serving/wk).
Analyses of 4-y percentage of change in BMD from baseline (1988–
1989) to the follow-up (1992–1993) were first calculated as {[(BMD at
follow-up 2 BMD at baseline)/BMD at baseline] 3 100}. The 4-y
percentage of change in BMD was regressed onto the continuous form of
energy-adjusted dairy-food intake variables, adjusting for potential
confounders and covariates. To examine if the cross-sectional and
longitudinal associations between dairy intake variables and bone
measures were modified by vitamin D supplement use, we stratified the
cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses by vitamin D supplement use
(yes or no).
The models were initially adjusted for sex, total energy intake, age,
height, and weight. Subsequent models were further adjusted for current
cigarette smoking and calcium supplement use. Longitudinal models
examining 4-y percentage of change in BMD were further adjusted for
baseline BMD. Starting with a full model, we performed sequential
regression models, removing variables one at a time, such that any
covariate that changed the b coefficient of the primary exposure
by >10% was included in the final parsimonious model. Based on this
method, estrogen use (in women alone), physical activity, alcohol, and
caffeine did not contribute to the final parsimonious models. Final
parsimonious models were further adjusted sequentially for nondairy
calcium intake (expressed as mg/d) and nondairy protein intake
(expressed as g/d). Student�s t test (for normally distributed variables)
and the chi-square test (for categorical variables) were used to compare
participants with baseline BMD assessments alone with those who also
had a follow-up BMD assessment.
All analyses were performed by using SAS statistical software
(version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc.). A nominal 2-sided P value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant for all the analyses. For interac-
tions with sex, nominal 2-sided P values <0.002 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
One thousand one hundred sixty-four cohort members had
BMD measured at the baseline examination in 1988–1989. At
the same examination, 976 participants had complete, usable
FFQs. Of these, 864 participants had $1 BMD measure and a
complete, usable FFQ. After excluding 1 participant with
missing information on BMI and 1 participant with missing
information on milk and yogurt, the final analytic sample for the
cross-sectional study of dairy intake and BMD included 862 men
and women. The final sample for the longitudinal cohort study
of dairy intake and bone loss included 628 men and women.
Mean follow-up time between the 2 BMD measurements was
3.9 y (range: 2.1–5.1 y). The mean age was 75 y (range: 69–96 y)
at the baseline examination (Table 1). Of the 863 total
participants, 38% were men, and 27% used vitamin D supple-
ments. Among vitamin D supplement users, total milk intake
was 6.3 servings/wk (1538 mL/wk), total calcium intake was
966 mg/d, and vitamin D intake was 591 IU/d. In this group,
44% of participants used calcium supplements. Among those
who did not use vitamin D supplements, total milk intake was
5.8 servings/wk (1372 mL/wk), total calcium intake was
745 mg/d, and vitamin D intake was 184 IU/d. In this group
8% of participants used calcium supplements.
Interaction by sex. After adjusting for testing multiple inter-
actions at the a level of 0.0125, no significant interactions were
observed by sex (cross-sectional analyses: P-interaction = 0.013–
0.99; longitudinal analyses: P-interaction = 0.18–0.96). There-
fore, all analyses were conducted with both men and women
combined.
After adjusting for testing multiple interactions at the a level
of 0.0125, in cross-sectional analyses significant interactions
were observed by vitamin D supplement use for LS BMD
(P-interaction with milk = 0.004, fluid dairy = 0.005, and total
dairy = 0.010). No significant interactions were observed by
vitamin D supplement use for other bone sites or other dairy
foods (P-interaction = 0.13–0.94). For longitudinal analyses,
significant interactions were observed by vitamin D supplement
use for trochanter bone loss (P-interaction with total dairy = 0.011)
and LS bone loss (P-interaction with cheese = 0.009). No
significant interactions were observed by vitamin D supplement
use for other bone sites or other dairy foods (P-interaction = 0.032–
0.83). Therefore, all analyses were conducted stratified by vitamin
D supplement use.
Cross-sectional association with BMD. Dairy intake in
servings per week was not associated with BMD in the
multivariate-adjusted models (P = 0.11–0.99) with the full
sample. Adjusted models were then stratified by vitamin D
supplement use (yes or no, Table 2). Among vitamin D
supplement users, but not among nonusers (P = 0.09–0.41),
higher intakes of milk (P = 0.011), fluid dairy (P = 0.009), and
milk + yogurt + cheese (P = 0.005) were associated with higher
LS BMD. Among vitamin D supplement users, there was a
0.006-g/cm2 difference in LS BMD for an increase of 1 serving
milk/wk. These associations did not change significantly after
further adjustment for calcium and protein from nondairy-food
sources except for milk intake, which became negatively
associated with LS BMD (P = 0.030) among nonsupplement
users (data not shown). No significant associations were
observed at the trochanter or FN among vitamin D supplement
users or nonusers (P = 0.11–0.97). These associations did not
change significantly after further adjustment for calcium and
protein from nondairy-food sources, except for cream intake,
which became negatively associated with FN BMD among
vitamin D supplement users (P = 0.050) (data not shown).
Longitudinal association with percentage of change in
BMD over 4 y. In the combined sample of vitamin D
supplement users and non-users, no significant associations were
observed between any type of dairy food and percentage of
change in BMD over 4 y at any site (P = 0.29–0.96) in the
multivariate-adjusted model. However, when stratified by vita-
min D supplement use, among vitamin D supplement users, but
not among nonusers (P = 0.10–0.59), milk + yogurt + cheese

 intakes (P = 0.009) were protective against trochanter-BMD loss
(Table 3). There was a 0.23% increase in trochanter-BMD over
4 y for every serving increase of milk + yogurt + cheese per week.
Similarly, no significant associations between any type of dairy
and percentage change in BMD over 4 y at FN or LS were observed
among vitamin D supplement users or nonusers (P = 0.07–0.79).
These associations did not change significantly after further
adjustment for calcium and protein from nondairy-food sources
(data not shown).
Only 73% of participants had the follow-up BMD measure-
ments for the longitudinal analyses. Those who were lost to
follow-up were older (mean age: 77 y) and had lower BMI (26.0)
than those with follow-up assessments (mean age: 74 y; and
BMI: 26.9).
Discussion
In this group of older men and women, dairy-food intakes were
not significantly associated with BMD or percentage of change
in BMD over 4 y. On stratification by vitamin D supplement use,
among vitamin D supplement users, but not nonusers, higher
intakes of milk, fluid dairy, and a combination of milk + yogurt +
cheese were significantly associated with higher LS BMD,
whereas a higher cream intake was significantly associated
with lower FN BMD. A higher intake of milk + yogurt + cheese
was significantly associated with lower trochanter bone loss
over 4 y. Trochanter BMD was 0.23% greater for each addi-
tional serving of milk + yogurt + cheese per week.
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend
consuming 3 cups/d (1 cup = 237 mL) of fat-free or low-fat milk
or milk products for adults. Despite these recommendations,
>80% of the US population does not meet the dairy intake
recommendation (6). The percentage of Americans who con-
sumed the recommended dairy equivalents/d of fluid milk,
cheese, and yogurt has been estimated as 53%, 45%, and 2%,
respectively (6). Adequate dietary calcium and protein are
essential to achieve optimal peak bone mass during skeletal
growth and to prevent bone loss in the elderly (30). Dairy
products are not only rich in calcium and protein, but they also
provide other key nutrients essential for bone health, including
vitamin D, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Although
several studies have shown the positive impact of milk intake on
BMD, few have examined dairy products beyond milk even
though it has been suggested that dairy foods are not equivalent
vehicles of calcium because of their different nutritional profiles
(31). Additionally, consumption of fermented dairy products,
such as yogurt, may confer additional advantage for gut
microbiota (30), and their effects on bone health remains to be
elucidated. Yet, few large-scale epidemiologic studies have
specifically examined yogurt or have found it difficult to
disaggregate the effect of yogurt consumption from general
dairy consumption (32).
Previous observational studies examining milk intake with
BMD have been largely cross-sectional in nature. In a study
by McCabe et al. (10), higher dairy product consumption
was associated with higher hip BMD in men, but not women,

 aged $60 y. A cross-sectional study of women (aged 44–74 y)
found consistent positive associations between self-reported
milk consumption before the age of 25 y and BMD at total hip,
FN, trochanter, intertrochanter (P < 0.05 each), and Ward�s
triangle (P < 0.005) (33). Results from the Rancho Bernardo
Study of 581 white elderly women (mean age: 71 y) showed that
regular milk consumption in youth was associated with higher
BMD at cortical and trabecular sites (34). A recent study of older
women from the Calcium Intake Fracture Outcome Study/
CAIFOS Aged Extension Study further reported that women
with dairy intakes of $2.2 servings/d had significantly higher
appendicular total and cortical bone mass as well as higher total
and trabecular volumetric BMD than women with dairy intakes
of #1.5 servings/d (35). Our previous cross-sectional study in
the Framingham Offspring Cohort (mean age: 55 y, range: 26–
85 y) showed that milk and yogurt intakes were associated with
hip but not LS BMD, whereas cream was adversely associated
with BMD (11).
The evidence for protective effects of milk and dairy intake
on longitudinal change in total hip and vertebral BMD and total
hip bone mineral content comes largely from RCTs of premen-
opausal women (15, 36). Most of the RCTs in older age groups
comparable to the current study were conducted in non-US
populations of Malaysia (37), Greece (9), and South Australia
(38, 39) with differing intakes of calcium and vitamin D. All
these studies examined fortified milk except 2, which examined
fortified dairy (milk + yogurt) intake (9) and fortified cheese
intake (40). Interestingly, in a study of 101 postmenopausal
women (55–65 y), those randomly assigned to a fortified dairy
group (1200 mg calcium/d and 7.5 mg cholecalciferol/d) had
more favorable changes in pelvis, total spine, and total body
BMD (P = 0.001–0.04) over 12 m than a calcium-supplemented
group (600 mg calcium/d) or the control group (9). Hence, a
concomitant increase of calcium and vitamin D may be more
important for bone density than increasing calcium intake alone
through supplementation. In a study of 200 postmenopausal
Chinese women in Malaysia (aged 55–65 y), those randomly
assigned to a high-calcium skimmed-milk group (1200 mg
calcium) had a reduced rate of bone loss at the hip and LS
compared with the placebo group. This study further reported
significant improvements in the serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D
concentration in the milk group (P < 0.01) (37). Taken together,
these studies suggest a protective role for dairy intake with hip
and LS BMD. However, they were unable to clarify if these
beneficial bone effects of dairy were dependent on adequate
vitamin D intake.
Dairy products are rich in calcium as well as other nutrients,
and thus, there is a benefit to increasing dairy intakes up to a
level of 2–3 servings/d, as suggested by our previous work (11)
and that of others as highlighted in 2 reviews (41, 42). In
addition, vitamin D regulates calcium absorption and skeletal
homeostasis. The active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D facili-
tates the intestinal absorption of calcium by mediating active
calcium transport across the intestinal mucosal brush border to
the basolateral side of the cell (43). This suggests that a person
needs both adequate calcium and vitamin D to ensure optimal

intake of the study population. Parsimonious models were adjusted for age, weight, height, sex (men, women who never used estrogen or
used it formerly, and women currently using estrogen), total energy intake, calcium supplement use, and smoking. Serving size for each

Dairy-food intake, vitamin D, and bone loss

 net absorption of calcium for meeting various body needs from
commonly available food sources (44). The main findings from
the current study showed that specific dairy foods appeared to be
protective against trochanteric bone loss but only among those
with higher vitamin D intakes through supplements. These
findings suggest that individuals who use vitamin D supplements
may reap bone-protective benefits with higher dairy intakes. Of
concern is the finding that dairy foods did not appear to protect
against bone loss among those who did not use vitamin D
supplements. In the United States, fortified foods provide most
of the vitamin D in the diet (45) with 100 IU added per cup in
most milk (45, 46). In addition to vitamin D fortification,
many yogurts in the United States add skim milk powder,
which increases the protein, calcium, and phosphorus content.
Therefore, the lack of association between dairy foods and
bone loss among non–supplement users suggests that the
amounts of vitamin D in dairy foods, which are often fortified
with vitamin D, may not be sufficient to provide bone benefits.
However, it is important to note that those who did not use
vitamin D supplements also tended to have lower intakes of
total (from diet and supplements) vitamin D and calcium.
Further, in this group, relatively fewer individuals were using
calcium supplements (8.1% compared with 43.3% among
vitamin D supplement users).
The current study is unique in that we used data from a
population-based cohort of older individuals followed up for
#4 y. Not only did we examine intake of milk and other dairy
foods, but we further examined if vitamin D supplement use
modified the association of dairy intake with bone loss.
However, this study has several limitations. We used an FFQ,
which is semiquantitative, and dietary data were available
only at the baseline examination. Therefore, we were unable
to adjust for possible changes in diet over follow-up. How-
ever, we examined not just total dairy intake but also specific
dairy-food groups with both BMD and bone loss over 4 y.
Dairy foods, such as milk, yogurt, and cream, have dissimilar
nutritional profiles that may play a role in the way they affect
bone health. Because of a lack of availability of serum vitamin
D concentration in this cohort, we were only able to stratify
these analyses by vitamin D supplement use alone, which does
not account for the vitamin D formed in the skin by sun
exposure. Residual confounding may occur despite our
attempts to control for several potential confounders. Lastly,
the results of this study are generalizable primarily to non-
Hispanic, white men and women.
In conclusion, our results suggest that, in a population of
older men and women, higher intakes of a combination of milk +
yogurt + cheese are associated with lower trochanter bone loss
over 4 y among vitamin D supplement users. Future studies
should consider nutrient profiles of specific dairy groups while
researching their associations with bone health in other popu-
lations and with other clinical outcomes, such as fractures.
Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings by using
serum vitamin D concentrations.
