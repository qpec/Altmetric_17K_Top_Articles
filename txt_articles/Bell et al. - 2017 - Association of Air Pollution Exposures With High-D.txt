H
igh-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles possess numer-
ous potentially cardioprotective qualities.1 HDL particles 
transport cholesterol from lipid-carrying macrophages and are 
vital in the maintenance of net cholesterol balance in the arte-
rial wall.1 Despite strong epidemiological evidence that HDL 
cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with cardiovascu-
lar events, recent clinical trials that raised HDL-C have failed 
to show benefit.2–5 Recent studies suggest that measurement of 
HDL particle number (HDL-P) may better reflect the cardio-
protective qualities of HDL than HDL-C.6–8
Ambient air pollution is associated with atherosclerosis, 
heart failure, and cardiovascular death.9–15 Air pollution may 
affect HDL through inflammation and oxidative stress, promot-
ing changes in HDL structure and function that results in proath-
erogenic or dysfunctional HDL.16,17 Exposures to both fine and 
ultrafine particulate matter (PM) have been associated with devel-
opment of dysfunctional HDL and reduced HDL anti-inflamma-
tory capacity in some (but not all) experimental studies.18–21 The 
association between ambient air pollution and HDL-C, HDL-P, 
and HDL particle size has not been well studied.
We examined the relation between long- and short-term 
concentration of air pollutants—PM2.5 and black carbon 
(BC)—and measures of HDL structure in a multiethnic cohort 
of adults without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). We 
hypothesized that exposure to higher levels of air pollution 
would be associated not only with lower HDL-C, but also 
with lower HDL-P, which may better reflect HDL function. 
In a secondary analysis, we examined associations between 
short-term PM2.5 concentrations and HDL. The MESA (Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis)—an on-going study of risk 
factors that predict progression to clinically overt CVD or 
progression of the subclinical disease in a racially diverse 
population—provides a unique opportunity to combine highly 
refined measures of air pollution exposure with multiple mea-
sures of HDL, including particle number, size, and concentra-
tion, in a multiethnic population.

Objective—The relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular disease may be explained by changes in high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL).
Approach and Results—We examined the cross-sectional relationship between air pollution and both HDL cholesterol and 
HDL particle number in the MESA Air study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Air Pollution). Study participants 
were 6654 white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese men and women aged 45 to 84 years. We estimated individual residential 
ambient fine particulate pollution exposure (PM2.5) and black carbon concentrations using a fine-scale likelihood-based 
spatiotemporal model and cohort-specific monitoring. Exposure periods were averaged to 12 months, 3 months, and 
2 weeks prior to examination. HDL cholesterol and HDL particle number were measured in the year 2000 using the 
cholesterol oxidase method and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. We used multivariable linear 
regression to examine the relationship between air pollution exposure and HDL measures. A 0.7×10−6 m−1 higher exposure 
to black carbon (a marker of traffic-related pollution) averaged over a 1-year period was significantly associated with a 
lower HDL cholesterol (−1.68 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, −2.86 to −0.50) and approached significance with HDL 
particle number (−0.55 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, −1.13 to 0.03). In the 3-month averaging time period, a 5 μg/m3 
higher PM2.5 was associated with lower HDL particle number (−0.64 μmol/L; 95% confidence interval, −1.01 to −0.26), 
but not HDL cholesterol (−0.05 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, −0.82 to 0.71).
Conclusions—These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to air pollution is adversely associated with 
measures of HDL.

Results
Of the 6814 MESA participants, 160 participants had missing 
data on HDL, covariates, and exposure, leaving 6654 partici-
pants for analysis. Individually weighted exposure estimates 
were available for 5330 participants, and BC exposure esti-
mates were available for 6557 participants. The current study 
population comprised 53% female and 18% with less than 
a high school education. Participants were 28% Black, 12% 
Chinese American, 22%, Hispanic and 39% White. Sixteen 
percent of the study population used lipid-lowering drugs, and 
45% participants had hypertension. Predicted individually 
weighted PM2.5 concentrations in the year 2000 ranged from 
4.8 to 21.6 μg/m3, with an interquartile range of 4.1 μg/m3. 
BC concentrations ranged from 0.28 to 4.77 10−6 m−1, with an 
interquartile range of 0.7×10−6 m−1. Mean (SD) HDL-P in our 
study population was 34.0 (6.6) μmol/L. Mean (SD) HDL-C 
in our study population was 50.8 (15.5) mg/dL (Table 1).
HDL Cholesterol
We found a nonsignificant association between higher PM2.5 
concentrations and lower HDL-C concentrations (Table 2). In 
the 2-week averaging period, adjusting for age, sex, race/eth-
nicity, and site only, we observed a significant −0.86 mg/dL 
(95% confidence interval [CI], −1.38 to −0.34) difference in 
HDL-C for a 5 μg/m3 higher PM2.5; however, this association 
attenuated (and became nonsignificant) after adjustment for 
other covariates. We found no significant association between 
short-term (0–5 days prior) PM2.5 exposure or outdoor PM2.5 
exposure and HDL-C (Table 3).
We found a significant association between higher con-
centrations of BC and lower HDL-C levels. A 0.7×10−6 m−1 
higher BC at the 1-year averaged time period was associ-
ated with a −1.68 mg/dL (95% CI, −2.86 to −0.50; P=0.001) 
lower HDL-C when adjusted for covariates in our final model 
(Table 2). Sensitivity analyses additionally adjusting for 
HDL-P, pack-years smoked, income, niacin use, short-term 
pollutant concentrations, both annual averaged PM2.5 and BC 
simultaneously, and models with random slopes and inter-
cepts for site did not meaningfully change the results.
HDL Particle Number
We found a significant inverse association between medium-
term (3-month and 2-week) PM2.5 concentrations and HDL-P, 
but not in the 1-year period, although the association in that 
period was of similar magnitude and direction (Table 2). A 
5-μg/m3 higher 3-month average PM2.5 concentration was 
associated with a −0.64 μmol/L (95% CI, −1.02 to −0.26) 
lower HDL-P, and a 5-μg/m3 higher 2-week average PM2.5 
was associated with a −0.29 μmol/L (95% CI, −0.57 to −0.01) 
lower HDL-P in multivariate-adjusted models (Table 2). In 
the short-term PM2.5 analysis, we found a significant inverse 
association between higher PM2.5 in the 5 days before blood 
draw and HDL-P (−0.21 μmol/L per 5 μg/m3; 95% CI, −0.38 
to −0.04; Table 3). Averaging periods that included fewer days 
before the blood draw had no association with HDL-P.
Adjustment for HDL-C did not significantly change the 
association between PM2.5 and HDL-P in the 3-month aver-
aging time period, although the association in the 2-week 
time was attenuated and not significant (Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement). We found no significant associations 
between outdoor PM2.5 and HDL-P in fully adjusted mod-
els. Sensitivity analyses additionally adjusting for HDL-C, 
pack-years smoked, income, niacin use, short-term pollutant 
concentrations, models adjusting for both pollutants simulta-
neously, and models with random slopes and intercepts for 
site did not meaningfully change the results. The findings 
related to the 3-month exposure period were not affected, in 
direction or significance, by adjusting for the 3-day average 
PM2.5 concentration. Adjusted for 3-day average PM2.5, a 5 μg/
m3 higher PM2.5 over the 3-month time period was associated 
with a −0.50 (95% CI, −0.92 to −0.09) change in HDL-P.
We did not find a significant association between BC and 
HDL-P in the 1-year averaging period, although it borderline 
and in the same direction as previous associations. A 0.7×10−6 
m−1 higher BC exposure was associated with −0.55 μmol/L 
(95% CI, −1.13 to 0.03) lower HDL-P. This association did 
not change with adjustment for mean HDL particle size, HDL-
C, pack-years smoked, income, and niacin use. Models using 
random intercepts and slopes to control for site also showed 
no change.
We found a significant interaction between sex and 
the association between BC and HDL-C (P for interaction 
<0.001), with the association stronger in women for BC and 
HDL-C (−2.63 mg/dL; 95% CI, −4.46 to −0.81) than in men 
(−0.65 mg/dL; 95% CI, −2.14 to 0.84). We observed a stron-
ger relationship in women for 3-month exposure to PM2.5 and 
HDL-P (−0.71 μmol/L; 95% CI, −1.33 to −0.09 for women 
compared with −0.48 μmol/L; 95% CI, −0.93 to −0.02 for 
men [P for interaction =0.02]). The same phenomenon was 
observed for 2-week exposure to PM2.5 and HDL-P (−0.42 
μmol/L; 95% CI, −0.89 to 0.05 for women compared with 
−0.15 μmol/L; 95% CI, −0.49 to 0.18 for men [P for inter-
action =0.03]). While the interaction was not significant, we 
observed that among those taking lipid lowering medications, 
1-year averaged BC was associated with a −2.60 mg/dL (95% 
CI, −5.18 to −0.02) change in HDL-C compared with a −1.38 
mg/dL (95% CI, −2.70 to −0.05) change in HDL-C among 
those not taking lipid-lowering medication. Among those with 
hypertension 1-one year averaged BC was associated with 
a −1.94 mg/dL (95% CI, −3.76 to −0.13) change in HDL-C 
compared with a −1.48 mg/dL (95% CI, −3.04 to 0.09) change

in HDL-C among those without hypertension. Among those 
taking lipid-lowering medications, 3-month averaged PM2.5 
was associated with a −1.36 mg/dL (95% CI, −2.26 to −0.46) 
change in HDL-P, compared with a −0.47 mg/dL (95% CI,

cant interactions.
Discussion
In a large, multiethnic cohort study of men and women free of 
prevalent clinical CVD, we found that higher concentrations 
of PM2.5 over a 3-month time period was associated with lower

HDL-P, and higher annual concentrations of BC were associ-
ated with lower HDL-C. Lower HDL particle numbers have 
been associated with increasing carotid intima-medial thick-
ness and cardiovascular events in previous studies, and lower 
HDL-C is a traditional risk factor for CVD.1,6,8,22
In MESA participants, a 5 μg/m3 higher concentration of 
PM2.5 over a 3-month time period was associated with a −0.64 
μmol/L lower HDL-P. This observed lower HDL-P is compa-
rable to other traditional risk factors such as those observed 
in smoking cessation studies (1.0 μmol/L change).23 Lower 
HDL-P levels in MESA participants have been independently 
associated with carotid atherosclerosis and coronary heart 
disease. A 0.7×10−6 m−1 higher exposure to BC over a 1-year 
period was also associated with a −1.68 mg/dL lower concen-
tration of HDL-C. This lower HDL-C can be compared with 
the effect of quitting smoking (2.4 mg/dL change) on HDL-C 
in smoking cessation programs.23 These associations persisted 
after control for smoking and other risk factors for HDL. 
Effect sizes for PM2.5 and HDL-P increased from day of blood 
draw to 5-day, 2-week, and finally to 3-month averaged time 
periods, which may indicate a potential cumulative exposure 
effect. However, we did not see an association between 1-year 
averaged PM2.5 and HDL-P, suggesting that potential effects of 
air pollution on HDL may be more short term or medium term.
This is the first large observational study to suggest an 
association between air pollution exposure and HDL particle 
number. Our results build on previous work suggesting an 
association between air pollution and HDL through the use 
of additional properties of HDL, which may be potentially 
more clinically relevant, and examining them in a multiethnic 
cohort with excellent measurement of covariates and cutting 
edge assessment of air pollution exposure. This study con-
tributes to the hypothesis that air pollution may act through 
HDL to contribute to CVD at comparably low levels found in 
developed countries. In examining different pollutant averag-
ing times, our study also adds information suggesting that air 
pollution may be associated with changes in HDL in both the 
short term and the medium term and that both time periods 
may be relevant for examining the effect of air pollution on 
CVD risk factors.

Two cohort studies, conducted by Chuang et al,24 in Taiwan 
have previously investigated the relationship between air pol-
lution and HDL in humans. In a population-based survey, they 
reported a decrease in HDL-C per interquartile range increase 
in PM10 over a 1-day averaging period before blood draw.24 In 
a separate cross-sectional analysis, they found no association 
between a 1 interquartile range increase in 1-year averaged air 
pollution exposure before blood draw and HDL-C in a cohort 
of 1023 subjects aged 54 to 90 years living in Taiwan.25 These 
studies relied on central-site monitoring data and had limited 
data on likely confounding variables, such as socioeconomic 
status, smoking, physical activity, and use of lipid-lowering 
medications, which are associated with both air pollution and 
HDL, and may explain why our study found differing results. 
Our results are consistent with a prior occupational study of 
PM2.5 and HDL-C in a repeated measures panel study of weld-
ers.26 Those exposed to high PM2.5 during welding experi-
enced an acute decrease of −2.6 mg/dL (95% CI, −5.3 to −0.0) 
in circulating HDL-C levels 18 hours after exposure compared 
with their baseline levels.26 These magnitude of effect sizes 
were higher than those observed in our study; however, weld-
ers were exposed to much higher concentrations of pollutants.
Characteristics of HDL beyond total concentration are 
likely important in the protective effects of the lipoprotein. 
In our study, we focused on particle number as an alternate 
characteristic, though there is reason to think that functional 
characteristics—not assessed here—are also important and 
may be affected by air pollutant or other exposures, such as 
tobacco smoke.18–20,27–31 For example, in Yin et al,19 samples 
of HDL from mice exposed to fine and ultrafine PM were 
found to have significantly reduced HDL anti-inflammatory 
properties compared with those of unexposed mice, suggest-
ing that PM exposure may reduce the ability of HDL to protect 
against atherosclerosis.19 Experimental study of HDL function 
and structure is needed to confirm and further characterize the 
effect of air pollution on HDL.
As a whole, these studies are consistent with the hypoth-
esis that exposure to air pollution increases risk of CVD. Our 
findings support hypotheses that HDL may play a role in the 
biological pathway explaining the association between air 
pollution and CVD.17 PM has been shown to induce creation 
of dysfunction HDL, which is associated with reduced protec-
tion against atherosclerosis through inability to participate in 
reverse cholesterol transport and antioxidation.17,19,32
Both the relationship between PM2.5 and HDL-P and the 
relationship between BC and HDL-C were modified by sex. 
In both cases, the association between air pollution and HDL 
was stronger in women, although the association in men was 
still negative. Women typically have higher levels of both 
HDL-P and HDL-C than men, which has been attributed to 
higher estrogen production in women.33 Some research has 
suggested that air pollutants may induce estrogen-disrupting 
effects, acting as a potential xenoestrogen involved in the gen-
eration of reactive oxygen species and induction of oxidative 
stress.34,35 Although many of the women in our study were 
postmenopausal, air pollution–related disruption of the HDL-
raising effects of estrogen may explain the stronger results 
observed in women. Our study found no significant evidence 
of effect modification by age, race/ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, obesity, or site. Our sensitivity analyses examining 
adjustment for other aspects of HDL did not strongly change 
the conclusions of our study. The positive association between 
3-month average of PM2.5 and HDL-C when controlling for 
HDL-P is difficult to interpret; however, it may be explained 
by a reduction in the number of small, cholesterol-depleted 
HDL particles, leaving the average amount of cholesterol in 
HDL particles higher on a per-particle basis. Smaller HDL 
particles may play a more important role in cholesterol efflux 
than larger particles, so a reduction in the number of smaller 
HDL particles supports the hypothesis that the relationship 
between air pollution and CVD could be mediated through 
change in cholesterol efflux.36 We also observed associations 
between HDL and individually weighted PM2.5—which takes 
into account participant’s time spent indoors—but not out-
door PM2.5, which simply estimates PM2.5 outside a partici-
pant’s home. Because many study subjects spend the majority 
of their time indoors, this estimate will contain some error 
because only a fraction of outdoor air pollution penetrates

 Bell et al  Air Pollution and HDL  981
into homes. Subjects also spend time away from their homes 
and may also spend time in traffic on roadways, which can 
be significant source of air pollution exposure itself, further 
exposing them to air pollution that is generally not taken into 
account by outdoor air pollution exposure estimates.
This study has several strengths as a large, population-
based, multiethnic cohort able to examine the relationship 
between air pollution and advanced measures of HDL. The 
MESA study features measurement of numerous covariates, 
with multiple levels of quality control.37 Great care was taken 
in producing high-quality air pollution estimates, with cohort-
specific monitoring and modeling and with special attention 
paid to minimizing measurement error in the estimates.38,39 
This is the first study to examine air pollution and measures 
of HDL particle number and size in a large cohort setting. 
However, while our exposure models are more accurate and 
less susceptible to measurement error than distance to moni-
tor or nearest roadway analyses, we cannot rule out the limi-
tation of measurement error in our models. The measurement 
error in air pollution estimates is likely to be independent of 
HDL measurements, so we would generally expect this error 
to be nondifferential and bias estimates toward the null, rep-
resenting an underestimation of the true measure of effect. 
Air pollution is a complex mixture of particles and gases, 
and it is possible that our estimates may be driven by a dif-
ferent, highly correlated pollutant that is unmeasured, or an 
interaction between the pollutants, rather than PM2.5 or BC 
per se. Further study of multipollutant models and mixtures 
will be needed to confirm these results. Another limitation 
of our study is its cross-sectional design. HDL-P was only 
been measured at one point in time, and a snapshot analysis 
of air pollution and HDL cannot provide valid inference on 
the effect of air pollution on HDL over time. Although esti-
mates of air pollution represent participants’ exposure in the 
time period before HDL was measured, associations from 
this study should be interpreted with caution. Finally, while 
covariates were measured carefully during exams, we can-
not rule out the possibility that residual confounding exists 
because of potentially important covariates being unmeasured 
or measured with error.
In summary, we found evidence that exposure to PM2.5 and 
BC were associated with changes in several measures of HDL, 
and short-term exposure was associated with lower HDL-P in 
our study of a multiethnic population free of CVD.

Highlights
• Exposure to traffic-related air pollutants is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but the biological mechanisms explaining this 
association are not fully understood.
• High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are a well-established cardiovascular risk factor, and air pollution–related differences in HDL may explain some 
of the association between traffic-related air pollution and cardiovascular disease.
• Some important cardioprotective qualities of HDL are not fully captured by measuring the cholesterol content of HDL particles, so we used 
additional experimental measurements of HDL particle number and size to better understand the relationship between traffic-related air pol-
lution and HDL biology.
• We found associations between higher levels of 2 traffic-related air pollutants—fine particulate matter and black carbon—and lower levels 
of several different measures of HDL among MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) participants living in 6 metropolitan areas in the 
United States.
