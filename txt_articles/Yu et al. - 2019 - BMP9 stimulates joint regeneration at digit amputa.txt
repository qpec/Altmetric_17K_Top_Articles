A major goal of regenerative medicine is to stimulate tissue regeneration after traumatic
injury. We previously discovered that treating digit amputation wounds with BMP2 in neo-
natal mice stimulates endochondral ossification to regenerate the stump bone. Here we show
that treating the amputation wound with BMP9 stimulates regeneration of a synovial joint
that forms an articulation with the stump bone. Regenerated structures include a skeletal
element lined with articular cartilage and a synovial cavity, and we demonstrate that this
response requires the Prg4 gene. Combining BMP2 and BMP9 treatments in sequence sti-
mulates the regeneration of bone and joint. These studies provide evidence that treatment of
growth factors can be used to engineer a regeneration response from a non-regenerating
amputation wound.

ammals display poor regenerative capabilities and the
typical response to traumatic injury is fibrotic heal-
ing1,2. One strategy to enhance mammalian regen-
erative responses is to use developmental agents to re-initiate
morphogenesis at non-regenerative amputation wounds3, and
this strategy has been used successfully to stimulate bone regen-
eration with targeted treatment of bone morphogenetic protein 2
(BMP2) or BMP74–8. Transient treatment of the amputation
wound with BMP2 induces formation of an endochondral ossi-
fication center that organizes the regeneration response of the
amputated stump bone4,5. This induced regeneration response
elongates the stump bone but fails to regenerate amputated distal
structures such as the joint and the next distal skeletal element. A
major next step in enhancing mammalian regeneration is to
address regeneration of a joint, a structure that contains articular
cartilage which displays poor regenerative capabilities9. During
joint development the formation of the synovial cavity is central
to joint morphogenesis10, and synovial cavity formation fails in
digits that lack the BMP2 antagonist Noggin11, suggesting that
regulation of BMP signaling is required for joint morphogenesis.
To investigate joint morphogenesis and whether mammalian
joints can regenerate, we have focused on a BMP family member,
BMP9, which is specifically expressed by interzone cells of the
forming synovial cavity and lacks a Noggin binding domain12.
We hypothesize that BMP9 can act as a regenerative agent to
stimulate joint regeneration at a non-regenerative amputation by
re-initiating joint morphogenesis.
Here we demonstrate that treating non-regenerative digit
amputation wounds with BMP9 stimulates the regeneration of
joint structures. The regenerated joint includes a synovial cavity
and a skeletal element lined with articular cartilage that articu-
lates with the amputated bone stump. Further, we show that
BMP9-induced joint regeneration requires the proteoglycan 4
(Prg4) gene. Lastly, we demonstrate that the sequential treatment
of BMP2 followed by BMP9 stimulates the regeneration of bone
and joint by cells that would otherwise undergo fibrotic healing.
Taken together, our findings demonstrate that growth factor
treatment can be used to overcome mammalian regenerative
defects, and provides further evidence that regenerative failure in
mammals is associated with a defective wound environment.
Results
Exogenous BMP9 stimulates regeneration of joint structures.
Bmp9 is predominately expressed by the embryonic liver, but
during limb development, Bmp9 is expressed by interzone cells
during late stages of digit joint formation (Fig. 1a; Supplementary
Fig. 1a). This expression is restricted to cells involved with cavi-
tation to form the synovial cavity and is transient: Bmp9 is not
expressed prior to joint formation nor is it expressed after the
joint is complete (Supplementary Fig. 1b-d). Since joint formation
fails in mice lacking the BMP antagonist Noggin, and BMP9 is
refractory to Noggin inhibition, its expression during joint mor-
phogenesis raised the possibility that BMP9 can act as a regen-
erative agent to stimulate joint regeneration.
Digit amputation (Fig. 1b) is used as a non-regenerative model
system in neonatal and adult mice2,4,5,13. Amputation bisects the
sub-terminal phalangeal element (P2), removing the distal part of
P2, the terminal phalangeal element (P3) and the intervening P2/
P3 joint. Digit amputation results in skeletal truncation and
fibrotic healing (Supplementary Fig. 1e) with no indication of a
skeletal or joint regenerative response. At the core of induced
regeneration studies is the view that cells of the amputation
wound possess the necessary information to regenerate all
structures removed by amputation, and we have shown that cells
of the mouse amputation display this type of positional
information4. To treat amputation wounds with a purified
growth factor, a single agarose bead is soaked in a high
concentration of growth factor and implanted between the
wound epidermis and the amputated stump bone. In vitro studies
estimate that a single agarose bead delivers 5.5 ng of BMP9 that is
released over a 72 h period (Supplementary Fig. 1f), and this
delivery vehicle is intended to transiently stimulate cells locally at
the amputation wound. BMP9 treatment stimulates the regenera-
tion of a new distal skeletal element that appears to articulate with
the stump bone (Fig. 1c) in 51% of the digits (49/96) analyzed
using microcomputed tomography (µCT). This observation is
significant as a distal skeletal element is not observed in any
bovine serum albumin (BSA)-treated control digits (0/29 digits; P
< 0.0001). Digits evaluated by histological analysis, not µCT,
demonstrate that the regenerated skeletal element is not ectopic,
but forms a joint-like articulation with the stump bone that
includes a distinct cavity associated with a chondrogenic layer of
cells in 61% of the digits (60/98; Supplementary Fig. 2a, d, g, j). In
digits maintained for an extended time period, the chondrogenic
cell layer differentiates into articular cartilage that is histologically
similar to undamaged articular cartilage (Fig. 1d, e). The BMP9-
treated digit stump does not form a complete cartilage layer;
however, patches of articular chondrocytes can be identified on
the stump surface (Fig. 1e). The remaining BMP9-treated digits
that lack a regenerated skeletal element (Supplementary Fig. 2b)
appear similar to control BSA-treated digits which heal the stump
bone with fibrotic tissue (Supplementary Fig. 2c).
BMP9 induces cavitation and chondrogenesis. Histological
analysis 72 h following BMP9 treatment identifies two distinct
responses: (1) digits that regenerated a chondrogenic nodule and
cavity, referred to as cavity-forming digits (Supplementary
Fig. 2d), or 2) digits that failed to form a nodule and cavity,
referred to as non-cavity-forming digits (Supplementary Fig. 2e).
The digit stump of BMP9-treated non-cavity-forming digits at 72
h appears undifferentiated and is capped with a cluster of
chondrogenic cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e) that is maintained at
7 days (Supplementary Fig. 2h), but the digit stump is ossified by
14 days (Supplementary Fig. 2k). BMP9-treated cavity-forming
digits maintain a chondrogenic nodule at 7 and 14 days following
treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2g, j). The fibrotic healing
response of amputated digits treated with BSA was similar to
previous descriptions (Supplementary Fig. 2f, i, l1).
The chondrogenic nature of the regenerated nodule in cavity-
forming digits was confirmed based on expression of Col2a1
transcripts 72 h after BMP9 treatment (Fig. 1f). We also observe
expression of other chondrogenic genes known to be associated
with the development of articular chondrocytes including Sox914,
Aggrecan (Acan)15, Fibromodulin (Fmod)16 and Upper growth
plate and cartilage matrix associated protein (Ucma)17 (Fig. 1g–j).
In addition, we show that doublecortin (Dcx)18 is expressed by
developing articular chondrocytes of the uninjured digit joint
(Fig. 1k) and by surface cells of the BMP9-induced nodule 72 h
after treatment (Fig. 1l), but not by cells of the BSA-treated digits
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). Chondrogenic genes are not expressed
by cells of the amputation wound in BSA-treated control digits
(Fig. 1m–q). In BMP9-treated non-cavity-forming digits, we find
transcripts of Col2a1, Sox9, Acan, Fmod and Ucma up-regulated
at the distal end of the stump (Fig. 1r–v) at 72 h. This is consistent
with histological studies (Supplementary Fig. 2e) and since
BMP9-treated non-cavity-forming digits fail to maintain a
chondrogenic layer of cells at the end of the stump (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2b), the induced expression of these chondrogenic genes
by BMP9 is not sufficient to drive articular cartilage regeneration
on the digit stump. These studies show that BMP9 induces

 chondrogenic gene expression in all treated digits, but only those
digits that formed a cavity regenerate a joint-like structure that
includes articular cartilage.
In BMP9-treated cavity-forming digits, Col2a1 expression is
maintained by cells of the nodule 7 days after BMP9 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 3b), but these cells do not express Col10a1
transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Control BSA-treated digits at
72 h and 7 days do not express Col2a1 or Col10a1 (Fig. 1m,
Supplementary Fig. 3d-f). ColX expression is observed at 11 days
after BMP9 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3g) and hypertrophic
chondrocytes are identified histologically by 14 days (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2j), indicating that the regenerated skeletal element
forms by endochondral ossification. These data indicate that
BMP9 stimulates the aggregation and differentiation of chon-
drocytes but their progression to hypertrophic chondrocytes is
delayed compared to BMP2-treated digits4. Bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) incorporation studies indicate that BMP9 stimulates
proliferation of cells surrounding the bead at 72 h, as compared to
BSA-treated controls, and that the proliferation response is
independent of cavity formation (Supplementary Fig. 3h-j). In
cavity-forming digits, the nodule is not next to the BMP9 bead
and BrdU-labeled chondrocytes are not present, indicating that
BMP9 does not stimulate chondrocyte proliferation (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3h). The absence of proliferating chondrocytes and
delayed hypertrophic differentiation distinguishes the BMP9
response from BMP2 stimulation of endochondral ossification4.
Prg4 is required for BMP9-induced joint cavitation. All BMP9-
treated digits initiate a chondrogenic response, but only digits
that also regenerate a cavity form a joint-like structure. This
suggests that the cavitation response plays a key role in the joint
regeneration response. Prg4 expression is associated with synovial
cavity formation during development. Prg4 encodes for the core
protein of lubricin, a proteoglycan found in synovial fluid, and its
expression correlates with the early evolution of the vertebrate
synovial joint19. Prg4 is expressed by the superficial cell layer of
articular cartilage and recent studies show that stem/progenitor
cells in this layer give rise to all articular cartilage layers20,21.
Thus, the cavitation requirement in joint regeneration may be
linked to progenitor cells associated with Prg4-expressing super-
ficial cells. During digit development, Prg4 transcripts localize to
the digit joint during cavitation (Supplementary Fig. 3k) and is
specifically expressed by cells of the superficial cell layer lining the
P2/P3 synovial cavity (Fig. 2a). Prg4 is not expressed by cells of
BSA-treated control digit amputation (Supplementary Fig. 3l), or
by BMP9-treated samples that fail to form a cavity at 72 h
(Supplementary Fig. 3m). However, in BMP9-treated cavity-
forming digits, Prg4 transcripts are expressed by cells of the
induced cavity as well as by some cells of the distal nodule that
abut the cavity (Fig. 2b). By 7 days after BMP9 treatment, only
cells forming the cavity express Prg4, and the cavity abuts both
the P2 stump and the regenerating nodule (Fig. 2c). The
expression of Prg4 by cells forming the cavity identify the
regenerated cavity as synovial19. At 24 h following BMP9 treat-
ment, a clear cavitation response is not identified; however, we
find samples in which clusters of Prg4-expressing cells are asso-
ciated with regions of reduced cell density (Fig. 2d), suggesting a
relationship between induced Prg4 expression and the initiation
of cavitation.
To investigate if Prg4 is required for BMP9-induced cavitation,
we performed P2 amputations and BMP9 treatment in the Prg4
−/− mouse22. Prg4−/− mice form joints indicating that it is not
required for joint development; however, mutant joints have
reduced articular cartilage surfaces and display a joint degenera-
tion phenotype22,23. Digits of Prg4−/− and Prg4+/− neonates
were amputated and treated with BMP9 or BSA after wound
closure. BSA treatment did not evoke a regeneration response in
Prg4+/− (n = 8 digits, Fig. 2e) or Prg4−/− (n = 4 digits, Fig. 2f)
mice. As a positive control, Prg4+/− digits treated with BMP9
regenerated skeletal articulations at a frequency similar to that
observed in wild-type mice (Fig. 2g, 50%; n = 24 digits). In
contrast, Prg4−/− digits failed to display a BMP9-induced
articulation response (Fig. 2h, 0%, n = 32 digits), demonstrating
that the Prg4 gene is required for BMP9-induced regeneration of
joint structures. The Prg4−/− response is reminiscent of BMP9-
treated non-cavity-forming wild-type digits, and hence we
investigated whether the BMP9-induced chondrogenic response
was dependent on Prg4. Digits were amputated, treated with
BMP9 after wound closure, collected 72 h later and analyzed by
in situ hybridization. Prg4−/− digits treated with BMP9 failed to
form a cavity, but cells at the distal stump did express transcripts
for Col2a1, Sox9, Acan, Fmod and Ucma, indicating that the
chondrogenic arm of the BMP9 response was intact and is not
dependent on Prg4 (Fig. 2i–m). These studies demonstrate that
BMP9 treatment of the digit amputation wound induces two
distinct events, chondrogenic induction and cavitation. The
induction of a chondrogenic response is consistently observed
while BMP9-induced cavitation is more variable, and the data
support the conclusion that both responses are required for the
regeneration of joint structures.
BMP9 stimulates joint regeneration in adult digits. Developing
tissues are known to display enhanced regenerative/repair prop-
erties when compared to mature adult tissue. To explore the effect
of BMP9 treatment on adult digit amputations we used a sol–gel
delivery mechanism effective in eliciting a BMP2-induced bone
regenerative response5. Using this protocol, the effect of BMP9 on
adult digit amputations was tested by applying BMP9 (250 ng)
9 days after amputation. BSA-treated control digits healed with-
out a regenerative response as previously described5. Digits were
collected 7 and 14 days after BMP9 treatment and were analyzed
for a regenerative response. BMP9 induced a robust chondrogenic
response in all of the digits analyzed at 7 days (n = 4). The
regenerated cartilage grew well beyond the amputation plane
(Fig. 3a) forming a mushroom-shaped cartilage mass that was
contiguous with the peripheral callus that forms after digit
amputation1. The large cartilaginous callus is composed of
chondrocytes embedded in a dense extracellular matrix (Fig. 3b)
and cells are immunopositive for Sox9 and Acan (Fig. 3c, d). We
did not observe a cavity associated with the chondrogenic
response in our samplings at 7 days. The majority of digit samples
analyzed at 14 days (n = 4/5) showed a similar but enlarged
chondrogenic response compared to digits collected at 7 days.
However, one of the digits displayed a milder chondrogenic
response that was not associated with the peripheral callus but
was distal to the amputated stump and formed a cavity between
the stump and the regenerated chondrogenic element (Fig. 3e, f).
The stump component of the cavity was differentiated bone,
while the cells lining the regenerated distal element were
positive for Sox9 and internal cells expressed both Sox9 and Acan
(Fig. 3g, h). The regenerated structure was immunonegative
for
the

marker,

(Supplementary Fig. 3n). These studies indicate that BMP9
stimulates both a chondrogenic and cavitation response at adult
digit amputation wounds, but the chondrogenic arm of the BMP9
response dominates. Nevertheless, the data show that joint-like
structures can be induced to regenerate in adult mice.

 of a central cavity with two articular cartilage layers associated
with the adjoining bone elements. BMP9 treatment of neonatal
digit amputations result in the formation of a synovial cavity and
a distal, but not proximal, articular cartilage layer. At the time of
amputation, the P2 stump is undergoing ossification and we
hypothesize that the differentiation state of the stump limits the
response to BMP9. To explore this we took advantage of our
previous finding that BMP2 stimulates the formation of an apical
population of proliferating chondrocytes that establishes an
endochondral ossification center4. In the BMP2 response the
apical zone of proliferating chondrocytes are present from 3 to
7 days after BMP2 treatment. Therefore, we carried out studies in
which the amputation wound is treated sequentially; first, with
BMP2 to induce proliferating chondrocytes and, second, with
BMP9 to stimulate joint regeneration (Fig. 4a). These sequential
treatment studies (B2–B9) were carried out with a 3- or 7-day
interval separating the two treatments to target the proliferating
chondrocyte cell population. The 3-day interval stimulated joint
regeneration at a frequency similar to BMP9 alone (57/95 (58%),
Fig. 4b) and the 7-day interval stimulated regeneration at a sig-
nificantly higher frequency (56/80 (70%), P = 0.0135). In both
series, histological analyses indicated the regeneration of a com-
plete joint structure that included a layer of articular cartilage
lining the stump (Fig. 4c). Control studies in which BMP2
treatment was followed by a second treatment with another
BMP2 bead stimulated excessive bone growth but not the
regeneration of joint structures (Fig. 4d; 0/16 digits). In another
control series, amputated digits were treated with BMP9 10 days
after amputation and these digits regenerated joint structures that
did not involve the digit stump (Fig. 4e, f). Comparing the
sequential B2–B9 response with control undamaged digit joints
shows that the regenerated cavity consisted of opposing layers of
cells that are immunopositive for ColII (Fig. 4g, h), Acan (Fig. 4i, j)
and Dcx (Fig. 4k; Fig. 1k), consistent with the regeneration of
articular cartilage. The expression of Prg4 transcripts 96 h after
B2–B9 treatment confirmed the regeneration of a synovial cavity
(Fig. 4l), and expression of Fmod and Ucma by cells of the distal
stump confirmed the differentiation of chondrocytes (Fig. 4m, n).
B2–B9-treated digits displayed an enhanced joint regeneration
response (i.e., two articular cartilage layers) and a higher response
frequency, suggesting that BMP2 treatment elevated the BMP9
cavitation response. To explore this further, 72 h after treatment
with BMP2, we found a robust Prg4 expression domain associated
with
the

bead
but
without
a
cavitation
response
(Supplementary Fig. 3o), indicating that both BMP2 and BMP9
induce Prg4 expression by cells of the amputation wound.
However, cavitation only occurs following BMP9 treatment,
indicating that Prg4 expression is required but not sufficient to
induce cavitation and joint regeneration, and suggests that BMP2
enhances the BMP9 response by enrichment of the Prg4-
expressing cell population. Since BMP9 treatment alone stimu-
lated chondrogenesis but delayed hypertrophic differentiation, we
explored whether BMP2-induced endochondral ossification of the
stump occurs in conjunction with joint regeneration following

 B2–B9 treatment. Col2a1, but not Col10a1, transcripts are
localized to distal stump cells 48 h after BMP9 treatment
consistent with an inhibitory effect of BMP9 on hypertrophic
chondrocyte differentiation (Fig. 4o, p). At 96 h, however, both
Col2a1 and Col10a1 transcripts co-localize to cells of the digit
stump (Fig. 4q, r), indicating that endochondral ossification of the
stump does occur in conjunction with BMP9-stimulated joint
regeneration. Endochondral ossification of the stump was also
confirmed based on histological analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3p),
and direct measurements of the P2 stump indicated significant
skeletal elongation of B2–B9-treated digits compared to BSA
controls (B2–B9 = 1.28 mm, n = 32, s.d. = 0.15 vs. BSA = 0.86
mm, n = 21, s.d. = 0.14; P < 0.01). These results demonstrate that
BMP2 treatment of the amputation wound stimulates formation
of an endochondral ossification center that mediates skeletal
growth from the stump, and also establishes a responsive
population of apical cells that can participate in joint regeneration
if appropriately stimulated. Thus, sequential treatment of the
amputation wound with BMP2 and BMP9 successfully integrates
bone regeneration with joint regeneration.
Discussion
BMP9 is a member of the BMP family of growth factors24 pro-
duced by the liver25 and present in circulating plasma26. BMP9 is
a physiological ligand for activin receptor-like kinase 127 and, like
other BMP family members, signals through the phosphorylation
of Smad 1/5/828. Unlike other BMP family members, BMP9 is not
effected by BMP antagonists such as Noggin12 which suppresses
BMP signaling and is necessary for joint morphogenesis11. We
show here that Bmp9 is transiently expressed during digit joint
cavitation and that BMP9 treatment stimulates joint regeneration.
Mutant studies indicate that Bmp9 is not essential for joint for-
mation29; however, redundancy of gene function is frequently
observed in joint and skeletal development30–33 and regenerative
events are stimulated by treatment with non-essential gene pro-
ducts4,8,34. BMP9 has been shown to play a role in the regulation
of angiogenesis35, liver fibrosis36, osteogenesis37 and chon-
drogenesis38–41. During angiogenesis, BMP9 acts in a context-
dependent manner, inhibiting neovascularization in a model of
age-related macular degeneration42, while stimulating angiogen-
esis associated with induced osteogenesis43. Similarly, BMP9
inhibits endogenous digit tip regeneration in neonatal mice44,
while stimulating the regeneration of joint structures at non-
regenerative amputations. Such context-dependent responses
indicate that cells associated with the injury response determine
the outcome of BMP9 stimulation, thus shifting attention to the
cell
types
participating
in
endogenous
repair/regenerative
programs.
The joint is an essential structural component of the muscu-
loskeletal system, but unlike bone and skeletal muscle, joint tis-
sues, particularly articular cartilage, display a limited capacity for
repair9. Joint degenerative disorders such as osteoarthritis affect a
large portion of the world population and most clinical approa-
ches focus on engineering articular cartilage for transplantation,
not on enhancing endogenous regenerative properties45. We have
discovered
that
treating
amputation
wounds
with
BMP9 stimulates the regeneration of joint structures, including
articular cartilage and synovial cavity. The action of BMP9 on
joint regeneration is likely indirect since two independent
induction events, chondrogenesis and cavitation, are required.
Further, BMP9 morphogenetic activity can occur at a distance
from the BMP9 source, while proliferation is stimulated in
neighboring cells that are not involved in either response. The
requirement of Prg4 by cells undergoing cavitation is consistent
with lineage studies identifying stem cells in the superficial layer
associated with the synovial cavity as a cell source for all layers of
articular cartilage20,21. The differential response of the digit
stump versus the regenerated skeletal element suggests that
BMP9-induced chondrogenesis plays a supporting role for

 articular cartilage differentiation by superficial chondrocytes. This
conclusion is further supported by B2–B9 studies showing that
chondrogenic modification of the stump by BMP2 enhances the
BMP9 response. Thus, the endochondral ossification center
established by BMP2 generates a chondrogenic template that
supports osteoblast differentiation at one end4,5, and articular
cartilage differentiation at the other end, and both processes can
be stimulated at a non-regenerative amputation wound.
Transient treatment with either BMP2 or BMP9 transforms the
mammalian wound healing response in distinct ways to stimulate
regeneration. In the case of BMP2, a zone of proliferating
chondrocytes differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes that
forms a template for stump bone regeneration4. BMP2 also
enhances
cell
recruitment
by
activating
the
SDF-1/
CXCR4 signaling pathway;46 thus, induced skeletal regeneration
involves a coordinated response by multiple cell types in the
amputation wound. In the case of BMP9 treatment, a coordinated
response involving condensation and differentiation of chon-
drocytes coupled with the formation of a synovial cavity results in
the regeneration of joint structures. These two regenerative
responses identify discrete morphogenetic programs that can be
activated either independently or coordinately within the context
of the amputation wound. These findings provide further support
for the view that cells of a non-regenerative mammalian

 amputation wound retain the positional information necessary to
re-build structures removed by amputation, and that regenerative
failure results from a deficiency of the wound environment that
can be extrinsically manipulated to engineer regenerative events.
Materials and methods
Mouse digit amputation and BMP treatment. Pregnant outbred CD1 mice were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). The Prg4 knockout mice
(Prg4tm1Mawa/J) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
For neonatal studies, digit amputations were carried out on postnatal day 3 (PN3),
and treatment of the amputation wound was carried out after wound closure on
PN7 as previously described4. Briefly, a single agarose microcarrier bead (Affi-Gel
Blue Gel beads, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used to deliver BMP9, BMP2 or BSA
to the amputation wound. Microcarrier beads were soaked with recombinant
human BMP9 (500 ng/µl; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), recombinant human
BMP2 (500 ng/µl; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or BSA (0.1% in phosphate-
buffered saline) and implanted between the bone stump and wound epidermis as
previously described8. For sequential growth factor treatment, amputated digits
were treated with a BMP2 bead at PN7 to induce chondrogenic condensation and
then treated with a BMP9 bead 3 (PN10) or 7 (PN14) days later. A minimum
sample size (n = 8) was determined via power analysis (1−β = 0.8; α = 0.05). The
amount of BMP9 delivered by a single agarose bead was estimated in vitro using
the BRITER BMP responsive cell line (Kerafast, Inc., Boston, MA). BRITER cells
contain a luciferase reporter under the control of the Id1 promoter and provides a
readout of Smad mediated signaling. Since BMP9 lacks a Noggin binding site,
BRITER cells were used in the presence of Noggin (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) to measure BMP9 signaling without background BMP2/4/
7 signaling. Different doses of BMP9 in media containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum
were used to generate a standard response curve from 0.1 to 50 ng/ml. BRITER
cells were incubated with BMP9 for 5 h and the Luciferase Assay System (Promega
Corp., Madison, WI) was used to measure luciferase activity. To estimate agarose
bead delivery, 30 BMP9 beads were sequentially placed in 1 ml of assay media for 6,
18 and 48 h and luciferase activity was measured. BMP9 released from the beads
was determined by comparison to a BMP9 standard response curve. All mea-
surements were carried out in triplicate.
For adult studies, digit amputations were carried out on 2–3-month-old mice as
previously described1. The amputation wound was immediately closed with a
ventral skin flap that included the P3 fat pad and sealed with Dermabond (Ethicon,
Somerville, NJ). BMP treatment was performed using a sol–gel silica-based glass
with embedded growth factor implanted between the bone stump and distal skin as
previously described5. Amputated digits received a single treatment of BMP9 (250
ng) on 9 days post amputation (9 DPA) and digits were analyzed 7 (16 DPA) and
14 (23 DPA) days later. All studies comply with relevant ethical regulations for
animal testing and research, and received ethical approval by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees at Tulane University and Texas A&M
University.
Tissue processing. Digits were fixed in buffered zinc formalin (Z-Fix, Anatech
Ltd, Battle Creek, MI; overnight at room temperature) for histology and immu-
nohistochemistry, or 4% paraformaldehyde (4 oC, overnight) for section in situ
hybridization. Decalcification was carried out using Decalcifier I (Surgipath, Leica
Biosystems, Richmond, IL). Tissues were processed for paraffin histology as pre-
viously described47 and stained with Mallory Trichrome48 or Picro-sirius red49.
BrdU labeling to identify proliferating cells was performed as previously described8.
For section in situ hybridization, antisense riboprobes were generated using the
Digoxigenin-UTP transcription labeling Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as previously
described47. The following complementary DNA fragments were used to generate
antisense riboprobes: Bmp9 (707 bp), Prg4 (600 bp), Ucma (363 bp), Fmod (497
bp), Type II Collagen (Col2a1, 500 bp), Type X Collagen (Col10a1, 650 bp) and Sox9
(586 bp). The 2–5 digit samples were analyzed for each time point. Control studies
included BSA-treated amputated digits or stage-matched unamputated digits.
Sections were either not counterstained or stained with Alizarin Red (Sigma-
Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO) and mounted with Permount Mounting Medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Imaging of histological and in situ
hybridization sections was performed using the Olympus BX60 microscope and
DP72 camera, with the DP2-BSW software (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley,
PA). For immunohistochemical staining, paraffin sections were deparaffinized and
rinsed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween® 20 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Antigen
retrieval was performed using heat (90 oC, 20 min, pH 6 citrate buffer) or protei-
nase K (10 mg/ml, 27 oC, 12 min, Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Sections were incubated
in a blocking solution (1 h, room temperature, Dako) followed by primary antibody
(overnight, 4 oC) and secondary antibody (45 min, room temperature). Antibody
details are as follows: Collagen II: mouse anti-ColII (Acris Antibodies, San Diego,
CA; AF5710, 1:200 dilution), proteinase K, Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; AF11004, 1:500 dilution); Collagen
X: rabbit anti-ColX (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; AB58632, 1:500 dilution), proteinase
K, Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA; A11008, 1:500 dilution); Aggrecan: rabbit anti-Acan (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA; AB1031, 1:300 dilution), heat retrieval, Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; A11008, 1:500 dilution); Dou-
blecortin: rabbit anti-Dcx (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; AB207175, 1:200 dilution),
heat retrieval, Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invi-
trogen, Carlsbad, CA; A11008, 1:500 dilution); Sox9: rabbit anti-Sox9 (Abcam;
AB185966, 1:500 dilution), heat retrieval, Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Invitrogen; A11008, 1:500 dilution). Immunostained sections
were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Slide
imaging was performed with the Olympus BX61 fluorescence deconvolution
microscope and Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver,
CO).
Microcomputed tomography scans and image processing. To screen for ele-
ment regeneration after BMP treatment, P2 digits were scanned at PN28, PN35 or
PN42 using the vivaCT 40 (SCANCO Medical, Wayne, PA) as previously descri-
bed50. Digit samples were scanned using high-resolution settings (voxel size 10.5 μm
and energy of 55 kVp; 1000 projections per 180o captured at 380 msec using con-
tinuous rotation). µCT files were saved as a dicom image stack, and subsequently
uploaded to ImageJ to generate images. The BoneJ51 (Version 1.2.1) Optimized
Threshold Plugin for ImageJ was used to create three-dimensional renderings. The
Mann–Whitney test was used to determine statistical significance for induced
-cavity formation after BSA, BMP9, or BMP2+BMP9 treatment. Statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
