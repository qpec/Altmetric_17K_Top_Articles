ABSTRACT 
We aimed to (1) report energy availability (EA), metabolic/reproductive function, bone mineral 
density (BMD) and injury/illness rates in national/world-class female and male distance-
athletes; and (2) investigate the robustness of various diagnostic criteria from the Female 
Athlete Triad (Triad), Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q) and 
Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) tools to identify risks associated with low EA. 
Athletes were distinguished according to benchmarks of reproductive function (amenorrheic 
[n=13] vs eumenorrheic [n=22]; low [lowest quartile of reference range, n=10] vs normal 
testosterone [n=14]) and EA calculated from 7-day food and training diaries (< or >30 kcal.kg-
1FFM). Sex hormones (p<0.001), triiodothyronine (p<0.05) and BMD (females, p<0.05) were 
significantly lower in amenorrheic (37%) and low testosterone (40%; 15.1±3.0 nmol/L-1) 
athletes and bone injuries were ~4.5-fold more prevalent in amenorrheic (ES=0.85; large) and 
low testosterone (ES=0.52; moderate) groups compared to others. Categorization of females 
and males using Triad or RED-S tools revealed that higher risk groups had significantly lower 
T3 (female and male Triad and RED-S:p<0.05) and higher number of all-time fractures (male 
Triad:p<0.001; male RED-S and female Triad:p<0.01) as well as non-significant but markedly 
(up to 10-fold) higher number of training days lost to bone injuries during the preceding year. 
Based on the cross-sectional analysis, current reproductive function (questionnaires/blood 
hormone concentrations) appears to provide a more objective and accurate marker of optimal 
energy for health than the more error-prone and time-consuming dietary and training estimation 
of EA. This study also offers novel findings that athlete health is associated with EA indices.

INTRODUCTION 
Low energy availability (EA) is the failure of athletes to consume sufficient energy to 
cover the energy cost of exercise as well as energy required for optimal metabolic function and 
health (Loucks et al., 2011).  Low EA has been reported in both female (Melin et al., 2015) and 
male (Viner et al., 2015) endurance athletes and is emerging as one of the most significant 
factors associated with athlete illness/injury (Tenforde et al., 2017). Original recognition of this 
syndrome in females, the Female Athlete Triad (Triad), identified the inter-relatedness of low 
EA, menstrual dysfunction and poor bone health (Nattiv et al., 1994; Joy et al., 2014). Indeed, 
there is ample evidence of the high prevalence (63%, Melin et al., 2015) and negative effects 
of low EA on hormonal function (Loucks & Thuma, 2003), bone health (Ihle & Loucks, 2004) 
and injury risk (Tenforde et al., 2017) in females. On the contrary, until recently, research on 
low EA in male athletes was lacking almost completely. Indeed, it was not until 2014, when 
the concept of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) was introduced to include both 
sexes and a broader spectrum of health and performance-related concerns that the existence of 
low EA in males was acknowledged (Mountjoy et al., 2014). Since then, several reports have 
confirmed that male athletes do indeed suffer from the negative consequences of low EA 
(Tenforde et al., 2016), including low testosterone (Gomez-Merino et al., 2002) and metabolic 
hormone (Koehler et al., 2016) levels, albeit likely at a lower threshold than females (20-25 
kcal·kg FFM·day-1, Fagerberg, 2017). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that despite significant 
reductions (10-40%) in testosterone levels due to low EA (Tenforde et al., 2016) have been 
observed, the values have remained within the normal clinical range. This is important as the 
use of non-athlete clinical cut-off values in assessing suppressed reproductive function in male 
athletes may lack sensitivity, at least based on current literature.  
Despite growing awareness of the causes and outcomes of low EA, several issues 
related to its detection and practical management remain difficult.  This includes the lack of a

single sensitive tool to diagnose the phenomenon, particularly in field settings and with 
application to male athletes.  We studied two cohorts of national to world-class distance female 
and male athletes with two primary purposes: (1) to provide a cross-sectional report on 
measurements of EA, metabolic and reproductive hormonal function, bone mineral density 
(BMD), injury/illness rates and body composition during a high-volume/intensity pre-
competition training period; and (2) to investigate the robustness of risk-assessment of the 
Triad and RED-S diagnostic tools to identify athletes with these symptoms typically associated 
with low EA.  
METHODS 
Subjects 
We used word of mouth and online advertisements to recruit national to world-class 
female and male middle- and long-distance runners and race walkers from the Finnish Athletics 
Federation (FIN; n=12 females and 10 males, at sea-level) as well as Athletics Canada, 
Australia and United States runners/race walkers at altitude in Flagstaff, Arizona (FLAG; n=27 
females and 21 males).  Inclusion criteria were: 18–40 years, events from 800 m-50 km walk, 
International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) score within the last 2 years of ≥880 
(FIN; corresponding to 14:37.17 and 17:36.39 min for 5000 m for males and females, 
respectively) or ≥1050 (FLAG; 13:45.20 min and 16:00.04 min for 5000 m, respectively). 
Participants were informed about the study design before signing an informed consent. The 
studies were approved by the ethics committees of Helsinki University Hospital and University 
of Helsinki (BMD) and University of Jyvaskyla (other measurements). Study drop-outs 
included 11 participants (FIN: n=1, poor compliance (insufficient detail); FLAG: n=5, poor 
compliance, n=5 injuries during the recording week).

Study design 
In a cross-sectional study design, we examined EA via 7-day EI (via dietary recording) 
and EEE (via training recording), metabolic and reproductive hormonal function, BMD (via 
Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)), injury and illness rates and body composition of 
identified endurance athletes during sea-level pre-competition training in FIN during Spring 
2015 (5% Olympians) and during a pre-competition altitude training camp in FLAG during 
Spring 2016 (27% Olympians).   
Specifically, we divided female and male athletes into groups of apparently sub-optimal 
and normal EA status based on two different criteria: 1) an acute objective measure of 
reproductive hormone function/menstrual status coupled with assessments using Triad and 
RED-S tools or 2) a single time-span calculation of EA from food (energy intake; EI) and 
training (exercise energy expenditure; EEE) diaries over 7-days.   
Blood samples 
Fasted blood samples were obtained from an antecubital vein for analysis of insulin, 
testosterone (TES, males), estradiol (E2, females), triiodothyronine (T3), and insulin-like 
growth-factor-1 (IGF-1). FIN blood samples were drawn into a 5ml Vacuette gel serum tube 
(Greiner-Bio-One GmbH, Kremsmünster, Austria) and centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min to 
collect serum; this was frozen at -20⁰C, before the measurement of IGF-1, E2, TES and insulin 
by chemiluminometric immunological analysis and T3 by electrochemiluminescence 
(Immulite 2000 XPi analysator, Siemens Healthcare, United Kingdom). The assay sensitivities 
were 0.5 nmol·L-1 (TES), 0.26 nmol·L-1 (IGF-1), 2 mIU·L-1 (insulin), 55 pmol·L-1 (E2) and 0.6 
pmol·L-1 (T3). Reliability (CV) for between-day measurements was 9.1% (TES), 5.4% (IGF-
1), 5.9% (insulin), 6.7% (E2), and 7.2% (T3). Eumenorrheic (EUM) females were measured

on days 3-7 during the follicular phase during a hard training period. Males and amenorrheic 
(AME) females were measured on an arbitrary day during a typical training week. 
FLAG blood samples were collected into 8.5 mL SST gel tubes (BD Vacutainer, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and centrifuged at 3400 rpm. Ferritin, insulin, T3, TES and E2 were 
measured via electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method and IGF-1 was measured via 
immunochemiluminometric assay. The samples were collected at ~day 3 of altitude exposure. 
The menstrual phase was not controlled, but was taken into account during data analysis.  
Body composition and BMD 
Body composition and BMD (whole body, femoral neck, lumbar spine) were measured 
in an overnight fasted state via DXA (FIN: GE Lunar Prodigy Advance; FLAG: GE Lunar 
DPX-IQ), according to standardized protocols for body composition as recommended by Nana 
et al. (2015) and for BMD as recommended by The International Society for Clinical 
Densitometry (ISCD, 2017).  
Food and training logs 
Food and training diaries were recorded during the second week at FLAG and 
immediately after laboratory tests in FIN over a 7-day period.  The principal investigator 
analyzed all dietary records (FIN: Nutri-Flow® software, Flow-Team, Oulu, Finland; FLAG: 
ESHA Food Processor software, Oregon, US, 2016). Data collection protocols and methods of 
estimating EI (a combination of weighed and household measure dietary records) have been 
described in detail in (Heikura et al. in press) while the process of calculating EA following a 
field-based approach has been explained in Table 5.  
Questionnaires  
Female participants completed the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire 
(LEAF-Q, Melin et al., 2014) which was also used to assess self-reported amenorrhea. To

examine the differences between subgroups, cumulative risk scores for Triad (Cumulative Risk 
Assessment Tool, Joy et al., 2014) and RED-S (Mountjoy et al., 2014) were calculated. The 
Triad tool was applied for males by replacing amenorrhea with low TES: values within the 
lowest quartile of clinical range (total testosterone: range of 9-38 nmol/L (Finland)); males 
with low TES scored 1 point, while males with normal TES scored 0 points. The use of the 
lowest quartile for TES values was chosen due to clear evidence that although low EA is 
associated with significant reductions in testosterone values have remained within the normal 
non-athlete clinical range (Tenforde et al., 2016); therefore, a subclinical threshold of low TES 
may be more appropriate in identifying LEA in elite endurance athletes. Athletes were grouped 
according to the Triad scores as low (0-1 points), moderate (2-5 points) or high (≥6 points) 
Triad risk score based on Joy et al. (2014). RED-S scoring system was applied to include the 
following conditions: low EA (<30 kcal·kg FFM·day-1), amenorrhea (females) or low TES 
(males), BMD z-score <-1.0, and a history of one or more stress fractures associated with low 
EA and/or hormonal dysfunction (see above). The presence of each condition was scored as 1 
point, while absence of any condition was scored as 0. The scores of all conditions were added 
together to form a RED-S score, and athletes were grouped as having low (0-1 points), 
moderate (2 points) or high (≥3 points) RED-S risk score. All participants answered an informal 
questionnaire on injury/illness history during the preceding 12 months (questions assessed type 
of illness/injury and days of absence from running training due to each incident) and all-time 
history of bone-related injuries (number and type of bone-related injuries during the entire 
athletic career). 
Statistical analysis 
Pooled-data statistical were conducted using SPSS Statistics 22 (INM, Armonk, New 
York, USA).  Data were assessed via Shapiro-Wilk goodness-of-fit test and non-parametric

tests were used with non-normally distributed data. Females and males were divided into 
subgroups based on EA (cut-off: 30 kcal·kg FFM·day-1, Loucks et al., 2011) and reproductive 
function (amenorrhea: absence of ≥3 consecutive menses, Mountjoy et al., 2014 vs 
eumenorrhea for females, and low TES vs normal TES for males.  
Differences and/or correlation analysis in body composition, dietary intakes, EA, BMD, 
injury/illness rates and blood measures between sexes, subgroups and cohorts were analyzed 
with either Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA or Pearson’s correlation coefficient (normally 
distributed data) or Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test or Spearman’s correlation (non-
normally distributed data).  BMD was quantified via: Z>-1, normal BMD; Z< -1, a trend for 
low BMD; Z<-2, clinically low BMD (Torstveit & Sundgot-Borgen, 2005). Analysis of 
covariance was applied to FLAG females for menstrual cycle phases, with E2 as a covariate, 
which was non-significant (p>0.05). Therefore, we were confident that t-tests were reflective 
of true differences. 
Data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD), with significance set to p<0.05. 
Differences between-sexes and within-sexes are expressed as Cohen’s effect sizes (ES; 
Hopkins et al., 2009), with ES threshold values of <0.2 (trivial), 0.2-0.5 (small), 0.5-0.8 
(moderate) and >0.8 (large).  
RESULTS 
Tables 1 and 2 summarize body composition, training/performance status and dietary 
intake from the pooled dataset of 59 athletes, comparing sub-groups of males and females based 
on EA and reproductive status, while these sub-groups are examined in Tables 3 and 4 in terms 
of metabolic and health parameters.

Reproductive/metabolic function, bone health and injury/illness rates 
Overall, 37% of females were amenorrheic (FIN: 50%; FLAG: 30%). Forty percent of 
males (FIN: 55%; FLAG: 33%) were low TES, while none were clinically low (<9 nmol/L). 
FLAG females had higher spine, left and right femur Z-scores (p=0.024, d=0.084; p=0.022, 
d=0.85; p=0.041, d=0.75, respectively), higher IAAF scores (p=0.002, d=1.15) and higher T3 
(p<0.001, d=2.59) and insulin (p=0.036, d=0.81) concentrations than FIN females. Number of 
days missed training due to bone injuries was 2-fold greater in FIN vs FLAG females (25±41 
vs 12±23 days, p=0.33, d=0.39 respectively) and 5-fold greater in FIN vs FLAG males (10±20 
vs 2±8 days, p=0.28, d=0.53 respectively). Similarly, FLAG males had higher values for T3 
concentrations (p<0.001, d=2.33), EA (p=0.047, d=0.85), reported intakes of energy (p=0.032, 
d=0.93) and CHO (p<0.001, d=1.55) and IAAF scores (p<0.001, d=0.91) than FIN males. 
Conversely, FLAG males had lower whole-body BMD than FIN males (p<0.001, d=2.13). 
Compared with eumenorrheic females, amenorrheic females had lower E2, T3 and BMD and 
higher LEAF-Q scores, while low TES in males was associated with low T3 (Table 3). On the 
contrary, apart from TES values in males, there were no differences in hormone concentrations 
or BMD (Table 4) between low and moderate EA groups of either sex. 
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of 0, 1, and ≥2 career stress fractures amenorrheic and 
eumenorrheic females (1.46±1.27 vs 1.00±1.38 SF’s, respectively, p=0.26, d=0.41), and in low 
vs normal TES males (2.10±2.10 vs 0.50±0.86 SF’s, respectively, p=0.042, d=1.01). Effect 
size calculations showed that amenorrheic and low TES athletes had 4.5 times more training 
absences due to bone injuries compared to others (Table 3).  
Correlations  
In females, whole-body BMD correlated negatively with LEAF-Q score (r=-.410, 
p=0.015). In males, correlations were found between all-time fracture history and TES (r=-

.485, p=0.016). In all athletes pooled, both Triad score (r=-.338, p=0.009) and RED-S criteria 
(r=-.396, p=0.002) correlated negatively with T3 and positively with all-time fracture history 
(r=.566, p<0.001 and r=.328, p=0.011, respectively) and negatively with spine Z score (r=-
.263, p=0.044 and r=-.323, p=0.013, respectively). 
Triad and RED-S risk assessment 
Athletes were scored based on available Triad criteria. Triad symptoms were absent in 
34% of females, while 34%, 26% and 6% presented with one, two and three Triad conditions, 
respectively; this was even higher in amenorrheic females.  Amenorrheic females had a 
significantly higher cumulative risk score for the Triad compared to eumenorrheic females 
(5.2±1.9 vs 1.7±1.4 points; p<0.001, d=2.10). The same was true for low vs moderate EA 
females (4.4±2.3 vs 2.4±2.1 points; p=0.027, d=0.91). Of all females pooled, 31%, 51% and 
17% were classified into low-, moderate- and high-risk categories, respectively. Low TES 
males had higher adapted Triad scores compared to normal TES males (2.0±1.1 vs 0.1±0.4 
points; p=0.009, d=1.43). Similarly, males with low EA had higher scores than males with 
moderate EA (2.8±0.4 vs 0.6±0.8 points; p<0.001, d=3.00). Of males, 63% were classified into 
low and 37% into moderate risk categories. Females had higher scores than males (3.0±2.3 vs 
1.2±1.2; p<0.001, d=1.03). Based on Triad risk categories, T3 levels in females (3.0±0.5 vs 
3.5±0.7 vs 2.7±0.4 pmol·L-1, low, moderate and high risk groups, respectively; p=0.021 
between moderate and high) and in males (4.0±0.6 vs 3.4±0.7 pmol·L-1, low and moderate risk 
groups, respectively; p=0.032) were significantly lower and the number of all-time fractures in 
females (0.3±0.5 vs 1.4±1.4 vs 2.2±1.3 fractures, low, moderate and high risk groups, 
respectively; p=0.013 between low and high) and in males (0.3±0.5 vs 2.7±1.9 fractures, low 
and moderate risk groups, respectively; p<0.001) significantly higher in higher score groups.

injuries in the preceding year was markedly higher in both females (3±11 vs 18±34 vs 34±38 
days, low, moderate and high risk groups, respectively; p=0.13) and males (2±8 vs 10±20 days, 
low and moderate risk groups, respectively; p=0.23) with higher risk scores. 
In addition, RED-S scoring system was used to score athletes based on symptoms of 
low EA. Differences in RED-S scores were significant between amenorrheic and eumenorrheic 
females (2.4±0.8 vs 0.5±0.7; p<0.001, d=2.53) and between low vs moderate EA females 
(2.2±0.9 vs 0.7±1.0; p=0.001, d=1.58). Likewise, differences between low and moderate TES 
males (2.0±1.2 vs 0.6±0.8; p<0.001, d=2.62) and between low and moderate EA males (2.7±0.8 
vs 0.3±0.5; p<0.001, d=3.45) were significant. The division resulted in 43%, 43% and 14% of 
females and 50%, 29% and 21% of males classified into low, moderate and high RED-S risk 
categories, respectively. Assessment of RED-S risk categories did not find significant 
differences in T3 levels or injury indices in females, whereas in males T3 concentrations 
(4.0±0.5 vs 4.0±0.8 vs 3.1±0.4 pmol·L-1, low, moderate and high risk groups, respectively;

(0.6±0.9 vs 0.7±1.3 vs 3.2±2.2 fractures, low, moderate and high risk groups, respectively; 
p=0.021 low vs high, p=0.039 moderate vs high) significantly higher in higher score groups. 
In addition, although not statistically significant, the number of training days lost due to bone 
injuries in the preceding year was markedly higher in both females (7±20 vs 15±27 vs 48±50 
days, low, moderate and high risk groups, respectively; p=0.08) and males (3±9 vs 0 vs 18±25

DISCUSSION 
This is the first study to examine EA, metabolic and reproductive hormonal function, 
BMD, injury and illness rates and dietary characteristics in a large cohort (n=59) of national to 
world-class (19% were Olympians) female and male distance athletes during a high load pre-

competition training block.  We divided athletes into subgroups based on reproductive function 
(menstrual status and TES levels) as well as a single time-point assessment of EA status (a 
cutoff point of 30 kcal·kg FFM·day-1). Around 40% of females and males were amenorrheic or 
had low TES, respectively. These athletes had significantly lower sex hormone and T3 
concentrations and 4.5 times greater incidence of bone injuries compared to eumenorrheic 
females and males with normal testosterone levels.  We found that the Triad and RED-S tools 
were able to detect symptoms of impaired endocrine-metabolic function and bone health (all-
time fractures) in both sexes with better accuracy than the assessment of EA based on food and 
training logs.   
Seminal work by Loucks and colleagues, within the standardized conditions of the 
laboratory, showed that low EA is the primary reason for the suppression of the metabolic and 
reproductive axis in females. These sophisticated studies established that below EA levels of 
~30 kcal·kg FFM·day-1 the likelihood of suppression of female reproductive and metabolic 
hormones increases (Loucks & Callister, 1993; Loucks & Heath, 1994). Emerging data suggest 
that males, too, incur reciprocal effects (Tenforde et al., 2016), albeit at a lower EA threshold 
(between 20-25 kcal·kg FFM·day-1: Fagerberg, 2017; Koehler et al., 2016). Such perturbations 
can have serious effects on bone (Mountjoy et al., 2014; Tenforde et al., 2015) and other aspects 
of physiological function and performance (Mountjoy et al., 2014).  
Although the negative effects of low EA on hormonal function are robustly detected in 
controlled laboratory settings, our study clearly demonstrates that the real-world measurement 
of EA, via dietary and exercise recording, is challenging and lacking in sensitivity as diagnostic 
tool for the presence of low EA.  Indeed, EA is assessed indirectly, based on self-reported 
records of food intake and estimates of energy expenditure.  These techniques have inherent 
problems related to reliability and validity, and may significantly skew EA calculations to both

under/overestimate the true value during the short time period of assessment (Schoeller, 1995; 
Hills et al., 2014). For example, self-reporting resulted in an underestimation of EI by 5-21% 
(Stubbs et al., 2014), whereas the use of MET’s overestimated REE by 20% (Byrne et al., 
2005), and wearable devices underestimated EE by ~100-600kcal/day (Murakami et al., 2016), 
albeit in non-athlete populations. Furthermore, there is no reference time-frame over which a 
dietary/exercise assessment should be conducted, nor any standardized protocols by which any 
of the components should be measured. Although an EA assessment has appeal as apparently 
low-cost, low-technology and non-invasive test, in reality, it carries a large burden in terms of 
athlete compliance and practitioner time.  Cross-sectional estimates of low EA in athletes vary 
from 51 to 63% (Koehler et al., 2013; Melin et al., 2014; Melin et al., 2015).  In our study, low 
EA (based on a cut-off of 30 kcal·kg-1 FFM·day-1) was found in 25% of male and 31% of 
female athletes but was poorly correlated with factors known to be affected by low EA, 
including reproductive, metabolic and bone health (Table 4). Indeed, interestingly, the only 
difference between EA groups was a finding of lower TES levels in males with low EA. Despite 
the challenges associated with EA assessment, we are confident that the rigorous control 
applied to obtain high quality dietary/training data allowed us to estimate EA to a sufficient 
detail. Our findings are in line with previous studies (Koehler et al., 2013; Melin et al., 2014) 
who failed to find an association between dietary EA and physiological markers of low EA in 
females. However we also included males in our analysis, and indeed showed a significant 
difference between males who had low vs moderate EA. While interesting, given no differences 
were found in other markers of EA between male EA groups, whether this finding is of 
relevance remains to be seen.  Furthermore, as in our study, the EA assessment may occur at a 
different time point (and, in the case of FLAG, a different environment), to the scenarios in 
which poor match between energy intake and exercise energy expenditure may have caused 
health issues. Finally, other dietary factors often found in concert with low EA may have an

independent or additive contribution to the outcomes (Reed et al., 2011). Indeed, in line with 
previous studies Melin et al. (2016) who found significantly higher fibre intakes in oligo-
amenorrheic vs eumenorrheic females, we noted a higher fiber intake reported by our 
amenorrheic females than their eumenorrheic conterparts. 
Instead, qualitative screening tools (LEAF-Q, RED-S and Triad risk assessment tools) 
and/or quantitative measurements of reproductive function (blood reproductive and metabolic 
hormones, BMD, resting metabolic rate), may provide a better representation of an individual’s 
longer-term EA, rather than just a snap-shot, and may be a more sensitive way to diagnose low 
EA. Indeed, based on the current cross-sectional analysis, it appears that current reproductive 
function provides an equally good, but more objective marker of appropriate energy support 
for overall health: we found lower levels of T3, sex hormones and BMD (females) in 
amenorrheic females and low TES males compared to others. Furthermore, when we divided 
athletes into low, moderate and high risk groups based on available Triad Cumulative Risk 
Assessment Tool (Joy et al., 2014) and a modified version of the RED-S consensus paper 
(Mountjoy et al., 2014), we found significantly lower T3 concentrations and up to 9-fold higher 
number of all-time fractures in higher risk groups of both female and male athletes. For 
females, the Triad tool seemed to work better, while in males, both tools produced similar 
outcomes. In addition, although not significantly different, both tools showed up to 10-times 
higher frequency of lost training days due to bone injuries in the preceding year in the higher 
risk groups.  
The prevalence of amenorrhea (37%) in the current study was in line with some 
(Barrack et al., 2014; Gibbs et al., 2014) but not all (Melin et al., 2014; Pollock et al., 2010) 
previous studies, whereas, low BMD (17% in females, 0% in males) was significantly less than 
previously reported in females (Melin et al., 2014; Pollock et al., 2010).  Interestingly, our 
cohort of elite athletes were of higher caliber than previously reported in the literature (27%

Olympians in FLAG), thus various differences in cohort rates of amenorrhea or BMD may not 
be surprising. While the use of menstrual status is probably one of the best markers of long-
term EA, the use of oral contraceptives may mask the equation. In case of the use of oral 
contraceptives, perhaps other signs of chronic low EA, including low BMD, increased 
incidence of bone related injuries, and low metabolic hormone concentrations, could be used 
to detect low EA in these athletes. Interestingly, low testosterone males had poorer health, 
despite being within the reference range. Indeed, the clinical cut-offs may not be applicable for 
elite athletes in assessing RED-S. The available literature lacks a more systematic analysis of 
the prevalence of these issues in male athletes. 
Our findings of a significantly higher LEAF-Q score (12.8 vs 8.3 points) in amenorrheic 
vs eumenorrheic females support the use of the LEAF-Q to assess increased risk of the Triad 
(Melin et al., 2014).  We detected significant differences in the Triad and RED-S scores 
between the reproductive subgroups by categorizing athletes based on the Triad (Joy et al., 
2014) and RED-S (Mountjoy et al., 2014) tools. This supports the work of Tenforde and 
colleagues (2017) who classified 239 amenorrheic/oligomenorrheic collegiate females into 
low- (71%), moderate- (25%) and high-risk (4%) categories based on the Triad tool, and found 
that moderate and high-risk category athletes were twice and nearly four times more likely to 
sustain a bone injury than low-risk athletes. We noted a higher prevalence of EA-associated 
problems in the lower caliber Finns. Whether this reflects cultural/genetic differences, the 
additional resources afforded to higher caliber athletes that might reduce the risk of problems, 
or the natural selection process by which the healthier athletes progress to higher levels, can’t 
be judged from our data but merits additional investigation.  Future research should focus on 
finding a practical yet valid tool(set) for the assessment of low EA in female and male athletes 
to address this and other themes.

CONCLUSIONS 
A relatively high proportion of national class-elite female and male distance athletes 
showed signs of chronic energy conservation, including amenorrhea (37% of females) and low 
testosterone (40% of males). Amenorrheic females were characterized by lower BMD, sex 
hormone and T3 concentrations, and 4.5-fold higher rates of injury, compared to eumenorrheic 
females. Low TES males showed lower T3 concentrations, lower EA and 4.5-fold higher rates 
of injury compared to males with normal TES. The assessment of risk scores based on Triad 
and RED-S criteria revealed lower T3 concentrations and higher number of all-time fractures 
in both female and male athletes with higher risk scores. Our findings suggest that assessing 
physiological symptoms of low EA (hormone concentrations, menstrual function, bone 
density) or using LEAF-Q, Triad and RED-S screening tools provides a better assessment of 
the overall health status of an individual than a snapshot of current EA.

Table 5. Method for estimating energy availability (EA) and each of its components based on food and 
training records (field-based approach). 
 
Energy availability (EA) equation 
EI – EEE 
FFM 
Energy intake (EI) 
 
Estimate total daily EI (kcal/d) via food records 
 
Usually 4 to 7-day food records provide the best result (in terms of 
compliance and reflection of real-life dietary habits) 
 
Prefer weighed food records over more vague estimations of 
portion sizes 
 
Educate the athlete to minimize errors in recording 
 
Analyze food records with a dietary analysis software to get an 
estimate of daily EI 
Exercise energy expenditure (EEE) 
and 
Resting energy expenditure (REE) 
REE 
 
Estimate REE by using the Cunningham equation (Cunningham, 
1991)  
 
Divide total daily REE by 24h to yield hourly REE 
EEE 
 
Estimate EEE via training diaries, where information on exercise 
mode, duration, intensity (heart rate or ratings of perceived 
exertion) is included 
 
Assign each training session or its parts a metabolic equivalent 
(METs; Ainsworth et al., 2000) value that best corresponds to the 
type and intensity of that activity  
 
Multiply the MET for each training session/part of the by the 
duration of the session or part of that session to yield MET hours 
 
Multiply MET hours by the hourly REE to yield total EEE (tEEE) 
 
Subtract REE that would have occurred regardless of exercise from 
tEEE so that only the additional energy cost of exercise is included 
in the EEE 
 
Use this EEE value as part of the equation provided above 
Fat-free mass (FFM) 
FFM can be obtained via Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry or air 
displacement plethysmography (BodPod) provided 'best practice' 
conditions for body composition analysis are utilised. Alternatively 
well standardised skinfold meausures or bioelectrical impedence 
analysis may be used. 
Interpretation of EA values 
The following cutoffs have been established (Loucks et al., 2011): 
Low EA: EA <30 kcal·kg FFM·day-1 
Moderate EA: EA 30-45 kcal·kg FFM·day-1  
Optimal EA: EA >45 kcal·kg FFM·day-1
