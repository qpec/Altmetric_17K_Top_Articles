The opioid epidemic affects multiple segments of the U.S. 
population (1). Occupational patterns might be critical to 
understanding the epidemic. Opioids are often prescribed 
for specific types of work-related injuries, which vary by 
occupation* (2). CDC used mortality data from the National 
Occupational Mortality Surveillance (NOMS) system to exam-
ine unintentional or undetermined drug overdose mortality 
within 26 occupation groups. This study included data from 
the 21 U.S. states participating in NOMS during 2007–2012.† 
Drug overdose mortality was compared with total mortality 
using proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) indirectly stan-
dardized for age, sex, race, year, and state. Mortality patterns 
specific to opioid-related overdose deaths were also assessed. 
Construction occupations had the highest PMRs for drug 
overdose deaths and for both heroin-related and prescription 
opioid–related overdose deaths. The occupation groups with 
the highest PMRs from methadone, natural and semisynthetic 
opioids, and synthetic opioids other than methadone were 
construction, extraction (e.g., mining, oil and gas extraction), 
and health care practitioners. The workplace is an integral part 
of life for the majority of the adult U.S. population; incorpo-
rating workplace research and interventions likely will benefit 
the opioid epidemic response.
NOMS is a population-based surveillance system and a 
collaborative effort between state vital statistics offices and 
CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
Through data sharing agreements with NIOSH, all participat-
ing states, or NCHS under states’ direction, share selected data 
from their death certificates, including the decedent’s usual 
industry and occupation, coded to the U.S. Census industry 
and occupation codes. This analysis includes 4,024,086 deaths

contributed ≥1 year of data† to NOMS during 2007–2012.§
International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10) codes for underlying cause of death were used to 
identify unintentional (X40–X44) and undetermined (Y10–
Y14) drug overdose deaths. Among drug overdose deaths, 
the specific type of opioid was indicated by the following 
ICD-10 multiple cause of deaths codes: T40.1 (heroin) and 
T40.2–T40.4 (prescription opioids [i.e., T40.2, natural and 
semisynthetic opioids; T40.3, methadone; and T40.4, syn-
thetic opioids other than methadone]).¶ Deaths that involved 
multiple opioid types were included in multiple categories.
Usual occupation, recorded as free-text on the death cer-
tificate, was coded to 1990 or 2000 U.S. Census occupation 
codes** by NIOSH or by the state. A crosswalk based on 
U.S. Census data was used to convert the 1990 U.S. Census 
occupation codes to the 2000 U.S. Census occupation codes.†† 
Occupation codes were binned into 26 groups based on job 
duties.§§ For each outcome, the proportion of deaths among 
each occupation group was compared with the proportion of 
deaths among all occupations combined using PMRs indirectly 
standardized by age, sex, race, calendar year, and state of occur-
rence. A PMR >1.00 indicated that the proportion of deaths 
within that occupation group is higher than the proportion of 
deaths among all occupation groups combined. Corresponding 
95% confidence intervals were calculated.
 § 2012 is the most recent year for which NOMS data are available. NOMS is 
the largest source of U.S. population-level mortality data that contains 
occupation and industry information. Only 21 states contributed data to 
NOMS during the study period.
 ¶ From 2013 to 2014, a large increase in illicitly manufactured fentanyl occurred. 
Within the study period, this category is mostly recording information about 
pharmaceutical synthetic opioids.

The analysis identified 57,810 drug overdose deaths within 
the study population (1.4% of the 4,024,086 deaths). The 
majority of drug overdose deaths were among persons who 
were male (61.8%), white (89.8%), and aged 45–54 years 
(30.1%) or 35–44 years (24.1%).¶¶ PMRs from drug overdose 
were significantly above 1.00 for the following six occupation 
groups: 1) construction (1.25); 2) extraction (1.16); 3) food 
preparation and serving (1.11); 4) health care practitioners 
and technical (1.16); 5) health care support (1.18); and 6) 
personal care and service (1.10) (Table 1). PMRs from drug 
overdose were also significantly elevated among deaths where 
the usual occupation was unpaid/unemployed (1.10)*** or 
unknown (1.31).††† For each specific opioid type, signifi-
cantly elevated PMRs were generally observed only for those 
occupation groups that also had a significantly elevated PMR 
for drug overdose overall (Table 1) (Table 2). The only two 
exceptions were the arts, design, entertainment, sports, and 
media occupation group and the building and grounds clean-
ing and maintenance occupation group. For these groups, the 
proportion of drug overdose deaths among the two occupation 
groups was similar to the proportion of drug overdose deaths 
overall (i.e., PMR approximately = 1.00), whereas the propor-
tional distribution of specific drugs involved in an overdose 
was different,§§§ with heroin-involved overdose deaths higher 
than expected (Table 1). The highest PMRs for methadone, 
natural and semisynthetic opioids, and synthetic opioids were 
in the construction (1.34), extraction (1.39), and healthcare 
practitioner (1.81) occupation groups, respectively.
Because the PMRs for all opioid types within the construc-
tion occupation group were elevated, a subanalysis further 
examined opioid-related deaths in this group. The analysis 
identified 7,402 drug overdose deaths among persons aged 
≥18 years within the construction occupation group. The 
majority of decedents were male (96.7%), white (92.6%), 
and aged 45–54 years (30.4%) or 35–44 years (26.9%).¶¶¶

 *** Homemaker (not working on a farm), volunteer, or student.
 ††† This category includes deaths with insufficient information available on the 
death certificate to apply a U.S. Census occupation code or for which the 
usual occupation field was left blank.
 §§§ The proportional distribution of drugs (i.e., the proportion of total drug 
overdoses deaths for each drug type) involved in drug overdose deaths include 
opioids and nonopioids (e.g., cocaine). PMRs are mutually dependent and 
a higher proportion for one cause (e.g., a specific drug) results in a lower 
proportion for another cause. In this analysis, cause-specific outcomes (e.g., 
heroin-related overdose or prescription opioid–related overdose) are not 
independent and are partially overlapping. Decedents might have multiple 
drug types within their system at time of death and therefore counted in 
more than one cause-specific outcome category.
 ¶¶¶ Construction occupation group.
These deaths were examined by the following occupation 
subgroups****: first-line supervisors and managers,†††† con-
struction trade workers (e.g., carpenters, electricians, painters, 
iron and steel workers, operating engineers, and construction 
equipment operators), construction trade helpers, and other 
construction and related workers (e.g., building inspectors, 
hazardous waste workers, and highway maintenance workers). 
PMRs were significantly elevated for all types of opioids within 
the occupation subgroup construction trade workers (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, unintentional and undetermined overdose 
deaths varied by occupation group, with the construction 
group having elevated PMRs for all drug types. Although few 
related studies have been conducted, similar results have been 
observed. In Kentucky (2011) (3) and Ohio (2016) (4), for 
example, overdose deaths varied by industry and occupation 
and were highest among construction workers. Multiyear stud-
ies conducted in two Massachusetts jurisdictions (Barnstable 
County and Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition communi-
ties) found trade workers (e.g., construction, building/grounds 
maintenance, and mechanics) had the largest proportion of 
opioid overdose deaths (37% and 42%, respectively) (5,6). 
Variation was expected because work-related injuries and 
illnesses vary by occupation and industry. In addition, other 
factors that might affect opioid use, such as psychosocial work-
related stress (e.g., job insecurity or high demand/low control 
jobs), socioeconomic standing, and education level, also vary 
by occupation and industry (7–9).
The specific drugs influencing higher than expected propor-
tions of overdose deaths also varied by occupation group. In 
this study, heroin PMRs were highest for the construction; 
food preparation and serving; and arts, design, entertain-
ment, sports, and media occupation groups. Among the drug 
types evaluated, heroin is illicit, whereas among the other 
types, usage is both licit (i.e., prescribed and used as directed) 
and illicit. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health illustrate that self-reported illicit drug use varies by

The variation by occupation group in this study leads 
to speculation about opioid initiation or use and the work 
environment. A single on-the-job injury (e.g., fracture or 
dislocation) or chronic work-related pain (e.g., caused by 
repetitive motion or lifting) might result in a prescription 
for pain medication (2,8). Workers’ compensation data from

might be an important factor in understanding and responding 
to the opioid epidemic.

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, data were analyzed in aggregate, but occupational 
patterns for each drug type might have differed by year. Second, 
NOMS has limited information on the specific circumstances 
of death. It is not known, for example, whether the death 
occurred at work. Death certificates do not state whether 
decedents were employed at their usual job (listed on the death 
certificate), another job, or unemployed at the time of death; 
if the drug use was legal or illegal; or if drug use was initiated 
while decedents were employed at their usual job, another job, 
or before employment. Third, the specific drug involved in 
the drug overdose death might have been misclassified (e.g., 
heroin deaths misclassified as morphine deaths because of 
similar metabolites) or given nonspecific codes (1). Within 
this study, the only drug code listed for one fourth of overdose 
deaths was “other and unspecified drugs” (T50.9 excluding 
T36–T50.8). Outcome misclassification might vary by state 
and year. Fourth, intentional overdose deaths were excluded; 
however, an unknown proportion of undetermined deaths 
might have included homicides or suicides and might therefore 
have resulted in overestimates. In this study, 9.6% of drug 
overdose deaths were of undetermined intent. The distribution 
of overdose deaths by intent and occupation group need to 
be explored. Fifth, PMRs are mutually dependent and cannot 
distinguish whether occupation was associated with increasing 
a specific cause of death, preventing the occurrence of other 
causes of death, or some combination of these effects. Finally, 
only 21 states participated in NOMS during the study period, 
which limits generalizability of the findings.
This study identified occupation groups with a higher 
proportion of drug and opioid-specific overdose mortality 
but was unable to identify specific factors that might have 
led to the observed results. The surveillance data presented 
in this study generated many questions; future studies are 
needed to identify potential work-related factors along the 
causal pathway from drug initiation to overdose mortality 
and to investigate ways of tailoring prevention measures 
to specific occupations. Workplace-specific programs and 
policies to reduce the impact of the opioid epidemic can be 
implemented. Since 2009, a decline in opioid use among 
nonsurgical workers’ compensation claims in 26 states has 
occurred, which is associated with changes to workers’ com-
pensation laws and regulations regarding pain management 
and the prescribing and distribution of opioids, in addition 
to corresponding national and state-level legislative and 
regulatory changes (2). Examples of programs††††† that might 
address both licit and illicit opioids include comprehensive 
drug-free workplace programs, employee assistance programs, 
peer-support networks, and education targeted to employees 
 
††††† The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) provides detailed information on drug-free workplace 
programs, related laws and regulations, and a toolkit for employers (https://
www.samhsa.gov/workplace).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
A majority of the U.S. population participates in the workforce. 
A person’s job affects both physical and psychological well-
being. The opioid epidemic negatively affects workers, work-
places, and employers.
What is added by this report?
During 2007–2012 proportional mortality ratios (PMR) for 
heroin-related overdose deaths (1.46) and methadone-related 
overdose deaths (1.34) were highest for the construction 
occupation group. PMRs for natural and semisynthetic opioids 
were highest for the extraction (1.39) and health care practitio-
ner (1.81) occupation groups.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Identification of occupations associated with drug overdose 
deaths further characterizes the opioid epidemic. Incorporating 
workplace research and targeted interventions might benefit 
the opioid epidemic response.
and employers (3,5,6). Continued evaluation of the effec-
tiveness and impact of these programs and interventions are 
needed to prevent opioid misuse and abuse and to reduce 
opioid-related morbidity and mortality.
