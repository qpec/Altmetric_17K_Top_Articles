Abstract
Understanding how incompletely cleared primary tumors tran-
sition from minimal residual disease (MRD) into treatment-
resistant, immune-invisible recurrences has major clinical signif-
icance. We show here that this transition is mediated through the
subversion of two key elements of innate immunosurveillance. In
the first, the role of TNFa changes from an antitumor effector
against primary tumors into a growth promoter for MRD. Second,
whereas primary tumors induced a natural killer (NK)–mediated
cytokine response characterized by low IL6 and elevated IFNg,
PD-L1hi MRD cells promoted the secretion of IL6 but minimal
IFNg, inhibiting both NK-cell and T-cell surveillance. Tumor
recurrence was promoted by trauma- or infection-like stimuli
inducing VEGF and TNFa, which stimulated the growth of
MRD tumors. Finally, therapies that blocked PD-1, TNFa, or
NK cells delayed or prevented recurrence. These data show
how innate immunosurveillance mechanisms, which control
infection and growth of primary tumors, are exploited by
recurrent, competent tumors and identify therapeutic targets
in patients with MRD known to be at high risk of relapse.

Introduction
Tumor dormancy followed by potentially fatal, aggressive
recurrence represents a major clinical challenge for successful
treatment of malignant disease, as recurrence occurs at times that
cannot be predicted (1–6). Tumor dormancy is the time following
first-line treatment in which a patient is apparently free of detect-
able tumor, but after which local or metastatic recurrence becomes
clinically apparent (2–8). Dormancy results from the balance of
tumor–cell proliferation and death through apoptosis, lack of
vascularization, immunosurveillance (2–5, 9–13), and cancer cell
dormancy and growth arrest (2–4). Dormancy is characterized by
presence of residual tumor cells [minimal residual disease (MRD);
ref. 14] and can last for decades (2, 5, 15–17).
Recurrences are often phenotypically very different from pri-
mary tumors, representing the end product of in vivo selection
against continued sensitivity to first-line treatment (18–28).
Escape from first-line therapy is common, in part, because of the
heterogeneity of tumor populations (29, 30), which include
treatment-resistant subpopulations (31). Understanding the ways
in which recurrent tumors differ from primary tumors would
allow early initiation of rational, targeted second-line therapy.
Identifying triggers that convert MRD into actively proliferating
recurrence would allow more timely screening and early inter-
vention to treat secondary disease (32).
To address these issues, we developed several different preclin-
ical models in which suboptimal first-line treatment induced
complete macroscopic regression, a period of dormancy or MRD,
followed by local recurrence. Thus, treatment of either subcuta-
neous B16 melanoma or TC2 prostate tumors with adoptive T-cell
transfer (21, 33–35), systemic virotherapy (36, 37), VSV-cDNA
immunotherapy (38, 39), or ganciclovir chemotherapy (40–42)
led to apparent tumor clearance (no palpable tumor) for > 40 to
150 days. However, with prolonged follow-up, a proportion of
these animals developed late, aggressive local recurrences, mim-
icking the clinical situation in multiple tumor types (43–45).
Recurrence was associated with elevated expression of several
recurrence-specific antigens that were shared across tumor types,
such as YB-1 and topoisomerase-Iia (TOPO-IIa) (44), as well as
tumor type–specific recurrence antigens (45).
Here, we show that the transition from MRD into actively
proliferating recurrent tumors is mediated through the subversion
of two key elements of innate immunosurveillance of tumors,
recognition by natural killer (NK) cells and response to TNFa.
These data show how the transition from MRD to active recur-
rence is triggered in vivo and how recurrences use innate antitumor
immune effector mechanisms to drive their own expansion and
escape from immunosurveillance. Understanding these mechan-
isms can potentially lead to better treatments that delay or prevent
tumor recurrence.

 (H2-Kb) background] was bred at the Mayo Clinic and expresses
the transgenic T-cell receptor Va2/Vb5 specific for the SIINFEKL
peptide of ovalbumin in the context of MHC class I, H-2Kb as
described previously (46). Pmel-1 transgenic mice (on a C57BL/6
background) express the Va1/Vb13 T-cell receptor that recognizes
amino acids 25–33 of gp100 of pmel-17 presented by H2-Db
MHC class I molecules (47). Pmel-1 breeding colonies were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory at 6 to 8 weeks of age
and were subsequently bred at Mayo Clinic under normal housing
(not pathogen-free) conditions.
The B16ova cell line was derived from a B16.F1 clone trans-
fected with a pcDNA3.1ova plasmid (33). B16ova cells were
grown in DMEM (HyClone) containing 10% FBS (Life Technol-
ogies) and G418 (5 mg/mL; Mediatech) until challenge. B16tk
cells were derived from a B16.F1 clone transfected with a plasmid
expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk)
gene. Following stable selection in puromycin (1.25 mg/mL),
these cells were shown to be sensitive to ganciclovir (cymevene)
at 5 mg/mL (40, 41). For experiments where cells were harvested
from mice, tumor lines were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech). Where appropriate,
adherent cells were confirmed to be B16tk cells by the expression
of melanin and by qRT-PCR for the HSVtk gene. Cells were
mycoplasma free and authenticated by morphology, growth
characteristics, and PCR for melanoma-specific gene expression
(gp100, TYRP-1, and TYRP2) and biologic behavior before freez-
ing. Cells were cultured less than 3 months after resuscitation.
Wild-type reovirus type 3 (Dearing strain) stock titers were
measured by plaque assays on L929 cells (a kind gift from Dr.
Kevin Harrington, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United
Kingdom). Briefly, 6-well plates were seeded with 7.5 � 105 L929
cells per well in DEMEM plus 10% FBS and incubated overnight.
Cells were washed once with PBS. One milliliter of serial dilutions
of the test reovirus stocks was loaded into the 6-well plate in
duplicate. Cells were incubated with virus for 3 hours. Media and
virus were aspirated off the cells, and 2 ml of 1% Noble agar
(diluted from a 2% stock with 2� DMEM plus 10% FBS) at 42�C
was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 4 to 5 days until
plaques were visible, and wells were then stained with 500 mL of
0.02% neutral red for 2 hours and plaques were counted. For in
vivo studies, reovirus was administered intravenously at 2 � 107
TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) per injection.
In vivo experiments
C57BL/6J and B6.129S2�Il6tm1Kopf/J IL6 knockout mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All in vivo studies were
approved by the Mayo IACUC. Mice were challenged subcutane-
ously with 5 � 105 B16ova, B16tk, or B16 melanoma cells in 100
mL PBS (HyClone). Tumors were measured 3 times per week using
Bel-Art SP Scienceware Dial-type calipers, and mice were eutha-
nized with CO2 when tumors reached 1.0 cm diameter.
For suboptimal adoptive T-cell therapy (in which more than
50% of treated mice would undergo complete macroscopic
regression followed by local recurrence), mice were treated intra-
venously with PBS or 106 4-day activated OT-I T cells on days 6
and 7 after B16ova injection as described previously (21, 43).
For ganciclovir chemotherapy experiments, C57BL/6 mice were
treated with ganciclovir intraperitoneally at 50 mg/mL on days 6
to 10 and days 13 to 17 after subcutaneous B16tk injection.
For suboptimal, systemic virotherapy experiments, C57BL/6
mice with 5-day established B16 tumors were treated intraperi-
toneally with PBS or paclitaxel (PAC; Mayo Clinic Pharmacy) at
10 mg/kg body weight for 3 days followed by intravenous reovirus
(2 � 107 TCID50) or PBS for 2 days. This cycle was repeated once
and was modified from a more effective therapy described pre-
viously (36).
To prevent or delay tumor recurrences, mice were treated
intravenously with anti–PD-1 (0.25 mg; catalog no. BE0146; Bio
X Cell), anti-TNFa (1 mg; catalog no. AF-410-NA; R&D Systems),
anti-asialo GM1 (0.1 mg; catalog no. CL8955; Cedarlane), or
isotype control rat IgG (catalog no. 012-000-003; Jackson Immu-
noResearch) antibody at times described in each experiment.
Establishment of MRD tumor–cell cultures from skin explants
Mice treated with ganciclovir, OT-I T cells, or reovirus that had
no palpable tumors following regression and macroscopic dis-
appearance for >40 days had skin from the sites of B16tk, B16ova,
or B16 injection explanted. Briefly, skin was mechanically and
enzymatically dissociated and approxomately 103 to 104 cells
were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, wells were
washed three times with PBS, and 7 days later inspected micro-
scopically for actively growing tumor–cell cultures.
qRT-PCR
B16 cells or MRD B16 cells expanded from a site of tumor
injection for 72 hours in TNFa in vitro were cultured for 48 hours
in serum-free medium. Cells were then harvested, and RNA was
prepared with the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit. One microgram total
RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20 mL volume using oligo-(dT)
primers and the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(catalog no. 04379012001; Roche). A LightCycler 480 SYBR
Green I Master Kit was used to prepare samples according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 ng of cDNA was diluted
[neat (undiluted), 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000] and amplified with
gene-specific primers using GAPDH as a normalization control.
Expression of the murine TOPO-IIa gene was detected using the
forward 50-GAGCCAAAAATGTCTTGTATTAG-30 and reverse 50-
GAGATGTCTGCCCTTAGAAG-30
primers. Expression of the
murine GAPDH gene was detected using the forward 50-

Primer Blast primer designing tool.
Samples were loaded into a 96-well PCR plate in duplicate and
ran on a LightCycler480 instrument (Roche). The threshold cycle
(Ct) at which amplification of the target sequence was detected
was used to compare the relative expression of mRNAs in the
samples using the 2�DDCt method.
Immune cell activation
Spleens and lymph nodes were immediately excised from
euthanized C57BL/6 or OT-I mice and dissociated in vitro to
achieve single-cell suspensions. Red blood cells were lysed with
ACK lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 minutes. Cells were resus-
pended at 1 � 106 cells/mL in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's
Medium (IMDM; Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% pen-
icillin-streptomycin, 40 mmol/L 2-BME. Cells were cocultured
with target B16 or B16MRD cells as described in the text. Cell-
free supernatants were then collected 72 hours later and tested for
IFNg (Mouse IFNg ELISA Kit; OptEIA, BD Biosciences) and TNFa
(BD Biosciences) production by ELISA as directed in the manu-
facturer's instructions.
NK cells were prepared from spleens of na€
�ve C57BL/6 mice
using the NK Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec) as described in
the "NK cell isolation" section and cocultured with B16 or
B16MRD target tumor cells at E:T ratios of 20:1. Seventy-two
hours later, supernatants were assayed for IFNg or IL6 by ELISA.
Cytokines and antibodies
Cytokines and cytokine-neutralizing antibodies were added to
cultures upon plating of the cells and used at the following
concentrations in vitro: VEGF165 (12 ng/mL; catalog no. CYF-
336; Prospec-Bio), TNFa (100 ng/mL; catalog no. 31501A; Pepro-
tech), IL6 (100 pg/mL; catalog no. 216-16; PeproTech), anti-TNFa
(0.4 mg/mL; catalog no. AF410NA; R&D Systems), universal IFNa
(100 U; catalog no. 11200-2; R&D Systems), anti-IL6 (1 mg/mL;
catalog no. MP5-20F3; BioLegend), LPS (25 ng/mL; catalog no.
L4524; Sigma), and CpG (25 ng/mL; Mayo Clinic Oligonucleo-
tide Core facility).
Immune cell depletion
Splenocyte and lymph node cultures were depleted of different
immune cell types [asialo GM-1þ (NKs), CD4þ, CD8þ, CD11cþ,
or CD11bþ cells] by magnetic bead depletion [catalog no. 130-
052-501 (NK); 130-104-454 (CD4); 130-104-075 (CD8); 130-
108-338 (CD11c) and 130-049-601 (CD11b); Miltenyi Biotec]
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cultures were depleted using the RB6-8C5 (8 mg/mL; R&D
Systems, catalog no. MAB1037) and 1A8 (1 mg/mL; BioLegend,
catalog no. 127601) antibodies. 1A8 recognizes only Ly-6G,
whereas clone RB6-8C5 recognizes both Ly-6G and Ly-6C. Ly6G
is differentially expressed in the myeloid lineage on monocytes,
macrophages, granulocytes, and peripheral neutrophils. RB6-8C5
is typically used for phenotypic analysis of monocytes, macro-
phages, and granulocytes, whereas 1A8 is typically used to char-
acterize neutrophils.
NK-cell isolation and flow cytometry
Mouse NK cells were isolated from single-cell suspensions of
the dissociated spleens of 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice using
the NK Cell Isolation Kit II according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). In this protocol, T cells, dendritic
cells, B cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and erythroid cells are
indirectly magnetically labeled with a cocktail of biotin-

 conjugated antibodies and anti-biotin microbeads for 15 min-
utes. After depleting magnetically labeled cells, isolation and
enrichment of unlabeled NK cells was confirmed by flow cyto-
metry. Isolated NK cells were stained with CD3-FITC (catalog no.
100306; BioLegend), NK1.1-PE (catalog no. 108708; BioLegend),
PD-1-Pe/Cy7 (catalog no. 109109; BioLegend), PD-L1-APC (cat-
alog no. 124311; BioLegend) to distinguish enriched NK cells
from CD3þ cells. Blood was taken either serially in an approxi-
mately 200 mL submandibular vein bleed or from cardiac punc-
ture at the time of sacrifice. Blood was collected in heparinized
tubes, washed twice with ACK lysis buffer, and resuspended in
PBS for staining.
Flow cytometry analysis was carried out by the Mayo Micros-
copy and Cell Analysis core, and data were analyzed using FlowJo
software. Enriched NK cells were identified by gating on NK1.1hi
CD49bhi CD3elo cells.
In vitro cytokine secretion and flow cytometry
B16 or B16MRD tumor cells cocultured with isolated NK cells
were seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin containing anti–PD-1 (catalog no. BE0146; Bio X
Cell), anti–PD-L1 (catalog no. BE0101; Bio X Cell), anti-CTLA4
(100 ng/mL; catalog no. BE0164; Bio X Cell), or isotype control
(Chrome Pure anti-rabbit IgG; catalog no. 011-000-003; The
Jackson Laboratory). Seventy-two hours postincubation, super-
natants were harvested and analyzed for cytokine secretion using
ELISAs for IFNg and TFNa. Tumor cells were stained for CD45-
PerCP (BD Bioscience) and PD-L1-APC (BioLegend). Flow cyto-
metry analysis was performed as discussed.
Phase-contrast microscopy
Pictures of B16 or B16MRD cell cultures, under the conditions
described in the text, were acquired using an Olympus-IX70
microscope (UplanF1 4x/0.13PhL), a SPOT Insight-1810 digital
camera and SPOT Software v4.6.
Histopathology
Skin at the site of initial tumor cell injection or tumors was
harvested, fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, and sec-
tioned. Two independent pathologists, blinded to the experimen-
tal design, examined H&E sections for the presence of B16
melanoma cells and immune infiltrates.
Statistical analysis
In vivo experimental data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
4 software (GraphPad Software). Survival data from the animal
studies were analyzed using the log-rank test and the Mann–
Whitney U test, and data were assessed using Kaplan–Meier plots.
One-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVAs were applied for in vitro
assays as appropriate. Statistical significance was determined at
the level of P < 0.05.
Results
Model of MRD
We have previously shown that established subcutaneous B16
tumors can be treated with either prodrug chemotherapy, onco-
lytic viro-immunotherapy, or adoptive T-cell therapy (21, 34, 36,
43–45). Irrespective of the first-line treatment, histology at the site
of initial tumor injection after tumor regression often showed
residual melanoma cells in mice scored as tumor free (Fig. 1A). In
one experiment, 6 of 10 mice cleared of B16tk tumors by treat-
ment with ganciclovir (using a regimen in which 100% of tumors
regressed macroscopically followed by �50%–80% of the mice
undergoing later local recurrence; ref. 43) had histologic evidence
of MRD 80 days after tumor seeding. Although parental B16tk
cells grow rapidly in tissue culture, no viable B16tk cells were
recovered from separate skin explants 75 days following tumor
seeding from 15 mice that had undergone complete macroscopic
regressions following ganciclovir (Fig. 1B and H). The very low
frequency of regrowth of B16 cultures from skin explants was
reproducible from mice in which primary B16tk or B16ova
tumors were rendered nonpalpable by oncolytic virotherapy with
either reovirus (36), adoptive T-cell therapy with Pmel (34), or
OT-I T cells (see Table 1 for cumulative summary; ref. 21).
When C57BL/6 splenocytes from tumor- na€
�ve mice were
cocultured with skin explants containing MRD B16 cells, no
tumor cells were recovered after in vitro culture (Fig. 1C
and H). However, when splenocyte and lymph node cells from
mice that had previously cleared B16 tumors were cocultured
with skin explants, actively proliferating B16 cultures could be
recovered in vitro (Fig. 1D and H). These data suggest that
splenocyte and lymph node cells from mice previously vaccinated
against primary tumor cells secrete a factor that promotes growth
of MRD B16 cells. In this respect, systemic VEGF can prematurely
induce early recurrence of B16 MRD following first-line therapy
that cleared the tumors (43). Although in vitro treatment of MRD
B16 explants with VEGF did not support outgrowth of B16 cells
(Fig. 1E and H), coculture of splenocytes and lymph nodes from
control nontumor-bearing mice with VEGF supported outgrowth
at low frequencies (Fig. 1F and H). However, coculture of sple-
nocytes and lymph nodes from mice that cleared B16 primary
tumors with VEGF consistently supported outgrowth of MRD B16
cells with high efficiency (Fig. 1G).
TNFa supports outgrowth of MRD
VEGF-treated splenocyte and lymph node cells from mice that
cleared B16 tumors showed rapid upregulation of TNFa, derived
principally from CD11bþ cells (Fig. 2A). Depletion of CD4þ T
cells enhanced TNFa production from VEGF-treated splenocyte
and lymph node cells (Fig. 2A). Outgrowth of MRD B16 cells from
skin explants following different first-line therapies was actively
promoted by TNFa (Fig. 2B and F) but not by IL6 (Fig. 2C and F)
or other cytokines such as IFNg (Fig. 2B–F). Antibody-mediated
blockade of TNFa significantly inhibited the ability of splenocyte
and lymph node cells from mice that cleared B16 tumors to
support outgrowth of MRD B16 cells (Fig. 2D–F). In contrast to
the growth-promoting effects of TNFa on MRD B16 cells, culture
of parental B16 cells with TNFa significantly inhibited growth
(Fig. 2G). Consistent with Fig. 2A, monocytes and macrophages
were the principal source of the growth-promoting TNFain VEGF-
treated splenocyte and lymph node cells from mice that cleared
B16 tumors (Fig. 2G). Similarly, outgrowth of MRD TC2 murine
prostate cells following first-line viro-immunotherapy was also
actively promoted by TNFa, whereas TNFa was highly cytotoxic to
the parental tumor cells (Fig. 2I). Therefore, in two different cell
types, TNFa changes from an antitumor effector against primary
tumors into a growth promoter for MRD. B16 MRD cultures
maintained in TNFa for up to 6 weeks retained their dependence
upon the cytokine for continued in vitro proliferation. Withdrawal
of TNFa did not induce cell death but prevented continued
proliferation. Finally, we did not observe reversion to a phenotype
in which TNFa was growth inhibitory within a 6-week period.

 We did not observe any reduction in the ability of cultures to
support outgrowth of MRD cells when depleted of neutrophils,
CD4 cells, or NK cells, whereas depletion of Ly6Gþ cells
(completely) and CD8þ T cells (partially) inhibited outgrowth
(Fig. 2H). Therefore, taken together with the dependence of TNFa
aproduction on CD11bþ cells, our data suggest that CD11bþ
monocytes and macrophages are the principal cell type respon-
sible for the TNFa-mediated outgrowth of B16 MRD recurrences,
although CD8þ T cells also play a role.
TNFa-expanded MRD acquires a recurrence-competent
phenotype
The recurrence-competent phenotype (RCP) of B16 cells
emerging from a state of MRD is associated with transient high
expression of topoisomerase IIa (TOPO-IIa) and YB-1 (44) and
acquired insensitivity to innate immunosurveillance (43).
Therefore, we investigated whether the B16 MRD cultures,
which we could induce with TNFa, resembled this same phe-
notype to validate their identity as recurrent tumors. MRD B16
cells expanded in vitro with TNFa overexpressed both Topo-IIa
and YB-1 compared with parental B16, consistent with their
acquisition of the RCP (Fig. 3A). Coculture of skin explants
with TNFa or splenocyte and lymph node cultures induced
outgrowth of MRD B16 cells (Fig. 3B and D), which were
sensitive to the Topo-IIa–targeting drug doxorubicin (Fig. 3C
and E). MRD B16 cells expanded in TNFa were also insensitive
to the antiviral protective effects of IFNa upon infection with
reovirus and supported more vigorous replication of reovirus
than parental B16 cells (Fig. 3F), consistent with acquisition of
the RCP (43). In contrast, IFNa protected parental B16 cells
from virus replication.
MRD cells lose sensitivity to NK immunosurveillance
The RCP is also associated with an acquisition of an insensi-
tivity to innate immune effectors (44). Therefore, we next inves-
tigated whether NK cells, a major effector of innate immunosur-
veillance of tumors, differentially recognized primary B16 com-
pared with their B16 MRD derivatives. For the following experi-
ments, a homogenous population of untouched splenic NK1.1hi
CD49bhi CD3elo NK cells was isolated from spleens of C57BL/6
mice. Although purified NK cells secreted significant amounts of
IFNg upon coculture with parental B16 cells, TNFa-expanded
MRD B16 cultures did not stimulate IFNg from NK cells (Fig. 4A).
Consistent with reports of a spike in serum IL6 just prior to the
emergence of tumor recurrences (43), cocultures of purified NK
cells from wild-type mice, but not from IL6 knockout mice,
produced IL6 in response to MRD B16 but not parental B16 cells
(Fig. 4B). Intracellular staining confirmed that an NK1.1þ cell
population within wild-type splenocytes differentially recognized
parental B16 and B16 MRD cells through IL6 expression (Fig. 4C).
IL6 was detected in excised small recurrent tumors but not in small
primary tumors, whereas TNFa could not be detected in recurrent
tumors but was present at very low amounts in some primary
tumors (Fig. 4D). Although subcutaneous injection of 103 MRD
B16 cells generated tumors in 100% of mice, a similar dose of
parental B16 cells did not generate tumors in any of the 5 animals
(Fig. 4E and F). However, when mice were depleted of NK cells
prior to tumor challenge, 103 parental B16 cells became tumor-
igenic in 100% of the animals (Fig. 4E). NK-cell depletion had no
effect on the already high tumorigenicity of the same dose of MRD
B16 cells (Fig. 4F). Therefore, MRD B16 cells expanded in TNFa
were significantly more tumorigenic than parental B16 cells, in
part, because they were insensitive to NK-cell recognition.
Differential recognition of primary and MRD cells
by NK cells
Both MRD B16 cells expanded in TNFa and a freshly resected
tumor upregulated the T-cell checkpoint inhibitory molecule PD-
L1 (48, 49), whereas PD-L1 expression was low on parental B16
cells and lower on a freshly resected primary tumor, whether or
not it was treated with TNFa (Fig. 5A). Although purified NK cells
did not secrete IFNg in response to TNFa-expanded MRD B16
cells or to early recurrent B16 tumor explants (Fig. 4A), they did
produce IFNg in the presence of parental B16 cells and primary
B16 tumors (Fig. 5B). Blockade of PD-L1 on MRD B16 cells
increased NK cell–mediated IFNg secretion and also significantly
enhanced NK-cell response to parental B16 cells (Fig. 5B). Con-
versely, NK cell–mediated IL6 secretion in response to MRD B16
cells was significantly decreased by blockade of PD-L1 (Fig. 5C).
However, PD-L1 blockade did not alter the inability of parental
B16 cells to stimulate IL6 secretion from purified NK cells
(Fig. 5C).

 therapy (21) still retained high expression of the target OVA
antigen, suggesting that antigen loss is a later event in the pro-
gression to recurrent tumor growth (Fig. 5D). As expected, OT-I T
cells secreted IFNg upon coculture with B16ova cells invitro, which
was augmented by coculture with NK cells from either wild-type
or IL6 KO mice (Fig. 5E). Anti-IL6 had no effect on OT-I recog-
nition of parental B16ova cells irrespective of the source of the NK
cells (Fig. 5E). Although TNFa-expanded MRD B16ova cells still
expressed OVA (Fig. 5D), they elicited significantly lower IFNg
from OT-I and NK cells alone (Fig. 5F). Coculture of OT-I T cells
with wild-type, but not with IL6 KO, NK cells abolished IFNg
production in response to MRD B16ova cells (Fig. 5F and G)
and was reversed by IL6 blockade (Fig. 5F). After 7 days of
coculture with OT-I and NK cells, surviving parental B16ova cells
had lost OVA expression, irrespective of IL6 presence (Fig. 5H).
However, only in the presence of IL6 blockade did MRD B16ova
cells rapidly lose OVA expression (Fig. 5G). These data suggest
that NK-mediated IL6 expression in response to TNFa-expanded
MRD cells can inhibit T-cell recognition of its cognate antigen
expressed by tumor targets and, thereby, slow the evolution of
antigen loss variants.
Phenotypic analysis of the lymphoid cells from tumor-na€
�ve
mice compared with those from mice cleared of tumor showed
minimal differences in subsets of CD4þ T cells (Fig. 6A–D). In
addition to a nonsignificant trend toward an increase in circulat-
ing CD8þ effector cells (CD44hi CD62Llo) in mice cleared of
tumor (Fig. 6E), effector cells expressing both inhibitory receptors
PD-1 and TIM-3 were also consistently higher compared with
tumor-na€
�ve mice (Fig. 6F). These data suggest that mice with
tumors that have been treated successfully through immunother-
apeutic first-line treatments contain populations of antitumor
effector cells that may be functionally impaired to some degree
due to elevated expression of checkpoint inhibitor molecules.
Inhibition of tumor recurrence
On the basis of these data, several molecules and cells, VEGF,
CD11bþ cells, TNFa, PD-L1, NK cells, would be predicted to
play an important role in mediating the successful transition
from MRD to actively expanding recurrence. After primary
B16tk tumors had regressed following chemotherapy with
ganciclovir (43), about half of the mice routinely developed
recurrences between 40 and 80 days following complete mac-
roscopic regression of the primary tumor (Fig. 7A). However,
long-term treatment with antibody-mediated blockade of
either PD-1 or TNFa effectively slowed or prevented recurrence
(Fig. 7A). The depletion of NK cells also prevented recurrence of
B16tk tumors (Fig. 7A), consistent with their secretion of T-cell
inhibitory IL6.
Our data would also predict that systemic triggers that induce
VEGF (43) and/or TNFa from host CD11bþ cells would accel-
erate tumor recurrence. In vitro, LPS stimulation of splenocyte
and lymph node cultures induced high TNFa (Fig. 7B) and also
supported the outgrowth of 5/8 MRD B16 skin explants, an
effect that was eradicated by blockade of TNFa (Fig. 7C).
Therefore, we tested systemic treatment with TNFa-inducing
LPS as a mimic of a trauma or infection that may induce
recurrence. Primary tumors that macroscopically regressed into
a state of MRD were prematurely induced to recur in 100% of
mice following treatment with LPS, consistent with an LPS/
TNFa–induced mechanism of induction of recurrence from a
state of MRD (Fig. 7D). Under these conditions, depletion of
NK cells significantly delayed recurrence but did not prevent
it (Fig. 7D), unlike in the model of spontaneous recurrence
(Fig. 7A). Prolonged treatment with antibody-mediated block-
ade of either PD-1 or TNFa successfully prevented long-term
recurrence, even when mice were treated with LPS (in 100% of
mice in the experiment of Fig. 7D, and in 7/8 mice in a second
experiment).
Discussion
We have developed models in which several different first-
line therapies reduced established primary tumors to a state of
MRD with no remaining palpable tumor (43–45). However, in
a proportion of mice in this study, first-line therapy was
insufficient to eradicate all tumor cells, leaving histologically
detectable disease. Explants of skin at the site of tumor cell
injection following regression rarely yielded actively prolifer-
ating B16 cells, even though >50% of samples contained
residual tumor cells. The frequency with which cultures of
MRD cells were recovered following explant was significantly
increased by coculture with splenocytes and lymph node cells
from mice previously treated for tumors, and this effect was
enhanced by VEGF, which induced TNFa from CD11bþ cells.
Taken together, we believe that CD11bþ monocytes and macro-
phages are the principal cell type responsible for the VEGF-
mediated induction of TNFa and for the TNFa-mediated out-
growth of B16 MRD recurrences. Although we showed TNFa
was highly cytotoxic to parental B16 cells and primary tumor
explants, TNFa supported expansion of MRD cells from skin
explants at high frequency, irrespective of the primary treat-
ment. As shown previously, splenocytes from mice with cleared
B16 tumors after ganciclovir treatment killed significantly
higher numbers of target B16 cells in vitro than did splenocytes
from control, tumor-na€
�ve mice, confirming the generation of
an effective antitumor T-cell response (42). In contrast, here, we
show no significant difference between killing of B16MRD cells
expanded for 120 hours in TNFa in vitro by splenocytes from
Figure 6.
(Continued.) To analyze quantitative flow cytometry data, one-way ANOVA
testing was conducted with a Tukey posttest; P values reported from these
analyses were corrected to account for multiple comparisons.

 mice that cleared a B16 tumor compared with splenocytes from
control, tumor-na€
�ve mice. We are currently investigating the
molecular mechanisms by which B16MRD cells effectively
evade the antitumor T-cell responses induced by first-line
treatment (such as ganciclovir, T-cell therapy, or oncolytic
virotherapy).
TNFa-mediated expansion of MRD B16 cells induced the
RCP (43, 44), shown by de novo expression of recurrence-
associated genes (YB-1 and topoisomerase IIa; ref. 44). Reac-
tivation of metastatic cells lying latent in the lungs has been
associated with expression of the Zeb1 transcription factor,
which
mediates
the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition
(50). NK cells are major innate effectors of immunosurveillance
of tumors and responded differently to recurrent competent
MRD B16 cells compared with primary B16 cells. We show NK
cells were activated by parental B16 cells to secrete IFNg and

 were major effectors of in vivo tumor clearance. In contrast,
TNFa-expanded MRD B16 cells induced NK cells to secrete IL6
instead of IFNg, which was not seen for parental B16 cells,
effects mediated, in part, through PD-L1. IL6 produced by NK
cells in response to TNFa-expanded MRD B16ova cells also
inhibited OT-I T-cell recognition of OVAþ tumor targets. TNFa-
expanded MRD cells still retained OVA expression, despite
using
first-line
OVA-targeted
T-cell
therapy.
Only
upon
prolonged coculture of OVAþ MRD cells with OT-Iþ NK
cells with IL6 blockade was significant antigen loss observed,
consistent with the long-term, but not early, loss of OVA
antigen expression from B16ova recurrences following OT-I
adoptive T-cell therapy (21, 43). Therefore, antigen loss in
MRD cells is not an essential prerequisite for the emergence
of tumor recurrences (21) and may occur through powerful
selective pressure on very early antigen-positive recurrent
tumors as they expand in vivo in the presence of ongoing
antigen-targeted T-cell pressure.
Our data here are consistent with a model in which the
transition from quiescent MRD to actively expanding recurrence
is promoted by the acquisition of a phenotype in which TNFa
changes from being a cytotoxic growth inhibitor (against primary
tumors), to promoting the survival and growth of one, or a few,
MRD cells. It is not clear whether these TNFa-responsive clones
exist within the primary tumor population, perhaps as recurrence-
competent stem cells (31), or whether this RCP is acquired by
ongoing mutation during the response to first-line therapy (9, 14,
29, 30). As established primary B16 and B16 MRD tumors both
have low intratumoral NK infiltration, we hypothesize that the
differential recognition of B16 or B16 MRD cells by NK cells
occurs at very early stages of tumor development. Therefore, it
may be that different subsets of NK cells mediate the differential
recognition of primary B16 (rejection) or B16 MRD (growth
stimulation). However, in our experiments here, a homogenous
population of untouched splenic NK1.1hi CD49bhi CD3elo NK
cells differentially recognized parental B16 and B16 MRD cells,
suggesting that the basis for these different NK responses are, in
large part, due to tumor–cell intrinsic properties. These recur-
rence-competent MRD cells are insensitive to both innate and
adaptive immunosurveillance mechanisms, in part, through
expression of PD-L1. With respect to escape from adaptive immu-
nosurveillance, we show both that the MRD cells express high PD-
L1 and that the fraction of effector cells expressing both inhibitory
receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 was consistently higher in tumor-
experienced mice than tumor-na€
�ve mice. Integral to both innate
and adaptive immune evasion, TNFa-expanded MRD tumor cells
induced an anti-inflammatory profile of IL6hi and IFNglo expres-
sion from NK cells, the opposite of the profile of NK recognition
(IL6lo IFNghi) induced by parental primary tumor cells. This
altered role of NK cells as prorecurrence effectors, as opposed to
antitumor immune effectors, was due to impaired killing of MRD
cells and recurrent tumor cells plus the secretion of IL6. This NK-
derived IL6, in turn, inhibited T-cell responses against recurrent
tumors, even when they continued to express T cell–specific
antigens.
This model showed several molecules and cells, VEGF, CD11bþ
cells, TNFa, PD-1/PD-L1, NK cells, can be targeted for therapeutic
intervention to delay recurrence. In our model of spontaneous
recurrence, depletion of NK cells or antibody-mediated blockade
of either TNFa or PD-1 significantly inhibited tumor recurrence
following first-line ganciclovir. Our data suggest that a systemic
trigger, such as VEGF-induced by trauma or infection, promotes
TNFa release from host CD11bþ cells, leading to growth
stimulation of MRD cells. Consistent with this, LPS both
induced TNFa from splenocytes and lymph node cells and
mimicked TNFa in the generation of expanding MRD cultures
from skin explants. Recurrence could be induced prematurely
by LPS, as a mimic of a systemic infection/trauma, consistent
with a report in which LPS treatment reactivated intravenously
injected disseminated tumor cells preselected for properties of
latency (50). These results suggest that patients in a state of
MRD may be at significantly increased risk of recurrence fol-
lowing infections and/or trauma, which induce the release of
systemic VEGF and/or TNFa. However, blockade of PD-1 or
TNFa following this trauma-like event prevented tumor recur-
rence. We are currently investigating when, and for how long,
these potentially expensive recurrence-blocking therapies will
be required to be administered in patients. This is especially
relevant for those patients in whom MRD may be present over
several years before recurrence is triggered. Transcriptome anal-
ysis of MRD and early recurrences, compared with parental
tumor cells, is underway in both mouse models (B16 and TC2)
as well as in patient samples where matched pairs of primary
and treatment failed recurrence tumors are available. These
studies will identify the signaling pathways that differ between
the cell types to account for their differential responses to TNFa
signaling and IFNg and IL6 production by NK cells. Future
studies will focus on identifying which cells become recurrent
tumors, the mutational and selective processes involved in the
transition, identification of the biological triggers for recurrence
(1, 32), and the time over which recurrence-inhibiting therapies
must be administered.
In summary, we show here that the transition from MRD to
recurrence involves the subversion of normal innate immuno-
surveillance mechanisms. In particular, TNFa produced in
response to pathologic stimuli becomes a prorecurrence, as
opposed to antitumor, growth factor. Simultaneously, NK cells,
which normally restrict primary tumor growth, fail to kill expand-
ing recurrent tumor cells and produce IL6 that helps to suppress
adaptive T-cell responses, even with continued expression of T
cell–targetable antigens. Finally, our data show that therapies
aimed at blocking certain key molecules (PD-1, TNFa) and cell
types (NK cells) may be valuable in preventing this transition
from occurring in patients.
