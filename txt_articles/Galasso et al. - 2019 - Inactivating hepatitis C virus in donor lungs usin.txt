Availability of organs is a limiting factor for lung transplantation, leading to substantial
mortality rates on the wait list. Use of organs from donors with transmissible viral infections,
such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), would increase organ donation, but these organs are gen-
erally not offered for transplantation due to a high risk of transmission. Here, we develop a
method for treatment of HCV-infected human donor lungs that prevents HCV transmission.
Physical viral clearance in combination with germicidal light-based therapies during nor-
mothermic ex-vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP), a method for assessment and treatment of injured
donor lungs, inactivates HCV virus in a short period of time. Such treatment is shown to
be safe using a large animal EVLP-to-lung transplantation model. This strategy of treating
viral infection in a donor organ during preservation could significantly increase the availability
of organs for transplantation and encourages further clinical development.

 L
ung transplantation (LTx) is a successful therapy for end-
stage lung diseases but the number of available donors do
not meet the demand1,2, partially due to the fact that only
15% of lungs from available donors are used3. The shortage of
suitable organs leads to high waiting-list mortality rates4. Con-
sequently, approaches to increase organ availability are critical for
realizing the maximum potential benefit of transplantation5.
While many strategies continue to be explored to treat com-
mon donor lung injuries such as aspiration pneumonia, pul-
monary edema, pulmonary emboli and bacterial infection5–8, no
attempts at treating common donor chronic viral infections such
as Hepatitis C have been evaluated. HCV affects 2% of North
Americans9–12. However, in the context of organ donation and
the current epidemic of overdose-deaths (OD) in the donor
population, some geographic areas in USA report up to 20% of all
organ donors being nucleic acid test positive (NAT + ) for
HCV13. Underuse of these organs is particularly relevant, given
that these donors are often young, with fewer comorbidities than
other donors14.
To date, lungs from donors testing NAT + for HCV are gen-
erally not used for transplantation due to a virtual 100% risk of
transmission to recipients15. Moreover, historical data have
shown that HCV-negative recipients receiving lungs from HCV-
positive donors have significantly worse post-transplant out-
comes12,15. Thus, if HCV-positive donors could be safely added
to the donor pool, it is estimated that at least 1,000 new donors
for LTx would be available every year in North America
alone15,16. While the administration of novel direct-acting anti-
virals (DAAs) for HCV to patients post-transplant is being
assessed as a method of utilizing these organs17, a more attractive
alternative is clearance or inactivation of the virus within the
organ prior to transplantation, thereby not only increasing the
societal acceptance of using these organs but also avoiding costs,
toxicity and drug interactions related to antiviral medication.
The normothermic ex-vivo lung perfusion system (EVLP) is an
innovative method to assess lung function in the clinical setting
prior to lung transplantation3. It also provides an opportunity for
individualized therapy for otherwise damaged donor lungs. EVLP
has played a pivotal role in the expansion of the donor organ
pool1,3,18. The benefits of normothermic ex-vivo organ perfusion
have also been recently demonstrated in a seminal clinical trial in
liver transplantation19.
Non-pharmacologic approaches such as light-based therapies
(LbT) have been historically used to treat blood components.
Ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, especially in the germicidal
spectrum range of 250–270 nm, has shown to be a very effective
sterilizing approach20,21. Recent data describe HCV inactivation
in culture media and in human serum including sterilization of
pre-donation
blood
components22.
Similarly, photodynamic
therapy (PDT), using methylene blue activated with red light
irradiation, is another proven method for pre-donation ster-
ilization of blood components in blood banks23–26. PDT involves
administration of a photosensitizing drug which requires oxygen
and light irradiation at a specific wavelength band for activation,
thereby forming reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causing
irreversible
photo-damage
to
viruses,
including
HCV
and
HIV-124,25.
Since there is no robust evidence for HCV infecting or repli-
cating inside lung cells, we hypothesized that intravascular and
lung tissue mechanical perfusion during normothermic EVLP
could be an effective platform to decrease the HCV viral load in
donor lungs. The effect of EVLP in decreasing HCV levels in
donor organs before transplant has previously been shown in a
case report by our group, where an 80% decrease in HCV RNA
was seen in the lung tissue after 6 h of EVLP. However, this was
not sufficient to prevent recipient infection26, indicating that
adjuvant strategies to treat HCV during EVLP are required.
However, DAAs are unlikely to have a significant effect when
treating a lung ex-vivo, since viral replication is thought to not be
occurring within the lung itself. We thus investigated the use of
UVC and PDT during normothermic EVLP with the goal of
treating and preventing Hepatitis C transmission from infected
donor organs. Herein, we demonstrate that HCV is inactivated in
short period of time using an innovative combination of nor-
mothermic ex vivo perfusion and LbT using infected human
lungs. Furthermore, the safety of the approach is confirmed in a
pig LTx model.
Results
The illumination device. We first developed a specific light
delivery system suitable for use during normothermic EVLP.
Given the photon energies involved, UVC and PDT have similar
virucidal effects, primarily degradation of viral genomic material
and amino acids27, leading to inactivation20. A customized
apparatus (U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/481,523
(Y/R 2016–080–01; O/R 10723-P52847US00) was designed for
this study (Fig. 1a). It was conceived to be part of the clinical
EVLP circuitry (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Movie 1), and contains
two main components: an inner hollow quartz tube and a poly-
vinyl chloride (PVC) outer tube that seals the device and prevents
light leakage. A UVC lamp (OSRAM Puritec® HNS 4 W G5,
254 nm) or customized LED light source (centered emission at
660 nm) are placed in the inner of the quartz tube, depending on
the treatment. The measured irradiances at the quartz tube sur-
face of the UVC and PDT were of 31 mW/cm2 and 20 mW/cm2,
respectively. During organ perfusion, the perfusate is circulated
through the organ and continuously irradiated by light in the
circuit, in a cumulative manner. Since human albumin is a key
component in the EVLP perfusate (Steen® solution, XVIVO
Perfusion, CO, USA), we evaluated the albumin molecular
transformation after UVC irradiation by gel electrophoresis. No
albumin fragmentation or polymerization was seen with up to 6 h
of UVC. Albumin concentration levels were in fact maintained
after 12 h of irradiation, as analyzed spectrographically (Supple-
mentary Figs. 1a, b).
Effect of EVLP and LbT on HCV NAT + human donor lungs.
To evaluate the effect of EVLP as an isolated strategy and also as a
platform for LbT against HCV in the lung tissue and perfusate
solution, we studied 9 clinically rejected pairs of human lungs
from NAT + HCV donors. All donors had a signed research
consent declaration. The lungs were recovered using standard
preservation protocols and flushed with cold low-potassium
dextran solution (Perfadex®, XVIVO Perfusion, CO, USA) and
preserved at 4 °C for transport. Upon arrival at the hospital, each
lung was placed in a separate clinical-grade normothermic EVLP
circuit for 9 h using Steen solution. One lung was randomly
selected as the control group (standard EVLP protocol; n = 9)
and the other lung was assigned to different treatment conditions
(n = 3 each) (Study design, Fig. 2a): (1) Circuit exchange (com-
plete replacement of perfusate solution and circuit after 3 h of
EVLP); (2) UVC treatment (254 nm, 31 mW/cm², irradiation
time 8 h) applied to the perfusate (flow 1 L/min); (3) PDT using
methylene blue (MB, Sigma Aldrich, MI, USA) diluted in the
perfusion solution (1μmol/L) and activated with red light
(660 nm, 20 mW/cm², irradiation time 8 h) applied to perfusate
(flow 1 L/min). The advantage of this design is that both control
and treated lungs came from the same donor and therefore had
the same baseline viral load.
The initial standard flush preservation of the lungs prior to
starting EVLP resulted in an average of 1-log reduction of HCV

(Supplementary Fig. 2). Viral levels were normalized and
expressed as percentage decrease from baseline (1 h EVLP) over
time. PDT was the most effective treatment to decrease perfusate
HCV RNA levels compared to control lungs: 97.9 ± 0.71 vs.
69.5 ± 0.89% reduction (p = 0.015, two-way ANOVA), followed
by circuit exchange: 85.8 ± 2.83 vs. 46.6 ± 17.9% reduction (p =
0.046, two-way ANOVA). UVC irradiation showed no significant
reduction in viral load compared to EVLP alone: 57.6 ± 6.8 vs.
54.5 ± 10.2% reduction (p = 0.72, two-way ANOVA). PDT was
also the most effective to decrease HCV RNA levels in lung tissue
compared to control lungs: 91.0 ± 0.7 vs. 75.5 ± 8.2% reduction
(p = 0.016, two-way ANOVA), followed by circuit exchange:
84.1 ± 5.5
vs.
50.1 ± 20.1%
reduction
(p = 0.0002,

significant difference when compared to control lungs: 52.0 ± 5.7
vs. 53.3 ± 12.1% reduction (p = 0.64, two-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2b).

 during EVLP is that PDT and UVC may damage and/or fragment
virions, rendering them non-infectious. However, damaged vir-
ions may still be detected by qPCR. This is particularly relevant
because the qPCR assay in the current study targets the 5′-UTR of
HCV RNA, which is the most conserved region after LbT28. In
fact, studies using LbT in blood components have shown that loss
of infectivity occurs much earlier than reduction in levels of HCV
RNA22. This mismatch can be explained by the fact that LbT
promotes nucleic acid-crosslinking and oxidative damage, with-
out always causing total fragmentation29. We, therefore, hypo-
thesized that our measurement of HCV RNA in the perfusate
after EVLP likely underestimated the antiviral effect of LbT, since
even detectable virus exposed to LbT may have markedly
diminished or absent ability to infect naïve cells. Ideally, infec-
tivity experiments would be replicated with virus from HCV-
infected patients after LbT, but HCV is very resistant to growth in
in vitro systems30.
Thus, in order to evaluate the effect of LbT during EVLP on
HCV infectivity, we used an HCV cell culture (HCVcc) system
based on the Japanese Fulminant Hepatitis-1 clone (JFH-1),
which was derived from a genotype 2a HCV isolate. JFH-1
replicates robustly in human hepatoma cell lines that express the
viral entry factor CD81, allowing measurement of both HCV
RNA levels and HCV infectivity30. The ratio of infectious to non-
infectious virus is approximately 1 to 1000 for HCV in cell
culture31,32. We hypothesized that LbT would have a greater
effect on the ratio of infectious to non-infectious virus than on the
quantitative levels of HCV RNA measured by qPCR. To evaluate
this hypothesis, a specifically designed EVLP mini-circuit was
developed (Fig. 3a), in which a known amount of JFH-1 virus
could be added and photo-irradiated as in the human lung
experiments. After being primed with 250 mL of Steen solution,
0.5 focus-forming units/mL (FFU/mL) or 1.5 million copies/mL
of JFH-1 HCV was added to the circuit. After the perfusate was
warmed to 37 °C, a 180 min treatment was performed in three
groups (n = 4 each): (1) Control (no light irradiation), (2) UVC
(254 nm, 31 mW/cm²) and (3) PDT (MB at 1, 0.5, 0.1 or
0.01 μmol/L, in different light conditions: dark; 660 nm/20 mW/
cm²; ambient room light). During the perfusion time in the
circuit, 1.5 mL aliquots were taken and used to spike an Huh 7.5.1
hepatocyte cell culture, which was maintained for 72 h in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C plus 5% CO2. The pH was
controlled and 30%-90% cell confluence was maintained.
Infectivity was assessed by staining Huh 7.5.1 cells exposed to
JFH-1 HCV with DAPI and anti-HCV core antibody to allow
counting of clusters of infected cells (FFU). Despite detectable
HCV RNA at all time-points after LbT exposure (Fig. 3b), the
HCV infectivity of Huh 7.5.1 cells were completely abrogated
after 150 min of UVC irradiation in the mini-EVLP perfusate in
all experiments (Fig. 3c, d). Similar to the human lung
experiments, the PDT group demonstrated even greater efficacy,
with no infectivity observed after only 15 min of perfusion under
room or red-light exposure. The PDT response was MB dose-
dependent. Notably, MB had no antiviral effect when the
procedure was performed in the dark (Fig. 4a–c).
Pre-clinical large animal safety studies using EVLP/LbT
treatments. In order to translate this approach to the clinical
setting, we investigated the safety of applying UVC and PDT
during EVLP using a pre-clinical large animal lung transplant
model33 comprising male Yorkshire domestic pigs (30–35 kg) as
both donors and recipients. After donor lung retrieval, lungs were
preserved for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by normothermic EVLP for 6 h
(Study design, Fig. 5a). During EVLP, the pig lungs were ran-
domized to three groups (n = 4 each): (1) Control (standard
EVLP); (2) UVC (254 nm; 31 mW/cm²); (3) PDT (1μmol/L MB
in the perfusion solution; 660 nm; 20 mW/cm²). Perfusate sam-
ples were taken for gas analysis (RAPIDPoint 500 System, Sie-
mens,
Munich,
Germany).
Following
EVLP,
left
lung
transplantation was performed and evaluated for 4 h, this being
the most critical period to evaluate ischemia-reperfusion injury
(post-transplant acute lung injury), followed by right pulmonary
artery clamping with total exclusion of the contralateral native
lung for isolated graft functional assessment. There were no dif-
ferences between the 3 groups in physiologic parameters or
oxygenation during 6 h of EVLP (Supplementary Fig. 4). More
importantly, post-transplant oxygenation function, airway pres-
sures and pulmonary edema did not indicate any signs of mea-
surable lung injury in any of the groups (Fig. 5b–e). Other
markers of acute lung injury, including inflammatory and cell-
death markers, showed no deleterious effects of UVC or PDT
during EVLP (Supplementary Fig. 5) or after transplantation
(Figs 5f and 6a–b).
Clonogenic assays. Due to the capacity of UVC to alter self-
proteins to make them immunogenic and potentially lead to
protein repolymerization and photo toxin generation34, a human
fibroblast clonogenic assay was used to assess for any cytotoxicity.
Human fibroblasts were seeded out in appropriate dilutions to
form colonies in 1–3 weeks. Samples of perfusate (Steen®) solu-
tion were irradiated as for the mini-EVLP system, in two different
groups (n = 4, each): (1) Control (standard EVLP); (2) UVC
(254 nm; 31 mW/cm²), with samples taken at different time
points, and then mixed with the cell culture media. Colonies were
fixed, stained with crystal violet and counted using a stereo-
microscope. We observed no measurable cytotoxic effect of the
irradiated perfusion solution (Fig. 7a–b).
Discussion
Here we evaluated the therapeutic effect of LbT during organ
preservation using normothermic EVLP as a treatment platform.
UVC and PDT during EVLP effectively reduced HCV infectivity.
Furthermore, studies in a large animal model demonstrated that
these therapies, applied during EVLP, have no demonstrable
deleterious effects on the lung or to the currently used perfusate
solution. These data provide pre-clinical evidence to proceed to
clinical studies of LbT during EVLP, especially in an era where
available rescue therapies using DAAs have been shown to be
efficacious35. This therapy could conceivably be translated to
other donor organs, such as kidney or heart, from HCV-infected
donors. Since no human lung transplants were performed in the
present study, we cannot be certain whether transmission would
ultimately be prevented. However, this is one of the first attempts
in eliminating a viral infection from a human donor organ during
preservation, much resembling approaches applied in blood
banks in the past. Another recent study demonstrated the viral
inactivation efficacy of MB in cells and in ex-vivo mini-pigs
kidneys exposed with HCV. In an ex-vivo experiment on con-
taminated kidney, 1 μM MB was perfused manually or with
hypothermic machine perfusion, both resulted in very low or
undetectable HCV RNA levels. Compared to the proposed
treatment methods in our study, the HCV inactivation mechan-
ism by MB in that study was not investigated, whereas we pro-
posed two photonic treatments, ultraviolet C irradiation and MB-
photodynamic therapy36. While direct transplantation with an
HCV-infected
organ
coupled
with
post-transplant
DAA
therapy of the recipient can potentially be an alternate approach,
we believe that organ treatment prior to transplant may
have several scientific and clinical advantages: (1) improved
societal acceptance of marginal or infected organs/donors, (2)

 avoidance of treatment costs associated with DAAs and (3)
avoidance of treatment-drug interactions. Furthermore, these ex-
vivo therapies may decrease virus loads within the allograft to
critically low levels such that very short course DAA treatment

transplantation
could

to

prevention of infection. Finally, this EVLP-LbT approach to
Hepatitis C treatment opens an opportunity to evaluate prior to
transplant ex-vivo treatments of other infectious agents, not only
increasing donor pool, but also the safety of transplantation
in general.

 Methods
The illumination device. To treat the perfusion solution during EVLP using a
single and ergonomic light source, a customized illumination device was designed
and fabricated in collaboration with the University of São Paulo. This is directly
connected to the EVLP tubing and so constitutes part of the closed system. It does
not affect the perfusion flow or pressure, nor introduces air bubbles after initial
priming. The light source is mounted within a quartz tube, surrounded by an
opaque PVC tube that prevents light from escaping from the irradiation cavity. The
perfusate is thereby irradiated over 360° as it flows through the quartz tube. Being a
closed system, the same fluid liquid passes through the tube several times during
EVLP, resulting in a cumulative LbT effect.
Ex vivo lung perfusion. EVLP has been established as a clinical tool for LTx37. The
Toronto technique1 comprises of perfusion under normothermia, targeting 40% of
the donor predicted cardiac output, under protective lung ventilation (7cc/kg,
inspired fraction of oxygen of 21%, end expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O) and the
use of an acellular perfusate with increased colloid osmotic pressure (described

 Fig. 4 Infectivity studies (PDT). The perfusion solution in the mini-EVLP circuit was spiked with a set amount of JFH-1 viruses and hepatocyte Huh 7.5 were
used as an infectivity assay (n = 4, each group). Methylene Blue (MB) was diluted in different concentrations (1 μM/L, 0.5 μM/L, 0.1 μM/L and 0.01 μM/L)
and activated by different light conditions (no light, 660 nm/20 mW/cm² red light and regular room light). A Huh 7.5 hepatocyte cell culture was
transfected and stained (DAPI and HCV anti-core Ab). Infected hepatocytes clusters were counted. a In dark conditions, HCV maintained the infectivity
potential, regardless the MB dosage. qPCR counts of HCV were stable during the treatment. b Room light exposure promoted virus inactivation in a MB
dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001 in all scenarios, one-way ANOVA), despite virus RNA still being detected on qPCR. c Red light demonstrated the
maximal inactivation effectiveness, with significant difference in all scenarios (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA), despite virus RNA still being detected on
qPCR. Left panels: Black dots represent qPCR results in IU/mL in the control group whereas qPCR results in different MB concentration are shown in blue

 below)37. After donor lung retrieval, organs are flushed with a low potassium
dextran solution and stored inflated at 4 °C. The left atrium (LA) and main pul-
monary artery (PA) are cannulated, and an intra-tracheal tube is placed. A second
retrograde flush is performed using low potassium dextran solution. The lungs are
kept inflated during the entire preparation. After cannulation, the organ is placed
inside a customized chamber and the vascular cannulas are connected to the EVLP
circuit. The endotracheal tube is connected to an ICU ventilator. The EVLP circuit
is comprised of a centrifugal pump, a leucocyte filter, a hollow fiber oxygenator,
heat exchanger and hard-shell reservoir. It is primed with 2.0 L of a buffered, low-
K + solution with human albumin plus dextran extracellular solution (Steen®
solution, XVIVO), 500 mg of methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol; Sandoz Canada,
Boucherville, Canada), 10,000 IU of unfractionated heparin (Leo Pharma,

 Biosafety office at University Health Network, Toronto. Donor lungs were retrieved
and preserved in cold low-potassium dextran solution (Perfadex®, XVIVO Perfu-
sion, CO, USA) on ice until arrival at our institution. The surgical techniques for
organ retrieval and EVLP were similar to those used in clinical practice39. Upon
arrival, lungs were separated, and both lungs were retrograde flushed using Per-
fadex®. Samples of the perfusate were collected, frozen at −80 °C for later analysis
of viral levels using Real Time® HCV PCR. Following the pre-EVLP flush, the lungs
were placed in two independent EVLP circuits for 9 h, using the Toronto EVLP
technique1.
Real Time HCV qPCR. Samples from donor blood, EVLP perfusate and lung tissue
were obtained. All blood samples were separated, and the serum was aliquoted and
kept at −80 °C until further testing. Tissue Viral RNA was extracted by the
QIAamp viral RNA purification protocol (Qiagen), after homogenization accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples were genotyped by the Inno-Lipa
HCV II test (Innogenetics, Zwijnaarde, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. HCV RNA is captured by a set of specific, synthetic oligonucleotide target
probes. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed, using the M2000 REAL-
TIME system (Abbott RealTime HCV, Abbott, IL, USA), and results depicted in
International Units Per Mililitre (IU/mL).
Infectivity assay. A modified version of Huh 7 hepatocyte cell line was used (Huh
7.5.1, CVCL_E049, kindly obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
Washington, USA https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/CVCL_E049), in DMEM
with 10% FBS and at 50% confluence were infected with perfusate from the mini-
EVLP or a known quantity of JFH1 HCV (virus obtained from Dr. Jake Liang,
National Institutes of Health). The cell medium was changed after 3 h and the cells
were then maintained at 37oC for 24 h, after which they were fixed with paraf-
ormaldehyde, permeabilized with NP-40 and stained with DAPI and anti-HCV
core antibodies at 33% (Anti-Hepatitis C Virus Core antibody, ab58713 Abcam).
Clusters or focus-forming units (FFU) were identified and counted using Image J®
software.
Albumin electrophoresis. Fresh perfusate was used to prime the miniaturized
circuit. After the system was warmed to 37 °C, 1.5 mL aliquots were taken at several
time points of light irradiation and analyzed using the Bolt™ 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus
Gels assay: 20 μl of 1:400 diluted in H2O Steen® solution were mixed with 16 μl of
SDS sample buffer (0.3 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, SDS [6.7% w/v], glycerol [10% v/v], 2-
mercaptoethanol [5.3% v/v] and bromophenol blue [0.2% w/v]), boiled for 5 min
and stored at 220oC until SDS PAGE electrophoresis, which was done by separ-
ating samples on Bolt™ 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus gels and stained with Simply Blue Safe
Stain (Invitrogen, # LC6060).
Large-animal transplant procedures. A total of 24 (12 donors and 12 recipients)
Yorkshire male pigs (30–35 kg) were used. All animals received humanized care
and all protocols were evaluated and approved by the Animal Care Committee,
Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, Toronto, following the Canadian
Council on Animal Care Certificate of Good Animal Practices Guidelines (https://
www.ccac.ca/en/program-features/certificate-of-gap-good-animal-practice.html).
Donor pigs were sedated with ketamine (20 mg/kg IM), midazolam (0.3 mg/kg,
IM) and atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV) and anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (3–5%)
for peripheral line insertion and intubation. The animals underwent tracheostomy
with a 7.5 Fr endotracheal tube and were then placed on a pressure-controlled
ventilator at pressure support of 15 cm H2O, PEEP of 5 cm H20, FiO2 of 0.5 and
respiratory rate of 12bpm. Anesthesia was maintained with Propofol (5–8 mg/kg/h
IV), and fentanyl citrate (2–20 μg/kg/h IV) or Remifentanil (9–30 μg/kg/hr IV).
Cefazolin 20 mg/kg IV and methylprednisolone 500 mg IV were administered prior
to skin incision. After baseline parameters and an assessment including blood gas
analysis, a median sternotomy was performed and sodium heparin (10,000 IU) was
injected systemically. The superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and aorta were
clamped, and the lungs were flushed through the pulmonary artery with 60 mL/kg

 of low-potassium dextran glucose preservation solution (Perfadex®) at 4 °C from a
height of 30 cm above the heart. The heart-lung block was removed in an inflated
state and preserved at 4 °C for 2 h. Following lung procurement and cold ischemic
time, the lung bloc was placed on EVLP for 6 h, using the Toronto EVLP
technique1.
Following EVLP, the recipient pig was sedated and anesthetized using the same
technique as for the donor pig. The transplant consisted of a left thoracotomy
through the fifth intercostal space. The pulmonary hilum was dissected, and the left
azygous vein was ligated. The inferior pulmonary ligament was divided. Both the
right and left main pulmonary arteries were carefully dissected. After administering
heparin, the left pneumonectomy was completed. The bronchial anastomosis was
performed first, with a continuous 4–0 synthetic, monofilament, non-absorbable
polypropylene suture interrupted in two places. The PA anastomosis was then
performed, with a continuous 5–0 synthetic, monofilament, non-absorbable
polypropylene suture, interrupted in two places. Left atrial anastomosis was then
performed with an everting continuous 5–0 synthetic, monofilament, non-
absorbable polypropylene suture interrupted in two places, after which the
transplanted lung was re-inflated with recruitment to a pressure of 25 cm H2O and
ventilated for 4 h, under the following ventilatory parameters: pressure-controlled
(PC) ventilation at pressure support of 15 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH20, FiO2 of 0.5
and respiratory rate of 15/min targeting tidal volumes of 6–8 ml/kg. The right
pulmonary artery was clamped 4 h after reperfusion to assess the function of the
(left) transplanted lung alone. After 4 h of functional assessment, the animals were
sacrificed by exsanguination.
Lung edema. Lung tissue biopsy samples were collected after 6 h of EVLP and 4 h
of reperfusion (post-transplant) and were used to assess lung edema (wet-dry ratio)
and histological lung injury. For wet-dry ratio, lung tissues were weighed fresh and
placed in an oven at 85 °C for 72 h to dry and re-weighed to calculate the level of
lung edema.
Acute lung injury assessments. Lung tissue samples were embedded in paraffin
after fixation in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h, followed by 5 μm thick sectioning
and H&E staining. Mid-sagittal sections were assessed in a blinded fashion (Y.W.).
We evaluated interstitial edema, intra-alveolar edema, hemorrhage, cell infiltration
and hyaline membrane formation. The severity of these findings was graded in a
four- point scale as follows: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate and 3, severe.
Cytokine assays. Lung tissues and perfusate samples stored at −80 °C were
evaluated for inflammatory response using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) for porcine IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, in tissue samples were homogenates.
Supernatants and perfusates were assayed using commercial ELISA kits for porcine
interleukin IL-1β (DY6226, IL-1 beta Pig ELISA Kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN), IL-6 (P6000B, Porcine IL-6 Immunoassay, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN),
and IL-8 (P8000, IL-8 beta Pig ELISA Kit, R&D Systems) according to the man-
ufacturers’ instructions. The final concentration was calculated by converting the
optical density (OD) readings against a standard curve.
Apoptosis assessment. Lung tissue biopsy samples were collected after 6 h of
EVLP and 4 h of reperfusion (post-transplant). These were stained with deox-
ynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy uridine triphosphate nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD; Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany). All TUNEL-stained slides were scanned using a whole-slide
fluorescence scanner (Axio Scan.Z1, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Ger-
many). TUNEL-positive cells were counted using commercial image-analysis
software (HALOTM Image Analysis Software, Pelkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and
expressed as a percentage of total cells.
In vitro clonogenic cells assay. The clonogenic assay of cells is considered the
gold standard to determine cell reproductive death after treatment with ionizing
radiation, but can also be used to determine the effectiveness of other cytotoxic
agents, such as photoproducts after ionizing radiation or PDT40. In this study the
cell handling, assay setup, fixation, staining and colony counting technique were
performed following published reference guidelines40. Human fibroblasts (LL24)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in
McCoy’s media supplemented with 15% of fetal bovine serum. Two-hundred cells
were seeded in 6-well Petri dishes and exposed to Steen® solution, previously
irradiated in the EVLP circuit with UVC or not, for 24 h. The media was then
replaced, and the cells were kept in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 12 days.
Colonies were then fixed with formalin, stained with crystal violet, imaged with a
stereomicroscope and counted using Image J® software. The plating efficiency and
the survival fractions were determined as following protocols published by Franken
and collaborators40.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean. Unpaired Student’s t test and Mann–Whitney nonparametric test were used
for comparisons between groups. For comparisons between groups at all time
points, two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used.
Significance was considered as p ≤ 0.05.
