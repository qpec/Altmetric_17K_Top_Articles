Recent studies have described a reduction in the rate of improve-
ment in American mortality. The pace of improvement is also slow
by international standards. This paper attempts to identify the
extent to which rising body mass index (BMI) is responsible for
reductions in the rate of mortality improvement in the United
States. The data for this study were obtained from subsequent
cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III, 1988–1994; NHANES continuous, 1999–2010) and from
the NHANES linked mortality files, which include follow-up into
death records through December 2011. The role of BMI was esti-
mated using Cox models comparing mortality trends in the presence
and absence of adjustment for maximum lifetime BMI (Max BMI).
Introducing Max BMI into a Cox model controlling for age and sex
raised the annual rate of mortality decline by 0.54% (95% confi-
dence interval 0.45–0.64%). Results were robust to the inclusion of
other variables in the model, to differences in how Max BMI was
measured, and to how trends were evaluated. The effect of rising
Max BMI is large relative to international mortality trends and to
alternative mortality futures simulated by the Social Security Ad-
ministration. The increase in Max BMI over the period 1988–
2011 is estimated to have reduced life expectancy at age 40 by
0.9 years in 2011 (95% confidence interval 0.7–1.1 years) and
accounted for 186,000 excess deaths that year. Rising levels of
BMI have prevented the United States from enjoying the full bene-
fits of factors working to improve mortality.

T
wo recent studies by the National Academy of Sciences
documented a slowdown in rates of mortality improvement in
the United States and an increasing US mortality disadvantage
relative to other wealthy countries (1, 2). Middle-aged white
populations, especially white women, have actually experienced
rising mortality over much of the past several decades (3–5).
Rising mortality rates occurred earlier and more dramatically in
many US counties (6, 7).
Causes of death implicated in the poor performance of mor-
tality indicators among US whites include accidental poisoning—
linked to the epidemic of prescription opioids—suicide, and
chronic liver disease (3, 5, 8, 9). The adverse trends in mortality
persist, however, even after removing the effects of these so-
called “deaths of despair,” suggesting that these causes do not
provide a complete explanation for the slowdown (4). Consistent
with this possibility, the steady declines in death rates from
cardiovascular disease that have been observed for nearly 40 y
have decelerated or halted altogether (4, 8, 10). Death rates
from heart disease at ages 50–54 in the United States declined at
a slower rate than in any of 13 comparison countries between
1999 and 2015 (8). Rates of decline in cancer mortality were also
comparatively slow in the United States (8).
A leading candidate to account for the poor performance of
mortality indicators in the United States is a rise in the prevalence
of obesity. The age-standardized prevalence of obesity in US
adults based on examination-measured height and weight in-
creased from 15% in 1976–1980 to 38% in 2013–2014 (11, 12).
Obesity is associated with a variety of outcomes, including
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality
(13–17). A growing body of evidence indicates that these asso-
ciations may be causal (18–21). Ma et al. (10) suggest that the
recent attenuation in declining death rates for heart disease,
stroke, and diabetes may reflect the lagged consequences of in-
creased obesity prevalence. Other analysts have endorsed this
suggestion (6, 22, 23), including Tom Frieden, then Director of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (24). One sug-
gestive association is that, among rich countries, the prevalence
of adult obesity is highest in the United States (25). The increase
in mean BMI in the United States in recent decades was also
larger than in comparable European countries (26, 27).
In this paper, we used nationally representative data on the
US adult population to estimate the contribution of changes in
body mass index (BMI) to trends in US mortality at ages 40–
84 during the period 1988–2011.
Data and Methods
To assess the role of BMI in recent national mortality trends, we combined
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III
pertaining to the period 1988–1994 and data from the NHANES for the
period 1999–2011 (28, 29). NHANES is a nationally representative survey of
the noninstitutionalized US population and includes a questionnaire as well
as clinical and laboratory components. The latest year to which NHANES
surveys have been linked to death records from the National Death Index is
2011. We restricted the sample to medically examined adults eligible for
mortality follow-up aged 40–79 without missing data on maximum BMI (n =
931) or missing data on sex, race/ethnicity, education, and smoking status
(n = 71). We also excluded 19 individuals considered underweight, i.e.,
having values of max BMI below 18.5, and 17 individuals with max BMI
Significance
Some have speculated that the rising prevalence of obesity may
explain why the rate of mortality improvement in the United
States has declined relative to other wealthy countries. This
paper estimates that rising body mass index (BMI) has reduced
the annual rate of improvement in US death rates between 1988
and 2011 by more than half a percentage point—equivalent to a
23% relative reduction in the rate of mortality decline—a large
amount by international standards. The increase in BMI has
reduced life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 years in 2011 and
accounted for 186,000 excess deaths that year. Rising BMI has
prevented the United States from enjoying the full benefits of
factors working to improve mortality.

 above 75. The final sample consists of 25,269 individuals, experiencing
4,620 deaths over 230,728 person-years of exposure.
Our indicator of BMI combined an individual’s reported maximum weight
(exclusive of pregnancy) with measured height at survey to calculate maxi-
mum body mass index (Max BMI). Using model selection criteria, this vari-
able has repeatedly been shown to be superior to BMI at baseline in
predicting mortality (15, 17). One suggested reason for its superior perfor-
mance is that it is less susceptible to weight loss associated with illness, which
biases estimates of mortality associated with baseline BMI. Another reason is
that it conveys important elements of weight history which may have en-
during effects on health (30). In the present analysis, we transformed Max
BMI to reflect the number of BMI units above 25 kg/m2, with values between
18.5–25 kg/m2 assigned to zero. A BMI value of 25 represents the beginning
of the “Overweight” range as defined by the World Health Organization.
We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the relation be-
tween Max BMI and mortality, using time since survey as exposure time.
Individuals remained exposed to the risk of death until they were censored by
death, by reaching January 1, 2012, or by reaching age 85. A key variable is
“calendar year,” a numeric value that corresponds to a particular year of
exposure to the risk of death. After initial assignment to a particular year at
survey, the “calendar year” variable increases by 1 y for each year of follow-
up. Since the Cox model predicts the natural log of the death rate, the co-
efficient of “calendar year” is the estimated annual rate of mortality decline
during the period under study. The focus of this paper is on how the rate of
mortality change is altered when Max BMI is introduced into the model.
The effect of Max BMI on the mortality trend was first established using a
model that controls only age and sex. We do not employ cohort identifiers in
the models so we do not encounter the age-period-cohort identification
problem. We subsequently introduced three other sets of variables into the
model: race/ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, other);
educational attainment (<9 y, 9–11 y, 12 y, some college or an associate’s
degree, 4-y college graduate); and smoking status (never, former, current).
These variables are correlated with BMI and with the risk of death and,
therefore, potentially confound the estimated impact of BMI as well as its
effects on mortality trends (30). In preliminary analyses, we evaluated inter-
actions between Max BMI and calendar year and between Max BMI and
smoking. The interactions, shown in Table S3, were insignificant and not
retained in subsequent analyses. A second-degree term in Max BMI was also
insignificant and was dropped.
Using national vital statistics from the Human Mortality Database (31), we
calculated trends in age-standardized death rates over the same range of ages
and years included in the NHANES analysis. We did this for the United States
and 15 comparison countries chosen for their social and economic similarity to
the United States. Rates were standardized using the age distribution of the
United States in 2000. The rate of mortality change was estimated by an or-
dinary least squares linear regression of ln DR(t) on t, where DR(t) is the death
rate in year t, t = 1988. . .2011. To avoid any influence from changing sex
composition, DR(t) is the mean of male and female death rates.
We estimated the effect of changing Max BMI on national life expectancy
over the period. To do so, we applied two sets of NHANES-based mortality
changes to the US age-specific death rates in the official life table of 1988, one
with and one without Max BMI controlled, and compared the projected life
expectancies in 2011. Since our analysis did not extend beyond age 85, we
used the actual mortality level in the official US life table for 2011 above age
85 to derive our projected life expectancies (32).
We explored the sensitivity of results to the following changes in
procedure:
i) We treated time as a dichotomous variable rather than as a continuous
variable by constructing observations for two baseline periods, 1988–
1994 and 1999–2006. We censored individuals after 5 y of exposure so
that data structures in the two periods were identical.
ii) We treated max BMI as a categorical variable using the World Health
Organization-recommended BMI categories of <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–
29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9, and ≥40. This model added 19 observations to
the dataset, those with max BMI < 18.5.
iii) We investigated the effect of introducing an interaction between max
BMI and age in its effect on mortality trends.
iv) We investigated the effect on estimated mortality trends of measuring
Max BMI from a value of 18.5, the start of the “normal” BMI category
recommended by the World Health Organization, rather than 25.0, the
start of the overweight category.
Data analyses were performed using Stata version 15 (StataCorp), and all
estimates were adjusted for the complex survey design of the NHANES.
Variances were estimated with the SVY routine, which uses Taylor series
linearization. Bootstrapping was performed to generate 95% confidence
intervals on the estimate of the change in the coefficient of calendar year
when Max BMI is introduced into a model including age, sex, and date of
observation, as well as on the estimate of the subsequent change in life
expectancy (33). We used the simulate command in Stata to perform
1,000 simulations, resampling with replacement.
Results
Table 1 shows some of the major characteristics of the cohorts
under study. Between 1988 and 1994 and 2005 and 2010, the
proportion of the US adult population aged 40–79 that had been
obese at some point in their lives increased from 40 to 52% while
the proportion reporting a history of smoking declined from
60 to 50%.
Fig. 1 shows annual rates of mortality decline at ages 40–84 in
16 countries between 1988 and 2011. At 1.53%/y, the United
States had the slowest decline in mortality. The mean rate of
decline for the remaining 15 countries was 2.21%/y.
Table 2 presents the rate of mortality decline in different
models before and after the introduction of Max BMI. The
models themselves are presented in Tables S1 and S2. The rate of
mortality decline in a model including only age, sex, and date of
observation was 0.0181, which is within one SD of the 0.0153 rate
observed using national vital statistics. When Max BMI was in-
troduced into the model including age, sex, and date of observa-
tion, the increase in the rate of mortality decline was 0.0054, with a
95% confidence interval on the change of 0.0045–0.0064. Thus,
rising Max BMI is estimated to have slowed the annual rate of
mortality decline during this period by 0.54%. This is equivalent to
a 23% [(0.0054/0.0235) × 100] relative reduction in the rate of
mortality decline as a result of rising obesity.
Across the five models shown in Table 2, the change in the
coefficient of calendar year when Max BMI was introduced
ranged only from 0.52 to 0.57%. Introducing smoking into a
model that included all other variables changed the implied rate
of decline from 1.70 to 1.47%. So it appears that rising Max BMI
had a negative effect on mortality trends that was roughly double
the positive effect of reduced smoking.
Table 3 presents results equivalent to those in Table 2 for
several alternative models, all of which included age, sex, race/
ethnicity, educational attainment, and smoking. Alternative A
uses a dichotomous time variable and limits mortality follow-up
to 5 y for each survey wave. The annual rate of mortality change
was estimated as [ln B]/11.57, where B is the coefficient of the
variable representing the later period and 11.57 is the mean
number of years separating the two sets of observations. The rate
of mortality decline in the dichotomous-time specification before
the addition of max BMI was 0.95%, compared with 0.90% in
the comparable preferred model. The equivalent values after the
introduction of Max BMI are 1.43% and 1.47%, respectively.
The remaining alternatives also induced little change in the
estimated impact of including Max BMI. Alternative B in Table
3 used categorical values of Max BMI rather than continuous
values. The change in the rate of mortality decline when the
categorical values were introduced was 0.55%/y, compared with
0.57%/y in the preferred model. Alternative C added an in-
teraction term between Max BMI and age. The interaction term
was significant but its inclusion had only a small effect on the
impact of Max BMI. In alternative D, we measured Max BMI
from 18.5 rather than 25.0 with little effect.
To estimate the effect of rising BMI on life expectancy, we
compared results using the rates of mortality reduction in the
model controlling only age and sex to those in the model con-
trolling age, sex, and Max BMI. If age-specific death rates had
fallen at the BMI-uncontrolled rate of 1.81%/y, life expectancy at
age 40 would have risen from 37.6 y in 1988 (34) to 41.4 y in
2011. If death rates had fallen at the BMI-controlled rate of
2.35%/y, life expectancy at age 40 in 2011 would have risen to

 42.3 y. This comparison suggests that rising BMI reduced gains in
life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 y over this period, with a confi-
dence interval on the effect of introducing Max BMI of 0.7–1.1 y.
Note that actual US life expectancy in 2011 at age 40 was 40.6 y
(32), so the actual gain in life expectancy was 3.0 y vs. our
modeled gain of 3.8 y. This discrepancy is consistent with slightly
faster declines noted earlier in age-standardized death rates in
NHANES than in national vital statistics.
As a final check on the plausibility of our estimates, we
combined directly observed changes in the Max BMI variable
with the coefficient representing the estimated effect of Max
BMI on mortality. As shown in Table 1, the mean value of Max
BMI (measured from a starting value of 25) rose from 5.00 in
1988–94 to 6.93 in 2005–10, or by 1.93 units. The coefficient of
Max BMI in the regression that also includes age, sex, and the
mortality trend is 0.0433 (Table 2). Combining these two values
gives a predicted change in the natural log of the death rate of
0.0433 × 1.93 = 0.0836. The mean length of time between the
two sets of observations is 16.51 y, so the estimated effect on the
annual rate of mortality change is 0.0836/16.51 = 0.51%. This
value is closely aligned with the estimates shown in Tables 2 and
3, which range from 0.48 to 0.57%. Those latter estimates utilize
substantially more detail on the exact timing of exposure and
death during the 1988–2011 period.
Discussion
It has been widely speculated that a rising prevalence of obesity
is responsible for slowing gains in mortality and life expectancy
in the United States. Such a relationship was predicted by
Olshansky et al. (35) and has been hypothesized by several other
analysts. The present paper is an effort to quantify the impact of
rising obesity in recent decades on national mortality trends.
We estimate that rising Max BMI during the period 1988–
2011 has lowered the rate of decline in US age-standardized death
rates by ∼0.5–0.6%/y. The estimate is robust to the inclusion of
other major drivers of national mortality levels, including smoking,
educational attainment, and racial composition. It is also robust to
alternative ways of operationalizing BMI and identifying trends.
Is a difference in rates of mortality decline of 0.5–0.6%/y large
or small? One useful metric is provided by mortality projections

 done by the US Social Security Administration. In their most re-
cent projections, the intermediate rate of mortality decline pro-
jected between 2013 and 2040 for all ages combined is 0.91%,
whereas the low-cost alternative rate of decline is 0.45% (36). This
difference of 0.46% is slightly smaller than the estimated effect of
rising BMI on recent trends in mortality. At ages 65+, the differ-
ence between intermediate and low-cost projections is 0.42%, also
below the estimated impact of rising BMI. So the rise in BMI
appears to be a powerful factor in mortality relative to the amount
of uncertainty embedded in Social Security projections.
A second metric is international. The SD of national rates of
mortality decline shown in Fig. 1 is 0.30%. So rising BMI in the
United States has generated an effect on mortality decline (0.50–
0.60%) that is close to two international SD units. Relative to
observed international variation in rates of mortality improvement,
the effect of increasing body mass indices in the United States
is large.
A third metric is the number of excess deaths. If death rates
had declined since 1988 at the Max BMI-controlled rate of
2.35% rather than the uncontrolled rate of 1.81%, there would
have been ∼88.3% {e−[0.0054(23)]} as many deaths at ages 40–
84 in 2011 as actually occurred that year (37). So in the age in-
terval 40–84, we estimate that rising BMI is responsible for
11.7% of the 1,590,254 deaths, or a total of 186,000 excess
deaths, in 2011 alone. The total number of deaths in 2011 at all
ages combined was 2,515,458, so the excess deaths attributable to
rising Max BMI at ages 40–84 represent 7.4% of the total deaths
in the United States in 2011 (37).
The finding that rising BMI has translated into population-
level effects is notable given the increased adoption of pharmaco-
logical treatments for several obesity-related chronic conditions,
including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, over the
period of investigation. It is possible that the increased uptake of
these medications has blunted the impact of rising obesity (38).
However, we did not find any evidence of secular declines in the
individual-level associations between Max BMI and mortality.
The present study has several limitations. First, we treated
BMI as a causal variable in its relation to mortality. BMI itself is
an amalgam of genes, diet, and physical activity (13). In this
paper, we do not attempt to identify the factors that help to
produce high levels of BMI, factors which may have their own
impact on mortality. Our results are based on observational data
rather than on randomized trials. Many unmeasured factors,
such as childhood poverty, may be positively correlated with BMI
and, independently, with mortality. Their absence from the re-
gression model is likely to bias upwards the estimated effect of
rising BMI on mortality trends. The fact that introducing key
socio-economic variables—educational attainment and race/
ethnicity—into the model had almost no effect on the estimated
impact of Max BMI on mortality trends is one indication that
omitted socioeconomic variables may also have relatively little
effect, but there is no assurance that the effect would be small.
The single most important risk factor in US mortality, ciga-
rette smoking, is negatively correlated with Max BMI (39).
Smoking is a complex exposure with multiple dimensions of
duration and intensity and is difficult to measure precisely in self-
reported data. Because of smoking’s negative correlation with
BMI, measurement error in our smoking variable is likely to bias
downward the estimated impact of BMI on mortality and mor-
tality trends (40). The net effect of these several biases is difficult
to predict (30).
A second limitation is that our estimated annual rate of mor-
tality decline among US adults using NHANES was somewhat
faster than that estimated using data from vital statistics, although
the latter value is within one SE of the former. That national vital
statistics include the institutionalized population and NHANES
does not may account for some of the discrepancy. Nonresponse
in NHANES surveys may also play a role (41). Finally, our estimated

 impact of rising BMI on the number of deaths at ages 40–84 and on
life expectancy at age 40 assumes that its impact is constant across
these ages, an assumption that may or may not be accurate.
Conclusion
During the past several decades, rising levels of BMI have re-
duced rates of improvement in age-specific death rates and in life
expectancy in the United States. The effect of rising BMI is quite
large relative to international mortality trends and to alternative
mortality futures simulated by the Social Security Administra-
tion. We estimate that rising Max BMI over the period 1988–
2011 has reduced life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 y in 2011 and
accounted for roughly 186,000 excess deaths that year. The
headwinds posed by increasing levels of BMI have prevented the
United States from enjoying the full benefits of factors working
to improve mortality, including reductions in smoking and ad-
vances in medical technology. Continued increases in BMI would
threaten future gains in life expectancy as well (42).
