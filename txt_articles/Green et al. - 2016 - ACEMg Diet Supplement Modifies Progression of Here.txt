Dietary supplements consisting of beta-carotene (precursor to vitamin A), vitamins C and E and the 
mineral magnesium (ACEMg) can be beneficial for reducing hearing loss due to aminoglycosides and 
overstimulation. This regimen also slowed progression of deafness for a boy with GJB2 (CONNEXIN 
26) mutations. To assess the potential for treating GJB2 and other forms of hereditary hearing loss 
with ACEMg, we tested the influence of ACEMg on the cochlea and hearing of mouse models for two 
human mutations: GJB2, the leading cause of childhood deafness, and DIAPH3, a cause of auditory 
neuropathy. One group of mice modeling GJB2 (Gjb2-CKO) received ACEMg diet starting shortly after 
they were weaned (4 weeks) until 16 weeks of age. Another group of Gjb2-CKO mice received ACEMg in 
utero and after weaning. The ACEMg diet was given to mice modeling DIAPH3 (Diap3-Tg) after weaning 
(4 weeks) until 12 weeks of age. Control groups received food pellets without the ACEMg supplement. 
Hearing thresholds measured by auditory brainstem response were significantly better for Gjb2-CKO 
mice fed ACEMg than for the control diet group. In contrast, Diap3-Tg mice displayed worse thresholds 
than controls. These results indicate that ACEMg supplementation can influence the progression of 
genetic hearing loss.
Congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common sensory deficit in the US, affecting at least 
0.1% of all children1. In developed countries, genetic mutations account for more than half of all cases of con-
genital SNHL. Not all neonates with SNHL are profoundly deaf and some mutations may not lead to measurable 
hearing loss until later in life2–4. For these cases, it is important to identify therapies that prevent progression and 
reverse loss of functionality. Gene therapy approaches aimed at these goals are under investigation in many labs5–9 
but are not yet ready for clinical use. In this study, we examined the potential of an alternative strategy of dietary 
supplementation to enhance the overall homeostatic health of cells in the cochlea in order to improve their func-
tion and slow or prevent their pathology.
A common factor in hearing loss caused by overstimulation or ototoxicity is the generation of free radicals 
and oxidative stress10–15. Antioxidants have been shown to reduce the impact of oxidative stress in neuronal dis-
orders16–19, cancer20–22, heart disease23,24, inflammatory diseases25–27, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries28,29. In the 
inner ear, reduction of oxidative stress related to overstimulation or aminoglycoside ototoxicity has been demon-
strated to protect the sensory hair cells and hearing12,30,31. Treatment with antioxidants also has been shown to 
preserve gap junction function32,33, which is especially relevant because mutations in GJB2, which encodes the 
gap junction protein CONNEXIN 26 (Cx26), account for over half of all hereditary deafness cases34. With dys-
functional gap junctions in the cochlea, it would be especially important to remove the excessive potassium ions, 
thereby protecting mitochondria from damage that can be caused by this potent free radical35.
Additional motivation for investigating the efficacy of antioxidant supplements in remediation of genetic hear-
ing loss was the positive effect of a diet augmented with antioxidants (vitamin A precursor, C and E) and a vasodi-
lator (magnesium), hereafter ACEMg, on a human patient with progressive Cx26 hearing loss36. Administration 
of this regimen over a three-year period not only stopped the progression of hearing loss, but also resulted in 
a small hearing improvement. In light of these results, we assessed the influence of this potentially protective 
ACEMg dietary supplement on the progression of hearing loss in mouse models for two different forms of human 
hereditary deafness: Cx26 and AUNA1.
The Gjb2-CKO model was chosen because of the high frequency of mutations of the gene encoding this pro-
tein. The carrier rate of GJB2 mutations known to cause Cx26 related deafness is greater than 3% of all individuals 
in the United States and is among the highest of any disease37. Many individuals with GJB2 mutations are not

profoundly deaf and their hearing is typically stable38. However, in other cases, the hearing loss is relentlessly pro-
gressive39,40. Moreover, some profoundly deaf children, with biallelic GJB2 mutations, pass their newborn hearing 
screening, indicative of near normal hearing at birth, and then have subsequent degradation of hearing41,42. These 
patterns suggest that cells present at birth may be amenable to rescue.
The AUNA1 model (Diap3-Tg) was chosen because it is progressive, indicating there are cells present to be 
rescued, but the role of the protein and the consequences of the mutation are very different in nature from the 
connexin mutation. AUNA1 is a very rare form of progressive hearing loss with late onset in humans, typically 
developing in the second decade of life2–4. Clinical manifestation of AUNA1 is typical of auditory neuropathy 
where outer hair cell function is initially preserved but the function of the auditory nerve is impaired. As the 
hearing loss progresses, outer hair cell function also is affected4. The progression is rapid, and profound deafness 
typically results within 20 years3,4.
We provided the ACEMg enhanced diet to mice with a conditional deletion of Gjb2 (Gjb2-CKO) beginning at 
4 weeks, one week after weaning. In a second group of Gjb2-CKO mice, the enhanced diet was provide to mothers 
beginning 1 week prior to mating and the offspring were weaned onto that diet. The Gjb2-CKO mice given the 
enhanced diet after weaning had profound hearing loss before initiating the enhanced diet, but their hearing 
loss did not progress and a small yet significant improvement was seen. The Gjb2-CKO mice whose mothers 
received the enhanced diet during gestation had slightly better hearing at 4 weeks than offspring of mothers fed 
the standard diet and their hearing loss neither worsened nor improved subsequently. Hearing loss in control 
animals continued to demonstrate deterioration. In contrast, the hearing loss of Diap3-Tg mice given the ACEMg 
beginning at 4 weeks of age progressed much more rapidly compared to Diap3-Tg mice given control diet. These 
results suggest that dietary supplementation can influence the inner ear phenotype caused by mutations and that 
the influence can be negative or positive depending on the mutation.
Results
General Health. 
The mice given the ACEMg diet did not have any apparent negative health defects and 
gained weight appropriately. Pregnant breeder mice demonstrated no apparent adverse effects from the ACEMg 
diet. Mouse litters consisted of both homozygous and heterozygous pups at the expected 1:1 ratio (38/78 mouse 
pups were homozygotes). Pups were born without any readily apparent health defects. The mice were small but 
gained weight well. The ACEMg diet did not negatively affect litter size, pup weight, or health. The feces of the 
mice given the ACEMg diet were orange in color due to the vitamins, but they were normal in consistency.
Mice in the prenatal ACEMg diet group had higher mortality under anesthesia than did control mice. Of the 
first 16 mice in the prenatal ACEMg diet group, 7 died under anesthesia given for ABR testing. No control diet 
mice died under anesthesia. The increased anesthesia-related mortality may have been due to peripheral vaso-
dilation caused by the anesthetic regimen combined with the diuretic effect from vitamin C and vasodilation 
induced by magnesium. The increased anesthetic mortality rate was resolved by giving subcutaneous fluids prior 
to ABR testing and yohimbine (7 mg/kg) after completion of ABR testing. This modified protocol was used with 
all subsequent mice in all diet groups and no additional mice died under anesthesia.
ABR Data. 
The 4 week thresholds of Gjb2-CKO mice in all groups were variable with a standard deviation of 
approximately 10 dB at each frequency. All Gjb2-CKO mice had substantial hearing loss at this early age. In some 
cases, thresholds could not be detected even at the maximum stimulation level.
Gjb2-CKO Mice, Post-Weaning Intervention. 
Because allocation of mice to experimental groups was 
blind to their 4 week hearing threshold, and was conducted over several weeks, statistical analysis of differences 
between mice assigned to those groups was not performed until all mice had been assigned to a group. That 
statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in ABR thresholds between the mice that were assigned to the 
two diet groups (F3,10 = 
 5.86, p = 
 0.014). Post hoc analyses showed that animals switched to the enhanced diet 
had higher average thresholds at 12 kHz than animals switched to the control diet; significant differences were not 
found at 16 kHz or 24 kHz (Fig. 1A).
At 16 weeks of age (after 12 weeks on the diets), the change over 12 weeks differed significantly between diets 
(F3,10 = 
 9.76, p = 
 0.0026). On average, thresholds of animals on the ACEMg diet decreased (i.e. improved) more 
than 10 dB at 12 and 16 kHz, whereas average thresholds of animals on the control diet increased (i.e. worsened) 
at least 2 dB at those same frequencies (Fig. 1B). These differences were statistically significant by sequential 
Bonferroni criteria. At 24 kHz, both groups had positive threshold shifts that were not significantly different.
Gjb2-CKO Mice, Prenatal Intervention. 
We performed a 3-way analysis comparing hearing at 4 weeks 
of age in the two prenatal groups (control and enhanced diet) and all animals on standard diet until 4 weeks 
(before they were switched to control or enhanced diets) and did not find a significant effect of diet in this 3-way 
test (F6,80 = 
 1.72, p = 
 0.13). The two most different groups were the prenatal ACEMg group and the standard diet 
group (Fig. 2). Post hoc pairwise tests, using the sequential Bonferroni criterion for significance showed that there 
was a difference between the prenatal ACEMg group and the standard diet group (F3,27 = 
 3.72, p = 
 0.023), but not 
between prenatal ACEMg and prenatal control groups, or between prenatal control and the standard diet groups.
In both prenatal groups, threshold shifts between 4 and 12 weeks were small and not significantly different 
(F3,26 = 
 1.56, p = 
 0.22). In fact, neither group had appreciable change over this interval (Fig. 3). The animals in 
both prenatal intervention groups tended to have lower thresholds at 12 weeks of age than animals switched onto 
those diets from standard chow for 12 weeks (Fig. 4). At their ending time points, the prenatal ACEMg group 
had the lowest (i.e. best) average thresholds at all three frequencies. The difference between prenatal ACEMg and 
prenatal control diet groups was significant (F3,26 = 
 3.42, p = 
 0.032). Thresholds of the prenatal control group 
were not different from either post-weaning group. Differences between the prenatal ACEMg group and both

post-weaning groups were significant (F9,120 = 
 2.92, p = 
 0.0036), mainly due to large differences at 24 kHz (prena-
tal ACEMg vs post-weaning ACEMg p = 
 0.0096; prenatal ACEMg vs post-weaning control p = 
 0.00206).
Diap3-Tg Mice, Post-Weaning Intervention. 
At 4 weeks of age, prior to the start of treatment with the 
diet, mice underwent ABR testing. Initial thresholds of Diap3-Tg mice were highly variable, means of mice allo-
cated to the control or ACEMg diets differed by 4 dB, which was not significant (F3,7 = 
 0.81, p = 
 0.53). After 8 
weeks on the diet (12 weeks of age), both diet groups exhibited large threshold shifts compared to the 4 week time 
Figure 1. Post-weaning dietary supplement slowed or reversed hearing loss in Gjb2-CKO mutant mice. 
(A) ABR thresholds at 4 weeks of age demonstrate substantial hearing loss prior to supplementation, and a small 
pre-treatment difference between groups assigned to the two diets, which was significant only at 12 kHz. (B) Changes 
in ABR thresholds between 4 and 16 weeks of age were significantly different between the diet groups, with ACEMg

point, but the threshold shifts were significantly higher (i.e. worse) in mice given the ACEMg diet than in mice 
given the control diet (F3,7 = 
 4.55, p = 
 0.045). Mice given the enhanced diet had an average shift of 32 dB across 
frequencies, more than twice that experienced by mice on the control diet (Fig. 5A), resulting in a more severe 
hearing loss (Fig. 5B).
Histology. 
Post-weaning Intervention Gjb2-CKO Mice. Epifluorescence examination of phalloidin-labeled 
whole mounts of the organ of Corti revealed substantial loss of hair cells in both the mice on the control and the 
ACEMg diet (Fig. 6). In the basal turn of the cochlea > 
2.47 mm from the apex, no hair cells were seen in mice in 
either diet group. At < 
2.47 mm from the apex, there was some hair cell preservation, but it was not significantly 
different between diet groups for inner or outer hair cells (inners p = 
 0.66, outers p = 
 0.57).
Prenatal Intervention Gjb2-CKO Mice. Mice raised on either diet also had nearly complete inner hair cell loss 
> 
3.42 mm from the apex (Fig. 7). Between 3.04 and 3.42 mm, difference in inner hair cell survival was not signif-
icant, but in the larger region < 
3.04 mm, mice raised on the ACEMg diet did have greater inner hair cell preser-
vation (p = 
 0.043). Greater hair cell survival in this region is consistent with the ABR results showing these mice 
had better hearing at the lowest frequency tested (12 kHz), which is the one transduced in the region closest to the 
apex. There was no significant difference in outer hair cell preservation between mice on the ACEMg diet and the 
mice on the control diet in any region of the cochlea.
Diap3-Tg Mice. Hair cells of Diap3-Tg animals were not counted, but qualitative images were obtained from 6 
mice; 2 given the ACEMg diet and 4 given the control diet (Fig. 8). There was a notable difference in the quality 
of the organ of Corti in the mid apex between the mice given the control diet (Fig. 8A) and the mice given the 
ACEMg diet (Fig. 8B) with mice on the control diet retaining a higher proportion of hair cells.
Discussion
A diet supplemented with ACEMg was given to two mouse models for human hereditary deafness (GJB2 and 
AUNA1) to test whether the diet would influence the progression of hearing loss and associated inner ear pathol-
ogy. In the Gjb2-CKO mice, the ACEMg diet reduced the progression of hearing loss and elicited a small, but 
significant improvement in hearing thresholds. This functional improvement was associated with mild but

significant enhancement of hair cell preservation. In contrast, the diet had a deleterious effect in the Diap3-Tg 
mouse (AUNA1), exacerbating hearing loss in comparison to Diap3-Tg mice given the control diet.
Absence of gap junctions containing Cx26, due to GJB2 mutations, may lead to chemical imbalances in 
extracellular space surrounding hair cells, and ultimately to hair cell death and hearing loss. Mutations in GJB2 
decrease effective shuttling of cellular by-products, including K+ and other free radicals, by the supporting cells43. 
Increased oxidative stress may result from the local extracellular accumulation of potassium ions and reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) associated with the absence of Cx2644. Several different potassium ion channels are present 
in mitochondrial membranes45,46 and contribute to mitochondrial function47 and their role in the demise of cells 
when potassium levels are excessive48. The stress induced by the excessive potassium may also increase phagocytic 
activity of Deiters cells, reported to be part of the process of eliminating hair cells49,50. The improvement seen in 
these mice is consistent with the hypothesis that antioxidant supplements should reduce the oxidative stress and 
hair cell loss. Previous studies demonstrated that systemically administered ACEMg reduces intense noise- and 
aminoglycoside-induced free radical formation in the supporting cells and hair cells51,52. Here we demonstrate 
that ACEMg may be effective in reducing cell death and hearing impairment associated with the hereditary deaf-
ness induced by Cx26 mutations.
In contrast to the positive results seen in the Gjb2-CKO mice, the ACEMg diet had a detrimental effect 
on mice with AUNA1 hearing loss. These mice exhibited more severe progression of hearing loss than mice 
given the control diet. AUNA1 mutation leads to overexpression of Diap3 (human DIAPH3), a ubiqui-
tously expressed member of a group of proteins that are important in regulation of actin networks53. In the 
ear, overexpression of the protein causes profound abnormalities in the stereocilia of the IHC and loss of 
IHC-auditory nerve synapses3. Outer hair cell function is preserved, but IHC and auditory nerve function 
is disrupted. We hypothesize that the detrimental effects of the ACEMg supplement in the inner ears of 
Diap3-Tg mice reflect amplification of the overexpression that produces the abnormalities in the IHC and/
or auditory nerve.
Specifically tailored nutritional supplementation has been shown to be of benefit for some forms of deafness 
when it addresses the underlying metabolic abnormality. For instance, hearing loss and cretinism that are asso-
ciated with iodine deficiency can be readily prevented by dietary supplementation54. However, supplements may 
have unintended negative effects. In our study, antioxidant supplements improved hearing in a mutation expected 
to increase oxidative stress, but worsened hearing in a mutation that overexpresses a protein. When the specific 
function of Diaph3 is elucidated, it may shed light on the reasons for the negative influence of the ACEMg diet 
on the hearing of these mutant mice. The detrimental outcome of the ACEMg diet on the hearing of Diap3-Tg

mutant animals alerts to the fact that diet supplementation can have a negative impact and highlights the need to 
test outcomes of supplementation and tailor supplement regimens for specific mutations.
Our Gjb2-CKO mice exhibit severe hearing loss soon after weaning. The deafness progresses with age and is 
accompanied by progressive hair cell loss and auditory nerve degeneration55. Thus, these mice exhibit a pheno-
type that is much more severe than most human cases of Cx26-related hearing loss. However, our mouse model 
may more closely resemble the subset of human cases that does have severe deafness at birth and subsequent 
progression. In a child with a more severe, rapidly progressing Cx26 hearing loss, treatment with an ACEMg reg-
imen over a period of 3 years halted the progression and produced a slight improvement in hearing36. The small 
improvements seen in this case, and in our mice, can have a substantial impact on functionality, quality of life, 
educational opportunities, income, and ability to integrate into society56,57. The significant benefits demonstrated 
hold out the promise that antioxidants may be effective for treating progressive Cx26-related hearing loss in chil-
dren. The lack of side effects provides strong incentive to further investigate the mechanism and the clinical utility 
of providing ACEMg to GJB2 patients.
In conclusion, ACEMg significantly influenced deafness progression in the cochleae of both Gjb2-CKO and 
Diap3-mice. In Diap3-Tg mice, there was a deleterious effect whereas in Gjb2-CKO mice there was significant 
improvement of auditory thresholds. These data link dietary supplements with modulation of phenotypes in 
hereditary deafness and suggest that effects may vary depending on the mutation. The positive influence of

deafness.
Methods
Animals. 
Animal care, handling and all procedures described in this work were performed using accepted 
veterinary standards and were approved by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals of the 
University of Michigan.
The Gjb2-CKO mouse model is a conditional knockout developed by crossing Cx26loxp/loxp mice with two lox 
sites around exon 2 of the GJB2 gene44 and Sox10Cre mice58. In the cochlear epithelium area, Sox10 is expressed 
in the non-sensory cells around the organ of Corti59. The two lines were outcrossed to develop wild type mice 
then the wild type mice were crossed in order to achieve a double transgenic mouse (Cx26Sox10Cre), as previously 
described55. The heterozygous mutant mice did not have significantly different thresholds from the wild type 
mice, however, the homozygous mutant mice exhibit profound, progressive hearing loss, representative of the 
worst-case hearing impairment in humans with GJB2 mutations. Only the homozygous mice were used in this 
study on the ability of the ACEMg diet to prevent hearing loss in this Gjb2-CKO mouse.
The AUNA1 mouse model, Diap3-Tg, developed by Schoen et al.3, is a transgenic mouse in which overex-
pression of Diap3 (the ortholog of human DIAPH3) is driven by the immediate-early enhancer of the HCMV 
(human cytomegalovirus) with chicken BETA-ACTIN/rabbit BETA-GLOBIN hybrid (CAG) promoter. FVB/
NJ mice were mated with the surviving founders and two lines of offspring with the transgene exhibited hear-
ing loss within 16 weeks of age. In these mice, Diap3 overexpression causes progressively severe abnormali-
ties in the stereocilia of the inner hair cells and loss of inner hair cell synapses with the auditory nerve. Line 
FVB-Tg(CAG-Diap3)924Lesp/J was selected for use in this study because the mice presented with severe hearing 
loss (35 dB) at 16 weeks of age, but had no significant hearing loss at 4 or 8 weeks of age.
In all groups, litters were weaned at 3 weeks of age and genotyped. Genomic DNA was prepared from the pups 
by incubation of ear biopsies in DNA extraction buffer. DNA was amplified by PCR under standard conditions. 
For Gjb2-CKO mice, the homozygous pups were identified and used in the study; heterozygous mouse pups were 
excluded. All Diap3-Tg mice with the transgene were identified and used in the study.
Diet Supplement and Regimen. 
An experimental diet enhanced with vitamin A precursor beta-carotene, 
vitamins C, E, and magnesium (ACEMg) (Harlan Teklad Diet TD.110032) and a control diet (Harlan Teklad 
Diet TD.110031) were developed. The ACEMg diet was a tocopherol-stripped soy-based diet supplemented with

cochlear apex for Gjb2-CKO mice in post-weaning (A,B) and pre-natal (C,D) intervention groups. Regions 
farther from the apex than those shown averaged 100% hair cell loss. Significant reduction of hair cell loss was 
seen only in inner hair cells of the preweaning intervention group (C), and then only in the region < 
3.04 mm 
from the apex.

1.05 g/kg consumer supplied beta-carotene (Kingchem, Allendale, NJ), 10.29 g/kg vitamin C, 7.76 g/kg vitamin E, 
and 13.48 g/kg magnesium. The control diet was the same tocopherol-stripped soy-based diet without the added 
A, C, E, and magnesium. Before the onset of the feeding with the experimental diets, animals were on a standard 
diet (PicoLab Diet 5L0D) prepared from ground corn, dehulled soybean meal, beet pulp, fishmeal, and other 
plant and animal materials. Fresh diet was provided daily to the mice.
Two protocols of diet supplementation were used. In one protocol, used for all Diap3-Tg mice and one group 
of Gjb2-CKO mice, individuals were transitioned from standard chow to the ACEMg or designed control at 
 
4 weeks, 1 week after weaning. In the other protocol, used only for Gjb2-CKO mice, mothers were fed the ACEMg 
or control diet from 1 week before they were placed in a cage with a male. They continued to be fed the ACEMg 
throughout gestation and lactation and offspring were then weaned onto that same diet. The purpose of the pre-
natal protocol was to test the hypothesis that earlier intervention time point may be more effective at preventing 
the progression in hearing loss associated with the Cx26 mutation. All diets were provided ad libitum, and all 
mice were maintained on the designated diet until the end of the experiment. Numbers of individuals in each 
group are given in Table 1.
Auditory Brainstem Response Measurement. 
Hearing in all included mice was tested with standard 
techniques by measuring thresholds for auditory brainstem responses (ABR) to tonal stimuli. ABRs were meas-
ured in the left ear of each mouse. Gjb2-CKO mice in the post-weaning intervention groups were evaluated 4 and 
16 weeks of age; Gjb2-CKO mice in the prenatal intervention group were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks of age. In 
both groups, ABRs were measured in the left ear at 12, 16, and 24 kHz. The Diap3-Tg mice were evaluated at 4 and 
12 weeks of age in the left ear at 12, 24 and 32 kHz.
Prior to testing, a standard intraperitoneal anesthetic regimen of ketamine (65 mg/kg) (Hospira Inc., Lake 
Forest, IL), xylazine (7 mg/kg) (Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA) and acepromazine (2 mg/kg) (Boehringer 
Ingelheim Vetmedica, St. Joseph, MO) was administered. Subcutaneous glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg/kg) (West-Ward

while the mice are anesthetized. To maintain body temperature while anesthetized, mice were placed on a 
water-circulating heating pad. To maintain anesthesia depth, additional ketamine was administered as needed. 
To assist with recovery from anesthesia, yohimbine was administered (7 mg/kg, S.C.) (Lloyd Laboratories, 
Shenandoah, IA).
An operating microscope was used to ensure the outer ear canal was free of wax, and that the canal, tympanic 
membrane, and visible portions of the malleus were free from deformities. Needle electrodes were then placed 
subcutaneously at the vertex (active), and inferior to the pinnae of the test ear (reference) and the contralateral 
ear (ground).
All ABR measurements were performed in an electrically and acoustically shielded chamber (C A Tegner AB, 
Bromma, Sweden). Acoustic stimuli were pure tone bursts with a 15 ms duration and 1 ms rise and fall times, at 10 
bursts per second. Acoustic stimuli were generated using Tucker–Davis Technology (TDT, Alachua, FL) System 
III hardware and SigGen/BioSig software. A tube connected to a transducer (Beyer B4-31.05-00 headphone ele-
ment; Beyer Dynamic, Farmingdale, NY) was used to present the stimuli to the external auditory meatus. Starting 
levels were 90–105 dB and sound intensity was decreased until threshold was reached. The smallest step size was 
5 dB. Neural responses from up to 1024 tone bursts were amplified (100,000× 
), filtered (300–3000 Hz) and aver-
aged using SigGen/BioSig software.
The threshold was defined as the lowest intensity of stimulation that produced a repeatable response based 
on an identifiable ABR waveform. The software system was recalibrated in between the two groups of Gjb2-CKO 
mice. The maximum stimulation level was 110 dB for the post-weaning intervention group and 105 dB for the 
prenatal intervention group. To correct for this difference, mice with no measurable responses at a frequency, 
or with a measurable response greater than 105 dB, were scored as having a response at 110 dB, the next possible 
level above 105 dB.
Hair Cell Assessment. 
After the final ABR, the deeply anesthetized animals were decapitated and the left 
cochleae harvested and prepared for hair cell quantification. The temporal bones were removed and placed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. The bone from the apical tip of the cochleae was removed and the round 
and oval windows were opened under stereoscopic magnification to allow for the flow of fixative. Cochleae were 
decalcified in a 5% EDTA solution for 24 hours prior to processing. The otic capsule was then trimmed to reveal 
the organ of Corti. The organ of Corti was separated in several fragments from the modiolus and the lateral wall 
tissues. Triton X-100 (0.3%, 15 min.) was used to permeabilize the samples, then the samples were incubated for 
60 min. in 1:100 Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin and PBS. The samples were rinsed and mounted using Fluoro-Gel 
with Tris Buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) on glass slides. Tissues were then analyzed using 
an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMRB) using a standard TRITC filter and ×10, ×40, ×50 and ×100 oil 
objectives. Diap3-Tg animal cochleae were only analyzed qualitatively. In Gjb2-CKO mice cochleae hair cells 
were quantified. A 0.19 mm calibrated scale was imposed on the right objective field. The rows of hair cells were 
oriented longitudinally along the scale. Beginning at the apex, each 0.19 mm section was analyzed for the pres-
ence or absence of hair cells. Manual counts were analyzed using our in-house Excel based program (KHRI 
Cytocochleogram, version 3.0.6) and compared to a data base of normal CBA/J mouse cochleae.
Statistical analysis. 
Multivariate analysis of variance was performed on thresholds at specified time points 
and hair cell counts at termination. To account for differences in initial thresholds for tests of changes over time, 
we analyzed the difference between initial and ending thresholds (threshold shifts). Post hoc tests evaluating the 
contribution of individual variables were judged using sequential Bonferroni criterion to maintain table-wide 
alpha = 
 0.05. In multiple group analyses at a single time point, post-hoc two group comparisons were evaluated 
using Tukey’s HSD test. All analyses were performed in R (Version 3.2.2, http://cran.r-project.org/).
