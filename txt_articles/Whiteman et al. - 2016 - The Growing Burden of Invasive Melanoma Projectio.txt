 The Growing Burden of Invasive Melanoma:
Projections of Incidence Rates and Numbers
of New Cases in Six Susceptible Populations
through 2031
David C. Whiteman1,2, Adele C. Green1,2,3 and Catherine M. Olsen1,2
New melanoma therapies are being developed rapidly, complementing prevention and detection strategies for
disease control. Estimating the future burden of melanoma is necessary for deciding how best to deploy limited
resources to achieve effective melanoma control. Using three decades of cancer registry data (1982e2011) from
six populations with moderate to high melanoma incidence (US whites and the populations of the United
Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Australia, New Zealand), we applied age-period-cohort models to describe current
trends and project future incidence rates and numbers of melanomas out to 2031. Between 1982 and 2011,
melanoma rates in US whites, and the populations of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway increased at
more than 3% annually and are projected to continue rising until at least 2022. Melanoma incidence in Australia
has been declining since 2005 (e0.7% per year), and melanoma incidence in New Zealand is increasing but is
projected to decline soon. The numbers of new melanoma cases will rise in all six populations because of aging
populations and high age-specific rates in the elderly. In US whites, annual new cases will rise from around
70,000 in 2007e2011 to 116,000 in 2026e2031, with 79% of the increase attributable to rising age-specific rates and
21% to population growth and aging. The continued increases in case numbers in all six populations through
2031 will increase the challenges of melanoma control.

INTRODUCTION
Cutaneous melanoma, cancer of the skin’s pigment cells, is
caused by ultraviolet UV radiation from natural (sunlight) or
artificial (tanning beds) sources (IARC Working Group on the
Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, 2012). In sus-
ceptible, fair-skinned populations around the world, mela-
noma incidence has been rising steadily during recent
decades (Erdmann et al., 2013). In response to these rising
rates and the known causal role of excessive UV exposure,
health agencies in many regions have launched campaigns
that aim to reduce hazardous sun exposure and thereby lower
melanoma incidence. However, the history of and ap-
proaches to prevention campaigns have differed across
populations.
In the United States, for example, multiple agencies have
promoted sun protection, albeit in an uncoordinated fashion
(Lazovich et al., 2012). The US Surgeon General recently
published a Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer to promote
sun protection policies and reduce harms from indoor tan-
ning (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014).
In the United Kingdom (UK), national primary prevention
efforts
commenced
in
the
1990s,
and
the
SunSmart
Campaign followed in 2003. Since then, other UK organi-
zations have launched campaigns targeted at particular au-
diences. In Norway and Sweden, the respective national
cancer societies and radiation safety agencies have delivered
primary prevention messages since the 1990s, albeit with
limited resources and a variety of approaches (Nilsen et al.,
2011; Nilsen et al., 2008). The high-incidence populations
of Australia and New Zealand have been exposed to mass-
media campaigns since the early 1980s (Iannacone and
Green, 2014; Watts et al., 2002).
Given the maturity of prevention campaigns and their
apparent success in changing behavior, particularly in
Australia and New Zealand (Buller et al., 2011; Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2012; Makin et al., 2013),
one might reasonably expect to see a downturn in melanoma
incidence and numbers of new cases. Indeed, there have
been recent reports of declining rates within younger birth
cohorts in some countries (Iannacone et al., 2015; Weir et al.,
2011), although as yet these trends at early ages have not had
a discernible impact on total melanoma incidence (Erdmann
et al., 2013). Recently, targeted therapies for melanoma have
been approved in a number of jurisdictions, with an as yet
uncertain impact on health expenditures into the future. To
study these issues, we analyzed recent trends and estimated

 future melanoma incidence in six populations of mainly
European heritage with markedly different patterns of UV
exposure and varying approaches to melanoma control: US
whites and the populations of the UK, Sweden, Norway,
Australia, and New Zealand.
RESULTS
Population trends in age-standardized invasive melanoma
incidence and mortality
In all six populations, age-standardized invasive melanoma
incidence was substantially higher in 2011 than 1982
(ranging from 2-fold higher in Australia to 4-fold higher in the
UK), although the trajectories through which melanoma rates
increased varied across populations (Figure 1). In US whites,
age-standardized invasive melanoma incidence increased at
around 3.3% per year between 1982 and 2006, with slower
increases in incidence thereafter (Figure 1a). UK rates
increased rapidly during the 1980s, stabilized briefly, and
then increased continuously at more than 4% per year since
1991 (Figure 1b). Melanoma rates in both Sweden and Nor-
way climbed from around 10e12 � 10-5 person-years in the
early 1980s to around 20 � 10-5 person-years by the early
2000s and then increased rapidly since 2004 (Sweden
average annual percentage rate change [APC] ¼ 6.11, Nor-
way APC ¼ 5.09) (Figure 1c and d). In contrast to continuing
increases observed in northern hemisphere populations,
melanoma incidence in Australia transitioned through three
distinct phases during the observation period, characterized
as rapid growth (1982e1987, APC ¼ 6.91), modest growth
(1987e2005, APC ¼ 1.68) and recent decline (2005e2011,
APC ¼ e0.68) (Figure 1e). The situation in New Zealand was
complicated by changes in cancer registration practices in
1994, but there were steady increases before the change
(1982e1993, APC ¼ 2.75), followed by slow but statistically
significant increases in melanoma incidence (1997e2011,
APC ¼ 1.16) (Figure 1f).
Projection algorithms suggest that age-standardized inva-
sive melanoma incidence in US whites will peak at around
32 � 10-5 person-years by 2022e2026, whereas rates in the
three northern European countries are anticipated to stabilize
somewhat later (Table 1). In contrast, melanoma rates in
Australia peaked around 2005 (Figure 1) and are projected to
continue declining. New Zealand appears to be following a
similar trajectory to Australia but about a decade later, with
age-standardized incidence anticipated to peak at about
51 � 10-5 person-years in 2012e2016 and then to decline
slowly thereafter.
Age-standardized melanoma mortality has also been rising
in all six countries during the past three decades, albeit less
rapidly than incidence and with different rates of increase
across countries. The highest age-standardized melanoma
mortality rates were observed in New Zealand and Australia,
with average annual increases in rates of around 1.5% during
the past decade (Figure 2e and f). Of the northern hemisphere
nations, Norway and Sweden now have the highest mela-
noma mortality rates (approaching 6 � 10-5 person-years in
Norway and 4 � 10-5 person-years in Sweden) and have
undergone continuous, steady rises in mortality for decades
(APC ¼ 1.51e1.81) (Figure 2c and d). Melanoma mortality
rates in US whites and the UK population are slightly lower,
and although rates continue to rise steadily in the UK (APC ¼
1.59), US mortality rates are climbing much more slowly
(APC ¼ 0.20) (Figure 2a and b).
Population trends in age-specific invasive melanoma
incidence
In all six populations, the highest age-specific invasive mel-
anoma rates were observed in the elderly (>80 years), and
these are projected to continue rising for the foreseeable
future (Figure 3, see Supplementary Table S1 online). Differ-
ences in melanoma trends across populations were evident in
young (20e39 years) and middle-aged (40e59 years) adults.
Whereas in Australia and New Zealand, age-specific mela-
noma incidence for those younger than 60 years peaked
around 2002e2006 and then declined (Figure 3e and f),
melanoma rates among those younger than 60 years are not
projected to stabilize until 2021 in US whites (Figure 3a) and
until 2026 in the UK, Sweden, and Norway (Figure 3bed).
Numbers of persons diagnosed with and dying from invasive
melanoma
The numbers of persons with invasive melanoma increased in
each population from 1982 to 2011, with relative increases
in new melanoma cases ranging from 133% in Norway to
278% in the UK (Table 2). Numbers of deaths from mela-
noma in each country during the past three decades are re-
ported in Supplementary Table S2 online. Most of the
increase in new melanoma diagnoses was attributable to
changes in age-specific melanoma incidence, most evident
in
the
UK
and
Sweden.
During
the
forecast
period
(2012e2031), all six populations can expect large increases
in the numbers of invasive melanomas diagnosed. The
number of invasive melanomas diagnosed in US whites will
rise from about 70,000 per year in 2007e2011 to more than
116,000 per year in 2026e2031. Over the entire interval of
1982e2031, the number of US whites diagnosed with mel-
anoma each year will quadruple, of which 79% of the excess
can be attributed to increases in the age-specific rates of
melanoma and 21% can be attributed to population growth
and aging. Changes of approximately similar magnitude were
projected for the other populations. Relative to 1982, the
excess numbers of persons with melanoma in 2031 will rise
substantially in the UK (585%), Sweden (388%), Norway
(333%), Australia (291%), and New Zealand (362%). In all
populations except Australia, most of the increase in numbers
of persons diagnosed with melanoma will be attributable to
increases in age-specific melanoma rates rather than popu-
lation growth.
Observed versus expected cases, assuming historical
melanoma rates prevailed
Finally, we sought to compare the number of invasive mel-
anomas
that
were
recorded
in
each
population
in
2002e2006 and 2007e2011 with the number that would
have occurred in those time periods assuming that underlying
melanoma incidence rates had continued on the trajectories
prevailing during the 20 years prior (Table 3). Under
those assumptions, the numbers of melanomas observed
in 2007e2011 were higher than expected in the United
States
(þ5%),
the
UK
(þ19%),
Sweden
(þ27%),
and
Norway (þ14%). The magnitudes of the differences were

 systematically greater for 2007e2011 than 2002e2006,
reflecting the effects of steadily increasing incidence in these
countries during recent time periods. In contrast, the numbers
of new melanoma cases in Australia and New Zealand were
6e10% lower in 2007e2011 than would have been ex-
pected had the trends in melanoma incidence continued on
their earlier course.
DISCUSSION
Agencies tasked with developing cancer control strategies—
such as the US Surgeon General (US Department of Health
and Human Services, 2014), the UK National Health Ser-
vice (Independent Cancer Taskforce, 2015), and the Cancer
Institute NSW in Australia (Cancer Institute NSW, 2012)—use
estimates of future melanoma incidence on which to develop
their policies and advice. In an era during which new ther-
apies for melanoma are being developed rapidly (Michielin
and Hoeller, 2015), consideration of the likely future
burden is necessary to decide how best to deploy limited
resources toward effective disease control. For US whites and
populations of the UK, Sweden, and Norway, invasive mel-
anoma incidence is projected to rise until 2022e2026 and
then possibly stabilize. Melanoma incidence in Australia and
New Zealand is projected to decline in the years ahead.
However, for all populations studied, and particularly in New
Zealand, no declines in crude melanoma rates are antici-
pated for the foreseeable future, because of the exceptionally
high rates of melanoma in the elderly and their increasing
representation in those populations over time. This means
that there will be large increases in the absolute numbers of
new melanomas diagnosed in each population in the next
two decades. These increases will be most notable in the UK,
where the numbers of melanomas diagnosed each year in
2027e2031 will be more than 6-fold higher than in
1982e1986, mostly because of substantially higher risks of
melanoma among UK residents than during earlier time pe-
riods. It remains unclear how new therapies will be deployed
in the future, but based on the predictions for numbers of new
cases presented here and assuming that 10e20% of mela-
noma patients progress to late-stage disease, then in the
United States alone up to 24,000 melanoma patients each
year theoretically could be candidates for new therapies
by 2031.
We
assessed
melanoma
burden
using
measures
of
incidence and mortality. Other measures, such as disability-
adjusted life years, have also been used to assess mela-
noma burden. We did not estimate melanoma burden using
such measures because the calculations require estimates of
utility weights and distributions of melanoma disease states
that are not available for all jurisdictions for all time periods,
and would require assessments beyond the scope of the
present article.
Projections of future melanoma incidence for the US
population were reported recently by the Centers for Disease
Control (Guy Jr et al., 2015). Our report extends those find-
ings by estimating future melanoma incidence for five other
countries and estimating rates of change in melanoma inci-
dence. In addition, we estimated the respective contributions
of population structure and risk to future melanoma burden.
We did not attempt to project melanoma mortality into the
future, however, because survival is likely to change mark-
edly with the advent of new therapies for advanced (fatal)
melanoma. Erdmann et al. (2013) conducted age-period-
cohort modeling for eight populations (which overlapped
with five populations analyzed in our report: US whites and
the populations of the UK, Norway, Australia, and New

 Zealand). They reported historical trends of steady increases
in overall melanoma incidence in most fair-skinned pop-
ulations around the world but noted recent stabilizations in
Australia, New Zealand and US whites, with possible de-
clines in incidence among those aged 25e44 years in
Australia, New Zealand, US whites, and Norway; they
concluded that the declines were more likely explained by
birth cohort than calendar period. Similarly, Autier et al.
(2015) examined historical trends in melanoma mortality in
various regions around the world and concluded that
although numbers of deaths from melanoma would continue
to rise in the next several decades, age-standardized mortality
rates would likely decrease into the future as more recent
birth cohorts progressively age. Although these observations
broadly parallel ours, there are some important differences.
In particular, Erdmann et al. (2013) and Autier et al. (2015)
standardized incidence rates to the 1960 world standard
population (Boschi-Pinto et al., 2001), which gives dispro-
portionately greater weight to young age groups and less
weight to older age groups than the US 2000 standard pop-
ulation (Anderson and Rosenberg, 1998). This serves to
dampen the effects of rising incidence in the elderly and
inflate the effects of falling incidence in the young. Our use

 population suggests that although rates in Australia are
now declining and appear on the cusp of doing so in
New Zealand, overall melanoma incidence in US whites and
European populations is likely to increase for another decade
or so.
The recent declines in overall age-standardized melanoma
incidence observed in Australia are highly significant and
complement earlier reports suggesting declining rates in the
young (Iannacone et al., 2015). Although some have argued
that such declines may be an artefact caused by rising
numbers of young migrants at low risk of melanoma
(Czarnecki, 2014), a detailed analysis has shown that the
magnitude of population dilution is too small to explain the
observed downturn in rates among the young (Baade et al.,
2015). It is possible that the declining melanoma rates
among the young are due to lower levels of sun exposure
than in earlier generations (Lucas et al., 2013). There is some
evidence to support this proposition, although surveys of
Australian youth in recent decades have shown only modest
improvements in attitudes and behaviors regarding tanning,
sunburns, or use of protective clothing or sunscreen (Makin
et al., 2013; Volkov, 2013), suggesting that the decline in
melanoma incidence may not be wholly explained by
conscious preventive activity by individuals. Strategies tar-
geting educational settings, such as mandated shade pro-
visions in childcare facilities (Ettridge et al., 2011) and
extensive SunSmart school policies (Montague et al., 2001),
have arguably contributed to success in reducing hazardous
sun exposure among minors, although even these strategies
have not been implemented with universal effectiveness
(Turner et al., 2014).
It is possible that some of the decline in melanoma rates
among the young in Australia may be a consequence of
secular changes in behavior unrelated to primary prevention
activities. Periodic national surveys have documented trends
of increasing screen time, less time spent in outdoor play, and
fewer children walking or cycling to school (Australian
Bureau of Statistics, 2000, 2009), all of which lead to less
sun exposure than for previous generations of Australian
children (Lucas et al., 2013). In support of the notion that
secular changes are leading to lower levels of sun exposure in
Australian youth is the observation that the prevalence of
myopia (short-sightedness) is rising in many countries,
including
Australia
(Dolgin,
2015;
French,
Morgan,
Burlutsky, et al., 2013a). Because myopia is causally associ-
ated with lack of outdoor play (French, Morgan, Mitchell, and
Rose, 2013; He et al., 2015; Sherwin et al., 2012), these
myopia data suggest that modern children spend less time
playing outdoors than previous generations. Such an expla-
nation would fit with cohort-specific changes in melanoma
incidence and accord with the notion that sun exposure in
childhood is particularly important for initiating melanoma
development
(Whiteman
et
al.,
2001).
The
effects
of
decreased outdoor play on subsequent melanoma incidence
may be more noticeable in low-latitude environments such as
Australia, where high solar dosages are accumulated through
year-round incidental exposures (Diffey and Gies, 1998;
Green et al., 2011), compared with high-latitude countries,
where dosage is dominated by summer vacation exposures
(Thieden et al., 2004).
The rising rates of melanoma in young and middle-aged
adults observed in US whites and UK and Sweden pop-
ulations may be partly attributable to artificial sources of UV
exposure. Tanning lamps became widespread in the 1980s
and 1990s, especially among the young (Boldeman et al.,
2001; Thomson et al., 2010). At the molecular level, DNA
photoproducts can be detected in the urine of human vol-
unteers after sunbed exposure (Kotova et al., 2005), and there
is increasing evidence that the UVA wavelengths preferen-
tially emitted by solaria have carcinogenic potential (Abdel-
Malek and Cassidy, 2015; Premi et al., 2015; Tewari et al.,
2012). It is possible that the full effects of tanning bed ex-
posures on melanoma incidence have not yet been realized.
If the recent trends in melanoma incidence in the US and
Europe are partly attributable to exposure from tanning beds,
then our projections of future melanoma incidence will
incorporate the effects of recent exposures to these causal
factors. Jurisdictions in Australia (Sinclair et al., 2014), the
United States (Guy Jr et al., 2014), and the UK (Pawlak et al.,
2012) have enacted legislation to restrict sunbed use by
minors, and it will be interesting to see whether these laws
have the same impact on melanoma incidence as was
observed in Iceland after tanning parlors were regulated in
that country (He
´ry et al., 2010).
The historical trends in melanoma reported here are based
on observed data and are unlikely to reflect changes in data
capture or reporting (except for the known changes in New

 Zealand around 1994). However, a potential limitation to
these analyses is the issue of underreporting of melanoma
diagnoses to cancer registries. The extent of this problem is
difficult to gauge, but it is likely to vary across jurisdictions
and may have varied over time. For example, underreporting
of melanoma was known to occur in New Zealand before
1994 and has been documented in several US Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results registries at various times
(Cockburn et al., 2008; Watson et al., 2011). Future pro-
jections of melanoma incidence also make assumptions
about the trajectories of age-specific rates, as well as as-
sumptions about the future size and age structure of pop-
ulations. Both sets of estimates are prone to error. Perhaps the
most arbitrary assumptions involve the magnitudes of drift for
age-specific melanoma rates. We followed an empirical
approach (Bray and Moller, 2006; Moller et al., 2003) and
tested whether, in each population, the drift parameters in the
most recently observed time periods were different from that
derived over the total period of observed data. If so, we
applied the most recent drift parameter, assuming that future
rates are more likely to be influenced by recent than histor-
ical trends. The NORDPRED approach further assumes that
cancer incidence cannot continue to rise exponentially and
so dampens the drift over succeeding time periods based on
empirical modeling. This will have contributed to the ten-
dency for all projections to stabilize in the most distant future
time periods. In sensitivity analyses, we allowed incidence
rates to continue to drift without applying any dampening
algorithm; as expected, this led to more extreme projections
than those presented here (see Supplementary Figure S1
online).
In conclusion, we found trends of increasing total mela-
noma incidence in US whites and the UK, Swedish, and
Norwegian populations, likely stabilization in New Zealand
and decreasing incidence in Australia. In all populations,
melanoma incidence is destined to rise steeply among older
people for some time, but rates appear to be stabilizing or
declining
among
the
young.
Nevertheless,
the
overall
numbers of patients being diagnosed with melanoma will
increase in the decades ahead, for which health services
need to prepare. Primary prevention should remain the
cornerstone of melanoma control efforts through pragmatic
approaches to reduce harm from unnecessary UV exposures
(Melanoma research, 2015).
METHODS
We obtained data on incident invasive melanoma cases (i.e., Clark
level IIeV) and deaths from melanoma on request from population-
based cancer registries in the United States, the UK, Norway, Swe-
den,
Australia,
and
New
Zealand
for
three
decades
from
1982e2011. (In situ melanomas were excluded.) Historical and
forecast population sizes and structure from 1982e2031 were ob-
tained from national statistics agencies. Thus, US data were obtained
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the
National Cancer Institute (9 registries), currently covering approxi-
mately 9.4% of the US population (Surveillance, 2013). We used
data for US whites only, because melanoma incidence in other racial
groups is very low. The population structure for US whites in the nine
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries closely
approximated that for all US whites; we therefore calculated 9.4%
for each age and sex category and used these estimates for the
population projections sourced for US whites from the US Census
Bureau (United States Census Bureau, 2015). For the UK, we ob-
tained melanoma incidence data from cancer registries in Scotland,
Wales, and Northern Ireland and the Office for National Statistics for
England (Office for National Statistics, 2015a). Population de-
nominators and projections for the UK were also sourced from the
Office for National Statistics (Office for National Statistics, 2015b).
Melanoma incidence data and population denominators for Sweden
and Norway were sourced from the NORDCAN database (Engholm
et al., 2010), and population projections from Statistics Sweden
(Statistics Sweden, 2015) and Statistics Norway (Statistics Norway,
2015). Australian melanoma incidence and population data were
obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2015)
and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2015). All data for New
Zealand were obtained via request from Statistics New Zealand.
We calculated the APC in invasive melanoma incidence for the
period of observed data (1982e2011) using the Joinpoint Regression
Program (Version 4.0.4, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD,
USA) using Hudson’s continuous fitting algorithm (Hudson, 1966).
We used NORDPRED (Moller et al., 2003) to project melanoma
incidence rates for four 5-year time periods from 2012e2016
through 2027e2031. The calculations were based on incidence
between 1982 and 2011, aggregated into 5-year time periods and
5-year age groups by sex. This approach extends the standard age-
period-cohort model (Osmond, 1985) by including a common drift
parameter (Clayton and Schifflers, 1987) and two other modifica-
tions which have been validated empirically to improve projections
(Moller et al., 2003). The model can be written as Rap ¼ (Aa þ D $
p þ Pp þ Cc)5, where Rap is the incidence rate in age group a in
calendar period p; Aa is the age component for age group a; D is the
common drift parameter, which summarizes the linear component of
the trend that cannot be attributed to either period or cohort (Clayton
and Schifflers, 1987) (i.e., equivalent to the estimated annual per-
centage rate of change in incidence for a specific age group); Pp is
the nonlinear period component of period p; and Cc is the nonlinear
cohort component of cohort c. This approach allows a gradual
reduction in the drift parameter, which has the effect of gradually
reducing the impact of current trends on projected rates; we reduced
the drift by 25%, 50%, and 75% in the second (2017e2021), third
(2022e2026), and fourth (2027e2031) prediction periods, respec-
tively. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the extent of attenuation of
the drift parameter from no attenuation during follow-up (null) to full
attenuation in the first 5 years (full) (see Supplementary Table S3
online).
For each country, the first age group to be included in the
regression model was the first age group for which the number of
cases exceeded 20 in each of the 5-year observation periods (US
whites, 15e19 years; the UK, 10e14 years; Sweden, 15e19 years;
Norway, 20e24 years; Australia, 10e14 years; New Zealand,
15e19 years). The predictions for each country were based on the
last four observation periods for US whites and the UK and Australia
populations and on the last six observation periods for the remaining
countries, as determined by the goodness-of-fit test (5% level). For all
six countries, the crude rates displayed significant curvature in the
prediction base (Norway, P ¼ 0.0212; for all other countries, P <
0.001), and thus the trend in the last 10 years was used as the drift
component to be projected (Moller et al., 2003). For each popula-
tion, we report crude and age-standardized rates using the United
States
2000
standard
(Anderson
and
Rosenberg,
1998).
We

 calculated the number and proportion of melanoma cases that were
attributable to changes in population risk (i.e., changes in age-
specific rates over time) and population structure (i.e., changes in
the size and age distribution), using 1982e1987 as the baseline
(Moller et al., 2002).
Finally, we compared the number of melanomas that were actu-
ally observed in each population in the two most recent time periods
(2002e2006 and 2007e2011) with the number that would have
occurred had melanoma incidence continued on the trajectories
experienced during the 20 years before 2002 (Bray and Moller,
2006). To do this, we first estimated the number of melanomas in
each
population
that
were
expected
in
2002e2006
and
2007e2011. We fitted age-period-cohort models for the period of
1982e2002 to calculate the underlying incidence rates and their
respective drifts. We then projected melanoma incidence for
2002e2006 and 2007e2011, assuming that the underlying age-
specific incidence rates continued to drift on the same trajectory
as previously. We then multiplied the expected age-specific inci-
dence rates by the age-specific populations in each time period to
calculate the expected numbers of melanomas, which were then
compared with the observed numbers of melanomas.
