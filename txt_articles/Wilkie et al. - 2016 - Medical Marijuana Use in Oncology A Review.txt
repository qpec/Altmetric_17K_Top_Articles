Medical Marijuana Use in Oncology
A Review
Gianna Wilkie, BS; Bachir Sakr, MD; Tina Rizack, MD, MPH
M
edical marijuana use is controversial in American soci-
ety. While states move to legalize marijuana for medi-
cal and/or recreational use, research is needed to elu-
cidate the adverse effects and potential therapeutic benefits of
cannabis therapy. This literature review focuses on the history of
marijuanause,potentialmechanismsofaction,thetherapeuticuse
of marijuana in oncology, and its adverse effects.
History and Legal Status
Cannabis has a history of both medicinal and recreational use dat-
ingbackcenturies.TraditionholdsthatChineseEmperorShenNung
toutedthebenefitsofcannabisinthe28thcentury BC.1Cannabiswas
believedtohavehealingpowersforailmentsincludingrheumatism,
gout,malaria,and“
absent-mindedness.”
2In1611,theJamestownset-
tlers brought marijuana (commonly known as hemp) to North
America, and throughout the colonial period hemp fiber was an im-
portant export.2 Cannabis was first introduced to Western medi-
cinebysurgeonW.B.O’
Shaughnessyinthe1840s.Whileworkingfor
the British East India company, he reportedly found it to have good
analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and anticonvulsant
properties. During this same time, a French psychiatrist, Jacques-
JosephMoreau,conductedstudiesthatfoundthatmarijuanausesup-
pressed headaches, increased appetite, and aided sleep. Marijuana
was introduced into the US Pharmacopeia in 1850 and was pre-
scribed for conditions such as labor pain, nausea, and rheumatism.2
The passage of the Harrison Act of 1914 defined the use of mari-
juana as a crime, which led individual states such as California and
Texas to pass laws prohibiting marijuana use for nonmedical
purposes.3TheUSCongressthenpassedtheMarijuanaTaxAct,crimi-
nalizing the drug in 1937.3(pp971-1203) It was removed from the US
Pharmacopeia in 1941 because it was no longer recognized to have
medicinal use.2 The Boggs Act and Narcotics Control Act of 1951 in-
creased marijuana possession and distribution penalties and led to
theenforcementofmandatoryprisonsentences.3(pp971-1203)In1970,
marijuanabecameaScheduleIdrug,4aclassificationgivenbytheUS
Drug Enforcement Administration to drugs with no currently ac-
ceptedmedicalusewithahighpotentialforabuse.5In1986,theAnti–
Drug Abuse Act was passed, reinstating mandatory minimum pen-
alties and increasing federal penalties for both possession and
distribution of marijuana.6(pp189-190) It was not until 1996 that Cali-
forniabecamethefirststatetorelegalizemarijuanaforusebypeople
withAIDS,cancer,andotherseriousillnesses.6(p321)In2010,Califor-
niarejectedproposition19,whichwouldhavelegalizedmarijuanause
for recreational purposes.7(pp159-215) In November of 2012, the pas-
sage of Colorado’
s Amendment 64 and Washington’
s Initiative 502
made them the first US states to pass recreational use laws.8 Cur-
rently,23statesandtheDistrictofColumbiahavelawslegalizingmari-
juana use in some form, with 4 states and the District of Columbia
legalizing marijuana for recreational use (Table).8
The current state of cannabis use for both medical and recre-
ational purposes in the United States is highly debated. While it is
still classified as an illegal substance federally, many states have
movedtodecriminalizeand/orlegalizemarijuanaformedicaland/or
recreationaluse.9Despitelimitedresearchontheeffectsofsmoked
cannabis, states appear to be motivated to legalize marijuana use
for financial gain. In 2010, it was predicted that legalizing mari-
juanausewouldgenerate$8.7billioninannualfederalandstatetax
revenues while saving billions of dollars that were previously spent
forregulatingmarijuanause.10(pp1-62)ThestateofWashingtongen-
erated $70 million in tax revenue from marijuana sales in the first
year of marijuana legalization.11 In addition, many states’residents
support marijuana legalization.11
IMPORTANCE Medicinal marijuana use is currently legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia.
As more states approve marijuana use for medical indications, physicians will be asked by their
patients for more information regarding the risks and benefits of use. This article reviews the
history, adverse effects, and proposed mechanisms of action of marijuana and summarizes the
available literature regarding symptom relief and therapeutic value in patients with cancer.
OBSERVATIONS Marijuana in oncology may have potential for use as an antiemetic, for
refractory cancer pain, and as an antitumor agent. However, much of the data are based on
animal data, small trials, or are outdated.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More research is needed in all areas related to the therapeutic
use of marijuana in oncology.

Withaccesstomedicalmarijuanaincreasing,physiciansmaybe
asked for prescriptions and information about this substance. Phy-
sicianshavemixedattitudesaboutthelegalizationofmedicalmari-
juana use. In 2005, Charuvastra et al12 sampled 960 physicians for
their opinions about the legal prescription of marijuana as medical
therapy. Their results showed that 36% of physicians believe mari-
juana use should be legal, while 26% were neutral to the proposi-
tion. In 2013, Adler and Colber13 completed a poll of 1446 physi-
ciansandfoundthat76%approvedofusingmarijuanaforamedical
purpose. Most physicians in this study cited their “responsibility as
caregivers to alleviate suffering”as their reason for support. The
AmericanMedicalAssociationhasstatedthatitwouldsupportmari-
juana rescheduling if it facilitated research and the development of
cannabinoid-based medicine.14
Mechanism of Action
The exact mechanism of action of cannabis remains unclear. Can-
nabis is composed of 3 different bioactive molecules called flavo-
noids,terpenoids,andcannabinoids.Themostwell-studiedcanna-
binoidisΔ9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC),themostactiveconstituent
oftheplant.Smallalterationsinthestructureofcannabinoids,such
asTHC,candramaticallychangetheirpotency.15Cannabisexertsits
actions by binding to specific receptors called cannabinoid recep-
tors,makinguptheendogenouscannabinoidsystem.Devaneetal16
characterized the cannabinoid receptor, whereas Compton et al17
showedastrongcorrelationbetweenthebindingaffinityforthere-
ceptorsiteandthecorrespondingpotencyofalargenumberofcan-
nabinoid analogs. These receptors, called cannabinoid receptors 1
and 2 (CB1 and CB2), work via their action as G-protein coupled re-
ceptors,wheretheyinhibitbothadenylatecyclaseandcalciumchan-
nels and activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels.18
Thedistributionofthesereceptorsaccountsformanyoftheob-
served effects associated with cannabis use. Cannabinoid 1 recep-
tors appear to be ubiquitously located throughout the body, with
the highest concentration of receptors found in the central ner-
vous system. Cannabinoid 1 receptors are well studied given their
connection to the observed psychoactive effects of THC.19 Canna-
binoid 2 receptor expression is found mainly in the immune sys-
tem, with the highest expression seen in B-lymphocytes, involved
in immune suppression and cell migration induction.20
In addition to THC, cannabis has high concentrations of canna-
bidiol (CBD), a nonpsychotropic constituent of the plant.21 Canna-
bidiol’
s mechanism of action is not clearly understood, but it is
thought to modify the metabolism and effects of THC and act as an
antagonistofCB1andCB2receptorsgivenitslowbindingaffinity.21-23
Cannabidiol is also a potent anti-inflammatory agent.24
The role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in both nor-
malfunctioninganddiseaseisstillunderinvestigation.WhereasTHC
is better researched, less is understood about the other cannabi-
noids and their exact mechanisms of action, including how syn-
thetic cannabinoids and THC analogs may interact with receptors
and produce effects differently. Cannabis has been studied for its
use as a treatment in a number of symptoms related to cancer. This
review focuses on the research examining cannabis use in chemo-
therapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), cancer-associated
pain, and cannabis as an antitumor agent.
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting
Cannabis is known for its antiemetic properties, which makes it an
appealing treatment for CINV. It has been proposed that THC may
treat nausea via emetic reflex pathways by acting at receptors lo-
cated in the nucleus tractus solitarii at the level of the area
postrema.25 It has also been shown that THC reverses the effects
of 5-HT3 receptor agonists, which normally induce vomiting.25
Cannabis has anecdotally been effective in suppressing antici-
patorynausea.Parkeretal26completedexperimentsinwhichhouse
muskshrews(Suncusmurinus)wererepeatedlyexposedtocontex-
tualcues,whichwerethenpairedwiththeemeticeffectsoflithium
chloride (LiCl) injections. They then confirmed that the shrews had
developed a conditioned retching response to the cue even in the
absence of LiCl. They then found that pretreatment of the shrews
withprincipalcannabinoids1and2completelysuppressedtheretch-
ing reaction, while pretreatment with ondansetron did not sup-
pressthisreaction.Theyconcludedthatmarijuanamaysuppressthe
expression of anticipatory nausea better than 5-HT3 receptor
antagonists.
There have been numerous studies comparing the antiemetic
properties of cannabis and its derivatives to those of other medica-
tionsusedinCINV.Dronabinol,asyntheticTHC,andnabilone,asyn-
thetic analog of THC, both oral medications, are well-studied anti-
emetics, whereas data on smoked cannabis are more limited. With

There are 2 systematic reviews available for the comparison of
THC-derived drugs to older antiemetics. Tramèr et al29 completed
a systematic review of 30 randomized comparisons of cannabi-
noids with placebo or other antiemetics. Three different cannabi-
noids (oral nabilone, oral dronabinol, and intramuscular levonant-
radol hydrochloride) were tested as first-line antiemetic agents in
1366patientstoevaluatethecompleteabsenceofnauseaandvom-
itinginthefirst24hoursofchemotherapy.Whencomparingalltrials,
they found that cannabinoids were significantly more effective an-
tiemetics than prochlorperazine, metoclopramide hydrochloride,

tientsreceivingmediumemetogenicregimens(consistingofcyclo-

sedation, drowsiness, and euphoria, and less desirable adverse ef-
fectsincludeddizziness,dysphoria,depression,hallucinations,para-
noia,andhypotension.In18studiescrossoverwasallowedand38%

tential inconsistent administration times of medications in relation
tochemotherapyadministration,theoverallsmallsamplesizeofeach
of the trials compared (range, 8-139 patients), and the heteroge-
neityofstudyparticipantsincluded.Someincludedpatientshadre-
fractoryCINVorpreviouslyusedcannabispriortotreatment,which
may have influenced their drug response.
Ben Amar30 summarized 15 randomized clinical trials consist-
ing of 600 patients that compared either nabilone to placebo or
other available antiemetic drugs as first-line agents. He found
nabilone to be superior to prochlorperazine, domperidone, and
alizapride, with patients favoring nabilone for continuous use. In
the same meta-analysis, he reported that in 14 studies of dronabi-
nol involving 681 patients, the cannabinoid antiemetic effect was
significantly greater than that of chlorpromazine and equivalent to
metochlopramide, thiethylperazine, and haloperidol. This review
does not highlight the timing of drug administration in relation to
cytotoxic exposure, the emetogenic nature of the chemothera-
peutic regimen used in each study, or the definitions used to
assess nausea and vomiting in all trials. The variability within each
trial included in the review affects the generalizability of this
research to specific populations. Because neither review included
trials using current highly effective antiemetic drugs, clinical prac-
tice is not affected.
Numerous studies have shown that the combination of THC
derivatives with other antiemetics works best for nausea. Plasse
et al31 reported that combinations of THC and prochlorperazine
resulted in enhanced efficacy as assessed by duration and severity
of nausea and vomiting. Lane et al32 showed that the combination
of dronabinol and prochlorperazine was significantly more effec-
tive than either single agent in controlling CINV.

Case reports of cannabinoid-induced hyperemesis syndrome
have increased as access to marijuana increases across the coun-
try. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is characterized by long-
termcannabisuse,cyclicepisodesofnauseaandvomiting,andfre-
quenthotbathing.Itoccursviaanunknownmechanism.34Patients
using cannabis on a long-term basis while undergoing chemo-
therapy could develop cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,
although to date no cases have been reported.35
There are currently no clinical trials comparing smoked canna-
bis to current first-line antiemetic therapies. Given the lack of data
withregardtosmokedcannabisasaformoftreatment,itisnotrec-
ommended as a first-line antiemetic. More research examining the
mechanism by which cannabinoids may function and clinical trials
using current antiemetic regimens as comparison to cannabis in
moderate to highly emetogenic chemotherapies are needed.
Cancer-Associated Pain
Cannabinoids have been studied for their analgesic potential in
cancer-associated pain, specifically neuropathic pain.36 Cannabi-
noid 1 receptors, in the central nervous system, are found in high
concentrations in areas of the brain that modulate nociceptive
processing, with a similar distribution to opioid receptors.37 Can-
nabinoids may also act on mast cell receptors, inhibiting the
release of inflammatory substances and enhancing the release of
analgesic opioids to combat inflammation.38,39 Cannabinoids may
be effective in treating neuropathic pain by inhibiting the acute
pain response in C-fibers and the windup phenomenon that con-
tributes to the development of hyperalgesia.36 Cannabinoids are
also believed to have a synergistic analgesic effect with opioids via
unknown mechanisms.40 Cannabinoids may function to suppress
spinal and thalamic nociceptive neurons.41
Several clinical trials examining the use of cannabinoid receptor
agonists to relieve chronic cancer pain have been published. Noyes

blindplacebo-controlledtrial.Theyfoundthattheanalgesiceffectof

120 mg. They reported that 10 mg of THC produced analgesic ef-
fects over a 7-hour observation period comparable to 60 mg of co-

port that THC may have analgesic effects, sedation may limit its use.
Nabiximols, a novel cannabinoid oromucosal spray, is a 1:1 com-
binationofTHCandCBD.Portenoyetal44completedarandomized,

thatlowandmediumdosesofnabiximolshadimprovedanalgesiaover

fective than lower doses. However, this study was limited by the in-
vestigators’
decisiontodiscouragechangesinconcurrentopioiddos-
ing as study participants who dropped out may have experienced
adverse effects that could have been controlled by altering opioid
dose. Johnson et al45 then examined the effects of cannabis extract
preparations containing THC and CBD in 177 patients with advanced
canceranduncontrolledcancerpaindespitelong-termopioiduse.The
studyhad3armswithTHC:CBDextract(n = 60),THCextract(n = 58),
and placebo (n = 59). The results showed that pain relief was supe-
riorintheTHC:CBDgroup,withtwiceasmanypatientsexperiencing
a 30% reduction in pain when compared with placebo. The THC-
alone group performed similarly to the placebo group. On the basis
ofthese2limitedstudies,theremaybearoleforTHCandCBDtherapy
in patients with cancer who have opioid-refractory pain.
Because each study used different preparations of cannabis or
THC, there is insufficient evidence to recommend cannabis or THC
forthefirst-linemanagementofcancer-associatedpain,butthere-
sults suggest a benefit as an add-on medication. More clinical trials
examining the effects of smoked cannabis, THC, CBD, and its other
derivatives are needed.
Cannabis as an Antitumor Agent
There is evidence that suggests that cannabis may be used as a po-
tential chemotherapeutic treatment. Endocannabinoid signaling is
increased in some human tissue malignant neoplasms when com-
pared with noncancerous tissue, especially in highly invasive can-
cers, suggesting that endocannabinoids may play a role in tumor
growth.46 In vivo and in vitro research propose that cannabinoids
caninhibittumorgrowthviavariousmechanismsincludingincreas-
ing cellular apoptosis and suppressing cell proliferation.47,48 Con-
flictingly, McKallip et al49 showed that THC may increase tumor
growthduetoreducedimmunefunction.Cannabinoidreceptorsare
widespread throughout the body and regulate a variety of physi-
ologicalfunctions,includingneuronaldevelopmentandenergyme-
tabolism. Activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors leads to a cascade of
cellular activity affecting ion channels, production of cyclic adeno-
sine monophosphate, and regulation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase families involved with cellular signaling, proliferation, inva-
sion,andadhesion.50Cannabinoidsmayworktoinducecancercell
death through cellular signaling pathways leading to apoptosis.40
Munson et al51 published the first study examining the effects
ofTHContumorgrowth.Micewithlungadenocarcinomagivenoral
THC showed slowed tumor growth. Animals that were treated for
10 days demonstrated a dose-dependent retardation of tumor
growth. This initial study prompted further investigation of the
antitumor actions of THC.
Massi et al52 evaluated the in vitro antiproliferative ability of
CBD on human glioma cell lines. They found that adding CBD to
cell lines led to significant decreases in mitochondrial metabolism
and glioma cell viability. They also showed that the antiprolifera-
tive effect of CBD was correlated with the induction of apoptosis,
which was then reversed by cannabinoid antagonists. Cannabidiol
injected into mice also inhibited the growth of implanted human
glioma cells, suggesting the application of CBD as a potential anti-
neoplastic agent.
Sánchez et al53 examined the effects of CB2 receptor modula-
tion in cancer and demonstrated that local administration of selec-
tive CB2 agonists in mice induced a considerable regression of ma-
lignanttumorsgeneratedbyinoculationofC6gliomacells.Thisstudy
supports that the entire cannabinoid system may have implica-
tions on the treatment of cancer as opposed to just CB1 receptors.
Cannabinoids may play a role in preventing cancer metastasis.
Qamrietal54showedthattheCB2agonistJWH-133andtheCB1and
CB2 agonist WIN-55,212-2 inhibited cell proliferation and migration
under in vitro conditions, with replication of these results in mice
studies.MicetreatedwithJWH-133orWIN-55,212-2showeda40%
to 50% reduction in tumor growth and a 65% to 80% reduction in
lung metastases. This suggests that CB1 and CB2 receptors may be
involved in the metastatic process.
Finally, there has only been 1 clinical trial examining the effects
of THC on cancer. Guzmán et al55 studied intracranial administra-
tion of THC to 9 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme
whosesurgeryandradiotherapyhadfailed.TreatmentwithTHCde-
creasedtumorgrowthandtumorprogression,asassessedbymag-
netic resonance imaging and biomarker expression, in at least 2 of

There is concern regarding the addictive potential of cannabis.
The risk of dependence on cannabis is reported to be 9% in long-
term users,58 significantly less than the addiction rates of heroin,
cocaine, alcohol, and prescribed anxiolytics.56(pp92-100)
Conclusions
Cannabis in oncology may have potential in its use for anticipatory
and refractory CINV, refractory cancer pain, and as an antitumor
agent; however, much of the data are based on animal studies and
small clinical trials. In addition, many published studies are out-
dated. More research is needed in all areas related to the therapeu-
ticuseofcannabis,THC,and/orothercannabinoids.Currently,can-
nabis is not a primary means of treatment for any cancer or
treatment-related adverse effect. However, as marijuana legaliza-
tion, access, and research increases, this may change.
