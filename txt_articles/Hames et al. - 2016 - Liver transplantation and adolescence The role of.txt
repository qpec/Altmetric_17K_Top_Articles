Abstract 
Young people (YP) with chronic illness have higher rates of mental health problems than the 
general population, with psychosocial complexity associated with non-adherence (NA) and 
poorer health outcomes. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of anxiety and 
depression in YP post-liver transplant (LT), with autoimmune liver disease (AILD) and other 
chronic liver diseases, identify the factors YP attribute their distress to and the relationship 
between anxiety/depression, and describe YP’s beliefs about their illness and treatment.  An 
electronically-administered questionnaire battery was given routinely to YP attending an 
outpatient liver transition clinic. 187 YP participated, of which 17.7% screened positive for 
anxiety or depression. There were no significant differences between disease groups. This is 
significantly higher than the prevalence of common mental health problems in the general 
adolescent population. Patients most frequently attributed their distress to fatigue, sleep 
difficulties, financial concerns, problems at work/school, worry and low self-esteem. Higher 
levels of depression and anxiety were significantly associated with specific illness and 
treatment beliefs, but not with perceived understanding of illness or treatment control. In 
conclusion, the increased prevalence of mental health problems in this population and the 
intertwined nature of these with their physical health outcomes provide evidence that holistic 
care should be delivered as standard for this age group.

Introduction 
Adolescents have inferior graft-survival rates than younger children and adults across all 
solid organ transplant groups (1). This appears to be partially attributable to the high rates of 
non-adherence (NA) to medication which is highly prevalent amongst this age group and 
during transition into adult services (2). Adolescence is also the peak time for the onset of 
mental health problems, with up to 6% of 11-15 year olds in the UK estimated to have a 
diagnosable mental health problem (3). Rates of anxiety, depression and behavioural 
difficulties are further elevated in children and adolescents with physical health problems (4-
6). Specialised health programmes aimed at addressing the needs of young people (YP) 
during transition from paediatric to adult services have shown improvement of patient and 
graft survival in the transplant setting (7-8). However, it is unclear whether these 
programmes can also play a role in decreasing the risk of decompensation and need for 
transplantation in liver conditions such as autoimmune liver disease (AILD). A diagnosis of 
AILD between the ages of 14-20 years has been found to be independently predictive of 
liver-related death or need for liver transplantation compared to other age groups (9). In view 
of organ shortages, avoiding transplantation in these YP should be a priority. The focus on 
minimising NA in AILD aims to prevent avoidable transplantation, and in post LT aims to 
reduce graft loss, yet research and clinical care is often conducted separately for these 
populations. Other disease groups are seen in smaller numbers so are more difficult to 
conduct research in. Research is needed into whether these populations have different 
transitional health care needs so as to inform future clinical and research initiatives. 
 
Adolescents (12-18 years) and YP (16-25 years) with adverse psychosocial circumstances 
are at particular risk of NA and poor health outcomes (10-11). A prospective study of twenty 
YP post liver transplant (LT; mean age 22 years) found that psychosocial distress was 
significantly associated with NA one year after transition into the adult service (12). This 
indicates that a better understanding of YP’s mental health is required in order to improve

adherence management. To date there has been a paucity of studies which quantify the 
prevalence of common mental health problems amongst YP post LT or with AILD, or which 
compares these closely related illness groups to ascertain whether their needs are similar. 
Furthermore, little is known about the factors that are associated with YP’s distress, and 
whether their beliefs about their illness and treatment play a role.  
 
This study therefore aimed to identify, in a large cohort of YP (a) post LT, (b) with AILD and 
(c) other chronic liver diseases: 
1) The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression  
2) The factors YP attribute their distress to 
3) The relationship between anxiety, depression and YP’s beliefs about their illness and 
treatment 
4) Whether (1), (2) and (3) differ across the three illness groups  
 
Experimental Procedures 
 
Participants 
All YP attending the transition clinic at a tertiary liver centre in a London hospital between 
November 2013 and September 2015 contributed data to this analysis. The liver transition 
service is a multidisciplinary service dedicated to adolescents and YP, which aims to provide 
developmentally appropriate care and a smooth transition between the paediatric and adult 
service for YP with a range of liver conditions and post liver-transplant. The team includes 
consultant hepatologists, clinical nurse specialists, social workers and a clinical psychologist 
from across the paediatric and adult liver services. The service sees young people aged 16-
25 years old, with a median age of 18 years old. The patients were divided in three groups: 
those who had undergone LT, those with AILD and others. Clinical data collected included

diagnosis, age at diagnosis and /or LT, baseline liver function tests at the time of screening 
(serum bilirubin micromol/l, aminoaspartate transferase (AST) IU/l, gamma-glutidyl 
transpeptidase (GGT) IU/l.  
 
Methods 
IMPARTS (Integrating Mental and Physical Healthcare: Research, Training and Services) 
web-based screening system is used to collect patient-reported outcomes as part of routine 
clinical practice, and provide real-time, tailored referral advice (13). IMPARTS has ethical 
approval for data collected via the screening interface to be used for research purposes 
(REC: 12-SC-0422).   
Over the study period, implementation of IMPARTS was reliant on the availability of a 
hospital volunteer. All patients attending an outpatient appointment on the days that the 
volunteer was available during the study period were approached and given an information 
sheet explaining the purpose of screening. Patients then completed a series of electronically 
administered questionnaires using a tablet. This is a highly acceptable and feasible 
approach, data on which will be presented in a separate paper (Hames, unpublished data). 
As part of clinical practice, all YP screening positive for pMDD or pGAD were offered a 
referral to the Clinical Psychologist (CP). Agreement between the positive screen and the 
CP’s clinical judgement was recorded for the first 20 patients who screened positive for 
pMDD or pGAD.  
 
Measures 
The IMPARTS system contains a core set of measures, including the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ9) (14) and the Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire (GAD7) (15). The 
liver transition battery additionally includes the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) 
(16) and a modified distress thermometer (17). Outcome measurements were branched to

make them as short as possible and reduce clinical burden. The measures have robust 
psychometric properties and have been successfully used in adolescent populations. 
 
Depression 
The PHQ9 has good psychometric qualities and is recommended by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence for measurement of depression in patients with chronic physical 
health conditions (18). It has been found to have similar sensitivity and specificity in use with 
adolescents (19). Probable major depressive disorder (pMDD) was defined as scoring “more 
than half the days” or “nearly every day” on at least one of the first two items of the PHQ9 
(low mood and a loss of interest in activities) and on at least five out of all nine symptoms 
within the last two weeks. Item nine (“Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of 
hurting yourself in some way”) assessed suicidality, with scores of “more than half the days” 
or more indicating suicidal ideation. Patients who did not respond positively to the first two 
items, essential for pMDD diagnosis, did not receive the full questionnaire and were 
classified as having “no symptoms”. Patients completing the full questionnaire and not 
meeting criteria for pMDD were classed as having “some symptoms”. This categorical 
algorithm has an 83% (95%CI: 72-91) sensitivity and 90% (95%CI: 87-93) specificity for 
detecting cases of pMDD (20). Patients with pMDD were further categorized into those 
experiencing mild symptom severity (PHQ9 <15), moderate symptom severity (PHQ9 15-19) 
and severe symptom severity (PHQ9 20-27) (21).  
 
Anxiety 
The GAD7 has good reliability, sensitivity and specificity, as well as criterion, construct, 
factorial and procedural validity (15). A score of 10 or more on the GAD7 was used to 
identify cases of probable Generalised Anxiety Disorder (pGAD), and scores ranging 5-9 
indicated the presence of some anxiety symptoms.

Beliefs about Illness 
The 9-item BIPQ assesses illness beliefs along five dimensions (identity, cause, 
consequences, timeline and cure-control).The questionnaire asks patients to respond to 
questions using a 1-10 Likert scale, with each item mapping onto a separate factor. For 
example, Consequences: ‘how much does your illness affect your life? 0 (no affect at all) to 
10 (severely affects my life)’, Treatment Control:  ‘how much do you think your treatment can 
help your illness? 0(not at all) to 10 (extremely helpful), Emotional Response: How much 
does your condition affect you emotionally? 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The measure has 
robust psychometric qualities (16) and has been found to predict health behaviours in 
numerous conditions, including adherence to medication in adolescents and YP (22). 
 
Psychological Distress Thermometer 
The distress thermometer (DT) is a screening questionnaire widely used in oncology care to 
capture a patient’s level of distress and the factors contributing to it (17). The DT and its cut-
off scores have been validated in several adult cancer populations (23) and its use is 
recommended as part of routine care for teenagers and young adults with cancer (24). The 
DT was adapted for use in YP with liver disease by the clinical team, adjusting the problem 
list to include areas most commonly affected by liver disease, and piloted with 10 YP. The 
measure asks YP to rate their distress on a visual analogue scale (of a thermometer) from 0 
(none) to 10 (lots) how ‘worried or upset you have been feeling about things over the past 
week, including today’. They are then asked to identify ‘which of the following the worry or 
upset is mostly about’ and asked to select the relevant items from a problem list. The 
problems are organised into domains of Practical Issues, Lifestyle, Emotional Problems and 
Physical Problems, with a free text box for any problem not included. Interpretation was 
restricted to the problem list rather than the numerical score, as the tool has not yet been 
validated in this population.

Statistical Methods 
The prevalence of pMDD and pGAD were quantified as the proportion of patients screening 
positive according to the thresholds and cut-offs defined above, from baseline screening 
encounters. Responses to the distress thermometer items were also quantified and mean 
distress scores reported for the total sample as well as the three diagnostic groups.  
 
Differences in continuous mental health data between the three patient groups were 
assessed using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test for data that were not normally 
distributed. Differences in categorical mental health data between the three patient groups 
were assessed by dummy coding the variables and using Chi-square tests.  
 
For correlation analyses, continuous indicators of depression and anxiety severity were 
calculated using responses for items 1 and 2 of the PHQ9 and GAD7 respectively, creating a 
continuous measure from 0 (low symptom severity) to 6 (high symptom severity). This was 
done to take into account the branching mechanism in place to reduce questionnaire burden 
- all patients complete the first two items of these measures, whereas only those showing 
symptoms continue to complete the remaining items. Scores of depression and anxiety 
severity were correlated with BIPQ scores using pairwise correlation analyses, with r of <0.1 
indicate a small effect size, 0.1-0.3 indicating small-medium effect size, 0.3-0.5 indicating 
medium-large effect size, and >0.5 indicating a large effect size (25).  
 
Results 
A total of 187 patients were screened, representing 82% of the total number of patients 
attending an outpatient appointment when screening was available. The mean age was 18 
years (range 15-23 years), of which 53% were female. Limited patient time and problems

with the Wi-Fi connection were reported as the most common reasons for not screening a 
patient. There were no significant differences between those who were and were not 
screened in terms of age, gender or the proportion of patients who had a liver transplant 
(Table 1).  As the distress thermometer was added to the questionnaire set after screening 
started, these data are only available for 182 (78.2%) of patients in total. Figure 1 illustrates 
the underlying liver disease of our patient population, overall 51 (27.3%) patients were post 
LT, 69 (36.9%) were AILD (autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis n=22) and 67 (35.8%) were 
categorised into the “other” group. After AILD, biliary atresia (BA) was the most common 
diagnosis in 35 patients with 21 patients transplanted and 14 alive with their native liver. Six 
patients were listed for LT at the time of screening (2 with AILD and 4 with BA). Three 
patients with BA were re-listed for LT, 4 others had been re-transplanted. The median age at 
LT was 4.2 years (range 0.07-20.6 years). 
 
The prevalence of depression and anxiety 
Table 2 shows the sample characteristics for the total group and broken down by diagnostic 
group. The three groups showed similar ages, gender distribution, depression characteristics 
and anxiety. In total, 9.7% (95%CI: 5.4, 14.0) of the sample reported pMDD and 2.2% 
(95%CI: 0.0, 4.3) reported suicidal ideation. A total of 14.5% (95%CI: 9.4, 19.6) had pGAD, 
with 5.3% (95%CI: 2.1, 8.6) reporting severe symptoms (GAD7 score >15). Total prevalence 
of pMDD and/or pMGAD was 17.7%. 
 
Of the first 20 YP who screened positive for depression or anxiety, 50% were already known 
to the CP or a mental health service. Based upon the CP’s clinical judgement, 18 out of the 
20 cases were deemed to have been correctly identified as having anxiety and/or 
depression. The remaining two were considered to be false positives. These impressions

were based either on clinical interviews or by reviewing documentation from local mental 
health services.  
 
Preliminary analyses revealed a significant association between gender and anxiety, with a 
significantly higher proportion of females reporting pGAD in comparison to males (20.4% vs 
8.0%, p=0.02). There was no association between gender and depression (males = 6.8% vs 
females = 12.2%, p=0.28). There was a significant association between age and anxiety, 
with higher age relating to increased anxiety severity (r=0.21, p=0.004), however age was 
not associated with depression severity (r=0.08, p=0.27). 
 
In comparison to patients with “other” liver diseases, YP with LT and AILD reported 
significantly higher levels of psychological distress, rated on a 0-10 visual analogue scale: 
the mean ranks for psychological distress in LT, AILD and “other” patients are 4649.0, 
6844.5 and 5159.5 respectively, with a Kruskall-Wallis chi-square test showing significance 
beyond the 0.05 level: x2(2) = 8.3, p=0.02. Patients in the “other” group had significantly 
higher levels of suicidal ideation: x2(2) = 7.4, p=0.02. The four patients reporting suicidal 
ideation were females aged 16-20 years old who all had long-standing mental health 
problems for which they were being treated by local mental health services.  
 
Areas of specific psychological distress 
The psychological distress thermometer identified specific areas causing distress to YP. 
There were no significant differences between the three treatment groups (Figure 2). 
The six most commonly-reported areas of distress across the overall sample were fatigue 
(42.3%), money (30.8%), feeling worried (30.2%), concerns about work/school (29.1%), not

feeling good about themselves (27.5%), and sleep (27.5%). The top six reported worries 
varied slightly across the three illness groups (Table 3).  
 
Associations with illness perceptions 
Table 4 shows the illness perceptions associated with increasing severity of depression and 
anxiety. Higher levels of depression were associated with increased anxiety severity (r=0.59, 
p<0.001), increased perceptions of illness consequences (r=0.37, p<0.001), a reduced 
perception of personal control (r=-0.17, p=0.02), increased perceptions of illness identity 
(r=0.40, p<0.001), concern (r=0.38, p<0.001) and emotional response (r=0.50, p<0.001).  
Increased levels of anxiety were associated with increased perceptions of illness 
consequences (r=0.44, p<0.001) and timeline (r=0.15, p=0.04), a reduced perception of 
personal control (r=-0.17, p=0.02), increased perceptions of illness identity (r=0.49, 
p<0.001), concern (r=0.45, p<0.001) and emotional response (r=0.53, p<0.001). Neither 
anxiety (r= -0.14, p=0.07) nor depression (r=0.06, p=0.43) were associated with perceived 
understanding of illness or treatment control. Neither gender nor age were associated with 
illness perceptions. 
 
 
Discussion 
This is the first large cohort study to investigate the rate of anxiety and depression in YP post 
LT and to compare them with YP with AILD and other chronic liver conditions. As this data 
was collected as part of routine practice, the opt-in rate is much higher than might otherwise 
be expected (82%) and is likely to have improved the representativeness of the sample and 
generalizability of the findings. Using the PHQ9 and GAD7 17.7% of YP screened positive 
for anxiety or depression, without any differences between the three illness groups. This is 
higher compared to the estimated 4-6% (males and females respectively) in the general 
adolescent population, holding in mind that different measurement methods and participant 
age range were used (3). Four participants reported suicidal ideation. As suicide is the

leading cause of death amongst young men in the UK (26), it is essential that this risk is 
identified and ameliorated with evidence-based interventions.    
 
There were strong associations between participants’ perceived emotional impact of the 
illness (Emotional Response) and both depression and anxiety, and medium associations 
between how concerned YP were about their illness (Concern), how many symptoms they 
experienced (Identity), and how much impact they felt the illness had on their life 
(Consequences) with both anxiety and depression. This indicates that YP’s mood difficulties 
are intertwined with their illness rather than merely co-existing, and that their beliefs about 
their illness/treatment should be targeted as part of routine care rather than treating the 
mental health problems in isolation from their liver care. Given previous research findings, it 
is reasonable to hypothesize that these beliefs and mental health problems might also 
interact with (non)adherence (12).  As these are correlations, it is unclear whether 
depression/anxiety influences YP’s perception of their illness, or whether negative beliefs 
about illness and treatment are directly contributing to their mood difficulties, or indeed both.  
 
The lack of association between both participants’ perceived understanding of their illness 
and their beliefs as to how much treatment can help (treatment control) with depression/ 
anxiety is also interesting. Transition care emphasises the need for education about 
condition and treatment, with an assumption that this improves self-management skills. Here 
YP reported that their understanding of illness did not impact on their level of distress, 
suggesting that their concerns are not related to a lack of knowledge, but more with their 
illness beliefs. Effective education should therefore target individuals’ specific illness beliefs. 
 
The factors that YP attribute their distress clustered under psychological stresses, physical 
complaints and practical stressors. Psychological stresses included worry (30%) and low

self-esteem (27.5%). Amongst physical complaints, almost half of participants cited fatigue. 
Nearly a third of participants also cited sleep difficulties, allowing speculation as to whether 
the levels of fatigue reported are an inevitable symptom of these conditions or whether some 
of the fatigue experienced may be mediated by poor sleep habits. Sleep difficulties have 
been identified previously as one of the most distressing symptoms for adolescents with LT, 
and are negatively correlated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in both children (27) 
and adolescents (28). Fatigue in LT is reported to have a negative impact on relationships, 
due to the adjustments adolescents needs to make in their life (29). Amongst adolescents 
with AILD fatigue has been negatively associated with HRQOL (30). Psychological 
interventions for sleep problems are highly effective (31-32) and should be evaluated for this 
population as a priority.  
 
Medication was a concern for those with AILD in particular, which would be highly pertinent 
to explore in the context of NA. Practical stresses also scored highly, including financial 
concerns in 30% of the sample, problems with school/employment in 29% and relationship 
difficulties in the LT (27%) and AILD (33%) groups in particular. This echoes findings from 
qualitative studies that, despite striving for normality, the transplant was perceived to have a 
negative impact on their schooling in adolescence (29) and on relationships in young 
adulthood (33). Similarly, in adolescents with AILD, physical symptoms were associated with 
poorer school performance (30). The potential interaction of these concerns should not be 
underestimated, as sleeping problems and fatigue could interfere with school and work 
performance and lead to financial concerns. Occupational functioning is a concern in the LT 
setting with unemployment rates of 50% in adults post LT and of 20% in young adults who 
were transplanted in childhood (34-35). In a recent study of 36 patients aged 16-35 years old 
post-LT for biliary atresia, 22% were unemployed at the time of their last follow up (36), this 
being considerably higher than the UK unemployment rate in YP of 13.7% (37). As this study 
was conducted in the UK, medications were provided on prescription through the national

health service (NHS) and so financial factors are unlikely to be a barrier to adherence to 
medication. However this should be explored in other countries where costs may have an 
impact.  
 
The above concerns should be pre-empted and taken seriously by clinicians within the 
routine clinic review, both to engage the YP in discussing their most pertinent concerns and 
to facilitate appropriate onward referrals. As most of the concerns raised (including anxiety 
and depression) are amendable to intervention, this could dramatically improve patient care 
and optimise YP’s health, wellbeing and educational/occupational outcomes. Routine 
integration of screening questionnaires within clinical practice is an easy and effective way of 
identifying these common mental health problems and illness beliefs. Some problems may 
require referral onto a specialist, but others may be amendable to intervention within the 
consultation; for example, by writing support letters to school, discussing concerns about 
side-effects, and advising on sleep hygiene strategies.  
 
Psychosocial distress has been correlated with NA in both adolescents (11) and YP (12), 
and so addressing these issues is likely to also impact on physical health outcomes. 
Targeting interventions to illness beliefs have been shown to improve adherence (38), even 
when delivered in low-intensity protocol. For example, an 18-week intervention for young 
adults with asthma delivered through text-messages targeted at their specific illness beliefs 
significantly improved both participants’ beliefs about their illness and treatment and their 
adherence rates as compared with controls (39).  The findings of this research will help to 
inform the development of such targeted interventions for this population. 
 
There are number of limitations of this study. Presence of anxiety or depression was based 
upon robust self-report measures. A clinical psychologist’s judgement agreed with 18 out of

the first 20 positive screens, but this was not validated with a standardised diagnostic 
interview. As data was collected as part of routine practice and participants were aware that 
their clinician would see their responses, this has the potential to influence their honesty of 
reporting – although would be more likely to result in under- rather than over-reporting of 
difficulties.  Furthermore, this enabled recruitment of a more representative sample, as well 
as providing participants with direct input for their identified difficulties as part of their clinical 
care.   
 
Particular strengths of the study include the large sample size, comparisons across three 
pertinent liver diagnostic groups, use of robust standardized measures, and enabling themes 
that have been identified in small sample qualitative research to be quantified and 
statistically correlated with clinical levels of psychopathology. In addition, this study focused 
on YP aged 16-25 (rather than younger adolescents), which has been shown to be a 
particularly vulnerable but under researched group.  
 
In conclusion, our data demonstrates that there is a high level of anxiety and depression 
amongst YP with chronic liver disease and LT. Both anxiety and depression were strongly 
associated with YP’s beliefs about their illness and treatment. There are a wide range of 
factors that YP attribute this distress to, most of which are amendable to psychosocial 
interventions. Enquiry into YP’s psychosocial circumstances should be included within 
routine liver care. Focus should be expanded beyond transplant populations to include YP 
with chronic conditions which can result in transplantation if poorly controlled, as they report 
similar level of difficulties and areas of concern. Further studies are needed to elucidate how 
distress is associated with adherence with medication and engagement with services, as 
well as intervention studies to evaluate the effectiveness of approaches in reducing the 
identified sleep difficulties, mental health problems and addressing illness beliefs.
