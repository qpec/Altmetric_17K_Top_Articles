Methods

Similarly
to
our
recent
studies
of
hydrochlorothiazide,1,2 we identified histologically verified
melanoma cases (January 2004 to December 2015), each
matched 1:10 (risk-set sampling; age, sex, and date) to cancer-
free population controls. We required cases and controls to be
between ages 18 and 90 years, without previous history of can-
cer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), organ transplanta-
tion, HIV infection, or azathioprine use, and to have resided
continuously in Denmark for 10 years.
Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated odds
ratios(ORs),with95%CIs,formelanomaassociatedwithcumu-
lative hydrochlorothiazide use compared with never-use,
adjustingforpotentialconfounders(Table1and2).Weperformed
stratified analyses by localization, stage, histologic subtype,
and subgroups of age, sex, and history of nonmelanoma skin
cancer. To evaluate potential confounding by indication, we
performedanalysesforotherantihypertensivedrugs,including
bendroflumethiazide,angiotensin-convertingenzymeinhibitors,
angiontensin-II receptor antagonists, and calcium-channel
blockers. This study was approved by Statistics Denmark and
the Danish Data Protection Agency.
Results | We identified 22 010 cases of melanoma. After
exclusions, the final study population comprised 19 273
cases and 192 730 population controls. Cases had slightly
lower comorbidity, higher educational level, and higher
prevalence of previous nonmelanoma skin cancer than
controls.Remainingcharacteristicsweresimilarbetweencases
and controls.
Overall,413cases(2.1%)and3406controls(1.8%)wereclas-
sifiedashigh-users(≥50000mg)ofhydrochlorothiazide,yield-
ing an adjusted OR of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.09-1.36) for melanoma.
Nocleardose-responsepatternemergedbetweenhydrochloro-
thiazideuseandmelanomarisk(Table1).Analysesbymelanoma
localization, stage, age, sex, and history of nonmelanoma skin
cancer yielded results comparable to the main analysis (data
not shown). When stratifying by histological subtype (Table 2),
higher ORs occurred for nodular melanoma (n = 1695 cases
[8.8%]; OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.54-2.72; P for trend = .01) and
lentigo melanoma (n = 500 cases [2.6%]; OR, 1.61; 95% CI,
1.03-2.50;Pfortrend = .16)thanforsuperficialspreadingmela-
noma (n = 13 781 cases [72%]; OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.97-1.27; P for
trend = .73).
In secondary analyses, we observed associations close
to the null for overall melanoma risk with long-term use of
bendroflumethiazide (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19; P
for trend = 0.47), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.99-1.16; P for trend = .53), angiotensin-II
receptor antagonists (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29;
P for trend = .07), and calcium-channel blockers (OR, 1.06;
95% CI, 0.97-1.14; P for trend = .94). These associations
remained neutral in subanalyses stratified by melanoma
subtype (data not shown).

 Discussion | The main strength of our study is the use of high-
qualitynationwideregistrydata.3Themainlimitationsarealack
ofinformationonriskfactorssuchassunexposure,skinpigmen-
tation,andfamilyhistoryofmelanoma.However,thesecharac-
teristics are unlikely to be substantially associated with hydro-
chlorothiazideuse,andthusunlikelytoconfoundoutestimates.
Thiazide use and melanoma risk has been investigated in a
fewpreviousstudies;however,only2studies,4,5bothfromnorth-
ernDenmark,havespecificallyexaminedhydrochlorothiazide.
ThefirststudyreportedanORof1.32(95%CI,1.03-1.70)formela-
noma risk overall associated with 10 000 mg increments of
hydrochlorothiazide.4 The corresponding OR for hydrochloro-
thiazide in combination with amiloride was 1.43 (95% CI,
1.09-1.88).4 The other study found no association between hy-
drochlorothiazideusecombinedwithamilorideandmelanoma
risk (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78-1.33).5 Neither of these studies in-
cluded dose-response or histology-specific analyses.
The findings for melanoma subtype are somewhat surpris-
ing,aslentigoandsuperficialspreadingmelanomaareknownto

nodularmelanomasislesselucidated.6Itisworryingthathydro-

LESS IS MORE
Use of Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
in Hospitalized Patients
National guidelines1 recommend objective risk stratification
for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized medical
patients. The Padua Prediction Score risk assessment model2
is recommended to categorize patients as high or low risk. The
Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS), a state-
wide quality collaborative aimed at preventing adverse events
in hospitalized medical patients, collects detailed data on VTE
risk factors, prophylactic treatment, and outcomes. Using data
from the HMS,3 we sought to determine whether patients in
this cohort were receiving appropriate VTE prophylaxis.
Methods | Patients admitted to a non–intensive care medicine
unit for 2 or more days were eligible for inclusion; data were
collectedthroughastandardizedprocessateachhospital.Using
the Padua Prediction Score risk assessment model,2 we cat-
egorized patients on admission as low or high risk for VTE
events. For high-risk patients, contraindications to pharma-
cologic prophylaxis were assessed. Excessive VTE prophy-
laxis was defined as pharmacologic or mechanical prophy-
laxis for low-risk patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis for
high-risk patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation,
and the combination of pharmacologic and mechanical pro-
phylaxis in all cases. Underuse of VTE prophylaxis was de-
fined as no pharmacologic prophylaxis in high-risk patients
without a contraindication to anticoagulation and no prophy-
laxis (pharmacologic or mechanical) in high-risk patients with
a contraindication to anticoagulation. Appropriate pharma-
cologic prophylaxis included any of the following on day 1
and/orday2oftheindexhospitalization:heparin,5000Utwice
daily; heparin, 5000 U 3 times daily; heparin, 7500 U 3 times
daily (for morbid obesity); enoxaparin, 40 mg/d; enoxaparin,
30 mg/d (for creatinine clearance <30 mL/min); enoxaparin,
30 mg twice daily; dalteparin, 5000 U daily; or fondaparinux
2.5 mg/d. The HMS-defined contraindications include any of
the following: bleeding present upon hospital admission; in-
tracranial hemorrhage within the past year; other hemor-
rhage within the last 6 months; coagulopathy, hemophilia, or
other significant bleeding disorder; and platelet levels lower
than 50 × 103/μL (to convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 1.0).
Hospitals were rank ordered according to rates of excess VTE
prophylaxis across low- and high-risk patients and rates of un-
deruse of VTE prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Rank of hos-
pital excess use and underuse of VTE prophylaxis were com-
pared using a Pearson correlation coefficient.
Excessive VTE prophylaxis was assessed using descrip-
tivevariables.Oddsratios,95%CIs,andPvaluesforexcesspro-
phylaxis were calculated using logistic generalized estimat-
ing equation models, accounting for hospital clustering.
Findings were considered significant at P < .05. Because the
purpose of the HMS is to measure and improve the quality of
existing medical practice, this project received a “not regu-
lated” status by the University of Michigan Medical School in-
stitutional review board.
Results | Between January 1, 2015, and December 21, 2016, data
were collected on 44 775 eligible patients across 52 Michigan
hospitals. Mean (SD) patient age was 64.7 (18.4) years; 24 742
(55.3%) were women. The mean (SD) length of hospital stay
was 4.4 (4.6) days (median, 3.0 days). Of the eligible patients,
32 549 were assessed as low-risk for VTE, whereas 1804 were
at high risk with a contraindication for pharmacologic pro-
phylaxis and 10 422 were at high risk without a contraindica-
tion for pharmacologic prophylaxis.
