G.K. Wilcock et al. / Low Dose LMTM as Alzheimer Monotherapy
Abstract.
Background: LMTM is being developed as a treatment for AD based on inhibition of tau aggregation.
Objectives: To examine the efficacy of LMTM as monotherapy in non-randomized cohort analyses as modified primary
outcomes in an 18-month Phase III trial in mild AD.
Methods: Mild AD patients (n = 800) were randomly assigned to 100 mg twice a day or 4 mg twice a day. Prior to unblinding,
the Statistical Analysis Plan was revised to compare the 100 mg twice a day as monotherapy subgroup (n = 79) versus 4 mg
twice a day as randomized (n = 396), and 4 mg twice a day as monotherapy (n = 76) versus 4 mg twice a day as add-on therapy
(n = 297), with strong control of family-wise type I error.
Results: The revised analyses were statistically significant at the required threshold of p < 0.025 in both comparisons for
change in ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, MRI atrophy, and glucose uptake. The brain atrophy rate was initially typical of mild AD
inbothadd-onandmonotherapygroups,butafter9monthsoftreatment,therateinmonotherapypatientsdeclinedsignificantly
to that reported for normal elderly controls. Differences in severity or diagnosis at baseline between monotherapy and add-on
patients did not account for significant differences in favor of monotherapy.
Conclusions: The results are consistent with earlier studies in supporting the hypothesis that LMTM might be effective as
monotherapy and that 4 mg twice a day may serve as well as higher doses. A further suitably randomized trial is required to
test this hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), clinical deterioration
[1], imaging markers of loss of neuronal function
[2–4], and progression of brain atrophy as measured
by MRI volumetry [5] progress in parallel with the
accumulation of aggregated tau. Proteolytically sta-
ble aggregates of tau protein can be measured in
the neocortex in the prodromal phase of the disease
from Braak stage 2 onwards [6–8], which occurs at
least 20 years before neurofibrillary pathology is seen
in neocortex or dementia symptoms appear [9], and
the levels increase exponentially as the disease pro-
gresses [8]. Tau protein has the capacity to form toxic
proteolytically resistant oligomers which seed fur-
ther tau aggregation in an autocatalytic manner [10]
and propagate the pathology into previously healthy
brain regions [11], most likely accounting for the
stereotyped pattern of spread of pathology [6, 7, 12].
Targeting tau protein aggregation therefore offers an
attractive therapeutic possibility as a disease modify-
ing treatment of AD.
A
Phase
II
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
tested the potential utility of the methylthion-
inium moiety (MT) as monotherapy in mild to
moderate AD in patients not taking cholinesterase
inhibitors or memantine. This study, using the
oxidized form of MT (as methylthioninium chloride,
MTC) as monotherapy, showed that MT at a dose
of 138 mg/day produced a significant treatment
effect on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment
Scale–cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) at 24 weeks
compared with placebo, supported by evidence of
benefit on the functional neuroimaging outcomes
(hexa-methyl-propyl-amine-oxime
single
photon
emission computed tomography (HMPAO-SPECT)
[13] and
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emis-
sion tomography (18F-FDG-PET) [14]). A newly
developed form of the MT moiety, as leuco-
methylthioninium
bis(hydromethanesulphonate)
(LMTM), is much better absorbed than the oxidized
MTC tested previously [13, 15] and has been
taken forward for Phase III clinical trials. As the
dihydromethanesulfonate salt, LMTM stabilizes the
reduced form of the MT moiety in the solid state.
Following absorption, the dissociated MT moiety is
distributed and excreted in an equilibrium between
oxidized and reduced forms that depends on the
local pH and redox environment.
The as-randomised analysis of an earlier Phase III
trial (TRx237-015) has been reported [16]. Both stud-
ies were designed to compare higher doses of LMTM
in the range 150–250 mg/day with a low dose of
4 mg twice a day intended as a urinary discolorant to
maintain blinding. It was assumed that this low dose
would be ineffective, since a dose of 69 mg MT/day
as MTC was found to have reduced efficacy in the
Phase II study [13]. Neither of the Phase III studies
showed any difference on primary or secondary out-
comes between the high doses and 4 mg twice a day
in the as-randomized comparisons. In the first study,
treatment status with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or
memantine was found to be a significant covariate in
the primary analysis model [16]. Exploratory anal-
yses showed that this was due to significantly lower
rates of progression on clinical and brain atrophy end-

points in patients receiving any of the LMTM doses
as monotherapy, including 4 mg twice a day, which
did not appear to be explicable by cohort differences
in severity at baseline.
The results of study TRx-237-015, which became
available prior to database lock and unblinding of the
present study, suggested the hypothesis that LMTM
might be effective only as monotherapy and that the
minimum effective dose might be substantially lower
for LMTM than that previously identified using MTC
[13, 15]. As the originally intended analysis was
unlikely to achieve its intended purpose, we modi-
fied the primary analyses and treatment comparisons
in the TRx-237-005 Statistical Analysis Plan prior to
database lock and unblinding to investigate whether
the monotherapy differences could be confirmed as
observational cohort comparisons defined as primary
outcomes with strong control of family-wise type I
error in the second independent study. The monother-
apy cohort comparisons which were of particular
interest in light of the earlier study were: (A) 100 mg
twice a day a monotherapy compared with 4 mg twice
a day as originally randomized, and (B) 4 mg twice
a day as monotherapy compared with 4 mg twice a
day as add-on to standard AD treatments. Each of
these comparisons was required to reach a statisti-
cal threshold of 0.025 on both cognitive (ADAS-cog)
and functional (ADCS-ADL) outcomes for the
analysis to meet the modified primary statistical
endpoints.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants, randomization
and masking, and outcomes
The study was designed as an 18-months phase III,
randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group
trial conducted at 108 sites in Canada, United States,
Australia, and Europe. Eligible patients had to be
younger than 90 years with a diagnosis of probable
AD according to criteria from the National Institute
of Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association, with mild
severity defined by Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) score of 20–26 inclusive and a Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) total score of 0.5 or 1.0.
Concomitant use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or
memantine (or both) was permitted provided this was
at a stable dose for at least 18 weeks before random-
ization to minimize the initial symptomatic effects
of these treatments. Concomitant use of serotonergic
antidepressant, antipsychotic (except clozapine or
olanzapine), and sedative medications was also per-
mitted at stable doses where clinically feasible. Each
patient had one or more study partners participate
with them in the trial. Patients were excluded from the
study if they had a significant CNS disorder other than
AD. A detailed list of inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria is in the protocol provided in the Supplementary
Materials.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive LMTM
100 mg twice a day (expressed as methylthioninium
base equivalent) or LMTM 4 mg twice a day. The
low dose was selected as a control to permit masking
for potential urinary discoloration and was assumed
to be inactive in light of the earlier Phase II study
using MTC [13]. The randomization was stratified
according to geographical region (two levels: North
America or Europe/Australia), use of AD-labeled
comedications (two levels: using or not using), and
severity of AD (two levels: CDR 0.5 or CDR 1.0).
The randomization file and investigational medici-
nal product kit list were unavailable to personnel
involved in conducting the study and analyzing the
data. Study participants, their informant(s), and all
assessors remained masked to treatment assignment
throughout the study, and safety assessors were not
permitted to be involved in the primary efficacy
assessments.
The two doses were provided in identical blis-
ter packages as identically appearing oral tablets
to be taken for up to 78 weeks. The co-primary
outcomes were the 11-item Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog)
and the 23-item Alzheimer’s Disease Co-operative
Study–Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale
measured at baseline and every 13 weeks there-
after, with the final on-treatment visit at week 78,
and a final off-treatment safety assessment at week
82. Other outcomes included the Alzheimer’s Dis-
ease Cooperative Study–Clinical Global Impression
of Change scale (ADCS-CGIC), administered by an
independent rater at the same visits as ADAS-cog and
ADCS-ADL, and MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inven-
tory (NPI), and Montgomery-˚
Asberg Rating Scale
(MADRS, administered at screening and weeks 26,
52, and 78 with MMSE again at week 82). MRI scans
were undertaken at baseline or screening and at weeks
13, 26, 39, 52, 65, and 78 (or at early termination)
using a standardized protocol at all sites and volu-
metric analyses were performed by a central imaging
core laboratory (BioClinica). Volumetric data were
used to measure changes in lateral ventricular vol-
 438
G.K. Wilcock et al. / Low Dose LMTM as Alzheimer Monotherapy
ume, whole brain volume, and estimated mean of left
and right for temporoparietal and hippocampal vol-
umes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (18F-FDG-PET)
imaging was done at screening and weeks 39 and
78. Changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau,
phospho-tau, and amyloid-�1–42 between baseline
(any time during screening before first dose of study
drug) and week 78 (or early termination) were mea-
sured in a subsample of patients who consented to a
lumbar puncture. Resource Utilization in Dementia
(RUD)-lite instrument score was also determined but
is not reported at this time.
Patients were monitored throughout the study
for adverse events using clinical laboratory tests
(including measurement of methaemoglobin by pulse
CO-oximetry), physical and neurological examina-
tions, and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) at all
clinic visits (screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 6,
13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, and 82). Patients were also
assessed at all visits for suicidal ideation and intent
using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
[17], and were systematically monitored for poten-
tial serotonin syndrome using a rating scale derived
from four published diagnostic criteria [18], because
of a theoretical potential for serotonin syndrome [19].
By protocol, amyloid related imaging abnormalities,
serotonin toxicity, and suicidality were reported as
serious adverse events.
Statistical analysis
Post-hoc analyses of the earlier trial in mild to
moderate AD trial (TRx-237-015 [16]) suggested
the hypothesis that LMTM might be effective only
as monotherapy. We therefore revised the originally
intended primary analysis prior to database lock and
data unblinding to examine whether differences in
favor of monotherapy could be confirmed as primary
outcomes in non-randomized observational cohort
comparisons based on the use of a two-sided test
with an � of 0.025 to control family-wise Type I
error. The final Statistical Analysis Plan is provided
in Supplementary Materials. The primary statistical
tests were (Comparison A) comparison of patients
receiving 100 mg twice a day as monotherapy with
the control arm as randomized (all patients receiv-
ing 4 mg twice a day regardless of AD comedication
status with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or meman-
tine), and (Comparison B) comparison of patients
receiving 4 mg twice a day as monotherapy with those
receiving 4 mg twice a day as add-on to approved AD-
labelled treatments. Exploratory analyses included
comparison of patients receiving 100 mg twice a day
as monotherapy with those receiving 100 mg twice
a day as add-on to approved AD-labelled treatments
(Comparison C), and comparisons according to co-
medication status with approved AD treatments in
patients receiving either dose of LMTM as pooled
subgroups.
The primary analyses were performed in the mod-
ified intent-to-treat (mITT) population defined to
include all randomized subjects who took at least
one dose of the study drug and had both a base-
line and at least one post-baseline non-follow-up
efficacy assessment. The primary analyses were spec-
ified as a mixed model, repeated-measures analysis
with an unstructured covariance matrix and no impu-
tation for missing data. The model included visit
(six levels corresponding to assessments at weeks
13, 26, 39, 52, 65, and 78), treatment group (two
levels, 4 mg or 100 mg twice a day), baseline sever-
ity (CDR, two levels), geographic region (two levels:
US/Canada, Europe/Australia) and baseline ADAS-
cog or ADCS-ADL score. Alzheimer’s-comedication
status at baseline (two levels: current ongoing use
or not ongoing use) was included in the model as
the interaction terms: status x treatment and sta-
tus x visit. The individual tests were implemented
through contrasts. We used the same method for all
secondary analyses in predefined gated sequences
such that no further adjustment of � (0.025) was
needed. Further sensitivity analyses were under-
taken to determine whether baseline differences
could account for differences in rate of progres-
sion by addition of a further term (baseline-variable
x visit) to the primary analysis model. Characteris-
tics tested included baseline score of the outcome of
interest, APOE �4 frequency, vascular pathology bur-
den (Fazekas score estimating the lesion load in the
brain),hippocampalatrophy,temporoparietalvolume
and temporal lobe SUVR determined by 18F-FDG-
PET. This rate-correction term was added as either a
continuous or categorical variable as appropriate.
The new Statistical Analysis Plan substituted the
primary monotherapy subgroup comparisons (Com-
parisons A and B) in an intended exploratory two
time-point analysis to compare whether the effect
sizes on the co-primary outcomes were larger at
18 months than at 9 months to support a treatment
effect on slope. Another prespecified exploratory
analysis investigated the primary and secondary out-
comes in CDR 0.5 and CDR 1.0 subgroups separately
according to the primary subgroup comparisons
(Comparisons A and B) and Comparison C as further

exploratory analysis. Finally, exploratory contrasts
comparing treatment subgroups according to dose
and AD comedication status were performed.
Exploratory post-hoc analyses were conducted to
compare within-cohort annualized rates of whole
brain atrophy in patients receiving LMTM as
monotherapy and as add-on initially and after 9
months of treatment using the same mixed model
except with time as a continuous variable. The annu-
alized rates output from this analysis for months 0–6
and months 12–18 respectively were compared with
the rates for mild AD and normal aging reported from
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) in years 1 and 2 using t-tests [20]. Decline
on the ADAS-cog scale in patients receiving LMTM
as monotherapy or as add-on therapy was also com-
pared with that reported for mild AD in the placebo
arms of recent Phase III studies [21, 22] and currently
available ADNI data (https://ida.loni.usc.edu/colla
boration/access/appLicense.jsp). Voxel-based mor-
phometry was used to compare monotherapy patients
at
baseline
with
elderly
controls
in
a
well-
characterized ongoing birth-cohort study [23] using
a statistical parametric mapping package in analyses
controlled for age, sex and total intracranial vol-
ume. Inferior temporal gyrus 18F-FDG-PET SUVR
normalized with respect to pons was determined at
baseline and compared with the values reported for
mild AD, MCI, and normal elderly controls using
the same methodology [24]. Frontal, parietal, and
temporal lobe 18F-FDG-PET SUVR data normal-
ized with respect to pons and cerebellum were also
analyzed. Coordinates permitting determination of
nucleus basalis volume were kindly provided by Ingo
Kilimann [25].
Safety analyses were based on the safety popu-
lation comprising all patients who received at least
one dose of study drug, with summaries presented
according to dose and AD co-medication status.
Data analyses specified in the Statistical Analy-
sis Plan were undertaken independently of the funder
by SynteractHCR (Carlsbad, CA, USA) using SAS
9.4 (Enterprise Guide v7.1). The results were verified
and additional exploratory analyses were provided by
one of the co-authors (BOS) using R version 3.3.0
(2016-05-03). Additional voxel-based morphometric
analyses were provided by VV, TA, and RTS using
the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) soft-
ware
package
(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).
This trial is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01689233) and the European Union Clinical
Trials Registry (21012-002847-28).

The funder of the study took the lead in study
design, undertaking the study, data interpretation, and
initial drafting of the report.
RESULTS
The baseline demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of the mITT population are presented
in Table 1 and the trial profile is presented in
Fig. 1 according to dose and treatment status with
cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. 419 of
606 (69%) patients taking LMTM in combina-
tion with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine
completed the study. Of those not receiving stan-
dard AD treatments, 100 of 155 (65%) completed
the study. The retention of patients receiving 100 mg
twice a day (217/373, 58%) was substantially lower
than for patients receiving 4 mg twice a day (302/388,
78%). 18F-FDG-PET data were available for 759
patients at baseline. Of these, 605 and 154 were
randomized to receive LMTM as add-on to stan-
dard treatments or as monotherapy, and 389 and 83,
respectively, had scans available at 78 weeks. Lum-
bar puncture data were available for 255 patients at
baseline, of whom 174 and 81, respectively, received
LMTM as add-on treatment or monotherapy, with 66
and 15, respectively, available at the end of the study.
Clinical efficacy outcomes
The treatment comparisons for the co-primary out-
comes as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan
finalized prior to database lock were significant at
the � threshold of 0.025 for 100 mg twice a day as
monotherapy compared with all patients receiving
4 mg twice a day as randomly assigned (ADAS-cog
effect size –3.14, 95% CI –5.32 to –0.97, p = 0.0047;
ADCS-ADL effect size 3·49, 95% CI 0.66 to 6.30,
p = 0.0157 [comparison A, Table 2a, Fig. 2]). The
treatment comparisons for the co-primary outcomes
were also significant at the � threshold of 0.025 for
4 mg twice a day as monotherapy compared with
4 mg twice a day as add-on to approved AD treat-
ments (ADAS-cog effect size –4·22, 95% CI –6.19 to
–2.24, p < 0.0001; ADCS-ADL effect size 4.85, 95%
CI 2.31 to 7.40, p = 0.0002 [Comparison B, Table 2a,
Fig. 2]). A similar comparison between 100 mg twice

similar results (ADAS-cog effect size –4·08, 95% CI

the required level of significance for ADCS-CGIC
(p = 0.0521) or MMSE (p = 0.0289). In the Compar-
ison B sequence, the 4 mg twice a day monotherapy
dose comparison with add-on therapy was significant
at the required level for ADCS-CGIC (p = 0.0007)
and MMSE (p = 0.0045). In the Comparison C
sequence, the 100 mg twice a day monotherapy dose
comparison with add-on therapy was significant for
ADCS-CGIC (p = 0.0053) and MMSE (p = 0.0007).
The treatment effects for MADRS and the total NPI
score were not significant in any of Comparisons A,
B, or C, although a directionally supportive differ-
ence in favor of monotherapy was seen for 4 mg twice
a day on the NPI carer distress scale (p = 0.0455).
The decline on the ADAS-cog scale seen in the
subgroups receiving LMTM as add-on was indistin-
guishable from the mean placebo decline reported in
two recent Phase III studies ([21, 22]; Supplementary
Figure 1). Exclusion of patients prescribed meman-
tine and a cholinesterase inhibitor in combination had
minimal effect on the differences seen in favor of
LMTM as monotherapy (Supplementary Table 2a, b).
In order to test whether baseline differences in sever-
ity or other factors could account for the significant
differences seen in favor of LMTM as monother-
apy, the primary analysis model was expanded to
include baseline severity, APOE �4 frequency, vas-
cular pathology rating on MRI, hippocampal volume,
temporoparietal volume, or baseline temporal lobe
18F-FDG-PET SUVR as rate-correction terms to cor-
rect for a possible effect on rate of progression.
Comparisons A, B, and C for ADAS-cog, ADCS-
ADL, and ventricular volume all remained significant
after applying this correction (Table 3a, b).
ComparisonsA,BandCwereexaminedinpatients
with CDR 0.5 or CDR 1.0 as separate subgroups
(Supplementary Table 3a, b). For the 4 mg twice a
day dose, the treatment differences in favor of LMTM
monotherapy compared with add-on (Comparison B)
were significant at the p < 0.025 threshold for ADAS-
cog, ADCS-ADL, and ADCS-CGIC in both CDR
severity subgroups. For the corresponding compar-
ison at the 100 mg twice a day dose (Comparison
C), ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL were both signifi-
cant at the p < 0.025 threshold only in the CDR 0.5
subgroup, but not in Comparison A at either severity
level. The treatment differences in favor of LMTM
monotherapy were found to increase significantly
over time when comparing treatment effects at 9 and
18 months according to Comparisons B and C, and in
Comparison A only for ADAS-cog (Supplementary
Table 4).

MRI, 18F-FDG-PET, and CSF outcomes
MRI volumetric outcomes for lateral ventricular
volume, whole brain volume, and hippocampal vol-
ume were analyzed according to Comparisons A,
B, and C (Table 4a and b, Fig. 3). All comparisons
were significantly in favor of LMTM monotherapy at
p ≤ 0.0002 except hippocampal volume in Compari-
son A. Similar comparisons in patients with CDR 0.5
or CDR 1.0 as separate subgroups (Supplementary
Table 5a, b) showed that the treatment differences in
favor of LMTM monotherapy were more consistent
for the 4 mg twice a day dose than for the 100 mg
twice a day dose at both severity levels.
The annualized rate of whole brain atrophy over
months 0–6 was indistinguishable in both monother-
apy and add-on therapy subgroups from those
reported [20] for mild AD (p = 0.6743 and p = 0.2663,
respectively), and significantly different from the rate
reported in normal elderly controls (p < 0.0001 for

both). After 9 months of treatment, the rate of pro-
gression of atrophy was significantly less than the
initial rate in patients receiving LMTM as monother-
apy (p = 0.0068; Table 5, Fig. 4), but not in patients
receiving LMTM as add-on therapy (p = 0.3182). The
final atrophy rate (months 12–18) in patients receiv-
ing LMTM as monotherapy was significantly less
than that reported for mild AD [20] (p < 0.0001)
but similar to normal elderly controls (p = 0.5238;
Fig. 4). In order to test whether this delayed reduc-
tion in rate of atrophy in monotherapy patients
could be explained by patients diagnosed clinically
as having AD but not having AD-type atrophy at
baseline, we undertook a comparison with a well
characterized normal aging cohort [23, 26] using
voxel-based morphometry. This confirmed that both
monotherapy and add-on therapy subgroups had sig-
nificantly greater atrophy at baseline than normal
elderly controls in frontal, temporal and parietal
lobes, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and
posterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 5A, B), although
add-on therapy patients had somewhat greater tem-
poroparietal atrophy than monotherapy patients
(Fig. 5C).

Using the same methodology as in the ADNI pro-
gram [24], baseline 18F-FDG-PET SUVR in inferior
temporal gyrus normalized with respect to pons was
less than that reported for mild AD [24] in both
monotherapy (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.0163, for left and
right, respectively) and add-on therapy subgroups
(p < 0.0001 for both left and right), and substantially
less than baseline values reported for MCI and elderly
control (p < 0.0001 for all; Supplementary Table 6).
The results were similar for angular gyrus. Decline
in SUVR normalized with respect to pons in frontal,
parietal and temporal lobes was significantly less over
18 months in patients receiving LMTM as monother-
apy at either the 4 mg or 100 mg twice day doses than
in those receiving the same doses as add-on therapy,
and in cerebellum only at the 4 mg twice a day dose
(Table 6A). These differences were already signifi-
cant at the 4 mg twice a day dose after 9 months in
parietal (p = 0.0143) and temporal (p = 0.0040; Fig. 6)
lobes, but not at the 100 mg twice a day dose. The
annual decline in glucose uptake in temporal lobe
was significantly less than reported for mild AD [24]
at both the 4 mg and 100 mg twice a day doses as
monotherapy (p < 0.0001 for both) and also as add-
on therapy (p = 0.0044 and p = 0.0355, respectively).
Decline in SUVR normalized with respect to cere-
bellum was likewise significantly less at both doses
for LMTM as monotherapy compared with add-on in
frontal and parietal cortices at both doses, but only at
100 mg twice a day in temporal cortex (Table 6B).
Since correction for differences in baseline whole
brain volume, temporoparietal volume, glucose
uptake, and clinical severity did not eliminate the
differences favoring patients receiving LMTM as
monotherapy over add-on patients, we examined the
potential role of relative basal forebrain atrophy. This
was determined relative to per-subject whole brain
volume to control for overall atrophy. Decline on

the ADAS-cog scale in patients receiving LMTM
as add-on to cholinesterase inhibitors was strongly
dependent on relative atrophy in nucleus basalis of
Meynert (Fig. 7A2; p = 0.0017) and nucleus accum-
bens (Fig. 7B2; p < 0.0001). In patients receiving
LMTM as add-on to memantine, the effect was
either weak (nucleus basalis: p = 0.0391; Fig. 7A3)
or absent (nucleus accumbens: p = 0.2453; Fig. 7B3).
Basal forebrain atrophy had no influence on treatment
outcome in patients receiving LMTM as monother-
apy, either for nucleus basalis (p = 0.5746; Fig. 7A4)
or for nucleus accumbens (p = 0.1355; Fig. 7B4). In
patients with the greatest atrophy in nucleus basalis,
cognitive decline in patients receiving LMTM as
monotherapy was significantly less than those receiv-
ing LMTM in combination with either cholinesterase
inhibitors (p < 0.0001) or memantine (p = 0.0128).
The corresponding effect of nucleus basalis atro-
phy on cortical glucose uptake was seen only in
patients receiving LMTM in combination with a
cholinesterase inhibitor (p = 0.0043), but not in com-
bination with memantine (p = 0.1384) or in patients
receiving LMTM as monotherapy (p = 0.9879).

in determining treatment outcome for combination

the differences favoring LMTM as monotherapy
by including relative basal forebrain atrophy at base-
line as a rate-correction term in the analysis model

for ADAS-cog. Again, the treatment differences
remained significant for both 4 mg twice a day and
100 mg twice a day as monotherapy compared with
add-on therapy (Supplementary Table 7).
Total tau and A�1–42 in CSF increased sig-
nificantly (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0323 respectively)
in subjects taking LMTM as add-on to existing
treatments but not in patients taking LMTM as
monotherapy. Changes in phosphorylated tau were
not significant in either group (Table 7).
Safety results
Safety data according to dose and AD co-
medication use are reported in Table 8. Gastrointesti-
nal and urinary related adverse events were the most
common treatment emergent adverse events, occur-
ring in more patients receiving the 100 mg twice a day
dose than in those receiving the 4 mg twice a day dose
(Table 8). These were also the most common reasons
for discontinuing the 100 mg twice a day dose (40 of
396 patients; 10%) compared with 9 of 399 patients
(2%) taking the 4 mg twice a day dose. The incidence
of targeted gastrointestinal adverse events was almost
twice as high in patients receiving LMTM as add-on
therapy regardless of dose (268 of 627 patients; 43%)
compared with those receiving LMTM alone (45 of
167 patients; 27%).
DISCUSSION
There was no evidence of any difference on
any of the primary or secondary endpoints in the
as-randomized analyses defined in the protocol com-
paring all patients receiving LMTM at a dose of
100 mg twice a day and those receiving 4 mg twice
a day. In the non-randomized cohort comparisons
defined as the primary outcomes in the revised Sta-
tistical Analysis Plan finalized prior to database lock
and unblinding, both primary Comparisons A and
B met the required statistical threshold of p < 0.025
for both co-primary clinical outcomes (ADAS-cog
and ADCS-ADL), as well as for volumetric MRI
and glucose uptake biomarker outcomes. Patients
receiving LMTM as monotherapy at either of the
two doses tested had consistently better outcomes
than patients receiving the same doses as add-on
to cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine, and
patients receiving 100 mg twice as day as monother-
apy had better outcomes than patients receiving 4 mg
twice a day as randomized. There was no difference
between 4 mg and 100 mg twice a day as monother-
apy in the corresponding monotherapy versus add-on
therapy treatment comparisons.
The confirmation of the same pattern of results in
this second independent study argues against either
the present findings or those reported as post hoc
findings from the earlier mild/moderate AD study
[16] being the result of chance in small subgroups,
although the monotherapy subgroups remain small
in the present study (155 or 20% in total in the mITT
analyses). It is also unlikely that the earlier findings
are explicable by inclusion of non-Western geogra-
phies, since the present study was conducted in North
America, Western Europe, and Australia. A clinical
placebo effect in patients coming into a trial setting
after previously not receiving active treatment cannot
explain the same pattern of results seen in both the

Comparisons of change in standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for brain regions shown relative to cerebellar cortex with correction for
atrophy measured by MRI. The decline in glucose uptake was significantly larger for LMTM 100 mg twice a day as add-on therapy than for
LMTM 4 mg twice a day as add-on in frontal cortex (p = 0.0065), parietal cortex (p = 0.0083), and temporal cortex (p = 0.0423).
MRI brain atrophy and glucose uptake data as seen
in the clinical data. A difference in withdrawal rates
between patients taking or not taking standard AD
treatments is also unlikely, since the overall retention
rates over 18 months were similar in monotherapy
(65%) and add-on (69%) treatment groups.
The pattern of atrophy at baseline in patients
receiving LMTM as monotherapy was typical of
mild AD and significantly different from a cohort
of well characterized normal elderly controls [26].
The annualized rate of whole brain atrophy in these
patients over the first 6 months was also similar
to that reported for mild AD and significantly dif-
ferent from normal elderly controls [20]. Likewise
glucose uptake in inferior temporal gyrus was compa-
rable in both monotherapy and add-on patients to that
reported for mild AD [24] and significantly different
from MCI or normal elderly controls [24]. In addi-
tion to meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for mild
AD, the baseline imaging data therefore confirm that
the patients not prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors
or memantine were typical of mild AD.
Patients not receiving standard AD treatments
were somewhat less impaired at study entry on the
ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and MMSE scales, as well
as in ventricular, temporoparietal, and hippocampal
volumes, and temporal lobe glucose uptake. It is
therefore possible that this difference in severity at
baseline might have accounted for significant dif-
ferences in progression. However, baseline severity
was included as an additive term in the primary anal-
ysis models and was therefore corrected for as an
additive effect. We further tested whether baseline
severity or other patient characteristics could explain
differences in rate of progression by undertaking
sensitivity analyses with additional rate-correction

terms in the analysis model. If differences in baseline
characteristics explain the differences in rate of
progression over 18 months, then the significant dif-
ferences in favor of LMTM as monotherapy would
be expected to disappear when rate was corrected for
baseline effects. In a similar analysis for patients with
MMSE 20–26 in the currently available ADNI data
set,thiscorrectionforbaselineseverityeliminatedthe
apparent differences in rate of progression (publica-
tion in preparation). Rate-correction for differences
in clinical severity at baseline, APOE �4 frequency,
vascular pathology load, hippocampal atrophy, tem-
poroparietal atrophy, glucose uptake in the temporal
lobe, and basal forebrain atrophy did not elimi-
nate the significant differences in favor of LMTM
monotherapy for ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, or lateral
ventricular volume. We further examined whether
the differences in favor of LMTM as monother-
apy depend on inclusion of patients receiving a
cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine in combina-
tion as this was found to predict more rapid decline
in an MCI cohort [27]. Removing them had minimal
effect on the estimates or significance of the treat-
ment differences. It therefore appears unlikely that
therelativelyminordifferencesinseverityortheother
characteristics at baseline explain the significant out-
come differences in favor of LMTM monotherapy
over 18 months.
An analysis that is free of potential between-cohort
confounding effects is the within-cohort compari-
son of annualized rate of whole brain atrophy at
study entry and after 9 months of treatment with
LMTM. We found that in patients receiving LMTM
as monotherapy there was a significant delayed
reduction in the annualized rate of whole brain atro-
phy. As noted above, monotherapy patients entered
the study with an initial rate of progression of whole
brain atrophy typical of mild AD and significantly
greater than reported for normal elderly controls
[20]. After receiving LMTM as monotherapy for 9
months, the rate was reduced to that reported for nor-
mal elderly controls and was significantly less than
expected for mild AD [20]. Similarly, the decline in
temporal lobe glucose uptake in patients receiving
LMTM as monotherapy was significantly less than
reported for mild AD [24].
On the ADAS-cog scale, treatment response
to LMTM in combination with a cholinesterase
inhibitor was found to vary inversely with atrophy
in the nucleus basalis and nucleus accumbens cor-
rected for whole brain volume and clinical severity.
A similar effect was also seen for cortical glucose
uptake. The corresponding effect of basal forebrain
atrophy was weaker for the LMTM/memantine com-
bination. Both of these basal forebrain nuclei are
known to be affected by tau aggregation pathology
[28, 29], and may precede cortical pathology [30].
The inverse relationship we report is the opposite
of that reported for the response to donepezil [31],
which varies in proportion with basal forebrain atro-
phy, and donepezil has also been shown recently
to reduce the rate of progression of basal forebrain
atrophy in prodromal AD [32]. The response to
LMTM in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors
appears therefore to differ from the response to
cholinesterase inhibitors alone. In contrast, cognitive

decline in patients receiving LMTM as monother-
apy does not vary according to the severity of basal
forebrain atrophy. These differences in treatment
response cannot therefore be attributed simply to
cohort differences in rates of disease progression
between patients prescribed or not prescribed such
treatments. It also cannot be attributed to relative
lack of pathology, since patients with the greatest
basal forebrain atrophy responded significantly bet-
ter to monotherapy than to combination treatment.
Rather, our findings point to pharmacological dif-
ferences in the effects of LMTM on target neurons
which depend on presence or absence of activating
drugs and on the indirect effects of basal forebrain
pathology.
The role of nucleus basalis in determining treat-
ment response may help to provide some insight
into the possible mechanism underlying the negative
interaction with cholinesterase inhibitors. Ascending
cholinergic projections originating predominantly
from nucleus basalis provide both direct activation
[33] and indirect inhibitory modulation of corti-
cal pyramidal cells [34]. Memantine also increases
release of acetylcholine in nucleus accumbens [35]
 454
G.K. Wilcock et al. / Low Dose LMTM as Alzheimer Monotherapy
which modulates cortical activity indirectly. We have
previously reported increased expression of synap-
tic proteins at Braak stages 3 and 4 in neocortex
AD which would be consistent with disinhibition
[7]. Long-term inhibition of cholinesterase activ-
ity combined with loss of inhibitory modulation
may therefore result in chronic hyperactivation of
pyramidal cells in cortex which are the principal
sites of neurofibrillary degeneration in AD [36]. It
is possible that the relative severity of basal fore-
brain pathology together with chronic cholinesterase
inhibition may determine the degree of hyperacti-
vation of cortical pyramidal cells and that this may
impair the clearance of tau monomers released by
MT [10].
The potential for LMTM to be active at the low
dose of 4 mg twice a day and the lack of dose-
response was unexpected given the results of an
earlier Phase II placebo-controlled study using the
oxidized form of the methylthioninium (MT) moiety
as methylthioninium chloride (MTC) [13]. The dihy-
dromethanesulfonate salt was developed to stabilize
the reduced form of the MT moiety in the solid state
to permit dosing in the reduced form and so overcome
the absorption limitations observed for the oxidized
form using MTC [15, 37]. LMTM is now known to
have a 20-fold better red cell uptake than MTC in
vivo [15] and also better brain uptake [15]. We have
reported that the estimated steady state trough brain
concentration of MT, at the minimum effective dose
of MTC, is 0.1–0.2 �M [15]. A population pharma-
cokinetic analysis using blood samples collected in
the course of the present study, combined with rat
and pig data to estimate brain levels, suggests that
the estimated brain concentration of MT at the 4 mg
twice a day dose is in the range 0.05–0.2 �M (pub-
lication in preparation). The concentration required
for dissolution of paired helical filaments isolated
from AD brain tissue [37] and oligomers in vitro
is approximately 1/10th that of aggregated tau,
implying that a concentration of 0.05 �M may
be adequate in vivo, given the brain concentra-
tions of aggregated tau that have been reported in
AD [38–40].
A concentration of approximately 0.05 �M also
appears to be adequate for a range of other poten-
tially beneficial effects of the MT moiety such as
enhancement of autophagy [41] and enhancement of
mitochondrial function [42–49]. There is no dose-
response for oligomer disaggregation in vitro, and
higher doses of LMTM do not result in greater reduc-
tion in tau pathology in transgenic mouse models
[50]. This suggests that there may be a critical thresh-
old for activity at the tau aggregation inhibitor target,
and the effect of higher doses on pathology may
plateau or may even become negative at brain concen-
trations above 1 �M [50]. Higher doses of MTC are
also less effective inducers of mitochondrial biogene-
sisandofNF-E2-relatedfactor2(Nrf2)whichcontrol
pathways available for clearance of proteotoxic pro-
teins in tau transgenic mice [51], and are less effective
for memory enhancement in wild type rodents [46].
Several results in the present study also suggest that
4 mg twice a day may serve better than 100 mg twice
a day. The clinical differences in favor of 4 mg twice
a day were seen at both CDR 0.5 and 1.0, but only at
CDR 0.5 at the higher dose, and the glucose uptake
difference in temporal cortex occurred earlier at the
lower dose.
The lower dose of 4 mg twice a day had a better
overall clinical profile than 100 mg twice a day. The
withdrawal rate over 18 months for the 4 mg twice
a day dose was less (25%, 94/296) than at 100 mg
twice a day (46%, 182/399), and the adverse event
profile was more benign with respect to the diar-
rhea, dysuria, and decreased hemoglobin. There is
no increased risk of cerebral microhemorrhages or
edema with LMTM even at the higher dose, since
the ARIA rates observed in both Phase III studies
were similar to those previously reported for placebo
controls [21, 22].
In addition to inhibition of tau aggregation [37],
enhancement of autophagy [41], and induction of
proteotoxic clearance pathways at low concentration
[51], the MT moiety has several pharmacological
actions which are consistent with potentially neu-
roprotective, antioxidant and symptomatic effects
[46]. Enhancement of mitochondrial metabolism
[42–49] has been proposed as a mechanism under-
lying acute neurocognitive benefits in wild-type
rodents [46] and in healthy young human volun-
teers [46, 52, 53]. We show that the difference
in glucose uptake between LMTM monotherapy
and add-on therapy is 2–3-fold greater in neocorti-
cal regions affected by neurofibrillary degeneration
[6–8] than in cerebellum which is not affected
[54]. We also show that the cortical benefits in
favor of LMTM monotherapy can be seen when
SUVR is normalized with respect to cerebellum,
thereby correcting for general effects on mitochon-
drial metabolism. This, together with the contrasting
effects of LMTM on total tau (although not phospho-
tau) in CSF in monotherapy and add-on patients,
supports the idea that the benefits in favor of LMTM
 G.K. Wilcock et al. / Low Dose LMTM as Alzheimer Monotherapy
455
as monotherapy are linked to tau pathology and to
tau metabolism.
The differences in favor of LMTM as monotherapy
are based on non-randomized cohort comparisons,
albeit defined a priori as statistically primary out-
comes for the modified analyses we report here.
Using modern statistical techniques, estimates of
treatment effects from cohort comparisons are com-
parable with randomized controlled studies in most
disease areas [55]. The differences between LMTM
as monotherapy and add-on therapy are likewise
comparable with the effect sizes found in the ear-
lier placebo controlled monotherapy study of MTC
at a comparable brain concentration of MT [13].
Although we have excluded differences in sever-
ity, extent of brain atrophy, severity of glucose
uptake deficit, AD diagnosis, and concomitant vascu-
lar pathology at baseline as explaining the treatment
differences in favor of LMTM monotherapy, non-
obvious or unmeasured confounding factors cannot
be excluded without a further randomized clini-
cal trial comparing LMTM monotherapy with true
placebo. However, the same pattern of results has
been seen now in two separate Phase III studies,
implying that the effects are consistent across stud-
ies. The differences favoring monotherapy are also
internally consistent across a range of clinical out-
comes, and the clinical outcomes are consistent with
the neuroimaging outcomes in both studies. Since
measurablecohortdifferencesindiagnosisorseverity
do not appear to explain the treatment differences we
report, we believe that the within- and between-study
consistency of the results cannot be dismissed lightly,
particularly given the urgent need for new treatments
in AD [56]. If the results are confirmed in a fur-
ther suitably randomized clinical trial, they point to
clinical and biological effects of LMTM as monother-
apy at the safe and well-tolerated dose of 4 mg
twice a day which could provide a clinically mean-
ingful addition to the available treatment options
for AD.
