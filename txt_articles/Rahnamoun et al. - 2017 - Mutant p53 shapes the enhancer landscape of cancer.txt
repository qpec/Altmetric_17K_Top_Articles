Inflammation influences cancer development, progression, and the efficacy of cancer treat-
ments, yet the mechanisms by which immune signaling drives alterations in the cancer cell
transcriptome remain unclear. Using ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and GRO-seq, here we demonstrate
a global overlap in the binding of tumor-promoting p53 mutants and the master proin-
flammatory regulator NFκB that drives alterations in enhancer and gene activation in
response to chronic TNF-α signaling. We show that p53 mutants interact directly with NFκB
and that both factors impact the other’s binding at diverse sets of active enhancers. In turn,
the simultaneous and cooperative binding of these factors is required to regulate RNAPII
recruitment, the synthesis of enhancer RNAs, and the activation of tumor-promoting genes.
Collectively, these findings establish a mechanism by which chronic TNF-α signaling
orchestrates a functional interplay between mutant p53 and NFκB that underlies altered
patterns of cancer-promoting gene expression.

espite intensive investigation of the crosstalk between
tumor and immune cells of the adjacent microenviron-
ment, the mechanisms by which immune signaling drives
alterations in the cancer cell transcriptome remain poorly
understood. Diffusible immune cell mediators that include
chemokines
and
cytokines
function
in
tumor-promoting
inflammation by converging on the activation of transcription
factors such as NFκB, which drives altered gene expression
programs in cancer cells1, 2. Also, the cancer-promoting effects of
inflammation vary based on regulatory factors that are linked to
genetic aberrations in cancer cells3. Of special interest here are
p53 gene mutations, which are the most frequent alterations in
human cancer that give rise to mutant proteins that exhibit a loss
of their tumor suppressor activities or a gain in their oncogenic
(GOF) functions that promote tumorigenesis4.
In recent support of the p53 GOF paradigm is the finding that
mutant p53 (mutp53) augments NFκB activation and results in
chronic but not acute inflammation-induced tumor initiation in a
mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease5. Another seminal
study revealed that mutp53 prolongs NFκB activation by
inhibiting apoptosis-stimulated kinase (ASK1)-JNK pathways in
response to chronic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
signaling6. These studies underscore the significance of investi-
gating the mechanisms underlying the interactions between
mutp53 and NFκB to advance our understanding of the protu-
morigenic roles for immune signaling.
Growing evidence supports mutp53 GOF activities that are
connected to gene regulation7, 8. However, the mechanisms
controlling mutp53 DNA binding and transcriptional functions
are not well understood. Following our global profiling analyses
of mutp53 and NFκB in response to chronic TNF-α signaling, we
focus on the possibility of a functional cooperativity between
these factors at distinct subsets of enhancers. Enhancers are DNA
elements that are activated by transcriptional regulators to
orchestrate cell and signal-specific gene expression programs9–15.
Enhancer activity is often correlated with an enrichment of the
histone mark, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)16–18
and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment that drives the
production of bidirectional transcripts known as enhancer RNAs
(eRNAs)19–22. Despite remarkable progress in understanding the
pathways that control enhancer priming and activation, relatively
little is understood about the mechanisms that promote enhancer
activation for the regulation of oncogenic gene expression
programs.
In this study, we uncover enhancers that become active in
response to chronic TNF-α signaling as revealed by the global
accumulation of the chromatin modifications, histone 3 lysine 4
monomethylation (H3K4me1) and H3K27ac that are hallmarks
of active enhancers. In addition, we find that these enhancers
integrate mutual mutp53 and NFκB regulation of RNAPII
recruitment, the synthesis of eRNAs, and the activation of tumor-
promoting genes. Collectively, our findings uncover an enhancer
transcription “signature” that is linked to alterations in tumor-
promoting gene expression and enhanced cancer cell growth.
Results
Alterations in gene expression by TNF signaling and mutp53.
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the roles of mutp53 in
promoting chronic inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, we
performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in human SW480
colon cancer cells expressing doxycycline-inducible short hairpin
RNAs (shRNAs) against mutp53 before and following TNF-α
treatment for 16 h. Relative to a non-targeting shRNA against
LacZ (control), p53 shRNA markedly reduced mutp53 R273H
mRNA and protein levels before and after TNF-α treatment
(+/−TNF-α) (Fig. 1a). By comparing the transcriptomes of
control and mutp53-depleted cells (+/−TNF-α), we found that
mutp53 alters (≥2-fold, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) a
comparable number of genes before (n = 2360, 51%) and
following (n = 2264, 49%) TNF-α treatment (Fig. 1b), which is
consistent with a broad role for mutp53 in regulating gene
expression. Notably, the colon cancer cell transcriptome regulated
by mutp53 is also extensively altered by chronic immune
signaling as revealed by the identification of a subset of gained
mutp53-regulated genes (n = 772) that are upregulated or
downregulated in response to TNF-α (Fig. 1b). Analysis of this
gained subset of TNF-α-responsive genes revealed 303 (39%)
mutp53-repressed genes that include key regulators of organ
morphogenesis, development, and hypoxia as revealed by gene
ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Fig. 1c). Conversely, GO
categories corresponding to the 469 (61%) mutp53-activated
genes are largely related to immunogenic and tumor-promoting
processes that include cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction,
hallmark TNF signaling via NFκB, and regulation of locomotion
(Fig. 1c). Next, we investigated a role for mutp53 in regulating
TNF-α-inducible gene expression. As revealed in Fig. 1d
and Supplementary Data 1, we identified 482 RefSeq genes that
are induced (≥2-fold, FDR < 0.05) by TNF-α in the control
knockdown cells. Among the TNF-α-induced genes, we identified
a number of genes (n = 187, 39%) that are induced in a mutp53-
dependent manner (≥2-fold) as revealed by the significant
decrease in inducible gene expression following mutp53 depletion
(Fig. 1d). Conversely, a much smaller subset (n = 9, 2%) of
TNF-α-inducible genes are repressed by mutp53 (Fig. 1d).
Overall, our mRNA-seq data indicate the role of mutp53 in
potent gene activation in response to chronic TNF signaling.
Consistent with our RNA-seq data, quantitative polymerase
chain reaction with reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) revealed
that mutp53 is required for the induction of a subset of TNF-α-
induced
genes.
Specifically,
mutp53
knockdown
revealed
significant downregulation of the TNF-α-induced expression of
MMP9, CCL2, UBD, and LTB (Fig. 1e), which are among the
top ten most highly induced mutp53-dependent genes identified
in our mRNA-seq data (Supplementary Data 1; Fig. 1d). In
comparison, mutp53 had little to no effect on the expression
of wild-type p53 target genes (Fig. 1e). The TNF-α-inducible
gene-selective effects of mutp53 were also identified when using
an siRNA oligonucleotide that is directed against a different
region of p53 mRNA in SW480 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and
in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells that express mutp53 R280K
(Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Cell invasion assays were performed to investigate whether
TNF-α and mutp53-dependent alterations in the transcriptome
are associated with changes in cancer cell growth. As revealed in
Fig. 1f, chronic TNF-α results in an approximately sevenfold
increase in the number of control cells that pass through the
Matrigel. Under uninduced conditions, mutp53 depletion had
little to no effect on the number of cells that invade. Notably,
however, mutp53 depletion significantly reduced the number of
cells that invade following TNF-α signaling for 16 h to a level that
is comparable to the number of control cells that invade prior to
TNF-α signaling (Fig. 1f). These findings reveal that mutp53
modulates chronic TNF-α-dependent alterations in the cancer
cell transcriptome that enhance cancer cell invasion.
TNF signaling uncovers enhancers occupied by mutp53 and
NFκB. To further explore the interplay between mutp53 and
chronic TNF-α signaling at the genomic level, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing
(ChIP-seq) for mutp53 R273H and NFκB/p65 in SW480 cells

 (+/−TNF-α). Following TNF-α signaling, stringent p65 peaks
(n = 24,965; FDR < 0.001) were identified that showed a striking
colocalization with unchanged or “maintained” mutp53 peaks
(n = 18,295; FDR < 0.001) and TNF-α-dependent enriched or
“gained” mutp53 peaks (n = 17,772; FDR < 0.001) (Fig. 2a).
Specifically, 43% of the gained mutp53-binding sites show overlap
with p65, and conversely 31% of the p65-occupied regions
overlap with the gained mutp53 peaks in response to TNF-α
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). In addition, de novo motif analysis
identified that NFκB consensus motifs are among the most highly
enriched to overlap with the gained mutp53 and NFκB peaks
(Fig. 2b). We also identified a comparable degree of overlap
between p65 and maintained mutp53-binding sites following
TNF-α exposure with about half (47%) of the maintained mutp53
regions showing overlap with p65 and 34% of the p65-enriched
regions revealing overlap with maintained mutp53-binding sites
(Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 2a). Motif analysis of the maintained
peaks revealed an enrichment of the consensus sequences
recognized by transcription factors that include Fra-1/AP-1,
TEAD4, and ERG/ETS but not NFκB (Fig. 2b). Also as expected,
wild-type p53 motifs do not overlap with the gained or main-
tained mutp53 peaks, which is consistent with the reduced affinity
of contact mutp53 for wild-type p53 recognition elements23.
Altogether, these findings reveal that chronic TNF-α promotes an
overlap in NFκB and mutp53 binding across the genome.
Genome-wide analyses have revealed that the majority of
NFκB binding takes place at genomic regions with enhancer-like
chromatin features9, 24. To explore whether the overlapping
mutp53
and
NFκB-binding
sites
occur
at
enhancers,
we
compared our mutp53 and NFκB ChIP-seq data to global
profiling analysis of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 that demarcate
enhancers. As demonstrated at the gained (MMP9 and CCL2)
and maintained (CYP24A1 and CPA4) mutp53-bound enhancers,
we identified a strong correlation between mutp53 and NFκB
enrichment, and H3K4me1 and H3K27ac accumulation that
occurs across the genome in response to chronic TNF-α signaling
(Fig. 2c).
To determine the temporal relationship of mutp53 and NFκB
binding at the identified enhancers, we next performed time
course ChIP experiments followed by qPCR. Immunoprecipitated
DNA was analyzed with primer sets specific to regions with active
enhancer chromatin signatures and centered at NFκB/p65 and
mutp53 peaks (Fig. 2d, amplicons A and B at MMP9 and A at
CCL2, CYP24A1, and CPA4) and non-specific control regions
(Fig. 2d, amplicon C at MMP9 and B at CCL2, CYP24A1, and
CPA4). Consistent with our ChIP-seq data, ChIP-qPCR revealed
low levels of pre-associated mutp53 and negligible NFκB binding
before TNF-α signaling and substantial TNF-α-induced increases
in the binding of both factors at the gained enhancers, but not at
the control regions of the MMP9 and CCL2 genes (Fig. 2d). At the
maintained
enhancers,
CYP24A1
and
CPA4,
we
observed
comparable levels of mutp53 binding +/−TNF-α, and negligible
levels of uninduced NFκB binding that are increased in response
to TNF-α (Fig. 2d). Consistent with our ChIP-seq findings,
H3K4me1 and H3K27ac levels were observed at the mutp53 and
NFκB co-bound enhancers with peak levels observed at 8 and
16 h TNF-α (Fig. 2d). In addition, the overlap of mutp53, NFκB,
and H3K27ac that occurs in response to chronic TNF-α was
identified at the MMP9 and CPA4 enhancer regions, but not the
wild-type p53 p21 enhancer in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2b). Similarly, wild-type p53 was not found to overlap
with NFκB or H3K27ac at the MMP9 or CPA4 enhancers in
HCT116 cells, despite the enrichment of wild-type p53 at the p21
enhancer (Supplementary Fig. 2c). These ChIP analyses support
differential enhancer targeting of mutant versus wild-type p53 in
cancer cells in response to chronic immune signaling.
To investigate simultaneous binding of mutp53 and NFκB
at active enhancers, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation
(re-ChIP) for mutp53 followed by NFκB was performed in
SW480 cells treated with TNF-α for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 2e,
qPCR analysis of the re-ChIP DNA revealed NFκB and mutp53
co-occupancy at the MMP9, CCL2, CYP24A1, and CPA4
enhancers. In comparison, the control (IgG) IP revealed little to
no enrichment of DNA in the re-ChIP experiments. The strong
parallel between our global and enhancer-specific analyses
demonstrate distinct classes of mutp53 and NFκB co-bound
enhancers.
Mutp53 and NFκB form functional interactions. Given the
striking overlap of the mutp53 and NFκB-binding profiles, we
next assessed whether these factors form functional interactions.
Using purified mutp53 and p65 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3a),
we identified that p65 interacts directly and equivalently with the
p53 mutants, R273H, R248W, R248Q, and G245S (Fig. 3a). p65
also interacts directly with wild-type p53 (Fig. 3a), despite that
these factors were not found to overlap at mutp53-bound
enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 2c). As shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3b, we also identified an association between mutp53
and NFκB in SW480 cells. Specifically, an NFκB/p65 antibody
comparably
co-immunoprecipitated
mutp53
from
nuclear
extracts prepared before and following TNF-α treatment. These
results establish mutp53–NFκB interactions that are consistent
with the TNF-α-induced global overlap (Fig. 2a, c; Supplementary
Fig. 2a) and the simultaneous binding of mutp53 and NFκB at
active enhancers (Figs. 2d, e).
We next analyzed whether NFκB regulates mutp53 enhancer
binding. ChIP-qPCR was performed in SW480 cells transfected
with control or NFκB/p65 siRNA, which reduced NFκB mRNA
and protein levels without affecting mutp53 levels (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3c). Under TNF-α-induced conditions, p65 knockdown
resulted in a comparable loss of p65 binding at the MMP9 (80%,
90% at amplicons A and B, respectively) and CCL2 (70%)
enhancers (Fig. 3b). Notably, decreased p65 binding resulted in
a substantial and comparable reduction of mutp53 binding at
the MMP9 (70%, 75% at amplicons A and B, respectively) and
CCL2 (77%) enhancers (Fig. 3b). In comparison, little to no effect
of p65 knockdown on mutp53 binding was identified at
the maintained mutp53 enhancers, CYP24A1 and CPA4, despite
the significant decrease (73% and 83%, respectively) in the
TNF-α-induced levels of NFκB binding at both enhancers
(Fig. 3b). This finding is consistent with our motif analysis
(Fig. 2b), which revealed that NFκB response elements are
not enriched, whereas response elements recognized by tran-
scription factors including ETS2 overlap with the maintained
enhancers. Also consistent with the motif analysis (Fig. 2b), we
identified a comparable enrichment of ETS2 that overlaps with
mutp53 binding at the maintained enhancers, CYP24A1 and
CPA4 before and after TNF-α signaling (Supplementary Fig. 3d),
which is consistent with published results showing that ETS2
facilitates mutp53 binding25, 26. We further investigated the role
of NFκB in regulating mutp53 binding at the gained enhancers,
MMP9 and CCL2 by using the proteasome inhibitor MG132,
which prevents degradation of IκB, an endogenous NFκB
inhibitor27, while not affecting the protein levels of p65 or
mutp53 (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Consistent with the NFκB
knockdown experiments (Fig. 3b), MG132 significantly reduced
p65 binding at the MMP9 (96%) and CCL2 (89%) enhancers
(Supplementary Fig. 3f), which resulted in substantial losses of
TNF-induced mutp53 binding at the MMP9 (86%, 94% at
amplicons A and B, respectively) and CCL2 (88%) enhancers
(Supplementary Fig. 3f). Altogether, these results demonstrate

 that NFκB is required for mutp53 binding at a subset of
enhancers in response to TNF-α signaling.
We next investigated a role for mutp53 in the regulation of
NFκB enhancer binding by performing ChIP-qPCR in SW480
cells following mutp53 shRNA and siRNA-mediated knockdown.
As shown in Fig. 1a, mutp53 knockdown significantly decreased
mutp53 mRNA and protein levels, without affecting p65 levels.
Under uninduced conditions, mutp53 binding at the maintained,
CYP24A1 (74%) and CPA4 (66%) enhancers were significantly
decreased following mutp53 knockdown, which is consistent with
the identification of pre-associated mutp53 binding at this subset
of
enhancers

 knockdown resulted in a comparable and substantial decrease in
mutp53 binding at all four enhancers, MMP9 (80%, 82% at
amplicons A and B, respectively), CCL2 (91%), CYP24A1 (78%),
and CPA4 (75%) (Fig. 3c), which resulted in a significant decrease
in p65 binding at the MMP9 (50%, 67% at amplicons A and B,
respectively), CCL2 (57%), CYP24A1 (63%), and CPA4 (68%)
enhancers (Fig. 3c). The effect of mutp53 in regulating p65
binding at the maintained enhancers that are devoid of NFκB
consensus motifs (Fig. 2b) is consistent with a mutp53 GOF
activity that involves altering NFκB binding to extend the cancer
cell transcriptome. The requirement for mutp53 in regulating
NFκB recruitment was confirmed using siRNA-mediated knock-
down of mutp53 (Supplementary Fig. 3g). The ability of mutp53
and NFκB to impact each other’s binding is in agreement with the
identification of mutp53–NFκB interactions and the interplay of
these factors at specific subsets of enhancers in response to
chronic TNF-α signaling.
Potent eRNA synthesis at mutp53 and NFκB co-bound
enhancers. Given that active enhancers support eRNA synth-
esis, we performed global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to assay
nascent transcription in SW480 cells (+/−TNF-α). As demon-
strated at the MMP9 and CPA4 enhancers, our GRO-seq data
reveals bidirectional transcription at mutp53 and NFκB co-bound
enhancers (Fig. 4a). Specifically, the gained MMP9 enhancer
revealed low levels of uninduced and markedly induced eRNA
levels following TNF-α treatment, which parallels with the
induced levels of mutp53 binding (Fig. 4a). In comparison, the
maintained CPA4 enhancer supports comparable levels of eRNA
synthesis that parallels with mutp53 binding before and following
TNF-α (Fig. 4a). This correlation between eRNA synthesis and
mutp53 binding was further demonstrated at the CCL2 and
CYP24A1 enhancers, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4a). To
further investigate differential eRNA induction from mutp53
gained and maintained enhancers, we examined the GRO-seq
signals from all enhancers parsed by mutp53, NFκB, and
H3K27ac enrichment. The vast majority of the mutp53 gained
(n = 1506, 58%) and maintained (n = 1864, 68%) enhancers
reveal robust TNF-α-inducible eRNA synthesis (Fig. 4b). In
addition, the higher levels of uninduced eRNA synthesis from the
maintained enhancers is consistent with the lower fold eRNA
induction that is identified from the maintained versus gained
enhancers (Fig. 4b). These results, taken together with the iden-
tification of H3K27ac accumulation are consistent with an active
state of the mutp53 and NFκB co-bound enhancers in response to
chronic TNF signaling. These findings also reveal a strong
correlation between mutp53 enhancer localization and enhancer-
directed transcription across the genome.
We next wanted to determine whether enhancer transcription
at mutp53 and NFκB co-bound enhancers parallels with the
transcription of nearby genes on a global scale. Thus, we
compared our GRO-seq data at intergenic sites bound by NFκB
alone or co-bound by mutp53 and NFκB with the positive strand
GRO-seq signals identified at the nearest gene promoters
following TNF-α treatment. Notably, the peak GRO-seq signals
were significantly higher at the mutp53 and NFκB co-bound
enhancers as compared to the NFκB-bound enhancers (Fig. 4c,
left). Also, there exists a strong parallel between intergenic
GRO-seq signals at the two subsets of enhancers and the
GRO-seq signals at the nearby promoters (Fig. 4c, right). These
results indicate that enhancer transcription positively correlates
with mutp53 binding and nearby gene activation.
To further investigate the kinetics of enhancer transcription
from mutp53 and NFκB co-bound enhancers, eRNA levels were
examined in SW480 cells treated with TNF-α for 0, 8, and 16 h.
We identified that eRNA induction reached near maximal levels
from the maintained (CYP24A1 and CPA4) and gained (MMP9
and CCL2) enhancers by 8 h of TNF-α treatment (Fig. 4d;
Supplementary Fig. 4b). Consistent with our GRO-seq data
(Fig. 4a–c), the overall fold induction of eRNA levels are (three-
to fourfold) higher at the gained versus maintained mutp53-
bound enhancers, which is due to the measurable levels of eRNA
synthesis at the maintained but not gained enhancers in
uninduced cells (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. 4b). The strong
correlation between enhancer transcription and nearby-gene
activation was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses of the
mRNA expression levels of the MMP9, CCL2, CYP24A1, and
CPA4 genes (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. 4b). In comparison,
negligible
levels
of
eRNA
synthesis
were
identified
from
the MMP9, CCL2, CYP24A1, and CPA4 enhancers in wild-type
p53-expressing HCT116 cells, which is consistent with the
negligible TNF-α-induced mRNA expression levels of all four
genes (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 4c). A 250-fold lower level of
TNF-α-induced MMP9 expression was detected in HCT116 as
compared
to
SW480 cells
through
a
mechanism
that
is
independent of mutp53 (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 4c). These
enhancer-specific findings and our genome-wide data provide
support for a functional interplay between mutp53 enhancer-
binding sites, enhancer transcription, and target gene expression.
Mutp53 and NFκB regulate RNAPII binding and eRNA pro-
duction. We next investigated a direct role for mutp53 in the
regulation of eRNA synthesis. First, using ChIP-seq we compared
the global-binding profiles of RNAPII and mutp53, which
revealed a significant colocalization of RNAPII and mutp53 in
response to TNF-α signaling (Fig. 5a), and a symmetrical and
bidirectional profile for global RNAPII binding (Fig. 5a) that is
consistent with bidirectional transcription from the mutp53-
bound enhancers (Figs 4a–c; Supplementary Fig. 4a). Next, we
examined a role for mutp53 in the regulation of RNAPII binding
at mutp53-bound enhancers by performing RNAPII ChIP
following the inducible expression of control or mutp53 shRNA.
Under uninduced conditions, negligible levels of mutp53 and
RNAPII binding were identified at the gained (MMP9 and CCL2)
enhancers (Fig. 5b). In comparison, and consistent with pre-
associated levels of mutp53 binding at the maintained enhancers,
CYP24A1, and CPA4, we identified that pre-associated RNAPII
levels are substantially (52% and 65%, respectively) decreased
following mutp53 knockdown (Fig. 5b). Under TNF-α-induced
conditions, the decrease in mutp53 binding at the enhancer
regions of MMP9 (75%, 84% at amplicons A and B, respectively),
CCL2 (87%), CYP24A1 (74%), and CPA4 (71%) results in a
significant loss (64%, 85%, 90%, 71%, and 75%) in RNAPII
binding at all four enhancers, respectively (Fig. 5b).
Consistent with the identified role of mutp53 in regulating
RNAPII
binding
at
the
maintained
CYP24A1
and
CPA4
enhancers prior to TNF-α signaling, qRT-PCR analyses revealed
a comparable (twofold) reduction in the uninduced eRNA and
mRNA expression levels of CYP24A1 following mutp53 knock-
down (Fig. 5c). We were unable to detect a change in CPA4
mRNA levels, which likely relates to its lower uninduced
expression levels (Fig. 5c). In addition, a significant decrease in
the TNF-α-induced eRNA levels from the MMP9 (fourfold,
fivefold at the −3.7 kb and −0.7 kb regions, respectively), CCL2
(sixfold), CYP24A1 (fivefold), and CPA4 (fourfold) enhancers and
a comparable decrease in the TNF-α-induced mRNA levels was
identified for MMP9, CCL2, CYP24A1, and CPA4 (eightfold,
fivefold, threefold, and fourfold, respectively) following mutp53
knockdown (Fig. 5c). siRNA-mediated knockdown of mutp53
revealed an identical requirement for mutp53 in the regulation of

 depletion reduced the levels of eRNA and mRNA MMP9
induction by at least twofold and fivefold, respectively (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5d). These findings are consistent with p65
regulation of mutp53 binding (Fig. 3b) and mutp53 regulation
of RNAPII binding at these enhancers (Fig. 5b; Supplementary
Fig. 5a). p65 also supports RNAPII binding at the maintained
CYP24A1 enhancer as revealed by an approximately 50% decrease
in RNAPII levels following p65 knockdown (Supplementary
Fig. 5c). However, despite the decrease in RNAPII binding, we
identified little change in the TNF-α-induced eRNA levels from
this enhancer (Supplementary Fig. 5d), which is likely due to the
residual levels of RNAPII at this enhancer following p65
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 5c, amplicon A versus B). In
addition, TNF-α-induced CYP24A1 mRNA levels were signifi-
cantly (twofold) decreased following p65 knockdown, despite the
negligible change in CYP24A1 eRNA levels (Supplementary

 Fig. 5d), which suggests that p65 also regulates this target gene
through mechanisms that are independent of p65 enhancer
functions. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a direct
requirement for the functional interplay between mutp53 and
NFκB in the activation of enhancer and tumor-promoting genes.
eRNA expression in colon carcinomas expressing mutp53. To
explore the clinical significance of mutp53-dependent alterations
in the cancer cell transcriptome, qRT-PCR analyses were
performed to analyze MMP9 eRNA and mRNA expression
levels in human colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and matched
non-neoplastic tissues isolated from five patients. First, DNA
sequencing (Fig. 6a) and immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. 6a)
analyses confirmed mutp53 versus wild-type p53 expression in
CRCs and non-neoplastic tissues, respectively. Notably, we
identified a potent activation of MMP9 eRNA and mRNA
expression levels in CRCs that express mutp53, as compared
with the negligible levels that are present in the wild-type
p53-expressing tissues (Fig. 6a). Additional support for these
findings is the identification of significant CCL2 eRNA and
mRNA expression levels in the CRCs and not the non-neoplastic
tissues (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Thus, these results further
underscore the importance of mutant versus wild-type p53 in
regulating the observed changes in the cancer cell transcriptome.
Discussion
Immune cells of the tumor microenvironment influence the
course of tumor progression, yet the molecular mechanisms by
which immune signaling drives alterations in tumor-specific gene
expression remains unclear. Our study highlights an emerging
link between chronic proinflammatory signaling pathways and
the gene expression landscape controlled by GOF mutations of
the tumor suppressor p53. Specifically, our findings reveal that
chronic TNF-α signaling prompts a global relationship between
mutp53 and NFκB that supports potent enhancer and tumor-
promoting gene activation and has significant implications for
cancer aggressiveness. Support for a dynamic relationship
between mutp53 and NFκB is demonstrated by the identification
of a significant gain in the global binding of mutp53 that overlaps
with NFκB at active enhancers, kinetic ChIP analyses that show a
direct parallel in the temporal-binding profiles of mutp53 and
NFκB, and re-ChIP analyses that revealed simultaneous binding
of these factors at active enhancers.
Roles for NFκB and mutp53 in the regulation of each other’s
binding at active enhancers in response to chronic TNF signaling
is supported by our demonstration of (1) direct physical inter-
actions between purified NFκB and mutp53, (2) the formation of
mutp53 and NFκB associations in colon cancer cells, and (3) the
decreased binding of NFκB and mutp53 at active enhancers that
occurs following the depletion or inactivation of the other factor.
Specifically, at the mutp53-gained enhancers, we identified that
mutp53 is bound through NFκB interactions as demonstrated by
the near complete loss of mutp53 binding that occurs in response
to NFκB knockdown and the inhibition of NFκB activation. As
the vast majority of p53 mutations localize to the DNA-binding
domain and alter the recognition of wild-type p53 sequence-
specific DNA elements28, these findings support an additional
mechanism for mutp53 DNA-binding that is facilitated by NFκB.
We also identified that mutp53 knockdown leads to a modest, yet
significant decrease in NFκB binding at this identical subset
of enhancers. These modest effects of mutp53 depletion on
NFκB binding are consistent with additional NFκB-enhancer
interactions, particularly those that are likely facilitated by NFκB
recognition of its consensus motifs that are present at these
enhancers. The cooperativity in mutp53 and NFκB-enhancer
binding is consistent with the previously described assisted
loading mechanism in which factors localized at the same
enhancer region facilitate each other’s binding29. An unexpected
finding is the identification that mutp53 facilitates NFκB binding
at the mutp53-maintained enhancers that are devoid of NFκB
recognition sequences and that show significant and comparable
levels of mutp53 and ETS2, which was previously shown to
recruit mutp5325, 26. This finding significantly advances our
understanding of the GOF properties of mutp53 by revealing the
ability of mutp53 to facilitate NFκB accessing this subset of
enhancers, which provides new opportunities for expanding the
proinflammatory roles of NFκB in cancer cells. This observation
suggests the importance of considering additional roles of mutp53
in regulating NFκB involvement in chronic inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases, wherein proinflammatory cytokines drive
NFκB activation. Although we are unable to rule out additional
cofactors and mechanisms that may contribute to the recruitment
and function of mutp53 and NFκB, our results provide strong
evidence for the mutual interdependence of mutp53 and NFκB at
these classes of enhancers in response to chronic TNF-α
signaling.
Growing evidence supports mechanisms underlying mutp53
GOF activities that are connected to the gene regulatory roles of
mutp5330. Yet, the full spectrum of mechanisms remains to be
elucidated, and little is known about the roles of mutp53 in
the regulation of enhancers. Through RNAPII ChIP-seq and
GRO-seq31 analyses, we demonstrate that enhancer-specific
mutp53 binding events are linked to RNAPII recruitment and
the extensive induction of eRNA synthesis in response to chronic
TNF signaling. Also, we provide a global perspective of the
relationship that exists between enhancer-directed transcription
and tumor-promoting gene activation mediated by the functional
interplay between mutp53 and NFκB. Interestingly, the enhancers
co-bound by mutp53 and NFκB support significantly higher
levels of TNF-induced eRNA synthesis that positively correlates
with higher levels of transcription from the nearby gene pro-
moters as compared with the enhancers that are bound only by
NFκB. We also demonstrate that mutp53 and NFκB exhibit a
direct role in the regulation of RNAPII recruitment and as a
result, modulate the TNF-α-inducible activation of enhancers and
tumor-promoting genes. Altogether, inducible eRNA synthesis
and H3K27ac accumulation are strong indicators that the
induced recruitment of mutp53 and NFκB coincides with
enhancer activation. This finding is consistent with previously
described mechanisms in which signal-dependent transcription
factors bind to pre-selected enhancers that consist of H3K4me1
and little to no enrichment of H3K27ac, and transition to an
active state that includes enrichment of both H3K4me1 and
H3K27ac18. Further investigation is needed to determine the
additional factors that together with mutp53 and NFκB regulate
the step-wise events that lead to enhancer activation.
Our studies also provide support for mutant versus wild-type
p53 in the regulation of these enhancer-directed alterations in the
cancer cell transcriptome. Although we identified comparable
NFκB interactions with p53 mutants and wild-type p53, wild-type
p53 was not found to overlap with NFκB at the mutp53
maintained or gained enhancers before or after TNF signaling. In
addition, wild-type p53 was not found to have a role in the
induction of eRNA or mRNA synthesis in response to TNF sig-
naling. Consistent with these cell-based experiments, additional
transcriptional analyses revealed increased expression of eRNA
and mRNA levels of the gained target gene loci, MMP9 and CCL2
in solid colon tumors that express mutp53 relative to the matched
normal tissues that express wild-type p53. However, we were
unable to detect an increase in the eRNA and mRNA levels of the
maintained genes, CYP24A1 and CPA4, which we believe may

 relate to the lower overall eRNA and mRNA expression levels of
the maintained relative to the gained gene loci. Thus, our data
supporting a mutp53-specific role in enhancer regulation that is
mediated by NFκB interactions is consistent with previous stu-
dies4 that have shown that wild-type p53 will be recruited to its
typical sites within the genome consisting of wild-type p53 DNA-
binding motifs (as was shown in this study by revealing wild-type
p53 recruitment to its target gene, p21), whereas the vast majority
of p53 mutants will be mislocalized to other regions in the gen-
ome based on interactions with other transcriptional regulators
(i.e., NFκB in this study). Overall, the effects on enhancer and
gene activation by mutp53 and NFκB enhancer landscapes in
response to chronic TNF-α signaling support our proposed model
(Fig. 6b), which is consistent with an emerging regulatory net-
work of mutp53 in orchestrating chronic inflammation-induced
colon cancer.
Methods
Cell culture and treatments. Human SW480 and HCT116 cells were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco’s mod-
ified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Gibco). MDA-MB-231 cells were also purchased from ATCC and were
grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) medium supplemented with 10% FBS. SW480 cells
that stably and inducibly express short hairpins against LacZ or p53 were kindly
provided by Xinbin Chen (UC Davis) and were grown in standard DMEM medium
containing 1× penicillin and streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products), 1.5 μg ml−1
puromycin (Sigma), and were induced with 1 μg ml−1 doxycycline (Sigma). MG132
treatment experiments were performed by treating SW480 cells with 5 μM MG132
(Sigma) or vehicle (DMSO, Fisher Scientific) and with 12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α (R&D
Systems) for 0 or 16 h before harvesting for gene expression or ChIP analyses. All
cell lines mentioned have tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.
RNA interference experiments. SW480 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
with 100 nM non-targeting siRNA control, human RelA siRNA SMART pool, or
p53 siRNA duplexes (listed in Supplementary Table 1) (all siRNAs are from
Thermo Scientific). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with
12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α for 0 or 16 h before harvesting for gene expression or ChIP
analyses.
Immunoblotting. Protein samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by
SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore) that were
probed with the indicated antibodies. Reactive bands were detected by ECL
(Thermo Scientific Pierce), and exposed to Blue Devil Lite ECL films (Genesee
Scientific). Full scans of all western blots are provided in Supplementary Fig. 7.
Antibodies. Antibodies used for ChIP assays were obtained commercially as
followed: anti-H3 (ab1791, 1 μg), anti-H3K4me1 (ab8895, 1 μg), and anti-
H3K427ac (ab4729, 1 μg) from Abcam; anti-RNA Pol II (N20, sc899, 2 μg),
anti-p53 (FL393, sc6243, 2 μg), anti-ETS2 (sc351, 2 μg), anti-p65 (sc372x, 2 μg),
and anti-IgG (sc2027, 2 μg) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies used for
immunoblotting were obtained as followed: anti-p53 (DO1, sc126, 1:2000 dilution)
and anti-β-Actin (sc47778, 1:2000 dilution) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and
anti-p65 (ab7970, 1:1000 dilution) from Abcam.
RNA purification and quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted with
TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) from SW480, MDA-MB-231, HCT116, and
SW480 stably expressing LacZ or p53 shRNA and treated with 12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α
for the indicated time points. Reactions were performed using SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in duplicate using samples from at least
three independent cell harvests and the specificity of amplification was
examined by melting curve analysis. Primers used for qRT-PCR analysis are listed
in Supplementary Table 3. The relative levels of eRNA and mRNA expression were
calculated according to the (ΔΔCt) method32 and individual expression data was
normalized to GAPDH. The gene expression levels determined after TNF-α
treatment are relative to the levels before TNF-α treatment.
Invasion assay. Invasion assays were performed using SW480 cells that inducibly
express shRNA against LacZ or mutp53 and were pre-treated with or without
12.5 ng ml−1 recombinant TNF-α in low-serum media (0.1% serum) for 24 h prior
to plating 1–2 × 105 cells from each condition on 24-well-PET inserts with 8 μm
pore size (Falcon), coated with BD Matrigel (BD Bioscience). The lower chamber
was filled with high-serum media (20% serum) without TNF-α. Cells that
passed through the Matrigel after 24h were fixed, stained, imaged, and counted
after. Representative scale bars were added using ImageJ.
Colorectal carcinoma tumor analysis. Five colorectal carcinoma tumors and their
corresponding paired normal colon tissue were obtained from Biorepository Tissue
Technology Shared Resource at Moores Cancer Center (UC San Diego), following
informed consent from patients. Samples were dissected by pathologists, and
frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular analyses. Briefly, RNA extraction from the
tissue samples was done using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen). Extracted RNA
was subsequently treated with DNase I (Worthington Biochem) before being
reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen), and amplified with SYBR Green PCR master mix. qRT-PCR primer
sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 3. The DNA-binding domain of
p53 was amplified from cDNA by PCR and submitted for sequencing. Primers used
for PCR amplification are listed in Supplementary Table 4. For extraction of
protein from the tumor samples, genomic DNA was first precipitated with ethanol
and isolated by centrifuging the organic phase after TRIzol purification of the RNA.
Isopropanol was added to the phenol–ethanol supernatant obtained after isolation
of the genomic DNA to precipitate the protein. The protein precipitate was washed
with 0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride in 95% ethanol and then dissolved in 1% SDS
at 50 °C. Extracted proteins were quantified using Protein Assay Reagent Dye
Concentrate (Bio-Rad) and 20 µg of total protein was analyzed by immunoblot.
Purification of recombinant proteins. GOF p53 mutants were generated by site-
directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). Wild-type and GOF p53 mutants
were expressed in bacteria and purified on M2 agarose (Sigma). The p65 protein,
which was kindly provided by Gourisankar Ghosh (UC San Diego) was purified on
Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) and Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) columns following
expression from pFAST-BAC1 vector in Sf9 cells.
In vitro protein-binding assay. For binding assays, excess His-tagged p65 protein
was incubated with FLAG-tagged p53 proteins in binding buffer (150 mM NaCl,
20 mM Hepes at pH 7.9, 0.1% NP40) for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein complexes were
then incubated with M2 agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times
with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA,
150 mM KCl, 0.1% NP40). Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer and
analyzed by immunoblot.
Co-immunoprecipitation. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, SW480 cells were
treated with 12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α for 0 or 16 h, crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde
(Sigma), harvested, and washed with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in RIPA
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5%
Na-deoxycholate), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and
incubated on ice for 30 min before isolating the nuclear pellet by centrifugation at
4 °C. The pellet was then further lysed by resuspension in hypotonic buffer (20 mM
Hepes at pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 25% glycerol) and high-salt buffer
(20 mM Hepes at pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 800 mM KCl, 25% glycerol, 1% NP40)
followed by rotation at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated
with indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. After an additional 2 h incubation with
Protein A Sepharose (Rockland Inc.), beads were washed with wash buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% NP40) five
times and analyzed by immunoblotting.
RNA-seq analysis. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol LS reagent from SW480-
expressing short hairpin RNA against either LacZ or p53, treated with 12.5 ng ml−1
TNF-α for 0 or 16 h. Strand-specific libraries from two biological replicates were
generated from 1 µg total RNA, following the dUTP second strand cDNA
method33. Briefly, RNA Isolation was subjected to two consecutive rounds of oligo
(dT) enrichment using magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) followed by
fragmentation. Isolated RNA species were then used for First-Strand cDNA
Synthesis using SuperScript III in the presence of Actinomycin D (Invitrogen).
Strand specificity was maintained by second-Strand synthesis with dUTP. The ends
on the double stranded DNA were then repaired, followed by the addition of the
A-tail. Adaptor ligation was performed using NEXTflex barcodes (Bioo Scientific)
and Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (UDG) treatment was performed to selectively
degrade the strand marked with dUTP. The remaining strand was PCR amplified
for nine cycles to generate a sequencing library. Final PCR products were then size
selected to have an average size of 250 bp and purified using DNA Clean &
Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research). DNA concentrations were determined using
Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and pooled for sequencing. cDNA libraries were
single-end sequenced (50 bp) on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Sequencing reads were
mapped to hg38 human genome using STAR34. Gene expression levels were
counted per gene model (not counting differentiated splices) and differential
expression across samples were determined using edgeR35. Gene ontology
enrichment (GO) analysis was performed using Metascape36.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. p53, RNAPII, and histone chromatin immu-
noprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using SW480, MDA-MB-231, or
HCT116 cells that were (i) untreated or treated with 12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α for the
indicated time points or (ii) transfected with indicated siRNAs and treated with
12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α for 0 or 16 h. Cells were reversibly cross-linked using a final
concentration of 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quenched

 by adding glycine (Fisher Scientific) to a final concentration of 125 mM. In place of
tip-sonication, isolated chromatin was fragmented to an average size of 200–600 bp
with a biorupter Pico (Diagenode). Precleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated
overnight at 4 °C and immunocomplexes were collected with Protein A agarose
coupled with salmon sperm DNA (EMD Millipore) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immu-
nocomplexes were washed and eluted, crosslinks were reversed at 65 °C for 4 h or
overnight, and DNA was purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed using ABI Real-Time PCR
machine to measure the relative amounts of ChIP DNA and results were quantified
relative to inputs as detailed37. The levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were
determined relative to the total H3 levels. Primer sets are listed in Supplementary
Table 2.
p65 ChIP and ChIP-seq. For p65 ChIP-qPCR and all ChIP-seq assays (p53, p65,
RNAPII, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), 20–24 million cells were first crosslinked in
6 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate (ProteoChem) in PBS for 30 min, then subsequently
in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Crosslinking was then
quenched by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. Cells were
then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM
EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The
resuspended cells were then transferred to an ice-cold homogenizer and dounced
for 10 strokes. Nuclei were collected and resuspended in shearing buffer (0.1% SDS,
0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and the isolated chromatin was fragmented to an average size
of 200–600 bp with biorupter Pico sonicator. Immunocomplexes were collected
from 65 μg of sheared chromatin with Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) overnight
at 4 °C. Following the overnight incubation, immunocomplexes bound to Dyna-
beads were resuspended in wash buffer (50 mM Hepes at pH 7.6, 500 mM LiCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.7% Na-deoxycholate). The beads were washed eight
times followed by two additional TE (1× TE at pH 8, 50 mM NaCl) washes. The
immunocomplexes were eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, 10 mM
EDTA, 1% SDS) and the crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65 °C. Samples were
subsequently treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and 0.2 µg ml−1 proteinase K for
2 h. The ChIP DNA was isolated using the DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed to measure the
relative amounts of ChIP DNA and results were quantified relative to inputs as
detailed37.
Sequential ChIP experiments were performed exactly as described above with
minor modifications. Specifically, 150 μg of sheared chromatin was used to perform
the IP. Following the washes after the first IP, immunocomplexes were eluted in
re-IP elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT),
diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, 167 mM NaCl, 0.01%
SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA), and incubated with the second IP
antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by additional washes and the final elution as
described above.
For ChIP-seq experiments, the IP’s were performed as described above and the
eluted ChIP DNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer, and 2–5 ng of
ChIP DNA was used to prepare the sequencing libraries from two biological
replicates using the TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina). Briefly, ChIP DNA was end-repaired and Illumina TruSeq
adaptors were ligated to the ends of the ChIP fragments. Adaptor-ligated ChIP
DNA fragments with average size of 350 bp were used to construct libraries
according to Illumina’s specifications. Prepared libraries were single-end sequenced
(50 bp) on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Sequencing reads were mapped to the hg38
human genome using Bowtie2 software38 and default parameters. The mapped
reads were then processed to make TagDirectory module using HOMER11 for
filtering. Briefly, PCR duplications were removed and only uniquely mapped reads
were kept for further analysis. The genome browser files for the resulting reads
were generated by using makeUCSCfile module from HOMER. Enriched regions
for p65 or histone-modification deposition were called using findPeaks module
from HOMER by using preset options, factor or histone styles, respectively,
and compared with the corresponding inputs. For p53 R273H peak calling,
p53-enriched regions were first generated by HOMER in comparison to
corresponding inputs. The resulting regions were split into subpeaks using
PeakSplitter (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/bertone/software). For the
identification of mutp53 and p65 peak colocalization, p65 peaks were first divided
into two groups with and without uninduced mutp53 binding by using the
co-bound option of the mergePeak module from HOMER. Induced mutp53 peaks
that were co-bound with p65 with and without 0 h p53 peaks identified in the
previous step were defined as maintained and gained p53 peaks. Deeptools were
used to generate heat maps39. De novo motif analysis was performed from the top
peaks, which were rank-ordered by the intensity of mutp53 and NFκB/p65 peaks
and grouped as described above for defining maintained and gained mutp53 peaks
using “findMotifsGenome.pl” of Homer with ±100 bp window relative to the peak
center. Putative motif loci of motifs from each category (gained versus maintained)
were extracted from merged mutp53 and NFκB peaks with de novo motifs using
“annotatePeaks.pl”. The length of the motifs was adjusted and merged to one bed
file using “intersectBed”, and motif consensus sequence logos were generated by the
“seqLogo” package of R.
Global run on-seq. Global run-on reactions were performed using SW480 cells
treated with 12.5 ng ml−1 TNF-α for 0 or 16 h. 5 million nuclei in 100 µl freezing
buffer (40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8) were
run on by addition of 50 µl NRO-reaction buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM
KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5% Sarkosyl, 1.5 mM DTT, 0.2 U μl−1 SUPERase-in
(ThermoFisher Scientific), 375 µM ATP, 375 µM GTP, 0.6 µM CTP, 375 µM
BrUTP (Sigma) for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 750 µl
TRIzol LS and purified following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was frag-
mented in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM ZnCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 at 70 °C for
15 min and stopped by addition of 2× EDTA. For nascent RNA enrichment,
fragmented RNA samples were incubated with 50 µl equilibrated Anti-BrdU
agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 500 µl GRO-binding buffer
(0.25× SSPE, 0.05% Tween, 37.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) at 4 °C for 1 h under
gentle rotation. Anti-BrdU beads were equilibrated by washing once with GRO-
binding buffer, followed by one wash with binding buffer with 500 mM NaCl and
two consecutives washes with GRO-binding buffer. Following the IP, beads were
transferred to Ultrafree MC column (EMD Millipore) and spun at 1000 rcf for 30 s.
Flow through was discarded and beads were washed three times with GRO-binding
buffer for 5 min. The columns were then moved to fresh tubes and RNA samples
were eluted twice with 200 µl TRIzol LS under gentle shaking for 3–5 min. RNA
repair and libraries were prepared from two biological replicates. Libraries were
amplified for 12 cycles, size selected for 165–215 bp, and sequenced on Illumina
HiSeq 4000. Reads were then mapped to hg38 genome using bowtie2. Only
uniquely mapped reads were kept and at most three reads at each unique genomic
position. GRO-seq reads were counted 1000 bp around specified transcription
factors peaks and normalized to 10 million total reads using default setting of
annotatePeaks module of HOMER. Five reads (RPKM > 0.5) were used as the
threshold for defining significant eRNA synthesis.
