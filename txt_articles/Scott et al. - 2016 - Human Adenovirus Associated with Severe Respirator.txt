 Several human adenoviruses (HAdVs) can cause respirato-
ry infections, some severe. HAdV-B7, which can cause se-
vere respiratory disease, has not been recently reported in 
the United States but is reemerging in Asia. During October 
2013–July 2014, Oregon health authorities identified 198 
persons with respiratory symptoms and an HAdV-positive 
respiratory tract specimen. Among 136 (69%) hospitalized 
persons, 31% were admitted to the intensive care unit and 
18% required mechanical ventilation; 5 patients died. Molec-
ular typing of 109 specimens showed that most (59%) were 
HAdV-B7, followed by HAdVs-C1, -C2, -C5 (26%); HAdVs-
B3, -B21 (15%); and HAdV-E4 (1%). Molecular analysis of 
7 HAdV-B7 isolates identified the virus as genome type d, a 
strain previously identified only among strains circulating in 
Asia. Patients with HAdV-B7 were significantly more likely 
than those without HAdV-B7 to be adults and to have longer 
hospital stays. HAdV-B7 might be reemerging in the United 
States, and clinicians should consider HAdV in persons with 
severe respiratory infection.
H
uman adenoviruses (HAdVs) are a common cause 
of respiratory infection in persons of all ages. Acute 
upper and lower respiratory tract diseases, including pneu-
monia and bronchitis, have been attributed to HAdVs. Al-
though many infections are mild, some persons, such as 
very young children, elderly or immunocompromised per-
sons, or persons who have underlying pulmonary or cardiac 
disease, might be at increased risk for severe disease (1–4). 
HAdV infection can occur sporadically, endemically, or 
epidemically and often is influenced by HAdV species and 
type (4). Common settings for infection include the com-
munity, military recruit training centers, hospitals, and 
chronic care facilities (3,5–8).
HAdV comprises 7 species (A–G), and >51 types 
have been characterized by immunotypic and molecu-
lar methods. HAdVs that are most often associated with 
symptomatic respiratory infections include species B 
(types 3, 7, 14, and 21), species C (types 1, 2, and 5), and 
species E (type 4) (9). Infections with HAdV-C often are 
endemic, mild, and most commonly seen in young chil-
dren (2). HAdVs can be shed from the respiratory and gas-
trointestinal tracts for weeks or longer, even in persons 
who are no longer symptomatic, especially young children 
and immunocompromised persons (10). In comparison, 
HAdV-B– and HAdV-E–associated respiratory infections 
are more commonly seen as part of an epidemic or as spo-
radic cases in adults, and infections with these viruses are 
often more severe (11).
Circulating HAdVs can vary temporally and geo-
graphically; emergent genomic variants are possibly asso-
ciated with more severe illness (8,12,13). Recent reports 
have noted severe respiratory disease associated with the 
reemergence of HAdV-B7 and genomic variant 7d in Chi-
na and other countries in Asia (14–16). However, HAdV-
B7 was rarely reported in the United States during the past 
decade (17,18). Among a convenience sample of 291 spec-
imens sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) from mid-2004 through 2013 for HAdV typing, 
only 7 (2.4%) were identified as HAdV-B7 (D.D. Erdman, 
pers. comm.).
In March 2014, clinicians in the metropolitan areas of 
Eugene and Portland, Oregon, USA, reported an increase 
in the number of HAdV detections among specimens from 
hospitalized patients with severe respiratory infections to 
the Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD). In this study, 
we describe the clinical, epidemiologic, and viral molecu-
lar features of this cluster of HAdV-positive cases identi-
fied during October 2013–July 2014.
Methods
OPHD asked 3 major hospital systems that perform HAdV 
diagnostic testing to participate in the investigation. The 
hospital systems comprised 14 facilities located primar-
ily within the Eugene and Portland metropolitan areas.

 Human Adenovirus, Oregon
Facilities averaged 210 beds (range 25–688) and 11,774 
admissions annually (range 1,263–35,614). These hospital 
systems were asked to provide information on HAdV-pos-
itive specimens from patients with respiratory infections 
diagnosed after September 2013. Requested information 
comprised basic demographic and clinical data and wheth-
er specimens were available for HAdV typing. On April 
19, 2014, OPHD released a statewide notice through the 
Health Alert Network requesting providers in Oregon to 
consider HAdV in the differential diagnosis for patients 
presenting with severe pneumonia or for unusual clusters 
of pneumonia.
We also obtained historical HAdV detection data from 
Oregon clinical laboratories that reported to the National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System to re-
view recent trends in HAdV detections. In addition, 2 large 
Oregon hospital systems with available HAdV detection 
data compared HAdV detections for November 2013–April 
2014 with those for November–April from the respiratory 
disease seasons of the previous 3 years (i.e., 2010–11, 
2011–12, 2012–13).
The study population comprised persons in whom 
HAdV was detected in respiratory specimens during Oc-
tober 2013–July 2014 by hospital laboratories that perform 
virus isolation, direct fluorescent antibody, or PCR for 
HAdV detection (retrospective and prospective) and were 
willing to submit data to OPHD and CDC. A case-patient 
was defined as a person with respiratory symptoms and a 
positive HAdV laboratory test result. Illness was defined as 
severe if the patient was hospitalized.
We reviewed available medical records and collected 
the following information: basic demographic informa-
tion, symptom onset date, symptoms, hospital admis-
sion and discharge dates, intensive care unit (ICU) ad-
mission, use of mechanical ventilation, specimen type 
and collection date, and HAdV laboratory results. The 
medical record review was conducted under Oregon’s 
special study statute for issues of public health signifi-
cance (http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/rules/oars_300/
oar_333/333_019.html).
Available clinical specimens were shipped to the Or-
egon State Public Health Laboratory and then submitted 
to the CDC for HAdV confirmation and molecular typing. 
HAdV-positive specimens were typed by either conven-
tional PCR and sequencing of HAdV hexon gene hyper-
variable regions 1–6 or by HAdV type-specific real-time 
PCR assays, as previously described (19,20). For enhanced 
genetic comparisons, genomic sequencing was performed 
on 7 HAdV-B7–positive samples collected during January 
2014–May 2014. Deep sequencing libraries were prepared 
by using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep Kit and se-
quenced (250-bp paired-end sequencing) on an Illumina 
MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (both from Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA) (protocol available on request). In silico genome 
restriction enzyme digestion profiles were generated by 
using NEBcutter V2.0 (21), and genome-type determina-
tions were based on the classification system previously 
described (22). Sequences were compared with HAdV-B7 
genome type d (HAdV-B7d) reference strains 0901HZ/
Shx/CHN/2009 (GenBank accession no. JF800905.1) and 
human/CHN/DG01/2011/7[P7H7F7] (GenBank acces-
sion no. KC440171.1). We used sequence alignment and 
neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree construction to com-
pare the phylogenetic relationships among a representative 
sample of HAdV-B7 genomic sequences using ClustalW 
implemented in BioEdit version 7.0.5 (23) and MEGA7, 
respectively (24). We excluded cases determined by CDC 
to be HAdV-negative.
We used Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, 
USA) for data entry and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA) for data analysis. Mantel-Haenszel χ2 was 
used to assess associations. A p value <0.05 was consid-
ered significant.
Results
Comparison to historical data for the past 3 years demon-
strated an increase in HAdV reports for November 2013–
April 2014. We found 2-fold and 9-fold increases in HAdV 
detections for the 2 large Oregon hospital systems for which 
historical data were available (Figure 1). HAdV detections 
from laboratories in Oregon reporting to the National Re-
spiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (Figure 2) 
increased 11-fold during the same period.
For October 9, 2013–July 7, 2014, we identified 198 
patients who had an HAdV-positive respiratory specimen. 
Most were reported from hospital systems in Portland and 
surrounding counties (56%), followed by Eugene and sur-
rounding counties (39%), Medford (4%), and 2 other loca-
tions (1%). Most (97%) cases came from 3 major hospital 
systems in Oregon (hospital system A, 77 [39%] cases; 
hospital system B, 69 [35%]; hospital system C, 46 [23%]); 
the remaining 6 cases came from a variety of sources 
around the state. Most (91%) cases occurred in residents 
of Oregon; the remainder occurred in residents of Wash-
ington (7%), and California (2%). Case-patients ranged in 
age from 3 weeks to 80 years (median 8 years); 60% were 
male. For most (87%) HAdV detections, symptom onset 
occurred or specimens were collected during January–
April 2014 (Figure 3).
Specimens from 109 (55%) HAdV patients were 
available for HAdV typing (Table 1). We identified 7 
HAdV types; HAdV-B7 was most commonly detected (64 
[59%] specimens), followed by HAdV-C2 (14 [13%]), 
HAdV-B21 (10 [9%]), HAdV-C1 (10 [9%]), HAdV-B3 
(6 [6%]), HAdV-C5 (2 [2%]), and HAdV-E4 (1 [1%]). 
In 2 (2%) cases, HAdV-C1 and -C2 were co-detected.

The genome from 7 HAdV-B7–positive samples col-
lected during January–May 2014 (GenBank accession no. 
KT963081) showed >99.9% sequence identity and gave 
identical in silico BamHI and BclI restriction profiles with 
a HAdV-B7d variant circulating in China in 2009 and 
2011 (22) (Figure 4). Specimens from 89 (45%) HAdV-
positive patients were not available for typing; 80% of 
these specimens came from hospital system A. HAdV 
type results were grouped by species (i.e., HAdV-C and 
HAdV-E), except for species B, which was grouped by 
type (i.e., HAdV-B7 and HAdVs-B3, -B21) to better high-
light specific features of the rarely reported HAdV-B7. 
Most (74%) specimens tested were upper respiratory tract 
specimens (i.e., nasopharyngeal wash or nasopharyngeal 
swab samples). Case-patients with HAdV-C1, -C2, or 
-C5 detections were generally younger (median age 1.2 
years) than those with HAdVs-B3 or -B21 (median age 
24.0 years) and HAdV-B7 (median age 20.0 years) (Table 
1). Case-patients with HAdV-B7 were significantly older 
than those with non–HAdV-B7 (Table 2).
For all case-patients, the most common symptoms 
were fever (75%), cough (61%), shortness of breath (26%), 
nausea or vomiting (24%), and rhinorrhea (22%) (Table 1). 
Pneumonia was reported for 32% of the 198 HAdV patients 
(41% of those with HAdV-B7, 31% of those with HAdVs-
B3 or -B21, 21% of those with HAdVs-C1, -C2, or -C5). A

total of 136 (69%) persons were hospitalized (Table 1), and 
62 (31%) were outpatients seen in the emergency depart-
ment or in outpatient clinics. HAdV-B patients were more 
often hospitalized (HAdVs-B3 or -B21: 81%; HAdV-B7: 
84%) than HAdVs-C1, -C2, or -C5 (64%) patients (Table 
1). Among hospitalized case-patients, 32% were admit-
ted to the ICU, and 18% required mechanical ventilation 
(Table 1); 46% of HAdV-B7 case-patients were admitted 
to the ICU (Table 1). Median length of hospital stay for 
HAdV-B7 case-patients was longer (6.5 days; interquartile 
range [IQR] 3–9.5 days) than for HAdVs-B3 or -B21 case-
patients (5.0 days; IQR 3–5 days) and HAdVs-C1, -C2, 
or -C5 case-patients (2.5 days; IQR 2–4 days). However, 
when we compared HAdV-B7 with non–HAdV-B7 case-
patients, only length of hospitalization remained statisti-
cally significant after adjustment for age; HAdV-B7 case-
patients were significantly older (adults) and hospitalized 
longer than the median (4 days) than non–HAdV-B7 case-
patients (p<0.05) (Table 2). Five (2.5%) case-patients died; 
for 2, specimens were available for typing, and both were 
HAdV-B7.
Discussion
We describe a community outbreak of HAdV in Oregon 
where HAdV-B7 was identified as the predominant HAdV 
type. HAdV-B7 was more often detected in adults than 
children and was associated with more severe disease than 
other HAdV types. In persons <18 years of age, 7 HAdV 
types were detected, whereas in most persons >18 years of 
age, HAdVs-B3, -B7, or -B21 were detected. These findings 
are consistent with other studies showing that HAdVs-C1, 
 
-C2, and -C5 are most frequently detected in young chil-
dren (17,25). Many studies have demonstrated severe ill-
ness associated with HAdV-B7 in children or in military 
recruits, but few have documented such a widespread com-
munity outbreak in which many adults experience severe 
respiratory illness (5,18,26,27). However, a high percent-
age of adults with severe respiratory disease has been re-
ported in other community outbreaks of related HAdV-B 
viruses (6,13,28,29).
Compared with non–HAdV-B7 case-patients, HAdV-
B7 case-patients were more frequently admitted to the ICU 
and mechanically ventilated, were significantly older, and 
had significantly longer hospital stays. Our findings of se-
vere infection with HAdV-B7 requiring ICU admission and 
extended hospitalization is consistent with other reports 
linking HAdV-B7 with more severe acute respiratory dis-
ease (30–32). HAdV also was detected in 5 fatal cases, 2 of 
which were identified as HAdV-B7. Although the contribu-
tion of HAdV to a patients’ death is unclear, similar reports 
of severe outcomes associated with HAdV infection have 
been documented (18,26,30).
Further molecular analysis showed that genome se-
quences of 7 Oregon HAdV-B7 isolates were identical 
to each other and nearly identical to strains circulating in 
China in 2009 and 2011. Predicted restriction enzyme pro-
files have not previously identified the genome of this virus 
(HAdV-B7d) in the United States (A. Kajon, pers. comm.) 
until recently (33). HAdV-B7d was first isolated in China 
in 1980, where it became the predominant circulating ge-
nome type at least through 1990 (22) but then disappeared 
until reemerging 21 years later (15). Severe respiratory

disease and higher case-fatality rates have been associated 
with HAdV-B7, especially HAdV-B7d. Enhanced virus fit-
ness, low herd immunity to HAdV-B7, or both might have 
contributed to the large community outbreak in Oregon.
The US military used an effective live oral vaccine 
for HAdV-E4 and HAdV-B7 from 1971 until 1999, and 
the vaccine was reintroduced in 2011 (34,35). During 
1999–2011, when the vaccine was unavailable, vaccine-
preventable HAdV infections increased substantially in US 
military personnel (36). Subsequent reintroduction of the 
vaccine in October 2011 resulted in a significant decrease 
in these HAdV infections, indicating HAdV vaccination is 
an effective prevention measure for HAdV infection in this 
setting (35). However, currently no HAdV vaccine is avail-
able for use in the general public.
Our study has several limitations. The HAdV cases 
described in this case series do not represent a population-
based sample and might not represent all HAdV cases in 
Oregon during this period. Persons with milder illness were 
not sought out at participating facilities because case find-
ing was primarily conducted in hospitals and because the 
Health Alert Network notice requested providers to consider 
HAdV in patients with severe pneumonia. Because of the 
timing of the investigation, almost half of the HAdV-pos-
itive specimens were not available for typing (many were 
cases diagnosed earlier in the study period), and 80% of 
these specimens came from 1 of the 3 major hospital sys-
tems that participated in the investigation. The molecular 
methods used for typing HAdVs in this study targeted the 
hexon hypervariable regions that have been shown to corre-
late closely with virus serotype. These methods do not pro-
vide genomic detail and might miss recombination events in 
other regions of the virus genome. Moreover, full-genome 
sequencing was performed on only 7 HAdV-B7 isolates, 
and although they were chosen from different time points in 
the outbreak, we cannot conclude that all HAdV-B7 detec-
tions were HAdV-B7d. Finally, detection of HAdV in a re-
spiratory specimen, especially HAdV-C, does not necessar-
ily imply causation because asymptomatic HAdV shedding 
can occur. HAdV-C detections in infants and young children 
with mild respiratory infections and the virus might persist 
in the adenoids and tonsils and be shed for prolonged periods

after symptoms resolve (37–39). The clinical significance of 
HAdV latency in tonsil and adenoid tissue is unclear.
HAdV type surveillance is an important tool for moni-
toring changes in predominant types and genome types. 
Shifts in HAdV types might be associated with more severe 
disease not only in vulnerable populations, such as chil-
dren, elderly persons, and immunocompromised persons, 
but might also cause community outbreaks of severe respi-
ratory disease in adults, as occurred in Oregon. Healthcare 
providers should consider HAdV in their differential di-
agnosis for patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory 
infection. Testing for HAdV using respiratory panel PCR 
assays and HAdV typing has been increasing nationwide. 
In response, CDC recently launched a voluntary and pas-
sive surveillance system to collect HAdV typing data from 
laboratories called the National Adenovirus Type Report-
ing System. The main objectives of this system are to better 
define circulation patterns of HAdV types and better moni-
tor HAdV outbreaks in the United States.
HAdV-B7 might be reemerging in the United States 
and might be associated with increased numbers of severe 
respiratory infections. Tracking the emergence of HAdV 
types in the United States will lead to early identification 
of new types and potential variants of known types. Our 
results demonstrate how HAdV surveillance might help ex-
plain clusters and sporadic cases of severe illness possibly 
related to changes in HAdV species.

Figure 4. Phylogenetic analysis of human adenovirus 7 genome type d (HAdV-B7d), Oregon, USA, 2014. Genomic sequences were 
aligned by using ClustalW implemented in BioEdit version 7.2.5 and the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed by using 
MEGA7 software (23,24). Numbers at selected nodes indicate level of support using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Sequences are 
identifoed by GenBank accession number, geographic location, year of sample collection, and virus genome type identified. Boldface 
indicates 7 identical genomic sequences identified during this study; sequences are from HAdV-B7 isolates derived from 7 different 
cases spanning the outbreak period. Scale bar indicates estimated number of nucleotide substitutions per site.
