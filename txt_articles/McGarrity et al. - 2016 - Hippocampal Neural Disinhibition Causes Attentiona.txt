Abstract
Subconvulsive hippocampal neural disinhibition, that is reduced GABAergic inhibition, has been implicated in
neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by attentional and memory deficits, including schizophrenia and age-related
cognitive decline. Considering that neural disinhibition may disrupt both intra-hippocampal processing and processing in
hippocampal projection sites, we hypothesized that hippocampal disinhibition disrupts hippocampus-dependent memory
performance and, based on strong hippocampo-prefrontal connectivity, also prefrontal-dependent attention. In support of
this hypothesis, we report that acute hippocampal disinhibition by microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist
picrotoxin in rats impaired hippocampus-dependent everyday-type rapid place learning performance on the watermaze
delayed-matching-to-place test and prefrontal-dependent attentional performance on the 5-choice-serial-reaction-time test,
which does not normally require the hippocampus. For comparison, we also examined psychosis-related sensorimotor
effects, using startle/prepulse inhibition (PPI) and locomotor testing. Hippocampal picrotoxin moderately increased
locomotion and slightly reduced startle reactivity, without affecting PPI. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the
vicinity of the infusion site showed that picrotoxin mainly enhanced burst firing of hippocampal neurons. In conclusion,
hippocampal neural disinhibition disrupts hippocampus-dependent memory performance and also manifests through
deficits in not normally hippocampus-dependent attentional performance. These behavioral deficits may reflect a disrupted
control of burst firing, which may disrupt hippocampal processing and cause aberrant drive to hippocampal projection sites.

Introduction
Attentional and memory deficits cause substantial functional
disability and are a major treatment challenge in neuro-
psychiatric
disorders,
including
schizophrenia
and
age-
related cognitive decline (Millan et al. 2012). GABAergic inhibi-
tory neurotransmission is important to shape brain activity,
and subconvulsive cortico-hippocampal neural disinhibition,
that is impaired GABAergic inhibition, has been implicated in
neuropsychiatric disorders and associated cognitive deficits
(Marin 2012). Here, we focus on hippocampal neural disinhib-
ition, aiming to examine its causal contribution to attentional
and memory deficits. Hippocampal neural disinhibition has
emerged as a key pathophysiological feature of schizophre-
nia, based on consistent findings of metabolic overactivity at
rest and altered post-mortem markers of γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)
function
in
the
hippocampus
of
schizophrenia

 patients (Lisman et al. 2008; Heckers and Konradi 2015;
Ruzicka et al. 2015). Hippocampal GABA dysfunction has also
been implicated in other cognitive disorders, notably age-
related cognitive decline (Huang and Mucke 2012; Stanley
et al. 2012; Nava-Mesa et al. 2014), although the evidence is
more preliminary than the evidence implicating GABA dys-
function in schizophrenia.
Neural disinhibition, by disrupting balanced neural activity
within the disinhibited region, may impair local cognitive pro-
cessing. This has recently been established for prefrontal GABA
dysfunction (Gruber et al. 2010; Enomoto et al. 2011; Paine et al.
2011, 2015; Pehrson et al. 2013; Pezze et al. 2014; Tse et al. 2015),
and there is also evidence linking hippocampal neural disinhib-
ition and overactivity to impaired hippocampus-dependent
memory performance (Koh et al. 2010; Murray et al. 2011;
Andrews-Zwilling et al. 2012; Bakker et al. 2012 ; Caputi et al.
2012; Gilani et al. 2014; Lovett-Barron et al. 2014). Moreover,
regional disinhibition, by causing aberrant drive of projections,
may disrupt neural activity and cognitive processing in distal
sites. Consistent with distal effects, rodent studies show that
hippocampal disinhibition and overactivity cause dopamine
system upregulation and associated behavioral effects (includ-
ing locomotor hyperactivity) (Bast et al. 2001a; Bast and Feldon
2003; Lodge and Grace 2011; Gilani et al. 2014), which—given
the strong link between dopamine and psychosis (Howes and
Kapur 2009)—may explain the consistent correlation of hippo-
campal overactivity and psychosis in schizophrenia (Liddle
et al. 1992; Schobel et al. 2009; Heckers and Konradi 2015).
Considering local and distal effects, we hypothesized that hip-
pocampal
neural
disinhibition
impairs
hippocampus-
dependent
memory
and,
based
on
strong
hippocampo-
prefrontal connectivity, also prefrontal-dependent cognitive
function,
including
attention
(Bast
2011).
This
hypothesis
would explain recent imaging findings that intrinsic hippocam-
pal overactivity correlates with memory and attentional deficits
in schizophrenia (Tregellas et al. 2014).
To
test
if
hippocampal
neural
disinhibition
disrupts
hippocampus-dependent memory and prefrontal-dependent
attention, we combined hippocampal neural disinhibition by
local microinfusion of the GABA-A antagonist picrotoxin (Bast
et al. 2001a; Pezze et al. 2014) with translational tests of clinic-
ally relevant cognitive deficits in rats. Infusions targeted tem-
poral
(also
referred
to
as
ventral)
to
intermediate
hippocampus, because this part of the hippocampus features
strong hippocampo-prefrontal connectivity and corresponds
to human anterior hippocampus, which has been implicated
in schizophrenia (Bast 2011). To test for attentional deficits,
we
used
the
5-choice-serial-reaction-time
(5-CSRT)
task,
which has high validity to measure prefrontal-dependent sus-
tained attention, as impaired in several cognitive disorders,
including schizophrenia and age-related cognitive decline
(Chudasama and Robbins 2006; Lustig et al. 2013; Romberg
et al. 2013), and requires balanced prefrontal activity (Pezze
et al. 2014). To test for memory deficits, we used the water-
maze delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) task, which requires
rats to learn rapidly (within one trial) new place information
everyday and is highly dependent on hippocampal function
(Steele and Morris 1999; Bast et al. 2009; Pezze and Bast 2012),
including function of the temporal to intermediate hippocam-
pus (presumably because these regions feature functional
connectivity to frontal and subcortical sites necessary to
translate hippocampal learning into performance; Bast et al.
2009; Bast 2011). The task resembles the everyday problem of
remembering new places and routes, and similar human tests
using virtual or real-space analogs of the watermaze reveal-
marked deficits in schizophrenia and age-related cognitive
decline (Hort et al. 2007; Fajnerova et al. 2014). For comparison
and to identify behaviorally effective doses without gross sen-
sorimotor effects, we first examined effects on locomotor
activity and startle prepulse inhibition (PPI), with locomotor
hyperactivity and PPI disruption also being widely used
psychosis-related indices (Bast and Feldon 2003; Swerdlow
et al. 2008). To examine neural changes caused by hippocam-
pal GABA dysfunction, we conducted in vivo electrophysio-
logical recordings in the vicinity of the infusion site (Pezze
et al. 2014). Of particular interest were changes in hippocam-
pal burst firing, which has been proposed to be important for
hippocampus-dependent memory function (Takahashi and
Magee 2009; Xu et al. 2012) and for driving postsynaptic tar-
gets (Lisman 1997) and has recently been suggested to depend
critically on local GABAergic inhibition, with opto- and phar-
macogenetic silencing of GABAergic interneurons enhancing
bursting (Lovett-Barron et al. 2012; Royer et al. 2012).
Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult male Lister hooded rats (Charles River) were used for all
studies: 31 for the sensorimotor experiments (2–3 months at
surgery), 11 for the 5-CSRT experiment (6–7 months at surgery),
14 for the watermaze experiments (2–3 months at surgery), and
15 for the electrophysiology (2–3 months at time of the acute
experiment). Rats were housed in groups of 4 in 2 level “Double
Decker” cages (462 mm × 403 mm × 404 mm; Tecniplast) under
temperature- and humidity-controlled (21 ± 1.5 °C; 50 ± 8%)
conditions and alternating 12 h light dark cycle (lights on at
0700 h). They had ad libitum access to water and food (Teklad
Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2018, Harlan), except for the
rats used in the 5-CSRT experiment, which were kept on a
restricted diet to keep their weight at about 85% of their pro-
jected bodyweight during behavioral testing. All rats were habi-
tuated to handling by the experimenters before the start of any
experimental procedures. All procedures were conducted in
accordance with the requirements of the United Kingdom (UK)
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Cannula Implantation for Behavioral Studies
Using stereotactic procedures described in detail previously
(Pezze et al. 2014), guide cannulae (stainless steel, 26-gauge,
protruding
8.5 mm
from
a
plastic
pedestal;
Plastics
One,
Bilaney) with stylets (stainless steel, 33 gauge; Plastics One,
Bilaney) protruding 0.5 mm were implanted into the temporal
to intermediate hippocampus, with the stylets aiming at (in
mm): 5.2 posterior to bregma, ±4.8 lateral from midline, and 6.5
ventral from dura. These coordinates were adapted from our
previous study in Wistar rats (Bast et al. 2001a) based on pilot
surgeries. After surgery, rats were given at least 4 days of recov-
ery before any testing. Throughout the recovery period, rats
underwent daily health checks and were habituated to the
manual restraint necessary for the drug microinfusions.
At the end of the experiments, brains were perfusion-
fixated and processed histologically, as described previously
(Pezze et al. 2014), to verify placements of the infusion cannu-
lae and map them onto coronal sections adapted from a rat
brain stereotaxic atlas (Paxinos and Watson 1998).

 Microinfusions for Behavioral Studies
Rats were manually restrained during the infusions. Stylets
were replaced by infusion cannulae (protruding 0.5 mm from
tip of guide cannulae, stainless steel, 33 gauge; Plastics One,
Bilaney), which were connected via flexible polyethylene tubing
to 5-µL SGE microsyringes mounted on a microinfusion pump
(sp200IZ, World Precision Instruments). A volume of 0.5 μL/side
of 0.9% sterile saline (as control) or of a solution of picrotoxin
(C30H34O13;
Sigma-Aldrich)
in
saline
(25–150 ng/0.5 μL/side,
depending on experiment) was then infused bilaterally over
1 min. The picrotoxin solutions were prepared on the day of the
experiments
from
frozen
aliquots
containing
150 ng/0.5 µL.
Movement of an air bubble, trapped in the tubing, was used to
monitor the infusion flow. Infusion cannulae were withdrawn
and replaced by stylets 60 s after completion of the infusion to
allow for absorption of the infusion bolus. Behavioral testing
started immediately after infusions had been completed and
stylets reinserted, except for sensorimotor testing, for which
rats were infused in pairs, one after the other, resulting in half
of the rats having a delay of about 3–5 min between the end of
the infusion and the start of testing.
In the 5-CSRT and watermaze experiments, mock infusions
were performed on all rats after pretraining to asymptotic per-
formance levels and before the actual infusion experiments.
Mock infusions served to habituate the rats to the infusion pro-
cedure and to verify that the infusion procedure itself does not
interfere with task performance. Mock infusions were con-
ducted in the same way as real infusions, except that the pump
was not connected to the syringes.
The picrotoxin doses used in the present study were sub-
convulsive, as we aimed to investigate the neurocognitive
sequels of neural disinhibition relevant to neuropsychiatric
disorders, not epileptic seizures. As in our previous studies
involving
hippocampal
picrotoxin
infusions
(Bast
et
al.
2001a), observations of the rats following infusions and
between infusion days did not reveal infusion-induced motor
convulsions or more subtle indicators of seizure develop-
ment, such as facial twitches, tremor, movement arrest or
wet-dog shakes, which may result from higher doses of GABA
antagonists (Bragin et al. 2009). Furthermore, our electro-
physiological studies did not indicate electrophysiological
seizure signs (see below).
Startle, PPI and Locomotor Activity Testing
We began by examining the effects of hippocampal picrotoxin
on 3 basic sensorimotor process, the acoustic startle response
and PPI of the acoustic startle response and open-field loco-
motor activity, similar to our previous studies in Wistar rats
(Bast et al. 2001a). First, these experiments allowed us to con-
firm suitable picrotoxin doses for use in the Lister hooded
strain that were behaviorally effective without causing gross
sensorimotor impairment. Second, disrupted PPI of the acoustic
startle response and locomotor hyperactivity are widely used
psychosis-related indices in rodent studies (Bast and Feldon
2003; Arguello and Gogos 2006). PPI of the acoustic startle
response refers to the reduction of the startle response to an
intense acoustic pulse by an immediately preceding weaker,
nonstartling, prepulse. It may reflect sensorimotor gating pro-
cesses, which are disrupted in schizophrenia and restored by
antipsychotic medication (even though PPI disruption is not
specific to schizophrenia and the relation of PPI deficits to
symptoms is not clear, Swerdlow et al. 2008). Startle, PPI and
locomotor tests were conducted as described in detail previ-
ously, using between-subjects designs (Pezze et al. 2014).
Nineteen rats, implanted with hippocampal cannulae, were
used to test the effects of hippocampal picrotoxin on startle
and PPI (test session lasted 23 min, including 5 min of acclima-
tization). On day 1, startle and PPI were measured without infu-
sion. On day 2, startle and PPI were measured following
infusions of saline (n = 9) or 150 ng/side picrotoxin (n = 10). On
Day 3, rats were re-tested without infusion as on day 1.
Twenty-nine preimplanted rats were used for locomotor
testing. The same rats used for the startle/PPI experiments
(except for 2 rats which fell ill) were used, 1 week later, to com-
pare the locomotor effects of hippocampal infusion of saline
(n = 6) and of 100 ng (n = 5) or 150 ng picrotoxin (n = 6) (i.e.,
these rats received a total of 2 infusions, with some rats receiv-
ing the same infusion as during the startle/PPI experiment and
others receiving a different infusion, so as to match the new
infusion
groups
with
respect
to
their
infusion
history).
Consistent with previous experiments in Wistar rats (Bast et al.
2001a), both 100 and 150 ng/side of picrotoxin ncreased loco-
motor activity. Therefore, we also examined the effects of lower
doses, using an additional 12 experimentally naïve rats, receiv-
ing either saline (n = 4), 50 ng (n = 4) or 75 ng (n = 4) picrotoxin.
On day 1, baseline locomotor activity was tested for 1 h. On day
2, following 30 min of preinfusion testing, rats received infu-
sions of saline (n = 10), 50 ng (n = 4), 75 ng (n = 4), 100 ng (n = 5)
or 150 ng (n = 6) picrotoxin and an additional 60 min of postin-
fusion testing. On day 3, rats were re-tested without infusions
as on day 1.
The purpose of locomotor and startle/PPI testing without
infusion on days 1 and 3 was to verify that there were no base-
line differences in dependent measures between groups before
infusions, and that any group differences were reflecting tem-
porary infusion-induced changes. None of the sensorimotor
measures showed any group differences on days 1 and 3 (data
not shown).
Data were analyzed using ANOVA with infusion group as
between-subjects factor and 10-min bins (locomotor activity),
test block (startle), or prepulse intensity (for PPI data) as within-
subjects factor.
5-CSRT Experiment
The 5-CSRT test requires rats to sustain and divide attention
across a row of 5 apertures to detect brief light flashes occur-
ring in random order in one of the apertures and to respond to
these flashes by nose-poking into the correct hole to receive
food reward. Procedures were described in detail previously
(Pezze et al. 2014).
Test boxes had 5 holes on one side and a food magazine on
the opposite wall. Nose pokes into holes and magazine were
detected using infrared beams. Test sessions started with deliv-
ery of one food pellet. Rats triggered a trial by nose-poking into
the magazine. The trial started after a 5 s delay (intertrial inter-
val; ITI), with a light appearing in one of the holes for a 0.5 s
stimulus duration. If the rat nose poked into that hole within a
5 s limited hold period (correct response), a reward pellet was
released into the magazine. Responses in one of the unlit 4
holes (incorrect response), failure to respond within the limited
hold period (omission), and responses during the ITI (prema-
ture response) were punished by a 5-s time-out period with the
house light turned off. Repeated responses in the same hole
(correct or incorrect) were recorded as perseverative responses.
A new trial started 5 s after the rat entered the food magazine,

 either to collect the reward or after the 5-s time-out. Test ses-
sions consisted of 100 trials or lasted 30 min, whichever was
shorter. Each rat had only one test session per day.
The main measures of attention were: % accuracy ([correct
responses/(correct responses + incorrect responses)] × 100%),
reflecting errors of commission due to faulty stimulus detec-
tion, and % omissions ([omissions/(correct responses + incorrect
responses + omissions)] × 100%), which may reflect failure to
detect the stimulus. As measures of response control, we ana-
lyzed % premature responses ([premature responses/(correct
responses + incorrect responses + omissions + premature
responses)] × 100%) and % perseverative responses ([persevera-
tive responses/(correct responses + incorrect responses + omis-
sions + premature responses)] × 100%), reflecting failure to
withhold prepotent, but inappropriate, responses. Additional
measures, to control for nonspecific motor and/or motivational
changes, were: number of trials, correct response latency
(mean duration between stimulus onset and nose poke in cor-
rect hole), and collect latency (mean duration between nose
poke in correct hole and collection of reward in food magazine).
Rats were pretrained before and retrained after surgery to
perform at stable and high performance levels (at least 80 cor-
rect trials, with 80% accuracy and 20% omissions) for at least 5
consecutive days. Rats then underwent 4 days of testing com-
bined with mock infusions, with half of the rats receiving mock
infusions on day 2 and the other half on day 4. Mock infusions
did not affect task performance (data not shown). Eleven rats
were used to test the effects of hippocampal picrotoxin infu-
sions in within-subjects studies, with testing order of drug
doses counterbalanced using a Latin-square design and each
infusion day preceded by a testing day without infusions (to
assess normal performance off-drug and avoid carry-over
effects). We tested 2 dose ranges, each including saline plus 2
picrotoxin doses. The lower dose range included saline, 25 and
75 ng picrotoxin per side (chosen because they were at the low
end of doses causing moderate locomotor hyperactivity in our
sensorimotor experiments). Testing this dose range in the first
few rats indicated no substantial effect on 5-CSRT performance.
Therefore, we included an additional higher dose range, includ-
ing saline, 75 and 150 ng per side (75 ng dose was included in
both ranges as an internal control for reproducibility of drug
effects). Of the 11 rats, 9 completed both dose ranges (receiving
a total of 6 infusions, including 2 saline infusions), with testing
at the 2 dose ranges separated by a minimum of 4 days of test-
ing without infusion (to re-establish a stable baseline) and test-
ing order counterbalanced across rats. In addition, one rat each
completed only the higher or lower dose range (because of ill-
ness). Thus, each dose range was tested in 10 rats. Data were
analyzed separately for both dose ranges by ANOVA, using
drug dose as within-subjects factor, followed by post-hoc com-
parisons using Fisher’s LSD (least significant difference) test
(which provides good power and, if preceded by ANOVA and if
only 3 means are compared as in the present study, ensures
that the familywise type-1 error rate is equal or lower than the
rate for the individual comparison; Levin et al. 1994).
Watermaze DMP Experiment
The watermaze DMP task requires rats to learn rapidly, within
one trial, the daily changing place of a hidden platform in order
to escape efficiently from a circular pool of water (Steele and
Morris 1999). The task, especially in our new modification
measuring search preference on probe trials to assess one-trial
place memory, is highly sensitive to disruption of hippocampal
function (Bast et al. 2009; Pezze and Bast 2012). Procedures were
adapted from our previous study examining the effects of hip-
pocampal drug microinfusions on the watermaze DMP test
(Pezze and Bast 2012).
Apparatus
The watermaze consisted of a 2-m diameter white fiberglass
pool, which was 60 cm high and filled with water up to 20 cm
below the pool edge. It was positioned in a well-lit (200 lux)
room, which contained a variety of extra-maze visual cues vis-
ible from the water surface, so as to aid spatial orientation,
including high-contrast wall posters and 3-dimensional visual
cues (cupboards, a traffic cone, lampshades and boxes hanging
from the wall) arranged at various distances from the pool.
Four points, equally spaced along the circumference of the pool
[North (N), East (E), South (S) and West (W); arbitrarily defined],
served as start positions. The water was made opaque with
latex (200 mL; Febflor Latex Liquid, Everbuild Building Products
Ltd). During testing, water temperature was maintained at
25 ± 1 °C. The rats’ only way to escape from the water was via a
12-cm diameter escape platform, which was hidden from the
rats’ sight 1–2 cm below the water surface.
We used a so-called “Atlantis platform” (Spooner et al.
1994), which can be withheld at >20 cm below the water sur-
face, inaccessible for the rats, by a computer-controlled electro-
magnet for a predetermined time, before rising to its normal
position (Med Associates, Inc.). This allowed us to run rewarded
probe trials during which the rats’ search preference for the
zone containing the platform location was first monitored for
60 s before the platform was made available to reinforce spa-
tially focused searching.
To record the rats’ swimming behavior, a digital camera was
mounted above the watermaze, transmitting images to a PC in
the adjacent room. The PC ran a program for video capture of
the
trials
(Pinnacle
Studio
12,
Pinnacale
Systems,
Corel
Corporation) and the Ethovision tracking software (Version XT
7, Noldus Technology) that digitizes the rats’ paths and can
compute various behavioral measures, including latencies and
path lengths to reach the platform location, and times in differ-
ent areas of the pool.
General Testing Procedure
Rats received 4 trials a day. The platform was hidden in a new
place on trial 1 of each day, remaining in this place for trials 2–
4, on which rats could use rapidly encoded place memory to
reach the escape platform efficiently. Each of the 4 start posi-
tions around the pool (N, E, S, W) was used daily in an arbitrary,
predetermined, sequence to discourage egocentric strategies.
Analysis focused on trial 2 of each day, when performance
relies on place memory encoded within trial 1, whereas trials 3
and 4 mainly served to reinforce the task‘s win-stay rule. Trial
2 was occasionally run as rewarded probe trial. During such
probe trials, the Atlantis platform was withheld at the bottom
of the pool for 60 s, to enable the measurement of search pref-
erence for the “correct” zone containing the platform location
(see below, Performance measures), and was then released
automatically (i.e., independent of the rat’s behavior) in order
to allow the rat to find and climb onto the platform and to
reinforce the win-stay rule of the task, that is that the rat had
to return to the correct location to escape from the pool. Each
trial began with the rat being gently lowered into the water
facing the pool wall at one of the 4 start positions. Ethovision
tracking was triggered by remote control as soon as the rat was

 released into the water. If rats failed to reach the platform
within 120 s, they were guided to the platform by the experi-
menter (i.e., 120 s was the maximum latency to reach the plat-
form location). Rats were left on the platform for 30 s, before
being removed from the pool and placed onto a towel in an
opaque plastic box close to the entrance of the watermaze
room until the start of the next trial. The center of the escape
platform was either located on an inner (0.8 m) or outer (1.4 m)
ring concentric with the pool. Rats were tested with a novel
location each day: as each experiment involved 20 days of
training or testing (8 days of pretraining plus 2 series of 6 days
during which the effects of hippocampal drug infusions were
tested, see below, Experimental design), 20 different locations
were used (see Fig. 1C in Pezze and Bast, 2012). The
ITI was
usually 10–30 s (i.e., as short as possible for convenience), but
on selected test days the ITI, or retention delay, between trials
1 and 2 was increased to 20 min (see below, Experimental
design), similar to previous studies showing disruptive effects
of hippocampal pharmacological manipulations (Steele and
Morris 1999; Pezze and Bast 2012).
Performance Measures
Search preference in the vicinity of the platform location during
probe trials was used as the main measure of rapid, 1-trial,
place memory performance, based on evidence from our previ-
ous studies that search preference is more sensitive than
latency and path length measures (including savings, i.e., trial
1 values—trial 2 values) to manipulations of the hippocampus
(Bast et al. 2009; Pezze and Bast 2012) and to behavioral manip-
ulations thought to affect hippocampus-dependent memory
(da Silva et al. 2014). The main reason for the lower sensitivity
of path lengths measures is that they have a much higher vari-
ability (with trial one path lengths in particular being highly
chance dependent) than search preference (compare da Silva
et al., 2014). Therefore, since introduction of probe trials as part
of the DMP procedure (Bast et al., 2009), we have been using
search preference as the main performance measure in our
watermaze DMP experiments (as has long been the case for the
standard watermaze paradigm). To quantify search preference,
eight 40-cm diameter “virtual” zones were defined on the inner
and outer ring of the pool, so that one zone, the “correct” zone,
was concentric with the platform location, and all 8 zones were
nonoverlapping, evenly spaced, and symmetrically arranged.
The time spent in each of these 8 zones during the 60-s probe
trial was determined automatically using the Ethovision soft-
ware. From these measures, the “% time spent in the correct
zone” was calculated as: [time in “correct zone” (s)/time in all 8
zones (s)] x 100%. By chance, this value should be 100%/
8 = 12.5%, whereas higher values indicate a search preference
for the correct zone. In addition, latencies and path lengths to
reach the platform perimeter were recorded for all trials, with
steep reduction from trial 1 to trial 2 indicating 1-trial place
memory. Path lengths have the advantage over latencies that
they measure the efficiency in reaching the platform independ-
ent of potential drug-induced swim speed changes. Therefore,
on infusion days, analysis focused on path lengths.
Experimental Design to Test the Effects of Hippocampal Picrotoxin
Infusions
Fourteen rats, preimplanted with hippocampal guide cannulae,
were pretrained on the task for 8 days, using a novel location
each day, before testing infusion effects. Rats were divided in 2
batches to be trained with 1 of 2 different sequences of daily
platform locations, so that on each day 2 different platform
locations were used for pretraining; the purpose of this was to
reduce the risk that a day’s performance measures are biased
by the properties of specific platform locations. The ITI between
trial 1 and trial 2 was 10–30 s (i.e., as short as possible for con-
venience, because it reduced the time required for training) for
the first 4 days of pretraining and 20 min for the remaining
days. The ITIs for trials 2–4 were always 10–30 s for conveni-
ence. On pretraining days 6 and 8, trial 2 was run as probe. In
addition, rats received a mock infusion immediately before trial
1 on either day 6 or 8. Half of the rats received the mock infu-
sion on day 6, the other half on day 8, with start positions and
platform
locations
counterbalanced
between
the
mock-
infusion and no-mock-infusion condition. As in our previous
studies (Bast et al. 2009; Jackson et al. 2011; Pezze and Bast
2012; da Silva et al. 2014), rats showed asymptotic task perform-
ance at the end of pretraining, characterized by marked latency
reduction from trial 1 to trial 2 and strong search preference on
the probe trials, without any effect of mock infusions (data not
shown).
Following pretraining, the effects of bilateral saline or picro-
toxin (75 or 150 ng/side) infusions were then compared in a
within-subjects design. Doses were chosen based on the 5-
CSRT experiments, where 150 ng caused attentional deficits,
and 75 ng was without effect. Each rat received 3 doses (includ-
ing saline) across 3 infusion days, with each infusion day pre-
ceded by a testing day without infusion. This series of 3
infusions was repeated once more (resulting in a total of 6 infu-
sions, including 2 saline infusions). The values from the 2 series
were averaged to obtain one single value for each infusion con-
dition (for one rat, values for all infusion conditions could only
be collected in one series, and, therefore, for this rat, only the
values from this one series were considered). On infusion days,
rats received hippocampal infusions immediately before trial 1,
and trial 2 was run 20 min after trial 1 as a probe to measure
search preference. In both infusion series, testing order, as well
as start positions and platform locations, was counterbalanced
across the infusion conditions. The DMP task was run as during
pretraining, with a new platform location, different from the
pretraining locations, used everyday. As during pretraining,
rats continued to be trained with 1 of 2 different sequences of
daily platform locations, so that on each day 2 different plat-
form locations were used.
Data Analysis
One average value for each performance measure in each infu-
sion condition was calculated from the 2 series of infusions for
each rat, before path length and search preference measures
were subjected to ANOVA with infusion and trials (only for
path lengths) as within-subject factors. Main effects were
examined further using Fisher’s LSD test. To test for significant
one-trial place memory, in each infusion condition, search
preference was compared with chance (12.5%) and trial 1 and
trial 2 path lengths were compared, using one-sample or paired
sample t-tests (2-tailed), respectively.
In Vivo Electrophysiology to Measure the Effects of
Hippocampal Microinfusions in the Vicinity of the
Infusion Site
Multiunit and local field potential (LFP) activity in the vicinity
of the infusion site was recorded under isofluorane anesthesia
using a custom-made assembly of a 33-gauge stainless-steel

 infusion cannula and an 8-electrode (microwire) recording
array. Methods were as described in detail in our previous
study using such an infusion-recording array in the medial pre-
frontal cortex (Pezze et al. 2014), except that recording site and
aspects of the data analysis were adapted for the hippocampus.
The infusion-recording assembly (see Fig. 5A) consisted of a
33-gauge stainless-steel infusion cannula attached to an 8-
channel microwire array (eight 50-μm Teflon-coated stainless-
steel wires, with an impedance of about 100 kΩ measured at
1 kHz and arranged in one row of about 2 mm) with a stainless-
steel groundwire (NB Labs). The cannula tip touched the elec-
trodes and was positioned about 0.5 mm above the tips of the
central electrodes. The end of the cannula was connected to a
1-µL syringe via flexible tubing. Infusion cannula and tubing
were
filled
with
picrotoxin
solution
or
saline
before
the
infusion-recording assembly was inserted into the brain. A
small air bubble was trapped where the tubing was connected
to the syringe, with movement of the bubble serving to verify a
successful infusion. To prevent leakage and drug diffusion
before the infusion, the piston of the syringe was pulled back to
draw up a 0.25-µL air “plug” separating the infusion solution
from the brain‘s extracellular space. The assembly was stereo-
tactically implanted into the right hippocampus, such that the
electrode array was arranged perpendicular to the brain mid-
line and anterior to the infusion cannula, with the cannula tip
aimed at the same coordinates as in the behavioral experi-
ments (5.2 mm posterior to bregma, 4.8 mm lateral from mid-
line, and 6.5 mm ventral from dura).
To record extracellular measures of neural activity, the elec-
trode array was connected via a unity-gain multichannel head-
stage to a multichannel preamplifier (Plexon, Inc.), which
amplified (×1000) the analog signal and band-pass filtered it
into multiunit spikes (250 Hz to 8 kHz) and LFP signals (0.7 Hz to
170 Hz).
The
analog
signals
were
fed
to
a
Multichannel
Acquisition Processor (MAP) system (Plexon, Inc.). Multiunit
and LFP data were viewed online and recorded with Real-Time
Acquisition System Programs for Unit Timing in Neuroscience
(RASPUTIN) software (Plexon, Inc.).
After positioning the assembly and stabilization (at least 30
min), LFP data were recorded continuously and multiunit
spikes were recorded when a predefined amplitude threshold
of −300 μV was crossed. Data were recorded for a 30 min base-
line and a 60 min period following hippocampal infusion of
0.5 μL of saline (n = 7) or 150 ng picrotoxin in 0.5 μL saline (n =
8). For infusions, the piston of the 1-μL syringe was moved
manually at a slow speed (ca. 0.5 μL/min as in the behavioral
studies) to remove the 0.25-μL air plug from the injector tip and
inject 0.5 μL of saline (n = 7) or of 150 ng picrotoxin in 0.5 μL
saline (n = 8) into the hippocampus.
Following completion of the recordings, the rat was killed by
increasing the isofluorane level. The positions of the most lat-
eral and most medial electrodes were marked by passing cath-
odic current (0.2 mA, 10 s) to deposit ferric ions, which could be
revealed by the Prussian Blue Reaction following fixation of the
brain in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution containing 4% potas-
sium ferrocyanide. Locations of the marked electrode tips were
mapped onto coronal sections of the rat brain stereotaxic atlas
by Paxinos and Watson (1998).
From the multiunit data, firing rate and burst parameters
(number of bursts, % of spikes fired as bursts, mean firing rate
within bursts, mean burst duration, interburst interval) were cal-
culated in 5-min bins for each correctly placed electrode.
Hippocampal bursts were defined as more than 2 spikes with an
interspike interval shorter than 6 ms (Royer et al. 2012). From the
LFP recordings, we calculated the area under the curve of the
power spectral density function (AUC of PSD) from 0.7 to 170 Hz
as a measure of overall LFP power for every 5-min block (Pezze
et al. 2014). For normalization to baseline, values from individual
channels were divided by the average values obtained from the
same channel during the six 5-min baseline blocks. Normalized
values were averaged across all channels per individual rat, and
these average values were used to calculate means for the differ-
ent infusion groups. Differences between infusion groups were
examined, using ANOVA with infusion as between-subjects fac-
tor and 5-min block as within-subjects factor.
Results
Infusion Cannula Placements in Behavioral Studies
Infusion cannula tips were primarily placed within the tem-
poral to intermediate hippocampus, within an area correspond-
ing to 4.8–6.3 mm (5.6–6.3 mm in the Watermaze experiments)
posterior to bregma in Paxinos and Watson (1998) (Fig. 1). In the
locomotor and PPI experiments, the infusion sites tended to be
slightly deeper than in the other 2 experiments, with several
placements encroaching on the entorhinal cortex. Therefore,
the locomotor and PPI effects in the present study may partly
reflect the impact of picrotoxin within the entorhinal cortex.
The entorhinal cortex features strong prefrontal and subcor-
tical projections similar to temporal to intermediate hippocam-
pus
and
previous
studies
indicate
that
stimulation
or
disinhibition of these sites has a similar impact on prefrontal
cortex and subcortical sites (Lopes da Silva et al. 1990; Jay and
Witter 1991; Gigg et al. 1994; Groenewegen et al. 1999; Mitchell
et al. 2000; Floresco et al. 2001). Visible brain damage was
restricted to the area immediately surrounding the guide can-
nula and the injection site (0.5 mm below the end of the guide).
Hippocampal Disinhibition Reduces Startle, Without
Affecting PPI, and Increases Locomotor Activity
Hippocampal picrotoxin (150 ng/side) reduced startle reactivity
on pulse-alone trials, especially during the first test block,
before startle habituation led to similarly low startle amplitude
in saline and picrotoxin groups (main effect of infusion:
F1,17 = 6.60, P = 0.020; interaction infusion × test block:
F2,34 = 6.85, P = 0.003) (Fig. 2A, left). Infusions did not affect PPI
at any prepulse intensity (main effect of infusion: F1,17 = 1.21,
P = 0.29; interaction infusion × prepulse intensity: F3,51 < 1)
(Fig. 2A, right).
While all groups showed similar locomotor activity in the
30 min preceding infusions (main effect or interaction involving
the factor infusion: both F < 1), picrotoxin (50, 75, 100 or 150 ng/
side) infusions increased locomotor activity compared with
saline, especially during the first 30–40 min of the 60-min post-
infusion testing (main effect of infusion: F4,24 = 6.11, P = 0.002;
interaction infusion × 10-min block: F20,120 = 2.86, P = 0.005)
(Fig. 2B).
5-CSRT Experiment: Hippocampal Neural Disinhibition
Causes Attentional Deficits
Hippocampal picrotoxin selectively impaired attention on the
5-CSRT test at the highest dose (150 ng), as indicated by
reduced accuracy (Fig. 3), without significant effects on other
performance measures or at other doses (Table 1). Testing at
the higher dose range (saline, 75 and 150 ng) revealed a dose-
dependent reduction of % accuracy (F2,18 = 6.57, P = 0.007), with

 150 ng reducing accuracy as compared with saline (P = 0.003)
and 75 ng (P = 0.012), which did not differ from saline (P = 0.54).
Watermaze DMP Task: Hippocampal Disinhibition
Impairs 1-Trial Place Memory Performance
Hippocampal picrotoxin impaired performance based on 1-trial
place memory (Fig. 4). Search preference during probe trials
was dose-dependently reduced (F2,26 = 6.3, P = 0.006), with
search preference at 150 ng significantly reduced as compared
with saline (P = 0.002) and tending to be lower than at 75 ng
(P = 0.05), which did not significantly differ from the saline con-
dition (P = 0.15) (Fig. 4A). Search preference at 150 ng did not
differ from chance (12.5%) (t13 < 1), whereas rats performed
above chance at 75 ng (t13 = 2.2, P = 0.04) and with saline
(t13 = 3.5, P = 0.005).

 Path-length data also supported that hippocampal picro-
toxin impaired performance based on rapid place learning
(Fig. 4B). Path length analysis revealed an infusion effect
(F2,26 = 5.1, P = 0.01), reflecting higher path lengths at the high
picrotoxin
dose,
compared with
saline
(Saline
vs. 150 ng,
P = 0.004; Saline vs. 75 ng, P = 0.12; 75 ng vs. 150 ng, P = 0.13),
and a trial effect (F3,39 = 23.2, P < 0.0001), reflecting path length
reduction across trials. Although the dose × trial interaction
was not significant (F6,78 = 1.3, P = 0.29), the increase of path
lengths by picrotoxin, as compared with saline, appeared
mainly driven by a less pronounced path-length reduction
between trial 1 and trial 2, indicating impaired 1-trial place
memory.
Consistent
with
this,
path
lengths
significantly
decreased from trial 1 to trial 2 in the saline condition
(t13 = 4.36, P = 0.001), but not at 75 ng (t13 = 1.8, P = 0.09) or
150 ng picrotoxin (t13 < 1). Picrotoxin infusions also numerically
reduced path lengths savings from trial 1 to trial 2 (trial 1 path

nificant (F2,13 = 1.7, P = 0.20). The pattern of infusion effects on
latency measures was virtually identical to the one reported for
the path length measures (data not shown). Thus, overall path
length and latency measures support impairments in rapid
place learning performance due to hippocampal picrotoxin
infusion, although the relevant infusion effects on these mea-
sures failed to reach statistical significance. This is consistent
with our previous studies showing that path length measures
are less sensitive than the search preference measure to hippo-
campal manipulations (Bast et al. 2009; Pezze and Bast 2012)
and
to
behavioral
manipulations

to
affect
hippocampus-dependent memory (da Silva et al. 2014).
To further characterize the nature of the impairment caused
by hippocampal picrotoxin on the watermaze DMP test, we per-
formed additional analyses of rats behavior during trial 1. First,
during trial 1, rats spent a similar proportion of the trial

 duration (i.e., the time until rats reached the platform) in all 8
zones, regardless of the infusion condition [(time in all 8 zones/
trial duration) × 100%, mean + SEM: Saline, 42.7 + 1.5%; 75 ng
picrotoxin, 43.3 + 1.9%; 150 ng picrotoxin, 38.5 + 3.2%; F2,26 = 1.2,
P = 0.31]. This pattern of results suggests that hippocampal
neural disinhibition does not impair normal search behavior,
consistent with informal observations of the rats’ behavior dur-
ing the experiment. Second, we analyzed which proportion of
trial-1 time spent in these 8 zones was spent in the zone con-
taining the platform location on the previous day (previous
day’s zone). Intact rats typically spend more time in the previ-
ous day’s zone than expected based on chance (12.5%), indicat-
ing place memory for the previous day’s correct location
acquired during the 4 trials completed on the previous day
(Steele and Morris, 1999). If picrotoxin-infused rats spent more
time in the previous day’s zone during trial 1, this could be
taken to reflect perseverative behavior, which might interfere
with learning of the new location. If they spent less time, this
could reflect impaired retrieval/expression of place memory
acquired during the 4 trials of the previous day (Steele and
Morris, 1999). However, there was no significant effect of infu-
sion on the percentage of time spent in the previous day’s zone
during trial 1 [(time in previous day’s zone/total time in all 8
zones) × 100%, mean + SEM: Saline, 25.3 + 3.0%; 75 ng picro-
toxin, 24.9 + 3.0%; 150 ng picrotoxin, 17.7 + 2.7%; F2,26 = 2.3,
P = 0.12). These data show that hippocampal picrotoxin did not
cause perseverative behavior on the watermaze test, consistent
with the 5-CSRT data not revealing any perseverative tenden-
cies (see Table 1). Hippocampal picrotoxin numerically reduced
the time spent in the previous day’s zone, mainly at the higher
dose. Although ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect of
infusion (see above), search preference in the previous day’s
zone was significantly above chance (12.5%) following hippo-
campal infusion of saline and 75 ng picrotoxin (both t13 > 4.2,
P < 0.001), indicating memory for the previous day’s location,
but only tended to be higher than chance following infusion of
150 ng (t13 = 1.9, P = 0.08). Overall, these data support that hip-
pocampal neural disinhibition does not markedly affect search
behavior during trial 1, although the data points to a slight
(nonsignificant) impairment in retrieval/expression of the place
memory acquired during the previous day’s 4 trials.
In Vivo Electrophysiology: Picrotoxin Enhances
Hippocampal Neuron Firing and Bursting
The most medial and/or the most lateral electrodes were located
outside of the hippocampus (typically 1–3 electrodes per rat).
The data from these electrodes, which were placed just outside
the medial or lateral boundaries of the hippocampus, were ana-
lyzed separately, providing a control measure for drug spread
out of the hippocampus. All other electrodes were placed within
the temporal to intermediate hippocampus (Fig. 5A).
At electrodes placed within the hippocampus, picrotoxin
(150 ng)
increased
the
overall
firing
rate
and
markedly
enhanced the occurrence of bursts and the proportion of spikes
fired as part of bursts, alongside a slight increase in burst dur-
ation, but without affecting within-burst firing rate (Fig. 5B).
Mean preinfusion baseline values of the electrophysiological
parameters analyzed did not differ between infusion groups
(Table 2). Overall firing rates were increased by picrotoxin, as
compared with saline, starting immediately after infusion, with
firing rates in both groups converging again about 30 min after
infusion
because
values
in
the
picrotoxin
group
peaked
between 10 and 25 min, while values in the saline group
showed an upward drift (possibly reflecting nonspecific infu-
sion effects or a baseline drift) between 15 and 25 min following
infusion (interaction infusion group × 5 min block: F17,221 = 1.85,
P = 0.02).
The most pronounced effects of picrotoxin on hippocampal
neuron firing were increases in the occurrence of bursts and in
the proportion of spikes fired as part of bursts. Picrotoxin mark-
edly increased bursts per minute, starting within 5 min and
peaking around 25–30 min after infusion before values con-
verged with the saline group again (interaction drug x 5 min
block: F17,221 = 2.05, P = 0.01). The percentage of spikes fired in
bursts was also markedly increased, following a similar time
course as bursts per minute (interaction infusion group × 5-min
block: F17,221 = 2.96, P < 0.001). Moreover, picrotoxin increased
burst duration, starting immediately after infusion and peaking
20–25 min later before values slowly returned to baseline (inter-
action infusion group × 5-min block: F17,221 = 3.42, P < 0.001).
Consistent
with
the
increased
burst
duration,
picrotoxin
decreased interburst intervals (interaction infusion group ×
block: F17,221 = 1.88, P = 0.02). Within-burst firing rate was not
affected by infusions (main effect or interaction involving infu-
sion group: F < 1.4, P > 0.4).
Consistent with the absence of behavioral seizure signs, LFP
recordings did not show characteristics of hippocampal sei-
zures that may result from convulsive doses of GABA-A antago-
nists, namely a fast sequence of so-called LFP “spikes” (sharp
negative LFP deflection) at a rate of 5–20 per second superim-
posed on spike-wave discharges (a high-amplitude sharp nega-
tive LFP deflection followed by a positive LFP wave) (Bragin

Figure 5. Picrotoxin increases overall firing rate and markedly enhances bursting within the hippocampus. (A) Placement of infusion-electrode array assembly: The
photograph on the left shows the assembly of infusion cannula and 8-microwire-electrode array used to measure effects of drug microinfusions on hippocampal
neural activity. The array was arranged perpendicular to the midline of the brain, with the infusion cannula located just posterior to the center of the array. The
photograph on the right shows an exemplar coronal section through the hippocampus with markings (highlighted by white arrow heads) from the most medial and
most lateral electrodes of the array. In this case, the 2 most laterally located electrodes were located outside of the hippocampus. Underneath the photographs, the
approximate locations of markings from the most medial (black dots) and most lateral (gray dots) electrodes for all rats included in the electrophysiological studies
are shown on coronal plates from Paxinos and Watson (1998), with numbers indicating distance from bregma in millimeters. Based on the locations of the markings,
the most medial and/or the most lateral electrodes, typically 1–3 electrodes per rat, were located outside the hippocampus in all rats. Data recorded from electrodes
placed outside hippocampus were analyzed separately from data recorded from the hippocampus, providing a control measure for drug spread outside the hippo-
campus. (B) Data recorded at electrodes placed within the hippocampus: Time courses of multiunit measures during baseline recordings and following infusion of
picrotoxin or saline. All values are normalized to baseline (average of the 6 baseline 5-min blocks) and are presented as means ± SEM. The stippled horizontal line
indicates baseline and the arrow indicates the time of infusion. (C) Data recorded at electrodes placed just outside hippocampus: Time courses of the multiunit mea-
sures (all values normalized to baseline, means ± SEM) that showed marked effects of picrotoxin infusion when recorded within hippocampus. Note absence of any
clear picrotoxin effect, supporting that drug spread was largely restricted to within the hippocampus.

 et al. 2009). Overall LFP power, measured as the AUC of PSD,
was not affected by picrotoxin (main effect: F1,13 < 1; interaction
infusion × 5-min block: F17,221 = 1.23; P = 0.24) (data not shown).
To support the spatial selectivity of the picrotoxin effects,
we analyzed the data recorded from electrodes placed just out-
side the medial or lateral boundaries of the hippocampus (i.e.,
in the surrounding thalamus or parahippocampal cortex). In
contrast to the marked picrotoxin-induced enhancement of
burst firing within the hippocampus, as reflected by significant
increases in “bursts per minute,” “percentage of spikes fired as
bursts,” and “burst duration,” concomitant with a significant
increase in overall firing rate (see above and Fig. 5B), picrotoxin
did not affect these parameters at the misplaced electrodes just
outside the hippocampus (all interactions and main effects
involving the factor infusion, P > 0.15) (Fig. 5C). There are lim-
itations to this analysis: 1) the number of misplaced electrodes
was small; 2) in one rat receiving picrotoxin infusion, the only
misplaced electrode was damaged, so that data of misplaced
electrodes were only available from n = 7 rats in the picrotoxin
group; 3) in some rats, none of the few misplaced electrodes
recorded any bursts during the baseline period, so that these
rats had to be excluded from the analysis of burst parameters
normalized to baseline, resulting in n = 5 in the picrotoxin and
n = 6 in the saline group; 4) electrodes were placed in 2 different
regions (thalamus or parahippocampal cortex). These factors
probably contributed to higher variability of the data recorded
from the misplaced electrodes. Nevertheless, the control data
from the misplaced electrodes support that picrotoxin effects
were largely restricted to the hippocampus. This is consistent
with autoradiographic studies showing that intrahippocam-
pally infused radiolabelled AP-5, even at the relatively high
infusion volume of 1 μL (in the present study, we used 0.5 μL),
does not substantially spread across the medial and lateral
boundaries of the hippocampus, probably because of the
densely packed fiber bundles surrounding the hippocampus
(Morris et al. 1989; Steele and Morris 1999).
Discussion
Hippocampal neural disinhibition by the GABA-A antagonist
picrotoxin impaired attention, without affecting other behav-
ioral measures, on the 5-CSRT test and caused deficits in rapid
place
learning
performance
on
the
watermaze
DMP
test.
Moreover,
hippocampal
disinhibition
moderately
increased
locomotor activity and slightly reduced startle reactivity, leav-
ing PPI unaffected. In vivo electrophysiological recordings
showed that picrotoxin mainly enhanced burst firing of hippo-
campal neurons.
Enhanced Burst Firing
Disinhibition by picrotoxin enhanced hippocampal burst firing
and concomitantly increased overall firing rate in acute in vivo
electrophysiological
experiments
under
anesthesia.
These
findings are consistent with the enhanced hippocampal burst
firing recently reported following pharmaco- or optogenetic
silencing
of
hippocampal
inhibitory
interneurons
in
vitro
(Lovett-Barron et al. 2012) and in awake mice (Royer et al. 2012),
and corroborate the important role of GABAergic inhibition in
hippocampal burst regulation. Aberrant burst firing may sub-
stantially interfere with cognitive functions of the hippocam-
pus and its projection sites, as burst firing has been implicated
in
the
encoding
and
readout
of
hippocampal
memory
(Takahashi and Magee 2009; Xu et al. 2012) and is particularly
effective in driving postsynaptic targets (Lisman 1997). Our
electrophysiological findings, in conjunction with our behav-
ioral findings, suggest that aberrant hippocampal burst firing
causes attentional and memory deficits.
Attentional Deficits
The selective attentional deficits on the 5-CSRT test, indicated
by reduced accuracy without changes in other performance
measures, probably reflect disruption of extrahippocampal pro-
cessing, most likely in prefrontal cortex or ventral striatum
through strong hippocampal functional connectivity to these
sites (Bast 2011). Previous lesion studies suggest that the hippo-
campus itself plays, if at all, only a minor role in mediating sus-
tained attention as measured on the 5-CSRT and related tests.
On the 5-CSRT test, temporal hippocampal lesions (made after
pretraining to criterion levels) mainly increased rats’ impul-
sive/premature responding, with little disruption of attentional
performance, possibly as a side effect of increased impulsive
responding, whereas septal (or dorsal) hippocampal lesions did
not substantially affect task performance (Abela et al. 2013).
Although one study reported persistent reductions in accuracy
on the 5-CSRT test following lesions to the temporal hippocam-
pus (made before pretraining), these were accompanied by
large increases in perseverative responding, with the number
of premature responses not reported (Le Pen et al. 2003).
Consistent with hippocampal lesions disrupting aspects of
inhibitory response control required on the 5-CSRT test, rather
than sustained attention, complete hippocampal lesions did
not affect attentional performance on a prefrontal-dependent
self-paced serial-reaction task requiring little impulse control
(Burk and Mair 2001). In contrast, sustained attention is highly
dependent on balanced prefrontal activity, with prefrontal
lesions (Chudasama and Robbins 2006), functional inhibition
(by the GABA-A agonist muscimol), or disinhibition (Pezze et al.
2014) all markedly disrupting attention on the 5-CSRT test.
Sustained attention on the 5-CSRT test also requires an optimal
level of prefrontal (Granon et al. 2000) and ventral striatal
(Pezze et al. 2007) dopamine receptor stimulation, which may
be disrupted by hippocampal neural disinhibition, given that
hippocampal stimulation activates the meso-prefrontal-ventral
striatal dopamine system (Mitchell et al. 2000; Floresco et al.
2001; Peleg-Raibstein et al. 2005; Bast 2011; Lodge and Grace
2011). Future studies will have to clarify the extrahippocampal,

 including prefrontal and ventral striatal, neural effects of hip-
pocampal disinhibition. The attentional deficits following hip-
pocampal neural disinhibition highlight that the cognitive
impact of regional neural disinhibition can extend beyond
functions normally depending on the disinhibited region (see
also Auger and Floresco 2015).
Contrasting with the selective reduction in accuracy follow-
ing hippocampal neural disinhibition in the present study,
attentional
deficits
on
the
5-CSRT
test
following
lesions
(Chudasama and Robbins 2006), as well as functional inhibition
or disinhibition (Pezze et al. 2014), of the medial prefrontal cor-
tex manifest as reduced accuracy alongside increased omis-
sions (additionally, lesions and functional inhibition affect
response control measures). However, experimental manipula-
tions primarily targeting the afferent modulation of the pre-
frontal cortex have been reported to cause selective reductions
in accuracy without increasing omissions, including selective
manipulations of the cholinergic (McGaughy et al. 2002) or
dopaminergic (Granon et al. 2000) modulation of the prefrontal
cortex. Selective reductions in accuracy, without increases in
omissions, have also been reported in the triple transgenic
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Romberg et al. 2011) and
the pilocarpine rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (Faure et al.
2014), where the primary pathology is not within the prefrontal
cortex, but in brain regions, including medial temporal lobe
regions, that may modulate the prefrontal cortex. It is entirely
consistent with these studies that hippocampal neural disin-
hibition, which increases hippocampal burst firing and, by way
of
hippocampo-prefrontal
functional
connectivity,
would
modulate prefrontal function, causes similar selective reduc-
tions in accuracy on the 5-CSRT task. Interestingly, both the
pilocarpine rat model (Kumar and Buckmaster 2006) and the
triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer‘s disease (Davis
et al. 2014) show hippocampal hyperexcitability; our new find-
ing that hippocampal neural disinhibition causes attentional
impairments suggests that hippocampal hyperexcitability may
contribute to the attentional deficits in these rodent models.
Memory Deficits
Hippocampal picrotoxin markedly disrupted rapid place learn-
ing performance on the watermaze DMP test, as reflected by a
marked reduction of search preference for the new location,
which rats had to learn within the first trial of the day. Previous
studies suggest that performance on the watermaze DMP test
depends on the hippocampus for the required rapid encoding
of new places and for the translation of such rapid spatial
updating into behavioral performance. The DMP test is dis-
rupted by pharmacological manipulations targeting synaptic
plasticity mechanisms mediated by NMDA (Steele and Morris
1999) and dopamine receptors (Pezze and Bast 2012) and by par-
tial hippocampal lesions, including lesions restricted to tem-
poral and intermediate hippocampus (Bast et al. 2009), which
were targeted by the infusions in the present study. Functional
inhibition targeting the intermediate hippocampus also dis-
rupts task performance (McGarrity et al. 2014). The requirement
of temporal to intermediate hippocampus probably reflects
that these regions feature functional connectivity to frontal
and subcortical sites necessary to translate hippocampal learn-
ing into performance, although the specific relevant brain sites
remain to be determined (Bast et al. 2009; Bast 2011). Therefore,
neural disinhibition, causing aberrant neuronal bursting, may
disrupt DMP performance by interfering with hippocampal
encoding or readout of relevant place information or with the
passing on of such information to hippocampal projection
sites.
Our
finding,
highlighting
the
importance
of
GABAergic
inhibition for hippocampus-dependent memory performance,
converges with recent studies in mice reporting learning-
related increase of hippocampal inhibitory synapses (Ruediger
et al. 2012) and impaired memory performance following dis-
ruption of hippocampal GABA neuron function by molecular-,
opto- or pharmacogenetic approaches (Prut et al. 2010; Murray
et al. 2011; Andrews-Zwilling et al. 2012; Caputi et al. 2012;
Donato et al. 2013; Gilani et al. 2014; Lovett-Barron et al. 2014;
Engin et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2016). Moreover, our findings support
recent studies in humans and rodent models linking hippo-
campal overactivity and hyperexcitability to age-related mem-
ory deficits (Koh et al. 2010; Bakker et al. 2012; Davis et al. 2014)
and are consistent with the correlation of hippocampal over-
activity with memory deficits in schizophrenia (Tregellas et al.
2014). However, hippocampal neural disinhibition may facili-
tate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and, thereby, improve
memory, if such disinhibition is finely and dynamically regu-
lated by endogenous plasticity (Donato et al. 2013) or if there is
a
pre-existing
deficit
due
to
increased
neural
inhibition
(Fernandez et al. 2007). Moreover, systemic injection of a select-
ive inverse agonist to negatively modulate GABA-A receptors
containing the α5 subunit, which are predominantly expressed
in hippocampus and constitute about 20% of hippocampal
GABA-A receptors, has been suggested to facilitate hippocam-
pal plasticity and memory (Dawson et al. 2006), although trans-
genic reduction of α5 subunit-containing GABA-A receptor
expression in the hippocampus has also been reported to dis-
rupt aspects of hippocampus-dependent memory (Prut et al.
2010; Engin et al. 2015). Interestingly, a recent study suggests
that enhancing the amplitude, but not duration, of synaptic
excitation within the prefrontal cortex (by optogenetic stimula-
tion of glutamatergic neurons or local infusion of a specific
AMPAkine) enhances prefrontal-dependent recognition mem-
ory (Benn et al. 2016). Similarly, the selective inverse agonist at
α5
subunit-containing
GABA
receptors
may
enhance
hippocampus-dependent memory by enhancing the amplitude
of hippocampal neural activity, while leaving the temporal pat-
tern of neural activity largely unaffected (this is consistent with
in vitro evoked potential findings that the drug enhances LTP
induction, without affecting stimulation-evoked field potential
bursting; Dawson et al. 2006). In contrast, hippocampal neural
disinhibition caused by picrotoxin in the present study altered
the temporal
organization
of hippocampal neural activity
(enhancing
burst-pattern
firing).
Overall,
hippocampus-
dependent memory performance appears to require hippocam-
pal neural activity that is appropriately balanced by GABAergic
inhibition, resembling the requirement of appropriately tuned
prefrontal activity for prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions
(Gruber et al. 2010; Pezze et al. 2014; Tse et al. 2015).
Sensorimotor Effects
Locomotor hyperactivity and reduced startle reactivity caused
by hippocampal picrotoxin in Lister hooded rats in the present
study replicate findings in Wistar rats (Bast et al. 2001a). These
moderate effects are unlikely to have interfered with perform-
ance on the cognitive tests, which is supported by normal
response and reward-collection latencies. Locomotor hyper-
activity is consistent with the idea that increased hippocampal
neuron activity drives the dopamine system and associated
behavioral
changes,

 (Mitchell et al. 2000; Floresco et al. 2001; Bast and Feldon 2003;
Bast 2011; Lodge and Grace 2011; Gilani et al. 2014).
Hippocampal picrotoxin did not affect PPI in Lister hooded
rats, contrasting with the marked PPI disruption in Wistar rats
(Bast et al. 2001a). Considered together with our recent finding
that prefrontal picrotoxin, which markedly disrupts PPI in
Sprague Dawley rats (Japha and Koch 1999), does not affect PPI
in Lister hooded rats (Pezze et al. 2014), this suggests that the
forebrain modulation of PPI is less pronounced in Lister hooded
than in other rat strains, adding to strain and species differ-
ences in PPI modulation (Swerdlow et al. 2008).
Cognitive and Behavioral Impact of Neural
Disinhibition: Comparison to Inactivation and Lesions
The findings that hippocampal neural disinhibition disrupted
hippocampus-dependent place learning performance on the
watermaze DMP task (similar to hippocampal lesions and
inactivation) and attentional performance on the 5-CSRT test
(similar to prefrontal lesion, inactivation and disinhibition)
supports the idea that hippocampal neural disinhibition, by
disrupting balanced neural activity locally within the hippo-
campus or distally within hippocampal projection sites, may
disrupt cognitive and behavioral functions depending on the
hippocampus and its projection sites, such as the medial pre-
frontal cortex (Bast 2011).
However, other hippocampus- and prefrontal-dependent
functions can be largely unaffected by hippocampal neural dis-
inhibition. In the present study, hippocampal neural disinhib-
ition did not affect response control on the 5-CSRT test (as
reflected by unchanged premature or perseverative responses),
which has been shown to be markedly disrupted by both pre-
frontal
and
hippocampal
lesions
and/or
inactivation
(Chudasama and Robbins 2006; Chudasama et al. 2012; Abela
et al. 2013; Pezze et al. 2014); similar to hippocampal neural dis-
inhibition,
prefrontal
disinhibition
also
does
not
affect
response control (Pezze et al. 2014). This suggests that response
control
requires
neural
activity
within
the
hippocampo-
prefrontal circuit, but not the appropriate tuning of such activ-
ity. In other words, response control can be sustained as long
as neural activity within the hippocampo-prefrontal circuit is
above a minimal level.
Moreover, neural disinhibition of the (temporal) hippocam-
pus (similar to direct chemical or electrical stimulation, see
Bast and Feldon, 2003) enhances locomotor activity (present
study; Bast et al. 2001a), which depends on neural activity
within the temporal hippocampus and is reduced by inactiva-
tion of this region (Bast et al. 2001b). Similarly, prefrontal
neural disinhibition increases, whereas prefrontal functional
inhibition decreases locomotor activity (Pezze et al. 2014).
These findings suggest that neural activity within hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex drives open-field locomotor activity, with
a monotonic positive relation between neural activity in these
areas and locomotion. These locomotor effects likely reflect a
positive modulation of ventral striatal dopamine transmission
by neural activity within the hippocampo-prefrontal circuit
(Karreman and Moghaddam 1996; Mitchell et al. 2000; Floresco
et al. 2001; Bast and Feldon 2003; Lodge and Grace 2011).
Overall, regional neural disinhibition can impact on cognitive
and behavioral functions mediated by the disinhibited region
and by distal brain sites with which the disinhibited region is
functionally connected. Depending on the specific hippocam-
pus- or prefrontal-dependent function, hippocampal neural dis-
inhibition may 1) have a disruptive effect (i.e., have similar
effects to hippocampal and/ or prefrontal lesions or inactiva-
tion), 2) have no effect, or 3) enhance the function (i.e., have
opposite effects to hippocampal or prefrontal inactivation or
lesion). These different effects suggest that different hippocam-
pus- and prefrontal-dependent functions show different rela-
tionships to neural activity within hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex. In addition, the impact of hippocampal neural disinhib-
ition
can
extend
beyond
hippocampus-
and
prefrontal-
dependent functions, reflecting, for example, hippocampal func-
tional links to subcortical sites (e.g., impact on subcortical dopa-
mine transmission that is thought to drive locomotor activity).
Clinical Relevance
Hippocampal GABA dysfunction has been implicated in schizo-
phrenia and age-related cognitive decline (Lisman et al. 2008;
Huang and Mucke 2012; Stanley et al. 2012; Heckers and
Konradi 2015; Nava-Mesa et al. 2014; Ruzicka et al. 2015). Given
the close link between neural activity and metabolic activation
(Sokoloff 1981), the enhanced hippocampal multiunit activity
caused by acute GABA antagonism is consistent with the hip-
pocampal metabolic overactivity characterizing early stages of
these disorders (Schobel et al. 2009; Bakker et al. 2012; Huang
and Mucke 2012). Compensatory adjustments and excitotoxi-
city associated with long-term GABA dysfunction and neural
overactivity may contribute to regional hypoactivity and atro-
phy characterizing later disease stages (Huang and Mucke 2012;
Schobel et al. 2013; Anticevic et al. 2015), aspects of these
chronic disorders not mimicked by acute GABA antagonism.
The 5-CSRT and DMP tests have high validity to measure
deficits in attention and memory relevant to clinical disorders,
with related human paradigms—continuous performance tests
and place learning tests in analogs of the watermaze, respect-
ively—revealing marked deficits in schizophrenia and age-
related cognitive decline (Chudasama and Robbins 2006; Hort
et al. 2007; Lustig et al. 2013; Romberg et al. 2013; Fajnerova
et al. 2014). Our present findings in rats suggest that hippocam-
pal neural disinhibition contributes to clinically relevant atten-
tional and memory deficits. Furthermore, they support that
causal relationships underly the recently reported correlations
of hippocampal overactivity with both memory and attentional
deficits in schizophrenia patients (Tregellas et al. 2014) and the
association of hippocampal overactivity with memory deficits
in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (Bakker et al., 2012).
Conclusions
Hippocampal neural disinhibition causes dysregulation of local
neuron firing characterized by enhanced bursting, which would
be expected to disrupt hippocampal processing and cause aber-
rant drive to hippocampal projection sites. Consistently, hippo-
campal disinhibition disrupts hippocampus-dependent rapid
place learning performance, as well as aspects of attentional
performance that do not normally require the hippocampus,
but are mediated by prefrontal-striatal mechanisms. The latter
supports that hippocampal dysfunction may partly manifest
through deficits in prefrontal-dependent function, consistent
with
strong
hippocampo-prefrontal
functional
connectivity
(Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2005; Bast 2011). The attentional and
memory deficits caused by hippocampal neural disinhibition,
together with findings that prefrontal-cortical disinhibition dis-
rupts attentional and executive functions (Gruber et al. 2010;
Enomoto et al. 2011; Paine et al. 2011, 2015; Pehrson et al. 2013;

 cortico-hippocampal GABAergic inhibition for cognitive func-
tion. This supports that cortico-hippocampal neural disinhib-
ition, which is a key feature of schizophrenia (Lisman et al.
2008; Heckers and Konradi 2015; Tse et al. 2015) and has been
implicated in other disorders, most notably age-related cogni-
tive decline (Huang and Mucke 2012; Stanley et al. 2012; Nava-
Mesa et al. 2014), contributes to causing key cognitive deficits
characterizing these disorders and, hence, is an important
treatment target.
