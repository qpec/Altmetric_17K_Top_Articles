abstract
Children whose parents or caregivers use drugs or alcohol are at increased 
risk of short- and long-term sequelae ranging from medical problems to 
psychosocial and behavioral challenges. In the course of providing health 
care services to children, pediatricians are likely to encounter families 
affected by parental substance use and are in a unique position to intervene. 
Therefore, pediatricians need to know how to assess a child’s risk in the 
context of a parent’s substance use. The purposes of this clinical report 
are to review some of the short-term effects of maternal substance use 
during pregnancy and long-term implications of fetal exposure; describe 
typical medical, psychiatric, and behavioral symptoms of children and 
adolescents in families affected by substance use; and suggest profi
 ciencies 
for pediatricians involved in the care of children and adolescents of families 
affected by substance use, including screening families, mandated reporting 
requirements, and directing families to community, regional, and state 
resources that can address needs and problems.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
In the course of providing health care services to children, pediatricians 
often encounter families affected by substance use, distribution, 
manufacturing, or cultivation that ultimately places parents and their 
children at risk. Substance use can include illicit substances such as 
marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine (eg, crystal meth), 
as well as misuse of alcohol and prescription medications. As defined by 
the National Alliance for Drug Endangered Children, drug-endangered 
children are those who are at risk for suffering physical or emotional 
harm as a result of their caregiver’s substance use, possession, 
manufacturing, cultivation, or distribution. 
1, 
 
2 Children also may be 
endangered when parents’ substance use interferes with their ability 
to raise their children and provide a safe, nurturing environment. 
1 
Parents’ substance use may affect their ability to consistently prioritize 
the child’s basic physical and emotional needs over their own need for 
substances. Cigarette smoking often accompanies substance use and can

pose additional hazards to children 
(www2. 
aap. 
org/ 
richmondcenter). 
Furthermore, the home environment 
may be unsanitary or unsafe, 
particularly if illegal or legal drugs, 
chemicals, or paraphernalia are 
accessible or if drugs are being 
cultivated or manufactured in the 
home. Such conditions can lead to 
poor child health and developmental 
outcomes or child maltreatment and 
even child death.
Children exposed to a parent’s 
substance use commonly experience 
educational delays and inadequate 
medical and dental care. 
3 Almost 
a quarter of children of mothers 
with identified substance use 
disorders (SUDs) do not receive 
routine child health maintenance 
services in their first 2 years of life. 
3 
Children of parents with SUDs are 
also at greater risk of later mental 
health and behavioral problems, 
including SUDs. 
4, 
 
5 Pediatricians 
have an opportunity to help break 
multigenerational cycles of child 
abuse and neglect and substance use 
by being informed about the effects 
of parental substance use on children, 
intervening when necessary, and 
collaborating with the family, 
other health care providers, and 
appropriate government agencies to 
address the issues involved.
Pediatricians are in a unique position 
to identify and assess a child’s 
risk in the context of a parent’s 
SUD and intervene to protect the 
child. Research has shown that a 
majority of parents are accepting 
of their child’s pediatrician asking 
them about their own substance 
use. 
6 Pediatricians can include 
questions about the extent of family 
substance use as part of the routine 
family assessment during health 
supervision visits or when clinically 
indicated. 
7 Given the risks to health 
and development, children in families 
with known or suspected parental 
SUDs may warrant more frequent 
appointments with their pediatrician 
for close medical follow-up or 
developmental evaluation. For 
example, children may have their 
ears examined for chronic otitis 
media because of greater exposure 
to smoke or large breathable 
particulates in their homes or for 
more frequent developmental 
assessments, given risks of emotional 
and behavioral disorders, delays 
in expressive language, and mental 
illness.
Pediatricians who help identify 
substance use problems in a child’s 
family members are not expected 
to solve, manage, or treat these 
problems; rather, they can assist 
families by working in partnership 
with other professionals to provide 
access to state, regional, and local 
resources available to families. 
Being familiar with effective harm 
reduction strategies and being 
prepared to inform public debate 
on how to use evidence-based 
strategies to protect and advocate 
for children whose parents have 
SUDs are important roles that 
the pediatrician can assume. In 
addition, medical professionals are 
mandatory reporters of suspected 
child maltreatment and may be the 
only professionals who have the 
opportunity to recognize that a child, 
especially one of preschool age, has 
been abused or neglected.
The purposes of this clinical report 
are to review some of the short-
term effects of maternal substance 
use during pregnancy and long-
term implications of fetal exposure; 
describe typical medical, psychiatric, 
and behavioral symptoms of children 
and adolescents in families affected 
by substance use; and suggest 
proficiencies for pediatricians 
involved in the care of children and 
adolescents of families affected by 
substance use, including screening 
families, mandated reporting 
requirements, and directing families 
to community, regional, or state 
resources that can address needs 
and problems. Throughout this 
report, the term parent is used, but 
the discussion could apply to any 
primary adult who cares for a child, 
including guardians, grandparents, 
and foster parents.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SUBSTANCE USE IN 
THE UNITED STATES
A 2013 national government survey 
on drug use and health reported that 
more than 9.4% of the US population 
12 years and older uses psychoactive 
substances. 
8 In 2013, an estimated 
24.6 million Americans 12 years or 
older had used an illicit substance 
in the 30 days before the survey. 
8 
The total annual societal cost of 
substance use in terms of lost goods, 
lost productivity, treatment, and 
medical services in the United States 
is estimated to be $510.8 billion. 
9 
This estimate includes costs related 
to alcohol and drug treatment and 
prevention services; substance 
use–related medical condition 
management and sequelae; lost 
earnings attributable to premature 
death, substance use–related illness, 
and loss of employment; goods and 
services associated with substance 
use–related crime, criminal justice, 
motor vehicle crashes, property 
damage, and fires; and police, fire 
department, adjudication, and 
sanctioning expenses. 
9
Exposure to substances begins 
prenatally for many infants. 
Specifically, a study by Patrick et al 
10 
of a nationally representative sample 
of infants demonstrated that in 2012, 
approximately 22 000 infants were 
diagnosed with neonatal abstinence 
syndrome. Neonatal abstinence 
syndrome includes a combination 
of physiologic and neurobehavioral 
signs that include such things as 
sweating, irritability, increased 
muscle tone and activity, feeding 
problems, diarrhea, and seizures and 
is the result of prenatal exposure 
to opioids followed by withdrawal 
at birth. 
11 This problem persists, 
as evidenced by a recent study that 
showed among 112 029 pregnant

women, 31 354 (28.0%) were 
prescribed at least 1 opioid pain 
reliever during pregnancy. 
12
It is estimated that 1 in 5 children 
grows up in a home in which 
someone uses drugs or misuses 
alcohol. 
7 The exact number of 
children living with adults with SUDs 
is unknown 
13; however, an estimated 
8.3 million children younger than 
18 years (12%) were residing with 
at least 1 substance-dependent or 
substance-using parent between 
2002 and 2007.

IMPLICATIONS OF FETAL EXPOSURE 
SECONDARY TO MATERNAL SUBSTANCE 
USE
Detailed discussions of short- and 
long-term effects of prenatal 
substance use on the exposed fetus 
are available elsewhere. 
11, 
 
15 
– 
17 A 
brief description follows (Table 1).
Short-term Medical Effects of Fetal 
Exposure
The detrimental effects of fetal 
exposure to alcohol are well 
documented. 
11, 
 
15, 
 
17 Fetal alcohol 
spectrum disorders, fetal alcohol 
effects, prenatal complications (eg, 
prematurity, low birth weight), and 
prolonged postnatal hospitalization 
all are associated with alcohol use 
during the prenatal period, but a full 
review is beyond the scope of this 
report.
Because there is passive diffusion 
across the placenta of substances 
smaller than 500 dalton (d), 
most illicit and some other 
substances used by a pregnant 
woman will directly affect the 
fetus (eg, methamphetamine = 
149 d, buprenorphine = 467 d, 
tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] = 314 d). 
18 
Exposure to substances during the 
first trimester can affect the structure 
of the developing fetal brain, and 
exposure during the second and 
third trimesters may affect brain 
function. 
18 Marijuana crosses the 
placenta, and its psychoactive 
constituents are fat soluble and can 
bind to cannabinoid receptors in 
the fetal brain. 
19 Newborn infants 
can have small-for-gestational-
age head circumference after 
prenatal exposure to cannabis. 
19 
Fetal exposure to cannabis has 
been associated with subtle 
neurobehavioral disturbances (ie, 
exaggerated and prolonged startle 
reflexes and increased hand–mouth 
behavior), high-pitched cries, and 
sleep cycle disturbances with 
electroencephalographic changes in 
the newborn period.11, 
 
19 Repeated 
fetal exposure to cannabis disrupts 
endocannabinoid signaling, 
particularly the temporal dynamics 
of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, 
and alters fetal cortical circuitry 
development. 
16 Interference with the 
endocannabinoid system disrupts 
normal neurobiological development, 
particularly of neurotransmitter 
maturation and neuronal survival. 
19
Effects of fetal cocaine and opioid 
exposure may appear during the 
newborn period as any of the 
following symptoms of withdrawal: 
irritability, poor and irregular 
feeding patterns, frequent crying, 
tremulousness, increased respiratory 
and heart rates, hypertonia, an 
exaggerated startle response, 
vomiting, frantic sucking, and 
difficulty being consoled. 
6, 
 
11 
Prenatal cocaine exposure can have 
effects on neurobehavior, which 
may manifest clinically as lability 
of state, decreased behavioral 
and autonomic regulation, and 
poor alertness and orientation. 
11 
Prenatal cocaine exposure also may 
hinder fetal growth. 
11 Similarly, 
prenatal methamphetamine 
exposure can inhibit fetal growth 
and alter neurobehavior (ie, poor 
movement quality, decreased 
arousal, and increased stress).11 
Prenatal buprenorphine exposure 
causes fewer withdrawal symptoms 
and, similar to methadone, has a 
longer duration of action than other 
opioids. 
20 
Long-term Medical Effects of Fetal 
Exposure
Children with prenatal drug 
exposure are more likely to develop 
disruptive behavioral disorders 
such as oppositional defiant 
disorder; impaired intellectual and 
academic achievement; and cognitive 
problems, such as delayed language 
development, poor memory, and the 
inability to learn from mistakes. 
2, 
 
6 
Children who were exposed to drugs 
prenatally also have a higher risk of 
developing an SUD. 
2, 
 
6 Prenatal drug 
exposure is associated with increased 
rates of anxiety and mood disorders, 
lower self-esteem, and perceived lack 
of control over their environment.6
Fetal alcohol exposure continues to 
affect growth, cognition, behavior, 
language, and achievement 
throughout life. 
11, 
 
17 Children exposed 
in utero to cannabis may have a 
small-for-age head circumference 
well into their teenage years and

permanent neurobehavioral, 
cognitive, and intellectual deficits 
that vary depending on the timing 
and degree of in utero exposure. 
16, 
 
19 
Specifically, heavy use (defined as 
more than 1 joint, or approximately 
10 mg of THC, per day) during the 
first trimester has been associated 
with lower verbal reasoning skills in 
the child, whereas second trimester 
use was associated with impairments 
of the child’s composite short-
term memory.19 Children exposed 
prenatally to heavy amounts of 
cannabis often struggle with tasks 
requiring visual memory, analysis, 
and integration; acquire language 
skills slowly; show increased levels 
of aggression; and display poor 
attention span. 
19
Mothers who have heroin addiction 
or are receiving medication-
assisted treatment with methadone 
may have infants who exhibit 
increased activity as well as poorer 
coordination during childhood than 
children of similar age without 
prenatal opioid exposure. 
4 Children 
with prenatal heroin exposure 
have more behavioral problems 
(including hyperactivity, brief 
attention span, sleep disturbance, 
and temper outbursts) at 12 to 24 
months of age; language delay at 24 
to 32 months of age; and, overall, 
more difficulties learning when 
compared with their age-matched 
peers. 
4 Similarly, children of mothers 
treated prenatally with methadone 
maintenance are more impulsive, 
immature, and irresponsible than 
their unexposed peers and also 
perform poorly on intelligence tests 
at 3 to 7 years of age. 
4 Information 
about the long-term developmental 
outcomes of prenatal buprenorphine 
exposure is limited, and many of the 
reports have conflicting findings. 
20 
Several studies have found that 
children with fetal exposure to 
prescribed buprenorphine score 
lower on Bayley cognitive and 
language scales compared with 
children who were not exposed 
prenatally.20 There is also some 
evidence of decreased myelination 
and disrupted striatal cholinergic 
activity in children of women who 
received buprenorphine during 
pregnancy. 
20 Prenatal exposure 
to cocaine may result in behavior, 
cognition, and language deficits 
in children. 
11 Children who were 
exposed to crystal methamphetamine 
prenatally may have developmental 
delays in communication, personal 
and social skills, fine and gross motor 
skills, and problem-solving skills 
as well as aggressive or withdrawn 
behaviors. 
21
PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACT OF LIVING 
IN A FAMILY AFFECTED BY PARENTAL 
SUBSTANCE USE
Parental substance use is associated 
with myriad family and social 
problems. 
22 
 
 
– 
27 Whether secondary 
to inconsistency in parenting, 
disruption or lack of healthy family 
routines and rituals, or parental 
conflict and stress, children of 
substance-using parents 
typically are denied the security 
that is associated with structure and 
stability provided by appropriate 
parenting. The parent’s SUD and the 
violent and erratic behavior that 
may be associated place the child 
at higher risk of being abused or 
neglected ( 
Tables 2 and  
3). 
21, 
28 
 
– 
31 
Children whose parents use 
substances and misuse alcohol are 
3 times as likely to be physically, 
emotionally, or sexually abused and 
4 times as likely to be emotionally 
or physically neglected. 
21, 
32 Higher 
rates of neglect have been noted in 
rural populations. 
33 The neonatal 
period, when infants are the most 
vulnerable, is the period of highest 
risk of harm. 
32 Parenting impairment 
varies to different degrees depending 
on which substances parents use. 
34 
Mandatory involvement of child 
protective services helps ensure a 
child’s safety but may result in the 
child being placed in an alternate 
living situation with a relative 
(ie, kinship care) or unrelated 
caregiver. 
35 Nonetheless, transition 
into foster care may be necessary to 
protect a child’s physical safety.
The home environment may lack 
appropriate childproofing safety 
measures because of transience of 
housing and parents being distracted 
by substance use or alcohol misuse. 
The use of open flames or lighters 
for the consumption or production 
of drugs may increase the dangers of 
accidental burns, fires, and explosions 
where children live. Children are at 
increased risk of acquiring infectious 
diseases because of exposure to 
needles and drug paraphernalia. 
21 
Because of the significant cost of 
illicit substance use, household funds 
may be more limited, and parents 
with an SUD may struggle to meet 
their household financial demands. 
3 
Homes used to produce crystal 
methamphetamine may be unsafe and 
uninhabitable because of the presence

General Warning Signs for Child Abuse
Frequent injuries, bruising, welts, or burns that cannot be suffi
 ciently explained (eg, cigarette burns, 
bruises on the face, lips, and mouth or on several surface planes at the same time).
Withdrawn, fearful, or extreme behavior.
Clusters of bruises, welts, or burns, indicating repeated contact with a hand or instrument.
Injuries appear to have a pattern (eg, straight lines or circles) such as marks from a hand, belt, or

Any bruise without a plausible explanation in an infant who is not yet cruising is suspicious for abuse.
Unusual injuries on children where children do not usually get injured (eg, the torso, back, neck, 
buttocks, or thighs).

of toxic ingredients and byproducts, 
including mercury, lead, and other 
large breathable particulates that settle 
close to the floor. 
21 Home production 
of butane-extracted cannabis may 
lead to explosions or house fires. 
Children living in these chaotic home 
environments may be at risk for having 
contact with people in their house 
using or buying drugs; witnessing 
criminal behavior and interacting 
with criminals; ingesting or inhaling 
drugs or chemicals; being exposed to 
deplorable living conditions, including 
human waste, vermin, insects, clutter, 
garbage, and filth; and being subjected 
to sexual abuse and trafficking.
Because of potential for abuse, 
neglect, and a hazardous home 
environment, children whose parents 
have SUDs tend to come to the 
attention of child welfare agencies 
at a younger age than other children 
and are more likely than other 
children to be placed and remain in 
foster care. 
36 Many families receiving 
child welfare services are affected by 
parental substance use. 
37 
– 
39 The US 
Department of Health and Human 
Services concluded that parental 
substance abuse is a contributing 
factor for one-third to two-thirds of 
children being involved with the child 
welfare system.37 This estimate is 
based on very old data, and as noted 
by a recent review, parental SUD 
prevalence rates based on these older 
data may no longer be representative 
of current trends, but more current 
data are lacking. 
38
Despite early maternal intentions 
and supportive interventions, 27% of 
children born to women with significant 
SUDs needed the involvement of 
child protective services during the 
preschool years. 
40 An estimated 20% 
of substantiated cases of child abuse 
or neglect were associated with an 
SUD in the caregiver, and nearly 10% 
involved a caregiver with an alcohol use 
disorder. 
41
Although the link between child abuse 
and neglect and substance use is well 
documented, it is not necessarily a 
direct causal relationship, because 
a significant portion of adults 
with SUDs also have concurrent 
mental illness, including anxiety, 
depression, and posttraumatic stress 
disorder. 
32 Parents with SUDs often 
experience financial instability, food 
and housing insecurity, a chaotic 
living environment, inconsistent 
employment, domestic violence, social 
stigma or isolation, incarceration, 
and stress. 
3, 
 
32 Parental substance 
use has been linked with negative 
parental behaviors that include 
lower levels of parental involvement, 
limited or absent parental monitoring, 
ineffective control of children’s 
behaviors, and poor discipline skills 
including use of coercive control, 
harsh discipline, and failure to follow 
through. 
42 Collectively, these factors 
all contribute to substance use 
and child mistreatment. Any single 
factor, such as prenatal substance 
exposure, may be less salient to the 
overall developmental outcome of 
these children than the cumulative 
effects of exposure in the context of 
multiple home environmental and 
circumstance risks.
MEDICAL, PSYCHIATRIC, AND 
BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS OF CHILDREN 
AND ADOLESCENTS IN FAMILIES 
AFFECTED BY PARENTAL SUBSTANCE 
USE
Children and adolescents of 
parents with SUDs are at greater 
risk of having problems ranging 
from serious medical conditions 
to psychobehavioral difficulties. 
Compared with their peers whose 
parents do not have SUDs, they 
are twice as likely to sustain 
serious injuries, increasing the 
risks of missed time from school, 
hospitalization, or surgical 
treatment. 
43 
 
 
–47 A recent study found 
that 23% of children whose mothers 
were substance users were not 
engaged with routine child health 
services at any point during the first 
2 years of life. 
3 Mothers of drug-
exposed newborn infants may be ill 
equipped to cope with their infants’ 
health care needs. 
6 Youth whose 
parents have SUDs are more likely 
to be neglected, and chronic neglect 
has more long-term implications 
for a child’s mental health and 
development than do abuse and 
other forms of maltreatment. 
48
Mental health problems experienced 
by children of parents with SUDs 
can include anxiety disorders, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, depression, oppositional 
defiant disorder, conduct disorder, 
truancy, and trauma and stress-
related disorders. 
49, 
 
50 It has been 
noted recently that among children 
whose parents have SUDs, children 
in rural populations have a greater 
risk of mental health problems. 
33 
Adverse childhood experiences 
include abuse (eg, emotional, 
physical, or sexual), neglect

(eg, emotional or physical), and 
household dysfunction (eg, substance 
abuse, mental illness, intimate 
partner violence, incarceration, or 
separation or divorce), and these 
events may exceed the child’s coping 
mechanisms, resulting in permanent 
changes in the developing brain. 
51, 
52 
These brain changes can manifest 
as behavior problems, violence, and 
substance use health risk behaviors 
by the child through the life span. 
52
Educational problems are especially 
common in children exposed to 
substance use. 
53 These educational 
problems may be secondary to 
baseline cognitive limitations as 
a result of perinatal substance 
exposure or external distraction from 
a chaotic and unstructured home 
environment. Children affected by 
parental substance use may have a 
high absenteeism rate and impaired 
attention, compromising their 
academic productivity. Behavior 
problems place children at greater 
risk of suspension or expulsion from 
school.
Children are often distressed by their 
parents’ substance use. 
54 Children 
may blame themselves for the parents’ 
behavior and may feel responsible 
for its cure. Children’s prolonged 
exposure to inappropriate modeling 
of substance use increases their 
vulnerability to future substance 
use. 
55 Children of alcoholics are nearly 
4 times more likely to have an alcohol 
use disorder, with rates of hazardous 
use starting in the adolescent years 
and continuing into adulthood.

METHODS TO ASSESS AND ENGAGE 
THE FAMILY AFFECTED BY PARENTAL 
SUBSTANCE USE
Pediatricians have a unique 
opportunity to identify and engage 
families affected by substance use. 
The opportunities for pediatricians 
to engage with a family begin with 
the transition of the mother from 
prenatal care to delivery of an 
infant. If the mother and family 
interact with a health care provider 
who demonstrates empathy and 
knowledge regarding the effects of 
prenatal substance use, the process of 
engagement has a better start. Many 
times, the likelihood of engagement 
depends on the confidence the family 
has that the health care providers 
meeting them at the intense period 
of birth will continue comprehensive 
care and that their issues will be 
incorporated into a care plan.
As an approach to engaging families, 
pediatricians may want to first ask 
about subjects remote from the 
substance use issue. Inquiring about 
other topics such as, “Do you have 
any medical problems? Are there 
any mental health problems such 
as depression or anxiety disorders 
in the family?” before moving to 
questions like, “Do you or anyone in 
your home smoke? Do you or anyone 
in your home drink alcohol? Do you 
or anyone in your home use drugs?” 
may be better received by parents, 
because it allows the provider to 
establish an initial rapport with 
parents around portions of their 
health that may be perceived as less 
threatening.
In the nursery setting, a new mother 
typically has a great interest in 
discussing all health issues that might 
affect her infant. Taking a history that 
includes questions such as, “Before 
you knew you were pregnant, how 
would you describe your use of 
alcohol?” and then asking, “After you 
knew of your pregnancy, how would 
you describe your use of alcohol?” 
allows the mother to discuss the 
changes she attempted and provides 
information to the pediatrician about 
either assisted or self-initiated harm 
reduction. Similarly, inquiring about 
tobacco, prescription medications 
with attention to opioids and 
sedative hypnotics, marijuana, 
cocaine, methamphetamine, and 
heroin could be included.
In the office setting, during the 
newborn period and first months 
of contact, pediatricians generally 
ask about feeding methods. 
Providing information to a mother 
with a history of substance use 
about possible transmission of 
substances, including ethanol, into 
human milk may open the door to 
a deeper discussion of the mother’s 
substance use. Medically prescribed 
buprenorphine or methadone is not 
a contraindication to breastfeeding. 
Recommendations regarding 
the support of breastfeeding and 
potential effects on the newborn 
brain from passage of these 
substances warrant additional 
investigation and consensus. 
59
In a perfect health care system, 
the mother’s health history would 
include sequential screening for 
alcohol, tobacco, and substance 
use throughout the pregnancy, 
and obstetric providers would 
communicate concerns to the 
pediatric team caring for the 
infant. With potentially concerning 
information, the discharging 
medical team might offer the mother 
resources to support her intentions 
of becoming a good parent for the 
infant with substance exposure. 
Those services might include home 
visiting, direction to home- and 
community-based services such as 
those that exist in Indian Health 
Service units, insurance company 
case managers, specialized clinics, 
developmental follow-up, and 
primary care settings that embrace 
the care of mothers with SUDs and 
infants with prenatal exposure.
Incorporating a short screening 
tool and directing parents who 
screen positive back to either their 
own primary care physician or a 
specialist is a practical approach. 
Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health 
Supervision of Infants, Children, 
and Adolescents 
60 recommends 
developmental screening by a 
standardized instrument, such as 
the Ages & Stages Questionnaires, 
Third Edition (ASQ-3), matched 
with the clinical examination,

, number

to assess developmental delays 
possibly related to prenatal 
substance exposure or neglect 
of the child’s nutrition and 
socioemotional needs. 
61 For example, 
reports by parents of advanced 
communicative development 
may not be substantiated by 
verbal communication or capacity 
noted during the examination. 
In addition, attention to growth 
trends, particularly weight patterns, 
provides important information 
in early infancy about adequacy of 
feeding, particularly if the mother 
has initiated breastfeeding. Between 
9 and 24 months of age, deceleration 
of weight gain can indicate family 
system stresses and inattention to 
the child’s feeding in the home.
Some pediatricians can feel 
overwhelmed by what they perceive 
as their inability to screen parents 
and react to a positive screen 
successfully during a 15-minute 
appointment. To help, some 
brief screening questions could 
be incorporated into a routine 
health surveillance office visit. The 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism recommends the 
use of a single screening question 
to accurately identify unhealthy 
alcohol use. The question, “How 
many times in the past year have 
you had X or more drinks in a day?” 
(in which X is 5 for men and 4 for 
women, and a response of >1 is 
considered positive) has shown 
good sensitivity and specificity for 
detection of unhealthy alcohol use 
in a primary care population. 
62 The 
National Institute on Drug Abuse 
(NIDA) has a single-question drug 
screen: “How many times in the past 
year have you used an illegal drug 
or used a prescription medication 
for nonmedical reasons?” 
63 If the 
answer is “Never” for all drugs, NIDA 
recommends that the physician 
reinforce abstinence. However, if 
the answer is for any use of illegal or 
prescription drugs for nonmedical 
reasons, the parent needs to be 
screened by a more comprehensive 
substance use instrument, probably 
by his or her primary care physician.
Once a parent has screened positive, 
a provider may use the time as a 
teaching moment to engage the 
parent, explain the results, express 
concern, provide a more structured 
brief intervention incorporating 
nonjudgmental, motivational 
interviewing-informed interactions, 
and suggest a more complete 
evaluation by the parent’s primary 
care physician. If the results of a 
screen are positive and the parent 
would like more information about 
treatment locations, the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration has a searchable 
database of treatment locations 
throughout the United States (http:// 
findtreatment. 
samhsa. 
gov).
As a reference, several short tools 
are available to screen for substance 
use by family members. The Alcohol 
Use Disorders Identification Test 
Consumption questions for alcohol 
and the Drug Abuse Screening Test 
for drugs are 2 tools that are short 
but garner vital information. 
64 
– 
66 
NIDA also provides a resource 
guide for substance use screening 
in the general medical setting that 
includes sample scripts. 
63 As with 
the single-question screening tools, 
pediatricians using the short tools 
to screen need to be prepared to 
direct parents who screen positive 
to their primary care physician or 
another specialty provider for a more 
standardized brief intervention.
It is difficult to anticipate a parent’s 
reaction to a discussion about 
their substance use. Therefore, 
providers are encouraged to secure 
a supportive and safe environment 
for the conversation to occur. When 
engaging in the conversation, a 
nonjudgmental, nonaccusatory 
tone will help to convey to parents 
the pediatrician’s concern for them 
and their child. Objectively sharing 
the facts of the screen results and 
other observations will decrease 
the opportunity for disagreement. 
Parents can be directed back 
to their primary care physician 
for management and services. 
Pediatricians may find it efficient to 
have a prepared list of community, 
regional, state, and national 
resources from which to choose and 
to offer to parents. Likewise, options 
for adult primary care physicians 
can be helpful for parents without an 
established medical home.
Parent screening for medical, 
psychiatric, psychosocial, and 
substance use disorders can help 
identify problems. If present, possible 
signs and symptoms associated with 
acute substance intoxication (eg, 
pinpoint pupils, frequent yawning, 
slurred speech, excessive attention 
to external stimuli, ataxic gait, or 
incoherent thought patterns) can 
be objectively documented in the 
child’s medical record. Office staff 
could be encouraged to report any 
of these signs or symptoms to the 
pediatrician. 
67 Additional guidance 
on dealing with the judgment-
impaired parent in the pediatric 
office can be found in another 
clinical report from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics. 
13 Indications 
of abuse or neglect would require 
a mandatory report to the child 
protective services agency.
Research has shown that parents 
who screened positive for substance 
use were open to the pediatrician 
discussing their use with them 
and presenting the parents with 
follow-up options. 
67 With supportive 
care, parents often are willing to 
enter drug treatment or engage in 
harm reduction on behalf of their 
children. Even when parents do not 
go to treatment, they may reduce 
use of the substances that they 
view as more threatening, such as 
methamphetamine, but increase 
marijuana or tobacco use. Parents 
may also decrease their substance 
use even if they do not completely 
abstain. Therefore, pediatricians 
can feel empowered to address 
e7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
these topics when speaking with the 
parent.
In addition to screening of parents, 
a careful physical examination of 
the child should be performed in all 
situations in which abuse or neglect 
is suspected, because important 
cutaneous findings can be concealed 
easily by clothing ( 
Tables 2 and 
 
3). Although skin findings alone 
are not specific for maltreatment, 
their presence and the particular 
characteristics of findings, such 
as bruises, lacerations, abrasions, 
burns or thermal injuries, and bite 
marks, could raise suspicion for 
abuse. Any bruise without a plausible 
explanation or a skeletal injury in 
an infant who is not yet cruising can 
raise suspicion for abuse. 
68 Bruises 
are common on young ambulatory 
children, with the most common 
sites being the anterior tibia or 
knee, forehead, scalp, and upper 
leg (ie, anterior surfaces and bony 
prominences). It is far less common 
for children to have bruising over 
posterior surfaces, the chest, the face 
(except for forehead), the buttocks, 
or hands. 
68, 
69 Bruising in these areas 
as well as protected areas, such as 
the abdomen, genitalia, and ears, in 
infants and toddlers, although still 
nonspecific, is suspicious for inflicted 
trauma. 
68 
– 
70 Patterned bruises might 
suggest a device or implement was 
used to cause the injury. Children 
struck with linear objects (eg, rods, 
rulers, belts) may present with linear 
configured scars. Likewise, flexible 
implements that are doubled over 
(eg, ropes, cords, chains) can leave 
a loop-configured bruise, abrasion, 
or scar at the site of contact. Slap 
marks may appear as a negative 
image such that an outline of the 
handprint is created on the skin 
as a result of blood extravasation 
from vessels into the surrounding 
interstitial space. Binding devices (eg, 
wires, ropes, cords) may manifest as 
circumferentially configured bruises, 
lacerations, or abrasions involving 
the neck, wrists, ankles, or oral 
commissure. The combined presence 
of patterned cutaneous or skeletal 
injury appearing over unusual 
locations (eg, posterior surfaces, 
soft tissues, genitalia) may indicate 
additional inquiry or investigation 
to establish or allay suspicions of 
possible physical abuse and/or an 
underlying medical condition. 
71, 
72 
Similarly, any abnormality noted on 
physical examination of the genitals 
or anal area that is consistent with 
trauma may indicate additional 
inquiry to allay suspicion for 
possible sexual abuse. 
73 However, 
in all states, suspected child abuse 
or neglect requires the filing of a 
mandated report with the state child 
protective services agency. All health 
care professionals need to become 
familiar with the specific reporting 
laws governing their state and know 
what exactly to report.
When a mandatory report to child 
protective services is necessary, 
health care professionals can engage 
the families in this process with 
a transparent and caring direct 
approach. To set the stage for a 
transparent interaction up front, a 
health care professional can discuss 
all of the following: the risks to and 
effects on children related to parental 
substance abuse, the requirements 
for mandated reporting to child 
protective services, the resources and 
services available to the family, and 
how child welfare can be a support to 
the family.
SUGGESTED PROFICIENCIES FOR 
PEDIATRICIANS INVOLVED IN THE CARE 
OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS OF 
FAMILIES AFFECTED BY SUBSTANCE 
USE
In 1999, Adger et al 
74 defined 
potential levels of proficiencies for 
pediatricians that varied depending 
on their experience with substance 
use treatment. For the purpose of 
this report, those recommendations 
are updated and supplemented on 
the basis of more recent literature 
focusing on a reasonable level 
of proficiency for a primary care 
provider who is not primarily 
managing substance use. Additional 
proficiencies are suggested ( 
Table 4) 
for health care providers who 
accept responsibility for prevention, 
assessment, intervention, and 
coordination of care and those 
who accept responsibility for long-
term treatment of children and 
adolescents in families affected by 
substance use.
Level 1 is a basic understanding of 
the biology of addiction, including 
recognition that drug and alcohol 
addiction are chronic and relapsing 
neurologic disorders that result 
from various drug effects on the 
brain’s reward circuitries and 
neurotransmitter systems. 
76 Chronic 
drug exposure may ultimately 
impair the function of brain regions 
involved with motivation and self-
control. 
76 Awareness of the medical, 
psychiatric, and behavioral signs 
and symptoms of substance use 
may assist health care providers in 
identifying affected families. 
74
Substance use screening that is age, 
sex, and culturally appropriate can 
be included in routine pediatric 
health maintenance care. 
75 By using 
motivational interviewing techniques 
(asking screening questions, 
developing discrepancy, expressing 
empathy, avoiding argumentation, 
rolling with resistance, and 
supporting patient self-efficacy), 
a provider can assist families in 
identifying problems substance use 
can cause and reasons a person may 
want to quit or cut back. 
75 Substance 
use screening could include review 
of the mother’s prenatal medical 
information and screening by 
history and, when indicated, urine 
toxicologic testing in the newborn 
period before hospital discharge. 
It is helpful for the pediatrician to 
understand the interpretation of 
positive urine drug screens in the 
mother and infant. In addition, it is 
helpful for pediatricians to provide 
brief interventions to adolescent

patients with positive screens for 
substance use. 
75, 
 
77, 
78 Be able to direct 
families to community, regional, or 
state resources available for children 
and adolescents in families with 
substance use. Discussing identified 
concerns with the family and 
offering information, support, and 
follow-up are components of quality 
pediatric care. 
74 It is important for 
pediatricians to develop respectful, 
compassionate approaches 
regardless of condition, ethnicity, age, 
or sexual orientation. 
75
Because health care providers are 
mandated reporters, they should 
understand obligatory child abuse 
reporting laws in their states 
and should know how to make a 
report to the responsible agency 
that investigates cases of alleged 
child abuse or neglect in their 
jurisdiction. 
73
COLLABORATING WITH OTHER 
PROVIDERS
Using a multidisciplinary approach, 
providers can do much to protect 
drug-endangered children when they 
work together across specialties and 
disciplines. It is important for the 
various professionals who have the 
opportunity to recognize a child at risk 
to understand their role in protecting 
and providing services to that child 
and the role of other professionals 
who may be involved with the same 
family. Reaching outside the silos of 
one’s profession in a collaborative 
fashion greatly increases the chance 
for more informed decision-making 
regarding families affected by parental 
substance use.
SUMMARY
Substance use is a major public health 
concern in the United States, and 
substance use disorders are common. 
Pediatricians are likely to encounter 
families affected by parental substance 
use. Pediatricians are encouraged 
to screen parents for substance use, 
and for parents who screen positive, 
discuss options for access to treatment 
from their primary care physician or an 
appropriate specialist; be alert for signs 
of child abuse or neglect in children 
and families affected by substance use; 
monitor children for developmental 
delays and other academic difficulties; 
and be familiar with mandatory 
reporting requirements for suspected 
child abuse and neglect.

TABLE 4  
Suggested Profi
 ciencies for Pediatricians
Level 1: For all health professionals with clinical responsibility for the care of children and adolescents:
 Be aware of the medical, psychiatric, and behavioral syndromes and symptoms with which children 
and adolescents in families with substance use present and of the potential benefi
 t to both the 
child and the family of timely and early intervention.
 Be familiar with and able to direct families to community, regional, and state resources available for 
children and adolescents in families with substance use.
 As part of the general health assessment of children and adolescents, health professionals include 
appropriate screening for family history and current use of alcohol and other drugs by parents.
 Use motivational interviewing techniques (asking screening questions, developing discrepancy, 
expressing empathy, avoiding argumentation, rolling with resistance, and supporting patient self-
effi
 cacy), assist families in identifying problems substance use can cause and reasons a person 
may want to quit or cut back. 
75
 Assist parents who screen positive and identify treatment options.
 Offer information, support, and follow-up for parents who screen positive.
 Understand state mandatory child abuse reporting laws and know how to make a report to the 
responsible investigating agency.
Level II: In addition to Level I profi
 ciencies, health care providers accepting responsibility for prevention, 
assessment, intervention, and coordination of care of children and adolescents in families with 
substance use may:
 Apprise the family of the nature of SUDs and their effects on all family members and strategies for 
achieving optimal health and recovery.
 Recognize and treat, or refer, all associated health problems in the child.
 Evaluate resources (physical health, economic, interpersonal, and social) to the degree necessary to 
formulate an initial management plan.
 Determine the need to involve extended family and other support people in the initial management 
plan.
 Develop a long-term management plan in consideration of the above standards and with the child’s or 
adolescent’s participation.
Level III: In addition to Level I and II profi
 ciencies, the health care provider with additional training, who 
accepts responsibility for long-term treatment of children and adolescents in families with substance 
use, may:
 Acquire knowledge, by training or experience, in the medical and behavioral treatment of children in 
families affected by substance use.
 Throughout the course of health care treatment, continually monitor and treat, or refer for care, any 
health needs or psychiatric or behavioral disturbances of the child or adolescent.
 Acquire knowledge, by training or experience, of the recovery process and gain an understanding of 
how to establish and evaluate screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment systems in 
practice. 
75
 Request consultation as needed.
 Be available to the child or adolescent and the family, as needed, for ongoing care and support.
