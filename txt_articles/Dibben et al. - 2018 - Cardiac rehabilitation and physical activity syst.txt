AbstrACt
Objective To undertake a systematic review and meta-
analysis to assess the impact of cardiac rehabilitation 
(CR) on physical activity (PA) levels of patients with heart 
disease and the methodological quality of these studies.
Methods Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, 
CINAHL, PsychINFO and SportDiscus) were searched 
without language restriction from inception to January 
2017 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
CR to usual care control in adults with heart failure 
(HF) or coronary heart disease (CHD) and measuring PA 
subjectively or objectively. The direction of PA difference 
between CR and control was summarised using vote 
counting (ie, counting the positive, negative and non-
significant results) and meta-analysis.
results Forty RCTs, (6480 patients: 5825 CHD, 655 
HF) were included with 26% (38/145) PA results 
showing a statistically significant improvement in PA 
levels with CR compared with control. This pattern of 
results appeared consistent regardless of type of CR 
intervention (comprehensive vs exercise-only) or PA 
measurement (objective vs subjective). Meta-analysis 
showed PA increases in the metrics of steps/day (1423, 
95% CI 757.07 to 2089.43, p<0.0001) and proportion 
of patients categorised as physically active (relative 
risk 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.02, p=0.001). The included 
trials were at high risk of bias, and the quality of the PA 
assessment and reporting was relatively poor.
Conclusion Overall, there is moderate evidence of 
an increase in PA with CR participation compared with 
control. High-quality trials are required, with robust PA 
measurement and data analysis methods, to assess if CR 
definitely leads to important improvements in PA.
IntrOduCtIOn
Physical activity (PA) is defined as any bodily move-
ment produced by skeletal muscles resulting in 
energy expenditure beyond resting expenditure.1 
The current UK recommendation for PA in adults 
and older adults is ≥150 
min of moderate intensity 
PA per week.2 This is based on a number of system-
atic reviews and consensus statement, consistently 
identifying 150 
min/week as providing consider-
able health benefits, including reduced all-cause 
mortality, reduced risk factors for chronic diseases, 
improved cardiovascular fitness and quality of 
life.2 3 This is also the standard PA recommendation 
for patients with cardiac disease by the British Asso-
ciation for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabil-
itation and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network.4 5 
The benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) partic-
ipation for those with coronary heart disease (CHD) 
and heart failure (HF) are well established and 
include reduced cardiovascular mortality, reduced 
risk of hospital admissions, improved exercise 
capacity and health-related quality of life.6 7 A key 
aim of CR is to increase total daily energy expen-
diture in addition to exercise capacity.2 However, 
previous observational studies demonstrated that 
many patients with heart disease (pre-CR and post-
CR) are failing to meet recommended daily PA 
levels8 9 and the extent that CR impacts on PA levels 
of patients remains unclear.
While two systematic reviews to date have 
indicated inadequate evidence of an impact of 
CR participation on PA levels of patients with 
CHD,10 11 these studies have limitations. Neither 
included studies involving patients with HF nor 
attempted meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity 
of CR interventions. Therefore, an updated system-
atic review with an improved search strategy and 
broader population inclusion criteria is justified.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-anal-
ysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was 
twofold. First, to clarify the impact of CR partici-
pation on PA levels of patients with CHD and HF. 
Second, to review the methodological quality of PA 
outcomes reported in these trials.
MethOds
The protocol was registered on PROSPERO 
(CRD42017055137). We conducted and report this 
systematic review in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyse statement.12

data extraction and risk of bias assessment
A standardised data extraction form was used to 
extract study characteristics, patient characteristics, 
intervention and control details, PA measurement 
method and outcome data at all follow-up time 
points. Multiple publications of the same study 
were assessed for additional data and presented as a 
single RCT (see online Supplementary file 3).
The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing 
risk of bias was used to assess the quality of included 
studies.13 Data extraction and risk of bias assess-
ment were initially completed by a single reviewer 
(GD) and then checked for accuracy by one other 
reviewer (MH, HD or RST). Disagreement was 
resolved by discussion.

review
data synthesis and meta-analysis
Due to the wide range of PA metrics reported across studies, we 
first summarised the direction of PA results using a vote counting 
approach13 (quantifying studies on the basis of their positive, 
negative or non-significant results). Given the wide range of PA 
measures, we decided against using standardised effect size for 
meta-analysis and instead conducted meta-analysis where two 
or more studies reported the same units of PA measurement. 
Meta-analysis was completed on all follow-up time points apart 
from one outcome measure (proportion of patients categorised 
as physically active) where there was sufficient data to separate 
into short-term (≤12 months post-CR) and long-term (>12 
months post-CR) follow-up.
Given the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies, 
random-effects models were used to pool data. Statistical hetero-
geneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Binary outcomes for 
each study were pooled as relative risks (RR) and continuous 
outcomes as mean differences (MD). Meta-analysis results were 
reported as means and 95% CIs. A two-tailed p value of ≤0.05 
was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed 
in Review Manager (RevMan V
.5.3, The Cochrane Collabora-
tion) or Stata V
.14.
We explored the effect of various potential treatment effect 
modifiers by stratifying the vote counting results, that is, setting 
of CR (centre vs home based), patient group (CHD vs HF), publi-
cation date (pre-1990, representing the time of major changes in 
drug and device management of CHD and HF), dose of exercise 
intervention (dose=number of weeks of exercise training×av-
erage sessions/week×average duration of session in minutes. 
Dose ≥2000 units (median) vs dose <2000 units); objective 
versus subjective PA measures and method of PA statistical anal-
ysis. Studies lacking enough information to calculate dose were 
omitted from the analysis.

risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias assessments for each study are summarised in figure 2. 
All studies were assigned high risk in blinding of participants and 
personnel due to the nature of CR. The most prevalent methodolog-
ical issues were non-adequate description of randomisation (25/40, 
62.5%), allocation concealment (27/40, 67.5%) and blinding of PA 
outcome assessment (26/40, 65%). There was high risk of bias in 
50% (20/40) trials for incomplete outcome data. Most trials were 
low risk for selective reporting (33/40, 82.5%), balanced groups 
at baseline (34/40, 85%) and were free of cointerventions (35/40, 
87.5%).
Impact of Cr participation on PA levels
Vote counting
A total of 145 CR versus control PA comparisons were reported 
across all studies (online Supplementary file 6). Overall, 26% of 
results showed a statistically significant improvement in PA with 
CR (table 2).
stratified analysis
The pattern of results was similar whether PA measurement 
was objective or subjective (online Supplementary file 7). The 
statistical methods used across the studies were varied. The 
majority reported a p value for between-group differences. 
Comparing the direction of results by statistical method showed 
a greater number of positive results reported when the p value 
for interaction time×group was used (online Supplementary file 
8). As numbers were small, this is unlikely to be of significance.
There was a higher proportion of non-significant results (86% vs 
63%) and fewer positive results (10% vs 32%) in studies including 
patients with HF compared with studies with CHD (online Supple-
mentary file 9). Removing the results from studies conducted prior 
to 1990 or those based on exercise frequency did not affect the 
direction of results (online Supplementary file 10).
CR intervention
Table 3 shows an increased number of positive results with home-
based CR interventions compared with centre-based interven-
tions. Studies with a higher exercise dose also produced a slightly 
increased number of positive results compared with studies with 
a lower exercise dose (online Supplementary file 11). The pattern 
of results was similar when comparing studies of comprehensive 
CR to exercise-only CR studies (online Supplementary file 12).
Meta-analyses
Steps/day
Five studies used mean steps/day as a measure of PA assessed 
by either pedometer 14–16 or accelerometer.17 18 Pooling results 
across studies showed compared with control, CR participation 
was associated with an increase in mean steps/day (1423, 95% 
CI 
757.07 to 2089.43, p<0.0001; figure 3) at short-term follow-up 
(median 3, range 1.5–12 months). With no evidence of statistical 
heterogeneity (I2=0%, p=0.845).
Energy  expenditure
Energy expenditure (kcal/week) was estimated via questionnaire 
in three studies (median follow-up time 12 months, range 32 
weeks–72 months).19–21 Meta-analysis showed that CR partic-
ipation was associated with an increase in energy expenditure 
compared with control (878.4, 95% 
CI 433.83 to 1323.01, 
p=0.0001). Test for statistical heterogeneity was significant 
(I2=70%, p=0.04).
Sedentary time, light PA and moderate–vigorous PA (min/day)
There was no impact on mean min/day spent sedentary or 
sitting between CR and control (−10.9, 95% 
CI −39.02 to 
17.20, p=0.45; figure 4A) based on two studies estimating this 
objectively via accelerometer14 18 and subjectively via Inter-
national Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ),22 at 9 weeks 
follow-up (median, range 6–12 weeks). There was no evidence 
of a difference in mean min/day spent in light intensity PA in 
CR compared with control (−6.6, 95% 
CI −45.09 to 31.92, 
p=0.74; figure 4B) based on two studies reporting this outcome 
via accelerometer23 and IPAQ,22 at 9.5 weeks follow-up (median, 
range 9–10 weeks). There was no difference in mean min/day 
spent in moderate–vigorous PA in CR compared with control 
(8.5, 95% 
CI −1.44 to 18.44, p=0.09; figure 4C), measured via 
accelerometer18 23 and IPAQ,22 at 9 weeks follow-up (median, 
range 6–10 weeks).
Proportion of patients categorised as physically active (short-term 
follow-up ≤12 months)
CR increased the proportion of patients categorised as ‘physically 
active’, measured at short-term follow-up (median 6 months, 
range 0–12 months) across nine studies (RR 1.55, 95%

CI 0.61 to 
0.95, p=0.02), with no evidence of statistical heterogeneity 
(I2=36%, p=0.18).
dIsCussIOn
This systematic review of RCTs shows moderate evidence of 
an increase in PA with CR participation with 26% (38/145) of 
comparisons reporting a statistically significant result in favour of 
CR compared with control. This pattern of results appear consis-
tent regardless of whether studies assessed PA using subjective or 
objective methods, or the CR intervention was comprehensive 
or exercise only. Studies involving patients with HF appeared 
less likely to have positive results in favour of CR. There was an 
increased proportion of positive results with higher doses of CR 
suggesting that higher doses of exercise training may be more 
effective in improving PA levels. Similarly, results suggest that 
home-based interventions may be more effective in improving 
PA levels.
Meta-analyses showed that CR participation compared with 
control is associated with an increase in some PA outcomes: steps/
day at short-term follow-up, energy expenditure (kcal/week) 
at short-term follow-up, proportion of patients categorised as 
physically active both at short-term and long-term follow-up 
and reduced proportion of patients categorised sedentary or not 
physically active at short-term follow-up. CR was not shown to 
have a significant impact on minutes/day spent sedentary or in 
light or moderate-vigorous PA at short-term follow-up.
It remains uncertain if the mean increase of 1423 steps/day 
that we observed with CR is clinically meaningful. In patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing rehabil-
itation, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was 
calculated to lie between 600 and 1100 steps/day and resulted in 
a reduction in hospital admissions.34 However, we know of no 
published MCID for patients with CHD or HF.
We believe there are two potential reasons why we saw 
improvements in some outcomes, but not others. First, cate-
gorising continuous PA data to PA categories (eg, sedentary, light 
moderate or vigorous) may have resulted in a loss of sensitivity 
to change. Second, some studies may have been susceptible to 
measurement bias as they used subjective PA measures.
Comparison of findings to previous studies
Our results build on previous systematic reviews10 11 that found 
some evidence to indicate that CR positively impacts on PA in 
patients with CHD, but little evidence in long term and recom-
mended CR programmes place more emphasis on improving the 
long-term PA levels of patients.10 Ter Hoeve et al concluded that 
centre-based CR was not sufficient to improve and maintain PA 
levels and suggested home-based CR programmes may be more 
successful; however, literature is limited in this area.11 In accord 
with recent Cochrane systematic reviews of CR,9 10 the partic-
ipating patients were relatively young (<60 years), predomi-
nantly male, with large differences in the programme location, 
duration, intensity, modality and length of follow-up.
strengths and limitations
We believe this to be the first meta-analysis to assess the impact 
of CR on PA levels of patients with both CHD and HF . Strengths 
of this review include extensive literature searches, use of RCTs 
and inclusion of both subjective and objective PA assessment. 
Compared with the previous systematic reviews, we identified 
an additional 23 RCTs (2432 additional patients), 10 of which 
specifically involved patients with HF (655 patients).
However, this review has limitations. With the wide range of 
PA outcomes reported across the studies, at various follow-up 
time points, we were limited in the extent of meta-analysis we 
were able to complete. That only small numbers of studies were 
suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis, limits our ability to 
draw firm conclusions from these pooled results. Vote counting 
was done to give a quantitative overview of the results. However, 
this method has limitations: (1) large and small studies carry the

by the authors on levels of PA were not based on national recom-

fulness of PA improvements.
Key issues raised in risk of bias assessments were insufficiently

dures, leading to difficulty rating the quality of the RCTs. Addi-
tionally, 65% of studies had unclear risk of bias with regard to

both the intervention and control group patients to alter their 
behaviour and increase their PA on assessment days, potentially 
introducing bias to results.
There were numerous limitations in approaches studies took 
to assessing PA. Where questionnaires were used, few had been 
evidently validated for use in cardiac populations. Self-report 
commonly considered the frequency of exercise sessions under-
taken as opposed to overall PA per se. Self-reported measures of 
PA are less valid and reliable than direct measures in patients with 
CR, generally overestimating PA and relying on patient recall.35 
Despite accelerometers being the most commonly used objec-
tive PA measurement method, a variety of devices were used, 
with sensors placed at different body sites, and a wide range of 
outcome metrics reported across studies, limiting the ability to 
meta-analyse these data. Additionally, data handling methods 
were poorly reported; no studies adequately explained the 
minimum wear time requirement for inclusion in data analysis 
or data reduction techniques. Where accelerometer thresholds 
were used to estimate intensity, they were derived from studies 
in young, healthy adults which may mean the PA level is under-
estimated in patients with cardiac disease.36 Resting metabolic 
rate in patients with cardiac disease has been previously demon-
strated to be significantly lower (23%–36%) than the typically 
utilised value of 3.5 
mL/kg/min,37 which may have implications 
in underestimating energy expenditure during higher intensity 
activities. Therefore, researchers should consider using thresh-
olds specifically established for patients with cardiac disease.
There was inconsistency in statistical methods used across the 
studies. Baseline adjusted regression methods are recommended 
for analysis of RCTs.38 However, only 35% reported a p value 
that took the baseline PA level into account. Although many 
studies showed between group differences in fitness outcomes, 
26% of results demonstrated a statistically significant difference 
in PA outcomes. This is likely because individual studies were 
often small and underpowered to detect small differences in PA. 
Only 13 (32%) of the included studies included formal sample 
size calculations and of these only 4 (31%) were based on PA 
outcomes.
Implications for clinical practice and future research
That our results showed no difference in PA outcomes in studies 
that employed comprehensive CR compared with exercise-only 
CR suggest that improvements in PA with CR are the result 
of exercise training rather than components of education and 
psychosocial interventions. Additionally, improvement in exer-
cise capacity may not be directly related to increases in PA levels. 
CR programmes should consider supplementing their existing 
exercise-training intervention with interventions that specifically 
aim to increase PA level. For example, the ongoing PATHway I 
trial, where the basis of the CR intervention is PA promotion and 
the primary outcome is objectively measured PA level.39
Further research is required to validate interventions that 
promote PA in cardiac populations. Furthermore, objective 
measurement of PA requires population-specific calibration 
studies to establish intensity thresholds. The use of inconsistent 
PA measures and units made formal pooling of data problem-
atic. We therefore recommend that future studies use objective 
measures of PA such as accelerometers, be statistically powered 
to detect small differences in PA, use appropriate data handling

and analysis methods, and PA outcomes are reported in rela-
tion to national PA recommendations. Studies should assess PA 
outcomes over the long term.
COnClusIOns
This systematic review and meta-analysis provides moderate 
evidence of an increase in PA with CR participation compared 
with control. However, the included trials were at risk of bias, 
and the quality of PA assessment and reporting was relatively 
poor. It is unclear whether increases in PA with CR are clinically 
meaningful. Further high-quality trials are required to assess 
if CR leads to important improvements in PA, such as the UK 
recommended target of 150 
min of moderate intensity PA per 
week, especially in long term.
