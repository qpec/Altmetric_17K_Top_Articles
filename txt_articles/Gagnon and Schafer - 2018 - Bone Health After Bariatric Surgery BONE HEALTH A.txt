ABSTRACT
Bariatric surgery results in long-term weight loss and improvement or resolution in obesity-related comorbidities. However, mounting
evidence indicates that it adversely affects bone health. This review summarizes clinical research findings about the impact of bariatric
surgery on skeletal outcomes. The literature is the largest and strongest for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure, as RYGB was
themostcommonlyperformedbariatricprocedureworldwideuntilitwasveryrecentlyovertakenbythesleevegastrectomy(SG).Because
SG is a newer procedure, its skeletal effects have not yet been well defined. Epidemiologic studies have now demonstrated an increased

strength. Skeletal changes after RYGB appear early and continue even after weight loss plateaus and weight stabilizes. The skeletal effects
of bariatric surgery are presumably multifactorial, and mechanisms may involve nutritional factors, mechanical unloading, hormonal
factors, and changes in body composition and bone marrow fat. Clinical guidelines address bone health and may mitigate the negative
skeletal effects of surgery, although more research is needed to direct and support such guidelines. © 2018 The Authors. JBMR Plus is

Introduction
O
besity is a public health concern worldwide. If not rapidly
addressed, it is predicted that in 2025, 18% of men and 21%
of women will be categorized as obese, and 6% of men and 9%
of women will be severely obese with body mass index (BMI)
�40 kg/m2.(1) The United States has already passed that mark, as
38% of US adults were obese in 2014, and 8% had BMI
�40 kg/m2.(2) Reflecting the obesity epidemic, the number of
bariatric surgeries performed internationally is rising.(3) This gain
in popularity for bariatric surgery is explained by several factors,
including its established efficacy for long-term weight loss(4) as
well as for improved glycemic control and even diabetes
remission in people with type 2 diabetes.(5) Furthermore,
bariatric surgery improves or resolves multiple comorbidities
associated with obesity, including dyslipidemia,(6) obstructive
sleep apnea,(7) and cardiovascular disease,(8) and also disease-
related mortality.(9) However, mounting evidence suggests that
bariatric surgery adversely affects bone health.
Since several review articles were written on this topic 4 years
ago,(10–14) understanding of the impact of bariatric surgery on
bone health has evolved. This review aims to summarize recent
evidence about the impact of bariatric surgery on bone
outcomes, including fracture risk, bone turnover markers, bone
mineral density (BMD), and bone microarchitecture and strength.
It will also recapitulate the data on potential mechanisms for the
skeletal changes after bariatric procedures, namely nutritional
and hormonal factors, body composition and bone marrow
changes, and mechanical unloading. Moreover, it will discuss the
clinical implications of these postoperative skeletal changes,

 including the impact of interventions to mitigate fracture risk
after bariatric surgery. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to
stimulate investigation to address knowledge gaps.
Overview of the Bariatric Procedures
Traditionally, bariatric procedures have been classified into
restrictive, malabsorptive, or combined restrictive and malabsorp-
tive surgeries based on the mechanisms by which they promote
weight loss. Restrictive surgeries limit food intake by reducing the
size of the stomach. Adjustable gastric banding and sleeve
gastrectomy belong to this category. Of note, sleeve gastrectomy
also induces functional malabsorption by altering nutrient transit
time. Combined restrictive and malabsorptive surgeries include
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with
duodenal switch (BPD-DS). In addition to their restrictive compo-
nent, these procedures limit the absorption of food and nutrients
by bypassing sections of the small intestine.
However, it is now recognized that hormonal changes
account for some of the benefits of sleeve gastrectomy, RYGB,
and BPD-DS by reducing appetite and by improving glucose
homeostasis.(15) Bariatric procedures induce hormonal changes
due to weight loss (eg, changes in adipose tissue–derived
hormones such as estrogens, adiponectin, and leptin) and due
to the anatomical changes induced by surgery (eg, changes in
gastrointestinal-derived hormones such as ghrelin, glucagon-
like peptide 1, and peptide YY).
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)
LAGB is a purely restrictive procedure. It was once the most
popular restrictive bariatric procedure, but because of its
relatively modest weight loss (excess weight loss of 40% to
50%), high rates of weight regain, and late complications, it is
now on the decline.(3,16) LAGB involves inserting a small ring in
the proximal stomach to create a pouch above the ring of about
15 to 20 mL (Fig. 1A). Ring diameter can be reduced as needed by
injecting sterile saline through a port inserted subcutaneously.
Sleeve gastrectomy (SG)
SG is now the most commonly performed bariatric procedure
worldwide.(3) It involves the longitudinal resection of the lateral
part of the stomach from the fundus to the antrum to create a
narrow tubular stomach, leaving only about 20% of the stomach
in place (Fig. 1B). While SG restricts the amount of food intake
through reduced stomach size, it also promotes satiety by
decreasing ghrelin levels and by increasing glucagon-like
peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) levels.(17) SG results in
a significant and sustained weight loss of >50% excess weight
loss in the long term.(18)
RYGB
RYGB has long been the favored bariatric procedure worldwide,
but SG recently surpassed it.(3) RYGB is a restrictive procedure,
but it also involves a malabsorptive component that contributes
to weight loss. First, a small stomach pouch of about 30 mL is
created (Fig. 1C). Then, the small intestine is transected at a
variable distance distal to the ligament of Treitz, typically 30 to
50 cm, and the remaining small intestine is anastomosed to the
gastric pouch (alimentary limb). The biliopancreatic limb is
connected 75 to 150 cm distal to the gastric pouch, creating a
common channel of roughly 400 cm where absorption of food
and nutrients occurs. RYGB leads to several hormonal changes
that control hunger and glycemia, including increased GLP-1
and PYY levels.(19,20) It results in excess weight loss of about 70%
that persists in the long term.(4,21)
BPD-DS
BPD-DS
represents
only
1%
of
all
bariatric
procedures
worldwide.(3) The restrictive part of the procedure is a SG
(Fig. 1D). For the intestinal bypass, the duodenum is first
transected 3 cm distal to the pylorus. Then, the small intestine is
transected at 250 cm from the ileocecal valve and the distal end
is connected to the duodenum to create an alimentary limb.
Finally, the biliopancreatic limb is connected approximately
100 cm from the ileocecal valve to create a common channel.
BDP-DS thus results in substantial malabsorption. GLP-1 and PYY
responses after glucose ingestion are enhanced.(22,23) Excess
weight loss after BPD-DS is approximately 70% to 80%.(21)
Bone Outcomes After Bariatric Surgery
Fracture risk
Since 2012, a number of epidemiologic studies have evaluated
the impact of various bariatric procedures on fracture risk.(24–29)
(See Table 1 for a summary of the studies.) All except one of
these cohort studies used large population-based databases
from the US, the UK, Canada, and Taiwan (n ¼ 2064 to 12,676
patients in the bariatric groups). Study designs varied in several
ways. Sources of heterogeneity include length of follow-up and
the type of bariatric procedure studied, with most including a
mixture of several bariatric procedures. In addition, studies
differed in the covariates used to match the control group with
the bariatric groups; most studies did not match controls for BMI,
and some studies did not adjust findings for several important
confounders.
However,
some
interesting
findings
have
emanated.
First, valuable information on the typical patient undergoing
bariatric surgery has been provided by these studies. Whereas in
the US, the UK, and Canada mostly women in their mid 40s are
opting for bariatric surgery,(24–27,29) mean age at surgery is about
10 years younger in Taiwan.(28) Mean BMI at time of surgery
varies from 43 to 49 kg/m2 in the studies for which data are
available.(25–27,29)
Moreover,
the
study
by
Rousseau
and
colleagues built upon the knowledge already gathered on
fracture risk in people with obesity. Although it confirmed that
people with obesity and, more so those with severe obesity, are
at higher risk of fracture than those without obesity, it revealed
that fracture risk is site-specific in obesity, affecting predomi-
nantly the distal lower limb (tibia, ankle, feet).(24) In studies that
did not exclude those with a history of fracture, between 11%
and 36% had experienced at least one fracture episode before
surgery.(24,26,27) In summary, patients with severe obesity who
undergo bariatric surgery are mainly women in their mid 30s to
40s, a significant minority of whom have a history of fracture,
most likely of the distal lower limb.
Second, available data suggest that fracture risk after bariatric
surgery varies depending on the bariatric procedure. On one
hand, LAGB does not appear to be associated with an increased
risk of fracture, at least in the short term (mean follow-up of 2.2
years).(27) On the other hand, mixed malabsorptive and
restrictive procedures including RYGB and BPD-DS are associ-
ated with a relative risk increase of 1.4 to 2.3, depending on the
study.(24–26,28) Although absolute fracture risk in this generally
122
GAGNON AND SCHAFER

 young population is still low, affecting an estimated 10 per 1000
person-years,(25) it is important to consider that as the
population ages and women pass through menopause, this
may translate into an important fracture burden. There are
insufficient data to make conclusions about whether fracture
risk is associated with SG.
Third, most studies did not have enough fracture events in the
bariatric group to assess fracture risk by site.(27–29) The studies
that had been able to evaluate this outcome indicate that
bariatric surgery increases fracture risk at osteoporotic sites with
an increase in wrist, humerus, clinical spine, hip, or femur
fractures.(24–26) However, the study by Lu and colleagues from
Taiwan described a predominance of fractures of the clavicle,
scapula, sternum, feet, and toes after bariatric surgery.(28) It is
unclear if the distinct findings of this study are because of
ethnicity; however, the small number of fracture events may
have contributed to the lack of significant results at osteoporotic
sites. Finally, Rousseau and colleagues highlighted that fracture
pattern
changes
after
bariatric
surgery,
from
a
pattern
associated with obesity to a pattern of fracture typically found
in osteoporosis (ie, fractures of the upper limb, clinical spine, and
hip/femur/pelvis).(24)
Fourth, available evidence suggests that fracture risk starts to
increase between 2 and 5 years after surgery. In the studies by
Rousseau and colleagues and Yu and colleagues, fracture risk
rose as early as 2 to 3 years after surgery.(24,25) Moreover,
Nakamura and colleagues showed that although fracture risk 0
to 5 years after surgery was already higher than in the general
population, it was even greater in years 5 to 10 and 10þ after
surgery.(26) Finally, Lalmohamed and colleagues found a trend
toward an increase in fracture risk 3 to 5 years after surgery.(27) Of
note, Rousseau and colleagues reported that after the first peak
at 3 years, fracture risk plateaued, then started to increase again
at year 8 to reach a second higher peak at year 11 after
surgery.(24)
For
the

patient—a
premenopausal woman—this second peak may correspond to

Y gastric bypass (C) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) (D) are mixed restrictive and malabsorptive procedures, the malabsorptive
component is greater for BPD-DS. (From DeMaria EJ. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. N Engl J Med. 2007;356:2176–83. Copyright © 2007 Massachusetts

BONE HEALTH AFTER BARIATRIC SURGERY

 her passage through menopause. This is speculative, however,
as menopausal status was not assessed and because attrition
may also explain this finding.
In summary, evidence gathered from epidemiologic studies
suggest that mixed restrictive and malabsorptive procedures
such as RYGB and BPD-DS are associated with an increased risk
of fracture at osteoporotic sites and that fracture risk starts to
manifest between 2 and 5 years after surgery. It remains
uncertain if menopausal status influences fracture risk in the
bariatric population because very few studies had a follow-up
that was long enough to capture a large number of menopausal
women. Although LAGB appears not to increase fracture risk at
least in the short term, it is not possible at this point to determine
whether SG is safe for skeletal health. Large population-based
cohort studies are necessary that compare various bariatric
procedures in the long term in groups matched for important
confounding factors including BMI.
Bone turnover, mass, and microarchitecture
As epidemiologic studies have emerged demonstrating in-
creased fracture risk after bariatric surgery, mounting evidence
from patient-oriented studies has elucidated the bone tissue-
level changes that may account for the increase in skeletal
fragility. In this section, data will be summarized and synthesized
from human studies with bone turnover, mass, and micro-
architecture outcomes. The most notable feature of the recent
studies is the application of advanced skeletal imaging
modalities. In the first wave of studies, skeletal effects of
bariatric surgery were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorpti-
ometry (DXA).(10,11) However, assessment of areal BMD (aBMD)
by DXA may be biased in the setting of marked weight loss
because of changes in the composition of the soft tissue
surrounding bone.(30,31) As a result, uncertainty lingered about
whether and to what extent reported postoperative aBMD
declines might be the result of DXA artifact. Furthermore, DXA
cannot distinguish cortical from trabecular bone compartments,
nor can it evaluate elements of bone microstructure—aspects of
“bone quality”—or estimate bone strength. More recent studies
of the skeletal effects of bariatric surgery address these
limitations of DXA by using QCT to assess volumetric BMD
(vBMD) at the axial skeleton and/or high-resolution peripheral
quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to assess vBMD,
microstructure, and estimated strength at the appendicular
skeleton.(32–37) Although obesity and weight loss can also
influence QCT assessments,(38) QCT technology has strength-
ened and advanced the knowledge base.
For all of these patient-oriented skeletal outcomes, the
literature is by far the largest and strongest for RYGB, as RYGB
was the most commonly performed bariatric procedure
worldwide until very recently.(3) Fewer data exist for LAGB
and BPD-DS, as the use of those procedures declined over the
years that interest in studying bone outcomes grew. Because SG
is a newer procedure, its skeletal effects have not yet been well
defined.
Bone turnover markers
Bariatric surgery induces early and dramatic increases in
biochemical markers of bone turnover.(10,11,14,39) After RYGB,
serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTx) elevation has been docu-
mented as early as 10 days postoperatively,(40) then marker
levels peak by 6 to 12 months but remain elevated.(33,41,42) The
bone resorption marker serum CTx typically increases by 200%
during the first postoperative year.(10,11) Biochemical markers of
bone formation increase but typically to a lesser extent,(10,11,14)
suggesting a potential “uncoupling” of resorption from forma-
tion that has also been reported in rat models of RYGB.(43–45) The
few studies to compare marker increases after RYGB and SG have
observed either similar increases for the two procedures(41) or
greater increases after RYGB.(5,36) Bone turnover markers
increase after BPD-DS,(46) and studies of LAGB have variably
shown increases from baseline(47,48) or no change(40,49) in marker
levels. It is now clear that after RYGB, bone turnover marker
elevations are sustained: In a trial of adults with type 2 diabetes
randomized to bariatric surgery or medical diabetes therapy,
serum CTx was higher after RYGB than in the medical therapy
group at 5 years.(5) After BPD-DS, marker levels were elevated at
4 years.(46)
Bone mass
After RYGB, BMD declines at the axial skeleton, demonstrated by
DXA and also by QCT-based imaging modalities. Since 2004,
many prospective studies have used DXA to examine BMD
change after RYGB; a published meta-analysis summarized the
clear decreases in aBMD reported by studies published before
2014,(39) and subsequent studies have yielded generally
consistent DXA findings.(32,33,35,36,41,50–53) At the proximal femur,
the magnitude of the aBMD decline by DXA is particularly
striking, with 12-month decreases ranging from 6% to 11%,
roughly comparable to the bone mass a woman might lose over
the first 3 to 4 years of menopause. Two published studies have
now assessed proximal femur vBMD by QCT and have observed
declines in vBMD, although declines are smaller in magnitude
than aBMD declines by DXA.(33,36) In the first study, no loss of
bone mass was detected by QCT during the first year, despite a
substantial decline in aBMD by DXA, but then by 2 years, vBMD
by QCT was 7% lower in RYGB participants compared with
nonsurgical controls.(33) In the second study, total hip vBMD by
QCT did decrease significantly during the first year, although to a
lesser extent than total hip aBMD by DXA.(36) Together, these
findings suggest that bone mass does decrease at the hip after
RYGB, although DXA might overestimate the decline. At the
lumbar spine, DXA-assessed aBMD generally declines, although
the magnitude of change is usually smaller than at the
hip(33,35,36,39,41,50,53) and in some studies has not reached
statistical significance.(32,51,52) Three studies assessing spinal
BMD by both DXA and QCT,(33,34,36) however, have demon-
strated decreases in spinal vBMD by QCT that are larger in
magnitude than aBMD declines by DXA and even on par with
the magnitude of the DXA-detected declines at the proximal
femur.(33,34,36) For example, at 12 months after RYGB in one
cohort, aBMD at the femoral neck had decreased by a mean of
8.0%, and vBMD at the spine had similarly decreased by 8.1%,
even though DXA did not detect a statistically significant change
in aBMD at the spine.(34) In light of the fact that spinal aBMD by
DXA may be susceptible to spurious elevation in the presence of
degenerative disease and other processes,(54) this raises
suspicion for artifactual confounding of the DXA results at the
spine. Taken together, the studies’ spinal findings suggest that
bone mass does decrease at the spine after RYGB, and DXA
might underestimate the decline.
After RYGB, BMD declines at the appendicular skeleton as well.
Reported changes in aBMD at the forearm by DXA have been
variable, often with decreases at the ultradistal and total radius

 during the first postoperative year but no change at the 1/3
distal radius.(32,34,55–59) Four studies have now used HR-pQCT to
examine the skeletal effects of RYGB and have documented
declines in vBMD at the radius and tibia.(32–35) Measured declines
in vBMD at the radius and tibia by HR-pQCT have been smaller
than at the spine and hip, but experiments with HR-pQCT
phantoms wrapped in simulated fat indicate that HR-pQCT
underestimates vBMD decrease in the setting of decreasing fat
mass.(34) The observation that detrimental changes occur at
both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing sites (tibia and
radius) signals that the skeletal effects of RYGB are at least in part
systemic in nature. In examining the individual cortical and
trabecular compartments, the studies employing HR-pQCT
identify a consistent pattern: At the radius, the decrease in
total vBMD is driven by a decrease in trabecular vBMD,(33–35)
whereas at the tibia, the total vBMD decline is due to vBMD
change either within the cortical compartment(32,34) or within
both compartments.(33,35)
Temporal trends have emerged from the studies of BMD
changes after RYGB. First, changes appear early, with decreases
documented by DXA, QCT, and HR-pQCT just 6 months
postoperatively.(34,41,42,52,59,60) Second, BMD continues to de-
crease with time, even after weight loss plateaus and weight
stabilizes. In two RYGB studies, weight loss plateaued between
12 and 24 months, but BMD decreased progressively through-
out the 24 months.(33,51) In a cohort of 59 women, there was a
10.2% decline in DXA-assessed femoral neck aBMD in the first
year, and then—despite mild weight regain between years 1
and 3—an additional 2.7% aBMD decline during that period.(61)
An extension of one of the 24-month studies has now
demonstrated continued declines in vBMD at the spine, radius,
and tibia between 2 and 5 years after surgery, despite stability in
weight.(62)
The effects of RYGB on bone mass may particularly impact
postmenopausal
women.
Because
approximately
80%
of
bariatric surgery patients are women,(63) and the average age
at bariatric surgery is the early to mid 40s,(24–27,29) studies of
RYGB and bone health have included very few men and
postmenopausal women or have restricted enrollment to
premenopausal women to decrease heterogeneity.(41,50) In
one study of women with sufficient numbers for comparison
of pre- and postmenopausal women, postmenopausal women
not only had lower mean DXA-assessed aBMD values 3 years
postoperatively but also had greater aBMD declines at the
femoral neck and spine.(61) In a recent study enrolling
premenopausal women, postmenopausal women, and men,
preoperative bone mass was lowest among postmenopausal
women, as one would expect.(34) One year postoperatively,
absolute and percentage declines in aBMD at the total hip by
DXA, vBMD at the spine by QCT, and vBMD at the tibia by HR-
pQCT were worse for postmenopausal women than for
premenopausal women or men. For example, femoral neck
aBMD declined 12.2% in postmenopausal women, 7.2% in
premenopausal women, and 6.8% in men (p < 0.05 for
difference between postmenopausal women and each of the
other groups). Heightened vulnerability of the postmenopausal
skeleton may assist with hypotheses about mechanisms for the
skeletal effects of bariatric surgery, and it may have implications
for clinical care, discussed below.
Far fewer data exist about the effects of other bariatric surgery
procedures on bone mass than about the effects of RYGB, as the
use of LAGB and BPD-DS waned over the years that interest in
studying bone outcomes waxed, and as SG is a newer procedure.
After BPD-DS, aBMD by DXA has been shown to decrease;(46) no
study has directly compared BMD effects of BPD-DS with other
procedures. After LAGB, aBMD by DXA appears to decrease
modestly at the hip but not the spine,(47,49,64) with declines at the
hip smaller than those after RYGB,(64) and with decline in whole-
body bone mineral content comparable to that observed in
medical weight management nonsurgical controls.(65) After SG,
BMDappears to decrease,butit is unclear whether it decreasesas
much as it does after RYGB, and SG studies have been limited by
small sample size, short duration, lack of prospective design,
and/or the exclusive use of DXA.(36,37,41,50,51,64,66–69) In one study
comparing women undergoing SG and RYGB, for example, DXA-
assessed aBMD appeared to decrease more after RYGB than SG,
although the difference was not statistically significant.(50) Two
recent studies showed similar declines in aBMD, including an
analysis of a randomized trial of SG, RYGB versus medical therapy
for diabetes.(41,51) In that randomized trial, for example, mean 24-
month declines in total hip aBMD after RYGB and SG were 9.5%
and 9.2%, respectively.(51) Two studies have used QCT to assess
axial vBMD after SG.(36,37) In one, in 7 RYGB and 14 SG
participants, no changes in spinal vBMD were detected within
or between groups after 6 months.(37) In the other, in 9 RYGB and
10 SG participants, 12-month decline in hip aBMD by DXA was
greater in the RYGB group than the SG group, but changes in hip
vBMD by QCT were similar, as were declines in spinal aBMD and
vBMD.(36) Now that SG and RYGB are the predominant bariatric
procedures performed, it will be important for fully informed
decision-making to understand the relative effects of the two
procedures on BMD. Further, as the bariatric surgery landscape
continues to evolve, comparisons of procedural effects will
remain a priority.
Bone microarchitecture
Because cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture influ-
ences bone quality and strength,(70) some studies of the skeletal
effects of bariatric surgery have included microarchitectural
outcomes. In a study of obese adults undergoing BPD-DS, iliac
crest bone biopsies preoperatively and 4 years postoperatively
demonstrated changes including increased osteoid volume and
decreased cortical thickness.(46) Four studies to date to have
used HR-pQCT to quantitatively characterize compartmental
microstructure.(32–35)
These
studies,
which
have
involved
participants
undergoing
RYGB(33–35)
or
RYGB,
SG,
and
LAGB,(32) have documented deterioration in trabecular and
cortical architecture. Within the trabecular compartment,
trabecular number decreases and trabecular separation and
heterogeneity increase.(33–35) Cortical thickness decreases and
trabecular
area
increases,
consistent
with
endocortical
resorption.(32–35) Cortical porosity increases dramatically.(33–35)
Bone strength, estimated by micro-finite element analysis,
declines at both the radius and the tibia,(33,34) consistent with
the increase in fracture risk increasingly documented in
epidemiologic studies, described above.
Potential Mechanisms for Postoperative
Bone Changes
The negative skeletal effects of bariatric surgery are presumably
multifactorial, and mechanisms may involve nutritional factors,
mechanical unloading, hormonal factors, and changes in body
composition and bone marrow fat.

 Nutritional factors
Before bariatric surgery, micronutrient and macronutrient
deficiencies are commonly encountered in patients with severe
obesity.(71) The intake of nutrient-poor food may lead to
insufficient intake of nutrients that are important for bone
health, including vitamin D, calcium, and protein. If not
addressed properly, nutrient deficiencies may be aggravated
after all bariatric procedures and especially after procedures
with a malabsorptive component such as RYGB and BPD-DS.(71)
In a recent systematic review of observational studies, mean
serum 25OHD concentrations before surgery were <20ng/mL and
from 20 to 30ng/mL in 42% and 33% of included studies,
respectively.(72)ObeseindividualsmaybepredisposedtovitaminD
deficiency because of sequestration or volumetric dilution of the
fat-soluble hormone in fat stores and inadequate sunlight
exposure.(73) After bariatric surgery, vitamin D is malabsorbed,
and in the great majority of studies, mean serum 25OHD
concentrations remain <30ng/mL despite diverse vitamin D
supplementation regimens.(72) Preoperative calcium intakes are
below recommended dietary allowance for almost half of the
bariatric surgery population,(74) and the combination of vitamin D
deficiency and low dietary calcium intake likely explains why
secondary hyperparathyroidism is so prevalent in obesity, with
prevalence rates ranging from 21% to 66%.(75–78) After RYGB,
intestinal calcium absorption declines.(52,79) This occurs even in the
setting of optimized vitamin D status: Schafer and colleagues
demonstrated that despite maintaining adequate vitamin D status
(most participants with 25OHD >30ng/mL) and calcium intake
(total daily intake of 1200mg from diet and calcium citrate
supplements), intestinal fractional calcium absorption (FCA)
decreased dramatically—from a mean of 33% to 7%—6 months
after RYGB.(52) In parallel, parathyroid hormone (PTH) concen-
trations increased and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion de-
creased. There was an inverse correlation between change in FCA
and change in bone resorption marker serum CTx, suggesting that
the decline in FCA may be detrimental to bone health in the long
term. The effects of other bariatric procedures on FCA have not
been determined. Overall, in light of malabsorption and often
inadequate intakes of vitamin D and calcium after bariatric surgery,
it is not surprising that secondary hyperparathyroidism is common
postoperatively, reaching about 40%, 57%, 74%, and 70% after
LAGB, SG, RYGB, and BPD-DS, respectively, at 5 years.(75,80)
As early as 3 months after RYGB, an increase in most amino
acids was observed, which possibly reflects muscle catabo-
lism.(81) In the settings of nonsurgical caloric restriction and after
bariatric surgery, adequate protein intake has been shown to
minimize muscle and bone loss.(53,82) However, meeting dietary
recommendations for protein intake may be a challenge after all
bariatric procedures because of very restricted caloric intake
and/or protein intolerance.(83–85)
Mechanical unloading
The skeleton adapts to mechanical strain, and bone mass and
architecture are maintained and enhanced in response to loading
or diminished in response to disuse.(86) Thus, detrimental effects
on bone mass and microarchitecture have been documented
with bed rest,(87) restricted weight-bearing after orthopedic
surgery,(88) and space flight.(89) After bariatric surgery, dramatic
weight loss results in the relative unloading of the skeleton. One
study documented postoperative increases in the osteocyte-
secreted, load-responsive hormone sclerostin, and increases in
sclerostin correlated with increases in bone turnover markers and
decreases in aBMD.(41) In several bariatric surgery studies, greater
weight loss has been associated with greater decline in proximal
femur aBMD by DXA.(32,34,51,58) However, an association between
extent of weight loss and BMD decline might not be attributable
to the effects of mechanical unloading, and instead could exist if
those with greater weight loss have more dramatic changes in
nutritional or hormonal factors. Furthermore, mechanical un-
loading cannot account for the skeletal changes that occur at the
non-weight-bearing radius after bariatric surgery, nor the
continued loss of bone mass even after weight loss plateaus.(33,51)
Thus, mechanical unloading may contribute to but is insufficient
to explain skeletal effects of bariatric surgery.

 reviews(10–13)and will be summarized here. After bariatric
surgery, hormonal changes occur as a consequence of weight
loss and of anatomical changes induced by surgery. Indeed, fat
mass loss increases adiponectin, IGF-1, and total testosterone,
whereas it reduces leptin, estradiol, and insulin. Moreover, most
bariatric procedures increase GLP-1 and peptide YY concen-
trations, with variable effects on ghrelin.(15) It is anticipated,
based on preclinical studies, that the increase in adiponectin and
peptide YY and the reduction in estradiol, leptin, insulin, and
potentially ghrelin will diminish bone mass, while the rise in
testosterone, GLP-1, and IGF-1 will favor bone mass gain.(12)
Although the involvement of adipose tissue and gut-derived
hormones in the pathophysiology of bone loss after bariatric
surgery is appealing, conflicting results have emerged from the
small
observational
studies
where
associations
between
changes in bone turnover markers or BMD and changes in
hormonal factors have been sought.(35,50,51,68,90,91) Moreover,
most studies have looked at these associations after RYGB and
SG, while to our knowledge, only one concerned LAGB and none
addressed BPD-DS.
Among all participants in the STAMPEDE trial (RYGB, SG, and
intensive medical diabetes therapy groups), an association between
reductioninleptinandhipBMDlossbyDXAat2yearswasnolonger
significant after adjustment for weight loss, suggesting that change
in leptin may be a mediator of the relationship between weight loss
and hip bone loss.(51) However, the findings of Bruno and colleagues
suggestedthatchangeinleptinafterRYGBmightplayadirectrolein
the pathophysiology of bone loss. Indeed, they found that the
decrease in leptin was a significant predictor of the increase in the
bone resorption marker N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) at 6 months
after RYGB, independent of change in BMI.(89) In addition, the
increase in adiponectin at 1 year after RYGB correlated with the
decrease in total BMD by DXA, and this was unrelated to changes in
body composition parameters.(60) In a study by Carrasco and
colleagues, reduction in ghrelin was also associated with total BMD
loss by DXA after RYGB and with lumbar spine BMD loss after RYGB
and SG.(50) In a small study, Yu and colleagues found that changes in
fasting peptide YY displayed a strong correlation with both 10-day
and 1-year changes in CTx (r¼ 0.70, p< 0.001) and 1-year change in
P1NP (r¼ 0.77, p¼ 0.014) after RYGB.(40) No correlation was found
between changes in IGF-1 and changes in BMD by DXA 1 year after
RYGB and SG,(68,90) as well as between changes in insulin, bone
turnover markers, and BMD by DXA 2 years after RYGB.(35) Finally,

testosterone,(92) an association between changes in sex hormones
andboneoutcomesafterbariatricsurgerywasnotidentifiedinavery

are required to determine whether and which hormonal changes
play a role in the bone loss after various bariatric procedures.
Body composition and bone marrow fat
Muscle provides critical anabolic mechanical stimulus for bone
tissue,(93,94) and muscle mass and strength are also important for
physicalfunctionandavoidance offalls. Bariatric surgeryresults in
loss of muscle mass,(95–100) although the relative loss of fat mass is
greaterthanmuscle.(60,94)Mostmusclemasslossoccursinthefirst
6 postoperative months,(94,101) and after that, it is highly variable,
with some patients experiencing muscle mass maintenance or
gain and others continued loss.(100) It is possible that absolute or
relative decreases in muscle mass exacerbate decreases in bone
mass and quality, whereas muscle improvements could mitigate
the negative effects of bariatric surgery on bone. Indeed, a
number of studies have reported that those with greater decline
in lean mass have greater decline in aBMD by DXA(35,41,51,56,61) or
deterioration in microstructure by HR-pQCT.(35)
The bone marrow is a depot for adipose tissue, but the
physiological significance of bone marrow fat remains uncertain.
Greater bone marrow fat is associated with lower bone
mass,(102–106) more rapid bone loss,(107) and vertebral fracture.(108)
Theregulationofmarrowfatappearsdistinctfromtheregulationof
other fat depots, as caloric restriction paradoxically increases
marrow fat in mice,(109) and women with anorexia nervosa have
high marrow fat.(110,111) These findings have led to the proposal
that if marrow fat increases with dramatic weight loss after bariatric
surgery, that increase might be a mechanism for the postoperative
decline in skeletal health. Three published studies have examined
marrow fat after bariatric surgery, quantifying marrow fat with
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).(36,37,112) Ivaska
and colleagues found no significant 6-month change in vertebral
marrow fat content in 21 participants (14 SG and 7 RYGB)
undergoing bariatric surgery.(37) Bredella and colleagues observed
12-month increases in vertebral and femoral marrow fat in 10
participants undergoing SG but no changes in 11 undergoing
RYGB.(36) Kim and colleagues found that among women undergo-
ing RYGB, vertebral marrow fat actually decreased over 6 months
among those with diabetes (n¼ 13).(111) Among those without
diabetes (n¼ 12), marrow fat did not change on average, but those
who lost more total body fat were more likely to have marrow fat
increases. Further, marrow fat changes correlated with BMD
decline, such that women with increases in marrow fat content had
greater decreases in femoral neck aBMD by DXA and spinal vBMD
by QCT. This finding suggests that while marrow fat cannot alone
explain the decline in bone mass after bariatric surgery, it could
contribute to negative skeletal effects.
Clinical Implications
The field of bone health after bariatric surgery is evolving rapidly.
However, there are almost no randomized controlled trials on
which the clinician can rely to optimize the management of
patients before and after various bariatric procedures. There are a
number of published guidelines that provide advice on how to
manage the bariatric patient.(113–116) In addition to general
guidelines, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric
Surgery (ASMBS) issued a position statement specifically address-
ing metabolic bone changes after bariatric surgery.(117) However,
most recommendations are based on low-quality evidence or
expert opinion. The management approach we propose (Table 2)
thus rests on personal opinion derived from available knowledge.
Given that patients with obesity are at high risk of vitamin D
deficiency, one should measure serum 25OHD and correct
vitamin D deficiency preoperatively.(114,116) After all types of
bariatric procedures, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD,
calcium, albumin, and PTH levels is indicated. The recom-
mended frequency of these measurements varies between
guidelines.(114,116) A reasonable approach is to perform routine
biochemical screening every 6 months for the first 2 years and
then annually. Yet, testing frequency should be adjusted based
on clinical grounds. Measurement of 24-hour urinary calcium
and of serum bone turnover markers may be useful at times.
After all bariatric procedures, sufficient calcium, vitamin D, and
protein intake and adequate physical activity are recommended
to mitigate negative impacts of the procedures on bone and
muscle. Evidence that these measures may be effective

 collectively comes from a recent randomized controlled trial
conducted by Muschitz and colleagues.(53) The two-arm trial
tested a multimodal approach composed of preoperative vitamin
Dsupplementation(28,000IUofvitaminD3 per weekfor8weeks),
then postoperatively, a combination of 28,000 IU of vitamin D3
per week, calcium citrate 1000 mg daily, BMI-adjusted protein
intake (35 to 60 g of protein daily), and a physical activity program
(Nordik walking and strength training). The control group
received no preoperative vitamin D, no postoperative supple-
mentation with vitamin D, calcium, or protein, and no require-
ment for physical activity. Over 2 years, the multipronged
intervention reduced—although did not prevent—the negative
impact of RYGB and SG on bone turnover markers, aBMD by DXA,
and lean mass. Additional trials will be needed to understand the
relative importance of the individual components of the
multimodal intervention, but the results are encouraging. In
another recent study, a supervised weight-bearing and aerobic
program twice a week for 36 weeks also attenuated the decrease
in BMD and lean mass seen after RYGB.(118)
Regarding vitamin D supplementation, the ASMBS guidelines
suggest an initial dose of 3000 IU of vitamin D3 daily after LAGB, SG,
and RYGB, with titration to serum 25OHD >30ng/mL. Higher
vitamin D doses are often required for BPD. Regarding calcium
supplementation, calcium citrate is preferred over calcium carbon-
ate, with 2 to 3 split doses to achieve a total daily calcium intake
(from diet plus supplements) of 1200 to 1500mg daily for LAGB, SG,
and RYGB, and 1800 to 2400mg daily for BPD.(115,116) Choice of
calciumcitrateismainlybasedonasmallstudythatreportedhigher
bioavailability of calcium citrate compared with calcium carbonate
after RYGB.(119) As highlighted in the study by Schafer and
colleagues,(52) recommended calcium intake may not be sufficient
for a substantial proportion of patients, at least after RYGB and
possibly also after BPD, and thus monitoring with PTH and (when
appropriate) 24-hour urinary calcium is imperative.
The utility of DXA before and after bariatric surgery is debated.
Indeed, DXA might underestimate fracture risk in obesity, and
BMD changes by DXA may be inaccurate in the context of acute
weight loss.(38,59,120) Further, average age at bariatric surgery is
the mid 40s, and in the majority of pre- and early postoperative
patients, BMD is robust.(121) As a result, there is a lack of
agreement between guidelines about in whom and when BMD
should be assessed in the bariatric population. We believe that
DXA could be performed preoperatively in higher-risk patients,
including postmenopausal women, men aged >50 years, and
those with risk factors for osteoporosis. It could also be
considered postoperatively, perhaps after 2 years, in select
patients. DXA of the distal one-third of the forearm or QCT of the
spine may be useful if a patient’s weight exceeds the DXA table
limit, although modern DXA scanners can accommodate
increasingly heavy patients. Forearm scans may also be of
interest in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, as this
condition affects predominantly cortical bone. Moreover, spinal
QCT may be useful if DXA results are difficult to interpret.
No study has assessed the effect of osteoporosis pharmaco-
therapy in the context of bone loss after bariatric surgery. In
patients with a moderate or a high risk of fracture, antiresorptive
agents may be envisaged after secondary causes of osteoporosis
are addressed and only after vitamin D and calcium supplemen-
tation is deemed sufficient based on measurement of serum
25OHD, corrected calcium, PTH, and potentially 24-hour urinary
calcium. Indeed, this population is particularly at risk of severe
hypocalcemia after administration of potent antiresorptive
therapy.(122) The parenteral route is preferred because of
concerns about adequate absorption and potential anastomotic
ulceration with oral bisphosphonates.
Research Agenda
Although research addressing bone health after bariatric
surgery is growing, there are still many knowledge gaps to be
filled. Questions remain unanswered about the nature of
bariatric surgery’s skeletal effects. These include questions
about the impact of individual bariatric procedures on fracture
risk; fracture risk among particular populations such as men,
postmenopausal women, older adults in general, and adoles-
cents; and long-term postoperative changes in bone mass and
microarchitecture. Now that SG and RYGB are the predominant
bariatric procedures performed, it will be important for the fully
informed decision-making of patients and providers alike, as
well as for effective postoperative care, to understand the
relative effects of the two procedures on skeletal health. Future
studies should include measures of bone quality and strive to
minimize confounding in the radiographic assessment of BMD
during marked weight loss. Questions also remain about the
mechanisms underlying bone loss and fracture risk after bariatric
surgery, as an understanding of mechanism is important for the
development of appropriate preventive and treatment strate-
gies. In particular, the roles of gut-secreted hormones, marrow
fat, and the gut microbiome should be investigated further.
Finally, numerous clinical questions must be addressed. These
include questions about the doses and types of calcium and
vitamin D supplements to use based on type of surgery;
recommended protein intake; and type and extent of physical
activity to prescribe. Additional research is necessary to
determine the best clinical use of DXA (or QCT) before or after
bariatric surgery. Moreover, rigorous randomized controlled
trials are needed to determine whether current osteoporosis
pharmacologic therapies and emerging therapies such as anti-
sclerostin antibodies are effective and safe to treat osteoporosis
in this population, and whether use of these agents in high-risk
patients without osteoporosis might mitigate the detrimental
skeletal effects of bariatric surgery.
