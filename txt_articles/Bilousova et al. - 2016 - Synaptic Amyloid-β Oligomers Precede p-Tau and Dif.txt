Amyloid-b (Ab) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregates form the two discrete pathologies of
Alzheimer disease (AD), and oligomeric assemblies of each protein are localized to synapses. To
determine the sequence by which pathology appears in synapses, Ab and p-tau were quantified across
AD disease stages in parietal cortex. Nondemented cases with high levels of AD-related pathology were
included to determine factors that confer protection from clinical symptoms. Flow cytometric analysis of
synaptosome preparations was used to quantify Ab and p-tau in large populations of individual synaptic
terminals. Soluble Ab oligomers were assayed by a single antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay. Total in situ Ab was elevated in patients with early- and late-stage AD dementia, but not
in high pathology nondemented controls compared with age-matched normal controls. However, sol-
uble Ab oligomers were highest in early AD synapses, and this assay distinguished early AD cases from
high pathology controls. Overall, synapse-associated p-tau did not increase until late-stage disease in
human and transgenic rat cortex, and p-tau was elevated in individual Ab-positive synaptosomes in
early AD. These results suggest that soluble oligomers in surviving neocortical synaptic terminals are
associated with dementia onset and suggest an amyloid cascade hypothesis in which oligomeric Ab
drives phosphorylated tau accumulation and synaptic spread. These results indicate that antiamyloid
therapies will be less effective once p-tau pathology is developed. (Am J Pathol 2016, 186: 185e198;

A large body of evidence indicates that soluble oligomers of
amyloid-b (Ab) are the primary toxic peptides that initiate
downstream tau pathology in the amyloid cascade hypoth-
esis of Alzheimer disease (AD).1,2 However, the time course
and severity of AD dementia have been generally found to
correlate with neurofibrillary tangle development rather than
plaque appearance,3e8 although a few studies have linked
plaques with early cognitive decline.9e12 Soluble oligomeric

 Ab has been highlighted as the primary toxin for loss of
dendritic spines and synaptic function13 and has also been
directly linked to downstream tau pathology. For example,
suppression of a tau kinase pathway can prevent Ab42
oligomer-induced dendritic spine loss,14 and injection of
Ab42 fibrils into mutant tau mice induces neurofibrillary
tangles in cell bodies retrograde to the injections.15 In vivo,
effects of Ab oligomers versus fibrils are harder to separate;
however, lowering soluble Ab oligomers by halving besite
amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme reduces
accumulation and phosphorylation of wild-type tau in a
mouse model.16 Evidence for Ab and tau association is
particularly strong in the dendritic compartment, where tau
was shown to mediate Ab toxicity via linkage of fyn to
downstream N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor toxicity.17
The earliest cognitive losses in AD have long been thought
to correlate with synapse loss.8,18e21 In humans, electron
microscopic studies have documented synapse-associated Ab
and tau,22,23 and much work documents activity-dependent
release of synaptic Ab into interstitial fluid, which drives
local Ab deposition in human subjects and in rodents.4,24,25 Of
importance, most synapse-associated Ab in cortical synapses
of AD patients consists of soluble oligomeric species,26 and
synaptic tau pathology in AD also includes accumulations of
SDS-stable tau oligomers.27e31 With the use of synaptosomes
(resealed nerve terminals) from the cortex of postmortem
human subjects and a transgenic rat model of AD, the present
experiments were aimed at determining the sequence of
appearance of Ab and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) pa-
thology in synaptic terminals. In addition to early- and late-
stage disease, the AD samples included nondemented high
pathology controls (HPCs) with substantial AD-related pa-
thology. Synaptic accumulation of Ab occurred in the earliest
plaque stages, before the appearance of synaptic p-tau, which
did not appear until late-stage disease. Soluble Ab oligomers
in synaptic terminals were elevated in early AD cases
compared with HPCs, indicating an association with the onset
of a dementia diagnosis.
Materials and Methods
Materials
The monoclonal anti-Ab antibody 10G4 is an N-terminal
antibody with an epitope directed at residues 5 to 1732; reac-
tivity against human and rodent Ab was previously reported.33
The anti-tau Ser396/404 phosphospecific PHF-1 antibody was
a generous gift from Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, Bronx, NY). The conformation-dependent anti-Ab
antibodies (prefibrillar oligomer-specific M55 and fibril-
specific M116) were a generous gift from Charles G. Glabe
(University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA). The following
antibodies were purchased: antiesynaptosomal-associated
protein, 25 kDa (SNAP-25; Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc.,
Lutherville, MD), 4G8 anti-Ab (Senentek, Napa, CA), HT-7
anti-tau (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), pS422 anti-tau
Ser 422 phosphospecific (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and
anti-synaptophysin (clone SY38) antibody (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA). All isotype control mouse and rabbit IgG were
purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Recombinant
Ab-40 peptide was purchased from US PEPTIde (Rancho
Cucamonga, CA). Zenon isotype-specific IgG labeling kits,
Alexa 488-conjugated chicken anti-mouse and Alexa
594-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG were purchased
from

Femto substrate, and bicinchoninic acid protein assay
kit were from Thermo Scientific, (Rockford, IL). 3,30,5,50-
Tetramethylbenzidine substrate was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Human Brain Specimens
Brain autopsy samples of parietal (A39 and A40), superior
parietal (A7), and entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were
obtained from the University of California Los Angeles
(UCLA), University of Southern California, and University
of California Irvine AD Research Centers. A total of 46
samples (25 women and 21 men) were used and were
classified into groups on the basis of both clinical and
pathologic criteria. Controls included four samples from
cognitively normal elderly controls, two samples from spi-
nocerebellar ataxia type II patients; 16 samples were from
individuals without a clinical history of dementia but with
histopathologic signs of AD-related pathology (HPCs);
some of these subjects were cognitively impaired. Twenty-
four samples were from individuals that were clinically
demented and histopathologically diagnosed with AD; for
the purpose of histologic staging, cases were classed as early
versus late AD with the use of the Braak stage assignment.
The mean age was 82 years for AD cases, and 90 years for
normal and HPC cases. The mean postmortem interval was
6.9 hours for AD cases and 7 hours for normal and HPC
cases. Detailed information about individual cases is pre-
sented in Table 1. For cryopreservation, samples were
minced and slowly frozen in isotonic sucrose on the day of
autopsy as previously described33; the same protocols were
used at each of the three institutions that provided samples.
Animals
We used a transgenic rat model of AD described pre-
viously.34e36 These animals are homozygous for the
following three gene constructs: i) human APP 695 with the
K670N/M671L mutation (rat synapsin-1 promoter); ii)
human APP minigene with the K670N/M671L and V717F
mutations (platelet-derived growth factor b promoter); and
iii) human presenilin-1 with the M146V mutation (rat
synapsin-1 promoter). This model exhibits age-associated
Ab pathology, with sparse hippocampal plaques seen by 9

 months of age, and widespread cortical plaques seen by 18
to 20 months of age. Breeding pairs were obtained from
Cephalon Inc. (West Chester, PA) and were bred and aged at
the UCLA School of Medicine vivarium facility. Wild-type
Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and kept at the UCLA
School of Medicine vivarium facility before the experiments.
All animals were housed under 12-hour light/dark cycle and
had access to standard rat chow ad libitum. Animals were
sacrificed at 3, 9, and 20 months of age, and their brains were
dissected. Frontal cortex and association cortex (parietal,
somatosensory, motor, and visual cortex, denoted as mixed
cortex) were cryopreserved and processed to synaptosome-
enriched fractions. All animal experiments were conducted
in compliance with the guidelines of the UCLA Chancellor’s
Animal Research Committee.
Flow Cytometric Analysis of Synaptosome-Enriched
P-2 Fraction
P-2 fractions (synaptosome-enriched fractions) were prepared
from cryopreserved brain tissue as described previously,37
cryopreserved in 0.32 mol/L buffered sucrose solution and
stored at �80�C as aliquots. On the day of the experiment,
aliquots were quickly defrosted at 37�C, and P-2 pellets were
collected
by
centrifugation.
After
fixation
in
0.25%
paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1 hour at
4�C), and permeabilization in 0.2% Tween20/PBS solution
(15 minutes at 37�C), the pellets were incubated with Ab or
tau/p-tauespecific antibodies, directly labeled with Alexa
488 or Alexa 647 fluorochromes with the use of Zenon
isotype-specific labeling kits (30 minutes at room tempera-
ture). Immunolabeled P-2 pellets were washed with 0.2%
Tween20/PBS and resuspended in 500 mL PBS for flow
cytometric analysis. Data were acquired with the use of a
BD-FACS Calibur analytical flow cytometer (Becton-Dick-
inson, San Jose, CA) equipped with argon 488 nm, helium-
neon 635 nm, and helium-cadmium 325 nm lasers. Debris
was excluded by establishing a size threshold set on forward
light scatter. A total of 10,000 particles were collected and
analyzed for each sample; an additional 5000 Ab-positive
particles were collected for experiments that investigated
Ab-positive synaptosomes. Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 were
detected by FL-1 (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and FL-4
(allophycocyanin) channel photomultiplier tubes, respec-
tively. Analysis was performed with the use of FCS Express
software version 3 (DeNovo Software, ON, Canada).
Confocal Microscopy
Cryopreserved P-2 fractions were defrosted, fixed, and per-
meabilized as described in the section above. Fixed P-2 frac-
tions were incubated with primary mouse anti-synaptophysin
and
conformation-dependent
rabbit
anti-Ab
prefibrillar
oligomer-specific M55 or anti-Ab fibril-specific M116 anti-
bodies in 2% fetal bovine serum/PBS solution (2 hours at room
temperature), followed by washing with 0.2%Tween20/PBS
solution and incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated chicken
anti-mouse and Alexa 594-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG
secondary (1 hour at room temperature). After washing,
immunolabled P-2 fractions were dispersed with a pipette and
spread on slides. Slides were dried, coverslipped with Vecta-
shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlin-
game, CA), and stored at 4�C. Confocal fluorescence and
differential interference contrast images of synaptosomes were
performed with the use of a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal micro-
scope (Heidelberg, Germany) with 63� oil immersion
objective (numerical aperture 1.2). The Alexa Fluor 488 and
594 fluorescent signals were captured with the use of
sequential line scanning with double excitation of 488-nm line
from argon laser and 594-nm line from helium-neon laser.
Confocal pinhole was set to 1 Airey unit.
Oligomeric and Total Ab ELISA
To measure concentrations of the soluble Ab oligomers in
human and rat synaptosome-enriched P-2 fractions, we
developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) with the use of the same monoclonal anti-Ab
antibody (10G4) as both the capture and reporter antibodies.
High-bind 96-well ELISA plates were coated with unlabeled
10G4 antibody in 0.1 mol/L carbonate buffer, pH 9.6
(overnight at 4�C), followed by blocking with 4% bovine
serum albumin in PBS (4 hours at room temperature). A
7-point standard curve (range from 1.95 to 125 ng/mL)
(Supplemental Figure S1A) was constructed with the use of
photochemically cross-linked synthetic Ab40 oligomers,
which were described previously.38 The cross-linked olig-
omer
standards
remained
stable
in
0.1% 1,1,1,3,3,3-
hexafluoro-2-proponol (Supplemental Figure S1A), and
the assay did not detect monomeric Ab (in 0.1% 1,1,1,3,3,3-
hexafluoro-2-proponol) (Supplemental Figure S1B). Speci-
ficity of the assay for oligomeric Ab species was also
confirmed by measuring Ab oligomer concentration in the
presence
of
the
excess
amount
of
monomeric
Ab
(Supplemental Figure S1B). The assay’s limit of detection
was calculated as 7.48 ng/mL; the limit of quantitation was
20.63 ng/mL. Soluble P-2 fractions were extracted by
sonication in PBS with protease inhibitors and then spun at
100,000 � g for 30 minutes. The supernatant fluid was
collected and used for the ELISA. Samples and standards
were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and
loaded into plates in duplicate (overnight at 4�C). After
washing with PBS, biotinylated 10G4 antibody was
applied (overnight at 4�C). The next day, plates were
washed
with
PBS
and
incubated
with
streptavidin-
horseradish peroxidase (1 hour at room temperature).
The
immunocomplex
was
reacted
with
3,30,5,50-
tetramethylbenzidine substrate and was detected with the
use of a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). Concentrations of Ab oligomers in sam-
ples were calculated from the standard curve.
Bilousova et al
188
ajp.amjpathol.org - The American Journal of Pathology
 Total Ab levels were measured with the use of a sand-
wich ELISA as described previously.39 Concentrations of
Ab oligomers and total Ab in each sample were normalized
against the total protein concentration measured with the use
of Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0 for Mac
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Comparisons of Ab and tau
indices in human tissue between different neuropathologic
stages of AD were analyzed by one-way analysis of vari-
ance. Additional post hoc comparisons were performed with
Tukey’s test, when applicable. Comparisons of Ab and tau
indices between transgenic and wild-type rat tissue of
different ages were analyzed with unpaired t-tests. Associ-
ations between Ab plaque density and total or oligomeric
synaptic Ab levels were analyzed with Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient. Comparisons of synaptic p-tau levels
between the overall pool of synaptosomes and the Ab-
positive subset were conducted with paired t-tests.
Results
Total in Situ Synaptic Ab Is Associated with Plaque
Level in Parietal Cortex
To study synaptic Ab pathology across disease stage, syn-
aptosomes (resealed nerve terminals) were prepared from
human parietal cortex samples cryopreserved at the time of
autopsy; tissue was finely minced in isotonic sucrose, fol-
lowed by slow freezing. Synaptosomes are primarily pre-
synaptic
and
contain
mitochondria,
endosomes,
and
exocytotic structures40; some postsynaptic elements are also
present, with approximately 36% of particles positive for
postsynaptic density protein 95.37 Comparison of synapto-
somal proteins with proteins in undisturbed brain slices has
shown that synaptic bouton protein composition is main-
tained in synaptosomes.41 Demographic and neuropatho-
logic data for the normal control, HPC, and AD cases are
shown in Table 1. HPCs indicated substantial Ab and/or tau
pathology but did not meet clinical criteria for dementia.
Using flow cytometry to focus the analysis on a large and
pure population of synaptic terminals within the P-2 fraction,
we first measured synaptic Ab levels across disease stages in
human samples. To label intracellular antigens, samples were
first lightly fixed, then permeabilized before immunolabeling
with the N-terminal antibody 10G4; therefore total synaptic
terminal Ab accumulation was measured in situ. Note that the
protocol for fixation and immunolabeling includes multiple
washes of the pellet in large volumes of PBS with 0.2%
Tween, which would be expected to remove adherent arti-
factual Ab. In addition, incubation of P-2 samples with a
combination of trypsin and heparinase before fixation did not
reduce synaptic Ab labeling (Supplemental Figure S2, A and
B). Previous work has shown that Ab-positive synaptosomes
are also SNAP-25 positive, and, therefore, not Ab aggre-
gates.42 In addition, preaggregated Ab does not show up on
flow dot plots,43 and synaptosomes physically sorted on size
show a uniform population of spherical particles without
visible artifacts.44
Representative dot plots from the flow cytometric anal-
ysis are shown in Figure 1; Ab immunofluorescence is
plotted against forward scatter, which is proportional to
particle size. Two variables are reported for the fluorescence
of each sample: the size of the positive fraction (% positive)
and the brightness of fluorescence (relative fluorescence
unit). For each experiment, background labeling was
determined with an isotype control antibody (Figure 1A),
and positive control samples were immunolabeled for the
presynaptic
docking
protein
SNAP-25
(Figure
1B).
Figure 1B shows the purity of the synaptosomal population
examined (approximately 95%) when the rectangular anal-
ysis gate, based on size standards, is drawn to include only

are routinely collected from this size-based (forward scatter)

population.
We
have

10G4
immunolabeling of synaptosomes and compared it with
other Ab and APP antibodies; in contrast to 10G4, the APP
antibody 3E9 strongly labels most synaptosomes in both
control and AD samples. The bright-specific flow cyto-
metric signal of 10G4 also contrasts with the poorer flow
cytometric results with the use of 6E10, which does not
label synaptosomes in situ above background, despite
mapping to a similar epitope. Like 10G4, MOAB2, a new
monoclonal antibody specific for intraneuronal Ab that does
not label APP,45 shows a strong specific signal for synaptic
Ab with flow cytometric analysis (Supplemental Figure S2,
CeE). Taken together with evidence from Western blot
analysis that 10G4 strongly labels high molecular weight
aggregates, SDS-stable oligomers, and monomer in a pattern
that resembles labeling by an Ab42-specific antibody,26
these results indicate that, for flow cytometry, 10G4 is se-
lective for aggregated Ab in situ. This interpretation is also
supported by recent work showing that sequence-specific

 anti-Ab antibodies are sensitive to conformation and
differentially label aggregated Ab preparations.46
As previously reported, synaptic terminals from control cases
show little to no Ab immunolabeling (Figure 1C)26,33,42,47;
representative plots from AD cases illustrate the rise in synaptic
Ab with increasing neuropathologic disease stage and the de-
gree to which synaptic terminal Ab increases between plaque
stage 0 (no plaque deposition) and stage C (end-stage plaque
deposition) (Figure 1, D and E).48
Figure 2A shows group differences in aggregate flow
cytometric data [F(3,30) Z 6.13, P Z 0.002] in both
early-stage (Braak II to IV) and late-stage (Braak V to VI)
AD cases. Total in situ Ab level was increased above the
control and HPC groups (P< 0.05), which were not
different from each other. When all cases in the present
study are plotted by assigned neurofibrillary tangle and
plaque stages (Figure 2B), the AD cases primarily cluster
in the highest stage, and cognitively/neuropathologically
normal control cases cluster in the lowest stage for both
pathologies. However, the HPC cases are distributed
across the four plaque stages, ranging from sparse to heavy
plaque burden. The total in situ Ab level measured by flow
cytometry was highly correlated with the plaque score
assigned by the pathologist for parietal cortex, which was
taken from the neuropathology report. The correlation was
strong when all cases were included in the analysis
(rs Z 0.67, P < 0.001) (Figure 2C) and when the HPC
group was analyzed alone (rs Z 0.68, P Z 0.015)
(Figure 2D). The progressive increase in total soluble
synaptic Ab across disease stages was confirmed bio-
chemically by ELISA [F(3,18) Z 4.91, P Z 0.01]
(Figure 2E) of the P-2 samples. These results indicate that
in situ synaptic Ab is associated with the local appearance
of neuritic plaques, particularly in HPC samples.
To confirm that flow cytometric increases are not related
to APP, Western blot analysis of SDS-PAGE with the 6E10
antibody show large increases in Ab monomer and lesser
changes in small (<50 kDa) oligomers with neuropatho-
logic disease stage in P-2 fractions from parietal cortex
(Figure 2F). Some of these bands may also represent APP
fragments that contain the 6E10 epitope. Some oligomers
between 10 and 100 kDa did not change with disease stage,
particularly a tetrameric peptide. This result is consistent
with previous work showing that the Ab42 tetramer struc-
ture is likely to be stable and long-lived and serves as a
module for formation of larger Ab assemblies.49 A promi-
nent set of bands at approximately 55 kDa seems likely to
include Ab*56.50
Synapse-Associated Soluble Oligomers Are Associated
with Onset of Dementia
In the same groups of staged parietal cortex samples, we also
measured soluble Ab oligomers (oAb) in synaptosome-
enriched P-2 fractions by ELISA. This assay, based on pro-
tocols developed recently by others,51e55 used the same
antibody (10G4) for capture and detection and cross-linked
oligomeric Ab40 for the standards. Synaptic oAb was
markedly elevated in the early AD group relative to the
neuropathologically normal (P Z 0.01) and HPC (P Z 0.05)
groups [F(3,30) Z 4.13, P Z 0.015] (Figure 2G). oAb was
also numerically higher in early AD than in late AD
(71.3 � 29 ng/mg protein), but this difference did not reach
significance
after
adjusting
for

comparisons
(P Z 0.096). In contrast to total in situ Ab measured by flow
cytometry, parietal cortex oAb did not correlate with Ab
plaque counts from neuropathology reports (data not shown).
The sharp oAb elevation in early AD cases suggests that the
clinical syndrome of AD dementia may emerge once the level

 of synapse-associated soluble oligomers exceeds a certain
threshold.
To confirm that synaptic Ab is oligomeric, P-2 samples
were immunolabeled with conformation-dependent mono-
clonal antibodies and spread on slides for confocal micro-
scopy. These novel monoclonal antibodies were derived
from the well-characterized polyclonal A11 (prefibrillar
oligomers) and OC antibodies (fibrillar oligomers); only the
fibril-specific antibody M116 labels Ab deposits in the AD
brain.56 Characterization of these antibodies has shown a
number of distinct subtypes within the prefibrillar and
fibrillar classes of Ab oligomers, illustrating the diversity of
Ab oligomers in the AD brain.46,57 A subset of spheroid AD
synaptosomes showed diffuse labeling for both prefibrillar
(antibody M55) (Figure 3, AeD) and fibrillar Ab oligomers
(antibody M116) (Figure 3, EeH), indicating structural
heterogeneity in Ab oligomers within terminals.
Progression of Total in Situ Synaptic Ab and oAb in
a Transgenic Rat Model of AD
Because animal models are widely used to examine pathol-
ogy and to test therapies, particularly amyloid pathology, we
next examined progression of synaptic Ab pathology in a
transgenic rat model of AD expressing two familial muta-
tions and one familial presenilin-1 mutation. Representative
plots from the flow cytometric analysis show little Ab
immunolabeling (approximately 10% to 18% positive) in
mixed cortex from wild-type animals at all ages (not shown)
and in 3- and 9-month-old transgenic animals (Figure 4, A
and B). However, in 20-month-old transgenic animals,
fluorescence for total synaptic Ab increased approximately
fourfold in a representative mixed cortex sample (Figure 4C).
The aggregate flow cytometric data for the animal ex-
periments are shown in Figure 4, D and E, which confirm
the huge synaptic amyloid burden at 20 months in both
mixed cortex [t(15) Z �8.89, P < 0.001] and frontal cortex
[t(18) Z �10.00, P < 0.001].
Corresponding to human results, the ELISA for soluble
oAb (Figure 4F) in transgenic rat P-2 samples also shows
age and genotype effects with significant elevations in each
age group, beginning at 3 months [age: F(2,53) Z 44.10,
P < 0.001; genotype: F(1,35) Z 54.13, P < 0.001;
age � genotype interaction: F(2,35) Z 44.06, P < 0.001].
Importantly, subtle cognitive deficits are already detectable
by 3 months of age in this model.
Synaptic p-Tau Is Not Elevated until Late-Stage AD
in Parietal Cortex
Because tau and p-tau oligomers may contribute to synaptic
dysfunction and loss,8,27,29,58 we next examined timing of the
appearance of synaptic p-tau for disease stage and amyloid
pathology using the set of staged human samples, including
nondemented HPCs. P-2 samples were immunolabeled for
tau with the use of three antibodies: one directed against total
tau (HT7) and two specific for p-tau (PHF-1 and pS422). The
same immunolabeling protocols described above for flow

 cytometric analysis of synaptic Ab were used; therefore, re-
sults likewise represent in situ tau associated with synaptic
boutons. As noted above for Ab in dual-labeled P-2 samples
virtually all p-tau positives are also SNAP-25 positive, ruling
out tangle remnants as artifacts (data not shown). Represen-
tative flow cytometric plots highlight the relatively low level
of p-tau fluorescence in individual synaptosomes for PHF-1
until late-stage disease (Figure 5, AeC). Aggregate plots of
the data across disease stages confirm that tau immuno-
fluoresence is not increased until late-stage AD for all three
antibodies examined [HT7 (total tau): F(3,30) Z 9.67,
P < 0.001) (Figure 5D), [PHF-1 (p-tau)]: F(3,30) Z 8.08,
P < 0.001] (Figure 5E), and [pS422 (p-tau): F(3,30) Z 10.95,
P < 0.001] (Figure 5F). HT7 antibody labels both phos-
phorylated and nonphosphorylated (total) tau; therefore, p-tau
likely accounts for the increased HT7 fluorescence in late-
stage AD (Figure 5D).
Although overall synaptic p-tau level in the parietal cortex is
not elevated until late-stage AD, some cases found relatively
high levels of synaptic p-tau in the parietal cortex in early-
stage neurofibrillary disease. Figure 5G shows representative
flow cytometric data for one such Braak III case with high
p-tau fluorescence in parietal cortex. No apparent association
was found between higher p-tau levels and mixed pathology in
the present study. These data indicate that, in some circum-
stances, advanced neocortical synaptic tau pathology may be
seen in early-stage disease, before the cortical deposition of
NFTs.

 pathology, and several groups, including ours, have localized
p-tau to synapses in such animal models.22,33,59 With the use of
cryopreserved cortex samples from the same transgenic rat age
groups as above (3, 9, and 20 months), we investigated the
association of synaptic p-tau with disease stage and amyloid
pathology. P-2 samples were immunolabeled for p-tau; flow
cytometric analyses are illustrated in Figure 6, AeC and show
a representative increase in synaptic PHF-1 fluorescence in
transgenic relative to wild-type animals at 20 months.
Aggregate group data are shown in Figure 6D. Synaptic
PHF-1 labeling only found significant genotype differences at
20 months of age [t(13) Z �3.01, P Z 0.010]. However, no
genotype effects were seen for synaptic pS422 labeling. These
findings are consistent with human results above; however,
as previously observed in mouse models with only Ab
mutations,60,61 synaptic p-tau pathology in this rat model is
less robust than that seen above in human disease.
P-Tau Immunolabeling Is Elevated in Individual
Ab-Positive Synaptosomes in Early AD
If early synaptic Ab accumulation drives tau phosphorylation
within terminals, synaptic p-tau should be higher in the
population of terminals positive for Ab. To test this hy-
pothesis, we dual-labeled human parietal cortex P-2 samples
for Ab (10G4) and p-tau (PHF-1), and used flow cytometry to
collect data from Ab-positive synaptosomes (5000 per sam-
ple). This experiment used cases with early-stage disease
(Braak II to III), in which the mean synaptic p-tau level was
not different from controls (Figure 5); we also included
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex samples as regions that
are affected earlier by tau pathology. Figure 7, AeC, illus-
trates the analysis for a single dual-labeled sample; Figure 7A
shows the total PHF-1-positive fraction (10,000 events), and
Figure 7B shows the analysis gate for collection of Ab-
positive terminals in the same sample (5000 events); note that
for this analysis strategy only data from the Ab-positives
were saved. P-tau immunofluorescence increased from 8.9%
in the total sample (Figures 7A) to 21.5% when only Ab-
positives were included (Figure 7C). The aggregate data
(Figure 7D) found that p-tau immunofluorescence was
elevated in the Ab-positive fraction relative to the total
sample in all three regions examined, increasing more than
twofold in each region [t(11) Z �6.15, P < 0.001], hippo-
campal [t(6) Z �5.99, P Z 0.001], and entorhinal cortex
[t(5) Z �9.05, P < 0.001].
To further examine the relation, correlation analyses were
performed; despite the increased PHF-1 labeling in Ab-
positives, the PHF-1 level in each sample was not strongly
correlated with the Ab level for parietal cortex across all
disease stages (r Z 0.20, n Z 30; not shown). Reasoning
that terminal accumulation of Ab in mid- and late-stage
disease might obscure a relation, we next included only
parietal cortex samples with early-stage AD (�Braak IV),
which likewise showed no significant association (r Z 0.33,
n Z 20) (Figure 6E). However, early-stage samples from
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, affected earlier in dis-
ease, found a strong correlation (r Z 0.92, n Z 10;
P < 0.0001) (Figure 7F). On the basis of the data presented
earlier, which establishes the early appearance of Ab
compared with p-tau, this association is consistent with Ab-
driven induction of tau phosphorylation in synaptic termi-
nals relatively early in the disease process.

 neuropathologic differences have not been observed be-
tween cognitively intact and demented individuals with
similar levels of AD pathology. On the basis of a working
hypothesis that synaptic pathology may drive clinical
symptoms, the present work used synaptosome preparations
made from cryopreserved samples to focus on changes
within synapses and shows that high levels of soluble am-
yloid oligomers within synaptic terminals are present in
early dementia but not in HPCs, suggesting that clinical
dementia emerges when the Ab oligomers within terminals
reach a certain level. Ab accumulation occurs in the early
stages of AD in the parietal cortex, but tau is not substan-
tially elevated until late-stage disease. However, even in
early-stage disease, p-tau may be elevated in individual Ab-
positive terminals.
The total synaptic Ab measured by flow cytometry in the
present experiments includes all forms of Ab in synaptic
terminals detectable by an N-terminal antibody in situ. In
contrast, the oAb assay measures only oligomeric Ab
extracted from synaptosome-enriched P-2 fractions into
buffer. Because Western blot analysis of P-2 samples shows
a strong signal for postsynaptic density protein 95,26 it is
possible that some of the Ab signal in P-2 samples arises
from extracellular Ab bound to postsynaptic surface re-
ceptors, particularly heparan sulfate proteoglycan.66 How-
ever, prior electron microscopic studies reported by our
group and others document the spherical and primarily
presynaptic structure of synaptosomes,33,40 and incubation
of AD synaptosomes with a combination of trypsin and
heparinase does not reduce Ab labeling. Confirmation of
presynaptic localization of oligomers by electron micro-
scope would be optimal; however, detection of intra-
neuronal, particularly oligomeric, Ab is limited by the
technical difficulty of detecting Ab antigens, which are
hydrophobic and difficult to detect by conventional immu-
nocytochemical methods, especially in postmortem tissue.67
On the basis of previous and current results, we posit that
most synaptosomal Ab represents an intraterminal pool
largely localized within endosomal and autophagic vesicles,
consistent with a strong literature showing synaptic release
of Ab25,68,69 and disruption of autophagy in AD.69e72
Relatively few examples in the literature have found
cellular or pathologic factors associated with cognitive
protection in subjects with AD pathology.73 A theory that
altered synaptic structure or function may be a key factor for
protection against AD-related cognitive decline is attractive
for a number of reasons, in part because of the strong as-
sociation of cognitive decline with synapse loss, and
because established AD pathology localizes to either
extracellular (plaques) or somatic (tangles) regions. Along
this line, two groups have recently showed the relative
preservation of synaptic markers in cortex from non-
demented high AD pathology subjects.74,75 One of these
studies included a discovery microarray approach that
identified a number of proteins that are differentially
expressed in such subjects, including APP binding protein
and regulators of apoptosis, trafficking, cytoskeletal struc-
ture, and cell-cycle proteins.74 Work by Perez-Nievas et al75
showed more fibrillar and oligomer-positive Ab plaques,
increased p-tau oligomers, and glial activation in demented
compared with nondemented subjects with underlying AD
pathology. In another study, low molecular weight SDS-
stable Ab oligomers were associated with the postsynaptic
density in patients with Alzheimer dementia but not in
nondemented HPCs.76 Results are mixed for soluble Ab
oligomers in cortical homogenates, but increased oligomers
were reported in demented compared with HPC cases.51 Our
data come from synaptosome-enriched P-2 fractions with
membrane cryopreservation, which would be expected to
retain soluble oligomers; this is in contrast to typical ho-
mogenate samples, which are more dilute and represent
multiple cell types and cellular compartments. In the present
experiments, the concentration of synaptic oligomers was
the only Ab measure to distinguish HPCs from early de-
mentia cases. Although noting that this study is based on a
relatively small set of cases, this observation signals an
association between synaptic Ab oligomers and clinical
diagnoses of dementia.
The correlation between total in situ synaptic Ab and
local plaque levels in the parietal cortex could be explained
by accumulation of insoluble Ab deposits in two sinks: an
extracellular one in plaques and an intraterminal one within
endosomes/autophagic vacuoles. After eventual loss and
degradation of the synaptic terminal, the insoluble synaptic
vacuole pool would then serve as a seed for a new extra-
cellular deposit. This explanation would be consistent with
our observation of a (nonsignificant) reduction of oAb in
late-stage compared with early-stage disease and with the
view that amyloid plaques are predominately a sink rather
than a source for soluble Ab.2 However, plaques could still
serve as local reservoirs for small oligomers, operating with
a dynamic equilibrium.77 For the oAb assay, note that the
sandwich ELISA may detect multiple Ab molecules bound
to an unrelated carrier protein such as a proteoglycan; this
possibility should be somewhat mitigated by the use of an
aqueous soluble fraction without membranes or membrane
fragments.
Because tau aggregates can transfer from one cell to
another, some p-tau in synapses may enter from the extra-
cellular compartment.78,79 However, considered together
with the early appearance of Ab relative to p-tau, the
marked increase in p-tau in individual Ab-positive synapses
is consistent with a hypothesis that p-tau induction is
directly driven by synaptic oAb; synaptic p-tau may then
lead to anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic spread of
tau pathology. Such a hypothesis is supported by the
following multiple lines of evidence: i) the exclusive initial
appearance of Ab in the neocortex before dementia onset,
which has extensive reciprocal projections with hippocam-
pus and entorhinal cortex48,80; ii) the well-established
regional propagation of tau pathology in human disease
and animal models79,81e83; iii) the observation that low

 levels of dimeric oAb from the AD cortex are sufficient for
induction of tau phosphorylation and beaded dystrophic
neurites84; and iv) evidence to indicate tau intracellular
protein misfolding can be transmitted by direct protein-
protein contact.78 Indeed, such a prion-like mechanism of
endogenous templated protein corruption was suggested as a
common mechanism for multiple neurodegenerative dis-
eases.85 Additional Ab-mediated mechanisms may also
contribute to propagation of AD pathology; for example,
oligomer binding to membrane lipids or to a7 nicotinic
cholinergic receptors might modulate the downstream
signaling.84,86,87
Our results suggest that effective therapies will need to
target synaptic Ab oligomers and that antiamyloid therapies
will be much less effective once synaptic p-tau pathology
has developed, thus providing a potential explanation for the
failure of amyloid-based trials. An additional important
clinical implication is that therapies slowing Ab oligomer
accumulation in the synaptic compartment will delay onset
of dementia. Clarifying the precise mechanisms by which
soluble Ab oligomers induce p-tau induction and contribute
to synaptic dysfunction in early dementia is an important
next step; the correspondence between our human and an-
imal data suggest that this and related animal models will be
useful for understanding the progress of synaptic pathology
and for developing therapies to protect synaptic terminals.
