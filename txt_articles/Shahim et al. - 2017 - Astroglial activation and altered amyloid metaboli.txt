Astroglial activation and altered amyloid
metabolism in human repetitive
concussion
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether postconcussion syndrome (PCS) due to repetitive concussive
traumatic brain injury (rcTBI) is associated with CSF biomarker evidence of astroglial activation,
amyloid deposition, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) impairment.
Methods: A total of 47 participants (28 professional athletes with PCS and 19 controls) were
assessed with lumbar puncture (median 1.5 years, range 0.25–12 years after last concussion),
standard MRI of the brain, and Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).
The main outcome measures were CSF concentrations of astroglial activation markers (glial
fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and YKL-40), markers reflecting amyloid precursor protein
metabolism (Ab38, Ab40, Ab42, sAPPa, and sAPPb), and BBB function (CSF:serum albumin
ratio).
Results: Nine of the 28 athletes returned to play within a year, while 19 had persistent PCS .1
year. Athletes with PCS .1 year had higher RPQ scores and number of concussions than athletes
with PCS ,1 year. Median concentrations of GFAP and YKL-40 were higher in athletes with PCS
.1 year compared with controls, although with an overlap between the groups. YKL-40 corre-
lated with RPQ score and the lifetime number of concussions. Athletes with rcTBI had lower
concentrations of Ab40 and Ab42 than controls. The CSF:serum albumin ratio was unaltered.
Conclusions: This study suggests that PCS may be associated with biomarker evidence of
astroglial activation and b-amyloid (Ab) dysmetabolism in the brain. There was no clear evidence
of Ab deposition as Ab40 and Ab42 were reduced in parallel. The CSF:serum albumin ratio was
unaltered, suggesting that the BBB is largely intact in PCS. Neurology® 2017;88:1400–1407

Concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) (concussive TBI [cTBI]) caused by
rapid rotational acceleration of the head, which causes the brain to deform, resulting in tissue
damage, particularly to vulnerable white matter axons.1 While most individuals with cTBI
recover completely within days to weeks, about 10%–15% of individuals display persistent
neurobehavioral symptoms for more than 3 months, a condition referred to as postconcussion
syndrome (PCS).2 A proportion of individuals exposed to repetitive concussive TBI (rcTBI) may
develop a progressive neurodegenerative condition referred to as chronic traumatic encephalop-
athy (CTE).3,4 CTE is characterized by tau and, less consistently, b-amyloid (Ab) pathology,
which are also histologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD).5,6 Evidence from animal models
and limited clinical studies of moderate to severe TBI suggest that astrogliosis, increased

 inflammatory activity, as well as disruption of
the blood–brain barrier (BBB) are additional
important processes in TBI.7–10
A PCS diagnosis is mainly based on self-
reported clinical symptoms.11 In contrast,
a CTE diagnosis can only be made postmor-
tem.3,4,12,13 Recently, we showed that PCS due
to rcTBI is associated with increased CSF con-
centrations of neurofilament light (NFL).14
Considering the literature on disease mech-
anisms other than axonal injury in cTBI, we
tested the following specific hypotheses: (1)
PCS due to rcTBI is associated with CSF signs
of astroglial activation, (2) PCS due to rcTBI is
associated with CSF signs of amyloid burden,
and (3) rcTBI is associated with impaired
BBB, as reflected by elevated CSF:serum albu-
min ratio. The study was designed in compli-
ance with the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational
Studies
in
Epidemiology
(STROBE) statement.15
METHODS Study population. In this multicenter cross-
sectional study, we enrolled 28 professional athletes (26
professional ice hockey players, 2 professional soccer players)
with PCS following rcTBI and 19 neurologically healthy
controls without a history of concussion between September
2014 and June 2016. The controls were healthy volunteers
(mostly students) without known history of brain trauma or
any other neurologic disease who were recruited through
advertisement at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
Taking into account that only 10%–15% of individuals with
cTBI may develop PCS,2 and of these only a small number of
cases may develop PCS for more than 1 year, the sample size of 28
was considered to be relatively adequate for this pilot study.
Selection of participants. The diagnosis of concussion was
made according to the latest diagnostic guidelines on sports-
related concussion and players with concussion were managed
according to these guidelines.16,17 The diagnosis of PCS was
based on DSM-IV criteria.18 The inclusion criteria were (1)
persistent postconcussion symptoms for more than 3 months
following rcTBI at the time of inclusion in the study, (2)
consent
to
undergo
lumbar
puncture
(LP),
(3)
no
contraindications to LP (normal coagulation parameters, focal
neurologic sign, papilledema, reduced consciousness, infection
at puncture site), and (4) no evidence of structural damage on
conventional MRI
(T1/T2 and
fluid-attenuated
inversion
recovery).
The inclusion criteria for healthy controls were (1) age .18
years, (2) no history of known head trauma, (3) no history of
neurologic or psychological condition, and (4) no contradictions
to LP as stated above. At inclusion and at the end of the study, the
participants underwent neuropsychological assessment with the
Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).19
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The regional ethics committee at the University of
Gothenburg, Sweden, approved the study. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
Biochemical procedures. Blood samples were collected by
venipuncture into gel-separator tubes for serum and centrifuged
within 20–60 minutes. LP was performed in the lateral decubi-
tus position, through L3-L4 or L4-L5, between 10:00 AM and
2:00 PM. Atraumatic 20-G (Sprotte) needles were used for all the
LPs. None of the participants was fasting. A total of 8–10 mL
CSF was collected in a single polypropylene tube from each
participant. The CSF was gently mixed and a cell count was
performed to exclude blood contamination. Thereafter, the
CSF was centrifuged (2,000g at 48C for 10 minutes) and the
supernatant was aliquoted in 0.5 mL portions in polypropylene
screw cap cryo tubes that were stored at 2808C pending analysis.
The participants were examined physically and neurologically
before LP. All were healthy and showed no signs of focal
neurologic injury.
CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration was
measured using a previously described in-house ELISA proce-
dure.20 CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL-40) con-
centration was measured using a commercial ELISA (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). CSF Ab38, Ab40, and Ab42 con-
centrations were measured using the 6E10-based Abeta Triplex
method on a Meso Scale Discovery platform (MSD, Gaithers-
burg, MD). CSF a- and b-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor
protein (sAPPa and sAPPb) concentrations were measured using
sandwich
ELISAs
(IBL
International
GmbH,
Hamburg,
Germany).
All samples were analyzed on one occasion using the same
batch of reagents by board-certified laboratory technicians who
were blind to the clinical information of each individual. CSF
GFAP data for 16 of the 28 patients with PCS due to rcTBI
and 15 of the 19 healthy controls were reported in our previous
study.21
Statistical analysis. We used x2 test to examine differences in
categorical variables between the rcTBI vs the control group. For
the rcTBI vs the control group comparisons, the Mann-Whitney
U test was used. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was
performed for the multiple group comparisons. To examine the
potential influence of age on the results, we also performed
analysis of covariance of log-transformed continuous data with
and without age as a covariate. The Spearman rank correlation
examined the relationship between changes in various biomarker
levels and age, and lifetime concussion events as well as RPQ
score. Partial correlations examined associations between CSF
biomarkers and lifetime concussion and RPQ score, adjusted
for age. We checked model assumptions by inspecting residuals
(normality, histograms, q-q plots, and homogeneity of variance).
All tests were 2-sided and statistical significance was determined
at p , 0.05. Corrections for multiple group comparison were
done using Dunn or Tukey post hoc tests. All statistical
calculations
were
performed
using

between the groups (p 5 0.070 and p 5 0.20, respec-
tively; table). There was no correlation of any of the
markers with age in the control group, while there

 were correlations between age and CSF Ab38, YKL-
40, and sAPPa in the PCS group (r 5 0.43, p 5
0.021; r 5 0.70, p 5 0.001; and r 5 0.45, p 5
0.016, respectively). Correcting for age did not
influence any of the results reported below, except
for YKL-40. The mean time between the most
recent concussion and the LP was 1.5 years (range
0.25–12 years; table). There was no correlation
between the time since the last concussion and CSF
biomarker concentrations (figure e-1 at Neurology.org).
At the end of the study, 9 of the 28 athletes returned to
the game within a year, while 19 of them had persistent
PCS for more than 1 year, which eventually forced them
to retire from the game.
PCS due to rcTBI is associated with biomarker evidence
of astroglial activation. CSF GFAP concentration was
higher in the rcTBI group as compared to the control
group (p 5 0.009; figure 1A); this change was particu-
larly prominent in athletes with PCS .1 year (p 5
0.0015; figure 1B). Similar to GFAP, higher concentra-
tions of CSF YKL-40 were measured in athletes with
persistent PCS compared with controls (p 5 0.049), but
these results were not significant after correcting for
multiple comparisons and age (figure 1, C and D).
PCS due to rcTBI is associated with reduced CSF Ab.
There was no difference in CSF Ab38 concentration
between athletes with rcTBI and controls at either
group or subgroup analysis (figure 2, A and B).
CSF Ab40 and Ab42 concentrations were reduced
in athletes with rcTBI compared with controls (p 5
0.0078 and p 5 0.0009, respectively; figure 2, C and
E). The subgroup of athletes with PCS .1 year had
reduced concentrations of Ab40 and Ab42 as com-
pared to controls (p 5 0.0073 and p 5 0.0018,
respectively), but similar concentrations as compared
to athletes whose PCS resolved within 1 year (figure
2, D and F). The Ab42/Ab40 ratio was lower in
athletes with rcTBI as compared to controls (p 5
0.0005), but did not differ between athletes with
PCS .1 year compared with athletes with PCS ,1
year (p 5 0.90; figure 2, G and H). In addition, we
measured concentrations of CSF sAPPa and sAPPb,
and found no difference at either group or subgroup
level (figure e-2).
CSF:serum albumin ratio in PCS due to rcTBI. CSF:
serum albumin ratios were similar in all examined
groups (figure e-3).
Persistently increased CSF YKL-40 and persistently
decreased Ab over time. One of the athletes with per-
sistent PCS underwent repeated LPs at 5 and 11
months since the last concussion. There were no clear
changes in any of the biomarker concentrations over
this time period (figure e-4).
CSF YKL-40 correlated with symptom severity in PCS
due to rcTBI. As expected, the PCS group had higher
RPQ score (median 13; range 6–35) as compared to
controls (median 0.0; range 0–0, p , 0.0001). Fur-
ther, the subgroup of athletes with PCS .1 year had
higher RPQ scores (median 16.5; range 6–35) as
compared to the athletes whose PCS resolved within
a year (median 8; range 7–16, p 5 0.0009; figure 3A).
CSF YKL-40 concentrations correlated with RPQ
scores after adjusting for age (unadjusted r 5 0.44,
p 5 0.020; adjusted r 5 0.33, p 5 0.090; figure 3B).
There were no relationships between any of the other
biomarkers and RPQ scores (figure e-5).
CSF YKL-40 correlated with lifetime concussion events.
The median lifetime number of concussions in the
rcTBI group was 5.5 (range 2–20) (table). The sub-
group of athletes with PCS .1 year had higher life-
time number of concussions (median 6.0; range 3–
20) than athletes whose PCS resolved within a year
(median 4.0; range 2–7, p 5 0.040; figure 4A). CSF
YKL-40 concentrations correlated with the lifetime
number of concussions (unadjusted r 5 0.51, p 5
0.0054; adjusted r 5 0.40, p 5 0.038; figure 4B).
Further, there was a correlation between sAPPa and
lifetime number of concussions (unadjusted r 5 0.45,
p 5 0.015; adjusted r 5 0.35, p 5 0.071; figure 4C).

 display persistent behavioral, cognitive, and physical
impairment for months, referred to as PCS.2 A pro-
portion of individuals with PCS may have persistent
symptoms beyond months to years, and may develop
progressive neurodegeneration or CTE. However, the
relationship among concussion, PCS, and future
development of CTE is not fully understood. Fur-
ther, it is unknown whether PCS represents ongoing
injury or is a delayed functional outcome following
preexisting injury. There are no established objective
tools to quantify PCS or identify CTE in living hu-
mans, but we recently showed that patients with PCS
due to rcTBI had CSF biomarker evidence of axonal
injury.21
Here, we examined CSF biomarkers reflecting as-
troglial activation, Ab metabolism, and BBB integrity
in professional athletes who had rcTBI and fulfilled
the criteria for PCS. We found that (1) overall, CSF
GFAP concentration was higher in patients with
rcTBI compared with controls, (2) CSF YKL-40
showed similar changes as GFAP; however, CSF
YKL-40 also correlated with RPQ scores and the life-
time number of concussions, (3) CSF concentrations
of Ab40 and Ab42, but not Ab38 or sAPPa/b, were
reduced in the rcTBI group, and the lowest concen-
trations were observed in the subgroup of players with
PCS .1 year, and (4) there were no significant
changes in the CSF:serum albumin ratio.
Trauma to the head may trigger astrogliosis and
microglial activation.22 In this study, we found
increased CSF concentrations of GFAP and YKL-40
in athletes with PCS due to rcTBI. Further, YKL-40
concentration correlated with RPQ score and lifetime
concussion events. These findings are in concordance
with postmortem studies of boxers and military per-
sonnel who had repetitive trauma to the head, show-
ing increased astroglial activation.3,23
Experimental and postmortem case-control stud-
ies suggest that athletes who have been exposed to
repetitive head trauma are at increased risk of devel-
oping brain pathology, such as Ab deposition and
tau pathology.3,4,12,13 In the context of AD, numerous
studies have shown that reduced CSF Ab42 concen-
trations correlate strongly with positive amyloid PET
finding,24 and a recent study also suggests that the
reduction in CSF Ab42 is an earlier indicator of cere-
bral Ab deposition than amyloid PET.25 The findings
that CSF Ab40 and Ab42 concentrations were

 decreased (Ab38 displayed the same trend) in athletes
with PCS due to rcTBI compared with controls, and
that the lowest concentrations were observed in play-
ers with PCS .1 year, who were also forced to retire,
warrant an in-depth discussion. Cerebral Ab deposi-
tion in AD is typified by selective reduction of Ab42
and unaltered concentrations of Ab40 and Ab38.26
In PCS due to rcTBI, we instead observed a general
downregulation of all 3 isoforms, similar to what has
been reported in multiple sclerosis and normal pres-
sure hydrocephalus.27,28 Thus, the results per se do
not indicate cerebral Ab deposition, but rather a more
generalized alteration in the Ab metabolism. The
CSF Ab42/Ab40 ratio was reduced in the PCS
group, but the ratio was still above the cutoff for
amyloid positivity we use in clinical laboratory prac-
tice (0.09) for most of the athletes with PCS. In
addition, we measured concentrations of CSF sAPPa
and sAPPb in order to determine whether the general
downregulation of Ab is due to decreased amyloid
precursor protein (APP) expression or processing.
However, we did not observe any statistically signif-
icant reduction in the concentrations of CSF sAPPa
or sAPPb. Taken together with the Ab data, at this
stage of the disease, this may point towards an alter-
ation of synaptic secretion or g-secretase-mediated
processing of the APP C-terminal fragment, rather
than decreased APP expression or altered a- or b-sec-
retase-mediated APP processing. Another potential
mechanism we cannot rule out is altered clearance
of Ab peptides from the CNS in the PCS group.
Finally, we observed no difference in the concen-
tration of CSF:serum albumin ratio between the ath-
letes with rcTBI and controls. In acute concussion,
CSF:serum albumin ratio is normal, whereas moder-
ate to severe TBI typically has an elevated ratio.9,10
The results suggest that the BBB remains largely
intact in PCS due to rcTBI, although a mild dysfunc-
tion cannot be excluded as higher concentrations
were observed in athletes with PCS .1 year. It should
also be noted that the CSF:serum albumin ratio re-
flects just one aspect of the BBB: the integrity of the
barrier when it comes to restricted passage of
medium-sized proteins.
There are limitations to this study. First, the sam-
ple size is relatively small, which precludes from

 examining the biomarkers in relation to specific as-
pects of PCS, such as behavioral, cognitive, or neuro-
logic changes. Replication of the findings in larger
groups will be important. Second, controls were not
matched to the PCS due to rcTBI group; the best
controls would have been professional athletes with-
out concussion, however, it is difficult to motivate
professional athletes without concussion to undergo
LP. The limited age range of the control group is
another limitation. In addition, conclusions regarding
the precise relationship between rcTBI and PCS can-
not be drawn without including a group of concussed
athletes who did not develop PCS; a longitudinal
study of patients with rcTBI in which PCS is an out-
come is warranted.
The data from this study suggest that PCS due to
rcTBI is associated not only with axonal injury,21 but
also astroglial activation and Ab dysmetabolism,
apparent in CSF months to years after the last con-
cussion. Whereas these results might not have any
immediate clinical implications, they pinpoint astro-
glial activation and altered Ab metabolism as being
involved in PCS due to rcTBI, which may be relevant
to explore further from diagnostic and therapeutic
standpoints. The results also suggest that these bio-
markers should be examined regarding their accuracy
to predict CTE in rcTBI.
