Abstract
Purpose: Approximately one-third of patients with non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring tumors with EGFR-tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitizing mutations (EGFRm) experience
disease progression during treatment due to brain metastases.
Despite anecdotal reports of EGFR-TKIs providing benefit in some
patients with EGFRm NSCLC brain metastases, there is a clinical
need for novel EGFR-TKIs with improved efficacy against brain
lesions.
Experimental Design: We performed preclinical assessments
of brain penetration and activity of osimertinib (AZD9291), an
oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for EGFRm and
T790M resistance mutations, and other EGFR-TKIs in various
animal models of EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases. We
also present case reports of previously treated patients with
EGFRm-advanced NSCLC and brain metastases who received
osimertinib in the phase I/II AURA study (NCT01802632).
Results: Osimertinib demonstrated greater penetration of
the mouse blood–brain barrier than gefitinib, rociletinib
(CO-1686), or afatinib, and at clinically relevant doses induced
sustained tumor regression in an EGFRm PC9 mouse brain
metastases model; rociletinib did not achieve tumor regression.
Under positron emission tomography micro-dosing condi-
tions, [11C]osimertinib showed markedly greater exposure
in the cynomolgus monkey brain than [11C]rociletinib and
[11C]gefitinib. Early clinical evidence of osimertinib activity in
previously treated patients with EGFRm-advanced NSCLC and
brain metastases is also reported.
Conclusions: Osimertinib may represent a clinically signif-
icant treatment option for patients with EGFRm NSCLC and
brain metastases. Further investigation of osimertinib in this
patient population is ongoing. Clin Cancer Res; 22(20); 5130–40.

Introduction
A number of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are
recommended for first-line treatment of patients with advanced
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an EGFR-TKI–
sensitizing mutation (EGFRm; refs. 1, 2). However, more than
30% of patients with NSCLC experience disease progression
during treatment with established EGFR-TKIs due to growth of
synchronous or metachronous brain metastases (3, 4).
For successful treatment of brainmetastases, a drug mustfirst be
able to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). BBB penetration is
influenced by factors such as a drug's affinity for the ATP-binding
cassette efflux transporters, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), and
breast cancer-resistance protein (BCRP), which are involved in
the removal of toxins, drugs, and chemotherapies from the central
nervous system (CNS; refs. 5–9). Chemotherapy agents and
large monoclonal antibodies are generally unable to cross the
BBB (7, 10). The ability of a molecule to cross the BBB is affected
by multiple factors, including molecular weight (11).
Active or untreated brain metastases are often exclusion
criteria in trials of EGFR-TKIs; however, there are reports doc-
umenting efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in treatment of, and/or pre-
venting development of, brain metastases in patients with
EGFRm NSCLC (12–15). In a retrospective analysis of 155
patients, initial gefitinib or erlotinib treatment was associated
with a lower cumulative risk of CNS progression (1%, 6%, and
21% at 6, 12, and 24 months) compared with chemotherapy
(7%, 19%, and 32%, respectively; ref. 12). In addition, pulsatile

 administration of high-dose erlotinib can control CNS metas-
tases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC (16).
Despite reports of tumor responses, the TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib,
and afatinib are considered to have generally poor biopharma-
ceutical properties for penetrating the BBB,perhaps attributable to
interactions with P-gp and BCRP (17–19). However, penetration
may be increased in patients with more advanced brain metas-
tases where BBB disruption has already occurred (20–22). In
addition, there is a cumulative increase in brain metastases
incidence in patients with EGFRm NSCLC over time (23).
Although many patients die of systemic progression, rather than
brain lesion progression, quality of life is significantly worsened,
both directly and as a result of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT),
which degrades cognitive function (24). In addition, as systemic
therapies improve for patients with EGFRm NSCLC, the brain
may increasingly become a sanctuary site where the BBB may offer
protection from pharmacological agents (22). Therefore, there
exists a clinical need for EGFR-TKIs with improved BBB penetra-
tion, and it is important that new mutant-selective agents, such as
osimertinib (AZD9291), an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI
selective for sensitizing and T790M-resistance mutations (25, 26),
and rociletinib (CO-1686; ref. 27), are explored in this context.
Osimertinib was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of
patients with NSCLC harboring a T790M mutation, and whose
disease has progressed following treatment with another EGFR-
TKI (28). We examined the brain exposure and distribution of
osimertinib and the active metabolites AZ5104 and AZ7550 in the
preclinical setting. We compared brain distribution, pharmaco-
kinetics (PK), and in vivo brain xenograft efficacy of osimertinib
with other EGFR-TKIs and simulated potential clinical efficacy
based on these data. Furthermore, brain penetration of radiola-
beled osimertinib and other EGFR-TKIs was examined in a non-
human primate model. We also present early evidence of clinical
efficacy of osimertinib against brain metastases as part of the
ongoing AURA trial (NCT01802632).
Materials and Methods
Test compounds and cell lines
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were
obtained from U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
and Netherlands Cancer Institute [multidrug-resistance protein 1
(MDR1)-MDCK]; Absorption Systems and AstraZeneca (BCRP-
MDCK); ATCC (Caco2). Cells were authenticated during each
experiment by monitoring transepithelial electrical resistance,
and with positive controls. H1975 cells were obtained from ATCC
in 2004, and authenticated by short-tandem repeat analysis in
November 2012. PC9 cells (exon 19 deletion) were obtained in
November 2011 from Akiko Hiraide at Preclinical Sciences R&D,
AstraZeneca, and tested and authenticated by short-tandem repeat
analysis in May 2013.
Details on cell line maintenance and test compounds are
presented as Supplementary Information.
Permeability glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein
substrate assessment
P-gp (also known as MDR1) and BCRP substrate assessments
of osimertinib, AZ7550, AZ5104, rociletinib, afatinib, and erlo-
tinib were performed using transfected MDCK cells (MDR1-
MDCK; BCRP-MDCK) and the Caco2 (colon carcinoma) cell
line. Digoxin, cladribine, and Ko143 10 mmol/L, valspodar
1 mmol/L, and atorvastatin 0.075 mmol/L stock solutions in
DMSO were prepared as positive controls or inhibitors.
Cell monolayers were grown onto collagen-coated, 12-well,
polycarbonate membranes in Costar Transwell plates (1.13 cm2
insert area, 0.4 mm pore size; Corning Life Sciences). Test and
control compound substrate assessments were carried out in
triplicate in each direction (apical [AP]-to-basolateral [BL], and
BL-to-AP), co-dosed with 200 mmol/L Lucifer yellow (LY). Ali-
quots were taken from the test compound receiver compartment
at preselected time points and replaced with an equal volume of
fresh transport buffer. Positive control receiver samples were
taken at 120 minutes. LC/MS-MS was used for analysis of the
test compound, and LY concentration measured using a BMG
microplate reader (excitation 485 nm; emission 540 nm). Donor
sample aliquots were taken at selected time points without
replacement.
Relative efflux ratios of compounds between MDR1-MDCK
or BCRP-MDCK cells, compared with nontransfected MDCK
cells, and co-dosing with 1 mmol/L valspodar or 10 mmol/L
Ko143, were utilized to verify whether test compounds were
P-gp and BCRP substrates, respectively.
For Caco2 drug transport assays, atenolol (low permeability
marker), minoxidil (high permeability marker), and digoxin
(control efflux marker) were prepared in DMSO to a test
concentration of 10 mmol/L. To determine test and control
compound transport rates in AP-to-BL and BL-to-AP directions,
LY 100 mmol/L was run alongside all compounds. Donor
samples were taken at 60 and 120 minutes, and receiver
samples taken additionally at 30 and 60 minutes and replaced
with an equal volume of fresh transport buffer.
Apparent permeability coefficients of test compounds across
Caco2 monolayers was estimated using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)/MS-MS; LY concentrations were mea-
sured using an Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (485 nmol/L
excitation; 530 nmol/L emission).
Rat quantitative whole body autoradiography
Tissue distribution of radioactivity in male partially pig-
mented (Lister-Hooded) rats was determined following a
single oral dose of [14C]osimertinib (4 mg/kg, 7.4 MBq/kg)
as a suspension in aqueous hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
Translational Relevance
There is a clinical need for novel EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) with improved efficacy against brain
lesions. Disease progression due to brain metastases is com-
mon in patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
harboring
tumors
with
EGFR-TKI–sensitizing
mutations
(EGFRm). As such, the exposure and activity in the brain of
osimertinib was analyzed. We present data that indicate that
osimertinib had greater exposure in the brain compared with
some other EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, afatinib, and rociletinib),
and demonstrated activity against EGFRm NSCLC brain
metastases in preclinical models and early clinical reports.
Osimertinib has potential as a pharmacologic treatment for
patients with EGFRm NSCLC and brain metastases and may
provide an important step forward, given the limitations
experienced with existing treatment options.

 [HPMC; 0.5% (w/v)]. Rats were terminated under anesthesia
by cold shock at 0.5, 1, 6, and 24 hours, and 2, 7, 21, and
60 days post-dose. Animals were immersed in a freezing mix-
ture for �30 minutes and subjected to sagittal plane whole
body sectioning (nominal thickness 30 mm). Concentration of
radioactivity in tissues was determined using quantitative
whole body autoradiography (QWBA) by Covance Laborato-
ries Ltd. using a validated image analysis system.
In a separate experiment, the distribution of a single oral
dose of [14C]gefitinib (5 mg/kg, 8.3 MBq/kg) in male Pievald
Virol Glaxo pigmented rats was assessed. [14C]gefitinib was
administered as a suspension in 0.5% HPMC in 0.1% polysor-
bate 80. Rats were terminated by CO2 narcosis at 1, 2, 6, 24, 48,
and 96 hours postdose and frozen and sectioned as above.
Radioactivity was quantified using a Phosphor Imager SF
(Molecular Dynamics).
Brain binding in vitro
Brain tissue from treatment-na€
�ve nude mice was homogenized
with PBS (1:3, w/w), and [3H]osimertinib spiked into the blank
brain homogenate at a 5 mmol/L final concentration. Radioactive
content of spiked brain homogenate was assessed by liquid
scintillation counting (LSC) using Ultima Gold Scintillation
cocktail. Samples were counted for 10 minutes, oruntil 105counts
had accumulated; test compound concentrations were calculated
using the radioactive content of each sample in conjunction with
the specific activity of the material used. Spiked brain homogenate
was dialyzed in triplicate against PBS for 4 hours at 37�C using
Spectra/Por2 equilibrium dialysis membrane discs (molecular
weight cut-off of 12–14 kDa; Spectrum Laboratories Inc.). Ali-
quots of brain homogenate and PBS were assessed by LSC; the free
fraction of test compounds in brain homogenate was calculated
and overall recovery of radioactivity from cells determined. The
free fraction in undiluted brain was determined from these data.
The in vitro brain binding assays of unlabeled osimertinib was
carried out on a HT-Dialysis plate (HTD 96 b, Cat. no. 1006).
Blank brain homogenate (1:3 with Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.4) was
spiked with 5 mmol/L test compound (in triplicate) and dialyzed
(molecular weight cut-off 12–14 kDa) against 100 mmol/L PBS
buffer (pH 7.4), slowly rotated at 37�C for 4 hours. Receiver and
donor aliquots were taken following incubation, and donor
samples further diluted. Paired samples were matrix-matched
with buffer or blank brain homogenate, and precipitated
with cold acetonitrile with internal standard. After centrifuging
at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes, supernatant was diluted with 0.1%
formic acid aqueous solution and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (API
4000; Applied Biosystems).
The in vitro brain binding assay of unlabeled gefitinib was
carried out on a RED device system (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with a semipermeable membrane. Gefitinib 10 mmol/L was
prepared in DMSO, and a 1 mmol/L working solution spiked in
triplicate into blank brain homogenate (1:3 with PBS pH 7.4) to a
5 mmol/L final concentration; the final percentage volume of the
organic solvent was 0.5%. Spiked brain homogenate was dialyzed
against PBS pH 7.4 for 4 hours at 37�Cwith 5%CO2 for 4 hourson
a slowly rotating orbital shaker. Following incubation, a 50 mL
receiver aliquot, and a 5 mL donor aliquot were taken; the donor
sample was diluted with 45 mL of blank brain homogenate. Paired
samples were matrix-matched with buffer or blank brain homog-
enate, mixed for 2 minutes, and precipitated with 150 mL cold
acetonitrile containing internal standard. Samples were centri-
fuged at 4,000 � g for 20 minutes and supernatant diluted 1:2
with distilled water for LC/MS-MS (Waters Xevo TQ).
Mouse PK studies
Osimertinib was administered orally to female CB17 SCID
mice bearing H1975 tumor xenografts at Oncodesign Biotech-
nology. Three mice per dose group and time point received
osimertinib 5 or 25 mg/kg (as suspension in 0.5% HPMC). Mice
were terminated (isoflurane overdose) and blood, brain, and
tumor samples collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours postdose.
Osimertinib 25 mg/kg, gefitinib 6.25 mg/kg, rociletinib 100
mg/kg, or afatinib 7.5 mg/kg were dosed to na€
�ve female nude
mice, with animals terminated (rising CO2 dose) and blood and
brain samples collected at 1, 2, and 6 hours postdose.
Plasma was prepared from blood in lithium heparin chilled
tubes immediately after collection. Test compounds were
extracted by protein precipitation using acetonitrile, containing
internal standard (AZ10024306) in a 4:1 solvent:sample ratio.
Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm; 50 mL of
supernatant was combined with 300 mL of water before HPLC/
MS-MS.
Brain and tumor samples were cut into two portions prior to
snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, stored at �80�C, and transferred
to Oncology DMPK, AstraZeneca R&D. Following thawing, sam-
ples were transferred to FastPrep Lysing Matrix A tubes (MP
Biomedicals LLC). Water was added (1:3 tissue:water w/v) and
samples homogenized; homogenate was treated in the same way
as plasma.
Exposure was expressed as area under the plasma or tissue–
concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to 6 or 0 to 24 hours
according to the last concentration measured. Maximum observ-
ed concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (tmax) were direct
observations of concentration versus time data. PK parameters
were obtained by means of noncompartmental analysis using
Phoenix32 version 6.4 (Pharsight Corporation).
Cynomolgus monkey PET micro-dosing
A PET microdosing study was performed in four cynomolgus
monkeys (Supplementary Table S2). Monkeys were anesthe-
tized using ketamine, and anesthesia maintained by a mixture of
O2, air, and sevoflurane (2–8%). Anesthesia, heart rate, blood
pressure, and body temperature were continuously monitored.
Radiolabeled compounds were injected as a bolus into a sural
vein. Injected radioactivity was 141 � 25 MBq corresponding to
<3 mg of radiolabeled osimertinib, AZ5104, gefitinib, and roci-
letinib. The distribution of radioactivity following intravenous
microdosing was assessed using PET imaging more than 125
minutes with a Siemens molecular imaging high-resolution
research tomograph system (29). Arterial blood samples were
collected and analyzed for radioactivity in blood. Separate
experiments were conducted to determine radioactivity distri-
bution to the brain and abdomen. Radioactivity concentration
in brain was calculated and normalized to arterial blood radio-
activity concentration as described in the Supplementary
Material.
Mouse brain metastases xenograft
Effects of chronic once daily (QD) dosing of osimertinib,
gefitinib, and rociletinib were assessed in a mouse brain metas-
tases model. The human NSCLC cell line PC9 (exon 19 deletion)

 containing the luciferase gene (PC9_Luc) using lipofectamine LTX
in order to monitor brain tumor growth by measuring biolumi-
nescence signals in tumor cells (30, 31). Signal intensity was
measured using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Pro-
mega). The EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation was further con-
firmed in the PC9_Luc cell line.
For
the
brain
metastases
model,
PC9_Luc
cells
were
implanted into 6- to 8-week-old specific-pathogen-free immu-
nodeficient nude mice purchased from Vital River by intra-
internal carotid artery injection (32, 33). Bioluminescence sig-
nals were measured with an IVIS Xenogen imaging system
weekly to monitor tumor growth. When signals reached the
range of 107 photons/second, mice were randomized to be
treated orally with osimertinib 5 or 25 mg/kg QD, gefitinib
6.25 mg/kg QD, rociletinib 100 mg/kg QD, or vehicle for 8
weeks. Bioluminescence signals (antitumor efficacy) and body
weight (tolerability) were measured weekly; tumor growth
inhibition was assessed by comparing mean bioluminescence
intensity change for control and treated groups.
Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modeling
A series of modeling studies was undertaken to predict active
doses of osimertinib in humans by incorporating human PK
data into a previously developed PK-pharmacodynamic (PKPD)
PC9 subcutaneous xenograft efficacy model that linked phos-
phorylated EGFR (pEGFR) inhibition to reductions in tumor
volume (34). The studies also accounted for reduced free con-
centrations in the brain due to higher levels of binding than
observed in plasma.
The PD model represents pEGFR, relative to control, as a pool
homogenously distributed across the cell and cells in the tumor.
The reversible interaction (docking) of the molecule with the
receptor is assumed to be more rapid than the covalent binding
step and subsequent deactivation of the receptor. The system is
simplified with the reversible interaction characterized by the
binding affinity, and the irreversible interaction characterized by
a binding constant for unbound parent and metabolite. Further
information on the model is presented as supplementary
material.
Clinical case studies
We present two clinical case studies from the dose escalation/
expansion component of the ongoing phase I/II AURA study
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01802632; ref. 35). In these cases, pres-
ence of brain metastases was documented at study entry; patients
underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at baseline
and every 6 weeks thereafter as part of the systemic evaluation of
disease status according to RECIST version 1.1 until disease
progression.
Results
Osimertinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP transporters
Two efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP, prevent molecules
from crossing the BBB, so it was important to determine the
level of osimertinib substrate activity against these transporters.
Assessments were carried out in transwell plates in AP-to-BL
and BL-to-AP directions (Fig. 1). Relative efflux ratios of osi-
mertinib or its metabolite AZ5104 between MDR1-MDCK
and normal MDCK cells and between BCRP-MDCK and MDCK
cells suggest that these agents are P-gp and BCRP transporter
substrates. When dosed in the presence of transporter inhibi-
tors valspodar or Ko143, efflux ratios were similar to that
observed in nontransfected MDCK or BCRP-MDCK cells,
respectively. Collectively, data confirm that osimertinib and
AZ5104 are substrates of P-gp and BCRP. The apparent perme-
ability of AZ7550 in the BL-to-AP direction of MDR1-MDCK
cells in the presence of valspodar or BCRP-MDCK cells in
the presence of Ko143 suggests that AZ7550 is also a substrate
of P-gp and BCRP.
In MDCK-MDR1 cells, efflux ratios of test compounds dosed
at 1 mmol/L were 13.4 for osimertinib, 5.38 for rociletinib,
4.62 for afatinib, and 4.63 for erlotinib. Efflux ratios in MDCK-
BCRP cells were 5.4 for osimertinib, 54.6 for afatinib, and 6.39
for erlotinib.
Osimertinib demonstrated a passive permeability profile
across Caco2 cell monolayers, with no concentration depen-
dence when tested at 1, 10, and 50 mmol/L, and an efflux ratio
<2.0. The high-binding propensity of osimertinib to cells and
plasticware led to low recovery values in this in vitro study (data
not shown). The present osimertinib data indicate an efflux
ratio of 0.372 for osimertinib 50 mmol/L (Supplementary
Table S1). In this cell line, the efflux ratios were 4.61 for
rociletinib 10 mmol/L and 11.5 for afatinib 10 mmol/L.
Rat quantitative whole body autoradiography indicates that
osimertinib achieves brain exposure
To begin to directly explore the extent that osimertinib can
achieve brain exposure following oral dosing (4 mg/kg), we
utilized QWBA in rat with radiolabeled osimertinib. The tissue
exposure pattern in male pigmented animals indicated that
radioactivity
associated
with
[14C]osimertinib
was
rapidly
absorbed and distributed into the brain, suggesting that drug-
related radioactivity may have crossed the BBB. Maximum con-
centrations of total radioactivity were recorded in the blood and
various tissues, including the brain at 6 hours postdose; the
concentration of total radioactivity in blood and brain was
0.552 and 1.02 nmol equivalents/g, respectively. The maximum
brain:blood ratio was approximately 2.2, achieved by 60 minutes
postdose (Supplementary Fig. S2). Distribution was maintained
in the brain up to 21 days after a single dose, although the brain:
blood ratio (0.2) had decreased, and was below the lower limit of
quantification in blood and brain at 60 days.
In comparison, gefitinib achieved little brain exposure fol-
lowing oral dosing (5 mg/kg), with 0.36 nmol equivalents/g
detected in brain and a brain:blood ratio of approximately
0.69, achieved by 6 hours postdose. Gefitinib levels in the brain
were below the limit of quantification by 24 hours postdose.
Osimertinib exhibits high brain binding in vitro and high
distribution to mouse brain
Osimertinib was highly bound in mouse brain tissue in vitro.
Dilution-corrected
fractions
of
unbound
osimertinib
and
[3H]osimertinib in brain homogenate were 0.0009 and 0.0012
(standard error for both ¼ 0.0002), with no statistically significant
difference between datasets (P ¼ 0.3059). The fraction of
unbound gefitinib was 0.0052 (SE ¼ 0.0002).
Although protein binding and efflux activity are important
parameters contributing to BBB penetrance, they may not
predict overall brain distribution. The rat QWBA study indi-
cated that osimertinib-related material could penetrate the
brain, so we were interested to discover if this radioactivity

 could be attributed to osimertinib and/or its metabolites. As
a consequence, we measured osimertinib brain distribu-
tion directly in vivo in mouse following oral dosing at 5 and
25 mg/kg. Osimertinib was highly distributed in brain, to a
similar extent as in tumor, resulting in AUC tissue:plasma ratios
of 1.7 to 2.8 (Table 1). Furthermore, osimertinib was more

 highly distributed to mouse brain than gefitinib, rociletinib, or
afatinib (Table 2). The brain:plasma Cmax ratio for osimertinib
was 3.41. In comparison, ratios for gefitinib, rociletinib, and
afatinib were only 0.21, <0.08, and <0.36, respectively, with
brain concentrations of rociletinib and afatinib below the assay
lower limit of quantification. The unbound brain-to-plasma
partition ratio (Kpuu,brain) was 0.39 and 0.02, for osimertinib
and gefitinib, respectively, but could not be determined for
rociletinib and afatinib.
Of interest, based on AUC from time 0 to time t (AUC0–t), the
osimertinib metabolites AZ5104 and AZ7550 were observed at
21% to 44% and 24% to 34% of osimertinib at 5 and 25 mg/kg,
respectively. AZ5104 exposure in tumor was at somewhat lower
levels than observed in plasma; tumor:plasma ratios ranged
from 0.26 to 0.86 (Table 1). However, in contrast to parent,
no AZ5104 concentrations above the assay limit of detection
(0.08 mmol/L) were measurable in brain (Table 1). Similarly,
AZ7550 exposure in tumor was at similar levels to that
observed in plasma; tumor:plasma ratios ranged from 0.63 to
2.0 (Table 1). AZ7550 showed minimal brain distribution with
a brain:plasma ratio of 0.1 determined at the 25 mg/kg dose;
distribution in brain was below the assay lower limit of detec-
tion (0.02 mmol/L) at 5 mg/kg (Table 1).
Osimertinib displays brain exposure in a cynomolgus
monkey PET microdosing model
To further investigate osimertinib brain exposure using a quan-
titative imaging of radiolabeled drug approach, we used PET
microdosing in cynomolgus monkeys. Under microdosing con-
ditions (total dose <3 mg), [11C]osimertinib showed marked
exposure in the cynomolgus monkey brain in contrast to its active
metabolite [11C]AZ5104, and other EGFR-TKIs (Fig. 2). Following
intravenous administration of [11C]osimertinib, distribution to
the brain was fast, plateauing at 1.29% � 0.42% (N ¼ 3) of
injected radioactivity within 10 minutes. In contrast, administra-
tion of [11C]AZ5104 (0.17%; N ¼ 2), [11C]gefitinib (0.11%; N ¼
2), and [11C]rociletinib (0.023%; N ¼2) resulted in very low brain
exposure, with no regional differences in brain radioactivity
observed. Ratios of the area under the brain radioactivity con-
centration–time curve from 0 to 90 minutes to that for blood
radioactivity were calculated for [11C]osimertinib (2.62 � 1.42),
[11C]AZ5104 (0.35), [11C]gefitinib (0.28), and [11C]rociletinib
(0.025).
Assessment of whole body distribution up to 120 minutes
postdose
revealed
extensive
hepatobiliary
excretion
of
[11C]rociletinib; hepatobiliary excretion of [11C]osimertinib and
[11C]gefitinib occurred to a lower degree at a slower rate (Fig. 2).
No adverse effects or significant changes in physiological or
blood parameters related to administration of radioactive test
compounds were observed.
Osimertinib causes regression in a mouse EGFRm brain
metastases model
As the PK and PET studies supported brain penetration of
osimertinib, but not its metabolites, we explored how this trans-
lated into antitumor activity in a mouse PC9 (exon 19 deletion)
xenograft brain metastases model. For this aggressively growing
tumor model, there was only one control animal from a cohort of
six still on study after day 50, as the tumor in this mouse grew
slower than in other controls. Consequently, the control growth
curve is observed to decrease after day 50 (Fig. 3A). A dose-
dependent tumor regression was achieved with osimertinib
(Fig. 3A), which correlated with overall survival (Fig. 3B). The
dose of osimertinib 25 mg/kg QD, roughly equating to the 80 mg
QD clinical dose of osimertinib in terms of exposure, was well
tolerated and induced sustained tumor regression until study end
at day 60, with a little weight loss at the initial time point and no
subsequent decrease throughout the dosing period (Fig. 3C).
Although the lower 5 mg/kg QD dose of osimertinib also caused
tumor regression, it was more transient, only occurring in the
first 3 weeks (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no tumor regression was
achieved with rociletinib 100 mg/kg, approximately equivalent
to a 500 mg twice daily human dose, and no survival benefit
was observed (Fig. 3). A clinically relevant dose of gefitinib

 6.25 mg/kg, approximating to the exposure of a 250 mg QD
human clinical dose, also demonstrated only transient tumor
regression, for up to 20 days (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Predicting osimertinib clinical brain metastasis activity using
PK-PD modeling
Overall, preclinical data indicated that osimertinib could
potentially achieve efficacy in mutant EGFRm brain metastases.
We therefore wanted to translate this into a clinical context
using a PKPD modeling approach. The plasma PKPD model for
osimertinib was adjusted according to mouse BBB penetration
and binding data. After adjusting for control growth, simulated
efficacy suggested that the model adequately predicted efficacy
(Fig. 4), validating the assumption of adjusting for free expo-
sure in the brain metastases model. Simulation based on
subcutaneous xenograft models and free brain exposure to
osimertinib revealed that higher doses were needed to achieve
the same percentage tumor growth inhibition of brain metas-
tases as seen in the primary tumor (Fig. 4), potentially due to
lower free exposure of osimertinib and AZ5104 in the brain
than systemically. Tumor growth simulations using human
exposure of osimertinib predicted that a human dose of at
least osimertinib 80 mg QD could be sufficient to target EGFRm
NSCLC brain metastases.
Proof of principle clinical brain metastases activity of
osimertinib in clinical case studies
As clinical proof of principle to support the preclinical findings,
we report two clinical case studies (Fig. 5.) demonstrating evi-
dence of clinical activity of osimertinib in brain metastases
observed in the AURA phase I/II study (NCT01802632) in
patients with acquired resistance to current EGFR-TKIs (35).
Case study 1 is of a 62-year-old Asian female diagnosed with
EGFRm (exon 19 deletion) advanced NSCLC. This patient had
been previously treated with gemcitabine/cisplatin for four cycles
[outcome: stable disease (SD)], gefitinib between June 2011 and
October 2012 [partial response (PR)], and pemetrexed for 10
cycles between November 2012 and June 2013 (SD), with WBRT
between December 2012 and January 2013. Biopsy in July 2013
identified T790M mutation. The patient started osimertinib
40 mg QD in a T790M positive expansion cohort of the AURA
clinical study on August 7, 2013. PR was achieved from the 12-
week Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
1.1 scan in October 2013, with noncomplete response-nonpro-
gressive disease (in effect, SD) reported in the nontarget lesions
(including brain metastases). The patient was ongoing with
systemic PR as of May 1, 2015, 632 days after starting osimertinib.
Case study 2 is of a 59-year-old Asian female diagnosed with
EGFRm (L858R) advanced NSCLC. This patient was previously
treated with erlotinib between October 2011 and October 2012
(outcome: PR), pemetrexed/cisplatin/carboplatin for five cycles
between October 2012 and January 2013 (SD), erlotinib between
January 2013 and March 2013 (nonevaluable [NE]), docetaxel for
three cycles between April 2013 and June 2013 (SD), and gemci-
tabine for two cycles between June 2013 and July 2013 (NE).
Biopsy in August 2013 identified a T790M mutation. The patient
started osimertinib 80 mg QD in a T790M positive expansion
cohort of the AURA clinical study on September 2, 2013, and PR
was achieved from the 6-week RECIST 1.1 scan in October 2013,
with noncomplete response-nonprogressive disease (in effect,
SD) reported in the nontarget lesions (including brain metasta-
ses). PR remained for the 12- and 18-week systemic assessments.
Disease progression was observed in the brain as nontarget lesions
at the 24-week scan in February 2014, although extracranial target
lesions remained in response. The patient discontinued osimer-
tinib on March 10, 2014, after 189 days on study treatment, and
commenced vinorelbine on March 10, 2014, and whole brain
irradiation on March 17, 2014.

 Discussion
Identification of brain metastases in patients with NSCLC has
increased over recent decades; contributing factors include
improved survival as a result of more effective systemic thera-
pies, and improved imaging quality and accessibility allowing
detection of asymptomatic lesions (36). Although approximately
one-third of patients with NSCLC progress during treatment by
the development of brain metastases (3), there are few effective
treatment options available.
Traditionally, WBRT has been regarded as the cornerstone of
treatment; however, there are concerns regarding its long-term
neurotoxicity profile (37). In recent years, brain metastases man-
agement has been refined, and now includes local therapies such
as surgical resection for single brain lesions and stereotactic
radiosurgery for oligometastatic lesions (22).
Incomplete BBB penetration is widely viewed as the reason for
the high prevalence of brain metastases in patients with NSCLC
who have achieved good systemic control with chemotherapy
regimens (20). As currently available EGFR-TKIs have a limited
ability to penetrate the BBB, there remains an unmet need for
EGFR-TKIs with improved clinical efficacy against brain lesions.
This is particularly important as patients with EGFRm advanced
NSCLC are living longer, and managing long-term neurotoxicity
related to WBRT is challenging. We therefore describe preclinical

 and clinical evidence supporting that osimertinib may be an
EGFR-TKI with improved brain exposure for treatment of brain
metastases in the EGFRm NSCLC setting.
Kpuu,brain is well established as a good predictor of BBB per-
meability, with values greater than 0.3 indicative of good diffu-
sion across the BBB (38). Osimertinib was shown to have a good
Kpuu,brain value (0.39) compared with other currently available
TKIs and rociletinib, suggesting it has the potential to achieve
good brain exposure. This was despite evidence that osimertinib is
a substrate of P-gp and BCRP efflux transporters, which are
involved in the removal of toxins, drugs, and chemotherapies
from the CNS, ultimately leading to drug resistance in the brain,
when measured in cell lines (MDCK-MDR1, MDCK-BCRP) over-
expressing these transporters (6–9). In the Caco2 cell line, which
expresses P-gp/BCRP at physiological levels, osimertinib was the
only agent without an efflux ratio, suggesting that permeability of
osimertinib is sufficient to overcome the efflux in this non-
transfected human cell line. In contrast, the other EGFR-TKIs
assessed were restricted by efflux. By analogy, this same phenom-
enon could be happening at the BBB, resulting in the superior
brain penetration of osimertinib, compared with the other TKI
agents; however, these data need to be confirmed before any firm
conclusions can be drawn. Kpuu data presented here consistently
showed that osimertinib could achieve significant exposure in the
brain. Moreover, preclinical data showed that osimertinib caused
durable shrinkage in an in vivo EGFRm brain metastases model at
clinically relevant doses, consistent with its efficacy in extracranial
preclinical models (25).
Importantly, the improved brain exposure of osimertinib
indicated by these preclinical studies may result in improved
clinical activity compared with currently available EGFR-TKIs,
and also rociletinib. In these studies, osimertinib was more
highly distributed to the mouse brain than gefitinib, afatinib,
and rociletinib, and penetration of the rat brain was greater
than previously described for gefitinib (39). Interestingly, low
uptake into brain was also observed for erlotinib in xenografted
mice (40). Osimertinib also demonstrated markedly more
penetration of the nonhuman primate brain than rociletinib
and gefitinib at microdosing levels. In the PC9 EGFRm mouse
brain metastases model, osimertinib 25 mg/kg QD induced
sustained
tumor
regression,
with
the
antitumor
activity
correlating with overall survival. Although a dose of gefitinib
6.25 mg/kg, which roughly equates to a 250 mg QD human
clinical dose, also demonstrated tumor regression, this was
only for up to 20 days. Interestingly, consistent with distribu-
tion studies, no tumor regression was achieved with rociletinib
at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and no survival benefit observed. It
should be noted that at a dose of 25 mg/kg, plasma exposure of
the active metabolites AZ5104 and AZ7550 was �24% to 34%
that of osimertinib, whereas human exposure of the metabo-
lites has been reported as �10% (41). In addition, the plasma
terminal half-life of osimertinib was �3 hours in mouse mod-
els, and reported as at least 50 hours in healthy volunteers (25).
An EGFR-TKI designed specifically to penetrate the BBB
(AZD3759) is currently being investigated for treatment of
patients with NSCLC with brain metastases. AZD3759 is active
against EGFR-TKI sensitizing mutations, and preclinical evidence
indicates that this compound shows good penetration of the BBB
and induces profound tumor regression in animal models. In
addition, in an ongoing phase I study in patients with EGFRm

 NSCLC (BLOOM; NCT02228369), AZD3759 was well tolerated
and was associated with intracranial tumor shrinkage (42).
Although data are encouraging, it is important to note that, unlike
osimertinib, this compound is not selective for T790M resistance
mutations.
PET microdosing has been shown to be a robust method of
predicting brain exposure compared with pharmacological
dosing (43) and is comparable to microdialysis for confirming
adequate brain exposure of CNS drug candidates (44). The low
extent of brain exposure for gefitinib in the PET studies is
consistent with human clinical experience, lending support to
this approach being predictive. Indeed, PET microdosing in
nonhuman primates has been used to confirm adequate brain
exposure with AZD3241, a drug targeting the CNS to support to
the conduct of phase IIa studies in patients (45, 46).
The greater distribution of osimertinib in the brain has the
potential to translate into clinical benefit versus other EGFR-
TKIs. Based on PKPD modeling, doses of up to 240 mg QD were
simulated for brain metastases. These tumor growth simula-
tions predicted that osimertinib at the current clinically recom-
mended dose of 80 mg QD could be sufficient to target human
EGFRm NSCLC brain metastases, although 160 mg QD may be
more effective. This potency modeling is based on the observed
lack of metabolite exposure in preclinical brain models, which
contrasts to systemic plasma levels; it will be important to
determine whether metabolites have similar lack of exposure in
the clinical setting. Indeed, in strong support of these preclin-
ical predictions, we also present early evidence of clinical
activity of osimertinib in brain metastases, observed in two
case studies of patients enrolled in the phase I AURA study.
Both of these patients' cases achieved benefit from osimertinib
treatment for controlling brain lesion growth.
The collective preclinical results reported here are promising,
and suggest that osimertinib could offer a new clinically signif-
icant treatment option for patients with EGFRm brain metastases.
Nonetheless, further investigation of osimertinib in patients with
EGFRm NSCLC and brain metastases is warranted. An analysis of
osimertinib PK in cerebrospinal fluid is an exploratory objective
in the ongoing AURA3 (NCT02151981) trial, in which patients
with EGFRm advanced NSCLC and stable brain metastases have
been enrolled. As patients with brain metastases frequently
present with concurrent leptomeningeal metastases (LM; ref. 47),
osimertinib and AZD3759 are also being investigated in patients
with LM in a phase I study (NCT02228369).
