Abstract
Background: In the SOD1G93A mutant rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neuronal death and rapid
paralysis progression are associated with the emergence of activated aberrant glial cells that proliferate in the
degenerating spinal cord. Whether pharmacological downregulation of such aberrant glial cells will decrease motor
neuron death and prolong survival is unknown. We hypothesized that proliferation of aberrant glial cells is
dependent on kinase receptor activation, and therefore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor masitinib (AB1010) could
potentially control neuroinflammation in the rat model of ALS.
Methods: The cellular effects of pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine kinases with masitinib were analyzed in cell
cultures of microglia isolated from aged symptomatic SOD1G93A rats. To determine whether masitinib prevented
the appearance of aberrant glial cells or modified post-paralysis survival, the drug was orally administered at
30 mg/kg/day starting after paralysis onset.
Results: We found that masitinib selectively inhibited the tyrosine kinase receptor colony-stimulating factor 1R
(CSF-1R) at nanomolar concentrations. In microglia cultures from symptomatic SOD1G93A spinal cords, masitinib
prevented CSF-induced proliferation, cell migration, and the expression of inflammatory mediators. Oral
administration of masitinib to SOD1G93A rats starting after paralysis onset decreased the number of aberrant glial
cells, microgliosis, and motor neuron pathology in the degenerating spinal cord, relative to vehicle-treated rats.
Masitinib treatment initiated 7 days after paralysis onset prolonged post-paralysis survival by 40 %.
Conclusions: These data show that masitinib is capable of controlling microgliosis and the emergence/expansion
of aberrant glial cells, thus providing a strong biological rationale for its use to control neuroinflammation in ALS.
Remarkably, masitinib significantly prolonged survival when delivered after paralysis onset, an unprecedented effect
in preclinical models of ALS, and therefore appears well-suited for treating ALS.

 Background
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic neuro-
degenerative disease characterized by the progressive de-
generation of upper and lower motor neurons. Survival
after diagnosis varies between 1 and 5 years or more,
largely determined on the rate of spread of motor
neuron
pathology.
Paralysis
progression
in
rodent
models of ALS appears to be modulated by glial cells
that proliferate and express inflammatory mediators in
the degenerating spinal cord [1–4]. In the SOD1G93A
mutant rat model of ALS, a rapid spread of paralysis
is associated with marked glial cell activation and the
emergence of aberrant glial cells that actively prolifer-
ate around degenerating motor neurons [4, 5]. Fur-
thermore,
aberrant
glial
cells
display
a
marked
neurotoxic potential on cultured motor neurons [4],
suggesting that they might directly contribute to the
rapid spread of paralysis of ALS rats. It remains un-
known, however, whether pharmacologically downreg-
ulation of aberrant glial cells could slow paralysis
progression in the rat model of ALS.
We have theorized that aberrant glial cells proliferat-
ing in the ALS spinal cord could be sensitive to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that target the family of type III growth
factor receptors including PDGF-R, c-Kit, FLT3, and
CSF-1R. These receptors synergistically signal cell prolif-
eration and the migration of cancer and hematopoietic
cells, including macrophages [6]. In particular, while M-
CSF/CSF-1R signaling is critical for the mononuclear
phagocytic system [7, 8], a recent report indicates that
damaged motor neurons induce the expansion of spinal
cord microglia by expressing M-CSF [9]. Thus, we have
explored whether the inhibition of CSF-1R and related
kinase receptors could modulate neuroinflammation and
slow disease spreading in an inherited rat model of ALS.
Among candidate tyrosine kinase inhibitors, masitinib
(AB1010) was found to be a highly selective kinase in-
hibitor [10, 11] and shown to prevent central nervous
system (CNS) neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis
[12], stroke [13], and Alzheimer’s disease [14]. Thus, we
aimed to characterize the effects of masitinib on cul-
tured aberrant glial cells and determine its therapeutic
potential after oral administration to SOD1G93A rats. Be-
cause aberrant glial cells emerge only after paralysis on-
set [4], the drug treatment was initiated following overt
disease onset to better simulate the clinical condition of
ALS patients. We found that masitinib inhibited glial cell
activation in SOD1G93A rats and prolonged survival, in-
dicating a promising therapeutic approach to ALS.
Methods
Animals
Male SOD1G93A progeny were used for further breeding
to maintain the line. Rats were housed in a centralized
animal facility with a 12-h light-dark cycle with ad libi-
tum access to food and water. Perfusion with fixatives
was performed under 90 % ketamine—10 % xylazine
anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering, discomfort, or stress. All procedures using la-
boratory animals were performed in accordance with the
national and international guidelines and were approved
by the Institutional Animal Committee for animal ex-
perimentation. Male hemizygous NTac:SD-TgN (SOD1-
G93A)L26H
rats
(Taconic),
originally
developed
by
Howland et al. [15], were bred locally by crossing with
wild-type nontransgenic Sprague-Dawley female rats.
Determination of disease onset and end-stage
All rats were weighed and evaluated for motor activity
daily. Disease onset was determined for each animal
when pronounced muscle atrophy was accompanied by
abnormal gait, typically expressed as subtle limping or
dragging of one hind limb. End-stage was defined by a
lack of righting reflexes or the inability to reach food
and water.
Masitinib post-paralysis survival trial
Only transgenic rats showing weakness and gait alter-
ations in hind limbs as first clinical sign were selected
for masitinib treatment studies. Male and female rats
were divided randomly into the masitinib or vehicle-
treated groups. Masitinib mesylate (AB1010) freshly pre-
pared in drinking sterilized water was administrated
daily at a dose of 30 mg/kg using a curved stainless steel
gavage needle with 3-mm ball tip. Dosing was defined in
accordance to previous studies in a rat model of stroke
that was shown to be safe for chronic treatments [13].
Rats were treated from day 1 or day 7 post-paralysis
during 20 days or until end-stage, when they were
euthanized.
Immunohistochemical staining of rat spinal cords
After 20 days of treatment using 30 mg/kg/day of masiti-
nib, starting after paralysis onset, animals were deeply
anesthetized and transcardial perfusion was performed
with 0.9 % saline and 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
PBS (pH 7.2–7.4). Fixed spinal cord was removed, post-
fixed by immersion for 24 h, and then transverse sec-
tioned (30 μm) in a Leica cryostat. Serial sections were
collected in 100 mM PBS for immunohistochemistry.
Free-floating sections were permeabilized for 30 min at
room temperature with 0.3 % Triton X-100 in PBS,
passed through washing buffered solutions, blocked with
5 % BSA:PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incu-
bated overnight at 4 °C in a solution of 0.3 % Triton X-
100 and PBS containing the primary antibodies, rabbit
anti-GFAP (1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-S100β (1:400,
Sigma), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:300, abcam), rabbit anti-

 CD206 (1:300 abcam), mouse anti-CD68 (1:200, abcam),
mouse
anti-ChAT
(choline
acetyltransferase)
(1:300,
Millipore). After washing, sections were incubated in
1:1000-diluted secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa
Fluor 488 and/or Alexa Fluor 633 (1:1000, Invitrogen).
Antibodies were detected by confocal microscopy using
a confocal LEICA TCS-SP5-DMI6000 or a confocal
ZEISS LSM 780.
Analysis of glial cells in the lumbar spinal cord of hind
limb symptomatic rats
The number of aberrant glial cells co-expressing the
astrocytic markers GFAP and S100β or the microglia
markers Iba-1, CD206, and CD68 were assessed by
counting the respective positive cells for the different
markers in gray matter from the lumbar cord of
SOD1G93A asymptomatic or symptomatic rats that had
been treated with either vehicle or masitinib. The ana-
lysis was performed manually in at least 20 histological
sections per animal (four different rats for each condi-
tion) using the cell counter tool of the ImageJ software.
For aberrant glial cell counting, values were expressed as
the number of GFAP+/S100β+ cells in each ventral horn
of the spinal cord in masitinib-treated rats relative to
vehicle-treated rats. For microgliosis analysis, the num-
ber of Iba1+, CD206+, or CD68+ cells was assessed via
manual counting using the ImageJ software tools. Only
microglia cells present in the grey matter of the ventral
horn of the spinal cord were taken into consideration.
Statistical studies were performed using statistical tools
of the free Software PAST3. Descriptive statistics were
used for each group, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis or one-
way ANOVA, followed by Scheffé post hoc comparison
if necessary, was used among groups. All results are pre-
sented
as
mean ± SEM,
with
p < 0.01
considered
significant.
Analysis of microgliosis spreading along the
degenerating spinal cord of SOD1G93A rats
The spinal cord of hind limb symptomatic rats was dis-
sected at thoracic and cervical levels. Three masitinib-
treated rats were compared with three vehicle-treated
rats. As previously described, immunohistochemistry
was assessed to determine the levels of microgliosis by
Iba1 detection. At least ten different 30 μm sections of
each rat were visualized using a LEICA TCS-SP5-
DMI6000 confocal microscope.
Analysis of motor neuron number and size
The number of motor neurons expressing ChAT was
assessed by counting the positive cells in the gray matter
of the lumbar spinal cord of non-transgenic compared
with symptomatic SOD1G93A, vehicle-, and masitinib-
treated rats. Motor neuron counting was based on a
stereological
approach
as
previously
reported
[16].
Briefly, ChAT positive cells were quantified on five
30 μm sections taken 300 μm apart from the ventral
horn, comparing the cell numbers in Rexed laminae VII
and IX, which display low and high density of large
motor neurons, respectively. Results are presented as
mean ± SEM, with p < 0.01 considered significant. The
longest axis (length) of each soma was taken into con-
sideration to quantify the mean size of motor neuron
soma. The analysis was performed manually in at least
25 histological sections per animal (four different rats
for each condition) using the cell counter tool of the
ImageJ software. Results are presented as median ± SD,
with p < 0.01 considered significant. Statistical studies
were performed using statistical tools of the free Soft-
ware PAST3. Descriptive statistics were used for each
group, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis or one-way ANOVA,
followed by Scheffé post hoc comparison if necessary,
was used among groups.
Microglia cell cultures from symptomatic SOD1G93A rats
Microglial cells were obtained from a primary culture
adult spinal cord of symptomatic SOD1G93A rats accord-
ing to the procedures described by Trias et al. [5] with
minor modifications. Briefly, animals were euthanized by
administering an overdose of ketamine/xylazine, and the
spinal cord was dissected on ice. After the meninges
were removed, the spinal cord was chopped finely and
dissociated with 0.25 % trypsin in calcium-free buffer for
5 min at 37 °C. Trypsin treatment was stopped by add-
ing DMEM/10 % (vol/vol) FBS in the presence of 50 μg/
mL DNaseI and mechanical disaggregation by repeated
pipetting. The resulting extract was passed through an
80-μm mesh to eliminate tissue debris and was then
spun. The pellet was resuspended in culture medium
[DMEM/10 % (vol/vol) FBS, Hepes (3.6 g/L), penicillin
(100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL)] and was
then plated in a 24-multiwell culture dish. Culture
medium was removed after 24 h and subsequently re-
placed every 24 or 48 h depending on the procedure.
Microglia migratory capacity assay
Primary cultures were plated in high-density 4-multiwell
plates during 4 days. After that, and when cells already
reached confluence, media was changed to DMEM-
0.5 % FBS, thereby, significantly reducing the prolifera-
tion rate. A scratch was then made in the monolayer
using a 1000 μL tip, and cells were treated with increas-
ing doses of masitinib in DMSO (used as vehicle in
control-treated cells). Post-scratch pictures were taken
at 24 h using a bright field NIKON microscope attached
to a Canon HD camera, and cells that invaded the
scratch were counted manually in at least 12 different
pictures (three different rats were cultured for this

 experiment, n = 3) using the cell counter tool of ImageJ
software.
Proliferation assay induced by macrophages-colony
stimulating factor (M-CSF)
Cells were isolated as described above from the three
different symptomatic rat spinal cords and plated in 24-
multiwell dishes during 24 h in low serum, DMEM-
0.5 % FBS. Cells were then treated with 30 ng/mL of rat
M-CSF in PBS-0.1 % BSA (vehicle-treated cells were
treated with the same amount of PBS-0.1 % BSA). To
determine the inhibitory capacity of masitinib against
the tyrosine kinase receptor CSF-1R, cells were treated
with increasing doses of the drug (0.01–1 μM) in the
presence of M-CSF and compared with vehicle-treated
cells for which masitinib was substituted with DMSO. In
total, three experimental groups were analyzed: control
cells (in DMEM-0.5 % FBS + PBS-0.1 % BSA), vehicle-
treated cells (DMEM-0.5 % FBS + M-CSF + DMSO), and
masitinib-treated cells (DMEM-0.5 % FBS + M-CSF +
masitinib). All wells were treated at the same time with
10 μM of BrdU (Sigma). After 24 h, cells were fixed and
immunocytochemistry using anti-BrdU antibody was
followed. Briefly, cells were washed and fixed with cold
methanol during 5 min at 4 °C, then washed with PBS
and treated with 2 M of HCl for 30 min. Cells were
blocked using 5 % of BSA in PBS for 1 h, and rat anti-
BrdU was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. After that, the pri-
mary antibody was removed, washed with PBS three
times for 10 min, and goat anti-rat antibody was incu-
bated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing away
the secondary antibody, cells were covered in glycerol
mounting medium with 1/2000 DAPI dilution and a
cover slip (Sigma). Cells were visualized in an epifluores-
cence microscope Olympus IX81. BrdU+ nuclei were
counted and ratio of DAPI to BrdU labeling was com-
pared among groups. Data were analyzed using analyz-
ing tools of ImageJ software and shown as mean ± SEM,
with p < 0.01 considered significant.
Cultured microglia treated with masitinib
Microglial cells were plated in a 24-multiwell dish dur-
ing 24 h and floating fat was removed. Masitinib treat-
ment was started at that time and was repeated every
48 h chronically with each media change. Three doses of
masitinib diluted in DMSO were tested, 0.1, 0.5, and
1.0 μM. Vehicle cells were treated with the same amount
of DMSO as a control. Microphotographs were taken
using a phase contrast microscope equipped with a
Canon HD camera. Cells were treated during 15 days
until cell transformation into monolayers of aberrant
astrocyte cells. Quantitative analysis of the cell number
every 48 h was assessed using the “cell counter” of the
ImageJ Software. The number of cells in the masitinib-
treated plates was compared to vehicle-treated ones.
Data are shown as mean ± SEM, with p < 0.01 considered
significant.
Cell cultures from symptomatic SOD1G93A masitinib-
treated rats
After 20 days of treatment with 30 mg/kg/day of masiti-
nib, spinal cords were cultured in p35 dishes (three dif-
ferent
treated
animals
were
cultured
as
described
previously). Spinal cords from vehicle-treated animals
were cultured as controls. After 24 h, floating fat was re-
moved and pictures were taken every 48 h after every
change of culture media, using a phase contrast micro-
scope and a Canon HD camera. Pictures were taken dur-
ing 10 days. Cells were counted using the tool “cell
counter” from ImageJ Software. Data is shown as the
number of microglia cells/mm2 in the masitinib-treated
rats and compared to vehicle. Kruskal-Wallis analysis
was used among groups. Data are shown as mean ±
SEM, with p < 0.01 considered significant.
Real-time PCR analysis in microglia cell cultures
Three different end-stage symptomatic rat spinal cords
were cultured to obtained microglia as described previ-
ously [5]. Cells were plated in p60 dishes during 5 days
and treated during 72 h with different doses of masitinib
(0.5–1 μM) in DMEM-10 % FBS. An estimated 200,000
cells were processed for each mRNA extraction using
RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. mRNA yields were measured on
Nanodrop device (Thermo Scientific) and cDNA were
obtained from 0.5 μg of RNA (−80 °C), 4 μL of iScript
reverse transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (BIORAD,
−20 °C) in a final volume of 20 μL filled with nuclease
free water. The Thermo cycler was set as follows: prim-
ing 5 min at 25 °C followed by 30 min at 42 °C for re-
verse transcription and 5′ at 85 °C for RT inactivation.
RT-qPCR was performed on reverse transcribed cDNA
using SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix
(BIO-RAD) on a CFX96 Touch™ real-time PCR detec-
tion system. For each well, 5 μL of diluted DNA was
added to 20 μL of mix (containing 1 μL of each primer,
12.5 μL of SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green Super-
mix, 5.5 μL of nuclease free water). Each sample was run
in duplicate. The cycling parameters were as follows:
30 s at 95 °C then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 and 30 s at
60 °C. Cq values were obtained for every cycle. Primers
were designed on NCBI Primer-BLAST following the
best guidelines to exclude genomic DNA amplification.
The analysis was done using BioRad CFX manager 3.1
with a threshold set at 650 RFU corresponding to the
amplification curves linear portion. Variations between
samples were normalized using two housekeeping genes
PGK1
and
HPRT.

bone marrow-derived rat macrophages (BMDM) in vitro
and selected for specificity and quantitativity before be-
ing tested on primary microglia from SOD1G93A rats
(only primers achieving quantitatively up to a dilution
factor of 500 were kept). The following primers were

masitinib on CSF-1R kinase activity was assessed with
the
HTRF®
KinEASE
assay
(Cisbio
International,
Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France) using a biotinylated poly(-
Glu4Tyr) peptide (1 μM) as substrate. Kinase assays were
performed at an ATP concentration of 100 μM (CSF-1R
KmATP = 52 μM) in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH
7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.01 %
Brij-35) for 30 min at room temperature in the presence
of various masitinib concentrations (0 to 10 μM). Reac-
tions were stopped by addition of EDTA, and samples
were incubated for 1 h with an anti-phospho peptide-
Eu3+ antibody (emission 620 nm) and streptavidin XL-
665 (emission 665 nm) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. After incubation, the obtained signal is pro-
portional to the concentration of phosphorylated peptide
in the sample. All measurements were performed on a

Results
Masitinib prevents M-CSF-induced proliferation in cul-
tured microglia
To determine the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibition
with masitinib, we used microglia isolated from the pri-
mary spinal cord cultures of symptomatic SOD1G93A
rats before their transformation into astrocyte-like cells
[5]. Microglia appeared as hypertrophic phagocytic cells
that actively proliferate in the presence of fetal bovine
serum (FBS) or M-CSF (Fig. 1a). Treating cell cultures
using pharmacological concentrations of masitinib (0.1–
1 μM) dose-dependently abrogated the morphology of
hypertrophic phagocytic microglia and also inhibited M-
CSF-induced proliferation as measured by BrdU uptake
(Fig. 1b). In accordance, masitinib potently inhibited the
kinase activity of recombinant CSF-1R with an IC50 of
90 ± 35 nM (Fig. 1c), a concentration that is reachable in
vivo.
Masitinib prevents SOD1G93A microglia cells inflammatory
profile
As predicted by the hypertrophic and phagocytic morph-
ology, primary cultured microglia from symptomatic
SOD1G93A spinal cords displayed a robust transcrip-
tional activity for inflammatory genes. After exposure to
masitinib during 72 h, the transcription of several genes
highly involved in neuroinflammation decreased more
than 50 %. In particular, relevant inflammatory tran-
scripts such as IL1β, IL6, Iba1, and Cox2 were downreg-
ulated by approximately 80 % (Fig. 2a). In addition,
Fig. 2b shows that masitinib inhibited by more than
50 %, the ability of microglia to migrate across a scratch
made in the culture dish in low FBS conditions.
Previously, we have reported that hypertrophic micro-
glia from ALS rats follow a phenotypic transition after
12–15 days in culture turning to flat, astrocyte-like cells
characterized by being highly toxic for cultured motor

 neurons [4, 5]. Figure 2c shows that masitinib (0.1–
1 μM) potently prevented this phenotypic transform-
ation by more than 50 %, thus preventing the emergence
of the aberrant glial cell phenotype in culture.
Post-paralysis masitinib treatment reduces the number of
aberrant glial cells and neuroinflammation
We then explored whether chronic treatment with masi-
tinib could reduce the number of aberrant glial cells in
the degenerating spinal cord, which were identifiable as
large GFAP/S100β-positive cells located around motor
neurons as described previously [4]. Rats were orally
treated with masitinib (30 mg/kg/day), starting right
after paralysis onset and during the next 20 days, corre-
sponding to the average post-paralysis survival in un-
treated rats (Fig. 5). Only rats that initiated paralysis in
the hind limbs were used in the experiments in order to
reduce experimental variables. As compared with rats
treated with vehicle, masitinib significantly reduced the
number of aberrant glial cells in the lumbar spinal cord
by 40 % (Fig. 3a).
In accordance, masitinib treatment to symptomatic
rats prevented the isolation and subsequent proliferation
of microglia in primary cell cultures of the degenerating
spinal cord (Fig. 3b). This sharply contrasted with a large
number of hypertrophic and phagocytic cells obtained in
cultures from vehicle-treated rats, indicating that masiti-
nib treatment reduces inflammatory and proliferative
potential of endogenous glial cells.
Post-paralysis masitinib treatment also significantly re-
duced microgliosis as assessed by the number of cells
expressing Iba1+, CD206+, or CD68+ cells in the ventral
horn of the lumbar spinal cord, when compared with
vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 4a, see Additional file 1:
Figure S1A). Remarkably, there was a reduction of
hypertrophic Iba1+ microglia cells surrounding motor
neurons at thoracic and cervical levels of the degenerat-
ing spinal cords, suggesting that masitinib may pre-
vented the spread of neuroinflammation along the
neuraxis (see Additional file 1: Figure S1B).
Masitinib ameliorates motor neuron pathology
Because motor neuron death is the main pathological
feature of symptomatic rodent models and human ALS,
we used the same experimental setting to determine if
motor neuron pathology was influenced by masitinib

 treatment. As shown in Fig. 4b, in vehicle-treated
SOD1G93A rat, the number of ventral horn ChAT+
motor neurons decreased by 60 % when measured
20 days after paralysis onset. In comparison, masitinib
significantly reduced motor neuron loss to 40 % when
administered after paralysis onset. We next analyzed the
effect of masitinib treatment on the motor neuron soma
diameter in surviving motor neurons. When compared
with non-transgenic animals (soma diameter 35.8 ±
8.7 μm), there was a significant reduction in the soma
diameter of end-stage symptomatic rats (23.4 ± 5.8 μm).
This neuron atrophy was significantly prevented by
masitinib treatment (30 ± 10.3 μm) (Fig. 4b).
Masitinib prolongs post-paralysis survival in SOD1G93A
rats
Next, we designed two randomized trials using masitinib
to determine how the drug affected the survival of
SOD1G93A rats with hind limb onset. As shown in
Table 1, our rat colony develops disease with a delayed
onset (187 ± 15 days for vehicle rats) if compared with
that originally described by Howland et al. [15]. In
our colony, the post-paralysis survival with hind limb
onset has been highly reproducible in non-treated an-
imals (20 ± 3.8 days, Fig. 5). Table 1 shows that there
were no significant differences in the pre-treatment
parameters analyzed such as age and weight between
treated and non-treated animal groups (see Additional
file 1: Figure S2C, D).
Masitinib (30 mg/kg/day) was administrated imme-
diately upon abnormal gait onset (day 1) or after day
7. The effect of masitinib treatment was compared
against
age,
weight,
and
gender-matched
control
groups treated with vehicle (Fig. 5a, b, see Additional
file 1: Figure S2A–D). Without masitinib, the ALS
rats died within 3 weeks of paralysis onset (Fig. 5a).
Rats in the masitinib day 1 cohort (n = 14) had a
statistically significant (p < 0.0006) difference in the
probability of survival when compared with vehicle-
treated
animals
(Kaplan-Meier
curves,
Fig.
5a).
Fig. 2 Masitinib inhibited microglia proinflammatory phenotype and prevented microglia migration and transformation into aberrant glial cells. a
Real-time PCR analysis showed that the treatment with pharmacological concentration (1 μM) of masitinib during 72 h is sufficient to significantly
reduce the expression of several genes involved in inflammatory processes. b A confluent monolayer was scratched to determine the migratory
capacity of aberrant microglia. After 24 h, cells located between the dashed lines were counted. Vehicle-treated microglia covered most of the
scratch after 24 h, while masitinib-treated cells showed significantly less migratory capacity. The inset shows the open space in the monolayer
immediately after making the scratch (scale bar 20 μm). The graph to the right shows the quantitative analysis of migration. c Masitinib prevented
microglia transformation into aberrant glial cells in a dose-dependent manner when compared with vehicle-treated cultures. Note how after
12 days in vitro, microglia transition to a flat astrocyte-like cell that reach confluence. Masitinib significantly prevented this transformation and few
microglia cells transitioned into aberrant glial cells (scale bar 10 μm). The graph to the right represents the quantitative analysis showing the
number of aberrant glial cells after 12 days in vitro (12DIV). All data are expressed as mean ± SEM *p < 0.01

 Remarkably, animals in the masitinib day 7 cohort (n = 9)
also had a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) difference in
the probability of survival with respect to controls.
Comparing each cohort’s mean survival time also evi-
denced a survival benefit for masitinib. The mean post-
paralysis survival time was respectively 30 ± 8 days and
27 ± 4.3 days for day 1 and day 7 masitinib cohorts,
which were both significantly longer than the 20 ±
3.8 days observed for vehicle-treated rats (Fig. 5b, p <
0.0016 and 0.0003, respectively). The protective effect of
masitinib was equally observed in both female and male
rats (see Additional file 1: Figure S2A, B).
Discussion
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are a well-established class of
drugs typically used to suppress or decrease cancer cell
proliferation and modulate the associated tumor micro-
environment [17, 18]. Here, we show evidence that the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor masitinib therapeutically modu-
lates the neuroinflammation associated with the ALS
progression. Masitinib reduced microgliosis and the sub-
sequent emergence of aberrant glial cells in the degener-
ating spinal cord, which is consistent with a potent
effect in microglial cell cultures, downregulating prolifer-
ation, migration, and inflammatory transcriptional pro-
file. Remarkably, treatment of already paralytic rats with
masitinib resulted in an unprecedented increase (~40 %)
in post-paralysis survival in both genders. While other
drugs modulating glial cell inflammation can prolong
survival in ALS models [19], our study is the first one
showing a protective effect when the drug is delivered
post-paralysis. Such a therapeutic approach is appealing
in the clinical setting of ALS where drug treatment is
initiated only after overt motor symptoms.
Tyrosine kinase inhibition with masitinib sharply de-
creased the number microglia cells expressing Iba1,
CD206, and CD68 and the appearance of aberrant glial
cells in the lumbar spinal cord, thus supporting the con-
cept that preventing the emergence of aberrant glial cells
moderates the accelerated paralysis progression charac-
teristic of SOD1G93A rats. Our results also anticipate that
tyrosine kinase inhibition could be also protective in
other ALS models involving overt glial activation [20,
21]. Indeed, the SOD1G93A rat appears as a useful model
to study drugs with post-paralysis effects through the
modulation of CNS neuroinflammation, contrasting with
SOD1G93A mice where distal axonopathy appears as a
more important determinant of post-paralysis survival
[15, 22].
The inhibition of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine
kinases controlling inflammation and exaggerated glial
cell activation appears as the most plausible mechanism
of action of masitinib. Compared to previous studies in
ALS murine models based on ablation of proliferating

 microglial cells [23–25], treatment with masitinib does
not eliminate the proliferating microglia. Rather, it more
likely modulates the proliferation and inflammatory sig-
naling underlying the emergence of aberrant glial cells,
representing a new pharmacological approach to control
detrimental neuroinflammation.
In particular, we found that masitinib inhibits purified re-
combinant CSF-1R kinase activity at nanomolar concentra-
tions and reduces M-CSF-induced microglia proliferation
and migration ability in vitro, suggesting that it regulates a
key inflammatory pathway, thus promoting microglia ex-
pansion and invasive behavior. Previous reports have
shown that activation of CSF-1R by the agonist M-CSF or
interleukin 34 potently regulates macrophage/microglia
number and inflammatory phenotype in animal models
[26, 27]. Recent reports have shown that motor neurons
express M-CSF upon damage causing the expansion of
surrounding spinal microglial cells [9, 28], thus prompting
a pathogenic pathway where motor neuron pathology ex-
acerbates deleterious microgliosis. In accordance, M-CSF
levels are elevated in ALS patients as well as in ALS mouse
models and may represent a key pathway exacerbating
microgliosis and ALS progression [29–31]. Moreover, a
recent report has shown that CSF-1R blockade with the
drug GW2580 administered to ALS mice several weeks
before paralysis onset decreased both microgliosis and slo-
wed disease progression [32].
Although masitinib is a relatively selective kinase in-
hibitor [33] for CSF-1R, it also targets a few other tyro-
sine kinases such as PDGF-R, c-Kit, Lyn, and Fyn [10,
11], whose activation may also be associated with the
modulation of the neurodegenerative microenvironment.
A number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting specific
receptors have been approved over the last 5 years for
many different types of cancer. However, there are few
reports of central nervous system adverse effects or dir-
ect neuronal damage. The effect of masitinib, as well as
other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, is not selective for a
specific cell type, because it blocks several kinases
expressed in many cell types. However, masitinib is one
of the most selective kinase inhibitors currently in devel-
opment and as such, potentially exerts a low toxicity
profile [11]. In addition, the effects of inhibition of kin-
ase targeted by masitinib are more involved in cell pro-
liferation
(c-Kit,
PDGF-R,
and
MCSF/CSF-1R)
and
immune activation (Lyn, Fyn) than apoptosis. Thus,
post-mitotic cells and particularly neurons and resting
astrocytes are generally less vulnerable to pharmaco-
logical tyrosine kinase inhibition by masitinib as re-
ported previously [13, 34]. Furthermore, inhibition of
the non-receptor c-Abl kinase by imatinib has been
shown to prevent astrocyte-induced motor neuron death
in cell cultures [34], further suggesting an alternative
neuroprotective pathway unrelated to neuroinflamma-
tion. Such a unique combination of molecular effects
could explain our results showing the potent effect of
masitinib downregulating the expression of inflamma-
tory mediators, characteristic of deleterious aberrant
glial cell phenotype. Thus, further work will be required
to decipher the precise tyrosine kinases deregulated in
ALS and their pharmacological targeting.
The present study does not establish whether masiti-
nib targets inflammatory cells outside the CNS also
known to influence motor neuron degeneration [35, 36].
In particular, masitinib may target the peripheral mono-
cyte/macrophage system, which appears affected in ALS
animal models. Immunological downregulation of Ly6Chi

(water, n = 29, blue line) immediately after observation of paralysis
onset of one limb (day 1; n = 14, red line) or starting 7 days after
paralysis onset (day 7, n = 9, green line). There was a statistically
significant difference in the probability of survival for both
masitinib-treated groups when compared with vehicle-treated group,
according to the log-rank test of the Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.0006
for masitinib—gait onset vs. vehicle and p < 0.00025 for
masitinib—7 days onset vs. vehicle). b The graph shows the mean

 monocytes that infiltrate the degenerative spinal cord
attenuates motor neuron loss and delays disease progres-
sion in mutant SOD1 mice [37]. Masitinib could also tar-
get macrophages that infiltrate and promote degeneration
of peripheral motor axons [38]. Moreover, macrophage
activation and microgliosis are known to be influenced by
mast cells located inside or outside the blood-brain barrier
[39]. Because masitinib potently prevents mast cell differ-
entiation and activation [10], it could also indirectly regu-
late neuroinflammation by targeting mast cells through
the inhibition of c-Kit, Lyn, and Fyn. Future studies in
patients and animal models are needed to determine alter-
native mechanisms of action of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
and masitinib in ALS.
There are currently no effective treatments for ALS.
Riluzole, an anti-glutamatergic drug, is the sole authorized
product used in ALS, providing a modest improvement in
survival (~3 months) [40]. Over the past 10 years, a num-
ber of drugs were identified as providing survival benefits
in rodent preclinical trials [19]. However, none of them
proved to be clinically better than riluzole in ALS patients.
Such incongruence could be explained, at least in part, by
the fact that most animal studies that were translated to
clinical trials have been started before paralysis onset.
Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibition with masitinib ap-
pears unique among other ALS-developmental drugs be-
cause it exerts neuroprotection when administrated post-
paralysis. A randomized phase III clinical trial testing the
effect of masitinib in ALS patients is currently running
(Clinicaltrial.gov NCT02588677).
Conclusions
The present study shows that tyrosine kinase inhibition
with masitinib is capable of controlling microgliosis,
neuroinflammation, and the emergence/expansion of ab-
errant glial cells in SOD1G93A rats. Remarkably, masiti-
nib significantly prolonged survival when delivered after
paralysis onset, an unprecedented effect in preclinical
models of ALS, and therefore appears well-suited for
treating ALS where drug treatment is initiated only after
diagnosis based on overt motor symptoms.
