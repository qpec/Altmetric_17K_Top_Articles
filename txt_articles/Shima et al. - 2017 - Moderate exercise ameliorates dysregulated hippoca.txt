Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Type 2 diabetes is likely to be an independent
risk factor for hippocampal-based memory dysfunction,
although this complication has yet to be investigated in detail.
As dysregulated glycometabolism in peripheral tissues is a key
symptom of type 2 diabetes, it is hypothesised that diabetes-
mediated memory dysfunction is also caused by hippocampal
glycometabolic dysfunction. If so, such dysfunction should
also be ameliorated with moderate exercise by normalising
hippocampal glycometabolism, since 4 weeks of moderate
exercise enhances memory function and local hippocampal
glycogen levels in normal animals.
Methods The hippocampal glycometabolism in OLETF rats
(model of human type 2 diabetes) was assessed and,
subsequently, the effects of exercise on memory function
and hippocampal glycometabolism were investigated.
Results OLETF rats, which have memory dysfunction,
exhibited higher levels of glycogen in the hippocampus than
did control rats, and breakdown of hippocampal glycogen
with a single bout of exercise remained unimpaired.
However, OLETF rats expressed lower levels of hippocampal
monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2, a transporter for
lactate to neurons). Four weeks of moderate exercise
improved spatial memory accompanied by further increase
in hippocampal glycogen levels and restoration of MCT2
expression independent of neurotrophic factor and clinical
symptoms in OLETF rats.
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings are the first to
describe detailed profiles of glycometabolism in the type 2
diabetic hippocampus and to show that 4 weeks of moderate
exercise improves memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes via
amelioration of dysregulated hippocampal glycometabolism.
Dysregulated hippocampal lactate-transport-related
glycometabolism is a possible aetiology of type-2-diabetes-
mediated memory dysfunction.

 Introduction
Type 2 diabetes induces several complications, not only in
peripheral organs but also in the central nervous system; in
particular, hippocampal dysfunction, such as memory
dysfunction, is now considered one such complication [1–4].
Hippocampal dysfunction in type 2 diabetes is a serious
disability that impairs patient wellbeing and is also associated
with the development of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and
depression [5, 6]. Therefore, it is critical to understand its
aetiology and to innovate therapeutic strategies for diabetes-
induced hippocampal memory dysfunction.
Although there are some factors and/or conditions reported
to be involved in diabetes-induced memory dysfunction, such
as inflammation, oxidative stress, decreased growth factors
(i.e. brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) [7, 8], the
association of memory dysfunction with hippocampal
glycometabolism in type 2 diabetes is yet to be clarified.
Indeed, disturbance/alteration of glycometabolism is a
common symptom of diabetes complications. Excess glycogen
deposition has already been demonstrated in the heart of
diabetes mellitus patients as an adaptation process [9, 10],
but detailed characterisation of alteration in hippocampal
glycogen levels in type 2 diabetes has not yet been explored.
Glucose imported from blood through GLUTs is
considered to be a dominant energy source for enhancement
of neuronal activity; however, recent studies have shown that
lactate is used as an energy substrate [11, 12] and
neuromodulator [13] in the hippocampus to enhance memory
formation [13–15]. Lactate is taken up from the blood and is
also generated from glycogen stored in astrocytes via
glycogenolysis and glycolysis [11]. Brain glycogen-derived
lactate is transferred to neurons through monocarboxylate
transporters (MCTs). Previous studies have demonstrated that
MCT2 expressed in neurons plays a role in lactate uptake into
neurons [16] and downregulated expression and function of
MCT2 induces memory dysfunction [13, 14]. Therefore,
memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes might be caused, at
least partially, by diminished utilisation of lactate through
downregulated MCT2 expression in the hippocampus.
Because it normalises glycometabolism in peripheral
organs [17–21], exercise is useful as a treatment for type 2
diabetes [22]. Exercise enhances memory function in healthy
mammals [23–25] and in animal models of type 1 diabetes
[26–28]. We demonstrated that hippocampal glycogen
increases in non-diabetic rats after 4 weeks of moderate-
intensity exercise [29] and that this also enhances memory
function [30]. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that
exercise improves the downregulated expression of MCT
series in peripheral organs in type 2 diabetes [31, 32] and
increases the expression of hippocampal MCTseries in in type
1 diabetes [33]. Based on these findings, we hypothesised that
4 weeks of moderate exercise would improve memory
dysfunction in type 2 diabetes through improvement of
hippocampal lactate transport by adaptations in glycogen
levels and expression of MCTs.
In the current study, we investigated whether hippocampal
lactate-transport-related glycometabolism is impaired in a
rat model of type 2 diabetes and, subsequently, whether a
regimen of 4 weeks of moderate-intensity exercise
improves spatial memory dysfunction associated with
adaptation of hippocampal lactate-transport-related
glycometabolism.
Methods
Animals
Four-week-old male Otsuka Long–Evans Tokushima Fatty
(OLETF) rats (model of human type 2 diabetes) and their
genetic control Long–Evans Tokushima (LETO) rats were
obtained from Hoshino Laboratory Animals (Ibaraki, Japan).
OLETF rats, which were established in 1992 as the animal
model for type 2 diabetes, exhibit memory dysfunction and
hyperglycaemia after 8 and 18 weeks of age, respectively.
Almost all OLETF rats exhibit symptoms of type 2 diabetes,
such as hyperinsulinaemia, by 25 weeks of age and display
symptoms of type 1 diabetes, such as hypoinsulinaemia, after
40 weeks of age. LETO rats, which were developed from the
same colony by selective mating but did not develop diabetes,
served as genetic counterpart controls. OLETF and LETO rats
were housed and cared for in an animal facility, fed a standard
pellet diet (MF; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) and given free
access to water. The room temperature was maintained at
22–24°C under a 12 h light–dark cycle (light on
07:00–19:00 hours). All experiments were conducted in
accordance with the University of Tsukuba Animal
Experiment Committee guidelines.
Habituation to treadmill running
At 26 weeks of age, the OLETF and LETO rats were
habituated to running on a treadmill (SN-460; Shinano,
Tokyo, Japan) using the protocol of previous studies [29,
34]. The running duration was set at 30 min/day and the
running speed was gradually increased from 5 to 25 m/min
for a total of five sessions over 6 days.
Single bout of exercise
Rats were subjected to exercise for 30 min on a treadmill at
moderate-intensity (OLETF rats, 12.5 m/min; LETO rats,
20 m/min) based on their lactate threshold (OLETF rats
22.6±0.3 m/min; LETO rats, 28.3±1.8 m/min) determined
according to the method of Beaver et al [35].

 Exercise regimen
OLETF and LETO rats were randomly divided into a
sedentary group and an exercise group. After exercise
habituation, the exercise groups of both breeds were made
to run on a treadmill at moderate intensity for 4 weeks
(30 min/day, 5 days/week).
Morris water maze test
Hippocampal function in rats was evaluated using the Morris
water maze test, which was previously established in our
laboratory [36, 37]. The water maze consists of a circular pool,
150 cm in diameter and 45 cm in depth, with an invisible
platform (12 cm in diameter; Plexiglas) located in the centre
of one quadrant. The platform’s top was 2 cm below the
surface of the water. The experimental room contained some
extra-maze cues, and their positions were not changed during
the testing period. Although all four start points were used
during the period of the study, the order in which they were
used varied every day. Rats were given a maximum of 60 s to
reach the platform and were hand-guided to it if they failed to
find it within 60 s. After climbing onto the platform, rats were
allowed to remain there for 10 s. During the test period,
swimming time (s, escape latency), swim length (cm) and
speed (cm/s) were recorded semi-automatically by a video
tracking system (35C67-AC5; PANLAB, Barcelona, Spain).
Twenty-four hours after the last spatial learning session, the
platform was removed from the pool and rats were allowed
60 s probe trial to search for it. The time rats spent in the
quadrants that the platform had been placed during spatial
learning (s) was measured using the same system.
Blood glucose and HbA1c assays
Glucose levels in blood collected from the jugular vein were
measured using an automated glucose–lactate analyser
(2300 Stat Plus; YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). We
outsourced measurement of HbA1c levels to the Oriental
Yeast Co. (Shiga, Japan).
Tissue preparation
Following acute or regular exercise regimen, rats were
anaesthetised with isoflurane (30% isoflurane in propylene
glycol; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Osaka, Japan) in
a bell jar and killed using high-power microwave irradiation
(10 kW, 1.4 s; NJE-2603; New Japan Radio Co., Tokyo,
Japan). The hippocampus was collected using a modified
version of Hirano et al’s method [38]. Muscles and liver were
also collected. All samples were stored at −80°C for
subsequent biochemical analysis.
Glycogen and lactate assays
A modified form of the Kong et al method [39] was used for
the measurement of glycogen in the hippocampus, muscles
and liver [29, 34] (for details see ESM Methods).
Hippocampal lactate levels were detected using ENZYTEC
L-Lactic acid (E1254; J. K. International, Tokyo, Japan).
Western blot analysis
Powdered hippocampus was homogenised in LB-TT [38].
Proteins (10 μg) in SDS were loaded on a 5–20%
polyacrylamide gradient gel (ATTO Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). The gel was then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (RPN2020F; GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK). The membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (154 mmol/l NaCl)
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h and then incubated
for 10 h at 4°C with primary antibodies (see ESM Methods).
After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with
secondary antibodies (see ESM Methods). Immunocomplexes
were made visible using chemiluminescence analysis with the
Chemilumi One Super Kit (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The signals were
digitally scanned and then quantified using image analysis
software (GE Healthcare, Bio-Science). Protein levels
were normalised to the band intensity of β-actin and
phosphorylated protein levels were detected and normalised
by total cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB),
glycogen synthase (GS) and GS kinase-3β (GSK-3β),
respectively.
Statistical analysis
No data were excluded from the analysis. Data were expressed
as mean ± SEM and were analysed using Prism version 5
(MDF, Tokyo, Japan). Comparisons of two groups were
performed using an unpaired Student’s t test. Pearson’s
correlation analysis was performed on the entire population
of experimental rats, both diabetic (OLETF) and control rats
(LETO), according to previously published methods [2, 40].
Group comparisons were performed using two-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni post hoc tests. Statistical significance was set
at p<0.05.
Results
Physiological and biochemical variables
Physiological and biochemical variables of LETO and
OLETF rats are shown in Table 1. OLETF rats exhibited
increased body weight (p < 0.01), fat-to-body weight ratio

599
 (p<0.01) and hyperphagia (p<0.001) compared with LETO
rats. In addition, OLETF rats were hyperglycaemic (p<0.001)
and exhibited higher HbA1c levels (p<0.001).
Memory dysfunction
OLETF rats took five times longer than LETO rats to swim
onto the platform (effect of day F(3, 174)=15.87, p<0.001;
effect of group F(1, 58)=73.41, p<0.001; OLETF rats 34.5
±3.9 s vs LETO rats 6.6±1.0 s at trial on day 4). The escape
path taken by OLETF rats was threefold longer (effect of day
F(3, 174) = 21.63, p < 0.001; effect of group F(1, 58) = 11.61,
p < 0.001; OLETF rats 538.5 ± 63.4 cm vs LETO rats
166.3± 25.0 cm at trial on day 4). The OLETF rats swam
significantly slower than LETO rats (effect of day
F(3, 174) = 6.52, p < 0.001; effect of group F(1, 58) = 192.1,
p < 0.001; OLETF rats 21.1 ± 0.6 cm/s vs LETO rats
27.0 ± 0.6 cm/s at trial on day 4). OLETF rats spent
significantly less time than LETO rats in the quadrants in
which the platform had been placed during probe trials
(OLETF rats 14.5±2.9 s vs LETO rats 20.9±1.0 s, p<0.05).
Glycogen levels in hippocampus and breakdown
of glycogen with a single bout of exercise
OLETF rats exhibited significantly higher glycogen levels
(about 30%) in the hippocampus compared with LETO rats
(Fig. 1a; p<0.01). Additionally, hippocampal glycogen levels
showed a positive significant correlation with circulatory
HbA1c levels (Fig. 1b; r = 0.78, p < 0.001). Hippocampal
glycogen levels (based on lactate threshold as an index of
moderate-intensity exercise) in both OLETF and LETO rats
decreased significantly after a single bout of exercise (Fig. 2a;
effect of diabetes F(1, 27)=42.3, p<0.001; effect of exercise
F(1, 27)=57.4, p<0.001; interaction F(1, 27)=9.35, p<0.01).
Furthermore, the rate of glycogen decrease had a significant
positive correlation with the rate of local lactate increase in the
hippocampus of exercised rats (Fig. 2b; r=0.59, p<0.05).
Hippocampal MCT2 expression
Hippocampal MCT2 expression decreased significantly
(about 20%) in OLETF rats compared with LETO rats
(Fig. 1c; p < 0.05). In addition, hippocampal MCT2
expression exhibited a significant inverse correlation with
circulatory HbA1c levels (Fig. 1d; r= 0.50, p<0.05).

 Effects of exercise regimen on OLETF rats
Physiological and biochemical variables Symptoms of type
2 diabetes, such as increased body weight and ratio of fat,
hyperphagia and hyperglycaemia, were unchanged after
4 weeks of exercise intervention in OLETF rats (Table 2).
Memory dysfunction Following exercise, the escape latency
(Fig. 3a; effects of exercise F(1, 108) = 12.63 on day 2,
F(1, 108)=9.97 on day 3, F(1, 108)=21.82 on day 4, p<0.001;
interaction F(1, 108)=13.94 on day 4, p<0.001) and the swim
path length (Fig. 3b; effect of exercise F(1, 108)=7.05 on day 2,
F(1, 108)=9.16 on day 3, p<0.01, F(1, 108)=19.03 on day 4,
p<0.001; interaction F(1, 108)=9.00 on day 4, p<0.01) of
OLETF rats were shortened, without alteration of the speed of
swimming, at trials on days 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 3c). The time spent
by OLETF rats in the platform area also improved after 4 weeks
of exercise (Fig. 3d; effect of exercise F(1, 24)=4.69, p<0.05;
effect of diabetes F(1, 24)=6.38, p<0.05).
Hippocampal glycogen levels Elevated hippocampal
glycogen levels in OLETF rats increased further (by about
10%) after 4 weeks of exercise (Fig. 4a; effect of exercise
F(1, 24) = 9.78, p < 0.01; effect of diabetes F(1, 24) = 146.3,
p<0.001). OLETF rats exhibited much higher total GS levels
in the hippocampus compared with LETO rats, although
exercise had no effect on total GS level (Fig. 4d; effect of
diabetes F(1, 49) = 12.3, p < 0.001; sedentary LETO rats
100%, sedentary OLETF rats 138%, exercised OLETF rats
155%). Phosphorylated GS levels were unaffected by diabetes
or exercise (Fig. 4d). On the other hand, glycogen levels in
muscle and liver were not altered by the exercise regimen in
OLETF rats (Fig. 4b, c).
HippocampalexpressionsofMCTseriesDownregulated MCT2
expression in OLETF rats was restored (almost 100%) following
4 weeks of exercise intervention (Fig. 5a; interaction
F(1, 49)=4.85, p<0.05). MCT1 and MCT4 were unaffected by
type 2 diabetes or 4 weeks of exercise (Fig. 5b, c).
Hippocampal expression of GLUT series Astrocytic
GLUT1 expression (as determined by molecular weight of
immunoblotting band [41]), which plays a role in astrocytic
glucose uptake, was significantly lower in OLETF rats than in
LETO rats, but the exercise regimen greatly restored its levels
(Fig. 6a; interaction F(1, 49)=7.83, p<0.01). Expression of
endothelial GLUT1, which plays a role in releasing glucose
from blood to extracellular fluid, increased with the exercise
regimen in OLETF rats (Fig. 6a; effect of exercise
F(1, 49)=5.26, p<0.05) irrespective of the unaltered symptom
state of OLETF rats compared with that in LETO rats.
Expression of GLUT3, which plays a role in neuronal glucose
uptake, was unaffected by type 2 diabetes or 4 weeks of
exercise (Fig. 6b).

 Hippocampal levels of protein-related neuroplasticity
OLETF rats exhibited significantly lower levels of BDNF in
the hippocampus compared with LETO control rats and the
decreased BDNF levels were not improved by 4 weeks of
exercise (Fig. 7a; effect of diabetes F(1, 49)=14.6, p<0.001;
sedentary OLETF rats 82%, exercised OLETF rats 88%,
based on sedentary LETO rats as 100%). Levels of tyrosine
receptor kinase B (TrkB), phosphorylated CREB and
GSK-3β levels in the hippocampus were not altered by type
2 diabetes or exercise (Fig. 7b–d).
Effect of exercise regimen on LETO rats
Food intake and ratio of fat decreased after 4 weeks of exercise
in LETO rats (Table 2). Escape latency (Fig. 3a; p<0.001) and
swim path length (Fig. 3b; p<0.01) shortened without altering
swim speed (Fig. 3c) on day 2 after 4 weeks of exercise inter-
vention in LETO rats. In addition, the time spent in the
platform area was prolonged in exercised LETO rats com-
pared with non-exercised rats (Fig. 3d; p < 0.05).
Concurrently, exercise increased glycogen levels in the
hippocampus (Fig. 4a; p<0.01), muscle (Fig. 4b; p<0.05)
and liver (Fig. 4c; p < 0.05) and increased endothelial
GLUT1 expression (Fig. 6a; p<0.05) in LETO rats, although
levels of hippocampal MCT2, MCT1 and MCT4 (Fig. 5a–c)
and astrocytic GLUT1 and GLUT3 (Fig. 6a, b) remained
unchanged. Furthermore, exercise significantly increased
BDNF levels (Fig. 7a; p<0.05) but not levels of TrkB or
phosphorylated CREB and GSK-3β in the hippocampus
(Fig. 7b–d).
Discussion
The current findings show that OLETF rats exhibit diminished
expression of MCT2 and higher glycogen levels in their

 hippocampus, together with memory dysfunction, compared
with genetic control LETO rats. Interestingly, 4 weeks of
moderate exercise normalised MCT2 levels and further
enhanced hippocampal glycogen levels and significantly
ameliorated spatial memory dysfunction, without any changes
in clinical symptoms.
Consistent with earlier reports [42–44], the OLETF rats in
this study showed significant dysfunction of spatial memory,
thus supporting the appropriateness of their use as a model for
spatial memory dysfunction. OLETF rats exhibited increased
hippocampal glycogen levels compared with genetic control
LETO rats (Fig. 1a). Although tissue-specific alterations in
glycogen levels have been demonstrated in other diabetic
complications, such as cardiomyopathy [10], the current study
is the first to report enhanced glycogen levels in the
hippocampus of diabetic rats, with an elevated expression of
GS (Fig. 4d). Considering previous findings that epileptic
patients with memory dysfunction exhibit elevated
hippocampal glycogen and GS content [45], it could be
posited that hippocampal hyper-glycogen is a feature of a
number of disorders with hippocampal dysfunction; this needs
further research. Additionally, hippocampal glycogen levels
of rats in the current study had a significant positive
correlation with circulatory HbA1c levels (Fig. 1b), suggesting
that glycogen levels in the diabetic hippocampus may be
related to the circulatory glycaemic state. Our current findings
are in contrast to those of a previous study in which Zucker
Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats (another established model of type 2
diabetes) did not exhibit high glycogen levels in the
hippocampus when compared with control rats [46].
However, the difference in data between the two studies is
likely due to the methodological difference; the earlier study
killed rats using 4 kW microwave irradiation [46] instead of
10 kW, which is ideal for detecting brain glycogen levels
correctly [39]. Indeed, we have confirmed that ZDF rats killed
by 10 kW microwave irradiation exhibit elevated
hippocampal glycogen levels (ZDF 18.2 ± 0.88 μmol/g;
control 12.6 ± 0.47 μmol/g; p < 0.001) consistent with
OLETF rats.
OLETF rats exhibited downregulated hippocampal MCT2
expression compared with the control rats (Fig. 1c). Further, a
significant inverse correlation was noted between low

 hippocampal MCT2 expression and circulatory HbA1c levels
(Fig. 1d). Thus, the circulatory glycaemic state appears to
affect the basal MCT2 expression similarly to glycogen levels
in the diabetic hippocampus. Importantly, we found that a
single bout of exercise enhanced hippocampal glycogen
breakdown and lactate production in the diabetic
hippocampus (Fig. 2). Based on our findings, elevated
hippocampal glycogen in diabetic rats may be an adaptive
change to compensate for the decreased lactate and glucose
utilisation possibly induced by downregulated MCT2 and
astrocytic GLUT1 expression in the hippocampus (Fig. 1c,
5a, 6a). Additionally, hippocampal expression of GLUT3
was unaffected by type 2 diabetes (Fig. 6b). Thus, we suggest
that the dysregulated MCT2-mediated neuronal uptake of
lactate possibly contributes to the aetiology of memory
dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
A notable finding of the current study is the improvement
of spatial memory dysfunction in diabetic rats after 4 weeks of
moderate-intensity exercise (Fig. 3), with no change in clinical
circulatory profiles (Table 2). The lack of effect on clinical
variables may be due to the relatively short duration of the
exercise regimen since earlier animal studies with longer
exercise interventions reported improvement [47, 48]. This
exercise regimen could be utilised as a basis in developing
new treatment for cerebral complications in type 2 diabetes.
In contrast, a previous study demonstrated that long-term
exercise intervention (brisk walking, 175 min weekly for
6 months) did not alter cognitive function in patients with type
2 diabetes [49]. Note that this study in humans examined
cognitive function, such as executive function and verbal
memory, but not spatial memory.
Hippocampal glycogen levels in rats with type 2 diabetes
further increased with 4 weeks of exercise (Fig. 4a). We
interpret these data as an adaptation by which to enhance
lactate production. Although exercise-induced enhancement
of hippocampal glycogen levels would be partially due to
enhancement of glucose uptake in astrocytes via exercise-
mediated GLUT1 upregulation (Fig. 6a), the functional
relevance needs to be investigated in depth. Further, in the
same experimental animals, muscular and hepatic glycogen
levels were unaltered after exercise (Fig. 4b, c). Thus, these
findings lead us to postulate that the brain in type 2 diabetes
has a higher sensitivity to exercise than do peripheral tissues in
terms of glycometabolism.
Notably, while the expression of MCT1 and MCT4 was
unaltered (Fig. 5b, c), the exercise regimen normalised
MCT2 levels in the diabetic hippocampus (Fig. 5a). Since an
increase in MCT2 expression enhances lactate uptake into
neurons [33, 50], it is conceivable that the exercise regimen
improved MCT2-mediated lactate uptake in diabetic neurons.
While MCT2 expression was restored, hippocampal protein
levels related to neuronal glucose uptake (GLUT3) and
neuroplasticity (BDNF, TrkB, CREB, GSK-3β) were
unaltered in OLETF rats by exercise intervention. Although
hippocampal BDNF levels are decreased in type 2 diabetes, as
revealed by the current findings and in agreement with other
published articles [8], the short duration of the exercise
regimen may explain the unaltered levels of BDNF since
longer exercise intervention has been shown to improve its
levels [51]. Further, we did not observe exercise-induced
upregulation of phosphorylated CREB, although lactate was
shown to increase phosphorylated CREB in a previous study
[13]. These data led us to speculate that the CREB
phosphorylation site (Ser-133) may not be related to, or that
other phosphorylation sites of CREB may be related to,
type-2-diabetes-mediated memory dysfunction, warranting
in-depth future studies. Based on our findings, we suggest that
enhancing the supply of glycogen-derived lactate to neurons
via increase in glycogen levels and MCT2 expression may
contribute to exercise-induced improvement of memory
dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
Consistent with other reports [29, 36], we also confirmed
that the exercise regimen increases hippocampal glycogen and
BDNF levels and, concurrently, enhances spatial memory in
control LETO rats. In contrast, the molecular alteration in
lactate transporters was only observed in the OLETF rat
hippocampus after exercise (Fig. 5a) and not in LETO rats.
Thus, the present findings imply that the molecular pathways
underlying memory improvement after 4 weeks of moderate
exercise are different in control condition and type 2 diabetes.
Collectively, exercise has effects on the hippocampus that are
specific to type 2 diabetes; this reinforces the notion of
profound brain dysregulation in this disease.
The current study has several limitations. First, the in vivo
nature of this study poses technical difficulties; it was not
feasible to fully delineate the temporal profiles of glycogen
and associated molecules such as MCT2 before and after
exercise treatment. Second, we did not investigate the effects
of the exercise regimen used in the current study on other
factors reported to be involved in diabetes-induced memory
dysfunction, such as inflammation or oxidative stress. Third,
we did not distinguish the spatial memory dysfunction
reported here from other forms of memory dysfunction
or determine how these may relate to exercise in
type-2-diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction. Indeed, the
effect of exercise on memory is a new entity that has only just
begun to be appreciated and warrants further investigation.
Finally, due to the current experimental design and settings,
it was not possible to completely clarify the link between the
effects of diabetes and exercise on memory based solely on
the results presented in this article, and further studies are
warranted in this regard.
Here, we found that 4 weeks of moderate-intensity exercise
improves memory dysfunction in a rat model of type 2
diabetes, accompanied by increased glycogen levels and
restoration of MCT2 expression in the hippocampus. Our
604

 findings suggest that dysregulation of MCT2-mediated
neuronal uptake of lactate in the diabetic hippocampus may
contribute to the aetiology of spatial memory dysfunction and
that moderate exercise could be used as a treatment for
type-2-diabetes-induced memory dysfunction.
