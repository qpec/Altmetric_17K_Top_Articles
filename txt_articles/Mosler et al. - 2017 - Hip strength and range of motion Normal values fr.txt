Abstract
2
Objectives: 
3
To determine the normal profiles for hip strength and range of motion (ROM) in a 
4
professional football league in Qatar, and examine the effect of leg dominance, age, past 
5
history of injury, and ethnicity on these profiles.

Design:
8
Cross-sectional cohort study
9
10
Methods: 
11
Participants included 394 asymptomatic, male professional football players, aged 18-40 
12
years. Strength was measured using a hand held dynamometer with an eccentric test in 
13
side-lying for hip adduction (ADD) and abduction (ABD), and the squeeze test in supine with 
14
45° hip flexion. Range of motion measures included: hip internal (IR) and external rotation 
15
(ER) in 90° flexion, hip IR in prone, bent knee fall out (BKFO) and hip ABD in side-lying.
16
Demographic information was collected and the effect on the profiles was analysed using
17
linear mixed models with repeated measures. 
18
19
Results:
20
Strength values (mean±SD) were: ADD=3.0±0.6 Nm/kg, ABD=2.6±0.4 Nm/kg, ADD/ABD 
21
ratio=1.2±0.2, Squeeze test=3.6±0.8 N/kg. ROM values: IR in flexion=32±8°, ER=38±8°, IR 
22
in prone=38±8°, BKFO=13±4.4cm, ABD in side-lying=50±7.3°. Leg dominance had no
23
clinically relevant effect on these profiles. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age had a 
24
minor influence on squeeze strength (-0.03N/kg/year), ER (-0.30°/year) and ABD range 
25
(0.19°/year) but past history of injury, and ethnicity did not.

Normal values are documented for hip strength and ROM that can be used as reference 
1
profiles in the clinical assessment, screening, and management of professional football 
2
players. Leg dominance, recent past injury history and ethnicity do not need to be accounted
3
for when using these profiles for comparison purposes.

Introduction
2
Hip and groin injuries are common in football, causing time loss and performance reduction 
3
for a player and their team.1–3 Measurement of hip strength and range of motion (ROM) are 
4
key features of clinical assessment to determine both treatment response and inform the 
5
clinician on the footballer’s readiness to return to play. Weakness of hip adduction (ADD)
6
has previously been identified as a risk factor for groin injury in football,4,5 while there is 
7
conflicting evidence of reduced ROM being a risk factor.5 Normal values for hip strength and 
8
ROM, using reliable tests with low measurement error, are therefore essential to both the 
9
screening and management of hip and groin pain in football.
10
11
Hip strength assessment is recommended for the clinical evaluation of athletes with hip/groin 
12
pain,6 as well as for other lower limb injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament injury7 and 
13
patellofemoral pain syndrome.8  Consequently, many different methods of assessing ADD9
14
and abduction8 (ABD) strength have been described.10–12 Methodology differs in: population 
15
studied, mode of testing, devices used, number of repetitions, rest time between 
16
contractions, and the use of an average or maximum score, making comparison between 
17
studies difficult. 
18
19
Eccentric ADD strength assessment has been found to be better than isometric at 
20
differentiating players with hip/groin pain from those without.12 In a prospective study that 
21
used similar test methods, professional ice hockey players that developed groin pain had 
22
lower eccentric ADD/ABD strength ratios than the asymptomatic players.11 Similarly, reduced
23
squeeze strength was found to precede the development of groin pain in Australian football 
24
players.13 While good to excellent reliability has been demonstrated for these methods,10,14,15
25
the practicing clinician is hampered by a lack of normal comparison data to use in the daily 
26
management of football players.

Hip joint ROM has been examined extensively, but also with considerable variation in 
2
positions tested,12,16,17 devices used15,18 and population studied.15,19 These variations make it 
3
difficult for such data to be useful for clinical reference purposes. Additionally, there have 
4
been relatively few reports of hip ROM in the football population. Establishing normal values
5
for hip ROM in professional football players may assist in the management of hip and groin
6
pain.
7
8
The primary aim of this study was to determine the normal profiles for strength and ROM
9
relevant to hip and groin pain in professional football players. Secondary aims were to 
10
determine the effect that limb dominance, age, past history of time loss hip/groin injury from 
11
the previous season, and ethnicity had on these profiles. 
12
13
Methods
14
All study participants were male professional football players, over 18 years of age, playing 
15
in the Qatar Stars League (QSL). Players presented to the Rehabilitation Department of 
16
Aspetar Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Hospital for their annual, Fédération 
17
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) compliant, pre-competition medical 
18
assessment during the 2014-15 season as previously described.20 The majority of players 
19
were tested either in the pre-season (37%) or in the early competition phase (54%), with the 
20
remaining 9% of the cohort tested around the club transfer window between December-
21
March. All players who competed for QSL clubs that season were screened, and if they were
22
asymptomatic they were eligible for inclusion in the study. Demographic information 
23
pertaining to age, height, weight, leg dominance, current and past history of hip/groin pain, 
24
and ethnicity was obtained prior to testing. Leg dominance was defined as the limb preferred 
25
for a penalty kick. Data were excluded from any player reporting current hip or groin pain 
26
either during training or match play, regardless of whether the pain resulted in time loss, to 
27
ensure that the strength and ROM profiles are for asymptomatic football players. Past history 
28

7
was defined as a time loss hip or groin injury sustained in the previous season. All 
1
participants provided informed consent for the study and ethical approval was obtained from 
2
the Institutional Review Board, Anti-doping Lab Qatar on 22/7/2013, Approval number: 
3
F2013000003.
4
5
All test procedures were performed by sports physiotherapists who had received a minimum 
6
of 5 hours training in the methods. Standardized data collection forms were used to record 
7
all data. For detailed descriptions of the equipment and procedures used for the data 
8
collection, please see Appendix 1. Inter-rater reliability for the adductor squeeze and all 
9
ROM measures was examined in the screening setting with two testers used from a pool of 
10
six trained sports physiotherapists. Eccentric ADD and ABD strength inter-rater reliability 
11
was examined outside the screening setting to prevent fatigue of the football players 
12
potentially affecting the reliability results. Two testers conducted these strength measures on 
13
21 physically active men (≥ 3hrs physical activity per week).
14
15
Eccentric ADD and ABD strength were measured in the side-lying position (Appendix 1) 
16
using a hand-held dynamometer (HHD) (PowerTrack II Commander, JTECH Medical) and 
17
the break test as described previously.10 The rest time between contractions was shortened 
18
to 30 seconds as recommended in a subsequent paper.6 Eccentric strength measures were 
19
normalized to body weight and lever arm and reported as Newton-metres per kg (Nm/kg), 
20
with the maximum score used for data analysis. Bilateral ADD strength was normalised to 
21
body weight and measured using a single test with the HHD placed between the knees with 
22
hip flexion 45°, as previously described.9,21,22
23
                                                                                        
24
Hip ROM was measured using the following tests; internal rotation (IR) in both 90° hip flexion 
25
and prone, external rotation (ER) in 90° hip flexion, ABD in side-lying and bent knee fall out
26
(BKFO), based on previously described methods.15,18 Hip IR and ER in 90° flexion were
27
 Page 8 of 19

8
measured using a goniometer18 and two repetitions were taken for each measure (Appendix
1
1). Hip IR in prone15 was measured using digital inclinometers, and three repetitions were 
2
taken. The pelvis was deemed to be level by visual assessment of the tester (Appendix 1).
3
BKFO was measured with a single test.15 Hip ABD range was measured in side-lying with a 
4
newly developed test (Appendix 1) using a digital inclinometer, and three repetitions were 
5
taken. The average score for each ROM measure were used for data analysis.
6
7
All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21. Inter-rater reliability
8
results are included in Appendix 2. The demographic data and the data for each strength 
9
and ROM measure were first examined for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and visual 
10
inspection of data distribution histograms, and found to be normally distributed. Descriptive 
11
statistics were conducted for all the demographic, strength, and ROM variables. Comparison 
12
between the participant and non-participant groups for demographic data was conducted 
13
using independent t-tests. The effect of dominance on each strength and ROM measure 
14
(apart from adductor squeeze strength) was determined using linear mixed model analysis to 
15
generate pairwise comparisons between the dominant and non-dominant leg with Bonferroni 
16
adjustment for multiple comparisons. The strength and ROM measure were entered as the 
17
dependent variable, and dominance entered as the fixed effect. To investigate the effects of 
18
age, past injury history, and ethnicity, linear mixed model analysis was performed with each
19
measure entered as the dependent variable: age, past injury history, and ethnicity entered
20
independently as fixed effects, and side as a repeated measure to account for the correlation
21
between the right and left legs of each individual. The data file was split by side to analyse
22
adductor squeeze strength. For measures where more than one fixed effect was found to 
23
significantly influence the dependent variable, a multivariate analysis was performed.

A total of 419 male footballers presented for screening for the 2014-15 QSL season. Five 
1
football players refused consent for their screening data to be used for research purposes, 
2
one player was under 18 years of age and 19 players presented with current hip or groin 
3
pain, resulting in 394 study participants. Demographic data for the cohort are summarised in 
4
table 1 and the ethnic distribution of the cohort is shown in Appendix 3 (Table A). There were 
5
no statistically significant differences in demographics found between the participant and 
6
non-participant groups, Table 1. A total of 71 (18%) study participants presented with a past 
7
history of time loss hip/groin injury in the season prior to screening.
8
9
The results for inter-rater reliability (ICC) and measurement error for all strength and ROM 
10
measures are summarised in Appendix 2.
11
12
Normal strength values are presented in Table 2, with division in leg dominance for eccentric 
13
ADD, ABD and ADD/ABD ratio. No statistically significant differences between the dominant 
14
and non-dominant legs were found for eccentric ADD, ABD strength or ADD/ABD ratio.
15
There was no effect of age found on eccentric hip ADD or ABD strength (p=0.17-0.30), 
16
however age had a very small, but statistically significant, negative influence on the 
17
ADD/ABD ratio (slope=-0.005/year, p=0.01). Age also had a statistically significant, though 
18
small, negative influence on adductor squeeze strength (slope=-0.03N/kg/year, p<0.001). 
19
Past history of injury did not have a statistically significant effect on strength scores for 
20
eccentric ADD, ABD, ADD/ABD ratio or adductor squeeze (p=0.15-0.56). There were no 
21
statistically significant influences of ethnicity on the eccentric ADD, ABD or ADD/ABD ratios 
22
in our cohort (Appendix 3, Table A). The football players of Black ethnicity demonstrated 
23
lower squeeze strength scores than the Arabic players (mean difference=0.32 Nm/kg, 
24
p=0.029), however this effect was not significant when age was added as a covariate to the 
25
multivariate model (p=0.802, Appendix 3, Table A).

Normal ROM values are presented in Table 2 and did not differ between the dominant and 
1
non-dominant leg for hip ER, BKFO and ABD. There was a small, statistically significant 
2
difference between legs for hip IR when measured in flexion (p=0.012) and in prone 
3
(p<0.001). The differences between the means was 0.9° for hip IR in flexion and 2.1° for hip 
4
IR in prone. Age had a significant, negative influence on ER (slope=-0.29°/year, p<0.001)
5
and ABD range (slope=-0.19°/year, p=0.009). Past history of injury influenced both ER 
6
(mean difference=2°, p=0.032) and BKFO range (mean difference=1.5cm, p=0.008). There 
7
were inconsistent patterns of the effect of ethnicity on the ROM measures (Appendix 3,
8
Table A). Multivariate analysis for the ROM measures including the co-variable of age found 
9
that the only fixed effect that remained statistically significant was age for ER and BKFO.
10
11
Discussion
12
We examined the normal profiles for hip strength and range of motion measures of 
13
relevance to hip and groin pain in 394 asymptomatic, male professional football players. 
14
There were no clinically relevant differences found between the dominant and non-dominant 
15
leg for these measures. Age, past history of time loss injury from the previous season, and 
16
ethnicity were all found to have small, but statistically significant, effects on some of the 
17
normative profiles when analysed as univariate factors. However, with multivariate analysis,
18
the small effect of past history and ethnicity were found to be covariates with age.
19
20
Eccentric ADD strength normalized to body weight and limb length was 3.0±0.6 Nm/kg, with
21
no differences between the dominant and non-dominant leg. A previous study12 on eccentric 
22
ADD strength in football players using the same method found a mean value of 3.1Nm/kg, 
23
similar to our data. Eccentric ABD strength was 2.6±0.4 Nm/kg in our cohort, which is the 
24
first reporting of this measurement in a large population of professional footballers. Another
25
study that examined nine young (19.5±1.5yrs) football players found lower mean scores than 
26
our cohort for ADD (dominant=2.8 Nm/kg, non-dominant=2.5 Nm/kg) but similar scores for 
27
ABD (2.5 Nm/kg), and a difference of 13% for ADD between the dominant and non-dominant 
28
 Page 11 of 19

11
legs of their participants.10 However, the differences between these findings and those of our 
1
study might be explained by the differences in sample size, and the lower mean age of the 
2
participants in the previous study. Low ADD strength has been shown to be a risk factor for 
3
hip and groin injury,4,5 so the normal range to one SD and two SD (Table 2) presented in this 
4
study can now be used to identify football players who may be at risk of injury, or have failed 
5
to regain normal strength following injury. For these weaker players, simple exercises can be 
6
used to improve eccentric ADD strength23 and may be an effective injury prevention strategy.
7
8
The ratio of hip ADD/ABD in our study was found to be 1.2±0.2, which is higher than the 
9
previously reported ADD/ABD ratio of asymptomatic professional ice hockey players
10
(mean=0.95).11 These differences might be explained by the differing sport specific demands 
11
of football compared with ice hockey, and consequently the risk profile for groin injuries in 
12
football may also differ. Tyler et al11 found that ice hockey players with an ADD/ABD ratio of 
13
less than 0.8 were 17 times more likely to sustain a groin injury. The data in our cohort 
14
suggests that the injury risk threshold might be higher in football players.The normal (within 
15
1SD) range for the ADD/ABD ratio was 0.9-1.4, therefore a player found to have a ratio less 
16
than 0.9 may be recommended to strengthen their adductors to potentially reduce their risk 
17
of hip and groin injury.
18
19
The normal strength range for the adductor squeeze test was 3.6±0.8 Nm/kg in our cohort. 
20
This test has been examined previously,15,17,21 however our study is the first to demonstrate 
21
adductor squeeze strength values normalized to body weight. Since weight strongly
22
correlates with strength scores, it is difficult to compare our results with previous literature.
23
We have presented a normal range for asymptomatic football players using a single HDD 
24
measure, providing a very useful reference value for clinicians working with football players.
25
26
 Page 12 of 19

12
Age did not influence eccentric ADD and ABD strength scores. A statistically significant 
1
effect was found on the ADD/ABD ratio, but with an effect size that is likely to be clinically 
2
meaningless (-0.005/year). A statistically significant negative effect of age on adductor 
3
squeeze strength score was determined, also with a small slope (-0.03N/kg/year). This 
4
implies that for a 10 year increase in age, the adductor squeeze score can be expected to be 
5
lower by 0.3Nm/kg, or approximately 9% of the mean, a value that is within measurement 
6
error. Therefore, age would only need to be taken into account when comparing normal 
7
squeeze strength in a football population of wide age range.
8
9
Past history of time loss injury had no effect on the strength profiles.  All included 
10
participants were currently asymptomatic for hip or groin pain, indicating that the 71 players 
11
who reported a time loss hip/groin injury from the previous season were likely to have 
12
regained any potential strength loss that may have resulted from the previous injury.  
13
Eccentric ADD, ABD, and ADD/ABD ratio were not different between the various ethnic 
14
groups included in our cohort. Adductor squeeze strength score was also consistent 
15
between ethnicities, once the effect of age was accounted for in the multivariate model.  
16
Therefore clinicians can be confident that these strength values, which are normalized to 
17
body weight (all tests) and limb length (eccentric tests), represent normal profiles of use for 
18
clinical comparison purposes.
19
20
Hip ROM for our cohort was similar to that reported in previous football studies.12,15,24
21
Dominance only affected the ROM for hip IR in both flexion and prone. However, the mean 
22
difference between the dominant and non-dominant leg was only 1° for hip IR in flexion and 
23
2° for hip IR in prone. These differences are well within the measurement error, and
24
therefore unlikely to be of clinical significance, despite statistical significance being reached 
25
due to the large cohort size. While abnormal hip ROM appears not to be a clear risk factor 
26
for hip/groin injury, reduced ROM is found in athletes with current hip/groin pain.25 The
27
detection of musculoskeletal conditions requiring treatment or follow-up is a key aim of 
28
 Page 13 of 19

13
musculoskeletal screening.20 Therefore measurement of hip ROM is still important to include 
1
in musculoskeletal screening in order to potentially detect current hip/groin symptoms and 
2
also relevant for the clinical management of other injuries seen in football players. such as 
3
back pain.26,27 We have provided normal ranges that can be used for clinical comparison 
4
purposes in this athletic population.
5
6
Age had a statistically significant effect on hip ER (slope = -0.29°/year) and ABD range of 
7
motion (slope= -0.19°/year). This means that for a 10 year increase in age, ER can be 
8
expected to decrease by a mean of 3° and ABD by 2°, which is still within the measurement 
9
error. Past history of injury had a small influence on the ROM profiles with BKFO (1.5cm) 
10
and ER (2°) greater in those players that had sustained a time loss injury in the previous 
11
season. However, this effect was no longer significant when age was taken into account in 
12
the multivariate model. These findings are supported by a recent systematic review that 
13
found consistent level 2 evidence that reduced hip ROM is not associated with a greater risk 
14
of developing hip and groin injury.5 Similarly, ethnic differences in ROM were not significant 
15
when age was taken into account in the multivariate model. Accordingly, clinicians are 
16
encouraged to consider age (but not ethnicity, dominance, or past history of injury) when 
17
interpreting ROM findings, though age only requires consideration when comparing ROM in 
18
a football population of wide age range.
19
20
The relatively small numbers of football players in some of the ethnic groups means that 
21
further work is required before we can definitively discount ethnicity as a correlate of the 
22
strength or ROM measures described in this study. Furthermore, our definition of past injury 
23
history combined categories of diagnoses and severity of time-loss injuries that were mostly 
24
confirmed by established injury surveillance methods conducted in the QSL. However, 
25
further delineation of past history by diagnosis and/or severity may reveal greater effects of 
26
this variable on the normal profiles.

Conclusion
1
The normal profiles for hip strength and range of motion determined for our cohort can be 
2
used as references in the clinical assessment, screening, and management of football 
3
players. Leg dominance, past history of injury, and ethnicity had no clinically relevant effect 
4
on these values, so these normal profiles can be used with confidence across cohorts of 
5
professional football players.


These normal values for hip strength and range of motion can be used for 
9
comparison purposes in the clinical assessment, screening, and management of 
10
football players.
11

The diverse age, height, weight and ethnicity of our cohort ensures that these normal 
12
profiles have broad clinical generalisability
