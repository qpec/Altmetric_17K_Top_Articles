Abstract
Background: The clinical utility of serum procalcitonin levels in guiding antibiotic treatment decisions in patients
with sepsis remains unclear. This patient-level meta-analysis based on 11 randomized trials investigates the impact
of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy on mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with infection, both
overall and stratified according to sepsis definition, severity, and type of infection.
Methods: For this meta-analysis focusing on procalcitonin-guided antibiotic management in critically ill patients with
sepsis of any type, in February 2018 we updated the database of a previous individual patient data meta-analysis which
was limited to patients with respiratory infections only. We used individual patient data from 11 trials that randomly
assigned patients to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels (the “procalcitonin-guided” group) or the current
standard of care (the “controls”). The primary endpoint was mortality within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were duration
of antibiotic treatment and length of stay.
Results: Mortality in the 2252 procalcitonin-guided patients was significantly lower compared with the 2230
control group patients (21.1% vs 23.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 0.99;
p = 0.03). These effects on mortality persisted in a subgroup of patients meeting the sepsis 3 definition and
based on the severity of sepsis (assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
score, occurrence of septic shock or renal failure, and need for vasopressor or ventilatory support) and on
the type of infection (respiratory, urinary tract, abdominal, skin, or central nervous system), with interaction
for each analysis being > 0.05. Procalcitonin guidance also facilitated earlier discontinuation of antibiotics,
with a reduction in treatment duration (9.3 vs 10.4 days; adjusted coefficient −1.19 days, 95% CI −1.73 to
−0.66; p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients results in
improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration.
Keywords: Sepsis, Procalcitonin, Antibiotic stewardship, Meta-analysis,
Background
Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction
caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, re-
mains a major healthcare problem worldwide and affects
millions of people each year [1, 2]. Early identification
and appropriate initial management including the start
of antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation improves
outcomes [2, 3]. In addition, monitoring of patients dur-
ing treatment both for timely escalation of therapy in
case of treatment failure and de-escalation in case of a
favorable treatment response has an important impact
on patient recovery. [1, 2] This also includes early
de-escalation or cessation of antibiotic treatment once a
patient’s condition has stabilized, with signs indicating
progression towards the resolution of infection.
Given that clinical signs for monitoring patients with
sepsis can be ambiguous, the use of additional bio-
markers mirroring specific physiopathological pathways
has been proposed. In this context, serum procalcitonin
(PCT) has emerged as a sensitive biomarker that pro-
vides prognostic information in patients with infections,
and thus may improve sepsis management [4, 5]. Mul-
tiple studies have demonstrated that PCT levels increase
in response to bacterial infection and decrease during
recovery [4, 5]. Reflecting the host response to a bacter-
ial infection, PCT thus provides important adjunctive
information in addition to traditional clinical and diag-
nostic parameters [6].
Multiple trials have investigated the benefits of using
serum PCT levels to guide whether and for how long
antibiotic therapy is used—a process referred to as
PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship—in patients with in-
fection in the intensive care unit (ICU) [1, 7–17]. While
most trials have focused on the effects of PCT guidance
on antibiotic usage, a recent large trial from the
Netherlands
reported
lower
mortality
following
PCT-guided therapy [10]. However, conclusive evidence
on the safety of this approach across different types of
infection and sepsis severities has been limited due to
largely insufficient statistical power in most of the indi-
vidual trials. Moreover, meta-analyses focusing on the
impact of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship in sepsis
patients on clinical outcomes overall and within patient
subgroups based on infection type and severity have
been inconclusive [18, 19]. A noteworthy limitation of
these meta-analyses was that they were based on aggre-
gate data, limiting opportunities to harmonize outcome
definitions among trials and to investigate the impact of
PCT guidance in different patient subgroups.
To
address
this
significant
drawback
of
earlier
meta-analyses, we performed a meta-analysis of individ-
ual patient data from 11 randomized-controlled trials
(RCTs) to assess the safety of using PCT to guide anti-
biotic decisions in ICU patients with infection and dif-
ferent sepsis severities and with the involvement of
different organs.
Methods
Definition of patient population and trial selection
For this meta-analysis focusing on PCT-guided antibiotic
management in critically ill patients with sepsis, we
updated the database of a previous individual patient
data meta-analysis which was limited to patients with re-
spiratory infections only [20, 21]. Trial selection and
data collection were performed following the initial
protocol published in the Cochrane Library [22] and the
report was prepared according to PRISMA individual
participant data (IPD) guidelines [23, 24].
For this analysis, we included all patients residing in
an ICU with any type of systemic infection. We thus ex-
cluded patients not treated in the ICU and also one trial
that focused on ventilator-associated pneumonia because
these patients may not have systemic bacterial infections
[25]. Furthermore, pediatric trials and those not using
PCT to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic
treatment were excluded from this analysis.
Given that the definition of sepsis has changed over
time [26], and is used differently among researchers and
clinicians, we decided to focus primarily on trials involv-
ing patients presenting with infections to the critical
care unit. However, we performed a subgroup analysis
on patients meeting the sepsis 3 definition [26]. We also
stratified the analysis based on sepsis severity and type
of organ involved. Individual patient data were collected
from eligible RCTs which assessed adults meeting these
criteria.
Trial search and data collection
The search strategy for this review was updated in Feb-
ruary 2018 in collaboration with personnel from the
Cochrane collaboration and executed in all databases
from the date of their inception to February 2018. All
references were also screened for eligibility. Databases
searched included the Cochrane Central Register of
Wirz et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:191 
Page 2 of 11
 Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; January 2017, issue 1),
MEDLINE Ovid (1966 to February 2017), and Embase.-
com (1980 to February 2017). We applied no language
or publication restrictions.
Two authors (YW and MAM) independently assessed
trial eligibility based on titles, abstracts, and full-text re-
ports, with further information being obtained directly
from investigators as needed. Study protocols, case re-
port forms, and unedited databases containing individual
patient data were requested from investigators of all eli-
gible trials. Data from each trial were first checked
against reported results and queries were resolved with
the principal investigator, trial data manager, or statisti-
cian. Data were assessed in a consistent manner across
all trials, with standard definitions and parameters, and
thus mortality rates differed slightly from previous re-
ports. In accordance with the Cochrane methodology,
we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to as-
sess risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection
bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other types of bias
[27]. The grading was performed by two authors (YW
and MAM) and, in case of conflicting results, grading
was discussed with another author (PS) and within the
meta-analysis group.
Patients and endpoints
All patients with a suspected or proven infection as the
main diagnosis treated in the ICU who were included in
a previous trial and randomized either to PCT-guided
care or a control group were included in the overall ana-
lysis. The primary safety endpoint was all-cause mortal-
ity within 30 days of randomization. For trials with a
shorter follow-up period, the available information was
used (e.g., mortality at the time of hospital discharge).
The main efficacy endpoint was antibiotic treatment
duration. Other clinical endpoints included length of
hospital stay and length of ICU stay.
Statistical analysis
The analysis follows a study protocol similar to a
previous protocol published in the Cochrane Library
[22] but we specified the main analysis and subgroup
analysis for the sepsis patient population. For the pri-
mary endpoint (mortality), odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multi-
variable hierarchical logistic regression [28, 29]. Vari-
ables in the multivariate analysis included treatment
arm, age, gender, and type of infection. To control for
within- and between-trial variability, a “trial” variable
was
added
to
the
model
as
a
random
effect.

 Corresponding linear and logistic regression models were
fitted for continuous and binary secondary endpoints, re-
spectively.
Analyses
followed
the
intention-to-treat
principle by analyzing patients in groups to which they
were randomized. Censoring was used for patients with a
follow-up < 30 days for the time-to-event analyses.
We performed a prespecified subgroup analysis on pa-
tients meeting the sepsis 3 definition, i.e., defining sepsis
as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregu-
lated host response to infection, and, as such, requires at
least one organ dysfunction (i.e., at least one organ with
a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
above or equal to 2 [26]). Additional prespecified sub-
group analyses were performed for sepsis severity (septic
shock), treatment modality in the ICU, and type of organ
infected. We tested for subgroup effects by adding inter-
action terms to the model. All statistical analyses were
performed using Stata version 9.2 (College Station,
Texas, USA) and Review Manager version 5.3.
Results
Results of the search and characteristics of included trials
Data from 4482 individual patients enrolled in 11 of 32
potentially eligible trials were obtained and included in
the meta-analysis (Fig. 1). A total of 21 trials whose pa-
tients did not have sepsis treated in the ICU and which
thus did not meet our inclusion criteria were excluded.
Included trials were conducted in seven countries in-
cluding Switzerland, Germany, France, the Netherlands,
Brazil, Belgium, and Australia (Table 1). There were two

 trials from surgical ICUs with postoperative sepsis pa-
tients, while the remaining nine trials focused on med-
ical or mixed ICU patients with sepsis. All trials focused
on sepsis patients but, as demonstrated in Table 1, defin-
ition of patients varied somewhat. The largest trials were
those by De Jong (n = 1546) [10], Bloos (n = 1089) [8],
and Bouadma (n = 621) [9]. The PCT algorithms used in
the different trials were similar and mainly focused on
early discontinuation of antibiotics if PCT dropped
below 0.5 μg/L or by 80% from the peak level.
The quality of trials according to GRADE criteria was
moderate to high (see Additional file 1). There was a
low risk of selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting
bias. Trials did not blind caregivers and patients with re-
gard to the intervention and only about one-third of the
trials featured blinded outcome assessment. There was
no evidence of publication bias based on inspection of
the funnel plot (see Additional file 1). We also found
variable adherence to the PCT protocols ranging from
44% to 97% (Table 1).
Baseline characteristics of individual patients were
similar between the PCT and control groups. About 50%
of patients had sepsis due to infection of the lung,
followed by abdominal infection (18%) and urinary tract
infection (5%). The mean SOFA score was 7.4 points
and
more
than
two-thirds
of
patients
were
on
vasopressors and/or ventilation support. Table 2 lists
additional baseline characteristics stratified according to
randomization. There were no statistical differences
between the two groups.
Primary safety endpoint: mortality
There were 529 deaths among 2230 control group pa-
tients (23.7%) compared with 475 deaths among 2252
PCT-guided patients (21.1%), resulting in significantly
lower mortality in the PCT group (adjusted OR 0.89,
95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.03) (Fig. 2 and Table 3). This
effect was consistent in patients meeting the sepsis 3
definition, and across different severity groups based on
SOFA score, presence or absence of septic shock,
ventilatory failure, and renal support (p > 0.05 for each
interaction, indicating no significant difference due to
subgroup effect). The effects on mortality were also con-
sistent among different types of infections including re-
spiratory tract, urinary, abdominal, skin/soft tissue, and
central nervous system (CNS) infections (p > 0.05 for
each interaction) (Table 4).
As an additional sensitivity analysis, a meta-analysis of
the aggregate results of all trials was conducted (see
Additional file 1). The point estimate for mortality in
this analysis was similar to that seen in the individual
patient data analysis but did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01). Heterogeneity was
low, suggesting robust effects (I2 = 0%).
As an additional sensitivity analysis, we restricted the
analysis to trials reporting ≥ 28 days mortality, thereby
excluding three trials where this information was not
assessed (Table 1). Again, results were similar to the
main results.
Primary efficacy endpoint: antibiotic use
A moderate reduction in total antibiotic treatment
duration resulted from PCT guidance (mean 10.4 ±
9.7 vs 9.3 ± 9.2 days; adjusted regression coefficient
−1.19
days,

(Table 3). Effects were similar in patients meeting
the sepsis 3 definition. There was some evidence of
effect modification with stronger effects in patients
with lower sepsis severity based on SOFA score
(−2.62 days in patients with SOFA score of 0–6
points vs 0.01 days in patients with SOFA score of
7–9 and −0.63 days in patients with SOFA scores of
10–24 (p for the interaction < 0.05). Similarly, in pa-
tients with abdominal infection, PCT-guided therapy
did not reduce duration of treatment compared with

to 4.24, respectively). In addition, patients with renal
failure (renal support) had longer lengths of hospital
stay while patients with no renal failure had shorter
stays (2.97 days vs −1.41 days).
Discussion
This meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11
randomized trials that included 4482 patients with infec-
tion treated in ICUs revealed lower mortality associated
with PCT-guided therapy, confirming the results of a
large Dutch trial [10]. This effect was consistent in sepsis
patients based on the sepsis 3 definition, and across dif-
ferent severities and types of sepsis based on whether
PCT-guided treatment was employed, and also across
different types of infection. Moreover, PCT guidance was
also associated with a modest reduction in exposure to
antibiotics through shorter treatment durations and earl-
ier discontinuation. However, PCT guidance did not
have an effect on length of ICU or hospital stay.
Early diagnosis combined with initiation of appropriate
antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of sepsis
care [30]. Once treatment is initiated, close monitoring
of patients is of the utmost importance to identify pa-
tients with a favorable disease course who are at low risk
for complications so that one may consider early cessa-
tion of antibiotic therapy. Daily assessment of patient
risk using objective prognostic parameters is therefore
important. In addition to clinical parameters, blood
markers may aid in patient monitoring [31–34]. While
serum lactate is a commonly used biomarker that may
help guide resuscitation measures [35], PCT has been
previously demonstrated to be helpful in assessing the
response
to
antimicrobial
treatment
and
in

 antibiotic stewardship decisions [36–38]. Based on mul-
tiple randomized trials integrated in an aggregate patient
data meta-analysis, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) has recently approved the PCT assay for the
purpose of guiding antibiotic therapy in the context of
sepsis
[18,
39].
However,
since
sepsis
is
not
a
well-defined disease but a heterogenous syndrome aris-
ing from different possible organs being infected and
with different clinical presentations based on severity,
the question of safety and efficacy of PCT guidance in
patients with sepsis overall, and in subgroups based on
severity and organs involved, is relevant. In this context,
our finding that lower mortality and shorter antibiotic
courses
are
associated
with
PCT-guided
care
is
reassuring.
We have recently published a similar individual patient
data meta-analysis looking at patients with different
types and severities of respiratory infections [20, 40].
Similar to what was seen in the current analysis, pa-
tients with respiratory infections also benefited from
PCT-guided therapy, experiencing lower mortality and
needing significantly reduced antibiotic exposure. The
current analysis further expands these findings, also
showing similar effects in subgroups of other types of
infections—an analysis that was not possible in all
previous
meta-analyses
based
on
aggregate
data.
While the effects seem similar between different sub-
groups, we did not find PCT to be associated with
reduced antibiotic use in patients with abdominal in-
fections and those with renal impairment. It is pos-
sible that, in these two patient groups, the PCT
kinetics are impaired by bacterial translocation due to
mucositis even if the initial infection has resolved,
and by the slower decline of PCT in patients with
renal impairment. Additional investigations will be
needed to understand whether PCT algorithms re-
quire further adaptation in these two patient groups.
Although we have no definitive explanations for the
positive effects of PCT-guided antibiotic treatment on
mortality, several mechanisms seem plausible. First,
PCT provides additional prognostic information in
patients with sepsis and may influence site-of-care de-
cisions and timing of discharge [17]. The MOSES
study investigating PCT kinetics over 72 h in several
US emergency departments validated the prognostic
potential of PCT independent of other prognostic
scores [4]. Hence, early identification of treatment
nonresponders has the potential to prevent adverse
events, although this was not true in the PASS trial, a
study investigating whether escalation of diagnostic

 and therapeutic measures based on high PCT levels
would

mortality
[41].
Second,
prolonged
antibiotic exposure has a toxic effect and thus may
increase risk of treatment failure in control patients
[42, 43]. Unexpected PCT results may also prompt
physicians to further examine patients and look for
additional explanations and illnesses. Finally, several
observational studies have reported lower mortality
and risk of treatment failure associated with early
antibiotic de-escalation in patients with sepsis, al-
though
pathophysiological
mechanisms
are
incom-
pletely understood [37, 44].
This analysis is based on a comprehensive literature
search and retrieval of all relevant trials and a net-
work that permitted inclusion of individual patient
data from most eligible trials. We also standardized
definitions across trials and were able to perform ap-
propriate subgroup analyses looking at different sepsis
severities and types of infection. Limitations of this
analysis include incomplete adherence to the PCT al-
gorithm among the included trials, exclusion of im-
munocompromised
patients
in
most
trials,
and
heterogeneity among trials with regard to patient pop-
ulations
and
follow-up
of
patients.
In
addition,
cost-effectiveness analyses need to be undertaken to
determine
whether
using
PCT-guided
care
is
a
cost-effective intervention [45].
Conclusion
In conclusion, PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU
patients with infection results in improved survival and
shorter antibiotic treatment duration. Effects were simi-
lar in sepsis patients and among subgroups based on
sepsis severity, sepsis treatment modalities, and type of
infection. Whether the reduction in antibiotic exposure
fully explains the mortality effects seen in our data needs
