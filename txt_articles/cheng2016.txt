Michelle Y. Cheng, MD; Andrea Sukhov, BA; Hawa Sultani, BS; Kyoungmi Kim, PhD; Emanual Maverakis, MD
IMPORTANCE National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants are becoming increasingly
competitive in the academic research arena. Identifying NIH funding disparities is an
important step in improving academic diversity.
OBJECTIVE To examine recent NIH funding trends in dermatology.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective study with linear regression analysis and
repeated-measures analysis of variance of all NIH grants awarded to departments of
dermatology from fiscal year 2009 to 2014. Funding data were exported from the NIH
Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results. Publication data were
drawn from Scopus. All NIH-funded principal investigators in dermatology were categorized
by their academic degree and sex.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The NIH funding trends were compared by investigator
degree (MD, PhD, or MD/PhD) and sex.
RESULTS A total of 1292 NIH-funded grants were awarded to dermatology research from
fiscal year 2009 through 2014. Adjusted NIH funding for dermatologic research diminished
by 4.6% from $67.3 million in 2009 to $64.2 million in 2014, with a nadir of $58.6 million in
2013. Funding for the NIH’
s Research Project Grant Program (R01) decreased by 21.0% from
$43.9 million to $34.7 million during this period. The dollar amount of NIH funding
significantly trended down for investigators with an MD degree by $1.35 million per year from
$23.6 million in 2009 to $18.4 million in 2014 (P = .02) while there was no significant change
in NIH funding for MD/PhD (from $17.6 million in 2009 to $19.8 million in 2014; P = .44) and
PhD investigators (from $26.1 million in 2009 to $25.9 million in 2014; P = .74). Similarly, the
total dollar amount of R01 grants awarded to principal investigators with only an MD degree
trended down by $1.4 million per year from $13.2 million in 2009 to $6.0 million in 2014
(P < .001). The number of female investigators with NIH grants in dermatology trended down
significantly compared with the trend of their male counterparts (from 49 women in 2009 to
43 women in 2014 vs from 84 men in 2009 to 97 men in 2014; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There is a downward trend in NIH funding for female and
MD-only dermatology investigators. Departmental support and junior faculty mentorship for
women and MD investigators is crucial for maintaining their presence in NIH-funded
dermatology research.

M
edical research relies on continuous funding sup-
port. Although there are many sources of funding,
NationalInstitutesofHealth(NIH)awardsremainthe
benchmark. The NIH provides nearly $30 billion annually for
medical research,1 making it the largest public funding source.
However, despite an increase in research costs and grant
applications,2 the total NIH budget in adjusted dollars has
steadily decreased since 2003, a major concern to academic
dermatologists who rely on the NIH for research support.
Given the increasingly competitive landscape for NIH dol-
lars, we hypothesized that certain groups of dermatology re-
searchers would be subjected to additional challenges in se-
curing NIH awards. The goal was to assess NIH funding trends
by investigators grouped by academic degree (MD vs PhD vs
MD/PhD). The NIH’
s Research Project Grant Program (R01) was
highlighted in a subanalysis because the R01 is the original and
most well-known NIH grant mechanism.
In addition, we were interested in the effect of sex on
obtaining NIH grant awards. Historically, women are signifi-
cantly less funded than their male counterparts.3,4 Also,
women hold less prestigious positions in academia despite
their known proficiency in academic leadership positions.5,6
Therefore, we also sought to examine how sex and seniority
affect NIH funding.
Methods
Data Acquisition
Funding data were sourced from the NIH Research Portfolio
Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results (NIH
RePORTER).1 We exported data on grants awarded to derma-
tology research from fiscal years (FY) 2009 to 2014. These
grants were queried through the “Fiscal Year,
” “Activity Code,
”
and “Department” search options on NIH RePORTER. Fund-
ingfromnon-NIHsourceswasexcluded,suchasfromtheFood
and Drug Administration and Department of Veteran Affairs.
All project leaders, also known as principal investigators
(PIs),werecollectedandtheiracademicdegreesandsexeswere
determined through an Internet search of academic institu-
tion websites and faculty directories. Sex categorization re-
quired photographic evidence or identification through insti-
tutional biographies. Degrees that were still in progress at the
time of the award were not counted. All PIs were categorized
successfully through this method. Because the NIH
RePORTER organizes grants by their single project leader,
grantswithmultiplePIswerecategorizedtotheirprojectleader
for consistency. All data were extracted in August 2015, and
costs were adjusted to 2009 equivalent dollars using the
Consumer Price Index.
Data regarding the PI’
s publication history were com-
piled using Scopus (http://www.scopus.com). Principal
investigators were searched using the author’
s first and last
name, and/or through their university affiliation. The seniority
of an investigator was measured by the number of years since
first publication. Because this study did not involve human
participants, institutional review board approval was not
required.
Statistical Analysis
StatisticalanalysiswasperformedusingSASstatisticalsoftware,
version9.4(SASInstitute).Theunderlyingassumptionsofnor-
malityandhomoscedasticityofstatisticalinferentialtestswere
checked prior to statistical analysis. Linear regression analyses
wereusedtoassesstherelationshipbetween2variables,andthe
goodnessoffit(R2)wasdeterminedforeachlinearmodel.Analy-
sisofcovariancewasusedtocompareslopesofregressionlines.
For multiple pairwise group comparisons, P< .017 was consid-
ered to determine significance when comparing a pair from 3
groups based on the Bonferroni method. For all other analyses,
P<.05 was considered significant.
Longitudinal trends of 6-year change in funding were esti-
matedbyarepeated-measuresanalysisofvariance(ANOVA)via
linear random-effects models. Funding amount was entered as

as random effects.
Results
Funding to Dermatology Departments
There were a total of 1292 NIH-funded grants awarded to der-
matology research from FY 2009 through 2014. Adjusted NIH
funding for dermatologic research diminished by 4.6% from
$67.3 million in 2009 to $64.2 million in 2014, with a nadir of
$58.6 million in 2013. Comparatively, funding for R01 awards
in dermatology underwent a larger decrease of 21.0% from
$43.9 million to $34.7 million during the same period (Table 1).
Funding to Investigators by Degrees
The total amount of dermatology NIH grants awarded to PIs
with MD degrees trended down significantly by $1.35 million
per year (P = .02). Comparatively, funding has trended up by
$0.25 million per year (P = .44) for PIs with MD/PhD degrees
and trended down by $0.23 million (P = .74) for non-MD PIs
with PhD degrees (Figure 1A). Repeated-measures ANOVA re-
vealed that these trend lines were statistically different from
one another (P = .016) (Table 2). Pairwise comparisons be-
tween the following groups: MD vs PhD, MD vs MD/PhD, and
Key Points
Question What are the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding
trends in dermatology research from fiscal year 2009 to 2014?
Findings In this analysis of NIH-funded principal investigators,
only one-third were women, and the number of women funded
decreased significantly over the study period. Compared with
those with a PhD, the amount of funding awarded to investigators
with an MD degree also decreased significantly, by more than
$1 million per year.
Meaning If the current trends continue, NIH funding disparities in
dermatology will likely worsen.

PhD vs MD/PhD revealed that there was a significant differ-
ence between MD and PhD dermatology investigators
(P = .008). The significance of this comparison remained true
after adjustment for publications (P = .001) and seniority
(P = .013) (Table 2).
R01 Funding to Investigators by Degree
Subanalysis of these data revealed that the dollar amount of
R01 grants awarded to PIs with only an MD degree trended sig-
nificantly down almost linearly by $1.4 million per year
(P < .001). Meanwhile, MD/PhD and PhD R01 funding trended
down by $0.34 million per year (P = .25) and up by $0.20 mil-
lion per year (P = .53), respectively (Figure 1B). Also, the slope
of the trend line for R01 MD funding is significantly more
negative than the slopes of the trend lines for R01 MD/PhD
funding and total PhD funding (P = .001).
Sex Differences in the Number of NIH-Funded Investigators
Between 2009 and 2014, the majority of NIH-funded investi-
gators in dermatology were men and the number of male PIs
trendedupbyapproximately1.5PIsperyear(P = .21)(Figure2).
The number of female PIs was 49 in FY 2009 and trended sig-
nificantly down by approximately 1 PI per year (P = .04). The
difference between these 2 trends was statistically signifi-
cant (P = .04) (Figure 2A).
Sex Differences in Investigators Who Retained Funding
To further examine the gender gap, we focused on the inves-
tigators who retained funding throughout our study time-
line. Of these investigators, the funding awarded to men was
statistically greater than the funding awarded to women
(P = .02). However, after adjustment for publications and se-
niority, the funding gap between the sexes was no longer sig-
nificant (P = .08 and P = .16, respectively), suggesting that se-
niority and publications play an important role in award size.
Sex Differences in R01 Funding
There was no significant trend in the number of male and
femalePIswithR01sfromFY2009to2014(P = .78andP = .90,
respectively) (Figure 2B).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that total adjusted NIH funding for
dermatology research from 2009 to 2014 decreased, with
awards to PIs with only an MD degree decreasing by more than
$1 million per year. In addition, the decreasing trend in the

number of NIH-funded women in dermatology was statisti-
cally different than the increasing trend seen in their male
counterparts. Although the funding awarded to men was sta-
tistically greater than the funding awarded to women, this gap
disappears when adjusted for publications and seniority. This
suggeststhatseniorityandpublicationtrackrecordtrumpssex
disparity.
There are many possible explanations for the MD investi-
gators’fundingdecline.First,theNIH’
speerreviewsystemmay
be favoring basic science over translational research. This
would be consistent with the study of Ginther et al,7 which
demonstrated that R01 grants involving the study of human
subjects were significantly less likely to be approved. An-
otherpossibilityisthatMDinvestigators,whooftendividetheir
time between clinic, teaching, mentoring, and research re-
sponsibilities, are at an inherent disadvantage compared with
their PhD counterparts, who focus primarily on research. Even
after controlling for seniority and productivity, MD investiga-
torfundingisdecreasingcomparedwithPhDinvestigatorfund-
ing, suggesting that these are not major factors responsible for
the decline. Another possibility is that dermatology physician-
scientists may be choosing to obtain their funding from non-
NIH sources. For example, competition for NIH dollars may be
shifting clinical research funding away from government
sources and toward industry-sponsored investigations. In sup-
port of this possibility, Ehrhardt et al8 have demonstrated that
NIH-funded clinical trials decreased from 2006 to 2014,
whereas industry-funded trials increased.
In regards to funding differences by sex, the majority of
NIH-fundeddermatologyinvestigatorsweremen.FromFY2009
to 2014, the downward trend in NIH-funded women in derma-
tology was statistically different than the upward trend seen in
the their male counterparts. Similar to our findings, the RAND
Corporation identified that women were underrepresented
amongthetopNIHawardwinners.9Additionally,femalescien-
tists were found to be less likely to progress to R01 grants com-
paredwithmalescientists,suggestingaleakageoffemaleinves-

One limitation of this study is regarding the data source.
Although all funding data were exported directly from NIH
RePORTER, information about seniority and publication rates
were compounded from Scopus, which may lead to inaccura-
cies.Also,withoutaccesstoNIHgrantapplicationsuccessrates,
our study cannot fully assess whether the cause of these fund-
ing differences was related to NIH review and award policies.
Last, we limited our timeline to dermatology grants awarded
from FY 2009 to 2014. Therefore, longer studies are needed
to fully assess these disparities.
Conclusions
Although further research is needed to better elucidate the
funding disparities reported herein, our results demonstrate
that there is a growing inequality of opportunity for women
and MD physician-scientists in dermatology research. Pro-
moting equality in the new generation of physician scientists
requires a multifaceted approach. Thus, a concerted effort
using evidence-based practices for achieving equal opportu-
nity in dermatology departments is imperative for female and
MD physician-scientists to improve their future presence in
NIH-funded dermatology research. Otherwise, if the current
trends continue, the gender and degree gap in dermatology
funding will likely increase.
