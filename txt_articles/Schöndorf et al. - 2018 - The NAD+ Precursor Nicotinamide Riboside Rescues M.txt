SUMMARY
While mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as key in
Parkinson’s disease (PD), a central question remains
whether mitochondria are actual disease drivers and
whether boosting mitochondrial biogenesis and func-
tion ameliorates pathology. We address these ques-
tions
using
patient-derived
induced
pluripotent
stem cells and Drosophila models of GBA-related
PD (GBA-PD), the most common PD genetic risk. Pa-
tient neurons display stress responses, mitochondrial
demise, and changes in NAD+ metabolism. NAD+
precursors have been proposed to ameliorate age-
related metabolic decline and disease. We report
that increasing NAD+ via the NAD+ precursor nicotin-
amide riboside (NR) significantly ameliorates mito-
chondrial
function
in
patient
neurons.
Human
neurons require nicotinamide phosphoribosyltrans-
ferase (NAMPT) to maintain the NAD+ pool and utilize
NRK1 to synthesize NAD+ from NAD+ precursors.
Remarkably, NR prevents the age-related dopami-
nergic neuronal loss and motor decline in fly models
of GBA-PD. Our findings suggest NR as a viable clin-
ical avenue for neuroprotection in PD and other
neurodegenerative diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a key mecha-
nism in many neurodegenerative diseases. Among others, Par-
kinson’s disease (PD) stands out due to the role of PD-linked
genes in mitochondrial function and dynamics (Exner et al.,
2012). Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in PD was first
described in the 1980s by Schapira et al., who showed
complex I (CI) defects in cells and tissues from PD patients
(Schapira et al., 1989). Substantial progress has been made
since, and genetic and biochemical studies now indicate that
mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular energy failure are key to
PD (Jansen et al., 2017). In this respect, recent studies have
shown that the activation of pathways related to mitochondrial
biogenesis and energy metabolism, such as the NAD+/sirtuin 1
(SIRT1) pathway, provides protection against aging-related dis-
ease (Rajman et al., 2018). Similar approaches could be easily
translated into treatment for PD. However, it is still unclear
whether mitochondrial defects are actual disease drivers and
increasing mitochondrial biogenesis provides neuroprotection
in PD. In addition, little is known about NAD+ metabolism and
availability of NAD+ precursors in human neurons. Here, we
have addressed these fundamental questions in an induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neuronal model of PD bearing muta-
tions in the lysosomal enzyme b-Glucocerebrosidase (GBA)
gene (GBA-PD), the most common genetic risk for PD (Sidransky
et al., 2009). b-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity is reduced
not only in mutation carriers but also in idiopathic PD and healthy
individuals at older age (Gegg et al., 2012; Rocha et al., 2015),
pointing toward a general role for GCase in brain aging and
neurodegenerative processes. Importantly, patients with GBA
mutations represent an etiologically homogeneous subgroup of
PD, therefore providing the ideal cohort for precision medicine
approaches.
The pathogenetic mechanisms involved in GBA-PD are
only partially understood and include autophagic defects,
increased a-synuclein aggregation, calcium dyshomeostasis,

 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Migdalska-Richards and
Schapira, 2016). GCase is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the
hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a membrane glyco-
sphingolipid, to ceramide and glucose, and both loss and gain
of its enzymatic function may contribute to disease. According
to the loss-of-function hypothesis, GCase deficiency causes
substrate accumulation that alters lysosomal function and pro-
motes a-synuclein aggregation (Jo et al., 2000; Velayati et al.,
2010; Mazzulli et al., 2011). GCase is glycosylated and folded
in the ER and subsequently trafficked through the Golgi to the
lysosome. According to the gain-of-function hypothesis, GBA
mutations interfere with the folding process in the ER, leading
to ER-associated degradation, ER stress, and activation of the
unfolded protein response (UPR) (Maor et al., 2013; Fernandes
et al., 2016). Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been
described in experimental models of GCase deficiency (Osel-
lame et al., 2013; Keatinge et al., 2015; Cleeter et al., 2013). How-
ever, whether mitochondrial function is altered in PD patients
with GBA mutations (GBA-PD) and the mechanisms underlying
such demise are still unknown. Furthermore, whether improving
mitochondrial biogenesis and function represents an effective
therapeutic strategy for PD needs to be investigated.
RESULTS
iPSC-Derived Neurons from GBA-PD Patients Show
Defects in Mitochondrial Function
To investigate whether GBA is linked to mitochondrial function in
human neurons, iPSC lines from PD patients with heterozygous
GBA mutations (N370S, L444P, and RecNcil), as well as corre-
sponding isogenic gene-corrected (GC) and unaffected controls
(Scho
¨ ndorf et al., 2014) (Table S1), were differentiated into dopa-
minergic (DA) neurons, and mitochondrial morphology was
examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Morpho-
metric analysis revealed altered cristae morphology in GBA-PD
neurons compared to isogenic GC and healthy controls (Figures
1A, 1B, and S1A). In addition, GBA-PD neurons showed a signif-
icant increase in mitochondrial diameter (Figure 1C). Next, we
measured oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and found that
GBA-PD neurons displayed significantly reduced basal respira-
tion and decreased maximal OCR as well as ATP-linked OCR
and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) compared to isogenic con-
trols (Figures 1D and 1E). Similarly, basal respiration, maximal
OCR, and ATP-linked OCR and SRC were significantly reduced
in GBA-PD neurons compared to unrelated unaffected controls
(Figure S1B). Western blot analysis revealed an increase in the
level of respiratory chain complex subunits in GBA-PD neurons
compared to isogenic controls, but this increase did not
reach statistical significance (Figures S1C and S1D). We next
measured CI activity in enriched mitochondrial fractions from
GBA-PD iPSC neurons and GC controls. CI activity was signifi-
cantly reduced in GBA-PD neurons compared to isogenic
controls (Figure 1F). Consistent with these findings, GBA-PD
neurons produced significantly higher amounts of mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (mtROS) than isogenic controls (Fig-
ure 1G). However, mitochondrial membrane potential and mito-
chondrial mass were not significantly changed in GBA-PD
neurons (Figures 1H and 1I). Of note, no significant difference
in the degree of mitochondrial function was observed among
different GBA genotypes, suggesting that the genotypes exam-
ined in this study (RecNcil, L444P, and N370S) equally affect
mitochondria (Figures S1E–S1I). To get further insight into the
mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in GBA-PD,
we examined the GCase substrate sphingolipid composition of
mitochondria from GBA-PD neurons and isogenic controls by
high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spec-
trometry (HPLC-MS/MS). To this end, mitochondria were iso-
lated from iPSC neurons with a high degree of purity. Western
blot analysis showed high level of enrichment of isolated mito-
chondria with a small amount of non-mitochondrial organelle
contamination (Figure S1J). Quantification of individual species
of GlcCer revealed the absence of GlcCer accumulation in pa-
tient mitochondria with only a significant increase of C16-GlcCer
(Figure 1J).

Next, we examined the level of mitochondrial fission (DRP1 and
Fis1) and fusion (OPA1 and Mfn1) proteins in GBA-PD iPSC neu-
rons and isogenic controls. Immunoblot analysis revealed a

 reduction in DRP1, OPA1, and Mfn1 levels in GBA-PD neurons
(Figures 2A–2D). On the other hand, there was an increase of
Fis1 in GBA-PD neurons (Figures 2A and 2B). However, these
differences did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly,
the ratio between the long and short form of OPA1 was signifi-
cantly increased in GBA-PD neurons compared to isogenic con-
trols, suggesting an impairment of mitophagy (MacVicar and
Lane, 2014) (Figures 2C and 2D). GBA-PD neurons showed a
significant reduction of mitochondrial-lysosomal co-localization
compared to GC controls, as assessed by confocal microscopy
and Amnis ImageStream flow cytometry (Figures 2E, 2F, S2A,
and S2B). In line with these findings, the expression of the mi-
tophagy adaptor protein BNIP3L/NIX was significantly reduced
in GBA-PD compared to isogenic controls (Figure 2G).
Mitochondrial Function Is Altered in GBA Knockout
iPSC-Derived Neurons
To assess the impact of loss of GCase enzymatic function on
mitochondria in the absence of gain-of-function mechanisms,
we generated GBA knockout (KO) iPSCs using clustered regu-
larly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 (Fig-
ures S3A–S3F). GBA was knocked out in two healthy control
iPSC lines and one GBA-PD N370S iPSC line (Table S2). All
GBA KO clones showed complete loss of GCase protein and
its enzymatic activity (Figures S3E and S3F). No significant differ-
ence in DA neuronal differentiation potential was observed
among GBA KO iPSCs and corresponding parental lines as as-
sessed by quantification of bIII-tubulin- and tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH)-positive neurons (>80% neurons, of which on average 40%
of cells in both controls and GBA KO lines expressed TH). GBA
KO iPSC-derived neurons exhibited accumulation of the GCase
substrates GlcCer and glucosylsphingosine as revealed by
HPLC-MS/MS (Figures S3G). A significant increase of C16-gal-
actosylceramide was also observed (Figure S3I). No significant
change in levels of other sphingolipids was detected (Figures
S3H and S3I). Two GBA KO clones were selected from each
parental iPSC line and used for further experiments (Table S2).
As observed in GBA-PD neurons, morphometric analysis re-
vealed ultrastructural abnormalities in GBA KO iPSC-neurons
compared to isogenic controls (Figures 3A and 3B). Similar to
what we observed in GBA-PD neurons, GBA KO neurons
showed significantly reduced basal and maximal respiration as
well as ATP-linked OCR and SRC (Figure 3C). Despite the
consistent trend for decreased CI activity in GBA KO neurons,
the values did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3D).

HPLC-MS/MS analysis of mitochondria purified from GBA KO
iPSC-derived neurons showed a significant accumulation of all
subtypes of the GCase substrates GlcCer and glucosylsphingo-
sine (Figure 3G).
GBA-PD, but Not GBA Knockout, iPSC-Derived Neurons
Show Increased ER Stress and UPR
Interestingly, when comparing OCRs and CI activity in the
isogenic lines (GBA-PD N370S, GC control and GBA KO), no
gene dosage effect was found (Figures S3J and S3K). These
data suggest that different mechanisms contribute to mitochon-
drial defects in heterozygous GBA-PD patient and GBA KO neu-
rons. One of such mechanisms could be the UPR and ER stress
that have been previously observed in GBA-PD (Fernandes et al.,
2016). To dissect the contribution of gain- and loss-of-function of
mutant GCase, we measured the levels of the ER chaperone
immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) by western blot in GBA-
PD N370S iPSC-derived neurons as well as isogenic controls
and isogenic GBA KO neurons. Levels of BiP were increased in
GBA-PD neurons compared to isogenic controls and isogenic
GBA KO neurons (Figure 4A). Consistent with these findings,
RNA levels of spliced X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1s) were
significantly increased in GBA-PD, but not in isogenic GBA KO
neurons, suggesting activation of the IRE1 related branch of
ER stress (Figure 4B). Healthy control-derived GBA KO neurons
showed levels of BiP similar to their isogenic controls (Fig-
ure S3L). In addition, levels of phospho-eIF2a were significantly
increased in GBA-PD, but not in isogenic GBA KO neurons, as
compared to GC controls (Figure 4C). Consistent with these find-
ings, levels of phospho-PERK were increased only in GBA-PD
neurons as compared to GC controls (Figure 4D).
NAD+ Metabolism Is Altered in GBA-PD iPSC-Derived
Neurons
Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress are
hallmarks of aging and have been linked to the decline of intra-
cellular levels of NAD+ (Mouchiroud et al., 2013). To examine
whether GBA mutations lead to changes in NAD+ metabolism,
we measured the expression of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes
nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs).
mRNA levels of NMNAT2 were significantly decreased in GBA-
PD neurons compared to isogenic controls, whereas levels of
NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 were unchanged (Figure 5A). NMNAT2
levels were unchanged in GBA KO neurons (Figure S3M). Levels
of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-
limiting enzyme in the NAD+ salvage synthesis pathway, were
similar in both groups (GBA-PD and GC controls), as assessed
by qRT-PCR (Figure 5A). Next, we measured the adenine and
pyridine nucleotide pool in GBA-PD and isogenic control as
well as GBA KO iPSC-neurons by targeted metabolomics using
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The intra-
cellular NAD+ content was maintained in GBA-PD and GBA
KO neurons (Figure S4). To exclude that the observed absence
of significant changes of NAD+ levels could be linked to the
absence of overt neurodegeneration in our stem cell-based
model system, we also examined the NAD+ metabolome in adult
gba+/+, gba�/�, and gba+/� whole zebrafish brains. Adult gba�/�

 zebrafish recapitulate the key pathological aspects of PD,
including DA neuronal loss, early microglial activation, and mito-
chondrial dysfunction (Keatinge et al., 2015). Metabolomic ana-
lyses revealed that the NAD+ pool was maintained in brains of
adult gba+/� and gba�/� zebrafish (Figure S5). However, a signif-
icant increase in nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) was
observed in gba�/� compared to gba+/+ zebrafish brains as
well as in gba�/� compared to gba+/- brains (Figure S5), suggest-
ing an alteration of NAD+ metabolism. To rule out the possibility
that the heterogeneity of the cell culture and whole brain tissues
influences the results, we then employed the biosensor Peredox
to monitor the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio in single iPSC-derived
neurons with live-cell imaging (Hung et al., 2011). The NAD+/
NADH redox state was significantly reduced in GBA-PD iPSC

The NAD+ Precursor Nicotinamide
Riboside Rescues Mitochondrial
Defects in GBA-PD iPSC-Derived
Neurons
Next, we tested the ability of different
NAD+
precursors
to
increase
NAD+
levels in human iPSC-derived neurons.
Control
iPSC-derived
neurons
were
treated with nicotinamide (NAM), NMN,
or nicotinamide riboside (NR), and NAD+
levels were measured using a NAD+
cycling assay. NR and NMN showed the
strongest effect in boosting NAD+ levels
(Figure S6A). As NR represents a prom-
ising approach, as shown by pharmacokinetic studies in healthy
subjects (Trammell et al., 2016), we investigated the ability of NR
to rescue GBA-linked mitochondrial defects. NR significantly
increased NAD+ and NADH levels in GBA-PD neurons (Figures
S6B and S6C). NR treatment resulted in an increase in expres-
sion of markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM) and mito-
chondrial UPR (mtUPR) (HSP60) (Figure 5C). Consistent with
these findings, mitochondrial DNA content and mitochondrial
mass were increased after 48 hr in NR-treated samples (Figures
5D and 5E). The effect of NR was abrogated by EX527, a SIRT1-
specific inhibitor, suggesting that SIRT1 is one of the mediators
of NR function (Figure S6D). Importantly, NR restored mitochon-
drial cristae morphology and significantly reduced mtROS pro-
duction in GBA-PD neurons (Figures 5F–5H). In parallel, NR

 treatment significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane po-
tential (Figure 5I). Similar results were observed when GBA KO
neurons were treated with NR (Figures S6E–S6G). With regard
to the observed defects in mitochondrial dynamics, NR altered
the levels of mitochondrial shaping proteins, with a nonsignifi-
cant increase in DRP1, Mfn1, and OPA1 and a slight decrease
in Fis1 (Figures 5J and 5K). The decreased levels of mitochon-
drial DNA content observed at 24 hr after NR treatment would
suggest an increased mitochondrial clearance (Figure 5D). In
line with these findings, NR was able to increase the levels of
BNIP3L/NIX in GBA-PD neurons (Figure 5L). NR did not enhance
mitochondrial respiration (Figures S6H and S6I). On the contrary,
a significant decrease in basal respiration was observed in GBA-
PD iPSC-derived neurons treated with NR (Figure S6H). In addi-
tion, NR treatment did not alter protein levels of BiP in GBA-PD
neurons (Figure S6J). To confirm that increased NAD+ levels
are responsible for the phenotypic rescue, we treated cells
with the poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor PJ34
that, differently from NAD+ precursors, increases NAD+ levels
by inhibiting its consumption. Similar to NR, PJ34 significantly
increased NAD+ levels in human-iPSC-derived neurons and
rescued mitochondrial defects in GBA-PD neurons (Figures
S7A–S7E). Taken together, these results suggest that increasing
NAD+ levels rescues mitochondrial dysfunction via increased
levels of NAD+ in patient-derived GBA-PD and GBA KO neurons.
Increasing NAD+ Improves Autophagy in GBA-PD and
GBA KO Neurons
GBA mutations affect autophagy and lysosomal function, lead-
ing to autophagic block, defects in autophagosome clearance,
and altered lysosomal recycling (Scho
¨ ndorf et al., 2014; Magal-
haes et al., 2016). To examine the effects of NR on autophagy,
we treated GBA-PD and GBA KO neurons with NR and assessed
parameters of autophagic function. NR treatment did not alter
the levels of LC3II at basal conditions; however, it significantly
increased LC3II levels in patient neurons treated with leupeptin
and ammonium chloride, suggesting an increase of synthesis
and clearance of autophagosomes (Figures S7F–S7I). The auto-
phagic flux was significantly increased in GBA KO neurons and
showed a nonsignificant increase in GBA-PD neurons after NR
treatment (Figures S7F–S7I).
NR Metabolism and NAD+ Availability in Human iPSC-
Derived Neurons
To examine pathways of NAD+ maintenance and NAD+ precur-
sors utilization, control iPSC-derived neurons were treated with
the NAMPT inhibitor FK866, and NAD+ levels were measured.
FK866 treatment decreased intracellular NAD+ levels by more
than 90% (Figure 6A). However, FK866 treatment did not alter
the sensitivity of human neurons to NR treatment (Figure 6A),
indicating that NR is metabolized into NAD+ in a NAMPT-inde-
pendent pathway. We next measured the expression levels of
the NAD+ biosynthesis enzymes NR kinase 1 and 2 (NRK1 and
NRK2) (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004). In undifferentiated
iPSCs, NRK2 showed higher expression levels; on the contrary,
levels of NRK1 were significantly higher in iPSC-derived neurons
(Figure 6B). The role of NRKs in NAD+ metabolism in human
neurons is still unknown. Given its high expression, we aimed
to investigate whether NRK1 is essential for NR metabolism
into NAD+ in human neurons. Of note, mRNA levels of NRK1
were not affected by NR treatment (Figure 6C). Next, we
knocked down NRK1 in control iPSC-derived neurons using

 lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Figures 6D and
6E). NRK1 knockdown did not affect basal levels of NAD+ in neu-
rons, as assessed by a NAD+ cycling assay, whereas NR treat-
ment was unable to significantly increase NAD+ levels in NRK1
knockdown neurons (Figure 6F). These data suggest that
NRK1 is essential for exogenous NR metabolism in human neu-
rons. To further examine the metabolism of exogenous NR, we
treated control and GBA-PD iPSC neurons with 0.5 mM NR
and performed LC-MS-based targeted quantitative metabolo-
mics (Figures 6G and S7J). NR treatment significantly increased
the levels of NAD+ in control and patient cells. In addition, we
found a significant increase of NAM in both groups. On the other

 hand, levels of NMN, the immediate downstream product of NR,
tended to be higher in NR-treated cells, but this difference was
not statistically significant (Figure 6G).
NR Rescues Motor Deficits in a Drosophila Model of
GBA-PD
To assess the neuroprotective effect of NAD+ precursors in vivo,
we employed a Drosophila model of GBA-PD. Flies expressing
human N370S GBA show increased ER stress, an age-depen-
dent loss of DA neurons accompanied by progressive defects
in climbing activity (Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2016). To explore
neuroprotection, flies expressing wild-type (WT) or N370S GBA
were first raised on normal food, and then adult flies were
aged on food containing NR (500 mM). At 30 days, expression
of N370S GBA caused loss of DA neurons in the protocerebral
posterial lateral 1 (PPL1) cluster. Strikingly, feeding NR signifi-
cantly prevented DA neuronal loss compared to untreated
controls (Figures 7A and 7B). Importantly, NR treatment also
significantly prevented the decline in climbing ability in mutant
N370S GBA flies (Figure 7C).
DISCUSSION
Mounting evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction
plays a key role in PD. Here, we report that neurons from GBA-

PD patients and GBA KO neurons exhibit
mitochondrial
dysfunction
characterized
by morphological changes, reduced respi-
ration, and increased oxidative stress. As
mitochondrial membrane lipid composition
regulates many of these functions (Aufsch-
naiter et al., 2017) and changes in lipid
metabolism have been observed in GBA-
PD (Scho
¨ ndorf et al., 2014; Fernandes
et al., 2016; Garcı
´a-Sanz et al., 2017), we
examined the mitochondrial sphingolipid
profile of GBA-PD and GBA KO neurons.
Lipidomic analysis revealed the absence of a significant accu-
mulation of sphingolipids in patient mitochondria. However, we
observed a significant increase of C16-GlcCer. On the contrary,
the mitochondrial sphingolipid profile of GBA KO neurons was
profoundly altered, with significant accumulation of GlcCer and
glucosylsphingosine. Given the role of sphingolipids in the regu-
lation of mitochondrial properties, substrate accumulation or
even subtle changes in lipid composition of mitochondrial mem-
branes, as observed in patient mitochondria, may interfere with
their biophysical properties and signaling pathways. However,
we are not able to unambiguously define the exact subcellular
localization of these alterations. Even though we have isolated
mitochondria to the highest degree of purity, a small amount of
contamination with lysosomes and ER was still present. The
low degree of non-mitochondrial proteins and the complete
absence of additional lysosomal markers (other than LAMP1)
suggest the residual presence of organelle contact sites in mito-
chondrial preparations. Given the importance of contact sites in
interorganelle communication (Wong et al., 2018), further studies
are needed to investigate the role of distinct sphingolipids in
such
inter-organelle
communication
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction.
Overall, we did not observe a gene dosage effect when
comparing mitochondrial function in heterozygous GBA-PD
with GBA KO neurons. Thus, distinctly different mechanisms
Cell Reports 23, 2976–2988, June 5, 2018
2985
 likely contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in these models.
One such mechanism could be the alteration of mitochondria
sphingolipid composition, which we observed in GBA KO, but
not GBA-PD, cells. Interestingly, in other lysosomal storage dis-
eases, the loss of lysosomal enzymatic function leads to sub-
strate accumulation at the ER membranes and subsequent
activation of the UPR (Tessitore et al., 2004). However, despite
significant substrate accumulation in our model, the complete
loss of GCase enzymatic function in GBA KO neurons is not
sufficient to trigger ER stress responses that were instead
observed in heterozygous GBA-PD neurons. This points toward
a key role of gain-of-function mechanisms in ER stress re-
sponses in GBA-PD. On the other hand, GCase deficiency
results in sphingolipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion including increased mtROS.
GBA-PD neurons showed an imbalance of mitochondrial
shaping proteins DRP1, OPA1, Mfn1, and Fis1 and an increased
ratio of L-OPA1/S-OPA1. As L-OPA1 processing and impaired
DRP1 activity contribute to the dysfunction of mitophagy
(MacVicar and Lane, 2014), our results would suggest an impair-
ment of mitochondrial clearance in GBA-PD. This was further
supported by the reduced mitochondria-lysosome colocalization
and reduced expression of the mitophagy adaptor NIX/BNIP3L.
Unexpectedly, we did not observe a significant increase of mito-
chondrial content in patient neurons. The mitochondrial mem-
brane potential was also preserved in GBA-PD neurons. As
BNIP3L/NIX plays a role in the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (Sandoval et al., 2008), reduced levels of BNIP3L in
GBA-PD neurons could explain the lack of decreased mitochon-
drial membrane potential. Taken together, our data suggest an
imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics in GBA-PD neurons that
leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of accumula-
tion of damaged mitochondria. As mitophagy occurs locally in
distal neuronal axons, we cannot exclude accumulation of
dysfunctional mitochondria within axons (Ashrafi et al., 2014).
Increasing intracellular NAD+ concentrations has been shown
to be protective against age-related metabolic decline and dis-
ease (Rajman et al., 2018; Katsyuba and Auwerx, 2017). NAD+
is a coenzyme for several enzymes, including SIRT1, which reg-
ulates mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and cellular stress
responses (Chang and Guarente, 2014; Prola et al., 2017).
Several mechanisms lead to NAD+ consumption, including
oxidative stress. To examine whether NAD+ decline is involved
in GBA-PD, we have first used targeted metabolomics and found
that NAD+ levels were maintained in both GBA-PD and GBA KO
iPSC-derived neurons, as well as whole brains from gba�/� ze-
brafish. As cellular energy metabolism and the cytosolic
NADH/NAD+ redox state differ in various tissues or different cells
within the same tissue, we have employed a genetically encoded
NADH/NAD+ biosensor for live-cell imaging in iPSC-derived
neurons. GBA-PD neurons showed a significant reduction of
the NAD+/NADH redox state. The reduction of NMNAT2 in
GBA-PD neurons further supports an alteration of NAD+ meta-
bolism in GBA-PD. Besides its role in NAD+ synthesis, NMNAT2
also acts as a chaperone to reduce proteotoxic stress and its
levels decline prior to the onset of neurodegeneration (Ali et al.,
2016). Thus, the reduction of NMNAT2 in GBA-PD neurons could
also explain the increased proteotoxic stress observed in these
cells. The zebrafish metabolomics data further support an alter-
ation of NAD+ metabolism. GBA deficiency led to a significant in-
crease in NMN in zebrafish brains. This strongly suggests
reduced NMNAT activity in the zebrafish brain when lacking
GBA. We were unable to reliably detect NMN at basal conditions
in iPSC-derived neurons, as NMN is a low abundance metabolite
in cellular extracts. In conclusion, even though we cannot yet
conclude definitively that NAD+ decline occurs in GBA-PD, our
data suggest alterations of NAD+ metabolism in these models.
Given the existence of different cellular NAD+ pools and the rele-
vance of mitochondrial NAD+ for mitochondrial and cellular func-
tion, an important question remains how these NAD+ cellular
pools communicate with each other and modulate the aging pro-
cess and disease risk.
Here, we report that human iPSC-derived neurons rely on
NAMPT for maintenance of the NAD+ pool, they are responsive
to NAD+ precursors and utilize NRK1 as the main metabolic
pathway to synthetize NAD+ from exogenous NR in a NAMPT-in-
dependent manner. NR administration caused a significant in-
crease of NAD+. Besides NAD+, levels of NAM were also
increased upon NR treatment, suggesting an increase of the ac-
tivity of NAD+ consuming enzymes that convert NAD+ to NAM.
However, we cannot exclude a partial conversion of exogenous
NR into NAM before synthesis to NAD+. Levels of the immediate
downstream product of NR, NMN, tended to be higher in NR-
treated cells, but this difference was not statistically significant.
This would suggest a rapid conversion of NMN into NAD+. In
our model systems, NR ameliorated mitochondrial function and
rescued mitochondrial quality control. We also observed an
increased expression of BNIP3L/NIX after NR treatment. In line
with this, mitochondrial content decreased after 24 hr of NR
treatment, which points toward increased mitophagy. However,
prolonged NR treatment boosted mitochondrial content and
increased TFAM, which underlines the dual role of NAD+ and sir-
tuins in maintaining mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control.
Furthermore, supporting an increase in mitophagy, NR positively
regulated autophagic function. Importantly, we found that NAD+
supplementation rescues the age-dependent loss of DA neurons
and decline in motor ability in a GBA-PD Drosophila model.
In summary, our study elucidates the mechanisms involved in
GBA-PD and reveals mitochondrial dysfunction as a key driver of
disease. Our findings show that NAD+ precursors ameliorate
GBA-related defects. Among the available NAD+ precursors,
NR may be a valuable therapeutic approach due to its high
bioavailability, minimal toxicity, and evidence of its ability to
cross the blood-brain barrier (Trammell et al., 2016). Future
studies will explore the potential therapeutic
benefits of
combining NAD+ boosters with chaperones and GCase activa-
tors (Migdalska-Richards et al., 2016).
