Abstract
Problem/Condition: Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion surveillance to document the number and characteristics of 
women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United States.
Period Covered: 2014.
Description of System: Each year, CDC requests abortion data from the central health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and New York City). The reporting areas provide this information voluntarily. For 2014, data 
were received from 49 reporting areas. For trend analysis, abortion data were evaluated from 48 areas that reported data every year 
during 2005–2014. Census and natality data, respectively, were used to calculate abortion rates (number of abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years) and ratios (number of abortions per 1,000 live births).
Results: A total of 652,639 abortions were reported to CDC for 2014. Of these abortions, 98.4% were from the 48 reporting 
areas that provided data every year during 2005–2014. Among these 48 reporting areas, the abortion rate for 2014 was 12.1 
abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years, and the abortion ratio was 186 abortions per 1,000 live births. From 2013 to 
2014, the total number and rate of reported abortions decreased 2%, and the ratio decreased 7%. From 2005 to 2014, the total 
number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 21%, 22%, and 21%, respectively. In 2014, all three measures reached 
their lowest level for the entire period of analysis (2005–2014).
In 2014 and throughout the period of analysis, women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions and had the highest 
abortion rates; women in their 30s and older accounted for a much smaller percentage of abortions and had lower abortion rates. 
In 2014, women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years accounted for 32.2% and 26.7% of all reported abortions, respectively, and had 
abortion rates of 21.3 and 18.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years, respectively. In contrast, women aged 
30–34, 35–39, and ≥40 years accounted for 17.1%, 9.7%, and 3.6% of all reported abortions, respectively, and had abortion 
rates of 11.9, 7.2, and 2.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 30–34 years, 35–39 years, and ≥40 years, respectively. From 2005 
to 2014, the abortion rate decreased among women aged 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, and 35–39 years by 27%, 16%, 12%, and 5%, 
respectively, but increased 4% among women aged ≥40 years.
In 2014, adolescents aged <15 and 15–19 years accounted for 0.3% and 10.4% of all reported abortions, respectively, and had 
abortion rates of 0.5 and 7.5 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged <15 and 15–19 years, respectively. From 2005 to 2014, the 
percentage of abortions accounted for by adolescents aged 15–19 years decreased 38%, and their abortion rate decreased 49%. 
These decreases were greater than the decreases for women in any older age group.
In contrast to the percentage distribution of abortions and abortion rates by age, abortion ratios in 2014 and throughout the 
entire period of analysis were highest among adolescents and lowest among women aged 30–39 years. Abortion ratios decreased 
from 2005 to 2014 for women in all age groups.
In 2014, the majority (67.0%) of abortions were performed at ≤8 weeks’ gestation, and nearly all (91.5%) were performed at ≤13 weeks’ 
gestation. Few abortions were performed between 14 and 20 weeks’ gestation (7.2%) or at ≥21 weeks’ gestation (1.3%). During 2005–2014, 
the percentage of all abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation remained consistently high (≥91.4%). Among abortions performed at 
≤13 weeks’ gestation, there was a shift toward earlier gestational 
ages, as the percentage performed at ≤6 weeks’ gestation increased 
21%, and the percentage of all other gestational ages at ≤13 weeks’ 
gestation decreased 7%–20%.

MMWR / November 24, 2017 / Vol. 66 / No. 24
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
In 2014, among reporting areas that included medical (nonsurgical) abortion on their reporting form, 22.6% of all abortions 
were performed by early medical abortion (a nonsurgical abortion at ≤8 weeks’ gestation), 67.4% were performed by surgical 
abortion at ≤13 weeks’ gestation, and 8.6% were performed by surgical abortion at >13 weeks’ gestation; all other methods were 
uncommon (<2%). Among abortions performed at ≤8 weeks’ gestation that were eligible for early medical abortion on the basis 
of gestational age, 32.2% were completed by this method.
In 2014, women with one or more previous live births accounted for 59.5% of abortions, and women with no previous live births 
accounted for 40.4%. Women with one or more previous induced abortions accounted for 44.9% of abortions, and women with 
no previous abortion accounted for 55.1%. Women with three or more previous births accounted for 13.8% of abortions, and 
women with three or more previous abortions accounted for 8.6% of abortions.
Deaths of women associated with complications from abortion for 2014 are being assessed as part of CDC’s Pregnancy Mortality 
Surveillance System. In 2013, the most recent year for which data were available, four women were identified to have died as a 
result of complications from legal induced abortion.
Interpretation: Among the 48 areas that reported data every year during 2005–2014, the decreases in the total number, rate, 
and ratio of reported abortions that occurred during 2010–2013 continued from 2013 to 2014, resulting in historic lows for all 
three measures of abortion.
Public Health Action: The data in this report can help program planners and policymakers identify groups of women with the 
highest rates of abortion. Unintended pregnancy is the major contributor to induced abortion. Increasing access to and use of effective 
contraception can reduce unintended pregnancies and further reduce the number of abortions performed in the United States.
Introduction
This report summarizes abortion data for 2014 that were 
provided voluntarily to CDC by the central health agencies 
of 49 reporting areas (the District of Columbia [DC]; New 
York City; and 47 states, excluding California, Maryland, 
and New Hampshire). Data obtained every year during 
2005–2014 from 48 reporting areas (excluding California, 
Louisiana, Maryland, and New Hampshire) were used for 
trend analyses. Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion 
surveillance to document the number and characteristics 
of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United 
States (1). Following nationwide legalization of abortion in 
1973, the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years), and ratio (number of abortions 
per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, 
reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at 
a slow yet steady pace (2–4). During 2006–2008, a break 
occurred in the previously sustained pattern of decrease (5–8) 
although this break has been followed in all subsequent years 
by even greater decreases (9–14). Nonetheless, throughout the 
years, the incidence of abortion has varied considerably across 
subpopulations and remains higher in some demographic 
groups than others (15–20). Continued surveillance is needed 
to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in 
the United States.
Methods
Description of the Surveillance System
Each year, CDC requests tabulated data from the central 
health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, and New York City) to document the number and 
characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the 
United States. For the purpose of surveillance, a legal induced 
abortion* is defined as an intervention performed within the 
limits of state law by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-
midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended 
to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy.
In most states, collection of abortion data is facilitated by the 
legal requirement for hospitals, facilities, and physicians to report 
all abortions to a central health agency although reporting is not 
complete in all areas with these requirements (21). Moreover, 
these central health agencies then voluntarily report the abortion 
data they have collected through their independent surveillance 
systems and provide only aggregate numbers to CDC (22). 
Although reporting to CDC is voluntary, most reporting areas 
provide their aggregate abortion numbers. During 2005–2014, 
a total of 48 reporting areas provided CDC a continuous annual 
record of abortion numbers† and in 2014, CDC obtained 
* Hereafter, all abortions in this report are considered to be legally induced unless 
stated to be illegally induced.
† Data were not reported for ≥1 year by California (2005–2014), Louisiana 
(2005), Maryland (2007–2014), and New Hampshire (2005–2014).

aggregate abortion numbers from 49 reporting areas (excludes 
California, Maryland, and New Hampshire).
Although CDC obtains aggregate abortion numbers from 
most of the central health agencies, the level of detail received 
on the characteristics of women obtaining abortions varies 
considerably from year to year and by reporting area. To 
encourage more uniform collection of these details, CDC has 
collaborated with the National Association of Public Health 
Statistics and Information Systems to develop reporting 
standards and provide technical guidance for vital statistics 
personnel who collect and summarize abortion data within the 
United States. However, because the collection and reporting of 
abortion data are not federally mandated, many reporting areas 
have developed their own data collection forms and therefore 
do not collect or provide all the information or level of detail 
included in this report.
Variables and Categorization of Data
Each year, CDC sends suggested templates to the central 
health agencies for compilation of abortion data in aggregate. 
Aggregate abortion numbers, without individual-level records, 
are requested for the following variables:
• Maternal age in years (<15, 15–19 by individual year, 
20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, or ≥40)
• Gestational age in completed weeks at the time of abortion 
(≤6, 7–20 by individual week, or ≥21)
• Race (black, white, or other [including Asian, Pacific 
Islander, other races, and multiple races])
• Ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic)
• Method type (surgical abortion,§ intrauterine instillation, 
medical [nonsurgical] abortion, or hysterectomy/hysterotomy)
• Marital status (married [including currently married or 
separated] or unmarried [including never married, 
widowed, or divorced])
• Number of previous live births (0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4)
• Number of previous abortions (0, 1, 2, or ≥3)
• Maternal residence (the state, reporting area, territory, or 
foreign country in which the woman obtaining the 
abortion lived; or, if additional details are unavailable, 
in-reporting area versus out-of-reporting area)
Beginning with 2014 data, some areas reported gestational age 
to CDC by probable postfertilization age. To make these data 
consistent with gestational age data reported by clinician’s estimate 
(23), 2 weeks were added to postfertilization age to account for 
time after last menstrual period until ovulation in a standard 28-day 
cycle because fertilization occurs around the time of ovulation (24).
§ Includes aspiration curettage, suction curettage, manual vacuum aspiration, 
menstrual extraction, sharp curettage, and dilation and evacuation procedures.
In addition to sending templates for compiling information 
on race and ethnicity as separate variables, since 2001, CDC 
has provided alternative templates for the tabulation of 
aggregate cross-classified race/ethnicity data. Before 2007, few 
reporting areas returned these alternative templates; results by 
these cross-classified race/ethnicity categories (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic) 
are thus shown only for 2007–2014.
Finally, both the original and alternative templates provided 
by CDC request that aggregate numbers for certain variables 
be cross-tabulated by a second variable. These cross-tabulations 
include gestational age (separately by maternal age, by method 
type, by race, by ethnicity, and by race/ethnicity) and maternal 
age and marital status (separately by race, by ethnicity, and by 
race/ethnicity).
In this report, medical and surgical abortions are further 
categorized by gestational age. Early medical abortion in 
this report is defined as the administration of medication or 
medications (typically mifepristone followed by misoprostol) 
to induce an abortion at ≤8 completed weeks’ gestation¶; 
medical abortion at >8 completed weeks’ gestation is defined 
as the administration of medication or medications (typically 
serial vaginal prostaglandins sometimes following mifepristone) 
to induce an abortion at >8 weeks’ gestation. For surgical 
abortions, abortions are categorized as having been performed 
at ≤13 weeks’ gestation or at >13 weeks’ gestation because 
of differences in technique used generally before and after 
13 weeks (26). Finally, because intrauterine instillations cannot 
be performed early in gestation, abortions reported to have 
been performed by intrauterine instillation at ≤12 weeks’ 
gestation are excluded from calculation of the percentage of 
abortions by known method type.**
Measures of Abortion
Four measures of abortion are presented in this report: 
1) the total number of abortions in a given population, 
2) the percentage of abortions obtained by women in a given 
population, 3) the abortion rate (number of abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years or other specific group within a given 
population), and 4) the abortion ratio (number of abortions 
 ¶ CDC collects information only on the estimated number of weeks (not days) 
of gestation and acknowledges the conventional use of completed weeks of 
gestation to describe pregnancy duration. CDC’s category ≤8 weeks’ gestation 
thus includes abortions up through 8 weeks and 6 days. This closely 
corresponds to the performance measure for medical abortion proposed by 
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for the year 
encompassed by this surveillance report (25).
 
** The cutoff of ≤12 weeks has been selected on the basis of the implausibility 
of this procedure being performed at earlier gestational ages and on the basis 
of early research assessing the safety of intrauterine instillations starting at 
13 weeks’ gestation (27,28)

per 1,000 live births within a given population). Although 
total numbers and percentages are useful for determining 
how many women have obtained an abortion, abortion rates 
adjust for differences in population size and reflect how likely 
abortion is among women in particular groups. Abortion ratios 
measure the relative number of pregnancies in a population 
that end in abortion compared with live birth. Abortion 
ratios are influenced both by the proportion of pregnancies 
in a population that are unintended and the proportion of 
unintended pregnancies that end in abortion. Abortion ratios 
also are influenced by the proportion of intended pregnancies 
that end in abortion; however, intended pregnancies account 
for a very small percentage of abortions (<5%) (29).
U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the resident female 
population of the United States were used as the denominator 
for calculating abortion rates (30–39). Overall abortion 
rates were calculated from the population of women aged 
15–44 years living in the reporting areas that provided data. 
For adolescents aged <15 years, abortion rates were determined 
on the basis of the number of adolescents aged 13–14 years; 
similarly, for women aged ≥40 years, abortion rates were 
determined on the basis of the number of women aged 
40–44 years. For the calculation of abortion ratios, live birth 
data were obtained from CDC natality files (40) and included 
births to women of all ages living in the reporting areas that 
provided abortion data.
Data Presentation and Analysis
This report provides state-specific and overall abortion 
numbers, rates, and ratios for the 49 areas that reported 
to CDC for 2014 (excludes California, Maryland, and 
New Hampshire). In addition, this report describes the 
characteristics of women who obtained abortions in 2014. 
Because the completeness of reporting on the characteristics 
of women varies by year and by variable, this report only 
describes the characteristics of women obtaining abortions 
in areas that met reporting standards (i.e., reported at least 
20 abortions overall, provided data categorized in accordance 
with surveillance variables, and had <15% unknown values 
for a given characteristic). Abortion rates and ratios have been 
omitted for reporting areas with <20 abortions because results 
are considered unstable (41). Cells with a value in the range of 
1–4 have been suppressed to maintain confidentiality.
Although most of the data are presented by the reporting 
area in which the abortions were performed, 48 reporting areas 
in 2014 also provided the number of abortions by maternal 
residence.†† However, two of these reporting areas (Illinois and 
 
†† Excludes four reporting areas that did not report or did not report by maternal 
residence (California, Florida, Maryland, and New Hampshire).
Wisconsin) reported certain characteristics for in-state residents 
but not for out-of-state residents. Four other reporting areas 
(Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and New Mexico) provided 
only the total number of abortions for out-of-state residents 
without specifying individual states or areas of residence from 
which these women came. As a result, abortion statistics in this 
report by area of residence should be interpreted with caution 
and might underestimate the incidence of abortion, especially 
for reporting areas from which many women travel to other 
states to obtain abortion services.
To evaluate overall trends in the number, rate, and ratio of 
reported abortions, annual data are presented for the 48 areas 
that reported every year during 2005–2014. Linear regression 
analysis was used to assess the overall rate of change among 
these areas during the entire 10-year period of analysis (2005–
2014) and during the first and second halves of the period of 
analysis (2005–2009 and 2010–2014). The percentage change 
in abortion measures from the most recent past year (2013 
to 2014) and from the beginning to the end of the 10-year 
period of analysis (2005 to 2014) also were calculated for these 
same 48 areas. Consistent with previous reports, key findings 
are highlighted to provide observed changes over time and 
differences between groups. However, comparisons do not 
infer statistical significance, and lack of comment regarding the 
difference between values does not imply that no statistically 
significant difference exists.
For the analysis of certain additional variables (i.e., abortions 
by maternal age and gestational age), annual data are presented 
for areas that met reporting standards every year during 2005–
2014; the percentage change was calculated from the beginning 
to the end of the 10-year period of analysis (2005 to 2014), 
from the beginning to the end of the first and second halves 
of this period (2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014), and from 
the most recent past year (2013 to 2014). For other variables 
(i.e., race/ethnicity, method for performing an abortion, 
marital status, number of previous abortions, and number of 
previous live births), annual data are not presented; areas were 
included if they met reporting standards for the years needed 
for percentage change calculations. To evaluate trends in the 
use of different methods for performing an abortion, reporting 
areas were included only if they met reporting standards and 
if they specifically included medical abortion as a method on 
their reporting form.
Medical abortions performed at 9 completed weeks are also 
reported for 2011 to 2014. These data are reported to monitor 
any changes in clinical practice that might have occurred with 
the accumulation of evidence on the safety and effectiveness 
of medical abortion past 63 days of gestation (≤8 completed 
weeks) (42) and changes in professional practice guidelines 
published in 2013 and 2014 (43,44). Both of these events

preceded the 2016 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
extension of the gestational age limit for the use of mifepristone 
for early medical abortion to 70 days (≤9 completed weeks) (45).
Some of the 49 areas that reported for 2014 are not included 
in certain trend analyses when data did not meet reporting 
standards. As a result, summary measures for comparisons over 
time might differ slightly from the point estimates presented 
for all areas that reported for 2014.
Abortion Mortality
CDC has reported data on abortion-related deaths 
periodically since information on abortion mortality first was 
included in the 1972 abortion surveillance report (14,46). 
An abortion-related death is defined as a death resulting 
from a direct complication of an abortion (legal or illegal), 
an indirect complication caused by a chain of events initiated 
by an abortion, or an aggravation of a pre-existing condition 
by the physiologic or psychologic effects of abortion (47). All 
deaths determined to be related causally to induced abortion 
are classified as abortion related regardless of the time between 
the abortion and death. In addition, any pregnancy-related 
death in which the pregnancy outcome was induced abortion 
regardless of the causal relation between the abortion and the 
death is considered an abortion-related death. An abortion is 
defined as legal only if it is performed by a licensed clinician 
within the limits of state law.
Since 1987, CDC has monitored abortion-related deaths 
through its Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (48,49). 
Sources of data for abortion-related deaths have included state 
vital records; media reports, including computerized searches 
of full-text newspaper and other print media databases; and 
individual case reports by public health agencies, including 
maternal mortality review committees, health care providers 
and provider organizations, private citizens, and citizen 
groups. For each death that possibly is related to abortion, 
CDC requests clinical records and autopsy reports. Two 
medical epidemiologists independently review these reports 
to determine the cause of death and whether the death was 
abortion related. Discrepancies are discussed and resolved by 
consensus. Each death is categorized by abortion type as legal 
induced, illegal induced, spontaneous, or unknown type.
This report provides data from the Pregnancy Mortality 
Surveillance System on induced abortion-related deaths 
that occurred in 2013, the most recent year for which data 
are available. Data on induced abortion-related deaths that 
occurred during 1972–2012 already have been published (14), 
and possible abortion-related deaths that occurred during 
2014–2017 are being assessed. For 1998–2013, abortion 
surveillance data reported to CDC cannot be used alone to 
calculate national case-fatality rates (number of legal induced 
abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced 
abortions in the United States) because certain states§§ 
did not report abortion data every year during this period. 
Thus, national legal induced abortion case-fatality rates were 
calculated with denominator data from a more complete 
source on the total number of abortions performed in the 
United States (50). Because rates determined on the basis of 
a numerator of <20 deaths are highly variable (41), national 
legal induced abortion case-fatality rates were calculated 
for consecutive 5-year periods during 1973–2007 and for a 
consecutive 6-year period during 2008–2013.
Results
U.S. Totals
Among the 49 reporting areas that provided data for 2014, a 
total of 652,639 abortions were reported. Of these abortions, 
642,317 (98.4%) were obtained from the 48 reporting areas 
that provided data every year during 2005–2014.¶¶ These 
same 48 areas had an abortion rate of 12.1 abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years and an abortion ratio of 186 abortions 
per 1,000 live births (Table 1). From 2013 to 2014, the total 
number of reported abortions decreased 2% (from 654,458), 
the abortion rate decreased 2% (from 12.4 abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years), and the abortion ratio decreased 
7% (from 199 abortions per 1,000 live births). From 2005 to 
2014, among the same 48 areas that reported every year during 
this period, the total number of reported abortions decreased 
21% (from 809,354), the abortion rate decreased 22% (from 
15.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years), and the 
abortion ratio decreased 21% (from 235 abortions per 1,000 live 
births) (Figure 1). Among these same 48 areas, the annual rate 
of decrease fitted from the regression analysis was greater during 
2010–2014 than during 2005–2009 for all three measures of 
abortion. During 2010–2014, the number of reported abortions 
decreased by 29,583 abortions per year, the abortion rate 
decreased by 0.62 abortions per 1,000 women per year, and 
the abortion ratio decreased by 10.1 abortions per 1,000 live 
births per year. In contrast, during 2005–2009, the number of 
reported abortions decreased by 7,451 abortions per year, the 
abortion rate decreased by 0.16 abortions per 1,000 women 
per year, and the abortion ratio decreased by 2.3 abortions per 
1,000 live births per year.

§ Data are for 48 reporting areas; excludes California, Louisiana, Maryland, and New Hampshire.
Occurrence and Residence
Abortion numbers, rates, and ratios for 2014 have been 
calculated by reporting area of occurrence and the residence of 
the women who obtained the abortions (Table 2). By reporting 
area of occurrence, a considerable range existed in the abortion 
rate (from 3.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years 
in South Dakota to 23.9 abortions per 1,000 women in New 
York [city and state combined]) and the abortion ratio (from 
45 abortions per 1,000 live births in South Dakota to 293 
abortions per 1,000 live births in the District of Columbia).*** 
Similarly, a considerable range existed by residence††† in the 
abortion rate (from 4.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 
15–44 years in Utah to 23.2 abortions per 1,000 women aged 
15–44 years in New York [city and state combined]) and the 
abortion ratio (from 57 abortions per 1,000 live births in

a consequence meaningful statistics cannot be reported.
Utah to 293 abortions per 1,000 live births in Connecticut). 
Because of variation that occurred among reporting areas in 
the percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents 
(from 0.9% in Hawaii to 55.6% in the District of Columbia), 
abortion rates and ratios calculated by maternal residence 
might provide a more accurate reflection of the state-specific 
distribution of women obtaining abortions. However, because 
states vary in the level of detail they collect on maternal 
residence, 12.2% of abortions were reported to CDC without 
exact information on maternal residence.
Maternal Age
Among the 46 areas that reported by maternal age for 2014, 
women in their 20s accounted for the majority (58.9%) of 
abortions and had the highest abortion rates (21.3 and 18.4 
abortions per 1,000 women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years, 
respectively) (Figure 2) (Table 3). Women in the youngest 
(<15 years) and oldest (≥40 years) age groups accounted for the 
smallest percentages of abortions (0.3% and 3.6%, respectively) 
and had the lowest abortion rates (0.5 and 2.6 abortions per

1,000 women aged <15 and ≥40 years, respectively). Among 
the 42 reporting areas that provided data by maternal age 
every year during 2005–2014, this pattern across age groups 
was stable, with the majority of abortions and the highest 
abortion rates occurring among women aged 20–29 years 
and the lowest percentages of abortions and abortion rates 
occurring among women in the youngest and oldest age groups 
(Table 4). From 2005 to 2014, abortion rates decreased among 
all age groups <40 years, although the decreases for adolescents 
(62% and 49% for adolescents aged <15 and 15–19 years, 
respectively) were greater than the decreases for women aged 
20–39 years (5%–27%). For all age groups, including women 
aged ≥40 years, decreases in the abortion rate were greater from 
2010 to 2014 than from 2005 to 2009, and these decreases 
continued from 2013 to 2014 for all age groups <25 years.
In contrast to the percentage of abortions and abortion rates, 
abortion ratios in 2014 were highest among adolescents aged 
≤19 years and lowest among women aged 30–39 years (Figure 2) 
(Table 3). Among the 42 reporting areas that provided data by 
maternal age for every year during 2005–2014, abortion ratios 
decreased among women in all age groups. The abortion ratio 
increased 12% for adolescents aged <15 years from 2005 to 
2009 but decreased for all age groups from 2010 to 2014. In 
addition, for every age group with declines for both periods, 
the declines that occurred from 2010 to 2014 exceeded the 
declines from 2005 to 2009; for every age group, these declines 
continued from 2013 to 2014 (Table 4).
Adolescents
Among the 43 areas that reported maternal age by individual 
year among adolescents for 2014, adolescents aged 18–19 years 
accounted for the majority (66.8%) of adolescent abortions 
and had the highest adolescent abortion rates (10.6 and 
14.3 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged 18 and 19 years, 
respectively); adolescents aged <15 years accounted for the 
smallest percentage of adolescent abortions (2.8%) and had 
the lowest adolescent abortion rate (0.5 abortions per 1,000

adolescents aged 13–14 years) (Table 5). Among the 38 
reporting areas that provided maternal age data for adolescents 
for each individual year of reporting during 2005–2014, the 
percentage of abortions accounted for by adolescents aged 18 
and 19 years increased, whereas the percentage of abortions 
accounted for by adolescents aged <18 years decreased (Table 6). 
Among adolescents aged <18 years, abortion rates decreased 
by 57%–62%; among adolescents aged 18 and 19 years, the 
abortion rates decreased 50% and 43%, respectively. For all 
age groups, decreases in the abortion rate were greater from 
2010 to 2014 than from 2005 to 2009, and these decreases 
continued from 2013 to 2014.
In 2014, the abortion ratio for adolescents decreased with 
increasing age and was lowest among adolescents aged 19 years 
(Table 5). During 2005–2014, abortion ratios decreased among 
adolescents of all ages (Table 6).
Gestational Age
Among the 40 areas that reported gestational age at the time 
of abortion for 2014, the majority (67.0%) of abortions were 
performed by ≤8 weeks’ gestation, and 91.5% were performed 
at ≤13 weeks’ gestation (Table 7). Few abortions were performed 
at 14–20 weeks’ gestation (7.2%) or at ≥21 weeks’ gestation 
(1.3%). Among the 32 reporting areas that provided data on 
gestational age every year during 2005–2014, the percentage 
of abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation was stable 
(Table 8). However, within this gestational age range, a shift 
occurred toward earlier gestational ages, with the percentage 
of abortions performed at ≤8 weeks’ gestation increasing 6% 
and the percentage of abortions performed at 9–13 weeks’ 
gestation decreasing 13%. For the entire period of analysis, 
abortions performed at >13 weeks’ gestation accounted for 
≤8.5% of abortions.
Among abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation and 
reported by individual week of gestation for 2014, 40.7% were 
performed at ≤6 weeks’ gestation (Table 9). The percentage 
contribution to abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation was 
progressively smaller for each additional week of gestation: 18.5% 
were performed at 7 weeks’ gestation, and 2.9% were performed 
at 13 weeks’ gestation. Among the 32 areas that reported by exact 
week of gestation for abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation 
every year during 2005–2014, a shift occurred toward the earliest 
gestational age reported: abortions performed at ≤6 weeks’ 
gestation increased 21%, and those performed at 7–13 weeks’ 
gestation decreased 7%–20% (Table 10).
Method Type
Among the 43 areas that reported by method type for 2014 
and included medical abortion on their reporting form for 
medical providers, 67.4% of abortions were surgical abortions 
at ≤13 weeks’ gestation, 22.6% were early medical abortions (a 
nonsurgical abortion at ≤8 weeks’ gestation), and 8.6% were 
surgical abortions at >13 weeks’ gestation; all other methods 
were uncommon (<2%) (Table 11). Among the 35 reporting 
areas that included medical abortion on their reporting form 
and provided these data for the relevant years of comparison 
(2005 versus 2014, 2005 versus 2009, 2010 versus 2014, and 
2013 versus 2014),§§§ use of early medical abortion increased 
1% from 2013 to 2014 (from 22.2% of abortions to 22.5%); 
from 2005 to 2014, use of early medical abortion increased 
110% (from 10.7% of abortions to 22.5%). Increases in early 
medical abortion occurred both from 2005 to 2009 (from 
10.7% of abortions to 16.5% [54% increase]) and from 2010 
to 2014 (from 18.4% of abortions to 22.5% [22% increase]).
Among the 31 reporting areas that provided data by 
procedure and individual week of gestational age each year from 
2011 to 2014, the percentage of abortions at 9 weeks’ gestation 
that were medical abortions did not change substantially 
between 2011, 2012, and 2013 (5.0%, 5.8%, and 6.8%, 
respectively), but then increased to 8.2% in 2014.
In contrast to the increase that occurred in use of early 
medical abortion, use of surgical abortion at ≤13 weeks’ 
gestation decreased 14% from 2005 to 2014 (from 78.8% of 
abortions to 67.5%). Surgical abortion at >13 weeks’ gestation 
consistently accounted for approximately 8.0% of all abortions, 
and all other methods consistently accounted for a small 
percentage of abortions (<0.1%–1.3%) during 2005–2014.
Race/Ethnicity
Among the 30 areas that reported cross-classified race/
ethnicity data for 2014, non-Hispanic white women and non-
Hispanic black women accounted for the largest percentages 
of all abortions (38.0% and 36.0%, respectively), and 
Hispanic women and non-Hispanic women in the other race 
category accounted for smaller percentages (18.3% and 7.7%, 
respectively) (Table 12). Non-Hispanic white women had the 
lowest abortion rate (7.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 
15–44 years) and ratio (121 abortions per 1,000 live births) 
and non-Hispanic black women had the highest abortion rate 
(26.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years) and ratio

(391 abortions per 1,000 live births). Data for 2014 are also 
reported separately by race and by ethnicity (Tables 13 and 14).
Among the 20 areas¶¶¶ that reported by race/ethnicity for 
2007 (the first year with sufficient data), 2009, 2010, and 
2014, abortion rates decreased substantially for all three major 
race/ethnicity groups: for non-Hispanic white women, the 
abortion rate decreased 26% (from 9.4 abortions per 1,000 
women in 2007 to 7.0 in 2014), for non-Hispanic black 
women it decreased 27% (from 36.5 abortions per 1,000 
women in 2007 to 26.7 in 2014), and for Hispanic women 
it decreased 41% (from 20.8 abortions per 1,000 women in 
2007 to 12.3 in 2014). For women in all three major race/
ethnicity groups, abortion rates decreased from 2007 to 2009 
and from 2010 to 2014, but the decreases were greater during 
the later period, especially for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic 
women. From 2007 to 2009, the abortion rates decreased 6% 
for non-Hispanic white women (from 9.4 to 8.8 abortions 
per 1,000), 1% for non-Hispanic black women (from 36.5 to 
36.3 abortions per 1,000), and 8% for Hispanic women (from 
20.8 to 19.1 abortions per 1,000); by contrast from 2010 to 
2014, the abortion rates decreased 18% for non-Hispanic 
white women (from 8.5 to 7.0 abortions per 1,000), 23% 
for non-Hispanic black women (from 34.9 to 26.7 abortions 
per 1,000), and 35% for Hispanic women (from 19.0 to 12.3 
abortions per 1,000).
Abortion ratios also decreased from 2007 to 2014 for all three 
major race/ethnicity groups: for non-Hispanic white women, the 
abortion ratio decreased 23% (from 147 abortions per 1,000 live 
births in 2007 to 113 in 2014), for non-Hispanic black women 
it decreased 19% (from 514 abortions per 1,000 live births in 
2007 to 417 in 2014), and for Hispanic women it decreased 
22% (from 205 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 160 
in 2014). As with abortion rates, decreases in abortion ratios 
were greater for women in all three major race/ethnicity groups 
from 2010 to 2014 as compared with 2007 to 2009, with the 
difference in the change between the two periods being most 
notable for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women. From 
2007 to 2009, abortion ratios decreased 3% among non-
Hispanic white women (from 147 to 142 abortions per 1,000 
live births) but increased 4% among non-Hispanic black women 
(from 514 to 535 abortions per 1,000 live births) and did not 
change among Hispanic women (205 abortions per 1,000 
live births). By contrast, from 2010 to 2014, abortion ratios 
decreased among women in all three race/ethnicity groups. The 
abortion ratio decreased 18% for non-Hispanic white women

Marital Status
Among the 42 areas that reported by marital status for 2014, 
14.5% of all women who obtained an abortion were married, 
and 85.5% were unmarried (Table 15). The abortion ratio was 
43 abortions per 1,000 live births for married women and 373 
abortions per 1,000 live births for unmarried women. Among 
the 35 reporting areas**** that provided these data for the 
relevant years of comparison (2005 versus 2014, 2005 versus 
2009, 2010 versus 2014, and 2013 versus 2014), the percentage 
of abortions among unmarried women increased 3% from 2005 
to 2014 (from 83.5% to 85.7%), with a larger increase from 
2005 to 2009 (2%) than from 2010 to 2014 (<1%). Among 
unmarried women, the abortion ratio decreased 23% from 2005 
to 2014 (from 481 to 369 abortions per 1,000 live births), with 
a larger decrease also occurring from 2010 to 2014 (16%) than 
from 2005 to 2009 (10%). Among married women, the abortion 
ratio decreased 25% from 2005 to 2014 (from 55 to 41 abortions 
per 1,000 live births), with a larger decrease occurring from 2010 
to 2014 (18%) than from 2005 to 2009 (7%).
Previous Live Births and Abortions
Data from the 40 areas that reported the number of previous 
live births for women who obtained abortions in 2014 indicate 
that 40.4%, 45.7%, and 13.8% of these women had zero, 
one to two, or three or more previous live births, respectively 
(Table 16). Among the 32 reporting areas†††† that provided 
these data for the relevant years of comparison (2005 versus 
2014, 2005 versus 2009, 2010 versus 2014, and 2013 versus 
2014), the percentage of women obtaining abortions who had 
no previous live births was stable; by contrast, the percentage 
decreased for women who had one to two previous live births 
and increased for women who had three or more previous live 
births. Among the areas included in this comparison, 40.4%, 
47.0%, and 12.6% of women had zero, one to two, or three

Maternal Age and Marital Status  
by Race/Ethnicity
In certain reporting areas, abortions that were categorized 
by maternal race and race/ethnicity were further categorized 
by maternal age and by marital status (Tables 18 and 19). 
A consistent pattern existed for abortions by maternal age 
across all race/ethnicity groups, with the smallest percentage 
of abortions occurring among adolescents aged <15 years 
(0.2%–0.4%) and the largest percentage occurring among 
women aged 20–24 years (27.3%–33.8%) (Table 19). A 
consistent pattern also existed for abortions by marital status 
across all race/ethnicity groups, with a higher percentage of 
abortions occurring among women who were unmarried 
(68.5%–91.9%) than among those who were married (8.1%–
31.5%) (Table 19). However, for abortions among unmarried 
women, the percentage was higher for non-Hispanic black 
women (91.9%) than for non-Hispanic white (83.1%) or 
Hispanic women (84.7%) (Table 19).

Weeks of Gestation by Maternal Age,  
Race/Ethnicity, and Method Type
In certain reporting areas, abortions that were categorized by 
weeks of gestation were further categorized by maternal age, 
race, and race/ethnicity (Tables 20 and 21). In every subgroup 
for these three variables, the largest percentage of abortions 
occurred at ≤8 weeks’ gestation. However, by maternal age, 
43.0% of adolescents aged <15 years and 56.5% of adolescents 
aged 15–19 years obtained an abortion by ≤8 weeks’ gestation, 
compared with 63.2%–72.5% of women in older age groups 
(Figure 3) (Table 20). Conversely, 22.6% of adolescents 
aged <15 years and 12.5% of adolescents aged 15–19 years 
obtained an abortion after 13 weeks’ gestation, compared with 
8.0%–9.5% for women in older age groups. By race/ethnicity, 
61.0% of non-Hispanic black women obtained an abortion at 
≤8 weeks’ gestation, compared with 69.7%–72.6% of women 
from other race/ethnicity groups. Differences in abortions 
after 13 weeks’ gestation across race/ethnicity groups were 
less apparent than differences across age groups (9.8% for 
non-Hispanic black women, compared with 7.2%–8.1% for 
women in the remaining race/ethnicity groups).
Among abortions categorized by weeks of gestation and 
method type, surgical abortion accounted for the largest 
percentage of abortions within every gestational age category 
(Table 22). At ≤8 weeks’ gestation, surgical abortion accounted 
for a smaller percentage of abortions (67.8%) than at any other 
stage of gestation. At 9–20 weeks’ gestation, surgical abortion 
accounted for 96.6%–98.8% of all abortions; this percentage 
then decreased to 90.2% of abortions at ≥21 weeks’ gestation. By 
contrast, at ≤8 weeks’ gestation early medical abortion accounted 
for 32.2% of abortions then decreased to 3.3% at 9–13 weeks 
and 1.0%–1.4% at 14–17 weeks before increasing to 3.0% at 
18–20 weeks and 9.0% at ≥21 weeks. Throughout gestation, 
abortions performed by intrauterine instillation or hysterectomy/
hysterotomy were rare (<0.01%–0.7% of abortions).
Abortion Mortality
Using national data from the Pregnancy Mortality 
Surveillance System (49), CDC identified four abortion-related 
deaths for 2013 (Table 23). These deaths were identified either 
by some indication of abortion on the death certificate, by 
reports from a health care provider or public health agency, 
or from a media report. Investigation of these cases indicated 
that all four deaths were related to legal abortion and none to 
illegal abortion.
The annual number of deaths related to legal induced 
abortion has fluctuated from year to year over the past 40 years 
(Table 23). For example, nine legal induced abortion-related 
deaths occurred in 1998, four in 1999, and 11 in 2000. 
Because of this variability and the relatively small number of 
legal induced abortion-related deaths every year, national legal 
abortion case-fatality rates were calculated for consecutive 
5-year periods during 1973–2007 and for a consecutive 6-year 
period during 2008–2013. The national legal induced abortion 
case-fatality rate for 2008–2013 was 0.62 legal induced 
abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal abortions. 
This case-fatality rate was similar to the rate for most of the 
preceding 5-year periods but lower than the case-fatality rate 
of 2.09 legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 
reported legal abortions for the 5-year period (1973–1977) 
immediately following nationwide legalization of abortion in 
1973. Possible abortion-related deaths that occurred during 
2014–2017 are being assessed.
Discussion
For 2014, a total of 652,639 abortions were reported to 
CDC. Of these abortions, 642,317 (98.4%) were from 48 
reporting areas that submitted data every year during 2005–
2014, thus providing the information necessary for evaluating 
trends. These 48 areas had an abortion rate of 12.1 abortions 
per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years and an abortion ratio of 
186 abortions per 1,000 live births. Among these areas, the 
number and rate of reported abortions decreased 2%, and the 
ratio decreased 7%, which, in combination with decreases 
that occurred during 2010–2013 (11–14), resulted in the 
lowest values for the entire period of analysis for all three 
measures. Among areas that reported by age every year during 
2005–2014, women in their 20s accounted for the majority of 
abortions and had the highest abortion rates, and decreases in 
the abortion rate for adolescents aged <20 years were greater 
than the decreases in the abortion rate for any other age 
group. In addition, throughout the period of analysis, ≤8.5% 
of abortions were performed after 13 weeks’ gestation; the 
majority of abortions were performed at ≤8 weeks’ gestation, 
and this percentage increased from 63.5% in 2005 to 67.0% 
in 2014. Among areas that included medical abortion on 
their reporting form every year, the percentage of all abortions 
performed by early medical abortion increased from 10.7% in 
2005 to 22.5% in 2014.
In addition to highlighting changes in abortion that 
occurred among all women of reproductive age, this report 
underscores important maternal age differences in abortion 
trends. During 2005–2014, abortion rates for women in their 
20s were consistently higher than for any other age group, and 
women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions 
(56%–59%); therefore, they have contributed substantially to

overall changes. Conversely, during 2005–2014, women aged 
≥40 years had consistently low abortion rates and accounted for 
a small percentage of abortions (≤3.7%); therefore, they have 
had a much smaller contribution to overall abortion trends. 
Nonetheless, among women aged ≥40 years, the abortion ratio 
continues to be higher than among women in their mid to late 
20s and 30s. Given the small proportion of abortions that are 
performed later in gestation among women aged ≥40 years, 
which potentially might be completed for maternal medical 
indications or fetal anomalies, the continuing high abortion 
ratio among these older women suggests that unintended 
pregnancy is a problem that women encounter throughout 
their reproductive years (51).
The adolescent abortion trends described in this report 
are important for monitoring progress that has been made 
toward reducing adolescent pregnancies in the United States. 
During 1990–2011, the pregnancy rate for adolescents 
aged 15–19 years decreased 55% to a historic low of 52.4 
pregnancies per 1,000; this decrease was associated with a larger 
decrease in adolescent abortion rates (67%) as compared with 
birthrates (48%) (52). The most recent national birth data 
indicate that the birthrate for adolescents aged 15–19 years 
decreased an additional 35% from 2011 to 2016 to an all-time 
low (53,54). The 49% decrease from 2005 to 2014 in the 
abortion rate for adolescents aged 15–19 years as compared 
with the 40% decrease in the birth rate for this period suggests 
that adolescent pregnancies in the United States continue to 
decrease and that this decrease continues to be accompanied 
by larger decreases in adolescent abortions compared with live 
births (55,56).
The findings in this report indicate that the number, rate, 
and ratio of reported abortions have declined across all race/
ethnicity groups but that well-documented disparities persist 
(3,4,15–20). Comparatively high abortion rates and ratios 
among non-Hispanic black women have been attributed to 
higher unintended pregnancy rates and a greater percentage of 
unintended pregnancies ending in abortion (57,58). Data from 
certain reports suggest that differences in abortion indicators 
between non-Hispanic black women and women of other 
groups narrowed from 1994 to 2008 (4,19) but remained 
steady from 2008 to 2014 (20). Data in this report on abortions 
by race/ethnicity during 2007–2014 indicate large declines in 
abortion rates and ratios among non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black women, and differences between the two groups 
narrowed in the most recent period from 2010 to 2014. Higher 
abortion rates among Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic 
white women have been attributed to higher pregnancy rates, 
including intended and unintended pregnancies, among 
Hispanic women (57,58). However, abortion ratios for these 
two groups have been more comparable: Hispanic women 
have had a slightly higher percentage of pregnancies that are 
unintended but are no more likely than non-Hispanic white 
women to end unintended pregnancies in abortion (57,58). 
Data in this report on abortions by race/ethnicity during 
2007–2014 indicate large declines in abortion rates for both 
non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women, and differences 
between these two groups narrowed from 2010 to 2014.
The findings in this report indicate the majority of women 
obtaining abortions do so early in gestation (≤8 weeks), when 
the risks for complications are lowest (59–62). Among the 
areas that reported gestational age data every year during 
2005–2014, the percentage of abortions performed at 
≤8 weeks’ gestation increased 6%. Moreover, among the areas 
that reported abortions at ≤13 weeks’ gestation by individual 
week, the distribution continued to shift toward earlier weeks 
of gestation, with the percentage of early abortions performed 
at ≤6 weeks’ gestation increasing 21% from 2005 to 2014. 
Nonetheless, the overall percentage of abortions performed 
at ≤13 weeks’ gestation was stable during 2005–2014, and 
many reports indicate that delays in obtaining an abortion are 
more common among certain groups of women (63–65). The 
findings in this report indicate that among women obtaining 
abortions, a smaller percentage of adolescents aged ≤19 years 
and non-Hispanic black women, compared with women 
in other age and race/ethnicity groups, obtain abortions 
at ≤8 weeks’ gestation. Because of the small but persistent 
percentage of women who obtain abortions at >13 weeks’ 
gestation, a better understanding is needed of how to address 
factors that cause delays in obtaining abortions (63,65–68).
The trend of obtaining abortions earlier in pregnancy has 
been facilitated by changes in abortion practices. Research 
conducted in the United States during the 1970s indicated 
that surgical abortion procedures performed at ≤6 weeks’ 
gestation, compared with 7–12 weeks’ gestation, were less 
likely to result in successful termination of the pregnancy (69). 
However, subsequent advances in technology (e.g., improved 
transvaginal ultrasonography and sensitive pregnancy tests) 
have allowed very early surgical abortions to be performed 
with completion rates exceeding 97% (70–72). Likewise, the 
development of early medical abortion regimens has allowed 
for abortions to be performed very early in gestation, with 
completion rates for regimens that combine mifepristone and 
misoprostol reaching 96%–98% (73). In 2014, 67.0% of all 
reported abortions were performed at ≤8 completed weeks’ 
gestation; thus, the women receiving these abortions were 
eligible for early medical abortion (a nonsurgical abortion at 
≤8 weeks gestation) on the basis of gestational age; 32.2% of 
abortions at ≤8 weeks’ gestation and 22.5% of all abortions 
were reported as early medical abortions, with the proportion 
of all abortions reported as early medical abortion up from

10.7% in 2005. Moreover, in addition to abortions meeting the 
definition of early medical abortion, the percentage of medical 
abortions completed at 9 weeks’ gestation has increased in 
recent years (from 5.0%–6.8% during 2011–2013 to 8.2% in 
2014). On the basis of evidence that early medical abortion is 
safe and effective beyond 63 days’ gestation (42), professional 
clinical practice guidelines were updated midyear in 2013 and 
2014 to extend the gestational age eligibility for early medical 
abortion to 70 days (≤9 completed weeks) (43,44). In early 
2016, FDA updated its approval for use of mifepristone for 
early medical abortions, extending the gestational age limit to 
70 days (45). CDC will continue to monitor medical abortions 
at 9 weeks’ gestation.
The annual number of deaths related to legal induced 
abortion has fluctuated from year to year over the past 
40 years. Because of this variability and the relatively small 
number of abortion-related deaths every year, national legal 
abortion case-fatality rates were calculated for consecutive 
5-year periods during 1973–2007 and for a consecutive 
6-year period during 2008–2013. The national legal induced 
abortion case-fatality rate for 2008–2013 was similar to the 
case-fatality rate for most of the preceding 5-year periods 
but was much lower than the case-fatality rate for the 5-year 
period (1973–1978) that immediately followed nationwide 
legalization of abortion in 1973.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, because reporting requirements are 
established by the individual reporting areas (22), the collection 
of data varies, and CDC is unable to obtain the total number 
of abortions performed in the United States. During the period 
covered by this report, the total annual number of abortions 
reported to CDC was consistently approximately 71% of the 
number recorded by the Guttmacher Institute (74), which 
uses numerous active follow-up techniques to increase the 
completeness of the data obtained through its periodic national 
census of abortion providers (50). Although most reporting 
areas collect and send abortion data to CDC, this information 
is submitted to CDC voluntarily. Consequently, during 
2005–2014, four of the 52 reporting areas did not provide 
CDC data on a consistent annual basis, and for 2014, CDC 
did not obtain any information from California, Maryland, or 
New Hampshire.¶¶¶¶ In addition, whereas most reporting areas 
that send abortion data to CDC have laws requiring medical 
 ¶¶¶¶ In 2014, the most recent year for which the Guttmacher Institute has 
published data, abortions performed in California, Maryland, and New 
Hampshire accounted for 20% of the 926,200 abortions counted through 
the Guttmacher Institute’s national census of abortion providers (50).
providers to submit a report for every abortion they perform 
to a central health agency, in New Jersey and the District 
of Columbia, medical providers submit this information 
voluntarily (21). As a result, the abortion numbers these areas 
report to CDC are incomplete.***** Moreover, even in states 
that legally require medical providers to submit a report for all 
the abortions they perform, enforcement of this requirement 
varies, and as a consequence several other reporting areas 
provide CDC with incomplete numbers.†††††
Second, because reporting requirements are established by 
the individual reporting areas, many states use reporting forms 
that do not follow the technical standards and guidance CDC 
developed in collaboration with the National Association 
of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems. 
Consequently, many reporting areas do not collect all the 
information CDC compiles on the characteristics of women 
obtaining abortions (e.g., maternal age, race, and ethnicity). 
Although missing demographic information can reduce 
the extent to which the statistics in this report represent all 
women in the United States, five nationally representative 
surveys of women obtaining abortions in 1987, 1994–1995, 
2001–2002, 2008, and 2014 (15–18,20) have produced 
percentage distributions for most characteristics that are nearly 
identical to the percentage distributions reported by CDC. 
The exception is the percentage distribution of abortions 
by race/ethnicity. In particular, the percentage of abortions 
accounted for by non-Hispanic black women is higher in this 
report than the percentage determined on the basis of a recent 
nationally representative survey of women obtaining abortions 
(20). Differences might be attributable both to the high degree 
of imprecision for this variable that reduces the reliability of 
national survey results (18,19) and because the number of states 
that report to CDC by race/ethnicity continues to be somewhat 
lower than for other demographic variables. Importantly, some 
reporting areas that have not reported to CDC or have not 
reported cross-classified race/ethnicity data (e.g., California, 
Florida, and Illinois) have sufficiently large populations of 
minority women that the absence of data from these areas 
reduces the representativeness of CDC data.
 
***** In 2014, the abortion numbers that CDC obtained from the District of 
Columbia and New Jersey were 48% and 54%, respectively, of the abortion 
numbers that the Guttmacher Institute obtained for these areas through 
their national census of abortion providers (50).
 
††††† In 2014, the abortion numbers CDC obtained for Wyoming were <5% of 
the numbers obtained for this state by the Guttmacher Institute through 
their national census of abortion providers. CDC numbers for Hawaii were 
57% of the Guttmacher Institute numbers. CDC numbers for Colorado, 
Connecticut, Nevada, New York (city and state combined), North Carolina, 
Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Vermont were 
74%–<90% of the Guttmacher Institute numbers. All other areas with 
legal reporting requirements that provided data to CDC obtained numbers 
that were at least 90% of the Guttmacher Institute numbers (50).

Similar to the case for race/ethnicity, most states have only 
recently included medical abortion as a specific category on 
their reporting forms (21), which might reduce the accuracy 
of CDC’s estimates of the use of this method relative to other 
abortion methods, particularly for trend analysis. Furthermore, 
even in states with medical abortion on their reporting form, it 
is possible that this method is disproportionately undercounted. 
A higher percentage of the abortions provided in physician’s 
offices and smaller caseload facilities are early medical abortions 
(8,50,75), and these practices might be difficult to identify for 
reporting without active surveillance efforts (75). Nonetheless, 
a comparison of CDC data with mifepristone sales data§§§§§ 
suggests that CDC’s Abortion Surveillance System accurately 
describes the use of early medical abortion relative to other 
abortion methods in the United States (76). CDC data also 
might underreport use of early medical abortion with the 
definition of early medical abortion through eight completed 
weeks. Recent changes in clinical practice guidelines for the 
use of mifepristone and misoprostol indicate the safety and 
effectiveness past eight completed weeks of gestation. Although 
the use of medical abortion past this gestational age might have 
increased with these changes, this information is not captured 
in the current CDC definition.
Third, abortion data are compiled and reported to CDC by 
the central health agency of the reporting area in which the 
abortion was performed rather than the reporting area in which 
the woman lived. Thus, the available population (30–39) and 
birth data (40), which are organized by the states in which 
women live, differ in some cases from the population of 
women who undergo abortions in a given reporting area. This 
likely results in an overestimation of abortions for reporting 
areas in which a high percentage of abortions are obtained by 
out-of-state residents and an underestimation of abortions for 
states where residents frequently obtain abortions out of state. 
Limited abortion services, more stringent legal requirements 
for obtaining an abortion, or geographic proximity to services 
in another state might influence where women obtain abortion 
services. To adjust for these reporting biases, CDC attempts 
to categorize abortions by residence in addition to geographic 
occurrence. However, in 2014, CDC was unable to identify 
the reporting area, territory, or country of residence for 12.2% 
of reported abortions.
Finally, reporting areas provide CDC with aggregate 
numbers rather than individual-level records. Therefore, 
stratified analyses by socioeconomic status cannot be done.
 
§§§§§ 
Because the sole distributor of mifepristone in the United States only sells 
this medication to licensed physicians, who must sign and return a 
prescriber’s agreement, sales data from this company are not limited by 
individual state reporting requirements or the difficulties of identifying 
smaller providers within the wider medical community.
Public Health Implications
Ongoing surveillance of legal induced abortion is 
important for several reasons. First, abortion surveillance 
is needed to guide and evaluate the success of programs 
aimed at preventing unintended pregnancies. Although 
pregnancy intentions can be difficult to assess (79–84), 
abortion surveillance provides an important measure of 
pregnancies that are unwanted. Second, routine abortion 
surveillance is needed to assess trends in clinical practice 
patterns over time. Information in this report on the number 
of abortions performed through different methods (e.g., 
medical or surgical) and at different gestational ages provides 
the denominator data that are necessary for analyses of the 
relative safety of abortion practices. Finally, information on 
the number of pregnancies ending in abortion is needed 
in conjunction with data on births and fetal losses to more 
accurately estimate the number of pregnancies in the United 
States and determine rates for various outcomes of public 
health importance (e.g., adolescent pregnancies) (52,85).
According to the most recent national estimates from 
2010, 18% of all pregnancies in the United States end 
in induced abortion (86). Multiple factors influence the 
incidence of abortion, including access to health care services 
and contraception (87–89); the availability of abortion 
providers (8,9,50,90–92); state regulations, such as mandatory 
waiting periods (68), parental involvement laws (93), and 
legal restrictions on abortion providers (94,95); increasing 
acceptance of nonmarital childbearing (96,97); shifts in the 
race/ethnicity composition of the U.S. population (98,99); 
and changes in the economy and the resulting impact on 
fertility preferences and use of contraception (100,101). 
However, despite the multiple influences on abortion, 
because unintended pregnancy precedes nearly all cases of 
abortions,¶¶¶¶¶ efforts to reduce the incidence of abortion 
need to focus on helping women, men, and couples avoid 
pregnancies that they do not desire.
Providing women and men with the knowledge and resources 
necessary to make decisions about their sexual behavior and use 
of contraception can help them avoid unintended pregnancies. 
Recent data indicate that the proportion of pregnancies in the 
United States that were unintended decreased from 51% in 
2008 to 45% during 2011–2013, after a slight increase from 
2001 to 2008 (51). One factor that might have contributed 
to this decrease is the increase that occurred during the same 
period in the use of the most effective forms of reversible 
contraception, specifically intrauterine devices and hormonal 
implants, which are as effective as sterilization at preventing 
 
¶¶¶¶¶ Recent estimates suggest that intended pregnancies account for <5% of all 
abortions (29).

unintended pregnancy (102–105). Although use of intrauterine 
devices and implants has increased in recent years, use of 
these methods remains low in comparison with use of oral 
contraceptives and condoms, both of which are less effective 
at preventing pregnancy (102,104). The majority of reported 
abortions in 2014 were among women with a previous birth or 
previous induced abortion, events that also are opportunities 
for contraception counseling and initiation; contraception 
provision in the immediate postpartum and postabortion 
settings might increase access to methods considered safe for 
many women (106). Additionally, providing contraception 
for women at no cost can increase use of these methods and 
reduce abortion rates (87–89). Cost, as well as insufficient 
provider reimbursement and training, inadequate client-
centered counseling or youth-friendly services, and low client 
awareness of available contraceptive methods are common 
barriers to accessing contraception (107–109). Removing 
these barriers can help improve contraceptive use, thereby 
reducing the number of unintended pregnancies (107,110) 
and consequently the number of abortions performed in the 
United States.

 * Number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years.
 
† Number of abortions per 1,000 live births.
 
§ Additional details on the state in which abortions were provided, cross-tabulated by the state of maternal residence, are available at http://www.cdc.gov/
reproductivehealth/data_stats/Abortion.htm.
 
¶ Reporting area did not report; because numbers for this area are available only from other reporting areas where residents obtained abortions, meaningful statistics 
cannot be reported.
 ** Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 †† Reported by occurrence only; because abortion numbers by residence for Florida are available only from other states where residents obtained abortions, 
meaningful statistics cannot be reported.
 §§ Reporting area reported abortion numbers for both in-state and out-of-state residents; for out-of-state residents, the state or area of residence was not provided.
 ¶¶ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, a complete 
number of abortions performed in New Jersey could not be obtained.
 
*** Total abortion number <20.
 ††† Abortion rates and ratios and percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents were not calculated for Wyoming because results based on a small 
number of abortions are unstable.

TABLE 3. (Continued) Reported abortions, by known age group and reporting area of occurrence — selected reporting areas,* United States, 2014
 * Data from 46 reporting areas; excludes six reporting areas (California, Florida, Maryland, New Hampshire, Texas, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report 
by age, or did not meet reporting standards. 
 
† Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 
§ Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known age divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown age.
 
¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 ** Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 †† Includes residents only.
 §§ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ¶¶ Percentage is based on 520,998 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for age.
 
*** Number of abortions obtained by women in a given age group per 1,000 women in that same age group. Women aged 13–14 years were used as the denominator 
for the group of women aged <15 years, and women aged 40–44 years were used as the denominator for the group of women aged ≥40 years. Women aged 
15–44 years were used as the denominator for the overall rate. For each reporting area, abortions for women of unknown age were distributed according to the 
distribution of abortions among women of known age for that area.
 ††† Number of abortions obtained by women in a given age group per 1,000 live births to women in that same age group. For each reporting area, abortions for 
women of unknown age were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known age for that area.

* Data from 38 reporting areas; by year, these areas represent 71-80% of all abortions reported to CDC for adolescents during 2005–2014. Excludes 14 reporting areas 
(California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and 
Wyoming) that did not report, did not report age among adolescents by individual year, or did not meet reporting standards for ≥1 year.
† Number of abortions obtained by adolescents in a given age group per 1,000 adolescents in that same age group. Adolescents aged 13–14 years were used as the 
denominator for adolescents aged <15 years.
§ Number of abortions obtained by adolescents in a given age group per 1,000 live births to adolescents in that same age group.

 * Gestational age based on the clinician’s estimate (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, 
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia); gestational age calculated from the last normal 
menstrual period (Arkansas, and Oklahoma); probable postfertilization age (Arkansas, and Texas). Two weeks were subtracted from the probable postfertilization 
age to provide a corresponding measure to clinician’s estimate.
 † Data are from 40 reporting areas; excludes 12 areas (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
York State, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by gestational age, or did not meet reporting standards.
 § Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 ¶ Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known gestational age divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown 
gestational age.
 ** Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 †† Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information could 
not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 §§ Percentage is based on 442,287 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for gestational age.

* Gestational age based on the clinician’s estimate (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, 
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia); gestational age calculated from the last normal 
menstrual period (Arkansas and Oklahoma); probable postfertilization age (Arkansas and Texas). Two weeks were subtracted from the probable postfertilization 
age to provide a corresponding measure to clinician’s estimate.
† Data are from 40 reporting areas; excludes 12 areas (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
York State, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by gestational age, or did not meet reporting standards.
§ Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
¶ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information could 
not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.

TABLE 11. (Continued) Reported abortions, by known method type and reporting area of occurrence — selected reporting areas,* 
United States, 2014
Abbreviation: NA = not available. 
 
* Data from 43 reporting areas; excludes nine reporting areas (California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Wyoming) 
that did not report, did not report by method type, or did not meet reporting standards.
 
† Includes aspiration curettage, suction curettage, manual vacuum aspiration, menstrual extraction, sharp curettage, and dilation and evacuation procedures.
 
§ Intrauterine instillations reported at ≤12 weeks’ gestation are not presented with abortions reported by known method type.
 
¶ Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding and because some areas report more than one method for 
each abortion.
 ** Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known method type divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown method type. 
 
†† Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 
§§ Numbers for surgical procedures at ≤13 weeks versus >13 weeks and for medical abortion at ≤8 weeks versus >8 weeks are not presented because gestational 
age data were not provided or were provided in incompatible categories.
 
¶¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 *** Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ††† All abortions were reported as surgical or chemically induced. For this report, all surgical abortions were classified as surgical and all chemical abortions as medical.
 §§§ Surgical abortions reported without a gestational age were distributed among the surgical abortion categories according to the distribution of surgical abortions 
at known gestational age.
 ¶¶¶ Medical abortions reported without a gestational age were distributed among the medical abortion categories according to the distribution of medical abortions 
at known gestational age.
 
**** Percentage is based on 517,217 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for method type.

 ** Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 †† Non-Hispanic categories include abortions for women whose ethnicity was reported as unknown; previous evaluation has shown that most reports without 
ethnicity are for non-Hispanic women.
 §§ Reporting form contains only one question for race and ethnicity; therefore, abortions reported for women of white, black, and other races (Asian and Native 
American) are not explicitly identified as non-Hispanic.
 ¶¶ Percentage is based on 416,892 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for race/ethnicity.
 
*** Number of abortions obtained by women in a given race/ethnicity group per 1,000 women in that same group. For each reporting area, abortions for women of 
unknown race/ethnicity were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known race/ethnicity for that area.
 ††† Number of abortions obtained by women in a given race/ethnicity group per 1,000 live births to women in that same race/ethnicity group. For each reporting area, 
abortions for women of unknown race/ethnicity were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known race/ethnicity for that area.

 * Data from 36 reporting areas; excludes 16 areas (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by ethnicity, or did not meet reporting standards.
 
† Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 
§ Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known ethnicity divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown ethnicity.
 
¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 ** Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 †† Non-Hispanic category includes abortions for women whose ethnicity was reported as unknown; previous evaluation has shown that most reports without 
ethnicity are for non-Hispanic women.
 §§ Reporting form contains only one question for race and ethnicity; therefore, abortions reported for women of white, black, and other races (Asian and Native 
American) are not explicitly identified as non-Hispanic.
 ¶¶ Includes residents only.
 
*** Percentage is based on 480,689 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for ethnicity.
 ††† Number of abortions obtained by women in a given ethnic group per 1,000 women in that same group. For each reporting area, abortions for women of unknown 
ethnicity were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known ethnicity for that area.
 
§§§ Number of abortions obtained by women in a given ethnic group per 1,000 live births to women in that same ethnic group. For each reporting area, abortions 
for women of unknown ethnicity were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known ethnicity for that area.

 * Data from 40 reporting areas; excludes 12 areas (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York 
State, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by the number of previous induced abortions, or did not meet reporting standards.
 † Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 § Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known number of previous induced abortions divided by the sum of abortions reported by known 
and unknown number of previous induced abortions.
 ¶ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information could 
not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ** Percentage is based on 464,662 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for the number of previous abortions.

 * Data from 36 reporting areas; excludes 16 areas (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New York State, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by method type or gestational age, did not 
meet reporting standards, or did not have medical abortion as a specific category on their reporting form.
 † For each gestational age category, percentages of all method types might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 § Includes aspiration curettage, suction curettage, manual vacuum aspiration, menstrual extraction, sharp curettage, and dilation and evacuation procedures.
 ¶ The administration of medication or medications to induce an abortion; at ≤8 weeks’ gestation, typically involves the use of mifepristone and misoprostol; at 
>8 weeks’ gestation, typically involves the use of vaginal prostaglandins. 
 ** Intrauterine instillations reported at ≤12 weeks’ gestation have not been included with known values.

 * Number of legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced abortions. Because a substantial number of 
legal induced abortions occurred outside reporting areas that provided data to CDC, national case-fatality rates (i.e., number of 
legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced abortions in the United States) were calculated with 
denominator data from a more complete source (51,74). Case-fatality rates were computed for consecutive 5-year periods during 
1973–2007 and then for a consecutive 6-year period during 2008–2013 because rates based on <20 cases are highly variable (41).
 † Certain numbers might differ from those in reports published previously because additional information has been 
supplied to CDC subsequent to publication (50,74).
 § An abortion is defined as legal if it was performed by a licensed clinician within the limits of state law.
 ¶ An abortion is defined as illegal if it was performed by any person other than a licensed clinician.
 ** Unknown whether abortion was induced or spontaneous.
