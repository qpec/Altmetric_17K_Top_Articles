Abstract
Importance—Most cognitive functions decline with age. Prior studies suggest that testosterone 
treatment may improve these functions.
Objective—To determine if testosterone treatment compared with placebo is associated with 
improved verbal memory and other cognitive functions in older men with low testosterone and 
age-associated memory impairment (AAMI).
Design, Setting, and Participants—The Testosterone Trials (TTrials) were 7 trials to assess 
the efficacy of testosterone treatment in older men with low testosterone levels. The Cognitive 
Function Trial evaluated cognitive function in all TTrials participants. In 12 US academic medical 
centers, 788 men who were 65 years or older with a serum testosterone level less than 275 ng/mL 
and impaired sexual function, physical function, or vitality were allocated to testosterone treatment 
(n = 394) or placebo (n = 394). A subgroup of 493 men met criteria for AAMI based on baseline 
subjective memory complaints and objective memory performance. Enrollment in the TTrials 
began June 24, 2010; the final participant completed treatment and assessment in June 2014.
Interventions—Testosterone gel (adjusted to maintain the testosterone level within the normal 
range for young men) or placebo gel for 1 year.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 
6 months and 12 months for delayed paragraph recall (score range, 0 to 50) among men with 
AAMI. Secondary outcomes were mean changes in visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test; 
score range, 0 to −26), executive function (Trail-Making Test B minus A; range, −290 to 290), and

 spatial ability (Card Rotation Test; score range, −80 to 80) among men with AAMI. Tests were 
administered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
Results—Among the 493 men with AAMI (mean age, 72.3 years [SD, 5.8]; mean baseline 
testosterone, 234 ng/dL [SD, 65.1]), 247 were assigned to receive testosterone and 246 to receive 
placebo. Of these groups, 247 men in the testosterone group and 245 men in the placebo 
completed the memory study. There was no significant mean change from baseline to 6 and 12 
months in delayed paragraph recall score among men with AAMI in the testosterone and placebo 
groups (adjusted estimated difference, −0.07 [95% CI, −0.92 to 0.79]; P = .88). Mean scores for 
delayed paragraph recall were 14.0 at baseline, 16.0 at 6 months, and 16.2 at 12 months in the 
testosterone group and 14.4 at baseline, 16.0 at 6 months, and 16.5 at 12 months in the placebo 
group. Testosterone was also not associated with significant differences in visual memory (−0.28 
[95% CI, −0.76 to 0.19]; P = .24), executive function (−5.51 [95% CI, −12.91 to 1.88]; P = .14), or 
spatial ability (−0.12 [95% CI, −1.89 to 1.65]; P = .89).
Conclusions and Relevance—Among older men with low testosterone and age-associated 
memory impairment, treatment with testosterone for 1 year compared with placebo was not 
associated with improved memory or other cognitive functions.
Aging is associated with declines in some cognitive functions, including verbal and visual 
memory, executive function, and spatial ability.1-3 Aging in men is also associated with a 
reduction in serum testosterone,4,5 raising the possibility that reduced circulating 
testosterone concentration may contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Support for this 
hypothesis comes from studies of clinical conditions that cause low testosterone levels,6,7 
epidemiological investigations,8,9 and small randomized trials showing improved memory 
with testosterone supplementation.10 Together, these studies suggest that lower testosterone 
levels may be associated with poorer cognitive functioning in older men and that 
testosterone treatment may improve cognitive functioning, especially memory.
An Institute of Medicine panel11 recommended investigating the effects of testosterone 
treatment on conditions, including cognitive impairment, that might be caused by the 
decrease in testosterone. Men with age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) represent a 
clinically important group at risk for developing more severe memory impairment (eg, mild 
cognitive impairment and dementia)12 for whom testosterone intervention may be beneficial. 
AAMI is defined by subjective complaints of memory decline and scores at least 1 SD 
below the mean for young adults on objective memory testing.13 A large percentage of 
community-dwelling older adults meets these criteria.14
The Cognitive Function Trial determined the efficacy of testosterone treatment on cognitive 
outcomes among older men enrolled in the Testosterone Trials (TTrials) with low 
testosterone likely due to age.15 The primary hypothesis of the Cognitive Function Trial was 
that testosterone treatment for 1 year would improve or slow decline in verbal memory in the 
subgroup of men 65 years or older with an average testosterone level of less than 275 ng/dL 
and AAMI. Secondary aims were to determine if testosterone treatment affects other 
cognitive functions in these men with AAMI, and exploratory aims were to determine the 
effect of testosterone treatment on cognitive function in all men in the TTrials.

 Methods
Study Design
The TTrials are a coordinated set of 7 double-blind, placebocontrolled trials conducted at 12 
US academic medical centers.15 To qualify for the TTrials, participants had to qualify for the 
Sexual Function Trial, the Physical Function Trial, or the Vitality Trial.16 Cognitive tests 
were administered to all participants, but the Cognitive Function Trial's primary focus was 
the subgroup of men with AAMI.
The trial protocol (Supplement 1) and consent form were approved by the institutional 
review boards of the University of Pennsylvania and all trial sites. All participants provided 
written, informed consent. An unblinded data and safety monitoring board monitored 
accumulating safety data every 3 months.
Participants
Participants for the TTrials were recruited and screened as described.16 Respondents were 
screened first by telephone and then at 2 clinic visits. Inclusion criteria for the TTrials 
overall were 65 years or older and the mean of 2 morning serum testosterone concentrations 
less than 275 ng/dL (to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 0.0347). Additionally, inclusion in 
the Sexual Function Trial required self-reported decreased libido and sexual activity, 
inclusion in the Physical Function Trial required self-reported difficulty walking or climbing 
stairs and low gait speed, and inclusion in the Vitality Trial required self-reported fatigue 
and reduced vitality.16 Exclusion criteria included a recent history or evidence of increased 
risk of conditions that testosterone might exacerbate, cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental 
State Examination score <24), and severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
[PHQ-9] score ≥20) (eAppendix in Supplement 2).17
Men were classified as having AAMI if they had both subjective memory complaints and 
relative impairment on objective tests of memory performance. Subjective memory 
complaints were indicated by a score of 4 or 5 on at least 1 item of the Memory Assessment 
Clinics Questionnaire (MAC-Q).18 Objective memory impairment was defined by a score 
more than 1 SD below the performance for young men (aged 20-24 years) but not greater 
than 2 SD below the scores of age-matched men on tests of delayed paragraph recall or 
visual memory. Men were “normal for age” if they did not meet criteria for AAMI and had 
scores of 80 or more on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) measure of 
global cognitive function. Demographic characteristics including self-reported race (white, 
African American, or other) and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) were collected 
because there are race differences in genetic risk factors for some conditions that affect 
cognitive function.
Treatment
In the TTrials overall, participants were allocated to treatment by minimization, with 
participants assigned to the optimally balanced treatment with 80% probability.19,20 
Balancing variables included participation in each of the 3 main trials of the TTrials (Sexual 
Function Trial, Physical Function Trial, or Vitality Trial), trial site, screening testosterone

 concentration (≤200 ng/dL or >200 ng/dL), age (≤75 years or >75 years), and use of 
antidepressants and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. AAMI was not included as 
a balancing factor.
The testosterone gel was 1% concentration in a pump bottle (AndroGel, AbbVie). The initial 
dose was 5 g daily. The placebo gel was similar in appearance, smell, and consistency. 
Serum testosterone concentration was measured at month 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 in a central 
laboratory (Quest Clinical Trials, Valencia, California). The dose of testosterone gel was 
adjusted by an unblinded staff person at the University of Pennsylvania data coordinating 
center following a prespecified algorithm after each measurement to keep the concentration 
within the mid-normal range for young men (500-800 ng/dL). To maintain blinding when 
the dose was adjusted in a participant taking testosterone, the dose was changed 
simultaneously in a participant taking placebo gel.
Hormone Assessment
Serum concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and 
sex hormone–binding globulin were measured at the end of the trial in sera frozen at −80°C. 
Steroid assays were performed in the Brigham Research Assay Core Laboratory in Boston, 
Massachusetts, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy and free 
testosterone was measured by equilibrium dialysis.16 All samples from each participant were 
measured in the same assay run.
Trial Outcomes
The primary outcome was mean change from baseline to 6 months and to 12 months in 
delayed paragraph recall score among men with AAMI. Secondary outcomes were change 
from baseline in visual memory, executive function, and spatial ability among men with 
AAMI. Exploratory outcomes included change from baseline on these measures among all 
men enrolled in the TTrials, as well as change in global cognition, subjective memory 
complaints, and immediate paragraph recall. We also performed additional exploratory 
analyses of the subgroup of men who were normal for age (normal for age subgroup) 
because recent trials in Alzheimer disease suggest that treatments may be less effective in 
the presence of cognitive impairment and irreversible neuronal damage that may be present 
among men with AAMI.21
Cognitive Assessment
The methods for cognitive assessments are detailed in Supplement 2. The cognitive battery 
was administered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months and included measures of subjective 
memory complaints (MAC-Q); verbal memory by immediate paragraph recall (Wechsler 
Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory I) and delayed paragraph recall (Wechsler Memory 
Scale-Revised Logical Memory II); visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test [BVRT]; 
score range, 0 to −26)22; executive function (Trail-Making Test B minus A [TMT B − A]; 
range, −290 to 290); and spatial ability (Card Rotation Test; score range, −80 to 80). TMT B 
− A was used as an outcome because it provides a purer measure of executive function, 
adjusting for visuomotor speed and attention. Global cognitive function (3MSE) was 
assessed at baseline and 12 months. To minimize practice effects, 3 versions (A, B, and C)

 of Logical Memory, BVRT, and the Card Rotations Test were used in the test battery. All 
participants in the TTrials, regardless of AAMI status, were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 test 
battery orders for baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments (ABC, BCA, or CAB).
The Cognition Reading Center (CRC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine provided training, 
oversight, and quality control of cognitive testing following established procedures.23,24 
CRC and National Institute on Aging investigators conducted a centralized in-person 
training session of testers from the 12 clinic sites. Subsequently, testers audio-taped a 
practice administration and submitted it for CRC certification. Recertification was required 
every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter. During the trial, the CRC staff 
monitored the certified testers and assisted in training new testers. The CRC scored the 
cognitive measures and entered the data.
Statistical Analysis
Power Analysis—The statistical analytic plan is available in Supplement 1. Data from 
earlier studies of delayed paragraph recall showed testosterone-associated effect sizes 
ranging from 0.13 to 0.62.10,25 Based on our estimate of the proportion of men recruited 
who would meet the AAMI criteria, we determined that we would be able to detect an effect 
size of 0.3 (based on change from baseline to 12 months), corresponding to a 3-point 
difference between testosterone and placebo groups in change from baseline to 12 months in 
delayed paragraph recall. A 3-point difference is equivalent to a change in score from the 
50th percentile performance for a man aged 70 to 74 years to that of a man aged 45 to 54 
years.26
Data Analysis—Participants were analyzed in the treatment group to which they had been 
allocated, following the intention-to-treat principle. Primary analyses of outcomes from all 
time points were performed with mixed-effects models for longitudinal data. Models entered 
visit time (6 months or 12 months) as a categorical variable. Models initially included a 
main effect of treatment and treatment by visit interaction, but interaction terms were 
removed if they did not achieve statistical significance at the .05 level. Additional fixed 
effects were the baseline value for each outcome, balancing variables, and PHQ-9 depressive 
symptom score. Random intercepts were included for participants. After removing the 
treatment by visit interaction (nonsignificant for all cognitive outcomes), the estimated 
difference denotes the difference in the mean change from baseline to 6 months and to 12 
months between treatment groups. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided and conducted at an α 
level of .05. We did not adjust analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes for multiple 
comparisons because the correlations among outcomes were expected to be high, making 
such adjustment excessively conservative. Mixed-effects models provide unbiased estimates 
of estimated differences under the assumption of data missing at random, meaning that 
missingness is associated at most with observed data and not unobserved responses. No 
additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of missing data on 
results given the small amount of missingness and nature of the results. We used the same 
statistical approach for analysis of outcomes for AAMI, all men, and the normal for age 
subgroup.

 We also investigated whether the potential association between testosterone treatment and 
cognitive function was related to baseline testosterone levels (continuous variable) and to 
baseline global cognitive function (baseline 3MSE score groups: <90, 90-94, 95-100). All 
analyses were performed in SAS (SAS Institute), version 9.4.
Results
Participants
Recruitment began in June 2010, and planned accrual was completed in June 2013. 
Treatment was completed in June 2014. Of 788 men enrolled in the TTrials, 493 men 
(62.6%) met the criteria for AAMI, 247 in the testosterone group and 246 in the placebo 
group (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics by treatment group for men with AAMI and all 
men are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 and those for the normal for age subgroup are in 
eTable 2 in Supplement 2. In the AAMI group, placebo and testosterone treatment groups 
did not differ at baseline in most demographic and medical characteristics or in sex hormone 
levels or cognitive performance. Among all men enrolled in the TTrials, executive function 
performance at baseline was slightly better among those assigned to placebo than those 
assigned to testosterone.
Adherence and Hormone Levels
Adherence to treatment in the TTrials was assessed by weighing gel bottles at each visit and 
was judged as excellent (mean adherence >92% at each site). Testosterone treatment 
increased the serum concentrations of total and free testosterone and estradiol in men with 
AAMI (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2) and in all men16 to levels in the mid-normal range for 
healthy young men aged 19 to 40 years. These levels were unchanged in men receiving 
placebo.
Primary Outcome Analysis
Among men with AAMI, testosterone treatment compared with placebo was not associated 
with significant differences in the mean change from baseline to month 6 and to month 12 in 
delayed paragraph recall (adjusted estimated difference, −0.07 [95% CI, −0.92 to 0.79]; P = .
88) (Table 3 and Figure 2). Mean delayed paragraph recall scores (score range, 0 to 50) were 
14.0 at baseline, 16.0 at month 6, and 16.2 at month 12 in the testosterone group and 14.4 at 
baseline, 16.2 at month 6, and 16.5 at month 12 in the placebo group. The difference in 
mean change between treatment groups did not vary significantly by visit month. Analyses 
evaluating whether the association of testosterone treatment with memory and cognitive 
function varied by baseline testosterone level and by baseline global cognition yielded 
similar results.
Secondary Outcome Analyses
Among men with AAMI, there was no significant association between testosterone 
treatment and mean change from baseline to month 6 and month 12 in visual memory 
(adjusted estimated difference, −0.28 [95% CI, −0.76 to 0.19]; P = .24), executive function 
(adjusted estimated difference, −5.51 [95% CI, −12.91 to 1.88]; P = .14), or spatial ability 
(adjusted estimated difference, −0.12 [95% CI, −1.89 to 1.65]; P = .89) (Table 3 and Figure

 2). Mean scores for visual memory were −8.2 at baseline, −7.7 at 6 months, and −7.7 at 12 
months in the testosterone group and −8.2 at baseline, −7.7 at 6 months, and −7.3 at 12 
months in the placebo group. Mean scores for spatial ability were 28.7 at baseline, 30.8 at 6 
months, and 31.1 at 12 months in the testosterone group and 30.0 at baseline, 31.6 at 6 
months, and 32.4 at 12 months in the placebo group. Mean scores for executive function 
were 86.4 at baseline, 74.5 at 6 months, 76.0 at 12 months in the testosterone group and 76.7 
at baseline, 74.3 at 6 months, and 78.5 at 12 months in the placebo group.
Exploratory Outcome Analyses
Among all men in the TTrials (with and without AAMI), there were also no significant 
associations of testosterone treatment with mean change from baseline to month 6 and 
month 12 in delayed paragraph recall (adjusted estimated difference, 0.09 [95% CI, −0.57 to 
0.75]; P = .80), visual memory (adjusted estimated difference, −0.34 [95% CI, −0.70 to 
0.01]; P = .06), or spatial ability (adjusted estimated difference, −0.08 [95% CI, −1.44 to 
1.28]; P = .91) (Table 4). Mean scores among all men for delayed paragraph recall were 15.3 
at baseline, 17.3 at 6 months, and 17.6 at 12 months in the testosterone group and 15.7 at 
baseline, 17.3 at 6 months, and 17.5 at 12 months in the placebo group. Mean scores among 
all men for visual memory were −7.5 at baseline, −7.3 at 6 months, and −7.1 at 12 months in 
the testosterone group and −7.3 at baseline, −7.1 at 6 months, and −6.6 at 12 months in the 
placebo group. Mean scores among all men for spatial ability were 29.7 at baseline, 31.8 at 6 
months, and 32.7 at 12 months in the testosterone group and 31.4 at baseline, 33.0 at 6 
months, and 34.0 at 12 months in the placebo group. In all men, executive function showed a 
small improvement in the testosterone group compared with the placebo group (adjusted 
estimated difference, −5.68 [95% CI, −11.18 to −0.17]; P = .04). Mean scores among all 
men for executive function were 83.1 at baseline, 69.2 at 6 months, and 70.5 at 12 months in 
the testosterone group and 73.3 at baseline, 70.6 at 6 months, and 72.9 at 12 months in the 
placebo group.
Testosterone and placebo groups did not differ significantly in any of the exploratory 
outcomes of immediate paragraph recall, subjective memory complaints, and global 
cognitive function (AAMI shown in Table 2, all men shown in Table 3). There was no 
significant association of testosterone treatment with any cognitive outcomes for the normal 
for age subgroup (eTable 3 and eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Adverse Events
Among all TTrials participants, men treated with testosterone compared with placebo were 
more likely to experience erythrocytosis (hemoglobin level, ≥17.5 g/dL), but the 2 groups 
did not differ in other adverse events, as previously reported.16
Discussion
Among older men with symptomatic hypogonadism and low baseline testosterone, 
testosterone treatment compared with placebo for 1 year was not associated with significant 
improvement in memory and other cognitive functions. The lack of association between 
testosterone treatment and cognition was apparent across all cognitive domains assessed

 among men with AAMI, in spite of an increase in circulating total and free testosterone 
concentrations in the testosterone group to levels typical of men aged 19 to 40 years.16
Verbal memory by delayed paragraph recall performance among men with AAMI was 
selected a priori as the primary outcome based on prior findings in small clinical trials and 
its clinical importance. Verbal memory declines with age,1-3 and the decline is accelerated in 
the years preceding clinical dementia, including Alzheimer disease.26-28 Delayed paragraph 
recall performance requires integrity of the hippocampus, which contains both androgen and 
estrogen receptors, providing a biological basis for the actions of testosterone or its active 
metabolite, estradiol.29-31 In addition, verbal memory has been associated with circulating 
testosterone levels in epidemiologic studies of aging men,8,32,33 may be impaired with 
androgen deprivation,6,7,34 and has shown improvement after testosterone treatment in some 
previous short-term trials among older men.10,35
Cognitive assessments were performed among all men in the TTrials, although the principal 
analyses focused on the subgroup of men who met criteria for AAMI, which defined a 
sample of men with subjective symptoms of memory decline and objective reductions in 
memory performance. Testosterone-treated men did show a small increase in executive 
function with the increased statistical power in all men combined but no other outcomes; it 
is difficult to interpret this difference in a single exploratory outcome given the multiple 
outcomes assessed. We found no significant association between testosterone treatment and 
memory or other cognitive function in the normal for age subgroup.
In spite of previously reported associations between testosterone and verbal memory, the 
results of this Cognitive Function Trial offers no support for a benefit to memory and little or 
no support for a benefit to other cognitive functions in older hypogonadal men. It is possible 
that the mode of treatment and participant characteristics might have contributed to 
differences between the current findings and those reported previously. Some prior studies 
used doses of injectable testosterone preparations that cause supraphysiological peak and 
higher average testosterone levels over time than in our study of testosterone gels. 
Testosterone gels provide more stable physiological levels. Effects of injectable testosterone 
may reflect acutely changing testosterone levels, depending on timing of cognitive testing 
relative to testosterone peaks and troughs. However, our findings are consistent with the lack 
of significant cognitive effects in a smaller, but longer-term (36 months), placebo-controlled 
trial of biweekly intramuscular testosterone injections in older men.36 Another difference 
between men enrolled in the TTrials and those studied in many prior trials was the selection 
of men with subjective memory complaints and unequivocally low baseline testosterone 
levels.
The Cognitive Function Trial of the TTrials is, to our knowledge, the largest placebo-
controlled study conducted to date of testosterone effects on cognition in older men with low 
testosterone levels. The trial addresses limitations of prior studies including small sample 
sizes, variability in baseline testosterone levels and cognitive function of participants, 
variability in dose and duration of testosterone treatment, and sensitivity of the cognitive 
outcome measures to hormone action and practice effects. The Cognitive Function Trial had 
more than 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful increase in verbal memory

 performance, although it was not powered to detect very small effects, and was conducted in 
older men who had unequivocally low testosterone and well-defined cognitive function at 
baseline. The testosterone treatment increased circulating total and free testosterone and 
estradiol levels to within the normal ranges for young men. The Cognitive Function Trial 
included assessment of a range of cognitive functions, including verbal and visual memory, 
spatial ability, and executive function, with alternate forms and randomized test orders to 
minimize practice effects with repeated use of the same test. The cognitive domains and 
specific measures were selected based on prior studies showing associations with circulating 
testosterone in observational studies8,9,32,33 as well as beneficial effects of testosterone on 
memory function in small randomized trials of younger and older men.10,35,37 The 
procedures for cognitive assessment and scoring were rigorous and followed established 
procedures for centralized training, certification, and scoring.23,24 One year of testosterone 
treatment had no or little effect on cognition.
This study had several limitations. First, AAMI status was not a balancing factor in 
treatment allocation, although the 2 treatment groups did not differ with respect to baseline 
demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, or cognitive performance. Second, the 
participants in this study were older men with symptomatic hypogonadism and 
unequivocally low baseline testosterone with no known cause other than aging, so the 
findings may not generalize to other populations, such as men with normal testosterone or 
older or younger men, or men with more severe androgen deficiency due to testicular or 
pituitary disease. Third, it is possible that a longer treatment duration could yield a different 
result.
Conclusions
Among older men with low testosterone and AAMI, testosterone treatment for 1 year was 
not associated with improved memory or other cognitive functions.

 Key Points
Question Is treatment with testosterone for 1 year associated with improved memory in 
older men with low testosterone and age-associated memory impairment?
Findings In this placebo-controlled study of 788 older men with symptomatic 
hypogonadism, 493 had age-associated memory impairment, defined by subjective 
memory complaints and impaired performance on tests of verbal and visual memory. 
Compared with placebo, 1 year of testosterone treatment was not significantly associated 
with improved memory or other cognitive functions in these men.
Meaning This study does not support the use of testosterone for the treatment of age-
associated memory decline in older men with symptomatic hypogonadism.

Recall), Visual Memory, Executive Function, and Spatial Ability
AAMI indicates age-associated memory impairment. Error bars indicate 95% CIs. The score 
range for the delayed paragraph recall test (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical 
Memory II) was 0 to 50. Benton Visual Retention Test scores could range from 0 to 26 but 
were inverted to −26 to 0 so that higher scores indicated better performance. Possible scores 
for the Trail-Making Test B minus A range from −290 to 290. The range of possible scores 
for the Card Rotation Test was −80 to 80. Some participants completed the Delayed 
Paragraph Recall Test at baseline but not the secondary assessments.

dDelayed paragraph recall was measured with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory II test.
eBVRT error scores were inverted so that higher scores reflect better performance for all cognitive outcomes, except Trail-Making Test A, B, and B 
− A wherein higher time in seconds reflects poorer performance.
fThe only significant difference between testosterone and placebo groups was Trail-Making Test B and Trail-Making Test B − A, wherein scores 
were better in the placebo than testosterone group for all men (P < .05).

aBVRT error scores were inverted so that higher scores reflect better cognitive function except for Trail-Making Test B minusAand MAC-Q scores wherein lower scores indicate better cognitive function.
bPositive values indicate greater increase or less decrease for participants allocated to testosterone vs placebo. Variables included for adjustment are listed in footnote c.
cThe difference is the mean difference in the change from baseline to 6 months and 12 months in participants allocated to testosterone vs placebo adjusted for balancing factors: baseline testosterone level 
(≤200ng/dL), age(≤75), site, participation in main trials, use of antidepressants, and use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Analyses were also adjusted for education level. A positive estimated 
difference indicates greater increases, smaller decreases, or both for the testosterone group compared with the placebo group.
dThe estimated difference and P value were determined by a linear mixed-model with a random effect for participants using outcomes at month 6 and month 12.
