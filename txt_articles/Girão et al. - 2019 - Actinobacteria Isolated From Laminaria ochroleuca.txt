Nature is the major reservoir of biologically active molecules. The urgent need of
fi
nding novel molecules for pharmaceutical application is prompting the research
of underexplored environments, such as marine ecosystems. Here, we investigated
cultivable actinobacteria associated with the macroalgae Laminaria ochroleuca and
assessed their potential to produce compounds with antimicrobial or anticancer
activities. A specimen of L. ochroleuca was collected in a rocky shore in northern
Portugal, and fragments of tissues from different parts of the macroalgae (holdfast,
stipe, and blades) were surface sterilized and plated in three culture media selective
for actinobacteria. A total of 90 actinobacterial strains were isolated, most of which
affi
liated with the genus Streptomyces. Isolates associated with the genera Isoptericola,
Rhodococcus, Nonomuraeae, Nocardiopsis, Microbispora, and Microbacterium were
also obtained. Organic extracts from the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial
activity using the agar-based disk diffusion method, followed by determination of
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Forty-fi
ve isolates inhibited the growth
of Candida albicans and/or Staphylococcus aureus, with MIC values ranging from <0.5
to 1000 µg mL−1. The actinobacterial isolates were also tested for their anticancer
potential on two human cancer cell lines. Twenty-eight extracts affected the viability of at
least one human cancer cell line (breast carcinoma T-47D and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y)
and non-carcinogenic endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3). Seven extracts affected the
viability of cancer cells only. This study revealed that L. ochroleuca is a rich source
of actinobacteria with promising antimicrobial and anticancer activities and suggests
that macroalgae may be a valuable source of actinobacteria and, consequently, of new
molecules with biotechnological importance.

INTRODUCTION
Natural products (NP) play an important role in several sectors of our society. These compounds
are valuable from industrial, biotechnological and pharmacological perspectives. They have been
instrumental in combating diverse human diseases, such as cancer and bacterial infections (Harvey,
2008). From 1940 to 2014, about half of the approved drugs for use in cancer therapy were either

Bioactivity in Kelp-Associated Actinobacteria
NP or NP-inspired or -derived compounds (Newman and
Cragg, 2016). Microorganisms produce a wide diversity of
NP that translates in a wide bioactivity range (Berdy, 2005).
This is particularly noteworthy for the phylum Actinobacteria,
and more so in the homonym class, commonly known as
actinomycetes and hereafter referred to as actinobacteria.
In
fact,
bioactivities
reported
from
actinobacterial
NP
include antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor, anticancer, anti-
inflammatory, antiviral, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive
activities (Dharmaraj, 2010; Manivasagan et al., 2014; ul Hassan
and Shaikh, 2017). So far, more than 10,000 different bioactive
molecules have been reported from actinobacteria, representing
nearly 45% of the bioactive microbial metabolites currently
known, the majority of which having been isolated from
the genus Streptomyces (Berdy, 2005; Azman et al., 2017).
For this reason, in the last decades, multiple NP discovery
efforts have focused on actinobacteria, especially those from
terrestrial sources. However, the discovery of novel compounds
from terrestrial actinobacteria is reaching a stagnation point,
impelling the scientific community to look for new chemical
diversity in much less explored environments, such as marine
ecosystems (Bhatnagar and Kim, 2010). Marine actinobacteria
possess unique physiological adaptations to conditions very
distinct from those in terrestrial environments, namely in
terms of pressure, salinity and temperature (Undabarrena et al.,
2016). These adaptations are also reflected in a differentiated
secondary metabolome (Abdelmohsen et al., 2015). Two notable
illustrations of the potential of marine actinobacteria to produce
novel lead drugs are salinosporamide A, produced by the
marine actinobacteria Salinospora tropica, now in clinical trials
to treat patients with multiple myeloma, solid tumors, and
lymphoma (Pérez and Fenical, 2017), and abyssomicin C,
isolated from a marine Verrucosispora, exhibiting antibacterial
activity
against
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
(MRSA) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Bister et al., 2004;
Freundlich et al., 2010).
Actinobacteria
are
widely
distributed
in
the
marine
environment, in particular in sediments, but they also exist
in association with a number of marine organisms, such as fishes,
sponges, macroalgae, corals, and tunicates (Abdelmohsen et al.,
2014). Endophytic microorganisms live in the inner tissues of
plants and algae without causing negative damages to the host
(Petrini, 1991). During this symbiotic association, endophytes
produce secondary metabolites that improve the fitness of
the host and its resistance against environmental stressors,
obtaining in return nutrients and shelter from their host (Dinesh
et al., 2017). Macroalgae are known to host diverse species of
actinobacteria, both epiphytic and endophytic, but little has been
done to assess their biotechnological potential, with the majority
of the bioactivity screenings targeting epiphytic microorganisms,
mainly fungi (Egan et al., 2008). Nevertheless, some studies
demonstrated that actinobacteria isolated from macroalgae
are capable of producing bioactive compounds, including
antibiotics,
antitumor,
and
anti-inflammatory
compounds
(Braña et al., 2015; Uzair et al., 2018).The brown alga Laminaria
ochroleuca forms complex structures, known as kelp forests,
which dominate shallow rocky shores of cold-water marine
habitats worldwide (Franco et al., 2018). Kelp forests are
among the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the
world (Steneck et al., 2002). L. ochroleuca is an abundant and
ecologically-important species of macroalga (Franco et al.,
2018), but its associated actinobacterial diversity was hitherto
uncharacterized. Here, we isolated culturable actinobacteria
from L. ochroleuca, and investigated their antimicrobial and
anticancer potential.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling and Bacterial Isolation
One specimen of L. ochroleuca was collected in the intertidal
area of the rocky shore at Mindelo, located in northern Portugal
(41.309298◦; −8.742228◦). The alga was transported to the
laboratory under refrigeration and processed on the same day.
The collected specimen was washed with sterile sea water and
segmented into three distinct parts: holdfast, stipe and blades.
Each part was cut into approximately 2 cm long pieces that were
incubated in a cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer
solution (diluted 1:100) containing proteinase K (20 mg mL−1)
for 30 min at 60◦C, and washed for three consecutive times with
sterile sea water for 1 min (Hollants et al., 2010). The effectiveness
of the surface sterilization was evaluated by plating the final wash
water and sterilized pieces from each part of the algae on Plate
Count Agar (PCA) (Liofilchem, Roseto d. Abruzzi, Italy). Algae
pieces were ground and inoculated on selective culture media,
namely Starch-Casein-Nitrate agar (SCN: 10 g of soluble starch,
0.3 g of casein, 2 g of K2HPO4, 2 g of KNO3, 2 g of NaCl,
0.05 g of MgSO4.7H2O, 0.02 g of CaCO3, 0.01 g of FeSO4.7H2O,
and 17 g of agar, per liter of distilled water), Raffinose-Histidine
agar (RH: 10 g of raffinose, 1 g of L-Histidine, 1 g of K2HPO4,
0.5 g of MgSO4.7H2O, 0.01 g of FeSO4.7H2O, and 17 g of
agar, per liter of distilled water) and Nutrient-Poor Sediment
Extract agar (NPS: 100 mL of marine sediment extract obtained
by washing 900 mL of sediments with 500 mL of seawater and
17 g of agar, per liter of seawater). The culture media were
supplemented with cycloheximide (50 mg L−1; Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, United States) and nalidixic acid (50 mg L−1; AppliChem,
Darmstadt, Germany) to inhibit the growth of fungi and Gram-
negative bacteria, respectively. The plates were incubated at 28◦C
for a period of up to 6 weeks. Morphologically distinct colonies
were isolated and preserved at −80◦C in 30% (v/v) of glycerol.
The colonies were named using the “
K”code, indicative of kelp,
“
EN”indicative of endophyte, and “
R”
, “
B”
, and “
S”for colonies
isolated from the holdfast (rhizoid), blade, and stipe fragments,
respectively (Supplementary Table S1).
Taxonomic Identification of the
Obtained Isolates
All isolates were taxonomically identified through 16S rRNA
gene sequencing. For each isolate, genomic DNA was extracted
using the E.Z.N.A.
R
� Bacterial DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, GA,
United States) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions.
The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the universal
primers 27F (5�-GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3�) and 1492R

Bioactivity in Kelp-Associated Actinobacteria
(5�-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3�)
(Stackebrandt
and
Goodfellow, 1991; Weisburg et al., 1991). The PCR mixture (final
volume of 10 µL) consisted of: 5 µL of Qiagen Multiplex PCR
Master Mix (Qiagen, CA, United States), 1 µL of each primer
(2 µM), 2 µL of DNA template and 1 µL of nuclease-free water.
The reaction was started with an initial denaturation at 95◦C for
15 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94◦C for 30 s,
annealing at 48◦C for 90 s and extension at 72◦C for 90 s, and a
final extension at 72◦C for 10 min. PCR products were separated
on a 1.4% agarose gel containing SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, United States). PCR products were purified with
ExoSAP-IT (TM) Express (Applied Biosystems, Warrington,
United Kingdom), a one-step enzymatic treatment to eliminate
unincorporated primers and dNTPs, according to manufacturer’
s
recommendations. Sequencing of purified samples (2.5 µL) was
performed in a Genetic Analyzer 3130xl sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom), according to the
manufacturer’
s recommendations. The obtained 16S rDNA
sequences were analyzed using the Geneious software, version
11.1.4. (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). The taxonomic
affiliation of the isolates was established using the 16S ribosomal
RNA (Bacteria and Archaea) database from NCBI BLAST tool1
and confirmed using the identify tool from EzTaxon2 and the
sequence match tool from the Ribosomal Database Project3. To
complement the taxonomic study of the isolates, a phylogenetic
tree was elaborated. According to BLAST results, the closest
neighbor sequences in GenBank for each isolate were selected,
with no more than a single sequence being selected for the same
species. A total of 182 sequences that fulfilled these criteria were
retrieved for all isolates and these were aligned using MUSCLE
from within the Geneious software package. The phylogenic tree
was then constructed from this alignment, using the Maximum
Likelihood method with 1000 bootstraps based on the Tamura-
Nei model. Strains KENR90, 91 and 92 were not included in the
tree since their nucleotide sequences were too short (590, 617,
and 833 bp, respectively). The tree was constructed using the
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis program Version 7.0
(MEGA7) (Kumar et al., 2016).
Preparation of Crude Extracts for
Bioactivity Assays
Each actinobacterial isolate was grown in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer
flask containing 30 mL of liquid culture medium with a
composition identical to the solid medium from which the isolate
was obtained, but without the addition of cycloheximide and
nalidixic acid. The flasks were incubated at 28◦C, 100 rpm, in
the dark. After 4 days of incubation, 0.5 g of Amberlite XAD16N
resin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, United States) were added to the
culture medium and incubation continued for three additional
days. Each culture was extracted together with the resin by
adding 30 mL of a solution of acetone/methanol 1:1 (v/v). The
organic layer was recovered and dried in a rotary evaporator
to yield an organic extract that was weighted before being

dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (≥99.9%, DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, United States) to prepare stock solutions of 10, 3.0, and
1.0 mg mL−1, which were used for the bioactivity assays.
Screening of Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activity of the crude extracts obtained from
the actinobacterial isolates was tested against five reference
microorganisms - Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Bacillus subtilis
(ATCC 6633), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Salmonella
typhimurium (ATCC 25241), and Candida albicans (ATCC
10231) – using the agar-based disk diffusion method (Balouiri
et al., 2016). The bacterial strains were grown in Mueller-Hinton
agar (MH) and C. albicans in Sabouraud Dextrose agar (SD)
(Liofilchem, Roseto d. Abruzzi, Italy). For the bioassay, reference
microorganisms were suspended in the corresponding liquid
medium and their turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland
standard (OD625 = 0.08-0.13). The suspensions were used to
inoculate agar plates (MH or SD, according to the reference
microorganism) by evenly streaking the plates with a swab dipped
in the suspension. Blank paper disks (6 mm in diameter) were
placed on the surface of the inoculated medium and 15 µL
of each actinobacterial crude extract (1000 µg mL−1) were
loaded into the disks. Positive control disks were inoculated
with 15 µL of enrofloxacin (1000 µg mL−1; Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, United States) for the bacterial strains, and 15 µL of
nystatin (1000 µg mL−1; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, United States) for
C. albicans, while negative control disks were inoculated with
15 µL of DMSO. One replica of each extract was tested in two
independent experiments. Antimicrobial activity was determined
by measuring the diameter of the inhibition halo formed around
each disk after 24 h of incubation at 37◦C. For extracts exhibiting
antimicrobial activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) was also determined. In the context of this study, MIC
is defined as the lowest extract concentration that completely
inhibits growth of a test microorganism. For MIC determination,
inoculum suspensions of the reference strains were prepared
as mentioned above. For each extract, stock solutions at
1000 µg mL−1 were prepared in the appropriate culture medium.
Two-fold dilutions in the same medium were sequentially
obtained from these stocks, resulting in extracts solutions with
concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.5 µg mL−1. The assay was
conducted in 96 well plates by adding 50 µL of the microbial
inoculum (diluted 1:100) and 50 µL of each extract dilution
to each well. The MIC was determined by spectrophotometric
analysis (625 nm; model V-1200, VWR, PA, United States), after
18 h of incubation at 37◦C. The positive growth control consisted
in 50 µL of microbial inoculum and 50 µL of medium broth and
the negative growth control in 100 µL of medium broth. For each
extract, MIC was determined in triplicate and two independent
experiments were performed.
Screening of Anticancer Activity
T-47D cells (breast ductal carcinoma) were grown in Dulbecco’
s

Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and SH-SY5Y cells

Bioactivity in Kelp-Associated Actinobacteria
(Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 mg L−1
streptomycin), 100 IU mL−1 penicillin (Biochrom, Berlin,
Germany) and 0.1% (v/v) amphotericin (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, United Kingdom), at 37◦C in an incubator with 5%
carbon dioxide. The anticancer activity of each actinobacterial
crude extract was tested in both human cancer cell lines using
the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
6.6 × 104 cells mL−1, allowed to adhere overnight and exposed
to the extracts (final concentration of 15 µg mL−1, 1:200 dilution
of 3 mg mL−1 stock solution) for 24 and 48 h. The positive
control consisted of 20% DMSO (a concentration known to
be toxic to the majority of cells within 24 h) and the solvent
control in 0.5% DMSO (same solvent concentration as crude
extracts). After 24 and 48 h of exposure, 20 µL of MTT (final
concentration: 0.2 mg mL−1; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, United States)
were added per well and the plates were incubated for an
additional period of 4 h at 37◦C. After this step, the culture
medium was removed from each well and 100 µL of DMSO
was added to the wells. The absorbance at 570 nm in each well
was determined in a multimode plate reader (model Synergy
HTX, Biotek, VT, United States). Two independent experiments
were performed for each cell line. In each experiment the extract
was tested in triplicate. Cellular viability was expressed as a
percentage relative to the solvent control. The extracts exhibiting
anticancer activity were additionally tested against a non-tumor
cell line (human brain capillary endothelial cells, hCMEC/D3,
kindly donated by Dr. P. O. Courad, INSERM, France) to
evaluate their general cytotoxicity, following the procedures
described above.

Bioactivity in Kelp-Associated Actinobacteria
Statistical Analysis
Data from anticancer assays (a total of six technical replicates)
was tested for significant differences compared to the solvent
control, and the significance level was set for all tests at p < 0.05.
The Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used to check for normality
distribution of data. For parametric data, one-Way ANOVA
was applied followed by Dunnett’
s post hoc test. If statistical
test assumptions were not met, data were either square root
transformed and re-tested by ANOVA, or the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was applied, followed by Dunn’
s multiple
comparison test.
Dereplication and Molecular
Network Analysis
A set of 35 extracts were selected from those exhibiting highest
activities (inhibition halos >1 cm in the antimicrobial assays
and/or those that were able to inhibit >70% of cell proliferation
compared to the solvent control in the cancer cell line cytotoxicity
assays). These extracts were resuspended in methanol at a
concentration of 2 mg mL−1 and used for LC-HRESIMS/MS
analysis on a system composed of a Dionex Ulimate 3000 HPLC
coupled to a qExactive Focus Mass spectrometer controlled
by XCalibur 4.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA,
United States). Ten microliters of each extract were injected
into an ACE UltraCore 2.5 Super C18 (75 mm × 2.1 mm)
column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies, Aberdeen,
United Kingdom). The separation was carried out using
a gradient from 99.5 to 10% water/methanol/formic acid
(95:5:0.1, v/v) to 0.5 to 90% isopropanol/methanol/formic
acid (95:5:0.1, v/v) for 9.5 min and held for 6 min before
returning to the initial conditions. The UV absorbance of
the eluate was monitored at 254 nm and a Full MS scan
at the resolution of 70,000 FWHM (range of 150–
2000 m/z),
and data dependent MS2 (ddMS2, Discovery mode) at the
resolution of 17,500 FWHM (isolation window used was
3.0 amu and normalized collision energy was 35). Raw data
files obtained from these analyses were converted to the
mzML format and used in the dereplication workflow of the
Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking platform
(GNPS) (Wang et al., 2016). Nine extracts resulted in no hits
in the dereplication analysis that could explain the observed
activities. These were submitted to the GNPS data analysis
workflow using default parameters (except ion mass tolerance
precursor, which was set to 0.01 Da and fragment ion mass
tolerance, which was set at 0.04 Da, to account for high-
resolution data). The resulting molecular network was visualized
with Cytoscape v3.6.1 (Shannon et al., 2003) and searched
for clusters of m/z data that were associated with a single
extract. The HRESIMS/MS spectra corresponding to such data
were annotated to clarify the likely masses of the compounds
generating the clusters. These putative compound masses were
used for an additional dereplication step by searching the
predicted accurate mass against the Dictionary of NP database
(version 27.1). When hits from Actinobacteria were obtained,
information regarding the biological activity of the compounds
was retrieved from this database.
RESULTS
Isolation and Identification of
Actinobacteria From L. ochroleuca
A total of 90 actinobacterial strains were isolated from
sterilized tissue fragments obtained from the holdfast, stipe,
and blades of L. ochroleuca (Figure 1A). Actinobacterial strains
were isolated from all parts of the macroalgae (Figure 1B)
and recovered from the three selective culture media used
(Figure 1C). Several strains presented typical characteristics
of actinobacteria, such as slow growth, formation of hyphae
and production of spores and pigments, the latter sometimes

as five isolates were recovered from the sterilization controls.
Two of such isolates, identified as Pseudomonas sp. and
Lysinibacillus sp., were obtained from a holdfast fragment, two
were obtained from the final wash water of a holdfast fragment
and identified as Bacillus sp. and Staphylococcus sp., and one
was derived from the final wash water of a blade fragment
and identified as Penicillium sp. Streptomyces, Isoptericola,
Rhodococcus, Nonomuraeae, Nocardiopsis, and Microbacterium
strains were isolated from the holdfast, Microbispora and
Microbacterium strains from the stipe, and Streptomyces and
Microbacterium strains from the blades (Figures 1A,B, 3). The
selective medium SCN allowed the retrieval of strains belonging
to all genera identified in this study (Figure 1C). Growth of

isolated actinobacterial strains was inferred from a 16S rRNA
gene phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Several of the isolated strains,
many of them affiliated with the genus Streptomyces, were found
to group very closely in a well-supported clade, which indicates a
high similarity between these strains.

Bioactivity in Kelp-Associated Actinobacteria
FIGURE 4 | The effect of extracts from actinobacterial strains isolated from L. ochroleuca on cellular viability. The effects on the viability of (A) breast carcinoma
T-47D and (B) neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y tumor cell lines, and (C) a non-tumor cell line (human brain capillary endothelial cells, hCMEC/D3) are shown after 24 and
48 h of exposure. Only the extracts with signifi
cant differences are shown on the graphs for SHSY-5Y and T47D cell lines. All of these extracts were re-tested on the
non-cancer cell line (C) for general cytotoxicity. PC and SC indicate positive and solvent controls, respectively. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
from two independent experiments performed in triplicates each, and signifi
cant differences compared to the solvent control are marked with asterisks in the
graphs (∗ = p < 0.05).
Antimicrobial and Anticancer Potential of
the Obtained Actinobacterial Isolates
Antimicrobial assays identified 45 isolates capable of inhibiting
the growth of C. albicans (n = 37), S. aureus (n = 3) or
both (n = 5). These isolates were affiliated with the genera
Streptomyces (39 strains), Isoptericola (one strain), Nonomuraeae
(one strain), Nocardiopsis (one strain), Microbispora (one strain),
and Microbacterium (two strains). The diameters of inhibition
halos varied from 0.7 to 2.5 cm (Supplementary Figure S1) and
the determined MIC values ranged between <0.5 and 1000 µg
mL−1 (Table 1). The MIC value was reproduced once. The lowest
antibacterial MIC value was determined for S. aureus (3.9 µg
mL−1) exposed to extracts of the Streptomyces strains KENR60
and 64, isolated from the holdfast. In turn, the lowest antifungal
MIC value (<0.5 µg mL−1 against C. albicans) was observed
for the crude extract of Streptomyces KENR25, also isolated
from the holdfast.
Twenty-eight isolates showed statistically significant cytotoxic
activity against at least one of the tested human cancer cell
lines compared to the solvent control. From these, 24 isolates
decreased the viability of SH-SY5Y cells, 15 decreased the viability
of T-47D cells (Figures 4A,B) and 10 of the non-tumor cell line
(Figure 4C). Strains KENR18, 25, 59, 60, 64, 65, 91, 94, and
KENB1 (all Streptomyces) reduced the viability by more than
90% of the cell line SH-5YSY. Some of these strains (KENR60,
64, 65, 94, and KENB1) also caused a similar effect in the
cell line T-47D and in the hCMEC/D3 cell line. Extracts with
high cytotoxicity on hCMEC/D3 cells indicated a more general
cytotoxicity. Here, we searched for strains that had cytotoxic
activities toward human cancer cell lines, but not against the
normal cells. In particular, extracts from the strains KENR18,
25, 59, 81, and 85 showed strong inhibition of SHSY-5Y cells
(>80% inhibition), but without significant activity on normal
hCMEC/D3 cells. This same pattern, albeit with lower potencies,
was observed for the extracts obtained from strains KENR23D,
26, 31, 57, 71, 74, 78, and 79. The strains KENR18, 25 and 59 also
reduced the viability of exposed T47D cancer cells (>70%), but
not that of normal endothelial cells.
To understand whether some of the observed activities
could be attributed to known compounds present in the
tested samples, we selected 35 extracts that showed either
strong antimicrobial or strong cancer cell line cytotoxicity
and performed LC-HRESIMS/MS-based dereplication analysis
using GNPS. Interestingly, we found that 26 of these extracts
contained one or more members of the antimycin family of
compounds (Supplementary Table S2). LC-HRESIMS/MS data
for the remaining nine extracts (which showed no hits consistent
with the observed activities in the GNPS dereplication), all from
Streptomyces sp., were used to construct a molecular network
in GNPS (Quinn et al., 2017) (Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figure S2). This allowed us to pinpoint four clusters that were
observed in a single extract, which we defined as an additional
criterium for an increased chance of a cluster corresponding
to a novel compound. Two of such clusters were found in
the extract obtained from Streptomyces sp. KENR85, one from
Streptomyces sp. KENR86 and one other from Streptomyces sp.
KENR91. Because GNPS dereplication relies on the completeness
of its database for MS/MS data matching, it is possible that
previously NP do not show a hit in the GNPS dereplication
workflow. As such, for each of these four clusters of compounds,
we carried out an additional dereplication. We inferred the
likely mass of the main compound from the corresponding LC-
ESI-HRMS data and used that accurate mass as query in a
search against the Dictionary of NP database. For two of the
clusters, a number of hits from Actinobacteria were retrieved
(Supplementary Table S3) that could explain the accurate
mass and the observed activities in the corresponding extract.
However, for the remaining two clusters (one from Streptomyces
sp. KENR85 and one from Streptomyces sp. KENR91), no hits
were retrieved from this database.
DISCUSSION
Macroalgae offer a favorable habitat for several epiphytic
and endophytic microorganisms (Egan et al., 2013). Although
actinobacterial endophytes of terrestrial plants have been proven
to be a valuable source of bioactive compounds (Strobel, 2003;
Zhao et al., 2011), their presence and diversity in macroalgae and
their biotechnological potential is largely unknown. We isolated
a high number of actinobacterial strains (some of them possibly
endophytes) from the kelp L. ochroleuca, indicating that it is a rich
reservoir of actinobacteria. The majority of the isolated strains
was obtained from the holdfast of L. ochroleuca, which may reflect
the permanent contact of this part of the algae with marine
sediments and coastal rocks, where actinobacteria are known to
predominate (Maldonado et al., 2005; Abdelmohsen et al., 2014).
Streptomyces strains are commonly isolated and cultured
under laboratory conditions and have been isolated from
numerous marine ecological niches (Rashad et al., 2015;
Xiong et al., 2015). Several Streptomyces strains with biological
activity have been isolated from algae, including from species
belonging to the class Phaeophyceae where L. ochroleuca belongs
(Wiese et al., 2009; Braña et al., 2015; Ismail et al., 2018). In
our study, most of the isolates recovered from L. ochroleuca
were also Streptomyces strains; this genus is the most important
source of bioactive molecules within the phylum Actinobacteria
(Dharmaraj, 2010).

FIGURE 5 | GNPS-based LC-HRESIMS/MS molecular network analysis of actinobacterial extracts likely to contain new bioactive compounds. The extracts obtained
from three Streptomyces sp. strains showed molecular clusters unique to each strain (depicted by connected ellipses, labeled with the corresponding m/z value for
the parent ion). The results of Dictionary of Natural Products (∗) searches for the accurate masses of the most abundant species in each cluster (as estimated from
the respective UV and extracted ion chromatograms, EICs, and shown in different color from the remaining nodes in the cluster) are presented for each m/z species
(for two molecular clusters, no correspondence was found in this database).
Rare actinobacterial genera are also gaining increasing
attention in the field of NP discovery, owning to their
underexplored metabolic potential (Subramani and Aalbersberg,
2012, 2013; Dhakal et al., 2017). We isolated strains affiliated
with six rare actinobacterial genera –Rhodococcus, Nonomuraeae,
Microbispora, Isoptericola, Nocardiopsis, and Microbacterium.
Isolates from the latter three genera have also been obtained from
macroalgae species, including some from the class Phaeophyceae
(Hollants et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2014; Santhi et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2017).

Bioactivity in Kelp-Associated Actinobacteria
Half of the isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity, mostly
antifungal activity against C. albicans, with four Streptomyces
strains exhibiting the strongest activities. Streptomyces strains
isolated in other studies from diverse marine sources have
produced secondary metabolites with antifungal properties
against C. albicans, like isoikarugamycin, a novel polycyclic
tetramic
acid
macrolactam
produced
by
Streptomyces
zhaozhouensis (Lacret et al., 2014), or saadamycin, a polyketide
produced by a marine sponge-associated Streptomyces sp.
(El-Gendy and El-Bondkly, 2010). In this study we have also
isolated eight actinobacterial strains exhibiting antibacterial
activity against S. aureus, a bacterium associated with an
extensive range of clinical infections, and with resistance to
antibiotics, and an important target for the development of novel
therapeutic agents (Tong et al., 2015). Marine actinobacteria
are known to produce secondary metabolites capable of
inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, including multidrug resistant
strains of this bacterium. The compounds arenimycin and
abyssomicin C are two such examples, produced by Salinispora
and Verrucosispora strains, respectively (Bister et al., 2004;
Asolkar et al., 2010).
Recently, an actinobacterial strain
identified as Kocuria marina CMG S2, isolated from the brown
macroalgae Pelvetia canaliculata, was reported to produce a
novel antibiotic, named as kocumarin, with activity against fungi
and pathogenic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(Uzair et al., 2018).
Likewise, several actinobacterial strains isolated from different
marine sources, including macroalgae, are capable of producing
secondary metabolites with anticancer activity (Lam, 2006;
Asolkar et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2015). Many of these strains
are Streptomyces but genera exclusive from marine environments
like Salinispora, Salinibacterium, and Marinispora are also
considered promising sources of anticancer molecules (Lam,
2006; Zotchev, 2012). In our study, a total of 28 extracts
demonstrated capacity to decrease significantly the viability of
the cell lines. Many of those extracts demonstrated cytotoxicity
also on the non-carcinogenic cell line hCMEC/D3, which
indicates general cytotoxicity. However, some of the extracts
with strong anticancer activity had negligible toxicity to non-
tumor cells, and showed specificity toward neuroblastoma cells
(KENR18, 25, 59, 91).
The bioassay data that we obtained indicated the presence
of active compounds in the extracts and, hence, the potential
for the discovery of new bioactive metabolites. However, a
common issue in current NP discovery efforts (in particular
those using actinobacteria) is the re-isolation of previously
reported secondary metabolites, leading to a waste of time
and resources (Gaudêncio and Pereira, 2015). As such, and to
understand to what extent the observed bioactivities could result
from known compounds and, concomitantly, which extracts
were more likely to harbor new bioactive metabolites, we
performed dereplication and molecular networking analyses. We
found that a number of different antimycins was associated
with many of the dereplicated samples. These likely antimycin-
containing extracts were obtained from different genera of
actinobacteria and from all sampled L. ochroleuca parts.
Members of this class of metabolites have been isolated
previously from marine actinobacteria (Imamura et al., 1993;
Xu et al., 2011; Han et al., 2012), suggesting that marine
environments selects for this chemical scaffold, a finding that
might deserve further study. The molecular network analyses
revealed that two of these strains – KENR85 and KENR91 –
were potential producers of novel bioactive compounds. UV-
Vis and ion chromatograms extracted from the LC-HRESIMS
data indicate that these potential novel metabolites are not
likely to be abundant in crude extracts (Figure 5), but we
intend to follow-up on these interesting results. Moreover, we
only analyzed in depth clusters from the molecular network
that were associated with a single extract, which does not
rule out the possibility for additional chemical novelty in
the set of nine strains that showed no relevant hits in the
GNPS dereplication.
