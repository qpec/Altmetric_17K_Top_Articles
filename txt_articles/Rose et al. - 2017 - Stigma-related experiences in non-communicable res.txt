non-communicable respiratory
diseases: A systematic review

Abstract
The stigma of non-communicable respiratory diseases (NCRDs), whether perceived or otherwise, can be an
important element of a patient’s experience of his/her illness and a contributing factor to poor psychosocial,
treatment and clinical outcomes. This systematic review examines the evidence regarding the associations
between stigma-related experiences and patient outcomes, comparing findings across a range of common
NCRDs. Electronic databases and manual searches were conducted to identify original quantitative research
published to December 2015. Articles focussing on adult patient samples diagnosed with asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or mesothelioma, and included a
measurement of stigma-related experience (i.e. perceived stigma, shame, blame or guilt), were eligible for
inclusion. Included articles were described for study characteristics, outcome scores, correlates between
stigma-related experiences and patient outcomes and methodological rigor. Twenty-five articles were
eligible for this review, with most (n ¼ 20) related to lung cancer. No articles for cystic fibrosis were
identified. Twenty unique scales were used, with low to moderate stigma-related experiences reported
overall. The stigma-related experiences significantly correlated with all six patient-related domains explored
(psychosocial, quality of life, behavioral, physical, treatment and work), which were investigated more widely in
COPD and lung cancer samples. No studies adequately met all criteria for methodological rigor. The inter-
connectedness of stigma-related experiences to other aspects of patient experiences highlight that an
integrated approach is needed to address this important issue. Future studies should adopt more rigorous
methodology, including streamlining measures, to provide robust evidence.

Background
Respiratory diseases represent a major public health
concern due to their high frequency, economic burden
and social impacts.1 The majority of serious respira-
tory conditions are incurable. Causes are varied; how-
ever, many are considered to be largely preventable.2

 slow progression, are one of the main types of chronic
conditions in the world.3 In high-income countries,
NCRDs such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, cystic
fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, lung cancer
and occupation-related conditions are a substantial
contributor to mortality and illness-related burden.3
While the disease-related experiences of these
patients may differ widely, it is important to under-
stand whether common factors can potentially con-
tribute to their health and general well-being.
NCRDs can significantly impact various aspects of
patient outcomes. Functional capacity can become
limited with symptoms including wheeziness/breath-
lessness, cough, fatigue, chest pain and/or tightness,
or presence of blood or sputum. However, beyond
physical outcomes, psychosocial well-being and qual-
ity of life can also be affected.4 This has been demon-
strated in previous studies where NCRD patients
reported experiencing issues related to loss of inde-
pendence, altered family dynamics, feelings of social
isolation, embarrassment, guilt, fear and body image
disturbances.5–9 Of important note is the potential
ripple effect towards adverse clinical outcomes. For
example, in a sample of patients with late stage lung
cancer, depression was found to be associated with
poor treatment adherence and prognosis.10 This high-
lights the inter-relatedness of factors that influence
patient outcomes and the need for an integrated
approach to patient care and management in order
to improve well-being, treatment and potentially sur-
vival outcomes.
Emerging research suggests that stigma-related
experiences may be frequent among individuals with
a number of health conditions, including NCRDs.11
Contemporary concepts of stigma can be traced to
Goffman’s work, which is described as an attribute
that discredits or devalues individuals, reducing
them ‘from a whole person to a tainted, discounted
one’.12 More recently the stigma concept has been
reframed for health-related contexts as an adverse
social judgement ‘based on an enduring feature of
identity conferred by a health problem or health-
related condition’.13 Internalized or self-stigma may
manifest when individuals become aware of the neg-
ative social perceptions attached to particular diag-
noses and consequently anticipate prejudice or
discrimination. Individuals may also carry self-
blame on account of their behavior that can drive
feelings of shame and guilt about their condi-
tion.14,15 Therefore, while stigma, shame, blame and
guilt may be distinct psychological concepts, they
can be considered related under the term ‘stigma-
related experiences’.
In the context of NCRDs, self-stigma may occur
regardless of how the condition was acquired
(whether through lifestyle behavior or congenital/her-
editary factors). Given that tobacco is the main mod-
ifiable risk factor for COPD and lung cancer,16 the
perceived controllability of an individual’s smoking
behavior may influence social reactions to disease
onset. A survey of the general population showed
respondents were more likely to hold lung cancer
patients with a smoking history accountable for their
condition compared to their non-smoking counter-
parts.17 Similarly, more than one-third of people
with COPD attributed their diagnosis to personal
behavior.18 Cystic fibrosis, an inherited condition,
is also subjected to adverse public responses,19 given
its links to poor physical outcomes and premature
mortality.20
While mostly anecdotal, the literature suggests that
stigmatizing attitudes can variably influence patient’s
health and treatment behaviors. COPD and lung can-
cer patients have reported delays in seeking medical
assistance on account of not having their concerns
addressed seriously by health professionals or feeling
unworthy of receiving treatment.21 Patients with
asthma have reported feeling embarrassed using treat-
ment in public,22 while cystic fibrosis patients
describe feelings of unease at producing socially
unacceptable symptoms (e.g. sputum);23 this can con-
tribute to issues with treatment adherence which is
commonly poor in this population.24–26 Such experi-
ences can act as significant barriers to achieving opti-
mal patient care and health outcomes.
The stigma literature in NCRDs is increasing. Evi-
dence suggests that patients with a range of NCRDs
report feelings of perceived stigma, shame, blame or
guilt.20,21,27,28 These experiences may generally be a
feature of the social context of disease, contributing to
not only the personal barriers to seeking treatment and
care, but also adherence to treatment and hence over-
all physical and mental health outcomes.29 While it
seems that stigma-related experiences can be a con-
sistent experience in NCRDs, notably the aetiology,
severity and familiarity of illnesses vary. Therefore,
stigma-related experiences may (or may not) vary by
condition. However, a comprehensive and current
review of the data regarding stigma-related experi-
ences and their broader impacts on a range of respira-
tory diseases is lacking.

Chronic Respiratory Disease 14(3)
 Recently, a review investigated the impact of lung
cancer stigma and nihilism on patient outcomes and
concluded that perceived stigma is evident and addi-
tional research is necessary.30 This review aims to build
on this work by examining the experience of stigma in
addition to shame, blame and guilt among a wider scope
of NCRDs, exploring the potential impacts across the
full range of patient outcomes. This will allow common
features of stigma-related experiences to be identified
across groups, to highlight unique or shared contribu-
tory factors to such experiences, and describe the influ-
ence on patient outcomes. Understanding the patient
experience in this respect is needed to understand how
to best engage and support people during provision of
health care.31–34 To facilitate this understanding, asses-
sing the methodological rigor of the literature is also
required to enable the development of recommenda-
tions informed by strong and robust data.
Specifically, the aim of this review is to examine the
current evidence regarding stigma-related experiences
(inclusiveofperceived stigma,shame, blame orguilt) to
patient outcomes within the following NCRDs: asthma,
COPD, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma.
The literature will be described in terms of:
1.
the number of articles relating to each NCRD
and study characteristics;
2.
the prevalence of stigma-related experiences
across NCRD groups;
3.
associations between reported stigma-related
experiences in each NCRD group and patient
outcomes across domains that were identified
in the literature search; and
4.
the quality of evidence in identified articles,
including whether study populations were rep-
resentative of disease groups.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using the
PRISMA statement.38
Search terms
Search terms were generated iteratively by the
research team and reviewed by an experienced med-
ical librarian. Searches were conducted in December
2015 using a selection of electronic databases to
retrieve original peer-reviewed publications and
unpublished studies from the grey literature. Manual
searches were also conducted to ensure all relevant
articles were identified. This included searches in
Google Scholar, whereby the first 100 results were
reviewed for relevance, and websites of organizations
applicable to the NCRDs of interest. Table 1 details
the search terms and sources of article retrieval.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Articles were included for review if they involved:
1.
an adult (18 years or older) patient sample;
2.
measurement of stigma-related experiences
(inclusive of perceived stigma, shame, blame
and guilt); and
3.
one of the five following NCRDs: asthma,
COPD (including emphysema and chronic
bronchitis), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and
mesothelioma.
The listed NCRDs were selected because of their
high international prevalence35–37 and varying aetiol-
ogies (e.g. behavioral, occupational and genetic),
perceived controllability (e.g. role of modifiable or
non-modifiable factors) and severity. This allowed for
potential stigma-related consequences to be compared
and contrasted based on specific disease factors.
Articles were excluded if they:
1.
were duplicates;
2.
were not published in English;
3.
were a review, editorial, commentary or
protocol;
4.
did not describe original research;
5.
described solely qualitative findings;
6.
exclusively reported aggregate findings across
conditions not of interest to this review; or
7.
did not assess stigma-related experiences in
relation to patient outcomes (e.g. examined
inequities or discrimination based on gender,
race, socioeconomic status, etc.).
As research in health-related stigma is an emerging
field, the year of publication was not limited. The
information extracted from articles included author,
sample size, sample characteristics (age, gender,
smoking status, disease severity and time of diagno-
sis), disease type, the stigma-related measure used
and stigma-related findings.
Quality assessment
Appraisal of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for
each article was conducted by a first coder (SR) and a
random sample (10%) was independently checked by a
Rose et al.
201
 second coder (DR). Of included articles, data was
extracted by a first coder (SR) and a random sample
(20%) was independently checked by a second coder
(DR). Data extraction of all included articles was per-
formed independently by two coders (SR and DR). Dis-
crepancies were resolved through discussion. At all
stages, more than 90% agreement between coders was
achieved.
The methodological quality of all included studies
was also assessed independently by two separate
coders (SR, CP, AB and BK) using an amended ver-
sion of the McMaster criteria form for quantitative
studies (intervention criteria removed and replaced
with sample representativeness criteria). Discrepan-
cies were discussed until consensus was reached.
Results
Volume of articles
A total of 1431 articles were retrieved from the liter-
ature search (Figure 1). An additional 27 articles were
identified via manual searches. Of these, 25 (peer-
reviewed, n ¼ 22; grey literature, n ¼ 3) were
included for this review.
Most studies (n ¼ 20) involved people with lung
cancer.39–58 The next most common participant group
was COPD (n ¼ 4),18,49,59,60 followed by asthma27,59,61
and mesothelioma43 (some articles examined more
than one NCRD). No identified article examined
stigma-related experiences in relation to cystic fibrosis.
Table 2 summarizes the sample characteristics.
Prevalence of stigma-related experiences
Articles examined NCRDs in relation to per-
ceived stigma,27,39–42,44,45,47–52,56–59,61 shame or
guilt43–46,52,54,60 and blame.18,50,51,53,55 Generally,
most samples within each NCRDs tended to report
low (i.e. aggregate scores in the lowest third of the
possible total) to moderate (i.e. aggregate scores in
the middle third of the possible total) scores of
stigma-related experiences (Table 2). However,
higher aggregate stigma-related scores (i.e. aggregate
scores in the highest third of the possible total) were
reported in COPD18 and lung cancer samples.42,50,51
Overall, perceived stigma was measured via 10 dif-
ferent scales, blame via six separate scales and shame
or guilt via five unique scales (Table 2).

 outcomes.18,27,39–45,47–49,52,53,55–60 The remaining
studies either did not investigate patient out-
comes46,54,61 or reported combined findings with
other disease groups (i.e. not NCRD) that were not
relevant to this review.50,51
Outcomes associated with stigma-related experi-
ences by the study participants were identified in the
following six domains: psychosocial, quality of life,
behavioral, physical, treatment and employment.
Broadly, stigma-related experiences were shown to
have significant associations with all domains
(Table 3). These relationships were investigated more
widely in COPD and lung cancer; however, fewer
domains were explored in asthma (psychosocial,
physical and employment) and mesothelioma (beha-
vioral only).
Stigma-related experiences and psychosocial outcomes.
Fourteen articles investigated the possible associations
between stigma-related experiences and psychosocial
outcomes among patients with asthma,27 COPD18,49
and lung cancer.39,41,42,44,45,47–49,53,55,57,58 In particu-
lar, the association between perceived stigma and
depression was most frequently investigated, with all
studies indicating a significant positive relationship.
Studies in COPD and lung cancer examined similar
patient psychosocial outcomes. Blame from others,
family functioning and dyadic adjustment were found
to significantly correlate with self-blame in both dis-
ease groups.18,53,55 Prevalence data also indicated that
COPD and lung cancer patients frequently experience
perceived stigma, where disease onset can be attrib-
uted to personal responsibility.49 However, anxiety

 was found to be significantly associated with per-
ceived stigma in lung cancer39,41,44,45 but not
COPD.18 The relationship between perceived stigma
and mental health was investigated in asthma only
and could not be compared to other NCRDs. In lung
cancer, non-significant associations were reported
when self-blame was measured in relation to dis-
tress55 and social support53 only.
Stigma-related experiences and quality of life. Four arti-
cles investigated stigma-related experiences with
quality of life outcomes among people with COPD18
and lung cancer.39,42,57 Significant inverse relation-
ships were reported in both disease groups when mea-
sured with perceived stigma39,42,57 and self-blame.18
Stigma-related experiences and behavior. Two studies
investigated the associations between stigma-related
experiences and behavior among people with lung
cancer43,47 and mesothelioma.43 Diagnosis conceal-
ment was reported to be significantly associated with
internalized shame within the last month and since
diagnosis in patients with lung cancer.47
Stigma-related experiences and physical health. Six stud-
ies investigated the associations between stigma-
related experiences and physical outcomes among
people with asthma,27,59 COPD18,59 and lung can-
cer.41,44,52 Poorer health status scores were signifi-
cantly linked to greater levels of perceived stigma in
asthma patients,27 and feelings of greater shame, guilt
and self-blame in people with lung cancer.44 No links
between perceived stigma and hospitalizations were
found in asthma and COPD patients.27,59
Findings in relation to patient physical symp-
toms were mixed. Among people with lung cancer,
perceived stigma was found to have a positive rela-
tionship with perceived symptom severity, as well
as with all investigated symptoms including appe-
tite loss, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, haemoptysis and
pain.41 Similarly, in asthma and COPD patients com-
bined, perceived stigma was significantly associated
with dyspnea and cough symptoms (only aggregate
findings were reported).59 However, self-blame was
shown to have no association with breathlessness in
COPD patients.18
Stigma-related experiences and treatment experience.
Four articles investigated the possible associations
between stigma-related experiences and treatment
experiences within COPD49,60 and lung cancer.40,49,56
Higher levels of perceived stigma were shown to
predict longer delays between symptom onset and
medical help-seeking in lung cancer patients.
Descriptive data also suggested that perceived stigma
may be connected to poor treatment compliance in
both COPD and lung cancer patients.49,60
Stigma-related experiences and employment. Only one
article investigated the associations between stigma-
related experiences and work factors within a com-
bined sample of asthma and COPD patients.59 Higher
levels of perceived stigma were shown to be signifi-
cantly linked to absenteeism.
Determinants of stigma-related experiences. Determi-
nants of stigma-related experiences were explored
in a small proportion of articles. Smoking history
was a common factor explored in COPD and lung
cancer samples. In COPD, it was found that people
with greater duration and intensity of smoking were
more likely to endorse the maximum score of beha-
vioral self-blame.18 Similarly, in lung cancer, smok-
ing history was reported to be correlated with greater
self-blame,44,53,57,58 guilt and shame.52 Time since
diagnosis was explored in lung cancer samples,
where relationships between higher perceived
stigma and increased number of days to seek medical
advice for symptoms were reported.52,56 Younger
age was also shown to be significantly linked to
higher perceived stigma scores in COPD and lung
cancer patients.49
Quality of evidence (methodological rigor)
A summary of scores for methodological rigor is
described in Table 4. Overall, no articles adequately
met all criteria; however, three satisfactorily met six
of the seven criteria44,47,48 (all lung cancer samples).
One article only met one criteria for methodological
rigor.54 The majority of articles (n ¼ 20) included a
sample with moderate to high risk of bias. Sample
features (such as characteristics and justification of
sample size) were also lacking sufficient detail, with
a small number of articles (n ¼ 5) adequately addres-
sing this criteria.
Asthma samples were older than the general pop-
ulation of people with asthma. However, it should be
noted that this review focused on studies conducted
with in adult samples. Approximately, one-fifth of the
lung cancer studies included samples younger than
the average patient (mean sample age less than
60 years old).39,41,42 Participants in the remaining
lung cancer and COPD studies appropriately reflect

Discussion
This review builds on previous work30 by identifying
correlates of stigma-related experiences across a
larger number of patient domains within various
NCRDs. Our findings were directed towards patient
experiences and look more in depth at the potential
stigma-related impacts overall, inclusive of day-to-
day effects (e.g. work and social interactions). Com-
mon NCRDs of different prognoses and causative
factors (such as behavioral, environmental or genetic)
were targeted to determine whether such features can
be attributable when comparing differences in patient
outcomes. Understanding the possible factors that
may contribute to or influence stigma-related experi-
ences will identify relevant areas for delivering appro-
priate care and support to patients with NCRDs to
promote improved patient outcomes.
Studies addressing stigma-related effects on patient
outcomes were predominantly in relation to psycho-
social domains. This may be because stigma is largely
viewed as a social phenomenon that centres on public
identity and group membership.12 As such, the psy-
chological effects may be seen as more pertinent by
researchers. Despite this, in accordance with health-
related stigma,13 a broader range of patient outcomes
can be impacted, which is worthy of further explora-
tion. For example, only a small proportion of studies
identified in this review investigated the relationship
between perceived stigma and shame to either an
individual’s
behaviour
or
treatment
experi-
ences18,40,43,47,49,56 with statistically significant rela-
tionships detected. Previous qualitative studies have
demonstrated that factors such as fear or reluctance in
discussing symptoms as a barrier to seeking medical
advice.21,62 However, in the instance of NCRDs (such
as lung cancer), prompt symptom recognition and
medical help-seeking is key to potentially extending
survival.62 As data are limited, it is of particular
importance to examine whether stigma-related
experiences can have detrimental implications later
in the disease trajectory, particularly in relation to
treatment decisions or adherence, and the role of nihi-
lism on treatment choices.
Studies included in this review were primarily
focused on COPD or lung cancer, indicating their
vulnerability to stigmatization compared to other
NCRD groups. Potentially contributing to this is the
known role of tobacco smoking to the onset of COPD
and lung cancer,16 with the perception that the beha-
vior is controllable and the disease therefore preven-
table. This has been reflected in a population-based
study in which 70% of participants believed that lung
cancer patients were at least partially to blame for
their diagnosis.63 Qualitative data suggests that anti-
tobacco campaigns may contribute to additional
distress in COPD and lung cancer samples.21,28 How-
ever, further research is needed30 as these data are
anecdotal and the potential influence of media cam-
paigns on stigma-related experiences is not clear. The
bulk of identified studies were published within the
last 10 years. This recent increase in stigma-related
research, particularly in relation to COPD and lung
cancer, may reflect the emergence of anti-tobacco
campaigns that have come into prominence in recent
years. For example, the United States’ ‘Truth’ cam-
paign and Australia’s ‘Make Smoking History’ cam-
paign were launched in 2000 and graphically depict
the adverse effects of smoking.
A key issue is the ambiguity when interpreting the
reported findings for this review. Across the 25 arti-
cles included in this review, 20 different scales were
used to measure an element of stigma-related experi-
ence (i.e. perceived stigma, shame, blame or guilt).
None of the measures used had specified thresholds
by which to categorize the level of stigma-related
experiences, and only two measures were specifically
for NCRDs (the Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma
Scale and the Respiratory Illness Opinion Survey).
Studies commonly used measures validated in mental
health samples,18,27,44,45,47–52 or author-developed
scales where validity and reliability were not
assessed.43–46,49,52,54,60 Most measures comprised of
one item, with only the Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma
Scale, the Social Impact Scale and the adapted version
of the Shame and Stigma Scale providing a more
comprehensive assessment of perceived stigma with
31, 24 and 21 items, respectively. While these find-
ings provide an indication of stigma-related experi-
ences across NCRDs, the vast differences between
measures and the lack of clarity around interpretation
of scores create challenges in objectively comparing
experiences and effects on patient outcomes across
(and within) disease groups.
The limitations of this review also need to be con-
sidered. As only quantitative English articles were
included, some relevant articles may have been
excluded. A broad set of search terms were used with
the intent of adopting an inclusive approach to
212
Chronic Respiratory Disease 14(3)
 retrieving articles. Due to the scope covering multiple
conditions, the authors considered it was appropriate
to use a generalized set of search terms to capture a
thorough pool of articles in an area that is limited.
While it was considered unlikely that relevant articles
would be missed, additional search strategies were
employed, such as conducting searches via Google
Scholar search and websites of key organizations, to
ensure that this was minimized. While only a propor-
tion of article titles, abstracts and full texts were
screened by a second coder, there was a high level
of agreement which suggests that potential errors
were minimal. The aims of the included studies were
not reported in this review. It may be that stigma-
related experiences were not the primary focus of
some of the included articles, which may account for
the selection of less thorough or robust stigma-related
measures. Finally, the authors’ categorization of the
scale scores as low, moderate and high was a specific
strategy for the purposes of this review and requires
validation.
Stigma-related research in NCRDs is increasing.
However, knowledge gaps are still evident with fur-
ther investigation towards stigma warranted. Greater
clarity about the various concepts (perceived stigma,
shame, blame and guilt) commonly grouped together
under the umbrella term ‘stigma’ is likely to be help-
ful. The authors also suggest that attention be directed
towards the following:
1.
Further development of stigma-related mea-
sures: The use of different tools across
included articles contributed to the variability
of findings. It may also be that the stigma-
related scales used were not appropriate. As
most scales originated and were developed for
mental illness, they may not have the sensitiv-
ity to detect similar outcomes in patients with
other chronic health conditions, such as
NCRDs. In order to address this, future efforts
need to be directed towards establishing
stigma scales applicable to these disease
groups. Further, development of generic scales
for use in populations with chronic conditions
will enable comparisons of stigma across differ-
ent populations. The establishment of score
thresholds would enable the identification of
individuals experiencing high levels of perceived
stigma who may benefit from intervention.
2.
Ensuring studies are methodologically robust:
Steps to minimize potential selection bias to
improve methodological rigor need to be con-
sidered in the design of studies. Randomizing
participants for intervention studies and adopt-
ing recruitment methods that facilitate repre-
sentative sampling (i.e. limiting self-selection
or volunteer strategies) in cross-sectional stud-
ies are strategies that can alleviate this risk.
Complete descriptions of sample characteris-
tics are needed to provide a more comprehen-
sive picture. This will assist to determine
whether the stigma impacts particular patient
groups or whether particular patient subgroups
are more vulnerable to stigmatization to target
future interventions.
3.
Broadening research to examine stigma-
related experiences beyond psychosocial cor-
relates: It is timely to explore stigma-related
consequences that reflect patient outcomes
more widely, integrating the multiple factors
that are involved in their care processes (such
as treatment decision-making) and day-to-day
management (such as mobility). In conditions
such as lung cancer or mesothelioma where
early detection is particularly pertinent in pro-
viding greater treatment options, addressing
stigma may assist in reducing barriers to seek-
ing timely medical help. This in turn may
improve clinical outcomes and reduce psycho-
social distress.
4.
Investigating temporal relationships of
stigma-related experiences: Most studies uti-
lized a cross-sectional design, where causality
cannot be established. It would be opportune
to identify whether stigma-related experiences
are transitory or enduring to enable recom-
mendations for future support services, as well
as the appropriate timing of services to pro-
mote optimum patient outcomes.
Clinical implications
The stigma of NCRDs is an important issue to
address, and clinicians can play a key role in effec-
tively responding to these patient experiences. As
found in this review, perceived stigma and shame
were shown to be associated with delayed medical
help-seeking, diagnosis concealment, symptom sever-
ity and poor treatment use for patients,40,49,56,60 which
can adversely impact patient health outcomes. Other
studies have demonstrated that clinicians who com-
municate empathetically with their patients can lead
Rose et al.
213
 to higher satisfaction and improved health outcomes
(such as compliance with treatment) for patients.64,65
However, the stigma that may manifest with NCRDs
can impede opportunities in facilitating open dialogue
between the patients and their clinician to promote
best possible care.62 Further, it may be that opportu-
nities are missed by clinicians due to time constraints
or focus towards making diagnoses or recommending
appropriate treatment. It is therefore important for
clinicians to be vigilant in recognizing and responding
to these opportunities when they arise, but also to
identify potential patient stigma or related experi-
ences to understand and appropriately discuss con-
cerns sensitively to alleviate the impact. Such
practices can be instrumental in addressing the overt
as well as underlying issues that may influence
stigma-related experiences to support the patient
self-esteem, disease management and treatment66 to
assist with improving both clinical and psychosocial
outcomes for the patient.
Conclusion
The findings of this review indicate that patients with
NCRDs report low to moderate scores of stigma-
related experiences. However, more rigorous studies
are needed in order to determine this more accurately
and comprehensively. Within the large pool of litera-
ture resulting from this search, only 25 stigma-related
studies were identified in relation to NCRDs. This
literature gap is of concern, particularly given the
association between stigma-related experiences and
important patient outcomes. Building the evidence
base will be critical in developing appropriate inter-
ventions and the delivery of best care within popula-
tion groups vulnerable to stigma.
