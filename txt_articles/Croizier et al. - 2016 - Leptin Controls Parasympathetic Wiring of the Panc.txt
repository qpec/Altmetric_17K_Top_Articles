SUMMARY
The autonomic nervous system plays a critical role in
glucose metabolism through both its sympathetic
and parasympathetic branches, but the mechanisms
that underlie the development of the autonomic
innervation of the pancreas remain poorly under-
stood. Here, we report that cholinergic innervation
of pancreatic islets develops during mid-gestation
under the influence of leptin. Leptin-deficient mice
display a greater cholinergic innervation of pancre-
atic islets beginning in embryonic life, and this in-
crease persists into adulthood. Remarkably, a single
intracerebroventricular injection of leptin in embryos
caused a permanent reduction in parasympathetic
innervation of pancreatic b cells and long-term im-
pairments in glucose homeostasis. These develop-
mental effects of leptin involve a direct inhibitory
effect on the outgrowth of preganglionic axons
from the hindbrain. These studies reveal an unan-
ticipated regulatory role of leptin on the para-
sympathetic
nervous
system
during
embryonic
development and may have important implications
for our understanding of the early mechanisms that
contribute to diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
The autonomic nervous system is essential for the regulation of
critical physiological functions including cardiac output, body
temperature and blood glucose levels (Schmidt and Thews,
1989). Classically, the autonomic nervous system is divided
into two anatomically and functionally distinct branches: the
sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous
system. Consistent with a role of the autonomic nervous system
in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, sympathetic and
parasympathetic neurons densely innervate the endocrine
pancreas and, in particular, the islets of Langerhans (Ahre
´ n,
2000; Thorens, 2014; Woods and Porte, 1974). Notably, the sym-
pathetic and parasympathetic systems exert distinct actions on
pancreatic islets: whereas sympathetic nerve stimulation inhibits
insulin secretion from pancreatic b cells and promotes glucagon
secretion from pancreatic a cells, parasympathetic input stimu-
lates the secretion of both glucagon and insulin (Bloom and Ed-
wards, 1975). Despite the critical role of the autonomic nervous
system in the regulation of islet hormone secretion, relatively little
is known about the mechanisms involved in the development of
the autonomic innervation of the pancreas.
The parasympathetic fibers that innervate the endocrine
pancreas originate primarily from neurons in the intrapancreatic
ganglia, which receive preganglionic inputs from the hindbrain
via the vagus nerve (Fox and Powley, 1986). In contrast, sympa-
thetic fibers within in the pancreas originate from preganglionic
cell bodies that are located in the thoracic and upper lumbar seg-
ments of the spinal cord (Furuzawa et al., 1996). Both the para-
sympathetic and sympathetic systems develop before birth,
and autonomic nerve fibers can be observed in various periph-
eral organs as early as mid-gestation (Black, 1978; Burris
and Hebrok, 2007; Rinaman and Levitt, 1993). Notably, the onset
of autonomic innervation coincides with stages of rapid growth,
differentiation, and maturation in the embryonic pancreas (Jør-
gensen et al., 2007).
In addition to being controlled by the autonomic nervous sys-
tem, pancreatic function is also regulated by hormonal factors,
including the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. Although leptin
was initially described as a regulator of energy balance and
neuroendocrine function, it has subsequently been shown to
influence sympathetic tone and glucose homeostasis (Enriori
et al., 2011; Marino et al., 2011; Morton and Schwartz, 2011;
Simonds et al., 2014). The effects of leptin are now recognized
to be mediated by a distributed neural network that includes neu-
rons located in both the hypothalamus and hindbrain (Gautron
et al., 2015; Grill and Hayes, 2012; Leinninger and Myers,
2008). In addition to the physiological effects it exerts during
adult life, leptin provides trophic support to hypothalamic neural
projections during development (Bouret et al., 2004). However,
whether leptin influences the development of non-hypothalamic
circuits remains unknown.
In this report, we investigated the development of the para-
sympathetic innervation of the endocrine pancreas. We demon-
strated that exposure of the embryonic brain to leptin during
a discrete developmental period results in permanent alterations
in the cholinergic innervation of pancreatic b cells as well as
long-term perturbations in glucose homeostasis. Furthermore,
we showed that leptin directly inhibits cholinergic neurite

 outgrowth from the hindbrain, suggesting that the develop-
mental effects of leptin on parasympathetic projections involves,
at least in part, a direct effect on preganglionic neurons within the
hindbrain.
RESULTS
Ontogeny of the Parasympathetic Innervation of
Pancreatic Islets
To begin to examine the development of the parasympathetic
innervation of the pancreas, we first performed immunohisto-
chemical labeling for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter
(VAChT), a well-known marker of cholinergic fibers (Weihe
et al., 1996), in mouse embryonic pancreatic tissues. To visualize
b cells, we also immunostained for insulin. VAChT-positive fibers
were found in the vicinity of pancreatic insulin-containing cells as
early as embryonic day 12 (E12) (Figure 1A). However, at this
age, only a few cells expressed insulin, as previously described
(Jørgensen et al., 2007). The relative number of insulin-contain-
ing cells was markedly increased at E15, as was the density of
VAChT-positive fibers surrounding b cells (Figure 1A). By E18,
the insulin-expressing cells formed adult-like islets, and the
density of cholinergic axons in b-cell islets had substantially
increased (Figure 1A). The VAChT-positive axons appeared to
make synaptic contacts within the islets, because those axons
also expressed synaptophysin1, a major synaptic vesicle mem-
brane protein (Figures 1B and 1C). As expected, adult islets were
densely innervated by VAChT-immunopositive fibers (Figure 1C).
Notably, projections containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a
marker of sympathetic neurons, developed in a pattern that
mirrored that of the innervation of VAChT terminals (Figure S1A).
The cholinergic fibers that innervate the pancreas mainly orig-
inate from the dorsomedial nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV).
Most of these fibers run within the vagus nerve and terminate
on the pancreatic ganglia, where they form synapses with inter-
neurons (Fox and Powley, 1986). To assess the proportion of
cholinergic preganglionic fibers that directly innervate the em-
bryonic pancreatic ganglia and islets, we used a transgenic
mouse in which the fluorescent protein tdTomato is selectively
expressed in cell bodies and neuronal processes of a subset of

 nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)/DMV neurons (Phox2b-Cre;
tdTomato mice; Figure 1D; Scott et al., 2011). We observed
that a significant proportion of the VAChT-immunoreactive fibers
in the pancreatic islets also contained the red fluorescent signal
of tdTomato. In addition, a number of cholinergic intrapancreatic
ganglia also contain tdTomato (Figure 1E). These data suggest
that the cholinergic fibers that are found in pancreatic islets
might originate from hindbrain neurons as well as intrapancreatic
ganglia (Figures 1D and 1E).
Lack of Leptin Affects the Pattern of Cholinergic
Innervation of the Pancreas
Leptin is known to regulate the activity of the autonomic nervous
system during adulthood (Arteaga-Solis et al., 2013; Simonds
et al., 2014), but whether leptin is involved in the development
of the autonomic nervous system remains unknown. Accord-
ingly, we next examined the density of cholinergic fibers in the
islets of leptin-deficient (ob/ob) embryos. Although the overall
timing of development and the distribution of VAChT fibers
were relatively similar between ob/ob and wild-type (WT) em-
bryos (Figures 1A and 2A), we observed clear differences in
the density of fibers. There were 1.3-fold more labeled fibers in
the islets of E18 ob/ob mice than in those of E18 WT mice
(Figure 2B).
To determine whether the changes in the cholinergic innerva-
tion of islets that were observed in the ob/ob embryos were per-
manent, we studied pancreatic islet innervation in adult mice.
The density of VAChT fibers that was observed in the islets of
adult ob/ob mice was 3-fold higher than that observed in those
of WT mice (Figure 2C). We also examined the density of fibers
that contained vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), another
marker of parasympathetic innervation, and found a 3-fold in-
crease in the density of VIP-labeled fibers in the islets of adult
ob/ob mice (Figure 2G).
A Single Prenatal Leptin Injection Has Long-Term
Structural Effects on Islet Innervation
If leptin is a critical regulator of the cholinergic innervation of the
pancreas, exposing embryos to leptin should change VAChT fi-
ber density. We therefore injected leptin directly in the ventricular
cavity of WT and ob/ob embryos at E12. The density of VAChT-
positive fibers was reduced by 1.9-fold and 2.1-fold in the leptin-
treated WT and ob/ob embryos, respectively, compared to their
control littermates (Figure 2B). The effects of prenatal leptin on
parasympathetic innervation appear to be permanent, because
the density of VAChT fibers was also reduced by 1.4-fold and
1.3-fold in adult WT and ob/ob animals, respectively, that were
prenatally treated with leptin (Figures 2D and 2E). Similarly, a sin-
gle prenatal leptin injection reduced the density of VIP fibers in
pancreatic islets by 2-fold (Figure 2F). In contrast, prenatal leptin
did not appear to influence the sympathetic innervation of the
pancreas, as the density of TH-labeled fibers was similar be-
tween leptin- and vehicle-treated ob/ob mice (Figure S1B). In
addition, prenatal leptin treatment did not influence islet size
(Figure 2E) or b cell area (Figure 2H) in ob/ob mice but did reduce
islet size by 1.4-fold in WT mice (Figure 2D). Because the para-
sympathetic system is also involved in glucagon secretion (Patel,
1984; Thorens, 2014), we also examined the parasympathetic
innervation of glucagon-producing a cells. The density of VAChT
fibers innervating pancreatic a cells was similar between leptin-
and vehicle-treated mice (Figures S2A–S2C). Together, these
data indicate that prenatal leptin exposure has long-term effects
on the parasympathetic innervation of pancreatic b cells but
does not lead to a widespread disruption of the autonomic inputs
to the pancreas.
Injection of Leptin during Embryonic Life Causes Long-
Term Disturbances in Glucose Homeostasis
Because prenatal leptin exerted an enduring effect on b cell
innervation, we next examined whether it was associated with
disturbances in glucose homeostasis. The pre- and post-wean-
ing growth curves (body weights) of prenatally injected WT and
ob/ob mice were undistinguishable from those of vehicle-in-
jected mice (Figures 3A–3D). Consistent with these data, daily
food intake and body composition were similar between leptin-
treated and control mice (Figures S3A–S3C). However, clear
differences were observed in several indices of glucose homeo-
stasis. Compared with vehicle-treated ob/ob mice, ob/ob mice
that were prenatally treated with leptin displayed elevated levels
of glucose 60–120 min following a glucose challenge (Figure 3E).
However, glucose tolerance test results of the leptin-treated WT
mice were similar to those of the controls (Figure 3I). Neverthe-
less, WT mice that were prenatally exposed to leptin displayed
impaired insulin tolerance compared to control mice (Figure 3J).
These differences were not observed in leptin-treated ob/ob
mice (Figure 3F). Moreover, leptin-treated WT and ob/ob mice
displayed normal fed, fasting, and re-fed glucose levels (Figures
3G and 3K). In addition, serum insulin (Figures 3H and 3L),
glucagon (Figure S2D), and C-peptide levels (Figure S3D) were
similar between leptin-treated and control ob/ob mice. How-
ever, the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in leptin-treated
ob/ob mice was decreased compared to that in control mice
when measured 45 min after the glucose injection (Figure 3M).
In contrast, this defect in insulin secretion in leptin-injected
embryos was not observed upon L-arginine stimulation (Fig-
ure
3N).
Furthermore,
hepatic
gluconeogenesis
appeared
normal, because injection of pyruvate resulted in similar glucose
responses in leptin-treated and control mice (Figure 3O). Other
markers of liver function, such as hepatic triglyceride content
and free fatty acid levels, also appeared normal in prenatally
treated mice (Figures 3P and 3Q).
Leptin Acts Directly on Cholinergic Neurons in the
Hindbrain to Blunt Axon Growth
The parasympathetic nerve fibers that innervate the pancreas
mainly originate from hindbrain neurons located in the DMV
(Fox and Powley, 1986). Most of these fibers travel within the
vagus nerve and terminate on the pancreatic ganglia (Fox
and Powley, 1986). To identify leptin’s potential site of action,
we first examined where leptin was taken up by intracerebro-
ventricularly injecting fluorescently labeled bioactive leptin
(16 kDa) into embryos (Balland et al., 2014; Vauthier et al.,
2013). As early as 5 min after injection, fluorescent leptin
was observed in cells in the wall of the fourth ventricle (Fig-
ure 4A). By 45 min after injection, a significant amount of
fluorescently labeled leptin was detected in the hindbrain

also observed in the parenchyma and vessels of the spinal
cord near the cholinergic neurons of the ventral motor column
(Figure S4A). Less fluorescent leptin was observed in other
brain regions, including the hypothalamus (Figure S4B). Fluo-
rescently labeled leptin was also observed in peripheral tissue,
including the liver and pancreas, 45 min after injection (Figures

Consistent with a primary action of central leptin on hindbrain
neurons, relatively high levels of leptin receptor (Leprb) mRNA
were found in the embryonic hindbrain. At E12, Leprb mRNA
levels were two to four times higher in the hindbrain than in other
brain regions such as the ventral midbrain or hypothalamus (Fig-

embryos were 5- to 10-fold greater than those in E10–E12 em-
bryos (Figure 4C). During embryonic life, Leprb mRNA is also

We next examined the distribution of labeling for pSTAT3, a
commonly used surrogate marker of leptin receptor activation,
in embryos that received a central injection of leptin. After
45 min, robust pSTAT3 immunoreactivity was observed in the
DMV, and the distribution of pSTAT3-positive cells overlapped
with that of VAChT neurons (Figure 4D). In addition, central leptin
increased the number of pSTAT3-labeled cells in the ventral
motor column of the spinal cord, where cholinergic neurons
are located (Figure S4E). In contrast, pSTAT3 immunoreactivity
was not observed in other tissues that took up fluorescent leptin,
such as the hypothalamus, liver, and pancreas (Figures S4F–
S4H). However, it remains possible that leptin might activate
other canonical LepRb signaling pathways, such as mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-ki-
nase (PI3K)/Akt, in regions and tissues that do not exhibit
STAT3 phosphorylation after leptin administration. Nevertheless,
these results suggest that central leptin might influence the para-
sympathetic innervation of the pancreas by primarily acting, at
least in part, on hindbrain neurons.
To determine if leptin acts directly on preganglionic cholinergic
neurons of the hindbrain to influence axon growth, we next per-
formed a series of in vitro experiments in which hindbrain ex-
plants were microdissected, placed in a collagen matrix, and
exposed to leptin or vehicle. After 48 hr, the density of cholinergic
axons extending from hindbrain explants in which leptin was

DISCUSSION
Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the
autonomic nervous system are critical regulators of glucose
homeostasis (Ahre
´ n, 2000; Thorens, 2014; Woods and Porte,
1974). However, the mechanisms that underlie the development
of the autonomic nervous system in general, and of the parasym-
pathetic innervation of the endocrine pancreas in particular,
remain elusive. In the present study, we report that cholinergic
innervation of pancreatic islets develops during mid-gestation
under the influence of leptin. Our results indicate that prenatal
leptin decreases parasympathetic innervation of the endocrine
pancreas, which alters glucose homeostasis without affecting
body weight or body composition. These data are in good agree-
ment with a direct role of leptin in glucose regulation. Mice with a
genetic leptin deficiency (ob/ob mice) or leptin receptor defi-
ciency (db/db mice) display hyperphagia and obesity as well
as insulin resistance and diabetes. While increased food intake
and body adiposity clearly contribute to the impaired glucose
metabolism that is observed in these mouse models, several
observations suggest that leptin regulates glucose metabolism
independently of its effects on energy balance. Caloric restric-
tion has only a moderate beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity
and hyperglycemia in ob/ob and db/db mice (Morton et al.,
2005; Wyse and Dulin, 1970), and leptin administration to

 leptin-deficient mice ameliorates hyperglycemia and hyperinsu-
linemia (Farooqi et al., 1999; Pelleymounter et al., 1995), even
when differences in food intake are controlled for pair-feeding
(Hedbacker et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 1996). The exact mech-
anisms underlying the insulin resistance observed in leptin-in-
jected embryos remain to be investigated, but it is possible
that prenatal leptin alters glucose production in the liver and/or
glucose uptake by muscle. Our data are also in good agreement
with other studies that have reported an inhibitory action of leptin
on the parasympathetic system. For example, central leptin
administration in adult mice has been shown to reduce parasym-
pathetic outflow, causing changes in airway diameter and lung
function (Arteaga-Solis et al., 2013).
Leptin’s regulation of the parasympathetic innervation of the
pancreas likely involves direct effects on hindbrain neurons
rather than direct effects on the embryonic pancreas. Central
leptin injection induced STAT3 phosphorylation in DMV neurons,
but not in the pancreas. In addition, the hindbrain contains the
highest density of leptin receptors of any brain region, and cen-
tral injection of fluorescently labeled leptin resulted in rapid accu-
mulation of fluorescence in the hindbrain. Furthermore, direct
exposure of hindbrain explants to leptin inhibited cholinergic
axon growth. Notably, the developmental effects of prenatal lep-
tin appear to be restricted to the innervation of pancreatic b cells,
because the cholinergic innervation of pancreatic a cells was
unaffected by prenatal leptin. The parasympathetic nerve fibers
that innervate the pancreas originate mainly from the DMV, and
the majority of these fibers terminate on the pancreatic ganglia,
which, in turn, innervate pancreatic b cells (Fox and Powley,
1986). Therefore, it is likely that the reduction in the cholinergic
innervation of pancreatic b cells results from decreased innerva-
tion of the pancreatic ganglia by preganglionic autonomic fibers
that originate in the hindbrain and that distinct pancreatic ganglia
are responsible for the innervation of a and b cells. More gener-
ally, our data suggest that normal preganglionic innervation of
pancreatic ganglia is important for normal cholinergic innerva-
tion of islets by postganglionic neurons. In addition, we cannot
rule out the possibility that some of the perturbations in glucose
homeostasis that were observed after prenatal leptin administra-
tion resulted from changes in the autonomic innervation of the
liver, although liver function appeared normal in leptin-injected
embryos.
Leptin is one of the first major metabolic hormones to appear
during development. White adipose tissue (the main source of
leptin production in adult animals) is minimal at early ages, yet
mouse fetuses do contain significant leptin levels in their blood
as early as E12 (Udagawa et al., 2006; Y. Ishii and S.G.B., unpub-
lished data). Various tissues produce leptin during embryonic
development. On E13, high levels of leptin gene expression are
found in the fetal liver and cartilage/bone structures, followed
by cardiac expression between E16 and E18 (Hoggard et al.,
1997, 2000). In addition to being produced by the embryo itself,
dams also contain high levels of leptin during pregnancy, but
whether maternal leptin crosses the placenta and reaches the
embryo during early to mid-gestation (i.e., when brain devel-
opment is initiated) remains unclear. Circulating leptin levels
increase markedly during the postnatal period and exhibit a
‘‘surge’’ (Ahima et al., 1998). The inhibitory effect of leptin
on parasympathetic development during embryonic life differs
from its effect on hypothalamic neural projections during post-
natal life. During postnatal life, leptin acts as a powerful neurotro-
phic agent that promotes the formation of neural circuits that
originate in the arcuate nucleus (Bouret et al., 2012, 2004). The
mechanisms underlying the opposing effects of leptin on hypo-
thalamic and hindbrain axon growth remain to be investigated.
However, recent data have suggested that the transition from
stimulatory to inhibitory effects of leptin on neuronal activity oc-
curs in parallel with the acquisition of functional ATP-sensitive
potassium channels (Baquero et al., 2014), and these data sup-
port the hypothesis that leptin activates distinct membrane-
linked and intracellular pathways in hindbrain and hypothalamic
neurons during development. Prenatal leptin exposure could
also result in changes in insulin levels that could then, in turn,
indirectly affect the autonomic innervation of the pancreas. Sup-
porting this idea, central leptin administration in adult rats de-
creases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Muzumdar et al.,
2003). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that the ef-
fects of a perinatal high-fat diet on pancreatic parasympathetic
innervation and glucose-dependent insulin secretion depended
on hypothalamic insulin signaling (Vogt et al., 2014). However,
our in vitro experiments, which showed that exposing isolated
hindbrain explants to leptin blunted axon growth, support a
direct role of leptin in cholinergic axon growth.
In conclusion, our data show the importance of an optimal hor-
mone balance during prenatal life for lifelong glucose regulation
and correct organization of parasympathetic inputs to pancre-
atic islets. These findings might be important for physiopatho-
logical conditions that are associated with abnormally elevated
leptin levels during critical periods of growth and development.
For example, maternal obesity is associated with elevated levels
of leptin in both the maternal and fetal circulation (Luo et al.,
2013), and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong
association between maternal obesity and the offspring’s pre-
disposition to diabetes (Boney et al., 2005). Better understanding
of the relationship between prenatal leptin and the programming
of metabolic diseases will be crucial as we seek to develop inter-
ventional studies to ameliorate and hopefully reverse such meta-
bolic malprogramming.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
ob/ob mice and their WT littermates were produced in our breeding colony by
paring heterozygous male and female mice (JAX mice, stock 000632). The day
of conception (sperm-positive vaginal smear) was designated as E0. For all ex-
periments, on day one after birth, litter size was adjusted to six or seven pups
to ensure adequate and standardized nutrition until weaning. Only male mice
were studied. All animal procedures were conducted in compliance with and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Saban
Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles. For detailed infor-
mation regarding the analytical time points, determination of body weight and
composition, serum analyses, and assessment of glucose homeostasis, see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
VAChT, Synaptophysin, Tyrosine Hydroxylase, HNF4a, Insulin, and
Glucagon Immunohistochemistry and Image Analyses
For immunostaining of embryonic tissue, pregnant females were anesthe-
tized and the embryos collected at E12, E15, and E18. The embryos
42

 were then fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde. For immu-
nostaining of adult tissue, mice were transcardially perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Tissue sections were processed for immunofluores-
cence using standard procedures. The primary antibodies used for immu-
nohistochemistry were as follows: rabbit anti-VAChT (1:500; Synaptic
Systems), mouse anti-synaptophysin1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems), rabbit
anti-TH (1:2,000; Immunostar), goat anti-HNF4a (1:500; Santa Cruz), and
guinea-pig anti-insulin (1:500; Abcam). For detailed information regarding
image acquisition and quantification, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Isolated Hindbrain Explant Cultures
Brains were collected from E12 embryos. The hindbrain (consisting of the DMV
and NTS) was then carefully dissected from the rest of the brain under a ste-
reomicroscope. Explants (n = 5–6 cultures per group) were cultured onto a
rat tail collagen matrix (BD Biosciences) using standard procedures (Bouret
et al., 2004). After a 48-hr incubation with leptin (100 ng/ml; Peprotech), or
with vehicle, the explants were fixed in paraformaldehyde, and cholinergic
neurites extending from the explants were stained with rabbit anti-VAChT
(1:1,000; Synaptic Systems). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
additional details regarding image analysis.
Intra-embryonic Leptin Injections
Timed-pregnant mice carrying E12 ob/ob and WT embryos were anesthetized,
and the uterine horns were gently placed outside the abdominal cavity. Using a
Nanofil syringe with a 35G needle attachment (World Precision Instruments),
1 mg murine leptin (1 mg/ml; Peprotech) or vehicle (NaCl 0.9%) was then deliv-
ered into each embryo intracerebroventricularly. Each experiment included
offspring from at least 11–14 litters.
Fluorescent Leptin Assays
Using a Nanofil syringe with a 35G needle attachment (World Precision Instru-
ments), 1 mg fluorescently labeled bioactive leptin (Cisbio Bioassays) (Balland
et al., 2014; Vauthier et al., 2013) was intracerebroventricularly injected into
E12 embryos. Embryos were sacrificed 5 and 45 min later to assess tissue lep-
tin uptake by confocal microscopy.
pSTAT3 Immunohistochemistry
Leptin (1 mg; Peprotech) was intracerebroventricularly injected into E12 em-
bryos as described above. Controls received equivolume injections of vehicle
(0.9% NaCl). The embryos were collected 45 min later and fixed with a solution
of 2% paraformaldehyde. Frozen coronal (head) or sagittal (body) sections
were cut at 30 mm and processed for pSTAT3 immunostaining as previously
described (Bouret et al., 2012).
Statistical Analysis
All values are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0a). For each experiment, slides
were numerically coded to obscure the treatment group. Statistical signifi-
cance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test and two-
way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test when appropriate.
p % 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
