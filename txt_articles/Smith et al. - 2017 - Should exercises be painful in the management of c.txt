AbstrAct
background Chronic musculoskeletal disorders are 
a prevalent and costly global health issue. A new form 
of exercise therapy focused on loading and resistance 
programmes that temporarily aggravates a patient’s 
pain has been proposed. The object of this review 
was to compare the effect of exercises where pain 
is allowed/encouraged compared with non-painful 
exercises on pain, function or disability in patients 
with chronic musculoskeletal pain within randomised 
controlled trials.
Methods Two authors independently selected studies 
and appraised risk of bias. Methodological quality was 
evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment system was 
used to evaluate the quality of evidence.
results The literature search identified 9081 potentially 
eligible studies. Nine papers (from seven trials) with 
385 participants met the inclusion criteria. There was 
short- term significant difference in pain, with moderate 
quality evidence for a small effect size of −0.27 (−0.54 
to −0.05) in favour of painful exercises. For pain in the 
medium and long term, and function and disability in the 
short, medium and long term, there was no significant 
difference.
conclusion Protocols using painful exercises offer a 
small but significant benefit over pain-free exercises in 
the short term, with moderate quality of evidence. In 
the medium and long term there is no clear superiority 
of one treatment over another. Pain during therapeutic 
exercise for chronic musculoskeletal pain need not be 
a barrier to successful outcomes. Further research is 
warranted to fully evaluate the effectiveness of loading 
and resistance programmes into pain for chronic 
musculoskeletal disorders.

Musculoskeletal disorders are one of the most 
prevalent and costly disorders globally.1 2 Low 
back pain is considered the leading cause of years 
lived with disability worldwide, ahead of condi-
tions such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease and cancer, with a global point prevalence 
of 9.4%.3 4 Neck pain and other musculoskeletal 
pain ranks fourth and sixth in terms of years lived 
with disability, with a global point prevalence of 5% 
and 8%, 
respectively.5 6 In the UK, an estimated one 
in four people suffer from chronic musculoskel-
etal disorders,7 with an estimated economic conse-
quence of 8.8 
million working days lost.8
Previous systematic reviews have assessed the 
effectiveness of various interventions for muscu-
loskeletal disorders, 
including 
pharmaceutical 
therapies,9–12 
psychological-based 
therapies13–16 
and physical-based therapies, including manual 
therapy17–19 and exercise.16 20–24 These have all 
presented poor to moderate results in terms of 
effectiveness at improving pain and function, and 
have identified limitations in the quality of included 
trials when drawing conclusions.
There is a high level of uncertainty and lack of 
sufficient level 1 evidence on which to base treat-
ment for people with musculoskeletal disorders. 
A systematic review of self-management interven-
tions for chronic musculoskeletal pain concluded 
that strong evidence existed that changes in the 
psychological factors, self-efficacy and depression 
were predictors of outcomes, irrespective of the 
intervention delivered, and strong evidence existed 
that positive changes in patients’ pain catastroph-
ising and physical activity were mediating factors.25 
Experimental studies have also demonstrated that 
stimulus context and the emotional response to 
pain affect the experience of pain,26–28 and have led 
to the development of desensitisation interventions 
for chronic musculoskeletal disorders.29–31
It has been proposed that modern treat-
ment therapies for chronic musculoskeletal pain 
 
and disorders should be designed around loading 
and resistance programmes targeting movements and 
activities that can temporarily reproduce and aggra-
vate patients’ pain and symptoms.31–33 Pain does not 
correlate with tissue damage,34 and psychological 
factors such as catastrophising and fear avoidance 
behaviours play an important role in the shaping of 
the physiological responses to pain, and therefore the 
development and maintenance of chronic pain.35 It is 
thought that such an exercise programme could facil-
itate the reconceptualisation of pain by addressing 
fear avoidance and catastrophising beliefs within a 
framework of ‘hurt not equalling harm’.36 37 Through 
this, proponents support the prescription of exercises 
into pain for chronic musculoskeletal pain and disor-
ders.31 37 38 We define ‘exercise into pain’ as a thera-
peutic exercise where pain is encouraged or allowed.
No previous systematic reviews have evaluated 
the effectiveness of exercises into pain for chronic 
musculoskeletal pain. Therefore the object of this 
review was to compare the effect of exercises into 
pain compared with non-painful exercises on pain, 
function or disability in patients with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain within randomised controlled

instructions for patients to experience pain, or where patients 
were told it was acceptable and safe to experience pain, and to 
compare any difference in contextual factors and prescription

MEthOds
This systematic review followed the recommendations of the 
PRISMA statement,39 and was registered with the International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; http://
www. 
crd. 
york. 
ac. 
uk/ 
prospero/, reference CRD42016038882).
search strategy
An electronic database search was conducted on titles and abstract 
from inception to October 2016 on the following databases: the 
Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, the Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane 
Library, Embase, Medline, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. 
For the keywords and keywords search strategy used, please see 
table 1. The database searches were accompanied by hand searches 
of the reference list of included articles, and the grey literature and 
ongoing trials were searched using the following databases: Open 
Grey, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform,  
Clini-
calTrials. 
gov and the bjsports-2016-097383 portfolio.
For inclusion, the studies had to meet the following criteria: 
adults recruited from the general population with any musculo-
skeletal pain or disorder greater than 3 
months; participants with 
pain suggestive of non-musculoskeletal pain, for example, head-
ache, migraine, bowel/stomach pain, cancer, fibromyalgia, chest 
pain, and breathing difficulties were excluded. Studies had to 
have a primary treatment arm of therapeutic exercises that was 
advised to be purposively painful, or where pain was allowed 
or tolerated. The comparison group had to use therapeutic 
exercises that were pain-free. Included studies were required to 
report pain, disability or function. Studies had to be full RCT 
published in English. Studies that were not randomised or quasi-
random were excluded.
study selection
One reviewer (BES) undertook the searches. Titles and abstracts 
were screened by one reviewer (BES), with potential eligible 
papers retrieved and independently screened by two reviewers 
(BES and PH). Initial inclusion agreement was 81%, and using 
Cohen’s statistic method the kappa agreement was k=0.47, 
which is considered ‘fair to moderate’ agreement.40–42 All initial 
disagreements were due to intervention criteria, specifically the 
levels of pain during the therapeutic exercises in each interven-
tion arm,43–50 and were resolved through consensus. Three trials 
needed further information with regard to their control exercise 
to ascertain if they met the inclusion criteria, and all three were 
contacted.51–53 All three responded with further information, 
and after discussion there was consensus to include two of the 
three trials.51 52
data extraction
The following data were extracted from the included articles: 
trial design, participant information, intervention and control 
exercise, setting, follow-up periods and outcome data.54 The 
data were independently extracted and transcribed to a stan-
dard table by one reviewer (BES), and then 25% of the data 
were independently checked by a second reviewer (PH). Effec-
tiveness was judged in the short term (≤3 months from rando-
misation), medium term (>3 
and<12 months) and long term 
(≥12 months), as recommended by the 2009 Updated Method 
Guidelines for Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Back Review 
Group.55
Quality assessment
Each included study was appraised independently by two 
reviewers (BES and PH) for methodological quality using the 
Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised clinical trials.56 The 
tool was originally developed in 2008, and updated in 2011, 
and is based on seven key bias domains57: sequence generation 
and allocation concealment (both within the domain of selection 
bias or allocation bias), blinding of participants and personnel 
(performance bias), blinding of outcome assessors (detection 
bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and selective 
reporting (reporting bias).56 For each domain the reviewers 
judged the risk of bias as ‘high’, ‘low’ or ‘unclear’. Percentage 
agreement between the two reviewers for the individual risk of 
bias domains for the Cochrane risk of bias tool was 86%, with a 
kappa of κ=0.76, which is considered ‘substantial or good’,40–42 
and disagreements were resolved through consensus.
We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the overall

quality of the body of evidence in each pooled analysis.58 We 
did not evaluate the publication bias domain in this review as 
it is not recommended to assess funnel plot asymmetry with a 
meta-analysis of fewer than 10 trials.59 A GRADE profile was 
completed for each pooled estimate. Where only single trials 
were available, evidence from studies with <400 participants 
was downgraded for inconsistency and imprecision and rated as 
low-quality evidence. Three reviewers assessed these factors for 
each outcome and agreed by consensus (BES, PH and TOS).
The quality of evidence was defined as the following: (1) high 
quality—further research is unlikely to change our confidence in 
the estimate of effect; the Cochrane risk of bias tool identified 
no risks of bias and all domains in the GRADE classification were 
fulfilled; (2) moderate quality—further research is likely to have 
an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, 
and one of the domains in the GRADE classification was not 
fulfilled; (3) low quality—further research is likely to have an 
important impact on our confidence and is likely to change the 
estimate; two of the domains were not fulfilled in the GRADE 
classification; and (4) very low quality—we are uncertain about 
the estimate; three of the domains in the GRADE classification 
were not fulfilled.60 61
statistical analysis
Clinical heterogeneity was assessed through visual examination 
of the data extraction table on details related to participant char-
acteristics, intervention, study design and process in the included 
studies. Based on this assessment, the reviewers judged there to 
be low clinical heterogeneity and accordingly it was appropriate 
to perform a meta-analysis where feasible. The primary outcome 
was a measure of pain, disability or function. As pain scores were 
reported on different scales, we used the standardised mean 
difference (SMD).62 We a priori defined effect size interpreta-
tion as 0.2 for a ‘small’ effect size, 0.5 for a ‘medium’ effect size 
and 0.8 for a ‘large’ effect size, as suggested by Cohen (1988).63 
If data were not available, the associated corresponding author 
was contacted. Failing this, the mean and SD were estimated, 
assuming normal distribution, from medians and IQRs.64 Statis-
tical between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I22 
statistic. We considered 0%–25% as low, 26%–74% 
moderate 
and 75% and over as high statistical heterogeneity.65 When 
outcomes presented with low statistical heterogeneity, data were 
pooled using a fixed-effects model.66 When analyses presented 
with moderate or high statistical heterogeneity, a DerSimonian 
and Laird random-effects model was adopted.67
All data analyses were performed using the OpenMetaAnalyst 
software.68
sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary and 
secondary analyses using only trials that presented with a low 
risk of bias.56 In addition we carried out a sensitivity analysis 
to assess the impact of studies where mean and SD were esti-
mated from medians and IQRs, and outcome measures of pain 
were pooled scores set within pain domains from patient-re-
ported outcome measures, for example, the Shoulder Pain and 
Disability Index (SPADI).69
rEsults
study identification
The search results are presented in figure 1. The database 
search produced 9081 results, with no additional findings from 
reference list searches or unpublished searches. After duplicates 
were removed, 37 papers were appropriate for full-text review.
After full-text review, 28 articles were excluded, 5 were due to 
participants not meeting the criteria, 26 because the intervention 
did not meet the criteria, 3 because of study design not meeting 
criteria, and 1 due to inappropriate outcome measures. Some 
articles were excluded for multiple reasons. Therefore nine arti-
cles were included in the final review. Of the included articles, 
there were two occurrences of the same trial reporting different 
time points over two publications.43 70–72
characteristics of included trials
A summary of the characteristics and main findings of the 
included trials can be found in table 2.
The two occurrences of the same trial reporting different time 
points over two articles were analysed as single trials to prevent 
multiplicity in analyses.43 70–72 All trials investigated home-based 
exercises, had a roughly even composition of women and men 
(46% women), with similar mean ages of participants (mean age 
47, range 19–83). One trial included low back pain,43 72 three 
included shoulder pain,47 52 70 71 two included Achilles pain73 74 
and one included plantar heel pain.51
Three trials used a Visual Analogue Scale to measure 
pain,43 70–72 74 two trials used the SPADI,47 52 one used the Knee 
Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),73 and one 
used the Foot Function Index (FFI) including pain at worse and 
pain on first step on a numerical rating scale (0–10).51
Where pain outcomes were included within patient-reported 
outcome measures, these data were extracted.47 52 73 T
wo trials 
that used the SPADI had insufficient data in the publication to 
complete a meta-analysis for pain,47 52 and both were contacted 
and asked to supply pain domain data. Littlewood et al52 replied 
and provided all the available data; however, Maenhout et al47 
did not respond. One trial reported outcomes in medians and 
IQRs,74 and was contacted and asked for further data. They

61 patients recruited from a shoulder 
surgeon’s clinic in Belgium (mean age 39.8, 
41% female);
inclusion criteria included (a) adults with 
>3 months of shoulder pain, (b) painful arc, 
(c) 2 out of 3 impingement tests, (d) pain on 
palpation of rotator cuff tendons
Physiotherapy and home setting
1. n=31; the same exercises as group 2, plus a heavy loaded eccentric exercise 
of abduction within the scapular plane; 3 sets of 15 repetitions, such that the 
patient experiences pain on the last set, up to 5/10 Visual Analogue Scale, such 
that the pain subsided by the following morning.
2. n=30; pain-free, traditional rotator cuff exercises of internal and external 
rotation with a resisted rubber band; performed once a day, with 3 sets of 10 
repetitions;
both groups had exercise prescription and monitoring through 9 physiotherapy 
appointments over 12 weeks
Main outcome of the SPADI (0–100) at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks
Group 1: mean at baseline 44.3 (SD 11.5), 6 weeks 17.7 (SD 12.0) and 12 weeks 14.5

performed twice a day, for 12 weeks; 1 follow-up appointment at 3 months; 
pain-free standing stretches for gastrocnemius and soleus; 5 repetitions of 30 s 
each
Outcome measures were tenderness on palpation, ultrasound and pain, as measured 
by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (0–4) and patient’s global 
assessment; follow-up was at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks and 1 year
Group 1: mean pain domain from KOOS at baseline 1.6 (SD 0.6), 3 weeks 0.1 (SD 0.1), 
6 weeks 0.3 (SD 0.1), 9 weeks 0.4 (SD 0.2), 12 weeks 0.4 (SD 0.2) and 1 year score was 
1.0 (SD 0.2)
 Group 2: mean pain domain from KOOS at baseline 1.6 (SD 0.6), 3 weeks 0.2 (SD 0.1), 
6 weeks 0.3 (SD 0.1), 9 weeks 0.3 (SD 0.2), 12 weeks 0.4 (SD 0.2) and 1 year score was 
0.7 (SD 0.2)
There were significant improvements in all dimensions of the KOOS compared with 
baseline, with no differences between group differences.

2 groups:
1. High-load strengthening 
exercises
2. Stretching exercises
48 patients recruited from a university 
hospital, regional hospital and private clinic 
in Denmark (mean age 46, 66% female);
inclusion criteria included (a) adults with 
plantar fasciitis >3 months, (b) pain on 
palpation, (c) local thickening >4 mm on 
ultrasound
Home based exercises
1. n=24; information leaflet, heel inserts and a prescription of a high-load 
strength programme; consisting of single calf raises with a towel rolled 
up under the toes for maximum toe extension, activating the windlass 
mechanism; each calf raises was 3 s up, 2 s pause, 3 s down; weight was added 
in rucksacks, starting at 12 repetition maximum for three sets, and slowly 
progressed over 3 months; patients were advised to perform the exercise every 
other day; exercises were allowed to be painful, with no postincrease in pain.
2. n=24; information leaflet, heel inserts and a prescription of pain-free* 
plantar-specific stretches; patients were asked to stretch the plantar fascia in a 
cross-legged position by extending their toes, hold for 10 s, 10 times, 3× a day 
for 3 months
Primary outcome was Foot Function Index at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, including pain at 
worse and pain on first step on a numerical rating scale (0–10).
Mean scores for group 1 pain at worse at baseline was 7.9 (SD 1.7), 1 month 6.1 (95% 
CI 5.1 to 7.2), 3 months 3.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 4.7), 6 months 2.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.6) and 
12 months 2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.0). Mean scores for group 2 pain at worse at baseline 
was 7.5 (SD 1.6), 1 month 6.1 (95% CI 5.2 to 7.1), 3 months 6.1 (95% CI 4.4 to 7.7), 
6 months 3.4 (95% CI 2.0 to 4.7) and 12 months 1.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 3.0).
At 3 months group 1 had significantly lower pain scores than group 2 (p<0.05). At 
months 1, 6 and 12, there was no significant difference between groups.

2 groups:
1. Eccentric exercises
2. Regular concentric/
eccentric exercises
40 patients recruited from mailings to 
hospitals, clinics and sports clubs in Sweden 
(mean age 45, 23% female); inclusion 
criteria included (a) adults with Achilles pain 
>3 months
Clinic and home setting
1. n=22; progressive eccentric exercise programme to be performed 2× a 
day, plus three sets of six different stretching exercises, 20 s each, as well 
as balance, toe/heel walking exercises; weekly physiotherapy contact for 
12 weeks; pain was allowed during the exercises up to 5/10 Visual Analogue 
Scale, such that the pain subsided by the following morning with no morning 
stiffness
2. n=18. 3 x a day of regular concentric and eccentric calf strengthening, plus 
two sets of the stretching exercises from group 1. Physiotherapy contacts 3–5 
x during the 12 weeks. Exercises must be pain-free.
Outcomes of pain on palpation (Visual Analogue Scale) (0–100 mm) taken at baseline, 
6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. Other outcomes included pain on walking and pain on stairs 
(yes/no), various objective measures, plus a non-validated functional questionnaire
Median±IQR scores for pain on palpation for group 1 at baseline was 49±26.2, 
6 weeks 40±27.5, 3 months 35±24.8 and 6 months 21±20.
Median±IQR scores for group 2 at baseline was 27±21.5, 6 weeks 20±20, 3 months 
31±26 and 6 months 9±17.5.
There was a significant decrease in pain on palpation in both treatment groups; no 
significant differences between groups were seen.

were unable to supply this, so the mean and SD were estimated 
assuming normal distribution.64
All seven trials recorded short-term follow-up of pain, four 
trials recorded medium-term follow-up of pain,47 51 52 74 and five 
trials recorded long-term follow-up for pain.43 51 52 70–73
trial quality and bias
The two papers reporting long-term outcomes for the trials that 
reported different time points made reference to the short-term 
outcome papers with regard to design parameters; therefore, 
trial quality and bias were assessed accordingly.43 70–72
No trial had greater than three ‘high risk’ of bias scores for a 
domain (figure 2).
The greatest risk of bias was with the blinding of participants 
and personnel (100%) (figure 3). The greatest amount of uncer-
tainty was with regard to selective reporting bias, as many of the 
trials failed to include trials register details, or protocol details 
(44%).47 51 73 74 Other common areas of bias with the included 
trials were with attrition bias, one trial failed to adequately describe 
attrition,43 and two trials had large dropout rates52 73; however, 
Littlewood et al52 received a ‘low risk’ score as their participant 
attrition was balanced across the intervention and control groups,75 
and an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The risk of bias 
assessment tool highlights common trial write-up errors, with a 
number of papers failing to give an appropriate level of detail to 
adequately assess selection bias risk (33%).43 47 74
narrative synthesis of disability and function outcomes
Of the seven trials, six reported some form of patient-reported 
outcome measure of disability or function. One reported 
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire,43 72 one reported 
Constant-Murley and the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and 
Hand score,70 71 two reported the SPADI,47 52 one reported the 
KOOS,73 and one reported the FFI.51 With the exception of 
Rathleff et al,51 there was clinically significant improvements in 
all outcomes, with no clear superiority. At 3-month follow-up for 
Rathleff et al,51 the intervention group had a statistically signif-
icant lower FFI than the control group (p=0.016). At 1, 6 and 
12 months, there were no differences between groups (p>0.34).
contextual factors
With regard to the parameters of pain in the exercise inter-
vention the participants were advised to adhere to, each trial 
gave different instructions, the key differences being if pain was 
allowed43 51 72 74 or recommended.47 52 70 71 73 In addition other 
differences were if an acceptable level of pain measured on a 
pain scale was advised,47 70 71 74 and a time frame for the pain 
to subside by, for instance, if the pain had to subside immedi-
ately,43 51 52 72 by the next session70 71 or by the next day.47 73 74 
Clinically significant improvements in patient-reported outcome 
measures were reported across all interventions and control 
exercises, and all time points. It is not clear from the data if one 
approach was superior to the others.
Meta-analysis of pain
Short-term results
Six trials with 385 participants reported post-treatment effect on 
pain. Combining the results of these trials demonstrated signif-
icant benefit (SMD) of exercises into pain compared with pain-
free exercises for musculoskeletal pain in the short term, with a 
small effect size of −0.28 (95% CI −0.49 to −0.08; figure 4). 
Statistical heterogeneity was negligible, I2=0%. The quality of 
evidence (GRADE) was rated as ‘low quality’ due to trial design 
and low participant numbers (table 3).
For sensitivity analysis in the short term, we repeated the 
meta-analysis, removing two trials that used a patient-reported 
outcome measures index and had high dropout rates,52 73 and 
the Silbernagel et al74 trial where the mean and SD were esti-
mated from medians and IQRs. The results of the data synthesis 
produced very similar results, with a small effect size of −0.27 
(95% CI −0.54 to −0.05), with low statistical heterogeneity 
of I2=22%. The quality of evidence (GRADE) was rated as 
‘moderate quality’ due to low participant numbers (table 3).
Medium-term results
In the medium-term follow-up, meta-analysis demonstrated 
significant benefit (SMD) for exercises into pain compared with 
pain-free exercises for musculoskeletal pain, with a medium 
effect size of −0.59 (95% CI −1.03 to −0.15) (see figure 5). The 
statistical heterogeneity was moderate, I2=50%. The quality of 
evidence (GRADE) was rated as ‘low quality’ due to trial design 
and low participant numbers (table 3).
Sensitivity analysis was not possible for medium-term results 
as two trials were excluded, one for using a patient-reported 
outcome measures index,51 and one due to means and SD being 
estimated from medians and IQRs.74 The one remaining trial 
showed no significant difference in the medium term.51 The 
quality of evidence (GRADE) was rated as ‘low quality’ due to it 
being only from a single trial (table 3).

review
Long-term results
In the long term follow-up, meta-analysis demonstrated no statis-
tical difference between exercises into pain and pain-free exercises, 
with an effect size of 0.01 (95% CI −0.39 to 0.41) (figure 6). The 
statistical heterogeneity was high, I2=70%. The quality of evidence 
(GRADE) was rated as ‘very low quality’ due to trial design, hetero-
geneity and low participant numbers (table 3).
For sensitivity analysis in the long term, we repeated the 
meta-analysis, removing the two trials that used a patient-re-
ported outcome measures index.52 73 The results of the data 
synthesis found no statistical difference between exercises into 
pain and pain-free exercises, with an effect size of 0.13 (95% 
CI −0.14 to 0.40). The statistical heterogeneity was negligible, 
I2=0%. The quality of evidence (GRADE) was rated as ‘moderate 
quality’ due to low participant numbers (table 3).
dIscussIOn
summary of main findings
There was a significant short-term benefit for exercises into pain 
over pain-free exercises for patient-reported outcomes of pain, with 
a small effect size and moderate quality of evidence. There appears 
to be no difference at medium-term or long term follow-up, with 
the quality of the evidence rated as moderate to low.
clinical and research implications
Traditionally, healthcare practitioners have been reluctant to 
encourage patients to continue with exercise into pain when they 
are treating chronic musculoskeletal pain,76 with some research 
suggesting clinicians’ fear being the primary deterrent.77 The results 
of our systematic review show that there does not appear to be a 
scientific basis for this fear in relation to outcome measures of pain, 
and also potentially function and disability. This is an important 
point when considering what advice is given on any short-term 
exacerbations of musculoskeletal pain during physical activity or 
exercise by healthcare practitioners, particularly when physical 
inactivity is one of the 10 leading risk factors for death world-
wide,78 and when an estimated €1.9 
billion a year in healthcare and 
€9.4 
billion a year in economic costs in the UK are attributable to 
physical inactivity.79
A theoretical rationale for a positive response to exercises into 
pain is the positive impact on the central nervous system.31 37 
Specifically, the exercise addresses psychological factors such as fear 
avoidance, kinesiophobia and catastrophising, and is set within a 
framework of ‘hurt not equalling harm’, thus, in time, reducing the 
overall sensitivity on the central nervous system, with a modified 
pain output.31 37 The exercise-induced endogenous analgesia effect

is thought to occur due to a release of endogenous opioids and 
activation of spinal inhibitory mechanisms.80–84 However, a recent 
systematic review has established that no firm conclusions could be 
reached about pain modulation during exercise therapy for chronic 
musculoskeletal pain.85 Indeed one experimental study has shown 
a dysfunction of endogenous analgesia in patients with musculo-
skeletal pain,86 and therefore exercising non-painful body parts 
with patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain has been recom-
mended.87 However, it is worth noting that empirical data within 
this field are greatly lacking, and this systematic review shows that 
painful exercises may even improve the clinical outcomes. Addi-
tionally, exercise prescription in the included trials was primarily 
based on strength and conditioning principles, with the exception 
of Littlewood et al,52 suggesting a tissue-focused approach, and 
therefore could still have been giving a ‘hurt is harm’ message to 
the majority of participants.
Significant improvements in patient-reported pain can be 
achieved with a range of contextual factors, such as varying degrees 
of pain experiences and postrecovery time for therapeutic exercise. 
In addition to the aspect of pain, an important difference between 
the intervention arm and the control arm is the higher loads, or 
levels of resistance, employed with the exercises into pain, and it 
is unknown if the difference in responses can be attributable to 
these two elements of the different exercise programmes. Research 
has shown a ‘dose response’ to exercise for musculoskeletal pain—
the more incremental exercise (with appropriate recovery period) 
a person does the greater his/her improvements in pain88–90; the 
short-term benefits of exercises into pain over pain-free exercises 
could be explained by this dose effect, or response to load/resis-
tance. However to our knowledge the optimal ‘dose’ of thera-
peutic exercise for musculoskeletal pain has not been established. 
Furthermore, little is known if it is possible or appropriate to iden-
tify individuals most suitable to exercise interventions.
Our review only investigated patient-reported outcome 
measures of pain and function/disability. It has been hypothesised 
that exercise therapy, where it has been advised that the experience 
of pain is safe and allowed, may address other patient-reported 
outcome measures—fear avoidance, self-efficacy and catastroph-
ising beliefs37 38—and therefore may lead to improvements in func-
tion, quality of life and disability, despite pain levels. Unfortunately 
none of the trials included in this review recorded the level of pain 
patients actually experienced during their exercise programme, 
preventing any detailed attempt to fully explain any mechanisms 
of effect. This aspect of exercise prescription clearly warrants 
further investigation in relation to chronic musculoskeletal pain. 
Any future trials should consider the role of pain with exercises 
and clearly define the parameters employed to ensure translation 
of findings into practice and further evaluation of optimal ‘dosage’.
strengths and limitations of included trials
We chose not to perform subgroup analyses by anatomical region 
and/or tissue structures. The labelling of musculoskeletal struc-
tures as sources of pain has been debated for many years, with 
polarising opinions.91 92 However, the diagnostic labelling of 
patients into tissue-specific pathology characteristically suffers 
from poor reliability and validity.93–98 A strength of this review is 
that despite the trials including subjects suffering from musculo-
skeletal pain at different body locations, there exists low statis-
tical heterogeneity at short-term follow-up and for the sensitivity 
analyses carried out.
The overall quality of the included papers can be considered 
relativity high, with only three domains in the Cochrane risk of 
bias tool (disregarding blinding of participants) demonstrating 
clear risk of bias across all domains for all trials. However taking 
into account other factors assessed with the GRADE analysis, the 
quality of the evidence was rated as moderate to low. Therefore 
our results can be considered to have moderate to low internal 
validity, with future research likely to alter our conclusions.
The main source of bias within the included trials were blinding; 
no trial blinded the participants. Knowledge of group assignment 
may affect participants’ behaviour, for example with patient-re-
ported outcome measures such as pain scales or compliance with 
therapy interventions.99 However, it is accepted that blinding 
in physiotherapy and physical intervention trials is difficult to 
achieve.24
Another limitation of the included trials is the high level of 
attrition suffered by some of the trials in both treatment arms. 
For example Littlewood et al52 suffered from 51% dropout at 
12-month follow-up. A high level of attrition can overestimate the 
treatment effect size and could bias the results of our meta-anal-
ysis. However, we minimised the risk of bias on our results by 
conducting a sensitivity analysis on trials with a large dropout, 
identified using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed level of 
evidence using the GRADE classification.
limitations of this review
For pragmatic reasons one reviewer screened titles and abstracts. 
An extensive literature search was carried out, with two reviewers 
independently screening full texts for inclusion, and a sample of 
the data extraction independently verified. Additionally an attempt 
was made to retrieve unpublished trials; however, it may be that 
not all trials were retrieved, particularly considering we did not 
search for papers published in languages other than English and 
US spelling was used in the search terms. This review excluded 
trials where participants had a diagnosis of more widespread pain 
disorders like fibromyalgia.

review
cOnclusIOn
The results of this systematic review indicates that protocols 
using exercises into pain offer a small but significant benefit over 
pain-free exercises in the short term, with moderate quality of the 
evidence for outcomes of pain in chronic musculoskeletal pain 
in adults. There appears to be no difference at medium-term or 
long-term follow-up, with moderate to low quality of evidence, 
demonstrating pain need not be ruled out or avoided in adults 
with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
What are the findings?
 
► Protocols using exercises into pain for chronic 
musculoskeletal pain offer a small but significant benefit over 
pain-free exercises in the short term.
 
► Adults with musculoskeletal pain can achieve significant 
improvements in patient-reported outcomes with varying 
degrees of pain experiences and postrecovery time with 
therapeutic exercise.
 
► Pain during therapeutic exercise for chronic musculoskeletal 
pain need not be a barrier to successful outcomes.
 
► Protocols using exercises into pain typically have higher loads 
and dose of exercise.
