Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Diabetes has been shown to be a risk factor for some cancers. Whether diabetes confers the same excess risk of
cancer, overall and by site, in women and men is unknown.
Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed for cohort studies published up to December 2016. Selected studies
reported sex-specific relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between diabetes and cancer adjusted at least for age in both
sexes. Random-effects meta-analyses with inverse-variance weighting were used to obtain pooled sex-specific RRs and women-
to-men ratios of RRs (RRRs) for all-site and site-specific cancers.
Results Data on all-site cancer events (incident or fatal only) were available from 121 cohorts (19,239,302 individuals; 1,082,592
events). The pooled adjusted RR for all-site cancer associated with diabetes was 1.27 (95% CI 1.21, 1.32) in women and 1.19
(1.13, 1.25) in men. Women with diabetes had ~6% greater risk compared with men with diabetes (the pooled RRR was 1.06,
95% CI 1.03, 1.09). Corresponding pooled RRRs were 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for all-site cancer incidence and 1.03 (0.99, 1.06) for all-
site cancer mortality. Diabetes also conferred a significantly greater RR in women than men for oral, stomach and kidney cancer,
and for leukaemia, but a lower RR for liver cancer.
Conclusions/interpretation Diabetes is a risk factor for all-site cancer for both women and men, but the excess risk of cancer
associated with diabetes is slightly greater for women than men. The direction and magnitude of sex differences varies by location
of the cancer.

Introduction
Cancer is the second leading causes of death in the world [1].
In 2015, there were 17.5 million incident cancer cases and 8.7
million cancer deaths globally, and it is estimated that one in
four women and one in three men develop cancer during their
lifetime [2]. The incidence of cancer is expected to increase in
the next decades, emphasising the importance of efficient pre-
vention and treatment of cancer worldwide.
The prevalence of diabetes has also grown rapidly. In 2015,
one in 11 adults (415 million) were reported to have diabetes,
five million deaths were attributed to diabetes, and 12% of
global health expenditure was spent on diabetes and its

 complications [3]. Diabetes has been associated with the risk of
all-site and some site-specific cancers in several systematic
reviews and meta-analyses [4–13]. However, only a minority
of these associations are based on robust supporting evidence
without question of significant bias [14]. To date, there has
been no systematic overview of the evidence available on sex
differences in the association between diabetes and cancer. We
have previously published compelling evidence that women
with diabetes are at an increased risk of stroke [15], coronary
heart disease [16] and dementia [17] compared with their male
peers. We now question whether this is also true for cancer. In
this study, we conducted the most comprehensive systematic
review and meta-analysis, to date, to estimate the relative effect
of diabetes on the risk of cancer in women compared with men.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria A systematic search was
performed in PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/) on 23 December 2016 using a combined text
word and medical subject heading search strategy (electronic
supplementary material [ESM] Table 1). The reference lists of
identified reports were also checked for other potentially
relevant studies.
Observational cohort studies in general populations were
included if they had provided relative risks (RRs), or equiva-
lents, for the association between diabetes and cancer in both
women and men. Studies were excluded if they had not
adjusted at least for age or did not provide information about
the variability around the point estimate, or if they only had
data for one sex. In case of duplicate reports from the same
study, the study providing the longest follow-up or the highest
number of cases was included. We also used individual par-
ticipant data from the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies
Collaboration (APCSC) [18], treated as two separate combi-
nations of data from cohorts in Asia and cohorts from
Australia or New Zealand, as in our previous work [15, 16].
One author (TO) did the search and extracted the data.
Uncertainties regarding the inclusion or exclusion of articles
and data extraction were discussed by all authors and resolved
by mutual consent. The meta-analysis was done in accordance
with the PRISMA criteria [19].
Data extraction and statistical analysis The primary endpoint
was all-site cancer events (incident or, if this was all that was
presented, mortal only). The secondary endpoints were all-site
cancer incidence (i.e. omitting studies that only reported mor-
tality), all-site cancer mortality and, for those cancers that
could present in both sexes, site-specific cancer events, site-
specific incidence and site-specific mortality. In sensitivity
analysis we also compared all-site cancer incidence and mor-
tality when restricting to the studies that reported both.
The primary metrics were the pooled adjusted RRs and the
women-to-men ratios of RRs (RRRs) for individuals with dia-
betes vs those without diabetes. For each study, we extracted the
sex-specific RRs and 95% CIs for individuals with diabetes vs
those without diabetes, from which we estimated the RRRs and

 95% CIs. To include the largest set of individuals and cancer
endpoints, studies that reported either age-adjusted or multiple-
adjusted (maximum-available-adjusted, i.e. the maximum set of
adjustments available for each study) results were included in
our primary analyses. In pooling multiple-adjusted results, the
set of adjustments made were allowed to vary by study, but had
to include at least one other risk factor for cancer, in addition to
age [15, 16]. We obtained pooled estimates of sex-specific RRs
across studies using random-effects meta-analyses applied on
the loge scale. Individual studies were weighted according to
the inverse variance of loge RRs. The same method was used
to pool the RRRs.
The I2 statistic was used to estimate the percentage of var-
iability across studies due to between-study heterogeneity and
the Q test was used to assess whether there was a significant
lack of homogeneity. The possibility of publication bias was
explored using funnel plots and Egger’s and Begg’s tests.
Random-effects meta-regression analyses were used to test for
differences between pre-assigned subgroups: study region
(Asia or Non-Asia), year of baseline study (pre-1985 or 1986
onwards, and also examined as a continuous variable), ascer-
tainment of diabetes (self-reported only or others), type of dia-
betes (type 1 or type 2, where studies which did not differentiate
type were classified as type 2), level of adjustment (age-adjust-
ed or multiple-adjusted), and study quality (the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale [20] [ESM Table 2], ≥7 or <7 points, and also
examined as a continuous variable). Post hoc, we also consid-
ered absolute risk difference, examined as a categorical and
continuous variable) (ESM Table 3). A p value of below 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant in analyses for the
primary analyses, i.e. all-site cancer. As many statistical tests
were envisaged, a p value of below 0.01 was taken to denote
significance for site-specific cancers. All analyses were per-
formed using Stata software (release 13; StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA).
Results
Of the 6371 articles identified through the systematic search,
371 articles qualified for full-text evaluation, and 107 articles
provided summary data on the association between diabetes
and the risk of cancer for both sexes [21–127]. In addition, 36
cohorts with individual participant data from the APCSC were
included (Fig. 1).
Characteristics of the studies that reported the association
between diabetes and all-site cancer incidence or mortality are
shown in Table 1 and ESM Table 4. Data on all-site cancer
were available from 47 studies, involving 121 cohorts,
19,239,302 individuals (not counting one study [25] that did
not state the total number of participants), and 1,082,592
events (not counting one study [65] that did not state the total
number of cancer events).
The maximum-available-adjusted pooled sex-specific RR
estimates for combined fatal and non-fatal cancer associated
with diabetes were 1.27 (95% CI 1.21, 1.32, p < 0.001) for
women and 1.19 (1.13, 1.25, p < 0.001) for men (Fig. 2).
The pooled women-to-men RRR was 1.06 (1.03, 1.09, p <
0.001, Fig. 3). The I2 statistic for heterogeneity between stud-
ies was 66.7%, with no evidence of publication bias (Egger’s
test p = 0.13, Begg’s test p = 0.16, ESM Fig. 1). The corre-
sponding RRR was 1.06 (1.02, 1.11, p = 0.005) for type 1

If mean values of age or follow-up year were unavailable, median or range was extracted
Wideroff et al was not included in meta-analysis as they did not provide sufficiently accurate CIs for RRs
Studies by Hsu et al, Adami et al, Walker et al, and the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study, National Diabetes Services Scheme (type 1 diabetes), Takayama study and Västerbotten
Intervention Project were excluded from the meta-analysis of primary outcome (all-site cancer) and included in either of the meta-analyses of all-site cancer incidence or mortality only, because of the
overlapping of individuals with other studies

 diabetes and 1.06 (1.03, 1.09, p < 0.001) for type 2 diabetes,
without evidence of significant heterogeneity by type of dia-
betes (p for interaction = 0.88, Fig. 4). Exclusion of 22 studies
that provided only age-adjusted results had no appreciable
effect on the pooled RR estimates (multiple-adjusted pooled
RR in women 1.25 [1.17, 1.34], p < 0.001, RR in men 1.20
[1.11, 1.29], p < 0.001, RRR 1.06 [1.03, 1.10], p < 0.001, I2 =
48.9%) (ESM Figs 2 and 3).
The pooled RRR did not vary substantially by study region
(p = 0.45), year of baseline study (p = 0.54 for categorical
analysis, p = 0.18 for continuous analysis), ascertainment of
diabetes (p = 0.72), level of adjustment (p = 0.70), quality of
study (p = 0.09 for categorical analysis) or absolute risk dif-
ference between men and women (p = 0.82 for categorical
analysis, p = 0.99 for continuous analysis), with the exception
of continuous analysis for quality of study, p = 0.01) (Fig. 4
and ESM Fig. 4).
Secondary analyses of incidence (fatal or not) and mortality
alone for all-site cancer are described in the ESM. The pooled
women-to-men RRR for incidence was 1.10 (1.07, 1.13, p <
0.001) (ESM Fig. 5) and for mortality was 1.03 (0.99, 1.06,
p = 0.16) (ESM Fig. 6).
In sensitivity analysis using only those studies which pro-
vided the RRs for both incidence and mortality, the pooled
maximum-available-adjusted RRR was 1.12 (1.06, 1.17, p <
0.001) for all-site cancer incidence, and 1.10 (1.00, 1.21, p =
0.04) for all-site cancer mortality (ESM Fig. 7).
Data on site-specific cancer were available for 50 sites (50
sites for incidence and 29 sites for mortality) (https://www.
georgeinstitute.org/sites/default/files/esm-table.pdf). Diabetes
was associated with an increased risk of cancer in 43 sites in
women and 42 sites in men, with a statistically significant
increase (p < 0.01) in risk for those with diabetes in 20 sites
in women and 18 sites in men (ESM Fig. 8). The pooled
maximum-available-adjusted RRR was statistically signifi-
cantly higher in women than men for kidney (1.11 [99% CI
1.04, 1.18], p < 0.001), oral (1.13 [1.00, 1.28], p = 0.009),
stomach cancer (1.14 [1.07, 1.22], p < 0.001) and leukaemia
(1.15 [1.02, 1.28], p = 0.002), whereas it was statistically sig-
nificantly lower for liver cancer (0.88 [0.79, 0.99], p = 0.005)

Discussion
This systematic review, with meta-analysis, of 121 cohorts
including more than 19 million individuals and over one mil-
lion all-site cancer events, demonstrated that diabetes was as-
sociated with a 6% higher excess risk of all-site cancer in
women than men. Diabetes was associated with several site-
specific cancers and conferred a significantly greater excess
risk in women than men for oral, stomach and kidney cancer
and for leukaemia, but a lower excess risk for liver cancer. The
findings were broadly consistent for incident and fatal cancers
and across a wide range of prespecified subgroups.
Our findings are in agreement with a previous meta-analy-
sis, which found that the risk of all-site cancer incidence and
mortality was significantly increased in both sexes [4].
However, this previous meta-analysis was about a tenth of
the size of the current study, and included single-sex studies,
and therefore was not able to reliably quantify sex differences
as they could have been explained by differences in methods,
confounders adjusted for, and the background risks between
studies of women and men alone.
As we found some evidence to suggest that the women-to-
men RRRs tended to be smaller in studies of lower quality
(Fig. 4 and ESM Fig. 4), our results may underestimate any
true sex difference. A significant degree of heterogeneity was
also observed between studies conducted in and outside Asia
with regards to all-site cancer mortality (ESM Fig. 19).
However, we did not find heterogeneity between regions for
our primary outcome, nor for the other secondary outcomes
(all-site cancer incidence), and thus we speculate that this may
be a chance finding consequent to the high number of statis-
tical tests conducted.
Although we found a slightly higher women-to-men RRR
for cancer incidence than cancer mortality, the finding may be
explained by chance differences between the included studies,
as almost identical pooled RRR estimates were obtained in the
sensitivity analysis restricted to five studies which provided
the sex-specific RRs for both incidence and mortality from the
same study.
With regard to cancer at specific sites, previous meta-
analyses have yielded inconsistent results of increased (stom-
ach [5], lung [6], kidney [7]), similar (oesophagus [8],
colorectum [9], pancreas [10], bladder [11], thyroid [12]) or
decreased (liver [13]) excess risk of cancer associated with
diabetes in women compared with men. However, unlike
our methods, these analyses included single-sex studies as
well as studies among both women and men.
There are several possible explanations for the excess risk of
cancer conferred by diabetes in women than men. One possible
mechanism is poor glycaemic control in women with diabetes
compared with men with diabetes [128, 129]. Hyperglycaemia
may have carcinogenic effects by causing DNA damage [130],
which could result from increased oxidative stress due to
hyperglycaemia [130] or from hyperglycaemia itself [131].
Historically, women were likely to be undertreated or receive
less intensive care compared with men [128, 132]. Further, a
recent study showed that adherence to glucose-lowering medi-
cation was lower in women than men [133]. As such, the carci-
nogenic effects of hyperglycaemia may be enhanced in women
and subsequently lead to an increased cancer risk compared with
men. Alternatively, cumulative exposure to insulin resistance
and subsequent hyperinsulinaemia may be longer in women
compared with men. The average duration of impaired glucose
tolerance or impaired fasting glucose has been found to be more
than 2 years longer in women than men [134], suggesting that
women may have more exposure to, often untreated,
hyperinsulinaemia in the prediabetic state. Hyperinsulinaemia
promotes cancer cell proliferation by stimulating the insulin re-
ceptor directly and insulin-like growth factor-1 indirectly [135].
Another factor that may, to some extent, explain the smaller RR
for incidence of all-site cancer in men compared with women is
the apparent protective effect of diabetes on prostate cancer in

 men with diabetes [136]. Sex-specific cancers or site-specific
cancers in which diabetes conferred greater or lower excess risk
in women than men may also account for the association, al-
though the degree of contribution cannot be determined from our
analyses. In addition to sex difference for all-site cancer, we
found also that diabetes conferred a significantly greater RR in
women than men for oral, stomach and kidney cancer and for
leukaemia, but a lower RR for liver cancer. The underlying
mechanisms for sex differences in each specific association are
not clear. However, unmeasured confounding factors specific to
each site, such as Helicobacter pylori infection for stomach can-
cer [137] and hepatitis virus infection for liver cancer [138],
might be involved. However, the literature around mechanisms
underpinning the sex differences in site-specific cancers is scant
and further studies are required to confirm and clarify these sex
differences in site-specific associations. Finally, the studies in our
analyses were not adjusted for female-specific factors including
pregnancy, menopausal status and use of hormone replacement
therapy that have also been associated with diabetes [139] and
cancer [140].
We quantified sex differences based on RRs rather than risk
differences. This might introduce a statistical artefact, in
which the generally higher absolute risk for cancer in men,
and the same risk difference subsequent to diabetes in each
sex, would translate to a greater relative risk in women than
men. However, this would require that risks of cancers asso-
ciated with diabetes are additive rather than multiplicative,
which is not generally considered to be the case in epidemiolo-
gy. Indeed, RRs are much more commonly reported than risk
differences in both epidemiological studies and clinical trials.
Also, unlike risk differences, RRs are typically fairly stable
across populations with different background risks, which make
them suitable for summarisation of effects in meta-analyses.
Furthermore, our previous meta-analyses on risk factors for car-
diovascular diseases demonstrated that detection of a female
disadvantage in RRs is not inevitable when men have higher
absolute risk [141, 142]. We thus believe that the use of RRs in
the present analyses is both practical and justifiable.
The strengths of this meta-analysis are its size and the in-
clusion of studies on the sex-specific effects of diabetes on all-

 site cancer and 50 site-specific cancers, which enabled us to
conduct the most comprehensive analyses to date on the sex-
specific effects of diabetes on cancer risk. To limit the risk of
bias, we only included cohort studies that were conducted in
men and women and had adjusted for at least age. Limitations
of this study are inherent to the use of published data and the
heterogeneity between studies in ascertainment of diabetes,
study design and duration, endpoint definition and degree of
adjustment for confounders. Nevertheless, a range of sub-
group analysis provided broadly consistent results. However,
as we compared women and men from within the same study,
any effect of differences in methods between studies is likely
to have affected women and men similarly. We therefore as-
sume that the sex comparisons reported in this analysis are still
valid. Second, the lack of data on duration of diabetes and the
degree of glycaemic control precluded more detailed analyses
on the effect of diabetes on the risk of cancer. Third, as this
meta-analysis largely used published data, endpoint definition
varied across the studies. Fourth, in analysis of all-site cancer,
the women-to-men RRRs depend not only on the strengths of
the RRRs of site-specific cancers (as illustrated by Fig. 5), but
also on the relative incidence of site-specific cancers, which
varies considerably between populations. This is likely to be a
key factor in the high between-study heterogeneity we show
in Fig. 3. Finally, studies generally did not adjust for obstetric
and gynaecological history and unmeasured confounding is
likely in the current estimates. However, confounding is likely
to have been non-differentially distributed between women
and men from the same study and we therefore assume that
it had only a negligible effect on the reported associations.
In conclusion, diabetes is a risk factor for all-site cancer in
both sexes, with a stronger effect in women than men. Sex dif-
ferences varied across the location of the cancer, heightening the
importance of a sex-specific approach to quantification of the
role of diabetes in cancer research, prevention and treatment.
Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying
the sex differences in the diabetes–cancer association.
