The speed and pen-pressure while sketching a spiral are lower among Parkinson’s
disease (PD) patients with higher severity of the disease. However, the correlation
between these features and the severity level (SL) of PD has been reported to be 0.4.
There is a need for identifying parameters with a stronger correlation for considering
this for accurate diagnosis of the disease. This study has proposed the use of the
Composite Index of Speed and Pen-pressure (CISP) of sketching as a feature for analyzing
the severity of PD. A total of 28 control group (CG) and 27 PD patients (total 55
participants) were recruited and assessed for Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS). They drew guided Archimedean spiral on an A3 sheet. Speed, pen-pressure,
and CISP were computed and analyzed to obtain their correlation with severity of the
disease. The correlation of speed, pen-pressure, and CISP with the severity of PD
was −0.415, −0.584, and −0.641, respectively. Mann–Whitney U test confirmed that
CISP was suitable to distinguish between PD and CG, while non-parametric k-sample
Kruskal–Wallis test confirmed that it was significantly different for PD SL-1 and PD SL-3.
This shows that CISP during spiral sketching may be used to differentiate between CG
and PD and between PD SL-1 and PD SL-3 but not SL-2.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson disease is associated with movement disorder symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia, and postural instability (1). The manifestation of bradykinesia and rigidity is often
in the early stages of the disease (2). These have a noticeable effect on the handwriting and sketching
abilities of patients, and micrographia has been used for early-stage diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease
(PD) (3–6). While handwriting of a person is influenced by a number of factors such as language
proficiency and education, sketching of a shape such as the spiral has been found to be non-invasive
and independent measure (7).
The association of handwriting and sketching of the spiral has been established in PD in early
stages (8, 9). However, one shortcoming in the use of handwriting or sketching is the need for an
expert to interpret the sketches, especially in the early stages of the disease. With the availability
of digital devices that are suitable for recording hand-sketching, there is the potential for machine
based assessment of writing and sketching. These devices are also suitable for obtaining the dynamic

CISP of Spiral Drawing Can Estimate the Severity of Parkinson’s
features of handwriting, which are suitable for real-time and reli-
able analysis (10, 11). These features can be obtained automatically
allowing rapid on-line assessment of patients (12) and developed
for applications such as biometrics (13) and indicative markers for
PD (14).
The kinematics of spiral drawing indicates physiological
parameters such as the amplitude of tremor (15) and extent of
bradykinesia (16) and dyskinesia (17). It has been shown to suc-
cessfully differentiated between distal and proximal tremors (18)
and between control group (CG) and PD (9, 19).
Identifying the level of severity is important for optimal clinical
decision. Saunders et al. successfully quantified drawing of the
spiral and identified the speed to be associated with the severity
levels (SLs) of the disease among PD patients (7). While this is
extremely useful to demonstrate the association, the maximum
correlation coefficient reported was only 0.4.
The pen-pressure of PD patients is another feature that is
associated with sketching and has been found to reduce compared
with CG (14). While this is suitable for distinguishing between
healthy subjects and people with the significant severity of the
disease, it has not been shown to be suitable for distinguishing
between different stages of the disease.
The aim of this work was to establish a reliable computer-
based spiral sketching method for assessment of the severity of
the disease. This study has investigated the dynamics of sketching
a spiral to distinguish between healthy subjects and PD patients
with different levels of severity and proposes a new feature with
stronger association with the severity of the disease. The ear-
lier studies have established that speed and pen-pressure during
sketching reduce with the advancement of the disease (4, 14) but
did not consider the combination of these two parameters. This
study used the scalar product of these two features to obtain the
Composite Index of Speed and Pen-pressure (CISP) of sketching
and tested this against the severity of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The differences in the dynamics of sketching a guided spiral
were investigated using a CG and PD patients based on Uni-
fied Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and modified H
and Y rating scale severity. Proprietary software was developed
that automatically recorded the pen-pressure and position of the
pen and measured the average speed, pen-pressure, and CISP
of sketching. Statistical and correlation analyses were performed
using the SPSS software.
Subjects
Fifty-five age-matched volunteers ranging from UPDRS = 0 (CG)
to severely affected patients (UPDRS >24) were studied. All
PD patients were recruited from PD outpatient clinic at Dan-
denong Neurology, Melbourne, Australia, while the CG subjects
were from multiple aged-care facilities using word-of-mouth and
appropriately located posters. All subjects were right hand dom-
inant. The CG subjects were recruited to approximately match
the age distribution and gender of the PD patients. The exclusion
criteria were clinically observed or self-reported skeletal injuries
and neurological and muscular-skeletal diseases, excess Levodopa

medication that caused dyskinesia. For the PD patients who were
on levodopa treatment, the experiments were conducted while
they were in the “on” stage. The demographic and clinical data
are shown in Table 1.
The severity of motor symptoms for all participants was
assessed by a qualified neurologist using part III of UPDRS Scale
(Q18-31), and overall PD stage assessment was done using Modi-
fied Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) Scale. SL 0 indicates the CG with no
PD symptoms. Based on UPDRS III (20) and modified H and Y
rating scale (21, 22) further groups were labeled as SL: 1–3 (see
Table 2). None of the patients were in the late stage of the disease
or were bedridden.
Data Recording
The experimental protocol was approved by RMIT University
Human Research Ethics Committee and in accordance with Dec-
laration of Helsinki (revised 2004). All participants were informed
about the experiment, and they provided their oral and written
consent before the start of the experiment.
One shortcoming in the use of spiral drawing is the significant
variation between the different studies. One option is where the
participants are free to draw the spiral, which has the disadvantage
that there is significant inter-participant variability (23, 24). The
other template is by providing a continuous spiral for the par-
ticipants to trace, which however is not feasible for many elderly
participants. Another option is the use of light guided spiral (25),
which was however found to be unsuitable for the elderly patients.
This study overcame the abovementioned shortcomings and
the participants used bright dots to guide the participants to sketch
the spiral at their own speed and without emphasis on its accuracy
(Figure 1). This is comfortable for all the participants, overcomes
the potential bias due to shape based visual feedback, and ensures
consistency of the number of circles made by all participants.

FIGURE 1 | (A) Dot-guided spiral and (B) participant drawing the spiral.
The sketching of the spiral was recorded using commercially
available A3 size tablet (Wacom Intuos Pro Large). The A3 paper
was placed on the tablet, and Ink pen (Wacom Intuos ink pen)
was used to sketch the spiral using guiding dots (Figure 1). This
pen senses the location of contact, x and y, and the pressure, pr,
between the tip and the paper.
The center of the sheet was considered to be the (0,0) point.
The guided Archimedean spiral was made using Adobe Illustrator
software. It had 4.5 revolutions and a maximum radius 75 mm
with an incremental increase in the diameter of 15 mm. The spiral
was sketched in the clock-wise direction, the starting point was
−75,0 mm, the end point was 7.5,0 mm, and the distance between
two consecutive dots in the spiral was 12 mm (Figure 1A). The
dots were of 2 mm each so that it was clearly visible. Participants
were allowed to sketch the spiral at their own speed starting from
the outside (−75 mm, 0) till starting point (Figure 1B) (10).
Proprietary software was developed and used to record and
analyze the data in real time. The recorded data contain the
following information:
• Location (x, y) with xn and yn corresponding to the nth sample.
x, y are received in millimeter.
• pen-pressure (pr) recorded by the pen.
pr is unit-less with the range; 0–1,024 units and
• n, the sample number.
The sampling rate was 133 Hz.
Computation of Features
The data were segmented to identify segments between each pen-
down and corresponding pen-up; pen-down identified based on
pr > 0, and given an index label, i with mi being the total number
of samples of the segment.
The total length of each segment, di, was computed (Eq. 1)
and segments that corresponded to less than 0.5 mm of distance
traveled were considered as noise and deleted. The remaining N
segments and parameters were relabeled, i (1 to N).
The total time duration for each segment is Ti (Eq. 2).
Average speed (millimeter/second) was obtained using Eq. 3.
The speed for each segment was weighted with the length of
that segment to get the weighted average speed, ¯
Sw, and was
computed (Eq. 4).
Mean pen-pressure (pri) was obtained for each segment and
the corresponding weighted average was calculated using Eq. 5.
Average CISP of the spiral sketching, ¯
Ispr was calculated using
Eq. 6. This is the product of ¯
Sw and weighted pen-pressure,
prw.

Statistical Methods
Statistical analysis was performed using the non-parametric tests
to determine the statistical significance of the difference between
the groups (22, 26). Mann–Whitney test was conducted to deter-
mine the difference in the parameter value between PD and CG.
Two tests were conducted.
• Mann–Whitney U test is suitable for two group analyses and
was conducted to determine the difference in the parameter
values between PD and CG.
• Non-parametric k-sample Kruskal–Wallis test was performed
to distinguish between different SLs among the PD as it con-
tains three groups.
The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of classification were
computed, and these were used to generate the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was
computed to determine the ability of the technique to differentiate
between PD and CG.
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient analysis was con-
ducted to determine the association between the groups based
on SL for the three features corresponding to the dynamics of
sketching the spiral.
RESULTS
Figure 2 shows the normalized value (0–1) of weighted average
speed (¯
Sw), the average of pen-pressure (prw) and average CISP
of sketching (¯
Ispr) for PD and CGs. It is observed that for all the
features, the values for PD are lower compared to CG. Statisti-
cal analysis results using Mann–Whitney U test shows statistical
significance difference for each value; speed U = 233, p = 0.0159;
pen-pressure U = 139, p < 0.001, and CISP U = 130, p < 0.001.
These indicate that there is significant group difference between
PD and CG.
The specificity and sensitivity were calculated after the clas-
sification and area under ROC curve. The results showed the
classification accuracy of 79.1% with area under ROC curve as
86.2% for CISP, whereas the combined features of speed and
pen-pressure showed the classification accuracy of 68.2% with

area under ROC curve as 83.2%. This shows that while there is
significant group difference for all the features, the classification
accuracy for CISP is much higher compared to the other two
features.
Figure 3 shows the normalized values (0–1) for all the three
features for different groups of PD based on SL. It is observed that
the values of all the parameters reduced with SLs. Non-parametric
k-sample Kruskal–Wallis test shows that there is statistically
significant difference between groups for CISP (χ2(3) = 8.753,
p = 0.013), whereas speed (χ2(3) = 5.907, p = 0.052) and Pen-
Pressure (χ2(3) = 4.064, p = 0.131) did not show statistically sig-
nificant difference (α = 0.05). This indicates that speed and pen-
pressure by themselves are not suitable for differentiating between
the different levels of severity. Follow-up test was conducted to
evaluate pairwise differences among the three PD groups, control-
ling for Type I error across tests by using the Bonferroni approach.
A pairwise comparison showed a significant difference (p = 0.009)
for SL-3 and SL-1. However, no significant difference was found
for SL-2/SL-1 (p = 0.283) and SL-1/SL-3 (p = 0.709).
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient analysis between
all groups and the three parameters corresponding to the dynam-
ics of sketching the spiral; ¯
Sw, prw, and¯
Ispr have been tabulated in
Table 3 (A) while for PD patients only are shown in Table 3 (B).
From Table 3 (A), it is observed that rs = −0.421 for speed and
rs = −0.584 for pen-pressure while for CISP rs = −0.641.
The coefficient, rs, for CISP = −0.568, whereas speed and pen-
pressure show rs = −0.475 and rs = −0.383, respectively, when
the three PD groups and without CG were considered. This indi-
cates that the discrimination between the three levels of severity of
PD by CISP and speed was moderate (range 0.4–0.59), while it was
weak (0.2–0.39) for pen-pressure. This was found to be valid for
grouping based on UPDRS (Section III), Modified H&Y (Section
V) or Schwab & England (S&E) scale.
DISCUSSION
Bradykinesia in PD patients causing reduced speed is well recog-
nized (27). Mann–Whitney U test has shown that our findings are
in line with earlier finding who found that PD patients sketched
the spiral slower than the healthy subjects. Our findings are also
in line with earlier finding, which shows kinematic feature; speed,
and pen-pressure are reduced in PD compared with CG (14, 28).
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients of the association
of speed and pen-pressure with the severity of the disease are in
line with Saunders et al. and show a correlation of 0.4 (7). The
results show that speed and pen-pressure were lower with patients
having higher severity of the disease (Figure 3). This extends
the earlier findings (4, 14) who had reported similar difference
and attributed to the complexity of task (29) and bradykinesia
(27). However, this has not been uniformly accepted (30). This

study has shown that while there is a reduction in the mean
values of speed and pen-pressure with the severity of the disease,
this is not statistically significant. This shows that speed or pen-
pressure is not suitable to differentiate between the severities of
PD. Thus, while these are suitable for differentiating between
PD and CG, these are not suitable to differentiate based on the
severity of PD.
This study has shown that the composite feature proposed in
this study is suitable for differentiating between PD and CG and
between SL-1 and SL-3. CISP is the product of the two features,
speed of sketching and pen-pressure during sketching. The results
show that when considering two group problems, PD and CG,
the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under
ROC curve is higher for CISP than for the individual features,
speed and pen-pressure. It is also seen that Spearman rank ordered
correlation coefficient for CISP is stronger compared to speed and
pen-pressure when comparing between patients with different
levels of severity of PD (Table 3).
The advantage of the proposed method is that it is suitable
for being used without supervision. The features (Eqs 1–6) are
independent of the starting point of the spiral (23) and the com-
putation of the features is in real time. The test requires simple
instructions and is not dependent on the language skills of the
patient, and the complete test takes around l0 minutes.
CONCLUSION
This study has shown that speed, pen-pressure, and CISP of
sketching of a spiral are negatively correlated with the severity of
PD. While these three features were significantly affected by the
severity of the disease, the correlation was strongest with the CISP
of sketching. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference of
CISP between SLs 1 and 3 but not for speed and pen-pressure.

CISP of Spiral Drawing Can Estimate the Severity of Parkinson’s
However, CISP was not able to differentiate between SL1 and SL2
or between SL2 and SL-3.
This study proposes that average CISP of drawing a spiral
for monitoring PD patients and assessing the severity of their
disease. However, this study suffers from two limitations, which
are the basis for the next studies, increase in patient numbers and
longitudinal study. One limitation in this study is that number of
patients for individual SLs was relatively small, 7, 8, and 12. Based
on CISP calculations, there is a need to extend it so that the sample
size for each SL is greater than 20. The second limitation of this
study is that it is a cross-sectional study. To confirm the suitability
of this method for monitoring the patients, a longitudinal study
that will monitor the patients over the progression of their disease
needs to be conducted.
