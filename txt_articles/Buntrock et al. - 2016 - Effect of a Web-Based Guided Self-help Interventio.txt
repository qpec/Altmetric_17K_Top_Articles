IMPORTANCE Evidence-based treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are not very
successful in improving functional and health outcomes. Attention has increasingly been
focused on the prevention of MDD.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based guided self-help intervention for the
prevention of MDD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-group randomized clinical trial conducted between
March 1, 2013, and March 4, 2015. Participants were recruited in Germany from the general
population via a large statutory health insurance company (ie, insurance funded by joint
employer-employee contributions). Participants included 406 self-selected adults with
subthreshold depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score �16, no
current MDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth
Edition, Text Revision] criteria).
INTERVENTIONS All participants had unrestricted access to usual care (visits to the primary
care clinician) and were randomized to either a web-based guided self-help intervention
(cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving therapy supported by an online trainer; n = 202)
or a web-based psychoeducation program (n = 204).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD in the
intervention group relative to the control group over a 12-month follow-up period as assessed
by blinded diagnostic raters using the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6- and 12-month follow-up, covering the period to the previous
assessment.
RESULTS Among 406 randomized patients (mean age, 45 years; 73.9% women), 335 (82%)
completed the telephone follow-up at 12 months. Fifty-five participants (27%) in the
intervention group experienced MDD compared with 84 participants (41%) in the control
group. Cox regression analyses controlling for baseline depressive symptom severity revealed
a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.82; P = .002) at 12-month follow-up. The number
needed to treat to avoid 1 new case of MDD was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.9-14.6).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a
web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the
incidence of MDD over 12 months. Further research is needed to understand whether the
effects are generalizable to both first onset of depression and depression recurrence as well
as efficacy without the use of an online trainer.

M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly preva-
lent condition associated with substantial disease
burden and economic costs.1 The 12-month preva-
lenceofMDDinhigh-incomecountriesisestimatedtobe5.1%,2
with an annual incidence rate of 3%.3 It is projected that MDD
will be the leading cause of premature mortality and disabil-
ity in high-income countries by 2030.4
However,assumingthehypotheticalscenarioof100%cov-
erage and adherence to evidence-based treatments, only ap-
proximately one-third of the disease burden attributable to
MDD could be averted.5 Therefore, attention has increasingly
been focused on the prevention of MDD. Recent meta-
analytic evidence suggests that it is possible to prevent the
onset of MDD using psychological interventions by targeting
individuals with subthreshold depression (ie, indicated
prevention).6
Studies, however, were heterogeneous and mostly
directed at specific at-risk populations (eg, pregnant wom-
en). Targeting at-risk groups becomes less relevant when
offering low-cost interventions (eg, web-based interven-
tions). Advantages of web-based interventions include
(1) they are accessible at any time and place, (2) participants
can work at their own pace and easily review materials, and
(3) at-risk individuals are reached at an earlier stage com-
pared with traditional mental health services, because
web-based interventions are more easily integrated into
daily life. Web-based interventions have been shown effec-
tive in reducing depressive symptoms7 and acceptable to
participants.8 To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet
investigated the effectiveness of a web-based intervention
on the onset of diagnosed MDD. This study evaluated the
effect of a web-based guided self-help intervention on the
prevention of MDD onset in an adult population with sub-
threshold depression. An earlier publication from this study
reported interim outcomes at posttreatment and 6-month
follow-up for depressive symptoms. In this study, we report
the primary outcomes from this clinical trial, progression to
MDD at 12 months.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
The study protocol is available in Supplement 1. In brief, a
2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted to establish
the effectiveness of a web-based guided self-help interven-
tion compared with enhanced usual care on the onset of MDD.
The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of
the University of Marburg (reference No. AZ 2012-35K) and reg-
istered in the German clinical trial registry. Participants pro-
vided written informed consent. Study outcomes were as-
sessed at baseline, posttreatment (secondary outcomes only),
and 6- and 12-month follow-up.
German citizens are either privately insured (ie, insurers
charge a risk-related contribution [11% of the German popula-
tion]) or statutorily insured (ie, insurance is funded by joint
contributions to sickness funds by employers and employees,
based on a percentage of income [89% of the population]).
Participants were mainly recruited via a large German statu-
tory health insurance company (BARMER GEK) by announc-
ing the study in the company’
s members’magazine. The
BARMER GEK reaches 12.2% (8.6 million) of the statutorily
insured population in Germany. However, adults interested
in participating in the study could apply to participate, irre-
spective of their insurance status. The study was also
announced in newspaper articles, on-air media, and related
websites. Individuals self-identifying as having a lower mood
could apply online on the research website. Referral by a phy-
sician was not required.
This open recruitment strategy was chosen to try to
approximate the practice setting in which this type of web-
based preventive intervention might be used. Applicants
were asked to complete an online screening questionnaire to
assess whether they (1) experience subthreshold depression
(Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]
score ≥16),9 (2) were 18 years or older, (3) had Internet access,
(4) were not currently receiving psychotherapy, (5) were not
on a waiting list for psychotherapy, (6) had not received
psychotherapy in the past 6 months, and (7) did not endorse
a notable suicidal risk (Beck Depression Inventory item 9
score >1). The use of antidepressant medication was not an
exclusion criterion because in Germany antidepressants are
commonly used for a wide range of indications (ie, depres-
sion, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsory disorder,
chronic pain syndrome, and stress urinary incontinence).10
However, participants needed to have been taking a stable
dose for at least 4 weeks to be able to enter the study.
Potentially eligible participants were scheduled for a
Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) Axis Disorders
(SCID) to assess final eligibility, defined as not meeting Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth
Edition, Text Revision) (DSM-IV) criteria for (1) a major
depressive episode, (2) bipolar disorder, or (3) psychotic dis-
order, and (4) not having a history of MDD in the past
6 months (based on the model of Kupfer11). According to
Kupfer’
s model, a patient is considered to be recovered
when he or she stays in remission for a minimum of 6
months. In the baseline assessment, participants were
asked to self-identify as either white, black, or Hispanic.
Randomization and Masking
Randomization took place at an individual level and was
conducted centrally by an independent researcher not oth-
erwise involved in the study. For the randomization proce-
dure an automated computer-generated random numbers
table was used to automatically assign 0 (control group) or 1
(intervention group) to each participant’
s individual trial ID
number. Trial IDs were numbered sequentially and did not
entail any specific information about participants (eg, ini-
tials). Randomization was performed in the order incoming
informed consent forms were received, and the researcher
who recruited participants (eg, collected informed consent
forms) was not informed about participants’randomization
status. Hence, this researcher could not influence the ran-
domization procedure by reordering informed consent

forms. The researcher conducting the randomization had no
information about participants apart from participants’trial
ID numbers. Randomization used a block size of 2. Study
participants were aware of their allocation. Staff conducting
SCID interviews were, however, unaware of participants’
randomization status. Steps taken to maintain blinding are
described in detail in the study protocol available in
Supplement 1.
After each assessment, interviewers were asked to guess
each participant’
s randomization status, and these guesses
were compared with the actual status. If blinding was broken
during the first outcome interview, the interviewer was re-
placed with another blinded interviewer for the second out-
come interview. The research staff conducting SCID inter-
views were not otherwise involved in the study.
Interventions
All study participants had unrestricted access to usual care.
For subthreshold depression, usual care entails visits to a pri-
mary care clinician but not to treatment provided by a mental
health care specialist. The German S3-Guideline/National
Disease Management Guideline Unipolar Depression12
recommends psychoeducation or more intensive psychologi-
cal interventions, and the prescription of antidepressant
medication, if depressive symptoms intensify (eg, if MDD is
diagnosed). In this pragmatic trial, usual care was not proto-
colized. However, health care utilization was measured with
the Trimbos/iMTA Questionnaire For Costs Associated With
Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P)13 to help develop a description of
usual care.
Guided Web-Based Intervention
The web-based intervention is a multimedia, interactive on-
linetoolconsistingofsix30-minutesessions.However,thedu-
ration of sessions could vary among users. Participants were
advised to complete 2 sessions per week if possible and a mini-
mum of 1. The intervention is based on psychoeducation, be-
havior therapy, and problem-solving therapy. The content of
the intervention is described in detail in the study protocol
available in Supplement 1. During the training, participants
were supported by an online trainer who provided written in-
dividualfeedbackaftereachsession.Feedbackfocusedonsup-
porting participants to work through the exercises, and no
therapeutic advice was provided. Trained graduate students
and health care professionals supervised by clinical psycholo-
gists provided guidance.
Enhanced Usual Care
The psychoeducational intervention was based on the German
S3-Guideline.12Itinformedparticipantsaboutthenatureofand
evidence-based treatments for depression. The intervention
enhanced usual care, in that it systematically offered infor-
mation that patients might not routinely receive from their pri-
mary care clinician. Participants could review the material as
often as they desired. However, we did not monitor the ac-
tual uptake of the intervention. No online trainer was in-
volved in the intervention, and participants received no home-
work assignments.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD in the inter-
vention group relative to the control group over a 12-month
follow-up period using DSM-IV criteria as assessed with the
telephone-administered SCID at 6- and 12-month follow-up,
covering the period from the previous assessment. Diagnos-
tic interviews were conducted by psychologists trained in
delivering the SCID. The interrater agreement of the axis I
disorders is moderate to excellent.14 The interformat reli-
ability between face-to-face and telephone-administered
SCIDs is considered excellent.15 To examine interrater reli-
ability, interviews were audiotaped and second-rated by an
independent, blinded, experienced rater. The κ coefficient
for interrater agreement for a diagnosis of MDD was 0.77
(based on data from 12% of the participants), indicating
excellent agreement. In case of disagreement between the
study interviewer and the independent rater, consensus
was reached through discussion.
To reduce potential recall bias, time to onset of MDD
was assessed as accurately as possible using the Life Chart
method as developed by Lyketsos et al.16 In this method,
age- and calendar-linked personal landmarks are used to
assess the time sequence of, for example, depressive symp-
tomatology and life events in parallel. During the interview,
the first day of a depressive episode was established. If the
exact day could not be established, the closest week
(month) was defined and the midpoint of that week (month)
was used.
Secondary clinical outcomes were all based on self-report
measures assessed online at 6- and 12-month follow-up
and included depressive symptom severity (CES-D9), func-
tional impairment (12-Item Short Form Health Survey
[SF-12]17), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–
Anxiety [HADS-A]18), problem-solving skills (Social Problem-
Solving Inventory–Revised [SPSI-R]19), behavioral acti-
vation (Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale–Short
Form [BADS-SF]20), mastery (Pearling and Schooler Mas-
tery Scale [PSMS]21), worrying (Penn State Worry Question-
naire [PSWQ]22), insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index
[ISI]23), and health care service uptake (TiC-P13).
Statistical Analysis
Because no estimate of clinical relevance exists for the inci-
dence of MDD, we assumed an absolute risk reduction of at
least 10% for the incidence of MDD between the interven-
tion and control groups as clinically relevant. This (norma-
tive) threshold was derived by consulting clinical experts in
the field of depression prevention and asking stakeholders
who would potentially use a web-based intervention in rou-
tine care (eg, health insurance companies) about a threshold
above which they would consider the results worthwhile
from a clinical perspective. Based on previous studies
evaluating interventions directed at the prevention of MDD,
we expected a 25% mean incidence of MDD in the control
group within the 12-month follow-up period.24,25
A power calculation indicated that 406 participants were
needed to demonstrate an absolute risk reduction of 10% be-

with a power of (1 − β) = 0.80 using survival analysis while ac-
counting for 20% dropout (calculated using PASS 12 [NCSS]).
All analyses are reported according to the CONSORT
statement.26 Analyses were based on intention to treat; ie, all
randomized participants were included in the analyses, irre-
spective of whether they adhered to the treatment protocol.
Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression
analyses were used to determine differences in time to onset
of MDD (in weeks) between the intervention and control
groups.27 The mean survival time was calculated as the area
under the Kaplan-Meier survivor function within the
12-month trial period. Cox regression computes estimates of
survival time for right-censored data. An observation is right-
censored when a participant is no longer eligible to experi-
ence a depressive episode, eg, the participant is lost to
follow-up or completes the follow-up period without experi-
encing a major depressive episode. Time to onset of MDD
was used as the dependent variable and treatment condition
as the independent variable covarying baseline depressive
symptom severity (ie, baseline CES-D sum score). Concurrent
use of antidepressants was also included as a covariate in the
Cox proportional hazards model (post hoc). Because the use
of antidepressants was not a predictor of the outcome, it was
excluded from the final model. The Cox model assumes that
hazards are proportional, implying that the effect of a given
covariate does not change over time. We tested the propor-
tional hazards assumption based on the scaled Schoenfeld
residuals test.28
Person-time–based Poisson regression was used to ob-
tain incidence rate ratios (IRRs). We calculated the number
needed to treat (NNT) and 95% CIs to avoid 1 additional case
of MDD as compared with the control group, according to
Altman and Andersen.29
In secondary analyses, analysis of covariance was used to
compareoutcomesbetweengroupsat12-monthfollow-up,ad-
justing for baseline scores to assess differences in secondary
outcomes. The effects on secondary clinical outcomes at post-
treatment and 6-month follow-up have been reported.30
Missingdatawereimputedusingmultipleimputationtech-
niquesasimplementedinStata13(StataCorp).Inaddition,per-
protocol analyses were conducted based on the sample of par-
ticipants who adequately adhered to the intervention protocol
(ie, completed at least 5 of 6 intervention sessions). A signifi-
cance level of .05 (2-sided) was used for all outcome analy-
ses. All data were analyzed using Stata 13 for Windows.31
Sensitivity Analyses
To test the robustness of the findings, missing data were
imputed using imputation techniques for survival data as
implemented in Stata 13, and the same Cox model as that
described for the main analyses was used. In addition, we
tested the robustness of the findings by excluding those par-
ticipants who revealed their randomization status during
SCID follow-up interviews. To assess the robustness of the
preventive effect of the intervention, a subgroup analysis
excluded those participants taking antidepressants at base-
line. A per-protocol analysis tested whether intervention
completers (ie, those completing at least 5 of 6 intervention
sessions) differed from noncompleters with regard to any
baseline characteristics (eTable 1 in Supplement 2) and with
regard to time to onset of a major depressive disorder.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the study.
Between March 15, 2013, and March 4, 2014, the study
enrolled 406 participants (intervention group, n = 202; con-
trol group, n = 204). Overall, 335 participants (82%) partici-
pated in the SCID follow-up interviews (69 participants were
censored at baseline and 2 at 6-month follow-up). There were
no significant differences in follow-up rates between study
conditions (P = .22 by χ2 test). Dropout was not associated
with baseline depressive symptom severity or any sociode-
mographic factor.
Some participants (n = 17 [5.1%]) informed interviewers
about their randomization status during the SCID follow-up
interviews (10 in the intervention group, 7 in the control
group). Interviewers correctly guessed a participant’
s ran-
domization status in 53% of cases. Participant characteristics
at baseline are described in detail elsewhere30 and shown in
Table 1. In brief, the modal participant was female, white,
and 45 years old, had an above-average level of education,
and was employed.
Effectiveness of Intervention
The mean treatment duration was 5.84 (SD, 4.37) weeks. On
average, participants completed 4.93 of 6 sessions.30 The
total time a trainer spent per participant was approximately
3 hours. Fifty-five participants (27%) in the intervention
group and 84 participants (41%) in the control group experi-
enced MDD. Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival
curves for the intervention and control groups generated for
the 12-month study period. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of
the cumulative incidence of MDD were 32% (95% CI, 25%-
39%) for the intervention and 47% (95% CI, 40%-55%) for
the control condition. The corresponding person-time–based
IRR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42-0.84; P = .003). The log-rank
test revealed a statistically significant difference between
incidence rates over time (P = .002). The mean time to onset
of MDD within the 12-month trial period was 43 weeks (95%
CI, 41-46) in the intervention group and 37 weeks (95% CI,
35-40) in the control group. Cox regression, which con-
trolled for baseline depressive symptom severity, revealed a
hazard ratio [HR] of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.82; P = .002). The
estimated HR for depressive symptom severity was 1.06
(95% CI, 1.04-1.08; P < .001). There was no evidence for non-
constant HRs (global test of nonproportionality, P = .97;
treatment condition, P = .90; depressive symptom severity,
P = .84).
At12-monthfollow-up,theNNTtoavoid1newcaseofMDD
was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.9-14.6). In the sensitivity analysis using im-
puted data instead of censoring for missing values, Cox re-
gression (again controlling for baseline depressive symptom
severity) revealed an HR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49-0.86; P = .002)

(see also eFigure in Supplement 2). Excluding participants tak-
ingantidepressantsatbaselineorthosewhorevealedtheirran-
domization status during the SCID interview resulted in HRs
similar to those from the main analysis (Supplement 2). De-
tailed results of the sensitivity and per-protocol analyses are
reported in Supplement 2.
Secondary Outcomes

Significant differences in change from baseline to 12-
month follow-up in favor of the intervention group were found
for all outcomes except for the physical health summary score
of the SF-12, the positive problem-orientation subscale of the
SPSI-R, and worrying (PSWQ). Corresponding effect sizes were
small to moderate (Table 2). We did not find any significant dif-
ferences in health care use (ie, outpatient care, inpatient care,
or use of antidepressants) between study conditions (Table 3).
Discussion
We examined whether a web-based guided self-help inter-
vention was effective in preventing the onset of diagnosed
MDD when compared with enhanced usual care over a
12-month follow-up period in patients experiencing sub-
threshold depression. Results of the study suggest that the
intervention could effectively reduce the risk of MDD onset
or at least delay onset.

The incidence of MDD in the control group was remark-
ably higher than that usually found in prevention studies.6
The possibly substantial secondary prevention population
may have been a reason for the high rate of MDD in the con-
trol group. However, some prevention studies assessed only
current MDD at follow-up, hence not covering the whole
study time frame.24,32 The HR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.82)
found in the present study compares favorably with results
from other indicated prevention studies focusing on an adult
population without additional risk factors. To our knowl-
edge, only 2 such studies on non–web-based interventions
have been conducted so far and reveal mixed results, with
IRRs ranging from 0.66 (95% CI, 0.40-1.09)33 to 1.07 (95% CI,
0.57-2.01).34 Results of the present study are also comparable
with preventive effects of psychological interventions in
at-risk populations (eg, HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.31-1.16] in
patients with physical illness).35 Indicated preventive inter-
ventions could thus also target populations without addi-
tional risk indicators to result in clinically relevant effects.
Considering the high incidence rate in the control group, the
intervention might particularly attract those participants
with an increased risk of developing MDD.
The present study may have implications for clinical
practice and research. First, to our knowledge, this trial is

the largest prevention trial conducted so far, and it supports
the effectiveness of indicated preventive interventions. Sec-
ond, the NNT of 5.9 found in the present study is compa-
rable with NNTs from studies of the treatment of MDD.36 It
implies that of those patients identified with subthreshold
depression and participating in the intervention, almost
17% would benefit in terms of a prevented episode of MDD
within a 12-month period. Third, of participants who devel-
oped MDD within the 12-month trial period, the onset of
MDD was delayed in the intervention group as compared
with the control group. Although preventing the onset of
depressive episodes is preferable because it results in com-
plete avoidance of disease burden, delaying the onset of
MDD is also important. Every year in which new cases of
MDD could be avoided will result in both considerably less
pain (to the patients themselves and also their families) and
reduced economic costs.
Fourth, this study revealed that reducing the incidence of
MDD is also possible using a web-based guided self-help in-
tervention.Fifth,web-basedinterventionsmightattractpeople
who may not use face-to-face interventions. Less burden-
some interventions are needed, because the majority of indi-
viduals experiencing depressive symptoms do not seek help,37
and participation rates in face-to-face interventions for sub-
threshold depression are low.38 Delivering low-threshold evi-
dence-based preventive interventions via the Internet may be
a strategy with potential to reach individuals at an early stage
and may help to prevent the transition from subthreshold de-
pression to a full-blown depressive disorder or relapses in re-
currentdepressivedisorder.However,theapplicabilityofweb-
based interventions is related to the acceptance of such
interventions by the target population (eg, preferences for dif-
ferent treatment modalities, such as face-to-face interven-
tions) and the availability of technical resources (eg, reliable
access to the Internet).
However, this study has some limitations. First, we did
not assess lifetime history of MDD at baseline, meaning that
the results of this study refer to a mixed sample of first
depression onsets and recurrences. The incidence rate in the
control group was higher than could be expected if predomi-
nantly participants without lifetime history of depression
were included. Thus, we cannot conclude whether results
can be generalized to both first onset of depression and pre-
vention of recurrence. Future studies should thus clarify
whether web-based guided self-help interventions are effec-
tive both for the prevention of first depression onset and the
prevention of recurrence. Second, the time horizon of this
study was limited to 12 months. Third, randomization with a
block size of 2 was used. It would appear that randomization
with a block size of 2 ensures that whoever performed the
randomization knew in advance the allocation of half of the
participants. However, the randomization procedure was
performed in the order that incoming informed consent
forms were received, and collection of informed consent
forms and randomization of participants were performed by
2 independent researchers using procedures designed to pre-
serve the concealment of allocation.
Fourth, we identified a 10% risk reduction as clinically rel-
evant. However, this assumption was based on expert opin-
ion. Fifth, we did not assess chronic medical conditions. Ex-
periencingchronicmedicalconditionsmightbeariskindicator
for the onset of MDD. Future studies should thus assess such
conditions or evaluate the effects of web-based guided self-
help interventions directly in such patient groups. Sixth, it was
not possible to mask participants to their assigned study con-
dition. This is a common problem in trials evaluating psycho-
logical interventions. Nevertheless, it might have distorted re-
sults of the trial.
Seventh, not all individuals may benefit from this particu-
lar web-based intervention to the same degree. Future stud-
ies should investigate potential effect modifiers (eg, Internet
literacy). Eighth, usual care was not standardized across pri-
mary care clinicians. Because primary care clinicians were not
known to us, we could not adjust for clinician in the analyses.
Ninth, participants in this study were better educated than the
general population and predominantly women. Conclusions
drawn from the present study may therefore not generally ap-
plytootherpopulations.However,inthistrialweusedanopen
recruitment strategy that mimicked the way in which people
likely will be recruited for e-health interventions in the fu-
ture,thusprovidingecologicalvaliditytothecurrentstudyand
the sample on which it is based.
Tenth,althoughthecontrolgroupreceivedaccesstoaweb-
based psychoeducational intervention, the study conditions
were not balanced with regard to human support. This method
was chosen because we wanted to evaluate the effects of the
intervention compared with usual care, the comparator usu-
ally used in pragmatic trials aiming to achieve high ecological
validity.39 However, we cannot rule out that part of the ob-
served preventive effect is caused by human attention.

Additionally, the use of antidepressant medication was not an
exclusion criterion. Because we excluded those participants
with MDD in the previous 6 months, we assumed that we did
not include participants treated for depression. However, we
cannot rule out that for some participants the web-based in-
tervention was an adjunct to concurrent antidepressant treat-
ment (ie, secondary prevention). Also, we did not measure
the uptake of the web-based psychoeducational interven-
tion. Future studies should investigate a possible dose-effect
relationship. Eleventh, some unguided web-based interven-
tions for depressive symptoms have been shown to be possi-
bly ineffective.40 Because the intervention in this study re-
lied on the use of online trainers, it is therefore possible
that unguided web-based interventions would be less effec-
tive or ineffective. Studies are needed to evaluate the preven-
tive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the on-
set of MDD.
Conclusions
Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a
web-based guided self-help intervention compared with en-
hanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12
months.Furtherresearchisneededtounderstandwhetherthe
effects are generalizable to both first onset of depression and
depression recurrence as well as efficacy without the use of
an online trainer.
