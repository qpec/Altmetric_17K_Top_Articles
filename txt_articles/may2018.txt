IMPORTANCE Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are costly, life-long disabilities. Older data
suggested the prevalence of the disorder in the United States was 10 per 1000 children;
however, there are few current estimates based on larger, diverse US population samples.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, including fetal
alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental
disorder, in 4 regions of the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Active case ascertainment methods using
a cross-sectional design were used to assess children for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
between 2010 and 2016. Children were systematically assessed in the 4 domains that
contribute to the fetal alcohol spectrum disorder continuum: dysmorphic features,
physical growth, neurobehavioral development, and prenatal alcohol exposure. The settings
were 4 communities in the Rocky Mountain, Midwestern, Southeastern, and Pacific
Southwestern regions of the United States. First-grade children and their parents
or guardians were enrolled.
EXPOSURES Alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in the 4
communities was the main outcome. Conservative estimates for the prevalence of the
disorder and 95% CIs were calculated using the eligible first-grade population as the
denominator. Weighted prevalences and 95% CIs were also estimated, accounting for the
sampling schemes and using data restricted to children who received a full evaluation.
RESULTS A total of 6639 children were selected for participation from a population of 13 146
first-graders (boys, 51.9%; mean age, 6.7 years [SD, 0.41] and white maternal race, 79.3%).
A total of 222 cases of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders were identified. The conservative
prevalence estimates for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranged from 11.3 (95% CI, 7.8-15.8)
to 50.0 (95% CI, 39.9-61.7) per 1000 children. The weighted prevalence estimates for fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders ranged from 31.1 (95% CI, 16.1-54.0) to 98.5 (95% CI, 57.5-139.5)
per 1000 children.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Estimated prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
among first-graders in 4 US communities ranged from 1.1% to 5.0% using a conservative
approach. These findings may represent more accurate US prevalence estimates than
previous studies but may not be generalizable to all communities.

etal alcohol spectrum disorders, composed of fetal al-
cohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and
alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, are lead-
ingcausesofdevelopmentaldisabilitiesworldwide.1-3Thecom-
monly accepted estimate for the United States of 10 per 1000
childrenaffectedwasderivedfromclinic-basedstudiesorstud-
ies of single communities using small samples and different
research methods.4-6
Estimating the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum dis-
orders is challenging using routine surveillance methods; one
recentUSstudysuggestedthatchildrenwithfetalalcoholspec-
trum disorders are frequently not diagnosed (80%) or misdi-
agnosed (7%).7 As a result, standard methods of passive rec-
ord surveillance or clinic-based studies may have led to
underestimates.1-3,6
By contrast, active-case ascertainment methods that have
been applied in several other countries have resulted in higher
prevalence estimates.8-11 Similarly, a 2007-2009 single-site,
active-case ascertainment study12 conducted in US commu-
nities showed a prevalence rate for fetal alcohol syndrome and
partial fetal alcohol syndrome of 10.0 per 1000 children; an-
other 2010-2011 single site, active-case ascertainment study13
showed a prevalence rate for fetal alcohol spectrum disor-
ders of 24.0 per 1000 children. These data have highlighted
the need for a larger study with broader representation of US
communities with general population samples.
In 2010, the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism initiated the Collaboration on Fetal Alcohol Spec-
trum Disorders Prevalence consortium, which was chal-
lenged to use the best available research methods to estab-
lish prevalence estimates in US communities.14 These data are
needed to help determine the public health burden, identify
the need for clinical resources, and establish a baseline preva-
lence against which to measure progress in prevention.15
This article describes the prevalence of fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorders across 4 US sites using an active case–
ascertainment approach and applying standardized consen-
sus criteria for case classification.
Methods
Two research teams, both funded by the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to establish the consortium,16
were charged with determining the prevalence of fetal alco-
hol spectrum disorders in US communities using similar sam-
pling methods and identical assessment and classification cri-
teria. To this end, the investigators were asked to establish and
implement a common set of standards to define fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders, including full or partial fetal alcohol syn-
drome and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder.
Study Design
Active-case ascertainment with a cross-sectional design was
used at 4 community sites, a convenience sample that was se-
lected based on the investigators’ability to engage the indi-
vidual communities and on the feasibility of conducting the
study in that community. In each site, first-grade children in
public and private schools were recruited across 2 academic
years, yielding 8 independent samples. Data collection took
place between November 15, 2010, and July 12, 2016.
Study Population, Ethics, and Assessment of Participants
Fourstudysites,representingdiverseareasoftheUnitedStates,
included a Midwest community with a population of 172 000,
a Rocky Mountain site with a population of 60 000, a South-
east site with a population of 206 000, and an urban city in
the Pacific Southwest with a population of 1.4 million17 (for ad-
ditional demographic details, see eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). The specific locations of the sites could not be dis-
closed due to confidentiality requirements of the community
and school administrators at the sites.
Study approvals were secured from school administra-
tors at each site, and institutional review board approvals were
obtained at the investigators’respective academic institu-
tions.Federalcertificatesofconfidentialitywereobtainedfrom
the National Institutes of Health. Parents or guardians pro-
vided oral or written informed consent for screening and
written consent for full evaluations; children 7 years or older
provided written assent. Participants were provided mon-
etary and nonmonetary incentives for study completion that
were commensurate with the amount of time and travel re-
quired to complete the study. Parents or guardians received
summary information on their child’
s evaluations and were
provided referrals for services.
Assessment tools were selected for the 4 domains ger-
mane to the spectrum of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders:
growth, dysmorphology, neurodevelopment, and prenatal al-
cohol exposure.

Key Points
Question How common are fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in
the United States?
Findings In this cross-sectional study of 13 146 first-grade children
in 4 regions of the United States surveyed between 2010 and
2016, the most conservative prevalence estimate for fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders ranged from 11.3 to 50.0 per 1000 children.
Using a weighted approach, the estimated prevalence was 31.1 to
98.5 per 1000 children.
Meaning These findings may represent more accurate US
prevalence estimates than previous studies but may not be
generalizable to all communities.

tive skills (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Prenatal alcohol exposure was assessed through maternal
interviews conducted by trained study staff, in person or over
the telephone. Alcohol consumption questions were embed-
ded in a common core of queries regarding maternal health.
Specific questions assessed alcohol use prior to pregnancy rec-
ognitionandduringpregnancy,byquantity,frequency,andges-
tational timing. Social, legal, or medical problems related to al-
coholwereincludedasindicatorsofalcoholuse.Interviewdata
werecollectedfromconsentedcollateralsources,suchasaclose
relative, if the biological mother was absent. Cofactors of ma-
ternal risk were also captured, including demographics, prena-
tal care, maternal nutrition, and tobacco and recreational drug
use. Preexisting neurobehavioral diagnoses were elicited from
parentsorguardians.Race/ethnicitywascapturedasoneofthe
demographic characteristics for an epidemiological study.
Race/ethnic group was obtained from the parent or guardian
of the participating child and categorized according to pre-
defined National Institutes of Health categories.
Standardized Classification Criteria
Classificationcriteriabasedonfacialfeatures,growth,andchild
performance were selected by consensus among consortium
members. The clinical criteria were consistent with the pub-
lished “Updated clinical guidelines for diagnosing fetal alco-
hol spectrum disorders.
”18 However, as applied in this epide-
miological study, a less stringent cutoff of more than 1 standard
deviationbelowthemeanforspecificlearningimpairmentwas
usedas1ofthecriteriaforfetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.This
modificationwasadoptedbytheconsortiumtorepresentabal-
ance of sensitivity and specificity for classification among chil-
dren in the first-grade age range (eBox in the Supplement).
Cutoff criteria defining risky levels of alcohol consump-
tion in pregnancy were also established. Although docu-
mented alcohol exposure was not required when children had
sufficient physical traits to be classified as having full or par-
tial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol exposure during preg-
nancy at the predefined cutoff levels was required for alcohol-
related neurodevelopmental disorder.
Sampling Methods
Sampling and consenting processes varied across sites and
academic years based on local agreement, school access re-
quirements, and policies resulting in the different sampling
methods that were used (Figure).
In sampling method 1, used at the Midwest and Rocky
Mountainsites,allelementaryschoolsintheschooldistrictpar-
ticipated. At the Southeastern county site, all 5 schools in 1
school district participated; in the second school district in the
county, 9 of 19 elementary schools were randomly selected for
participation. All first-grade children whose parents or guard-
iansallowedtheirchildtoparticipateweremeasuredforweight,
height, and head circumference. Those whose measurements
were at the 25th percentile or lower received a dysmorphology
examination. In addition, a random sample of all children en-
rolledinfirst-gradeclasseswasselected,andthosewhoseparent
or guardian granted permission for their participation received
a dysmorphology examination. Those children who exhibited
alcohol-relatedphysicalfeaturesonthedysmorphologyexami-
nation and all randomly selected children went on to receive
neurobehavioral testing, and their mothers or collaterals were
asked to complete interviews. In addition, when a twin was se-
lected for full evaluation by any of the established screening
criteria, his/her co-twin was also selected for full evaluation.
Similarly, children referred by their teacher or repeating first
grade were also selected for full evaluation (Figure).
In sampling method 2, no screening was undertaken.
A simple random sample was selected from first-grade chil-
dren enrolled at all elementary schools in the community. All
selected children with consent were offered the full evalua-
tion, including the dysmorphology examination, neurobehav-
ioral testing, and the maternal or collateral interview.
In sampling method 3, the large population of the Pacific
Southwestern site required that a subsample of schools be se-
lected.Aconveniencesampleof27schoolswasselectedtopar-
ticipate.Ofthese,25wereselectedfromthe120regularelemen-
tary schools and 1 from the 26 charter schools in the public
school district. In addition, 1 of the 55 private or special needs
schools in the city participated. These schools were identified
asrepresentingdiversesocioeconomicandgeographicareasand
were led by school principals who indicated willingness to par-
ticipate in the study. From these schools, parents or guardians
were first asked for written permission to be contacted. Among
those who agreed to be contacted, consent was obtained for
screening for weight, height, or head circumference that was
at or lower than the 25th percentile. In addition, a child devel-
opment screening tool, Parents Evaluation of Development
Status,19wasadministeredtoeachparticipatingparentorguard-
ian. A report of 2 or more developmental concerns was consid-
eredapositivescreenresult.Arandomsamplewasdrawnfrom
participatingchildrenwhohadnegativeresultsforbothgrowth
andtheParentsEvaluationofDevelopmentStatus.Childrenwho
had positive screen results and those who had been selected
amongthegroupwhohadnegativescreenresultswerethenin-
vited, if their parents or guardians agreed, to receive the dys-
morphologyexamination,neurobehavioraltesting,andthema-
ternal or collateral interview. In addition, co-twins and teacher
referrals or children repeating first grade were eligible for the
full evaluation as described in sampling method 1.
In sampling methods 1 and 3, the strategy of initial screen-
ing on growth, developmental concerns, or both narrowed the
pool of children eligible for the full fetal alcohol spectrum dis-
orders evaluation. This allowed for more efficient use of re-
sourcesbyonlyprovidingfullevaluationstothosechildrenwho
could have met 1 of the required criteria for 1 or more classifi-
cations. This strategy was coupled with a random sampling
to include children not selected through the screening pro-
cess.Thisadditionalstrategyprovidedtheopportunitytoiden-
tify children who would have been missed on either screening
measure, particularly those children who may have alcohol-
related neurodevelopmental disorder.
Consistent Application of Criteria

the respective study teams in case conferences, and a fetal

 that site for that year as the denominator. In sampling meth-
ods 1 and 3, the term eligible children was defined as all chil-
drenenrolledintheparticipatingfirst-gradeclassesinthatyear.
Insamplingmethod2,thedenominatorwasdefinedasthetotal
number of children who were selected randomly at each site
(consented and not consented). The conservative approach as-
sumed that children who were not evaluated did not have fe-
talalcoholspectrumdisorders.Theseprevalenceestimatesrep-
resented the minimum prevalence for a community in a given
year (formulas are in the Formulas for Calculation of the Preva-
lence by Sampling Method section of the Supplement).
The second set of estimates used a weighting technique
to consistently estimate the prevalence and 95% CIs account-
ing in sampling methods 1 and 3 for the proportions of chil-
dren who screened positive for growth or developmental con-
cerns or who were randomly selected and restricting the
denominators in all 3 sampling methods to children with suf-
ficient information to be classified as having a fetal alcohol
spectrum disorder. In this approach data were assumed to be
missingcompletelyatrandom,ie,childrenwhowerenotevalu-
ated had the same prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum dis-
orders as those completing the evaluation. This included chil-
dren not consented and those who did not complete all
components of the evaluation. Open-source statistical pro-
gramminglanguageandenvironmentRversion3.4.1wasused.
Weighted estimates of the prevalence of fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorders and its continuum of specific diagnoses were
generally of the form ΣJ
j=1wjXj/nj, for which J represents the
number of subpopulations from which the samples were
drawn; Xj represents the number of children with fetal alco-
hol spectrum disorders or other specific diagnosis identified
among the nj children who had been fully evaluated and drawn
from subpopulation j, wj = Nj/N, for which Nj represents the
sizeofthesubpopulationj;andNrepresentsthesizeofthetotal
population so that ΣJ
j= 1wj = 1. This is equivalent to weighting
bytheinverseprobabilityofsampling.Asaspecialcase,insam-
pling method 2, for which simple random sampling was used,
J = 1 and w1= 1. In sampling method 1, J = 3 for both full and
partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and the subpopulations were
(1) small (ie, weight, height, or head circumference ≤25th per-
centile), (2) not small, and (3) twin or referral. For alcohol-
related neurodevelopmental disorder and total fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders in sampling method 1, J = 4 and the sub-
populations were (1) small and with alcohol-related physical
features, (2) small but without alcohol-related physical fea-
tures, (3) not small, and (4) twin or referral. For total fetal al-
cohol spectrum disorders and for j =2, X2 was the number of
children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder in
thecorrespondingsubsample.Insamplingmethod3,J = 2,and
the subpopulations were (1) positive screen result and (2) nega-
tive screen result. More computational details, sampling dia-
gram, and a working example are provided in the Formula for
Calculation of the Prevalence by Sampling Method section and
eFigure 3 of the Supplement.
To obtain CIs for the prevalence estimates, the variance of
the estimated prevalence was estimated by ΣJ
j = 1w2
j var
(p_hat), for which pj = Xj/nj. For sampling methods 1 and 2,
var(pj) = pj(1−pj)/nj. For sampling method 3, cluster sampling
(for which cluster indicates school) was accounted for using
nonparametric bootstrap, by resampling with replacement
clusters(ie,schools)with10 000bootstrapruns.Log-logtrans-
formation and normal approximation were then used to ob-
tain CIs of the prevalence. See the Variance Estimates and Con-
fidence Intervals section in the Supplement.
Results
Participating classrooms had an enrollment of 13 146 children
overallyears.Ofthese,6054childrenwerescreenedongrowth,
development, or both. An additional 585 were randomly se-
lected in the sampling method 2 sites to receive the dysmor-
phology examination. A total of 3083 dysmorphology exami-
nations were provided, 1898 maternal or collateral interviews
were completed, 2173 children completed the cognitive-
behavioral battery, and 2962 children were evaluated for a fe-
tal alcohol spectrum disorder classification in case confer-
ences (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Data from 1 academic
year (2010-2011) in the first Midwestern sample have been
published13 but were incorporated into the overall prevalence
estimates using the more current consortium criteria for clas-
sification. Consent rates for screening among eligible children
rangedfrom36.9%to92.5%andaveraged59.9%acrossallsites.
Characteristics of the mothers who completed the mater-
nal interview and their children by site are shown in Table 1.
Sampling method 1 was used at 3 sites, 2 for only 1 academic
year and 1 for both academic years. Sampling method 2 was
used at 2 sites for 1 academic year each. Sampling method 3
was used at 1 site for both academic years (Table 2).
Applying the study diagnostic criteria across all samples,
222 children were classified with a fetal alcohol spectrum dis-
order. Of these, 27 met criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome, 104
met criteria for partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and 91 met cri-
teriaforalcohol-relatedneurodevelopmentaldisorder(Table2).
Only 2 of the 222 children classified with a fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorder had been diagnosed previously with the disor-
der, although many parents and guardians were aware of the
learning and behavioral challenges facing their children.
The conservative prevalence estimates and 95% CIs for fe-
tal alcohol spectrum disorders for the samples across all study
sites are presented in Table 2. The total number of fetal alco-
hol spectrum disorder cases in the numerator for sampling
method 1 was 103 children; for sampling method 2, 28 chil-
dren; and for sampling method 3, 91 children. The prevalence
estimates varied by sample, site, and sampling method. The

tween 19% and 50% of the larger eligible number of children
used as the denominators for the more conservative esti-
mates. The weighted estimates assumed that the estimated

ated children was applicable to those children not evaluated.
With respect to the specific categories, shown in Table 3,
the weighted prevalence estimates for fetal alcohol syn-
drome ranged from 0 (95% CI, 0.00-12.7) to 7.8 (95% CI, 4.2-

overall prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in any
sample. The prevalence estimates for partial fetal alcohol syn-
dromerangedfrom8.4(95%CI,0.0-20.2)to59.1(95%CI,26.7-
91.6) per 1000 children. The prevalence estimates for alcohol-
related neurodevelopmental disorder ranged from 9.7 (95% CI,

Theprimaryfindingwasaconservativelyestimatedprevalence
of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders across 4 sites in the United
States that ranged from 11.3 (95% CI, 7.8-15.8) to 50.0 (95% CI,
39.9-61.7) per 1000 children. Using a weighted prevalence ap-

lence estimates using this approach ranged from 31.1 (95% CI,
16.1-54.0) to 98.5 (95% CI, 57.5-139.5) per 1000 children.
Three recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
global data on the worldwide prevalence of fetal alcohol syn-
drome or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders have been
published.1-3 However, there were few US studies included in
these meta-analyses, and those studies that met criteria for in-
clusion were predominately clinic based or used passive sur-
veillance. All previous studies were conducted at single sites,
and only 5 used complete active case ascertainment, includ-
ing 1 sample that was incorporated into the present study.13

 8-year-old children in 11 surveillance sites across the United
States was 14.6 per 1000 children.28
Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol
and Related Conditions documented an increase in alcohol use
among women between the 2001-2002 and 2012-2013 sur-
vey years. In particular, consumption of 4 or more standard
drinks at least weekly in the past 12 months increased by 14%
to 37% in women aged 18 through 44 years.26 In a US Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey administered be-
tween 2011 and 2013 that included 198 098 nonpregnant
women of reproductive age, an estimated 53.6% of respon-
dents reported recent alcohol consumption and 18.2% re-
ported drinking 4 or more standard drinks on at least 1 occa-
sion (ie, binge episodes) in the past 30 days. Among the 8383
pregnant women in the sample, an estimated 10.2% reported
any recent drinking and 3.1% reported at least 1 binge episode
in the last 30 days.26 A pattern of binge drinking in pregnancy
is thought to present the highest risk of fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorders among offspring.
In this study, 2 of 222 children with fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorders were known to have been previously diag-
nosed with the disorder. These data confirm that missed di-
agnoses and misdiagnoses of children are common.7 Similarly,
in a previous school-based US sample, only 1 of 7 children iden-
tified with fetal alcohol syndrome had a previous diagnosis29;
in another, only 2 of 26 children identified with full or partial
fetal alcohol syndrome had a previous diagnosis.12
This study has several strengths. First, active case ascer-
tainment was used in first-grade cohorts to obtain general
population prevalence data in 4 communities. Second, the
5- to 7-year age range was optimal for identification of physi-
cal features associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
and suitable for early evaluation of neurobehavioral prob-
lems linked to alcohol exposure. Third, children were identi-
fied using face-to-face, blinded examinations provided by dys-
morphologists with extensive experience in fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders and the ability to rule out other disorders
with similar phenotypes. Fourth, standardized neurobehav-
ioral testing was conducted in a blinded manner by locally cer-
tifiedexaminers.Fifth,maternalandcollateralinterviewsused
validated techniques for capturing detailed information on al-
cohol use in pregnancy and maternal risks. Sixth, a priori com-
mon criteria for classification were agreed upon by multidis-
ciplinaryresearchersandadvisorsfortheconsortium,andthey
were applied consistently across sites. In addition, data were
collected in such a manner that other diagnostic schema for
fetalalcoholspectrumdisordersthatarecurrentlyinuseorthat
are developed in the future could be applied.
Limitations
Thisstudyhasseverallimitations.First,duetolocalpolicyvaria-
tions in the modes of access allowed for recruitment of chil-
dren, as well as variability in willingness to consent, no indi-
vidualsampleevaluatedtheentireeligiblepopulation.Consent
rates for screening ranged from 36.9% to 92.5% in individual
samples and overall consent rates for screening averaged only
59.9% of eligible children (eTable 2 in the Supplement). If non-
consentedchildrendifferedfromconsented,thiscouldhavebi-
asedprevalenceestimatesineitherdirection.Second,thenum-
bersofcasesofeachcategoryoffetalalcoholspectrumdisorders
in each sample are small, leading to wide CIs. Third, neurobe-
havioraltestingatthisagemayhavemissedsomechildrenwith
deficits that would not become apparent until later ages, which
could have led to underestimation of rates. Fourth, this cross-
sectionalstudywasneitheralongitudinalnoraclinicalsample.

longitudinalprevalencestudies.Fifth,thecriteriadefiningneu-
robehavioral impairment in this study were selected to bal-
ance sensitivity for deficits that have functional consequences
with specificity for the characteristic neurobehavioral do-
mains known to be affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The
objective was to produce prevalence estimates across multiple
communities using a one-time evaluation to identify children
with measurable deficits consistent with prenatal alcohol ex-
posure. However, in the absence of a definitive biomarker for
fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, it is impossible to know what
proportion of these deficits were caused by fetal alcohol expo-
sure. Therefore, prevalence estimates, particularly for alcohol-
related neurodevelopmental disorder, could be overesti-
mated. In addition, the 4 communities in this study may not be
representative of the United States overall. The sample-by-
sample variability in prevalence estimates may be due in part
to the low absolute number of children classified in each cat-
egory of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. However, variability
acrosssitesmayalsoberepresentativeofthediversitythatwould

sumptionreportedamongwomenacrosstheUnitedStates.26,27
Conclusions
Estimated prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
among first-graders in 4 US communities ranged from 1.1% to
5.0% using a conservative approach. These findings may rep-
resent more accurate US prevalence estimates than previous
studies, but may not be generalizable to all communities.
