abstract
BACKGROUND: Peer victimization is common among youth and associated with substance 
use. Yet, few studies have examined these associations longitudinally or the psychological 
processes whereby peer victimization leads to substance use. The current study examined 
whether peer victimization in early adolescence is associated with alcohol, marijuana, and 
tobacco use in mid- to late adolescence, as well as the role of depressive symptoms in these 
associations.
METHODS: Longitudinal data were collected between 2004 and 2011 from 4297 youth in 
Birmingham, Alabama; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles County, California. Data were 
analyzed by using structural equation modeling.
RESULTS: The hypothesized model fit the data well (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation 
[RMSEA] = 0.02; Comparative Fit Index [CFI] = 0.95). More frequent experiences of peer 
victimization in the fifth grade were associated with greater depressive symptoms in the 
seventh grade (B[SE] = 0.03[0.01]; P < .001), which, in turn, were associated with a greater 
likelihood of alcohol use (B[SE] = 0.03[0.01]; P = .003), marijuana use (B[SE] = 0.05[0.01]; 
P < .001), and tobacco use (B[SE] = 0.05[0.01]; P < .001) in the tenth grade. Moreover, fifth-
grade peer victimization was indirectly associated with tenth-grade substance use via the 
mediator of seventh-grade depressive symptoms, including alcohol use (B[SE] = 0.01[0.01]; 
P = .006), marijuana use (B[SE] = 0.01[0.01]; P < .001), and tobacco use (B[SE] = 0.02[0.01];  
P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Youth who experienced more frequent peer victimization in the fifth grade 
were more likely to use substances in the tenth grade, showing that experiences of peer 
victimization in early adolescence may have a lasting impact by affecting substance 
use behaviors during mid- to late adolescence. Interventions are needed to reduce peer 
victimization among youth and to support youth who have experienced victimization.

The American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends that pediatricians 
take steps to prevent, identify, 
and treat substance use, including 
alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco 
use, among youth because of its 
harmful effects on adolescent 
health and development.1 
– 
3 Alcohol 
and marijuana use are associated 
with physical injury (eg, motor 
vehicle accidents) and risky 
health behaviors (eg, condomless 
intercourse), and may interfere 
with brain development.1, 
2 Tobacco 
use is associated with respiratory 
illness and infection, development 
of nicotine addiction, and a lifetime 
risk of cancers and early death.3 A 
growing body of research suggests 
that youth who are targets of peer 
victimization, or intentionally 
harmful actions from other youth, 
4, 
 
5  
are at risk of using and misusing 
substances.6 
– 
10 Yet, few studies have 
examined the processes whereby 
peer victimization leads to greater 
substance use among youth. The 
self-medication hypothesis posits 
that people engage in substance use 
to relieve painful emotions and/or 
control their feelings.11, 
12 Although 
these processes are understudied 
among youth, evidence suggests that 
internalizing problems, characterized 
by inhibition and negative mood 
states, plays a role in associations 
between peer victimization and 
substance use.7, 
 
13, 
 
14 In particular, 
peer victimization may promote 
depressive symptoms, 
15 
– 
18 which, 
in turn, may lead to greater youth 
substance use.19, 
 
20
Youth are typically at greatest risk 
of peer victimization during late 
childhood and early adolescence, 
with rates of victimization 
decreasing through the remainder 
of adolescence.4 Research suggests 
that certain youth experience more 
frequent peer victimization than 
their peers. For example, youth 
living with socially devalued, or 
stigmatized, characteristics (eg, 
sexual minority orientation, obesity, 
chronic health conditions) often 
experience more peer victimization 
than other youth.4, 
 
21, 
 
22 Moreover, 
some research suggests that boys 
experience more of some types 
of peer victimization than girls 
(eg, physical aggression).4, 
 
23 In 
contrast, substance use increases 
through adolescence. Substance 
use trajectories show marked 
increases in mid- to late adolescence, 
with many youth trying alcohol, 
marijuana, and tobacco by age 18.24 
– 
26 
Given these trends of decreasing 
peer victimization and increasing 
substance use through adolescence, it 
is possible that associations between 
peer victimization and substance 
use emerge longitudinally. That 
is, youth who are bullied early in 
adolescence may be more likely 
to engage in substance use by 
mid- to late adolescence. Indeed, 
a small but growing body of work 
suggests that early experiences of 
peer victimization are linked to 
worse mental health and greater 
engagement in health risk behaviors 
during early adulthood.4, 
 
27  
Little work to date has examined 
the longitudinal impact of peer 
victimization on substance use over 
the course of adolescence.
In the current study, we aimed to 
examine whether experiences of peer 
victimization in early adolescence are 
associated with alcohol, marijuana, 
and tobacco use by mid- to late 
adolescence. We hypothesized that 
depressive symptoms mediate 
this association, such that more 
frequent peer victimization leads 
to more depressive symptoms, and 
more depressive symptoms lead to 
greater likelihood of substance use. 
We therefore tested a longitudinal 
mediational model to determine 
whether peer victimization in 
the fifth grade is associated with 
a greater likelihood of substance 
use in the tenth grade via the 
mediator of depressive symptoms 
in the seventh grade. Given previous 
research on gender differences in 
peer victimization and substance 
use, 
7 we further explored whether 
the model differed between boys 
and girls. A better understanding of 
the long-term implications of peer 
victimization on substance use, 
as well as the role of depressive 
symptoms in these associations, 
may inform pediatricians’ efforts to 
address substance use among youth.
MeThods
Procedures and Participants
Data were drawn from Healthy 
Passages, a 3-wave longitudinal 
study of risk and protective factors 
in adolescent health.15, 
 
22, 
 
28, 
 
29 
Participants were recruited from 25 
contiguous public school districts in 
Los Angeles County, California; 10 
contiguous districts in Birmingham, 
Alabama; and the largest district 
in Houston, Texas. Schools within 
districts were randomly sampled. 
Parents of all youth within sampled 
schools were invited to participate in 
the study. The baseline assessment 
included 5147 youth, 4297 of whom 
participated in all 3 waves of data 
collection.
Data were collected via computer-
assisted personal interviews, as well 
as audio computer-assisted self-
interviews for sensitive information 
(eg, substance use). Height and 
weight were measured to calculate 
BMI. Data collection started when 
students were in the fifth grade in 
August 2004 through September 
2006, and continued 2 and then 3 
years later when most students were 
in the seventh and tenth grades. 
Parents provided written informed 
consent, and youth provided assent. 
Study procedures were approved by 
institutional review boards at each 
study site and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.
Measures
Parents and youth provided 
information on sociodemographic 
characteristics in the fifth grade, 
2

www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 PEDIATRICS Volume 139, number 6, June 2017
including age, gender, race/ethnicity, 
chronic illnesses, highest educational 
achievement in the household, and 
family household income. Youth 
provided information on sexual 
orientation in the tenth grade, 
and were characterized as sexual 
minorities if they indicated that they 
were not 100% heterosexual or 
straight or not attracted only to the 
other sex.22 All other data, including 
substance use, peer victimization, 
and depressive symptoms, were 
collected from youth at all 3 time 
points.
Substance Use
Students were asked about their use 
of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana in 
the past 30 days with items adapted 
from the Youth Risk Behavior 
Surveillance Study.30 We focused 
on these substances because they 
are the most prevalent among 
adolescents, and we focused on 
the past 30 days to capture current 
substance use. Substance use data 
were analyzed dichotomously to 
represent no versus some recent use.
Peer Victimization
Youth reported on peer victimization 
that they have experienced at school 
and other places (but not at home 
with siblings) within the past 12 
months in response to the 6-item 
Peer Experience Questionnaire.5 
Example items include “How often 
do kids kick or push you in a mean 
way?” and “How often do kids tell 
nasty things about you to others?” 
Response options ranged from 
“never” (1) to “a few times a week” 
(5). The scale had adequate reliability 
(fifth-grade α = .85).
Depressive Symptoms
Depressive symptoms were 
measured with 6 items from the 
depressive subscale of the Diagnostic 
Interview Schedule for Children 
Predictive Scales (fifth-grade α = .62; 
seventh-grade α = .71).31
data analyses
Attrition from baseline to follow-up 
was low (16.5%), and the effects 
of attrition on the composition of 
the sample were accounted for by 
the use of longitudinal weights. In 
combination with baseline weights, 
these weights also accounted for 
sampling and nonresponse. We first 
characterized the sociodemographic 
characteristics of the sample in 
SPSS version 23 (IBM Corporation, 
Armonk, NY). We then examined 
all correlations among fifth-grade 
peer victimization, seventh-grade 
depressive symptoms, and tenth-
grade substance use. Pearson’s 
correlations were used for 
correlations between continuous 
variables (ie, peer victimization  
and depressive symptoms),  
point-biserial correlations were  
used for correlations between 
continuous and dichotomous 
variables (eg, peer victimization 
and alcohol use), and Spearman’s 
ρ correlations were used for 
correlations between dichotomous 
variables (eg, alcohol use and 
marijuana use).
We conducted the remaining 
analyses as structural equation 
models in Mplus 7 (Muthén & 
Muthén, Los Angeles, CA). We 
first identified correlates of peer 
victimization by regressing fifth-
grade peer victimization on all 
sociodemographic characteristics. 
Next, we modeled paths between 
fifth-grade peer victimization and 
seventh-grade depressive symptoms, 
and between seventh-grade 
depressive symptoms and tenth-
grade substance use. We examined 
alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco 
use independently due to evidence 
suggesting heterogeneity in patterns 
of their use during adolescence, 
32, 
 
33  
and given that screeners typically 
assess each substance used  
rather than their combination.34 
Guided by recommendations for  
longitudinal mediation analyses, 
35  
we controlled for previous time 
points of depressive symptoms 
and substance use (ie, the effect of 
fifth-grade depressive symptoms 
on seventh-grade depressive 
symptoms, and seventh-grade 
substance use on tenth-grade 
substance use). We further controlled 
for correlates of fifth-grade peer 
victimization and all remaining 
sociodemographic characteristics 
with tenth-grade substance use. 
We used bootstrapping to acquire 
bias-corrected indirect effects of 
fifth-grade peer victimization on 
tenth-grade substance use via 
seventh-grade depressive symptoms. 
Finally, we conducted a χ2 difference 
test to determine whether the model 
fit differently among boys versus 
girls.
ResulTs
Sociodemographic characteristics 
of participating youth are shown 
in Table 1. The sample was 
approximately evenly divided 
between boys (51.1%) and girls 
(48.9%). Youth were identified 
as Latino/Latina (44.4%), African 
American (29.1%), and white 
(22.1%). At baseline, 22.7% of youth 
had a chronic health condition and 
25.3% were obese. The highest 
educational achievement in the 
household included some high 
school (23.1%), high school graduate 
(21.4%), some college (24.6%), 
and college graduate (28.9%). Most 
youth (62.4%) lived in a household 
with an annual income of <$50 000, 
including 37.9% with annual incomes 
<$25 000. In the tenth grade, 14.4% 
of youth were categorized as sexual 
minorities.
As shown in Table 2, 24.0% of tenth-
graders reported recent alcohol 
use, 15.2% reported marijuana use, 
and 11.7% reported tobacco use. 
Fifth-grade peer victimization was 
positively correlated with seventh-
grade depressive symptoms (r = 
0.19, P < .001), indicating that youth 
who experienced more frequent 
3

peer victimization in the fifth 
grade reported greater depressive 
symptoms in the seventh grade. In 
addition, seventh-grade depressive 
symptoms were positively but 
weakly correlated with tenth-grade 
alcohol use (r = 0.06, P < .001), 
marijuana use (r = 0.06, P < .001), 
and tobacco use (r = 0.07, P < .001), 
indicating that youth who reported 
greater depressive symptoms in the 
seventh grade were more likely to 
have used substances in the tenth 
grade.
Sexual minority youth (B[SE] = 
0.96[0.26]; P < .001), youth living 
with chronic illnesses (B[SE] = 
0.60[0.22]; P = .006), and boys (B[SE] = 
 
1.13[0.17]; P < .001) reported more 
frequent peer victimization in the 
fifth grade. Age, obesity, race/
ethnicity, household educational 
achievement, and family household 
income were not associated with 
frequency of peer victimization. 
We therefore controlled for the 
effects of sexual orientation, chronic 
illness status, and gender on peer 
victimization and the effects of 
all remaining sociodemographic 
characteristics on substance use in 
the structural equation model.
Results of the structural equation 
model are presented in Fig 1. The 
model fit the data well (Root Mean 
Square Error of Approximation 
[RMSEA] = 0.02; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.01–0.02; Comparative Fit 
Index [CFI] = 0.95; χ2[72] = 131.97;  
P < .01). More frequent fifth-grade 
peer victimization was associated 
with greater seventh-grade depressive 
symptoms (B[SE] = 0.03[0.01];  
P < .001), controlling for fifth-grade 
depressive symptoms. In turn, 
greater seventh-grade depressive 
symptoms were associated with a 
greater likelihood of tenth-grade 
alcohol use (B[SE] = 0.03[0.01]; 
P = .003), marijuana use (B[SE] = 
0.05[0.01]; P < .001), and tobacco 
use (B[SE] = 0.05[0.01]; P < .001), 
controlling for seventh-grade alcohol, 
marijuana, and tobacco use. The

analysis of indirect effects estimated 
with bootstrapping revealed that 
fifth-grade peer victimization 
was associated with tenth-grade 
substance use via the mediator of 
seventh-grade depressive symptoms, 
including alcohol use (B[SE] = 
0.01[0.01]; P = .006), marijuana use 
(B[SE] = 0.01[0.01]; P < .001), and 
tobacco use (B[SE] = 0.02[0.01];  
P < .001). Therefore, more frequent 
experiences of peer victimization in 
the fifth grade were associated with 
greater depressive symptoms in the 
seventh grade, which, in turn, were 
associated with a greater likelihood 
of substance use in the tenth grade. 
As indicated by the R2 statistics, 
the model accounted for modest 
percentages of the variance in 
substance use (alcohol = 10.8%  
[SE = 0.02], marijuana = 4.0% [SE =  
0.01], and tobacco = 9.1% [SE = 0.02]).
The χ2 difference test suggested 
that the overall model fit differently 
for boys and girls (χ2[36] = 
59.77; P = .01). The main paths of 
interest were similar for boys and 
girls, with statistically significant 
associations between fifth-grade 
peer victimization with seventh-
grade depressive symptoms, and 
seventh-grade depressive symptoms 
with tenth-grade substance use. 
Associations between substance 
use and 1 of the control variables, 
however, differed between boys and 
girls. Specifically, sexual minority 
status was more strongly related to 
alcohol use among girls than boys 
(B[SE] = 0.23[0.10]; P = .02 versus 
B[SE] = 0.14[0.05]; P = .01); it was 
also related to greater likelihood 
of marijuana and tobacco use 
among girls but unrelated to these 
types of substance use among boys 
(marijuana: B[SE] = 0.30[0.11];  
P = .01 among girls versus B[SE] = 
−0.01[0.04]; P = .94 among boys; 
tobacco: B[SE] = 0.13[0.07]; P = 
.05 among girls versus B[SE] = 
−0.04[0.03]; P = .24 among boys). 
An additional χ2 test including the 
main paths between fifth-grade 
peer victimization, seventh-grade 
depressive symptoms, and tenth-
grade substance use, and excluding 
the controls, suggested that the 
model fit similarly for boys and girls 
(χ2[4] = 6.10; P = .19).
discussion
The current study indicates that 
experiences of peer victimization 
in early adolescence may have a 
lasting impact, affecting mental 
health and substance use behaviors 
during mid- to late adolescence. 
More specifically, our results from 
3 US metropolitan areas show that 
youth who experience more frequent 
peer victimization in the fifth grade 
are more likely to engage in alcohol, 
marijuana, and tobacco use in 
the tenth grade. The mediational 
pathways are consistent for all 
examined substances; more frequent 
experiences of peer victimization in 
the fifth grade are associated with 
more depressive symptoms in the 
seventh grade, which, in turn, are 
associated with a greater likelihood

of substance use in the tenth 
grade. Associations are similar for 
boys and girls. These findings are 
consistent with the self-medication 
hypothesis of substance use, which 
suggests that individuals engage 
in substance use to cope with or 
relieve painful emotions.11, 
 
12 Of note, 
sexual minority youth, youth living 
with chronic illnesses, and boys in 
our sample reported more frequent 
bullying in the fifth grade than their 
peers.
This study addresses important 
gaps in the literature on associations 
between peer victimization and 
substance use. To date, the majority 
of work examining these associations 
has been cross-sectional.7 Our 
study adds to a small, but growing, 
body of research examining 
longitudinal associations between 
peer victimization and substance use 
across adolescence. The longitudinal 
design allowed us to show that fifth-
grade peer victimization contributes 
to seventh-grade depressive 
symptoms above and beyond the 
substantial effect of fifth-grade 
depressive symptoms on seventh-
grade depressive symptoms, and 
similarly, seventh-grade depressive 
symptoms contribute to tenth-grade 
substance use above and beyond 
the substantial effect of seventh-
grade substance use on tenth-grade 
substance use. A recent review article 
identified only 1 other study that 
examined whether internalizing 
symptoms mediate associations 
between peer victimization and 
substance use among youth.7, 
 
16 
This work identified depressive 
symptoms as a mediator, but relied 
on cross-sectional data with tenth-
grade students. Our work provides 
additional support for these findings 
with longitudinal data drawn from a 
multisite study with a diverse sample 
of 4297 youth, enhancing confidence 
in the generalizability of results.
This study used self-report measures 
of engagement in substance use 
in the past 30 days. Yet, validated 
measures were used from the Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance Study, 
30  
and rates of reported substance 
use were comparable to national 
samples.32 In addition, our measures 
do not differentiate between 
substance use and substance misuse 
or disordered use. Understanding 
the role of peer victimization in 
the development of substance use 
disorders is an important area for 
future research.
We focused on understanding 
the role of depressive symptoms 
in associations between peer 
victimization and substance use. 
It has been proposed that other 
processes, such as traumatic stress, 
poor academic achievement, and 
absenteeism, may further play 
important roles in associations 
between peer victimization and 
substance use.7 In addition, youth 
involved in peer victimization 
as both targets and perpetrators 
may be at particularly high risk of 
substance use.36 Sociodemographic 
and/or stigmatized characteristics, 
such as sexual minority orientation, 
as well as psychosocial processes, 
such as social support and school 
connectedness, may moderate 
these associations.7 More work is 
needed to continue to understand 
why peer victimization, including 
victimization and perpetration of 
harmful behavior, is associated 
with substance use and to better 
characterize for which youth the 
association is strongest. Future 
analyses that include more variables 
relevant to these associations may 
account for a greater percentage of 
the variance in substance use than 
the current model.
Moreover, research may continue 
to examine why certain youth are at 
greater risk of peer victimization and, 
in turn, its negative health sequelae. 
For example, youth in the current 
study who identified as sexual 
minorities in the tenth grade had 
experienced more frequent bullying 
in the fifth grade, likely before many 
had disclosed or recognized their 
minority sexual orientation.22, 
 
37 
Nonconforming gender expression 
may play a role in these youth’s 
experiences of peer victimization: 
gender-nonconforming youth are 
at greater risk of peer victimization 
due to their real or perceived sexual 
minority orientation.38
conclusions
Pediatricians have an opportunity 
to play an important role in 
supporting youth experiencing peer 
victimization.39, 
 
40 All youth should 
be screened for peer victimization, 
depressive symptoms, and 
substance use in health care settings. 
Pediatricians might offer counsel to 
youth experiencing victimization, 
including recommendations 
regarding approaching teachers 
and other school staff for support, 
given that supportive adults at 
school can buffer youth from the 
effects of peer victimization on 
substance use.8 Moreover, youth 
experiencing depressive symptoms 
and substance use should be offered 
treatment when needed. Ultimately, 
pediatricians, parents, and school 
representatives can work together 
to address peer victimization and 
prevent substance use among youth.
