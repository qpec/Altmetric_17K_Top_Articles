EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This executive summary will provide a brief overview of
consensus statements on sonography in hypotension
and cardiac
arrest (SHoC) recommended by the
International
Federation
for
Emergency
Medicine
(IFEM) for use in emergency medicine (EM).
Purpose
As point of care ultrasound (PoCUS) has become an
established tool in the initial management of patients with
undifferentiated hypotension and during cardiac arrest, the
Ultrasound Special Interest Group (USIG) of IFEM was
tasked to provide consensus guidance for use in EM that
was designed to be widely implementable internationally,
and which was targeted at likely etiologies as well as guiding
resuscitation. The protocols were also aimed at minimizing
interruption of ongoing resuscitation. A hierarchical model
was proposed, to be developed by expert consensus based
upon disease incidence, previously published protocols, and
the medical literature. A practical checklist was to be
developed, along with a standardized approach to the
performance of scans based upon a “4 F” approach: fluid,
form, function, filling.
Consensus approach
We summarized the recorded incidence of PoCUS find-
ings from two international multicentre prospective studies

 in addition to a checklist to guide clinicians incorporating
PoCUS into the resuscitation of the arrested patient based
on the current literature. Rates of abnormal PoCUS find-
ings were presented to an international expert panel, and
using this data we obtained the input of a panel of inter-
national experts associated with five professional organiza-
tions led by IFEM. Using a modified Delphi approach,
after three rounds of the survey, agreement was reached on
SHoC-hypotension and SHoC-cardiac arrest protocols
comprising core, supplementary, and additional views for
each situation, emphasising the importance of clinical
probability to guide the priority of scanning. Agreement
was also reached on the contents of the checklist.
Recommendations
This international consensus, based on prospectively
collected disease incidence, describes two Sonography
in Hypotension and Cardiac Arrest (SHoC) protocols,
comprising of the stepwise clinical-indication based
approach of Core, Supplementary, and Additional
PoCUS views.
The SHoC-hypotension protocol contains:
Core views focusing on determining the category of shock,
whether cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic, and consisting of:
1. Basic cardiac views (primarily the sub-xiphoid win-
dow, or parasternal long axis window for pericardial
fluid, cardiac form and ventricular function);
2. Lung views for pleural fluid and B-lines for filling
status; and
3. Inferior vena cava (IVC) views for filling status.
Supplementary views consisting of other cardiac
views;
with
Additional
views
performed
where
clinically indicated (e.g., AAA; pelvic; DVT).
The SHoC-cardiac arrest protocol contains:
Core views, limited to cardiac windows (primarily sub-
xiphoid
or
parasternal
long
axis)
and
must
be
performed during the rhythm check pause in chest
compressions, without causing prolonged interruption
in chest compressions. These windows should be used
to look for pericardial fluid, as well as examining

 ABSTRACT
Introduction: The International Federation for Emergency
Medicine (IFEM) Ultrasound Special Interest Group (USIG)
was tasked with development of a hierarchical consensus
approach to the use of point of care ultrasound (PoCUS) in
patients with hypotension and cardiac arrest.
Methods: The IFEM USIG invited 24 recognized international
leaders in PoCUS from emergency medicine and critical care
to form an expert panel to develop the sonography in
hypotension and cardiac arrest (SHoC) protocol. The panel
was provided with reported disease incidence, along with a
list of recommended PoCUS views from previously published
protocols and guidelines. Using a modified Delphi methodol-
ogy the panel was tasked with integrating the disease
incidence, their clinical experience and their knowledge of
the medical literature to evaluate what role each view should
play in the proposed SHoC protocol.
Results: Consensus on the SHoC protocols for hypotension
and
cardiac
arrest
was

Méthode: Le groupe d’intérêt a invité 24 sommités en matière
d’EPS à l’échelle internationale, provenant des services de
médecine d’urgence et de soins intensifs, pour former un
groupe d’experts afin d’élaborer un protocole sur l’utilisation
de
l’échographie
dans
les
cas
d’hypotension
et
dans
les cas d’arrêt cardiaque. On a fourni au groupe d’experts
l’incidence des maladies concernées ainsi qu’une liste de
recommandations sur des prises de vue par EPS, tirées de
protocoles et de lignes directrices déjà publiés. Par la
suite, on a demandé au groupe d’intégrer l’incidence des
maladies concernées, leur expérience clinique et leur con-
naissance de la documentation médicale en la matière
afin d’évaluer, selon une version modifiée de la méthode
Delphi, le rôle de chacune des prises de vue dans le protocole
SHoC (« Sonography in hypotension and cardiac arrest »)
proposé.
Résultats: Le groupe en est arrivé à un consensus, après trois
tours de sondage selon la version modifiée de la méthode
Delphi, sur le protocole SHoC à appliquer dans les cas
d’hypotension et dans les cas d’arrêt cardiaque. La version
définitive du protocole ainsi que la liste de vérification des
opérateurs ont été approuvées après avoir fait l’objet d’un
consensus plus de 80 % des membres. Des prises de vue par
EPS, divisées en catégories de base, supplémentaire et
additionnelle, sont recommandées dans le protocole définitif,
approuvé par l’IFEM. Les prises de vue de base dans les cas
d’hypotension
comprennent
des
clichés
du
cœur,
des
poumons et de la veine cave inférieure (VCI), complétés par
ventricular form (e.g., right heart strain) and function,
(e.g., asystole versus organized cardiac activity).
Supplementary views consisting of lung (for sliding
or fluid) and IVC views; with Additional views such as
confirmation of endotracheal tube placement or exclu-
sion of aortic aneurysm performed when clinically
indicated.
An operational checklist for the use of PoCUS during
cardiac arrest is provided and includes the following key
steps:
1. Team briefing
2. Preparing the ultrasound machine prior to patient
arrival (if time permits)
3. Performing the scan during breaks in CPR
4. Reviewing the images during CPR
5. Clinical decision making and interventions based on
PoCUS findings and reassessment
6. Completion of scanning
7. Post-resuscitation actions
These protocols are focused to direct the clinician to
perform views that are clinically indicated, which aims to
improve efficiency and reduce the frequency of poten-
tially distracting incidental positive findings that can
accompany the current “one size fits all” standard pro-
tocols. Figure 1 helps to conceptualize the hierarchical
core/supplementary/additional views approach of the
SHoC algorithms. This clarifies the essential views for
hypotension and cardiac arrest, as well as demonstrating
the foundational role that the “4F” approach of
fluid, form, function, and filling plays in the SHoC
protocol.

INTRODUCTION
The use of point of care ultrasound (PoCUS) as an
adjunct to the practice of emergency medicine is now well
established internationally. Initially, evidence to support
the use of PoCUS came from the management of blunt
trauma patients.1 The scope of practice has expanded as
emergency physicians have identified further clinical
problems where PoCUS is able to aid diagnosis and guide
procedures. Assessment of patients in cardiac arrest and
with undifferentiated hypotension are core applications of
PoCUS, with various protocols in widespread use in
emergency medicine.2,3 Previously published protocols
are based upon a logical approach to identifying the likely
etiology and guiding therapy, but these protocols are
frequently based solely on expert opinion and not on the
actual incidence of disease, and tend to follow a didactic
rigid approach.4-5 Evidence supporting the use of PoCUS
in hypotension is limited to diagnostic improvements.4-5
The International Federation for Emergency Medicine
(IFEM) Ultrasound Special Interest Group (USIG) was
tasked with development of a consensus approach to the
use of PoCUS in patients with hypotension and cardiac
arrest, taking into account previously published recom-
mendations as well as the reported incidence of disease
seen with PoCUS in these clinical scenarios.6
PoCUS is an invaluable tool that has potential to
clarify essential diagnoses and yield findings that alter
management plans.4,5 For undifferentiated hypoten-
sion, it enables a clinician to assess the category of shock
and the response to initial management.
Previously published algorithms fail to adopt a hier-
archical approach to their various components,1-3 and
most recommend that every patient receives every view,
every time. The aim of this consensus was to develop an
approach that could be adapted to each clinical scenario.
For cardiac arrest patients, although PoCUS is
commonly taught and performed,7 to our knowledge no
guidelines have yet addressed practical issues such as
operator safety and minimizing delays in cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
The objectives of this group were to provide
consensus-based approaches incorporating
reported
disease incidence for the use of sonography in hypo-
tension and cardiac arrest (SHoC). The SHoC protocol
is presented along with a consensus developed Checklist
for clinicians who wish to safely incorporate PoCUS
into the resuscitation of the arrested patient.
METHODOLOGY
The IFEM USIG invited 24 recognized international
leaders in PoCUS from emergency medicine and critical
care to form an expert panel to develop the SHoC pro-
tocol. Baseline disease incidence was derived using the
reported interim findings of two multicenter prospective
studies that examined ultrasound use in undifferentiated
hypotension and in cardiac arrest (see Tables 1 and 2).6
The panel was also provided with a list of recommended
PoCUS views in previously published protocols and
guidelines (see Table 3). Using a modified Delphi meth-
odology, the expert panel was tasked with integrating the
disease incidence, their clinical experience, and their
knowledge of the medical literature to evaluate what role
each view should play in the proposed SHoC protocol.8

 The panel was asked to assign these views to any of four
different priorities in the hierarchical approach, and pro-
vide a rationale for their decision (see Table 4). The panel
was also asked to structure the protocol in a manner that
would be efficient to perform, and would be consistent
with current standardized methods for teaching critical
care PoCUS (see Table 5).
Reaching consensus
Consensus on the SHoC protocols for hypotension and
cardiac arrest was reached after three rounds of the
modified Delphi process. Typically, consensus was
declared for a given view after that view was assigned to
a certain hierarchy with a two-thirds majority at that
level or higher (see Appendix 1).
In addition to this process, panel members reviewed,
modified, and approved an operator Checklist to guide
clinicians incorporating PoCUS into the assessment and
resuscitation of the arrested patient developed by the
Ultrasound Subcommittee of the Australasian College of
Emergency Medicine (ACEM), using the described
consensus methods. Current recommendations from the
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and
its member organisations were provided to the panel.9,10
The final SHoC protocol and operator Checklist
received panel consensus approval (SHoC-hypotension
received 82%, and SHoC-cardiac arrest received 83%
approval
of
panel
members).
The
IFEM
Board
approved the final recommendations.
RECOMMENDATION
1. SHoC-Hypotension
The expert panel reached consensus and recommends
the following SHoC-hypotension protocol.
Core views focus on determining the category of shock,
whether cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic, and consist of:
1. Basic cardiac views (primarily the subxiphoid window,
or parasternal long axis window for pericardial fluid,
cardiac form and ventricular function);
2. Lung views for pleural fluid and B-lines for filling
status; and
3. IVC views for filling status.
Supplementary views should be performed if further
information is required regarding pericardial fluid or
cardiac form or function, and include the additional
cardiac views (parasternal short axis and apical views).

 In many clinical scenarios determining a source of
hypovolemia or cardiovascular strain is essential. To
assist with this, Additional views including peritoneal
fluid, aorta, pelvic for intrauterine pregnancy (IUP),
and proximal leg veins for deep venous thrombosis
(DVT) should be performed when indicated. Impor-

2. SHoC-Cardiac Arrest
The expert panel reached consensus and recommends the
following SHoC-cardiac arrest protocol. The agreed
protocol focuses on the timing of PoCUS as well as
specific clinical questions.
Core views are limited to cardiac views and must be
performed during the rhythm check pause in chest
compressions, without causing prolonged interruption
in chest compressions. The preferred view is the
subxiphoid window or the parasternal long axis window
if necessary. Either view should be used to look for
pericardial fluid, as well as examining ventricular form
(e.g., right heart strain) and function, (e.g., asystole
versus organized cardiac activity).
Supplementary views include lung views (for absent
lung sliding in pneumothorax and for pleural fluid), and
IVC views for filling.
Additional
applications
that
may
assist
during
cardiac arrest include the use of PoCUS for endo-
tracheal tube confirmation, scanning proximal leg veins
for DVT, or looking for sources of blood loss (AAA,
peritoneal or pelvic fluid).
These consensus protocols do not specify how find-
ings should direct clinical management. They instead

 represent a consensus on the prioritization of scanning
for these critically ill patients, based on the likelihood of
detection of underlying pathology, and the perceived
impact on patient management.
DISCUSSION
PoCUS is an essential tool for the evaluation of many
patients in the ED. A “one size fits all” investigation is
rarely appropriate for any critically ill ED patient, yet this
is how many of the current PoCUS protocols approach
patients with undifferentiated hypotension (all patients
get all included views, all the time) or cardiac arrest.
Examples of commonly recommended, yet rarely positive
views are those for peritoneal fluid and for aortic aneur-
ysm. It is likely that, as these views were commonly taught
as core emergency ultrasound scans, they have been
included in hypotension protocols as a result of famil-
iarity. Our expert panel reached the consensus that,
although
obtaining
peritoneal
views
to
assess
for
peritoneal fluid or views for AAA are essential in certain
patient categories, the diagnostic yield is low and rarely
helpful as a first-line scan. The SHoC protocols’ hier-
archical approaches, based on the pre-test probability of
disease, are advantageous over current “one size fits all”
standards.
In the SHoC-hypotension protocol, all patients first
receive a basic cardiac view, such as the subxiphoid
or parasternal long axis window to look for pericardial
fluid, the form, or size and shape of the cardiac
chambers, and the function of the ventricles; next, lung
views for evidence of pneumothorax, multiple bilateral
B-lines indicating potential pulmonary edema, or pleural
effusions
consistent
with
congestive
heart
failure;
and then and an IVC view looking for respiratory
variation in size. Together these views should help
determine whether the hypotensive patient is likely to be
fluid responsive or not; a key initial factor in resuscita-
tion. These views will also exclude clinically obscure
pathology such as cardiac tamponade. In patients for

 whom a diagnosis is not immediately clear and for whom
definitive management would not be delayed, supple-
mentary cardiac views, such as the parasternal short and
apical windows, should also be obtained. Additional
views are only recommended when clinically indicated to
exclude specific suspected pathology.
In the SHoC-cardiac arrest protocol, the focus is to
obtain a global view of the heart during the hiatus in
chest compressions for a brief rhythm check. The core
sub-xiphoid view, or back-up parasternal long axis view,
will enable detection of pericardial fluid, as well as a
focused assessment for cardiac form and function. The
detection of potentially reversible causes of cardiac
arrest is essential during the early phases of the
management of patients with non-shockable rhythms.
Detection of a massively enlarged right ventricle may
indicate an underlying pulmonary embolism, whereas
vigorous
ventricular
contractility
may
indicate
a
hypovolemic state. Supplementary views include lung
and IVC views. These views will be achievable during
established resuscitation or in the peri-arrest or post-
resuscitation phase. Bilateral lung sliding confirms
adequate
ventilation
and
excludes
tension
pneu-
mothorax.
Multiple
B-lines
or
bilateral
pleural
effusions may point to congestive heart failure. A small
collapsing IVC may confirm a hypovolemic state. A
large dilated IVC is a common finding during cardiac
arrest. Again, additional views are only recommended
when clinically indicated, and must not interrupt
ongoing chest compressions, but may assist with pro-
cedures such as confirmation of tracheal intubation.

 performance of PoCUS when resuscitating a patient in
cardiac arrest.
We believe that a hierarchical approach, based upon
established incidence of disease or the estimated like-
lihood of disease is consistent with the fact that PoCUS
should be used as a diagnostic tool, instead of a
screening tool. When a scan is performed to assess for
an unexpected etiology (a screening scan), a positive
finding is more likely to be incidental and may distract
from the underlying diagnosis. If the same scan is
performed for an expected etiology (a diagnostic scan), a
positive finding is far more likely to be pertinent to the
accurate diagnosis. The SHoC protocol is the first
PoCUS approach with an international consensus that
is focused on diagnostic and resuscitative purposes.
These recommendations are derived from expert con-
sensus in an effort to standardize the approach to
PoCUS in critically ill patients. Research needs to be
performed to validate this approach, and to show it
improves patient outcomes over existing resuscitation
protocols. The recommended protocols are depicted in
Figures 2-5 and in Appendices 1 and 2.
CONCLUSION
We present an international consensus for the use of
sonography in hypotension and cardiac arrest (SHoC)
based on prospectively collected disease incidence. The
proposed SHoC protocols for hypotension and cardiac
arrest, and the cardiac arrest checklist, are stepwise
clinical-indication
based
approaches,
incorporating
Core, Supplementary, and Additional PoCUS views.

ARREST:
CHECKLIST
Preamble
This
is
a
checklist
to
guide
practitioners
in
the
performance of point of care ultrasound (PoCUS) when
resuscitating a patient in cardiac arrest. It has been devel-
oped by the Ultrasound Subcommittee of the Australasian
College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and the
Ultrasound Curriculum Working Group of the Interna-
tional Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). It
incorporates recommendations from International Liaison
Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) member organisa-
tions and the international consensus process on PoCUS
in shock and cardiac arrest led by IFEM.

 Support (ALS/ACLS) algorithm takes priority at all
times. Please also see the Notes section for a detailed
explanation of the checklist.
1. Team briefing
a. Is it likely that PoCUS will alter the outcome of
this case?
▪ Yes: team leader assigns a team member to
perform PoCUS
▪ No: continue standard ALS/ACLS
b. Safety briefing
c. Which side of patient to set up ultrasound
machine?
d. Scanning team member is to scan and save
images during rhythm checks
2. Prepare the machine prior to patient arrival (if time
permits)
a. Patient details: choose “temporary ID”
b. Probe: sector ideal, curved acceptable
c. Preset: cardiac ideal, abdominal or “FAST”
acceptable
d. Initial window (core cardiac): sub-xiphoid ideal,
parasternal long-axis acceptable
e. Depth (and focus if available) set to 25 cm for
adult subcostal, far gain turned up
f. Save video clips or cine-loops rather than still
images
g. Position probe during CPR if possible, to set
up your view before break in CPR
3. Perform the scan during breaks in CPR
a. Core views (cardiac): fluid, form, function
b. Consider Supplementary views: lungs, inferior
vena cava (IVC)
c. Consider
Additional
views
as
clinically
indicated
4. Review the images during CPR
5. Clinical
decisions
and
interventions
based
on
PoCUS findings and then reassess.
6. Cease scanning when team leader decides that
PoCUS is non-contributory or no longer required.
7. Post-resuscitation
a. Amend patient details on the US machine, then
save exam
b. Documentation in clinical record
c. Clean up and debrief
Notes
Team briefing. This can occur prior to ALS/ACLS or
at any stage during ALS/ACLS. Although PoCUS may
improve outcomes in patients with reversible causes for
cardiac arrest (CA), not all clinicians are trained in focused
cardiac US and not all cases of CA require PoCUS (e.g.,
shockable rhythm with return of spontaneous circulation).
Safety briefing is crucial: the team member performing
the scan will have their hands and the transducer in
contact with the patient while the defibrillator is “live”.
Preparing the machine. Ideally this step should have
been considered and planned in advance, with the ideal
pre-set / cine-loop length, / retrospective loop function
programmed by the local ED team. Choose “temporary
ID” or enter patient details after resuscitation is com-
pleted. Choice of probe / transducer is up to the indi-
vidual. Sector probe is ideal in adults, curvilinear probe is
acceptable, and linear probe (ideally using trapezoid/
“virtual convex” setting) is ideal for infants. If focal zone
is available on the machine, set this at 20-25 cm. It is
preferable to save video clips/cine-loops rather than still
images. When preparing to scan, test whether the
machine is saving prospective or retrospective loops by
pressing the “save” button. Also consider whether you
can find and can review saved loops with the team
leader.
Performing the scan and reviewing images. Timing
is crucial. Obtain and record images during breaks in CPR,
but review images during CPR. Show the loops to the team
leader, and try not to distract the rest of the team.
Core views (cardiac):
▪ Fluid in pericardial space suggests pericardial tampo-
nade in the appropriate clinical context. Other signs
are generally sought e.g., right ventricular (RV)
diastolic collapse, but details are beyond the scope
of this document.
▪ Form: a small left ventricle (LV) suggests hypovolemia. A
grossly dilated LV suggests chronic cardiac failure. If the
RV diameter is greater than that of the LV, this suggests
right heart strain (e.g., pulmonary embolus [PE]).

 ▪ Function: although absence of organised LV activity
suggests a poor outcome, it has not been shown to be
100% predictive of futility.11
Supplementary views (lung, IVC). These should be
sought only if time permits and additional information
required.
▪ Lungs: if clinical suspicion of tension pneumothorax
(TPTX) or endotracheal tube (ETT) misplacement
scan
the
anterior
surface
of
each
hemithorax;
consider additional lung views if clinical suspicion
of other pathology. Note that in both TPTX and
unventilated lung, lung sliding is absent on US.
Differentiating requires a combination of clinical
assessment (e.g., how far down is ETT? Is there any
reason for PTX in this patient? Is the patient difficult
to ventilate?) and US features (presence of lung pulse
or any comets, B-lines will rule out PTX on that
side). It is not recommended to seek the ”lung point”
sign as this only present in smaller PTX and will be
absent in both unventilated lung and TPTX. If there
is still doubt, either or both finger thoracostomy or
ETT withdrawal may be considered at the discretion
of the team leader.
▪ Inferior vena cava (IVC): a large IVC with minimal
respiratory variation is usual in cardiac arrest whereas
a small IVC with marked respiratory (ventilatory)
variability suggests fluid-responsive patient.
Additional views. These should be performed when
clinically indicated according to the specific circum-
stances of the case.
▪ Intraperitoneal
fluid
(e.g.,
clinical
suspicion
of
ruptured ectopic pregnancy)
▪ Abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
(AAA)
may
be
an
incidental finding in the arrested patient. Once again,
clinical context is paramount.
▪ Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (if suspicion
of PE and inconclusive cardiac views)
