This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:
To assess the effectiveness and safety of dietary modifications for reducing colic in infants less than four months of age.
B A C K G R O U N D
Description of the condition
Infantile colic can be defined as periods of inconsolable, unex-
plained, and incessant crying in a seemingly healthy infant that,
quite understandably, leads to exhausted, frustrated, and con-
cerned parents seeking to comfort their child (Landgren 2010).
The prevalence of excessive crying varies according to the defini-
tion used although, most often, it peaks during the second month
of life, with a prevalence of 1.5% to 11.9% (Reijneveld 2001). Tra-
ditionally, the definition of the condition was based on the rule of
three (Wessel 1954): that is, unexplained episodes of paroxysmal
crying for more than three hours per day, for three days per week,
for at least three weeks. More recently a new definition has been
proposed. It refers to a clinical condition of fussing and crying for
at least one week in an otherwise healthy infant (Hyman 2006).
Colic can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe, though there is
no consensus for this classification. Colic can affect up to 10% to
30% of infants worldwide (Clifford 2002; Rosen 2007).
Paroxysms of inconsolable crying are often accompanied by flush-
ing of the face, meteorism (excessive flatulence in the intestinal
tract with distention of the abdomen), drawing-up of the legs,
and flatulence (Savino 2010). Symptoms typically start in the sec-
ond week of life, in both breast-fed and formula-fed infants, and
usually resolve by three months of age (Lucas 1998). Generally
speaking, these symptoms are not indicative of disease and thus
hospital admission for these infants is generally unnecessary, detri-
mental, and should not be encouraged (Savino 2007). However,
about 5% of colicky crying infants do have a serious, underlying
medical problem (Freedman 2009; Savino 2005; Savino 2007).
Therefore, all colicky infants should undergo a complete medical
assessment in order to exclude underlying medical conditions that
require investigation and treatment (Savino 2010).
The etiopathogenesis of infantile colic remains undefined and is
most likely multifactorial. Despite the common nature of the con-
dition, there is a general paucity of evidence investigating this area.
It has been suggested that a number of behavioral factors (psycho-
logical and social) and biological components (food hypersensi-
tivity, allergy, or both, gut microflora, and dysmotility) can con-
1

 tribute to its manifestation (Gupta 2007). These include the fol-
lowing.
First, lactose intolerance - due to a relative lactase deficiency - has
been identified as a possible causative factor in infant colic. Carbo-
hydrate malabsorption leads to the colonic fermentation of sugars
and an increase in the levels of hydrogen gas. The rapid produc-
tion of hydrogen in the lower bowel distends the colon, sometimes
causing pain, whereas the osmotic pressures generated by lactose
and lactic acid in the colon cause an influx of water, leading to
further distension of the bowel. Although studies evaluating the
degree of hydrogen in the breath of colicky infants have produced
inconsistent results, increases in breath hydrogen levels have been
reported (Moore 1988; Hyams 1989; Miller 1990).
Second, the immunological model of colic focuses on possible al-
lergens, such as cow’s milk proteins in breast milk or infant for-
mula, as the cause of colic. Intact proteins from the mother’s diet
cross over into the breast milk and provoke an allergic response
and symptoms of colic in some infants. Consequently, a low-aller-
gen maternal diet has been proposed as a form of treatment (Hill
2005; Schach 2002). The possibility that infantile colic could be
related to allergens was first described by Shannon 1921. Since
then, a number of studies have evaluated the possible association
between colic and food hypersensitivity (Lothe 1982; Jakobsson
1983; Campbell 1989; Forsyth 1989; Lothe 1989; Iacono 1991;
Hill1995; Lindberg 1999; Estep2000; Lucassen 2000; Hill2005).
The evidence showsthatabout25%of infantswith moderate orse-
vere symptoms have cow’s milk protein-dependent colic (Axelsson
1986; Lindberg 1999; Hill 2000) that improves after some days of
a hypoallergenic diet (Jakobsson 1983, Jakobsson 2000, Campbell
1989, Lothe 1989, Estep 2000, Savino 2001, Iacono 1991, Iacono
2005, Dupont 2010 ). For these infants, infantile colic could be
the first manifestation of atopic disease and, for this reason dietetic
treatment should be the first therapeutic approach (Gupta 2007,
Savino 2010, Perry 2011, Hall 2012 ). Indeed, dietary changes,
such as eliminating cow’s milk proteins, are particularly indicated
in cases of suspected intolerance to cow milk proteins (for exam-
ple, in infants with a positive family history, eczema or onset after
the first month of life, and colic associated with other GI symp-
toms such as vomiting or diarrhea) (Jakobsson 1983; Hill 1995;
Lucassen 2000; Hill 2005).
Third, there is growing evidence that the intestinal microbiota in
colicky infants differ from those in healthy controls, since higher
levels of anaerobic bacteria, such as coliform and Escherichia coli,
and a lower concentration of lactobacilli have been reported in
infants with colic (Savino 2010). Human milk naturally contains
these prebiotics; they are defined as indigestible oligosaccharides
that could selectivelyenhance the proliferation of certain probiotic
bacteria in the colon, especially Bifidobacterium species (Thomas
2010). However, studies have failed to find a protective effect of
breast feeding on the development of colic in breast-fed infants
(Clifford 2002), while recent evidence suggests that oligosaccha-
ride prebiotics (a mixture of oligosaccharides 0.8 g/100 mL, com-
prising 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10% fructo-oligosac-
charides (Savino 2006)), may be effective treatments for crying in
formula-fed infants with colic.
Description of the intervention
Dietary modifications have often been suggested both for breast-
fed and formula-fed infants. We will examine the following dietary
interventions for infantile colic:
Dietary modifications for breast-fed, colicky infants who are al-
lergic to certain foods (milk, yogurt, cheese) involve modifying
the mother’s diet to exclude these components so the infant re-
ceives a low-allergen maternal diet. A number of studies have
demonstrated a reduction in colic when breast-feeding mothers
consumed a hypoallergenic diet (Jakobsson 1983, Axelsson 1986,
Lothe 1989, Lothe 1990, Clyne 1991). For example, Hill 2005
demonstrated that a monitored low-allergen maternal diet, which
excludes cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and fish,
leads to a reduction in distressed behavior. A brief interruption of
breastfeeding and a temporary substitution with an amino-acid-
based formula has also been proposed (Estep 2000 ); however, this
intervention could have negative effects on maternal-infant inter-
action and should be considered as a last resort for severely and
selected colicky infants (Savino 2001, Savino 2007, Savino 2010).
For formula-fed colicky infants, dietary modifications involve de-
creasing or removing the intake of cow’s milk from the infant’s diet,
or changing the type of milk formula from starting formulas to
special formulas (hypoallergenic formula, soy milk formula, whey
hydrolyzed formula, casein hydrolyzed formula, amino-acid based
formula, partially hydrolyzed formula, low-lactose milk formula,
formula with prebiotic, etc). Some trials have been performed us-
ing formulas containing partially hydrolyzed whey proteins, low
amounts of lactose, prebiotic oligosaccharides, and a high beta
palmitic acid content (Oggero 1994, Savino 2005, Savino 2006,
Osborn 2013). In bottle-fed babies, where an underlying allergy to
cow’s milk protein is hypothesized to affect the infant, extensively
hydrolyzed formulas, based on casein or whey, have been shown
to reduce colic symptoms (Forsyth 1989, Lothe 1989, Jakobsson
2000, Lucassen 2000, Gupta 2007, Cohen-Silver 2009). Other
studies, hypothesizing that malabsorption of lactose may lead to
fussing and crying, have tested infant formulas with low-lactose
content, on the basis that this may reduce excess intestinal gas (
Moore 1988; Hyams 1989Savino 2003; Infante 2011).
It has also been suggested that soy formulas may reduce symp-
toms of colic in some bottle-fed infants. However, the European
Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutri-
tion (ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition reasoned recently that
there is no evidence to support the use of soy formulas in the
management of colic. Additionally, due to concerns regarding a
crossover allergy to cow’s milk protein and their estrogen content,
it is advised that such formulas should not be given to infants with
a food allergy during the first six months of life (Agostoni 2006).

 Given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of studies on
these interventions, the efficacy of these interventions in reducing
infant colic remains inconclusive at present.
How the intervention might work
Dietary interventions have been investigated as a means to reduce
colic in many published studies (Campbell 1989; Clifford 2002;
Clyne 1991); they have proposed a link between infant crying
and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thereby implicating the role of
nutritional factors such as lactose, lipids and cow milk proteins
(Jakobsson 1983; Jakobsson 2000; Lindberg 1999; Feinle-Bisset
2013).
Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as a
rational basis for the therapeutic use of dietary interventions, in-
cluding immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory actions, and
effects on motility and pain perception (Hill 2000 ; Hyman 2006;
Gupta 2007).
There is growing evidence that colicky infants show gut dysfunc-
tions, involving hypersensitivity and abnormal motility, so that
physiological stimuli, that in normal subjects are unperceived, are
able to induce pain symptoms, fussing and increased crying (Heine
2008; Savino 2007). However the exact mechanisms by which
cow’s milk and other food allergens induce GI motility disorders
need further investigation (Heine 2006; Farré 2013).
Why it is important to do this review
A number of studies and reviews of the evidence (Garrison 2000;
Lucassen 2001; Cohen-Silver2009; Savino 2010; Perry2011; Hall
2012) suggest that dietary interventions may be effective in re-
ducing the symptoms of both breast-fed and formula-fed infants
with colic. Potential interventions have included a low-allergen
diet for mothers of breast-fed infants (Hill 2005), and hydrolyzed
formulas (Forsyth 1989; Jakobsson 2000; Lucassen 2000), or low-
lactose content formulas for formula-fed infants (Savino 2003;
Savino 2006; Infante 2011). This systematic review examines the
effectiveness and safety of dietary modifications for infantile colic,
distinguishing between breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Al-
though a recent systematic review on this topic has been published
(Iacovou 2012), the search was performed in 2010, and excluded
all unpublished and grey literature. An up-to-date systematic re-
view using the Cochrane methodology is required.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials.
Types of participants
Infants younger than four months suffering from infantile colic
(whether breast-fed or formula-fed), as defined by the study. Both
breast-fed and formula-fed infants will be eligible.
Types of interventions
The purpose of this review is to compare any one of the following
dietary interventions, alone or in combination, versus another in-
tervention(s) or placebo.
Breast-fed infants
• An educational intervention that supports and directs a
specific dietary modification: to modify the mother’s diet by
excluding certain components such as milk, yogurt, cheese, and
other foods
• Low-allergen breast-feeding diet
• A diet plan or dietary supplementation, regardless of
duration of intervention
Formula-fed infants
• Soy-based formula
• Extensively hydrolyzed formula based on whey or casein
• Partially hydrolyzed formula
• Formula with low or no content of lactose
• Amino-acid based formula
• Formula that includes prebiotics
We will exclude studies involving probiotics. For further infor-
mation on these interventions, we direct authors to the follow-
ing Cochrane Review: ’Oral probiotics for infantile colic’ (Praveen
2014).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. A reduction in the duration of crying (post-treatment
versus baseline)*. Data may be continuous (for example, hours
per day), or dichotomous (for example, reduction under a
predefined threshold, as determined by the trial authors)
3

 Secondary outcomes
1. The number of responders in each group after treatment*.
Responders will be defined as those who experienced a decrease
in the daily, average crying time of 50% from baseline*
(dichotomous outcome)
2. Reduction in frequency of crying episodes per 24 hours
(post-treatment versus baseline)* (dichotomous outcome)
3. Parental or family quality of life, including measures of
parental stress, anxiety or depression* (continuous outcome)
4. Infant sleep duration per 24 hours at 7, 14, and 21 days*
(post-treatment versus baseline) (continuous outcome)
5. Parental satisfaction measured by Likert scales or a numeric
rating scale (continuous outcome)
6. Adverse effects to dietary modifications: constipation*,
vomiting*, diarrhea, apnea, apparent life-threatening events, and
lethargy (dichotomous outcome)
We will analyze the frequency of all adverse events in each study
group. We will conduct further analyses according to each specific
adverse event if sufficient data are provided by the primary studies.
Timing of outcome assessment: we will include outcomes evalu-
ated after the completion of any treatment protocol (that is any
period, any number of treatments), and also at later follow up, if
reported. Outcomes indicated by an asterisk (*) will be used to
populate the ’Summary of findings’ table for the main comparison,
where data permit. Where data are insufficient, we will provide a
narrative account of the outcomes.

There is some evidence that data from abstracts can be inconsistent
with data in published articles (Pitkin 1999). Therefore, abstract
publications will not be included in this review.
Electronic searches
We will adapt the following Ovid MEDLINE search strategy for
each database. The study methods filter is the Cochrane highly
sensitive search strategy for identifying randomized or quasi-ran-
domized trials (sensitivity maximizing version), as recommended
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Lefebvre 2008).

Searching other resources
We will search the bibliographies of included studies to identify
any other potentially relevant articles.
Grey literature
We will search Google and Google Scholar using the main
search terms. We will handsearch conference proceedings from the
ESPGHAN annual scientific meeting from the past two years to
identify other potentially relevant studies that may not be pub-
lished in full. Where references to relevant unpublished or ongoing
studies are identified, we will record them, and make attempts to
obtain sufficient information to incorporate them in this review.
Studies from the grey literature will only be included if sufficient
data are presented. If data are not complete, we will contact the
authors in order to verify the eligibility of the study.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two reviewers (FS; MS) will independently screen titles, abstracts,
and full reports for eligibility against the inclusion criteria (see
above).
Specifically, we will:
1. merge search results using reference management software and
remove duplicate records of the same report;
2. examine titles and abstracts to remove irrelevant reports;
3. retrieve full texts of potentially relevant reports;
4. link together multiple reports of the same study;
5. examine full text reports for studies which meet the eligibility
criteria;
6.correspondwith investigators,whenappropriate,toclarifystudy
eligibility;
7. at all stages, note reasons for inclusion and exclusion of articles,
resolving any disagreements through consensus;
8. make final decisions on study inclusions and resolve any dis-
crepancies through a process of consensus;
9. proceed to data collection.
Data extraction and management
We will develop data extraction forms a priori, as per the recom-
mendations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2008a). We will extract the following in-
formation.
1. Characteristics of participants: source of participants,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, total number at baseline, total
number at completion, setting, definition of ’colic’ applied,
diagnostic criteria applied, type of feeding (breast feeding, bottle
feeding), age at onset of colic, age at commencement of
intervention, and evaluation of potential effect modifiers (for
example, age, gender).
2. Interventions and controls: number of groups,
intervention(s) applied, frequency and duration of treatment,
total number of treatments, permitted cointerventions.
3. Methods: study design, duration, sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors,
evaluation of success of blinding.
4. Outcomes: list of outcomes assessed, definitions used,
values of means and standard deviations at baseline and at time
points, as defined by the study protocol (or change from baseline
measures, if given).
5. Results: measures at end of protocol, follow-up data
(including means and standard deviations, standard errors, or
confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and summary
tables for dichotomous data), withdrawals, and losses to follow
up.
6. Other: references to other relevant studies, points to follow
up with authors, comments from the authors, key conclusions
from the study (by the authors), other comments from review
authors.
Two review authors (FS; MS) will extract the data independently
using the data extraction form. A third review author (VT) will
resolve any disagreements. We will collate data in the latest version
of Review Manager (RevMan) (Review Manager 2011).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (FS; MS) will independently evaluate each
study for risk of bias using the criteria recommended in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2008b, Deeks 2011) for the following domains: sequence gener-
ation; allocation concealment; blinding of parents, health profes-
sionals, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selec-
tive outcome reporting; and other potential threats to validity. We
will judge each domain as being at ’low’, ’high’, or ’unclear’ risk
of bias. We will compare the judgments, and discuss and resolve
any inconsistencies in the assessments. A third review (VT) author
will resolve any persisting disagreements.
Sequence generation for randomisation
We will include only randomized controlled trials or quasi-ran-
domized controlled trials in the study. We will assess randomiza-
tion as being at low risk of bias if the procedure of sequence gen-
eration was explicitly described. Examples include computer-gen-
erated random numbers, a random numbers table or coin-tossing.
If no description is given, we will contact the authors for further
information, and if we fail to receive a response, we will assign a
judgment of unclear risk of bias. We will consider studies that use
non-randomized procedures to have a high risk of bias.
Allocation concealment
We will assess concealment of treatment allocation as being at low
risk of bias if the procedure was explicitly described and adequate
efforts were made to ensure that intervention allocations could not
have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrollment. Examples
include centralized randomization, numbered or coded contain-
ers, or sealed envelopes. Procedures considered to have a high risk
of bias include alternation, or reference to case record numbers or
dates of birth. If no description is given, we will contact the study
authors and, if no response is received, we will assign a judgment
of unclear risk of bias. If allocation concealment did not occur, we
will assign a judgment of high risk of bias.
Blinding of parents, health professionals, and outcome
assessors
In this context, the intervention is administered by parents and so,
in effect, they will be considered the target of the blinding proce-
dures. Indeed, as the participants will be less than four months of
age, by the defined inclusion criteria, it is deemed that this item
is not applicable to them. Furthermore, parents often act as out-
come assessors. We will primarily assess the risk of bias associated
with the blinding of participants based on the likelihood that such
blinding was sufficient to ensure that parents had no knowledge
as to which intervention the infant received.
We will describe, for each included study, the methods used, if
any, to blind the outcome assessors from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We will judge studies to be at
low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we consider that the lack
of blinding could not have affected the results. If blinding was not
possible because of the nature of intervention, we will judge the
study to be at high risk of bias because it is possible that the lack
of blinding influenced the results. We will note the blinding of
health professionals if reported.
If no description is given, we will contact the study authors for
more information, and if we do not receive a response, we will
assign a judgment of unclear risk of bias. If not blinded, we will
assign a judgment of high risk of bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Incomplete outcome data essentially include attrition, exclusions,
and missing data.
We will assign a judgment of low risk of bias:
• if participants included in the analysis are exactly those who
were randomized into the trial, if missing outcome data are
balanced in terms of numbers across intervention groups, with
similar reasons for missing data across groups, or if there are no
missing outcome data;
• if, for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of
missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is not
sufficient to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention
effect estimate;
• if, for continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size
(standardized mean differences (SMD)) among missing
outcomes is not sufficient to have a clinically relevant impact on
observed effect size;
• if missing data have been imputed using appropriate
methods.
We will assign a judgment of high risk of bias for any one of the
following reasons:
• when reasons for missing outcome data are likely to be
related to the true outcome, with either an imbalance in
numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups;
• for dichotomous outcome data, when the proportion of
missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is sufficient
to induce clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect
estimate;
• for continuous outcome data, when the plausible effect size
(standardized mean differences (SMD)) among missing
outcomes is sufficient to induce clinically relevant bias in the
observed effect size;
• when an ’as-treated’ analysis is carried out in cases where
there is substantial departure of the intervention received from
that assigned at randomisation;
• when there is a potentially inappropriate application of
simple imputation.
We will assign a judgment of unclear risk of bias:
6

 • when there is insufficient reporting of attrition and/or
exclusions to permit a judgment of a low or high risk of bias;
• if the study reported incomplete outcome data;
• if the numbers randomized to intervention and control
groups are not clearly reported.
Selective outcome reporting
We will assess the reporting of outcomes as being at low risk of
bias if all the study outcomes declared in the methods section
have been reported in the results. We will also evaluate whether
different reports of the study are available, including protocols,
and examine them to ensure there is no suggestion of selective
outcome reporting. If no description is given, we will contact the
authors for more information, and if no response is received, we
will assign a judgment of unclear risk of bias. If there is evidence
of selective reporting, we will assign a judgment of high risk of
bias.
Other potential threats to validity
If the study is at risk of other sources of bias, we will assess it
as being at high risk of bias. For instance, if it was stopped early
due to a data-dependent process or having a baseline imbalance
betweenthe groups. Examplesof factorsthatmaypose arisk of bias
could include sources of sponsorship or funding. We will assess the
study as being at low risk of bias if it appears to be free from such
threats to validity. Where the risk of bias is unclear from published
information, we will attempt to contact authors for clarification.
If this is not forthcoming, we will assess these studies as being at
unclear risk of bias.
Assessment of overall risk of bias
We will assess the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE
approach (Guyatt 2008). The GRADE approach appraises the
quality of a body of evidence based on the extent to which one can
be confident that an estimate of effect, or association, reflects the
item being assessed. Randomized trials start as high-quality evi-
dence, but may be downgraded due to: risk of bias (methodolog-
ical quality), indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity,
imprecision (sparse data), and publication bias. We will determine
the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome after consid-
ering each of these factors, and will grade them as follows:
• high: further research is very unlikely to change confidence
in the estimate of effect;
• moderate: further research is likely to have an important
impact on confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change
the estimate;
• low: further research is very likely to have an important
impact on confidence in the estimate of effect, and is likely to
change the estimate;
• very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
We will present dichotomous outcomes data as risk ratios (RR)
since the effects of the RR are readily understood (Walter 2000).
We will report all outcome data with their associated 95% confi-
dence interval and probability values (where possible). Using con-
trol event risks from the included trials, we will calculate the num-
ber needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and its associated 95%
confidence interval for statistically significant dichotomous out-
comes.
Continuous data
If all studies use the same measurement scale, we will calculate
mean differences (MD) for change scores. Where studies use dif-
ferent scales, we will calculate the standardized mean differences
(SMD) using Hedges g. If necessary, we will calculate effect esti-
mates from P values, t statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA)
tables, or other statistics as recommended in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Review of Interventions (Deeks 2011).
For this analysis we will use, according to need, either change
scores or final values without combining them.
If both continuous and dichotomous data are available for an out-
come, we will include only the continuous outcome in the primary
analysis. If some studies report an outcome as a dichotomous mea-
sure, and others use a continuous measure of the same construct,
we will convert the results for the former from the dichotomous
measure to a SMD, provided that we can assume the underlying
continuous measure has approximately a normal or logistic distri-
bution (otherwise we will carry out two separate analyses).
Unit of analysis issues
For each included study, we will determine whether the unit of
analysis is appropriate for the unit of randomization and the design
of that study (that is, whether the number of observations matches
the number of ’units’ that were randomized (Deeks 2008)). It is
unlikely that we will find cluster-randomized trials because this
design is uncommon in this field. However, if we do, we will use
the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to convert trials to their
effective sample size before incorporating them into the meta-
analysis, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Review of Interventions (Higgins 2008c). Where the ICC is not
provided we will use values available in the published literature
(Campbell 2000).
Studies with multiple treatment arms
In the primary analysis, we will combine results across all eligi-
ble intervention (dietary change, i.e. special formula) arms, and
7
Dietary modifications for infantile colic (Protocol)
Copyright © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 compare them with the combined results across all eligible control
arms (another intervention(s) or placebo), making single, pair-
wise comparisons. Where such a strategy prevents investigation of
potential sources of heterogeneity, we will analyze each formula
separately (against a common control group - placebo), but di-
vide the sample size for common comparator arms proportionately
across each comparison (Higgins 2008c). This simple approach
allows the use of standard software (including RevMan) (Review
Manager 2011), and prevents the inappropriate double-counting
of individuals.
Cross-over studies
In randomized cross-over studies, individuals receive each inter-
vention sequentially, in a random order. Cross-over studies usually
contain a washout period, which is a stage after the first treatment
but before the second treatment, where time is given for the active
effects of the first treatment to wear off before the new treatment
begins (that is, to reduce the carry-over effect). A concern with
the cross-over design is the risk of a carry-over effect when the
first treatment affects the second. Inadequate washouts are seen
when the carry-over effects persist after the washout period. For
this review, we considered an adequate washout period for cross-
over studies to be a minimum of one day because the food transit
time of milk cannot last more than 24 hours.
When including both parallel and cross-over studies with an ade-
quate washout period, we will use the inverse variance method, as
recommended by Elbourne 2002. In the meta-analysis, the weight
of each study is inversely proportional to the variance (one over
the square of the standard error) (Deeks 2008). When including
cross-over studies with an inadequate washout period, we will use
only the data from the first arm. Even though this method excludes
some of the data, it avoids the inappropriate consideration of cor-
related information. If cross-over trials are reported, we will use
the mean and standard error of the paired analysis for the meta-
analysis.
Dealing with missing data
Where data are missing, we will contact the corresponding authors
of included studies to supply any unreported data. For all out-
comes, in all studies, we will carry out analyses as far as possible on
an intention-to-treat basis; that is, we will attempt to include all
participants randomized to each group in the analyses, and we will
analyze all participants in the group to which they were allocated,
regardless of whether or not they received the allocated interven-
tion. For continuous data that are missing, we will estimate stan-
dard deviations from other available data, such as standard errors,
or we will impute them using the methods suggested in Higgins
2008c. We will make no assumptions about loss to follow up for
continuous data, and we will base analyses on those participants
completing the trial. If there is a discrepancy between the number
randomized and the number analyzed in each treatment group,
we will calculate and report the percentage lost to follow up in
each group. Where it is not possible to obtain missing data, we will
record this in the data collection form, report it in the ’Risk of bias’
table, and discuss the extent to which the missing data could alter
the results and, hence, the conclusions of the review. For included
studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact
of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall
assessment of treatment effect by conducting sensitivity analyses.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We will assess clinical heterogeneity by comparing the distribu-
tion of important participant characteristics between trials (for ex-
ample, age) and trial characteristics (randomization, concealment,
blinding of outcome assessment, losses to follow up, treatment
type, cointerventions). We will assess statistical heterogeneity by
examining the I2 statistic (Deeks 2008), a quantity that describes
the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to vari-
ability across studies rather than sampling error.
We will interpret the I2 statistic as suggested in the latest version
of Deeks 2011:
• 0% to 40%: might not be important;
• 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;
• 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;
• 75% to 100%: suggests considerable heterogeneity.
We will also evaluate the confidence interval for the I2 statistic.
In addition, we will employ a Chi2 test of homogeneity, with a
10% level of significance, to determine the strength of evidence
that heterogeneity is genuine.
Assessment of reporting biases
In order to minimize publication bias, we will attempt to obtain
the results of any unpublished studies in order to compare the
results extracted from published journal reports with the results
obtained from other sources (including correspondence).
In addition, if there are more than 10 studies grouped in a com-
parison, we will evaluate whether reporting biases are present by
using funnel plots to investigate any relationship between effect
estimates and study size and/or precision, as recommended in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sterne
2008).
Data synthesis
Where interventions are similar in i) type of dietary modification,
ii) type of outcome assessed, and iii) type of colic, we plan to group
the studies and synthesize their results in a meta-analysis. We will
present results for each combination of dietary regimen, assessed
outcome, and colic type, with the exception of those studies for
which no data are observed. For instance, if two or more studies
8

 assessed the effects of hypoallergenic formula in otherwise healthy
children with colic and both measured the daily crying, we will
perform a meta-analysis of the results. Because we assume that
clinical heterogeneity is very likely to impact on our review results,
given the wide breadth and types of interventions included, we will
combine the studies using a random-effects model, regardless of
statistical evidence of heterogeneity effect sizes. We will calculate
all overall effects using inverse variance methods.
We will carry out statistical analysis using RevMan (Review
Manager 2011).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Large numbers of subgroup analyses may lead to misleading con-
clusions (Yusuf 1991; Oxman 1992). These analyses will be ex-
ploratory as they involve non-experimental (cross-study) compar-
isons and will involve primary outcomes. We will treat any conclu-
sions with caution. We plan to carry out the following subgroup
analyses:
• age of mother at time of birth (younger versus older; that is,
21 years and younger versus older than 21 years);
• type of feeding (bottle fed versus breast fed);
• atopy (lower versus higher risk of atopy);
• short-term and long-term follow up (fewer versus more
than four weeks of treatment);
• low-quality trials versus high-quality trials (allocation
concealment versus lack of allocation concealment; blinding
versus lack of blinding).
Sensitivity analysis
We will conduct sensitivity analyses to determine whether findings
are sensitive to restricting the analyses to studies judged to be at
low risk of bias for blinded assessment of the primary outcome. In
addition, we will assess the sensitivity of findings to any imputed
data, by calculating the treatment effect including and excluding
the imputed data to see whether this alters the outcome of the
analysis. We will investigate the effect of drop-outs and exclusions
by conducting worst- versus best-case scenario analyses. We will
also analyze the effect of using the stringent Wessel definition of
infant colic (Wessel 1954), the more recent definition given by
Hyman 2006, or a non-recognized definition.
