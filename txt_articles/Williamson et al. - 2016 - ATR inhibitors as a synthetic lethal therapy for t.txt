Identifying genetic biomarkers of synthetic lethal drug sensitivity effects provides one
approach to the development of targeted cancer therapies. Mutations in ARID1A represent
one of the most common molecular alterations in human cancer, but therapeutic approaches
that target these defects are not yet clinically available. We demonstrate that defects in
ARID1A sensitize tumour cells to clinical inhibitors of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase,
ATR, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ARID1A deficiency results in topoisomerase 2A
and cell cycle defects, which cause an increased reliance on ATR checkpoint activity.
In ARID1A mutant tumour cells, inhibition of ATR triggers premature mitotic entry, genomic
instability and apoptosis. The data presented here provide the pre-clinical and mechanistic
rationale for assessing ARID1A defects as a biomarker of single-agent ATR inhibitor response
and represents a novel synthetic lethal approach to targeting tumour cells.

 A
TR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and Rad3-
related protein kinase), is a critical component of the
cellular DNA damage response (DDR)1. ATR is activated
by regions of single-stranded DNA, some of which occur as a
result of replication stress2–4. Oncogene activation can induce
replication stress and a reliance upon an ATR checkpoint
function; this provides one rationale for the use of small
molecule ATR inhibitors (ATRi) as cancer therapeutics5. Potent
and specific ATRi have been discovered including EPT-46464
(ref. 6), AZ20 (AstraZeneca)7, VE-821 and VX-970 (VE-822)
(Vertex), some of which are currently in Phase I clinical trials5. In
pre-clinical studies, VE-821 enhances the cytotoxic effects of a
number of DNA damaging agents in tumour cells that have
defects in the ATM/p53 pathway8–11, suggesting that ATRi might
have clinical utility as chemo-sensitizing agents. However, in
what context ATRi might be used as single agents is less clear.
Previous studies have demonstrated that alterations in cano-
nical DDR/cell cycle checkpoint genes (ERCC1 (ref. 12), XRCC1
(ref. 13), CDC25A14 and ATM15,16) have the potential to act as
predictive biomarkers of single-agent ATRi sensitivity. However,
it is not yet clear whether processes beyond canonical DDR, and
in particular loss of tumour suppressor genes, might also predict
for ATRi sensitivity. Therefore, as ATRi enter Phase 1 clinical
trials, it is clear that there is a pressing need to identify clinically
useful biomarkers of sensitivity5.
The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex is composed of
multiple components, including proteins such as ARID1A,
ARID1B, SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 that have tumour suppres-
sor roles17. These complexes utilize ATP to modify chromatin
architecture by sliding or ejecting nucleosomes from DNA18. This
activity appears to modulate a number of DNA processes
including replication, transcription and DNA repair19,20. Two
primary versions of SWI/SNF have been isolated from cells, BAF
(SWI/SNF-A) and PBAF (SWI/SNF-B)21, distinguished in part by
the DNA-binding component of the complex. BAF complexes
interact with DNA via either ARID1A or ARID1B components,
while the PBAF complex binds DNA through ARID2 (ref. 22).
When taken as a group, SWI/SNF components are estimated to
be mutated in nearly 20% of all human tumours, making loss of
this complex one of the most common alterations in cancer17.
In this study, we aimed to discover clinically actionable
determinants of single-agent ATRi sensitivity. Using large-scale
genetic screens we identified the BAF component ARID1A as a
synthetic lethal partner of ATR inhibition. We validated the
synthetic lethal interaction between ATR and ARID1A using both
in vitro and in vivo models. Mechanistically, we found that ATR
inhibition exploits a pre-existing DNA decatenation defect in
ARID1A mutant tumour cells and causes premature mitotic
progression. This leads to large-scale genomic instability and cell
death. On the basis of this data, we propose that ARID1A should
be assessed as a biomarker of ATRi sensitivity in clinical trials.
Results
RNAi screens identify ARID1A as ATRi synthetic lethal partner.
To uncover clinically actionable genetic determinants of single-
agent ATRi response, we performed a series of high-throughput
RNAi chemosensitization screens where cells were transfected
with a library of SMARTPool short interfering (si)RNAs and then
exposed to the highly potent and selective ATR catalytic inhibitor
VE-821 (Fig. 1a; Ki ¼ 13 nM (ref. 23)). For screening we selected
the p53 mutant, triple negative (ERa negative, PR negative and
ERBB2 negative) breast tumour cell line HCC1143, based on
previous work suggesting that ATRi might have utility in TP53
mutant cancers6,9,24,25. To model the effect of ATRi on normal
cells, we also screened the non-tumour, mammary epithelial cell
model, MCF12A. We confirmed that both cell lines retained
a functional ATR activation pathway by assessing cisplatin-
induced ATR p.T1989 autophosphorylation26,27 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1A,B). To identify clinically actionable effects, the
RNAi library we used encompassed 1,280 siRNA SMARTPools
(four siRNAs per gene in each pool) targeting either recurre-
ntly mutated genes in cancer28, kinases, due to their inherent
tractability as drug targets, and DDR genes29, given the potential
for ATRi to enhance defects in these processes6,9 (Supplementary
Data 1). HCC1143 and MCF12A cells were transfected in a 384-
well plate format using the siRNA library. Cells were then
exposed to a sub-lethal concentration of VE-821 (1 mM, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1C) or vehicle (DMSO) for a subsequent 4 days, at
which point cell viability was estimated using CellTitre-Glo
Reagent (Promega; Fig. 1a).
We used data from replica (n ¼ 3) screens to calculate drug
effect (DE) Z-scores (see Methods) describing the effect of each
siRNA SMARTPool on VE-821 sensitization (Fig. 1b)30. This
approach identified 150 significant (DE Zo � 2) VE-821 sensi-
tivity-causing effects in HCC1143 cells and 179 in MCF12A cells
(Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with previous
observations9,12,15,16, we observed significant VE-821 sensiti-
zation associated with siRNA SMARTPools designed to target
either ATR, the ATR activation factors RAD17, RAD1 and
RAD9A, ERCC4 or ATM (Supplementary Fig. 1D,E), giving us
confidence in the results from the screens.
To identify ATRi synthetic lethal effects operating in diverse
genetic backgrounds, we compared the HCC1143 and MCF12A
data and identified 30 siRNA SMARTPools that caused VE-821
sensitivity in both cell lines (Supplementary Data 2). This analysis
identified several novel ATR synthetic lethal partner genes
involved in DNA damage/repair including those targeting comp-
onents of the HR/Fanconi Anaemia pathway (FANCE, SLX4,
PALB2), DNA mismatch repair (MSH4, PMS2) and trans-lesion
synthesis (RAD18) pathways (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 2).
Amongst the common hits we also identified seven siRNA
targeting tumour suppressor genes (ATM, FANCE, GCP3, IDH1,
PALB2, PMS2 and ARID1A; Fig. 1c,d). The observation that
silencing ARID1A sensitized cells to ATRi was particularly
interesting as ARID1A is recurrently mutated in a variety of
tumour types (45% ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), 14–19%
gastric, bladder and hepatocellular tumours and 2–3% breast
tumours17).
We validated the ARID1A/ATRi synthetic lethal interaction
using a number of orthogonal approaches. In HCC1143 cells, an
siRNA SMARTPool targeting ARID1A-reduced ARID1A protein
levels
and
significantly
enhanced
sensitivity
to
VE-821
(Po0.0001, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Fig. 1e,f) as did the
four individual ARID1A siRNAs (Po0.001, Student’s t-test,
Fig. 1g,h), suggesting that this was unlikely to be an off-target
siRNA effect. Both pooled and individual ARID1A siRNAs also
caused sensitivity to an ATRi currently being assessed in Phase 1
clinical trials trials, VX-970 (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the synthetic
lethality was not specific to VE-821 (Supplementary Fig. 2A,B).
To assess whether constitutive loss of ARID1A function, as would
occur in tumours, also resulted in ATRi sensitivity, we used
human colorectal HCT116 isogenic cells containing either wild-
type ARID1A (ARID1A þ / þ) or homozygous loss-of-function
ARID1A
mutations

short-term (5-day exposure) viability assays using all three
inhibitors (Po0.001, ANOVA, Fig. 2g–i). In contrast to our

 level of ARID1A protein compared with homozygous wild-type
and homozygous mutant cells and exhibited an intermediate level
of ATRi sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 2E,F). This suggested that
an ARID1A gene dosage effect might possibly influence ATRi
sensitivity.
The ATRi sensitivity in HCT116 ARID1A � / � cells not only
validated the synthetic lethal interaction between ARID1A and
ATR inhibition but also established that the effect was likely not
restricted to cells from a breast lineage such as HCC1143 or
MCF12A used in the high-throughput screens. To further
investigate the generality of this effect we determined ATRi
sensitivity in a genetically and histologically diverse panel of
tumour cell lines. In this analysis, we found that the presence of
loss-of-function ARID1A mutations in tumour cell lines was
associated with sensitivity to VX-970 (P ¼ 0.0059, Student’s t-test,
Fig. 2j and Supplementary Data 3), although we were statistically
underpowered to confirm whether or not the synthetic lethality
was any more or less profound in particular tumour types in this
analysis. To address whether the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethal
interaction was limited to human cell line models, we also studied
isogenic Arid1a þ / þ and Arid1a � / � mouse embryonic stem
(ES) cells31. In clonogenic assays both VX-970 and VE-821
selectively targeted Arid1a � / � ES cells (Po0.0001, ANOVA,
Fig. 2k,l and Supplementary Fig. 2E). We next compared how the
observed ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality compared with other
ATRi related synthetic lethalities and other reported ARID1A-
selective agents. The magnitude of ATRi sensitivity associated
with ARID1A mutant cells was comparable, if not greater than
that seen with other candidate biomarkers of ATRi sensitivity
such as ATM (Supplementary Fig. 2F). Furthermore, we found
that the ARID1A � / � selectivity of VX-970 was also more
profound than other proposed ARID1A-targeted agents such as
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) or cisplatin32,33 (Supplementary Fig. 3).
We originally identified the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethal
effect in p53 mutant HCC1143 and p53 wild-type MCF12A cells
and confirmed this synthetic lethality in p53 wild-type HCT116
and mouse ES cells (Figs 1 and 2). This suggested that the
synthetic lethal effect was somewhat independent of p53 status.
Silencing
of
ARID1A
using
siRNA
significantly
sensitized
HCT116 TP53 � / � cells to VX-970 (Po0.001, ANOVA, Supple-
mentary Fig. 4A), suggesting that the absence of p53 function did
not negate the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality. In addition,
silencing of TP53 using siRNA in p53 wild-type HCT116
ARID1A � / � cells also did not alter the sensitivity to VX-970
(Supplementary Fig. 4B). Collectively this data suggested that p53
might not be a key modulator of the ATR/ARID1A synthetic
lethality.
To address the possibility that the ARID1A/ATRi synthetic
lethality might be specific to catalytic inhibition of ATR, we
exploited data describing the sensitivity of 86 human tumour cell
lines
to
SMARTPool
siRNAs
targeting
720
kinase-coding
genes34,35. We found that the presence of loss-of-function
ARID1A mutations in tumour cell lines was associated with
greater sensitivity to ATR siRNA (P ¼ 0.008, Median Permutation
test, Supplementary Fig. 4C). To confirm this, we silenced ATR
using siRNA in HCT116 ARID1A � / � and ARID1A þ / þ cells,
and found that ATR siRNA selectively targeted ARID1A � / � cells
(Po0.05, Student’s t-test, Supplementary Fig. 4D,E). Collectively,
this data suggested that inhibition of ATR function, either by
small molecule inhibition or by gene silencing was synthetically
lethal with ARID1A deficiency.
In vivo ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality. We next assessed
whether the clinical ATRi, VX-970, could inhibit ARID1A-
deficient tumours in vivo. To do this, we generated cohorts
of mice with established xenograft tumours derived from either
HCT116 ARID1A þ / þ or ARID1A � / � cells. Once tumours had
established, mice were treated with either VX-970 or drug vehicle
for 40 days (Fig. 3a). We found that, compared with vehicle
treatment, VX-970 had no effect on ARID1A þ / þ tumours
(P ¼ 0.45, ANOVA, Fig. 3b) but significantly inhibited the growth
of ARID1A � / � tumours (P ¼ 0.024, ANOVA, Fig. 3b). VX-970
treatment also had a greater impact on ARID1A � / � tumours
compared with ARID1A þ / þ
tumours (P ¼ 0.006, ANOVA,
Fig. 3b). In a subsequent experiment, we assessed whether
VX-970 could impair the establishment of tumours by treating
mice with VX-970 immediately after xenografting HCT116 cells,
as opposed to waiting for tumours to establish before initia-
ting treatment (Fig. 3c). We found that VX-970 prevented the
establishment of HCT116 ARID1A � / � xenografts (frequency of
ARID1A � / � tumour formation ¼ 27% for VX-970-treated mice
versus 73% in vehicle-treated mice, P ¼ 0.027, Fisher’s exact test),
but had no impact on the establishment of ARID1A þ / þ xeno-
grafts (frequency of ARID1A � / � tumour formation ¼ 80% for
VX-970-treated mice versus 87% in vehicle-treated mice, P ¼ 1 ns
by Fisher’s exact test, Fig. 3c,d). In this experiment, early initia-
tion of VX-970 treatment also dramatically slowed the growth
of ARID1A � / � tumours (P ¼ 0.015, ANOVA), but did not
impair ARID1A þ / þ xenografts (P ¼ 0.63, ANOVA, Fig. 3e,f).
We also determined the in vivo efficacy of VX-970 in mice with
established tumours derived from a tumour cell line with
naturally occurring ARID1A mutations (TOV21G, ARID1A
p.548fs/p.756fs). In in vitro studies, we found that the TOV21G
human OCCC cell line was more sensitive to both VE-821 and
VX-970 than the ARID1A wild-type OCCC cell line RMG1
(Fig. 3g, Po0.0001, ANOVA and Supplementary Fig. 4F) and
also exhibited a DNA damage (gH2AX; Supplementary Fig. 4G)
and apoptotic response to ATRi exposure (Fig. 3h,i). In vivo,
VX-970 treatment significantly inhibited the growth of estab-
lished TOV21G tumours compared with vehicle administration
(P ¼ 0.014, ANOVA, Fig. 3j–l). Although the scale of anti-tumour
effect in TOV21G xenografts was not as profound as in HCT116
ARID1A � / � xenografts, the effect of ATRi in this setting did
suggest that the ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality could be
exploited in vivo and warrants further investigation.

ARID1A þ / þ and ARID1A � / � cells could explain the selective
toxicity of ATR inhibition, we found that under logarithmic
growth conditions, and in the absence of ATRi, the proportion of
G2/M cells was higher in ARID1A � / � cells compared with
ARID1A þ / þ cells (P ¼ 0.033, Student’s test, Fig. 4a). To inves-
tigate this further, we synchronized cells at the G1/early S phase
boundary using a double thymidine block and then followed cell
cycle progression once the thymidine block was removed
(Fig. 4b). We found that, compared with ARID1A þ / þ cells,
ARID1A � / � cells had a delayed progression through S phase
and a slower progression from G2 into mitosis (8–10 h after
block—Fig. 4b). In asynchronous cell cultures, we found that
ARID1A � / �
cells exhibited lower levels of phosphorylated
Histone H3 (Ser-10), a marker of mitotic entry, compared with
ARID1A þ / þ cells (P ¼ 0.035, Student’s t-test, Fig. 4c). Silencing
of ARID1A by siRNA SMARTpool in ARID1A þ / þ cells also
caused a significant decrease in Histone H3 phosphorylation
(P ¼ 0.00015, Student’s t-test, Fig. 4c). We did however note that
the extent of phospho-H3 reduction caused by ARID1A inhibi-
tion was more extensive in ARID1A siRNA SMARTpool trans-
fected cells than in ARID1A � / � cells (Fig. 4c). It is possible that
this could be due to a modest difference in the pheno-

opposed to long-term ARID1A deficiency as is the case in the

smic cyclin B1 in ARID1A � / � cells (Supplementary Fig. 4H) a
phenotype associated with initiation of a G2/M cell cycle check-

 decatenation), and reduced localization of the topoisomerase
enzyme, TOP2A, to DNA37. TOP2A modulates the topological
structure of DNA and is critical to processes such as chromosome
condensation, chromatid separation, DNA transcription and
replication (reviewed in refs 38,39). We found that HCT116
ARID1A � / � cells exhibited lower levels of chromatin-bound
TOP2A, compared with isogenic ARID1A þ / þ cells (Fig. 4d). In
addition RNAi-mediated silencing of ARID1A in ARID1A þ / þ
cells also reduced chromatin-bound TOP2A (Fig. 4d). We also
found that the TOP2A defect in ARID1A defective HCT116 cells
was associated with an increased frequency of anaphase bridges
(P ¼ 0.038, Student’s t-test, Fig. 4e), a biomarker of defective
DNA decatenation, a process controlled by TOP2A37,40. The
TOP2A defect was also apparent amongst a panel of OCCC cell
lines, where those with ARID1A mutations exhibited a reduction
in chromatin-bound TOP2A, despite expressing similar amounts
of total TOP2A (Fig. 4f). We also found that siRNA silencing of
TOP2A using SMARTPool siRNAs in ARID1A þ / þ HCT116
cells caused sensitivity to both VE-821 and VX-970 (Po0.001,
ANOVA, Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 4I,J). Silencing of
TOP2A by SMARTPool siRNA in HCT116 ARID1A � / � cells
led to high levels of cell death, presumably because of the
pre-existing TOP2A defect in these cells (Fig. 4h).
It seemed possible that the defects in TOP2A localization and
cell cycle progression in ARID1A mutant cells would generate an
enhanced necessity for ATR function that could be therapeuti-
cally exploited with ATRi. TOP2A alleviates many of the
topological problems caused by chromosomal metabolism such
as catenated DNA and DNA transcription/replication interfer-
ence41. It seemed possible that cell division in the presence of a
TOP2A defect and a failure to adequately resolve such topological
problems could cause genomic instability and ultimately impair
the fitness of cells. In HCT116 cell cultures synchronized at the
late G1/early S phase boundary using a double thymidine block,
we found that exposure to VX-970 accelerated the rate of G2 exit,
so that ARID1A � / � cells no longer exhibited the G2/M cell cycle
progression delay seen in the absence of ATRi (Fig. 5a). In
addition, VX-970 exposure also resulted in reduced cytoplasmic
Cyclin

in
both
ARID1A þ / þ
and
ARID1A � / �
cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4H). Despite both wild type and ARID1A
null cells displaying increased mitotic entry in response to VX-
970, ATRi exposure led to increased anaphase bridges in
ARID1A � / �
cells compared with ARID1A þ / þ
(P ¼ 0.023,
Student’s t-test, Fig. 5b) an effect also observed in ARID1A
mutant TOV21G cells (P ¼ 0.006 by Student’s t-test, Fig. 5c).
VX-970 exposure also led to a significant enhancement in the
frequency of chromosomal aberrations in ARID1A � / � cells
compared with wild-type cells (P ¼ 0.0007, Student’s t-test,
Fig. 5d,e). In addition, we found that the VX-970-induced
gH2AX response, a marker of DNA damage, was more
pronounced in ARID1A � / � cells (Fig. 5f). A similar gH2AX
response was also observed in ARID1A mutant TOV21G cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4G). In ARID1A � / � cells exposed to ATRi
for a short period (2 h), we found an increase in H2AX
phosphorylation in Cyclin A positive as well as negative cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5A–D). The presence of VX-970-induced
H2AX phosphorylation in S phase cells was confirmed by western
blotting in synchronized cells as they transitioned through
S phase (Supplementary Fig. 5E). Taken together, this suggested
that the gH2AX response to ATRi in ARID1A � / � cells occu-
rred in S/G2 phases (Cyclin A positive) as well as in G1 phase
(Cyclin A negative) of the cell cycle, implying that processes
occurring in multiple phases of the cell cycle could contribute to
the synthetic lethal phenotype observed. It is possible that the
gH2AX response in Cyclin A negative cells could be initiated in
G1 itself or could be the result of DNA damage occurring during
mitosis becoming apparent as cells transit into G1 during the 2-h
ATRi exposure. We also noted that VX-970 exposure caused an
apoptotic response in ARID1A-deficient cells, as shown by higher
caspase-3/7 activation in ARID1A � / �
cells compared with
ARID1A þ / þ cells (Po0.05, Student’s t-test, Fig. 5g) and in
TOV21G compared with RMG1 cells (Fig. 3i). We also assessed
the induction of apoptosis in ATRi exposed cells by measuring
PARP-1 cleavage. Camptothecin elicited similar levels of cleavage
in both ARID1A � / � and ARID1A þ / þ cells, suggesting both
genotypes possessed a functional apoptotic response. In contrast,
VX-970
caused
far
higher
levels
of
PARP-1
cleavage
in
ARID1A � / � cells than in ARID1A þ / þ cells (Fig. 5h). From
this data we concluded that loss of ARID1A function results in:
(i) a defect in the ability of cells to recruit TOP2A to chromatin;
and (ii) cell cycle progression defects in both S and G2/M phases
of the cell cycle. It seems possible that these factors combined or
in isolation might render tumour cells sensitive to small molecule
ATRi as these agents impair the ability of cells to mount adequate
DDRs, while at the same time accelerating mitotic entry (Fig. 5i).
In addition to the model proposed (Fig. 5i), we also assessed
whether other mechanisms of ATRi sensitivity might explain, or
at least contribute, to the ARID1A synthetic lethality. The BAF

of ARID1A caused reduced transcription of any previously
established ATR synthetic lethal genes that could also explain the
ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethal effect. By comparing trans-

 reduction in mRNA levels of ATM, XRCC1, ATR or the ATR
activating genes RAD17, HUS1 or RAD9A in the ARID1A � / �
cells when compared with the HCT116 ARID1A þ / þ isogenic
model (Supplementary Data 4). ERCC1 defects have previously
been associated with ATRi sensitivity12 but in this analysis we
found ERCC1 transcript levels to be elevated in the ARID1A
defective cells, not decreased (Supplementary Data 4). Although
we cannot formally exclude the possibility that a transcriptional
mechanism contributes to the ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality,
we were unable to identify significant changes in gene expression
in isogenic models that might explain this.
We also assessed whether defects in ATR activity in ARID1A
defective cells might explain the synthetic lethal effects observed.
Shen et al. recently demonstrated that ATR and ARID1A directly
interact and loss of this interaction in HCT116 ARID1A � / �
tumour cells results in impaired ATR activation (as measured by
ATR autophoshorylation) in response to ionizing radiation,
although ATR signalling in response to agents that stall repli-
cation forks such as hydroxyurea (HU) and ultraviolet radiation
appeared normal32. We assessed whether ATR activity was impai-
red in HCT116 ARID1A � / � tumour cells as well as in a panel of
human tumour cell lines characterized according to their ARID1A
status (Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). We found that in response to
cisplatin, a platinum salt drug that causes replication fork stress43,
HCT116 ARID1A � / � and tumour cell lines with endogenous
ARID1A mutations exhibited similar protein expression of ATR
to ARID1A wild-type cells and clear ATR p.T1989 autopho-
sphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). This data suggested that
while ATR responses in HCT116 ARID1A � / � tumour cells to IR
are impaired32, this was not the case in a variety of tumour cells
exposed
to
cisplatin
(Supplementary
Fig.
1A,B)
or
other
replication fork stalling lesions32. As such, we were unable to
explain the ATRi sensitivity of ARID1A defective cells by reason
of reduced ATR activity.
Discussion
Our data suggest that ATRi could have potential as single-agent
treatments for ARID1A defective cancers. The highly recurrent
nature
of ARID1A
mutations
in human
cancer
and
the
availability of clinical ATRi suggests that once Phase I clinical
trials are complete, biomarker driven proof-of-concept trials
could be instigated to assess this hypothesis. These trials could be
conducted in cancer types where there is a high frequency of
ARID1A mutations, such as OCCC, where standard of care
therapeutic responses are limited and where few targeted
approaches exist.
In Fig. 5i, we present a working model to explain the ARID1A/
ATR synthetic lethality. There might of course be additional
mechanisms that also contribute to this synthetic lethality, as
highlighted earlier. Although we cannot find evidence for ATR
activation defects in ARID1A defective cells, we cannot formally
exclude the possibility that these processes play a part in the
synthetic lethal effect and act in parallel to the TOP2A and cell
cycle defects. In addition, cells utilizing the ALT-pathway of
telomere maintenance have also been shown to have increased
ATRi sensitivity44, although whether this effect operates in all
tumour cells with an ALT defect is not clear45. To our knowledge,
none of the models used here are ALT-positive. In addition, in
Fig. 4, we show that ARID1A defective cells have a delayed
progression through the cell cycle and specifically delayed
progression through S and G2/M. Cell cycle defects appear to
be an inherent characteristic of ARID1A/BAF defective cells, as
originally noted by others31,37; as such, it seems difficult to
eliminate the possibility that some other characteristic(s) asso-
ciated with reduced proliferation might also influence the
sensitivity of ARID1A mutant cells to ATRi. Topoisome-
rase function has also been implicated in the prevention of
deleterious collisions between the transcriptional and replication
machineries41, potentially providing another mechanism that, if
defective, could lead to a dependency upon ATR, and could
explain the S phase delay in ARID1A � / � cells. Finally it is poss-
ible that loss of ARID1A, by causing alterations in chromatin
structure that lead to an altered transcriptional programme, could
impair the expression of other genes critical for cells to survive in
the face of ATR inhibition. In this study we compared the trans-
criptional profiles of HCT116 ARID1A � / � and ARID1A þ / þ
cells but observed no clear defects in the transcript expression
of
genes
known
to
be
associated
with
ATRi
sensitivity
(Supplementary Data 4).
Our results, and previous work37 have detailed a role for
ARID1A in chromosomal decatenation through the appropriate
localization of TOP2A to chromatin. However, despite this defect
in TOP2A, tumour subtypes characterized by a high frequency of
ARID1A mutations, such as OCCC, have been reported to have
relatively ‘flat’ genomes (that is, relatively few large-scale genomic
alterations/rearrangements)46 compared with other gynaeco-
logical malignancies such as high-grade serous ovarian cancers.
While the TOP2A defect and ‘flat’ genomes might possibility be
viewed as inconsistent with one another, it is possible that the
TOP2A defect in ARID1A mutant tumours has relatively
moderate effects (compared with a profound homologous recom-
bination defect for example) on the structure of the genome as it
is normally kept in check by proteins such as ATR. Indeed, when

in isolation might render tumour cells sensitive to small molecule ATRi as these agents impair the ability of cells to mount adequate DDRs, while at the
same time accelerating mitotic entry. FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

 ARID1A defective cells are exposed to an ATRi, chromosomal
rearrangements are observed (Fig. 5d,e). We do note that
the potential for ATR inhibition to alter the genomic stability
of ARID1A mutant tumours in a genotype specific manner
(and therefore potentially tumour cell specific manner) might
have beneficial therapeutic effects but could also have deleterious
effects in driving tumourigenesis or drug resistance by the
generation of new oncogenic mutations and chromosomal
rearrangements. This is a challenge not just to the use of ATRi
but is also an issue of concern when using other agents whose
mechanism of action results in changes to the structure of the
genome. This issue could be addressed by assessing what
additional processes are required to ensure that any increase in
genomic instability results in tumour cell death, rather than cell
survival with a reordered genome.
Finally, we also note that the precise composition of the BAF
complex and the influence of other driver mutations in ARID1A
mutant tumours might also be important in determining the
ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality and our subsequent work will
focus on assessing how the balance between the different
members of the SWI/SNF complex might modulate the TOP2A
defect and ATRi sensitivity.
Methods
Cell lines. ES2 and TOV21G were obtained from the American Type Tissue
Collection. RMG-1, SMOV2, KOC7C, HCH1, OVAS, OVISE, OVMANA,
OVTOKO, OVSAYO and KK were courtesy of Dr Hiroaki Itamochi
(Tottori University School of Medicine, Yonago, Japan). OCCC lines were grown
in McCoys with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The identity of cell lines was confirmed
by short tandem repeat typing using the StemElite Kit (Promega) in March
2013 and yearly thereafter. ARID1A HCT116 isogenic cell lines were obtained from
Horizon Discovery and grown in McCoys with 10% FCS. Arid1a null and wild-type
mouse ES cells were obtained from Dr Zhong Wang (Harvard Medical School,
USA) and grown on gelatin coated plates in DMEM with 10% FCS supplemented
with 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM b-mercaptothanol and
2,000 U LIF ml � 1.
VE-821 siRNA screen. A siRNA library (1,280 siRNAs listed in Supplementary
Data 1) was purchased from Dharmacon. Genes were selected as described in the
main text. Each well contained a SMART pool of four distinct siRNA species
targeting different sequences of the target transcript. Each plate was supplemented
with negative siCONTROL (12 wells; Dharmacon) and positive control (four wells,
siPLK1, Dharmacon). RNAi screening conditions were optimized and raw
CellTitre-Glo (Promega) luminescent viability readings were generated as
previously described30. VE-821 or vehicle (DMSO) was added 24 h after
transfection at 1 mM concentration in media and cells were exposed for 5 days.
Statistical analysis of the siRNA screen was performed as described elsewhere30. In
brief, luminescence values from CellTitre-Glo assays in ATRi and DMSO exposed
cells were log2 transformed and then normalized to plate median (PM) effects.
Drug Effect (DE) scores were calculated from PM normalized data using the
equation: DE ¼ (log2 PM normalized signal of siRNA in the presence of ATRi)—
(log2 PM normalized signal of siRNA in the absence of ATRi). DE values were then
Z-score standardized according to screen median and median absolute deviation
values.
Chemicals. The ATRi VE-821 and VX-970 were provided by Vertex Pharma-
ceuticals. Olaparib and BMN673 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals; cisplatin
was purchased from Sigma.
Western blotting and antibodies. Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared
from cells lysed in NET-N buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40,
150 mM NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, West
Sussex, UK). Western blots were carried out with precast Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK). The following primary antibodies were used in this study; ARID1A
(1:1,000, Cell Signaling, D2A8U), ATR (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc1887), P-T1989
ATR (1:1,000, Gene Tex, GTX128145), Tubulin (1:10,000, Sigma, T6074), gH2AX
(1:3,000, Cell Signaling, 2,577), PARP-1 (1:3,000, Santa Cruz, sc-8007),
Ezrin (1:3,000, Cell Signaling, 3,145), TOP2A (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, D10G9),
Cyclin B1 (1:3,000, Cell Signaling, 4,138), Histone H3 (1:3,000, Cell Signaling,
9,715) and Lamin A/C (1:3,000, Cell Signaling, 4,777). Uncropped scans for all
western blots shown in Figs 1–5 are shown in Supplementary Figs 6–10.
Cellular viability assays. Short-term survival assays were performed in 384-well
plates. Exponentially growing cells were plated at a concentration of 500 cells per
well. Drug was added 24 h after seeding and cells were continuously exposed to the
drug for 5 days, after which cell viability was estimated using CellTitre-Glo
luminescence (Promega). For clonogenic assays, cells were seeded in six-well plates
(500 cells per well) and continuously exposed to drug 24 h after seeding for 14 days.
Media containing fresh drug was replaced every 72 h. Cells were fixed with
10% trichloroacetic acid and stained with sulphorhodamine B (Sigma-Aldrich,
Gillingham, UK). Colonies were counted manually. All cell-based assays were
performed at least in triplicate. Lines of best fit were plotted using a four-parameter
nonlinear regression or linear models where appropriate.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated at a density of 2 � 105 cells per well of a
six-well plate and incubated for 24 h after which ATRi or 0.1% DMSO was added
for the indicated period of time. After incubation, adherent cells were harvested
and then fixed with cold 50 (v/v)% ethanol in PBS. Cells were then treated with
RNase A for 30 min before nucleic acid staining with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma).
Samples were analysed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer using BD FACSDiva soft-
ware (BD Biosciences). For synchronization experiments cells were incubated with
2 mM thymidine for 12 h, washed and incubated with media for 16 h, then incu-
bated in 2 mM thymidine for a further 12 h. Cells were then released into media
containing either VX-970 or DMSO and samples fixed as above for cell cycle
analysis.
p-H3 assay. Following experimental treatment, cells were fixed using cold 50%
ethanol and PBS. Before analysis, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml
0.25% (v/v) solution of Triton-X100 in PBS for 15 min. Following centrifugation,
cells were resuspended in 100 ml of PBS solution containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.75 mg of P-S10 Histone H3 antibody (Jackson ImmunoR-
esearch). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Samples were then
centrifuged and washed with PBS solution containing 1% BSA. Cells were subse-
quently suspended in 100 ml of FITC-labelled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) in a 1:30 dilution in PBS with 1% BSA. Samples were
incubated in the dark for 30 min and resuspended in PBS solution containing PI
(5 mg ml � 1) and RNase (1 mg ml � 1). Samples were analysed on a BD LSR II flow
cytometer using BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).
Apoptosis assay. HCT116 isogenic and OCCC cells were plated in a 96-well plate
at high density (15–20,000 per well). Twenty four hours later serial dilutions of
VX-970 were added for the indicated period of time. ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay
(Promega) was performed as per the manufactures protocol.
In vivo efficacy studies. In vivo efficacy studies were performed using HCT116
ARID1A þ / þ, HCT116 ARID1A � / � and TOV21G cells injected subcutaneously
in the flank of female CD-1 Nude mice. Animals were treated with either vehicle
alone (10% D-a-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) or VX-970
(60 mg kg � 1 in 10% D-a-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) by oral
gavage. Treatment was administered four times weekly for the indicated length of
time. Tumours were measured manually by calliper trice weekly and animals were
sacrificed when tumours reached 415 mm in any direction. All in vivo modelling
was carried out according to ARRIVE guidelines, regulations set out in the UK
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and in line with a UK Home Office
approved project licence held by CJL and approved by the ICR ethics board.
Anaphase bridge analysis. Cells were grown on Poly-lysine-coated coverslips
for 24 h before exposure to the indicated treatment. Samples were fixed in
formaldehyde (4%), permeablized in Triton X-100 (0.2%) and DNA stained with
DAPI. Slides were then imaged at 60X on a Leica confocal microscope.
Mitotic spreads. Following exposure to the indicated treatment, cells were
incubated with 0.5% colchicine for 4 h. Cells were harvested, washed in PBS
and incubated in 0.56% KCl at 37C for 20 min. Samples were then fixed
(3 methanol:1 acetic acid) and DAPI was added. Cell solutions were dropped
onto clean coverslips and mitotic spreads imaged at � 60 on a Leica confocal
microscope.
Transcriptomic analaysis. Whole transcriptome analysis was performed on a
Illumina BeadArray HumanHT-12 v4 device at the Wellcome Trust Centre for
Human Genetics (University of Oxford). Three biological replicates of HCT116
ARID1A þ / þ and ARID1A � / � were analysed. Differential expression and
statistical analysis was performed using the LIMMA package from the
Bioconductor project47.
Immunofluorescence analysis of cH2AX. Cells were grown on poly-lysine-
coated coverslips for 24 h before treatment. Following treatment cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells
were stained with antibodies to gH2AX (Millipore, 05–636), Cyclin A
(Abcam, ab181591) and DAPI. Fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies were
