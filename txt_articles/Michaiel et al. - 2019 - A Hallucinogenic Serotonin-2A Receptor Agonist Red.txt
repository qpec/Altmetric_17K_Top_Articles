SUMMARY
Sensory perception arises from the integration of
externally and internally driven representations of
the world. Disrupted balance of these representa-
tions can lead to perceptual deficits and hallucina-
tions.
The
serotonin-2A
receptor
(5-HT2AR)
is
associated with such perceptual alterations, both in
its role in schizophrenia and in the action of halluci-
nogenic drugs. Despite this powerful influence on
perception, relatively little is known about how
serotonergic hallucinogens influence sensory pro-
cessing in the neocortex. Using widefield and
two-photon calcium imaging and single-unit electro-
physiology in awake mice, we find that administra-
tion of the hallucinogenic selective 5-HT2AR agonist
DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) leads to a
net reduction in visual response amplitude and sur-
round suppression in primary visual cortex, as well
as disrupted temporal dynamics. However, basic
retinotopic
organization,
tuning
properties,
and
receptive field structure remain intact. Our results
provide support for models of hallucinations in which
reduced bottom-up sensory drive is a key factor
leading to altered perception.
INTRODUCTION
Both externally (bottom-up) and internally (top-down) driven rep-
resentations of the world contribute to sensory perception.
Disruption of accurate sensory perception, as occurs during
hallucination, is hypothesized to result from increased top-
down and/or decreased bottom-up signaling, leading to exces-
sive reliance on prediction at the expense of sensory input
(Cassidy et al., 2018; Grossberg 2000). Abnormal serotonin-2A
receptor (5-HT2AR) activity is implicated in sensory hallucination,
defined as the misinterpretation of sensory stimuli in space or
time or the perception of an absent external stimulus. In partic-
ular, hallucinations and altered perception resulting from both
schizophrenia and psychedelic drug administration are pre-
vented by antagonism of 5-HT2ARs, supporting a central role
of this receptor in mediating hallucinations (Schmidt et al.,
1995; Vollenweider et al., 1998).
The cognitive and perceptual effects of 5-HT2AR modulation
have been extensively studied, particularly in the context of psy-
chedelic drugs (reviewed in Nichols, 2016). Recent studies have
begun to elucidate the action of serotonergic hallucinogens on
large-scale
brain
activity
in
humans
using
neuroimaging
methods (Preller et al., 2018; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). How-
ever, the impact on sensory information processing at the level
of single neurons and populations of neurons is largely unknown.
To our knowledge, measures of visually evoked responses after
5-HT2AR agonist administration in humans are limited to one
study, which showed large reductions in pre-stimulus alpha-
band LFP synchronization (Kometer et al., 2013). There have
been few studies of individual V1 neuron responses to visual
stimuli following administration of 5-HT2AR agonists, yielding
varying findings of suppression, facilitation, or bidirectional
changes in firing rate (Rose and Horn, 1977; Fox and Dray,
1979; Dray et al., 1980; Watakabe et al., 2009). Furthermore,
these studies were conducted in anesthetized animals, did not
measure individual neuron-tuning properties, and did not
address cell type or layer specificity.
The selective 5-HT2AR agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoam-
phetamine) is known to be a powerful hallucinogen in humans
(Shulgin and Shulgin, 1991) and has been used extensively to
study 5-HT2AR function in animal models, particularly of schizo-
phrenia and psychedelic drug action (for reviews, see Hanks and
Gonza
´ lez-Maeso, 2013; Nichols 2016). In this study, we as-
sessed the impact of DOI on visual processing at multiple scales,
from retinotopic maps to individual neurons, using widefield and
two-photon calcium imaging and single-unit electrophysiology in
awake, head-fixed mice. Our results demonstrating how a sero-
tonergic hallucinogen disrupts sensory processing should pro-
vide a deeper understanding of how cortical circuits generate a
representation of the world based on sensory input.
RESULTS
To measure the effects of 5-HT2AR activation on spatial and tem-
poral processing in visual cortex, we measured visual responses
in mice head-fixed on a spherical treadmill (Dombeck et al.,
2007) using widefield imaging and two-photon calcium imaging,
and single-unit electrophysiology with silicon probes (Figure 1A).

 Following presentation of a set of visual stimuli, mice received a
subcutaneous injection of either saline (control) or the 5-HT2AR
agonist DOI (10 mg/kg; see STAR Methods and Figure S1 for
an explanation of dose choice), and after a 15- to 20-min waiting
period, the stimulus set was repeated. To explore how previous
experience with visual stimuli may influence effects of 5-HT2AR
signaling, we performed a subset of these passive viewing ex-
periments with animals previously trained on a visually guided
task, in addition to standard non-trained animals. As visual re-
sponses and surround suppression are modulated by behavioral
state (Niell and Stryker, 2010; Ayaz et al., 2013), we separated
data into stationary or running periods for statistical comparison.
Notably, neither pupil size nor fraction of time running was
different following drug administration (Figure S2), suggesting
that changes observed were not due to differences in behavioral
state.
Widefield imaging of cortical excitatory neurons in CaMKIIa-
tTA:tetO-GCaMP6s mice (GCaMP6s mice; Wekselblatt et al.,
2016) revealed no change in the retinotopic map of azimuth
and elevation in visual cortex (Figures 1B and 1C; p = 0.999,
Kruskal-Wallis; see also Movie S1) but a dramatic reduction in re-
sponses to grating patches in visual areas after DOI, but not sa-
line, administration during stationary periods (Figures 1D and
1E). Interestingly, this reduction was larger in animals that had
previously received training on a visual task than in animals naive
to training (Figure 1F; p = 0.012, Kruskal-Wallis; paired t test: DOI
trained: p = 0.031, n = 5; DOI naive: p = 0.049, n = 6; saline trained:
p = 0.192, n = 5, saline naive: p = 0.917, n = 5). Passive stimuli
used here were similar to those used in previous behavioral ex-
periments (circular grating patches) but were different in size
and location in visual space (see STAR Methods for further de-
tails), arguing against effects of perceptual learning. Furthermore,

 baseline responses between trained and naive animals were not
statistically different (Figure S3).
Given that widefield signals represent the summed activity in
cell bodies, dendrites, and axons from many different excitatory
cortical neurons, we next used two-photon calcium imaging to
study the effect at the level of individual neurons, focusing on
spatial integration. A key mechanism by which V1 neurons inte-
grate information across space is through surround suppression,
where larger stimuli tend to decrease V1 responses. This phe-
nomenon can be explained by divisive normalization of ‘‘driving’’
classical receptive field (CRF) responses by ‘‘suppressive’’ re-
sponses in the extra-CRF (eCRF). We performed two-photon
imaging in L2/3 of V1 in GCaMP6s mice while showing grating
patches of varying sizes (5�–50�), which revealed clear surround
suppression in the neuropil responses (Figure 2A; see also Movie
S2). Consistent with widefield imaging, DOI reduced the magni-
tude of visual responses at the level of neuropil, as well as the
visual responses of individual neurons (Figure 2B). We computed
size tuning curves from the individual neuron data (Figure 2C), fit
these with a divisive normalization model (Ayaz et al., 2013; see
STAR Methods), and measured the coefficients of the driving
(RD) and suppressive (RS) fields. Both RD and RS were reduced
after administration of DOI, but not saline (Figure 2D). These
DOI-induced changes in RD and RS were significant for both

p = 0.031; saline naive: RD p = 0.744, RS p = 0.559; alpha =
0.025 corrected for multiple comparisons). Consistent with these
changes in RD and RS, DOI reduced the suppression index in
naive (stationary only) and trained (stationary and running) ani-
mals (Figures 2D and 2E; suppression index paired t test before
versus after: DOI trained: pstat = 0.005, prun = 0.014; DOI naive:

0.150; saline naive: pstat = 0.261, prun = 0.390).
In order to determine how 5-HT2AR activation affects temporal
dynamics of population activity, we recorded local field poten-
tials (LFPs) using silicon probes and found the average LFP po-
wer in all cortical layers was reduced across a wide frequency
range following administration of DOI in both spontaneous (not
shown) and visually evoked activity (Figure 3A; paired t test, cor-
rected for multiple comparisons: stationary saline: pdelta = 0.184,
ptheta = 0.531, palpha = 0.254, pbeta = 0.065, pgamma = 0.0361,

 n = 12 animals; stationary DOI: pdelta = 0.127, ptheta = 0.0015,
palpha = 0.002, pbeta = 0.0001, pgamma = 0.0001, n = 12 animals;
running saline: pdelta = 0.072, ptheta = 0.995, palpha = 0.572, pbeta =
0.616, pgamma = 0.287, n = 12 animals; running DOI: pdelta = 0.766,
ptheta = 0.0077, palpha = 0.02, pbeta = 0.0003, pgamma = 0.0005,
n = 12 animals; alpha = 0.01). Interestingly, the visual stimulus-
evoked increase in gamma power (28–35 Hz) was completely
abolished after DOI administration. These results are consistent
with findings from studies of hallucinogenic drug effects in
humans using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoen-
cephalography (MEG) (Kometer et al., 2013; Carhart-Harris
et al., 2016), which also show an overall reduction in oscillatory
synchronization.
We next aimed to examine how individual V1 neuron activity is
affected by 5-HT2AR activation by analyzing responses of iso-
lated single units to drifting sinusoidal gratings. We focused
this analysis on L2/3 and L5 because they display distinct
response properties (Niell and Stryker, 2008), and both excit-
atory and inhibitory neurons in these layers contain the highest
5-HT2AR density in mouse neocortex (Weber and Andrade,
2010). Units were classified as putative excitatory or narrow-
spiking inhibitory based on spike waveform (Niell and Stryker,

 2008). As such, inhibitory neurons in this study are likely fast-
spiking parvalbumin (PV) cells and not somatostatin (SOM)-ex-
pressing cells. Following DOI administration, the peak visually
evoked firing rate of excitatory V1 neurons was bidirectionally
modulated (Figure 3B; saline: r2 = 0.74, p = 0.679, n = 155;
DOI: r2 = 0.44, p = 0.181, n = 187; paired t test). Interestingly,
we observed rate-specific modulation of responses; neurons
with initially low firing rates were facilitated, and neurons with
initially high firing rates were suppressed (Figure 3C), similar to
observations with 5-HT2AR activation in anesthetized non-hu-
man primate and cat V1 (Watakabe et al., 2009; Rose and
Horn, 1977). In contrast to the excitatory neuron population,
inhibitory neurons did not change their peak evoked firing rate
(saline: r2 = 0.73, p = 0.103, n = 26; DOI: r2 = 0.93, p = 0.812,
n = 17; paired t test). The same pattern was observed during
locomotive states (not shown; saline excitatory: r2 = 0.55,
p = 0.057, inhibitory: r2 = 0.75, p = 0.215; DOI excitatory:
r2 = 0.44, p = 0.7.15e-05, inhibitory r2 = 0.93, p = 0.577; paired
t test).
To determine how strongly each cortical layer was affected by
DOI, we calculated modulation indices of stationary peak firing
rate across the neural population, where negative (positive)
values represent neurons that reduced (increased) their rate
following drug administration (Figures 3C and 3D). The distribu-
tions
were
shifted
overall
toward
suppression;
however,
because these distributions were bidirectional, we calculated
the mean absolute value for each layer to determine the strength
of modulation independent of sign. This revealed visually evoked
responses in L2/3 were more affected by DOI than saline (t test:
p = 0.005, corrected for multiple comparisons), whereas sponta-
neous rate was not affected (Figure 3E). Thus, the effects of DOI
are specific for layer and cell type and differ for spontaneous
versus evoked activity.
We next determined how DOI affected the time course of V1
responses based on the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) of
responses to drifting gratings (Figure 4A). Following DOI admin-
istration, we saw layer-specific changes in the mean PSTH of
visually responsive cells (neurons with peak visually evoked
rate greater than 2 Hz in either the pre- or post-recording block).
The mean response of both L2/3 and L5 was significantly
reduced (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; L2/3: pstat =
0.0001, n = 37, prun = 0.004, n = 61; L5: pstat = 0.001, n = 13,
prun = 0.026, n = 19), consistent with more neurons being sup-
pressed than enhanced, whereas inhibitory units were not
affected (inhibitory [inh.]: pstat = 0.878, n = 7, prun = 0.878, n = 10).
The time course of the mean PSTH showed a transient
response at stimulus onset followed by a smaller sustained
response, which was most pronounced in L2/3 neurons (Fig-
ure 4A). Notably, the transient (first 500 ms after stimulus onset)
and sustained (500 ms preceding stimulus offset) components
were differentially affected by DOI. We separated the two tempo-
ral components and found that L2/3 was strongly suppressed
during the transient component (pstat = 0.0002, prun = 0.0035)
and was only affected during the sustained component when an-
imals were running (p = 0.0007; Figure 4B). L5 and inhibitory
units, in contrast, did not show a significant net change in either
temporal component (L5trans pstat = 0.0471; L5trans prun = 0.864;
L5sus pstat = 0.436; L5sus prun = 0.727; inhtrans pstat = 0.587; inhtrans
prun = 0.875; inhsus pstat = 0.964; inhsus prun = 0.852). Thus, DOI
administration disrupts temporal dynamics of visual responses
in L2/3 by strongly reducing the onset transient.
We next determined if DOI affected the encoding of low-level
stimulus features and feature selectivity. Across the recorded
population of neurons, we found no change for the preferred
grating orientation following DOI administration (Figure 4C; saline:
r2 = 0.92, p = 0.346, n = 37; DOI: r2 = 0.87, p = 0.639, n = 33; not
shown; saline running: r2 = 0.87, p = 0.425, n = 27; DOI running:
r2 = 0.81, p = 0.873, n = 43; paired t test). The mean orientation
selectivity index was also unaffected by DOI and saline adminis-
tration (Figure 4D; Wilcoxon rank sum test on mean of stationary
and running; saline: p = 0.362, n = 100; DOI: p = 0.214, n = 91).
Preferred direction of grating motion and mean direction selec-
tivity index (DSI) were also unchanged (not shown; Wilcoxon
rank sum test; preferred direction saline stationary: r2 = 0.95 p =
0.912 n = 33, running: r2 = 0.5 p = 0.929 n = 25; DOI stationary:
r2 = 0.57 p = 0.861 n = 56; running: r2 = 0.46 p = 0.486 n = 62;
DSI saline stationary: p = 0.95 n = 71; running: p = 0.25 n = 71;
DOI stationary: p = 0.33, n = 64; running: p = 0.70, n = 64). We
also found no change in the distribution of spatial frequency pref-
erence for responsive cells, as the same proportions were selec-
tive to either low (0.01–0.02 cycles per degree [cpd]; paired t test
mean of running and stationary; saline: p = 0.435; DOI: p = 0.823),
medium (0.04–0.08 cpd; saline: p = 0.334; DOI: p = 0.397), or high
(0.16–0.32 cpd; saline: p = 0.640; DOI: p = 0.485) spatial
frequencies or to full-field flicker (saline: p = 0.267, DOI:
p = 0.577) following DOI treatment (Figure 4E; saline: n = 100;
DOI: n = 93). The observed changes in firing rate did not correlate
with tuning properties or selectivity (not shown; saline preferred
[pref] orientation [ori] stationary [stat]: r2 = 0.012, pref ori
moving [mv]: r2 = 0.034, orientation selectivity index [OSI] stat:
r2 = 0.005, OSI mv: r2 = 0.063; DOI: pref ori stat: r2 = 0.0001;
pref ori mv: r2 = 0.0096; OSI stat: r2 = 0.021; OSI mv: r2 = 0.053).
To determine the similarity in receptive field structure before
and after treatment, we calculated 2D correlation coefficients
between raw spike-triggered average receptive fields (STAs)
computed from pre- and post-recording sessions. We found
no significant differences between the distributions of coeffi-
cients calculated from saline and DOI recording blocks (Fig-
ure 4F; two-sample t test: p = 0.348, nsaline = 28, nDOI = 41).
Thus, despite significant changes in temporal dynamics and
spatial contextual modulation, basic tuning properties and
receptive field structure of individual V1 neurons were un-
changed after 5-HT2AR activation.
DISCUSSION
Using widefield and two-photon calcium imaging and single-
unit electrophysiology in awake mouse V1, we investigated
how systemic administration of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR
agonist DOI affects cortical processing of visual information.
We found reductions in response gain and surround suppres-
sion and altered temporal dynamics but no changes in basic
tuning properties. Together, this study provides a systematic
measurement of the effects of hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonist
administration on visual coding of cortical sensory neurons in
awake animals.

 It remains to be determined whether the observed effects are
due to action on 5-HT2ARs within V1 or elsewhere. Watakabe
et al. (2009) administered DOI locally through microinfusions in
V1 and also observed bidirectional firing rate modulation,
suggesting that 5-HT2AR activation in V1 is sufficient to drive
neurophysiological changes consistent with systemic DOI
administration. It is unknown, however, if local action of
5-HT2ARs in V1 alone is sufficient to drive perceptual changes.
Furthermore, the circuit mechanisms by which these 5-HT2AR-
mediated changes occur are unclear. Evidence also suggests
that other members of the 5-HT2 receptor family are activated
by DOI, albeit with significantly lower efficiency, and DOI is
more selective for 5-HT2AR than LSD (Knight et al., 2004). Given
that our dose is comparable to most studies of 5-HT2AR function
(see STAR Methods for discussion), we do not expect this to be
the case; however, we cannot rule out that 5-HT2B or 5-HT2C re-
ceptors contribute to our results. These issues will be important
to address in future studies of psychedelic drug influence on
sensory cortical processing.
5-HT2AR Activation Reduces Sensory Drive
Models of hallucination suggest that reductions in bottom-up
sensory drive can lead to a misinterpretation of sensory informa-
tion. We observed reduced visually evoked widefield calcium ac-
tivity, a measure of bulk activity in excitatory neurons, suggesting
5-HT2AR activity reduces sensory drive in cortex. At the level of
individual neurons, DOI administration bidirectionally modulated
firing rates, but the overall effect was a decrease in V1 re-
sponses, which has also been observed in anesthetized pri-
mates and cats (Watakabe et al., 2009; Dray et al., 1980; Rose
and Horn, 1977). Reduced sensory drive may lead to increased
dependence on top-down expectations, leading to misinterpre-
tation of sensory information, as hypothesized by current models
of hallucination (Cassidy et al., 2018; Grossberg, 2000).

 Previous in vivo studies have not discriminated between excit-
atory or inhibitory cell types or cortical layers in the context of
5-HT2AR modulation of V1 response properties. Both excitatory
and inhibitory populations showed bidirectional changes after
DOI administration, though inhibitory neuron changes were not
significant, possibly due to small sample size. Furthermore,
5-HT2AR activation resulted in layer-specific modulation of excit-
atory neuron activity, decreasing evoked responses in L2/3.
Given that subsets of excitatory and inhibitory neurons express
5-HT2ARs, with a majority in L5 (Weber and Andrade, 2010), it
is possible that the directionality of DOI-induced change in a
neuron’s visual response is determined by whether it expresses
5-HT2AR rather than its excitatory or inhibitory identity. Current
evidence points toward increased excitability in 5-HT2AR-
expressing neurons (Avesar and Gulledge, 2012; Stephens
et al., 2014), suggesting that non-expressing neurons, the major-
ity of V1, may be suppressed via network mechanisms.
A recent study (Seillier et al., 2017) observed changes in visual
responses after local iontophoresis of 5-HT into macaque V1 that
were quite similar to those seen here, including a net decrease in
response gain without change in selectivity, despite the fact that
5-HT itself acts on multiple receptor subtypes in cortex.
Together, our findings suggest that at least in visual cortex the
effect of 5-HT is dominated by the 2A subtype; however, future
studies could further examine how different serotonin receptor
subtypes contribute to modulation of sensory processing. Ad-
dressing these questions will require reliable genetic access to
5-HTR-family expressing neurons, which would also permit
manipulations to determine the specific circuits mediating the ef-
fects observed here (Gong et al., 2007).
5-HT2AR Activation Alters Visual Contextual Modulation
in Excitatory V1 Neurons
Beyond CRF properties, contextual influences are critical com-
ponents of visual processing. Lateral and top-down connections
are thought to be key mediators of contextual processing, which
is important for perceptual functions such as attention and
figure-ground segregation. Disrupted contextual processing,
including decreased visual surround suppression at the psycho-
physical and physiological levels, has been reported in patients
with schizophrenia (Butler et al., 2008; Tibber et al., 2013; Zen-
ger-Landolt and Heeger, 2003). Failure to appropriately incorpo-
rate contextual information could also underlie altered visual
perception observed with psychedelic drugs. We found reduced
surround suppression in V1 neurons resulting from decreased
strength of driving and suppressive field coefficients after
5-HT2AR activation, consistent with studies in patients with
schizophrenia. This suggests these receptors may be important
for
adjusting
the
influence
of
context
in
visual
cortical
processing.
The magnitude of DOI-induced change in some measures was
larger for trained than naive animals, including the amplitude of
responses measured with widefield imaging and the suppressive
field measured with two-photon imaging. Given that pupil diam-
eter and time spent running did not consistently change after DOI
administration (Figure S2), we do not anticipate changes seen
here reflect solely changes in behavioral state or depth of field.
Training on a visual task can result in a variety of changes in vi-
sual cortical processing, such as stimulus prediction or expecta-
tion, attention, stimulus encoding, and perceptual learning (for
review, see Khan and Hofer, 2018). These learning-induced
changes can be context specific and dependent on either bot-
tom-up or top-down inputs. The various inputs to V1 that are
modified by different learning paradigms could be differentially
affected by neuromodulators, and untangling the logic of
5-HT2AR modulation of specific V1 inputs may lend insight into
the mechanisms of learning-induced changes in V1.
5-HT2AR Activation Disrupts Temporal Dynamics of
Visual Responses
DOI disrupted temporal dynamics at the population level, where
we observed decreases in LFP power, and at the single-unit
level, where we observed strong suppression of the transient
onset response in L2/3 neurons. Previous studies suggest the
transient component of visual responses are more weakly tuned
than sustained responses (Ringach et al., 1997) and that tran-
sient responses may encode behaviorally relevant signals such
as salience, novelty, or expectation (Homann et al., 2017; Fiser
et al., 2016). Sustained responses may more accurately encode
stimulus identity. We found that 5-HT2AR activation differentially
affected these response components in a cell-type- and layer-
specific manner. Specifically, DOI altered transient responses
in excitatory, but not inhibitory, L2/3 neurons, whereas sustained
responses were unaffected. Given the relatively small effects of
DOI on sustained relative to transient responses, along with
the maintenance of feature selectivity in V1 neurons, these
data suggest 5-HT2AR activation does not disrupt stimulus en-
coding at the level of individual neurons but rather alters integra-
tion of top-down with bottom-up sensory information.
We also observed changes in temporal dynamics at the
population level as a dramatic 5-HT2AR-mediated decrease in
visually evoked LFP power across V1 layers. Patients with
schizophrenia (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010; Moran and Hong,
2011) and subjects administered psychedelic drugs (Liechti,
2017) display reduced oscillatory power specifically in the
gamma frequency band, which is associated with neuronal re-
sponses to visual stimuli (Liechti 2017; Sedley and Cunningham,
2013) and communication across neural populations through co-
ordinated activity (Jia et al., 2013). Additionally, animal models of
hallucination show reduced oscillatory synchronization across
various brain areas (prefrontal cortex [PFC]: Wood et al., 2012;
Celada et al., 2008; nucleus accumbens: Goda et al., 2013; hip-
pocampus, striatum, and reticular formation: Dimpfel et al.,
1989).
Implications for Models of Hallucination and Sensory
Processing
Despite these DOI-mediated changes in V1 sensory drive and
temporal dynamics, CRF tuning properties and stimulus encod-
ing remained unchanged. This suggests that altered visual
perception related to 5-HT2AR function results not from changes
in V1 stimulus encoding but from impaired downstream integra-
tion due to changes in gain and temporal dynamics. Consistent
with these findings, many perceptual deficits in patients with
schizophrenia are attributed to reduced gain of sensory re-
sponses (Butler et al., 2008; Phillips and Silverstein, 2013).
Cell Reports 26, 3475–3483, March 26, 2019

 Understanding the action of 5-HT2ARs may provide insight into
the general principles of cortical sensory processing, particularly
given the potent impact of hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists on
perception and cognition. There is increased urgency for under-
standing the neurophysiological effects of 5-HT2AR modulation
given the recent resurgence in use of psychedelic drugs in the
treatment of mental health disorders (Johnson and Griffiths,
2017; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). Our results provide
a basis for investigating circuit-specific actions of these drugs
in cortical function.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals: All procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by
the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Two- to eight-month old adult mice [C57BL/6J for electro-
physiology, CaMKII-tTA:tetO-GCaMP6s (Jackson Laboratories stock numbers 007004 and 024742) for imaging (Mayford et al.,
1996; Wekselblatt et al., 2016)] were initially implanted with a steel headplate over primary visual cortex to allow for head-fixation
during electrophysiology (Niell and Stryker, 2008) or imaging (Wekselblatt et al., 2016) experiments. In total, 26 male and 39 female
mice were used for this study. Animals were handled by the experimenter for several days before surgical procedures, and subse-
quently habituated to the spherical treadmill for several days before experiments. Some mice in imaging experiments were previously
trained on a two-alternative forced choice task, where they were water restricted and given water rewards based on leftward or right-
ward movements of the spherical treadmill during luminance discrimination and orientation/spatial discrimination of a grating patch
(for details, see Wekselblatt et al., 2016). The grating patches presented during passive viewing in this study were similar in quality
(45 deg, 0.16 cycles/degree for behavior, see below for passive parameters) but presented in a different location in visual space
compared to the previous behavioral training. These mice were not water restricted during the current experiments, and imaging
experiments performed under identical conditions as naive groups.
METHOD DETAILS
Surgical procedures
Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction, 1.5%–2% maintenance, in O2) and body temperature was maintained at
37.5�C using a feedback-controlled heating pad. Fascia was cleared from the surface of the skull following scalp incision and a
custom steel headplate containing a circular well was attached to the skull using Vetbond (3M) and dental acrylic. The headplate
well was centered over V1 (2.5-3 mm lateral of the midline and 1 mm anterior of Lambda). Carprofen (10 mg/kg) and lactated Ringer’s
solution were administered subcutaneously, and animals were monitored for three days following surgery.
For widefield imaging, a protective layer of cyanoacrylate adhesive (Loctite) was applied to the skull within the headplate well
(10 mm diameter) during headplate attachment. For two-photon experiments, a second surgery was performed at least 3 days after
headplate attachment, whereby a section of skull �5 mm in diameter was removed via dental drill, artificial dura (Dow-Corning 3-4680
Silicone Gel) was applied in the craniotomy, and a 5 mm glass coverslip was glued into place over the craniotomy. Antibiotics (ce-
fazolin, 10 mg/kg) were administered in the week surrounding the surgery, and an anti-inflammatory (dexamethasone, 10 mg/kg) was
administered 18h and 2h prior to surgery to prevent brain swelling.
For electrophysiology experiments, at least two days following headplate attachment a craniotomy (1 mm diameter) was made the
night before or several hours prior to the recording session. The cortical surface was covered with a layer of 1.5% agarose in 0.9%
saline and a layer of Kwik-Sil (WPI) to prevent drying and provide structural support.

 Experiments
Mice were head-fixed above a spherical treadmill and locomotion was measured via an optical mouse placed on the side of the
spherical treadmill using a custom MATLAB script. Visual stimuli were generated in MATLAB using the Psychophysics toolbox ex-
tensions (Brainard 1997; Pelli 1997), and presented on gamma-corrected LED monitors oriented tangentially 20-25 cm from the
contralateral eye (plus ipsilateral eye for widefield retinotopic mapping). Saline (0.9% NaCl) or DOI (Sigma, 10 mg/kg in saline)
was then administered subcutaneously, and visual responses to the same stimulus set (presented in reverse order) were recorded
again after a waiting period of 15-20 min. Mice were monitored for front paw stereotypy, which DOI reliably induced within 5-7 min
following injection.
This dose of 10 mg/kg was chosen based on standards in the literature, which range from 1-10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (Freo et al.,
1992; Aulakh et al., 1992; Garcia et al., 2007; Gonza
´ lez-Maeso et al., 2007). Subcutaneous injection was used rather than intraper-
itoneal to prevent having to remove the animal from the head-fixed setup between pre and post stimulus presentations. We estimate
that our effective dose is approximately equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal based on previous comparisons of the two injection
methods, where serum levels tend to rise more slowly and peak at significantly lower concentrations after subcutaneous injection
(Porter et al., 1985; Turner et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2011; Hirota and Shimizu, 2012). Previous work revealed LSD elicited head
bob behavior in rabbits occurs independent of the route of administration (Schindler et al., 2012). However, to confirm that we
were not using an excessively high dose, we tested a lower dose in a subset of widefield experiments (2 mg/kg subcutaneous)
and saw no significant change in response amplitude relative to baseline (see Figure S1).
Widefield Imaging
A widefield microscope (Scimedia, Inc.) equipped with a sCMOS camera (PCO, 10 Hz acquisition) was used to measure GCaMP6s
signal though the skull during blue LED excitation (Luxeon Rebel 470 nm, 0.1 mW/mm2 at the sample). In a subset of experiments, a
green LED (Luxeon Rebel 530 nm, 0.1 mW/mm2 at the sample) was used for excitation every four frames to measure hemodynamic
signals, which were subtracted from the blue frames (Wekselblatt et al., 2016). The change in fluorescence relative to baseline (DF/F)
was calculated for each pixel individually using its mean value as F. Visual areas were first mapped using a topographic stimulus
consisting of a bar of 1/f noise sweeping in either azimuth or elevation, and the amplitude and phase of the Fourier component of
the DF/F signal were calculated at the stimulus frequency (0.1 Hz), which were later used to align sessions across animals (Kalatsky
and Stryker, 2003). Vertical and horizontal stationary grating patches (0.16 cpd, 30 deg) were presented to the right eye with 1 s dura-
tion and 1 s inter-stimulus interval. For each animal, a central point in V1 corresponding to the approximate response peak was
selected, and the pixels around this point in a 5 X 5 region were averaged to create DF/F traces. To analyze spatial spread of
responses, an elliptical meshgrid was generated around this central point, with a 2:1 ratio of the major:minor axes aligned in the ante-
roposterior:mediolateral dimensions to account for cortical magnification factor, and the points along this meshgrid radiating out
from the center were averaged along these concentric ellipses to create an average DF/F for a given distance from the center point
along the minor axis of the ellipse. Normalized DF/F change was calculated as (post-pre)/mean(post,pre).
Two-photon imaging
A two-photon microscope (Neurolabware, 16X Nikon CFI75 LWD objective) was used to measure GCaMP6s signal through the cra-
nial window at 920 nm laser excitation (Mai-Tai, Spectra-Physics). �800 mm by 800 mm frames were acquired at 10 Hz using Scanbox
software. Visual areas were first mapped using widefield imaging (described above), then V1 was targeted and the stimulus screen
and field of view were adjusted to center the visual response. A mapping stimulus (see widefield imaging methods) was first used to
measure spatial receptive fields, followed by a period of darkness (5 min) to measure spontaneous activity. Then a �22 min stimulus
was shown to measure surround suppression, which consisted of binarized grating patches at various sizes (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50
deg of visual field), spatial frequencies (0.04, 0.16 cycles/deg), and orientations (0, 90�) at a 2 Hz temporal frequency and full contrast,
with 0.5 s duration and 0.5 s inter-stimulus interval.
Cell footprints were extracted using constrained nonnegative matrix factorization, with a spatially homogeneous neuropil response
factored out (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016). DF/F was calculated for all pixels using the 10th percentile as F, and then traces for all cells
were deconvolved using constrained foopsi. Data for each specific stimulus were then analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts. For
surround suppression data, DF/F within each inter-trial-interval was averaged and subtracted from the ensuing trial, and the DF/F
traces during blank stimuli (mean luminance gray identical to inter-trial-interval) were averaged across the experiment and subtracted
from all trials (separately for stationary and running trials). Only neurons whose somata were within the region of neuropil activated by
the 10 deg stimulus were included in the analysis, constrained within an elliptical region with a 2:1 major:minor axis ratio along the
anteroposterior:mediolateral dimensions to account for cortical magnification factor, with a manual rotational offset and overall size
chosen to closely match each individual animal’s response pattern. Within this region, only neurons with responses to any one of the
stimulus types (combination of size, spatial frequency, orientation) greater than 10% DF/F for both pre and post drug injection
were included in analyses. For all two-photon group analyses, averages were taken across cells (within animal) and these values
were then used to calculate group mean/standard error. For surround suppression experiments, a divisive normalization model

 (Ayaz et al., 2013) was used to fit the data for pre and post injection periods separately, then all variables except RD and RS were
constrained as the average of pre/post values, and the fits were run again. The equation fit to each animal’s size tuning curve was:
RðdÞ =
RD �
 
erf
 
d
sqrtð2Þ � sD
!!m
1 + RS �
 
erf
 
d
sqrtð2Þ � sS
!!m
where RD and RS are the strengths of the driving and suppressive fields, sD and sS are the extents of the driving and suppressive
fields, m is an exponent, d is the diameter of the stimulus, and erf is the error function. The coefficient of determination for each group
was: saline naive r2 = 0.939, saline trained r2 = 0.928, DOI naive r2 = 0.867, DOI trained r2 = 0.941, and there was no significant dif-
ference between pre and post fit r2 for any group (paired t test). Suppression index was calculated as (RMAX - R50d)/(RMAX + R50d)
where RMAX is the largest response across all sizes, and R50d is the response to the largest stimulus (50 deg). Normalized change
for RD, RS, and suppression index was calculated as (post-pre)/mean(post,pre).
Extracellular Multichannel Electrophysiology
Multisite silicon probes (NeuroNexus, A2x32-5mm25-200-177) coated with a small amount of the lipophilic dye DiO (Invitrogen) were
inserted through the overlaying agarose and into monocular V1 using a microdrive (Siskiyou Designs). Electrode penetrations were
done over the course of 30 min – 1 h and the probe was allowed to settle in its final position for at least 30 min before data collection
began. Hand-mapped receptive fields were used to approximately center the screen position on receptive field centers. Contrast-
modulated noise movies (Gaussian 1/f) were presented and spike-triggered averaging (STA) was utilized to estimate spatial receptive
fields as in Niell and Stryker (2008). Full-field drifting sinusoidal gratings were presented at twelve evenly spaced directions of motion,
six spatial frequencies (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, and 0.32 cpd), and full-field flicker (0 cpd) with temporal frequency of 2 Hz. Stim-
ulus presentations were randomly interleaved for 1.5 s duration, with 1 s inter-stimulus interval. To estimate spontaneous firing rate, a
gray blank condition (mean luminance) was also presented. For darkness recordings, the computer monitor was turned off and other
sources of light in the room were covered.
At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized by deep anesthesia and cervical dislocation. Following removal, brains were
immersed in 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS at 4�C. 100 mm coronal sections were cut with a vibratome and mounted
using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) then imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 to determine the depth of electrode pene-
trations. Each site along the electrode was given a layer assignment based on its position on the probe relative to the depth of the
probe tip and geometry of the penetration angle. In addition to histology, current source density was also used to identify cortical
layers in neural recordings (Hoy and Niell, 2015).
Data acquisition was performed as described by Niell and Stryker (2008). Signals were acquired using a System 3 workstation
(Tucker-Davis Technologies) and analyzed with custom software in MATLAB (MathWorks). Extracellular signals were filtered from
0.7 to 7 kHz and sampled at 25 kHz. We detected spiking events on-line by voltage threshold crossing, and a 1 ms waveform sample
on four adjacent recording sites was acquired, creating a virtual tetrode. Single-unit clustering and spike waveform analyses were
performed using a combination of custom software in MATLAB and Klusta-Kwik (Harris et al., 2000), as described previously (Niell
and Stryker, 2008). Quality of unit separation was based on a clear refractory period of less than 0.01% of spikes within a 1 ms inter-
spike interval and by the computed L ratio (Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005). Units were also checked for stability by confirming that
their peak amplitude remained consistent over the course of the recording session. Units that were found by histology to be outside of
V1 were excluded from subsequent analysis.
Movement signals from the optical mouse were acquired at up to 300 Hz and integrated at 100 ms intervals (Mx310; Logitech), as
originally described by Niell and Stryker (2010). By using these measurements, we calculated animals’ mean speed for every stimulus
presentation. Trials with mean speed above 0.5 cm/s were considered movement trials.
For LFP analysis, the extracellular signal was filtered from 1 to 300 Hz and sampled at 1.5 kHz. The power spectrum was computed
using multi-taper estimation in MATLAB with the Chronux package (Mitra and Pesaran, 1999; Mitra and Bokil, 2007), with a sliding
window and three to five tapers. Spectra were normalized for presentation by applying a 1/f correction (Sirota et al., 2008). Traces of
individual experiments were normalized to the range of either the pre or post recording block across all experiments before
averaging.
Units were classified as narrow or broad spiking based on properties of their average waveforms at the electrode site with largest
amplitude. As detailed in Niell and Stryker (2008), two parameters—(1) height of the positive peak relative to the initial negative trough
and (2) time from the minimum of the initial trough to maximum of the following peak—were sufficient to generate two linearly sepa-
rable clusters corresponding to narrow spiking (putative inhibitory) and broad-spiking (putative excitatory) neurons. These clusters
were separated using K-means.
Average evoked firing rate was calculated following a baseline subtraction of the spontaneous rate during 1 s inter-stimulus
intervals. Modulation indices were calculated for evoked (1 Hz threshold) and spontaneous (0.5 Hz threshold) rates where
MI = (Rpost-Rpre)/(Rpost+Rpre). Peri-stimulus time histograms were calculated using 100 ms time bins over the 1.5 s duration of
e3

 each stimulus presentation and 1 s ISI. Visually responsive units included in the analysis were defined as units with an average firing
rate above 2 spikes/s after baseline subtraction for either pre or post recording blocks.
We calculated preferred angle of orientation by finding the stimulus orientation that elicited the peak response for each cell on
average, regardless of spatial frequency. The OSI was calculated as the depth of modulation from the preferred orientation to its
orthogonal orientation qortho = qpref + p/2, as (Rpref - Rortho)/(Rpref + Rortho). Preferred spatial frequency was determined by finding
the spatial frequency that elicited the largest response, on average. We used STAs of individual units recorded before and after
drug administration to calculate 2-D correlation coefficients as a measure of similarity of receptive field structure.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Two-tailed paired t tests or Wilcoxon Rank sum tests were used to compare data before versus after drug administration. For com-
parisons between saline and DOI, two-sample tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov or two-sample two-tailed t tests were used. For
comparison of trained and naive saline and DOI groups, Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Tukey-Kramer tests were used. Significance
was defined as p < 0.05, and in the case of multiple comparisons a Bonferroni correction was implemented.
