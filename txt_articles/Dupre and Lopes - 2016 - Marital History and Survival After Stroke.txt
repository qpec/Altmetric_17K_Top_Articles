 Marital History and Survival After Stroke
Matthew E. Dupre, PhD; Renato D. Lopes, MD, PhD
Background-—Stroke is among the leading causes of disability and death in the United States, and nearly 7 million adults are
currently alive after experiencing a stroke. Although the risks associated with having a stroke are well established, we know
surprisingly little about how marital status influences survival in adults with this condition. This study is the first prospective
investigation of how marital history is related to survival after stroke in the United States.
Methods and Results-—Data from a nationally representative sample of older adults who experienced a stroke (n=2351) were
used to examine whether and to what extent current marital status and past marital losses were associated with risks of dying after
the onset of disease. Results showed that the risks of dying following a stroke were significantly higher among the never married
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.31–2.24), remarried (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06–1.44), divorced (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01–1.49), and
widowed (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10–1.43) relative to those who remained continuously married. We also found that having multiple
marital losses was especially detrimental to survival—regardless of current marital status and accounting for multiple
socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological risk factors.
Conclusions-—Marital history is significantly associated with survival after stroke. Additional studies are needed to further examine
the mechanisms contributing to the associations and to better understand how this information can be used to personalize care
and aggressively treat vulnerable segments of the population.

Key Words: marital status • mortality • stroke
S
troke is among the leading causes of disability and death
in the United States, and upwards of 800 000 adults will
experience a stroke this year.1 The onset of stroke is a major
health event that can have immediate and lasting conse-
quences on one’s physical well-being and survival.1–3 It is well
established that access to quality care, the reduction of
known risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, and obesity),
and adhering to treatment regimens (eg, rehabilitative activ-
ities, medications) are important components of recovering
from a stroke and improving survival outcomes.1,4 Moreover,
studies have suggested that social support, such as marriage,
can have a significant impact on treatment and prognosis in
adults diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.5,6 However, the
extent to which marital history is associated with survival
after a stroke remains largely unknown.
Studies suggest that adults who are not married have
greater risks of stroke than married adults.7–10 Whether and
to what extent marital life is associated with one’s prognosis
after a stroke is not well documented. The research that
does exist—largely from clinical studies outside of the
United States and often dated—suggests that persons who
are not married are more likely to die following a stroke than
those who are married.11–14 Although the evidence is
limited, these findings are consistent with a large body of
literature showing that individuals who are not married have
fewer
economic
resources,
less
social
support,
more
unhealthy behaviors, and ultimately worse health outcomes
than their married counterparts.15–19 To our knowledge,
however, no existing studies have examined the association
between marital status and the prospects of survival after
stroke in the US population. Furthermore, studies have
largely ignored whether lifetime exposure to marital loss(es)
may be associated with cardiovascular health and overall
mortality.20–22

 This study is the first prospective investigation of how
marital history is related to survival after stroke in the United
States. Data from a nationally representative sample of US
older adults were used to examine whether and to what
extent current marital status and past marital losses were
associated with risks of dying after the onset of stroke. We
examined whether multiple socioeconomic, psychosocial,
behavioral, and/or physiological risk factors accounted for
the associations and assessed differences by sex and race/
ethnicity.
Methods
Study Population
Nationally representative data from the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) were used for analysis. The HRS is an ongoing
prospective cohort study of US adults older than 50 years
sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the
Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.23
The original HRS cohort included 9824 age-eligible respon-
dents born in 1931–1941 who have been interviewed
biennially since 1992. The initial response rate was 82% and
reinterview response rates were �94% for 1994–2010, with
low attrition due to nonresponse and lost tracking. Since
1998, the HRS has been supplemented with age-selective
birth cohorts to replenish the nationally representative sample
of older adults. Details of the multistage sampling design,
implementation, and response rates have been documented
in detail elsewhere.20,23,24
Data for this study were drawn from 10 waves of
interviews (1992–2010) from 30 661 respondents in the
original HRS cohort, the Asset and Health Dynamics Among
the Oldest Old cohort (AHEAD; ≤1923), Children of Depres-
sion (CODA; 1924–1930), War Baby cohort (WB; 1942–1947),
and the Early Baby-Boom cohort (EBB; 1948–1953), who were
first interviewed in 1992, 1993, 1998, and 2004, respectively,
and reinterviewed through 2010. Data for 2012 were not used
for this analysis because information on respondent mortality
is not currently complete for this period. The analyses were
restricted to respondents who reported the incidence of
stroke during the 10-wave observation period from 1992–
2010 (n=2487). At each interview, participants were asked
whether “a doctor ever told you that you had a stroke” and in
what year (and month after 1994) it occurred. Although
patients’ reports of stroke are less precise than clinical data,
studies show consistency between diagnostic reports of
serious health events from survey respondents and those
from medical evaluations, including stroke.25,26 Although
information on stroke subtype was not available, we expected
that most HRS participants experienced an ischemic stroke
(�90%), comparable to national estimates.1 We excluded 10
cases because of inconsistent or erroneous values on the
timing
of
stroke.
Forty-six
respondents
were
excluded
because their marital history (if any) could not be determined
and an additional 80 cases were dropped because of missing
data on other baseline measures. The final analytic sample
included 2351 adults aged 41 years and older who con-
tributed an average of 5.3 person-years over the 18-year
observation period. The data used in this study were
de-identified and publicly accessible and deemed exempt
from the Duke University institutional review board.
Measurement
A distinctive feature of the HRS is the collection of marital
histories from more than 50 years of prospective and
retrospective interview data. Marital information was ascer-
tained from detailed responses to questions about the
beginning/ending dates (in years and/or months) of all
marriages and marital losses reported by study participants.
Although we could not confirm the dates that respondents
provided for the retrospective timing of marital events,
research has shown “substantial agreement” between marital
dates reported retrospectively and those reported by the
same individuals in a panel design.27 Several time-varying
dichotomous measures were used to capture past and
present marital life. Current marital status was categorized
as never married, continuously married, remarried, divorced,
or widowed. The cumulative number of marital losses
experienced through divorce or widowhood was categorized
as 0, 1, or ≥2 marital losses. For respondents with a history of
marital loss, we further disaggregated the currently remarried,
divorced, and widowed participants into those with 1 or ≥2
marital losses. Preliminary analyses indicated that divorce and
widowhood had comparable risks for mortality, and the
limited number of respondents who reported being widowed
more than once (n=22) prohibited including separate mea-
sures for marital loss(es) due to widowhood and divorce.
Being continuously married (ie, never divorced or widowed)
was the reference group in the analyses.
The multivariate models adjusted for background charac-
teristics that included age at onset (in years), sex, race/
ethnicity
(non-Hispanic
white,
non-Hispanic
black,
non-
Hispanic other race, or Hispanic), whether a proxy assisted
the interview (yes or no), and geographic region (South).
Several categories of previously identified risk factors and
resources were also examined as possible factors contribut-
ing to the associations. Socioeconomic factors included the
respondents’ educational attainment (in years), total house-
hold income in thousands of dollars (logarithmic scale), and
health insurance coverage from any source (yes or no).
Psychosocial factors included having any children (yes or no),
friends or relatives in the neighborhood (yes or no), regularly

 attends religious services (yes or no), and number of
depressive symptoms measured by the 8-item abbreviated
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D;
range=0–8). Behavioral factors included past or current
smoking status (yes or no), excessive alcohol use (≥3 drinks
per day; yes or no), vigorous physical exercise (<3 times per
week; yes or no), and adherence to hypertension medication
(yes or no). Physiological factors included body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared; <18.5 [underweight], 18.5–24.9 [normal weight],
25.0–29.9 [overweight], or ≥30.0 [obese]), number of activ-
ities of daily living limitations (range=0–5), diagnosed chronic
illness
(diagnosed
with
hypertension,
diabetes,
chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer; yes or no), and
recurrent stroke (yes or no). Preliminary analyses also
included variables in the models to adjust for study cohort
(eg, original HRS, CODA, EBB), urban-rural residence, lifetime
occupational status, household wealth, and spouses from the
same household (�55%); however, results were not significant
and the variables were dropped from the final models.
Coding of the time-varying measures was facilitated by using
HRS data files provided by RAND—funded by NIA and the Social
Security Administration.28 Alternative coding strategies were
also assessed for the continuous variables (eg, logged,
polynomial, and grouped-ordinal scales) and categorical vari-
ables (eg, different cutpoints, categories, and reference groups)
and did not alter the central findings. With the exception of age,
sex, and race/ethnicity, all measures were time varying and
time lagged (observed in the previous wave [ie, within the prior
24 months]) in the prospective analyses to establish the
temporal order of the associations among the marital factors,
covariates, and subsequent mortality.29 Alternative lag times
(eg, no lag, 12 months, 48 months) were also assessed in
preliminary analyses and produced largely consistent results.
Outcome
Mortality from all causes was the outcome for analysis.
Deaths from all causes were included because many adults
who experience a stroke die from related or other causes1,30
and because the majority of studies examining survival after a
stroke include all-cause mortality as the outcome.1,11–14 All
participants in the study were followed prospectively for
mortality through 2010. Participants who died were identified
using the National Death Index and the HRS tracking file.24
Time until death was calculated from the participants’ date of
stroke onset and the date of death. A person-year file was
constructed from the respondents’ cumulative exposure to
death so that each observation was a record for every
additional year beyond the time of onset. A total of 1362
deaths (58%) were reported during the 15 946 person-years
of observation.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline distributions of the study variables were computed
for all participants and by survival status. Comparisons by
survival status were calculated with t tests for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
P values were based on 2-tailed tests and considered
statistically significant at P<0.05. Age-adjusted plots were
used to describe differences in survival rates over the study
period for the separate indictors of marital history. Cox
proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of mortality associated with marital
status and marital loss(es). The number of tied events relative
to the number at risk was low (<1%) and partial likelihood
estimation was nearly identical using Breslow (reported here)
and Efron approximations.
The first set of multivariate models examined the risks of
dying after a stroke related to: (1) current marital status, (2)
number of marital losses, and (3) the combination of marital
losses with current marital status while adjusting for age at
onset, sex, race/ethnicity, proxy interview, and geographic
region. The second set of multivariate analyses adjusted for
additional sets of covariates to examine the potential factors
contributing to mortality risks associated with marital history.
Akaike information criteria values were used to compare log-
likelihood functions to assess model fit across the non-nested
models.31 The associations were also assessed for differ-
ences by sex and race/ethnicity.
Four sets of sensitivity analyses were also conducted.
First, tests of interactions with analysis time and tests of
Schoenfeld residuals using robust variance-covariance matrix
estimation indicated that the proportional hazard assumption
was not violated. Second, we assessed whether selective
survival may have contributed to the findings. Excluding adults
older than 90 years at baseline (n=110; 4.7%) produced
results that were largely unchanged. Third, although missing
data were minimal across study variables for follow-up
measurements (�2%), preliminary analyses showed that the
results were unchanged using multivariate imputation, mean
replacement, and forward imputation from baseline/prior
interview data (used here). Finally, the data were not weighted
because the study focuses on a selective subsample of HRS
respondents (stroke survivors) and the multivariate models
included variables related to initial sample selection (age, sex,
race, region) to produce unbiased estimates.32 All analyses
were conducted using Stata 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX).

 lower body mass index, more activities of daily living
limitations, and more likely to have other diagnosed chronic
illness(es) and require a proxy-assisted interview. In terms of
marital history, adults who experienced no marital loss
(P<0.001) and were continuously married (P=0.002) at
baseline were significantly more likely to survive after a
stroke than their adult counterparts with marital instability.
Figure 1 further illustrates the age-adjusted survival rates for
each of the marital status and marital loss groups over the
study period. Compared with adults who were continuously
married, survival rates were significantly lower for those who
were never married (P=0.005), remarried (P=0.010), divorced
(P=0.048), or widowed (P≤0.001). Similarly, adults with one
(P=0.004) or ≥2 (P≤0.001) marital loss(es) had significantly
lower rates of survival than adults with no marital loss. Further
details of the characteristics of study participants are
provided by marital group in Table S1.
Table 2 presents the sociodemographically adjusted HRs
for the associations between marital status (model 1) and
marital losses (model 2) and the risk of dying after a stroke.
Results from model 1 showed that risks were higher in adults
who never married (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.31–2.24), remarried
(HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06–1.44), divorced (HR, 1.23; 95% CI,
1.01–1.49), and widowed (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10–1.43)
relative to those who remained continuously married. Model 2
showed that one lifetime marital loss was significantly
associated with dying after a stroke (HR, 1.20; 95% CI,
1.06–1.35) and a history of ≥2 marital losses was associated
with significantly greater risks (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.19–1.66)
after accounting for differences in age at onset, sex, race,
ethnicity, proxy interview, and geographic region. Model 3
further disaggregated the participants’ history of marital
losses with their current marital status. Results showed that
being never married or having a history of marital instability
was significantly associated with increases in one’s risk of
dying after a stroke; furthermore, having multiple marital
losses is especially detrimental to survival regardless of one’s
current marital status.
Figure 2 presents the sociodemographically adjusted HRs
from model 3 and the fully adjusted model that accounts for
socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological
factors that may have contributed to marital differences in
mortality following a stroke. Overall, we found that adults who
never married and those who were unmarried after one
divorce or widowhood in their lifetime were not significantly
different from continuously married adults after taking into
account differences in more than a dozen explanatory
variables. However, we found that adults with more than
one marital loss remained significantly more likely to die
regardless of their current marital status.
Reductions in HRs and estimated Akaike information
criteria values indicated that each category of covariates
had comparable levels of explanatory power (Table 3).
Physiological factors had the greatest overall model fit for
estimating the risk of dying after a stroke—and largely
attenuated the survival differences among the widowed.
Psychosocial factors had the largest reduction in risks for
adults who never married, and socioeconomic factors had the
largest reduction in risks for divorced adults with multiple
marital losses. Supplementary analyses were also conducted
to examine whether the associations varied for men and
women or by race/ethnicity. Of the multiple interactions that
were tested, there was no evidence that the key findings
significantly differed by sex or race/ethnicity.
Discussion
This study provides the first evidence of how current and past
marital experiences are associated with survival after a stroke
in US older adults. Compared with adults who were contin-
uously married, we found that those who never married or

 experienced a marital dissolution were significantly more
likely to die following a stroke. The risks associated with
multiple marital losses were especially high and were not
reduced with remarriage. Furthermore, we found that adjust-
ments for multiple socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral,
and physiological factors helped to explain some of the
associations.
Previous studies have shown associations between marital
status and multiple health outcomes.16,33,34 The current study
builds on this literature and is the first to demonstrate an
association between marital history and prospective survival
after the onset of a stroke. For adults who never married, we
found that the risks of dying after a stroke were 71% greater
than adults who were continuously married. Results from
multivariate models suggested that these risks were largely
attenuated by differences in psychosocial factors—including
the lack of children, limited social support, and depressive
symptoms—that may have inhibited recovery. We also found
that the mortality risks associated with divorce and widow-
hood were 23% and 25% greater, respectively, than adults who
were continuously married. These risks were especially
pronounced in those with multiple marital losses (39% and
40%, respectively), and although these increased risks were
attenuated most by socioeconomic factors—such as house-
hold income and health insurance—the study did not fully
account for the 25% to 50% increase in death for these older
adults relative to their continuously married counterparts. It
may be that more detailed measures of social support and/or
psychological distress are needed to better account for how a
history of marital instability is detrimental to survival after the
onset of a major illness. Therefore, we encourage future
studies to consider additional factors that may be contributing
to these findings.
Two notable findings warrant comment. First, we found
that the mortality risks in adults who were divorced once were
not significantly different from adults who were continuously
married. Further analysis also showed that the increased risks
in divorced adults with multiple marital losses were partially
attributable to the risks of a prior widowhood. These findings
are not entirely unexpected and are consistent with previous
studies showing that the risks associated with divorce
diminish over time.16,35 In the current study of stroke
survivors, we expect that marital loss due to widowhood is
more contemporaneous with the occurrence of stroke at older
ages and, subsequently, more salient to the risks associated
with mortality. A second notable finding was that remarried

 adults were significantly more likely to die following a stroke
relative to continuously married adults. We found that
remarried adults with more than one marital loss had
mortality risks that were nearly equivalent in magnitude to
their divorced counterparts (HRs 1.48 versus 1.50, respec-
tively). Although counterintuitive to the generally ascribed
benefits of marriage, there is evidence for this finding in
related research. For example, studies have shown that
remarried adults have significantly greater levels of physical
and psychological illness than adults who are continuously
married.20,33,36 Alternatively, continuous marriages have been
shown to provide stable socioeconomic, behavioral, and
psychosocial resources that accumulate and solidify over
time.18,36,37 Faced with a stroke, we suspect that those with
stable marriages draw from these protracted resources to
better manage disease and prolong survival after experiencing
a life-threatening event. The present findings corroborate this
association to suggest that remarriage after divorce or
widowhood may not confer the same health benefits for
those who remained stably married.
An important area for future research will be to investigate
the mechanisms underlying the findings from this study and
to identify possible interventions to reduce these risks. The
prevailing argument is that marital instability is negatively
associated with the economic, behavioral, and psychosocial
well-being of individuals that reduces their ability to prevent
and treat illness.18,38–40 Contrary to expectations and existing
literature, we found that factors such as income, health
insurance, depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and smoking
did not account for the excess risks associated with a history
of marital loss. We suspect that the acute and chronic stress
associated with marital loss(es) may have played an important
role in our findings—particularly as it related to widowhood in
older ages.41–43 Indeed, recent studies have identified
possible biological mechanisms (eg, blood pressure reactivity,
elevated cortisol, and hemoglobin A1c) related to the stress of
marital loss that warrant additional investigation as they
relate to increased risk for mortality after a stroke.34,43,44
Relatedly, we also suspect that a history of marital dissolution
may have had negative consequences on one’s medication

 adherence, healthcare utilization, and other behaviors for
disease management that may have accelerated their health
decline.5,6,38 Accordingly, studies have shown that spouses
encourage concordant health behaviors—such as proper diet,
exercise, and medication compliance—that promote cardio-
vascular health and prolong survival.18,45,46 Therefore, we
encourage future studies to explore these mechanisms to
help better explain how repeated exposure to marital loss is
associated with increasing risks for mortality following a
stroke.
Study Limitations
The results of this study are not without limitations. First, we
recognize that the analyses are based on self-reported
diagnoses of strokes that were not formally adjudicated.
Although studies have shown consistency between diagnostic
reports of strokes from survey respondents and those from
medical evaluations, we acknowledge that the HRS may have
unreported cases of stroke that were not included in the
study.26,47,48 Therefore, future studies may be warranted to
validate these findings with formal clinical events classifica-
tion. Second, and relatedly, the study was limited to adults
who survive to hospital discharge, and we cannot rule out
potential selection bias related to those who died shortly after
experiencing a stroke. Likewise, it is possible that selection
played a role in the likelihood of entering/exiting marriage, as
well as contributing to underlying risks for mortality in adults
who experienced a stroke. Third, although the data were rich
in the number and breadth of measured covariates, it is
possible that additional unmeasured factors may have
contributed to the findings. For example, direct measures
were not available for the severity or type of stroke, the
treatment/control of hypertension and diabetes, or other
clinical factors (eg, rehabilitation) that are associated with
survival after an acute cerebrovascular event. We also could
not identify the duration or quality of past marriages or the
circumstances of marital loss. Likewise, we lacked direct
measures of stress and anxiety that follow a stroke—and
marital loss—which may have contributed to the associa-
tions. Finally, this is an observational study based on a
selective subsample of HRS respondents (stroke survivors)
and we recognize that the results do not indicate causality
and may not be generalizable to other populations.
Conclusions
The results from this observational study provide new
evidence that has the potential to inform health policy and
practice. Although marital events are not amenable to medical
intervention or treatment, knowledge about the risks associ-
ated with marital life may be useful for personalizing care and

 improving prognoses for those who experience a stroke.
Greater recognition and understanding of these associations
may enable healthcare providers to better identify and treat
older adults with illness who are at potentially high risk of
dying, as well as provide older adults a greater awareness of
the risks associated with their marital status and background.
Future studies are needed to further examine the mechanisms
contributing to these associations and to assess how such
information can be used to aggressively treat vulnerable
segments of the population.
