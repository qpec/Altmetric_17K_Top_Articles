The high global burden of over one million annual lethal fungal infections reflects a lack of
protective vaccines, late diagnosis and inadequate chemotherapy. Here, we have generated a
unique set of fully human anti-Candida monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with diagnostic and
therapeutic potential by expressing recombinant antibodies from genes cloned from the B
cells of patients suffering from candidiasis. Single class switched memory B cells isolated
from donors serum-positive for anti-Candida IgG were differentiated in vitro and screened
against recombinant Candida albicans Hyr1 cell wall protein and whole fungal cell wall pre-
parations. Antibody genes from Candida-reactive B cell cultures were cloned and expressed in
Expi293F human embryonic kidney cells to generate a panel of human recombinant anti-
Candida mAbs that demonstrate morphology-specific, high avidity binding to the cell wall.
The species-specific and pan-Candida mAbs generated through this technology display
favourable properties for diagnostics, strong opsono-phagocytic activity of macrophages
in vitro, and protection in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis.

ungi cause approximately 1.5 million lethal infections each
year—as many as tuberculosis or HIV, and more than
malaria or breast or prostate cancer1. Of these fungal dis-
eases, Candida species collectively account for the majority of
serious fungal infections and represent the fourth leading cause of
healthcare-associated infections in the United States1,2. Candida
albicans is the most commonly isolated species and represents the
most
prevalent
fungal
opportunistic
pathogen
worldwide3.
Impairment of host immunity, due to trauma, pharmacological or
surgical intervention, or alteration in the natural microbiota,
determines the frequency and severity of disease4. Late diagnosis
of invasive candidiasis using ‘gold standard’ blood culture
methodologies along with limitations in the versatility, accuracy
and widespread availability of inexpensive and rapid diagnostic
tests contribute to the poor prognosis and high mortality rates
associated with septicaemia and invasive fungal disease5–7. To
make inroads into these high disease burdens and mortality fig-
ures, better diagnostics, antifungal drugs, immunotherapies and
fungal vaccines are urgently required.
Pooled immunoglobulin from serum was one of the first widely
available treatments for microbial infections. For example,
hyperimmune human serum immunoglobulin has been used to
treat a number of infections including cytomegalovirus, hepatitis
A and B virus rabies and measles8–10. In recent years, monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) have become some of the world’s bestselling
drugs, with global sales forecast to reach approximately $125
billion by 202011. To date, the majority of these mAbs have been
licensed
for
the
treatment
of
cancer
and
autoimmune
diseases12,13, but the revolution in applied mAb research has yet
to be focussed on mycotic infections. There is currently only one
mAb approved for the treatment of an infectious disease (Synagis;
respiratory syncytial virus)14. Advances have been made in recent
years to generate mAbs to viral and bacterial targets and
antibody–antibiotic conjugates have also been explored as novel
therapeutics against intracellular bacterial pathogens15–18. Pro-
tective mAbs for clinically relevant fungi have now been reported
but these are almost exclusively murine in origin, and generated
via hybridoma technology10,19–24. Fully human antibodies would
represent highly valuable reagents to explore future immu-
notherapies targeting medical mycoses.
Increased mAb research in the field of mycotic disease has also
led to progress in mAb-based diagnostics including the Asper-
gillus-specific mAb JF5 for the detection of invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis, a Candida albicans germ tube mAb (CAGTA) for
deep-seated Candida infection and a new cryptococcal antigen
dipstick test25–27. Assays detecting the pan-fungal marker β-
glucan have been a valuable addition to the armamentarium, but
for Candida-specific diagnosis, the application of MALDI-TOF
MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation–time-of-flight
mass spectrometry) and the introduction of the T2Candida panel
test utilising miniaturised magnetic resonance technology to
identify
clinically
relevant
species
of
Candida
have
been
important28,29. However, inexpensive, sensitive and specific
point-of-care diagnostics that can accurately detect the major
human fungal pathogens are urgently required to inform ther-
apeutic strategies.
There are currently no vaccines for the prevention of fungal
infection in the clinic, although experimental vaccines based on
fungal cell wall targets are in development30–32. NDV-3, a vaccine
based on a recombinant fragment of the Als3 cell wall adhesin,
has now completed Phase II clinical trials where it demonstrated
safety and a reduction in the frequency of symptomatic episodes
in women suffering from recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis33–36.
This vaccine also demonstrates cross-kingdom protection against
Staphylococcus aureus due to structural homology of Als3 with
surface adhesin/invasin molecules of S. aureus37. A pre-clinical
Candida-specific vaccine based on the recombinant N-terminal
fragment of C. albicans Hyr1 protein demonstrated efficacy in a
murine model of disseminated candidiasis, and more recently
cross-kingdom protection against the bacterial pathogen Acine-
tobacter baumannii through structural homology to cell A. bau-
mannii surface proteins38–40. These experimental vaccines are
based on neutralising and/or protective antibodies that may be
deployed in prophylactic or pre-emptive therapies.
Methods and approaches for the production of mAbs for
diagnostic and/or therapeutic use have diversified dramatically in
recent years. Early mAbs were mainly of murine origin but were
immunogenic in the human host41,42. Today, the majority of
mAbs used clinically are chimeric, humanised or fully human
IgG1 mAbs generated through hybridoma cell lines12. Combi-
natorial display technologies using phage or yeast have also been
valuable in generating fully human mAbs43,44 but these often
require a period of in vitro affinity maturation and produce mAbs
with randomised heavy and light chain pairings. Recently,
retention of native VH and VL pairings through direct amplifi-
cation of individual VH and VL chain domain genes from in vitro
expanded single human B cells has led to the generation of fully
human mAbs with increased safety, immunotolerance, efficacy
and relevance to human disease in areas where current treatments
are suboptimal45–48.
In the present study we address the urgent requirement for
improved diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for fungal infec-
tion, by generating bespoke recombinant human antibodies from
single human B cells. Human antibody encoding variable domain
(V) genes targeting Candida epitopes were cloned from single B
cells derived from donors who had recovered from mucosal
Candida infections to generate a panel of fully human recombi-
nant IgG1 mAbs that display a range of specific binding profiles
to pathogenic Candida species. The mAbs demonstrate opsono-
phagocytic activity in vitro against C. albicans and the emerging
multidrug-resistant pathogen Candida auris, and therapeutic
efficacy in vivo in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis.
They are also effective in a number of diagnostic formats in
recognising Candida antigens. This highlights the translational
value of this technology for developing fungal diagnostics and
therapeutics, and exploring anti-Candida vaccine development.
Results
Fully human recombinant anti-Candida mAbs derived from
single B cells. Fully human recombinant mAbs were generated by
direct amplification of VH and VL genes from single B cells in
which the native antibody heavy and light chain pairing remain
intact, thus preserving the original target specificity and disease
relevance45 (Fig. 1). Through screening of in vitro activated class
switch memory (CSM) B-cell repertoires, mAbs were isolated that
recognised a recombinant C. albicans-specific protein antigen—
the hyphal cell wall protein Hyr149, or C. albicans whole cell wall
preparations. Hyr1 was selected following pre-clinical data that a
recombinant N-terminal Hyr1 fragment conferred protection in a
murine model of disseminated candidiasis38,39. Whole cell wall
preparations were used to generate mAbs to a variety of antigens
with a range of reactivities and clinical uses.
To enhance the likelihood of isolating Candida-specific
antibodies, CSM B cells were isolated from the blood of
individuals who had recovered from a superficial Candida
infection (mostly vaginitis) within a year of sampling. Donors
were selected from a panel of volunteers and the levels of target-
specific circulating IgG in the donor plasma was assessed via
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the screen, the
donors displaying the greatest IgG activity against Hyr1 (donor
23) and C. albicans whole cells (donor 85) (Fig. 2a–c) were used

nated by ELISA screening against two unrelated proteins—

amplification via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and nested PCR (representative images shown in
Supplementary Figures 3a, b). VH, Vκ-Cκ and Vλ-Cλ genes were
subcloned into a mammalian expression vector and correspond-
ing heavy and light chains originating from the same hit well were
co-transfected into Expi293F cells for small-scale recombinant
whole IgG1 expression. Recombinant mAbs that demonstrated
binding to the original target were selected for large-scale
expression and then purified via affinity-based fast protein liquid
chromatography (FPLC) using a protein A resin before quality
control (QC) checking via analytical mass spectrometry, analy-
tical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sodium dodecyl
sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel
analysis under non-reducing and reducing conditions (represen-
tative images shown in Supplementary Figures 3 c-f respectively).
In total, 17 purified recombinant IgG1 mAbs were generated. Five
of these bound to purified Hyr1 protein and were split into four
clusters defined by their VH CDR3 amino acid sequence. The
remaining 12 mAbs bound to C. albicans whole cells and were
split into 7 clusters based on their VH CDR3 amino acid
sequences (Supplementary Table 6).

mAbs
AB120,
AB121, AB122 and AB123 demonstrated strong binding to pur-
ified recombinant Hyr1 with half-maximal effective concentration
(EC50) values between 50 and 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2d). AB124 bound
to Hyr1 with lower affinity with an EC50 value of 1050 ng/ml. No
binding to HSA and HEK nuclear antigen was observed (Sup-
plementary Figure 4a and 4b). The majority of purified anti-
whole cell mAbs bound C. albicans yeast cells with high affinity
with EC50 values between 3 and 30 ng/ml (Fig. 2e, f). AB134 and
AB135, which share high amino acid sequence homology,
demonstrated a lower degree of binding with EC50 values of 1060
and 220 ng/ml respectively to yeast cells and 684 and 69 ng/ml to
hyphal cells (Fig. 2f). Binding avidity for most antibodies
screened against yeast and hyphal cell walls was C. albicans
morphology dependent (Fig. 2g, h). EC50 values were used here to
demonstrate the variability in anti-whole cell mAbs binding to C.
albicans cell surface antigens. As before, no binding of anti-whole
cell mAbs to HSA or HEK nuclear antigen was observed, con-
firming that their specificity for fungal cells was retained
throughout the cloning process (Supplementary Figure 4c-f).
Therefore, this methodology generated a panel of mAbs which
bound to a variety of fungal-specific cell targets.
mAbs bind to C. albicans cell surface antigens. Anti-Hyr1 mAbs
were used to stain the C. albicans cell surface by indirect
immunostaining. The anti-Hyr1 mAbs bound only to hyphae,
and not the parental yeast cells of germ tubes (Fig. 3a). Anti-Hyr1
mAbs did not bind to hyphae of a hyr1Δ/hyr1Δ null mutant and
binding was restored in a mutant that was transformed with a
single reintegrated copy of HYR1 (Fig. 3a). These antibodies did
not stain hyphae of C. dubliniensis—a closely related species to C.
albicans that lacks the HYR1 gene.
Immunofluorescent and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM)-immunogold staining using anti-whole cell mAbs demon-
strated specific and distinct binding patterns to C. albicans cells
(Fig. 3b). AB126 and AB131 bound both yeast and hyphae but
exhibited very little binding to the mother yeast cells. AB127
bound to mother yeast cells and hyphal apices, but not to the
trunk of growing hyphae. AB118, AB119, AB140 and AB135
bound to antigens widely expressed on both C. albicans yeast and
hyphae. Therefore, collectively the panel of mAbs detected a
range of both morphology-specific and morphology-independent
epitopes located in the inner cell wall.

 zymolyase 20T and then assessed for mAb binding. Following
endo-H and α-mannosidase treatment, binding of AB119 was
decreased, suggesting that the target epitope for this mAb
contains a core N-mannan structure but not outer chain manno-
oligosaccharides (Supplementary Figure 5a). Binding of AB135
was reduced following treatment of cells with zymolyase 20T,
suggesting that this mAb targets a Candida-specific β-glucan-
associated epitope (Supplementary Figure 5b). Proteinase K
treatment reduced binding of AB120 (anti-Hyr1) but not
anti-whole cell mAbs to C. albicans, confirming that AB120
recognises a protein or proteoglycan epitope (Supplementary
Figure 5c). Some anti-whole cell mAbs demonstrated increased
fluorescence after enzymatic treatment, suggesting that their
epitopes might be located deeper in the cell wall.
No cross-reactivity to other fungal, bacterial, plant or mam-
malian glycans. The mAb with the lowest EC50 value from each

 major clonal cluster was chosen as a representative for further
screening against polysaccharides and glycoproteins that contain
oligosaccharide sequences found in fungal cell walls (Supple-
mentary Table 7) and against mammalian-type N-glycans (Sup-
plementary Table 8) in an immobilised glycan microarray
format53.
Glycan
microarray
studies
were
conducted
in
accordance with the guidelines as published by the MIRAGE
initiative54. A MIRAGE Glycan Microarray Document is included
as a Supplementary Note in Supplementary Information. All anti-
Candida mAbs tested (except the protein-specific anti-Hyr1 mAb
AB121) demonstrated strong binding to C. albicans mannopro-
tein (ID 13 in N-Glycan Array Set 3) and no cross-reactivity to
other fungal-type, bacterial or plant oligosaccharides included in
the array. The mammalian β-glucan receptor dectin-1, which was
included for reference in the analyses, showed the predicted
highly specific binding to fungal β1,3-glucans (Fig. 4a and Sup-
plementary Table 7). Additionally, there was negligible or no
binding to the mammalian-type N-glycans tested (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Table 8). In these analyses the broadly neu-
tralising anti-HIV mAb PGT 128, known to recognise Man9- and
Man8-high-mannose N-glycans55, was used as a reference. The
results further demonstrated the specificity of the anti-Candida
mAbs for Candida-associated polysaccharide epitope(s).
mAbs demonstrate distinct binding profiles to other patho-
genic fungi. When assessing anti-whole cell mAb binding to
yeast cells of other pathogenic Candida species via fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS), AB118, AB119, AB135 and AB140
(representing mAbs from four clonal clusters) bound avidly to the
most closely related Candida species C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,
C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae and the emerging pathogen C.
auris. AB140 also demonstrated specific binding to the more
distantly related C. glabrata. mAbs which bound to epitopes more
highly expressed on C. albicans hyphae such as AB126, AB127
and AB131 (representing three clonal clusters) demonstrated
overall lower levels of binding to the phylogenetically closest
relatives of C. albicans (Figs. 5, 6). Interestingly, AB131 also
demonstrated low levels of binding to C. krusei and Sacchar-
omyces cerevisiae (Figs. 5, 6). Immunofluorescent imaging was
carried out to assess patterns of mAb binding in hypha-inducing
conditions. Here, AB126, AB127 and AB131 demonstrated
increased levels of binding to most species and in particular C.
albicans,
commensurate
with
the
predominantly
hyphal-
associated expression of their target epitopes (Fig. 7b). To
assess for pan-fungal binding activity, anti-whole cell mAbs were
tested against species from the other three major human fungal
pathogens—Aspergillus
fumigatus,
Cryptococcus
neoformans,
Cryptococcus gattii and Pneumocystis carinii. No binding to any
of these species was observed (Fig. 7b).
Commensurate with the C. albicans-specific nature of HYR1,
anti-Hyr1 mAbs bound only to C. albicans hyphae and not to C.
albicans yeast cells or any of the other Candida species tested
including C. dubliniensis which lacks the HYR1 gene (Figs. 5, 6,
7a). Therefore, the anti-Hyr1 mAbs were C. albicans specific and
the majority of anti-whole cell mAbs demonstrated a variety of
binding patterns to wild-type C. albicans and other pathogenic
Candida species, but not to more distantly related fungal
pathogens, indicating that they target a range of Candida-

 specific antigens whose expression levels varies from species to
species.
mAb binding promotes FcγR-dependent phagocytosis by
macrophages. The possible opsonising effect of anti-Candida
mAbs on phagocytosis was examined by live cell imaging using
J774.1 mouse macrophages (European Collection of Cell Cultures
(ECACC)). Macrophages were challenged with live, C. albicans
CAI4-CIp10 which had been pre-incubated with an anti-Candida
mAb, an IgG1 control mAb or saline for 1 h. C. albicans cells that
had been pre-incubated with AB119 or AB140 (anti-whole cell
mAbs) were cleared significantly more rapidly compared to saline
and AB120 or IgG1-treated controls (Fig. 8a). The antibodies
therefore strongly influenced macrophage behaviour enabling
highly efficient targeting of fungal cells (see Supplementary
Movies 1–7). We compared differences in the rate of engulfment
of C. albicans pre-incubated with selected anti-Candida mAbs
with isotype controls, defining engulfment as the time taken from
the establishment of fungus–phagocyte contact to the time for
complete engulfment indicated by loss of fluorescein iso-
thiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence (Fig. 8b). Anti-whole cell mAb-
bound fungal cells were engulfed significantly faster compared to
saline controls and the IgG1 control mAb (Fig. 8c; Supplementary
Movies 1–7). C. albicans yeast cells pre-incubated with the hypha-
specific mAb AB120 were engulfed at a slower rate compared to
cells coated with an anti-whole cell mAb but considerably faster
than the IgG1 control (Fig. 8c). To examine the effect of AB120
on a hypha-only cell population, AB120 was pre-incubated with
filamentous C. albicans cells before addition to macrophages.
Here, AB120 stimulated significantly faster macrophage engulf-
ment of C. albicans hyphal cells compared to the saline control
(Fig. 8d; Supplementary Movies 6, 7). Binding of the antibodies
therefore strongly induced phagocytosis of C. albicans by murine
J774.1 macrophages. Killing of C. albicans cells by J774.1 mac-
rophages was unaffected by antibody pre-incubation under these
conditions. Similar observations were obtained using human
monocyte-derived
macrophages
(Supplementary
Figure
7).
Blocking Fcγ receptors (FcγR) decreased the rate of engulfment of
AB140-bound C. albicans to a similar level as that of the saline
control (Fig. 8e). indicating that the mAb-dependent stimulation
of engulfment was FcγR dependent.
Macrophages travelled faster and further towards C. albicans
yeast cells when pre-incubated with an anti-whole cell mAb
(AB140) (Fig. 8f, g) and exhibited more directional movement
towards antibody-bound C. albicans cells compared to control
(Fig. 8h–j). The opsonising effect of anti-whole mAbs on C.
albicans phagocytosis was also observed with the multidrug-
resistant pathogen C. auris, where AB119 induced noticeable
clearance of fungal cells by 10 min and almost complete
clearance of cells by 30 min (Fig. 9; Supplementary movies 8
and 9). This correlated with the high level of binding of AB119
to C. auris observed by immunofluorescence imaging and
FACS.
mAb reduces fungal burden in disseminated candidiasis
model. We assessed therapeutic potential of the anti-Candida
mAbs in two murine models of systemic candidiasis56. The first
model was designed to test whether mAb efficacy observed in
phagocytosis assays in vitro translated into protection in an
in vivo model. In this model, C. albicans SC5314 yeast cells were
pre-incubated for 1 h with either saline, an IgG1 isotype control
mAb, AB119 or AB120 before intravenous injection into the
mouse lateral tail vein. Disease progression was monitored by
weight change and kidney fungal burdens at day 356. When pre-
incubated with Hyr1-specific mAb AB120, there was no decrease
in fungal burden compared to the saline control or the IgG1
control mAb (Fig. 10a). When the anti-whole cell mAb AB119
was pre-incubated with SC5314 yeast cells, there was also a sig-
nificant decrease in kidney fungal burden compared to the saline
control (Fig. 10a). Burden results were reflected in mouse body

 mAb detection of C. albicans antigens in diagnostic assay
format. Selected mAbs were assessed for compatibility in a
counterimmunoelectrophoresis diagnostic assay which is com-
monly employed to diagnose patients with Candida infection.
AB118, AB119 and AB140 reacted with C. albicans yeast anti-
genic preparations to generate strong precipitin lines (Fig. 10c).
When assessed for reactivity to C. albicans hyphal antigenic
preparations, AB135 gave a positive result through the formation
of a clear precipitin line and mAbs AB118, AB119 and AB140
formed weak precipitin lines (Fig. 10d). Together, these data
indicate that these mAbs possess potential utility as Candida
diagnostic agents.
Discussion
Monoclonal antibodies or oligoclonal mixtures of mAbs have
unexplored potential in antifungal therapy and disease manage-
ment. Antibody-based agents have been identified as an alter-
native strategy to complement the medical gaps associated with
current antifungal diagnostics and treatments9,57. We describe
the first isolation of fully human anti-Candida mAbs using novel
single B-cell antibody isolation methodology. These mAbs,
derived from single B cells from donors with a history of mucosal
Candida infection, demonstrated fungal-specific binding profiles
to C. albicans and other pathogenic Candida species and the
ability to opsonise fungal cells, thereby enhancing phagocytosis

 and exhibiting protection in a murine model of disseminated
candidiasis. The antibodies also exhibited potential in the gen-
eration of Candida diagnostic assays.
We generated 17 fully human recombinant anti-Candida
mAbs through the direct cloning of VH and VL antibody genes
encoded by memory B cells and elicited naturally in vivo in
response to a Candida infection. This technology circumvents the
considerable expense of humanising antibodies isolated from
rodents or other sources. Furthermore, the recombinant affinity
matured human mAbs generated are less likely to be immuno-
genic and, importantly, their native antibody heavy and light
chain natural pairings remain intact, thus preserving their origi-
nal epitope specificity as presented during the course of disease
and their biochemical properties48. IgG1 was selected as the
scaffold of choice because it is the most common isotype of
therapeutic antibodies in the clinic and is the best characterised in
terms of drug development12,58,59.
Twelve of the mAbs generated bound to C. albicans whole cell
and 5 bound to recombinant purified Hyr1 protein—a protein
that is important for C. albicans resistance to phagocytosis and is
currently in development as an experimental vaccine38,39. Anti-
bodies with species-specific and pan-species activity both have
translational potential as diagnostics and therapeutics6,7. There-
fore, we validated that both highly specific and cross-reactive
antibodies can be generated using the same methodology. The
anti-Hyr1 mAbs bound only to C. albicans hyphae. Most of the
anti-whole cell mAbs bound to the closely related pathogens C.
dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. auris. There was
less or no binding to the more evolutionarily distant species C.
glabrata and C. krusei. When assessed in a routinely employed
diagnostic assay, these mAbs were able to react with Candida
antigenic preparations. Therefore, the novel technology employed
here can be utilised to generate species-specific and/or pan-
Candida mAbs with considerable potential in antifungal drug
discovery and diagnostics.
Many therapeutic mAbs exert their protective effects through
opsonising cells for phagocytosis60. We observed that C. albicans
yeast and hyphal cells treated with anti-whole cell mAbs or anti-
Hyr1 mAbs were phagocytosed more quickly compared to non-
opsonised cells, and that this was FcγR dependent. Furthermore,
macrophages migrated further, faster and more directionally
towards opsonised C. albicans cells and this contributed to the
rapid clearance of fungal cells. Our antibodies could also promote
C. auris phagocytosis, demonstrating the potential of these mAbs
in targeting difficult-to-treat drug-resistant pathogens. Opsono-
phagocytic activity was reflected in the observed protective effect
of selected antibodies in a 3-day murine model of systemic
infection. Humanised or fully human IgG1 mAbs make up the
majority of antibody therapeutics used clinically and the IgG1
isotype has been routinely tested pre-clinically in murine models
of disease. Human IgG1 also binds to all activating mFcγRs with a
similar profile to the most potent IgG isotype in mice, mIgG2a,
validating the use of mouse models to assess Fc-mediated effects
of hIgG1 mAbs58. We utilised a 3-day mouse model of dis-
seminated candidiasis56 to assess the efficacy of anti-Candida
mAbs in vivo and observed a significant decrease in kidney fungal
burden when C. albicans was pre-incubated with an anti-whole
cell mAb. We then established that the same anti-whole cell mAb
demonstrated protection in a clinically relevant 7-day prophy-
lactic treatment model of disseminated candidiasis.
This study describes the first generation of fully human mAbs
to a fungal pathogen cloned from genes from single B cells. These
mAbs included those with specific pan-Candida and species-
specific properties that have utility in the antifungal diagnostic
and therapeutic sectors. We used C. albicans as the screening
target but this technology has broad potential in a wide range of
other clinical and biological contexts. The characteristics of the
mAbs are suitable for use singly or in multiplex formats to create
novel polyvalent diagnostic tests. As therapeutics they could be
used to direct the immune system to destroy fungal pathogens in
a similar approach to cancer immunotherapy, or by targeting
toxic molecules to specific microbial or cellular targets. They also
have potential in exploring novel antifungal vaccines through the
identification of protective antigens.

 Fungal strains and growth conditions. C. albicans serotype A strain CAI4+CIp10
(NGY152) was used as the C. albicans control and source of antigen and its parent
strain CAI4 was used to construct the hyr1Δ/ hyr1Δ homozygous null mutant C.
albicans strain. Other mutants used in phenotypic characterisations were all
derived from the CAI4 background49,61,62. The CaHYR1 gene was transformed
into RPS1 locus of the hyr1Δ/hyr1Δ null mutant under the regulation of the
CaACT1 promoter to create a hyr1Δ/hyr1Δ/HYR1 reintegrant heterozygous control
strain. Clinical isolates of fungal species used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

 were grown in YPD (see above without the technical agar) except to prepare the
inoculum for in vivo experiments where strains were grown in NGY medium (0.1%
(w/v) Neopeptone (BD Biosciences), 0.4% (w/v) glucose (Fisher Scientific) and
0.1% (w/v) yeast extract (Oxoid). Aspergillus fumigatus clinical isolate V05–27 was
cultured on Potato Dextrose Agar slants for 7 days before the spores were harvested
by gentle shaking with sterile 0.1% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Harvested spores were purified, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 1 ×
108 spores/ml. Swollen spores were generated by incubation in RPMI media for 4 h
at 37 °C. Cryptococcus neoformans KN99α and Cryptococcus gattii R265 were
grown in YPD overnight, washed in PBS and 1 × 107 cells were added to 6 ml RPMI
+10% foetal calf serum (FCS) in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C+5%
CO2 for 5 days to induce capsule formation. Harvested cells were washed in PBS.
Rat lung tissue isolates of Pneumocystis carinii M167–6 were washed in PBS and
immunostained.
Generation of recombinant Hyr1 N-terminus fragment protein. A recombinant
N-terminal fragment of C. albicans Hyr1 (amino acids 63 to 350, Supplementary
Figure 1a) incorporating an N-terminal 6xHis tag was expressed in HEK293F cells
and purified by nickel-based affinity chromatography using a NTA superflow
column (QIAGEN, USA). Fractions containing recombinant Hyr1 were pooled and
further purified via Analytical Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (GE
Healthcare, USA) in PBS. QC of the recombinant protein via SDS-PAGE gel
analysis and analytical SEC confirmed a protein of a predicted mass of 32 kDa
(Supplementary Figure 1b, c).
PBMC isolation and purification of circulating IgG from donor plasma. EDTA-
containing peripheral venous blood was collected from individuals who had
recovered from a Candida infection within the last year. Separation of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma from whole blood was carried out
via density gradient separation using Accuspin System-Histopaque-1077 kits
(Sigma-Aldrich). PBMCs were washed three times in PBS, resuspended at a con-
centration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in R10 media (RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Life Technologies),
10% FCS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, Life Technol-
ogies), 4 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma)) containing
additional 10% FCS and 10% dimethyl sulphoxide before storing in liquid nitrogen.
IgG was purified from donor plasma using VivaPure MaxiPrepG Spin columns
(Sartorius Stedman). Concentration of eluted IgG was measured by absorbance at
280 nm.
Circulating antigen-specific IgG titres. Circulating IgG was screened against
target antigens via ELISA to identify donors for subsequent CSM B-cell isolation
and activation. NUNC 384-well Maxisorp microtitre plates (Sigma-Aldrich) were
coated with extracted C. albicans cell walls or C. albicans overnight culture (whole
cell) or 1 µg/ml recombinant Hyr1 protein antigen in PBS. Following incubation at
4 °C overnight, wells were washed three times with PBS+0.05% Tween and then
blocked with PBS+0.05% Tween+0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at
room temperature. After three washes, titrated purified IgG or IVIG in block buffer
was added in duplicate, and plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Wells were washed three times before addition of goat anti-human IgG, horse-
radish peroxidase conjugated (Thermo Scientific # 31413) secondary antibody at
1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer. Following incubation for 45 min at room
temperature, wells were washed and stained using tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
(Thermo Scientific). Plates were incubated for 5 min before addition of 0.18 M
sulphuric acid and then read at an absorbance of 450 nm. Labstats software in
Microsoft Excel was used to generate concentration-response curves for EC50
determination and donor selection for subsequent CSM B-cell isolation and
activation.
Isolation and activation of CSM B cells. Approximately 5 × 107 PBMCs were
thawed and diluted 1:10 in pre-warmed R10 medium and treated with benzonase
nuclease HC, purity >99% (Novagen) at 1:10,000. PBMCs were washed twice in
PBS before final resuspension in pre-warmed R10 medium. CSM B cells were
isolated from PBMCs by depletion of non-target cells using a Switched Memory B
cell isolation kit with Pre-Separation Filters and LS columns on a MACS Separator
(MACS Miltenyi Biotec). To activate CSM B cells and promote antibody secretion,
R10 medium was supplemented with a cocktail of antibodies and cytokines to
make complete R10 medium. CSM B cells were resuspended in complete R10
medium at 56 cells/ml and then plated out in 90 μl aliquots (5 cells/well) in
ThermoFisher Matrix 384-well plates using a Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter). Cells
were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 7 days. On day 7, 30 μl/well of supernatant
was replaced with 30 μl fresh complete R10. On day 13, all supernatants were
harvested and screened against recombinant N-terminus Hyr1 protein antigen, C.
albicans extracted cell walls or C. albicans whole cells from overnight cultures by
ELISA. B-cell activation and culturing was monitored by measuring IgG1 con-
centrations in B-cell supernatants at day 7 and day 13.
Screening of IgG in B-cell supernatant against target antigens via ELISA. The
same ELISA protocol was employed for the screening of B-cell supernatants against
target antigens with the exception that neat B-cell supernatant was added in the
place of titrated purified IgG or IVIG. Positive hits were defined as wells with an
OD450 reading >4× background. B cells in ‘positive hit’ wells were lysed in buffer
(1 ml DEPC-treated H2O (Life Technologies), 10 µl 1 M Tris pH 8, 25 µl RNAsin
Plus RNAse Inhibitor (Promega)) and stored at –80 °C.
cDNA synthesis and PCR1. A schematic of the cloning protocol is shown in
Supplementary Figure 2. Primers used for the RT-PCR reaction were based on
those used by Smith et al.46 and are listed in Supplementary Tables 2–5. To ensure
all possible VH germline families were captured during the amplification, four
forward primers specific to the leader sequences encompassing the different human
VH germline families (VH1–7) were used in combination with two reverse primers
—both in the human IgCH1 region. For the RT-PCR of human Vκ-Cκ genes, three
forward primers specific to the leader sequences for the different human Vκ
germline families (Vκ1–4) were used with a reverse primer specific to the human
kappa constant region (Cκ) and two further reverse primers which were specific to
the C- and N-terminal ends of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR). To capture the
repertoire of human Vλ genes, seven forward primers capturing the leader
sequences for the different human Vλ germline families (Vλ1–8) were used with
two reverse primers complementary to the C- and N-terminal ends of the 3’ UTR
along with another reverse primer specific to the human lambda constant region
(Cλ). Amplification of the variable domain of human Ig heavy chain genes (VH),
the variable and constant domains of human Ig kappa light chain genes (Vκ-Cκ)
and the variable and constant domains of human Ig lambda light chain genes (Vλ-
Cλ) was performed in separate reactions.
Prior to complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, B-cell lysates were thawed and
diluted 1:5, 1:15 and 1:25 in nuclease-free H2O (Life Technologies) before addition
of oligo-dT20 (50 µM) (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and incubation at 70 °C for
5 min.
Reverse transcription and the first PCR reaction (RT-PCR) were performed
sequentially in 96-well PCR plates using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR kit,
with gene-specific forward and reverse primer mixes (10 µM) and neat or diluted
(1:5, 1:15, 1:25) B-cell lysate as the template.
Amplification of VH, Vκ-Cκ and Vλ-Cλ genes: nested PCR reaction. Primers
used for the nested PCR reaction were again based on those used by Smith et al.46.
A total of 27 forward primers specific for the VH framework 1 (FW1) sequence
were used together with two reverse primers specific for the framework 4 (FW4)

 region of the VH gene. For nested PCR of the Vκ-Cκ gene, a mixture of 18 forward
primers specific for human Vκ FW1 sequence were used with a reverse primer
specific to the human kappa constant region 3’ end. For amplification of the Vλ-Cλ
gene, a mixture of 31 forward primers specific for human Vλ FW1 sequences were
used together with a reverse primer that was placed at the 3’ end of the human
lambda constant region. All of these primers contained 15 bp extensions which
were complementary to the target downstream pTT5 expression vector. Nested
PCR reactions were carried out using Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies), nested gene-specific forward (10 µM) and reverse
(10 µM) primer mixes and cDNA template from the RT-PCR reaction. PCR
amplifications of VH genes, Vκ-Cκ genes and Vλ-Cλ genes were carried out in
separate reactions and then stored on ice. After the nested PCR reaction, samples
were analysed via agarose gel electrophoresis and positive hits identified and taken
forward for downstream In-Fusion cloning with pTT5 mammalian expression
vector.
pTT5 mammalian expression vector preparation. pTT5 was the expression
vector used for recombinant mAb expression (licensed from the National Research
Council of Canada (NRCC))63. pTT5 vector plasmid containing an IgG1 heavy
chain gene in the multiple cloning site was linearised by double digestion using
FastDigest Restriction enzymes (Thermo Scientific) in separate reactions to facil-
itate generation of HC and LC backbones for subsequent cloning of VH and Vκ-Cκ
or Vλ-Cλ genes. HC and LC backbone DNA was run on a 1% agarose gel and
bands were excised from the gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit
(QIAGEN). DNA was quantified on a NanoVue Plus Spectrophotometer (GE
Healthcare). The 3’- and 5’-termini of the linearised plasmids were depho-
sphorylated using FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline phosphatase (Thermo Scien-
tific) to prevent vector self-ligation. Reaction mixtures were cleaned using the
MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) and then run on 1% agarose gels.
Bands corresponding to dephosphorylated HC and LC backbones were excised
from the gel and purified using the QIAQuick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) as
above. Dephosphorylated linearised vector DNA was quantified on a NanoVue
Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare).
In-Fusion cloning. The In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech, USA) was used to
clone the VH, Vκ-Cκ and Vλ-Cλ genes into the pTT5 mammalian expression
vector before transformation of Stellar Competent cells in a 96-well plate format
(Clontech). Transformed cells were recovered in SOC medium (Clontech) with
shaking at 37 °C for 45–60 min before plating out onto LB agar plates (1% (w/v)
tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NaCl, 1.5% (w/v) agar) containing 100
µg/ml ampicillin. Single colonies picked for inoculation of 2xTY media containing
100 µg/ml ampicillin in a Greiner deep well, 96-well plate (Sigma). Plasmid
miniprep DNA was isolated from cultures in 96-well microtitre plates and an
epMotion® 5075 laboratory robot (Eppendorf, Germany) and stored at –20 °C until
required for mammalian transfections following sequence analysis of com-
plementary determining region (CDR) diversity and comparison to germline
sequences.
Small- and large-scale expression of recombinant mAbs. A file containing all
possible VH and Vκ/Vλ combinations resulting from the original hit wells from the
primary ELISA screen was generated. Automated mixing of native HC and LC
DNA pairing combinations (1.5 µg of HC plasmid DNA and 1.5 µg of LC plasmid
DNA) was facilitated using a Hamilton Microlab® Starline liquid handling platform
(Life Science robotics, Hamilton Robotics). Transient transfections of 3 ml of
cultured Expi293F HEK cells (Gibco, USA) was at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in
24-well tissue culture plates using the Expifectamine 293 Transfection kit (Life
Technologies, USA). Expi293F cells were maintained in sterile Expi293 expression
media (Invitrogen) without antibiotics at 37 °C, with 7% CO2, 120 rpm shaking.
For downstream large-scale transfections, DNA was prepared using a QIAGEN
Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, USA) with typical yields of 1.5 µg/µl. Large-scale
transfections were carried out using 100 µg of total DNA (50 µg of HC plasmid
DNA and 50 µg LC plasmid DNA) and a 100 ml of suspension cultured Expi293F
cells (Life Technologies). Supernatants were harvested on day 6 and recombinant
mAb expression was quantified using anti-human IgG Fc sensors on an Octet QKe
(ForteBio, CA, USA). Following upscaling, recombinant mAb expression was
quantified with an Octet before purification via affinity-based FPLC using HiTrap
Protein A HP columns on an ÄKTA (GE Healthcare). mAbs were eluted in 20 mM
citric acid, 150 nM NaCl (pH 2.5) before neutralisation with 1 M Tris buffer (pH 8)
and then dialysis in PBS overnight. IgG concentration was quantified on a
NanoVue Spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare).
QC of recombinant mAbs. Purified recombinant mAbs were checked via SDS-
PAGE gel analysis using 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels under reducing and non-
reducing conditions, analytical SEC and analytical mass spectrometry. Confirma-
tion of binding to original target antigen was carried out via ELISA using the
protocol described for the circulating antigen-specific IgG screen.
Immunofluorescence imaging of mAbs binding to fungal cells. Single colonies
of Candida were inoculated into 10 ml YPD medium and incubated at 30 °C, 200
rpm overnight. Cultures were diluted 1:1333 in milliQ water and then adhered on a
poly-L-lysine-coated glass slide (Thermo Scientific, Menzel-Gläser) for 30 min. To
induce filamentation, cells were incubated in pre-warmed RPMI+10% FCS at 37 °C
for 90 min to 2 h (this step omitted for staining of yeast cells). For A. fumigatus,
hyphal growth was induced from swollen conidia grown in RPMI+10% FCS. Other

 fungal cells were prepared as described in fungal strains and growth conditions. All
fungal cells were then washed in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed and blocked with 1.5% normal goat
serum (Life Technologies) before staining with an anti-Candida mAb at 1–10 µg/
ml for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were stained
with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-human IgG antibody (Life Technologies #A11013)
at a 1:400 dilution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h prior to imaging in
three dimensions (3D) on an UltraVIEW® VoX spinning disk confocal microscope
(Nikon, Surrey, UK).
High-pressure freezing of C. albicans cell samples. C. albicans yeast and hyphal
cell samples were prepared by high-pressure freezing using an EMPACT2 high-
pressure freezer and rapid transport system (Leica Microsystems Ltd., Milton
Keynes, UK). Using a Leica EMAFS2, cells were freeze-substituted in acetone+1%
(w/v) OsO4 before embedding in Spurr’s resin and polymerising at 60 °C for 48 h.
A Diatome diamond knife on a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome was used to cut
ultrathin sections which were then mounted onto nickel grids.
Immunogold labelling of samples for transmission electron microscopy. Sec-
tions on nickel grids were blocked in blocking buffer (PBS+1% (w/v) BSA and
0.5% (v/v) Tween20) for 20 min before incubation in incubation buffer (PBS+0.1%
(w/v) BSA) for 5 min times 3. Sections were then incubated with anti-Candida
mAb (5 µg/ml) for 90 min before incubation in incubation buffer for 5 min, for a
total of 6 times. mAb binding was detected by incubation with Protein A con-
jugated to 10 nm gold (Aurion) (diluted 1:40 in incubation buffer) for 60 min
before another six, 5 min washes, in incubation buffer, followed by three, 5 min
washes in PBS and three, 5 min washes in water. Sections were then stained with
uranyl acetate for 1 min before three, 2 min washes, in water and left to dry. TEM
images were taken using a JEM-1400 Plus using an AMT UltraVUE camera.
Enzymatic modification of C. albicans cell wall. For proteinase K treatment,
single colonies of Candida were inoculated into 10 ml YPD medium and incubated
at 30 °C, 200 rpm overnight. Cultures were diluted in milliQ water and then
adhered on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides. To induce filamentation, cells were
incubated in pre-warmed RPMI+10% FCS at 37 °C for 90 min to 2 h. Slides were
washed with DPBS and cells were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 1
h. For Endo-H, α(1–2,3.6)-mannosidase from Jack Bean and Zymolyase 20 T
treatments, C. albicans overnight yeast cells were washed and resuspended in
DPBS. Filamentous cells were induced as above. Cells were washed in DPBS and
resuspended in Glycobuffer and Endoglycosidase H (10 U/μl; NEB), 20 mM
sodium acetate with 0.4 mM Zn2+ pH 5 and α-(1–2,3,6)-mannosidase or 20 mM
PIPES with 2 M Sorbitol pH 6.5 and Zymolyase 20T (50 U/g wet cells; MPBIO) at
37 °C for 2 h. Control cells were kept in reaction buffers without enzymes. Cells
were then washed in DPBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed and
blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum (Life Technologies) before staining with an
anti-Candida mAb at 1 µg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with
DPBS, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-human IgG antibody
(Life Technologies) at a 1:400 dilution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h
prior to imaging in 3D on an UltraVIEW® VoX spinning disk confocal microscope
(Nikon, Surrey, UK).
Preparation of human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human macrophages
were derived from monocytes isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers.
PBMCs were resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Lonza, Slough, UK) supplemented with 200 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin anti-
biotics (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
Serum isolated from blood was heat inactivated for 20 min at 56 °C. PBMCs were
seeded at 6 × 105 in 300 µl/well supplemented DMEM containing 10% autologous
human serum, onto an 8-well glass-based imaging dish (Ibidi, Munich, Germany)
and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h 45 min to facilitate monocyte
adherence to the glass surface. Floating lymphocytes in the supernatant were
aspirated and the same volume of fresh pre-warmed supplemented DMEM con-
taining 10% autologous human serum added to the well. Cells were incubated at 37
°C, 5% CO2 for 7 days with media changed on days 3 and 664. Cells were used in
imaging experiments on day 7. Supplemented DMEM was replaced with pre-
warmed supplemented CO2-independent media containing 1 µM LysoTracker Red
DND-99 (Invitrogen) immediately prior to phagocytosis experiments.

 Glycan microarray screening analysis. For microarray screening analysis, two
microarray platforms were used: (1) an array, designated ‘Fungal, Bacterial and
Plant Polysaccharide Array’ featuring 19 saccharides (polysaccharides or glyco-
proteins) derived from fungi, bacteria and plants and one lipid-linked neoglyco-
lipid (NGL) probe derived from the hexasaccharide of β1,4-linked N-
acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (representative of fungal chitin), and (2) an array of
38 sequence-defined NGL probes of N-glycans (majority of mammalian-type)
(Supplementary Table 8) designated ‘N-glycan Array Set 3’, described previously65.
The polysaccharides and glycoprotein antigens included in the Fungal, Bacterial
and Plant Polysaccharide Array are listed in Supplementary Table 7. The glucan
polysaccharides (IDs 1–11) have been described previously66. The mannan from S.
cerevisiae (ID 12) was purchased from Sigma. Purified Candida albicans N-linked
mannoprotein preparation (ID 13)67 was a kind gift from David Williams (East
Tennessee State University); the purified Aspergillus fumigatus mannoprotein
preparation (ID 14)25 was a kind gift from Christopher Thornton (University of
Exeter). The antigen preparations from Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuber-
culosis (IDs 15–18) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resour-
ces) and were described previously68. The glucurono-xylomannan from Tremella
fuciformis (ID 19) was purchased from Elicityl. For construction of the microarrays
the saccharides and the NGL probes were immobilised noncovalently on
nitrocellulose-coated glass slides, following established protocols53,66. Poly-
saccharides and glycoproteins were taken up in water, with the exception of cur-
dlan polysaccharide that was solubilised using mild alkaline solution (50 mM
NaOH) and glucurono-xylomannan solubilised in 150 mM NaCl. The microarrays
were probed with the anti-Candida mAbs, following described protocols53,66. In
brief, after blocking with 10 mM HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5
mM CaCl2 (referred to as HBS) containing 1% w/v BSA (Sigma) and 0.02% v/v
Casein (Pierce), the microarrays were overlaid with the mAbs diluted to a final
concentration of 10 µg/ml (for the Fungal, Bacterial and Plant Polysaccharide
Array) and at 50 µg/ml (for the N-glycan Array Set 3) in the blocking solution.
Binding was detected using biotinylated anti-human IgG (Vector, 5 μg/ml) fol-
lowed by Alexa Fluor-647-labelled streptavidin (Molecular Probes, 1 μg/ml), dilu-
ted in the blocking solution. The mAb PGT 128 was a kind gift of Katie J. Doores
(King’s College London, UK) and was analysed at 50 µg/ml55. Fc-dectin-1 was
kindly provided by Gordon Brown (University of Aberdeen, UK) and was analysed
at 20 µg/ml in the blocking solution 0.5% v/v casein (Pierce) in HBS66. Analyses
were performed at ambient temperature. Microarray data analysis was performed
using dedicated software developed by Mark Stoll of the Glycosciences
Laboratory69.
FACS. Candida and S. cerevisiae colonies were grown in YPD medium and
incubated at 30 °C, 200 rpm overnight. Cells were washed twice in 1× PBS, counted
and then centrifuged and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min. Cells were then
washed twice in 1× PBS to remove residual paraformaldehyde before 2.5 × 106
cells/well were added into V-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates. Anti-Candida
mAb was then added to wells at 1 µg/ml in FACS buffer (1× PBS, 1% FBS, 0.5 mM
EDTA) and incubated for 45 min. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer and
then stained with 5 µg/ml Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-human IgG antibody (Life
Technologies) for 30 min at room temperature. Stained cells were then washed
twice in FACS buffer before final resuspension in FACS buffer and storage in the
dark at 4 °C. Samples were analysed using a BD Fortessa flow cytometer where
10,000 events were acquired for each sample from 3 independent experiments.
Median fluorescence intensity was calculated for each sample using FloJo
v.10 software. The gating strategy employed is shown in Supplementary Figure 6.
Preparation of J774.1 mouse macrophages. J774.1 macrophages (ECACC, HPA,
Salisbury, UK) were maintained in tissue culture flasks in DMEM (Lonza) sup-
plemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Biosera, Ringmer, UK), 200 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) and
incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For phagocytosis assays, macrophages were seeded in
supplemented DMEM at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in an 8-well glass-based
imaging dish (Ibidi) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Immediately prior
to phagocytosis experiments, supplemented DMEM was replaced with pre-warmed
supplemented CO2-independent media (Gibco) containing 1 µM LysoTracker Red
DND-99 (Invitrogen).
Preparation of FITC-stained C. albicans. C. albicans colonies were grown in YPD
medium and incubated at 30 °C, 200 rpm overnight. Live C. albicans cells were
stained for 10 min at room temperature in the dark with 10 mg/ml FITC (Sigma,
Dorset, UK) in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) (BDH Chemicals,
VWR International, Leicestershire, UK). Following 10 min of incubation, in pha-
gocytosis assays using C. albicans FITC-labelled yeast, the cells were washed three
times in 1× PBS to remove any residual FITC and finally resuspended in 1× PBS or
1× PBS containing purified anti-Candida mAb at 1–50 µg/ml. For assays where
filamentous C. albicans cells were added to immune cells, these were washed and
resuspended in supplemented CO2-independent media with or without anti-
Candida mAb at 1–50 µg/ml and incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 45 min.
Live cell video microscopy phagocytosis assays. Phagocytosis assays were
performed using a standard protocol with modifications64,70,71. Following pre-
incubation with/without 50 µg/ml anti-Candida mAb, live FITC-stained wild-type
C. albicans (CA14-CIp10) yeast or hyphal cells were added to LysoTracker Red
DND-99-stained J774.1 murine macrophages in 8-well glass-based imaging dish
(Ibidi) at a multiplicity of infection of 3. For experiments investigating the effect of
a mFcγR blocker on the phagocytosis of C. albicans pre-incubated with 5 µg/ml
anti-Candida whole cell mAb (AB140), J774.1 macrophages were incubated with
10 µg/ml purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 mAb (BD Pharmingen, BD Bios-
ciences #553142) for 5 min at room temperature before addition of C. albicans
cells. Video microscopy was performed using an UltraVIEW® VoX spinning disk
confocal microscope (Nikon) in a 37 °C chamber and images were captured at 1
min intervals over a 3 h period. At least three independent experiments were
performed for each antibody. Twenty-five macrophages were selected at random
from each experiment and analysed individually at 1 min intervals over a 3 h period
using Volocity 6.3 imaging analysis software (Improvision, PerkinElmer, Coventry,
UK). Measurements included C. albicans uptake—defined as the number of C.
albicans cells taken up by an individual phagocyte over the 3 h period—and C.
albicans rate of engulfment—defined as the time point at which cell–cell contact
was established until the time point at which C. albicans was fully engulfed. Finally,
Volocity 6.3 imaging analysis software was used to measure the distance travelled,
directionality and velocity of macrophages at 1 min intervals until the first uptake
event to provide a detailed overview of macrophage migration towards C. albicans
cells. Mean values and standard errors of the mean were calculated. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison tests,
Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test or unpaired, two-tailed
t-tests with Welch’s correction were used to determine statistical significance.
Proof of concept in 3-day systemic candidiasis infection model. A 3-day model
of disseminated candidiasis was employed to assess the efficacy of anti-Candida
mAbs in vivo in immunocompetent 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Envigo,
UK)56. To determine the minimum group size required to detect a statistical dif-
ference in outcomes (P < 0.05), power analyses were carried out using data gen-
erated from other experiments using the same model (power = 0.8). Mice were
randomly assigned to groups (n = 6) and were housed in individually ventilated
cages (IVC), with food and water provided ad libitum. Each cage was randomly
assigned a treatment, and investigators were not blinded when assessing outcome.
Endotoxin levels in the purified recombinant mAb samples were determined with
the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate QCL-1000 test (Lonza) to ensure that endotoxin
was <0.6 EU/ml before in vivo administration. On day 0, ~3.2 × 105 C. albicans
SC5314 yeast cells were pre-incubated with either sterile saline, 1.5 mg/ml purified
IgG1 isotype control mAb, 1.5 mg/ml purified anti-Candida mAb AB119 or 1.5
mg/ml purified anti-Hyr1 mAb AB120 in 700 µl. Following 60 min of incubation at
room temperature, mice were intravenously (i.v.) infected with 100 µl via the lateral
tail vein. This is the equivalent of approximately 1.6 × 104 colony-forming units
(CFUs)/g per mouse, treated with 7.5 mg/kg purified antibody. Mice were mon-
itored and weighed at least once per day from day 0 up to and including day 3. On
day 3, animals were culled by cervical dislocation and the kidneys harvested for
quantitative analysis of fungal burden.
Proof of concept in prophylactic treatment model of systemic candidiasis.
This prophylactic treatment model was conducted by Evotec Ltd (UK). In this
model, 7–8-week-old immunocompetent male CD1 mice (Charles River) were
randomly assigned to groups (n = 10) and housed in IVC, with food and water
provided ad libitum. Mice were injected i.v. via the lateral tail vein with 2.13 × 105
C. albicans SC5314 per mouse in 200 µl. At 4 h prior to challenge, each mouse
received 1 mg of IgG1 control or AB119 antibody by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
in 200 µl. Mice were monitored and weighed at least once per day from day 0 up to
and including day 7. On day 7, animals were killed by administration of pento-
barbitone overdose and the kidneys harvested for quantitative analysis of fungal
burden.
Analysis of disease progression. Kidneys were homogenised and serial dilutions
plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates (1% mycological peptone (w/v), 4%
glucose (w/v), 2% agar (w/v)) and incubated at 35 °C overnight. Fungal burdens
were expressed as log CFUs/g of infected organ. Weight change was measured and
expressed as a percentage of mouse starting weight. Statistical analyses of fungal
burdens were carried out using unpaired two-tailed t-test. An F-test was used to
show there was no statistical significance in variance within the groups (P = 0.1353
and P = 0.0817 for the 3-day and 7-day models, respectively). All statistical ana-
lyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.04 software.
Counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Agar gels were prepared (Veronal buffer+0.5%
(w/v) purified agar+0.5% (w/v) LSA agarose+0.05% (w/v) sodium azide, pH 8.2)
and wells were cut out using a cutter. Into one column of wells, 10 µl of neat anti-
Candida mAb was added. The same volume of antigen (crude C. albicans yeast or
hyphal preparation (following glass bead disruption of cells and 1 min cen-
trifugation at 15,200 × g to generate disrupted cell wall/glass bead slurry and cell
supernatant antigenic preparations)) was added to the second column of wells and

 gels were placed into an electrophoresis tank containing veronal buffer. Gels were
oriented so that the antibody wells were lined up alongside the anode and the
antigen wells alongside the cathode due to antibody migration towards the cathode
via electroendosmosis and antigen migration towards the anode due to lower
isoelectric points than the buffer pH. The gels were run at 100 V for 90 min before
removal and immersion in saline-trisodium citrate overnight. The following day,
the gels were rinsed with water and covered with moistened filter paper and left to
dry in an oven for 2 h. Once dried, the filter paper was moistened and removed and
the gels put back into the oven for a further 15 min to dry completely. Gels were
then immersed in Buffalo Black solution (0.05% (v/v) Buffalo Black, 50% (v/v)
distilled water, 40% (v/v) methylated spirit, 10% (v/v) acetic acid) for 10 min before
destaining in 45% (v/v) industrial methylated spirits, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 45% (v/
v) distilled water for 10 min. Gels were then dried and examined for the formation
of precipitin lines.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses of data were carried out using GraphPad
Prism 5.04. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. When comparing two groups,
unpaired two-tailed t-tests were performed with Welch’s correction when appro-
priate. For comparison of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA with Bon-
ferroni’s post hoc comparisons or the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple
comparisons test was performed.
