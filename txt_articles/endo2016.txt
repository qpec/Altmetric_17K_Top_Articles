Ror2 receptor tyrosine kinase plays crucial roles in developmental morphogenesis and tissue-/organo-genesis. In the develop-
ing brain, Ror2 is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) and involved in the regulation of their stemness. However,
it remains largely unknown about its role in the adult brain. In this study, we show that Ror2 is up-regulated in reactive astro-
cytes in the neocortices within 3 days following stab-wound injury. Intriguingly, Ror2-expressing astrocytes were detected pri-
marily at the area surrounding the injury site, where astrocytes express Nestin, a marker of NPCs, and proliferate in response
to injury. Furthermore, we show by using astrocyte-specific Ror2 knockout (KO) mice that a loss of Ror2 in astrocytes attenu-
ates injury-induced proliferation of reactive astrocytes. It was also found that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is strongly
up-regulated at 1 day post injury in the neocortices, and that stimulation of cultured quiescent astrocytes with bFGF restarts
their cell cycle and induces expression of Ror2 during the G1 phase predominantly in proliferating cells. By using this culture
method, we further show that the proportions of Ror2-expressing astrocytes increase following treatment with the histone
deacetylases inhibitors including valproic acid, and that bFGF stimulation increases the levels of Ror2 expression within the
respective cells. Moreover, we show that bFGF-induced cell cycle progression into S phase is inhibited or promoted in astro-
cytes from Ror2 KO mice or NPCs stably expressing Ror2-GFP, respectively. Collectively, these findings indicate that Ror2
plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle progression of reactive astrocytes following brain injury.

Introduction
I
n the adult mammalian brains, neural stem cells exist only
in the limited regions, and as a result the brains have an
insufficient capacity to regenerate neurons following injury or
degenerative disorders. Interestingly, accumulating evidence
demonstrates that mature astrocytes, most abundant glial cells
in the adult brains, acquire stem cell hallmarks in response to
certain kinds of injury such as a traumatic injury (Dimou
and Gotz 2014; Gotz et al., 2015; Robel et al., 2011; Sirko
et al., 2013, 2015). Although these astrocytes can not gener-
ate neurons, they start to proliferate at the regions surround-
ing the injury sites (Bardehle et al., 2013; Buffo et al., 2008).
The proliferating response of astrocytes, which contributes to
astrocytic scar formation, is required critically for restricting
inflammation, and promoting repair of damaged tissues,
thereby helping to preserve function of intact neurons after
central nervous system (CNS) injury (Pekny and Pekna,
2014; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010; Wanner et al., 2013). It
has been well known that astrocytes are activated under path-
ological conditions, induced by various CNS insults, and that
the reactive behavior of astrocytes differ depending on the
type of injury (Burda and Sofroniew, 2014; Sofroniew, 2009).
Although reactive astrocytes can be identified commonly by
the expression of reactive astrocyte-specific marker genes, such
as a gene encoding glial fibrous acidic protein (GFAP), recent
studies revealed that gene expression patterns are distin-
guished among reactive astrocytes induced by different inju-
ries and even among neighboring astrocytes in response to a

 particular injury (Anderson et al., 2014; Zamanian et al.,
2012). Thus, a set of genes expressed in reactive astrocytes
might determine specific behavior of individual astrocytes
under pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear
about the precise molecular mechanisms that allow astrocytes
to proliferate by acquiring stem cell properties.
The Ror-family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
Ror1 and Ror2, have been shown to activate the b-catenin
independent noncanonical Wnt signaling by acting as recep-
tors for Wnt5a, and play crucial roles in regulating cellular
polarity, migration, proliferation, and differentiation during
developmental
morphogenesis
and
tissue-/organo-genesis
(Green et al., 2008; He et al., 2008; Ho et al., 2012; Minami
et al., 2010; Nishita et al., 2014; Oishi et al., 2003; Schamb-
ony and Wedlich, 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2008). In the
developing neocortices, both Ror1 and Ror2 are expressed at
higher levels in neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs), and
Wnt5a-Ror1 and Wnt5a-Ror2 signalings play a role in main-
taining their stemness, including proliferative and neurogenic
properties (Endo et al., 2012). However, it remains largely
unknown about the roles of the Ror-family of RTKs in the
adult
brains
under
physiological
and/or
pathological
conditions.
Accumulating evidence demonstrates that Wnt5a-Ror
signalings are indeed involved in various pathological situa-
tions, including cancer progression, inflammation, and tissue
repair (Endo et al., 2015; Miyoshi et al., 2012; Nishita et al.,
2010; Sato et al., 2015). Sustained or increased expression of
Ror2 has been reported in several types of cancer cells,
including osteosarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma
cells, and it plays important roles in promoting their aggres-
siveness, including invasion, enhanced proliferation, survival
and metastasis, through the constitutive activation of Wnt5a-
Ror2 signaling (Enomoto et al., 2009; O’Connell et al.,
2010; Wright et al., 2009). Furthermore, it has been shown
that induced expression of Ror2 plays a crucial role in regulat-
ing sustained inflammation during renal fibrosis induced by
unilateral ureteral obstruction (Li et al., 2013). These findings
indicate that expression of Ror2 is controlled precisely during
development and after birth, and induced if necessary or by
pathological contexts, however the molecular mechanism reg-
ulating the expression of Ror2 is still poorly understood.
In our present study, we found that expression of Ror2
is up-regulated in reactive astrocytes in the adult mouse neo-
cortices following stab-wound injury. Immunofluorescence
analysis reveals that Ror2 is expressed highly in a subset of
Nestin-expressing reactive astrocytes, and that these Ror2-
expressing astrocytes preferentially proliferate. Furthermore, it
was shown by using astrocyte-specific Ror2 knockout (KO)
mice that a loss of Ror2 in astrocytes results in decreased
numbers of proliferating reactive astrocytes without affecting
their reactive response characterized by expression of GFAP
.
In vitro analysis with cultured astrocytes further exhibits that
expression of Ror2 is induced by stimulation with basic fibro-
blast growth factor (bFGF) and is required for bFGF-induced
progression of cell cycle into S phase. Intriguingly, fluores-
cence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis reveals that bFGF
induces expression of Ror2 in a subset of cultured astrocytes,
subsequently entering into S phase. We also provide evidence
supporting a notion that Ror2 is epigenetically silenced in a
subset of astrocytes, that can be released by treatment with
the histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors such as valproic
acid (VPA), contributing to the inhibition of cell cycle pro-
gression. In fact, ectopic expression of Ror2 in astrocytes
increases the proportion of proliferating cells in the presence
of bFGF. These findings demonstrate for the first time that
Ror2, whose expression is induced in a subset of reactive
astrocytes, plays the critical role in regulating cell cycle pro-
gression of reactive astrocytes following brain injury.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Eight- to twelve-week-old mice (male) were used for the stab-wound
injury experiments. For selective deletion of Ror2 in astrocytes,
homozygous mice carrying floxed Ror2 alleles (Ror2fl/fl) (Maeda
et al., 2012) were crossed with the mGFAP-Cre mice line 73.12
(The Jackson Laboratory). mGFAP-Cre-/-/Ror2-floxed littermates were
used as control. To monitor Cre-mediated recombination efficiency,
the mGFAP-Cre mice line 73.12 were crossed with the ROSA26-
LacZ mice (The Jackson Laboratory). Conventional Ror2 and Wnt5a
KO mice were described previously (Nomi et al., 2001; Takeuchi
et al., 2000; Yamaguchi et al., 1999). These mutant mice were main-
tained in a mixed background of C57BL/6 and ICR. All the experi-
ments using animals in this study were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (Permission numbers: P121004
and P140903) and carried out at the Institute for Experimental Ani-
mals, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, according to
the Kobe University Animal Experimentation Regulations.
Surgical Procedures
Stab-wound
injury
experiments
were
performed
as
previously
described (Buffo et al., 2008). Briefly, animals were anesthetized and
injured (�0.7 mm in depth and 1.5–2 mm in length) in the neocor-
tices using a stereotactic apparatus. Proliferating cells were labeled
with 5’-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) by its addition
to drinking water (1 mg/mL water containing 1% sucrose) at 3 to 7
days post-injury (dpi).
Antibodies and Reagents
Rabbit anti-Ror2 antibodies were prepared as described (Kani et al.,
2004). The following antibodies were purchased commercially:
mouse monoclonal antibodies against GFAP (GA-5; Sigma-Aldrich),
S100b (SH-B1; Sigma-Aldrich), Nestin (Rat-401; BD Pharmingen),

Biotechnology), and a-tubulin (HRP conjugated, PM054-7; MBL);
goat polyclonal antibodies against Ror2 (AF2064; R&D Systems),
and Wnt5a (AF645; R&D Systems).
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were immediately
dissected and post-fixed with 4% PFA for 2 hrs at room tem-
perature (RT) or overnight at 48C. After equilibration with
30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, coronal sections of 20–50 lm
thickness were prepared by cutting the brains with a vibra-
tome (Microslicer Zero1, Dosaka). After treating with block-
ing buffer (PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.5% (v/v) Triton
X-100), the sections were incubated with the respective anti-
bodies and DAPI for counterstaining. For staining with
mouse monoclonal antibodies, M.O.M. Blocking Reagent
(Vector Laboratories) was used to reduce endogenous mouse
IgG staining. For immunostaining of Ror2, the sections were
incubated with goat anti-Ror2 antibody (1:2000) in Can Get
Signal Immunostain Solution B (Toyobo), and then stained
using the TSA Kit#12 with Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide (Life
Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For triple staining of Ror2 or b-gal along with S100b and
GFAP
, Nestin, Ki67 or BrdU, the sections were stained first
with anti-Ror2 or anti-b-gal antibody (1:5000) using the
TSA Kit#12 with Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide, and then incu-
bated with the respective antibodies.
Cell Culture
NPC-derived astrocytes were prepared as previously described
(Endo et al., 2012). In brief, NPCs were isolated from the
neocortices of embryonic day 18 (E18) or neonatal (P0) mice
and cultured as neurospheres as previously described. The pri-
mary neurospheres were dissociated into a single-cell suspen-
sion and seeded in poly-L-lysine- and Matrigel-coated dishes
and subsequently passaged every 3 days with fresh medium
[DMEM/F12 supplemented with Neurobrew-21 (Milteny
Biotec), bFGF (20 ng/mL, Peprotech), and EGF (20 ng/mL,
Peprotech)]. NPCs at passage(s) 1–3 were used, unless stated
otherwise. To induce differentiation into astrocytes, NPCs
were cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated dishes in DMEM/F12,
supplemented with Neurobrew-21 and 2% (v/v) FBS, at a
density of 4 x 104 cells/cm2. After 3 days in culture, cells
were treated with 10 lM cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 days to remove oligodendrocyte pro-
genitor cells (OPCs). After 10–12 days in culture, the cells
were used as differentiated astrocytes. The purity of astrocytes
in these cultures was >99% as determined by anti-GFAP
antibody immunostaining. To induce proliferation of differ-
entiated astrocytes, cells were cultured in DMEM/F12, sup-
plemented with Neurobrew-21 and bFGF (20 ng/mL) for 1-
5 days. bFGF was supplied by adding purified bFGF every
day or by adding StemBeads FGF2 (Stem Cultures) every
3days, and culture medium was replaced with fresh medium
every 3 days. To obtain astrocytes stably expressing GFP or
Ror2-GFP
, the respective virus-infected NPCs were selected
with puromycin, and then differentiated into astrocytes as
described above. Embryonic NPCs and OPCs were prepared
from the neocortices of E12 or P0 mice, respectively (see
Supp. Info. Methods).
Quantitative RT-PCR
The total RNAs were isolated from tissues (U 0.20 cm),
punched from the injured and uninjured neocortices, or cul-
tured
cells
using
Isogen
(Nippon
Gene)
and
reverse-
transcribed using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara). Expres-
sion of the respective mRNAs was quantified by real-time
PCR using LightCycler 480 II system (Roche). The amounts
of the respective mRNAs were normalized relative to those of
18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Primers used are listed in Supp.
Info. Table S1.
Immunoblotting
To prepare whole cell lysates, cells were solubilized with lysis
buffer containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 10 mM NaF, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride (p-
APMSF), 10 lg/mL leupeptin, and 10 lg/mL aprotinin. To
analyze histone modifications, histones were extracted from
nuclei. Briefly, cells or tissues were homogenized in cell lysis
buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/
v) NP-40, and 20 mM sodium butyrate]. Nuclei were collect-
ed by centrifugation (1000 x g) for 10 min at 48C, and then
solubilized with Nuclei lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 20 mM sodium
butyrate]. The whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts were sub-
jected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–15% PAG) to separate proteins
and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Immobilon-P; Millipore). The membranes were immuno-
blotted with the respective antibodies as previously described.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay
Cultured astrocytes (1 3 106 cells per sample) were fixed
with 1% (w/v) PFA for 5 min at RT, followed by incubation
with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at RT. After washing twice

 with ice cold PBS, cells were collected by centrifugation
(1000 3 g) for 10 min at 48C, and digested with 0.5 U of
micrococcal nuclease (MNase; Takara) in 100 ll of MNase
digestion buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2% TritonX-
100, and 1 mM CaCl2] for 15 min at 378C. After stopping
the reaction by adding 10x MNase stop buffer [110 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 55 mM EDTA], the reaction solu-
tions containing digested chromatin were further sonicated
for 6 cycles (30 sec on/off at high power) by a cup horn soni-
cator (Q700, Qsonica), adjusted to RIPA condition by adding
ice cold 2x RIPA buffer [280 mM NaCl, 1.8% (v/v)

to immunoprecipitation with anti-acetyl-histone H3 (3 lg) or
control rabbit IgG (011-000-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, 3 lg). After decrosslinking and purification of
the DNA fragments, the amounts of the DNA fragments of
interest were measured by LightCycler 480 II System (Roche)
with the respective primers and normalized relative to those
in input materials. The sequences of the primers are listed in
Supp. Info. Table S1.
Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence in Situ
Hybridization (FISH)
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed with 4%
PFA for 30 min at RT. After treatment with blocking buffer
(PBS, containing 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-
100), cells were incubated with the respective antibodies and
DAPI for counterstaining. FISH was carried out using a
QuantiGene ViewRNA in situ hybridization cell kit (Affyme-
trix) with probe sets designed by Affymetrix for hybridization
to mouse Ror2 mRNA, Ki67 mRNA, bFGF mRNA and 18S
rRNA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To pre-
pare freshly isolated cells from the neocortices of adult mice
for FISH analyses, cortical tissues (U 0.20 cm) were dissociat-
ed using a Papain Dissociation System (Worthington) for 20
min at 378C, according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and
followed by washing and trituration in DMEM containing
10% (v/v) FBS. The dissociated cells were collected on poly-
L-lysine-coated glass slides using a cytospin centrifuge for 5
min at 1500 rpm, fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at RT, dehy-
drated in graded ethanol (50, 70, and 100%), and then air-
dried.
Data Presentation and Statistics
Fluorescence images of tissues or cultured cells were obtained
using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM710;
Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) or a fluorescence microscope (BZ-
X700; Keyence), respectively, and processed using ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health) and Photoshop CS3 (Adobe).
For quantificative analysis in vivo, the numbers of marker-
positive cells within a 0.2–0.3 mm2 lesion area (10–15 lm
thickness),
where
approximately
200–300
S100b-positive
astrocytes exist, were counted per section and normalized to
cell density per 0.01 mm3. Each value was obtained as an
average from multiple sections per animal, and at least three
animals were examined. For the quantification of the percen-
tages of marker-positive cells in vitro, 200–1000 cells in 5–15
randomly chosen microscopic fields in each experiment were
counted. Marker-positive cells in FISH analyses were deter-
mined as cells with two or more the indicated mRNA par-
ticles per cell. Values were obtained from at least three
independent experiments. Data were expressed as mean 6
standard error of the mean (SEM), unless stated otherwise.
Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism
5.0 (GraphPad Software). Significance was determined as *P
< 0.05, **P < 0.01, or ***P < 0.001 compared with control
using the Student’s t-test when two groups were compared, or
using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc
test when more than three groups were analyzed.
Results
Ror2 Is up-Regulated in Reactive Astrocytes in the
Injured Neocortices
Ror2 is expressed at higher levels in NPCs in the developing
neocortices (Supp. Info. Fig. 1A; see also Endo et al., 2012).
Consistent with the expression patterns of Nestin and Ki67,
markers of progenitor cells and proliferating cells, respectively,
expression level of Ror2 in the neocortices is decreased gradu-
ally throughout development and after birth (up to adult-
hood) (Fig. 1A), suggesting that decreased expression of Ror2
in the neocortices might reflect the reduction in the propor-
tion of progenitor cells. In accordance with this idea, higher
expression levels of Ror2 could be detected in enriched cul-
tures of proliferating progenitor cells, including embryonic
and neonatal NPCs, and OPCs, than those of their differenti-
ated cells such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes
(Supp. Info. Fig. 2).
In the adult brains, mature glial cells such as astrocytes
are known to become reactive and acquire stem cell properties
in response to a traumatic injury (Buffo et al., 2008; Gotz
et al., 2015). We thus asked whether Ror2 is expressed in
these activated glial cells. Expression levels of Nestin and Ki67
are indeed increased in injured neocortices following a stab-
wound (Fig. 1B). We found that levels of Ror2 mRNA also
begin to increase within 3 days post-injury (dpi) in these tis-
sues. To clarify which types of cells express Ror2 following
brain injury, we performed immunohistochemical analyses to
determine Ror2 expression in the tissues at 7 dpi. Ror2-
positive cells were detected primarily at the area surrounding
the injury site (Fig. 1C). Triple staining analyses revealed that

 Ror2 was expressed in S100b-positive astrocytes that were
also stained with GFAP at the lesion area (Fig. 1D), while
immunoreactivities of Ror2 and GFAP could not be detected
in S100b-positive astrocytes located at corresponding area in
the contralateral side or in the intact neocortices (Fig. 1E and
Supp. Info. Fig. 1B), indicating that Ror2 is up-regulated in
reactive astrocytes following brain injury. Ror2-positive reac-
tive astrocytes at the lesion area were observed continuously
at 3, 5, and 14 dpi (Fig. 1F).
Ror2 Is Expressed Highly in a Subset of Reactive
Astrocytes after Brain Injury
Astrocytes located at the proximal lesion area showed more
intense Ror2 immunoreactivity than those at the distal lesion
area (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, heterogeneous expression levels of
Ror2 were observed even among astrocytes located at the same
distances from injury sites (Fig. 2A). The quantitative analyses
revealed that Ror2-positive astrocytes (S100b1 & Ror21)
were present predominantly at the proximal lesion area within
300 lm from the injury site, while GFAP-positive astrocytes
(S100b1 & GFAP1) were present even at the distal lesion
area (Fig. 2B,C). It has been reported that astrocytes react to
brain injury in a heterogeneous manner with only a subset
starting to proliferate and express stem cell-related genes
(Anderson et al., 2014; Bardehle et al., 2013; Sirko et al.,
2013; Sirko et al., 2015). Thus, we examined expression pro-
files of Nestin, Ki67, and Ror2 in astrocytes at 5 dpi, when
proliferating astrocytes were clearly detectable. Nestin-positive
astrocytes (S100b1 & Nestin1) and Ki67-positive astrocytes
(S100b1 & Ki671), as well as Ror2-positive astrocytes, were
observed predominantly at the proximal lesion area within 300
lm from the injury site (Fig. 2D,E,G). Interestingly, expression
level of Ror2 was higher in Nestin-positive astrocytes (located
at the proximal lesion area) than in Nestin-negative ones
(located at the distal lesion area) (Fig. 2D). Higher expression
level of Ror2 was also detected in almost all Ki671 astrocytes

Ror2 was expressed in a large proportion of Nestin1, Ki671,

 area surrounding the injury site, and that Ror21 reactive astro-
cytes might preferentially proliferate.
Ror2 Promotes Proliferation of Reactive Astrocytes
in the Injured Neocortices
Next, we examined the role of Ror2 induced in reactive astro-
cytes after brain injury. Because conventional Ror2 KO mice
die soon after birth, Ror2-floxed mice were crossed with the
mGFAP-Cre mice line 73.12 to generate astrocyte-specific
Ror2 KO mice (see Materials and Methods). Consistent with
the previous reports showing the specific expression of Cre in
astrocytes in this mGFAP-Cre line (Herrmann et al., 2008),
when ROSA26-LacZ mice were used as an indicator of Cre-
mediated recombination efficiency in mGFAP-Cre mice, b-
galactosidase (b-gal) was expressed in almost all S100b1 &
GFAP1 reactive astrocytes in the injured neocortices as well
as S100b1 mature astrocytes in the intact neocortices (Fig. 3A).
Any apparent abnormalities in the number and distribution of
S100b1 astrocytes were not observed in the intact neocortices
of both Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 and Ror2fl/fl mice (Fig. 3B). As
shown, expression of Ror2 in reactive astrocytes was undetectable
in the injured neocortices of Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice (Fig. 3C).
Although induced expression of GFAP in the reactive astro-
cytes surrounding the injury site was comparably observed in
both Ror2fl/fl and Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice (Fig. 3D), the
number of S100b1 astrocytes incorporated BrdU at 7 dpi
was decreased in Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice compared to Ror2fl/fl
mice after application of BrdU in their drinking water on 3-7
dpi (Fig. 3E,F). The total number of S100b1 astrocytes
within 300 lm from the injury site was also slightly decreased
if any in Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice compared to Ror2fl/fl mice
(Fig. 3F). Importantly, however, the percentage of proliferat-
ing astrocytes (BrdU1 & S100b1) per total astrocytes
(S100b1) within 300 lm from the injury site was signifi-
cantly lower in Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice than in Ror2fl/fl mice
(Fig. 3G). These results indicate that Ror2 is required for
proper proliferation of reactive astrocytes.
Newly proliferated astrocytes in the injured CNS con-
tribute to form glial scars, in which astrocytes are aligned
densely along borders of lesion sites. The scar forming astro-
cytes have been shown to surround inflammatory cells to lim-
it their spreading from injury sites into healthy adjacent tissue
FIGURE 6: bFGF-induced cell cycle progression is inhibited in Ror2-depleted astrocytes. A, B: Differentiated astrocytes prepared from WT or

 (Wanner et al., 2013). Thus, we examined whether scar for-
mation is affected in injured neocortices of Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1
mice. The density of astrocytes surrounding injury sites at 14
dpi were significantly reduced in Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice
than in Ror2fl/fl mice (Supp. Info. Fig. 3A,B). However, we
observed that astrocytes surrounding injury sites could elon-
gate and align parallel to the lesions and CD45-positive infil-
trating inflammatory cells were located mainly within lesion
sites that were surrounded by these astrocytes in both Ror2fl/fl
and Ror2fl/fl;GFAPCre/1 mice (Supp. Info. Fig. 3A), suggesting
that Ror2 might promote glial scar formation by regulating
proliferation but not elongation and reorientation of reactive
astrocytes in the injured neocortices.
Ror2 Is Induced in Astrocytes During Cell Cycle
Progression Stimulated with bFGF
Our findings indicate that induced expression of Ror2 associ-
ates with proliferative status of reactive astrocytes in the
injured
neocortices.
bFGF,
a
well-characterized
molecule
involved in proliferation of astrocytes both in vivo and in
vitro (Gomez-Pinilla et al., 1995; Kang et al., 2014; Riboni
et al., 2001), has been shown to be up-regulated in the neo-
cortices following stab-wound injury (Biname et al., 2013).
In fact, we observed that bFGF was strongly up-regulated at 1
dpi in the injured neocortices (Fig. 4A). Consistent with pre-
vious reports showing reactive astrocytes as a source of bFGF
in multiple sclerosis lesions and in a contusion injury of the
spinal cord (Clemente et al., 2011; do Carmo Cunha et al.,
2007), we also observed by using a FISH analysis in freshly
isolated cells from cortical tissues that expression level of
bFGF is increased in reactive astrocytes, but not in neurons,
following stab-wound injury (Supp. Info. Fig. 4A-D). Thus,
we performed experiments by using cultured astrocytes to
examine the possible involvement of bFGF in the induction
of Ror2 in the cells. Almost all differentiated astrocytes in our
culture condition were GFAP1
, Nestin2 and Ki672 (Fig.
4B,C). When these astrocytes were stimulated with bFGF
under a serum-free condition, bFGF induced their prolifera-
tion and expression of Nestin (Fig. 4B,C). Reduced expres-
sion
of
GFAP
was
also
observed,
but
this
might
be
attributable to serum withdrawal rather than stimulation with
bFGF. We found that expression of Ror2 was increased at
both protein and mRNA levels in cultured astrocytes after
stimulation with bFGF (Fig. 4D,E). As shown in Fig. 4E,
up-regulation of Ror2 mRNA was detectable within 1 day
after stimulation, when expression levels of CyclinD1 and
CyclinE1, but not CyclinA2, reached at higher levels, sugges-
ting that expression of Ror2 is induced during the G1 phase
of cell cycle in bFGF-stimulated astrocytes.
Next, to monitor the cells entering into S phase, astro-
cytes were cultured with or without bFGF in the presence of
FIGURE 7: Ectopic expression of Ror2 in astrocytes increases the proportion of proliferating cells following bFGF-stimulation. A: Neona-

 BrdU, and stained with antibodies against BrdU and Ki67.
BrdU1 cells were not detectable under unstimulated condi-
tion even at day 5 in culture with BrdU, while BrdU1 cells,
as well as Ki671 cells, were detectable at day 3, and further
increased in their proportion up to day 5 after stimulation
with bFGF (Fig. 4F). Considering the finding that Ki671
cells were also positive for BrdU staining in our cultures, it is
conceivable that Ki671 cells detected within 5 days after
bFGF-stimulation correspond to the cells entering into S
phase of the first cell cycle progression after stimulation. In
fact, the proportions of both BrdU1 cells and Ki671 cells
were estimated at approximately 10% at day 3 and 20% at
day 5 after stimulation with bFGF (Fig. 4G). These results
indicate that a part of quiescent astrocytes can enter into the
S phase within day 3 to day 5 after bFGF stimulation. We
further performed a multi-color FISH analysis with a probe
for Ror2 mRNA along with probes for Ki67 mRNA and 18S
rRNA to identify the cells expressing Ror2. In this analysis,
the respective mRNAs were detected as small particles, and
the cells with two or more Ror2 or Ki67 mRNA particles
were apparently detectable in astrocytes cultured with bFGF,
but rarely detectable in astrocytes cultured without bFGF
(Fig. 4H, see also Fig. 5D,E). As expected, Ror2 mRNA par-
ticles were undetectable in bFGF-stimulated astrocytes pre-
pared from Ror2 KO mice (data not shown). Thus, we
defined cells with two or more Ror2 or Ki67 mRNA particles
as Ror21 or Ki671 cells, respectively. Only a limited propor-
tion of Ror21 (18.8 6 5.9% per total cells, Fig. 4I) or
Ki671 cells (14.6 6 5.2% per total cells, Fig. 4J) were
observed. Interestingly, the majority of Ki671 cells were also
positive for Ror2 (65.6 6 3.9% of Ki671 cells were positive
for Ror2, Fig. 4I), and vice versa (50.4 6 1.8% of Ror21 cells
were positive for Ki67, Fig. 4J). These results indicate that
astrocytes expressing Ror2 might preferentially progress into S
phase following stimulation with bFGF.
Ror2 Is Epigenetically Silenced in a Subset of
Astrocytes
Ror2 is induced in a subset of astrocytes after stimulation with
bFGF. As an attempt to clarify the mechanisms underlying this
heterogeneous response to bFGF signaling in astrocytes, we
first examined the phosphorylation of Erk, an early down-
stream event of FGF signaling following bFGF stimulation. An
increased phosphorylation level of Erk was detected in almost
all the cells within 15 min after bFGF stimulation (Fig. 5A).
We also observed increased expression of CyclinD1 in almost
all the nuclei at day 1 after stimulation with bFGF (Supp. Fig.
5). These results indicate that astrocytes can respond uniformly
to bFGF at least at the levels of early signaling events.
Next, we examined the possibility that Ror2 is epigenetical-
ly silenced in a subset of astrocytes. To this end, we treated
astrocytes with the HDAC inhibitors VPA or trichostatin A
(TSA). The levels of histone acetylation (H3K9/K14Ac) in astro-
cytes were increased by treatment with VPA or TSA (Supp. Fig.
6A). Expression levels of Ror2 in astrocytes treated with VPA
(Fig. 5B) or TSA (Supp. Info. Fig. 6B) were increased drastically
compared to those in untreated astrocytes even in the absence of
bFGF-stimulation, and further enhanced by the stimulation
with bFGF. To confirm whether VPA-treatment affects the states
of histone modification at the Ror2 promoter, we performed
ChIP analysis to monitor histone acetylation. The levels of
H3K9/K14Ac at the Ror2 promoter were indeed increased in
VPA-treated astrocytes, while the levels of H3K9/K14Ac at the
GAPDH promoter was unaffected by the treatment with VPA
(Fig. 5C). FISH analyses also revealed that the proportions of
Ror21 cells in the presence or absence of bFGF were increased
significantly by VPA treatment (Fig. 5D,E). On the other hand,
the numbers of Ror2 mRNA particles per cell were increased
marginally by VPA treatment, yet were increased significantly by
bFGF stimulation (Fig. 5F
,G). These results suggest that Ror2 is
epigenetically silenced in a subset of astrocytes, and that bFGF-
stimulation can induce Ror2 expression only in astrocytes with a
permissive chromatin status (e.g., histone acetylation) at the Ror2
promoter.
Expression of Ror2 in Astrocytes Plays a Crucial
Role in Promoting Cell Cycle Progression in the
Presence of bFGF Signaling
We then examined whether Ror2 is involved in regulating
bFGF-induced proliferation of astrocytes by using astrocytes
prepared from Ror2 KO mice. Expression levels of Nestin
and GFAP as well as microscopic appearance of cells were
almost comparable between wild-type (WT) and Ror2 KO
astrocytes in the presence or absence of bFGF, respectively
(Fig. 6A, and data not shown). However, the proportions of
Ki671 cells were reduced significantly in Ror2 KO astrocytes
compared to WT astrocytes at day 5 after bFGF stimulation
(Fig. 6B,C). The expression levels of CyclinE1 and CyclinA2,
but not CyclinD1, were also reduced significantly in Ror2 KO
astrocytes (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that expression of
Ror2 is required for the progression of cell cycle into S phase
in astrocytes following bFGF stimulation.
We then examined whether expression of Ror2 is suffi-
cient to induce progression of cell cycle in astrocytes. For this
purpose, we used astrocytes prepared from NPCs stably
expressing GFP or Ror2-GFP
. As shown, Ki671 cells were
undetectable in astrocytes expressing either Ror2-GFP or GFP
in the absence of bFGF (Fig. 7A). Intriguingly, however,
Ror2-GFP-expressing
astrocytes
showed
nearly
six-fold
increase in the proportion of Ki671 cells after stimulation
with bFGF compared to GFP-expressing astrocytes (Fig.
7B,C).
These
results

support
our
notion
that
12

 expression of Ror2 in astrocytes plays a crucial role in pro-
moting bFGF-induced cell cycle progression.
As shown, expression of Wnt5a was increased slightly in
the neocortices following a stab-wound injury (Supp. Info.
Fig. 7A). Expression of Wnt5a was also increased at both
mRNA and protein levels in cultured astrocytes after stimula-
tion with bFGF (Supp. Info. Fig. 7B,C). We thus asked a
question of whether Wnt5a is involved in the regulation of
Ror2 to promote cell cycle progression of astrocytes. Impor-
tantly, bFGF-induced proliferation of astrocytes was unaffect-
ed in Wnt5a KO astrocytes compared to WT astrocytes
(Supp. Info. Fig. 7D,E). Furthermore, the expression levels of
CyclinD1,
CyclinE1
and
CyclinA2
were
rather
slightly
increased in Wnt5a KO astrocytes (Supp. Info. Fig. 7F).
These results indicate that Ror2 mediates bFGF-induced cell
cycle progression of astrocytes in an Wnt5a-independent
manner.
Discussion
The Ror-family of RTKs, Ror1 and Ror2, act as receptors for
Wnt5a and play critical roles in regulating various cellular
events, including polarization, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation, during developmental morphogenesis and tis-
sue-/organo-genesis (He et al., 2008; Minami et al., 2010;
Nishita et al., 2014; Oishi et al., 2003; Schambony and Wed-
lich 2007). Recent findings further demonstrate the possible
involvements of Ror1- or Ror2-mediated signalings in the
regulation of pathological cellular functions, including cancer
progression, chronic inflammation, and tissue repair (Endo
et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013; Miyoshi et al., 2012; Nishita
et al., 2010; Sato et al., 2015). In these pathological condi-
tions, expression of Ror1, Ror2, or Wnt5a is induced to elicit
the activation of their intracellular signalings (Enomoto et al.,
2009; O’Connell et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2009). However,
the roles of the Ror-family of RTKs in the adult brains are
still largely unknown.
In the present study, we show that expression of Ror2 is
induced in reactive astrocytes in the neocortices of adult mice
following a stab-wound injury (Fig. 1). We further show that
Ror2 is expressed at higher levels predominantly in Nestin-
expressing and proliferating reactive astrocytes (Fig. 2). It is
well known that acquisition of stem cell properties, including
expression of stem cell-related genes and proliferation, is a
representative feature of reactive astrocytes induced by a stab-
wound injury (Gotz et al., 2015). In the developing neocorti-
ces, Ror2 is expressed in NPCs and plays a role in maintain-
ing NPCs in an undifferentiated state with neurogenic and
proliferative abilities (Endo et al., 2012). With this respect,
expression of Ror2 might be induced in astrocytes to confer
stem cell properties, although reactive astrocytes do not pos-
sess neurogenic ability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates
that the behavior of reactive astrocytes depends on the type of
damage inducing stimuli (Anderson et al., 2014; Burda and
Sofroniew, 2014; Zamanian et al., 2012). It should be noted
that induced expression of Ror2 and Nestin as well as prolif-
erative response could not be observed in GFAP-expressing
reactive astrocytes in the neocortices of mice injected intraper-
itoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (data not shown).
These findings indicate that expression of Ror2 might be
induced in reactive astrocytes with stem cell properties, and
further emphasize that Ror2 might play a critical role in regu-
lating stem cell properties in reactive astrocytes. In fact, it was
found that proliferation of reactive astrocytes can be inhibited
in the neocortices of astrocyte-specific Ror2 KO mice (Fig. 3).
Therefore, it can be assumed that induced expression of Ror2
might be required for proper proliferation of reactive astro-
cytes following brain injury.
It has been reported that several signaling molecules,
including bFGF, EGF, endothelin-1, sonic hedgehog, and
galectin-1/3, are involved in proliferation of astrocytes in
response to brain injury (Gadea et al., 2008; Kang et al.,
2014; Pitter et al., 2014; Sirko et al., 2013; Sirko et al.,
2015; Yang et al., 2011). However, these molecules also
appear to affect other reactive responses such as induction of
GFAP
, and thus it remains to be elucidated how these mole-
cules affect cell proliferation of reactive astrocytes. Interesting-
ly, we found that expression of Ror2 is induced in cultured
astrocytes following stimulation with bFGF (Fig. 4D,E). We
also observed that expression of bFGF is up-regulated strongly
at least in reactive astrocytes in the injured neocortices within
1 day after a stab-wound injury (Fig. 4A and Supp. Info. Fig.
4), although other cell types, including activated microglia
(CD11b1 cells) and infiltrating immuno-inflammatory cells
(CD451 cells), might be additional sources of bFGF in the
injured neocortices. These findings suggest that bFGF might
induce expression of Ror2 in reactive astrocytes following
brain injury. However, we also observed that EGF as well as
bFGF could promote proliferation and expression of Ror2 in
cultured astrocytes, although any apparent alterations in
expression levels of EGF were not detected in the injured
neocortices under our experimental settings (data not shown).
Considering our findings that expression of Ror2 is induced
predominantly in proliferating astrocytes (Fig. 4H-J), it is
conceivable that expression of Ror2 might be induced in
astrocytes by a common signal that induces their prolifera-
tion. Further study will be required to clarify the molecular
mechanism that induces expression of Ror2 in reactive astro-
cytes following brain injury.
Intriguingly, it was found that bFGF stimulation indu-
ces expression of Ror2 in a subset of astrocytes, and that the
proportion of Ror2-expressing astrocytes is increased by treat-
ment with a HDAC inhibitor VPA (Fig. 5D,E), while

13
 expression levels of Ror2 per cell in astrocytes are increased
significantly by bFGF stimulation, but not VPA treatment
(Fig. 5F,G). These findings suggest that Ror2 is epigenetically
silenced in a subset of cultured astrocytes, and that bFGF-
stimulation can induce Ror2 expression only in astrocytes
with a permissive chromatin status at the Ror2 promoter. It
should be noted that injury-induced expression of Ror2 is
detected in a subset of reactive astrocytes even at the same
distance from the injury site (Fig. 2A). Accumulating evi-
dence demonstrates that astrocytes respond to injury in a het-
erogeneous
manner
(Anderson
et
al.,
2014),
and
that
proliferating astrocytes are observed in a subset of reactive
astrocytes located at juxtavascular sites (Bardehle et al., 2013).
Thus, it will be of interest to address a question of whether
Ror2 is epigenetically regulated in astrocytes in vivo and to
examine whether Ror2 is induced predominantly in these jux-
tavascular astrocytes following injury.
How does Ror2 regulate proliferation of astrocytes?
Although Ror2 has been implicated in the regulation of pro-
liferation in several cell types, including NPCs and cancer
cells (Endo et al., 2012; He et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2015;
Shojima et al., 2015; Takiguchi et al., 2016; Wright et al.,
2009; Yu et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is still
unclear. We show that induced expression of GFAP in reac-
tive astrocytes is not affected by deletion of Ror2 (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that reduced proliferation of reactive astrocytes by
astrocyte-specific deletion of Ror2 might not be attributable
to failures in overall reactive responses of astrocytes. Consis-
tent with the findings obtained by in vivo experiments, we
also show that deletion of Ror2 in astrocytes inhibits cell cycle
progression of astrocytes into S phase following stimulation
with bFGF in vitro (Fig. 6B,C), while deletion of Ror2 in
astrocytes fails to affect expression levels of GFAP and Nestin
in culture in the presence or absence of bFGF (Fig. 6A).
Importantly, we observed that Ror2 could also mediate EGF-
induced cell cycle progression of astrocytes (data not shown).
Thus, it might be possible that Ror2 mediates cell cycle pro-
gression by affecting the cell cycle regulatory machinery rather
than by specifically regulating bFGF signaling. Indeed, we
show that expression of Ror2 is induced in astrocytes follow-
ing bFGF stimulation prior to their entry into S phase (Fig.
4E,F), and that expression of CyclinE1, required to trigger S
phase entry of the cells in late G1 phase, is somewhat sup-
pressed in bFGF-stimulated astrocytes prepared from Ror2
KO mice compared to those from WT ones (Fig. 6D). On
the other hand, expression level of CyclinD1 was unaffected
by deletion of Ror2 in bFGF-stimulated astrocytes (Fig. 6D).
It has been shown that CyclinE1 is induced in late G1
through progressive phosphorylation of pRb mediated by
CyclinD-dependent kinases CDK4/6 (Hwang and Clurman,
2005; Zhang et al., 2000). Thus, further study aiming to test
a possible involvement of CDK4/6 as downstream targets of
Ror2-mediated signaling in regulating proliferation of astro-
cytes will be required to clarify this issue.
We have previously shown that Wnt5a as well as Ror2
are required for the maintenance of undifferentiated and pro-
liferative states of NPCs (Endo et al., 2012). Although our
findings in this study demonstrate clearly the critical role of
Ror2 in regulating proliferation of astrocytes, the role of
Wnt5a in this regulatory process remains unclear. It has been
reported that expression of Wnt5a is induced in reactive
astrocytes in the injured spinal cord, and that it plays a role
in inhibiting regrowth and sprouting of corticospinal tract
axons following a spinal cord injury through Ryk, another
well-known receptor for Wnt5a (Liu et al., 2008; Miyashita
et al., 2009). We also observed that expression of Wnt5a is
increased slightly in the neocortices following a stab-wound
injury (Supp. Info. Fig. 7A), and is increased in cultured
astrocytes stimulated with bFGF (Supp. Info. Fig. 7B,C).
However, depleted expression of Wnt5a in cultured astrocytes
failed to affect their proliferation in the presence of bFGF
(Supp. Info. Fig. 7D,E). Thus, it can be assumed that the
role of Ror2 in regulating proliferation of reactive astrocytes
in vivo and bFGF-induced proliferation of astrocytes in vitro
is independent of Wnt5a. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that proliferation of reactive astrocytes following
brain injury might be dependent on Wnt5a. Further study
will be required to clarify this issue.
In summary, we show for the first time the critical role
of Ror2 in regulating cell proliferation of reactive astrocytes
in the injured adult brains. By using a stab-wound injury
model and cultured astrocytes, we demonstrate that Ror2 is
induced in a subset of reactive astrocytes, and provide a possi-
ble regulatory mechanism for induced expression of Ror2 in
reactive astrocytes following brain injury.
