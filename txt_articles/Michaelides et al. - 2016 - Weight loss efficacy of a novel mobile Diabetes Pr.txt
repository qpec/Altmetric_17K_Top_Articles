ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the weight loss efficacy of a
novel mobile platform delivering the Diabetes
Prevention Program.
Research Design and Methods: 43 overweight or
obese adult participants with a diagnosis of
prediabetes signed-up to receive a 24-week virtual
Diabetes Prevention Program with human coaching,
through a mobile platform. Weight loss and
engagement were the main outcomes, evaluated by
repeated measures analysis of variance, backward
regression, and mediation regression.
Results: Weight loss at 16 and 24 weeks was
significant, with 56% of starters and 64% of
completers losing over 5% body weight. Mean weight
loss at 24 weeks was 6.58% in starters and 7.5% in
completers. Participants were highly engaged, with
84% of the sample completing 9 lessons or more.
In-app actions related to self-monitoring significantly
predicted weight loss.
Conclusions: Our findings support the effectiveness
of a uniquely mobile prediabetes intervention,
producing weight loss comparable to studies with high
engagement, with potential for scalable population
health management.
INTRODUCTION
Lifestyle
interventions,1
including
the
National
Diabetes
Prevention
Program
(NDPP) have proven effective in preventing
type 2 diabetes.2
3 Online delivery of an
adapted NDPP has resulted in high levels of
engagement, weight loss, and improvements
in
glycated
hemoglobin
(HbA1c).4
5
Prechronic and chronic care efforts delivered
by other means (text and emails,6 nurse
support,7 DVDs,8 community care9) have
also been successful in promoting behavior
change, weight loss, and glycemic control.
One study10 adapted the NDPP to deliver
the first part of the curriculum in-person
and the remaining sessions through a mobile
app,
and
found
6.8%
weight
loss
at
5 months. Mobile health poses a promising
means of delivering prechronic and chronic
care,11
12
and
provides
a
scalable,
convenient, and accessible method to deliver
the NDPP
.
The weight loss efficacy of a completely
mobile delivery of a structured NDPP has not
been tested. The main aim of this pilot study
was to evaluate the weight loss efficacy of
Noom’s smartphone-based NDPP-based cur-
ricula with human coaching in a group of
overweight and obese hyperglycemic adults
receiving 16 weeks of core, plus postcore cur-
riculum. In this study, it was hypothesized
that the mobile DPP could produce trans-
formative weight loss over time.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A large Northeast-based insurance company
offered its employees free access to Noom
Health, a mobile-based application that deli-
vers
structured
curricula
with
human
coaches. An email or regular mail invitation
with information describing the study was
sent to potential participants based on an
elevated HbA1c status found in their medical
records, reflecting a diagnosis of prediabetes.
Interested participants were assigned to a
virtual
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention (CDC)-recognized NDPP master’s
level coach.
Key messages
▪ To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first fully mobile translation of the Diabetes
Prevention Program.
▪ A National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP)
intervention delivered entirely through a smart-
phone platform showed high engagement and
6-month transformative weight loss, comparable
to the original NDPP and comparable to trad-
itional in-person programmes.
▪ This pilot shows that a novel mobile NDPP inter-
vention has the potential for scalability, and can
address the major barriers facing the widespread
translation of the NDPP into the community
setting, such as a high fixed overhead, fixed
locations, and lower levels of engagement and
weight loss.

 Hyperglycemic males and females (HbA1c between
5.7% and 6.4%) between the ages of 18 and 75 years old
who signed-up for Noom’s NDPP (figure 1, n=121)
between 6/22/2015 and 9/7/2015 were included in the
study. Of 121, individuals were considered ‘interested’
(n=62) if they performed at least one in-app action
during the first week of the curriculum. From 62 inter-
ested participants, those having <2 weigh-ins (n=8) past
baseline and who did not read more than one article
per week for 4 or more weeks were considered non-
starters and were excluded from final analyses. An add-
itional
subject
did
not
provide
any
information.
Participants who read at least one article during any 4 of
the 16 initial weeks were considered to have started, in
accordance with the CDC’s definition. ‘Starters’ (n=43)
must have also messaged the coach at least one time
within the first month. ‘Completers’ (n=36) read at least
one article per week during any 9 of the 16 weeks.
During
the
first
week
of
the
study,
participants
received orientation on what the DPP entails, and learnt
how to use the Noom app, interact with their coach, and
the importance of maintaining motivation throughout
the programme. Participants received daily DPP content
through informative articles and interactive challenges,
and were asked to log their weight, meals, and physical
activity in-app on a weekly basis. The NDPP coach com-
municated with the participants daily via in-app private
and group messages, and brief telephone calls approxi-
mately two times per month. Coaches securely moni-
tored participant progress through a dashboard. The
present study reports 24-week (6 month) results, includ-
ing the16-week core DPP phase, followed by the first
8 weeks of the postcore DPP phase.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics, expressed as means±SD, were calcu-
lated for subject baseline characteristics. Independent
samples t-test compared descriptive baseline character-
istics among non-starters and starters. Repeated mea-
surements analysis of variance (ANOVA) distinguished
the effect of time on weight change. This method
extracts the contribution of the subjects from the error
term. A post hoc ANOVA method, the pairwise Fisher’s
exact test, examined differences from baseline for the
16-week and 24-week weights. Ad hoc ANOVA tests
examined the effect size of the change in weight from
baseline to 16 and 24 weeks. Backward regression ana-
lyses examined whether engagement variables predicted
weight loss at 16 and 24 weeks. Further mediation regres-
sion analyses explored potential influence of engage-
ment variables on other independent variables, to
understand the prediction of weight change, and a
Sobel test examined the significance of the mediation.
Significance tests were two-sided at significance p<0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab V.17
and SPSS V.21 software.
Power analysis
Sample size was determined by using the estimated SD
of change in body mass index (BMI) from an interven-
tion study of patients with hyperglycemia (n=75). A SD
of 1.49 kg/m2 and α of 0.05 produced a final sample of
study participants of 44 at 90% power, to identify a
minimum detectable difference in change in BMI of
0.8 kg/m2 in a one-sample t-test.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of recruited participants, non-
starters, starters, and completers are shown in the table 1.

completion status. Eligible, participants who signed-up and
were included in the study; interested, individuals that
performed at least one in-app action during the first week of
the NDPP curriculum; recruited, participants who read at least
one article during any 4 of the 16 initial weeks and also
messaged the coach at least one time within the first month;
completers, read at least one article per week during any 9 of
the 16 weeks; excluded, participants who had <2 weigh-ins
(n=8), none of which were considered ‘starters’.

 Of 121, 78 were non-starters. In both groups, non-starters
and starters, the majority of the sample was female, but
the proportion was significantly higher in the starters.
Starters were also significantly older than non-starters.
Baseline weight and height were not different between
groups. Approximately 85% of the starters were female,
with a mean age of 51 years at recruitment. All starters
were overweight or obese at baseline, with mean weight
of 96 kg and BMI of 35 kg/m2. No significant differences
were observed between starters and completers.
Weight loss and BMI change at 16 and 24 weeks were
significant (table 1), with 56% of starters and 64% of
completers losing over 5% body weight at 24 weeks
(6.58%
and
7.5%
mean
weight
loss,
respectively).
Weight loss increased steadily over time, but there was
no significant difference between 16 and 24 weeks. Ad
hoc ANOVA tests indicated that weight loss was signifi-
cant
at
16 weeks
for
starters
(M=−5.40,
SD=4.43,
p<0.001, d=1.22) and completers (M=−6.00, SD=4.34,
p<0.001, d=1.38). Weight loss was also significant at
24 weeks from baseline in starters (M=−6.22, SD=5.00,
p<0.001, d=1.24) and completers (M=−7.01, SD=4.83,
p<0.001, d=1.45). Participants showed a high level of
engagement, with 84% of the sample completing nine
lessons or more (CDC standard).
In-app activities reflecting engagement significantly
predicted weight loss among starters and completers.
Backward regression analysis examined the impact of
various
in-app
actions
on
percent
weight
loss
at
6 months for starters (table 1). User actions that signifi-
cantly predicted these variables were the number of
weekly weigh-ins and the number of meals logged.
Number of group posts remained in the second-to-last
model as an insignificant predictor of percent weight
loss. The significant variables explained 43% of the vari-
ance. For every SD increase in meals logged, percent
weight loss increased by 0.36 SDs (β=0.357, p=0.016).
Every SD increase in weigh-ins increased weight loss by
0.39 SDs (β=0.389, p=0.009). Mediation regression ana-
lyses further explained the chain of relations between
group posts, meals logged and percent weight loss.
Mediation results are illustrated in figure 2. In the first
model, path a, group posts were significantly associated
with food logging (F(1:42)=4.99, R2=0.11, p=0.031), such
that those who made group posts logged 2.33 additional
meals. Group posts were significantly associated with

 percent weight loss (F(1:41)=8.84, p=0.005) in path
c. Approximately 17% of the variance in percent weight
loss is explained by group posts, where group posts were
a significant unique predictor of percent weight loss
(β=2.54, p=0.005). In the final model, partial mediation
was shown (path b and c), (F(2,40)=12.24, p<0.001),
where the model accounted for 38% of the percent
weight loss, and group posts became a marginally signifi-
cant predictor of percent weight loss (β=1.59, p=0.052),
but
meals

remained
significant
(β=0.407,

A

test
was

(p=0.057),
suggesting
that

logging
partially
mediated the relationship between group posts and
percent weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS
This pilot study, designed to evaluate weight loss by
means of a novel NDPP intervention delivered entirely
through a smartphone platform, showed 6-month weight
loss comparable to the original NDPP and traditional
in-person
programmes.13
14
Completers
represented
84% of the sample and lost 7.01 kg (15.45 lbs, 7.50%)
body weight at 24 weeks, surpassing 5–7% weight loss
recommended by the CDC,15 and showing a high level
of acceptance and programme feasibility. Completers
also showed a trend toward higher general engagement
and weight loss.
For all users, weekly weigh-ins and meals logged were
the main predictors of weight loss, supporting the
importance of self-monitoring in weight loss. Group
posts alone were a significant predictor of percent
weight loss. Since it also remained in the second-to-last
backward regression model predicting percent weight
loss, further mediation regression analyses were per-
formed. The analyses revealed that meals logged par-
tially mediated the group posts–weight loss relationship.
This suggests that meal logging is influenced by group
behavior, which ultimately impacts weight loss. Thus, it is
important to provide individuals enrolled in a NDPP
with not only an extensive food database and ability to
log meals with ease, but also with the social support to
maximize logging behavior.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully
mobile translation of the DPP
. Web-based delivery of an
adapted NDPP resulted in high levels of engagement,
improvements in HbA1c, and similar but smaller degrees
of weight loss.4 5 Mobile health implementation of NDPP
appears to be comparable to current community-based
programmes and more flexible than web-based imple-
mentations. It addresses the major barriers facing the
widespread translation of the NDPP in the community
setting; including high fixed overhead, fixed locations,
and lower levels of engagement and weight loss. Only
one study10 adapted the NDPP to deliver the first part of
the curriculum in-person and the remaining sessions
through a mobile app, and found 6.8% weight loss at
5 months. Our findings support the effectiveness of a
uniquely mobile intervention, producing weight loss
comparable to studies with high engagement with poten-
tial for scalable population health management.
A limitation of this study is the absence of a control
group and a limited 6-month duration. However, our
results are comparable to 6-month outcomes (weight
loss and glucose) in the DPP
, which have been shown to
be predictive of 3-year diabetic risk reduction.16 Second,
this study did not measure HbA1c, but others have
found no significant changes in HbA1c at 165 or 24
weeks.10 16 A larger clinical trial of mobile DPP with an
in-person NDPP control group is recommended to
establish intervention efficacy, identify behaviors that
increase participant engagement, and assess physio-
logical markers of diabetes risk longitudinally.
In conclusion, this pilot demonstrates scalability and
feasibility of a novel mobile NDPP intervention with
weight loss comparable to online and gold standard
in-person core and postcore interventions. Future longi-
tudinal studies are warranted to verify this study’s
findings.
