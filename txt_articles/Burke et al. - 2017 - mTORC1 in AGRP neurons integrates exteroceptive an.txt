Abstract Energy dissipation through interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) thermogenesis is
an important contributor to adaptive energy expenditure. However, it remains unresolved how
acute and chronic changes in energy availability are detected by the brain to adjust iBAT activity
and maintain energy homeostasis. Here, we provide evidence that AGRP inhibitory tone to iBAT
represents an energy-sparing circuit that integrates environmental food cues and internal signals of
energy availability. We establish a role for the nutrient-sensing mTORC1 signaling pathway within
AGRP neurons in the detection of environmental food cues and internal signals of energy
availability, and in the bi-directional control of iBAT thermogenesis during nutrient deficiency and
excess. Collectively, our findings provide insights into how mTORC1 signaling within AGRP neurons
surveys energy availability to engage iBAT thermogenesis, and identify AGRP neurons as a
neuronal substrate for the coordination of energy intake and adaptive expenditure under varying
physiological and environmental contexts.

Introduction
In mammals, the maintenance of energy balance relies on a tight coordination of energy intake and
energy expenditure. Internal energy surfeit, typically achieved via maintenance on energy dense
food in a laboratory setting, promotes recruitment of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) ther-
mogenesis, increasing energy expenditure and therefore limiting weight gain (Bachman et al.,
2002; Feldmann et al., 2009). Conversely, energy expenditure is robustly decreased in energy-
restricted rodents and humans (Ravussin et al., 2012; Leibel et al., 1995). This protective mecha-
nism mitigates weight loss when environmental energy sources are limited and may contribute to
the failure of long-term maintenance of weight loss through dieting or pharmacological interven-
tions. The development of successful therapies to treat obesity therefore requires a better

 characterization of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of adaptive energy expenditure in vari-
ous contexts of energy availability.
Sympathetic nervous outflow to iBAT modulates adaptive energy expenditure by promoting iBAT
thermogenesis (Bartness et al., 2010) and is modulated by internal energy availability (Brito et al.,
2008). Melanocortinergic circuits, one of the best characterized central energy-sensing network reg-
ulating energy balance, have been implicated in the control of sympathetic outflow to iBAT
(Bartness et al., 2010; Small et al., 2003), but the exact neuronal mechanisms and energy-sensing
pathways that modulate sympathetic tone to iBAT during caloric restriction or nutrient excess have
not been identified.
Orexigenic neurons expressing agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) form a
discrete population of about 10,000 cells residing in the arcuate nucleus of the mouse hypothalamus
(ARH). These neurons respond to bidirectional changes in energy availability, are activated by fast-
ing, low glucose levels and ghrelin, and are inhibited by leptin, insulin, refeeding and high glucose
levels (Chen et al., 2015; Ko
¨nner et al., 2007). Their essential role in the bidirectional control of
energy intake can be appreciated by the aphagia observed in mice with specific ablation of this neu-
ronal population during adulthood (Luquet et al., 2005; Gropp et al., 2005), and the voracious
feeding response upon opto- or chemogenetic activation of AGRP neurons in sated mice
(Aponte et al., 2011; Krashes et al., 2011). Initial evidence indicates that AGRP neurons also regu-
late energy expenditure (Krashes et al., 2011), but the contribution of iBAT thermogenesis to this
effect, the physiological contexts in which this axis is engaged, and the mechanisms through which
AGRP neurons monitor energy availability have not been identified.
Here, we used chemogenetics to rapidly and selectively activate AGRP neurons, and demonstrate
that AGRP neurons can engage an energy-sparing circuit to iBAT that represents the integration of
metabolic interoception and environmental food-related cues. We show that mTORC1 signaling in
AGRP neurons surveys sensory food cues and internal signals of energy availability. Using inducible
lentivectors to manipulate the nutrient-sensing mTORC1 signaling pathway specifically in AGRP neu-
rons of adult normally developed mice, we show that mTORC1 signaling within AGRP neurons acts
as a bidirectional node of control that modulates the AGRP-iBAT axis. Collectively, our data describe
eLife digest Losing weight through dieting can be difficult. Weight loss strategies often prove
ineffective because the body works like a thermostat and couples what we eat to the number of
calories we burn. When we eat less, our bodies compensate and burn fewer calories, which makes
losing weight harder. The brain is the master regulator of this caloric thermostat, but it is not clear
how it adjusts our energy expenditure to account for how much we have eaten.
A structure deep within the brain called the hypothalamus, which helps regulate appetite, is
thought to be involved in the caloric thermostat. Activating a group of neurons within the
hypothalamus called the agouti-related neuropeptide (AGRP) neurons causes animals to consume
large quantities of food. By contrast, inhibiting AGRP neurons causes animals to stop eating almost
entirely.
Burke et al. studied AGRP neurons in mice. The experiments show that artificially activating the
neurons in mice that don’t have access to food increases the animals’ activity levels but reduces the
rate at which they burn calories, which helps the mice to maintain their existing weight. Allowing the
mice to eat, or even just to see and smell food, switches off this effect and returns energy
expenditure to normal. Finally, exposing mice to a high-fat diet for several days inhibits their AGRP
neurons, and causes the animals to burn calories at a faster rate. By using up excess calories, this
change also helps the animals maintain their existing body weight.
The findings of Burke et al. show that AGRP neurons are a key component of the caloric
thermostat. By adjusting the rate at which the body burns calories, AGRP neurons can compensate
for any changes in food intake and so limit changes in body weight. This work opens up the
possibility of developing therapies that disconnect energy expenditure from energy intake to help
maintain long-term weight loss.

ture under various physiological and environmental contexts.
Results
Activation of AGRP neurons rapidly inhibits sympathetic tone to iBAT
and suppresses iBAT thermogenesis
To rapidly and reversibly activate AGRP neurons, we used the stimulatory hM3dq designer receptor
exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) (Alexander et al., 2009). This receptor couples
through the Gq pathway upon exposure to the otherwise pharmacologically inert ligand clozapine-
N-oxide (CNO), leading to neuronal depolarization. Agrp-IRES-cre mice received a bilateral stereo-
tactic injection of an adeno-associated virus expressing hM3dq (AAV-hM3dq-mCherry), and were
implanted with a telemetric probe under the interscapular adipose depot to remotely monitor iBAT
temperature in behaving animals. Successful stereotactic targeting of hM3dq in AGRP neurons was
confirmed by ARH mCherry staining (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a), as well as with a functional
feeding test. Mice selected for subsequent studies ate at least 2-fold more during the first hour fol-
lowing the CNO injection as compared to the vehicle injection (Figure 1—figure supplement 1b).
Previous reports indicate that chemogenetic activation of AGRP neurons rapidly increases food
intake and suppresses oxygen consumption (Krashes et al., 2011). To determine the direct effect of
AGRP activation on adaptive energy expenditure independently of energy intake, we tested the
effect of AGRP activation on iBAT temperature and energy expenditure in mice that were food
deprived for 2 hr, followed by an ip injection of CNO or vehicle without access to food following the
injection (Design 1). As expected, activation of AGRP neurons rapidly suppressed iBAT temperature
(Figure 1a) and energy expenditure (Figure 1b) despite increasing locomotor activity (Figure 1c)
when mice were maintained in a food-free environment following CNO administration. Local admin-
istration of ghrelin, an endogenous activator of AGRP neurons, into the mediobasal hypothalamus
(MBH) of wild-type mice decreased iBAT temperature (Figure 1—figure supplement 1c), support-
ing the physiological relevance of this effect.
We investigated the mechanisms mediating the rapid fall in iBAT thermogenic activity following
AGRP neuronal activation by first assessing sympathetic outflow to iBAT. iBAT norepinephrine turn-
over (NETO) was measured using the a-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) method. In CNO-treated mice,
iBAT NETO was significantly lower than in vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1d), supporting the conclu-
sion that AGRP activation rapidly suppresses sympathetic output to iBAT. In contrast, circulating thy-
roxine (T4) and FGF-21 levels remained unchanged during the first 45 min following CNO
administration (Figure 1—figure supplement 1d and e), ruling out the contribution of these hor-
mones in the rapid decrease in iBAT thermogenesis following AGRP neuronal activation. Consistent
with previous reports (Ruan et al., 2014), we did not observe any changes in iBAT expression of
thermogenic genes within an acute 1 hr time-frame following CNO administration (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1f). These results indicate that iBAT recruitment is not involved in the rapid decrease in
iBAT temperature observed as soon as 1 hr after AGRP neuronal activation.
We examined the activation status of signaling pathways downstream from b3-adrenergic recep-
tor in iBAT 1 hr after CNO administration. We did not detect changes in the expression or activation
status of PKA, CREB, perilipin, UCP-1 or in the activating phosphorylation of HSL on Ser660 (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1g). In contrast, inhibitory phosphorylation of HSL on Ser565 was signifi-
cantly increased in the iBAT of CNO-treated mice (Figure 1e). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
is inhibited by b3-adrenergic signaling in iBAT and has been reported to phosphorylate HSL on
Ser565 phosphorylation (Anthony et al., 2009; Pulinilkunnil et al., 2011). This led us to hypothesize
that decreased sympathetic tone to iBAT in response to AGRP activation may activate AMPK and
reduce iBAT thermogenesis via an increase in HSL inhibitory phosphorylation on Ser565. Accordingly,
we observed a robust increase in AMPK activatory phosphorylation in the iBAT of CNO-treated mice
(Figure 1e). iBAT thermogenesis is an important contributor to thermoregulation in mice housed at
ambient temperature. To determine whether activation of AGRP neurons affect thermoregulation,
we simultaneously monitored iBAT and core temperature during AGRP chemogenetic activation. At
baseline and in vehicle-treated animals, iBAT temperature was consistently 1˚C higher than core

 temperature (Figure 1—figure supplement 1h). Upon CNO administration, iBAT temperature fall
rapidly and reached core temperature within 15 min, indicating that suppression of iBAT thermogen-
esis under these conditions is driving iBAT and core temperature responses. We then tested whether
the control of iBAT thermogenesis by AGRP neurons was independent of thermoregulation, and
repeated these experiments in mice maintained in the thermoneutral zone (30˚C), a condition under
which thermoregulatory thermogenesis is abolished. Under these conditions, the effects of AGRP
activation on iBAT temperature, energy expenditure and locomotor activity were attenuated, but
remained statistically significant (Figure 1f–h). This result further directly implicates iBAT thermo-
genic activity in the response to AGRP activation and indicates that the AGRP-iBAT circuit can be
engaged independently of thermoregulation. At 4˚C, a condition under which thermoregulatory
iBAT thermogenesis is strongly activated (Brito et al., 2008), AGRP neuronal activation reduced
iBAT temperature to a similar extent as at ambient temperature (Figure 1—figure supplement 1i),

 reinforcing the idea that the dynamic range of AGRP-iBAT circuit function is dissociable from envi-
ronmental temperature and cold-induced thermoregulation. Thus, activation of AGRP neurons
increases locomotor activity and produces a substantial sustained decrease in energy expenditure
through a suppression of iBAT thermogenic activity.
The regulation of iBAT thermogenesis by AGRP neurons depends on
food availability and is modulated by sensory cues of environmental
food availability
To better characterize the relationship between the control of energy intake and energy expenditure
in response to AGRP neuronal activation, we performed experiments in mice that had access to
food following CNO administration (Design 2). Under these conditions, activation of AGRP neurons
increased locomotor activity and energy intake but failed to alter iBAT temperature and energy
expenditure (Figure 2a–c), indicating that energy availability modulates the AGRP-iBAT circuit.
To test whether internal signals of energy availability were sufficient to blunt the response to
CNO, mice were fasted overnight and refed before receiving an injection of CNO or vehicle, and
then placed in food-free clean cages immediately after the injection (Design 3). In that context,
AGRP neuronal activation suppressed iBAT temperature and energy expenditure (Figure 2d–2f),
suggesting that internal signals of energy availability are not sufficient to blunt the AGRP-iBAT hypo-
metabolic response.
We noticed that iBAT temperature and energy expenditure were rapidly restored in CNO-treated
mice upon food reintroduction in design 1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b), suggesting
that the presence of food rapidly resets the AGRP-iBAT circuit. To directly test the role of environ-
mental cues of food availability in AGRP inhibitory tone to iBAT, we repeated this experiment in
mice kept in clean food-free cages after CNO administration and transiently exposed to food sen-
sory stimuli. Specifically, we introduced chow pellets in a container that allowed food to be seen and
smelled but not consumed (caged-food). This paradigm was recently found to rapidly inhibit AGRP
neurons in hungry mice (Chen et al., 2015). Presenting caged-food to CNO-treated mice rapidly
increased iBAT temperature (Figure 2g) and energy expenditure (Figure 2h) to levels similar to
those measured in controls, an effect that was transient and lasted for about 1 hr. Importantly, pre-
sentation of an inedible empty container to naı
¨ve animals failed to alter iBAT temperature and
energy expenditure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–d), indicating that the stress response to the
introduction of an object to naı
¨ve mice is not sufficient to produce the restoration in iBAT tempera-
ture seen with presentation of food sensory cues. Again, we observed that CNO administration
increased locomotor activity (Figure 2i) despite reducing energy expenditure and iBAT temperature.
These results indicate that pre-ingestive food detection is sufficient to apprehensively turn off the
AGRP-iBAT circuit suppressing iBAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Thus, the AGRP-iBAT
circuit integrates sensory and endogenous signals of energy availability in the regulation of iBAT
thermogenic activity and energy expenditure to promote energy sparing when fuel availability is
scarce.
mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons responds to acute and chronic
signals of energy abundance and environmental cues of food
availability
AGRP neurons are essential to the control of energy balance and ideally positioned within and
around the median eminence to detect circulating signals of energy availability. However, little is
known about the intracellular energy-sensing signaling pathways coupling energy availability to neu-
ronal activity in AGRP neurons. The energy-sensing mTORC1 pathway is an evolutionary-conserved
neuronal nutritional and hormonal sensor that regulates hunger-driven eating and foraging
(Cota et al., 2006; Blouet and Schwartz, 2012), two behaviors regulated by AGRP neurons
(Aponte et al., 2011; Krashes et al., 2011; Teubner et al., 2012). We hypothesized that energy
sensing through mTORC1 in AGRP neurons monitors internal energy availability to coordinate adap-
tive energy expenditure.
We first tested whether the activity of mTOR in NPY/AGRP neurons is modulated by a refeeding
episode. This nutritional transition is associated with a rapid inhibition of AGRP neurons (Chen et al.,
2015), an activation of iBAT thermogenic activity and an increase in energy expenditure (Figure 3—

 figure supplement 1a and b). We used immunofluorescence to detect the active form of mTOR
phosphorylated at Ser2448 (p-mTOR) in hypothalamic slices. Rapamycin suppressed p-mTOR expres-
sion (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c), confirming the specificity of this staining. Refeeding for 1 hr
following an overnight fast significantly increased p-mTOR expression in ARH NPY neurons
(Figure 3a and d). Importantly, p-mTOR activation following refeeding occurs only in 15% of ARH

 NPY/AGRP neurons, supporting the conclusion that postprandial changes in energy availability is
coupled to changes in mTOR signaling only in a subpopulation of ARH NPY/AGRP neurons. Cos-
tained neurons were mostly absent from the rostral ARH (�1.22 to �1.6 mm post Bregma
[Paxinos and Franklin, 2001]) and concentrated in the ventro-medial neurons of the caudal ARH
(�1.7 mm to �2 mm post bregma [Paxinos and Franklin, 2001]) (Figure 3—figure supplement
1d).
Another metabolic context associated with a rapid activation of iBAT thermogenesis is exposure
to a high fat (HF) diet (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004). We confirmed that after 2 days of HF feed-
ing, iBAT thermogenesis was increased (Figure 3—figure supplement 1e and f) leading to an
increase in energy expenditure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1g), as previously reported (Liu et al.,
2014). We observed that mTOR signaling was also upregulated in NPY/AGRP neurons in this con-
text, again only in a small group of this neuronal population (Figure 3b and e). These data indicate
that in nutritional conditions under which iBAT thermogenic activity is engaged, mTOR activity is
increased in a subpopulation of AGRP/NPY neurons in which metabolic signals are coupled to
changes in mTOR signaling. These findings raise the possibility that mTOR in AGRP neurons mediate
changes in sympathetic tone to iBAT under these conditions.
Given our observations that the inhibition of iBAT thermogenesis induced by AGRP neuronal acti-
vation is abolished in the presence of food, we sought to assess whether hypothalamic mTOR signal-
ing is also sensitive to food sensory stimuli. We first measured p-mTOR expression in NPY/AGRP
neurons of overnight fasted mice exposed for 30 min to an empty contained or caged food. In con-
trol mice exposed to an empty container, p-mTOR was absent from ARH NPY-GFP neurons
(Figure 3c and f). In contrast, 30% ARH NPY-GFP neurons expressed p-mTOR in response to 30 min
exposure to caged food. These data indicate that mTOR signaling in AGRP neurons, in addition to
responding to acute (refeeding) and chronic (48 hr HF feeding) internal signals of energy availability,
also responds to environmental food-related cues.
MBH mTORC1 signaling modulates AGRP neuronal activity and iBAT
thermogenesis
To directly probe the link between mTOR activity and AGRP neuronal activity, we treated refed
Npy-GFP mice with rapamycin, a well-characterized mTORC1 inhibitor, and quantified the expres-
sion of the marker of neuronal activation c-fos in Npy -GFP cells. Rapamycin increased the expres-
sion of cfos in Npy -GFP neurons (Figure 3g and h), supporting the interpretation that mTORC1
signaling negatively regulates the activity of AGRP/NPY neurons.
We then tested whether acute changes in mTORC1 activity in AGRP neurons modulate iBAT ther-
mogenesis using nanoinjections of activators and inhibitors of the mTORC1 pathway into the MBH
of wild-type mice. Rapamycin diluted in 100% DMSO was administered into the hypothalamic paren-
chyma in nanovolumes to acutely activate mTORC1 signaling. Rapamycin-mediated inhibition of
MBH mTORC1 in refed mice significantly reduced iBAT temperature (Figure 3i), energy expenditure
(Figure 3j), and altered iBAT thermogenic gene expression (Figure 3k) without significantly affecting
locomotor activity (Figure 3—figure supplement 1h). Of note, although this DMSO concentration
may induce cellular stress responses, the low volume bolus we injected did not produce noticeable
changes in behavior, locomotor activity, energy intake and energy expenditure compared to non-
injected mice under the same conditions (not shown). Conversely, activation of MBH mTORC1 using
the amino acid L-leucine produced an increase in iBAT temperature in fasted mice (Figure 3l) but
did not produce changes in energy expenditure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1i). Thus, acute

Constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons increases
iBAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure and protects against diet-
induced obesity
To directly test the role of increased mTORC1 signaling specifically in AGRP neurons in the control
of iBAT thermogenesis, we generated a lentivector expressing a constitutively active mutant of the
mTORC1 effector p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in a cre-dependent manner (pCDH-CMV-FLEX-HA-S6K1-
F5a). We delivered the pCDH-CMV-FLEX-HA-S6K1-F5a vector into the ARH of normally-developed
adult Agrp-IRES-cre or WT mice (mice subsequently referred to as Agrp-CA-S6 and WT-CA-S6) using
stereotactic nanoinjections. Agrp-IRES-cre;Npy-gfp were used to validate the construct. Ha staining
indicated that over 95% of the cells expressing the construct were Npy-GFP neurons and that over
60% of Npy-GFP cells expressed the construct (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). Increased expres-
sion of the active form of ribosomal protein S6 (phosphorylated at Ser 240–244, p-rpS6, main down-
stream effector of S6K) in ARH Npy-GFP neurons confirmed constitutive activation of the pathway in
AGRP neurons of Agrp-CA-S6 mice compared to controls (Figure 4—figure supplement 1b).
Constitutive activation of S6K1 in AGRP neurons had no effect on food intake (Figure 4a), body
weight gain (Figure 4—figure supplement 1c), adiposity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1d) or glu-
cose tolerance (Figure 4—figure supplement 1e) when mice were maintained on a chow diet. Given
the crucial role of AGRP neurons in feeding behavior and survival (Luquet et al., 2005), these results
indicate that manipulation of mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons does not produce loss of AGRP
function.
Upon exposure to a HF diet, Agrp-CA-S6 mice were protected against body weight gain
(Figure 4b). We performed a detailed characterization of energy balance during the transition from
chow to HF diet. Constitutive activation of S6K1 in AGRP neurons did not affect energy intake
(Figure 4a) but produced a significant increase in night-time energy expenditure under HF diet
(Figure 4c). The specific implication of energy expenditure in this metabolic phenotype, and the
preservation of feeding behavior, support the conclusion that chronic changes in S6K1 signaling in
AGRP neurons do not produce an overall change in AGRP activity, but rather modulate the activity
of a specific subpopulation of AGRP neurons regulating energy expenditure. Substrate utilization
was similar between groups on chow but fat utilization was substantially increased after the switch to
the HF diet in Agrp-CA-S6 mice (Figure 4d). Likewise, locomotor activity significantly increased in
Agrp-CA-S6 mice after the transition to the HF diet (Figure 4e). Night-time iBAT temperature was
significantly increased in Agrp-CA-S6 mice (Figure 4f) and consistently, mRNA expression of iBAT
thermogenic markers was increased (Figure 4g), suggesting a role for increased iBAT activation in
the elevated energy expenditure and reduced weight gain observed in these mice. The amplitude of
iBAT thermogenic response to b-adrenergic stimulation was similar between groups (Figure 4h).
This indicates that elevated iBAT thermogenesis in Agrp-IRES-cre mice was not the result of an
impairment in iBAT responsiveness to sympathetic activation. Instead, increased iBAT norepineph-
rine turnover in AGRP-CA-S6 mice compared to control indicated increased sympathetic tone to
iBAT following constitutive activation of S6K in AGRP neurons (Figure 4i; NETO: �0.75 pM/mg/h vs.
�1.26 pM/mg/h in WT-CA-S6 and AGRP-CA-S6 respectively, p<0.05). Constitutive activation of
S6K1 in AGRP neurons also increased iBAT temperature (Figure 4j) energy expenditure (Figure 4k)
during a fast resulting in enhanced body weight loss (Figure 4l). Postprandial increases in iBAT ther-
mogenesis and energy expenditure were also higher in mice expressing constitutively active S6K1 in
AGRP neurons (Figure 4l and m). Thus, constitutive activation of S6K signaling in AGRP neurons of
adult normally developed mice protect against diet-induced weight gain through an increase in sym-
pathetic tone to iBAT and an increase in iBAT thermogenesis.
Inhibition of endogenous mTORC1 in AGRP neurons reduces iBAT
thermogenesis and energy expenditure and promotes HF-induced
weight gain
In order to investigate the role of endogenous mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neuronal control of
energy homeostasis, we generated a lentivector expressing a kinase dead mutant of the S6K1 in a

mally developed adult Agrp-IRES-cre mice or wild-type littermates through local stereotatic nanoin-
jections (Agrp-DN-S6 and WT-DN-S6). Agrp-IRES-cre;Npy-gfp were used to validate the construct.
Ha staining indicated that over 95% of the cells expressing the construct were Npy-GFP neurons and
that over 40% of Npy-GFP cells expressed the construct (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a).
Decreased expression of p-rpS6 in ARH Npy-GFP neurons confirmed inhibition of the pathway in
AGRP neurons of Agrp-DN-S6 mice compared to controls (Figure 5—figure supplement 1b).
Quenching endogenous S6K1 in AGRP neurons produced changes in energy expenditure recipro-
cal to those observed following constitutive activation of the pathway. These were not sufficient to
affect body weight gain during chow maintenance (Figure 5—figure supplement 1c) but produced
a significant decrease in energy expenditure (Figure 5a), locomotor activity (Figure 5b), iBAT tem-
perature (Figure 5c), and iBAT thermogenic gene expression (Figure 5d) after switch to a HF diet.
Downregulation of S6K1 activity in AGRP neurons only produced a modest reduction in weight gain

 during the initial switch to HFD (Figure 5e) during which time we did not observe any differences in
food intake (Figure 5f) or RER (Figure 5—figure supplement 1d). However, we observed a reduc-
tion in food intake in DN-S6K mice 4 days after the introduction of the HF diet (Figure 5f), an effect
that likely occurred secondary to reduced energy expenditure and mitigated changes in weight
gain.
To further characterize energy expenditure without the confound of energy intake, we challenged
these mice with an overnight fast. Despite showing no difference in body weight under ad libitum
access to food, Agrp-DN-S6 mice lose significantly less weight than wild-type controls during an
overnight fast (Figure 5g), indicating increased energy efficiency in these mice. Consistently, energy
expenditure was lower in Agrp-DN-S6 mice throughout the fast (Figure 5h). In addition, postpran-
dial increases in energy expenditure (Figure 5h) during the subsequent refeed was lower. Last, body
weight gain at thermoneutrality was significantly higher in Agrp-DN-S6 mice than in controls
(Figure 5i). Collectively, these data indicate that downregulation of S6K signaling in AGRP neurons
leads to a decrease in energy expenditure mediated at least in part by a decrease in iBAT thermo-
genesis, which leads to a significant increase in body weight gain when mice are maintained at
thermoneutrality.

 mTORC1 in AGRP neurons mediates the thermogenic effect of leptin
Central leptin engages the sympathetic nervous system to increase iBAT thermogenesis through the
activation of distributed leptin-receptor expressing neurons in the DMH, nMPO, NTS and ARH. Sev-
eral lines of evidence support a role for leptin receptors in the ARH in leptin-induced activation of
iBAT (Rahmouni and Morgan, 2007; Harlan et al., 2011). In the adult brain, leptin inhibits the vast
majority of AGRP neurons (Baquero et al., 2014). However, leptin-induced hyperpolarization of
AGRP neurons has not been implicated in leptin-induced increase in sympathetic tone to iBAT. Previ-
ous work implicated hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling in leptin’s effects on energy balance
(Cota et al., 2006; Blouet et al., 2008). Thus, we hypothesized that leptin activates mTORC1 signal-
ing in AGRP neurons, leading to an increase in sympathetic tone to iBAT.
To test this hypothesis, we first colocalized markers of mTORC1 signaling in NPY/AGRP neurons
30 min following leptin administration. Leptin increased the expression of p-mTOR (Figure 6a and c)
and the expression of the active form of one of its effectors, ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6,
Figure 6b and d) in NPY/AGRP neurons. As expected, leptin increased expression of pSTAT3 in
NPY/AGRP neurons, and we observed that 40% of pSTAT-3+ NPY/AGRP neurons also expressed
the active form of rpS6.
We then measured leptin’s thermogenic effect in mice with bidirectional modulations of S6K1 sig-
naling in AGRP neurons. Leptin’s effects on temperature were attenuated in Agrp-CA-S6 mice com-
pared to wild-type controls (Figure 6e). While both groups reached a similar absolute temperature
increase following ip leptin, the relative change in temperature was significantly lower in the Agrp-
CA-S6 mice due to their elevated core temperature at baseline. Together these data suggest that
lack of flexibility in mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons impairs leptin’s thermogenic action. Leptin’s
thermogenic effect was completely abolished in Agrp-DN-S6 mice (Figure 6f), indicating that S6K1
signaling in AGRP neurons is required for leptin’s thermogenic action.

 Discussion
Activation of AGRP neurons has been established as an essential component in the initiation of
feeding behavior (Aponte et al., 2011; Krashes et al., 2011). Here, we demonstrate that the multi-
modal contribution of AGRP neurons to the maintenance of energy balance includes the regulation
of iBAT thermogenesis. We show that activation of AGRP neurons induces a rapid suppression of
sympathetic output to iBAT, as previously reported (Steculorum et al., 2016), leading to a decrease
in iBAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure. We show that the AGRP-iBAT circuit is selectively
engaged to spare internal energy stores in the absence of food and food sensory cues, supporting
the notion that AGRP neurons integrate external and internal signals of energy availability to coordi-
nate energy intake and expenditure in conditions of low energy availability. We provide evidence
that this regulation also occurs at thermoneutrality and is therefore potentially relevant to human
physiology. We identify the mTORC1 signaling pathway as an intracellular mechanism through which
AGRP neurons monitor external and internal energy availability, and demonstrate that mTORC1 sig-
naling modulates AGRP activity, sympathetic tone to iBAT, iBAT thermogenesis and energy expendi-
ture. Last, we show that metabolic sensing via mTORC1 in AGRP neurons is required for the
regulation of energy expenditure both during nutritional transitions from fasting to feeding and dur-
ing adaptation to HF feeding. Our data provide a physiological framework for the role of AGRP neu-
rons in the control of adaptive thermogenesis and the coordination of energy intake and energy
expenditure, and represent the first characterization of the functional consequences of AGRP sen-
sory integration in the regulation of energy balance.
A

implicated
AGRP
neurons
in
the
regulation
of
energy
expenditure
(Krashes et al., 2011). In that study, chemogenetic activation of AGRP neurons produced a rapid
reduction in oxygen consumption. Although the effector mediating this decrease had not been
investigated, these results are in line with our findings and support a role for AGRP neurons in the
regulation of energy expenditure. However, the reduction in oxygen consumption occurred in the
presence of food, which conflicts with our findings but may result from differences in experimental
conditions. In our experimental paradigm, animals were all adapted to the experimental environ-
ment for 2 hr in the morning before CNO administration, a period during which they had no access
to food or food-related sensory cues. We restored access to food immediately after CNO adminis-
tration, whereas in the Krashes paper, food was present before and after the injection. This suggests
that changes in environmental food availability via food presentation are necessary to inhibit the
AGRP-iBAT circuit, and that environmental food cues do not maintain a tonic inhibition of AGRP
neurons. This interpretation is in fact consistent with our observation that caged-food only transiently
blunts AGRP-induced suppression of energy expenditure and iBAT temperature.
In a study using capsaicin-dependent chemogenetic activation of AGRP neurons, activation of
AGRP neurons produced a modest and transient decrease in energy expenditure that was attributed
to a rapid suppression of inguinal WAT (iWAT) browning (Ruan et al., 2014). These authors ruled
out a role for iBAT in this effect based on the lack of change in iBAT thermogenic gene expression
(Ruan et al., 2014). This latter observation is consistent with (Steculorum et al., 2016), our results,
and a reported half-life of 30–72 hr of UCP1 protein in iBAT (Clarke et al., 2012). Nonetheless, our
data indicate that iBAT temperature can rapidly decrease following AGRP neuronal activation
through activation of sympathetic signaling to iBAT and decreased activation of HSL, an enzyme
implicated in fatty acid mobilization and heat production from iBAT. We can not exclude that a
decrease in UCP1 expression in iWAT may contribute to the rapid decrease in energy expenditure
observed following AGRP neuronal activation. However, we report an average decrease in energy
expenditure of 8 J/min at ambient temperature (25% decrease compare to controls and baseline lev-
els). While iBAT thermogenesis can account for this portion of energy expenditure in mice housed at
ambient temperature (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011), current knowledge does not indicate that it
is the case for beige adipocyte (Nedergaard and Cannon, 2013) further supporting a major role of
iBAT inhibition in the decrease in energy expenditure induced by AGRP neuronal activation.
Recently, AGRP neurons have been implicated in the regulation of insulin sensitivity via iBAT myo-
statin expression (Steculorum et al., 2016). This work extends the orchestration of the metabolic
adaptations to energy deficit by AGRP neurons to include a suppression of peripheral glucose
uptake, which may serve as a glucose sparing process to protect the brain from hypoglycemia in
conditions of low energy availability.

 The neurochemistry and neuroanatomical circuits underpinning AGRP neuronal regulation of iBAT
remain to be fully characterized. Circuits downstream from AGRP neurons previously implicated in
the modulation iBAT thermogenesis include NPYergic (Shi et al., 2013), melanocortinergic
(Small et al., 2003; Berglund et al., 2014; Brito et al., 2007), and GABA-ergic circuits (Tong et al.,
2008). This diversity may underlie the coexistence of multiple circuits engaged under different meta-
bolic situations or within different time frames (Krashes et al., 2011), to adjust iBAT thermogenic
function in response to changes in AGRP tone. Consistent with the idea that multiple circuits may
contribute to the AGRP-iBAT axis, AGRP projections to the LH and the anterior bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis have both been shown to mediate the effect of AGRP neurons on iBAT myostatin
expression (Steculorum et al., 2016). Interestingly, although the paraventricular nucleus of the hypo-
thalamus (PVH) receives dense axonal input from AGRP neurons (Haskell-Luevano et al., 1999) and
has been implicated in the regulation of sympathetic output to iBAT (Kong et al., 2012;
Morrison and Madden, 2014), AGRP projections to the PVH do not modulate iBAT myostatin
expression. While a large proportion of PVH neurons negatively regulate iBAT thermogenesis
(Kong et al., 2012; Madden and Morrison, 2009), PVH oxytocin neurons positively regulate sympa-
thetic tone to iBAT (Morrison and Madden, 2014) and have been implicated in diet-induced ther-
mogenesis (Wu et al., 2012). However, whether AGRP neurons project to PVH oxytocin neurons is
not clear (Atasoy et al., 2014; Garfield et al., 2015). PVH TH neurons represent an alternative pop-
ulation that may be involved in the AGRP-iBAT axis, as tonic inhibition from ARH NPY neurons to
PVH TH neurons via Y1R signaling has also recently been implicated in the control of iBAT thermo-
genesis (Shi et al., 2013). DMH neurons may alternatively or concomitantly mediate the effect of
AGRP neuronal activation on iBAT thermogenesis, as the DMH is a major source of sympathoexcita-
tory input to medullary iBAT sympathetic premotor neurons in rRPa (Morrison and Madden, 2014),
and GABAergic inhibitory tone to the DMH suppresses iBAT thermogenesis (Cao et al., 2004), rais-
ing the possibility that iBAT-regulating GABAergic input to the DMH originates from AGRP neurons.
Ghrelin is a well-established endogenous activator of AGRP neurons and the ghrelin receptor is
predominantly expressed in AGRP neurons in the ARH (Willesen et al., 1999). Our observation that
parenchymal administration of ghrelin in the ARH reproduces the effects of AGRP neuronal activa-
tion on iBAT temperature supports the physiological relevance of the AGRP-iBAT circuit. While the
contribution of iBAT thermogenesis to the metabolic effects of ghrelin has been previously reported
(Tsubone et al., 2005; Yasuda et al., 2003), the neuroanatomical sites responsible for this effect
had not been identified. Together with the published literature implicating AGRP neurons in the
orexigenic effects of ghrelin (Wang et al., 2014; Andrews et al., 2008), our data lend strength to
the idea that AGRP neurons coordinate the feeding and metabolic effects of ghrelin.
Our findings establish a role for mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons in the detection of sensory
and metabolic signals of energy availability and the regulation of the AGRP-iBAT axis. These findings
may seem conflicting with a previous report showing increased ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) signaling
in AGRP neurons of fasted mice (Villanueva et al., 2009). In fact, rpS6 signaling receives activatory
inputs from many neuronal signaling pathways, is now acknowledged as a marker of neuronal activa-
tion (Knight et al., 2012) and therefore represents an inappropriate surrogate marker of mTORC1
signaling in this context. Our data support instead that mTORC1 activation in AGRP neurons nega-
tively regulates AGRP activity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that increased mTORC1 signaling
in AGRP neurons contributes to diet-induced thermogenesis during early exposure to HF feeding
and protects against diet-induced obesity (DIO). Consistent with these findings, acute HF feeding
has been shown to increase S6K1 activity (Cota et al., 2008) and reduce AGRP signaling
(Ziotopoulou et al., 2000).
While there is convincing evidence that acute and chronic energy excess result in increased
energy expenditure in rodents (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004) and humans (Ravussin et al.,
2014; Vosselman et al., 2013), the nature of the signals mediating these effects is unclear and may
include specific nutrients and/or caloric load per se. Interestingly, the lack of effect of increased
mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons under chow maintenance reveals that activation of this pathway
is not sufficient to modulate energy balance, and suggests that its contribution to energy expendi-
ture is contingent on energy surfeit. Controversy persists on the role of leptin during energy surfeit
in diet-induced hypermetabolism humans (Heymsfield et al., 1999; Mackintosh and Hirsch, 2001),
and recent data revealed novel mechanisms through which leptin modulates core temperature inde-
pendently of energy expenditure (Fischer et al., 2016). Nevertheless, in rodents, leptin increases

 sympathetic output to iBAT, oxygen consumption and iBAT temperature (Morrison, 2004;
Enriori et al., 2011; Rahmouni and Morgan, 2007), and neuroanatomical and functional studies
indicate that activation of central leptinergic circuits can rapidly increase iBAT thermogenesis
(Yu et al., 2016). Our study identifies AGRP neurons as a novel neurochemical population implicated
in leptin’s thermogenic action, although they do not directly implicate iBAT thermogenesis in the
thermogenic response to leptin.
Previous work investigating the role of hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling support the prediction
that modulation of S6K1 in AGRP neurons would affect food intake (Cota et al., 2006; Blouet et al.,
2008). The failure to observe any effect on feeding in our different experimental paradigms indicates
that chronic changes in mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons are not sufficient to alter energy intake.
This does not preclude a contribution of this pathway in the acute control of feeding behavior. In
fact, we observe that rapamycin rapidly activates AGRP neurons in refed mice, and under similar
conditions hypothalamic rapamycin has been shown to rapidly increase foraging and food intake
(Cota et al., 2006). Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin selectively suppresses iBAT temperature
and energy expenditure in the absence of food, precisely mirroring the metabolic effects of AGRP
neuronal activation. Interestingly, we observed that only a portion of AGRP neurons expresses active
mTORC1 following a refeed or 2 days of HF feeding, indicating that the mTORC1 pathway is nutri-
tionally regulated selectively in a subset of this neuronal population. Our findings contrast with other
models of altered mTORC1 signaling in AGRP neurons, in which neonatal deletion of S6K1 or raptor
in AGRP neurons failed to affect energy balance (Smith et al., 2015; Albert et al., 2015). Impor-
tantly, in contrast to the aforementioned studies, our model identifies the role of mTORC1 signaling
in AGRP neurons in the physiology of mice with normally-developed hypothalamic circuits.
Altogether, our studies uncover a role for mTORC1 signaling within AGRP neurons in surveying
energy availability to engage iBAT thermogenesis and identify AGRP neurons as a neuronal sub-
strate for the coordination of energy intake and adaptive expenditure under various physiological
contexts.
Materials and methods
Animals
All mice were group-housed unless otherwise stated and maintained in individually ventilated cages
with standard bedding and enrichment. Mice were maintained in a temperature and humidity-con-
trolled room on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory
chow diet or HF diet D12266B, 31.8% kcal as fat, 4.4 kcal/g, Research Diets) unless otherwise stated.
Agrp-IRES-cre mice were genotyped with the following primers: 50-GGGCCCTAAGTTGAGTTTTCC
T-30; 50-GATTACCCAACCTGGGCAGAAC-30 and 50-GGGTCGCTACAGACGTTGTTTG-30. All experi-
ments were carried on heterozygous Agrp-IRES-cre mice and their wild-type littermates. Npy-GFP
mice were genotyped with the following primers: 5’-TATGTGGACGGGGCAGAAGATCCAGG-3’; 5’-
CCCAGCTCACAT ATTTATCTAGAG-3’; 5’-GGTGCGGTTGCCGTACTGGA-3’. Npy-GFP/Agrp-IRES-
Cre mice were obtained by crossing homozygous Npy-GFP mice with homozygous Agrp-IRES-Cre
mice. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986 and approved by the local animal ethic committees.
Surgical procedures
Surgical procedures were performed under isofluorane anesthesia, and all animals received Metacam
prior to the surgery, 24 hr after surgery and were allowed a 1 week recovery period during which
they were acclimatized to injection procedures. Mice were stereotactically implanted with bilateral
steel guide cannulae (Plastics One) positioned 1 mm above the ARH (A/P: �1.1 mm, D/V: �4.9 mm,
lateral: +0.4 mm from Bregma), as previously described (Blouet et al., 2012). Beveled stainless steel
injectors (33 gauge) extending 1 mm from the tip of the guide were used for injections. All viral brain
injections were performed on 11 week old mice at 100 nl/min, 500 nl/side (lentivectors, 1–2 � 109
pfu/ml) and 200 nl/side (AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, UNC Vector Core, 1 � 1012 pfu/ml).
For chronic cannulae implantation, cannula guide was secured in place with Loctite glue and dental
cement (Fujicem). Correct targeting was confirmed histologically postmortem (placement of cannula
guide track) or using mCherry immunofluorescent staining. Temperature telemetric probe (IPTT-300,

subsequent functional studies were performed in a crossover randomized manner on age- and
weight-matched groups after 1 week recovery and 1 week daily acclimatization, and at least 4 days
elapsed between each injection.
Preparation of lentiviral plasmids
pRK7-HA-F5A (Addgene 8986) and pRK7-HA-KR (Addgene 8985) were a gift from John Blenis
(Schalm and Blenis, 2002). pRK7-HA-F5A and pRK7-HA-KR were digested with XbaI followed by a
fill-in reaction for blunt end ligation and a digestion with EcoRI to isolate the HA-F5A and HA-KR
constructs. A lentiviral construct previously developed to express hTXNIP in a cre-dependent manner
(Blouet et al., 2012), pCDH-CMV-FLEX-hTXNIP, was digested with Xho-1 followed by a fill-in reac-
tion for blunt end ligation and a digestion with EcoR1 to isolate the pCDH-CMV-FLEX vector. The
two inserts were ligated to the pCDH-CMV-FLEX lentivector to produce pCDH-CMV-FLEX-Ha-S6K1-
F5A and pCDH-CMV-FLEX-Ha-S6K1-KR. Several clones were screened using One Shot Stbl3 E Coli
competent cells (ThermoFisher and verified by sequencing. Plasmids were subsequently used for
packaging reactions to generate viral stocks suitable for transfection by System Bioscience (Moun-
tain View, CA). Cre-dependent expression of S6K1 constructs was confirmed in HEK293T cells
(ATCC, negative for mycoplasma contamination) transfected with a pCAG-Cre-IRES2-GFP plasmid, a
gift from Dr. Anjen Chenn’s lab (Addgene 26646).
Metabolic phenotyping
AGRP chemogenetic activation
On the day of the procedure, mice housed in their home cage were acclimatized to the procedure
room and food deprived during the 2 hr preceding the injections. Mice received CNO (Sigma, 1 mg/
kg) or vehicle and were maintained in a food-free cage for the four following hours unless otherwise
stated. iBAT, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous temperature were measured using remote bioteleme-
try (IPTT-300 Bio Medic Data Systems). Energy expenditure was assessed using indirect calorimetry
in a Metabolic-Trace system (Meta-Trace, Ideas Studio, UK).
Brain injections
For ghrelin or leucine injection studies, mice housed in their home cage were acclimatized to the
procedure room and food deprived during the 2 hr preceding the injections. Mice received bilateral
parenchymal nanoinjection of ghrelin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, 1 mg/ml, 100 nl/side, 100 nl/min),
L-leucine (Sigma, 2.1 mM, 100 nl/side, 100 nl/min) or aCSF (R and D), were immediately returned to
their home cage, and iBAT temperature and energy expenditure were monitored as described
above. For rapamycin injection studies, mice were fasted overnight, re-fed for 1 hr in the morning,
nanoinjected with rapamycin or DMSO (Merck Millipore, 5 mM, 150 nl/side), placed in clean, food-
free cages, and iBAT temperature and energy expenditure were monitored as described above.
Oral glucose tolerance
Glucose tolerance was measured on body-weight matched animals. Mice were food deprived for 6
hr and blood was sampled from tail vein immediately prior to glucose bolus (gavage, 1 mg/kg), and
15, 30, 60 and 120 min following bolus administration. Blood glucose was analyzed using a glucome-
ter (Precision Xtra; MediSense).
Body composition analysis
Body composition was determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using an Echo MRS
instrument (Echo Medical Systems).
CL challenge
After blood collection for basal measurements, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg
BW
CL316243
(5-[(2R)-2-[[(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-
2,2-dicarboxylic acid disodium salt; Sigma), a b3 adrenergic agonist. Brown fat temperature was
monitored as described above, over the 60 min after the CL316243 injection, and brown fat temper-
ature change over that time period was calculated.

 Leptin challenge
Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of leptin (5 mg/kg, R&D) or saline 1 hr before the onset of
the dark, and iBAT temperature, 24 hr body weight gain and 24 hr food intake were measured.
RT-qPCR
qPCR was carried out as previously described (Burke and Heisler, 2015). Total RNA was purified
from interscapular iBAT using RNA STAT 60 (AMS Biotechnology, Abington, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of 500 ng iBAT RNA. PCR
of cDNA was performed in duplicate on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system using Taq-
man Gene expression assay for Elovl3, Pgc-1a, Ucp-1 and Dio2 (Supplement 1). Data expressed as
arbitrary units and expression of target genes corrected to the geometric average of four house-
keeping genes: 18s, 36b4, bactin and Gapdh.
Western blots
Tissues were ground to a fine powder using a sterile pestle and mortar on liquid nitrogen. Powdered
tissue were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA,
10 mM glycerophosphate, 2 mM orthovanadate, 2 mM PMSF,. 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton
X-100, pH7.5) with added protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails according to manufacturer’s
instruction (Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 2600 g for 5 min at 4˚C, to separate
the fat content of the samples. Protein extracts were further cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g
for 10 min at 4˚C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford
assay, proteins were diluted in Laemli buffer and separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel (12%) elec-
trophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane). Membranes were blocked for 1
hr at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4˚C with the indicated antibody (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology). Bound primary antibodies were detected using peroxidase-coupled second-
ary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Relative quantification of band inten-
sities was calculated by digitally photographing exposed films and using Genesnap and Genetools
software (Syngene).
Brain perfusion, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and image
analysis
Animals were anaesthetized with Euthatal solution 80 mg/kg in saline and transcardiacally perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 30%
sucrose for 48 hr at 4˚C. Brains were sectioned using a freezing sliding microtome into 5 subsets of
25 microns sections. Antigen retrieval was used for all experiments prior to antibody incubation. Sec-
tions were incubated in 10 mM sodium citrate at 80˚C for 20 min then washed three times in PBS.
To decrease endogenous autofluorescence, samples were then treated with 0.3% glycine and
0.003% SDS in methanol. Tissue was blocked for 1 hr with 5% normal donkey serum at room temper-
ature, and incubated at 4˚C with primary antibodies against pSer2448-mTORC1 (72 hr, 1:65; Cell
Signaling Technology), c-fos (48 hr, 1:5000, Synaptic Systems), pSer240/244rpS6 (19 hr, 1:200, Cell
Signaling Technology), dsRed (1:1000, Clontech), or pSTAT3 (19 hr, 1:500, Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy). Sections were then mounted on slides and coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector).
Sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with the 40x objective. Gain
and laser power settings remained the same between experimental and control conditions.
Images of tissue sections were digitized, and areas of interest were outlined based on cellular
morphology. The brain region evaluated was arcuate nucleus (1.5–1.9 mm caudal, 0–0.45 mm
mediolateral, and 5.6–6 mm ventromedial to bregma), corresponding to the coordinates in the brain
atlas of Paxinos and Franklin, 2001. Images were analyzed using the ImageJ manual cell counter.
Serum analysis
Mouse FGF-21 was measured using a Quantikine ELISA kit from Bio-Techne (MF2100). The assay
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were analyzed in duplicate
and the mean value reported. Quality control samples were analyzed at the beginning and end of
the batch to ensure consistency across the plate.

 T4 was measured using a fully automated assay on the Siemens Dimension EXL analyzer. The
method is an adaptation of the EMIT homogenous immunoassay technology. T4 is stripped from its
binding proteins using a releasing agent. The released T4 binds to anti-T4 antibody, thereby reduc-
ing the amount of T4-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase conjugate (T4-G6PDH) that can be
bound to the antibody. The T4-G6PDH which is not bound to the antibody catalyzes the oxidation
of glucose-6-phosphate with the simultaneous reduction of NAD+ to NADH which absorbs at 340
nm. In the absence of T4, T4-G6PDH binds with the antibody and enzyme activity is reduced. The
increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to the formation of NADH over a 60 s measure period is pro-
portional to the activity of the T4-G6PDH. The T4 concentration is measured using a bichromatic
(340, 383 nm) rate technique. All reagents and calibrators were purchased from Siemens. Samples
were analyzed in singleton. Three levels of Quality Control samples were analyzed at the beginning
and end of the batch. All QC results were within their target ranges before the sample results were
reported.
iBAT norepinephrine turnover
iBAT norepinephrine turnover was determined based on the fall in iBAT norepinephrine content fol-
lowing inhibition of catecholamine biosynthesis with a-methyl-DL-tyrosine methyl ester hydrochlo-
ride (AMPT,Sigma-Aldrich) administered ip at 250 mg/kg, as described previously (Brodie et al.,
1966). AMPT is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catechol-
amine biosynthesis. After AMPT administration, the endogenous tissue levels of norepinephrine
decline and the slope of this decrease in tissue norepinephrine content is multiplied by the initial
norepinephrine concentration to yield NETO, an indirect readout of SNS outflow.
Norepinephrine was assayed in iBAT using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatogra-
phy (HPLC) and electrochemical detection (Dalley et al., 2002). Samples (20 mg) were homogenized
in 0.2 ml of 0.2M perchloric acid and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 10˚C. The supernatant
was diluted 1:4 in PCA buffer before the injection. Twenty-five ml aliquots of supernatant were
injected onto a C18 ODS 3 mm column (100 mm length x 4.6 mm i.d.,Hypersil Elite, Phenomenex,
UK) with a mobile phase consisting of citric acid (31.9 g/L), sodium acetate (2 g/L), octanesulfonic
acid (460 mg/L) EDTA (30 mg/L) and 15% methanol (pH 3.6). Norepinephrine was detected using an
ESA Coulochem II detector with electrode 1 held at �200 mV and electrode two held at +250 mV.
Chromatograms were acquired and analyzed using Chromeleon software (Dionex, UK).
Statistical analysis
All data, presented as means ± SEM, have been analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6. For all statistical
tests, an a risk of 5% was used. All kinetics were analyzed using repeated-measures two-way
ANOVAs and adjusted with Bonferroni’s post hoc tests. Multiple comparisons were tested with one-
way ANOVAs and adjusted with Tukey’s post hoc tests. Single comparisons were made using one-
tail Student’s t tests.
