Abstract
Background: Live imaging of whole invertebrates can be accomplished with X-ray micro-computed tomography
(micro-CT) at 10-100 μm spatial resolution. However, image quality could be compromised by the movement of
live subjects, producing image artefacts. We tested the feasibility of using CO2 gas to induce temporary full-
immobilization of sufficient duration to image live insects based on their ability to tolerate hypoxic conditions.
Additionally, we investigated the effects of these prolonged hypoxic conditions on several life history traits of a
lepidopteran species.
Methods: Live Colorado potato beetle (CPB) and true armyworm (TAW) adults were immobilized under a constant
CO2 gas flow (0.5 L/min), and scanned using micro-CT (80 kVp; 450 μA). An L8 (24) orthogonal array (OA) was used
to evaluate the effects of prolonged CO2-induced anesthesia on the recovery, longevity, and incidence of mating of
TAW adults. The variable factors were age (immature and mature), sex (female and male), exposure time (3 and 7 h),
and exposure regime (single and repeated).
Results: With this method, successful 3D reconstruction and visualizations of CPB and TAW adults were produced at
20 micron voxel spacing at an acceptable radiation dose and image noise level. From the inverse-square relationship
found between the radiation doses and image noise levels, the optimal scanning protocol produced an entrance dose
of 6.2 ± 0.04 Gy with images of 129.6 ± 5.1 HU noise level during a 2.7 h scan.
Independent OA experiments indicated that CO2 gas did not result in death of exposed TAW adults, except when
older males were exposed for longer durations. Exposure time and sex were more influential factors affecting recovery,
longevity, and mating success than age and exposure regime following CO2 exposure.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that using CO2 gas during micro-CT imaging effectively induces safe, repeatable,
whole-body, and temporary immobilization of live insects for 3D visualizations without motion artefacts. Moreover, we
have shown that exposed TAW individuals made a full recovery with very little impact on subsequent longevity, and
mating success post hypoxia. This method is applicable to other imaging modalities and could be used for routine
exploratory and time-course studies, for repeated scanning of live and intact individuals.

 Background
Conventional imaging methods, such as light and con-
focal microscopy, provide valuable details of internal
anatomy of invertebrates, but they generally require
sacrifice or dissection of the live individuals [1]. The use
of these methods in longitudinal (time-course) studies,
involving repeated scans of the same individuals, is thus
not possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X-
ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) [2, 3] have
been used for 3D non-destructive visualization of internal
anatomical structures [4–10] of live and preserved small
mammals and invertebrates, including insects [11–20].
Micro-CT and MRI each have their own advantages and
limitations due to organism size (scanner field of view),
spatial resolution, scan time and cost. While these two
techniques have produced reasonably high-resolution
images of both dead and live insects [5, 10, 21, 22], diffi-
culties were encountered due to internal and external
body movements, and required physical restriction of the
individuals. Such physical constraints induce stress
that can affect the behavior and/or physiology of test
organisms during and after the imaging procedure.
Insects can tolerate high doses of ionizing radiation, as
during micro-CT, due to highly efficient oxidative stress
and DNA damage repair mechanisms [23–26]. Some
lepidopteran cell lines are reported to tolerate X-ray
doses 52-104 times more than mammalian counterparts
[23, 24]. Nevertheless, death or permanent metabolic
damage due to radiation has been observed, especially
when synchrotron beams are employed (> 300 Gy) [6, 9].
These high radiation doses preclude the possibility of
repeated measures on the same living individuals over
time, and therefore keeping the radiation doses as low as
possible becomes crucial to avoid rapid death during
follow-up studies on live insects using micro-CT.
Therefore, an ideal imaging protocol for studying live
insects would preferably accommodate the following
criteria: allow simultaneous scanning of multiple, fully-
intact specimens to maximize throughput; provide ad-
equate image resolution and high contrast-to-noise ratio
to distinguish in situ structures; deliver a sufficiently low
radiation dose to allow repeated scans for time-course
studies; and allow fully-immobilized individuals to
eliminate motion-related artefacts. Additionally, the
protocol should have minimal or no subsequent nega-
tive effects on the life history traits or physiological
processes of test subjects.
To minimize motion artefacts during live insect X-ray
micro-CT imaging, we temporarily immobilized the test
subjects using hypoxia by carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. In
addition to being radiotolerant, insects can survive acute
hypoxic (oxygen deficient) conditions [27–29]. Keeping in-
sects in CO2 hypoxic and /or hypercapnic (abnormally ele-
vated CO2 level) conditions leads to temporary, whole-body
immobilization as the CO2 molecules mainly interfere with
the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), probably by blocking
the glutamate receptors [27–29]. In this state, CO2 induces
anesthesia that stops both external (e.g. antennae and legs)
and internal (e.g. heart beat and hemolymph flow) body
movements [17, 30], thereby eliminating motion-related
image artefacts.
Since live insect scanning typically takes at least sev-
eral hours to complete when using bench-top micro-CT,
prolonged exposure to either ionizing radiation or CO2
gas could negatively affect aspects of insect behaviour
and fitness [31–35]. Such exposures could be detrimen-
tal in time-course studies where the same individuals
must be examined multiple times. Thus, an optimized
imaging protocol should ensure safe entrance doses,
preferably at least 10 times less than commonly used
during insect sterilization. The effects of prolonged
exposure to hypoxic conditions can be long lasting, and
may not necessarily be immediate. Therefore, it is crit-
ical to distinguish between possible effects of experimen-
tal treatments and those of hypoxia-induced anesthesia.
Several factors including age, sex, duration of acute
exposure, and number of repeated exposures play a role
in insects’ response to and recovery from hypoxia. Their
relative importance may vary depending on the subse-
quent effects on life history traits, and consequently on
the type of biologically-relevant processes under investi-
gation. Therefore, in parallel to investigating the feasibil-
ity of using CO2 gas for immobilization of live insect
(the Colorado potato beetle and the true armyworm)
adults undergoing micro-CT scanning, we assessed the
effects of prolonged CO2 exposure, of equivalent dur-
ation required for imaging experiments on the recovery,
longevity, and mating of Pseudaletia unipuncta adults.
To this end, we employed an orthogonal array design –
a robust and unbiased method to determine the influ-
ence of individual factors, while limiting experimental
variability [36–40]. This approach yields the optimized
combinations of factors that have a minimal impact on
the recovery and certain subsequent life history traits of
insects post-anesthesia during live imaging.
Methods
Insects
Colorado potato beetle (CPB; Leptinotarsa decemlineata
Say, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and the true armyworm
(TAW; Pseudaletia unipuncta Haworth, Lepidoptera:
Noctuidae) were obtained as newly-emerged adults from
laboratory colonies maintained at Agriculture and Agri-
Food Canada and the University of Western Ontario, re-
spectively. Appropriate food sources were provided for each
species: potato leaves for the CPB, and ad lib 8% (w/v) sugar
water solution for the TAW.

 Anesthesia, scanning, and data acquisition
Immediately
before
micro-CT
imaging,
the
live
adults were immobilized (~10-20 s) under a constant
flow (5 psi; 0.5 L/min flow rate) [41] of medical
grade carbon dioxide (CO2), and placed in a custom
designed tube (Fig. 1a) for micro-CT scanning. This
tube was made with the conical end of a 50 mL cen-
trifuge tube cutoff. A plastic syringe filter was affixed to
the open end to which a Tygon tube (R-3603; I.D. × O.D.
1/4 in. × 3/8 in) was connected for CO2 gas delivery. A
rectangular piece of radiolucent expanded polystyrene
foam was used as a bed to support the anesthetized
insects. Two moistened foam pieces were interposed at
either end of the tube to prevent insect desiccation. The
insects were kept under anesthesia for a further 10 min to
ensure full immobilization before scanning, after which
the flow of CO2 gas was continued for the full duration of
each scan.
The tube containing the live individuals was scanned
in a GE eXplore Locus RS-9 X-ray micro-CT system
(GE Healthcare, London, Canada). The acquisition pa-
rameters for the various scan protocols are detailed in
Table 1. X-ray projections were acquired over a full
360° rotation around the sample volume (except for
Protocol 1 acquired over a 191° rotation; Table 1).
One week-old CPB adults (2 males and 2 females),
including a water sample for Hounsfield Units (HU)
calibration, were scanned (field of view = 3.8 × 3.8 × 3.8 cm;
see Additional file 1: Figure S1(I)) using Protocols 1,
2, and 3 (see Table 1). The insects were then allowed
to recover for 48 h, before being scanned using Protocol
4. Finally, after a further 24-48 h recovery, these CPB were
scanned using Protocol 5. The 24-48 h recovery periods
were to ensure full restoration of normal metabolism be-
tween scans [42]. Although the CPB females recovered
after being scanned using Protocol 4, they died within
48 h, and were replaced by two new females of the
same generation and age for scanning using Protocol 5.
The use of these 5 protocols enabled dose and image
noise measurements from which the optimal scan pa-
rameters were deduced. This optimized protocol was
then used to scan TAW adults (2 males and 2 females
per scan, including a water sample for HU calibration)
when they were 1-d old (sexually immature) and 4-d
old (sexually mature).
For both species, during each scanning protocol,
the same number of individuals was set aside with no
CO2 exposure and no food for longevity comparison
with the scanned ones. For reproducibility, we per-
formed the scanning experiments twice on two fresh
batches of CPB (n = 4 females; n = 4 males; 2 indi-
viduals of each sex per scan) and four times TAW
(n = 4 males; n = 4 females; 1 individual of each sex
per scan) independently.

 Dosimetry and noise analysis
The entrance dose (Gy) for the 5 different scan proto-
cols, of duration 0.33, 1.40, 2.68, 3.96, and 6.53 h, was
measured at the isocenter of the micro-CT scanner,
using an ionization chamber coupled to an electrometer
(Keithley, models 96035B and 35614, respectively; see
Additional file 1: Figure S1(II)). For each protocol, the
noise level (HU) in 3D-CT reconstructed images at
20 μm isotropic voxel spacing was calculated as the
standard deviation of 5 specific regions of interest (ROI)
of size 20 × 20 × 20 voxels each in a water phantom
image volume. The optimal scanning protocol– the
shortest scan time that provides the most satisfactory
image quality in terms of entrance dose and image noise –
was then established from a dose-noise relationship by
plotting the entrance dose (Gy) versus noise (HU) [43].
Reconstruction and 3D image rendering
The acquired 2D projections were reconstructed at 20 μm
isotropic voxel size into a 3D image using the Feldkamp
filtered-back projection algorithm (FDK) [44] using the
GE Healthcare eXplore Reconstruction Utility. The 3D-
CT images (in .vff format) were imported as DICOM in
Osirix (v. 4.0 32-bit; Pixmeo; GE; Switzerland; freely avail-
able at: http://www.osirix-viewer.com) for renderings. No
manipulations, such as noise averaging, were made to
the data. The settings for the 3D MPR (multi-planar re-
formatted) were: Opacity = linear table, Mode = Volume
Rendering (4.03 mm); and for 3D volume rendering
(Group: Soft Tissue CT, preset 6 (Soft + Skin), Level of
Detail (Fine); Shading (Ambient Coeff. = 0.14; Diffuse
Coeff. 0.83; Specular Coeff: 0.50; Specular Power = 50.0).
Orthogonal array (OA) design and setup for CO2 exposure
To evaluate the effects of prolonged CO2-induced
anesthesia on the recovery, longevity, and incidence of
mating, we exposed TAW adults to several treatments
based on an L8 (24) (four factors at two levels) orthog-
onal array (OA). In this design (Tables 2 and 3; n = 10
per treatment), the factors were: age (immature and
mature), sex (female and male), exposure time (3 and
7 h- equivalent to micro-CT scan durations), and expos-
ure regime (single and repeated) to a constant flow of
CO2 (5 psi; flow rate 0.5 L/min; see Additional file 1:
Figure S2) during the photophase.
We performed this study on TAW adults only because of
availability and shorter life span compared to CPB (> 30 d).
The controls received no anaesthesia and were not pro-
vided with any food source during the periods that treated
individuals were exposed to CO2. All insects, treated and
controls, were held in individual clear plastic cylinders with
ad lib food source (cotton wicks soaked in 8% sugar water
solution) before and after all treatments (Table 3). For
repeated anesthesia, the individuals were exposed to CO2
for a second time 24 h after the first exposure.
For the CO2 exposure set up, the TAW adults were
knocked out for 10-20 s, and carefully placed in a 1 L
glass beaker on a layer of polystyrene foam. The beaker
also contained a moistened foam support to prevent
insect desiccation (see Additional file 2: Figure S2). A
funnel was then connected to the chamber for CO2 gas
delivery (medical grade; 5 psi; 0.5 L/min), and the indi-
viduals were maintained under these conditions for the
required durations according to Table 3. All exposures were
performed at 23 °C in light conditions (corresponding to
the photophase that insects were entrained to).
Recovery, longevity, and incidence of mating
Post-anesthetic recovery of TAW adults was recorded
for each individual as vitality signs (elapsed time for
antennae, proboscis, and leg movements), and recovery
(flip, walk, and move in a coordinated fashion) time.

 Longevity of all anesthetized virgin individuals was also
recorded and compared with control individuals of the
same sex. Virgin individuals were chosen to avoid
possible reduction in longevity due to mating. A total of
80 individuals (10 per treatment) were anesthetised, with
an equal number of controls (80 total; 10 per corre-
sponding treatment), and used for measurements of
recovery and longevity.
To investigate the effects of anesthesia on the inci-
dence of mating, 24 h post-exposure, CO2-exposed
males and females (including control individuals) were
paired up with one non-anesthetised virgin mature indi-
vidual of the opposite sex for the duration of one scoto-
phase (8 h). This pairing ensured that any observed
effects on the incidence of mating were due to the
exposed individuals. Mating pairs were placed in small
mesh cages (22 × 15 × 15 cm) containing ad lib sugar
water solution. After 8 h, the respective females of each
treatment were dissected to determine if mating was
successful by looking for presence of a spermatophore.
A total of 80 (in addition to the 80 individuals used for
recovery and longevity measurements) individuals (10
per treatment) were anesthetised and paired with non-
exposed virgin counterparts for mating experiments. An
equal number of non-exposed individuals was used as
control and paired with virgin counterparts.
Data analysis
All data were verified for normality using the Shapiro-
Wilk’s
test.
Parametric
tests
(one-way
ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s HSD post hoc test) were used to
analyse those data that followed a normal distribution.
Otherwise, non-parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis
Test followed by Dunn’s test) were employed. The
tests and analyses were performed using SPSS (v.21;
IBM, NY, USA).
To investigate the effect of a given treatment on the life-
span of TAW adults, longevity ratios were computed. For
the calculation of this ratio, the mean life span of the
female control in each group was calculated and these
means were compared using a one-way ANOVA. Since no
statistically-significant difference was observed, these data
were averaged. This average longevity of the female
controls was then used to normalize all the treatments
containing females (Treatments 1, 2, 5, and 6). The
longevity ratio for females for a given treatment was hence
calculated as the average life-span of females from that
group divided by the average life-span of all female
controls. The average longevity of all male controls
was similarly calculated and used to normalize (as they
were also not significantly different) treatments con-
taining males (Treatments 3, 4, 7, and 8) to calculate
their longevity ratio.
To examine the effect of the treatments on the inci-
dence of mating, each group was compared with its
respective control. All female controls were compared to
each other; and all male controls were compared to each
other using Chi-square tests. Finally, all controls com-
bined (females and males) were compared to each other
using a Chi-square test. In all cases no statistically-
significant differences were found. Therefore, for the
final analysis, a Chi-square test was performed to com-
pare only the mating incidence among the treatments.
The ranking of the impact of the four factors (age, sex,
exposure time, and exposure regime) on the outcomes
(recovery, longevity, and mating success) based on the
L8 OA [45] was performed in Minitab (v.17 Minitab,
Coventry, UK). The reasons for choosing the orthogonal
array, rather than a full factorial design, are mainly to
reduce the number of experimental treatments and to
provide the effective ranking of the factors with respect
to their influence on the measured response variables.
After calculating the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for
each treatment described in Table 3, the average S/N
value was computed for each factor and level. This S/N
ratio measures the robustness used to establish which of
these four control factors (age, sex, exposure time, and
exposure regime) result in reduced variability in the out-
comes (recovery, longevity, and mating of TAW) by
minimizing the impacts of other factors that are not
possible to control. These factors, for which we cannot
control, are referred as noise, which include genetic vari-
ability, individual variation in CO2 tolerance, gradual in-
crease of lactate level, and acidification during hypoxia.
Delta (Δ) was then calculated for each measured param-
eter
(i.e.
response)
as
the
difference
between
the
maximum and minimum S/N values. For recovery, the
response was computed using eq. (1) below with the
goal of minimizing this parameter (smaller the better).
Conversely, eq. (2) was used to maximize longevity and
mating incidence (larger the better).

For multivariate analysis, a principal component ana-
lysis (PCA) was performed on the recovery, longevity,

analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO; ≥ 0.70 consid-
ered as satisfactory to run PCA) measure of sampling
adequacy and the Bartlettʾs test for sphericity (χ2) were

patterns
between the 8 treatments post-anesthesia, with varimax
rotation after normalization using the z-score on all data
in SPSS (v.21; IBM, NY, USA).
Results
X-ray dose-to-image noise relationship
Based on the inverse-square dose-to-noise relationship
(Fig. 1d), Protocol 3 emerged as optimal from the dose
versus image noise analysis. This protocol resulted in an
entrance dose of 6.2 ± 0.04 Gy, producing images (Figs.
2 and 3) with a 129.6 ± 5.1 HU noise level during a
2.68 h scan (i.e. corresponding to the amount of time
that the insects were maintained under CO2 anesthesia).
Under these conditions, the insects recovered full mobil-
ity within 40 min post-anesthesia/scanning, compared to
more than 90 min for the 6.53 h scan (Protocol 5). The
15.5 ± 0.10 Gy entrance dose for the 6.53 h scan was
approximately 2.5 times higher than the optimal 2.68 h
scan (Fig. 1b), but it was least 13 times less than the
average required dose for insect sterilization.
We observed that all CPB individuals (scanned and non-
scanned; males and females) lived for approximately 30 d
(except for scanned females that did not survive after
Protocol 4). No difference was observed in the post-
anesthetic longevity of scanned (9.0 ± 2.2 d) and control
(10.3 ± 2.9 d) TAW females (t (6) = −0.70, p = 0.51; n = 4;
t-test), or between scanned (12.3 ± 1.7 d) and control
(11.0 ± 1.4 d) TAW males (t (6) = 1.13, p = 0.30; n = 4,
t-test; Fig. 3). Additionally, these TAW adults took
similar time (~ 40 min) to fully recover as those individ-
uals that were exposed to CO2 for 3 h as shown below.
Post- anesthetic recovery of TAW
Regardless of age and exposure regime, longer exposure
to CO2 gas hypoxia (Treatments 2, 4, 6, and 8) resulted in
significantly longer recovery periods in TAW adults of
both sexes (p < 0.0001; Fig. 4a). Individuals exposed for
7 h took approximately three times as long to fully recover
post-anesthesia than those exposed for 3 h. This pattern
of longer recovery for individuals with longer exposure
times was similar for all other recovery parameters
measured, including mean and minimum time to first
observed movement, as well as time taken for the insects
to flip onto their legs (natural position), and to walk in a
coordinated fashion (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
Post- anesthetic longevity of TAW
The observed effect of CO2 gas hypoxia on longevity of
TAW adults was not as pronounced as seen with the
recovery parameters. In most cases, exposure to CO2 gas
did not affect longevity of TAW adults. The only excep-
tion was Treatment 8, where the males exposed twice for
7 h did not live as long as the controls, or adults exposed
for 3 h (Treatments 1, 3, 5, and 7) (p < 0.01, Fig. 4b;
see Additional file 4: Figure S4a).
Post- anesthetic mating incidence of TAW
Overall, the mating of TAW adults was not affected
after exposure to CO2 gas, except when mature and
immature males were exposed once and twice for 7 h
(Treatments 4 and 8), where incidence was lower

from left to right; see Additional files 7: Videos S1, Additional files 8: Videos S1 and Additional files 9: Videos S2, Additional files 10: Videos S2 for female
and male adults, respectively). While the images from Protocol 5 are of the highest quality, the conspicuity of internal structures from the Protocol 3
images are sufficient and spare the individual the higher anesthetic and radiation dose

 compared to all other treatments (p < 0.05, Fig. 4c;
see Additional file 4: Figure S4b).
Ranking of critical factors
Exposure time was the most influential factor affecting
the recovery, longevity, and mating of TAW adults
following CO2 exposure (Table 4). The second most
important factors were age and sex of TAW adults. Age
influenced only recovery time, but was 10 times less
influential than exposure time. Sex impacted longevity
ratio, but was 3 times less influential than exposure time.
Sex also influenced mating incidence with almost the same
influence as exposure time following TAW full recovery.
Therefore, the immediate effects of CO2 anesthesia on the
recovery of TAW adults were exposure time- and age-
dependent for both males and females. In contrast, long-
term physiological effects of CO2 anesthesia were exposure
time- and sex-dependent, as observed for the life history
parameters measured many days later.
Additionally, irrespective of the factor rankings, several
interactions between different combinations of factors
were observed. The recovery time, following CO2 gas
exposure in male and female TAW, was affected differ-
entially depending on the exposure regime (interaction:
sex x exposure regime). Repeated exposures lead to
longer recovery times for both sexes. Yet, the difference
between recovery time following single and repeated
exposures was larger for females than males.
Similarly, longevity of TAW males was negatively
affected when sexually mature individuals (4d-old) were
subjected to CO2 (interaction: sex x age), while no ef-
fects were observed with female TAW irrespective of
age. The exposure regime had markedly different effect
on longevity of TAW, depending on their age: sexually
mature individuals (4d-old) had shorter lives than imma-
ture ones (1d-old) after repeated exposure to CO2 (inter-
action: age x exposure regime). Moreover, as exposure
time was increased (from 3 to 7 h), there was a greater
reduction in longevity of male compared to female TAW
(interaction: exposure time x sex).
Individuals that were sexually mature (4-d old) during
CO2 exposure were less successful at mating after ex-
periencing repeated (interaction: age x exposure regime)
and longer exposure (interaction: age x exposure time).
No effects were observed in any treatment group when
sexually immature (1-d old) individuals were exposed to
hypoxia. Similarly, the mating success of males was
negatively affected when subjected to longer (interaction:
sex x exposure time) and repeated (interaction: sex x ex-
posure regime) exposures, irrespective of their maturity
at the time of exposure to CO2.
Multivariate analysis of TAW recovery ability and life-
history traits post-anesthesia
Principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rota-
tion (KMO = 0.7 and χ2 (21) = 97.2; p < 0.001) revealed
discriminatory patterns among the 8 treatments on the re-
covery, longevity, and mating of TAW adults post CO2 -in-
duced hypoxia. The first two principal components (PC1
and PC2) accounted for 95.4% of the total variability
(Fig. 5), and separated or grouped some treatments
into pairs. Each pair was different from the others
(Treatments 1 and 3, 5 and 7, 4 and 8, and 2 and 6)
based on their influence on the subsequent recovery
and life history traits post-anesthesia (Fig. 5a).

 Principal component 1 (PC1) accounted for 70.5% of
the total variability (Fig. 5a), and clearly separated
shorter (3 h) exposure time treatments (1, 3, 5 and 7)
from longer (7 h) ones (2, 6, 4, and 8). From the PC1
loadings (Fig. 5b), this separation was due to differences
in recovery times post-anesthesia, which is consistent
with the statistical analysis of recovery times summa-
rized in Fig. 4a.
Principal component 2 (PC2) accounted for 24.9% of
the total variability and separated the treatments based
on sex (male vs. female), and age (sexually immature vs.
mature) after CO2 exposure. Examination of PC2 load-
ings (Fig. 4b) revealed maximum separation was caused
mainly by low mating incidence linked to Treatments 4
and 8, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig.
4c. Therefore, any combinations of factors may be used

Discussion
Our results indicate that incorporating hypoxia and/or
hypercapnia to totally immobilize individuals during
scanning is a suitable method for visualizing whole live
insects using X-ray micro-CT, with little or no impact
on their subsequent recovery, longevity and mating suc-
cess when the optimal conditions are used. Moreover,
this method is not only applicable to individuals at adult
stage, it has also successfully enabled imaging of live in-
dividuals at larval and pupal stages (see Additional file 5:
Figure S5). Where inherent tissue contrast is insufficient,
non-toxic contrast agents can be further added to the
imaging procedure for tissue differentiation enhance-
ment, facilitating segmentation (see Additional file 6:
Figure S6). Such contrast agent is not required for ren-
dering and segmenting live insect exoskeleton from soft
tissues (fat body and muscles) as reported here and illus-
trated in Figs. 2c and 3c.
This technique is compatible with various scanning
modalities and its ease of implementation is important
for its broad application in routine and reproducible
scanning. One clear benefit is its application to any lab-
based “bench top” scanner for studies using live insects.
In spite of synchrotron beamlines being free (pending
proposal acceptance) and capable of producing very
high-resolution images, longitudinal studies on live in-
sects remain very problematic at these facilities due to
logistical reasons (in addition to very high X-rays
radiation doses). Even if required regulatory permits are
obtained,

 cause stress to the animals and there is a risk of intro-
duction of invasive species or pest in new areas. These
facilities offer little or no adequate rearing space to
maintain the specimens used for repeated imaging for
time-course studies.
In an imaging context, our findings suggest that hypoxic
conditions induced by exposure to CO2 gas, at least with
respect to the investigated critical factors, is not detrimen-
tal for the measured life history parameters (longevity and
mating) of TAW (except for males exposed for longer
durations). Hypoxia and /or hypercapnia induced by CO2
gas produces reversible loss of motor function in insects
(due to lowered sensitivity in neuromuscular junction to
glutamate) [28], and can have long-lasting effects on be-
haviour, including phase shifts in circadian rhythms [47]
and life history traits [27]. For example, following CO2
anesthesia, Drosophila melanogaster not only exhibited
reduced longevity, but also lowered fecundity, mating suc-
cess, and motor function [31, 33, 48]. Similarly, negative
effects on development, locomotion, and feeding were ob-
served after CO2 induced anesthesia in Blattela germanica
[32, 34]. However, provided that adequate recovery period
is allowed, insect physiology following anesthesia usually
returns to normal, with recovery proportional to the ex-
posure duration [35, 42, 49], consistent with our findings
on the recovery ability in TAW.
The observed reduced longevity and low mating suc-
cess in TAW males that were exposed to longer dura-
tions can be related to body size and age, as seen for
those individuals in Treatments 4 and 8. The maximum
time that insects can withstand hypoxia is not only
species dependent, but within species, females are more
tolerant than males because of their larger body size
[30, 50], as in the case of the TAW females compared

 to males. Larger body size usually indicates larger carbo-
hydrate and fat reserves [51], and possibly allows faster
resumption of normal metabolism. Moreover, this hypoxia
tolerance declines with age for both sexes [30], which was
observed in our study for repeatedly exposed males
(compared to single CO2 exposures).
Regardless of which treatment we employed, the fact
that all individuals were able to move their antennae and
other appendages post anesthesia suggests no immediate
central nervous system (CNS) impairment [30]. During
the observed sequence of movement restoration in
TAW, starting with extremities and joints followed by
coordination of movements and eventual flight, the first
two are linked directly to rapid adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) re-synthesis [30] once oxygen becomes available
again. This rapid ATP re-synthesis results from insects’
ability to retain adenylates (products of ATP breakdown)
in their tissues – in contrast to mammals. Additionally,
because insects accumulate very little lactate during hyp-
oxia exposure [30], they avoid the toxic effects of accu-
mulated metabolic products of glycolysis. Combined
together, mobility becomes possible again as coordin-
ation of CNS with muscles and metabolism are restored
during recovery. This process is independent of the cir-
culatory system because gaseous O2 flows easily through
the tracheae to the brain, and other parts of the CNS,
even before circulation is restored. Consequently, CNS
dependent
processes
are
preserved,
irrespective
of
whether the organisms live to their full life-span or not,
post hypoxia.
The ability to scan multiple individuals in a single scan
acquisition, in order to maximize sample throughput, is
compromised at higher resolutions, where the field of
view is necessarily reduced. In the current study, scan-
ning of multiple organisms simultaneously was possible
at 20 μm, which is sufficient to visualize the exoskeleton,
its invagination (tracheal system), and larger structures.
Nevertheless, scanning of multiple individuals is com-
promised when higher resolution is needed for resolving
very fine structures.
The application of CO2 anesthesia during micro-CT im-
aging for visualizing whole live insects is not limited to
20 μm resolution voxel spacing, presented here as a proof
of concept. This method is applicable to studies where
much higher resolution is achieved [5, 7, 9, 10, 52]. How-
ever, at higher resolution, higher radiation doses become
more of a concern to the live individuals and moreover,
additive effects between prolonged exposure to hypoxic
conditions and higher ionizing radiation doses can be
expected. In the current study, the scanned individuals
received between 13 times (15.5 Gy for Protocol 5) and
345 times (0.58 Gy for Protocol 1) less radiation dose
than the average required dose for insect sterilization
[24, 53]. This dose was also between 22.5 to 597 times,
and 84 to 2218 times less than that delivered by syn-
chrotron monochromatic (~350 Gy) and polychromatic
(~1300 Gy) beams, respectively. Although we cannot
definitively rule out the combined effect of X-ray
radiation and CO2 -induced hypoxia in our study, we
suggest its impact to be minimal because the adult indi-
viduals received very low radiation doses during the im-
aging procedure under prolonged hypoxia exposure.
Although the entrance doses were 1 to 2 orders of mag-
nitude less that sterilization dose for adult insects,
other life stages such as larval and pupal may have
different susceptibility to radiation and CO2 anesthesia
due to the rapid cellular changes that are occurring at
these stages. Future comprehensive studies may wish to
address this differential impact of radiation on different
developmental stages (including adult) in combination
with CO2 anesthesia in a longitudinal study within and
across several generations of insects.
Finally, the application of CO2 gas anesthetic during
live imaging can be used to discriminate among different
tissues (e.g. muscles, fat body, and alimentary tract) at
20 μm isotropic voxel size to address a number of differ-
ent questions that would give valuable insights into in-
sect physiology and metabolism. Although we have only
investigated the effect of CO2 anesthesia on adults, this
method can be extendable to time-course developmental
studies on different stages of development. For example,
in studies of migratory moth adults, the technique could
provide a non-destructive means of assessing the level of
gonad development and lipid accumulation at different
times of the year, or determining of mating status (the
presence or absence of spermatophores) [54]. Currently,
those aspects are invasively determined by dissection.
Similarly, the technique could be employed to follow
temporal anatomical change during different stages of
larval and pupal development in applied entomology.
Overall, depending on the measured end point of any
experiment on live insects, various combinations of
physical scan conditions and biological states of scanned
insects become important during imaging as shown by
the interactions of factors in our results. There may be
other such factors of interest in other investigations,
where interactions may exit and are either not obvious,
or have subtle effects. To this end, taking full advantage
of the OA approach is invaluable in interpretations and
understanding of observations that are purely biological,
and separated from those due to the imaging procedure.
Thus, this method can be expanded to incorporate other
factors such as life stages (larval, pupal, and adult) to
minimize the impact of using the 6.2 Gy as optimal
imaging protocol and CO2 anesthesia on different life
history traits to ensure that longitudinal studies on in-
sect morphology within and beyond several generations
are not confounded.

 Conclusion
Exposing insects to hypoxic conditions using CO2 gas,
to ensure whole-body unrestricted immobilization, pro-
vides a new way to visualize live insects using X-ray
micro-CT. 3D images were produced to distinguish in
situ structures at 20 μm voxel spacing and at a relatively
low radiation dose of less than 20 Gy. Repeated scanning
of the same individuals is possible, allowing for time-
course studies where live imaging is required. CO2
anesthesia can be incorporated with many other imaging
modalities. Overall, depending on the experimental end
points, there exist some combinations of critical factors
under which insects can recover fully from hypoxia,
without any apparent impact on their longevity and mat-
ing success. Since the method is simple to implement,
routine time-course studies and other immediate wide-
spread applications can be achieved, wherever live insect
visualization is required, in applied entomology, such as
medical entomology, insect development, and parasitology,
to extract biologically-relevant information.
