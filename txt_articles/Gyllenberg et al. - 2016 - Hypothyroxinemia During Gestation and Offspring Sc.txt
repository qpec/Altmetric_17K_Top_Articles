Abstract
Background—Evidence from animal and human studies indicates that thyroid hormone 
deficiency during early gestation alters brain development. As schizophrenia is associated with 
prenatal brain insults and premorbid cognitive deficits, we tested the a priori hypothesis that 
serologically defined maternal thyroid deficiency during early to mid-gestation is associated with 
offspring schizophrenia.
Methods—The investigation is based on the Finnish Prenatal Study of Schizophrenia (FiPS-S), a 
nested case-control study that included archived maternal sera from virtually all pregnancies since 
1983 (total N over 1 million). We identified all offspring in the cohort diagnosed with 
schizophrenia based on the national inpatient and outpatient register and matched them to 
comparison subjects (1:1) from the cohort on sex, date of birth, and residence in Finland at time of 
onset of the case. Maternal sera on 1010 case-control pairs were assessed for free thyroxine (fT4) 
and 948 for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
Results—Maternal hypothyroxinemia (fT4≤10th percentile, normal TSH) was associated with an 
increased odds of schizophrenia (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.22 – 2.50; p=0.002). When adjusted for 
maternal psychiatric history, province of birth and maternal smoking during pregnancy, the 
association remained significant (OR=1.70, 95%CI 1.13 – 2.55; p=0.010).

INTRODUCTION
Exposure to low thyroid hormone levels in utero alters offspring brain development in both 
animal models and humans (1-3). Experimental rodent studies have shown that maternal 
thyroxine (T4) deficiency, even in the mild range, causes aberrant prenatal 
neurodevelopment (1-3). One such outcome, based on studies of rat dams, is abnormal 
distribution of neurons in the hippocampus; this can be prevented by replacement of 
maternal T4 in early pregnancy (4).
In humans, the fetus is completely dependent on maternal T4 during early gestation, as fetal 
T4 production commences during gestational weeks 12-14 (5). Maternal T4 crosses the 
placenta and fetal T4 correlates well with maternal T4 (6). Clinical hypothyroidism during 
pregnancy is an established risk factor for offspring cognitive dysfunction (7) and 
neuroanatomic abnormalities including reduced hippocampal volume (8). Low maternal fT4 
in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism is termed hypothyroxinemia and defined as fT4 
below the 10th percentile with normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Notably, 
an emerging literature has yielded intriguing evidence that hypothyroxinemia is also 
associated with delayed cognitive, motor (9-11) and speech development in offspring (11).
Because schizophrenia is associated with disrupted prenatal neurodevelopment, and 
impaired cognitive function (12), we tested the hypothesis that maternal hypothyroxinemia, 
and low, continuously defined maternal fT4 levels during early to mid-gestation are 
associated with offspring schizophrenia. In a supplemental aim, we examined whether 
offspring schizophrenia is associated with maternal hypothyroidism, and with other maternal 
clinical thyroid disorders (see "Methods, Laboratory assays and classification of thyroid 
disorders", for definitions).
METHODS AND MATERIALS
The investigation was based on the Finnish Prenatal Study of Schizophrenia (FiPS-S) which 
utilized a nested case-control design (13). The sampling frame was defined so that the 
members of the birth cohort were within the age of risk for schizophrenia. Therefore, 
nationwide registers were used to identify cases born between 1983 (the first birth year of 
the cohort) and 1998, and diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder before 
December 31, 2009 (see "Case and control identification"). The maximum age was 26 years.

 Description of the cohort and the biobank
All subjects in the FiPS-S study were derived from the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC). 
The FMC consisted of all offspring with archived maternal sera drawn during pregnancy in 
Finland since 1983 (total N is over one million). Sera were drawn during the first trimester 
or the early second trimester (5th to 95th percentile=months 2-4 of pregnancy) from over 
98% of the gravidae, following informed consent, for screening of HIV, syphilis, and 
hepatitis. One maternal serum sample was obtained for each pregnancy. After the screening, 
the remainder of each sample was stored as one aliquot at −25°C in a single, centralized 
biorepository (THL). All of the serum samples in the FMC can be linked with offspring by 
the unique personal identification number (PIN), which has been assigned to all residents of 
Finland by the Finnish Population Registry since 1971. The PINs of the mothers of cases 
and matched controls were linked to the FMC sera biobank and to other registers discussed 
below.
Finnish Population Register
The computerized nationwide Finnish Population Register (FPR) was established in 1971. It 
includes comprehensive data on place of birth, twinning, date of emigration, date of death, 
and biological parents, including their dates of births.
Case and control identification
The Finnish Hospital and Outpatient Discharge Register (FHDR), maintained by THL, was 
used to identify all recorded diagnoses for psychiatric hospital admissions and psychiatric 
outpatient treatment visits among members of the FMC. The FHDR was established in 1963 
and computerized data are available from 1987 to the present. The register contains the 
personal and hospital identification codes and primary/secondary psychiatric diagnoses.
In order to identify the cases for the present study, we linked the FMC and the FHDR. All 
cases with schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20) or schizoaffective disorder (ICD-10 F25) in the 
FHDR were identified. Hereinafter schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are referred to 
as “schizophrenia". The age at first treatment was recorded by the first contact with a 
psychiatric facility with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The diagnostic validity of 
schizophrenia in the FHDR was very good; in a previous study, 93% of subjects with a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia in the FHDR were assigned a consensus diagnosis of 
schizophrenia (14). The total number of schizophrenia cases was 1,514 (13). A sufficient 
amount of maternal sera was available in the study to measure fT4 on 1,010 case-control 
pairs and TSH on 948 pairs; 903 pairs were assayed for both fT4 and TSH.
The schizophrenia cases were matched 1:1 to controls drawn from the FMC who were 
without schizophrenia, other non-affective psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder on the 
date of birth (+/− 1 month), sex and being a resident of Finland at the time of case diagnosis. 
The controls for the study were randomly drawn from all controls fulfilling these criteria, 
since there were many controls with all of these characteristics.

 Laboratory assays and classification of thyroid disorders
Measurements of maternal fT4 and TSH were performed blind to case/control status using 
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays with the Architect i2000 automatic analyzer 
(Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL). The lower limits of detection for fT4 and TSH were 
5.1 pmol/l and 0.0025 mlU/l, respectively. The intra- and interassay variation, respectively, 
were 3.6% and 7.8% for fT4, and 1.7% and 5.3% for TSH.
To facilitate the clinical interpretation of the data, we conducted supplemental analyses of 
maternal serologically defined thyroid disorders in relation to schizophrenia. Given that fT4 
varies during pregnancy (15, 16), the lack of trimester-specific reference values from the 
manufacturer, and the fact that the sera had been frozen and stored for up to several years 
(17), we defined the cutoff points to categorize these groups based on percentiles in the 
control population. Maternal hypothyroxinemia was classified as fT4≤10th percentile and 
TSH >5th - 95th percentile, consistent with percentiles used in clinical guidelines for thyroid 
disorders (15) and other thyroid studies (9, 11). In a sensitivity analysis, we used an 
alternative cutoff point to define hypothyroxinemia, namely fT4 ≤5th percentile and TSH 
>5th – 95th percentile. The cutoff points for the other maternal clinical thyroid disorders 
were also consistent with a general population subsample of the current biobank (16). 
Hypothyroidism was defined as fT4 ≤5th percentile and TSH >95th percentile; subclinical 
hypothyroidism as fT4 >5th - 95th percentile and TSH >95th percentile; hyperthyroidism as 
fT4 >95th percentile and TSH ≤5th percentile; and subclinical hyperthyroidism as fT4 >5th - 
95th percentile and TSH :55th percentile. See Table 2 for the cutoff values for fT4 in pmol/l 
and for TSH in mIU/l.
Covariates
The covariates in the study were selected based on the literature on schizophrenia (18-20) 
and outcomes of maternal thyroid hormone disorders (9-11, 21-25). These included maternal 
educational level; previous births; maternal age; maternal history of schizophrenia, affective 
disorders or any psychiatric disorder; urbanicity of birth; birth province; twinning; and the 
gestational week of blood draw (classification shown in Table 1). Gestational week of the 
blood draw was obtained from the FMC, while all other covariates were derived from the 
Finnish Population Register. The degree of urbanization of the birth municipalities were 
classified based on national standards used by Statistics Finland (26): a densely populated 
area was defined as a 250 meter2 area with > 200 inhabitants. Municipalities with ≥90% of 
the population living in densely populated areas were classified as urban, those with 60-89% 
as semi-urban and those with <60% as rural. Urbanicity and province of birth were highly 
correlated in controls (χ2 = 134.7, df = 6; p < 0.0001), and 50.8% of the controls born in 
Southern Finland were born in an urban area (n=292/575). In accord with standard 
epidemiologic practice, covariates were included in the final model if they were associated at 
p < 0.1 with both case-control status and the designated maternal thyroid hormone exposure 
(27-29). In further analyses we adjusted for maternal smoking by serum cotinine, a reliable 
nicotine metabolite, which was assayed from maternal sera.
In addition to these potential confounders, we examined whether preterm birth and low birth 
weight, derived from abstracted maternity records and the medical birth registry, mediated

 the association. To test for mediation criteria, we first examined relationships between these 
variables and exposure/outcome status, as for potential confounders (see previous 
paragraph). Preterm birth and low birth weight are presumed to be in a causal pathway 
between hypothyroxinemia and schizophrenia, because by definition it occurred several 
months after the blood draw, maternal hypothyroidism has an impact on it (30), has been 
associated with hypothyroxinemia during the first trimester (25) and has been related to 
schizophrenia (20).
Ethical approval
The study was approved by the ethical committees of the Hospital District of Southwestern 
Finland, by the National Institute of Health and Welfare (THL), and the Institutional Review 
Board of the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
Statistical analyses
The analysis was based on a nested case-control design. The controls were selected from the 
population at risk (the FiPS-S birth cohort), and matched to cases on selected characteristics 
(see ‘Case and control identification’).
Chi square, Fisher exact and t-tests were used to evaluate relationships between each 
covariate, thyroid hormones, and schizophrenia. Because of the skewness of the data, fT4 
levels were log transformed before being analyzed as continuous variables. This variable 
was normally distributed following transformation to log-fT4. In order to further facilitate 
the interpretation of the data, we then examined maternal thyroid disorders as categorical 
variables (see Table 2, footnote for classifications). Appropriate to the nested case-control 
design, point and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of odds ratios (OR) were obtained by fitting 
conditional logistic regression models. After examining the main effects, we investigated 
whether the effect of maternal fT4 on schizophrenia differed between males and females. 
For this purpose, we analyzed the association between fT4 and schizophrenia stratified by 
sex and also tested for interaction by adding the sex-by-fT4 interaction term into the 
statistical model. Associations were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. All 
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (SAS 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 
USA).
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, case-control status was associated with twinning, maternal psychiatric 
history of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, affective disorders and any psychiatric disorder, 
degree of urbanization and province of birth. None of these potential confounders were 
associated with fT4 or hypothyroxinemia (Table 1). Preterm birth was associated with case-
control status, fT4 under the median and hypothyroxinemia at p < 0.1. There were also 
associations between birth province and hypothyroidism, between degree of urbanization 
and subclinical hypothyroidism and between twinning and subclinical hyperthyroidism 
(Supplemental Table 1).
We first analyzed schizophrenia in relation to maternal hypothyroxinemia as shown in Table 
2 (defined as fT4 < 10th percentile and normal TSH). The proportion of subjects with

 maternal hypothyroxinemia was 11.8% among schizophrenia subjects compared to 8.6% 
among controls, yielding a significant association (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.22 – 2.50, p=0.002). 
In a sensitivity analysis, we defined hypothyroxinemia as fT4 under the 5th percentile in 
controls and normal TSH. Using that alternative definition, the respective proportions with 
maternal hypothyroxinemia were 6.6% (n=52) among schizophrenia subjects and 5.0% 
(n=39) among controls, and the OR was 1.62 (95% CI=0.99 – 2.63, p=0.055).
We next analyzed maternal fT4 defined as a continuous variable. The distribution of 
maternal fT4 in cases and controls is shown in Figure 1A. As shown in Figure 1B, there was 
a linear association between log units of maternal fT4 and log odds of offspring 
schizophrenia. In the conditional logistic regression analysis, the odds of schizophrenia 
decreased by almost 50% per log unit increase of maternal fT4 (OR=0.54, 95% 
CI=0.31-0.94, p=0.028). The association between log-transformed TSH and schizophrenia 
was not significant (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.84 – 1.02, p=0.108).
While none of the potential confounders were associated with both schizophrenia and fT4 or 
hypothyroxinemia (Table 1), we conducted additional adjustments for variables that are 
strongly related to schizophrenia. Following adjustment of hypothyroxinemia for maternal 
psychiatric history, province of birth and maternal cotinine, a biomarker of smoking, the 
OR's remained similar and the associations between hypothyroxinemia and schizophrenia 
were statistically significant (Table 3). When fT4 was treated as a continuous variable (log-
fT4), and adjusted for cotinine, the OR increased by 23.1% and the p-value became non-
significant (Table 3).
We considered the possibility that mothers of cases might have failed to adequately increase 
TSH for the magnitude of their hypothyroxinemia. In an analysis of mothers with 
hypothyroxinemia we did not find evidence for this: the correlations between continuous 
TSH and continuous fT4 were only slightly higher among cases (r2 = 0.029, p = 0.079) than 
controls (r2 = 0.014, p = 0.299).
In a supplemental analysis we examined whether other maternal serologically defined 
thyroid disorders were associated with schizophrenia (Table 2). Maternal hypothyroidism 
was not associated with schizophrenia (p=0.827). However, the number of subjects was 
small as clinical hypothyroidism was documented in mothers of only six cases and eight 
controls. Further, in this exploratory analysis, subclinical hyperthyroidism was significantly 
associated with offspring schizophrenia (OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.14 – 3.20, p=0.014).
Because the risk of schizophrenia varies by sex (12), we conducted supplementary sex-
stratified analyses of the association between maternal fT4 and schizophrenia: the odds ratio 
for males was 0.36 (95% CI 0.17 – 0.76) and for females was 0.87 (95% CI 0.40 – 1.94). 
However, when pooling both sexes, the sex-by-fT4 interaction term was not statistically 
significant (p=0.11).
Analysis of mediation
We tested for preterm birth and birth weight as potential mediators of the association 
between hypothyroxinemia and schizophrenia. As noted in Table 1, preterm birth was

 related to schizophrenia, fT4 under the median and hypothyroxinemia. As expected, when 
the relationship between hypothyroxinemia and schizophrenia was adjusted for preterm 
birth, the OR decreased by 28% and the p-value was no longer significant (OR=1.36, 95% 
CI 0.86 – 2.15, p = 0.184). Though birth weight was not associated with hypothyroxinemia 
or schizophrenia (Table 1), for the purpose of comparability, we also adjusted for birth 
weight. The OR was decreased by 22% and the p-value was non-significant (OR=1.43, 
95%CI 0.90 – 2.26, p=0.130).
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated, in a nationwide cohort, that early to mid-gestational serologically 
defined maternal hypothyroxinemia was associated with an increased odds of offspring 
schizophrenia. As noted in the introduction, maternal hypothyroxinemia alters fetal brain 
development (1, 2), supporting its plausibility as a risk factor for schizophrenia, largely 
considered to be a neurodevelopmental disorder (31, 32). Hypothyroxinemia during early 
gestation, the period during which serum specimens were drawn in this study, has been 
associated with neurocognitive deficits (9-11), while mixed results were found when the 
same exposure was measured during the late second trimester or third trimester as noted in a 
recent review (1).
Although none of the covariates met the a priori confounding criteria, for reassurance, we 
further adjusted for factors that were strongly related to schizophrenia. Following adjustment 
for maternal psychopathology, province of birth and maternal cotinine, a metabolite of 
nicotine measured in the sera, the association between hypothyroxinemia and schizophrenia 
remained similar to the unadjusted analysis and was statistically significant.
We also examined whether continuously defined fT4 was related to risk of schizophrenia. 
While we observed an association in the unadjusted analysis, adjustment for maternal 
smoking resulted in a greater than 20% change in the odds ratio (towards the null) and the 
finding was no longer statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between 
maternal fT4 and schizophrenia is present only when fT4 levels are below a particular 
threshold, which in this study was defined as the lowest tenth percent of the distribution. 
Another possibility is that there was not sufficient power to detect a significant finding when 
the exposure was defined as continuous fT4. This is supported by the fact that the confidence 
intervals in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses of log-fT4 overlap considerably though the 
point estimates are in the same direction.
One potential explanation for the association between maternal hypothyroxinemia and 
schizophrenia is that hypothyroxinemia contributes to altered fetal gene expression, which 
adversely affects fetal brain development (2). In neurons, deiodinase-2 converts T4 to 
triiodothyronine (T3), the active form, which regulates gene expression by binding to 
nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (33). Many T3-regulated genes are involved in 
neurodevelopmental processes such as circuit formation, neuronal migration, myelination, 
axon guidance or synaptogenesis (2, 34). It has been suggested that T3-regulated gene 
expression is a mechanism accounting for some histological abnormalities seen in offspring 
exposed to maternal hypothyroxinemia (35). In rodent studies, experimentally induced

 maternal hypothyroxinemia causes offspring histological abnormalities, such as abnormal 
distributions of neurons in the hippocampus (4, 36). This is particularly relevant to 
schizophrenia, in which morphological and functional abnormalities of the hippocampus 
have been documented in patients (37).
Another possible explanation for the finding is mediation by preterm birth and/or low birth 
weight. We considered preterm birth and low birth weight as potential mediators rather than 
as confounders based on the following rationale: 1) hypothyroxinemia is measured early in 
gestation, and these variables are defined at a considerably later time point; 2) and the 
prevailing view from prior studies is that hypothyroidism has an impact on these outcomes 
(30, 38) and hypothyroxinemia during the first trimester has also been associated with 
preterm birth (25); 3) there is a prior literature indicating that preterm birth/low birth weight 
are risk factors for schizophrenia (20). In accord with standard epidemiologic texts (29), we 
first tested for relationships between these covariates and hypothyroxinemia/fT4 and 
schizophrenia, respectively. Preterm birth was related to schizophrenia, fT4 under the 
median, and hypothyroxinemia and thus met criteria for a potential mediator. When 
hypothyroxinemia was adjusted for preterm birth, the OR decreased by 28% and the p-value 
became non-significant (p=0.19). This suggests partial mediation by preterm birth. Low 
birth weight was not related to schizophrenia, fT4 under the median and hypothyroxinemia, 
suggesting that it did not mediate the association. Following adjustment, for birth weight the 
association was attenuated though somewhat less than for preterm birth (22%), with p-value 
0.13, which may reflect the fact that birth weight is highly correlated with the mediator 
preterm birth.
We did not find an association for maternal hypothyroidism, a more severe condition than 
hypothyroxinemia. The lack of association between maternal hypothyroidism and 
schizophrenia is due to low statistical power, as only six mothers of cases had 
hypothyroidism. Maternal hypothyroxinemia has been related to subtle neurodevelopmental 
deficits (3), some of which are observed in schizophrenia (12), while maternal 
hypothyroidism has been associated with more substantial developmental disturbances in 
offspring such as mental retardation, stunted growth and deafness (3). The presence of these 
more severe disorders, which may have made it difficult to properly evaluate schizophrenia 
symptoms, could potentially also explain the lack of an association.
The one result that was not hypothesized a priori was the association between subclinical 
hyperthyroidism and schizophrenia. Maternal hyperthyroidism in relation to schizophrenia 
has been reported previously (39). In that study, the proportion of retrospectively reported 
thyroid disease during pregnancy was higher among mothers of schizophrenia patients than 
among mothers of patients with other psychiatric disorders. Further, among mothers of 
schizophrenia subjects who had a thyroid disorder, hyperthyroidism was more common than 
hypothyroidism (39). The fact that our result was derived from a supplemental analysis and 
no previous study examined subclinical hyperthyroidism necessitates caution in the 
interpretation.
As noted, a supplemental analysis revealed that the relationship between maternal fT4 and 
schizophrenia was observed only among males. Differential loss of females in gestation

 should be considered as an explanation. However, the findings should be interpreted with 
caution because the sex-by-fT4 interaction term did not reach statistical significance 
(p=0.11).
It is also worth considering the potential relationships of hypothyroxinemia with iodine 
deficiency and body mass index (BMI). Hypothyroxinemia is common in areas of iodine 
deficiency (40). Nonetheless, in iodine sufficient areas, controlled trials have not found any 
evidence that additional iodine supplementation reduces the risk of maternal 
hypothyroxinemia (40, 41). In Finland, pregnant women have adequate iodine levels because 
this nutrient is routinely supplemented in dietary salt (42). Another factor to consider is body 
mass index (BMI), given its association with schizophrenia (43) and the previously 
demonstrated correlations between high BMI and hypothyroxinemia (24, 25). Unfortunately, 
we were not able to examine the relationship between BMI and hypothyroxinemia in our 
data.
The study has several strengths including the nationwide cohort, the large sample size, the 
prospective and systematic collection of maternal sera the comprehensive ascertainment of 
nearly all pregnancies and schizophrenia cases in Finland born beginning in 1983, and data 
on many prospectively measured covariates that allowed for adjustment of confounding and 
testing of mediation. One unexpected finding to emerge from this analysis was that twinning 
was greater in controls than in schizophrenia cases. Previous studies have shown instead that 
twinning is increased in schizophrenia (44) or no relation to schizophrenia (45). While we 
have no ready explanation for this, we speculated on the reasons in a previous publication 
(13).
Several methodological limitations need to be considered. First, information on maternal 
thyroid function was available only for one time point for each pregnancy, which was in 
early to mid-gestation, but not later during pregnancy. Hence, it is unclear whether the 
alterations in thyroid function represent a transient or continuous exposure and whether 
similar associations would have been found later in pregnancy. Second, data were not 
available on maternal thyroid replacement, such as levothyroxine, for thyroid disorders. 
However, pregnant mothers of the vast majority of the individuals with low fT4 did not have 
clinical hypothyroidism, and we demonstrated a relationship between maternal fT4 levels 
across a considerable distribution of levels of this exposure. In addition, low fT4 is not 
screened for during pregnancy. Therefore, it is unlikely that maternal thyroid replacement 
confounded the result. Third, due to the fact that the cohort was born relatively recently, the 
age at the first treatment of the schizophrenia cases in this study was relatively low (mean 
19.1; maximum 26). Therefore, the results may not be representative of schizophrenia cases 
with onset later in life. Finally, though we tested whether several key covariates were 
associated with both the exposure and the outcome, there is the potential for residual 
confounding.
Further, it is unlikely that maternal hypothyroxinemia is a risk factor that is specific to 
schizophrenia. As noted above, this exposure has pleiotropic effects on offspring 
neurodevelopment and cognition (1, 2). Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism and mental 
retardation share several risk factors (46) and it has been hypothesized that their

 neurodevelopmental components overlap (47). One study showed that maternal 
hypothyroxinemia is a risk factor for autistic symptoms as assessed by parental 
questionnaires (48), but low maternal thyroxine was not related to the diagnosis of childhood 
autism in work from our group in this same birth cohort (49). We therefore suggest future 
studies of maternal hypothyroxinemia as a risk factor for other psychiatric disorders. 
Likewise, it would be of interest to examine whether the association between maternal 
hypothyroxinemia and schizophrenia is mediated by premorbid cognitive deficits, which 
have been observed in schizophrenia (12). Furthermore, it is possible that maternal 
hypothyroxinemia interacts with genetic variants, other endogenous factors, or 
environmental insults to increase the risk of schizophrenia. In the case of maternal immune 
activation (MIA) as a risk factor for schizophrenia, a "two-hit" model has been suggested 
(50). In a rodent study, an initial insult of MIA interacted synergistically with later stress 
during adolescence to cause neuropathological and behavioral abnormalities in offspring 
similar to those found in schizophrenia (51). Given that rodent models of maternal 
hypothyroxinemia have been developed, it would be intriguing to conduct a similarly 
designed study in which maternal hypothyroxinemia is tested as the initial insult.
To conclude, we found an association between low maternal thyroxine and increased odds of 
offspring schizophrenia. The finding is biologically plausible as it is consistent with an 
extensive literature on maternal hypothyroxinemia as a disruptor of offspring 
neurodevelopment (1, 2) and with extensive evidence that schizophrenia is largely a 
neurodevelopmental disorder (31, 32). This finding may lead to translational studies aimed 
at examining specific mechanisms by which low maternal thyroxine causes 
neurodevelopmental deviations relevant to schizophrenia at the molecular and cellular level.

 Figure 1. 
The proportion of schizophrenia cases and controls by maternal free thyroid hormone (fT4) 
units (panel A) and the odds of schizophrenia by maternal fT4 (panel B). The categorization 
of fT4 units in panel B correspond to the categorization of fT4 in panel A. Because 
conditional logistic regression used in the main analyses of matched pairs does not provide 
an intercept, the fitted line in panel B is derived from standard logistic regression of log-
transformed fT4 predicting schizophrenia in the data without considering the matching 
(Ncases = 1,010; Ncontrols = 1,010; intercept = 1.60, slope = −0.57, standard error of slope = 
0.27, equaling odds ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence interval = 0.34 – 0.96, p = 0.034).
