Summary
Introduction India accounts for about a fifth of cardiovascular deaths globally, but nationally representative data on 
mortality trends are not yet available. In this nationwide mortality study, we aimed to assess the trends in ischaemic 
heart disease and stroke mortality over 15 years using the Million Death Study.
Methods We determined national and subnational cardiovascular mortality rates and trends by sex and birth cohort 
using cause of death ascertained by verbal autopsy from 2001 to 2013 among 2·4 million households. We derived 
mortality rates for ischaemic heart disease and stroke by applying mortality proportions to UN mortality estimates for 
India and projected the rates from 2000 to 2015.
Findings Cardiovascular disease caused more than 2·1 million deaths in India in 2015 at all ages, or more than a 
quarter of all deaths. At ages 30–69 years, of 1·3 million cardiovascular deaths, 0·9 million (68·4%) were caused by 
ischaemic heart disease and 0·4 million (28·0%) by stroke. At these ages, the probability of dying from ischaemic heart 
disease increased during 2000–15, from 10·4% to 13·1% in men and 4·8% to 6·6% in women. Ischaemic heart 
disease mortality rates in rural areas increased rapidly and surpassed those in urban areas. By contrast, the probability 
of dying from stroke decreased from 5·7% to 5·0% in men and 5·0% to 3·9% in women. A third of premature stroke 
deaths occurred in the northeastern states, inhabited by a sixth of India’s population, where rates increased 
significantly and were three times higher than the national average. The increased mortality rates of ischaemic heart 
disease nationally and stroke in the northeastern states were higher in the cohorts of adults born in the 1970s onwards, 
than in earlier decades. A large and growing proportion of the ischaemic heart disease nationally and stroke deaths in 
high-burden states reported earlier diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, but low medication use.
Interpretation The unexpectedly diverse patterns of cardiovascular mortality require investigation to identify the role 
of established and new cardiovascular risk factors. Secondary prevention with effective and inexpensive long-term 
treatment and adult smoking cessation could prevent substantial numbers of premature deaths. Without progress 
against the control of cardiovascular disease in India, global goals to reduce non-communicable diseases by 2030 will 
be difficult to achieve.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease, comprising mostly ischaemic 
heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of death 
worldwide, accounting for 17·7 million deaths annually.1 
Of these deaths, 6·2 million (35%) occur in middle age 
(30–69 years).1 WHO estimates that India accounts for 
just over a fifth of these deaths1 and therefore reduction 
of global cardiovascular mortality greatly depends on 
India, where cardiovascular disease develops a decade 
earlier in life compared with high-income countries.2
Cardiovascular mortality has not been measured directly 
and systematically across India, with evidence on burdens 
mostly drawn from small, local studies.2–4 Over the past 
15 years, unequal distribution of the country’s rapid eco-
nomic growth and urbanisation has probably contributed 
to marked regional differences in the key risk factors 
for cardiovascular mortality.5 Understanding of the differ-
ences in cardiovascular mortality by sex, rural and urban 
residence, and age across India can help to plan prevent-
ion and treatment services and identify causes that 
might differ from cardiovascular risk factors documented 
in high-income countries.6 We aimed to examine the 
trends in ischaemic heart disease and stroke mortality 
using the Million Death Study, a large ongoing nationally 
representative mortality study.7

Registrar General of India (RGI) established the Sample 
Registration System in 1971.8 After every decennial census, 
the RGI partitions India into 1 million small units, each of 
about 150–300 households. The RGI then selects a random 
sample of these units to monitor deaths over the next 
decade. 6671 and 7597 units were selected after the 1991 and 
2001 censuses, respectively, representing the 2·4 million 
households included in the Million Death Study. This 
study collected information on deaths in 2001–03 and 
2004–14, based on the 1991 and 2001 censuses, respectively. 
Every 6 months during the study period, 900 trained non-
medical RGI surveyors investigated each death by 
interviewing a household member of the deceased using a 
modified WHO verbal autopsy questionnaire.9 The 
structured questionnaire captures awareness of any 
previous physician-diagnosed condition such as heart 
disease and stroke, and in 2004 we modified the quest-
ionnaire to include medication use. The verbal autopsy 
also includes a standard list of cardinal symptoms for the 
interviewer to elicit a chronological narrative of events 
preceding the death, written in the local language. Two 
trained physicians are randomly selected to review each 
questionnaire from those who read the relevant language, 
out of a pool of 400. Each independently determines the 
most probable underlying cause of death using an 
electronic interface. Each physician anonymously reviews 
the other physician’s diagnosis and rationale to reconcile 
initial differences. A third senior physician adjudicates 
persisting disagreements.
In this nationwide mortality study, we defined causes 
of death using strict guidelines and coding on the basis 
of the 10th revision of the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 
(appendix).7 Myocardial infarction was defined as an 
episode of severe chest pain lasting between 30 min and 
24 h with at least one additional symptom such as 
shortness of breath, vomiting, or left arm pain.10 Stroke 
death was defined as a sudden onset of paralysis of 
one or more limbs in the month preceding death in 
combination with at least one additional symptom, such 
as altered speech, loss of sensation, or loss of vision.10 
Stroke could not be further categorised by subtype. 
These criteria are consistent with the international 
case definitions that endorse the use of verbal autopsy to 
classify cardiovascular deaths in settings without com-
plete death registration and certification.11 The verbal 
autopsy yields results comparable to in-hospital vascular 
deaths.10 4043 (5%) of 84 625 deaths that occurred in 
2002–03 were randomly reinvestigated by an independent 
team in 2004, and the results were highly consistent.9
Statistical analysis
We determined the age-specific proportion of deaths due 
to ischaemic heart disease and stroke among men and 
women for each year for 2001–13, weighted by the 
sampling probability of the rural and urban population 
for each state. We smoothed these proportions using 
3-year centred moving averages and extrapolated to 
2000 and 2014–15 using procedures described earlier.12 To 
derive age-standardised mortality rates for ischaemic 
heart disease and stroke, we applied these proportions to 
the national mortality rates reported by the UN Population 
Division (2000–15)13 and standardised rates to the WHO 
standard population.14 We then determined age-
standardised mortality rates for rural, urban, and state 
populations by partitioning the national death totals 
using Sample Registration System vital statistics.8 We 
defined adult men and women as those aged 15 years or 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE and Embase for articles on the adult 
population of India published from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 6, 2017, 
using the search terms “exp India/ep” and “exp Cardiovascular 
Diseases/mo” in MEDLINE, and “exp India/ep”, “exp 
cardiovascular disease/”, and “exp mortality/ or exp premature 
mortality/” in Embase, with no language restrictions. We 
identified 18 studies measuring cardiovascular mortality, most 
of which were hospital based and none of which were 
nationally representative.
Added value of this study
This is the first nationally representative study to measure 
cardiovascular mortality in India, providing the most complete 
picture of longitudinal mortality trends to date. In less than 
two decades, ischaemic heart disease mortality in rural India has 
surged and surpassed that of urban areas, whereas stroke 
mortality has diverged across geographical areas. 
Stroke mortality is increasing in a small cluster of high-burden 
states in the northeastern region of India, representing a sixth of 
the country’s population, yet accounting for a third of total 
stroke deaths. We uncovered a large secondary prevention target 
for ischaemic heart disease and stroke: most deaths were among 
individuals with previously known cardiovascular disease, and at 
least half were not taking any regular medications.
Implications of all the available evidence
Cardiovascular mortality in India shows unexpected patterns 
that have not been well characterised previously. Despite 
uncertainties about the causes that account for the marked 
divergence between ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and 
between stroke patterns in different regions, a large proportion 
of Indians with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are presently 
untreated and would benefit from secondary prevention and 
smoking cessation. Without progress in India against 
cardiovascular disease, the Sustainable Development Goals to 
reduce cardiovascular disease and non-communicable disease 
mortality by 2030 will be difficult to achieve.

older. We excluded a small proportion of children younger 
than 15 years who died from cardiovascular disease.
Because of the large sample size of the Million Death 
Study, uncertainty is mostly attributable to cause of 
death assignment rather than to random error.9 We 
therefore estimated the influence of coding differences 
by assigning lower and upper bounds for estimates of 
mortality rate. The lower bound included deaths initially 
assigned to the same category by both physicians, 
whereas the upper bound included deaths initially 
assigned to a category by either one or both phys-
icians. To estimate the effect of ill-defined causes of 
death (appendix), we redistributed ill-defined deaths 
proportionally to other causes for each 5-year age group. 
We derived average age-standardised annual mortality 
rates at ages 30–69 years by state among men and 
women for 2001–04 and 2011–13 and examined the 
association using linear correlation, weighted by 
population size. Because stroke mortality varied 
considerably across states, we separately analysed the 
subgroup of high-burden states (ie, those with high 
stroke mortality); all other states were classified as low 
burden (appendix). We then estimated the annual 
percentage change of age-standardised and age-specific 
mortality rates for 2001–15 using the age-period-cohort 
method (appendix). We computed rate ratios of age-
specific mortality rates in each 5-year birth cohort and 
5-year calendar period relative to the median birth cohort 
(1961–65) and calendar period (2005–10), respectively. 
We used SAS version 9.4 and R version 3.3.2 for analyses, 
and ArcMap version 10.5 for maps.

Results
We examined 472 113 deaths of individuals older than 
15 years from 2001 to 2013, including 111 977 deaths due 
to cardiovascular disease (68 904 [61·5%] adult men 
and 43 073 [38·5%] women; appendix). Cardiovascular 
disease caused more than 2·1 million deaths in India in 
2015 at all ages, or over a quarter of all deaths (table 1). 
Total cardiovascular deaths comprised 1·3 million cardio-
vascular deaths at ages 30–69 years: 0·9 million (68·4%) 
from ischaemic heart disease, 0·4 million (28·0%) 
from stroke, and 47 000 (3·5%) from rheum 
atic heart 
diseases and other cardiovascular diseases. Between 
2000 and 2015, the national age-standardised mortality 
rate from ischaemic heart disease increased among 
men and women (figure 1, table 2), and the pattern was 
similar in most states. The highest rates in 2015 were in 
Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu. In 2000, the 
age-standardised mortality rate of ischaemic heart 
disease at all ages in India was similar to high-income 
countries such as the UK. By 2015, in India these 
mortality rates rose to more than double those of the 
UK or USA.
By contrast, the age-standardised mortality rates at all 
ages for stroke fell among men and women during the 
15 years. The USA and UK showed similar downward 
trends in age-standardised stroke mortality at all ages, 
but the rates in India remained about three times higher 
throughout.
The subsequent analyses focus on mortality at ages 
30–69 years as these deaths have less misclassification 
of causes than deaths at ages 70 years or older,9 and 
because they represent avoidable deaths of greater public 
health importance.16 The geographical distribution of 
stroke mortality rates varied more than did ischaemic 
heart disease mortality rates (figure 2). A third of pre-
m 
ature stroke deaths occurred in a small cluster of states 
and union territories representing about a sixth of 
India’s population. High-burden states for male stroke

Numbers of cause-specific deaths were generated from study estimates. Subnational totals were adjusted to match national totals. Totals might not add up exactly because of rounding. Deaths in children 
younger than 15 years are excluded from totals because cardiovascular deaths are rare in this age group.

deaths were Assam, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and 
the northeast states (ie, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, 
Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, and Meghalaya), 
and high-burden states for female stroke deaths were 
Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and the 
northeastern states.
In these states, stroke mortality increased significantly 
and were about three times higher than the national 
average. At ages 30–69 years, stroke mortality comprised 
about three-fifths of all cardiovascular deaths in states 
with a high burden of stroke versus about a quarter of all 
cardiovascular deaths in the remaining low-burden states 
(table 1). The proportion of cardiovascular deaths to all 
deaths at these ages was higher in the states with a high 
burden of stroke than in the low-burden states.
Stroke mortality rates at ages 30–69 years fell in low-
burden states. However, stroke mortality rates increased 
or did not change substantially in high-burden states 
in men and women (figure 3). States with high stroke 
mortality rates had low mortality rates of ischaemic heart 
disease and vice versa (appendix).
At ages 30–69 years, the probability of dying from 
ischaemic heart disease (in the absence of other causes) 
between 2000 and 2015 increased from 10·4% to 13·1% in 
men and from 4·8 to 6·6% in women. By contrast, the 
probability of dying from stroke fell marginally from 
5·7% to 5·0% in men and 5·0% to 3·9% in women 
(table 2).
To further explore these results, we examined rural and 
urban differences and age-specific trends, and did age-
period cohort analyses. Although ischaemic heart disease 
mortality at ages 30–69 years was lower in rural areas 
compared with urban areas at the start of the study, rural 
rates rose rapidly, surpassing urban rates by 2015 in both 
sexes (figure 4). Stroke mortality at ages 30–69 years in 
the high-burden states also rose more sharply in rural 
than in urban areas in both sexes. In states with a low 
burden of stroke, stroke mortality rates fell more rapidly 
in urban than rural areas in both sexes.
From 2000 to 2015, age-specific mortality rates 
increased among middle-aged adults for ischaemic 
heart disease nationally and for stroke in high-burden

of Disease. Data for the UK and the USA are from the WHO Mortality Database;15 we forecasted these rates to 2015

All rates are weighted by sampling probability and standardised to the WHO population. *Bounds are defined as estimates including only deaths immediately assigned to the same cause of death category by 
two physicians (lower bound), and deaths immediately assigned to the cause of death category by only one physician (upper bound). †Period risk is the probability of cause-specific death if no other causes of death 
occurred. The age-specific period risk is calculated by multiplying the mortality rate by the duration of the age range. The period risk for ages 30–69 years is the cumulative total of the age-specific period risks.

states, and age-specific mortality trends for stroke 
declined in the low-burden states (appendix). Age-
period cohort analysis showed that the maximum 
increase for ischaemic heart disease mortality for men 
was 2·4% annually (95% CI 2·0–2·8) in those aged 
50–54 years and for women was 2·8% (1·6–3·9 in 
those aged 35–39 years; appendix). The relative risk 
of ischaemic heart disease mortality increased with 
each successive birth cohort among men, with the 
highest increases among the most recent birth 
cohorts for both sexes (appendix). Compared with 
women born in the 1960s, women born in the late 1970s 
had a relative risk of 1·42 (95% CI 1·25–1·60; excess 
mortality 42%), whereas among men, the relative risk 
was 1·30 (1·21–1·40; excess mortality 30%). In the 
high-burden states, age-standardised stroke mortality 
rates rose by 5·4% (4·8–6·0) per year among men and 
1·5% (0·8–2·3) per year among women, peaking at

ages 40–49 years. Men born in the 1980s had a relative 
risk of 3·42 (2·53–4·62). In the low-burden states, 
age-standardised stroke mortality fell by 1·5% (95% CI 
1·0–2·1) per year and 2·7% (2·1–3·4) per year among 
men and women, respectively, with nadirs at 
55–59 years of age. In these states, Indians born after 
1960 had about half the risk of dying from stroke versus 
those born in the 1930s.
The proportion of those dying of ischaemic heart disease 
with a diagnosis of pre-existing heart disease rose in both 
sexes between 2001 and 2013 (figure 5, appendix). At least 
half of these individuals were taking no regular med-
ications (54·1% of men and 50·4% of women in 2013, 
with 22·2% and 22·8%, respectively, reporting unknown 
medication status). In high-burden states, the proportion

further increased in both sexes, and the majority of these 
individuals were taking no medications (56·6% of men 
and 60·1% of women in 2013, with 23·3% and 24·0%, 
respectively, reporting unknown medication status). In 
states with a low burden of stroke, little change occurred 
in the proportion of individuals who died of stroke and 
reported a history of stroke, but a substantial portion of 
those individuals were taking no medications before death 
(47·7% among men and 48·2% among women in 2013, 
with 16·1% and 15·4%, respectively, reporting unknown 
medication status). Missing data were minimal (2·7% for 
medication status, ≤0·05% for all other variables).
Discussion
Ischaemic heart disease mortality is rising in India, more 
in rural than urban areas, with the greatest increases in 
young adults—especially those born after 1970. Nationally, 
decreases in stroke deaths were small, but this masks a 
previously undocumented cluster of high stroke mortality 
in northeast India with entirely different trends over 
time than the rest of the country. A large and growing 
proportion of the ischaemic heart disease and stroke 
deaths in high-burden states reported earlier diagnosis of 
cardiovascular disease, but low medication use.
Although mostly documented in high-income coun-
tries, established cardiovascular risk factors might account 
for the urban–rural variations in ischaemic heart disease 
and stroke, and the comparatively high cardio 
vascular 
mortality rates in India. Every 20 mm Hg increase in 
systolic blood pressure doubles the risk of cardiovascular 
mortality.17 The rural prevalence of hyper 
tension has 
reportedly increased to match the urban prevalence,18 and 
this increase could be one factor driving the observed 
urban–rural differences in mortality rates. Smokers have 
large excesses of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic heart 
disease and stroke,19,20 and men who are illiterate and 
reside in rural areas are increasingly likely to smoke 
manufactured cigarettes as opposed to locally grown 
beedis.21 Smoking cessation rates in middle age are far 
below those of high-income countries.21 Hence, although 
not directly studied here, smoking is a major determinant 
of the age and region specific variation in cardiovascular 
disease rates. Although diabetes is increasing more 
rapidly in urban than rural areas,22 the rates of untreated 
diabetes in rural versus urban areas are still not known. In 
Mexico, the risks of cardiovascular death from diabetes 
(which is mostly untreated or undertreated), was much 
higher than the risks from diabetes in high-income 
countries (which is mostly treated).23 Thus, reduced 
quality, availability, and accessibility of secondary treat-
ment in rural areas might play an important part in 
the observed rural–urban disparities in cardiovascular 
mortality.24
The role of other established risk factors in India is less 
clear. In high-income countries, increased body-mass 
index (BMI) increases ischaemic heart disease and stroke 
mortality among obese individuals.25 However, evidence 
from high-income countries might not be generalisable 
to the unique Indian phenotype of central obesity. A low 
BMI might paradoxically predict increased mortality in 
India for unknown reasons.26 Further research is required 
to confirm how obesity and other established risk fac-
tors affect cardiovascular mortality in India. Evidence 
suggests that high-carbohydrate diets increase ischaemic 
heart disease risk,27 although carbohydrate intake has 
remained relatively stable in rural and urban areas.2
Furthermore, the risk factors driving ischaemic heart 
disease mortality might differ from those affecting 
stroke in high-burden states. Northeastern states have 
sub 
stantial populations of Sino-Tibetan ethnicity,22 
and these populations might resemble the Chinese and 
Mongolian populations in which stroke dominates

ischaemic heart disease. The incidence of haemorrhagic 
stroke appears to be particularly high among the Chinese 
population,6 and hypertension is the primary risk 
factor for this subtype. Although dietary factors, such 
as excessive salt intake, might increase hypertension 
prevalence in northeastern states,28 hypertension pre-
valence varies substantially across high-burden states. 
Inadequate stroke care might have a role in increas-
ing mortality rates,6 and novel risk factors such as en-
demic infections might also be associated with stroke in 
these areas.6
On current trends, the UN Sustainable Development 
Goal to reduce cardiovascular mortality rates at ages 
30–69 years by a third by 2030 is unlikely to be met without 
substantial progress in India. Moreover, ischaemic heart 
disease rates in Mexico and China also rose between 2000 
and 2015.1 Modelled estimates by the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) for India propose higher ischaemic heart 
disease mortality but lower stroke mortality than our 
observed rates.29 The GBD has been criticised on the basis 
of the assumptions required to generate cause-specific 
cardio 
vascular mortality rates for more than 70% of global 
populations for whom no such data exist. Moreover, the 
GBD reclassifies ill-defined causes of death as ischaemic 
heart disease. The 10th revision of the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems code I69—one of the most common stroke 
codes—is also reclassified into various causes including 
ischaemic heart disease. This classification might lead to 
the overestimation of ischaemic heart disease mortality 
rates and the underestimation of stroke mortality rates 
(appendix).
Our findings suggest that a large agenda for secondary 
treatment remains in India. Cheap, generic statins reduce 
cardiovascular mortality by 15% for every 1 mmol/L of 
LDL cholesterol lowered.30 Although statin sales might be 
increasing,31 our finding of low reported medication use is 
consistent with previous estimates that less than 10% of 
Indians with cardiovascular disease use statins reg-
ularly.31,32 Effective long-term management of diabetes and 
hypertension is similarly lacking, particularly in rural 
areas.18,33 Use of the polypill—a combination of generic 
aspirin, antihypertensive, and statin combined into one 
pill—is a widely practicable strategy for India.34 Smoking 
cessation rates remain low,21 and many quit smoking as a 
consequence of rather than to avoid cardiovascular 
disease. However, most health services in India are not set 
up to capture patients with cardiovascular disease or to 
manage established risk factors.35
This is the first nationally representative study to 
measure cardiovascular mortality in India. Verbal autopsy 
remains the only feasible method of defining probable 
causes of death occurring at home, and without medical 
attention in most low-income and middle-income 
countries,36 we used this important tool to uncover the 
most complete picture of longitudinal mortality trends 
to date. However, some limitations exist. First, clinical

autopsy and medical imaging were not available to 
confirm cause of death or stroke subtype. Nevertheless, 
the verbal autopsy is a widely used, validated, and reliable 
instrument for classifying ischaemic heart disease and 
stroke deaths in India.9,10 Further research is required to 
confirm whether haemorrhagic stroke has decreased in 
low-burden states as it has in other countries,37 and to 
assess whether increases in ischaemic heart disease 
mortality might preclude the occurrence of stroke 
mortality as a competing risk. In our data, only a minority 
of individuals who died of ischaemic heart disease 
reported previous stroke (appendix). Second, we had only 
crude data on medication use and were unable to access 
medical records to verify whether the drugs used were 
for cardiovascular disease, which would suggest that 
the extent of secondary treatment is quite low in 
India.30,35 Further research is required to better characterise 
the use of secondary prevention among those with 
cardiovascular disease.
This study has shown that cardiovascular mortality in 
India shows unexpected patterns that have not been 
well characterised previously. In less than two decades, 
ischaemic heart disease mortality in rural India has surged 
and surpassed urban levels, whereas stroke mortality has 
diverged across geographical areas. The National Rural 
Health Mission and the National Program for Prevention 
and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases 
and Stroke play a vital part in improving risk factor 
management and secondary prevention to reduce cardio-
vascular mortality. Improvement and sustaining of these 
programmes are needed to collect local evidence that will 
lead to the understanding of how established and novel 
risk factors operate in India to produce these distinctive 
epidemiological patterns.
