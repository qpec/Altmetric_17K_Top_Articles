Abstract
Background Challenges of maintaining long-term weight
loss are well-established and present significant obstacles in
obesity prevention and treatment. A neglected but potentially
important barrier to weight-loss maintenance is weight
stigmatization.
Purpose We examined the role of weight stigma—experi-
enced and internalized—as a contributor to weight-loss main-
tenance and weight regain in adults.
Methods A diverse, national sample of 2702 American adults
completed an online battery of questionnaires assessing demo-
graphics, weight-loss history, subjective weight category, ex-
perienced and internalized weight stigma, weight-monitoring
behaviors, physical activity, perceived stress, and physical
health. Analyses focused exclusively on participants who in-
dicated that their body weight a year ago was at least 10% less
than their highest weight ever (excluding pregnancy), the
weight loss was intentional, and that attempts to lose or main-
tain weight occurred during the past year (n = 549).
Participants were further classified as weight regainers
(n = 235) or weight-loss maintainers (n = 314) based on sub-
sequent weight loss/gain. Data were collected in 2015 and
analyzed in 2016.
Results Hierarchical logistic regression models showed that
internalized weight stigma and subjective weight category
made significant individual contributions to prediction of
weight-loss maintenance, even after accounting for demo-
graphics, perceived stress, experienced stigma, physical
health, and weight-loss behaviors. For every one-unit increase
in internalized weight stigma, the odds of maintaining weight
loss decreased by 28% (95% CI: 14–40%, p < .001).
Conclusions Findings provide initial evidence that
overlooked psychosocial factors, like weight stigma, may hin-
der weight-loss maintenance. Implications for addressing stig-
ma in obesity-focused clinical interventions are highlighted.

Introduction
Obesity represents one of the greatest causes of preventable
morbidity and mortality in the USA [1]. The high prevalence
rates of obesity in recent decades have been paralleled with an
abundance of studies and clinical trials aiming to identify ef-
fective weight loss interventions. This evidence has demon-
strated outcomes of modest weight loss (e.g., 5–10% of body
weight) through conventional behavioral and pharmaceutical
interventions, which can have clinically significant benefits
for improved health [2]. However, most people do not sustain
weight loss over time, and weight regain is a frequent outcome
[3, 4]. Furthermore, improvements in metabolic risk factors
resulting from initial weight loss are lost once weight is
regained, and even mild degrees of weight gain (e.g., 2–6%)
can cause plasma lipids, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and
insulin levels to return to baseline, or become worse [5]. Thus,
preventing weight regain after initial weight loss has become a

 priority in obesity management, and the effectiveness of
weight-loss interventions relies on the sustainability of
weight-loss maintenance. As a result, there has been increas-
ing emphasis on obesity management approaches that facili-
tate weight maintenance and prevention of weight gain, rather
than a singular focus on weight loss (e.g., a “maintain do not
gain” approach) [6]. Of note, weight maintenance is important
for people of diverse body weight statuses; not just those with
a high body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). Repeatedly, losing and
regaining weight through intentional dieting (weight cycling)
[7] is high in the general population and not limited to indi-
viduals with overweight or obesity [8]. While research has
yielded mixed findings on the harmful consequences of
weight cycling, evidence suggests that increased risks for met-
abolic and cardiovascular diseases resulting from weight cy-
cling are present in health-weight populations [8]. Thus, find-
ing approaches that help people maintain a healthy weight
across diverse BMI statuses is an important objective more
broadly for public health.
Research has identified specific health behaviors that facil-
itate long-term weight-loss maintenance [9], such as high
levels of physical activity, low calorie and fat intake, high
dietary restraint, eating breakfast daily, self-monitoring of
food intake, and regular self-weighing [10]. However, the dif-
ficulties of maintaining long-term weight losses are well
established and continue to present a significant obstacle in
efforts to effectively prevent and treat obesity [11, 12]. People
typically regain a third of their weight loss in the first year and
often regain the rest within 3–5 years [11, 13]. Reasons for
weight regain reflect a multitude of biological, environmental,
behavioral, and psychological factors, which are not yet fully
understood [14]. However, research examining predictors of
weight regain suggest that decreased levels of physical activ-
ity, dietary restraint, frequency of self-weighing, and increased
disinhibition are factors that play a role [15]. As a result,
increasing research has explored potential psychosocial fac-
tors that may affect adherence to behavioral strategies that
facilitate weight loss maintenance, such as social support, per-
ceived stress, and depression [16]. Important research ques-
tions remain, and other psychosocial factors that may affect
weight regain or maintenance have not been adequately stud-
ied, and are needed to obtain a more comprehensive under-
standing of the multiple predictors of weight-loss mainte-
nance. This gap in the field presents an opportunity for social
science disciplines to make novel contributions to this impor-
tant public health issue [17].
A highly relevant and potentially important psychosocial
barrier to weight-loss maintenance that is notably absent in
existing research is weight-related stigmatization. Weight stig-
ma refers to negative societal devaluation of people because of
their excess body weight, and can lead to weight-based ste-
reotypes (e.g., that people with obesity are lazy and lack will-
power), prejudice, or overt forms of discrimination [18].
Several decades of research have documented consistent
weight stigmatization toward individuals who have obesity
in multiple domains of living, including weight-based ineq-
uities and prejudice in employment, educational institutions,
health care, as well as stigmatization in interpersonal relation-
ships and more broadly in the mass media [18]. Weight dis-
crimination has been documented as the third most common
form of discrimination among women and the fourth most
common form of discrimination among men in the USA [19].
Evidence has demonstrated important links between
weight stigmatization and resulting adverse health behaviors
and outcomes, many of which have direct implications for
weight-related health behaviors and weight gain [20]. For ex-
ample, adults who experience weight stigma have increased
risk of depression [21], psychological stress [22, 23], in-
creased calorie consumption [24, 25], binge eating and
maladpative eating behaviors [26, 27], reduced physical activ-
ity [28], heightened physiological stress [29], and increased
weight gain and obesity [30]. Preliminary research also sug-
gests that weight stigmatization is associated with poorer
weight loss treatment outcomes [31], and that clinical inter-
ventions focused on helping individuals adopt adaptive strat-
egies to cope with weight stigma may facilitate weight loss
[32, 33]. Internalization of weight stigma (blaming oneself for
one’s weight, societal devaluation, and stigmatization) may be
particularly detrimental, and is associated with eating pathol-
ogy (such as binge-eating), reduced physical activity, psycho-
logical distress, and poorer weight-loss treatment outcomes
[34–36]. These adverse health outcomes associated with
weight stigma may help to explain recent, national longitudi-
nal research demonstrating an increased risk of obesity and
remaining obese over time among individuals who report
weight discrimination [30, 37]. Importantly, these studies
demonstrated that weight discrimination, but not other forms
of discrimination, predicted future obesity and remaining
obese over time, regardless of sociodemographic factors and
baseline BMI.
In addition, people who perceive themselves to be over-
weight, regardless of their actual level of adiposity, show some
of the same negative health outcomes as those who report
increased weight stigma, including being at increased risk
for weight gain [38] and eating more in response to social
threats [25]. Thus, paradoxically, it may be that the more peo-
ple believe they are overweight, the more difficult it is for
them to maintain weight lost after a diet.
Taken together, this evidence provides a compelling need
to assess weight stigma and self-perception of weight status in
the context of weight-loss maintenance. Despite evidence that
weight stigma contributes to increased psychological distress,
food consumption, binge eating, reduced physical activity,
and obesity, very limited research has examined weight stigma
as a factor that may specifically influence weight regain or
interfere with ability to engage in weight-loss maintenance

 behaviors. To date, the two published studies that have exam-
ined associations between experienced stigma and weight-loss
maintenance demonstrated contradictory findings, potentially
due to the use of different measures (and time periods) of
experienced weight stigma with different treatment-seeking
samples (from different countries), making comparisons diffi-
cult [39, 40]. Thus, the role of experienced weight stigma for
weight-loss maintenance remains unclear, and no research that
we are aware of has studied internalized weight stigma in
addition to experienced weight stigma in this context. To ad-
dress these gaps in research, we aimed to examine the role of
both experienced and internalized weight stigma as potential
contributors to weight-loss maintenance and weight regain in
a national sample of American adults. It was hypothesized that
both experienced and internalized weight stigma would be
associated with poorer weight-loss maintenance.
As a secondary aim, in addition to weight stigma we ex-
amined whether participants’ subjective perceptions of their
own body weight affect weight-loss maintenance. Recent ev-
idence from nationally representative samples of adults in the
USA and UK showed that people who perceived their own
weight status as being overweight were at an increased risk of
subsequent weight gain, regardless of baseline weight status
and whether their weight perceptions were accurate or not
[38]. In the current study, we hypothesized that people who
categorized themselves as overweight—regardless of their ac-
tual weight—would be less likely to maintain weight loss.
However, we made no predictions about whether this effect
would remain once experienced and internalized stigma was
taken into account.
Methods
Participants
A diverse, national sample of 3087 American adults were
randomly drawn from a national survey panel administered
by Survey Sampling International (SSI), which includes over
two million active research respondents [41]. Online recruit-
ment by SSI is derived from more than 3400 sources to
achieve demographic and psychographic diversity within the
online population. SSI carefully screens panelists, and em-
ploys validation processes that compare respondent demo-
graphic characteristics to multiple databases. Panelists are 18
years or older, and quotas were established for sex, income
groups, and race, to approximate U.S. census characteristics.
Exclusions were made if participants had missing data or im-
probable values on key variables such as height and/or weight
(n = 312), or for statistical outliers on these variables (n = 73),
resulting in a final sample of 2702 participants. The current
study focused exclusively on participants in the sample who
indicated that their body weight a year ago was at least 10%
less than their highest weight ever (excluding pregnancy in
women) and that they had deliberately tried to lose weight.
Further, participants whose highest weight BMI was classified
as “underweight” (n = 66) were not included in the analyses
due to concerns about possible eating disorders. All partici-
pants signified that they had tried to lose or maintain their
weight during the past year (n = 549). Participants were then
classified as either weight regainers (n = 235) or weight-loss
maintainers (n = 314) based on whether or not they were able
to keep weight off over the next year (see below).
Measures
In July of 2015, participants completed an online battery of
self-report questionnaires to assess demographic characteris-
tics (height, weight, age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, in-
come), weight-loss history, perceived stress, perceived physi-
cal health, subjective weight category, weight stigma, weight-
monitoring behaviors (e.g., frequency of eating breakfast),
and physical activity.
Weight-Loss Maintenance Classification
Participants were asked to report their current height and
weight, their weight a year ago, and their maximum weight
(excluding pregnancy) [42]. All participants who indicated
that their body weight a year ago was at least 10% less than
their highest weight ever were then classified as either weight
regainers if they reported a gain of >5% of body weight from
1 year ago to their current weight or weight-loss maintainers if
their current weight did not surpass 5% of their weight a year
ago [43]. Only those participants who responded “yes” to the
question “During the past year, have you done anything to try
to lose weight or keep from gaining weight?” [44] (n = 549)
were included in these classified groups. BMI of participants
was calculated and stratified using clinical guidelines from the
Centers for Disease Control [45].
Perceived Stress and Perceived Health
Perceived stress was measured using a four-item perceived
stress scale [46]. This measure asks participants to indicate
the extent to which they have felt stress in the last month.
Responses were measured on 0 (never) to 4 (very often)
scales. The scale displayed adequate internal consistency in
this sample (Cronbach’s α = .72). Responses were summed to
create a composite measure.
Self-perceived physical health was assessed with the phys-
ical health quality of life subscale of the World Health
Organization Quality of Life Scale-Brief [47]. The 7-item sub-
scale asked participants to rate their quality of life (e.g., ability
to function in daily life activities) and satisfaction with health
(e.g., capacity to work, sleep, access to health services) during

 the preceding 2 weeks on a 5-point scale. Cronbach’s α in this
sample is .83.
Weight-Loss Maintenance Behaviors
Participants responded to four questions concerning how fre-
quently they engage in specific behaviors that have been
linked to weight-loss maintenance. Specifically, participants
were asked how many days a week they eat breakfast (0 =
never, 7 = every day) [42], how often they weigh themselves
(1 = less than once a month, 5 = several times per day) [48],
and two questions measuring the extent to which they monitor
their diet (i.e., recording food and beverage intake, measuring
and weighing food; 1 = never, 5 = every day) [49]. The two
dietary monitoring questions—which were significantly cor-
related (r = .46, p < .001)—were combined into a single indi-
cator of dietary monitoring.
The validated Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire
[50] was used to assess the frequency that participants engage
in leisure-time physical activity over a typical week.
Participants were asked four questions to indicate how many
times on average they engage in different types of light, mod-
erate, or strenuous physical activity for at least 15 min in
duration. The scoring formula for this measure weights stren-
uous activity more heavily than moderate and light activity,
and higher scores indicate more weekly leisure activity.
Weight Stigma and Subjective Weight Category
Weight stigma was measured in two ways: experienced
weight stigma and internalized weight stigma. To gauge ex-
perienced weight stigma, participants were asked whether
they had ever been teased, treated unfairly, or discriminated
against because of their weight. These experiences were
summed to create an experienced stigma scale that ranged
from 0 (never experienced weight stigma) to 3 (experienced
all three types) [51]. Internalized weight stigma was measured
using the Modified Weight Bias Internalization Scale [52],
which assesses the extent to which participants apply
weight-based stereotypes to themselves and judge themselves
negatively due to their body weight. In line with recent evi-
dence on the psychometric properties of this measure [53], the
first item was dropped to improve item-to-total correlation,
resulting in 10 items, which were then averaged. Each item
was rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 =
strongly agree). Cronbach’s α in this sample is .94.
To measure subjective weight category, participants were
asked how they would describe their current weight status
from the options of (1) “very underweight”, (2) “under-
weight”, (3) “just about right”, (4) “overweight”, and (5) “very
overweight”.
Results
Data Analysis
All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (version 24.0)
[54]. A series of chi-square tests (see Table 1) and
independent-samples t tests (see Table 2) were conducted to
determine if the weight-loss maintenance groups differed on
key variables of interest. Correlational analyses were per-
formed to determine if the relationships between the variables
of interest differed as a function of weight-loss maintenance
group (see Table 3). Finally, hierarchical logistic regression
models were conducted to determine which variables of inter-
est predicted classification into weight-loss maintenance
groups (see Table 4).
Differences Between Weight-Loss Maintenance Groups
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, weight-loss maintainers differed
from weight regainers on a number of demographic variables.
Weight regainers were disproportionately more likely to be
female, whereas weight-loss maintainers were relatively
equally split between males and females. Compared to weight
regainers, weight-loss maintainers were older, more educated,
and had higher incomes. Weight-loss maintainers had higher
year-ago BMIs, but lower current BMIs, compared to weight
regainers. Finally, weight-loss maintainers reported less per-
ceived stress and higher quality physical health, compared to
weight regainers.
With regard to weight-loss behaviors, as shown in Table 2,
weight-loss maintainers reported eating breakfast more fre-
quently and engaging in more physical activity during leisure
time than weight regainers, but no differences were observed
between the groups with regard to frequency of dietary mon-
itoring and self-weighing.
The weight-loss maintenance groups also differed with re-
gard to internalized and experienced weight stigma and sub-
jective weight category. Specifically, as shown in Table 2,
weight regainers reported significantly more internalized and
experienced weight stigma and higher subjective weight cat-
egory compared to weight-loss maintainers.
Correlations Within Weight-Loss Maintenance Groups
As shown in Table 3, partial correlations indicated similar
relationships between the variables of interest for weight-
loss maintainers and weight regainers, but with a few excep-
tions. Specifically, for both groups, more internalized weight
stigma was related to more perceived stress, worse perceived
physical health, less physical activity during leisure time,
higher subjective weight category, and more experienced stig-
ma. For weight-loss maintainers only, more frequency in eat-
ing breakfast was correlated with more dietary monitoring and

 physical activity during leisure time—these variables were not
correlated for weight regainers. However, higher subjective
weight category was related to worse perceived physical
health and more experienced stigma for weight regainers,
but not for weight-loss maintainers. Finally, for weight
regainers, both internalized and experienced stigma were re-
lated to more dietary monitoring and more self-weighing, but
these relationships did not emerge for weight-loss
maintainers.
Predicting Weight-Loss Maintenance
As shown in Table 4, hierarchical logistic regression was used
to determine key variables in predicting which participants
were able to maintain their weight loss over the past year.
The analysis included three separate blocks of variables: block
1 tested the predictive value of demographic characteristics
(i.e., age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income), perceived
stress, perceived physical health, and year-ago BMI; block 2
tested behaviors that have been linked to sustained weight
loss: eating breakfast, dietary monitoring, self-weighing, and
level of physical activity; block 3 tested internalized weight
stigma, subjective weight category, and experienced weight
stigma.
As a set, the demographic variables in block 1 significantly
predicted which participants were classified as a weight-loss
maintainer, X2 (8) = 85.10, p < .001. The Nagelkerke R-square
for Block 1 was .19, indicating that the combination of demo-
graphic variables, perceived stress, and perceived physical
health accounted for approximately 19% of the variance in
whether or not a participant was classified as a weight-loss
maintainer. Participants’ age, education, and perceived

 physical health made significant, individual contributions to
prediction. Specifically, odds ratios showed that for every ad-
ditional year in age, the odds of being a weight-loss maintainer
increased by about 3% (Wald = 18.70, p < .001). For every
one-unit increase in educational attainment, the odds of being
a weight-loss maintainer increased by approximately 26%
(Wald = 7.49, p = 0.006). For every one-unit increase in
perceived physical health, the odds of being a weight-loss
maintainer increased by 2% (Wald = 10.25, p = .001).
As a set, the additional variables in block 2—weight-loss
behaviors—did not significantly predict which participants
were weight-loss maintainers, X2 (4) = 4.13, p = .389. Based
on the Nagelkerke R-square, the combination of variables in
blocks 1 and 2 accounted for approximately 20% of the

 variance, which is roughly the same amount of variance
accounted for in block 1—indicating that the inclusion of the
weight-loss behaviors did not improve the predictive value of
the model. None of the four weight-loss behavior variables
individually predicted whether or not a participant was a
weight-loss maintainer.
As a set, the additional variables in block 3—internalized
weight stigma, subjective weight category, and experienced
weight stigma—significantly predicted which participants
were weight-loss maintainers, X2 (3) = 81.22, p < .001.
Based on the Nagelkerke R-square, the combination of vari-
ables in blocks 1, 2, and 3 accounted for approximately 36%
of the variance in whether or not a participant was classified as
a weight-loss maintainer—a considerable increase in variance
accounted for over blocks 1 and 2. Two variables in this block
made significant individual contributions to prediction.
Specifically, for every one-unit increase in internalized weight
stigma, the odds of being a weight-loss maintainer decreased
by 28% (Wald = 12.48, p < .001). For every one-unit increase
in subjective weight category, the odds of being a weight-loss
maintainer decreased by 76% (Wald = 41.65, p < .001).
Discussion
In light of the absence of research examining the role of
weight stigma in sustaining weight loss, our study provides
initial evidence that this variable warrants research attention as
a novel factor that may hinder weight-loss maintenance.
Internalized weight stigma significantly predicted poorer
weight-loss maintenance even after accounting for demo-
graphic characteristics, perceived stress, physical health and
weight loss behaviors, which have been previously identified
as important factors affecting weight loss maintenance. Our
findings showed that for every one-unit increase in weight-
stigma internalization, the odds of being a weight-loss main-
tainer decreased by 28%. Unexpectedly, with internalized
weight stigma and subjective weight category controlled for,
experienced stigma was not a significant predictor of weight
maintenance. This finding is similar to a study by Latner and
colleagues [40] who found that experienced stigma did not
impede weight-loss maintenance, but contrasts with a recent
study of adults in the German Weight Control Registry, for
whom a history of experienced weight teasing in childhood
predicted poorer weight-loss maintenance [39]. Other evi-
dence has linked both experienced and internalized weight
stigma to psychological distress and maladaptive and emo-
tional eating behaviors, giving reason to hypothesize that both
forms of stigma could interfere with weight loss maintenance.
Our study findings suggest that regardless of encountering
overt incidents of weight-based teasing, unfair treatment, or
discrimination, it may be that internalized negative weight-
based attitudes and self-blame are particularly detrimental
for personal efforts to sustain weight loss. More research is

 warranted to clarify and compare how experienced versus
internalized weight stigma may differentially influence these
outcomes. In particular, it would be informative to examine
whether internalized weight stigma mediates the relationship
between experienced weight stigma and weight loss mainte-
nance outcomes or other health behaviors that increase vul-
nerability to weight regain.
Although little is known about the role of internalized
weight stigma in the context of weight-loss maintenance, re-
cent evidence indicates that it may be a stronger predictor of
poor emotional health and reduced exercise behaviors than
experienced weight stigma alone [55, 56]. Our findings align
with this evidence, as internalized weight stigma was associ-
ated with higher perceived stress, higher subjective weight
category, less physical activity during leisure time, and lower
perceived physical health. It will be important for future work
to identify which weight-loss maintenance behaviors are most
strongly associated with internalized stigma, and whether
these relationships are similar or different across population
characteristics such as sex, race/ethnicity, age, and body-
weight status.
Importantly, subjective weight category also made a signif-
icant individual contribution to the prediction of weight-loss
maintenance in our study, even after accounting for multiple
factors linked to sustained weight loss, further underscoring
the notion that internalized views of oneself may have height-
ened salience in weight-loss maintenance. Our findings are
consistent with a recent national study of adults showing that
perceiving oneself to be “overweight” increased the risk of
weight gain irrespective of accuracy of self-perceptions and
baseline weight [38]. Our study similarly suggests that regard-
less of actual BMI, subjective identification with a particular
weight category could be informative in understanding
weight-loss maintenance. While self-perceptions about weight
have received insufficient attention in the weight-loss mainte-
nance literature, our findings highlight a need to empirically
assess if, and how, higher subjective weight (whether accurate
or not) is predictive of weight regain, and whether it is related
to weight stigma. For example, experimental research has
demonstrated that exposure to weight stigma leads women
to consume more calories and feel less capable of controlling
their eating if they perceive themselves to be overweight;
these effects of weight stigma did not extend to women who
did not view themselves to be overweight [25]. Thus, it will be
important to identify what predicts self-perceptions of weight
status, and mechanisms underlying the relationship between
subjective weight category and weight-loss maintenance, such
as emotional overeating and reactions to weight stigma. As
internalized weight stigma was positively associated with sub-
jective weight category in our study, continued research is
warranted to clarify the relationship between these two vari-
ables and how they may interact to interfere with weight-loss
maintenance.
While our study reflects an investigation of novel psycho-
social factors primarily neglected in the field of weight-loss
maintenance, several limitations should be noted. First, the
self-reported nature of weight history, physical activity, and
body weight could have introduced measurement error due to
misreporting on these variables. However, evidence suggests
that discrepancies between self-reported versus actual weight
change over time are small [57, 58], and research has demon-
strated good concordance rates between online self-reported
weight and measured weight [59], increasing confidence in
the online self-reported measurement approach in this study.
Second, the Internet panel used in this study is not nationally
representative; nevertheless, it reflects a national, diverse sam-
ple with characteristics such as race, sex, and body weight
distributions that approximate national estimates [60, 61]. In
light of potential adverse health consequences of weight cy-
cling for individuals across different weight statuses, it will be
important for continued research to examine the relationship
between weight stigma and weight maintenance in weight-
diverse samples. Third, this study relied on cross-sectional
data, and only with longitudinal investigations can the direc-
tionality and nature of the relationship between internalized
weight stigma, self-perceived weight, and weight-loss main-
tenance be clarified. As our primary aim was to examine ex-
perienced and internalized weight stigma as contributors to
weight-loss maintenance, it will be important for future stud-
ies to thoroughly examine potential mechanisms. Finally, for
this field of study to advance, several inconsistencies in
existing literature should be reconciled. To date, variability
in study designs (e.g., retrospective versus prospective re-
search) and differences in how primary constructs are mea-
sured (e.g., weight loss maintenance, weight stigma) make it
difficult to establish conclusions across studies. Concerted
efforts to improve methodological consistency with clearly
defined and comparable constructs will be better able to in-
form clear directions for future research.
Conclusions
The difficulties of maintaining weight loss reflect a significant
challenge. Most behavioral and psychological weight loss in-
terventions yield, at best, only small improvements in weight
outcomes [11], and our current society continues to reinforce
obesity as a socially acceptable stigma [62, 63]. Our findings
underscore the need to obtain a clearer understanding of the
roles that weight stigma (both internalized and experienced)
and subjective weight category play in sustaining weight loss,
which could inform new interventions to be developed and
tested during the maintenance phase of weight loss, where
success rates are poor. It may be that addressing weight stigma
as part of clinical interventions for obesity could improve
health outcomes or help prevent weight regain, by helping

 people adopt adaptive strategies to cope with the impact of the
stigmatizing environment and emotional distress resulting
from internalized bias [64]. This echoes calls for clinical in-
terventions to move beyond the focus on “weight” to address
the psychological meaning that people attribute to their own
body weight [65]. Thus, increased research attention to self-
perceived weight and weight stigma as relevant psychosocial
factors in this field of study will advance understanding of the
complex interaction of factors that facilitate, or impede,
weight-loss maintenance and can help identify novel opportu-
nities for intervention.
