BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Spain implemented a partial smoking ban in 2006 followed by a 
comprehensive ban in 2011. The objective was to examine the association between these 
smoke-free policies and different perinatal complications.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including all live births between 2000 and 2013. Selected 
adverse birth outcomes were: preterm births (<37 gestational weeks), small for gestational 
age (SGA; <10th weight percentile according to Spanish reference tables), and low birth 
weight (<2500 g). We estimated immediate and gradual rate changes after smoking bans by 
using overdispersed Poisson models with different linear trends for 2000 to 2005 (preban), 
2006 to 2010 (partial ban), and 2011 to 2013 (comprehensive ban). Models were adjusted 
for maternal sociodemographics, health care during the delivery, and smoking prevalence 
during pregnancy.
RESULTS: The comprehensive ban was associated with preterm birth rate reductions of 4.5% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9%–6.1%) and 4.1% (95% CI: 2.5%–5.6%) immediately 
and 1 year after implementation, respectively. The low birth weight rate also dropped 
immediately (2.3%; 95% CI: 0.7%–3.8%) and 1 year after the comprehensive ban 
implementation (3.5%; 95% CI: 2.1%–5.0%). There was an immediate reduction in the SGA 
rate at the onset of the partial ban (4.9%; 95% CI: 3.5%–6.2%), which was sustained 1 year 
postimplementation. Although not associated with the comprehensive ban at the onset, the 
SGA rate declined by 1.7% (95% CI: 0.3%–3.1%) 1 year postimplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the Spanish smoke-free policies was associated with 
a risk reduction for preterm births and low birth weight infants, especially with the 
introduction of the more restrictive ban.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Secondhand 
smoke exposure during pregnancy is associated 
with health complications affecting perinatal and

Worldwide, secondhand smoke 
(SHS) is responsible for close to 
600 000 annual deaths. The young 
are particularly affected because 
the greatest SHS prevalence and 
SHS-related disease burden are 
found in children <5 years of age.1 
Solid evidence supports the fact that 
SHS exposure during pregnancy is 
associated with a diverse array of 
complications during gestation as 
well as in the perinatal and neonatal 
periods. Specifically, there is a high 
risk for preterm, low birth weight, 
small for gestational age (SGA) 
infants, as well as for sudden infant 
death syndrome.2, 
 
3
In Spain, the prevalence of fetal SHS 
exposure is high. It is estimated that 
between 2004 and 2008, 1 in every 
2 nonsmoking women was exposed 
to SHS during the third trimester of 
her pregnancy, 
4 and 1 in 5 pregnant 
women smoked during pregnancy in 
2013.5
Smoking bans designed to protect 
nonsmokers from involuntary 
SHS exposure is one of the main 
initiatives for tobacco control. Many 
countries, in compliance with the 
2003 World Health Organization 
Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control, 
6 have implemented laws 
regulating tobacco consumption 
in public places. The Spanish 
law on health measures against 
smoking took effect on January 1, 
2006, 
7 and banned smoking in the 
workplace except in the hospitality 
sector, where a partial ban was 
implemented. The law substantially 
reduced SHS exposure in the 
workplace, but had little impact on 
reducing this environmental risk 
in hospitality establishments.8, 
 
9 To 
additionally reduce SHS exposure, 
a reform of the original law10 took 
effect on January 2, 2011. This reform 
banned tobacco consumption in 
almost the totality of public places, a 
measure that was vastly successful 
in reducing SHS exposure in bars 
and restaurants (>90% reduction in 
vapor-phase nicotine and particulate 
matter ≤2.5 µm in diameter in 
hospitality venues).11
Several studies have evaluated the 
impact of smoke-free policies on 
perinatal complications, such as 
low birth weight and prematurity.12 
Published studies to date have failed 
to provide uniform evidence on the 
impact of smoke-free policies on low 
birth weight and prematurity, 
12 with 
some articles reporting favorable 
results, 
13 
– 
16 others reporting no 
change,

different conclusions depending on 
the health indicator examined.20

Spain is one of a few countries with 
2-stage smoking ban legislation, 
high compliance, and a 5-year 
gap between a less restrictive to a 
complete ban. The main objective of 
this study was to examine whether 
the 2 Spanish smoking bans put in 
place to reduce SHS exposure were 
associated with reductions in the 
rates of preterm, low birth weight, 
and SGA births.
MeThODs
study Design and Participants
In this population-based study, we 
analyzed cross-sectional data from 
the Spanish Birth Registry (Spanish 
National Statistics Institute) from 
January 2000 to December 2013. 
Data from 5 293 700 records included 
clinical information on all live 
births occurring between week 22 
and week 44 of gestation in Spain. 
SGA analyses included only infants 
born in the period between 26 and 
42 weeks of pregnancy because 
weight reference tables to define 
this indicator are based on that 
gestational time.
Variables
Outcome variables included preterm 
birth (<37 weeks’ gestational age), 
low birth weight (<2500 g), and 
SGA births (<10th weight percentile 
according to Carrascosa et al25). 
Based on the existing literature, 
we included those relevant 
covariates available in the database. 
These included the mother’s age 
grouped in 5-year intervals and 
socioeconomic status based on the 
mother’s and father’s occupation, 
separately. Occupational status 
was categorized as follows: groups 
I and II (managerial positions, 
technical staff, and professionals), 
group III (administrative staff), 
and groups IV and V (manual 
workers). We also adjusted for: 
birth location (health center, private 
home, or another location), health 
professional–assisted birth or not, 
singleton or multiple birth, and the 
region where the mother resided. 
Preliminary analyses showed that 
these variables were significantly 
related to the outcomes under study 
(statistically significant P value), 
and they could vary between the 
time periods: preban (2000–2005), 
partial ban (2006–2010), and 
full ban (2011–2013). Finally, we 
included the annual prevalence 
of tobacco consumption during 
pregnancy using information from 
controls participating in the Spanish 
Collaborative Study on Congenital 
Malformations by the Research 
Center for Birth Defects.5, 
 
26
statistical analyses
Poisson models allowing for 
overdispersion were used to assess 
rate changes in the 3 adverse birth 
outcomes over time. The segmented 
models allowed for different 
log-linear rate trends during the 
2000–2005 preban period, the 
2006–2010 partial ban period, and 
the 2011–2013 comprehensive ban 
period, while adjusting for maternal 
sociodemographics, health care 
during the delivery, and smoking 
prevalence during pregnancy. 
From these models, we estimated 
the percent changes in perinatal 
complication rates at the partial 
ban’s implementation and 1 year 
after by comparing the estimated 
rates at these time points with the 
2

Downloaded from 
 PEDIATRICS Volume 139, number 6, June 2017
projected rates from the preban 
period.27 Similarly, the percent 
rate changes at the comprehensive 
ban’s implementation and 1 year 
after were calculated by relating 
the estimated rates at these time 
points to the projected rates from the 
previous partial ban period.
Sensitivity analyses were performed. 
To determine the robustness of the 
models, we reran the models varying 
the specifications and compared 
the association estimates. First, we 
excluded multiple births. Second, we 
evaluated the association estimates 
by building 3-, 6-, and 9-month 
lags between birth and the bans’ 
implementation into the model.
Additional analyses were performed 
to estimate the differences in 
coefficients by the sex of the 
newborn, whether the mother 
worked outside the home, and the 
parent’s socioeconomic position 
based on occupation, evaluating 
the statistical significance of the 
interaction. We performed analyses 
with Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX) and R version 
R3.3.1 (R Foundation).
ResulTs
 
Table 1 shows participants’ 
sociodemographic characteristics 
and health care services. The average 
age of the mothers was 31 years, 
and although occupations varied, the 
most common reported occupation 
was “other, 
” which captured those 
who have not held a paying job 
before. The most common occupation 
of fathers was manual labor. The vast 
majority of births were singleton, 
took place in health care centers, and 
were assisted by health professionals.
In the 2000–2013 time period, the 
preterm birth rate was 7.9%, 9.2% 
of births were SGA births, and 7.8% 
of newborns had low birth weight 
(Table 1). Figure 1 presents how 
the 3 outcomes under study evolved 
throughout time, displaying the 
annual gross rates and the segmented 
linear trends for 2000 to 2005 
(preban), 2006 to 2010 (partial ban), 
and 2011 to 2013 (comprehensive 
ban). The corresponding changes 
in rate ratios (crude rates) are 
summarized in Table 2. SGA birth 
is the variable with the greatest 
stability over time, with a slight 
decreasing trend. In contrast, the rate 
for low birth weight increased during 
the preban period only to remain 
constant for the last 4 years of the 
study. The trend for preterm births 
also increased until peaking in 2007 
to 2009 and decreased moderately 
thereafter.
 
Table 2 shows the changes in 
perinatal complications over the 3 
periods under study: preban, partial 
ban, and comprehensive ban. The 
comprehensive ban was associated 
with an immediate reduction 
(percent change of adjusted 
rates) in the preterm birth rate of

−4.5% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: −6.1% to −2.9%), and this 
reduction was sustained 1 year after 
implementation (−4.1%; 95% CI: 
−5.6% to −2.5%). Similarly, there 
was an immediate reduction in the 
rate of low birth weight infants 
(−2.3%; 95% CI: −3.8% to −0.7%) 
with the implementation of the 
comprehensive ban, and the rate 
decreased slightly more 1 year after 
implementation (−3.5%; 95% CI: 
−5.0% to −2.1%).
Finally, the implementation of the 
partial ban was associated with an 
immediate reduction in the SGA 
birth rate (−4.9%, 95% CI: −6.2% to 
−3.5%). The rate continued dropping 
throughout the first year, but at a 
more modest pace (−4.2%, 95% 
CI: −5.7% to −2.7%). Although we 
did not observe changes in the SGA 
birth rate at the onset of the 2011 
comprehensive ban, the rate fell by 
−1.7% (95% CI: −3.1% to −0.3%)  
1 year later.
The results from the sensitivity 
analyses were similar to those from 
the general models after excluding 
multiple births from the analysis. 
Estimate changes were not observed 
either when models included the 
3-, 6-, and 9-month lags between 
delivery and implementation of the 
ban.
The associations described above 
were not modified by the newborn’s 
sex, having a mother working 
outside the home or not, or parental 
socioeconomic position based on 
occupation. The tested interactions 
failed to reach statistical significance.
DIscussIOn
The onset of the partial ban was 
associated with a reduction in the 
SGA rate, and the reduction was 
maintained throughout the first 
year after the ban was put in place. 
The expansion of this law into a 
comprehensive ban was associated 
with an immediate reduction in the

preterm and low birth weight rates, 
both of which sustained the reduction 
1 year after implementation.
Despite the existing evidence on 
the harmful effects of tobacco 
consumption during pregnancy, as 
well as of the role of SHS exposure 
in pregnancy complications and 
perinatal health, 
2, 
 
28 
– 
30 research on 
the impact of local and national 
smoking bans is scarce, and findings 
are inconsistent depending on the 
type of ban and the health indicators 
examined.31 Half of the studies on 
smoking bans and prematurity report 
a reduction in births earlier than 37 
gestational weeks once the ban is 
implemented, 
15, 
 
16, 
 
22 
–24 and the other 
half fail to detect an association.17 
–21
Four studies detected a protective 
association between smoking bans 
and low birth weight, 
13, 
 
15, 
 
16, 
 
21 
however, 7 articles failed to find any 
benefits.17 
– 
20, 
 
22– 
24 Finally, of the 5 
studies that evaluated the effect of 
bans on SGA rates, most reported a 
protective effect14 
– 
16 versus those 
that failed to provide evidence.19, 
 
22  
Overall, findings are highly 
inconsistent; however, studies based 
on proximate countries, with similar 
smoking regulations to Spain and 
high levels of compliance, as is the 
case in Ireland, 
14, 
 
23 Scotland, 
15 and 
England, 
13 have also observed falling 
rates in perinatal complications.
The mechanisms through which 
smoke-free legislation works to 
improve perinatal health include 
maternal tobacco consumption, 
changes in SHS exposure, or both 
if the mother smokes. Only a few 
studies that evaluated the impact of 
smoking bans have differentiated 
between these mechanisms. In 
Norway, Bharadwaj et al21 reported 
that most of the benefit stemmed 
from changes in maternal tobacco 
consumption, and only a reduced 
portion of the benefit came from 
changes in SHS exposure. However, 
MacKay et al, 
15 in Scotland, reported 
improvements in prematurity and 
SGA indicators in mothers whether 
they smoked or not.
The fact that the associations 
between the 2 smoking bans and 
birth outcomes differed is worth 
elaborating on. Based on a meta-
analysis on the effects of smoke-
free regulations on cardiovascular 
and respiratory diseases, Tan and 
Glantz32 reported a dose-response 
relationship where benefits increased 
as regulations grew more restrictive. 
Few countries have introduced 
smoke-free legislation in stages 
from a less restrictive to a broader 
legislation, from only affecting the 
workplace to designating bars, 
restaurants, and other public places 
as a “smoke-free space.” Amaral20 in 
California and Cox et al22 in Flanders, 
Belgium, reported conflicting results. 
The former study links a decrease in 
newborns’ average birth weight with 
the less restrictive ban, whereas the 
latter study associates a reduction in 
preterm birth rates with the gradual 
increase in public spaces that are 
designated “smoke-free”.
In our study, we observed a stronger 
beneficial association between the 
comprehensive smoking ban and 
preterm and low birth weight birth 
rates, but not SGA rates; however, 
we found a beneficial association 
between the preceding partial ban 
and SGA rates. Future studies should 
explore these findings further.
It is also noteworthy that the 
association between smoking bans 
and perinatal outcomes did not 
vary by maternal socioeconomic 
position given that these types of 
complications are more prevalent 
in mothers from low socioeconomic 
groups.33, 
 
34 Similarly, SHS exposure 
in adults tends to be higher among 
the lowest educational level or 
socioeconomic groups.35 These 
findings imply a broadening of 
existing socioeconomic disparities 
regarding a wide variety of health

outcomes. Nonetheless, our results 
are consistent with those reported by 
McKinnon et al16 in Quebec, Canada, 
where they found no evidence of 
effect modification by maternal 
educational level either.
Our results should be interpreted in 
the context of the study’s limitations. 
First, given the cross-sectional design 
of the study, no causal inference can 
be drawn. Second, although the birth 
registry includes sociodemographic 
information about the mother, it 
does not collect tobacco consumption 
habits during pregnancy. However, 
we used data from the Spanish 
Collaborative Study on Congenital 
Malformations by the Research 
Center for Birth Defects on smoking 
prevalence among pregnant women 
as an ecological control. Third, we 
could not differentiate between 
spontaneous and provider-initiated 
preterm deliveries due to data 
limitations. The latter is important 
because tobacco addiction is a risk 
factor for spontaneous preterm 
births. MacKay et al15 examined 
spontaneous preterm births only and 
detected a statistically significant 
association between Scottish 
smoking bans and preterm births 
that was only slightly lessened after 
adjusting for preeclampsia. Fourth, 
variables not taken into account may 
contribute to residual confounding, 
such as cesarean delivery rates 
(25% in Spain), which are related 
to gestational time and newborn’s 
weight. However, cesarean delivery 
rates do not seem to be related to the 
smoking bans because the incidence 
of cesarean delivery grew gradually, 
peaking in 2006, only to stabilize 
thereafter. Also, the use of tocolytic 
drugs for suppression of premature 
labor could modify the association 
under study. But, again, there seems 
to be no temporal relationship 
between the bans and the use of this 
family of drugs or, more specifically, 
oxytocine receptor antagonists (eg, 
Atosiban), which may reduce birth 
weight.36
Finally, other changes in fetal 
medicine practice over the study 
period could have confounded 
the association (eg, recognition 
and earlier treatment of high 
blood pressure leading to better 
placental function, or aspirin 
administration in early pregnancy 
to prevent preeclampsia). However, 
in this period, the Clinical Practice 
Guideline for Care in Pregnancy and 
Puerperium in the Spanish National 
Health System37 did not change 
their recommendations on blood 
pressure monitoring (to prevent 
hypertension from complicating 
pregnancies) or the use of low-
dose aspirin in early pregnancy. 
However, between 2000 and 2013, 
Spanish hospitals have experienced 
steady negative linear trends in 
admission rates for hypertension 
complications during pregnancy 
(International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification code 642) and for 
preeclampsia (International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification codes 
642.4 and 642.5). Coincidentally, 
the trends for hypertension 
complications during pregnancy 
stabilized starting in 2010 and 
for preeclampsia starting in 2008, 
time periods that include the 
post–comprehensive ban years 
under study (2011 to 2013) and 
during which we observed the more 
substantial effects of the smoke-
free policies on our outcomes of 
interest. This information suggests 
the independence of our findings 
from the improved management 
of those clinical conditions. 
Likewise, the Clinical Practice 
Guideline for Care in Pregnancy 
and Puerperium did not change 
the recommendations on the 
management of growth restriction, 
with the addition of Doppler 
assessment.37
Although we are not aware of any 
changes in obstetric practices 
coinciding with the implementation 
of the 2 smoking bans, we cannot 
rule out the risk of unknown bias 
due to other factors not controlled 
in the analysis potentially related to 
outcomes.
Our study also has important 
strengths. First, this large 
population-based study analyzed 
data from a comprehensive and 
highly relevant nationwide data 
set. Second, Spain is one of a few 
countries with 2-stage smoking ban 
legislation and a 5-year gap between 
a partial and a comprehensive ban. 
Third, this smoke-free regulation 
was effective in reducing exposure 
to SHS in the workplace and in 
hospitality venues.8, 
 
9, 
 
11 Fourth, 
the substantial follow-up period, 
starting 6 years before the 
implementation of the first policy 
and terminating 2 years after the 
implementation of the second one, 
allowed for the separate evaluation 
of the 2 phases of the smoke-free 
legislation.
cOnclusIOns
Our results show a risk reduction 
for preterm births and low birth 
weight newborns coinciding with the 
implementation of the smoke-free 
regulations in Spain. This finding 
is especially true with the second 
regulation, a comprehensive ban 
prohibiting smoking in most enclosed 
public spaces. This association 
strongly provides support for the 
benefits of implementing smoke-
free legislation in the prevention of 
pregnancy complications and brings 
to the forefront the importance 
of developing comprehensive 
regulations preventing or minimizing 
maternal and fetal exposure to this 
key environmental risk factor.
