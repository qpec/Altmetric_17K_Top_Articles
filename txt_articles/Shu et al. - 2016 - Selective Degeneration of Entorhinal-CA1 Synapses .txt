Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia
in the elderly, affecting �10 million people in China and �35
million people worldwide. The deposition of senile plaques that
primarily consist of amyloid-� (A�) peptide is a major patholog-
ical hallmark in the brains of AD patients and has long been
considered to be associated with a progressive loss of central neu-
rons in certain regions of the brain (Tanzi et al., 1987; Goate et al.,
1991; Jack et al., 2010; Duffy et al., 2015). However, recent studies
have shown that impairments in learning and memory, the early
clinical signs of AD, are caused by synaptic dysfunction rather
than neuronal cell loss. For example, in AD patients, cognitive
decline is closely associated with a reduction in the number of
presynaptic glutamatergic terminals (Gomez-Isla et al., 1996; Ka-
menetz et al., 2003; Oddo et al., 2003). Tg2576-APPswe mice (AD
mice), which carry a transgene encoding the 695 amino acid iso-
form of the human A� precursor protein with the Swedish mu-
tation and exhibit plaque pathologies similar to those in AD
patients, show decays in synaptic transmission and impairments
in spatial learning and memory in an age-dependent manner
(Chapman et al., 1999; Jacobsen et al., 2006; Scheff et al., 2007).

Significance Statement
Our recent study reported that excitatory pyramidal neurons in the entorhinal cortical layer II region (ECIIPN) target to CA1
parvalbumin-type inhibitory neurons (CA1PV) at a direct pathway and are one of the most vulnerable brain cells that are selectively
degenerated in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our present study shows that death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is
selectively activated in ECIIPN of AD mice. Inhibition of DAPK1 by deleting a catalytic domain or a death domain of DAPK1 rescues the
ECIIPN-CA1PV synaptic loss and improves spatial learning and memory in the early stage of AD. These data not only demonstrate
a crucial molecular event for synaptic degeneration but also provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

 However, which of the many synapses in the brain undergo se-
lective degeneration during the early stages of AD and whether
this selective degeneration contributes directly to the loss of spa-
tial learning and memory are still unknown.
Excitatory pyramidal neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC,
ECPN), which primarily target to the hippocampus, are the most
vulnerable brain cells in the early stages of AD (Hsia et al., 1999;
Yassa, 2014; Yang et al., 2016). The ECPN are largely distributed in
the EC layer II (ECIIPN) and III (ECIIIPN) regions. These neurons
innervate excitatory pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin (PV)
inhibitory GABA-containing neurons in the CA1 hippocampus
(CA1PV) and are associated with spatial and temporal associative
memories (Kitamura et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016). Our recent
study showed that amyloid deposition occurs in the brain of AD
mice at 8 months of age, whereas synaptic transmission between
ECIIPN and CA1PV undergoes degeneration at 6 months of age
(Yang et al., 2016). This finding indicates that synaptic degener-
ation is not associated with the presence of amyloid plagues. Yet,
the molecular mechanisms underlying degeneration of ECIIPN
synapses remain unknown. Our present studies demonstrate that
death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) became activated se-
lectively in the ECIIPN of AD mice. We show that activation of
DAPK1 is responsible for a selective degeneration of ECIIPN-
CA1PV synapses and that inhibition of DAPK1 is therapeutically
effective for the intervention of spatial learning and memory de-
clines in AD.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All mice used in this study were bred and reared under the same
conditions in the University’s core animal facility in accordance with insti-
tutional guidelines and the Animal Care and Use Committee (Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China). The mice were
housedingroupsof3–5percageandmaintainedwitha12hlight-darkcycle,
with lights on at 8:00 A.M., at consistent ambient temperature (22 � 1°C)
and humidity (50 � 5%). Tg2576-APPswe mice (the AD mice), which ex-
pressed a mutant form of A� precursor protein (APP) (isoform 695) with
the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL), were purchased from the The Jack-
son Laboratory. In the present study, all the AD mice were identified as
homozygous. Male mice were used in this study.
Generation of the mutant mice. To generate the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice,
we expressed ChR2-eGFP in the ECIIPN of mutant mice that had a loxP-
flanked STOP sequence followed by ChR2 (E123A)-eGFP. The Rosa-
CAG-Flag-ChR2eGFP-WPRE targeting vector was designed with a
CMV-IE enhancer/chicken �-actin/rabbit �-globin hybrid promoter
(CAG), an FRT site, a loxP-flanked STOP cassette, a Flag-eGFP sequence,
a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element
(WPRE; to enhance the mRNA transcript stability), a poly-A signal, and
an attB/att-flanked PGK-FRT-Neo-poly-A cassette. This entire construct
was inserted into the Gt(ROSA)26Sor locus via electroporation into
C57BL/6-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. The targeted ES cells were
selected and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and chimeric animals
were then bred to C57BL/6 mice (ChR2loxP /loxP).
Next, we created the rAAV1/2-D28K-Cre virus particles. We designed
the rAVE-D28K-Cre vector by inserting a Cre recombinase sequence
immediately downstream of the calbindin 1 (or calbindin-D28K, D28K)
translational STOP codon via Apal/Kpnl. The rAVE plasmids were
cotransfected with AAV helper1/2 mixers into HEK293 cells to generate
rAAV1/2-D28K-Cre virus particles with a high titer (�5 � 10 12 genomic
particles/ml), as described previously (Tu et al., 2010; Pei et al., 2015;
Yang et al., 2016). The virus particles (1.5 �l) were bilaterally injected into
the EC superficial layer (anteroposterior 4.8 mm, mediolateral 2.8 mm, dor-
soventral 3.5–4.0 mm) in the AD/ChR2loxP/loxP and control/ChR2loxP/loxP
mice, thus leading to ChR2-eGFP expression in the ECIIPN of the AD or
control mice (AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� and control/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice).
To generate the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice, we first created a mutant strain of
mice with selective deletion of the catalytic domain (CD) of DAPK1
(DAPK1CDloxP/loxP mice) by targeting the exon 2 region, as described previ-
ously (Pei et al., 2015). The DAPK1CDloxP/loxP mice were crossed with the
AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice, thus resulting in AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice, in which the
DAPK1 CD was selectively deleted in the ChR2�-ECIIPN. To generate
the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice, we created a mutant strain of mice with a selective
deletion of the death domain (DD) of DAPK1 (DAPK1DDloxP/loxP mice). In
brief, an FRT-flanked Neo resistance positive selection cassette was inserted
downstream of exon 27; one loxP site was introduced upstream of exon 26
and another loxP site was introduced downstream of the Neo cassette. After
linearization, the targeting vector was transfected into C57BL/6J embryonic
stemcellsviaelectroporation.SixpositivecloneswereidentifiedbySouthern
blotting with a 5� probe, a 3� probe, and a Neo probe. Two positive clones
were injected into BALB/c blastocysts and implanted into pseudopregnant
females. Chimeric mice were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to obtain F1 mice
carrying the recombined allele containing the floxed DAPK1 allele and the
Neo selection cassette. These mice were mated with Flp recombinase-
expressing C57BL/6J Flp mice to remove the Neo resistance cassette and to
generate a line of Neo-excised DAPK1DDloxP/loxP mice. When these mice
were bred with the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice, the offspring were AD/
ECIIPN
DD� mice, in which the DAPK1 DD was selectively deleted in the
ChR2�-ECIIPN.
Single-cell Western blots, kinase assays, and coimmunoprecipitation.
EC tissues were isolated from the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice, the AD/
ECIIPN
CD� mice, the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice and their respective controls
and sliced and digested in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 50
mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM edetic acid, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM
PMSF, 1 mg/10 ml papain, and a mixture of aprotinin, leupeptin,
and pepstatin A (10 �g/ml each) for 30 min. The cell suspension of
ECIIPN
eGFP� was automatically isolated using an S3e Cell Sorter (Bio-
Rad). The isolated ECIIPN were homogenized and diluted with a buffer
containing 200 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 8% SDS, and 40% glycerol. The
protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Final
concentrations of 10% �-mercaptoethanol and 0.05% bromophenol
blue were added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min in a water bath.
The proteins in the extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were scanned by using an
Infrared Imaging System (Odyssey, LI-COR). The blots were incubated
with antibodies against DAPK1 (1:500, Epitomics, catalog #3798-1). The
band densities were quantitatively analyzed by using Kodak Digital Sci-
ence 1D software (Eastman Kodak).
Immunocomplex kinase assay was used to determine the catalytic ac-
tivity of DAPK1 in the lysates and myosin light chain (MLC) that was
phosphorylated at Ser-18/Thr-20 (pMLC) by activated DAPK1 was blot-
ted with anti-pMLC (1:1000, Millipore). The enzymatic activity of
DAPK1 was expressed as the ratio of pMLC to DAPK1 protein under the
same conditions. Immunoprecipitation was used to determine the asso-
ciation of DAPK1 with its substrates. The lysates (�200 �g protein) were
incubated with nonspecific IgG (2 �g) or polyclonal rabbit anti-DAPK1
antibody (2 �g, Millipore) overnight at 4°C, and this was followed by the
addition of 40 �l of Protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and incubation for 3 h
at 4°C. The precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, dena-
tured with SDS sample buffer, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-
Rad mini-protein-III wet transfer unit overnight at 4°C. The transferred
membranes were then incubated with blocking solution [5% nonfat
dried milk dissolved in TBST buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, washed three
times, and incubated with anti-goat primary antibody against Tau (1:
1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-rabbit antibody against Erk (1:
1000; Millipore), or anti-DAPK1 (1:1000, Sigma) for 1 h at room
temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBST buf-
fer, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilu-
tion) for 1 h, and washed four times. Signal detection was performed
with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare). The lanes
marked “input” were loaded with 10% of the starting material used
for immunoprecipitation.
Electrophysiology. Brain slices (300 �m) were prepared as previously
described (Tu et al., 2010; Pei et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016). The slices
were transferred to a holding chamber containing ACSF consisting of 124

 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM MgCl2�6H2O, 1.25 mM
NaH2PO4�2H2O, 10 mM C6H12O6, and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4 and 305
mOsm. The slices were allowed to recover at 31.5°C for 30 min and then
at room temperature for 1 h. Acute slices were transferred to a recording
chamber continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF (2 ml/min) and
maintained at room temperature. For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
from the CA1PV, brain slices from the AD mice, in which mCherry was
expressed in the CA1PV cells, were visualized via fluorescence IR-DIC
using an Axioskop 2FS equipped with Hamamatsu C2400–07E optics.
When stable whole-cell recordings were achieved with good access resis-
tance (�20 M�), basic electrophysiological properties were recorded. All
the data were acquired at 10 kHz and filtered with a 2 kHz low-pass filter.
The evoked EPSCs were recorded in the slices by delivering blue laser
light (5 ms, 405-nm-wavelength laser at power densities ranging from 0.1
to 5 mW/mm 2) directly onto the ECIIPN, which had normal intrinsic
properties in AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� (resting membrane potentiation �
69.3 � 2.1 mV; input resistance � 386 � 21 M�, mean � SEM, n � 36
cells/6 mice), AD/ECIIPN
CD� (resting membrane potentiation � 68.7 �
2.0 mV; input resistance � 389 � 19 M�, mean � SEM, n � 33 cells/5
mice), and AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice (resting membrane potentiation �
69.9 � 1.9 mV; input resistance � 401 � 17 M�, mean � SEM, n � 39
cells/5 mice) when they were at 180 � 5 d of age, compared with the
age-matched controls (resting membrane potentiation � 70.1 � 1.7 mV;
input resistance � 403 � 13 M�, mean � SEM, n � 32 cells/5 mice).
Extracellular single-unit recording. Extracellular single-unit and local
field power spectrum recordings were made from the CA1 neurons (an-
teroposterior �1.7 mm, mediolateral 1.0 mm, and dorsoventral 0.5–0.8
mm target to CA1). Mice were connected to the recording equipment via
AC-coupled unity-gain operational amplifiers (Plexon). Signals were
amplified 4000- to 8000-fold. The spikes and local field potentials were
recorded simultaneously and isolated by using a 250 Hz low-pass filter
and a 250 Hz high-pass filter and the commercial software OmniPlex
(Plexon). Spike sorting was performed off-line using graphical cluster-
sorting software (Offline Sorter, Plexon). To estimate the quality of the
cluster separation, we calculated the isolation distance and the L-ratio
using Plexon SDK. Only the units with an L-ratio �0.05 and a distance
�15 were included.
To isolate and analyze spike units from individual CA1PN versus the
CA1PV, we calculated the valley-to-peak time and the half-width of the
spikes. Spikes from CA1PN were identified and distinguished from those
of CA1IN according to the duration of the negative spike, the firing pat-
tern (complex spikes), and the low average firing rate. Spikes from CA1PV
were validated as described previously (Yang et al., 2016). The average
firing rate was expressed as the total number of spikes divided by the total
length of the recording period.
Morris Water Maze. A pool 1.5 m in diameter was filled with water that
was made opaque with white nontoxic ink and maintained at 25.0°C.
Animals were brought to the behavior room (where they were housed for
the duration of the training), handled for 1–2 d, and trained, as described
previously (Tu et al., 2010; Pei et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016). The entire
protocol lasted 7 d. The first training day consisted of a probe trial fol-
lowed by a “visible platform” trial, in which the platform was indicated by
a red flag. Next, mice were subjected to their first “hidden platform”
learning trial, during which they were allowed to rest on the platform for
30 s before being released from one of the pool’s starting points (north,
south, east, or west). The animals were allowed 60 s to find the platform
and were allowed to stay there for 30 s; if an animal did not find the
platform within 60 s, it was removed from the water and placed on the
platform for 30 s. During days 1–6, four trials were performed corre-
sponding to the four different randomized release points. Therefore, the
total training took 6 d followed by a final 24 h probe on the seventh day.
Open-field tests and rotarod tests. Locomotor activity was assessed in
clear boxes measuring 100 cm � 100 cm that were outfitted with photo-
beam detectors for monitoring horizontal and vertical activity, as de-
scribed previously (Tu et al., 2010; Pei et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016). The
data were collected using a PC and were analyzed using the MED Asso-
ciates Activity Monitor Data Analysis software. Mice were placed in a
corner of the open-field apparatus and allowed to move freely. The vari-
ables recorded included resting time (seconds), ambulatory time (sec-
onds), vertical/rearing time (seconds), jump time (seconds), stereotypic
time (seconds), and average velocity (centimeters per second). The mice
were not exposed to the chamber before testing. The data were recorded
for each animal during 30 min intervals. For the rotarod test, mice were
subjected to a 1 week learning period, after which they were able to
perform on an accelerating rotarod. The test was then performed twice
per week until the mice were unable to remain on the rotating bar for
�10 s in three consecutive attempts, which was defined as rotarod
failure.
Data analysis. All variance values in the text and figure legends are
represented as the mean � SEM. Parametric tests, including t tests and
two-way ANOVAs, were used when assumptions of normality and equal
variance (F test) were met; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was
used to analyze the Morris Water Maze data. Differences were considered
statistically significant when p � 0.05.
Results
Activation of DAPK1 in ECIIPN of AD mice
To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective
degeneration of ECIIPN synapses in AD mice, we focused our
studies on DAPK1, an enzyme critical for synaptic losses in cen-
tral neurons (Tu et al., 2010). To functionally and morphologi-
cally identify individual ECIIPN, we generated AD/ECIIPN
ChR2�
mice, in which channelrhodopsin-2-E123A (ChR2), a modified
version of a light-gated cation channel, and an eGFP were selec-
tively expressed in the vulnerable ECIIPN of the AD mice. A
mouse model of AD was chosen because these mice carry a trans-
gene coding for the 695 amino acid isoform of the human Alz-
heimer A� precursor protein with the Swedish mutation and
exhibit plaque pathologies similar to those in AD patients.
Specifically, we created a conditional line of mutant mice that
expressed a double-floxed inverted open reading frame of
ChR2-eGFP (ChR2loxP/loxP mice; Fig. 1A). We also constructed a
Type 1/2 recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV1/2)-D28K-Cre
virus vector, in which Cre recombinase was expressed under the
control of the D28K promoter (Fig. 1B). Virus particles at high
titer were injected directly into the ECII of the AD/ChR2loxP/loxP
mice, resulting in the ChR2-eGFP expression specifically in the
ECIIPN (Fig. 1B). ECIIPN cells were named as island cells, in which
Wfs1 is expressed (Kitamura et al., 2014). Consistent with this
previous study, we showed that ECIIPN that directly innervate
CA1PV were labeled with an antibody against Wfs1 protein (Fig.
1C). Thus, ECIIPN
ChR2� neurons comprise a group of excitatory
island cells.
We next isolated ECIIPN
ChR2� cells from the brain tissues of
the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice using flow cytometry and cell sorting
techniques. To determine the catalytic activity of DAPK1 in the
purified ECIIPN
ChR2� cells, we applied an immunocomplex ki-
nase assay with MLC as an endogenous substrate of DAPK1
(Tu et al., 2010). We precipitated DAPK1 protein complex in the
cell lysates of the ECIIPN
ChR2� cells from the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2�
mice and the controls (the control/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice) using an
antibody against DAPK1. The precipitates were then blotted with
antibodies against a pMLC and DAPK1, respectively (Fig. 1D).
Our data revealed that the levels of pMLC were increased in
the ECIIPN
ChR2� cells from the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice after 150 d
of age (Fig. 1D), compared with the age-matched control/
ECIIPN
ChR2� mice (Fig. 1E). The pMLC was catalyzed by an acti-
vated DAPK1 as MLC kinase (MLCK) that also targets MLC at
serine-20 was undetectable in the precipitates from the
ECIIPN
ChR2� cells of the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice (Fig. 1F). An in-
crease of the pMLC was found in the ECIIPN
ChR2� cells only, but
not in the frontal cortical neurons from the AD/ECIIPN

 mice (Fig. 1G). Together, these data demonstrate that DAPK1 is
activated selectively in ECIIPN cells of AD mice during aging.
Genetic inhibition of DAPK1 in ECIIPN of AD mice
We next determined whether activation of DAPK1 in the ECIIPN of
AD mice contributes to impairments in synaptic transmission along
the ECIIPN-CA1PV pathway. We developed two independent ap-
proaches to inhibiting DAPK1 function in the ECIIPN of AD mice.
First, we generated a mutant strain of mice (DAPK1CDloxP/loxP) in
which a double-floxed inverted open reading frame of DAPK1 with
a CD deletion was expressed (Fig. 2A,B). When these mice were
bred with AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice, which Cre recombinase was ex-
pressed in the ECIIPN
ChR2� cells (for details, see Fig. 1B), the CD of
DAPK1 (DAPK1CD�) was selectively deleted in the ECIIPN
ChR2� of
the offspring (AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice; Fig. 2C–E). To verify the suc-
cessful generation of AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice, we performed two inde-
pendent lines of the studies. First, we stained the sections from the
AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice with antibody against D28K protein and
showed that the DAPK1CD� mutant protein in the ECIIPN
ChR2�
cells was recognized by anti-D28K (Fig. 2D). Second, we isolated the
ECIIPN
ChR2� cells from the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice using flow cytom-
etry and cell sorting techniques. The cell lysates were prepared from
the isolated ECIIPN
ChR2� cells and precipitated with anti-DAPK1.
The precipitates were blotted with antibodies against pMLC and
DAPK1 proteins, as indicated (Fig. 2E). Our data revealed a com-
plete loss of DAPK1 enzymatic activity in the ECIIPN
ChR2� cells of
the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice (Fig. 2E).
Next, we generated the mutant mice (DAPK1DDloxP/loxP mice)
in which a double-floxed inverted open reading frame of DAPK1
lacking a DD was expressed (Fig. 2F,G). When these mice were

Protection against ECIIPN synaptic decay in AD mice
To determine whether the genetic inhibition of DAPK1 might
avert the ECIIPN synaptic decay in AD mice, we performed
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with the CA1PV (Fig. 3A)
from the AD/ECIIPN
CD� and AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice at 180 � 5 d of
age as well as age-matched controls (AD/ECIIPN
ChR2�, the con-
trol/ECIIPN
DD�, and the control/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice). EPSCs were
evoked by delivering blue laser light directly to the ECIIPN
ChR2�
in brain slices. To exclude disturbances from other projections
(i.e., the ECIIPN-DG-CA3-CA1PV indirect pathway), we cut off
the connections of the dentate gyrus to the CA3 cells in the slices
(Fig. 3A) and recorded NMDA-mediated EPSCs at a holding
potential of 60 mV. The recordings were performed in the pres-
Figure4.

der
this
circumstance,
we
were
able
to
record
mon-
osynaptic transmission between ECIIPN and CA1PV cells in the
slices. We then analyzed the mean amplitudes of the evoked
EPSCs with the increases of the stimulus intensities (Fig. 3A). We
demonstrated that the genetic inhibition of DAPK1 specifically in
the ECIIPN did not alter synaptic transmission in the control mice
(the peak values of the mean amplitudes were 99 � 13 pA in the
control/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice vs 92 � 15 pA in the control/
ECIIPN
CD� mice), but it was effective in reversing the ECIIPN-
CA1PV synaptic decline in the AD mice (peak values of the mean
amplitudes were 65 � 8 pA in the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice vs 93 �
9 pA in the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice).
Next, we examined the structure of ECIIPN-CA1PV synapses in
the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice (Fig. 3B). At presynaptic sites, the excit-
atory terminals in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, an
afferent axon terminal zone of the ECIIPN
ChR2� in the CA1 hip-
pocampus, were analyzed (Fig. 3B). The density of ChR2-eGFP-
labeled terminals (50 �m � 200 �m) in the AD mice at 180 � 5 d
of age was 29.1 � 3.2% lower than that of the age-matched con-
trols (Fig. 3C). This reduction in the number of excitatory syn-
aptic terminals in the the stratum lacunosum-moleculare region
of the AD mice was completely rescued in both the AD/
ECIIPN
CD� and AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice (Fig. 3C). At postsynaptic
sites, we stained the sections with an antibody against the PV
protein (Fig. 3B), which revealed that the dendritic branch spines
(50 �m segment) from the antibody-labeled CA1PV cells (50 seg-
ments per animal) in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare region
of the AD mice decreased by 35.1 � 3.9% compared with those in
the age-matched controls (5.3 � 0.63 vs 3.3 � 0.36, mean � SEM,
n � 50 dendritic branches/5 mice/group, p � 0.001; Fig. 3C). The
inhibition of DAPK1 completely rescued the synaptic loss of the
CA1PV in the AD mice (5.1 � 0.59 in the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice,
4.9 � 0.62 in the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice vs 5.2 � 0.58 in the con-
trols, mean � SEM, n � 50 dendritic branches/5 mice/group, p �
0.05; Fig. 3C).
Impairments of synaptic transmission along the ECIIPN-
CA1PV excitatory pathway, which primarily target the dendrites
of CA1 excitatory pyramidal neurons (CA1PN) disrupt the excit-
atory and inhibitory balance in the CA1 neural circuits of AD
mice (Lesne et al., 2006; Mucke, 2007; Palop and Mucke, 2009).
Therefore, protecting the ECIIPN-CA1PV pathway from synaptic
loss in AD mice should restore the excitatory and inhibitory bal-
ance in the CA1 circuits (Fig. 3D–F). To test this hypothesis, we
monitored the activity of CA1 neuronal cells in freely moving
mice at 180 � 5 d of age by using extracellular single-unit record-
ing techniques (Yang et al., 2016). Action potentials that origi-
nated from the CA1PN versus the CA1PV of freely moving mice
were classified on the basis of the properties of the action poten-
tial, as recently described (Yang et al., 2016). In the AD mice, the
probability of action potential firing was dramatically reduced in
the CA1PV (11.8 � 1.6 vs 16.9 � 1.9, mean � SEM, n � 36 units/9
mice/group, p � 0.001; Fig. 3G) and increased in the CA1PN
(5.6 � 0.68 vs 3.3 � 0.51, mean � SEM, n � 36 units/9 mice/
group, p � 0.001; Fig. 3H), compared with the age-matched
Figure 5.

Shu et al. • Degeneration of CA1 Synapse via DAPK1 in Alzheimer’s Disease
 control mice, thus showing that the excitatory and inhibitory
balance was disrupted in the CA1 circuits of the AD mice. In the
AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice, in which DAPK1 was inactivated specifi-
cally in the ECIIPN, the excitatory and inhibitory balance in the
CA1 circuits was restored; the probabilities of action potential
firings in both the CA1PV (16.2 � 1.8 vs 17.5 � 1.8, mean � SEM,
n � 36 units/9 mice/group, p � 0.05) and the CA1PN (3.7 � 0.52
vs 3.7 � 0.58, mean � SEM, n � 36 units/9 mice/group, p � 0.05;
Fig. 3H,G) were identical to those in the age-matched controls.
In the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice, action potential firing in both the
CA1PV and CA1PN was comparable with that in the age-matched
controls. Together, these data demonstrate that the inhibition of
DAPK1 by selective deletion of either the DAPK1 CD or DAPK1
DD within the ECIIPN prevents the decay of the ECIIPN-CA1PV
synaptic transmission and hence restores the excitatory and in-
hibitory balance in the CA1 circuits of the AD mice.
Improvements in spatial learning and memory in AD mice
We next determined whether preventing the synaptic impair-
ments via the inhibition of DAPK1 in the ECIIPN improves spatial
learning and memory in the AD mice. We analyzed the task per-
formance of mice at 180 � 5 d of age in a hidden version of the
Morris Water Maze test. The AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice showed better
performance in all the measured indices (Fig. 4A–G); the latency
and swim length to reach a hidden platform during the training
session (Fig. 4A–G), and the percentage of time spent in search of
a hidden platform in each quadrant during the probe trial (Fig.
4D–G) were comparable between the AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice (la-
tency � 16.9 � 1.7 s; length � 192 � 21 cm; percentage time �
37 � 3.5) and the control AD/ECIIPN
CD� mice (latency � 15.7 �
1.3 s; length � 183 � 19 cm; percentage time � 35.5 � 3.6).
These data indicate that the inhibition of DAPK1 effectively
averts the decay of spatial learning and memory in the AD mice.
Consistently with this conclusion, the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice with
a deletion of the DAPK1 DD in the ECIIPN also exhibited signif-
icant improvements in acquiring spatial information during the
Morris Water Maze tests (latency � 15.0 � 1.6 s; length � 191 �
18 cm; percentage time � 38 � 3.2 in the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice vs
latency � 17.1 � 1.6 s; length � 189 � 20 cm; percentage time �
34.9 � 3.3 in the AD/ECIIPN
ChR2� mice; Fig. 4H,I). To deter-
mine the specific effects of DAPK1 inhibition on spatial learning
and memory, we also performed learning-unrelated behavioral
tests, including open field, rotarod, elevated plus maze, and
forced swimming. Our data revealed that all the groups of mice,
including the AD mice at 180 � 5 d of age, performed normally in
all of the learning-unrelated tests, compared with the age-
matched controls (Fig. 5A–D).
Discussion
ECIIPN are some of the earliest affected brain cells in AD, and the
selective expression of human mutant APP in the ECIIPN of mice
impairs spatial learning and memory (Harris et al., 2010). Con-
sistently, our data revealed that DAPK1 was selectively activated
in the ECIIPN of AD mice and that the genetic inhibition of
DAPK1 effectively protected against impairments in the ECIIPN-
CA1PV synaptic transmission and improved spatial learning and
memory.
The key findings in the present study include the following:
(1) DAPK1 is selectively activated in ECIIPN in the early stages
of AD mice; and (2) the specific inhibition of DAPK1 in the
ECIIPN of AD mice results in therapeutic effects against de-
clines in spatial learning and memory. DAPK1 is a Ca 2�/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and was originally
identified by functional cloning on the basis of its involvement
in interferon-�-induced apoptosis (Shohat et al., 2001). Pre-
viously, we have reported that DAPK1 is activated in central
neurons and contributes to neuronal death (Tu et al., 2010).
More recently, we have reported that activated DAPK1 di-
rectly binds and phosphorylates the Tau protein on Ser262
and induces synaptic degeneration (Pei et al., 2015). Hyper-
phosphorylation of Tau (tau inclusions, pTau) results in the
self-assembly of tangles of paired helical filaments and straight
filaments in the brain, which are involved in the early patho-
genesis of AD (Alonso et al., 2001; Clavaguera et al., 2009;
Hoover et al., 2010; de Calignon et al., 2012; Spires-Jones and
Hyman, 2014). In the present study, we found that genetic
deletion of the DAPK1 DD in the AD/ECIIPN
DD� mice dis-
rupted binding of DAPK1 to the Tau protein in ECIIPN. Thus,
the DAPK1-Tau interaction may be a crucial signaling event
underlying the early degeneration of excitatory synaptic
transmission at ECIIPN-CA1PV synapses and may be a prom-
ising target for therapeutic interventions to treat disease
progression.
The present study analyzed task performance in a hidden
version of the Morris Water Maze test and revealed that AD
mice exhibit spatial learning and memory defects beginning at
6 months of age (Hsiao et al., 1996; Langston et al., 2010).
Previous studies have reported that AD mice show deficits in
task performance at 9 months of age (Hsiao et al., 1996) or
after 14 months of age (Holcomb et al., 1999). However, sev-
eral other studies have described the presence of behavioral
deficits in AD mice as early as 3–6 months of age (King and
Arendash, 2002; Lindner et al., 2006; Fritsch et al., 2010). The
discrepancies among these studies may be due to differences in
the experimental paradigms and in the genetic backgrounds of
the mice used in the different laboratories. For example, some
studies used a training schedule with 9 trials per day for 6 d,
whereas others applied 10 trials per day for 4 d. The genetic
background of the AD mice also affects the outcome of behav-
ioral tests. In the present study, the AD mice and the nontrans-
genic controls were housed under the same conditions and
were derived from the same litters; therefore, these parameters
should not affect our conclusion that the activation of DAPK1
in ECIIPN contributes to impairments in spatial learning and
memory in AD mice.
