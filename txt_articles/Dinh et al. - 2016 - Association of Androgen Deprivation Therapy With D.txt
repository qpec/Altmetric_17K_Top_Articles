Purpose
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may contribute to depression, yet several studies have not
demonstrated a link. We aimed to determine whether receipt of any ADT or longer duration of ADT
for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with an increased risk of depression.
Methods
We identified 78,552 men older than age 65 years with stage I to III PCa using the SEER-
Medicare–linked database from 1992 to 2006, excluding patients with psychiatric diagnoses within
the prior year. Our primary analysis was the association between pharmacologic ADT and the
diagnosis of depression or receipt of inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment using Cox pro-
portional hazards regression. Drug data for treatment of depression were not available. Our sec-
ondary analysis investigated the association between duration of ADT and each end point.
Results
Overall, 43% of patients (n = 33,882) who received ADT, compared with patients who did not
receive ADT, had higher 3-year cumulative incidences of depression (7.1% v 5.2%, respectively),
inpatient psychiatric treatment (2.8% v 1.9%, respectively), and outpatient psychiatric treatment
(3.4% v 2.5%, respectively; all P , .001). Adjusted Cox analyses demonstrated that patients with
ADT had a 23% increased risk of depression (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15 to
1.31), 29% increased risk of inpatient psychiatric treatment (AHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.41), and a
nonsignificant 7% increased risk of outpatient psychiatric treatment (AHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97 to
1.17) compared with patients without ADT. The risk of depression increased with duration of ADT,
from 12% with # 6 months of treatment, 26% with 7 to 11 months of treatment, to 37%
with $ 12 months of treatment (P trend , .001). A similar duration effect was seen for inpatient
(P trend , .001) and outpatient psychiatric treatment (P trend , .001).
Conclusion
Pharmacologic ADT increased the risk of depression and inpatient psychiatric treatment in this large
study of elderly men with localized PCa. This risk increased with longer duration of ADT. The possible
psychiatric effects of ADT should be recognized by physicians and discussed with patients before
initiating treatment.

INTRODUCTION
After
multiple
randomized
controlled
trials
demonstrated improved survival with androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) alongside radiation
therapy (RT) for high-risk and locally ad-
vanced prostate cancer (PCa),1-7 the propor-
tion of patients with PCa given ADT within
12 months of diagnosis increased to nearly 50%
by 2002.8 Although ADT has survival benefits,
mounting evidence has demonstrated extensive
adverse effects, including metabolic, cardiovascular,
bone, and cognitive.9 There is reason to believe
that ADT may negatively impact mood, causing
clinically significant depression. Although several
small studies have not identified any association
between ADT and clinical depression,10-15 pos-
sibly as a result of inadequate power, others have
found a significant association16-18; yet there
remains no consensus on the subject. To inves-
tigate this further, we used a large population-
based data set to measure the association be-
tween pharmacologic ADT and diagnosis of
depression and increased psychiatric use in men

 with localized PCa, as well as to measure the effect of ADT duration
on these outcomes.
METHODS
Data Source
Data were abstracted from the SEER-Medicare–linked database.
SEER is a population-based registry sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute including 18 regions, or 28% of the US population.19 Medicare
provides federal health insurance for approximately 97% of individuals age
65 years and older, and Medicare to SEER linkage is complete for 93% of
eligible patients.20
Study Cohort
The initial cohort of 172,733 patients included men age 66 years and
older diagnosed with clinically localized PCa between 1992 and 2006
who had no other malignancy in SEER, had both Medicare Part A and B
claims available from 1 year before through 36 months after diagnosis,
and were not enrolled in a health maintenance organization from 1992
to 2006. Patients diagnosed at autopsy or by death certificate (n = 5,315)
or who died within 6 months of diagnosis (n = 21) were excluded (Appendix
Table A1, online only). Patients with orchiectomy were excluded (n = 2,986)
to avoid confounding from effects that physical and anatomic changes from
castration may have on depression. Additionally, to reduce confounding of
advanced or recurrent disease, men with stage IV or unknown stage PCa
(n = 68,133) were excluded, as were men started on ADT beyond 6 months
from PCa diagnosis, because this could be salvage ADT (n = 10,255). Finally,
patients with a diagnosis of depression from 12 months before diagnosis
through time 0 (t0; defined as 6 months after diagnosis) were excluded
(n = 7,511). These patients were identified if International Classification of
Diseases codes, ninth revision (ICD-9), (296.2, 296.3, 296.5, 296.6, 296.7,
298.0, 301.10, 301.12, 301.13, 309.0, 309.1, and 311; further described in
Appendix Table A2, online only).21-23 The final cohort included 78,552
patients with localized PCa.
Patient Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics
Each patient’s age at diagnosis, race, marital status, and county-level
population density were extracted from SEER. Zip code–level median
income and education (percentage with college diploma) were identified
from census-linked data. Comorbidity status was assigned using the
Klabunde modification24 of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) as 0, 1,
or $ 2 from Medicare claims data 1 year before PCa diagnosis.
Clinically, overall stage was recorded as stage I, II, or III. Gleason
score was recorded from SEER grade where, before 2003, well differ-
entiated was defined as a Gleason score of 2 to 4, moderately differentiated
was defined as a Gleason score of 5 or 6, and poorly differentiated was
defined as a Gleason score of 7 to 10. After 2004, Gleason score was
recorded, and we categorized patients similarly. Three risk groups were
defined by modification of the risk groups identified by Lu-Yao et al,25 with
risk group A as stage I to II and Gleason score of 2 to 6, risk group B as stage
I to II and Gleason score of 7 to 10, and risk group C as stage III with any
grade.25
Primary Treatment Type
Patients were categorized as receiving ADT (ADT+) if ADT was the
primary therapy or if ADTwas given alongside radical prostatectomy (RP)
or RT before t0. Patients were categorized as not receiving ADT (ADT2) if
ADT was not started from diagnosis through the follow-up period of 36
months after diagnosis. Primary treatment was defined as RP with or
without ADT, RT with or without ADT, or ADT alone if initiated before
t0 as identified through SEER-Medicare claims files, as previously
described.25,26 Primary treatment was assigned as observation if there was
an absence of active treatment codes. ADT+ was stratified by duration,
defined as 1 to 6, 7 to 11, and $ 12 months.
End Points
The primary end point of interest was a diagnosis of depression,
defined as the presence of depression codes (Appendix Table A2), in
Medicare claims data, including physician, outpatient, and inpatient
claims, from t0 through 36 months after PCa diagnosis. Secondary end
points included any outpatient psychiatric or inpatient psychiatric use.27-29
Psychiatric use was measured by depression diagnosis code or psychiatric
procedure code and categorized as inpatient or outpatient treatment
(Appendix Table A2). The ICD-9 and procedure codes used to identify the
end points in this study have not been formally validated but have been
used in prior studies.27-29
Statistical Analysis
Baseline demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were
described for the overall cohort, stratified by ADT+ and ADT2 and
compared using x2 test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum
test for ordinal variables. The incidence of and time to primary and
secondary end points were measured and compared by x2 analysis and
Wilcoxon rank sum test. A number needed to harm was also calculated.
Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to compare the pos-
sible effect of any ADT versus no ADT, controlling for demographic and
clinical factors, on primary and secondary end points. The analysis was
repeated for an association with duration of ADT (1 to 6, 7 to 11,
and $ 12 months). Finally, propensity-matched sensitivity analyses, with
1:1 matching without replacement, were conducted for each end point as a
sensitivity analysis (Appendix, online only).30 Demographic covariates
included age at diagnosis, marital status, race, county-level population
density, zip code income and education quartiles, and year of diagnosis.
Clinical variables included modified CCI, PCa risk group, and receipt of
primary RP or RT. An interaction term was measured between year of
diagnosis (1992 to 1999 v 2000 to 2006) and receipt of ADTon a diagnosis
of depression to consider homogeneity of the effect of ADTover the study
duration. Finally, unadjusted cumulative incidence function graphs were
created comparing time to depression and inpatient psychiatric treatment
by receipt of ADT.
Statistical testing was two-sided with a level of significance set at
P = .05. Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s Institutional Review Board
provided a waiver of informed consent for this study.
RESULTS
Baseline Patient Demographics and Treatment
The study cohort included 78,552 men with localized PCa, of
whom 33,882 (43.1%) received ADTwithin 6 months of diagnosis
(ADT+). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics com-
pared between patients who were ADT+ and those who were
ADT2 are listed in Table 1. To summarize, the ADT+ cohort was
older at diagnosis, had more comorbidities, had shorter life
expectancies, and had more high-grade disease (all P , .001).
Of the 44,670 patients categorized as ADT2, 25.3% had RP,
44.2% had RT, and 30.5% received no treatment. Of the 33,882
patients categorized as ADT+, 6.0% had RP plus ADT, 64.9% had
RT plus ADT, and 29.1% had ADT alone. In the 2 years after
diagnosis, 45.3% of the ADT+ cohort received # 6 months of ADT,
22.1% received 7 to 11 months of ADT, and 32.6% received $ 12
months of ADT. In this last strata, 40.8% of patients (n = 4,515)
received $ 18 months of ADT.

 Risk of Depression and Psychiatric Treatment
Associated With Any ADT
The cumulative incidence of new depression from 6 to
36 months after PCa diagnosis was higher in the ADT+ than the
ADT2 cohorts (7.1% v 5.2%, respectively; P ,.001; Table 1). The
number needed to harm was 53 patients. More patients who were
ADT+ had inpatient (2.8% v 1.9%, respectively) and outpatient
psychiatric treatment (3.4% v 2.5%, respectively; all P , .001;
Table 1).
An adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that,
compared with ADT–, there was a 23% increased risk of depression
associated with the ADT+ cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR],
1.23; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.31; P ,.001). Similarly, the ADT+ cohort
had a 29% increased risk, compared with the ADT– cohort, of
inpatient psychiatric treatment (AHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.43;
P , .001) and a 7% increased risk of outpatient psychiatric
treatment (AHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.17; P = .17). These
associations were strengthened when using propensity matching in
sensitivity analyses (Appendix Table A3, online only). Older age,
being unmarried, and having greater comorbidity (CCI . 0) were
also associated with increased risk of depression (all P ,.001). An
interaction term between the era of PCa diagnosis (1992 to 1999
v 2000 to 2006) and the receipt of ADT on depression was not
significant (P = .306), suggesting that the effect of receiving ADTon
a diagnosis of depression was not significantly different before or
after the year 2000. Figures 1 and 2 show the unadjusted cumu-
lative incidence function of time to depression and inpatient
psychiatric treatment, respectively, demonstrating that the inci-
dence was increased almost immediately after initiating ADT
therapy.
Risk of Depression and Psychiatric Treatment
Associated With Duration of ADT
The ADT+ cohort was stratified by duration of therapy,
defined as # 6, 7 to 11, and $ 12 months. The cumulative
incidence of depression increased by strata, from 6.1% to 7.6% to
8.0% with # 6, 7 to 11, and $ 12 months of ADT, respectively,

Association of Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Depression
 compared with an incidence of 5.2% in the ADT2 cohort (P ,.001).
The incidence of inpatient psychiatric treatment increased by strata,
from 2.4% to 3.0% to 3.3%, respectively, compared to 1.9% in the
ADT2 cohort (P , .001), as did the incidence of outpatient psy-
chiatric treatment, from 2.8% to 3.5% to 4.1%, respectively, compared
to 2.5% in the ADT2 cohort (P , .001).
Table 2 shows the adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis
of the association between ADT duration and each end point,
controlling for demographic and clinical variables. The risk for
depression among the ADT+ cohort compared with the ADT2
cohort increased with ADT duration, from a 12% higher risk
with # 6 months (AHR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.21) to 26% with
7 to 11 months (AHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.39) and 37%
with $ 12 months of ADT (AHR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.49;
P trend , .001). Similarly, the risk of inpatient psychiatric
treatment increased with ADT duration, compared with no ADT,
from 16% higher risk with # 6 months (AHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02
to 1.32) to 28% with 7 to 11 months (AHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10 to
1.50) and 47% with $ 12 months of ADT (AHR, 1.47; 95% CI,
1.29 to 1.68; P trend , .001). The risk for outpatient psychiatric
treatment increased slightly with duration of ADT from 3% lower
risk with # 6 months (AHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.10) to 3%
higher risk with 7 to 11 months (AHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19)
and 20% higher risk with $ 12 months of ADT (AHR, 1.20; 95%
CI, 1.07 to 1.35; P trend = .04).
DISCUSSION
Patients who received any ADT had a 23% increased risk of new
depression compared with patients who did not receive ADTwhen
adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in this large,
population-based study of 78,000 US men with localized PCa
age $ 66 years. We also observed a significant trend between an
increased duration of ADT and increased risk of depression,
finding that patients receiving # 6 months of ADT had a 12%
increased risk of depression compared with no ADT versus a 37%
increased risk with $ 12 months of ADT. This evidence strongly
suggests an association between receiving ADT and developing
new depression in men age $ 66 years with localized PCa.
The impact of ADT on depression may plausibly occur via
deregulation of neurochemicals, such as serotonin, in addition to
the well-described physical effects.31,32 Although a direct mech-
anism linking ADT to depression has yet to be identified, studies in
mice have demonstrated that enzymes responsible for maintaining
the neurochemical balance are hormonally responsive and that
gonectamized mice have higher activity of monoamine oxidase
A in the prefrontal cortex compared with controls.31 This in-
creased activity of monoamine oxidase A could be responsible for
deregulation of serotonin and thus increased rates of depression.
Additionally, low testosterone has been associated with increased
depression in otherwise healthy men,33-35 although the literature is
somewhat inconsistent.12,36 Additionally, the many known adverse
effects of ADT have been shown to negatively impact quality of
life,32 including physical effects, such as erectile dysfunction,
shortening of penile length, vasomotor flushing, weight gain, and
gynecomastia, as well as cognitive effects, including insomnia and a
decline in verbal and executive function.9,36
Because data from physician claims have been shown to
underestimate disease incidence37 and can be subject to coding
errors, we chose two additional measures of clinically significant
psychiatric disease—inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treat-
ment. A similar measurement was used in a population-based
study of PCa in Sweden.29 We again found the risk for inpatient
psychiatric treatment increased with ADT duration, from 16%
for # 6 months of ADT (AHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.32) to 47%
with $ 12 months of ADT (AHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.68;
P trend , .001) compared with no ADT. The P trend values
for both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment were

 significant, demonstrating that with increasing duration of ADT
the relative risk of these outcomes increased compared with no
ADT. The association of ADT with psychiatric treatment provides
further evidence that ADTmay have a clinically significant effect on
psychiatric health.
There are multiple implications of our findings. First, we
contribute to mounting evidence around the extensive adverse
effect profile of ADT,9,36 which should include risk of clinically
significant psychiatric disease. Physicians should note psychiatric
illness as a possible adverse effect when discussing ADT and
consider including such effects in consent forms. Second, judicious
use of ADT is warranted to avoid unnecessary adverse effects. ADT
should not be used in low-risk patients, because it does not provide
benefit.38 Among patients with intermediate-risk PCa, the
potential benefits of ADT must be weighed against the potential
harms, including increased depression risk.
Third, further work should identify what patient subgroups
are at greatest risk of psychiatric adverse effects with ADTand what
interventions may reduce this risk. In this study, older age, being
unmarried, and having more comorbidity were associated with
increased depression and psychiatric treatment. Although patients
with recent psychiatric disease were excluded from the current
study, other work has identified increased rates of depression
among similar patients.12,39 These populations may be appropriate
to target for early depression screening or intervention after ADT
initiation.
Depression in PCa also impacts health care use,21,40,41 including
increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations,40 and patient
outcomes, including increased suicide and overall mortality.42
Therefore, identification of and support for men at risk for
depression may have broad effects on quality of life, health care use,
and survival. Prior work identifying interventions to reduce the risk
of depression with ADT has suggested a role for exercise,9,37,41
although two reviews have concluded that the current evidence is
lacking.41,43 High-quality research on interventions to mitigate
depressive effects of ADT is needed. Prevention may be especially
important because little is known about whether ADT use modifies
the efficacy of commonly used treatments for depression in these
patients.44,45 Prior work has demonstrated that further character-
ization of depressive symptoms in men receiving ADT may also
guide identification and treatment.46
Published literature considering the association between
ADTand depression has been highly inconsistent.10-18,40,47 Many of
these studies were likely underpowered, failing to find an association
between ADT and depression, whereas previous population-based
studies have used a broad definition of depression47 or considered
only primary rather than adjuvant ADT,29 limiting the general-
izability of their results. Our findings show that any ADT increases
the risk of depression using a more specific definition of clinical
depression, demonstrate an association between ADTand increased
psychiatric treatment, and show that ADT is associated with these
outcomes in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, we demonstrated a
dose-response relationship with ADT duration, which may reflect a
direct biologic effect of increased exposure to ADT, an indirect
biologic effect as a result of other symptoms (eg, decreased libido),
or a negative emotional response to being told that one needs a
longer course of ADT. ADT duration has only been previously
considered in three small studies, none of which demonstrated
different risk with duration of ADT or between long- and short-
course ADT.12,32,37
There are some potential limitations of this study. First, on the
basis of the eligibility for Medicare, the cohort was limited to
patients age $ 66 years at diagnosis. Therefore, these results may
not reflect the psychiatric effects of ADT given to younger men,
who account for approximately one third of patients with PCa.48
Second, the outcome of depression was based on diagnosis, rather

Association of Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Depression
 than symptoms, which relied on physician recognition and report-
ing.49 Older men are less likely to report depressive symptoms and
often present with somatic rather than emotional symptoms12,50,51;
therefore, it is possible that many symptomatic men were un-
diagnosed and therefore not measured in this study. This should
have affected each cohort similarly. Additionally, patients receiving
ADT likely had more appointments than the cohort that did not
receive ADT, and physicians may have been more sensitive to
symptoms of depression in patients receiving ADT or with more
aggressive disease, increasing the likelihood of patients who
received ADT being diagnosed with depression compared with
patients who did not receive ADT.
We attempted to account for this by also analyzing end points
such as inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment, which may
be less likely to be affected by this potential bias. The secondary end
point in this study was an exploratory analysis inspired by prior
studies conducted outside of SEER-Medicare considering psy-
chotherapy. Many codes included for this secondary end point
come from the psychotherapy literature as well as from identi-
fication of depression ICD-9 codes associated with hospitalization
(Appendix Table A2). The codes were carefully and thoughtfully
chosen to most accurately reflect psychiatric use by patients.
Third, we could not control for the use of psychotropic
medication before PCa diagnosis but did exclude patients based on
history of depressive diagnosis or psychiatric treatment. Data on
prescription of psychiatric medication were not available in SEER-
Medicare for use as an end point.
Fourth, increased depression associated with ADT may be
secondary to confounding, because these patients were older, had
more comorbidity, had more advanced disease, and experienced
physical effects of ADT. These additional symptoms and comor-
bidity could have led to an overdiagnosis of depression in the
ADT+ cohort. However, all multivariable analyses were adjusted
for demographic and clinical variables, including age, comorbidity
(CCI), and PCa risk group, and found a consistent increased risk
with duration of ADT across all three end points. In addition, a
greater proportion of the ADT+ cohort, compared to the ADT–
cohort, was composed of ethnic minorities (17.3% v 15.4%,
respectively) and had low comorbidity (CCI = 0; 66.2% v 64.5%,
respectively), which were both variables independently associated
with lower rates of depression in multivariable analyses. Fifth, we
cannot control for disease progression in patients receiving ADT,
which may contribute to increased incidence of depression. Finally,
this study is nonrandomized and shares the general limitations
associated with retrospective, observational studies.
In conclusion, we observed a significantly increased risk of
depression and inpatient psychiatric treatment in men treated with
ADT for PCa, as well as a duration-response effect such that more
ADT was linked to an increasing risk of depression and inpatient
and outpatient psychiatric treatment. The possible psychiatric
effects of ADT should be recognized by physicians and discussed
with patients before initiating treatment.

Association of Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Depression
 GLOSSARY TERMS
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): therapy which results
in a reduction of circulating testosterone levels, which may be achieved
by surgical castration, by LHRH agonists or antagonists, by androgen
receptor blockers, or by androgen synthesis blockers.
Charlson comorbidity index: a weighted index that takes into
account the number and seriousness of 19 comorbid diseases to cat-
egorize comorbidity burden. The Charlson comorbidity index has
prognostic significance in assessing disease outcomes and health
resource use and has been validated in the cancer population.
Gleason score: a pathologic description of prostate cancer grade on
the basis of the degree of abnormality in the glandular architecture.
Gleason patterns 3, 4, and 5 denote low, intermediate, and high levels of
histologic abnormality and tumor aggressiveness, respectively. The
score assigns primary and secondary numbers on the basis of the most
common and second most common patterns identified.

Appendix
Supplemental Methods
For the propensity-matched sensitivity analyses, nearest neighbor 1:1 matching was used—the preferred method for selecting
patients intended for follow-up.30 This method allowed patients in the ADT2 cohort who were not matched to patients in the ADT+
cohort to be discarded while maintaining the size of the ADT+ group. This method has also been shown to increase the overall
power of the comparison.30 The groups were also matched without replacement, because the ADT2 cohort was sufficiently large
enough to provide matches for each member of the ADT+ cohort. The propensity-matched cohorts were used to conduct
regression analyses considering the effect of any ADTon the incidence of depression, inpatient psychiatric treatment, and outpatient
psychiatric treatment.
