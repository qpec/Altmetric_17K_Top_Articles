ABSTRACT 
Objective: Recent systematic reviews have highlighted that the relationship between autism 
and violent offending is still unclear, but some cases have received extensive media scrutiny. 
We investigated whether autism is associated with convictions for violent crimes, and studied 
the associated risk and protective factors. 
Method: We analyzed data from the Stockholm Youth Cohort, a total population based 
record-linkage cohort in Stockholm County comprising 295,734 individuals followed-up 
between 15 through up to 27 years of age. Of these, 5,739 individuals had a recorded autism 
diagnosis. The main outcome measure was a conviction for violent crimes identified using 
the Swedish National Crime Register.  
Results: Individuals with autism, particularly those without intellectual disability initially 
appeared to have a higher risk of violent offending (adjusted relative risk 1.39, 95% 
confidence interval 1.23-1.58). However, these associations markedly attenuated after co-
occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorder were taken 
into account (0.85, 0.75-0.97). Among individuals with autism, male sex and psychiatric 
conditions were the strongest predictors of violent criminality, along with parental criminal 
and psychiatric history and socioeconomic characteristics. There was some evidence that a 
delayed diagnosis of autism was associated with a greater risk of violent crime. Better school 
performance and intellectual disability appeared to be protective.  
Conclusions and relevance: An initially observed association between autism and violent 
crimes at a population level was explained by comorbidity with ADHD and conduct disorder. 
Better understanding and management of comorbid psychopathology in autism may 
potentially help preventative action against offending behaviors in people with autism.

INTRODUCTION 
Autism spectrum disorders (henceforth referred to as autism) are developmental disorders 
with impairments in reciprocal social interaction and restricted repertoire of activities and 
interests.1 Despite a major increase in the numbers of individuals being diagnosed with 
autism in recent years,2 3 relatively little is known about what becomes of them later in life. 
Criminal offending is one important outcome of interest and some individual cases have 
received extensive media attention, perpetuating negative stereotypes about people with 
autism.4 Although clinicians know that some people with autism display challenging 
behaviors and come in contact with the criminal justice system, whether autism itself 
increases the risk of violence is still unclear.  
Such an association is plausible considering various features of autism such as impaired 
empathy, difficulties understanding emotional states of others, rigidity, and intolerance to 
change could potentially contribute to offending behaviours.5 6 It has also been suggested that 
psychiatric co-morbidities in autism may contribute to the risk of offending.7 8 On the other 
hand, people with autism can be very literal and pedantic in their adherence to the law, and a 
substantial proportion have  intellectual disability which may result in reduced community 
access and greater supervision, and these factors may protect against offending behaviors9.  
Antisocial behaviors in autism were first reported by Asperger in his cohort of children with 
‘autistic psychopathy’,10 followed by several case studies documenting offending behaviors 
in people with autism,11 12 particularly highlighting ‘bizarre’ and ‘unusual’ offending.11 
However, recent systematic reviews were inconclusive, reporting that much of the evidence 
on this topic to date was of ‘poor’ quality, and highlighted the need for robust research in the 
area.5 6 They highlighted a wide and inconsistent range of estimates of criminality reported by 
previous studies which typically included small, selected samples without a comparison 
 4 
 
group. A more recent Swedish population-based study found no evidence of an increased risk 
of violent criminality in 954 individuals with autism compared to controls.13 However, it did 
not separate autistic individuals by presence of intellectual disability, which is important as 
this may influence the level of supervision or independent access to the community.   
Apart from the inconsistent evidence on whether autism is associated with criminal behavior, 
there is very little information on risk and resilience factors in those with autism who do 
offend. A Swedish study of 422 inpatients with autism found that those convicted for violent 
crimes were more likely to be male, have a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome and had higher 
rates of psychiatric comorbidity and drug misuse compared to those who did not.7 This, and 
other studies8 implicating psychiatric morbidities have focused on adult conditions, but the 
role of childhood disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), known 
to be associated with autism and antisocial behaviors has not been examined. Furthermore, 
the suggestion that offending in autism may be correlated with a later age at diagnosis has yet 
to be substantiated.14 Understanding the characteristics associated with offending in autism is 
crucial to help identify higher risk groups and the development of preventive strategies.5  
We used data from a large population-based study in Sweden in order to address these 
omissions in the literature. The aims were: 1) to examine whether individuals with autism 
(with or without intellectual disability) were more likely to be at risk of violent offending 
than the general population ; and 2) to identify, within the population with autism, risk and 
protective factors associated with violent criminality. 
METHODS 
Study setting and design 
The Stockholm Youth Cohort (SYC) comprises all children and young people 0-17 years, 
ever resident in Stockholm County between 2001 and 2011 (N=735,096).3 Prospectively 
 5 
 
recorded data for probands, and their first-degree relatives has been collected by record 
linkage to a range of national and regional healthcare, social, and administrative registers 
using personal identification numbers. Data were available until 31 December 2011 when the 
oldest cohort members were 27 years of age. For this study, we included individuals with a 
minimum age of 15 years, which is the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden. Participants 
were therefore followed up from 15 years through up to a maximum of 27 years of age. We 
excluded individuals whose records could not be linked to their parents, adopted children and 
those with missing information on potential confounders. The eligible sample thus comprised 
295,734 individuals, of which 5,739 had an autism diagnosis (Figure 1).  
 
Identification of autism 
Individuals with autism in the SYC have been identified using a multi-source procedure 
described elsewhere.15-17 Briefly, Sweden has universally accessible publicly funded services 
relevant to autism. Autism assessments are carried out by neuropediatric, child and 
adolescent mental health services, or specialist teams for adults. The diagnostic evaluations 
typically cover the person’s social, medical, and developmental history, observation, and a 
structured assessment which includes cognitive testing. Diagnoses are recorded in the 
National Patient Register, the Stockholm County Child and Adolescent Mental Health 
Register and/or the Stockholm adult psychiatric outpatient register. We extracted diagnoses 
recorded in these registers (using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 
ICD-9 (299.x) and ICD-10 (F84.x), respectively, or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, fourth edition, (299.x)) and supplemented them by a record of care in 
specialist centers for autism with and without intellectual disability (ID), where an autism 
diagnosis and cognitive testing is a prerequisite. We have previously conducted two studies to 
validate autism diagnoses with and without intellectual disability recorded in the registers15. 
 6 
 
In the first, 170 of 177 (96%) case notes reviewed by two specialists supported a diagnosis of 
autism with respect to contemporary diagnostic criteria15. In the second, 23 of 27 (85%) twins 
recorded as having an ASD in the SYC who were a part of a national twins study of 
childhood neurodevelopmental disorders (CATSS) screened positive for ASD in that study,  
and only 1% of 2721 non-ASD twins in the SYC screened positive for ASD in CATSS15.  
Violent crimes 
The National Crime Register contains data for all convictions in Sweden since 1973, 
including the personal identification number of the individual convicted, details of the crime, 
and the conviction date.7 13 These details are recorded regardless of a custodial, non-custodial 
(including caution and fine) or mental health disposal. Swedish law does not have provisions 
of plea bargains or diversions prior to a trial and conviction process, regardless of the 
presence of disabilities or mental health problems. Sweden does not substantially differ from 
other European countries in the rates of violent crime and its resolution. It is estimated that 
99.95% entries within the crime register are linked to a personal identification number.7 
 
Crimes were categorized according to the Swedish Penal Code which contains provisions for 
most of the acts constituting a crime in Sweden. For this study, violent crimes included 
completed or attempted homicide or manslaughter, assaults (including gross bodily harm and 
other assaults) and unlawful threat with or without a weapon, sexual crimes (including rape, 
sexual coercion, sexual exploitation, indecent exposure or child molestation), robbery and 
arson, consistent with previous studies.7 
 
Other characteristics 
We used prospectively collected data on several personal and parental characteristics which 
could be considered as potential confounders. These included maternal age and paternal age 
 7 
 
at birth of child, family income adjusted for year of ascertainment and family size in 
quintiles,18 highest education of either parent (≤9 years, 10-12, ≥13 years), birth of parents or 
child outside of Sweden, parental history of violent crime convictions , and parental record of 
a psychiatric diagnosis. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders identified using the National 
patient register, the Stockholm child and adolescent mental health register, and the Stockholm 
adult psychiatric outpatient register included a registered diagnosis of ADHD (F90.x), 
conduct disorder including oppositional defiant disorder (F91.x), psychotic disorder (non-
affective and affective psychoses F20.x-29.x, F31.x), personality disorder (F60.x) and drug 
and alcohol misuse (F10.x-19.x). Although all these individual diagnoses have not been 
validated, previous studies suggest a high validity of psychiatric diagnoses recorded in 
Swedish registers.19 20 Data on the final composite school grade at the end of compulsory 
schooling at age 16 were obtained from the national school register21 and dichotomized into 
top five versus bottom five deciles of school performance.   
 
Statistical Analyses 
Analyses were conducted using Stata 13. After descriptive analyses, we used modified 
poisson regression22 to estimate the relative risks, with cluster robust 95% confidence 
intervals (accounting for clustering of children born to the same mother) of violent offending 
in people with autism compared to the population without autism. We conducted these 
analyses for autism spectrum disorder as a group, but also dichotomized by the presence or 
absence of intellectual disability, reflecting contemporary service models and prior studies 
highlighting important risk factors and outcomes between these groups.16 17 23 We adjusted 
our initial model for sex (since autism and violent crime are more common in males), and age 
at end of follow-up (to account for chronological age as well as different follow-up times). In 
Model 2, we further adjusted for parental age and education, family income, migrant status, 
 8 
 
history of violent crime and psychiatric diagnosis of each parent. In the final model, we 
adjusted for concurrent diagnoses of ADHD and conduct disorder (Model 3). To further 
assess the importance of comorbidity, we then stratified the population by the presence or 
absence of these conditions and repeated the analysis. Since other relevant, but later onset 
psychiatric disorders such as psychotic disorders, personality disorders or drug and alcohol 
misuse may be considered mediators or intermediate variables in the relationship, we did not 
adjust for them as this may introduce bias in the estimates24. However, we did study them 
separately, in analyses described below. 
 
To study the characteristics associated with violent criminality in individuals with autism, we 
estimated the associations of individual (sex, school grades, age at autism diagnosis, ADHD, 
conduct disorder, psychotic disorder, personality disorder, drug and alcohol misuse, 
intellectual disability) and family level (maternal and paternal age, parental education and 
income, parental convictions for violent crimes and psychiatric disorders) characteristics in 
individuals with autism who were convicted of a violent crime versus those without 
convictions.  
In sensitivity analyses, we repeated all the above analyses after removing individuals who 
received an autism diagnosis after having received a conviction for a violent crime. 
Ethical approval 
Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet, 
Stockholm [2013/1118-32]. 
 
RESULTS 
The eligible population comprised 295,734 individuals, of which 5,739 had an autism 
diagnosis who had follow-up information available from at least 15 years to up to 27 years of 
 9 
 
age. The characteristics of the study population are given in Table 1. By the end of follow-up, 
250 (4.4%) cohort members with a diagnosis of autism, and 7,643 (2.6%) cohort members 
without autism had received at least one conviction for a violent crime.   
Table 2 shows the relative risk of violent criminality in individuals with autism (and autism 
with or without intellectual disability) compared to the general population without autism. 
Individuals with autism appeared to be at a higher risk of convictions for violent criminality 
after adjustment for age, sex, and a range of parental characteristics (RR 1.39 95% CI 1.23 to 
1.58), which appeared to be specifically raised in those without intellectual disability (1.63, 
1.42 to 1.87). However, after adjusting for the presence of ADHD or conduct disorder, the 
risk estimates markedly attenuated (Table 2, model 3). 
We repeated the analysis after stratifying the cohort by the presence or absence of ADHD or 
conduct disorder (Table 3). As compared to cohort members without a diagnosis of autism, 
ADHD or conduct disorder; those who had only ADHD or conduct disorder but no autism 
had the highest risk of violent criminality (RR 3.87 95%CI 3.62 to 4.13). There was little 
evidence for an increased risk of violent criminality in those with autism in the absence of 
ADHD or conduct disorder (1.10,  0.92 to 1.31) but autistic individuals who also had these 
co-occurring diagnoses had an increased risk of violent criminality (2.69, 2.28 to 3.17). A 
similar pattern of results was observed when the analyses were further stratified by 
intellectual disability but individuals who had autism with intellectual disability were less 
likely to be convicted (0.58, 0.38 to 0.88), and those who had autism without intellectual 
disability more likely to be convicted (1.37, 1.12 to 1.66) compared to `cohort members 
without any of these disorders (Table 3).  
Table 4 shows the characteristics associated with violent criminality within individuals with 
autism. A range of parental and familial characteristics such as belonging to households with 
 10 
 
lower incomes, migrant households, parental history of criminal convictions and maternal 
psychiatric disorders were associated with violent criminality in individuals with autism. 
Among individual characteristics, male gender and a diagnosis of ADHD, conduct disorder, 
psychotic disorders, personality and drug and alcohol misuse disorders were associated with 
violent crime. A later age at first recorded diagnosis of autism also appeared to be associated 
with higher risk of convictions (RR per year of delayed diagnosis 1.05 95%CI 1.03 to 1.08). 
On the other hand, intellectual disability and better than average school grades appeared to be 
protective.  
In sensitivity analyses, we removed 71 people with autism out of the 250 who had been 
convicted for a violent crime but had their first recorded diagnosis of autism in the registers 
after the date of conviction. The results (see Tables S1,S 2 and S3, available online) were 
largely similar with the following exceptions: the main association between autism and 
violent crime was attenuated (see Table S1, available online); there was no evidence of an 
increased risk of violent crime in those who had autism without intellectual disability in the 
absence of ADHD or conduct disorder (see Table S2, available online); and there was no 
association between increasing age at first diagnosis of autism and violent crime convictions 
(see Table S3, available online). 
DISCUSSION 
In this large population-based study, a higher proportion of individuals with autism, 
particularly those without intellectual disability, had been convicted of a violent crime by the 
maximum age of 27 years than those without autism. However, co-occurring ADHD and 
conduct disorder largely explained this increased risk. These conditions along with other later 
onset psychiatric disorders and alcohol and drug misuse were the most important individual 
predictors of violent criminality in autism.  
 11 
 
To our knowledge, this is the largest study on this topic to date. The total-population cohort 
design minimizes the possibility of selection and recall bias. Our multisource approach for 
case identification is likely to have minimized exposure misclassification compared with 
studies ascertaining autism solely from inpatient records,7 or a single source.13 Convictions 
were ascertained using the Swedish crime register which records all criminal convictions in 
Sweden. Importantly, these data offer an advantage for epidemiological investigations of 
psychiatric disorders as there are no plea bargains or diversions prior to a trial and conviction 
process and are therefore likely to be an accurate reflection of the cohort’s resolved 
criminality. Violent offending is understood to peak between the ages of 15 to 20 years and 
then decreases substantially,25 so our follow-up until age 27 years offers the advantage of 
capturing the peak incidence of violent crimes in the population. The extensive data available 
allowed for consideration of a number of important potential confounders. Specifically, we 
are not aware of studies accounting for the role of childhood ADHD or conduct disorder 
which are associated with autism, and are well known predictors of crime.26  The ability to 
distinguish autism by the presence or absence of intellectual disability was important, 
considering individuals with greater levels of disabilities may have more supports in their 
environment, close monitoring and less independent access to the community reducing their 
chances to offend. 
Several limitations in this study should be considered. Crimes are under-reported in society, 
and it is possible that criminal behavior, particularly violence or assaults against carers is 
tolerated to a greater extent and under-reported in individuals with developmental disabilities 
such as autism, particularly in the presence of intellectual disability.27 28  This was reflected in 
our results and individuals who had autism with intellectual disability appeared to have a 
protective association with violent crime. However, the associations were similarly raised for 
 12 
 
people with or without intellectual disability when ADHD or conduct disorders were also 
present. On the other hand, individuals with autism under trial may be more likely to receive 
a conviction due to being more suggestible, acquiescent or adherent to the truth.29 30 These 
factors could lead to some differential outcome misclassification bias and could be an 
important limitation that is likely to affect any similar observational study. It was not possible 
to estimate risks for individual crimes due to small numbers, and larger studies would be 
required to address whether autism is associated with specific types of crimes at the 
population level. Finally, although this study is readily generalizable to the Swedish 
population, generalization to other populations should be made with caution. 
Over a quarter of the individuals with autism in the cohort also had a diagnosis of ADHD or 
conduct disorder, and the co-occurrence of these disorders with autism appeared to strongly 
influence convictions for violent offending. Children diagnosed with ADHD or conduct 
disorders are known to be at an increased risk of antisocial behaviors and violent offending,26 
31 and this was also reflected in our results. Interestingly, our findings suggest that the 
additional presence of an autism diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk of convictions 
relative to having these conditions without autism. Our study mirrors recent findings 
suggesting that ADHD may be an important factor in the development of antisocial behaviors 
in children with neurodevelopmental problems.31 Furthermore, there is some evidence from 
observational research that treatment of ADHD was associated with reduced risks of criminal 
offending.32 This raises the potential for early recognition of higher risk groups within the 
autism population, and possible prevention of future criminal activity. This should be a topic 
of further research and discussion.  
Many of the other characteristics associated with criminal convictions in people with autism, 
including socioeconomic factors, substance misuse and psychiatric morbidity mirrored 
 13 
 
known risk factors for criminality in the general population.33 The relationship between better 
academic achievement and lesser likelihood of crime is also well known.33 It is important to 
highlight that despite their possible over-representation in people with autism,23 psychiatric 
comorbidities in autism remain understudied. Service models for adults with autism, 
particularly in European countries are often focused on providing autism diagnoses rather 
than ongoing management or treatment of comorbidities.  
An intriguing finding was that a later diagnosis of autism appeared to be related to an 
increased risk of criminal convictions. This finding has been reported previously,14 but did 
not persist in analyses removing individuals who were registered with autism after having 
received a criminal conviction. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether an early diagnosis 
protects against criminal behaviors, or whether this association reflects bias related to other 
characteristics, such as greater severity (and thus greater supervision or reduced access to the 
community) or referral bias (a greater proportion of unidentified autism cases in the 
population being diagnosed following criminal convictions than in the general population). 
Regardless, it was notable that over a quarter of individuals with autism and criminal 
convictions had received a diagnosis only after they had already been convicted. Apart from 
other benefits of early diagnoses, whether it could play a role in the prevention of antisocial 
behaviors is a topic for future research.   
In conclusion, the initial observed association between autism and convictions for violent crimes at a 
population level in this study was explained by comorbidity with ADHD and conduct disorder which 
substantially increased the risk.  Better understanding and management of psychiatric 
comorbidity in autism may hold the potential for preventative action against antisocial 
behaviors and improved outcomes for people with autism.  
Clinical guidance  
 14 
 
 Over 28% of individuals with autism in this population based study also had a 
diagnosis of ADHD or conduct disorder and these comorbidities appeared to strongly 
influence convictions for violent crime.   
 In the absence of these comorbidities, individuals with autism were no more likely to 
have convictions for violent offending than the general population. 
 Early identification and management of mental health and neurodevelopmental 
comorbidity may have the potential to help reduce antisocial behaviors in individuals 
with autism.
