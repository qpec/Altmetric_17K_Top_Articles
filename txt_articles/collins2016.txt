Background
Preterm infants start milk feeds by gavage tube. As they mature, sucking feeds are gradually introduced. Women who choose to breast
feed their preterm infant are not always able to be in hospital with their baby and need an alternative approach to feeding. Most
commonly, milk (expressed breast milk or formula) is given by bottle. Whether using bottles during establishment of breast feeds is
detrimental to breast feeding success is a topic of ongoing debate.
Objectives
To identify the effects of avoidance of bottle feeds during establishment of breast feeding on the likelihood of successful breast feeding,
and to assess the safety of alternatives to bottle feeds.
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1980 to July 2016) and CINAHL (1982 to
July 2016). We also searched databases of clinical trials and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and
quasi-randomised trials.
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing avoidance of bottles with use of bottles in women who have chosen to
breast feed their preterm infant.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional
information. Review authors used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

 Main results
We included seven trials with 1152 preterm infants. Five studies used a cup feeding strategy, one used a tube feeding strategy and one
used a novel teat when supplements to breast feeds were needed. We included the novel teat study in this review, as the teat was designed
to more closely mimic the sucking action of breast feeding. The trials were of small to moderate size, and two had high risk of attrition
bias. Adherence with cup feeding was poor in one of the studies, indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents;
the remaining four cup feeding studies provided no such reports of dissatisfaction or low adherence. Meta-analyses provided evidence
of low to moderate quality indicating that avoiding bottles increases the extent of breast feeding on discharge home (full breast feeding
typical risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.80; any breast feeding RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16). Limited
available evidence for three months and six months post discharge shows that avoiding bottles increases the occurrence of full breast
feeding and any breast feeding at discharge and at six months post discharge, and of full (but not any) breast feeding at three months
post discharge. This effect was evident at all time points for the tube alone strategy and for all except any breast feeding at three months
post discharge for cup feeding. Investigators reported no clear benefit when the novel teat was used. No other benefits or harms were
evident, including, in contrast to the previous (2008) review, length of hospital stay.
Authors’ conclusions
Evidence of low to moderate quality suggests that supplementing breast feeds by cup increases the extent and duration of breast feeding.
Current insufficient evidence provides no basis for recommendations for a tube alone approach to supplementing breast feeds.

Avoidance of bottles during the establishment of breast feeds in preterm infants
Review question: In preterm infants whose mothers want to breast feed, does using bottles interfere with breast feeding success?
Background: Preterm infants start milk feeds by tube, and as they mature they are able to manage sucking feeds. The number of
sucking feeds each day is gradually increased as the baby matures. Women who choose to breast feed their preterm infant may find that
it is not always possible to be there every time the baby needs a sucking feed. Conventionally, bottles with mother’s milk or formula
have been used. It has been suggested that using bottles may interfere with breast feeding success.
Study characteristics: In searches updated to July 2016, we found seven eligible studies (involving 1152 preterm babies). These studies
were of small to moderate size, and most had some problems with study design or conduct.
Key results: Five of the studies (which included two of the largest studies) used cup feeds, and one used tube feeds. One study used
a specially designed teat with feeding action suggested to be more like breast feeding than conventional bottle feeding. Most studies
were conducted in high-income countries, only two in middle-income countries and none in low-income countries. Overall if bottle
feeds (with a conventional teat) were not given, babies were more likely to be fully breast fed or to have at least some breast feeds on
discharge home and at three and six months after discharge home. The study with the specially designed teat showed no difference in
breast feeding outcomes, so it was the cup alone or the tube alone that improved breast feeding rates. However, because of the poor
quality of the tube alone study, we cannot recommend a tube feeding strategy until further studies of high quality are undertaken. We
found no evidence of benefit or harm for any of the reported outcomes, including length of hospital stay or weight gain.
Conclusions: Using a cup instead of a bottle increases the extent and duration of breast feeding in preterm infants. Additional studies
are needed before a tube alone approach can be recommended.

Avoidance of bottles during the establishment of breast feeds in preterm infants (Review)

Description of the condition
Preterm infants begin sucking feeds when they are mature enough
to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing; this occurs at around 32 to
34 weeks’ gestation (Lemons 1996). Milk feeds are given through
a gavage tube until infants are able to receive all their intake by
sucking feeds. Once sucking feeds begin, they are increased grad-
ually, usually beginning with once a day and increasing as the in-
fant demands or is assessed as ready to progress. As the number of
sucking feeds increases, the number of tube feeds decreases until
sucking feeds alone provide sufficient intake for growth and de-
velopment. It is not always possible for a mother to be available to
breast feed during this transition time. Also at times after a breast
feed, the infant is assessed as having received insufficient milk, and
a ’top up’ with expressed breast milk or formula is required. In
these instances, it is common clinical practice for milk (breast or
formula) to be given by bottle in addition to any breast feeds.
Description of the intervention
Alternatives to bottles during this transition time have been re-
ported and include feeding the infant by cup (Lang 1994a), gav-
age tube (Stine 1990), finger feeding (Healow 1995; Kurokawa
1994), spoon (Aytekin 2014) and paladai - a traditional feeding
device used in India (Malhotra 1999). Increased breast feeding
prevalence has been reported when bottle feeds were replaced by
cup feeds (Abouelfettoh 2008; Gupta 1999; Lang 1994a) or tube
feeds (Stine 1990), and infants have been reported to achieve all
breast feeds sooner with spoon feeding (Aytekin 2014). However,
these studies were small and did not include a control.
How the intervention might work
It has been suggested that using bottles may interfere with estab-
lishing successful breast feeding, possibly because of a difference
in the sucking action required for the breast versus an artificial
nipple (Bu’Lock 1990; Neifert 1995).
Why it is important to do this review
Alternatives to breast feeds are not necessarily benign. With both
bottle feeds (Bier 1993; Blaymore Bier 1997; Chen 2000; Young
1995) and cup feeds (Dowling 2002; Freer 1999), mean oxygen
saturation was lower and the frequency of oxygen desaturation
was greater than with breast feeding, highlighting the importance
of considering safety aspects of any alternatives to bottle feeds.
Use of both cup and paladai has been associated with a tendency
for infants to ’spill’ a large proportion of the feed (Aloysius 2007;
Dowling 2002). However, other studies have not reported prob-
lems associated with cup feeding (Gupta 1999; Lang 1994a).
Cups and similar feeding vessels are easier to clean than bottles and
artificial teats; this fact may be of particular relevance for infection
control in low- and middle-income countries.
For women who wish to breast feed their preterm infant, it is im-
portant to establish the most efficacious and least harmful method
of supplementing breast feeds.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All trials using random or quasi-random participant allocation.
Types of participants
Infants born at less than 37 weeks’ gestation whose mothers had
chosen to breast feed, and who had not received ’sucking’ feeds
by bottle or any alternative feeding device at study entry. At en-
rolment, infants may have been receiving enteral feeds only, par-
enteral feeds only or a combination of parenteral and enteral feeds.
Their enteral milk intake may have been provided via tube (using
expressed breast milk and/or formula) or breast feeds. Tube feeds
could be continuous or intermittent, and tube placement could
be gastric or duodenal.
Types of interventions
• Experimental intervention: complete avoidance of bottles
during the transition to breast feeds. Instead of bottles,
alternative feeding devices were used for complementing or
supplementing breast feeds, including gavage tube, cup, spoon,
dropper, finger feeding, paladai and other.
• Control intervention: breast feeds complemented or
supplemented with bottles during the transition to breast feeds.

 Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Full breast feeding compared with not breast feeding or
partial breast feeding on discharge home and at three months
and six months post discharge
• Any breast feeding (full and partial combined) compared
with not breast feeding on discharge home and at three months
and six months post discharge
Secondary outcomes
• Time (days) to reach full sucking feeds

home
• Length of hospital stay (days)
• Duration (minutes) of supplementary or complementary
feed

volume prescribed (mL)
• Cardiorespiratory stability during and after intervention
(mean heart and respiratory rates; proportions of bradycardic
and apnoeic events during feed; mean oxygenation measured by
oximetry or transcutaneous monitor; proportion of hypoxic
events during feed)
• Episodes of choking/gagging per feed
• Milk aspiration on radiological assessment
• Parent/health professional satisfaction with feeding method
as measured by self report
• Episodes of infection per infant

Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (see the Cochrane Neonatal
Group search strategy for specialized register).
For the review update in 2016, we conducted a comprehensive
search in July 2016 that included the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2) in The Cochrane
Library; MEDLINE via PubMed; Embase; and the Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), using
the following search terms: (cup feed* OR (cup AND feed) OR
cupfeed* OR gavage OR (tube AND feed*) OR spoon OR drop-
per OR (finger AND feed*) OR paladai), plus database-specific
limiters for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and neonates (see
Appendix 1 for the full search strategies for each database). We
applied no language restrictions.
We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and recently
completed trials (clinicaltrials.gov; the World Health Organiza-
tionInternational TrialsRegistryand Platform www.whoint/ictrp/
search/en/ and the ISRCTN Registry).
For the 2008 review, we conducted computerised searches of
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;
2007, Issue 4) in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (1950 to July
week 1 2008); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to July week 1 2008); and Embase
(1980 to 2008 week 28), using medical subject headings (MeSH):
breastfeeding; Milk, human; Lactation; Bottle Feeding; Intuba-
tion, Gastrointestinal. We used the following text words: Neonat$,
Cup, Cup Feed*, Cupfeed*, Gavage, Gavage feed*, Tube feed*,
Spoon, Dropper, Finger Feed*, Palada*. We did not restrict the
search by language.
Searching other resources
We checked the bibliographies of published trials.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review
Group.
Selection of studies
We merged search results from different databases, using reference
management software, and we removed duplicates. One review
author (CC) screened titles and abstracts and removed obviously
irrelevant reports. Three review authors (CC, HS, JG) indepen-
dently reviewed the abstracts of potentially relevant reports. When
uncertainty about inclusion of the study arose, we retrieved the
full text. Review authors (CC, HS, JG) resolved disagreements on
inclusion of studies.
Data extraction and management
Once inclusion of trials was established, two review authors (CC,
HS) independently assessed trial methods; extracted data onto pa-
per forms; assessed trial quality; and discussed and resolved dis-
agreements (CC, HS).
For the review updated in 2016, we requested additional informa-
tion from Garpiel 2012 (only abstract available) and from Yilmaz
2014 (gestational age category used in stratification) but received
noresponse.Forthe 2008versionof thisreview, we requestedaddi-
tional information from Gilks 2004, Kliethermes1999 and Rocha
2002. We received additional information from Kliethermes 1999
(on breast feeding prevalence, apnoeic/bradycardic episodes and
blinding of assessment outcome) and from Gilks 2004 (on exclu-
sions post randomisation, years study was conducted, type of cup
used, days to reach full sucking feeds and milk aspiration).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and
the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodolog-
ical quality of trials (to meet validity criteria). For each trial,
we sought information regarding methods of randomisation and
blinding and reporting of all outcomes for all infants enrolled. We
assessed each criterion as presenting low, high or unclear risk. Two
review authors (CC, HS) separately assessed each study and re-
solved disagreements by discussion. We made explicit judgements
about whether studies were at high risk of bias across six domains
according to the criteria suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
We included these items for appraisal.
• Random sequence generation and allocation concealment,
i.e.
◦ random sequence generation: selection bias (biased
allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a
randomised sequence; and
◦ allocation concealment: selection bias (biased
allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of
allocations before assignment.
• Blinding of participants and personnel: performance bias
due to knowledge of allocated interventions by participants and
personnel during the study.
• Blinding of outcome assessment: detection bias due to
knowledge of allocated interventions by outcome assessors.
• Incomplete outcome data: attrition bias due to quantity,
nature or handling of incomplete outcome data.
• Selective reporting: reporting bias due to selective outcome
reporting.
• Other bias: bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in
the table.
See Appendix 2 for a more detailed description of risk of bias for
each domain.
We used ’Risk of bias’ tables to illustrate risk across trials. We re-
solved disagreements by consensus and, if necessary, by adjudica-
tion with a third review author.
Measures of treatment effect
We analysed treatment effects in individual trials by using Re-
view Manager 5.3. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ra-
tios (RRs), risk difference (RDs) and numbers needed to treat for
an additional beneficial outcome (NNTBs) or numbers needed
to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTHs). We re-
ported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all estimates and used
mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals for out-
comes measured on a continuous scale. We analysed differences in
the number of events for outcomes measured as count data (e.g.
episodes of choking/gagging) by comparing rates of events in the
two groups.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the participating infant in individually
randomised trials.
Dealing with missing data
We requested additional data from trial investigators when data
on important outcomes were missing or were reported unclearly.
For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. If we had con-
cerns regarding the impact of including studies with high levels
of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect, we
explored this through sensitivity analysis.
We analysed all outcomes on an intention-to-treat basis (i.e. we
included in the analyses all participants randomly assigned to each
group). The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the
number randomly assigned minus any participants whose out-
comes were known to be missing.
Assessment of reporting biases
For included trials that were recently performed (and therefore
prospectively registered), we explored possible selective reporting
of study outcomes by comparing primary and secondary outcomes
in the reports versus primary and secondary outcomes proposed
at trial registration, using the websites www.clinicaltrials.gov and
www.controlled-trials.com.
Data synthesis
We conducted meta-analyses using Review Manager software
(RevMan 2014), as supplied by The Cochrane Collaboration. We
used the Mantel-Haenszel method to obtain estimates of typical
risk ratio and risk difference. For analysis of continuous measures,
we used the inverse variance method. For all meta-analyses, we
used a fixed-effect model.
Quality of evidence
We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the
GRADE Handbook (Schünemann 2013), to assess the quality of
evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: breast
feeding extent and duration, length of hospital stay, growth and
episodes of infection.
Two review authors (CC, HS) independently assessed the quality
of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered
evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence
one level for serious (and two levels for very serious) limitations
on the basis of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency
across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates
and presence of publication bias. We used the GRADEpro 2008
Guideline Development Tool to create a ‘Summary of findings’
table to report the quality of the evidence.

 The GRADE approach provides an assessment of the quality of a
body of evidence based on four grades.
• High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to
that of the estimate of effect.
• Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect
estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of
effect but may be substantially different.
• Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The
true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of
effect.
• Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect
estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different
from the estimate of effect.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned subgroup analyses to determine whether safety and
efficacy outcomes were altered by the type of intervention used
and the country in which the study took place (low- and mid-
dle-income countries vs high-income countries; classified accord-
ing to http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications).
When we found moderate to high heterogeneity (I2 > 50%), we
used a random-effects model and investigated potential sources
of the heterogeneity (differences in study quality, participants or
treatment regimens). When heterogeneity was explained by sub-
group analysis, we presented results in this way.

 Included studies
We included seven studies and have provided details of each
of these studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; Kliethermes 1999;
Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) in the
Characteristics of included studies table. Collins 2004 is a primary
study report; a PhD thesis presents additional data related to this
study (i.e. extent of breast feeding, any and full, at three months
and six months post discharge, time to full sucking feeds, weight
gain, milk aspiration and reasons for non-compliance). Simmer
2016 is a primary study report that was first published in ab-
stract form. Studies were undertaken in neonatal units in Aus-
tralia (Collins 2004; Simmer2016), Brazil (Rocha 2002), England
(Gilks 2004; Mosley 2001), Turkey (Yilmaz 2014) and the United
States of America (Kliethermes 1999). Five trials were single-cen-
tre studies (Gilks 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001; Rocha
2002; Simmer 2016), and two were multi-centre studies (Collins
2004 - two centres; Yilmaz 2014 - three centres).
Participants
This review included a total of 1152 infants; sample sizes ranged
from 14 to 522 participants. All studies included preterm infants,
although limits for gestational age and birth weight differed. Four
studies included extremely preterm and very preterm infants (
Collins 2004 < 34 weeks; Rocha 2002 32 to 34 weeks; Gilks 2004
and Simmer 2016 < 35 weeks), and two included moderate to late
preterm infants (Mosley 2001 32 to 37 weeks; Yilmaz 2014 32
to 35 weeks); Kliethermes 1999 used a birth weight criterion of
1000 to 2500 grams.
Five studies stratified infants at randomisation - one by birth
weight (Rocha 2002) and four by gestational age (Collins 2004;
Gilks 2004; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014).
The average gestational age of included infants across all trials was
32 weeks.
Interventions
Those using alternative feeding devices (cup, gavage tube, paladai,
finger feeding, dropper, spoon or other) were classified as the ex-
perimental group, and infants who received bottle feeding were
classified as the control group.
Five studies compared breast feeding with supplementary feeds
given by cup versus breast feeding with supplementary feeds given
by bottle (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002;
Yilmaz 2014). One trial compared breast feeding with supple-
mentary feeds by bottle versus breast feeding with supplementary
feeds by gavage tube alone (Kliethermes 1999). The Simmer 2016
trial used a specially developed feeding system that incorporated a
shut-off valve in the teat, so that milk flowed only when the infant
created a vacuum; collapse of the teat was prevented by a venting
system. Infants controlled the flow of milk by raising the tongue
when sucking stopped; study authors (Simmer 2016) showed that
this action was similar in breast fed term infants (Geddes 2012).
Although this intervention uses a bottle and a teat, the review
authors agreed to include this study in the review, given that the
’novel teat’ causes action that is purportedly similar to the breast
feeding action compared with conventional teats used in all other
studies.
In all studies, neither bottle feeds nor alternative feeding devices
(cup/tube alone/novel teat) were used to replace a breast feed and
were given only when the mother was not available to breast feed,
or if extra milk was thought necessary after a breast feed and in-
vestigators determined that the infant was able to take this orally.
Among the cup feeding studies, four (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004;
Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014) followed the cup feeding recommen-
dations of Lang (Lang 1994a; Lang 1994b). Rocha 2002 used the
protective cap from a bottle, Collins 2004 and Yilmaz 2014 a 60
mL medicine cup and Gilks 2004 an Ameda baby cup. Mosley
2001 did not state the type of cup used and did not describe the
cup feeding procedure. An indwelling nasogastric tube remained
in situ for both experimental and control groups in two studies
in which feeds were given by tube if insufficient milk was taken
during cup or breast feeding, or if the infant was not scheduled for
a sucking feed (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004). It is not stated whether
this occurred for cup feeds in the other studies (Mosley 2001;
Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014).
For breast feeding with supplementary feeds by bottle compared
with breast feeding with supplementary feeds by gavage tube (
Kliethermes 1999), all infants received standard care (including
non-nutritive breast feeding) until written orders for oral feedings
were given. For the control group, all supplementary feeds were
given by bottle, and the indwelling nasogastric tube was removed
as directed by the clinical care team. For the experimental group
(gavage tube), feeds were given by an indwelling 3.5 gauge French
nasogastric tube. The tube was removed during the last 24 to 48
hours of parent ’rooming-in’, at which time a cup or syringe was
used if needed.
Skin-to-skin contact and non-nutritive sucking at the breast
were encouraged for all infants in three studies (Collins 2004;
Kliethermes 1999; Simmer 2016). This was not reported in the
remaining studies (Gilks 2004; Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002; Yilmaz
2014).
Sucking feeds for experimental and control groups were com-
menced and advanced according to individual hospital policy. In
one trial (Rocha 2002), this decision was based on weight (1600
grams). In Collins 2004, sucking feeds began when infants were as-
sessed as mature enough to co-ordinate a suck-swallow-breathe re-
10

 flex. In three studies, sucking feeds occurred at the discretion of the
nurse or midwife (Collins 2004), the neonatologist (Collins 2004;
Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001; Yilmaz 2014) or the neonatal
nurse practitioner (Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001). This infor-
mation was not reported in Gilks 2004 and Simmer 2016.
Non-nutritive sucking with use of a dummy (also known as a paci-
fier) varied among the included studies. Collins 2004 randomised
infants to cup/no dummy, cup/dummy, bottle/no dummy and
bottle/dummy, reporting no statistically significant interaction be-
tween infants randomised to no dummy or cup; therefore, results
from marginal groups (cup vs bottle and dummy vs no dummy)
could be analysed independently. In Kliethermes 1999, a dummy
was available during tube feedings for the experimental group,
and study authors did not report whether a dummy was available
outside feeding times in either group. In Rocha 2002, a dummy
was not used for the experimental (cup) group, and Mosley 2001
reported that six infants were given a dummy. In Simmer 2016,
non-nutritive sucking was encouraged in both groups, and Gilks
2004 and Yilmaz 2014 did not report dummy use.
Outcomes
All outcomes were not reported in each study.
All studies measured breast feeding outcomes (Collins 2004; Gilks
2004; Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002; Simmer
2016; Yilmaz 2014). Six studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004;
Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014)
measured full breast feeding at discharge home from hospital, four
studies (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz
2014) at three months post discharge and three studies (Collins
2004; Kliethermes 1999; Yilmaz 2014) at six months post dis-
charge.
Six studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Rocha
2002; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) measured any breast feed-
ing at discharge home from hospital, five studies (Collins 2004;
Kliethermes 1999; Rocha 2002; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) at
three months post discharge and three studies (Collins 2004;
Kliethermes 1999; Yilmaz 2014) at six months post discharge.
Three studies(Collins 2004; Kliethermes1999; Yilmaz2014)used
the following definition of full breast feeding: No other solids or
liquids were given apart from vitamins, minerals, juice or ritualistic
feedings, given infrequently. Mosley 2001 used the term ’exclusive’
and Simmer 2016 ’fully’ breast feeding but did not define the
terms; however, these investigators reported both breast feeding
andbreastmilkfeeds.Rocha 2002 definedbreastfeedingasfeeding
exclusively or partially directly at the breast. Kliethermes 1999 and
Gilks 2004 considered infants who were receiving supplementary
feeds of expressed breast milk on discharge as partially breast fed,
and Collins 2004 considered them fully breast fed. Two per cent
of women (n = 6) with 2% of infants (n = 7) in Collins 2004
had chosen to feed their infants expressed breast milk by bottle;
researchers randomised three to cup feeds and four to bottle feeds.
At three months and six months post discharge, Collins 2004 used
the term ’all breast feeds’ to indicate that an infant’s milk feeds
were breast feeds only when no other types of milk were given,
and ’partial breast feeds’ to mean that an infant’s milk feeds were a
combinationof breastfeedsandothertypesof milk. The intentwas
to determine the types of milk feeds infants were receiving (breast
or formula), irrespective of whether they were receiving solids.
This does not fit with the conventional definition of full breast
feeding (Labbok 1990), that is, if an infant is on solids and all milk
feeds are breast feeds, the infant is usually classified as ’partially’
breast feeding. The Collins 2008 review did not include data for
’all breast feeds’ in the meta-analyses. Given the small number of
studies reporting this outcome, review authors reconsidered and
have included the data for ’all breast feeds’ in the meta-analysis in
this 2016 update.
Three studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; Simmer 2016) measured
the time taken to reach full sucking feeds. Three studies (Collins
2004; Rocha 2002; Yilmaz2014) reported rate of weight gain, four
(Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014)
length of hospitalisation and two (Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014) sup-
plementary feeding time. No studies reported the volume of sup-
plementary feed taken compared with the volume prescribed.
Two studies reported cardiorespiratory stability. Kliethermes 1999
reported apnoeic or bradycardic episodes, and Rocha 2002 oxygen
saturation associated with mode of feeding. No studies reported
episodes of choking/gagging, and two trials reported milk aspira-
tion (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004). Collins 2004 reported parental
satisfaction, and three studies (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999;
Simmer 2016) reported episodes of infection.
Excluded studies
See Characteristics of excluded studies for details. We excluded:
• Abouelfettoh 2008, Aytekin 2014, De Aquino 2009,
Harding 2014, Lau 2012 and Ronan 2013 because they were not
RCTs;
• Aloysius 2007 and Lopez 2014 because they were
randomised cross-over trials; and
• Kumar 2010 and Marofi 2016 because they did not include
a bottle control group.
One study (Garpiel 2012) is awaiting classification.

 Allocation
Risk of selection bias was low with adequate methods of ran-
dom sequence generation described in six studies (Collins 2004;
Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002; Simmer 2016;
Yilmaz 2014) and not described in Gilks 2004. Allocation con-
cealment was adequate in six studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004;
Kliethermes1999; Mosley 2001; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) and
was unclear in Rocha 2002.
Blinding
Risk of performance and detection bias was high, as blinding of
treatment was not possible in any study. Five studies (Kliethermes
1999; Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) did
not clearly state whether outcome assessment was blinded. Two
studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004) stated that data for outcomes
were collected unblinded. Simmer 2016 was the only study that
described blinding of analyses.
Incomplete outcome data
We judged risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data as low in
six studies (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; Mosley 2001; Rocha 2002;
Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) and high in Kliethermes 1999. Stud-
ies handled protocol violations differently; five studies excluded
the infants from analyses (Gilks 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Mosley
2001; Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014). Proportions of incomplete out-
come data for the primary outcome were as follows: Collins 2004
5%, Gilks 2004 0%. Kliethermes 1999 15%, Mosley 2001 13%,
Rocha 2002 6%, Simmer 2016 3% and Yilmaz 2014 14%.
Collins 2004 reported a high proportion of non-compliance. In
the experimental (cup) group, 85 of 151 (56%) had a bottle in-
troduced, and in the control group, 1 of 152 (0.7%) had a cup
introduced. Infants were analysed in the group to which they were
randomised (Collins 2004).
Selective reporting
We found no evidence of reporting bias.
Other potential sources of bias
We found no evidence of other potential sources of bias.
Effects of interventions

in preterm infants
See Summary of findings for the main comparison. Breast feeding
with supplemental feeds by other than bottle versus breast feeding
with supplemental feeds by bottle.
This review includes seven studies with 1152 infants.
We conducted subgroup analyses to determine whether outcomes
were altered by type of intervention. We incorporated the sub-
groups into the main structure of each figure.
Full breast feeding (Outcomes 1.1 to 1.3)
At discharge home (Analysis 1.1)
Six studies reported this outcome in 1074 infants (Collins 2004;
Gilks 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Mosley 2001; Simmer 2016;
Yilmaz 2014). Three trials (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999;
Yilmaz 2014) as well as the meta-analysis of data from all trials
showed a statistically significantly higher rate of full breast feeding
in the experimental (avoid bottle) group (typical risk ratio (RR)
1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.80; risk difference
(RD) 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.32; number needed to treat for an
additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5, 95% CI 3 to 11). Het-
erogeneity between studies was moderate (I2 = 52%).
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: full breast feeding at
discharge home (Outcomes 1.1.1 to 1.1.3)
The subgroup interaction test was not statistically significantly
different, although the P value = 0.08 indicates that the effect on
breast feeding of a tube alone approach may have a more significant
impact on breast feeding success than a cup feeding approach.
However, only one small study with high risk of bias (Kliethermes
1999) used a tube alone feeding approach.
Four studies with 893 infants (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; Mosley
2001; Yilmaz 2014) compared cup feeds with bottle feeds. The sta-
tistically significant increase in full breast feeding remained (typ-
ical RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.75; RD 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to
0.308; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 10) with low heterogeneity (I2 =
45%). Kliethermes1999 showedasignificantincrease in full breast
feeding (tube alone vs bottle), and Simmer 2016 when comparing
different teats showed no difference in full breast feeding.
Three months post discharge (Analysis 1.2)
Four studies (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Simmer 2016;
Yilmaz 2014) with 986 infants reported this outcome. Two studies
(Kliethermes 1999; Yilmaz 2014) and the meta-analysis showed
a statistically significantly higher rate of full breast feeding in the
experimental (avoid bottle) group (typical RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37
13

 to 1.78; RD 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; NNTB 5, 95% CI 4 to
7). We detected low heterogeneity in this analysis (I2 = 37%).
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: full breast feeding at
three months post discharge (Outcomes 1.2.1 to 1.2.3)
Cup feeding compared with bottle feeding (Collins 2004; Yilmaz
2014) showed a significant increase in full breast feeding (typical
RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.77; RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.27;
NNTB 5, 95% CI 4 to 7) but with moderate heterogeneity (I2
= 61%). Setting, participants and risk of bias differed in the two
cup feeding studies. Collins 2004 was conducted in a high-income
country, included more immature infants (mean gestational age,
30 weeks) and reported low adherence with the intervention and
overall lowriskof bias, whereasYilmaz 2014 includedmore mature
infants (mean gestational age, 33 weeks) and high adherence with
the intervention, was conducted in a high-middle-income country
and had high risk of attrition bias. Kliethermes 1999 reported that
tube alone versus bottle showed increased full breast feeding, and
Simmer 2016 described no differences when different teats were
compared.
Six months post discharge (Analysis 1.3)
Full breast feeding was significantly increased at six months post
discharge in the experimental (avoid bottle) group in both individ-
ual trials and the meta-analysis (887 infants, three studies: Collins
2004; Kliethermes 1999; Yilmaz 2014) (typical RR 1.64, 95% CI
1.14 to 2.36; RD 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; NNTB 7, 95% CI
4 to 14). Moderate heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 52%).
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: full breast feeding at
six months home (Outcomes 1.3.1 to 1.3.3)
Tube alone versus bottle statistically significantly increased full
breast feeding (Kliethermes 1999). The subgroup interaction test
(P = 0.06) indicated that the effect on breast feeding of the tube
alone approach (Kliethermes 1999) may have a more significant
impact on breast feeding success than the cup feeding approach, as
described above. The two cup feeding trials (Collins 2004; Yilmaz
2014) noted an increase in full breast feeding in the cup group
(typical RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.77; RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.07
to 0.19, NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 14) with no heterogeneity (I2=
0%).
Any breast feeding (Outcomes 1.4 to 1.6)
At discharge home (Analysis 1.4)
Data were obtained from six trials including 1138 infants (Collins
2004; Gilks 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Rocha 2002; Simmer 2016;
Yilmaz 2014). Two studies (Kliethermes 1999; Yilmaz 2014) as
well as the meta-analysis showed a statistically significantly higher
rate of any breast feeding on discharge home in the experimental
(avoid bottle) group (typical RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16; RD
0.09, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.13; NNTB 11, 95% CI 8 to 20) with no
heterogeneity detected.
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: any breast feeding at
discharge home (Outcomes 1.4.1 to 1.4.3)
One of the cup feeding studies (Yilmaz 2014) and the meta-anal-
ysis revealed a significant increase in breast feeding (Collins 2004;
Gilks 2004; Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014; 957 infants; typical RR
1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.15; RD .07, 95% CI .03 to .11; NNTB
14. 95% CI 9 to 33, no heterogeneity), as did the tube alone
trial (Kliethermes1999), but Simmer 2016 noted no such increase
upon comparing two different types of teats.
Three months post discharge (Analysis 1.5)
Five studies with 1063 infants (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999;
Rocha 2002; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz 2014) contributed data to
this outcome. Two studies (Kliethermes 1999; Rocha 2002) and
a meta-analysis of data showed a statistically significant increase
in the rate of any breast feeding in the experimental (avoid bottle)
group (typical RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.71; RD 0.14, 95%
CI 0.04 to 0.24; NNTB 7, 95% CI 4 to 25), with moderate
heterogeneity detected (I2 = 73%).
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: any breast feeding at
three months post discharge (Outcomes 1.5.1 to 1.5.3)
Researchers found no clear benefit of cup feeding for any breast
feeding at three months post discharge (883 infants, three trials;
Collins 2004; Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014). Tube alone showed a
statistically significant increase in any breast feeding (Kliethermes
1999) but with no statistically significant differences between
novel and conventional teats (Simmer 2016).
Six months post discharge (Analysis 1.6)
Three studies with 886 infants (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999;
Yilmaz 2014) provided data on this outcome. Two studies
(Kliethermes 1999; Yilmaz 2014) and a meta-analysis showed a
statistically significant increase in the rate of any breast feeding at
six months post discharge in experimental (avoid bottle) groups
(typical RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.41; RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.05
to 0.17; NNTB 9, 95% CI 6 to 20), with moderate heterogeneity
detected (I2 = 50%).

 Subgroup analyses by intervention type: any breast feeding at
three months post discharge (Outcomes 1.6.1 to 1.6.3)
Cup feeding in Collins 2004 and Yilmaz 2014 (803 infants) re-
sulted in a statistically significant increase in any breast feeding at
six months post discharge (typical RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36;
RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.16; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 22) with
no heterogeneity. Tube alone also showed a statistically significant
increase in any breast feeding (Kliethermes 1999). The subgroup
interaction test P value = 0.06 in Kliethermes 1999 indicated that
the effect on breast feeding of a tube alone approach may have
a more significant impact on breast feeding success than a cup
feeding approach. However, only one small study with high risk
of bias used a tube alone approach.
Time (days) to reach full sucking feeds (Outcome 1.7)
Four studies measured this outcome (Analysis 1.7) in 513 infants
(Collins 2004; Gilks2004; Kliethermes1999; Simmer2016). Two
studies (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999) showed a significant
increase in days to reach full sucking feeds in the experimental
(avoid bottle) group. Kliethermes 1999 did not report standard
deviations, sotheirdatacouldnotbe included inthe meta-analysis;
however, the increase (7.5 days) was of the same magnitude as
reported in Collins 2004 (10.5 days). Meta-analysis (Collins 2004;
Gilks 2004; Simmer 2016) revealed no clear effect on days to
taken to reach full sucking feeds in the experimental (avoid bottle)
group.
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: time (days) to reach
full sucking feeds (Outcomes 1.7.1, 1.7.2)
Neither the two cup feeding trials (Collins 2004; Gilks 2004; 332
infants) nor the novel teat feeding trial (Simmer 2016) showed
a clear increase or reduction in days to reach full sucking feeds.
The tube alone study (Kliethermes 1999) reported a significant
increase in days to reach full sucking feeds.
Weight gain (g/kg/d or g/d) (Outcome 1.8)
Three studies with 893 infants (all cup) reported no statistically
significant differences in weight gain (g/kg/d; Analysis 1.8) when
measured from birth to discharge home (Collins 2004), or one
weekafteroral feedswere commenced(Rocha2002; Yilmaz2014).
A meta-analysis was not possible because different units of mea-
surement were used. Simmer 2016 reported that infants in the ex-
perimental (novel teat) group were statistically significantly lighter
on discharge home (mean difference (MD) -186 grams, 95% CI
-317 to -56).
Length of hospital stay, days (Outcome 1.9)
We obtained data from four studies with 1004 infants (Analysis
1.9) (Collins 2004; Kliethermes 1999; Simmer 2016; Yilmaz
2014). Collins 2004 showed a statistically significant increase in
length of hospital stay of 10 days with the experimental (cup)
group, but meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant differ-
ence (MD 2.25, 95% CI -3.36 to 7.86 days). Moderate hetero-
geneity was present in this analysis (I2 = 73%).
Subgroup analyses by intervention type: length of hospital
stay (days) (Outcomes 1.9.1 to 1.9.3)
The two cup feeding trials with 823 infants (Collins 2004; Yilmaz
2014) showed no clear difference in length of hospital stay (MD
4.45, 95%CI-5.57to14.48days). High heterogeneitywaspresent
(I2 = 90%). The overall length of stay differed between these stud-
ies owing to differences in the maturity of included infants. Collins
2004 suggested that increased length of stay may have been related
to problems with staff and acceptance by parents of cup feeding,
with some infants less satisfied and more difficult to feed by cup
as they matured, resulting in feeding by tube and delayed onset of
all sucking feeds - a requirement for discharge home. Kliethermes
1999 (tube alone) and Simmer 2016 (novel teat) also showed no
statistically significant differences in length of hospital stay.
Duration (minutes) of supplementary feed (Outcome
1.10)
Two studies with 600 infants (Rocha 2002; Yilmaz 2014; both
cup intervention) measured duration of supplementary feeds and
showed no significant differences in time taken to cup feed ver-
sus time taken to bottle feed (MD -0.42, 95% CI -1.96 to 1.12
minutes). Moderate heterogeneity was present in this analysis (I
2 = 60%) (Analysis 1.10) and is not explained by the maturity of
included infants, as infants in both studies were at a mean of 33
weeks’ gestation.
Episodes of infection (Outcome 1.11)
Three studies with 500 infants reported infection (Analysis 1.11):
Collins 2004 reported necrotising enterocolitis; Kliethermes 1999
reported infection not defined; and Simmer 2016 reported late-
onsetsepsis. All participantswere fromhigh-income countries, and
neither trials nor the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant
difference in episodes of infection (typical RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.35
to 1.42). No heterogeneity was detected.
Cardiorespiratory stability
One trial (Kliethermes 1999) reported the total number of
episodes of apnoea and bradycardia per infant. Researchers de-
scribed significantly fewer apnoeic and bradycardic incidents for
the experimental (tube alone) group (mean 127, SD not reported)
compared with the control (bottle) group (mean 136, SD not re-
ported; P = 0.0006). However, the breast feeding plus bottle group
had significantly more episodes requiring stimulation (mean 32.7
15

 episodes, SD not reported vs mean 23.3 episodes, SD not re-
ported; P = 0.0001). Investigators measured apnoeic and brady-
cardic episodes over the entire hospital stay - not just episodes as-
sociated with feeding. Rocha 2002 reported mean oxygen satura-
tion during feeds and showed no statistically significant difference
in the mean of the lowest oxygen saturation during feeds (cup
mean 90.8, SD 4.8, range 75 to 99; bottle mean 87.7, SD 7.6,
range 68 to 97). Rocha 2002 also reported oxygen desaturation
during feeds and showed no difference in desaturation episodes of
less than 90% with cup feeds (18/44, 40.9%) compared with the
bottle group (19/34, 55.9%). Researchers reported a statistically
significant difference in the proportion of desaturation episodes
less than 85%, with fewer occurring in cup groups (6/44, 13.6%)
than in bottle groups (12/34, 35.3%; P = 0.02).
Milk aspiration on radiological assessment
The three studies that reported this outcome (Collins 2004; Gilks
2004; Yilmaz 2014) described no episodes of milk aspiration.
Satisfaction with feeding method
One study included views of parents on the method of feeding
(Collins 2004) and noted a high rate of non-compliance, with
56%of infantsinthe intervention(breastfeedingwith supplemen-
tal feeds by cup) group (n = 85/151) having a bottle introduced.
Compliance differed between recruiting hospitals; the hospital at
which cup feeding was introduced specifically for this study had a
higher rate of compliance than the other recruiting hospital, where
cup feeding had been practised for three years before the study be-
gan. Researchers collected data on reasons for the introduction of a
bottle from the medical records or after discussion with attending
nurses or midwives. Reasons for introducing a bottle were avail-
able for 74% (n = 63) of the 85 infants randomised to cup feeds
who had a bottle introduced. In 65% (n = 41) of cases, the reason
given for introduction of a bottle was that it was introduced at the
request of the mother, and the staff initiated the bottle in 29% (n
= 18) of cases. In 10% (n = 6) of cases, researchers introduced a
bottle because the baby was not satisfied with cup feeds or would
not settle down. One infant randomised to the bottle group had a
cup introduced because of transfer to a peripheral hospital, where
cup feeding was routinely done.
The three month post discharge questionnaire included a question
to the mother on reasons for introduction of a bottle. Reasons
for introducing a bottle were available for 91% (n = 77) of the
85 infants randomised to cup feeds who had a bottle introduced.
Women could select from a list of options, and additional space
was provided for any other comments. A total of 44% (n = 34) in-
dicated that the decision to introduce a bottle was theirs, and 33%
(n = 25) were advised by the nurse or midwife (some responded
yes to both of these statements). In all, 26% (n = 20) had problems
with cup feeding including inability of the infant to do it, frequent
spills, dissatisfaction with cup feeds and unacceptably long feeding
times. Ten (13%) of the respondents did not like cup feeds and
changed feeding method because of this. Nine (12%) respondents
said that the staff refused to cup feed their infant. Collins 2004
reported that some infants became less satisfied with cup feeds and
more difficult to feed by this method as they neared discharge,
generally during the last week of their hospital stay. Because of
this, if the mother could not be present to breast feed, the infant
would be tube fed. The criterion for discharge home was that the
infant had to be on full sucking feeds. This may have contributed
to increased length of stay in this study. However, the study author
cautions that reliable data on this point were not collected (Collins
2004).
Outcomes not reported
No studies reported the volume of supplementary feed taken com-
pared with the volume prescribed, nor did they describe episodes
of choking or gagging.
Subgroup analysis: trials conducted in low- and
middle-income countries
Two trials were conducted in upper-middle-income countries:
Rocha 2002 in Brazil and Yilmaz 2014 in Turkey. Meta-analyses
were limited and showed no substantial differences from the meta-
analysis of all trials together (Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2; Analysis
1.3; Analysis 1.4; Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.8; Analysis
1.9; Analysis 1.10). These studies did not report infection rates.

Summary of main results
The strategy of avoiding bottles while an infant breast feeds is be-
ing established in preterm infants, resulting in statistically signifi-
cant increases in the extent and duration of breast feeding. Studies
included in this review compared cup feeding with a tube alone
approach or a novel teat versus bottle feeding with a conventional
teat. Across all time points (discharge home, three months and six
months post discharge), both a cup feeding strategy and a tube
alone strategy increased breast feeding success. We included the
novel teat study in this review, as the design of the teat, in which
a vacuum is created, attempted to mimic the sucking action re-
quired for breast feeding, thereby potentially supporting breast
feeding success when compared with a conventional teat. Investi-
gators found no differences in breast feeding outcomes with the
novel teat, rather the cup and tube alone studies reported an in-
crease in breast feeding. Meta-analysis of data from trials that in-
cluded length of stay, weight gain and infection showed no clear

 evidence of benefit or harm. Limited evidence from the two trials
that assessed cardiorespiratory stability suggests improved stability
with avoidance of bottles.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The trials reviewed provide no information on the volume of feed
consumed compared with the volume prescribed nor on episodes
of choking/gagging per feed. We found limited information on
cardiorespiratory stability and parent and health professional sat-
isfaction with the feeding method. No studies were conducted
in low-income countries, and two were completed in middle-in-
come countries. No reports describe infants dissatisfied with tube
or cup, except Collins 2004, in which adherence with cup feeding
was poor. In contrast, cup feeding had not previously been used
in Yilmaz 2014, and staff acceptance was high, with high adher-
ence to the intervention. Both of the largest studies were cup feed-
ing studies, but they were conducted in different populations and
settings. Collins 2004 was conducted in a high-income country
in very and extremely preterm infants, whereas Yilmaz 2014 in-
cluded moderate to late preterm infants in a high-middle-income
country. Lang 1997 suggested that as preterm infants mature, they
may be able to bottle feed with no interference with breast feeds,
but she cautions that the introduction of a bottle should occur
only when breast feeding is well established. Such a strategy might
be more acceptable to staff and parents, but no randomised con-
trolled trials have investigated this approach.
Quality of the evidence
We included in this review seven studies with 1152 infants. Blind-
ing was not possible in any of the included studies and there-
fore was subject to caregiver influence. We graded the level of evi-
dence for full breast feeding as low or moderate, and for any breast
feeding as moderate or very low (Summary of findings for the
main comparison). We graded the level of evidence for episodes
of infection and length of hospital stay as moderate and very low
(Summary of findings for the main comparison). We downgraded
outcomes because of attrition and moderate to high heterogeneity.
The direction of effects of all included trials was consistent (favour-
ing avoiding bottles) for breast feeding outcomes, but the mag-
nitude of effects in Kliethermes 1999 was inconsistent with that
in the other studies. The most likely reason for this heterogeneity
was the difference in the intervention provided or the poorer qual-
ity of the study. Kliethermes 1999 used supplemental feeding by
tube, and Simmer 2016 a novel teat, whereas the remaining trials
used supplemental feeds by cup. Heterogeneity was considerable
between cup feeding studies that reported length of stay (Collins
2004; Yilmaz 2014), with length of stay increased by a mean of
10 days in Collins 2004, and no difference was reported in Yilmaz
2014.
Potential biases in the review process
Assessment of risk of bias involves subjective judgements. Review
authors therefore independently assessed studies and resolved dis-
agreements through discussion (Higgins 2011). We attempted to
identify all relevant studies by screening the reference lists of in-
cluded trials and related reviews.

Implications for practice
We found evidence of improved breast feeding rates when breast
feeds are supplemented with cup feeds, with higher rates of full and
any breast feeding at discharge and at six months post discharge,
and higher rates of any (but not full) breast feeding at three months
post discharge. We found insufficient evidence on which to base
recommendationsforsupplementingbreastfeedswith atube alone
strategy, and we found evidence suggesting that a novel teat does
not clearly confer breast feeding benefit.
Implications for research
The heterogeneity of the included studies reveals the need for well-
conducted studies of both cup feeding and a tube alone strategy.
Such studies should evaluate length of hospital stay, weight gain,
breast feeding prevalence on discharge home and at three months
and six months post discharge and infection episodes, as well as
infant, parent and staff satisfaction with the feeding method.

Collins 2004
Methods
Randomised controlled trial, stratified by gestational age < 28 weeks and 28 to < 34
weeks and by study centre. Study duration - 3 years, 1996 to 1999
Participants
Two Australian Neonatal Intensive Care Units
Inclusion criteria: gestational age < 34 weeks (experimental: mean 29.4 weeks, SD 2.
6, range 23 to 33; control: mean 30.0 weeks, SD 2.5, range 24 to 33), mother wishes
to breast feed, infant had not been fed by cup or bottle, no congenital abnormality
precluding sucking feeds, dummy use ≤ 48 hours
Sample size: 319 randomised (161 experimental/cup, 158 control/bottle). 303 included
in analysis (151 experimental/cup, 152 control/bottle)
Interventions
Randomised to cup/no dummy, cup/dummy, bottle/no dummy, bottle/dummy
Experimental: supplementary feeds given by cup according to Lang 1994b recommen-
dations; 60 mL medicine cup used
Control: supplementary feeds given by bottle
Both groups: Infants breast fed when mother was present; cup/bottle was used in addition
to nasogastric tube
Outcomes
Breast feeding prevalence any and full at discharge, and ’all’ and any at 3 and 6 months;
days to all sucking feeds; length of hospitalisation; weight gain from birth to discharge
home; necrotising enterocolitis
Notes
Initial analyses showed no clinically important nor significant interaction between use
of cups and dummies; therefore, additional comparisons were performed on marginal
groups with cup vs bottle
High proportion of non-compliance: experimental group: 85/151 (46%) had a bottle
introduced; control group: 1/152 (0.7%) had a cup introduced. Participants were anal-
ysed in the groups to which they were randomised regardless of the intervention they
actually received

Methods
Randomised controlled trial, stratified by 25 to 29 weeks’ and 30 to 33 weeks’ gestational
age. Twins randomised to same group. Conducted from 1 August 2011 to 30 June 2012
Participants
Single centre, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Australia
Inclusion criteria: gestational age 25 to 34 weeks (experimental: 30.1, SD 2.7 weeks,
birth weight 1310, SD 422 g; control: 30.1, SD 2.6 weeks, birth weight 1430, SD 507
g); mother intended to breast feed; required 75% enteral feeds by intragastric tube with
remainder provided by parental nutrition
Exclusion criteria: congenital anomalies, grade 4 intracerebral haemorrhage, periventric-
ular leukomalacia, oral anomalies (e.g. ankyloglossia, cleft palate)
Sample size: 100 randomised (54 experimental/novel teat, 46 control/bottle with con-
ventional teat), 97 included in analysis (51 experimental/novel teat, 46 control/bottle
with conventional teat)
Interventions
Bottles were offered only if a bottle feed was scheduled, and duration of feed was limited
to 30 minutes. Non-nutritive sucking encouraged up to 33 weeks before suck feeds, after
which increasing suck feeds replaced non-nutritive sucking
Experimental: a feeding system (Medela AG, Baar, Switzerland) that combined strategies
known to improve oral feeding skills: development of vacuum and self paced feeding. A
shut-off valve incorporated in the system to ensure that milk flowed only when infant
created a vacuum; venting prevented collapse of the teat. Two different threshold levels
for the valve of -10, SD 5 mmHg and -30, SD 15 mmHg
Control: conventional teat that allowed milk flow with gravity and compression of the
teat (Grow, Growbaby, Icon Health, Victoria, Australia, or Peristaltic Narrow Neck Slow
Flow, Pigeon, Seoul, South Korea)
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: time to first and full suck feeds, length of hospital stay, breast feeding
(full and any) at discharge
Secondary outcomes: breast feeding rates (full and any) at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post
discharge, late-onset sepsis
Notes
The manufacturer of the feeding system (Medela AG, Baar, Switzerland) provides an
unrestricted research grant from which the salaries of 2 authors were paid; the research
nurse was partially funded by the manufacturer

Randomised cross-over study. Infants fed by paladai or bottle on consecutive feeds. The aim of the study was
to assess amount of spillage, volume consumed, time taken and physiological stability during both a cup feed
and a bottle feed
Aytekin 2014
Not randomised. Aim was to determine effects of spoon feeding compared with bottle feeding on breast feeding
success. Conducted in 2 neonatal intensive care units - 1 that used bottle feeds and 1 that used spoon feeds
De Aquino 2009
Not randomised, a retrospective study
Harding 2014
Involves non-nutritive sucking only, not related to mode of sucking feeds nor to breast feeding outcomes
Kumar 2010
Randomised groups do not include a bottle group; nasogastric tube alone compared with spoon feeding
Lau 2012
Involves sucking and swallowing exercises, not related to mode of sucking feeds nor to breast feeding outcomes
Lopez 2014
Randomised cross-over trial. Assessed swallowing and spilling when fed by cup and by bottle during first sucking
feed only; did not include breast feeding outcomes
Marofi 2016
Randomised groups do not include a bottle group, have compared feeding by cup with feeding by paladay
(paladai)

Garpiel 2012
Methods
Four-group, parallel, randomised controlled trial
Participants
132 infants born at 26 to 36 weeks’ gestation
Interventions
Randomised to 1 of 4 groups: (1) nasogastric tube with pacifier, (2) bottle with preterm teat, (3) cup feeding with
30 mL medicine cup, (4) Haberman infant feeder (Medela)
Outcomes
Primary outcome: breast feeding ability at discharge and tolerance to supplementary method of feeding
Secondary outcomes: breast feeding rate at discharge, at 2 and 4 weeks post discharge; weight gain; hospital length
of stay; frequency of skin-to-skin contact; maternal satisfaction with the feeding method

 Appendix 2. Risk of bias tool
1. Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment)
For each included trial, we planned to categorise the risk of selection bias as:
1a. Random sequence generation
1. Low risk: Investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process, such as referring to a random number
table, using a computer random number generator, tossing a coin, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing lots or
conducting minimisation.
2. High risk: Investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process (sequence generated by odd or
even date of birth, sequence generated by some rule based on date or day of admission, sequence generated by some rule based on
hospital or clinic record number, allocation by judgement of the clinician, allocation by preference of the participant, allocation based
on results of a laboratory test or a series of tests or allocation by availability of the intervention).
3. Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.
1b. Allocation concealment
For each included trial, we planned to categorise the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:
1. Low risk: Participant and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an
equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled
randomisation), sequentially numbered drug containers or identical appearance or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.
2. High risk: Participant and investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection
bias, such as allocation based on open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers), unsealed or non-opaque envelopes,
alternation or rotation, date of birth or case record number.
3. Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.
2. Blinding (performance bias)
For each included trial, we planned to categorise the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received.
1. Low risk: no blinding or incomplete blinding, but review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured; unlikely that blinding could have been broken.
2. High risk: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of key
trial participants and personnel attempted, but likely that blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to be influenced
by lack of blinding.
3. Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.
3. Blinding (detection bias)
For each included trial, we planned to categorise the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention
a participant received.
1. Low risk: no blinding or incomplete blinding, but review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured; unlikely that blinding could have been broken.
2. High risk: no blinding of outcome assessment, but review authors judge that outcome measurement is not likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of outcome assessment; likely that the blinding could have been broken, and outcome
measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
3. Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.

 4. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
For each included trial and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from
the analysis.
1. Low risk:
i) No missing outcome data.
ii) Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be
introducing bias).
iii) Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.
iv) For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is not enough to
have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.
v) For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing
outcomes is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.
vi) Missing data have been imputed by appropriate methods.
2. High risk:
i) Reasons for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing
data across intervention groups.
ii) For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is enough to
induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.
iii) For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing
outcomes is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.
iv) “As-treated” analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization.
v) Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.
3. Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided.
5. Selective reporting (reporting bias)
For each included trial, we planned to describe how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We
planned to access all protocols of the included trials through a search of clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com;
and who.int/ictrp) and by direct contact with trial authors.
We planned to assess the methods as follows.
• Low risk: The study protocol is available, and all of the trial’s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes of interest in the
review have been reported in the prespecified way; or the study protocol is not available, but it is clear that published reports include
all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).
• High risk: Not all of the trial’s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes are reported
using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or
more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report
fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a trial.
• Unclear risk: No or unclear information is provided (the study protocol is not available).
6. Other potential sources of bias (other bias)
For each included trial, we planned to describe any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether
a potential source of bias is related to the specific study design used).
We planned to assess whether each trial was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as follows.
1. Low risk: The trial appears to be free of other sources of bias.
2. High risk: The trial has at least one important risk of bias (e.g. the trial had a potential source of bias related to the specific study
design used or has been claimed to have been fraudulent or had some other problem).
3. Unclear risk: Risk of bias may be present, but information is insufficient for assessment of whether an important risk of bias
exists, or rationale or evidence is insufficient to suggest that an identified problem will introduce bias.
