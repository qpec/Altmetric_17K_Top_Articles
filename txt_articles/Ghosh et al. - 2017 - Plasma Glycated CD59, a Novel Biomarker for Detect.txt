 Plasma Glycated CD59, a Novel
Biomarker for Detection of
Pregnancy-Induced Glucose
Intolerance
Diabetes Care 2017;40:981–984 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-2598
OBJECTIVE
Plasma glycated CD59 (pGCD59) is an emerging biomarker in diabetes. We assessed
whether pGCD59 could predict the following: the results of the glucose challenge test
(GCT) for screening of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (primary analysis); and the
diagnosis of GDM and prevalence of large for gestational age (LGA) newborns (sec-
ondary analyses).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Case-control studyof1,000plasmasamplesfromwomen receivingstandard prenatal
care, 500 women having a normal GCT (control subjects) and 500 women with a
failed GCT and a subsequent oral glucose tolerance test (case patients).
RESULTS
Compared with control subjects, the median (interquartile range) pGCD59 value
was 8.5-fold higher in case patients and 10-fold higher in GDM patients, as follows:
control subjects 0.33 (0.19); case patients 2.79 (1.4); GDM patients 3.23 (1.43)
(P < 0.001); area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92. LGA preva-
lence was 4.3% in the lowest quartile and 13.5% in the highest quartile of pGCD59.
CONCLUSIONS
One pGCD59 measurement during weeks 24–28 identifies pregnancy-induced glucose
intolerance with high sensitivity and specificity and can potentially identify the risk
for LGA.
Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with an oral glucose challenge test
(GCT) is a standard of care for all nondiabetic pregnant women (1,2) because the
adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with GDM can be mitigated with appropriate
therapy (3,4). Screening (GCT) and diagnostic oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are
time consumingand uncomfortable, and havepoorreproducibility (5).Other tests such
as those for measurement of HbA1c or fructosamine are not routinely conducted during
prenatal care because of their low sensitivity and specificity in identifying women who
are at risk for GDM (6,7).
The complement system and its regulators reportedly play a role in the pathogenesis
of diabetes complications (8). In diabetes, nonenzymatic glycation inactivates the com-
plement inhibitor CD59, forming glycated CD59 (GCD59) (9). Using a sensitive and
specific ELISA for GCD59 in blood, we have shown that plasma GCD59 (pGCD59) levels
are significantly higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes and independently predict
the response to the OGTT (10).

NOVEL COMMUNICATIONS IN DIABETES
 Our primary objective was to assess
the accuracy of pGCD59 in predicting
the results of the GCT. As secondary aims,
we assessed the accuracy of pGCD59
in predicting the diagnosis of GDM by
OGTT and explored the association of
pGCD59 with the prevalence of large
for gestational age (LGA) newborns at
delivery.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We performed a case-control study mea-
suring pGCD59 in 1,000 samples from
women undergoing routine two-step
GDM screening and diagnosis at Brigham
and Women’s Hospital (BWH; 2012–
2014). Two sets of 500 samples each
were collected randomly from women
who either passed the 50-g GCT and
therefore did not undergo a 3-h OGTT
(control subjects) or failed the GCT and
therefore underwent a standard-of-care
100-g, 3-h OGTT (case patients) at BWH.
The gestational week at the time of sam-
ple collection was the same for control
subjects and case patients (26.5 6 3.3
and 26 6 1.8, respectively). Samples for
pGCD59 measurement were separated
from the same tubes used to measure
plasma glucose and were stored (280°C)
by Partners HealthCare Crimson Bio-
repository Core (10), a clinical investiga-
tion facility that anonymously collects
discarded materials from the clinical lab-
oratories of Partners HealthCare Hospi-
tals. Medical information was retrieved
from electronic records before samples
were deidentified; only coded samples
were delivered for pGCD59 measure-
ment. pGCD59 was measured using the
specific ELISA described in the study by
Ghosh et al. (11); test operators were
blind to the women’s glucose status.
The interassay coefficient of variation
was <10.0%. The Partners HealthCare In-
stitutional Review Board approved this
study (Protocol 2011P002254/BWH). We
followed the Standards for Reporting of
Diagnostic Accuracy guidelines for study
design and reporting.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were described us-
ing medians and interquartile ranges for
continuous variables and count propor-
tions for categorical variables. The sensi-
tivity and specificity of pGCD59 to predict
the results of the GCT were assessed using
nonparametric estimates of the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves and
respective area under the ROC curve
(AUROC) (12). Positive and negative pre-
dictive values (PPV and NPV) and positive
likelihoodratio (LR+) were calculated as in
(13). Following World Health Organiza-
tion recommendations, LGA was defined
as $90th percentile birth weight ad-
justed for gestational age at delivery and
determined from the latest sex-specific
reference curves derived from a large
sample that reflects the ethnic distribu-
tion of the U.S. population (14). Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata
software version 13.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX).
RESULTS
Among the 500 case patients, 127 met
Carpenter and Coustan (C&C) criteria for
GDM (15). Supplementary Table 1 sum-
marizes maternal and infant characteristics;
the ethnic/racial composition of the study
subjects was comparable to that of the U.S.
population (14). Median pGCD59 levels
were as follows: 8.5-fold higher in the
500 case patients than in the 500 control

computed and adjusted for maternal age, BMI, race/ethnicity, multiplicity, and gestational age at
GCD59 determination and history of diabetes. AUROCs were derived using the DeLong et al. (20)
nonparametric tied corrected estimator, and the percentile values of the case patient observations
with respect to the control distribution were used to derive the tied corrected estimator (20). Under
nonparametric estimation, SEs and derived AUROCs and 95% CIs were estimated using cross-
validation and bootstrapping procedures with 1,000 replications. Dashed lines, ROC curves adjusted
for maternal age, race/ethnicity, BMI, gestation week at pGCD59 determination, and a history of
diabetes (n = 1,000); insets, adjusted AUC, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% CI; solid lines, un-
adjusted ROC curves.

 subjects and 10-fold higher in the 127 case
patients in whom GDM was diagnosed by
3-h OGTT (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1,
and Supplementary Table 2). The proba-
bility density function (Fig. 1A and B) and
AUROCs (Fig. 1C and D) show that
pGCD59 independently discriminated
case patients from control subjects with
high sensitivity and specificity, even after
adjustment for covariates such as ma-
ternal age, BMI, race/ethnicity, multi-
plicity, gestational age, and history of
diabetes (adjusted AUROC control sub-
jects vs. case patients 0.92 [95% CI 0.88,
0.93]; adjusted AUROC control subjects vs.
GDM 0.92 [95% CI 0.87, 0.96]). Positive and
negative predictive values for the overall
distribution of GCD59 values to identify
case patients were 99.3% (95% CI 97.9,
99.8) and 87.5% (95% CI 84.5, 90.1); and
99.1% (95% CI 94.9, 99.9) and 95.6%
(95% CI 93.8, 97.4) to identify women with
GDM. Women with pGCD59 values $6th
decile had a likelihood of having a failed
GCT that was eightfold higher than for
those women with pGCD59 values ,6th
decile (positive likelihood ratio 7.97)
(Supplementary Table 3).
Among the 852 singletons who had
recorded birth weight and sex, 86
(10%) were identified as LGA, 28 of which
were born to control subjects and 58
of which were born to case patients
(Supplementary Table 1). Higher mater-
nal pGCD59 level was associated with
a higher prevalence of LGA, which was
4.3% (9 of 207 women) in the lowest
quartile of pGCD59 and was 13.5%
(29 of 214 women) in the highest quar-
tile of pGCD59 (x2 test, P , 0.0001)
(Supplementary Fig. 2). This result was
not affected by adjustment for maternal
age, race/ethnicity, and BMI. Notably,
45 of 58 LGA infants (78%) in the case
population were born to mothers who
did not meet C&COGTTthresholdcriteria
for GDM but had median pGCD59 values
that were sevenfold higher than those for
control subjects (Supplementary Table 4).
CONCLUSIONS
This study explored the clinical utility of
pGCD59 to screen/diagnose GDM. One
maternal pGCD59 measurement at a
mean gestational week ;26 predicted
the results ofthe GCT with high sensitivity
and specificity and independently of co-
variates such as age, BMI, race/ethnicity,
multiplicity, gestational age, and history
of diabetes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Fig. 1). Median pGCD59 values were
progressively higher across the cate-
gories of maternal glucose tolerance
(Supplementary Table 2). These find-
ings indicate that pGCD59 potentially
represents a convenient and effective
alternative to the cumbersome glucose
challenge methods currently used to
screen/diagnose GDM.
Glucose tolerance tests fail to recognize
the continuous association between mater-
nalhyperglycemiaandabnormalpregnancy
outcomes and exclude milder forms of glu-
cose intolerance that may still impart peri-
natal risk (16,17). The progressively higher
pGCD59 levels observed across the GCT-
OGTT categories (Supplementary Table 2)
suggest that pGCD59 may reflect the
continuum of pregnancy-induced glucose
intolerance described by the seminal Hy-
perglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Out-
come (HAPO) study (16).
pGCD59 levels at gestational week ;26
were associated with a higher prevalence
of LGA at birth. Among case patients, 22%
of LGA newborns were born to women in
whom GDMwas diagnosed, whereas 78%
of LGA newborns were born to women
who failed the GCT but did not meet the
C&C criteria for GDM. This likely reflects
the effect of treatment on women who
have received a formal diagnosis of GDM
and is consistent with conclusions of the
HAPO and other studies showing that
women in an intermediate category be-
tween “normal” and “abnormal” glucose
tolerance are at higher risk of abnormal
pregnancyoutcomes(18). Currently, there
are no guidelines for the management of
women in the intermediate category,
and, therefore, their management is the
same as that for women with a normal
GCT result. The fact that the 45 case pa-
tients who did not meet C&C criteria for
GDM but delivered LGA newborns had
median pGCD59 levels that were seven-
fold higher than those for control sub-
jects provides additional evidence for
the potential clinical utility of pGCD59
for screening for/diagnosis of GDM (16).
The limitations of the study are as fol-
lows: 1) the study was observational; 2)
clinical and demographic characteristics
were limited to those available in medical
records; 3) we could not adjust for the
time of day when the GCT was performed
since all testing was performed per rou-
tine clinical care (19); and 4) the study
was not aimed at establishing a clini-
cally useful cutoff value or assessing
how pGCD59 measures might influence
clinical care in real time or the impact of
treatment on the prevalence of LGA.
Insummary,this is the first study show-
ing that a single measurement of pGCD59
at gestational week ;26 represents a
simplified method for identifying women
who would have failed a GCT and are at
higher risk of GDM and possibly of having
anLGAnewborn.ThevalidationofpGCD59
as a biomarker for the detection of
pregnancy-induced glucose intolerance
and determination of clinically useful cut-
off values will require multicenter studies
and “consensus” expert committees that
will take into account relative risks, cost/
benefits, and other individual and public
health considerations, as has been the
norm with currently used methodologies
for the screening and diagnosis of GDM.
Future studies should also assess the fol-
lowing: 1) whether pGCD59 similarly clas-
sifies pregnant women with normal or
abnormal glucose tolerance as defined
by the 2-h, 75-g OGTT recommended by
the International Association of the Dia-
betes and Pregnancy Study Groups; 2)
whether pGCD59 is a predictor of adverse
outcomes in pregnant women in the in-
termediate category of glucose tolerance
who might benefit from treatment; and
3) whether pGCD59 detects glucose intol-
erance earlier in pregnancy than current
practice, prompting earlier interventions
that may mitigate further the risks asso-
ciated with maternal hyperglycemia.
