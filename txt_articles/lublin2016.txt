Summary
Background No treatments have been approved for primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod, an oral sphingosine 
1-phosphate receptor modulator, is eff
 ective in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, but has not been assessed in primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis. We assessed the safety and effi
  cacy of fi
 ngolimod in patients with primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis.
Methods In INFORMS, a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study, patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis recruited across 148 centres in 18 countries were randomly allocated (1:1) with computer-
generated blocks to receive oral fi
 ngolimod or placebo for at least 36 months and a maximum of 5 years. Patients were 
initially assigned to fi
 ngolimod 1·25 mg per day or placebo (cohort 1); however, after a protocol amendment on Nov 19, 
2009, patients were switched in a masked manner to fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg, whereas those on placebo continued on 
matching placebo. From then onwards, patients were assigned to receive fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg/day or placebo (cohort 2). 
Key inclusion criteria were age 25–65 years, clinical diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis, 1 year or more of 
disease progression, and two of the following criteria: positive brain MRI; positive spinal cord MRI; or positive 
cerebrospinal fl
 uid. Additional eligibility criteria included disease duration of 2–10 years and objective evidence of 
disability progression in the previous 2 years. Patients and study investigators were masked to group assignment. We 
used a novel primary composite endpoint based on change from baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), 
25’ Timed-Walk Test, or Nine-Hole Peg Test to assess time to 3-month confi
 rmed disability progression in study 
participants treated for at least 3 years. All randomised patients took at least one dose of study drug. The primary effi
  cacy 
analysis included all patients in cohort 2 and those assigned to placebo in cohort 1. The safety analysis included all patients 
in cohorts 1 and 2. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00731692. The study is now closed.
Findings 970 patients were randomly assigned between Sept 3, 2008, and Aug 30, 2011 (147 to fi
 ngolimod 1·25 mg and 
133 to placebo in cohort 1; 336 to fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg and 354 to placebo in cohort 2). The effi
  cacy analysis set (n=823) 
consisted of 336 patients randomly allocated to fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg and 487 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were 
similar across groups and representative of a primary progressive multiple sclerosis population (48% women, mean 
age 48·5 years [SD 8·4], mean EDSS 4·67 [SD 1·03], 87% free of gadolinium-enhancing lesions). By end of study, 
3-month confi
 rmed disability progression had occurred in 232 and 338 patients in the fi
 ngolimod and placebo groups, 
respectively, resulting in Kaplan-Meier estimates of 77·2% (95% CI 71·87–82·51) of patients in the fi
 ngolimod group 
versus 80·3% (73·31–87·25) of patients in the placebo group (risk reduction 5·05%; hazard ratio 0·95, 95% CI 
0·80–1·12; p=0·544). Safety results were generally consistent with those of studies of fi
 ngolimod in patients with 
relapse-onset multiple sclerosis. Lymphopenia occurred in 19 (6%) patients in the fi
 ngolimod group versus none in the 
placebo group, bradycardia in fi
 ve (1%) versus one (<1%), and fi
 rst-degree atrioventricular block in three (1%) versus 
six (1%). Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients in the fi
 ngolimod group and 117 (24%) in the placebo 
group, including macular oedema in six (2%) versus six (1%), and basal-cell carcinoma in 14 (4%) versus nine (2%).
Interpretation The anti-infl
 ammatory eff
 ects of fi
 ngolimod did not slow disease progression in primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis. Therapeutic strategies for primary progressive multiple sclerosis might need diff
 erent approaches 
to those used for relapse-onset multiple sclerosis.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, infl
 ammatory, neuro-
degenerative disorder of the CNS.1 Although relapse-
onset multiple sclerosis (encompassing relapse-onset 
and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) is the 
most frequent form, 10–15% of patients with 
multiple sclerosis have progressive disability from 
onset with no, or very infrequent, superimposed 
relapses and remissions (primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis).2,3

Although part of the multiple sclerosis disease 
spectrum,4 primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
diff
 ers from relapse-onset multiple sclerosis in several 
ways. The infl
 ammatory component, as measured by 
develop 
ment of gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing MRI 
lesions, is less prominent in primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis than in relapse-onset multiple 
sclerosis.2,5 Men and women are aff
 ected equally, by 
contrast with the higher frequency of relapse-onset 
multiple sclerosis in women.3,6 Patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis are generally about 
10 years older at diagnosis than those with relapsing 
multiple sclerosis (mean age around 40 years for 
primary progressive multiple sclerosis vs 30 years for 
relapse-onset multiple sclerosis).2,6 Moreover, disability 
progresses more rapidly in primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis, such that the severity of disability 
according to age is similar to that in relapse-onset 
multiple sclerosis.7
Despite the range of eff
 ective options available for 
relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, no treatment has been 
shown to change the disease course in primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis.8,9 Fingolimod (Novartis 
Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) is an oral sphingosine 
1-phosphate 
(S1P) 
receptor 
modulator 
that, 
by 
downregulation of the S1P1 receptor subtype, prevents 
lymphocyte 
egress 
from 
lymphoid 
tissues 
into 
circulation. 
In 
relapse-onset 
multiple 
sclerosis, 
fi
 ngolimod reduces the frequency of relapses, delays 
disability progression, and reduces MRI lesion activity 
versus placebo, and decreases the frequency of relapses 
and active MRI lesions versus intramuscular interferon 
beta-1a.10–12 Furthermore, fi
 ngolimod signifi
 cantly limits 
brain volume loss (BVL) in relapse-onset multiple 
sclerosis compared with both placebo and intramuscular 
interferon beta-1a,12,13 a measure associated with 
worsening of disability.14,15
In addition to preventing lymphocyte egress from 
lymphoid tissues, fi
 ngolimod can cross the blood–brain 
barrier and bind to S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5 receptors 
on neural cells.16,17 Therefore, part of fi
 ngolimod’s 
therapeutic action might be independent of its eff
 ect on 
peripheral lymphocytes. S1P1 and S1P3 receptors are 
strongly expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions, and this 
expression has been associated with astrogliosis, a key 
pathological feature of multiple sclerosis lesions.18 
In-vitro and in-vivo data suggest that fi
 ngolimod 
can directly inhibit neurodegeneration. Fingolimod 
treatment of isolated human astrocytes desensitised the 
S1P-receptor-mediated neuroinfl
 ammatory pathways, 
resulting in reduced astrogliosis and neurodegeneration.18 
Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that 
fi
 ngolimod treatment can reduce neuroinfl
 ammatory 
disease and improve CNS tissue integrity.19,20 The ability 
of fi
 ngolimod to reduce infl
 ammatory infi
 ltrates into the 
CNS, coupled with the potential eff
 ects on intrinsic 
mechanisms in the brain, resulting in reduced 
neurodegeneration, provided the rationale for the 
INFORMS trial.
Previous phase 3 studies8,9 in primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis used change in the Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS)21 as the primary outcome 
measure. However, EDSS might not be sensitive 
enough to reliably detect change in clinical status in 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed on July 8, 2015, with no restriction on 
language or publication date, using the search term “primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis”. We identifi
 ed 324 articles, of which 
four were primary reports of results from randomised, blinded, 
placebo-controlled clinical trials. Of these, two were large-scale, 
phase 3 trials: the PROMiSe trial, which compared glatiramer 
acetate with placebo, was designed as a 3-year trial but was 
terminated early; and the 2-year OLYMPUS trial, which compared 
rituximab with placebo. Both studies used the Expanded 
Disability Status Scale as the primary outcome measure and 
showed no treatment benefi
 t on disability progression or brain 
volume loss (BVL), despite eff
 ects on some MRI variables. 
Subsequent discussion of these studies included the eff
 ect of the 
recruited patient populations, trial durations, and the sensitivity 
of the endpoints used to detect treatment diff
 erences in patients 
with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.
Added value of this study
INFORMS addressed the important limitations of previous 
studies in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. INFORMS was 
designed with a novel composite endpoint to increase the 
sensitivity to detect a treatment eff
 ect, and patients were 
exposed to study drug for at least 3 years. Furthermore, the 
study was powered to 90% for detection of a clinically 
meaningful treatment eff
 ect on disability progression. 
INFORMS successfully recruited a population with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis with very low infl
 ammatory 
activity (few relapses and low number of gadolinium-enhancing 
lesions at baseline and throughout the study).
Implications of all the available evidence
Despite the adequate design and an informative study 
population with respect to worsening neurological function, 
INFORMS did not show a benefi
 t for fi
 ngolimod versus placebo 
in terms of disability progression or BVL. The fi
 nding that the 
pharmacodynamic eff
 ects of fi
 ngolimod did not aff
 ect disability 
progression or BVL, despite eff
 ects on MRI-detected 
infl
 ammatory lesion activity, adds to the important discussion 
of the pathophysiology of progressive phase multiple sclerosis 
and will guide future research.

patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
during a phase 3 trial.22 In this study, we combined 
two additional and validated measures of disability 
progression, the 25’ Timed-Walk Test (25’TWT),23 and 
the Nine-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT),23,24 with the EDSS into 
a novel composite endpoint that could provide a 
sensitive and comprehensive assessment of the change 
in clinical status throughout the trial. The aim of this 
study was to assess the eff
 ect of fi
 ngolimod compared 
with placebo on delaying the time to sustained disability 
progression, with this novel composite endpoint.
Methods
Study design
This 
multicentre, 
double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study was done in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines 
for Good Clinical Practice25 and the Declaration of 
Helsinki.26 Patients with primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis were recruited across 148 centres in 18 countries. 
Each site’s institutional review board approved the 
protocol. A steering committee (for membership, see 
appendix) oversaw the study.
Patients
Key eligibility criteria were age 25–65 years with a clinical 
diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
according to the 2005 revised McDonald criteria.27 
Patients had to have 1 year or more of disease progression 
plus two of the following criteria: positive brain MRI; 
positive spinal cord MRI; or positive cerebrospinal fl
 uid 
(CSF). Central review to confi
 rm that the diagnostic 
criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis were 
met was needed for all patients before randomisation.
Additional inclusion criteria included time from fi
 rst 
reported symptoms of 2–10 years before study entry; 
evidence of disability progression documented by an 
increase in EDSS score of 0·5 points or more in the 
past 2 years; objective evidence of disability measured 
by EDSS score of 3·5–6; pyramidal functional system 
score of 2 or more; and a 25’TWT of less than 30 s. 
Exclusion criteria were similar to previous relapse-
onset multiple sclerosis studies (for complete details, 
see appendix).10–12 All patients gave written informed 
consent.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with computer-
generated blocks to receive either fi
 ngolimod or placebo. 
The randomisation sequence was automatically generated 
by a validated system under the responsibility of Novartis 
Drug Supply Management. The randomisation occurred 
in blocks of four within centre in a 1:1 ratio to fi
 ngolimod 
or placebo. Allocation was concealed through the use of 
blinded code-break cards with removable, scratch-off
 
 
cover for the whole double-blind treatment period. All 
randomised drug assignments remained masked to 
patients, investigator staff
 , people performing the 
assessments, and data analysts for the whole double-blind 
treatment period (at least 36 months and up to 5 years). 
Treatment codes were accessible only to members of the 
data and safety monitoring board (DSMB), which was 
independent of Novartis and not otherwise involved in 
the study. We achieved masking by use of identical 
packaging and identical capsule colour and size for 
treatment and placebo.
Heart rate reduction is a known pharmacological eff
 ect 
of fi
 ngolimod that can potentially unmask study 
participants. To maintain masking, an independent fi
 rst 
dose administrator monitored pulse rate after the fi
 rst 
dose of study drug. Employees of the funder who were 
independent of the study team monitored fi
 rst dose 
safety and were masked to study allocation.
Patients were initially randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 
fi
 ngolimod 1·25 mg/day or placebo. After the decision to 
select the 0·5 mg dose of fi
 ngolimod for submission to 
regulatory authorities and to discontinue development of 
fi
 ngolimod 1·25 mg, the protocol was amended on 
Nov 19, 2009, and we stopped allocation to the 1·25 mg 
cohort of patients. Patients who had been assigned to 
1·25 mg fi
 ngolimod were labelled as cohort 1 and were 
switched in a masked manner to fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg; 
those on placebo continued on matching placebo. From 
this timepoint onwards, patients were randomly allocated 
to a new cohort (cohort 2), which included patients who 
were recruited after the protocol amendment, and were 
randomly allocated (1:1) to receive fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg/day 
or placebo.
Procedures
Patients received either oral fi
 ngolimod or placebo 
once daily  for 36 months or up to a maximum 
treatment duration of 5 years. Clinical assessments 
(EDSS, 25’TWT, and 9-HPT) were done at screening, 
at randomisation (baseline), and at study visits, 
including safety assessments at 2 weeks and 1 month, 
2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 
12 months during the fi
 rst year after randomisation 
and then every 3 months until month 36.
An independent, specially trained and certifi
 ed 
evaluating 
physician 
did 
effi
  cacy 
assessments 
(Neurostatus training and documentation DVD). MRI 
scans were analysed at a central MRI centre by trained 
staff
  masked to study group assignment. EDSS 
assessments were scheduled at screening, baseline, 
and then every 3 months during the double-blind 
treatment period, at the end of treatment, and at the 
3-month follow-up visit. EDSS assessment by the 
independent physician was needed at an unscheduled 
visit to confi
 rm occurance of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. The 25’TWT and 9-HPT were assessed at 
baseline and every 3 months throughout the 
double-blind treatment period, at the end of treatment, 
and at the 3-month follow-up visit.

Outcomes
The primary objective was to assess the eff
 ect of 
fi
 ngolimod versus placebo on delaying the time to 
confi
 rmed disability progression (CDP), which was 
centrally 
assessed 
by 
the 
study 
statistical 
and 
programming team. CDP was defi
 ned as the fi
 rst 
occurrence of a progression according to at least one of 
the following three criteria: increase from baseline EDSS 
score by 1 point in patients with baseline EDSS score of 
5·0 or lower, or by 0·5 points in patients with baseline 
EDSS score of 5·5 or higher; increase of at least 20% 
from baseline in the 25’TWT; or increase of at least 20% 
from baseline in time taken to complete the 9-HPT. 
Progression in at least one of the three components had 
to be confi
 rmed for the same component (or components) 
at least 3 months later at a scheduled visit.
Protocol-defi
 ned key secondary objectives were: eff
 ect of 
fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg versus placebo on delaying the time to 
3-month CDP as measured by EDSS, and eff
 ect of 
fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg versus placebo on percent brain 
volume change (PBVC) as a measure of BVL. PBVC was 
measured using SIENA applied to T1-weighted images.28 
Other secondary objectives were to assess the eff
 ect of 
0·5 mg fi
 ngolimod versus placebo on: time to 3-month 
CDP 
by 
25’TWT 
and 
9-HPT; 
MRI 
parameters 
(infl
 ammatory disease activity as indicated by presence of 
Gd-positive lesions and disease burden as indicated by T2 
and T1 hypointense lesion evolution over time); and 
patient-reported outcomes using the Patient Reported 
Indices in Multiple Sclerosis (PRIMUS), EuroQoL 
(EQ-5D), Unidimensional Fatigue Impact Scale (UFIS), 
and Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12). We also 
obtained data for the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic 
relation for fi
 ngolimod.
Specifi
 cations of the adverse event monitoring procedure, 
as defi
 ned in the study protocol, are detailed in the 
appendix, which also provides other details of the methods, 
the list of members of the independent DSMB, and the 
members of the independent diagnosis adjudication board.
Statistical analysis
The study was powered to 90% to detect a reduction 
between fi
 ngolimod and placebo in the time to 3-month 
CDP based on the composite endpoint in a log-rank test 
at a two-sided signifi
 cance level of 5%: a sample size of 
654 patients (327 in each group) was needed to detect a 
3-year event rate reduction in the fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg 
group of 25% (50% event rate on placebo vs 37·5% on 
fi
 ngolimod). The sample size calculations incorporated 
an assumed dropout rate of 10% per year, based on

The primary effi

patients randomly allocated to receive fi
 ngolimod 
0·5 mg or placebo (cohort 2) and all patients randomly 
allocated to placebo in cohort 1. Patients had to have 
taken at least one dose of study drug to be included 
(modifi

use the patients in the placebo group from cohort 1 in 
the primary analysis population after a masked review of 
baseline data showed no diff

analysed separately (appendix), although the number of 
patients in cohort 1 would not have provided enough 
statistical power to detect any potential treatment eff
 ect. 
All effi
  cacy results, unless otherwise specifi
 ed, are based 
on the primary effi
  cacy analysis set. The safety analysis 
population included all patients from cohorts 1 and 2.
For the primary analysis, we used a Cox proportional 
hazards model to test for diff
 erences between fi
 ngolimod 
and placebo in the time to 3-month CDP based on the 
composite endpoint, with region, age, baseline EDSS, 
baseline 25’TWT, and baseline 9-HPT as covariates.
The key secondary analysis of time to 3-month CDP 
based on EDSS was done as for the primary effi
  cacy 
endpoint, but we only analysed disability progression 
based on the EDSS; baseline 25’TWT and baseline 
9-HPT were not included as covariates in the Cox 
proportional hazards model. We analysed PBVC with a 
random coeffi
  cients model, including treatment and 
region as fi
 xed eff
 ects, and time, number of 
Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, baseline T2 lesion 
volume, and normalised brain volume at baseline as 
continuous covariates. To control the type I error rate, 
we tested the primary and key secondary effi
  cacy 
hypotheses in sequential order in a hierarchical 
step-down procedure. We used SAS versions 9.3 and 9.4 
for all statistical analyses. This study was overseen by an 
independent DSMB. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00731692.

Results
Enrolment was between Sept 3, 2008, and Aug 30, 2011, 
and the study was completed on Dec 18, 2014. We 
recruited patients at 148 centres in 18 countries 
(see appendix for a list of the centres and principal 
investigators). We screened 1520 patients, with 
970 randomly allocated (280 patients were randomly 
allocated [1:1] to fi
 ngolimod 1·25 mg or placebo in 
cohort 1 and 690 patients were randomly allocated [1:1] 
to fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg or placebo in cohort 2).

(baseline characteristics for the whole INFORMS patient 
population [cohorts 1 and 2] are shown in the appendix).
The composite primary effi
  cacy endpoint was not met 
(table 2, fi
 gure 2): fi
 ngolimod showed no diff
 erence 
compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0·95, 95% CI 
0·80–1·12; p=0·544) in the time to 3-month CDP. We 
found no diff
 erence in the time to 3-month CDP based 
on EDSS alone (table 2, fi
 gure 2). Effi
  cacy by cohort is 
presented in the appendix; we found no signifi
 cant 
treatment eff
 ect in either cohort.
We did a similar analysis for 6-month CDP and the 
conclusions were consistent with that of the primary 
endpoint (data not shown). Subgroup analyses by sex, 
age (≤40 years vs 41–55 years vs >55 years), EDSS at 
baseline (≤5 vs >5), Gd lesion status at baseline, and age 
plus Gd status at baseline (≤50 years and Gd+ ≥1 vs 
>50 years and Gd+ <1) yielded similar results and did not 
alter the conclusion of no effi
  cacy of fi
 ngolimod in 
patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(data not shown).
PBVC was similar in patients treated with fi
 ngolimod 
0·5 mg and placebo (table 3). However, fi
 ngolimod 
reduced the number of new or newly enlarging T2 
lesions by 73% (rate ratio 0·267, 95% CI 0·185–0·386; 
p<0·0001), of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions by 78% (0·217, 
0·102–0·463; p<0·0001), and of new T1 hypointense 
lesions by 62% (0·375, 0·240–0·587; p<0·0001; table 3). 
Most patients remained free of new or newly enlarging 
T2 lesions to the end of the study in both treatment 
groups (mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 
lesions was 0·5 [95% CI 0·40–0·61] per year in the 
placebo group vs 0·13 [0·10– 0·18] per year in the 
fi
 ngolimod group; table 3). Confi
 rmed relapses were 
reported for six (2%) of 336 patients in the fi
 ngolimod 
group and 41 (8%) of 487 patients in the placebo group. 
We identifi
 ed no signifi
 cant diff
 erences between 
fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg and placebo in change from baseline 
to month 36 for any of the patient-reported outcome 
measures (data not shown).
Fingolimod and fi
 ngolimod-phosphate blood concen-
trations were dose-proportional in patients who 
received 1·25 mg at the beginning of the study and 
were switched to 0·5 mg, and were similar in both 
cohorts after the protocol amendment. Drug exposure 
was similar to that previously documented in patients 
with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis receiving 0·5 mg 
fi
 ngolimod per day.
The incidence of adverse events in the effi
  cacy 
analysis set was generally similar between groups 
(table 4; a summary of adverse events for the whole 
safety analysis set is shown in the appendix), and the 
overall adverse event profi
 le was similar to that of 
studies of fi
 ngolimod in relapse-onset multiple 
sclerosis.10,12 Adverse events were mild or moderate in 
severity in 249 (74%) of 336 receiving fi
 ngolimod and 
366 (75%) of 487 receiving placebo.
Adverse events that led to discontinuation of the study 
drug (including abnormal laboratory test results) were 
more common with fi
 ngolimod than with placebo 
(table 4). Serious adverse events were reported for 25% 
of patients receiving fi
 ngolimod and 24% of those 
receiving placebo.

Five deaths occurred during the study: two (1%) of 
147 in the group originally allocated to receive fi
 ngolimod 
1·25 mg (single cases of respiratory tract infection and 
aspiration pneumonia); one (<1%) of 336 in the 
fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg group in the effi
  cacy analysis set 
(metastatic lung cancer); and two (<1%) of 487 in the 
combined placebo group (single cases of convulsion and 
pulmonary embolism; table 4).
Adverse events of special interest, such as cardiac 
conduction abnormalities, macular oedema, infections, 
and neoplasms, were in line with previous results from 
studies of fi
 ngolimod in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis.
Discussion
In patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, 
fi
 ngolimod treatment did not decrease the risk of 
progression of disability versus placebo. We found no 
diff
 erence between fi
 ngolimod and placebo on BVL. In 
both treatment groups, BVL occurred at roughly 0·5% 
per year, and most patients progressed in their disability 
status, irrespective of treatment. The eff
 ects of fi
 ngolimod 
on MRI measures of lesion activity and clinical relapses 
(although very few in number) were consistent with 
results from placebo-controlled studies in relapse-onset 
multiple sclerosis.11,12
INFORMS is the fi
 rst large, prospective multiple 
sclerosis study that used a composite of three major 
domains of multiple-sclerosis-associated disability as the 
primary endpoint. This composite endpoint yielded more 
progression events than its components, of which the 
highest event rate was recorded for 25’TWT. The outcomes 
of all measures included were consistent, supporting the 
potential usefulness of the composite endpoint in future 
studies of primary progressive multiple sclerosis.
Despite inclusion of patients with an older age (42% of 
patients were older than 50 years; table 1) and more 
advanced disability than previous trials, safety and 
tolerability results for fi
 ngolimod 0·5 mg in INFORMS 
were in line with those of studies in relapse-onset 
multiple sclerosis, including the numbers of adverse 
events of special interest such as cardiac conduction at 
fi
 rst dose and infections.
Based on the event rates of both the composite primary 
disability endpoint and its components, including the 
traditional EDSS endpoint, the study was adequately 
powered to detect a treatment eff
 ect. We recruited a large, 
well defi
 ned worsening population of patients with 
primary progressive multiple sclerosis who progressed 
substantially during the course of the study. In the placebo 
group, around 80% of patients had CDP according to the 
primary composite endpoint, and 59% according to the 
EDSS endpoint. Event rates according to the EDSS were 
higher than those reported in the placebo groups of two 
other large phase 3 trials.8,9 In PROMiSe,9 in which the 
active treatment was glatiramer acetate, the placebo group 
event rate was 45·2%, whereas in the OLYMPUS 
rituximab trial,8 the placebo rate was 38·5%. More than

30% of the CDP events by the primary outcome occurred 
within the fi
 rst 26 weeks after treatment allocation. In line 
with most previous cohorts of patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis,8,9 the INFORMS population 
showed a low rate of active infl
 ammatory MRI lesions 
(<15% positive for Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline) and 
a moderate T2 lesion burden. Together, these data suggest 
that the inclusion criteria of INFORMS succeeded in 
recruiting a characteristic progressing population.4
The rate of discontinuations in INFORMS was in line 
with that of previous studies in patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis,8,9 which were of shorter 
duration, and is also consistent with fi
 ngolimod studies 
in patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, in 
which an approximate dropout rate of 10% per year was 
reported.10–12 We factored this rate of attrition into the 
sample size calculations to ensure an ability to detect a 
treatment diff
 erence at the end of the study.
As with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, the rate of 
BVL in patients with primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis substantially exceeded that observed in 
individuals without multiple sclerosis.29 In relapse-onset 
multiple sclerosis, fi
 ngolimod showed a consistent and 
robust eff
 ect on BVL,12,13 which we did not see in this 
study. In relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, the eff
 ect of 
fi
 ngolimod on BVL is associated with a reduction in 
infl
 ammatory Gd-enhancing and new or enlarging T2 
lesions,15,30 but has also been attributed to actions 
independent of its anti-infl
 ammatory eff
 ects. In primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis, the eff
 ect of fi
 ngolimod 
on lesion activity (Gd-enhancing and new or enlarging 
T2 lesions) was consistent with that seen in relapse-
onset multiple sclerosis, although fewer patients with 
primary progressive multiple sclerosis had lesion 
activity (Gd-enhancing or new or newly enlarging T2 
lesions) than did patients with relapse-onset multiple 
sclerosis. These observations suggest that, although 
fi
 ngolimod has an eff
 ect on infl
 ammatory disease 
activity, it had little eff
 ect on the process that leads to 
BVL and disability progression in primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis. Similarly, in the PROMiSe and 
OLYMPUS trials, treatment had no eff
 ect on BVL 
despite an eff
 ect on Gd-enhancing activity and T2 lesion 
burden at some timepoints.8,9
Unlike 
relapse-onset 
multiple 
sclerosis, 
the 
infl
 ammatory infi
 ltrate in the CNS is not only less 
prominent in primary progressive multiple sclerosis, but 
also diff
 ers in cellular composition.2,5 The patho-
physiological mechanisms that drive BVL probably diff
 er, 
at 
least partly, in these two phenotypes, and 
neurodegenerative processes might have a more 
prominent role in primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
than in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis.
The decision to end development of the 1·25 mg dose 
of fi
 ngolimod based on the better benefi
 t–risk profi
 le of 
the 0·5 mg dose in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis 
restricted the ability to fully assess the effi
  cacy of 
fi
 ngolimod at the higher dose. However, our study was 
adequately powered for assessment of the 0·5 mg dose of 
fi
 ngolimod versus placebo. Additionally, as presented in 
the appendix, we identifi
 ed no sign of a potential 
treatment eff
 ect in the cohort originally assigned to 
receive fi
 ngolimod 1·25 mg.
The results of INFORMS suggest that anti- 
infl
 ammatory 
strategies applied at present in relapse-onset multiple 
sclerosis are unlikely to be benefi
 cial in primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis, and that novel approaches 
might be needed to treat patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis.
