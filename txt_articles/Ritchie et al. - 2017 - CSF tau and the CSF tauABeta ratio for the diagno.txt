Background
Research suggests that measurable change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers occurs years in advance of the onset of clinical
symptoms ( Beckett 2010). In this review, we aimed to assess the ability of CSF tau biomarkers (t-tau and p-tau) and the CSF tau (t-tau
or p-tau)/ABeta ratio to enable the detection of Alzheimer’s disease pathology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These
biomarkers have been proposed as important in new criteria for Alzheimer’s disease dementia that incorporate biomarker abnormalities.
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 1) CSF t-tau, 2) CSF p-tau, 3) the CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio and 4) the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio
index tests for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of
dementia at follow-up.
Search methods
The most recent search for this review was performed in January 2013. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS
Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index
(Thomson Reuters Web of Science), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We searched specialized sources of diagnostic test
accuracy studies and reviews. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for additional studies. We contacted researchers
for possible relevant but unpublished data. We did not apply any language or data restriction to the electronic searches. We did not use
any methodological filters as a method to restrict the search overall.
Selection criteria
We selected those studies that had prospectively well-defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI and with CSF t-tau or
p-tau and CSF tau (t-tau or p-tau)/ABeta ratio values, documented at or around the time the MCI diagnosis was made. We also
included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and which contained sufficient data to construct two by two

 tables expressing those biomarker results by disease status. Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for
Alzheimer’s disease dementia diagnosis, for example, the NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria.
Data collection and analysis
We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all po-
tentially relevant studies, and the full papers for eligibility. Two independent assessors performed data extraction and quality assessment.
Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Main results
In total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data; 430
participants converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and 130 participants to other forms of dementia. Follow-up ranged from less
than one year to over four years for some participants, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years.
Conversion to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases).The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to
90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. At the median specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 75% (95%
CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22
to 0.47).
Six studies (164 cases and 328 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100%
while the specificities were between 22% and 86%. At the median specificity of 47.5%, the estimated sensitivity was 81% (95% CI:
64 to 91), the positive likelihood ratio was 1.55 (CI 1.31 to 1.84), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.39 (CI: 0.19 to 0.82).
Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio. The sensitivities were between 80%
and 96% while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies were few and
small. Only one study reported the accuracy of CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio.
Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. A significant number of studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard,
participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor
methodological quality.
The accuracy of these CSF biomarkers for ‘other dementias’ had not been investigated in the included primary studies.
Investigation of heterogeneity
The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment,
participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding).
We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies
available to be included.
Authors’ conclusions
The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-
tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid
to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. These tests, like other
biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore
might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer’s disease as the aetiology to the individual’s evident cognitive impairment, as opposed
to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid.
However, these tests may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Future studies with more uniformed
approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available
from the included studies we have identified.

 Proteins in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) for early prediction of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia in people with
mild cognitive problems
Background
The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally. A diagnosis of dementia at early stage is
recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach. A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals
can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. In this review, we have focused on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
diagnostic tests.
Review question
We reviewed the evidence about the accuracy of CSF tests in identifying those people presenting with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time.
Study characteristics
The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 15 studies containing a total of 1282 participants with MCI. The majority of
studies (n = 9) were published between 2010 and 2013. The remaining six studies were published between 2004 and 2009. All of the
included studies were conducted in Europe.
Study sizes varied and ranged from 15 to 231 participants.The mean (range) age of the youngest sample was 64 years (45 to 76) and
the mean (standard deviation) age of the oldest sample was 73.4 (6.6) years.
Quality of the evidence
Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting, with a majority of studies at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient details given
on how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established. According to the assessment of how the
CSF tests were conducted and analysed, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality.
Key findings
Below is a summary of key findings for the tests:
CSF t-tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
The sensitivity values in seven individual studies ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. The
statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 77%, and, at the prevalence
of 37%, the positive predictive value was 62% and the negative predictive value was 84%. Based on these results, on average 62 out of
100 people with MCI and a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia but 38 would not; on average, 84
out of 100 people with MCI and with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia, but 16 would.
CSF p-tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
The sensitivity values in six individual studies ranged from 40% to 100% while the specificity values ranged from 22% to 86%. The
statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 48%, the estimated sensitivity was 81%, and, at the prevalence
of 37%, the positive predictive value was 48% and the negative predictive value was 81%. Based on these results, on average 48 out
of 100 people with MCI and with a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia, but 52 would not; on
average, 81 out of 100 people with MCI with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia, but 19
would.
We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic test, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. The
data suggested that a negative CSF test, in people with MCI, almost indicates the absence of Alzheimer’s disease as the cause of their
clinical symptoms. However, a positive CSF test does not confirm the presence of Alzheimer’s disease as the aetiology (cause) of their
clinical symptoms.
There were methodological problems in the included studies that did not allow for a clear answer to the review question. The main
limitations of the review were poor reporting in the included studies, lack of a widely accepted threshold of the CSF diagnostic tests in
people with MCI, variability in length of follow-up, and the marked variation in CSF tests’ accuracy between the included studies.

Included studies
Prospectively well-defined cohorts of MCI participants (n = 7), nested case-control studies with a prospectively defined MCI group (n = 6) and studies
with a retrospectively defined MCI group with longitudinal data (n = 2)
Fifteen studies (N = 1282 participants) were included. Number included in analysis: 1172
Quality concerns
Patient selection and conduct of the reference standard were poorly reported. Applicability concerns were generally low. Regarding the inclusion criteria
set in the review, the majority of included studies did match the review question: ’Could CSF t-tau and CSF t-tau/ABetaratio biomarkers identify those MCI
participants with Alzheimer’s disease pathology at baseline who would convert clinically to dementia at follow up?’ However, due to a limited number of included
studies and levels of heterogeneity, it is difficult to determine to what extent the findings from a meta-analysis can be applied to clinical practice

Conclusions: Given the insufficient evidence to evaluate the diagnostic value in MCI of CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau, CSF t-tau/ ABeta ratio and CSF p-tau/ ABeta ratio for Alzheimer’s
disease dementia and other forms of dementias examined in this review, particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia
(and therefore overtreatment) in clinical practice. Future studies with more uniform approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous
estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified

Dementia is a progressive syndrome of global cognitive impair-
ment with resultant functional decline. In the United Kingdom
(UK), it affects 5% of the population over 65 and 25% of those
over 85 (Knapp 2007). Worldwide, there were estimated to be 36
million people living with dementia in 2010 (Wilmo 2010), and
this will increase to over 115 million by 2050 (Prince 2013). The
greatest increases in prevalence are likely to be seen in the devel-
oping regions. By 2040, China and its western-Pacific neighbours
are predicted to have 26 million people living with dementia (Ferri
2005).
Dementia encompasses a group of neurodegenerative disorders
that are characterised by progressive loss of cognitive function and
ability to perform activities of daily living, that can be accompa-
nied by neuropsychiatric symptoms and challenging behaviours
of varying type and severity. The underlying pathology is usu-
ally degenerative and subtypes of dementia include Alzheimer’s
disease dementia, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies,
and frontotemporal dementia. There may be considerable overlap
in the clinical and pathological presentations (MRC CFAS 2001),
and there is often coexistence of Alzheimer’s disease dementia, vas-
cular dementia and other causes of neuronal atrophy (Matthews
2009; Savva 2009).
Alzheimer’s disease dementia is an incurable, progressive, neurode-
generative condition which accounts for over 50% of all demen-
tias, afflicting 5% of men and 6% of women over the age of 60
worldwide (World Health Organization 2010). Its prevalence in-
creases exponentially with age, with Alzheimer’s dementia affect-
ing fewer than 1% of people aged from 60 to 64 years, but 24%
to 33% of those over the age of 85 (Ferri 2005).
There have been over a dozen different definitions used to de-
scribe cognitive impairment that is somehow qualitatively differ-
ent from so-called ‘normal’ ageing. The first complaints in peo-
ple with Alzheimer’s disease spectrum are often cognitive prob-
lems such as problems with planning and judgement, as well as
the more characteristic memory complaints. This may lead to a
diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) if formal testing
reveals objective evidence of cognitive impairment. It has not been
previously mandated which psychometric tests should be used to
objectively define cognitive impairment. However, the objectivity
of the cognitive impairment diagnosis is critical, as it differentiates
this population from a group with subjective cognitive impair-
ment, which is more likely to have a non-neurodegenerative aeti-
ology. MCI is a heterogeneous condition, the diagnosis of which
holds very little prognostic significance. There are four outcomes
for those within an MCI population: progression to Alzheimer’s
disease dementia, progression to another dementia, maintaining
stable MCI, and recovery. Currently, 16 different classifications
are used to define MCI (Matthews 2008). In this protocol, MCI
refers to this extended definition of MCI or to the clinical criteria
defined by Petersen criteria or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen
1999; Petersen 2004; Winbald 2004) or to the Cognitive Demen-
tia Rating (CDR = 0.5) scale (Morris 1993).
Studies indicate that an annual average of 5% to 15% of peo-
ple with MCI progress to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (Petersen
1999; Bruscoli 2004; Mattson 2009; Petersen 2009). This all de-
pends on clinical profile, settings and investigation for vascular
disease. At the present time, there is no clinical method to de-
termine accurately which of those people with MCI will develop
Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia.
Recent consensus guidelines have been developed, e.g. the second
iteration of International Working Group (IWG2) on ’prodro-
mal dementia’, which seeks to improve prognostic accuracy in the
prodromal phase of Azheimer’s dementia by the incorporation in
criteria of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers (Dubois 2014).
It is in this context, that reviews such as this one become especially
relevant and timely.
Research suggests that measurable change in proton emission to-
mography (PET), magnetic resonance (MRI) and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) biomarkers occurs years in advance of the onset of
clinical symptoms (Beckett 2010). In this review, we aimed to
assess the ability of CSF total tau (t-tau), CSF phosphorylated tau
(p-tau), the CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio, and the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio,
to enable the detection of Alzheimer’s dementia and other forms
of dementia in people with MCI. These biomarkers have been
chosen as they are considered to be the most intimately expressed
biomarkers of the Alzheimer’s disease core pathology; namely, the
aggregation and fibrilisation of the amyloid plaque and hyper-
phosphorylation of tau. Consequentially, these biomarkers have
been proposed as important in new criteria for Alzheimer’s disease
dementia that incorporate biomarker abnormalities. PET imaging
of amyloid is now approved by both the FDA and EMA to rule out
Alzheimer’s disease as the aetiology of MCI, especially in individu-
als with unusual clinical presentations. However, manufacturers of
these tracers have ongoing ’appropriate use criteria’ ongoing post-
marketing studies to learn where these tests have greatest usage and
utility for the person’s accurate diagnosis. Recent improvements
to CSF sampling and the relatively inexpensive nature of this test
compared with PET scanning means that it will remain the test of
choice for documenting CSF protein abnormalities in neurode-
generative disease. Side effects are increasingly rare but include
headache and local reactions at the site of the lumbar puncture. Pa-
tients on anticoagulative therapies (except aspirin) are considered
at too high a risk by most practitioners to undergo this procedure
for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia.
Target condition being diagnosed

dementia and ii) other forms of dementia, both of which were

 assessed at follow-up.
We compared the index test results obtained at baseline with the
results of the reference standard (clinical criteria) obtained at fol-
low-up (delayed verification of clinical diagnosis).
Index test(s)
This review is part of a suite of reviews for assessing the accuracy of
CSF ABeta (Ritchie 2014), PET Amyloid (Zhang 2014; Smailagic
2015), MMSE (Arevalo-Rodriguez 2015), and other index tests
in identifying those people with MCI without clinical onset of
dementia, who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or
other forms of dementia during follow-up. We planned to consider
the following:
Total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) CSF
biomarker tests
Tau is a microtubule-associated protein located primarily in neu-
ronal axons. There are six different human isoforms, each of which
has multiple phosphorylation sites. Physiologically tau interacts
with tubulin and plays an important role in the organisation and
stabilisation of microtubules. Independent of phosphorylation sta-
tus, slightly increased levels of CSF total tau (t-tau) have been as-
sociated with ageing, vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, AIDS
dementia, head injury and tauopathy; significant increases with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and meningoencephalitis; and a three-
fold increase has been seen in Alzheimer’s disease compared to nor-
mal controls (Shoji 2002). A systematic review of CSF biomarkers
for Alzheimer’s disease analysing 41 studies of CSF t-tau, demon-
strated a specificity of 90% and sensitivity of 81% in diagnosing
the condition (Blennow 2003).
The p-tau protein also has a number of potential phosphory-
lation sites (Billingsley 1997) and abnormal hyperphosphory-
lation has been shown to be associated with microtubule dis-
ruption and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic
neurites surrounded by neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads,
major components of Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology (see
Mandelkow 1998). A systematic review of 11 studies of CSF p-
tau in Alzheimer’s disease indicated a diagnostic specificity and
sensitivity of 92% and 80% respectively (Blennow 2003).
There is great interest around the use of biomarkers and imaging
techniques for the prediction of progression from MCI popula-
tions to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other forms of demen-
tia. The international consortium study Alzheimer Disease Neu-
roimaging Initiative (ADNI), performed between 2004 and 2009,
has so far been a key cohort study for predicting the progression
from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease using biomarkers, and demon-
strated a sensitivity and specificity of CSF t-tau of 70% and 92%
and CSF p-Tau181 of 68% and 73% respectively (Petersen 2010).
T-tau/ABeta ratio and p-tau/ABeta ratio CSF biomarker tests
ABeta is produced mainly by neurons, secreted into the CSF and
then cleared through the blood-brain barrier and degraded by the
reticuloendothelial system. ABeta levels are thus regulated in strict
equilibrium between the brain, CSF and blood (Shoji 1992), but,
in Alzheimer’s disease patients, ABeta42 forms insoluble amyloid
and accumulates as intracerebral fibrils, resulting in decreased lev-
els of CSF ABeta42 (Shoji 2001).
ABeta in CSF has only modest potential as a test for delayed ver-
ification of Alzheimer’s disease (Ritchie 2014), with meta-anal-
ysis of studies being hampered by poor methodological quality
(Noel-Storr2013)andmultiple thresholdsbeingreportedbetween
studies (Ritchie 2011).
In 2001, the American Academy of Neurology produced practi-
cal guidelines for dementia, including three Class II or III reports
in a systematic review of a combination study of ABeta42 and
t-tau CSF levels. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease were 85% and 87% (Knopman 2001), sup-
ported by the 2001 systematic review revealing 83% to 100% sen-
sitivity and 85% to 95% specificity for the CSF ABeta42 and t-
tau combination assay (Blennow 2003). Again, the ADNI cohort
study demonstrated that the t-tau/ABeta42 ratio could be used
to predict conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia,
revealing a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 85% (Petersen
2010).
Clinical pathway
Dementia develops over several years and there is a presumed pe-
riod when people are asymptomatic, although disease pathology
may have accumulated. Individuals or their relatives may first no-
tice subtle impairments of short-term memory when the comple-
tion of complex tasks such as management of finances or medi-
cations becomes increasingly difficult. In the UK, people usually
present to their general practitioner who may then refer them to a
specialist following a brief cognitive test, clinical examination and
exclusion of relevant physical illness. The biomarkers may then
be administered by a specialist. There is, however, much regional
variability in this, with Spain and Nordic countries favouring CSF
sampling in their routine clinical work-up, whereas other coun-
tries, such as the UK, do not. However, many people with de-
mentia do not present until much later in the disorder and they
will, therefore, follow a different pathway to diagnosis, for exam-
ple, being identified during an admission to general hospital for a
physical illness. Thus, the pathway influences the accuracy of the
diagnostic test. The accuracy of the test will vary with the expe-
rience of the administrator, and the accuracy of the subsequent
diagnosis will vary with the history of referrals to the particular
healthcare setting. Diagnostic assessment pathways may vary in
other countries and diagnoses may be made by a variety of spe-
cialists including psychiatrists, neurologists, and geriatricians.
Role of index test(s)
The sampling of CSF and assay for levels of tau and ABeta could
have a role when applied in specialist clinics. Due to the costs,
7

 risks, and complexity of the testing, CSF tests will not be applied
in a primary care setting. The roles of these index tests are as add-
on biomarker tests which have been proposed in new research di-
agnostic criteria to compliment clinical examination and cognitive
tests.
Alternative test(s)
We did not include alternative tests in this review, because there
are currently no standard practice tests available for the diagnosis
of dementia.
Rationale
Recently proposed research diagnostic criteria for ‘prodromal
dementia’/’pre-dementia stage’/‘MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease
pathology’ and for ’Alzheimer’s disease’ and for the ’preclinical
states of Alzheimer’s disease’ (Albert 2011; Dubois 2010; Dubois
2014), incorporate biomarkers based on imaging or CSF measures
within the diagnostic rubric. These tests are core to the criteria,
assuming they will improve the specificity of the traditional solely
clinical criteria. It is crucial that each of these biomarkers is assessed
for their diagnostic accuracy before they are adopted as routine
tests in clinical practice. It is worth noting that in each of these
criteria, a single abnormality in any of the proposed biomarker/
imaging tests is considered sufficient to make a diagnosis of pro-
dromal Alzheimer’s disease dementia.
Underpinningthe newcriteriaisthe assumptionthatifAlzheimer’s
disease pathology can be diagnosed at an earlier, pre-dementia
stage, this could open critical windows for interventions that will
have a greater likelihood of success in affecting disease pathways
and thereby improving clinical symptoms. Earlier accurate diag-
nosis will also help people with pre-dementia cognitive impair-
ment, their families and potential carers make timely plans for the
future. Coupled with appropriate contingency planning, proper
recognition of the disease may also help to prevent inappropri-
ate and potentially harmful admissions to hospital or institutional
care (Bourne 2007). In addition, the accurate early identification
of a dementia syndrome may improve opportunities for the use
of newly evolving interventions designed to delay or prevent pro-
gression to more debilitating stages of dementia.
O B J E C T I V E S
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 1) CSF t-tau, 2) CSF p-
tau, 3) the CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio and 4) the CSF p-tau/ABeta
ratio index tests for detecting people with MCI at baseline who
would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other
forms of dementia at follow-up.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the amount and associations of heterogeneity in the
included studies of test accuracy.
We expected heterogeneity to be an important component of the
review. We planned to use target population, index test, target
disorder and study quality as a framework for the investigation of
heterogeneity.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We considered longitudinal cohort studies in which index test re-
sults were obtained at baseline and the reference standard results
at follow-up (see Index tests; Reference standards). These studies
necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia
and are sometimes labelled as ‘delayed verification cross-sectional
studies’ (Bossuyt 2008,; Knottnerus 2002). This approach recog-
nises the challenges of concurrent application of the reference test
and index test. In reality, the reference standard for dementia is tis-
sue sampling and histological examination, either at post mortem
or from brain biopsy. Brain biopsy is not undertaken in any set-
ting and a post mortem is so distant an event from the index test
being conducted that there is the possibility that disease may have
developed in the years after the index test. The Dementia DTA
group chose to use later diagnosis of dementia (using standardised
criteria) as evidence of delayed verification. This methodology has
been published by our group (Mason 2010) and also reflects the
approach taken in most of the primary research in this area.
We included nested case-control studies if they incorporated a
delayed verification design. We believe this can only occur in the
context of a cohort study, so these studies are invariably diagnostic
nested cohort studies. We only included data on performance
of the index test to discriminate between people with MCI who
converted to dementia and those who remained stable from those
studies. We did not consider data from healthy controls or any
other control group.
Participants
Participants recruited and clinically classified as those with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline were eligible for inclusion
in this review. The diagnosis for MCI was established using the Pe-
tersen criteria or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen 1999; Petersen
2004; Winbald 2004) and/or Matthews criteria (Matthews 2008)
8

cognitive impairment (MCI) (Review)

 and/or ’CDR = 0.5’ (Morris 1993). These criteria include: subjec-
tive complaints; a decline in memory objectively verified by neu-
ropsychological testing in combination with a history from the
patient; a decline in other cognitive domains; no or minimal im-
pairment of activities of daily living; and not meeting the criteria
for dementia. Therefore, the eligible participants had a number of
tests, e.g. neuropsychological tests for cognitive deficit and check-
lists for activities of daily living, before study entry. Participants
were defined either as amnestic single domain, amnestic multiple
domain, non-amnestic single domain, non-amnestic multiple do-
main, or nonspecified MCI participants.
We included participants from secondary and tertiary settings.
Although demographic and clinical characteristics of MCI, as well
as sources of recruitment, might differ in those settings, we decided
not to limit our review by setting; instead, we planned to look for
variation within and between settings, and examined the potential
influence of the setting on diagnostic performance of the index
test in the analyses.
We excluded those studies that included people with MCI possi-
bly caused by: i) a current or history of alcohol/drug abuse; ii) cen-
tral nervous system (CNS) trauma (e.g. subdural haematoma), tu-
mour, or infection; iii) other neurological conditions, e.g. Parkin-
son’s or Huntington’s diseases.
Because detail of the causes of study dropouts is crucial, and, if
such data are missing, the reliability of the conclusions must be
questioned, we planned to take this into consideration.
Index tests
Studies that assessed the accuracy of CSF measurements of CSF t-
tau, CSF p-tau, CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio, or CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio
were included.
There are currently no generally accepted standards for the plasma
or CSF ABeta test threshold, and therefore it was not possible to
prespecify what constituted a positive or negative result. We used
the criteria which were applied in each included primary study to
classify participants as either test positive or test negative.
Measure of index test: t-tau and p-tau and ABeta level in CSF (ng.l
−1 or pg.ml−1)
The assays most commonly used were conventional Innogenetics,
Ghent, Belgium kit or INNOTEST Phospho-Tau(181) kit or IN-
NOTEST ABeta42 or INNOTEST the multiplexing INNO-BIA
AlzBio3 for CSF.
We did not include a comparator test because there are currently
no standard practice tests available for the diagnosis of dementia.
We compared the index tests with a reference standard.
Target conditions
There were two target conditions in this review:
1. Alzheimer’s disease dementia (conversion from MCI to
Alzheimer’s disease dementia)
2. Any other forms of dementia (conversion from MCI to any
other forms of dementia)
Reference standards
For the purpose of this review, several definitions of Alzheimer’s
disease dementia were acceptable. Included studies could ap-
ply probable or possible NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute
of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and
the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association) cri-
teria (McKhann 1984). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM) (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994) and
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health
Organization 2010) definitions for Alzheimer’s disease dementia
were also acceptable. It should be noted that different iterations
of these standards may not be directly comparable over time (e.g.
DSM-IIIR versus DSM-IV). Moreover, the validity of the diag-
noses may vary with the degree or manner in which the criteria
have been operationalised (e.g. individual clinician versus algo-
rithm versus consensus determination). We planned to consider
all these issues in interpreting the results, using sensitivity analyses
as appropriate.
Similarly, differing clinical definitions of other forms of dementias
were acceptable. For Lewy body dementia, the reference standard
is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2005). For fron-
totemporal dementia, the reference standard is the Lund criteria
(LMG 1994, Neary 1998, Boxer 2005). DSM (DSMIII 1987;
DSMIV 1994) and ICD (World Health Organization 2010) were
also acceptable for frontotemporal and vascular dementias.
The time interval over which progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s
disease dementia or other forms of dementia happened is also im-
portant. As age is the principal risk factor for Alzheimer’s demen-
tia and other forms of dementias, the longer the duration of fol-
low-up, the more likely the possibility of generating false positive
findings for the index test. To this end, no limits were put on the
length of follow-up in the included studies, though this important
variable was captured so we could examine between-study varia-
tions. This change reflected an alteration to the original thinking
in the published protocol and is noted in the Differences between
protocol and review section of this review.
We planned to segment analyses into separate follow-up periods
for the delay in verification: less than one year, one year to less
than two years; two to less than four years; and more than four
years.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
The main search for this review was performed in January
2013. However, we ran a top-up search in December 2015.

 We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS
Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science
Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation In-

and LILACS (BIREME) (see Appendix 1 for details of the sources

results of the top-up search that were carried out in December
2015 have not yet been fully incorporated into the review (please
see Results of the search for more details).
We also requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic
Test Accuracy Studies (managed by the Cochrane Renal Group).
We did not apply any language or date restrictions to the elec-
tronic searches. We did not use methodological search filters (col-
lections of terms aimed at reducing the number needed to screen
by filtering out irrelevant records and retaining only those that are
relevant) in the main bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Em-
base and PsycINFO) as a single-stranded method to restrict the
search overall because available filters have not yet proved sensitive
enough for systematic review searches (Beynon 2013). Instead,
we used a multi-stranded approach in order to maximise sensitiv-
ity, including some searches run in parallel, that included specific
terms designed to capture diagnostic studies (see search narrative
in Appendix 1)
Searching other resources
We checked the reference lists of all relevant studies for addi-
tional studies. We also conducted searches in the MEDION

tematic reviews of diagnostic studies from the International Fed-
eration of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Commit-
tee for Evidence-based Laboratory Medicine database (C-EBLM).
We checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews for
additional studies. We also contacted researchers involved in rele-
vant studies for applicable and usable but unpublished data.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two researchers (EL and AN-S) screened all titles and abstracts
generated by the electronic database searches for relevance.
Two researchers (EL and AN-S) independently reviewed the re-
maining abstracts of selected titles and selected all potentially-eli-
gible studies for full text review. Four researchers (NS, AN-S, SM
and EL ) independently further assessed full manuscripts against
the inclusion criteria (see Criteria for considering studies for this
review). Where necessary, a third arbitrator (CWR) resolved dis-
agreements that the two researchers could not resolve through dis-
cussion.
Where a study included useable data but these were not presented
in the published manuscript, we contacted the authors directly to
request further information. If the same data set was presented in
more than one paper, we included only the primary paper.
We detailed the numbers of studies selected at each point in a
study flow diagram (Figure 1).

 Data extraction and management
We extracted data onto a study-specific form which included the
following:
• Author, year of publication, and journal.
• The index test and assay type used (thresholds used to
define positive and negative tests).
• The criteria used for clinical definition for the baseline
population.
• Baseline demographics of the study population (age, gender,
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, MMSE and clinical setting).
• The duration of follow-up (mean, minimum, maximum,
and median).
• The proportion of participants developing the outcome of
interest (Alzheimer’s disease dementia using NINCDS-ADRDA
criteria) as well as other forms of dementias where standard
criteria were used.
• The sensitivity and specificity of the index test in defining
Alzheimer’s disease dementia (these were used to back-translate
into a 2 x 2 table (Appendix 2)).
• Other data relevant for creating 2 x 2 tables (TP = true test
positive; FP = false test positive; FN = false test negative; TN =
true test negative) e.g. the number of ’abnormal’ and ’normal’
tests and baseline variables; the number of disease ’presence’ and
disease ’absence’ at follow-up, as well as through scrutiny of
scatter plots.
We also extracted data necessary for the assessment of quality as
defined below.
Data extraction was performed independently by two blinded re-
view authors (NS and AN-S). Disagreement in data extraction was
resolved by discussion, with the potential to involve a third author
(CWR) as arbitrator, if necessary.
Assessment of methodological quality
Two review authors ( NS and AN-S), blinded to each other’s scores,
independently performed methodological quality assessments of
each study using the QUADAS-2 tool ( Whiting 2011), as rec-
ommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Disagreement was re-
solved by further review and discussion with the potential to in-
volve a third author (CWR) as arbitrator, if necessary.
The tool is made up of four domains: participant selection, index
test, reference standard and participant flow. Each domain was as-
sessed in terms of risk of bias, with the first three domains also con-
sidered in terms of applicability concerns (Quadas-2) (Appendix
3).The components of each of these domains and a rubric which
details how judgments concerning risk of bias are made are de-
tailed in Appendix 4. Certain key areas important for this review
regarding quality assessment were participant selection, index test,
and blinding.
We did not use QUADAS-2 data to form a summary quality score.
We produced a narrative summary describing numbers of studies
that were found to have high/low/unclear risk of bias, as well as
concerns regarding applicability.
Statistical analysis and data synthesis
We evaluated test accuracy according to the target condition.
There are no accepted thresholds to define what constitutes a
positive or negative CSF index test for identifying those people
with MCI who would convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
or other forms of dementia over time. Therefore, the estimates
of diagnostic accuracy reported in primary studies were likely to
be based on data-driven threshold selection ( Leeflang 2008). We
conducted exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity
and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver op-
erating characteristic (ROC) space. We did not meta-analyse pairs
of sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate model, as origi-
nally planned, because the results were not clinically interpretable
when studies with mixed thresholds were included in the analysis.
Instead, we fitted HSROC meta-analysis models to estimate sum-
mary ROC curves using SAS (Statistical Analysis Software), ver-
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute 2011). We derived estimates of sensitivity
and likelihood ratios at a fixed value of specificity (chosen a priori
as the median specificity for the studies that were analysed when
fitting the model) from the HSROC models for the illustrative
purposes. Confidence intervals for sensitivity and the likelihood
ratios were calculated using the delta method (Davison 2003), us-
ing the ’estimate’ command after fitting the HSROC models in
SAS. HSROC models were only fitted for analyses where data for
2 x 2 tables were provided by at least six studies, given the need to
estimate five parameters. Where HSROC models were fitted, we
summarised the post-test probability of conversion from MCI to
dementia given a positive test result and given a negative test re-
sult for a range of prevalences of conversion (pretest) probabilities.
This was done by plotting the post-test probabilities against the
pretest probabilities, calculating the former based on the pretest
probabilities and the likelihood ratios estimated from the HSROC
model at the median of the observed specificity values from the
included studies. A positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative
predictive value (NPV) were also reported, based on the median
prevalence (pretest probability) of conversion across studies. We
caution that these post-test probabilities and PPV and NPV values
related to likelihood ratios for hypothetical values of sensitivity
and specificity for which the true threshold value of the index test
was not known.

 Investigations of heterogeneity
Heterogeneity was investigated through visual examination of for-
est plots of sensitivities and specificities and through visual exam-
ination of the ROC plot of the raw data. The main sources of
heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used,
participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study
quality (particularly inadequate blinding).
There were insufficientstudies,therefore we didnotperformmeta-
regression (by including each potential source of heterogeneity as a
covariate in the HSROC model) as planned (Differences between
protocol and review).
Sensitivity analyses
We planned to investigate the effect of quality items (such as pre-
specifying threshold) on the accuracy of index tests by undertaking
sensitivity analyses. Due to the limited number of studies, we did
not perform any sensitivity analyses (Differences between protocol
and review)
Assessment of reporting bias
We did not investigate reporting bias because of current uncer-
tainty about how it operates in test accuracy studies and the inter-
pretation of existing analytical tools such as funnel plots.

Results of the search
The total number of records identified by the searches up to Jan-
uary 2013 was 20,446. After de-duplication, a small team of as-
sessors performed a first assessment of the remaining records. Af-
ter a second assessment, 255 records were retained, of which 178
were excluded after assessment performed by two review authors.
Seventy-seven references were identified as possible eligible stud-
ies and were assessed for inclusion (Figure 1). Fifteen papers were
included, and 40 were discarded for the following reasons: i) data
not suitable for analysis or insufficient data for creating two by
two tables (n = 28) (Characteristics of excluded studies); ii) not
a delayed verification study (n = 2); iii) not MCI participants at
baseline (n = 2); iv) unsuitable index test (n = 2); v) reference not
obtained (n = 5). In addition, twenty two papers were identified
as multiple publications. One paper was not in English (Urakami
2004). No extra studies were found through reference checking.
We obtained usable data for five papers (Amlien 2013; Galluzzi
2010; Hansson 2006; Visser 2009; Vos 2013) through contacting
the authors.
We ran a top-up search in December 2015. The results of this
search will be fully incorporated into the review at update. How-
ever, readers may wish to know that this search identified a total of
6314 results. After screening, four new studies were identified for
inclusion within the review (please see Additional Tables: Table 1
for more details). The characteristics of these four new studies and
their heterogeneity were all consistent with the fully incorporated
studies.
Included Studies
The Characteristics of included studies table lists the characteris-
tics of the 15 included studies containing a total of 1282 partic-
ipants with MCI at baseline of whom 1172 had analysable data.
Two studies (Buchhave 2012; Hansson 2006) involved the same
cohort. Buchhave 2012 reported the data for the CSF p-tau/ABeta
ratio index test from a new follow-up period.
Study designs were seven prospectively well-defined cohorts
of participants with MCI (Buchhave 2012; Fellgiebel 2007;
Galluzzi 2010; Herukka 2007; Kester 2011; Palmqvist 2012; Vos
2013), six nested case-control studies with a prospectively de-
fined MCI group (Amlien 2013; Hansson 2006; Koivunen 2008;
Monge-Argiles 2011; Parnetti 2012; Visser 2009) and two studies
with a retrospectively defined MCI group with longitudinal data
(Eckerstrom 2010; Hampel 2004).
A majority of studies (n = 9) were published between 2010 and
2013. The remaining six studies were published from 2004 to
2008. All of the included studies were conducted in Europe (five in
Sweden, two in Italy and two in Finland, one in The Netherland,
one in Spain, one in Norway, one in Germany and two were
European multi-centre studies). They used one version or another
of the Petersen criteria for MCI. Twelve studies applied NINCDS-
ADRDA criteria or NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM criteria as a
reference standard for Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Amlien 2013
used Global Dementia Scale (GDS) & Research criteria, Fellgiebel
2007 used ’CDR = 1 criteria’ and Parnetti 2012 did not specify
the reference standard at follow-up.
Study sizes varied and ranged from 15 (Koivunen 2008) to 231
participants (Vos 2013). Nine papers had included participants
with a mean age of 70 years or under. The mean (range) age
of the youngest sample was 64 years (45 to 76) (Amlien 2013)
and the mean (SD) age of the oldest sample was 73.4 (6.6) years
(Monge-Argiles 2011). Sampling procedure and APOE
4 gene
carriers were poorly reported. Participants were mainly recruited
from university memory clinics (n = 8), while one study did not
report sources of recruitment (Koivunen 2008).
Different CSF biomarker level values were used as a threshold
in the included studies (Additional tables: Table 2). The thresh-
old was prespecified in only five studies (Amlien 2013; Herukka
2007; Kester 2011; Koivunen 2008; Vos 2013). A percentage of
converters to Alzheimer’s disease dementia ranged from 22% (
Visser 2009) to 56% (Hampel 2004). CSF index test positivity
ranged from 23% (Amlien 2013) to 69% (Vos 2013) . Duration
of follow-up was reported as mean and standard deviation (SD),
or median, or range. Most studies had follow-up between 12 and
36 months. Some participants were followed up for less than one

 year in three of the included studies (Fellgiebel 2007; Hampel
2004; Monge-Argiles2011), and for more than four years in five of
the included studies (Buchhave 2012; Herukka 2007; Palmqvist
2012; Parnetti 2012). Participants in the remaining seven stud-
ies (Amlien 2013; Eckerstrom 2010; Galluzzi 2010; Kester 2011;
Koivunen 2008; Visser 2009) were followed up from one to three
years.
Excluded studies
Twenty-nine studies, nine of which were ADNI studies, were ex-
cluded as they failed to meet the inclusion criteria for participants,
index test, target condition, or they didn’t have diagnostic accuracy
data (Characteristics of excluded studies). We contacted the au-
thors of two of the ADNI studies (Landau 2010; Westman 2012)
in order to obtain additional data for creating two by two tables.
Further information was not available for the Landau 2010 study
at the time this review was prepared. The author of the Westman
2012 study informed us that the accuracy of combined, not indi-
vidual, CSF biomarkers was assessed in their study.
Studies awaiting classifications
The Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table lists the
characteristics of four studies which might be considered for the
inclusion in an updated review. The authors of all those studies
need to be contacted in order to obtain missing data/relevant in-
formation. Regarding the target condition ‘Conversion from MCI
to Alzheimer’s disease’, provisional data from two studies (Ewers
2012; Leuzy 2015) might be used for the analysis of CSF t-tau;
data for the analysis of CSF p-tau ABeta42/p-tau ratio index tests
might be available only from Ewers 2012 and Balasa 2014, respec-
tively.
Additional Tables: Table 1 shows that the percentage of converters
to Alzheimer’s disease dementia ranged from 36% to 47%. Dura-
tion of follow-up was between 24 and 41 months. Leuzy 2015 did
not report duration of follow-up and Ewers 2012 did not report a
threshold value. The heterogeneity of results in these four studies
was consistent with that observed in the fully incorporated studies.
Methodological quality of included studies
Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool
(Whiting 2011).
Review authors’ judgements about each methodological quality
item for each included study are presented in the Characteristics
of included studies table and Figure 2. The overall methodological
quality of included study cohorts is summarised in Figure 3.

 Figure 3.
Risk of bias and applicability concerns graph: review authors’ judgements about each domain
presented as percentages across included studies
In the participant selection domain, we considered five studies
(Eckerstrom 2010; Hampel 2004; Herukka 2007; Kester 2011;
Koivunen 2008) to be at high risk of bias because the participants
were not consecutively or randomly enrolled or both the sampling
procedure and exclusion criteria were not described. We stated that
all included studies avoided a case-control design because we only
considered data on performance of the index test to discriminate
between people with MCI who converted to dementia and those
who remained stable. We considered four studies (Amlien 2013;
Buchhave 2012; Galluzzi 2010; Hansson 2006) to be at low risk of
bias. We considered the remaining six studies to be at unclear risk
of bias, due to poor reporting on sampling procedure or exclusion
criteria
In the index test domain, we considered eight studies (Buchhave
2012; Eckerstrom 2010; Fellgiebel 2007; Hampel 2004; Hansson
2006; Monge-Argiles 2011; Palmqvist 2012; Parnetti 2012) to be
at high risk of bias because the threshold used was not prespecified
and the optimal cutoff level was determined from ROC analyses;
therefore, the accuracy of the CSF biomarkers reported in these
studies appeared to be overestimated. We considered two studies
(Amlien 2013; Galluzzi 2010) to be at unclear risk of bias, due to
poor reporting. We considered the remaining five studies to be at
low risk of bias.
In the reference standard domain, we considered nine studies
(Amlien 2013; Eckerstrom 2010; Fellgiebel 2007; Galluzzi 2010;
Hampel 2004; Kester 2011; Koivunen 2008; Monge-Argiles
2011; Parnetti 2012) to be at unclear risk of bias, mainly because
it was not reported whether clinicians conducting follow-up were
aware of initial CSF biomarker analysis results. Three of those
nine studies did not clearly report the reference standards used
for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease dementia. We were not able to
obtain the information about how the reference standard was ob-
tained and by whom, due to poor reporting. We considered the
remaining six studies to be at low risk of bias.
In the flow and timing domain, we judged nine studies (Amlien
2013; Eckerstrom2010; Fellgiebel2007; Galluzzi2010; Koivunen
2008; Monge-Argiles 2011; Parnetti 2012; Visser 2009; Vos 2013)
to be at unclear risk of bias because not all participants were in-
cluded in the analysis and/or the follow-up period was shorter
than one year and/or reporting was poor. We judged three studies
(Galluzzi 2010; Hansson 2006; Kester 2011) to be at high risk of
bias because a large number of participants with non-Alzheimer’s
disease dementia were excluded from the analysis. We considered
the remaining three studies to be at low risk of bias.
For assessment of applicability concerns, for the majority of the
studies there was no concern that the included participants and
setting, the conduct and interpretation of the index test, and the
target condition (as defined by the reference standard) in each
of the included studies did not match the review question. We
judged two studies (Eckerstrom 2010; Koivunen 2008) to be of
unclear applicability because of concerns regarding the participant
characteristics or setting. We also judged four studies (Amlien
2013; Eckerstrom 2010; Fellgiebel 2007; Parnetti 2012) to be
of unclear applicability because of concerns with respect to the
reference standard.
It should be noted that the lack of concern about applicability of
the three domains mentioned above was based on the inclusion
criteria set in the review, and therefore the judgment about appli-
cability may be overstated.

 Tables: Table 2 and Table 3. Included studies used a range of
different thresholds. The number of positive CSF index tests at
baseline varied across studies. The summary of main results for
the fifteen included studies is presented in Summary of findings.
CSF t-tau for Alzheimer’s disease dementia
Individual study estimates of sensitivity and specificity are shown
in Figure 4 for each of the seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-
cases) that evaluated Alzheimer’s disease dementia. The sensitivity
values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged
from 48% to 88%. The thresholds used ranged from ≥ 77 to ≥
500 pg/mL (ng/L).

The summary ROC curve summarising the accuracy of CSF t-
tau across the seven studies is shown in Figure 5. Because of the
variation in thresholds, we did not estimate a summary sensitivity
and specificity. However, we derived estimates of sensitivity and
likelihood ratios at fixed values of specificity from the HSROC
model we fitted to produce the summary ROC curve. At the me-
dian specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 77% (95%
CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43
to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22
to 0.47).

At the median specificity (72%) and the median prevalence of

the positive predictive value was 62%, which means on average 62
out of 100 people with MCI and a positive index test result would
convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia, but 38 would not. The
negative predictive value of 84% means that on average 84 out of
100 people with MCI and with a negative index test result would
not convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia, but 16 would.

Six studies (164 cases and 328 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy
of CSF p-tau for conversion to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (

the specificities were between 22% and 86%. The thresholds used
ranged from ≥ 39 to ≥ 85 pg/mL (ng/L).

Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy
of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio for conversion to Alzheimer’s disease
dementia (Figure 10). The sensitivities were between 80% and
96%, while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We
were not able to report the range of thresholds due to different
measurements: < 6.6 pg/mL (ng/L); 0.18; 1074.0; < 9.92. Figure
11 shows the summary ROC space. We did not conduct a meta-
analysis because the studies were few and small.

 CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio for Alzheimer’s disease dementia
Only two studies (Monge-Argiles 2011; Vos 2013) evaluated
the accuracy of the CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio for conversion to
Alzheimer’s disease dementia.The sensitivities were 50% and 51%,
and specificities were 91% and 96%, respectively. We were not
able to conduct the meta-analysis.
CSF t-tau for all forms of dementia (combined Alzheimer’s
disease dementia and non-Alzheimer’s disease dementia)
Only four studies (166 cases and 153 non-cases) evaluated the
accuracy of CSF t-tau for conversion to all forms of dementia
(Figure 12 and Figure 13). The sensitivity values ranged from 42%
to 79%, while the specificity values ranged from 63% to 95%.
The thresholds used ranged from
350 to ≥ 500 pg/mL (ng/L).
As above, we did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies
were few and small.

Investigation of heterogeneity
We were not able to formally assess the effects of each potential
source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of
studies available to be included.
Sensitivity analyses
Due to the limited number of studies evaluating each of four
CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other types of
dementia, we did not perform any sensitivity analyses, as planned.
D I S C U S S I O N
We performed a review of the available evidence on the diagnostic
accuracy of CSF biomarker levels for detecting Alzheimer’s dis-
ease pathology in people with MCI, and identifying those MCI
participants who would convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
or other forms of dementia over time. In the absence of a con-
temporaneous reference standard for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis
relative to the application of the index test, the decision to use a
delayed verification design was taken for all DTA reviews by our
group. This, however, creates problems when the length of follow-
up in studies varies, as the longer a study, in a chronic disorder
where age is the principal risk factor, could create false positive
25

 findings. To address this, length of follow-up was collected to help
interpret between-study variations in accuracy.
There is, however, a paucity of evidence in relation to the accuracy
of CSF biomarkers. Where data were available for conversion to
Alzheimer’s disease dementia, there was a wide range of sensitivity
(51% to 90%; 40% to 100%; 80% to 96%) and specificity (48%
to 88%; 22% to 86%; 33% to 95%) values for the CSF t-tau,
CSF p-tau and CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio index tests, respectively.
Due to the wide variations in thresholds, we did not estimate a
summary sensitivity and specificity. Although, subject to consid-
erable uncertainty of a statistical approach, in order to illustrate
the potential strengths and weaknesses of CSF biomarker levels we
estimated from the fitted summary ROC curve that the sensitivity
was 77% (95% CI 67 to 85) and 81% (95% CI 64 to 91) at the
included study median specificity of 72% and 48% for the CSF
t-tau and CSF p-tau respectively. Assuming a conversion rate of
MCI to Alzheimer’s dementia of 37%, for every 100 CSF t-tau
level, nine individuals with a negative test would progress and 18
with a positive test would not progress to Alzheimer’s dementia;
for every 100 CSF p-tau level, seven individuals with a negative
test would progress and 33 with a positive test would not progress
to Alzheimer’s dementia. The estimation of predictive values and
consequences in a cohort of 100 (‘missed cases’ and ‘over-diag-
nosed’) were based on hypothetical sensitivity and specificity val-
ues for which the threshold of the test is unknown; therefore, these
findings should be interpreted with caution.
We were not able to evaluate the accuracy of CSF biomark-
ers for conversion from MCI to other forms of dementia (non-
Alzheimer’s disease dementia). As a result of the information avail-
able from four studies (Eckerstrom 2010; Galluzzi 2010; Hansson
2006; Herukka 2007), we evaluated the accuracy of CSF t-tau for
conversion to all types of dementia (combined Alzheimer’s disease
dementia and non-Alzheimer’s disease dementia). The sensitivity
values ranged from 42% to 79% while the specificity values ranged
from 63% to 95%. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because
the studies were few and small.
Previous reviews of tests of amyloid in CSF and plasma (Ritchie
2014) and evidenced through PET imaging (Zhang 2014) have
been published. They highlighted that as a test, there was consis-
tently better sensitivity than specificity whereby the absence of ev-
idence of amyloid pathology (low levels in CSF and high levels in
the cortices) was likely to exclude a later diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease dementia, whereas the presence of amyloid pathology did
not add much incremental benefit to diagnostic accuracy. Consid-
ering the findings of this systematic review, we have demonstrated
again that the NPV is greater than the PPV which is a reflection
of the higher sensitivity of these tests compared to their specificity.
That is, a test indicating absence of biomarker abnormality and
hence suggesting absence of disease is of more value than a positive
biomarker indicating disease. CSF biomarkers are better at ruling
out Alzheimer’s disease than ruling it in as a cause of the clini-
cal symptoms, and therein progression to Alzheimer’s dementia in
people described as having MCI. However, the reported optimal
thresholds in individual papers tended to yield better sensitivi-
ties than specificities and this was reflected in our sROC analysis;
therefore, those results should be interpreted with caution.
Given the insufficient evidence to evaluate the diagnostic value in
MCI of CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau and the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio for
Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias examined in
this review, particular attention should be paid to the risk of mis-
diagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore overtreat-
ment) in clinical practice. Our findings are consistent with the
expert opinion conveyed by Molinuevo et al (Molinuevo 2014)
where it was recognised that negative tests results were more clin-
ically useful than positive ones. They still saw a routine use for
these tests in clinical practice, and our review will help describe the
degree of accuracy to help inform clinicians using this test in their
current practice. As sensitivity of this test was better than speci-
ficity, the risk of a missed diagnosis, or a false-negative test was
lower. False reassurance given to a patient that they don’t have or
will not get Alzheimer’s dementia would also have serious clinical
consequences; however, appropriate pretest counselling for what
can and cannot be revealed through CSF testing would mitigate
the risk of an inappropriate level of salience being afforded to this
particular test.
Summary of main results
In total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified
in the fifteen included studies, of which 1172 had analysable data;
430 participants converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and
130 participants to other forms of dementia at follow-up. It was
possible to undertake a summary analysis of the CSF t-tau and
p-tau markers but not the ratio, as too few studies presented re-
sults for the ratio. Consistent with the findings from the amy-
loid reviews, CSF t-tau and p-tau were reasonably sensitive tests
for later diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia, but had poor
specificity. This is illustrated in Figure 6 and Figure 9 where the
small positive likelihood ratio for both CSF t-tau and p-tau has
very little impact on the change from pretest probability to post-
test probability. With respect to the CSF t-tau/Abeta ratio, it was
not possible to generate likelihood ratios, due to only one study
(Monge-Argiles 2011) reporting data . However, from Figure 10,
it can be seen that for all but one study (Parnetti 2012), the sen-
sitivity exceeded the specificity for the p-tau/ABeta ratio. Figure
12 though demonstrates across four studies, that the specificity of
CSF t-tau is improved when the outcome is ’all forms of demen-
tia’, suggesting that the elevation of tau is a nonspecific marker of
neurodegeneration and not tightly tethered to Alzheimer’s disease
pathology.
Our findings were based on studies with poor reporting and most
included studies had an unclear risk of bias, mainly for reference
standard and participant selection domains. Nine studies (56%)

 hadunclearriskof biasforthe flowand timingdomain, mainlydue
to not including all participants in the analysis or inappropriate
duration of the follow-up period. According to the assessment of
the index test domain, 50% of studies were of poor methodological
quality.
The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be index
test thresholds, reference standards used for the target disorders,
sources of recruitment, participant sampling and aspects of study
quality (particularly inadequate blinding). We were not able to
formally assess the effects of each potential source of heterogeneity,
as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be
included.
Strengths and weaknesses of the review
There were a number of strengths to this review. This review was
conducted in adherence to the inclusion criteria and methods de-
scribed in a published protocol (Ritchie 2011). We searched a
number of electronic databases, using an extensive range of appro-
priate database indexing terms and equivalent text words covering
the index test, how it was measured, and the target condition. The
multi-stranded search approach that we adopted to combine dif-
ferent search concepts in searches run in parallel, some including
a more specific diagnostic component, has successfully increased
the overall sensitivity of the search and is a strength of this review.
Our searches were not limited by language. We contacted 12 study
authors and usable data were obtained for five studies ( Amlien
2013; Galluzzi 2010; Hansson 2006; Visser 2009; Vos 2013).
There were, however, also a number of limitations to this review.
There was limited published information and substantial variation
in the quality of the papers and caution is needed when interpret-
ing these findings. Most included studies provided little data on
participants at baseline. Several studies reported high or unclear
dropout and withdrawal rates. Studies also contained wide varia-
tions in thresholds. It is also a weakness of the review that variabil-
ity in length of follow-up in the various cohorts was so great. It
would stand to reason that a longer follow-up period would more
likely yield more cases of dementia, given that age is the princi-
pal risk factor for dementia. On the other hand, short follow-up
periods might increase false negative results. This topic is of great
interest to the field where determination of proximal and distal
biomarkers are being considered. In an MCI population present-
ing to a clinician, it is the question of proximity to a decline to
dementia which is the most relevant; in this regard, follow-up peri-
ods of over five years lose clinical meaningfulness. Standardisation
of the follow-up period would help reviews like this; this has been
suggested in our group’s recent STARDdem proposals (Noel-Storr
2014). In our review, we were unable to formally test what affect
length of follow-up had on the accuracy of the test. The various
contributors to the heterogeneity across the studies may affect the
study results. Given the poor reporting within the included stud-
ies, it is difficult to determine the underlying difference or dif-
ferences among the included studies. This highlights a shortfall
of large-scale, high-quality empirical research conducted in this
area. Future studies should provide clearer reporting of the partic-
ipants, equipment, usage and the implications of implementing
the tests. As the current research area is rapidly changing, further
research exploring the impact of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio on
clinical outcomes is needed. To this end, we conducted a very re-
cent literature review which revealed four new studies that will be
fully incorporated in our next planned update. These four studies
demonstrated the same between-study heterogeneity in results and
methodology that we had observed in the included studies, with
the implication that there will not be an impact of incorporation
on our existing conclusions.
Applicability of findings to the review question
These findings can be considered a reasonable answer to the ques-
tion being set in this review. Caution, though, should still ap-
ply because of the quality and reporting issues highlighted from
the included papers and the small data set. This is especially true
when drawing conclusions from the analysis of the p-tau/ABeta
ratio. This is particularly important as it this ratio that is often
favoured in clinical practice as being most accurate. However, this
review and the previous published reviews of amyloid tests and
Alzheimer’s disease pathology consistently demonstrate reasonable
sensitivity and poor specificity; accordingly, it is likely that the
ratio of two sensitive tests will generate greater sensitivity than
specificity.

Implications for practice
The principal conclusion from our review is that of ongoing un-
certainty regarding the true value of these tests in the management
of people with prodromal dementia or MCI.
The use of and access to lumbar punctures (LP) in dementia clin-
ics varies greatly between and within countries. The test is usu-
ally straightforward with only very occasional side effects, such as
headache. However, acceptability of an LP by patients and carers
alsovariesgreatlyandmayreflectthe viewsof the clinicianspropos-
ing their use and their perspective on the value of the test diagnos-
tically. In the context of the new diagnostic criteria being used for
prodromal Alzheimer’s dementia (Dubois 2014), the tests studied
here have been used as being indicative of Alzheimer’s pathology.
The data from this review suggests that a negative CSF test, in peo-
ple with MCI, is likely to reflect the absence of Alzheimer’s disease
pathology as the aetiology of their clinical symptoms. However, in
CSF sampling for ABeta and tau levels, a positive result does very
little to indicate the presence of Alzheimer’s disease as the aetiol-
ogy of their clinical symptoms. In the new National Institute on

CSF tau and the CSF tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild

 Aging and Alzheimer Association criteria (Albert 2011), the pres-
ence of abnormally high t-tau/p-tau or low ABeta is thought to
indicate MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease. This is not supported by
this or previous reports. What is more consistent with our findings
is that, in the presence of normal levels of CSF t-tau/p-tau and
ABeta, we can say MCI is not due to Alzheimer’s disease. This is
an important distinction and one that has important implications
when conveying risk of progression to people with MCI, as well
as when giving pretest counselling to people before the test takes
place. The positive and negative likelihood ratios we have gener-
ated as illustrations of our findings do demonstrate that positive
and negative tests do have a small change from pre- to post-test
probability. However, they are relatively small and way below what
would be expected from standard thresholds for a good test. The
language used in new criteria do not reflect this level of uncertainty
or small incremental benefit, and therefore confer much greater
diagnostic accuracy on these tests than is currently merited. Our
review suggests that where these tests are used to assist clinical di-
agnosis, their limitations and low incremental benefit should be
considered. In the absence currently of any disease modifying in-
terventions, the risk of overdiagnosis to a patient may do greater
harm than underdiagnosis. However, this is a rapidly moving field
and if disease-modifying or secondary prevention interventions
become available, then this opinion will shift, more so if the in-
terventions are effective, low cost and well tolerated.
Implications for research
These tests though still have value in clinical trials with drugs pro-
posed to affect the Alzheimer’s disease process where normal levels
should be used to exclude subjects from the trial with the knowl-
edge that many individuals with ’positive’ tests who are entered in
to the study will still not progress to Alzheimer’s disease dementia.
Moreover, there may well be an interaction between test results,
diagnosis, and stage of illness. For instance, abnormalities in these
tests may be more specific if noted in younger people with no
or minimal symptoms as opposed to older, symptomatic people
where they may be reflections of nonspecific neurodegeneration,
ageing or physiological reactions to ABeta oligomerisation ( plaque
formation). Only by undertaking longitudinal studies in mid-life,
preclinical populations can we answer that proposition; these types
of studies are ongoing. It is also the case that several initiatives to
collate data from across numerous cohort studies are commenc-
ing. These include Dementia Platform UK and the IMI-funded
European Medicines Informatic Framework ( EMIF) ( http://
www.emif.eu; http://www.dementiasplatform.uk) and European
Prevention of Alzheimer’s Dementia (EPAD) (Ritchie 2016) pro-
gramme that will deliver analyses of source-aggregated data that
will, in most cases, have been collected under standardised condi-
tions, as well as (in the case of EPAD) developing a new longitu-
dinal cohort which will provide at least ten-fold increase in sam-
ple size for predementia disease modelling (Ritchie 2016). New
cohort data are also being regularly published, especially as extant
cohorts undergo further assessments. Together this suggests that
as a rapidly moving field, this review will need to be updated on a
regular basis and will include data from preclinical (asymptomatic)
as well as MCI populations.

Study characteristics
Patient sampling
Study design: nested case-control study with a delayed verification design
Prospective MCI group of 49 participants with MCI, who attended a university-based memory
clinic, was recruited consecutively between 2005 and 2009. Twenty-three control subjects were
also recruited. We only included data on performance of the index test to discriminate between
participants with MCI who converted to dementia and those who remained stable
Exclusion criteria: psychiatric disorder, anoxic brain damage, cancer, drug abuse, or cognitive symp-
toms related to solvent exposure
Patient characteristics and set-
ting
39 MCI participants diagnosed by the Petersen 1991 criteria were included in the analysis. Ten
MCI participants did not have a follow-up assessment
GENDER: 20 men; 19 women
AGE (y): MCI with abnormal CSF t-tau level: 64 (range 45 to 76); MC with normal CSF t-tau
level: 58.5 (45 to 77)
APOE ǫ4 carrier (%): not reported
MMSE: MCI with abnormal CSF t-tau level: 27.2 (range 25 to 29); MC with normal CSF t-tau
level: 27.9 (23 to 30)
Education (y): MCI with abnormal CSF t-tau level: 12.2 (range 7 to 18); MC with normal CSF t-
tau level: 11.8 (8 to 16)
Sources of referral: not reported
Sources of recruitment: a university-based memory clinic, Oslo, Norway.
Index tests
CSF t-tau
Participants underwent lumbar puncture as part of the clinical evaluation. The CSF samples were
examined for total tau levels with commercially available kits (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium)
Threshold: This was prespecified. The age-dependent criteria for pathologic values were based on
a large sample of healthy control subjects and were as follows: total tau of 300 ng/L or higher for
age younger than 50 years, total tau of 450 ng/L or higher for age 50 to 69 years, and total tau of
500 ng/L or higher for age older than 70 years (Sjogren 2001). The 0.90 fractile was estimated to
establish reference values for CSF t-tau
Not reported whether the index test results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the
reference standard
Target condition and reference
standard(s)
Target condition: conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
Reference standard: The Global Deterioration Scale (Reisberg 1982) in combination with the
research criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, International Working group (Dubois 2007)
Not reported whether clinicians conducting follow-up were aware of CSF t-tau results
Flow and timing
Duration of follow-up: mean 2.6 ± 0.54 years
At baseline: 49 MCI participants had CSF sample
At follow-up: 39 participants: 9 MCI with abnormal baseline CF t-tau: 5 MCI converters and
4 MCI nonconverters; 30 MCI with normal baseline CSF t-tau: 4 MCI converters and 26 MCI
nonconverters (information from the author)

sensitivity = 55%; specificity = 87% (calculated in Revman5)
Loss to follow-up
N = 17 participants (10 MCI and 7 controls) did not have a follow-up assessment. Between baseline
and follow-up, four participants with MCI objected to re-examination, one died of unrelated causes,
and five were excluded because of definite other diagnoses. Seven control subjects objected to re-
examination. All 39 MCI participants with the follow-up assessment were included in the analysis

Study characteristics
Patient sampling
Study design: prospective cohort study
The inclusion of 137 participants was described in the paper by Hansson 2006, as below:
180 participants with MCI, who had sought medical advice for subjective memory difficulties,
were consecutively recruited at a university hospital between July 1998 and June. Thirty-six healthy
controls were also included, but appeared to have been used for comparison purposes only and not
included in the ROC analysis. CSF was obtained at baseline from 137 MCI participants. Of the 43
participants with MCI who did not undergo successful lumbar puncture at baseline, 32 preferred
not to go through the procedure and in 11 the procedure did not deliver usable CSF
Participants with other causes of cognitive impairment, including brain tumour, subdural
haematoma, CNS infection, and current alcohol abuse, were excluded
Buchhave 2012 and Hansson 2006 studies used the same cohort.

Study design: retrospective analysis of the longitudinal data
Retrospective recruitment of 42 participants with MCI from the Gothenborg study: 21 MCI con-
verters and 21 MCI-stable participants. The group of MCI converters comprised all MCI con-
verters who underwent a baseline MRI investigation. The MCI-stable participants were included
consecutively to achieve matching group size. No further details
Twenty-six controls were also recruited. We only included data on performance of the index test to
discriminate between participants with MCI who converted to dementia and those who remained
stable
Exclusion criteria: not reported.

Index tests
CSF t-tau
CSF samples were collected by lumbar puncture (LP). Both baseline and follow-up lumbar punctures
were performed in the morning to exclude influences on the results from possible diurnal fluctuations
in biomarker levels. The samples
were collected in polypropylene tubes that were stored at -80 °C, without being thawed and re-
frozen, pending biochemical analyses. All CSF analyses for a participant were performed on the
same occasion. CSF levels were determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
constructed to measure tau
Threshold: 500 ng/L, not prespecified. ROC curves were used to calculate the cutoff values based
on the maximum for the sum of sensitivity and specificity
It was not reported whether the index test results were interpreted without knowledge of the results
of the reference standard

Index tests
CSF p-tau
Method of the index test administration described previously (Fellgiebel 2004). CSF was analysed
with two sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays: Tau protein phosphorylated at threonine
181 (p-tau181) was determined using the Innogenetics INNOTEST Phospho-Tau(181) kit and
total tau protein (t-tau) was examined with the INNOTEST-hTau-Ag kit
Threshold: Besides the previous published p-tau181 cutoff (Fellgiebel 2004), the cutoff value of
50 pg/mL was chosen as an optimal cutoff by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
analyses to separate participants with MCI from controls (measures in 75 participants, unpublished
data)
Not reported whether the index test results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the

Study characteristics
Patient sampling
Study design: nested case-control study with a delayed verification design
Prospective cohort of 180 participants with MCI, who had sought medical advice for subjective
memory difficulties, was consecutively recruited at a university hospital between July 1998 and
June 2001. 39 healthy controls were also included, but appeared to have been used for comparison
purposes only and not included in the ROC analysis
Patients with other causes of cognitive impairment, including brain tumour, subdural haematoma,
CNS infection, and current alcohol abuse, were excluded
Patient characteristics and set-

137 MCI participants, diagnosed by the Petersen 1999 and Petersen 2004 criteria, underwent
successful lumbar puncture. Baseline demographic data reported for 134 participants. Of the 43
participants with MCI who did not undergo successful lumbar puncture at baseline, 32 preferred
not to go through the procedure and in 11 the procedure did not deliver usable CSF

CSF t-tau; CSF p-tau; CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio
CSF samples were obtained and stored in polypropylene tubes at -80ºC, and analysed after the
clinical follow-up of the study was completed
T-tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181), and ABeta42 concentrations were measured
with xMAP technology and the INNOBIA AkzBio3 kit (innogenetics), as previously described
in detail (Olssson 2005). The CSF concentrations of t-tau, p-tau181, and ABeta42 were highly
correlated to the concentrations obtained with conventional ELISA measurements. The best cutting
values for the different combinations of the CSF biomarkers were established in the whole control
and MCI patient material as those giving the highest Youden index (Youden 1950)

Study characteristics
Patient sampling
Study design: nested case-control study with delay verification design.
Participants examined in a university hospital neurological department, or from an ongoing pop-
ulation-based study were prospectively recruited if they agreed to a lumbar puncture for research
purposes and had a baseline diagnosis of MCI; 79 participants met these criteria. 60 controls (who
were referred to the neurological department for different symptoms, or who were included in the
population-based study and had depression with normal performance in neuropsychological tests)
were also included. We only included data on performance of the index test to discriminate between
participants with MCI who converted to dementia and those who remained stable
No exclusion criteria were specified.

CSF t-tau; CSF p-tau; CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio
CSF was collected at baseline in polypropylene tubes and gently mixed to avoid gradient effects.
All samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes at +4 uC at 2000 g for 10 min to remove cells and
debris. Samples were stored in aliquots at -80 oC pending biochemical analysis. The procedure used
and the analysis of the CSF followed the Alzheimer’s Association Flow Chart for lumbar puncture
(Blennow 2010) . The Luminex xMAP technology was used to determine the levels of tau, ABeta42
and p-tau (Ollson 2005). In addition to tau, ABeta42 and p-tau, the ratio of ABeta42/tau was tested
as a separate variable in the logistic regression models since it previously had shown high predictive
accuracy in this cohort (Hertze 2010) . Lumbar puncture was only conducted at the initial visit

Patient sampling
Study design: nested case-control study with a delayed verification design
Prospective group of participants with SCI, naMCI and aMCI were recruited from 20 memory
clinics across Europe, between January 2003 and June 2005, into the prospective DESCRIPA cohort
study. Neurologically healthy controls were also recruited. Sampling procedure for a MCI cohort
not described. We only included data on performance of the index test to discriminate between
participants with MCI who converted to dementia and those who remained stable
Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of dementia or any somatic, psychiatric, or neurological disorder
that might have caused the cognitive impairment
Patient characteristics and set-
ting
168/193 participants from the DESCRIPA cohort with an available CSF baseline sample were
included in the study. The data overlapped with the data from the Vos 2013 paper. However, we
considered different CSF biomarkers in those two studies

Study characteristics
Patient sampling
Study design: prospective cohort study
399 participants with aMCI and 226 participants with naMCI from the DESCRIPA cohort and
Alzheimer Centre of the VU University medical centre (VUmc). DESCRIPA is a European multi-
centre study performed in a memory clinic setting and enrolled subjects between 2003 and 2005.
For this study, 431 eligible subjects were selected from 16 participating centres in which CSF was
collected, MRI was performed, or APOE genotype was determined. The VUmc centre was one of
the DESCRIPA centres and contributed an additional sample of 194 subjects that were seen outside
the DESCRIPA inclusion period with data on CSF, MRI, or APOE measures. No differences in
biomarkers were found between subjects from the VUmc centre in the DESCRIPA study and those
from the additional VUmc sample. The sampling procedure was not described
Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of dementia at baseline or any other somatic, psychiatric or neu-
rological disorder that might have caused the cognitive impairment
Patient characteristics and set-
ting
231/635 had available CSF data and were included in the review. 214/235 MCI participants,
diagnosed by Petersen 2004 criteria at baseline, had a least one follow-up assessment. Baseline
demographic data reported on all 625 participants. There was some data overlap with the data from
the Visser 2009 paper. However, we considered different CSF biomarkers from those two studies
Gender: 270 men; 335 women
Age: 70.7 ± 7.6 years naMCI; 70.7 ± 7.8 aMCI
MMSE: 27.5 ± 2.1 naMCI; 26.5 ± 2.5 aMCI
Sources of recruitment: European multicentre memory clinics
Index tests
CSF t-tau; CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio
CSF was collected by lumbar puncture, centrifuged, and stored at -80 °C in polypropylene tubes.
Three samples were thawed twice but analyses without these samples revealed similar results. CSF
ABeta1-42 and total tau (t-tau) were measured by experienced technicians using commercially
available sandwich ELISAs (Innotest ABeta-amyloid 1-42; Innotest hTAU-Ag; Innogenetics, Ghent,
Belgium), specially constructed to measure ABeta-amyloid 1-42 and t-tau, at the lab in Gothenburg
for the DESCRIPA cohort and in Amsterdam for the additional subjects of the VUmc cohort.
We corrected for inter-laboratory ELISA differences by analysing 33 samples at both labs and we
adjusted VUmc values to those of DESCRIPA using the following formula: Gothenborg = (SD
Gothenborg/SD VUmc) * VUmc + average Gothenborg - ((SD Gothenborg/SD VUmc) * average
VUmc)
Threshold (positive test): CSF t-tau: > 450 pg/mL for age less than 70 years; > 500 pg/mL for age
older than 70 years;
CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio: ABeta1-42/(240 1 [1.18 3 t-tau])

Notes:Mattson 2009 is important and one of the single most defining studies in the field. However, we were not able to include it in
our review because there was an overlap between participants in the Mattsson 2009 paper and participants assessed in the seven studies
included in our review: Buchhave 2012; Eckerstrom 2010; Hansson 2006; Herukka 2007; Kester 2011; Palmqvist 2012; Visser 2009;
therefore, we identified this paper as a ‘multiple publication’ and added it to those seven studies

130 participants with amnestic MCI will be included in an updated review. Diagnostic criteria for
amnestic MCI: subjective memory impairment and objective memory impairment identical to that
for AD; a CDR of 0.5 including the memory box score of 0.5 or greater, and a MMSE score between
24 and 30; unimpaired general cognitive ability; functional performance such that participants with
MCI did not meet criteria for dementia

CSF samples were obtained via lumbar puncture (LP) which was performed under non-fasting
conditions, between 8 and 11 a.m., with a total of 10 mL of CSF collected. After discarding the first
0.5 mL, samples were centrifuged at 1500 × g (3000 to 4000 rpm) for 10 min at +4 ºC. Samples
were then stored at -80 ºC in 1 mL portions pending biochemical analysis, without being thawed or
refrozen. Levels of CSF biomarkers were determined using commercially available sandwich ELISAs
(Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium)
Note: For the MCI group, levels of ABeta1-42 and t-tau were obtained for all subjects, with p-

Appendix 1. Sources searched and search strategies
The MEDLINE search strategy below was created to optimise sensitivity. The strategy utilises a number of concepts:
Concept A: lines 1 to 21 health condition/s of interest
Concept B: lines 23 to 42 what is being measured by the index test/s/the index test/s
Concept C: lines 44 to 49 method of measurement (i.e. CSF)
The main yield is created by combining A AND B AND C
However, in order to try to capture those records that perhaps do not mention one or more of the three concepts above, some additional
combinations were added to the strategy. For example: In the MEDLINE strategy below, lines 51 and 52 (which identify records in
Medline with the dementia MeSH subheading of diagnosis and those with a subheading of cerebrospinal fluid) were combined with
the concept for the index test(s). This approach identified unique records and an examination of the first 50 of these records resulted
in two further citations for possible inclusion within the review.

Anchoring statements for quality assessment CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio
We provide some core anchoring statements for quality assessment of diagnostic test accuracy review of CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta
ratio biomarkers in dementia. These statements are designed for use with the QUADAS-2 tool and are based on the guidance for
quality assessment of diagnostic test accuracy reviews of IQCODE in dementia (Quinn 2014).
During a two-day, multidisciplinary focus group and the piloting/validation of the guidance, it was clear that certain issues were key
to assessing quality, while other issues were important to record but less important for assessing overall quality. To assist, we describe
a ’weighting’ system. Where an item is weighted ’high risk’ then that section of the QUADAS-2 results table is likely to be scored as
’high risk of bias’. For example, in dementia diagnostic test accuracy studies, ensuring that clinicians performing dementia assessment
are blinded to results of index test is fundamental. If this blinding was not present, then the item on the reference standard should be
scored ’high risk of bias’, regardless of the other contributory elements.
In assessing individual items, the score of ’unclear’ should only be given if there is genuine uncertainty. In these situations, review
authors will contact the relevant study teams for additional information.
Anchoring statements to assist with assessment for risk of bias
Patient selection
Was the sampling method appropriate?
Where sampling is used, the designs least likely to cause bias are consecutive sampling or random sampling. Sampling that is based on volunteers
or selecting subjects from a clinic or research resource is prone to bias.
Weighting: High risk of bias (‘no’)
Was a case-control or similar design avoided?

cognitive impairment (MCI) (Review)

 Designs similar to case-control that may introduce bias are those designs in which the study team deliberately increase or decrease the proportion
of subjects with the target condition, which may not be representative. For example, a population study may be enriched with extra dementia
subjects from a secondary care setting, who are typically more diseased. Some case-control methods may already be excluded if they mix subjects
from various settings.
Weighting: High risk of bias (‘no’)
Are exclusion criteria described and appropriate?
The study will be automatically graded as unclear if exclusions are not detailed (pending contact with study authors). Where exclusions are
detailed, the study will be graded as ’low risk’ if exclusions are felt to be appropriate by the review authors. Certain exclusions common
to many studies of dementia are: medical instability; terminal disease; alcohol/substance misuse; concomitant psychiatric diagnosis; other
neurodegenerative condition. Exclusions are not felt to be appropriate if ‘difficult to diagnose’ participants are excluded.
Post hoc and inappropriate exclusions will be labelled ’high risk’ of bias.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)
Index test
Was CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers’ assessment/interpretation performed without knowledge of clinical dementia
diagnosis?
Terms such as ’blinded’ or ’independently and without knowledge of’ are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not required.
Interpretation of the results of the index test may be influenced by knowledge of the results of reference standard. If the index test is always
interpreted prior to the reference standard, then the person interpreting the index test cannot be aware of the results of the reference standard
and so this item could be rated as ‘yes’.
For certain index tests the result is objective and knowledge of reference standard should not influence result, for example level of protein in
cerebrospinal fluid, in this instance the quality assessment may be ’low risk’ even if blinding was not achieved.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)
Were CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers’ thresholds prespecified?
For scales and biomarkers there is often a reference point (in units or categories) above which subjects are classified as ’test positive’; this may
be referred to as threshold; clinical cutoff or dichotomisation point. A study is classified ’high risk of bias’ if the authors define the optimal cut-
off post-hoc based on their own study data because selecting the threshold to maximise sensitivity and/specificity may lead to overoptimistic
measures of test performance.
Certain papers may use an alternative methodology for analysis that does not use thresholds and these papers should be classified as not applicable.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)
Reference standard
Is the assessment used for clinical diagnosis of dementia acceptable?
Commonly used international criteria to assist with clinical diagnosis of dementia include those detailed in DSM-IV and ICD-10. Criteria
specific to dementia subtypes include but are not limited to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia; McKeith criteria for Lewy
Body dementia; Lund criteria for frontotemporal dementias; and the NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular dementia. Where the criteria used
for assessment is not familiar to the review authors or the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement group (‘unclear’), this item should
be classified as ’high risk of bias’.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)
Was clinical assessment for dementia performed without knowledge of the CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers?
Terms such as ’blinded’ or ’independently and without knowledge of’ are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not required.
Interpretation of the results of the reference standard may be influenced by knowledge of the results of index test.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)
Patient flow
Was there an appropriate interval between CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers and clinical dementia assessment?
As we test the accuracy of the CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers for MCI conversion to dementia, there will always be a delay
between the index test and the reference standard assessments. The time between reference standard and index test will influence the accuracy
(Geslani 2005; Okello 2009; Visser 2006), and therefore we will note time as a separate variable (both within and between studies) and
will test its influence on the diagnostic accuracy. We have set a minimum mean time to follow-up assessment of one year. If more than 16% of
subjects of subjects have assessment for MCI conversion before nine months this item will score ‘no’.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)

cognitive impairment (MCI) (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Did all subjects get the same assessment for dementia regardless of CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers?
There may be scenarios where subjects who score ’test positive’ on index test have a more detailed assessment. Where dementia assessment differs
between subjects, this should be classified as ’high risk of bias’.
Weighting: High risk (’no’)
Were all participants who received CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers’ assessment included in the final analysis?
If the number of participants enrolled differs from the number of participants included in the 2 X 2table, then there is the potential for bias.
If participants lost to dropout differ systematically from those who remain, then estimates of test performance may differ.
If dropouts, these should be accounted for; a maximum proportion of dropouts to remain ’low risk of bias’ has been specified as 20%.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’)
Were missing or uninterpretable CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers results reported?
Where missing or uninterpretable results are reported, and if there is substantial attrition (we have set an arbitrary value of 50% missing data);
this should be scored as ‘no’. If those results are not reported, this should be scored as ‘unclear’ and authors will be contacted.
Weighting: High risk (‘no’ and ‘unclear’)
Anchoring statements to assist with assessment for applicability
Patient selection
Were included participants representative of the general population of interest?
The included participants should match the intended population as described in the review question. The review authors should consider
population in terms of: symptoms; pretesting; potential disease prevalence; setting.
If there is a clear ground for suspecting an unrepresentative spectrum the item should be rated ’poor applicability’.
Index test
Were sufficient data on CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers’ application given for the test to be repeated in an independent
study?
Variation in technology, test execution, and test interpretation may affect estimate of accuracy. In addition, the background, and training/
expertise of the assessor should be reported and taken in consideration. If CSF tau and CSF tau/ABeta ratio biomarkers were not performed
consistently, this item should be rated ’poor applicability’.
Reference standard
Was clinical diagnosis of dementia made in a manner similar to current clinical practice?
For many reviews, inclusion criteria and assessment for risk of bias will already have assessed the dementia diagnosis. For certain reviews,
an applicability statement relating to reference standard may not be applicable. There is the possibility that a form of dementia assessment,
although valid, may diagnose a far larger proportion of subjects with disease than usual clinical practice. In this instance, the item should be
rated ’poor applicability’.

In our published protocol (Ritchie 2011), we stated that the minimum period of delay in the verification of the diagnosis (i.e. the time
between the assessment at which a diagnosis of MCI is made and the assessment at which the diagnosis of dementia is made) was one
year. In the preparation of the review, this criterion was not followed and we did not put limits on the length of duration of follow-up.
With respect to Investigation of heterogeneity, we planned to formally investigate the following, but these assessments of the sources
of heterogeneity were not undertaken:
• Criteria used for definition of cognitive impairment
• Reference standards
• Participant sampling
• Index tests methodology used
• Duration of follow up and
We also planned to perform a sensitivity analysis for the individual quality items., but we were not able to do it, due to the small
number of studies included.
