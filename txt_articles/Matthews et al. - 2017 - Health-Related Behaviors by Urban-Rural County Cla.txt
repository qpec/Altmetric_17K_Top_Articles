Abstract
Problem/Condition: Persons living in rural areas are recognized as a health disparity population because the prevalence of disease and rate 
of premature death are higher than for the overall population of the United States. Surveillance data about health-related behaviors are rarely 
reported by urban-rural status, which makes comparisons difficult among persons living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties.
Reporting Period: 2013.
Description of System: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-
dialed landline- and cellular-telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years residing in the United States. BRFSS 
collects data on health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, access to health care, and use of preventive health services 
related to the leading causes of death and disability. BRFSS data were analyzed for 398,208 adults aged ≥18 years to estimate the 
prevalence of five self-reported health-related behaviors (sufficient sleep, current nonsmoking, nondrinking or moderate drinking, 
maintaining normal body weight, and meeting aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations) by urban-rural status. 
For this report, rural is defined as the noncore counties described in the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural 
Classification Scheme for Counties.
Results: Approximately one third of U.S. adults practice at least four of these five behaviors. Compared with adults living in the four 
types of metropolitan counties (large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, and small metropolitan), 
adults living in the two types of nonmetropolitan counties (micropolitan and noncore) did not differ in the prevalence of sufficient 
sleep; had higher prevalence of nondrinking or moderate drinking; and had lower prevalence of current nonsmoking, maintaining 
normal body weight, and meeting aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations. The overall age-adjusted prevalence of 
reporting at least four of the five health-related behaviors was 30.4%. The prevalence among the estimated 13.3 million adults living 
in noncore counties was lower (27.0%) than among those in micropolitan counties (28.8%), small metropolitan counties (29.5%), 
medium metropolitan counties (30.5%), large fringe metropolitan counties (30.2%), and large metropolitan centers (31.7%).
Interpretation: This is the first report of the prevalence of these five health-related behaviors for the six urban-rural categories. 
Nonmetropolitan counties have lower prevalence of three and clustering of at least four health-related behaviors that are associated with 
the leading chronic disease causes of death. Prevalence of sufficient sleep was consistently low and did not differ by urban-rural status.
Public Health Action: Chronic disease prevention efforts focus on improving the communities, schools, worksites, and health 
systems in which persons live, learn, work, and play. Evidence-based strategies to improve health-related behaviors in the population 
of the United States can be used to reach the Healthy People 2020 objectives for these five self-reported health-related behaviors 
(sufficient sleep, current nonsmoking, nondrinking or moderate drinking, maintaining normal body weight, and meeting aerobic 
leisure time physical activity recommendations). These findings 
suggest an ongoing need to increase public awareness and public 
education, particularly in rural counties where prevalence of 
these health-related behaviors is lowest.

Introduction
Health-related behaviors can extend longevity by preventing 
chronic disease and injury (1). Rural populations face many 
challenges in adopting these behaviors. The low population 
density in rural areas makes it difficult to deliver services and 
provide needed health communications about the benefits of 
adopting these behaviors. Less than 10% of the health care 
workforce practice in rural settings. Accessing the health care 
that is available can be difficult because rural residents have 
lower incomes and lower rates of health insurance compared 
with their urban counterparts, and they live farther away from 
health care resources (2).
In a recent study of U.S. adults aged ≥21 years who 
responded to the 2013 Behavioral Risk Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) questionnaire, 64% reported sleeping ≥7 hours 
per day, 82% were current nonsmokers, 63% reported 
moderate or no alcohol consumption, 32% had normal body 
weight, and 50% met aerobic leisure time physical activity 
recommendations; 24% reported four and 6% reported all five 
health-related behaviors (3). The highest estimates of engaging 
in four or five health-related behaviors clustered in the Pacific 
and Rocky Mountain states and the lowest estimates clustered 
in the southern states and along the Ohio River (3).
Despite improvements in the overall health of the American 
people, racial/ethnic minorities and other populations 
experience disproportionately the prevalence of illness and 
rates of premature death. These populations are referred to 
as health disparity populations. The National Institutes of 
Health also recognizes persons living in rural areas as a health 
disparity population because their prevalence of disease and rate 
of premature death are higher than for the overall population 
of the United States (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/docs/2009-
2013nih_health_disparities_strategic_plan_and_budget.
pdf). The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research 
and Education Act of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106-525, 114 Stat. 
2495) defines a population as a health disparity population if 
the director of the National Center on Minority Health and 
Health Disparities, after consultation with the director of 
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, determines 
there is a significant disparity in the overall rate of disease 
incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, or survival in the 
population as compared with the health status of the general 
population. As such, racial and ethnic minorities, persons with 
low socioeconomic status, and persons living in rural areas are 
designated as health disparity populations.
Rural and urban areas can be defined in many ways (4), but 
few surveillance systems have provided adequate sample sizes 
to allow comparisons of health-related behaviors in the U.S. 
population beyond urban versus rural or metropolitan versus 
nonmetropolitan status (5–9). The 2013 National Center for 
Health Statistics (NCHS) Urban-Rural Classification Scheme 
for Counties uses 2010 census data to assign each U.S. county 
to one of six (four metropolitan, one micropolitan, and one 
noncore) urban-rural classes (10). NCHS uses noncore and 
rural interchangeably; noncore counties are defined as the 
nonmetropolitan counties that are not micropolitan. On the 
basis of that classification, the majority (85.2%) of the total U.S. 
population live in metropolitan counties, followed by 8.7% in 
micropolitan and 6.1% in noncore counties (10). Findings in a 
2014 report on rural health, which categorized U.S. counties into 
five urban-rural levels according to a 2006 NCHS classification 
scheme (2) and 2000 U.S. census data, indicated that during 
2010–2011, estimated prevalence for cigarette smoking, obesity, 
and physical inactivity was higher in nonmetropolitan than 
in metropolitan counties (2). In contrast, the prevalence of 
consuming ≥5 drinks in 1 day did not vary by rural-urban level 
nationwide but was lower in the nonmetropolitan counties in the 
South and was higher in nonmetropolitan than in metropolitan 
counties in the West (2).
This report assesses the total number and prevalence of 
five health-related behaviors by NCHS urban-rural county 
classification using 2013 BRFSS data. The findings can be used 
by local health care providers and public health professionals 
to develop effective strategies for communicating to their 
patients and constituencies the importance of adopting these 
healthy behaviors.
Methods
Information about five selected self-reported health-related 
behaviors was analyzed from the 2013 BRFSS, which is an 
annual state-based, random-digit-dialed landline- and cellular-
telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population 
aged ≥18 years (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/
annual_2013.html). BRFSS data are weighted to represent 
state populations. The 2013 BRFSS is the most recent year for 
which the survey questionnaire had questions for both sleep 
and aerobic physical activity in addition to cigarette smoking, 
alcohol consumption, and height and weight. Response rates 
for BRFSS are calculated using standards set by the American 
Association for Public Opinion Research response rate formula 4 
(www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/publications/Standard-
Definitions20169theditionfinal.pdf). The response rate is 
the number of respondents who completed the survey as a 
proportion of all eligible and likely eligible persons. In 2013, 
the median survey response rate for all states and the District 
of Columbia was 46.4 and ranged from 29.0 to 60.3 (https://
www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2013/pdf/2013_DQR.pdf).

The five selected self-reported health-related behaviors 
(sufficient sleep, current nonsmoking, nondrinking or moderate 
drinking, maintaining normal body weight, and meeting 
aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations) are 
included as objectives in Healthy People 2020 (https://www.
healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives). The total number 
and prevalence of these behaviors were analyzed using the 
NCHS 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties, 
which uses 2010 census population data and the February 
2013 Office of Management and Budget designations of 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA), micropolitan statistical 
area, or noncore area (9). This classification system assigns 
each county in the United States to one of the six following 
categories: 1) large central metropolitan (county within an 
MSA with ≥1 million population that also contains the entire 
population of the largest principal city in the MSA, has the 
entire county population contained in the largest principal city, 
or contains at least 250,000 population of any principal city 
in the MSA); 2) large fringe metropolitan (county in MSA of 
≥1 million population that did not qualify as a large central 
metropolitan county); 3) medium metropolitan (county in 
MSA with 250,000–999,999 population); small metropolitan 
(county in MSA with <250,000 population), micropolitan 
(county in an area that comprises non-MSA counties but has an 
urban cluster of 10,000–49,999 population, contains outlying 
counties that meet specified requirements for commuting to 
or from central counties, or both); and noncore (county in a 
nonmetropolitan area that did not qualify as micropolitan and 
might be thought of as rural) (9). Of the 3,143 U.S. counties 
identified in 2013, 2.1% were large central metropolitan, 
11.7% were large fringe metropolitan, 11.9% were medium 
metropolitan, 11.4% were small metropolitan, 20.4% were 
micropolitan, and 42.5% were noncore counties (10).
One of six levels of urban-rural classification was identified 
for the county of residence for each respondent. County-level 
identifiers for BRFSS respondents are not publically available. 
To match a respondent to their urban-rural class, a special data 
set with the county identified for each BRFSS respondent 
was obtained through a data use agreement. Comparisons by 
urban-rural classification of the prevalence of having four or 
five health-related behaviors were also assessed by age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, and self-reported education.
Sufficient sleep was defined for an average sleep duration 
during a 24-hour period as ≥8 hours for adults aged 18–21 years 
and ≥7 hours for those aged ≥22 years. Current nonsmokers 
included adults who never smoked, as well as adults who 
had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but did 
not report smoking at the time of the survey; persons who 
had stopped smoking for health reasons were included. 
Nondrinking or moderate drinking was defined for adults 
who drank no alcohol or drank alcohol in moderation during 
the preceding 30 days. Moderate drinking was defined as 
drinking up to two alcoholic drinks per day for men and up 
to one drink per day for women among respondents who also 
did not report binge drinking (≥5 drinks on one occasion for 
men or ≥4 drinks for women) or heavy drinking (≥15 drinks 
per week for men or ≥8 drinks per week for women) during the 
preceding 30 days (https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/
guidelines/appendix-9). Normal body weight was defined as 
body mass index of 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 that was calculated from 
self-reported height and weight (https://www.healthypeople.
gov/2020/topics-objectives/). Meeting the aerobic leisure 
time physical activity recommendations was defined as at 
least 150 minutes per week of moderate leisure time physical 
activity, 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical 
activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate and 
vigorous physical activity in the preceding 30 days (https://
health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/). Unlike an earlier CDC 
report on the prevalence of the five health-related behaviors 
(1), analyses were not restricted to respondents aged ≥21 years; 
therefore, for respondents aged 18–20 years, the nondrinking 
or moderate drinking measure only included those who 
reported nondrinking because any alcohol consumption would 
be illegal. The prevalence of the five health-related behaviors 
was stratified by sex, age group (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 
55–64, 65–74, or ≥75 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska 
Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, multiracial 
non-Hispanic, or other unspecified race), and educational 
attainment (less than high school graduate, high school 
graduate, or some college).
In 2013, BRFSS had 483,865 adult respondents in the 
50 states and the District of Columbia. The final sample size 
was 398,208 (82.4%) adults aged ≥18 years who lived in 
3,131 (99.6%) of the 3,143 U.S. counties; the sample size was 
determined after 2,971 pregnant women, who would be unable 
to maintain normal body weight, and 85,657 respondents, who 
had incomplete information for any of the five behaviors or 
age, were excluded. After assignment of each respondent to an 
urban-rural classification, sample sizes ranged from 53,000 to 
87,000 in each of the six urban-rural categories; approximately 
63,000 lived in the micropolitan and noncore counties.
The total number (0−5) of health-related behaviors was 
calculated for each respondent and unadjusted, weighted 
distributions were obtained for each urban-rural classification 
category. The age-adjusted prevalence and 95% confidence 
interval for each health-related behavior and for having four or 
five of the behaviors was calculated by urban-rural classification 
levels and selected characteristics and were adjusted to the 2000 
standard population (11). For comparisons of prevalence among

subgroups, statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined by 
t-tests. Estimates with relative standard error ≥ 30% or n < 50 
were deemed unreliable and are not included. The statistical 
software program SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11.0.1 (RTI 
International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA), 
which accounts for the complex sampling design of BRFSS, 
was used for the analyses.
Results
In 2013, adults aged ≥18 years who were living in noncore 
counties had the lowest age-adjusted prevalence of current 
nonsmoking, maintaining normal body weight, and meeting 
aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations and 
the highest prevalence of nondrinking or moderate drinking 
compared with adults living in metropolitan and micropolitan 
counties (Table 1). Adults living in micropolitan counties also 
had lower prevalence of current nonsmoking, maintaining 
normal body weight, and meeting aerobic leisure time 
physical activity recommendations and higher prevalence 
of nondrinking or moderate drinking than those living in 
metropolitan counties. The lowest prevalence of nondrinking 
or moderate drinking was reported among adults living in large 
fringe metropolitan counties and large metropolitan centers. 
Sufficient sleep did not differ by urban-rural classification. 
Among adults living in noncore counties, about one third of 
respondents (35.0%) reported having three of the five health-
related behaviors.
In 2013, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of reporting at 
least four of the five health-related behaviors was 30.4%. The 
lowest age-adjusted prevalence was observed among adults 
in noncore counties (27.0%) compared with those living in 
large metropolitan centers (31.7%), large fringe metropolitan 
counties (30.2%), medium metropolitan counties (30.5%), 
small metropolitan counties (29.5%), and micropolitan 
counties (28.8%) (Table 2). Regardless of urban-rural status, 
reporting of four or five health-related behaviors occurred 
more frequently among women than among men; among 
people aged ≥65 years compared with persons in younger 
age groups; and among persons with greater educational 
attainment. Non-Hispanic black adults had lower prevalence 
of four or five health-related behaviors compared with other 
race/ethnicity groups for the majority of urban-rural categories. 
Age-specific prevalence of reporting four or five health-related 
behaviors was lowest among adults in noncore categories 
compared with the majority of metropolitan categories, 
except for adults aged 18–24 years or ≥75 years for whom 
it did not vary among urban-rural classifications. Typically, 
age-adjusted prevalence of reporting four or five health-related 
behaviors was lower in noncore counties compared with other 
urban-rural classifications among women, men, non-Hispanic 
whites, Hispanics, and persons with some college education. 
In contrast, living in metropolitan counties did not provide 
benefits to non-Hispanic blacks, multiracial non-Hispanics, 
or American Indian/Alaska Natives; however, Asians living in 
noncore counties reported four or five health-related behaviors 
more often than those living in large metropolitan centers. 
Among adults whose educational attainment was less than 
high school graduate or high school graduate, those living in 
either large metropolitan centers or medium metropolitan 
counties had higher age-adjusted prevalence of reporting four 
or five health-related behaviors compared with those living in 
noncore counties.
Discussion
This is the first report to document urban and rural 
differences in the United States regarding prevalence of selected 
Healthy People 2020 health-related behaviors (sufficient sleep, 
current nonsmoking, nondrinking or moderate drinking, 
maintaining normal body weight, and meeting aerobic 
leisure time physical activity recommendations) (https://
www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives). Because 
approximately one third of U.S. adults practice at least four 
of the five behaviors, these findings suggest an ongoing need 
to increase public awareness and public education, particularly 
in rural counties where prevalence of these health-related 
behaviors is lowest. In 2013, although the prevalence of 
sufficient sleep did not vary by urban-rural classification, 
none of the six urban-rural categories were close to meeting 
the Healthy People 2020 target of 70.8% for sufficient sleep. 
The tobacco target is to reduce current smoking to 12.0%, 
which would translate to 88.0% for current nonsmoking; 
in 2013, the prevalence of current nonsmoking ranged from 
74.9% in noncore counties to 83.9% in large metropolitan 
centers, suggesting that the target is close to being met in more 
metropolitan populations. In 2013, the more urban categories 
(large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, and 
medium metropolitan) met the Healthy People 2020 target 
for maintaining normal body weight (33.9%); to achieve the 
objective, small metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore 
counties will require additional obesity prevention efforts. In 
2013, the Healthy People 2020 target for meeting aerobic leisure 
time physical activity recommendations (47.9%) was attained 
by populations in metropolitan and micropolitan counties. 
To achieve the objective, populations in small metropolitan, 
micropolitan, and noncore counties will require education 
about the health benefits of aerobic leisure time activity.

Although adults living in noncore counties tended to have 
lower prevalence of reporting four or five behaviors than those 
living in metropolitan and micropolitan counties for most 
of the sociodemographic subgroups, living in metropolitan 
counties did not provide any benefit to non-Hispanic 
blacks, American Indian/Alaska Natives, or multiracial non-
Hispanics. When compared with other race/ethnicity groups 
and education subgroups, non-Hispanic blacks, multiracial 
non-Hispanics, and adults whose educational attainment was 
less than high school graduate or high school graduate were 
at a greater disadvantage even in metropolitan counties. For 
example, lower prevalence of reporting four or five health-
related behaviors was observed in the most advantageous 
category (large central metropolitan) for blacks compared 
with the most disadvantageous category (noncore) for whites 
(23.5% versus 27.6%, respectively). Similarly, lower prevalence 
of reporting four or five health-related behaviors was observed 
in the most advantageous category for adults whose educational 
attainment was less than high school graduate or high school 
graduate compared with the most disadvantageous category for 
adults with some college education (24.9% and 27.8% versus 
31.4%, respectively). Thus, the commonly observed disparities 
for non-Hispanic blacks and adults with lower educational 
attainment are even greater in noncore counties than they 
are in metropolitan counties (12). The findings in this report 
are consistent with studies of the rural penalty defined as the 
disproportionate rate of mortality in rural areas (13).
Regardless of the chosen definition for urban-rural status, 
health outcomes are consistently poorer in rural areas due 
in part to a high prevalence of risk factors and to lower 
socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, and access to quality 
health care (2,5–9,12–15). Rural populations are also typically 
older than the general population. All of these factors lead to 
longer travel distances to, and higher costs associated with, 
needed health care services (2,13,14). Major health indicators 
(e.g., chronic disease, all-cause mortality, dental care, mental 
health, health insurance coverage, and physician supply) are 
consistently lower among populations in noncore counties than 
in micropolitan and metropolitan counties (2). These findings 
are important because 14.8% (46.2 million persons) of the 
total U.S. population reside in the 63.0% of counties that are 
classified as either micropolitan or noncore (10).

Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least six 
limitations. First, health-related behaviors in BRFSS are self-
reported and subject to reporting and social desirability bias. 
Second, findings are not generalizable because BRFSS is a 
household telephone survey; the study population does not 
include adults who live in long-term care facilities, prisons, and 
other institutions. Third, state response rates were relatively 
low and response rates cannot be obtained by urban-rural 
classifications; therefore, nonresponse might have resulted in 
either overestimates or underestimates. However, a strength 
is that BRFSS provides the largest study population with 
large stable sample sizes for all six urban-rural classifications. 
Fourth, no data exist about whether social desirability bias 
differs between rural and nonrural populations. Fifth, moderate 
drinking was combined with nondrinking to define the alcohol 
measure in this study, in contrast to the Healthy People 2020 
measure for harmful excessive alcohol use; moderate drinking 
should not be interpreted as a potential health benefit, which 
emerging scientific evidence might not support (http://
iogt.se/wp-content/uploads/Alkoholrapp-2014_ENG-
s%C3%A4rtryck.pdf). The U.S. Dietary Guidelines does 
not recommend that nondrinkers should start drinking 
for any reason (https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/
guidelines/appendix-9/). Finally, just as populations in all 
large central metropolitan counties might not reflect all inner 
city populations, not all populations in rural counties are 
the same. Furthermore, large metropolitan counties often 
include small cities and sparsely populated rural pockets that 
are located at a considerable distance from the primary urban 
core (9). Variations in influential factors might exist that 
were not assessed in this study, which might affect health-
related behaviors in some but not all rural counties. Such 
influential factors might include tobacco and alcohol laws and 
policies, ongoing prevention programs, distance to health care

providers, availability of nutritional foods, access to physical 
activity facilities and opportunities, and commuting times to 
employment. These factors also might affect the effectiveness 
and appropriateness of interventions that support adoption of 
health-related behaviors in rural populations.
Future Direction
Improving the health of persons living in rural counties 
might require a more analytically rigorous, multilevel approach 
that considers the contextual factors that might be mediating 
the associations between rural status, health-related behaviors, 
and health and identifies resources and interventions that 
support the adoption of these behaviors. The Community 
Preventive Services Task Force has published recommendations 
for programs and policy interventions that have proven 
scientific effectiveness for the prevention of excessive alcohol 
consumption, obesity, physical inactivity, and tobacco 
use (https://www.thecommunityguide.org/). Additional 
recommendations and strategies exist for the prevention of 
obesity (https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/community_
strategies_guide.pdf) and tobacco use (16). Some CDC 
community strategies are being adapted to rural communities 
for nutrition-related policy and environmental approaches such 
as food access (17).
Further, several similar interventions that are recommended for 
public health disciplines include those that increase prices (e.g., 
alcohol, tobacco, and sugar-sweetened beverages) (8,16,18); 
reduce access (e.g., tobacco and alcohol retail regulations and 
policies to reduce screen time to increase physical activity) 
(19); and prohibit use in public (e.g., tobacco) (16). These 
interventions should be balanced with general approaches to 
increasing health-promoting behaviors, such as increasing access 
to nutritious food or places for physical activity. However, few 
recommendations focus on strategies to improve rural health 
(http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/roadmaps/what-works-
for-health). Evidence-based policy recommendations do not exist 
for adult sleep health, which is emerging as an important risk 
factor for chronic and other health conditions.
Several federal programs address health-related behaviors 
in rural communities. CDC’s Programs to Reduce Obesity 
in High Obesity Areas targets counties with obesity rates 
>40%, many of which include rural communities (https://
www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/high-
obesity-communities/index.html). Local Foods, Local Places, 
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
Environmental Protection Agency, CDC, U.S. Department 
of Transportation, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, White House Rural Council, and regional 
partners, is an interagency initiative implemented in rural and 
small communities that aims to improve access to healthy local 
food (https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/local-foods-local-
places). USDA’s Community Assessment and Education to 
Promote Behavioral Health Planning and Evaluation program 
targets improved community behavioral health in rural counties 
(https://nifa.usda.gov/program/rural-health-and-safety). Other 
efforts to support the health of rural communities are funded 
by CDC’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. 
These include the Prevention Research Centers (https://www.
cdc.gov/PRC/); practitioner program guidance, such as a 
success stories website that permits searches by filters such as 
rural communities (https://nccd.cdc.gov/nccdsuccessstories/
searchstories.aspx); and the Nutrition and Obesity Research 
and Evaluation Network, which is an academic research 
network on rural food access (http://nopren.org/).
Implementation of evidence-based policy interventions 
and elimination of geographic disparities in policy adoption 
would improve rural health outcomes. For example, although 
approximately 50% of the United States population is protected 
by state and local comprehensive smoke-free laws, no state in 
the southern United States has a statewide comprehensive 
smoke-free law (20). Furthermore, cigarette excise taxes 
(https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/
tobacco-use/objectives) are known to reduce the demand for 
cigarettes. Southern states, which have many rural counties, 
have some of the lowest cigarette excise taxes in the country 
(21). Except for large metropolitan counties, information about 
smoking prevalence and the implementation of evidence-based 
tobacco control interventions is limited.
Conclusion
The findings in this report indicate that the prevalence of 
current nonsmoking, maintaining normal body weight, and 
meeting aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations 
was lowest and the prevalence of nondrinking or moderate 
drinking was highest in noncore counties. The prevalence 
of sufficient sleep was low and did not vary by urban-rural 
classification. The prevalence of having at least four of five 
health-related behaviors was achieved by less than one third 
of the U.S. population and was lowest in noncore counties. 
Chronic disease prevention efforts focus on improving the 
communities, schools, worksites, and health systems in which 
persons live, learn, work, and play. Evidence-based strategies 
to improve the health-related behaviors of persons living in 
rural areas in the United States should be widely implemented.
