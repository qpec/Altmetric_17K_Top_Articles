Abstract
Background and objectives It is not known what proportion of United States patients with advanced CKD go on
to receive RRT. In other developed countries, receipt of RRT is highly age dependent and the exception rather
than the rule at older ages.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We conducted a retrospective study of a national cohort of
28,568 adults who were receiving care within the US Department of Veteran Affairs and had a sustained eGFR
,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 between January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009. We used linked administrative data from
the US Renal Data System, US Department of Veteran Affairs, and Medicare to identify cohort members who
received RRT during follow-up through October 1, 2011 (n=19,165). For a random 25% sample of the remaining
9403 patients, we performed an in-depth review of their VA–wide electronic medical records to determine the
treatment status of their CKD.
Results Two thirds (67.1%) of cohort members received RRT on the basis of administrative data. On the basis of
the results of chart review, we estimate that an additional 7.5% (95% confidence interval, 7.2% to 7.8%) of cohort
members had, in fact, received dialysis, that 10.9% (95% confidence interval, 10.6% to 11.3%) were preparing
for and/or discussing dialysis but had not started dialysis at most recent follow-up, and that a decision had
been made not to pursue dialysis in 14.5% (95% confidence interval, 14.1% to 14.9%). The percentage of cohort
members who received or were preparing to receive RRT ranged from 96.2% (95% confidence interval, 94.4% to
97.4%) for those ,45 years old to 53.3% (95% confidence interval, 50.7% to 55.9%) for those aged $85 years old.
Results were similar after stratification by tertile of Gagne comorbidity score.
Conclusions In this large United States cohort of patients with advanced CKD, the majority received or were
preparing to receive RRT. This was true even among the oldest patients with the highest burden of comorbidity.

Introduction
The US Medicare Program spends .$30 billion annu-
ally to provide RRT, including maintenance dialysis
and kidney transplant, to .400,000 Americans with
advanced CKD (1). The annual incidence of RRT in
the United States is several fold higher than that in
many European nations (1,2). Whether the relatively
higher incidence of RRT in the United States reflects a
greater burden of kidney disease in the source pop-
ulation or differences in treatment practices for ad-
vanced CKD is not known.
Most of what is known about treatment practices for
advanced CKD in the United States comes from the
US Renal Data System (USRDS). However, similar to
many other national registries of RRT, the USRDS
does not collect information on patients who reach the
advanced stages of CKD but do not receive RRT.
There are several lines of indirect evidence to suggest
that there may be a large potential reservoir of patients
with advanced CKD in this country who are not
treated with RRT, especially at older ages (.75 years
old). Although the prevalence of CKD increases line-
arly with age, the incidence of RRT as reported by
the USRDS plateaus and then, declines at older ages
(1,3–6). Several studies conducted outside the United
States suggest that it is relatively common for patients
with advanced CKD not to receive RRT, especially at
older ages (7,8). However, there is marked international
variation in use of RRT (1,2,6), making it uncertain
whether the results of these studies are generalizable
to the United States.
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is the
largest integrated health care system in the United
States. We conducted a retrospective study of a national
cohort of patients receiving care within the VA to
determine how often patients with advanced CKD do
not receive RRT, the characteristics of these patients,
and the clinical context in which these decisions occur.

 Materials and Methods
Study Population
Using the VA data sources, we identified all veterans
aged $18 years old with advanced CKD, which was de-
fined as having an eGFR,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 on at
least two outpatient tests drawn at least 90 days apart
between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009
(n=50,121) (9). Date of cohort entry was defined as the
date of the second eGFR ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2. We
excluded patients who received RRT before cohort entry
on the basis of registration in the USRDS (n=20,537) and
procedure code search for dialysis in Medicare claims,
VA inpatient and outpatient treatment, and Fee Basis
files (which capture care received at non-VA facilities
that is paid for by the VA) on or before the date of cohort
entry (n=1016). This yielded an analytic cohort of 28,568
patients (Figure 1).
The Institutional Review Boards at the VA Puget Sound
Health Care System and the University of Washington
approved this study and waived the requirement to obtain
informed consent from patients.
Patient Characteristics
We used the VA Vital Status File to ascertain patient age
at cohort entry (categorized as ,45 years old and then, in
5-year increments up to 85 years old), race (categorized as
white, black, and other), and sex. We used the VA Deci-
sion Support System Laboratory Results File to ascertain
serum creatinine measures, and eGFR was estimated using
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. We
used Medicare and VA administrative data to obtain in-
formation on outpatient nephrology clinic visits in the year
before cohort entry and identify the following comorbid
conditions present at cohort entry on the basis of Interna-
tional Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision diagnostic
codes on at least two claims during the year before cohort
entry: coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis, periph-
eral artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, dementia,
cancer, and stroke. We also calculated a Gagne comorbid-
ity score (10), which combines the conditions included
in the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices, to
ascertain a comprehensive measure summarizing the
overall burden of comorbidity for each patient at the
time of cohort entry on the basis of diagnostic codes in
Medicare and VA administrative files during the preced-
ing year. We then categorized patients as having a low
(scores ,4), moderate (scores =4–6) or high (scores .6)
burden of comorbidity on the basis of tertile of Gagne
comorbidity score.

 Outcome Measures
We used the USRDS records and dialysis procedure code
search of Medicare and VA administrative files to identify
patients who were treated with RRT during follow-up.
Patients were followed through the first service date in
the USRDS, the date of first dialysis procedure code in
administrative files if the patient did not appear in the
USRDS, the date of death (obtained from the VA Vital
Status File), or October 1, 2011, whichever came first. To
understand the treatment status of cohort members who
did not appear in the USRDS and did not have a dialysis
procedure code in administrative files during follow-up
(n=9403), we identified a random 25% sample (n=2252)
stratified by calendar year of cohort entry and the VA ser-
vice network for detailed medical record review (Figure 1).
Medical Record Review
The VA has a comprehensive national electronic medical
record system that includes progress notes for all inpatient
and outpatient encounters of patients receiving care at its
facilities. All progress notes are available in Text Integra-
tion Utility (TIU) format through the VA Corporate Data
Warehouse. Chart review was conducted using TIU notes
in each patient’s VA–wide electronic medical record from
the time of cohort entry through death or October 1, 2011.
To facilitate and enhance the completeness of chart review,
we used Lucene text–searching software (11) to locate
progress notes containing information about treatment de-
cisions for advanced CKD. We used inclusive search quer-
ies that returned all discharge summaries, nephrology
inpatient and outpatient progress notes, and all progress
notes containing catchall terms, such as dialysis, ESRD,
and kidney disease.
We used a combined inductive and deductive approach
to content analysis of the medical record (12). Inductive
content analysis is an unstructured approach to the read-
ing of texts that facilitates identification of themes and
patterns inherent to a phenomenon that have not been
previously described. In deductive content analysis, read-
ing of texts is aimed at determining whether they have
attributes that are consistent with predefined themes and
patterns. To accomplish this, two investigators (S.P.Y.W., a
senior nephrology fellow, and A.M.O, a nephrologist with
.15 years of clinical experience) reviewed the progress
notes of 200 randomly selected patients in the sample to
develop a coding schema to categorize patients into dis-
tinct groups reflecting their treatment status with respect
to RRT at the time of most recent follow-up. Then, one

 investigator (S.P.Y.W.) assigned the remaining 2052 pa-
tients selected for chart review to prespecified treatment
groups. Among those selected for chart review (n=2252),
we excluded 207 from our analyses, because their eGFRs
at most recent follow-up in the medical record were .15
ml/min per 1.73 m2, and we excluded 117 with insuffi-
cient documentation to characterize the clinical course of
their CKD (Figure 1).
Analytic Approach
We used proportions, means and SDs, and chi-squared
and ANOVA tests to compare the referent category of
patients who were enrolled in the USRDS or had a dialysis
procedure code in administrative data with patients in
each of the clinically distinct subgroups identified in the
chart review sample.
The results of chart review were then used to estimate the
proportion and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the
overall cohort expected to belong to each treatment group.
We evaluated the estimated distribution of treatment
groups within each age group using a multinomial logistic
regression model adjusted for all baseline patient charac-
teristics and calendar year of cohort entry. We repeated the
primary analysis after stratification by tertile of comorbid-
ity score. To evaluate for temporal differences in treatment
practices, we calculated the incidence of enrollment in the
USRDS or having a dialysis procedure code in adminis-
trative data during follow-up for each age group strat-
ifying by time period of cohort entry (2000–2004 versus
2005–2009).
Construction of the analytic dataset and statistical
analyses were performed using SAS, version 9 (SAS In-
stitute Inc., Cary, NC) and SPSS, version 19 (IBM SPSS,
Chicago, IL).
Results
Outcomes
Of the 28,568 members of this cohort, 18,231 patients
(63.8%) were registered in the USRDS, and an additional
934 patients (3.3%) had at least one dialysis treatment on
the basis of dialysis procedure code search of Medicare
and VA administrative files during follow-up (Figure 1).
Median time to date of the USRDS enrollment or first di-
alysis procedure code in administrative files was 0.6 years
(interquartile range, 0.2–1.2 years).

Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 For the 1928 patients included in the in–depth chart re-
view, median follow-up was 0.4 years (interquartile range,
0.1–1.3 years). These patients were grouped as follows
(Figure 1): (1) received dialysis (n=437; 22.7%): patients
with documentation in progress notes that they had re-
ceived at least one dialysis treatment, despite not being
registered in the USRDS or having a dialysis procedure
code in administrative files; (2) discussing and/or prepar-
ing for dialysis (n=640; 33.2%): patients who had not started
dialysis by the end of follow-up but were preparing for
dialysis or engaged in ongoing discussions with providers
about whether to undergo dialysis; and (3) decision
against dialysis (n=851; 44.1%): patients for whom an ex-
plicit or implicit decision not to pursue dialysis had been
made by the patients themselves, family members, and/
or providers. Representative quotations from the medical
record used to assign patients to each of these categories
are presented in Table 1. For the 1749 sampled patients
(90.7%) who died during follow-up, assigned categories
reflect their treatment status at the time of death.
Patient Characteristics
Compared with the referent group of patients who were
registered in the USRDS or had a dialysis procedure code in
administrative files, patients who had, in fact, received
some dialysis on the basis of chart review, those who were
preparing and/or discussing dialysis, and those in whom a
decision against dialysis had been made were older, were
more often white, had a higher burden of comorbidity, and
had less nephrology care in the year before cohort entry
(Table 2). These differences persisted in adjusted analyses
(Table 3).
Age-Stratified Analyses
On the basis of chart review for this random sample of
patients, we estimate that the proportion of all cohort
members who received RRT on the basis of the USRDS
enrollment, dialysis procedure code search, and chart
review or were preparing for or discussing dialysis de-
creased linearly with age from 96.2% (95% CI, 94.4% to
97.4%) among patients aged ,45 years old to 53.3% (95%
CI, 50.7% to 55.9%) among patients aged $85 years old
(adjusted trend; P value ,0.001) (Figure 2). Conversely,
the decision not to pursue dialysis was more common at
older ages, increasing from an estimated 3.8% (95% CI,
2.6% to 5.6%) among patients aged ,45 years old to
46.7% (95% CI, 44.1% to 49.3%) among patients aged
$85 years old (adjusted trend; P value ,0.001). Analyses

 stratified by tertile of comorbidity score were broadly con-
sistent with the primary analysis (Figure 3). For example,
for patients aged $85 years old, the estimated proportion
of patients in whom a decision against dialysis had been
made was similar for those in the lowest (44.5%; 95% CI,
39.5% to 49.6%) versus highest (48.8%; 95% CI, 44.4% to
53.3%) tertile of comorbidity (unadjusted P=0.60). The in-
cidence of RRT on the basis of enrollment in the USRDS or
dialysis procedure code search of administrative files for
cohort members in each age group was similar for those
who entered the cohort earlier (2000–2004) versus later
(2005–2009) in time (Supplemental Figure 1).
Discussion
Among a national cohort of patients with advanced CKD
receiving care in the VA, most patients were enrolled in the
USRDS (63.8%) or had a dialysis procedure code in VA or
Medicare administrative files (3.3%) during follow-up. On
the basis of in–depth chart review for a random sample of
the remaining patients, we estimate that an additional
7.5% of cohort members had, in fact, received at least
one dialysis treatment not captured in the USRDS or ad-
ministrative data and that 10.9% were discussing and/or
preparing for dialysis but had not yet started dialysis at
end of follow-up. Thus, at most recent follow-up, the over-
whelming majority (85.5%) of patients had either received
—or were preparing to receive—RRT. In only 14.5% of
cohort members was there an implicit or explicit decision
not to pursue dialysis.
The proportion of patients in this cohort who were
treated with RRT is higher than that previously reported
for other developed nations (7,8). In a large retrospective
study conducted in Canada using registry and administra-
tive records from 2002 to 2008, Hemmelgarn et al. (7)
found that 51.4% of patients who developed kidney failure
(defined as a sustained eGFR ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or
receipt of dialysis or kidney transplant) were treated with
RRT. In a retrospective study using registry and death
certificate data from New Zealand and Australia between
2003 and 2007, Sparke et al. (8) reported that 51.2% of
patients with kidney failure (defined as either enrollment
in the RRT registry or death from kidney disease without
receipt of dialysis or kidney transplant) received RRT.
However, source data for these studies lacked information
on the clinical circumstances of those patients who did not
receive RRT, such as whether there had been a decision not
to offer or receive RRT.
Differences in the use of RRT between our study com-
pared with that in these earlier studies are much more
striking for older than for younger age groups (Figure 4).
The percentage of patients aged ,45 years old treated
with RRT in our cohort (88.4%) was similar to those re-
ported in the works by Hemmelgarn et al. (7) (86.3%) and
Sparke et al. (8) (.95.0%). However, at older ages, the pro-
portion treated with RRT was far higher for members of
our cohort; 41.1% of patients aged $85 years old in our
cohort were treated with RRT as compared with 6.8%
and ,5.0% among similarly aged patients described by
Hemmelgarn et al. (7) and Sparke et al. (8), respectively.
Furthermore, although burden of comorbidity is a key de-
terminant of prognosis in patients who initiate dialysis
(5,13–15), this seemed to have little effect on decisions
about RRT. Even among members of the oldest age group
with the highest burden of comorbidity, most received or
were preparing to receive RRT at last follow-up. This find-
ing is consistent with the observation that the incidence
rate of RRT in the United States greatly surpasses that
reported for European populations with a similar preva-
lence of advanced CKD and other significant chronic ill-
ness (4). In this study, patients with a higher versus lower
burden of comorbidity were less likely to have initiated
RRT but also, more likely to still be preparing for RRT at
most recent follow-up, which might suggest that dialysis
had been recommended for these patients for whom the
competing risk of death may have exceeded their risk of
developing a need to initiate RRT. In a survey study of
United States nephrologists, a minority reported that they

 would offer more conservative therapy, such as palliative
care, as an alternative to RRT to older patients with multi-
morbidity (16). Taken in this context, our findings reiter-
ate concerns that, in the United States, decisions about
RRT may not be strongly guided by the individual con-
siderations and preferences of patients and instead, reflect
wider health system and physician practices favoring
more liberal use of interventions intended to lengthen
life (17–22).
There were other notable differences in RRT practices
across patient subgroups. Use of RRT was more common
and decisions against dialysis were less common among
black as compared with white patients. This finding is in
agreement with prior studies reporting greater use of other
potentially life–sustaining treatments, such as cardiopul-
monary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, and
less frequent use of hospice among black as compared
with white patients with advanced CKD (17,18,23). Use
of RRT was also less common and decisions against di-
alysis were more common among patients with higher
comorbidity scores and histories of dementia, stroke,
cancer, and cirrhosis. This finding seems consistent
with other studies, in which nephrologists reported
viewing dialysis as undesirable and palliative care refer-
ral as more appropriate in circumstances of severe cog-
nitive and/or functional impairment or terminal illness
from another condition (24–27).
This study has several limitations. First, the study
population was limited to veterans who underwent serum
creatinine measurement at a VA facility, and thus, it begs
the question of whether study findings are generalizable to
those receiving care in other health systems or other United

 States populations with advanced CKD, especially women.
Given prior work that suggests that dialysis initiation
practices are more conservative within versus outside the
VA (19), we suspect that the proportion of patients treated
with RRT in this study is probably lower than would be
expected for members of the general United States popula-
tion with advanced CKD. Second, differences in study de-
sign argue for caution in comparing rates of RRT in our
study with those reported in prior studies conducted out-
side the United States (7,8). The proportion of patients
treated with RRT is likely sensitive to exclusion and inclu-
sion criteria, such as the threshold level of eGFR and re-
quirement for chronicity. We chose to focus our study on
patients with a sustained eGFR ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to
examine treatment decisions and practices among those
patients most likely to receive RRT. Treatment rates would
almost certainly have been lower if we had selected a
higher eGFR threshold and included patients with transient
loss of eGFR. Third, although we adopted a rigorous ap-
proach to capture episodes of dialysis occurring within the
VA, at non-VA facilities but that were paid for by the VA,
and under fee for service Medicare, we were not able to
capture dialysis treatments paid for by Medicare Advan-
tage or private insurance. Thus, if anything, our results
likely underestimate the proportion of cohort members who
received dialysis. Fourth, categorization of patients into
treatment groups was on the basis of documentation in
the VA electronic medical record, which might not fully
or precisely capture the clinical context or attitudes toward
dialysis held by individual patients. Categorization was
also on the basis of decisions documented at most recent
follow-up and does not capture changes in patients’ prefer-
ences for dialysis during the course of their illness. Our
study findings also cannot address the adequacy of patients’
understanding of their treatment options and engagement in
decision making about RRT.
In this large national cohort of patients with advanced
CKD in the VA system, dialysis initiation practices among
older patients were far more liberal than those reported for
other developed countries (7,8). Our findings underscore
the relevance of shared decision making for dialysis (28)
to ensure that treatment decisions uphold the priorities
and preferences of individual patients and are grounded
in realistic expectations about prognosis and the expected
benefits and harms of this treatment.
