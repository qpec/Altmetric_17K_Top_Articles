Neurotoxic amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) are major drivers of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and are formed by sequential cleavage of the amyloid
precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE) and γ-secretase. Our
previous study showed that the anticancer drug Gleevec lowers Aβ
levels through indirect inhibition of γ-secretase activity. Here we
report that Gleevec also achieves its Aβ-lowering effects through
an additional cellular mechanism. It renders APP less susceptible to
proteolysis by BACE without inhibiting BACE enzymatic activity or
the processing of other BACE substrates. This effect closely mimics
the phenotype of APP A673T, a recently discovered mutation that
protects carriers against AD and age-related cognitive decline. In
addition, Gleevec induces formation of a specific set of APP C-termi-
nal fragments, also observed in cells expressing the APP protective
mutation and in cells exposed to a conventional BACE inhibitor.
These Gleevec phenotypes require an intracellular acidic pH and
are independent of tyrosine kinase inhibition, given that a related
compound lacking tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, DV2-103, ex-
erts similar effects on APP metabolism. In addition, DV2-103 accumu-
lates at high concentrations in the rodent brain, where it rapidly
lowers Aβ levels. This study suggests that long-term treatment with
drugs that indirectly modulate BACE processing of APP but spare
other BACE substrates and achieve therapeutic concentrations in
the brain might be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of
AD and could be safer than nonselective BACE inhibitor drugs.

R
are mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) occur in
select families, where they are inherited as autosomal dominant
genes that invariably cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and are referred to as familial AD (FAD) mutations (1, 2). Most
APP mutations result in increased production of amyloidogenic
forms of Aβ peptides, mainly Aβ42 or an increased Aβ42/40 ratio
(3), which increases the propensity for Aβ42 to form oligomers,
leading to the accumulation of toxic fold variants of Aβ (4) and
insoluble Aβ species that form amyloid plaques (5, 6). Recently, an
APP mutation (APP-A673T) that protects against the development
of AD and age-related cognitive decline was identified in the Ice-
landic population (7, 8). The mutation exerts a protective effect by
rendering APP a less efficacious substrate of β-secretase (BACE),
possibly as the result of lower catalytic turnover (8). The sub-
sequent reduction in BACE processing of APP results in reduced
production of Aβ and soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) but, as expected, no
reported effect on the processing of other BACE substrates. Thus,
the mutation reduces the amount of APP processed through the
amyloidogenic pathway and can be considered a natural proof-of-
concept experiment demonstrating the efficacy of long-term, se-
lective BACE inhibition in the prevention of AD.
Nearly 70 putative BACE substrates have been identified in cells
(9). An inhibitor of this enzymatic activity that broadly disrupts
BACE processing of its numerous substrates is unlikely to be ideal
for the prevention or long-term treatment of AD. Indeed, both
BACE1 and BACE1/2 knockout mice, as well as mice treated
chronically with a nonselective BACE inhibitor drug, have exhibited
neurologic deficits (10). In the present study, we found that Gleevec
inhibits BACE cleavage of APP but does not inhibit BACE pro-
cessing of several other of its substrates known to affect synaptic
plasticity, learning, and memory. We also found that the inhibitory
activities of these compounds depend on an acidic cellular com-
partment. In addition, we report that a related compound with an
effect similar to Gleevec, DV2-103, reaches therapeutic concen-
trations inside the brain, and thus may have clinical potential.
In previous work, we demonstrated that the anticancer drug
Gleevec lowers Aβ levels through indirect inhibition of γ-secretase
activity (11, 12). This inhibition was shown to be selective, in that
Gleevec did not inhibit γ-secretase processing of Notch1, thus
avoiding one of the chief drawbacks of nonselective γ-secretase
inhibitors. In the present study, we found that the effects of Gleevec
on APP metabolism, including Aβ production, are exerted through
additional pathways.
Results
We compared APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) produced
in N2a Swe/ΔE9 cells (3, 13) after exposure to Gleevec or to a
γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Whereas the γ-secretase
inhibitor resulted in increased levels of APP-βCTF and APP-
αCTF, Gleevec increased APP-αCTF levels, but also induced two
unique APP-CTFs of 10 and 16 kDa.
We considered the possibility that the increase in α-CTF levels
might be accompanied by a decrease in BACE activity, given that
BACE and α-secretase activity are known to be competitive (14).
We also wished to know whether the 10- and 16-kDa APP-CTFs
were caused by alternative BACE cleavages of APP. To test these
possibilities, we performed an order-of-addition experiment con-
sisting of exposing N2a Swe/ΔE9 cells to two concentrations of
BACE inhibitor IV and then to three concentrations of Gleevec
plus BACE inhibitor IV (Fig. 1B). Rather than decrease the
APP-CTFs that were induced by Gleevec, the BACE inhibitor
Significance
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the
elderly. Four approved drugs are used to treat AD cognitive
symptoms, including loss of short-term memory. These drugs
produce modest, temporary benefits at best and do not prevent
or delay worsening of the disease. Recently, a mutation that
protects elderly people from developing AD was discovered. The
cellular process responsible for the mutation’s protective effect
was also identified, suggesting that drugs targeting this process
or pathway also might provide protection against the develop-
ment of AD. In the present study, we discovered that the anti-
cancer drug Gleevec and a related compound mimic the effects
of the protective mutation and thus can act as models for the
development of effective drugs to fight AD.

 raised their steady-state levels, suggesting that the Gleevec-induced
APP-CTFs are caused by reduced BACE cleavage of APP. The
combination of Gleevec and BACE inhibitor IV also decreased Aβ
levels (Fig. 1C); however, the inhibitory effect of 10 μM Gleevec was
greater than that of Gleevec alone compared with controls, suggest-
ing that Gleevec and BACE inhibitor IV may act synergistically to
lower Aβ levels.
To rule out the possibility that an FAD mutation is required to
produce these effects, we performed a similar experiment using N2a
695 cells, which express human APP but no FAD mutations. The
drug combination also raised levels of the Gleevec-induced 10- and
16-kDa APP-CTFs (Fig. 1D), indicating that these APP-CTFs are
caused not by BACE, but rather by decreased BACE cleavage of
APP in N2a 695 cells. We then sought to determine the location of
the APP cleavage site that gave rise to the 16-kDa APP-CTF as an
approach to investigate how this APP cleavage occurs. To accom-
plish this, we measured the precise molecular weight of the 16-kDa
APP-CTF by performing MALDI-MS after immunoprecipitation of
cell lysate prepared from N2a 695 cells treated with Gleevec. We
noted a major peak of molecular mass, 15,622.53 Da, corresponding
to the predicted mass of a 141-aa APP-CTF (C141).
We further discovered that Gleevec induced a pattern of APP-
CTFs in N2a 695 cells (Fig. 2A), with the APP-C141 fragment as
the predominant cleavage product. Importantly, the APP-CTFs
induced by Gleevec or by BACE inhibitor IV were nearly identical,
leading us to consider the possibility that the APP-CTF pattern is a
signature of BACE inhibition, and that Gleevec (like the BACE
inhibitor) inhibits BACE processing of APP. We tested this by
treating N2a 695 cells with Gleevec or BACE inhibitor IV and then
measuring levels of sAPPβ, the secreted N-terminal fragment of
APP that is a direct product of BACE processing of full-length
APP (FL-APP) (15) (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, Gleevec lowered levels
of sAPPβ in a dose-dependent manner (mean ± SEM, 57 ± 6.2%
of control at 10 μM and 90 ± 0.8% of control at 20 μM). However,
in contrast to the BACE inhibitor, which caused a rise in sAPPα,
10 μM Gleevec did not affect sAPPα levels, whereas 20 μM
Gleevec lowered sAPPα to 64.14 ± 1.96% of that in controls.
Given that the APP protective mutation (APP A673T) has been
reported to reduce BACE cleavage of APP (7), we compared
APP-CTFs generated by N2a cells transiently transfected with ei-
ther WT APP695 or APP695-A673T exposed to vehicle or to
Gleevec. Remarkably, expression of the protective mutation pro-
duced APP-CTFs similar to those formed by N2a cells expressing
APP695 in response to Gleevec (Fig. 2C). In addition, N2a APP-
A673T cells exposed to Gleevec produced even higher steady-state
levels of these APP-CTFs.
Pharmacologic inhibition of BACE by a nonselective inhibitor
has the potential to affect numerous signaling pathways, given the
large number of putative BACE substrates present in cells (16). In
contrast, the APP protective mutation, A673T, reduces BACE
processing of APP but presumably of no other protein. To de-
termine whether Gleevec’s effect on BACE processing of APP is
selective, we tested whether Gleevec inhibits BACE processing of
two physiological BACE substrates, L1CAM and Sez6 (Fig. 3A).
Both of these proteins led to intracellular BACE cleaved CTFs
(βCTFs), which are inhibited by BACE inhibitor IV but not by
Gleevec, demonstrating that Gleevec shows some selectivity for
inhibiting BACE processing of APP. To determine whether Gleevec
inhibits BACE directly, we performed an in vitro assay testing
BACE1 cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Fig. 3B), which
demonstrated that even at a concentration of 100 μM, Gleevec has
no direct effect on BACE1 activity, in contrast to active-site BACE
inhibitor IV. Nonetheless, to rule out the possibility that when an
APP substrate is present, Gleevec inhibits BACE cleavage of APP
either directly or by interacting with APP, we performed a second
in vitro BACE assay testing BACE1 cleavage of APP-C140 (Fig.
3C). BACE inhibitor IV completely eliminated BACE1 cleavage of
the APP-C140 substrate, in contrast to Gleevec, which had no ef-
fect at all concentrations tested, thus again ruling out a direct in-
hibitory effect of Gleevec on BACE1 or an indirect effect through

 interaction with APP. Interestingly, it has been reported that
a series of benzofuran-containing compounds selectively inhibit
BACE processing of APP in vitro by binding directly to APP
around the BACE cleavage site (17), and another study involving
two flavonoid compounds reported similar results (18). It is unlikely
that Gleevec inhibits BACE cleavage of APP by the same mech-
anism, however. Our in vitro BACE1 assay uses APP C140 as a
substrate, yet Gleevec fails to inhibit BACE1 cleavage within this
APP C-terminal region, even at a concentration of 200 μM.
In our earlier studies, we demonstrated that Gleevec lowers Aβ
production through a γ-secretase–dependent pathway (11, 12). To
determine the extent to which Gleevec contributes to an Aβ de-
crease through selective inhibition of BACE activity vs. inhibition
of γ-secretase, we performed a Gleevec dose–response experiment
comparing Aβ40 secretion in N2a 695 cells and N2a βCTF (C99)
cells, which require γ-secretase, but not BACE, for Aβ production
(Fig. 3D). Thus, we demonstrated that Gleevec is 3.5- to 5-fold
more potent at inhibiting production of Aβ in N2a 695 cells
compared with N2a βCTF cells at concentrations ranging from 10
to 40 μM, suggesting that BACE is a rate-limiting factor in the
inhibition of Aβ production by Gleevec.
We previously demonstrated that both Gleevec and the Abl and
Src kinase inhibitor PD173955 (“inhibitor 2”) inhibit Aβ pro-
duction independent of Abl kinase activity (11). In the present
study, to extend this analysis to other kinases, we used PD173955
as a template and chose a kinase inhibitor-defective derivative of
that compound, DV2-103 (19) (Fig. 4A). We then compared the
effects of DV2-103, Gleevec, and PD173955 on the kinase activi-
ties of Abl, Src, and MAP kinase 1 (Fig. 4B). Gleevec inhibited
only Abl kinase, whereas PD173955 inhibited both Abl and Src, as
expected, and showed some inhibition of MAP kinase 1 as well.
DV2-103 did not inhibit any of these kinases, and also failed to
show significant kinase inhibition in a screen consisting of 211
additional kinases (Fig. S2). Remarkably, we found that DV2-103,
although not a kinase inhibitor, inhibited the production of Aβ in
N2a 695 cells (Fig. 4C), as did Gleevec, and produced the same
pattern of APP-CTFs, including C141 (Fig. 4D). These results in-
dicate that kinase inhibition is not necessary for DV2-103 to have a
Gleevec-like effect on APP metabolism. We previously demon-
strated that Gleevec does not inhibit γ-secretase–catalyzed Notch
cleavage (11). Therefore, we tested DV2-103 in a similar assay, and
found that like Gleevec, it did not inhibit the γ-secretase–catalyzed
S3 cleavage of Notch (Fig. 4E).
Gleevec does not accumulate in brain at therapeutic concentra-
tions, owing to its rapid efflux from the brain by the p-glycoprotein
and other efflux pumps that form the blood-brain barrier (20–22).
We tested i.p. administration of DV2-103 in C57BL/6 mice to de-
termine whether it might achieve the same or higher brain con-
centrations than Gleevec. In contrast to Gleevec (23), DV2-103
accumulated in mouse brains at concentrations >10 μM by 4 h after
i.p. administration of 30 mg/kg (Table S1). We then administered

 DV2-103 (15 and 30 mg/kg) via i.p. injection to 3xTg AD mice (24)
to test for effects on Aβ levels. Remarkably, DV2-103 lowered
brain Aβ levels in 3xTg mice to 60 ± 4.4% of those in controls by
4 h after administration of 15 mg/kg (Fig. 4F).
We next addressed the questions of what proteases are re-
sponsible for formation of the Gleevec- and DV2-103–induced
APP-CTFs, and whether inhibition, or, conversely, stimulation, of
such proteases contributes to the effects of these compounds on
APP metabolism. Almost all (95%) of Gleevec entering cells (re-
gardless of cell type) becomes sequestered in lysosomes (25, 26)
through ion trapping, because Gleevec is a weak base (27–29). To
examine the possibility that Gleevec might inhibit the activities of
lysosomal proteases by raising lysosomal pH, we exposed N2a 695
cells to vehicle or to Gleevec for 4 h and then to the lysosomotropic
dye Lysotracker Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which sequesters
in acidified lysosomes (30). Gleevec pretreatment increased the
amount of Lysotracker Red in lysosomes and also appeared to
increase lysosomal volume (Fig. S3), indicating maintenance of
acidic pH in the presence of Gleevec. Therefore, proteases that
require low pH for activity could remain active. It also is unlikely
that Gleevec lowers the pH of lysosomes.
To examine the possibility that lysosomal proteases mediate or
contribute to the effects of Gleevec and DV2-103 on APP metab-
olism, we exposed N2a 695 cells to bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of
the vacuolar ATPase (31), to deacidify lysosomes and other acidic
cellular compartments, thereby preventing their proteases from
functioning. After incubation with bafilomycin A1, no LysoTracker
Red fluorescence was visualized as punctate structures in N2a 695
cells. Remarkably, bafilomycin A1 also resulted in nearly complete
inhibition of formation of C141 and other APP-CTFs except for the
APP-αCTF (Fig. 5A). We next measured sAPPβ levels to test
whether bafilomycin A1 also affected BACE processing of APP.
Remarkably, bafilomycin A1 did not prevent BACE (or a BACE-
like) processing of APP (Discussion), but did prevent inhibition of
BACE processing by Gleevec and DV2-103, as measured by se-
creted levels of sAPPβ (Fig. 5A, Lower). Furthermore, the ability of
Gleevec and DV2-103 to lower Aβ40 levels was greatly reduced in
the presence of bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 5 B and C).
To further demonstrate that an acidic cellular compartment is
required for Gleevec’s effects on APP metabolism, we exposed N2a
695 cells to the alkalizing agent NH4Cl to raise the pH of otherwise
acidic intracellular compartments (32). Like bafilomycin A1, NH4Cl
prevented Gleevec from inducing APP-C140 or the 10-kDa APP-
CTF (Fig. 5D) and from lowering Aβ40 levels (Fig. 5E). To test the
possibility that the Gleevec-induced APP-CTFs are localized to ly-
sosomes, we purified lysosomes from N2a 695 cells that had been
exposed to vehicle or Gleevec, and found that the Gleevec-induced
APP-CTFs were in fact localized to lysosomes (Fig. 5F).
Discussion
Gleevec and DV2-103 indirectly lower BACE processing of APP,
reducing Aβ production and promoting the formation of multiple
APP-CTFs, including a unique 16-kDa APP-CTF. These activities
are kinase-independent, because DV2-103 in not a kinase inhibitor,
and selective, because the inhibition of BACE processing of APP by
Gleevec does not inhibit BACE processing of L1CAM and Sez6.
By comparing the Aβ-lowering effects of Gleevec in N2a cells
that express either APP695 or APP-βCTF (C99), we provide ev-
idence that Gleevec’s inhibition of BACE processing of APP is the
major contributor to the decreased Aβ levels in N2a cells. This
result does not conflict with previous reports of Gleevec lowering
γ-secretase activity, but instead suggests that multiple pathways
affecting Aβ levels are involved.
Selective inhibition of BACE processing of APP is also a hall-
mark of the APP-protective mutation APP-A673T, which was
recently discovered in the Icelandic population and has been
shown to protect against the development of AD and age-related
cognitive decline. Thus, this mutation represents a natural ex-
periment providing proof of principle that long-term, selective
inhibition of BACE processing of APP reduces the risk of mental
deterioration in elderly persons, and suggests that drugs producing
a similar biochemical phenotype may be especially useful in pre-
venting or delaying AD.
We also have demonstrated that Gleevec and DV2-103 induce
formation of the same APP-CTFs that occur in response to
treatment with a standard BACE inhibitor. More importantly,
this commonality of APP-CTFs extends to the APP-protective

 mutation A673T, further suggesting that the CTF pattern is a
signature of inhibition of BACE processing of APP and is likely to
be nontoxic, considering that the APP-protective mutation is
beneficial in humans (7). The model shown in Fig. 6 summarizes
our results.
Our analysis is particularly interesting, in that two other groups
recently reported additional cleavages of APP in response to a
BACE inhibitor that result in previously uncharacterized APP-
CTFs, APP-NTFs (33), and N-terminally extended Aβ peptides
(34). Both groups found that some of these APP metabolites inhibit
long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices and thus are
synaptotoxic. We do not know whether any of the APP metabolites
induced by Gleevec or DV2-103 are the same as those identified by
the Haass and Selkoe groups, but we have shown that the Gleevec-
induced CTFs are very similar to those produced by the protective
APP mutation.
We also have demonstrated that Gleevec does not inhibit BACE
activity directly, based on in vitro BACE assays. Thus, the inhibition
of BACE cleavage by BACE inhibitor IV and the reduction of
BACE cleavage of APP by Gleevec have different mechanisms of
action. This finding is supported by our observation of the syner-
gistic effect of the two inhibitors used together. Had the mecha-
nisms been the same, we would have expected an additive effect.
We also provide evidence that the Aβ-lowering effects of
Gleevec and DV2-103 require one or more acidified cellular
compartments. This is interesting, because BACE has an acidic pH
optimum (35, 36) but APP is nevertheless metabolized to Aβ in the
presence of bafilomycin A1. This phenomenon, which has been
observed by others (37–39), could result from BACE-like cleavage
of APP by cellular proteases that do not require an acidic milieu for
activity. Candidate proteases include caspases that may become
activated by cathepsins leaked from lysosomes after bafilomycin A1
treatment (40). The increased levels of Aβ that occur after bafi-
lomycin A1 treatment also could result from inhibiting autophagy,
thus increasing the pool of the Aβ precursor, APP-βCTF (41), or
from increased BACE levels that could occur when BACE cannot
be degraded in lysosomes (42).
We have further implicated lysosomes as mediating the effects of
Gleevec and DV2-103 on APP metabolism by showing a strict
requirement for an acidified cellular compartment for these drugs
to induce the formation of APP-CTFs. It appears likely that except
for the APP-αCTF, which is produced at the plasma membrane,
the Gleevec-induced APP-CTFs are produced in lysosomes. If they
were produced outside of the lysosome, we would expect to see a
buildup of these CTFs when lysosomes were inhibited by bafilo-
mycin. In contrast, we demonstrated that the Gleevec-induced
APP-CTFs were greatly reduced under these conditions. Further-
more, deacidification of lysosomes by bafilomycin or NH4Cl has
been shown to prevent the sequestration of Gleevec within lyso-
somes (25). Thus, the concentration of Gleevec or DV2-103 within
these lysosomes might become too low to engage a Gleevec or
DV2-103 target, should a discrete target exist in lysosomes.
Based on our results, we propose that the selective reduction of
BACE processing of APP is another mechanism by which Gleevec
and DV2-103 lower Aβ production in cells. The effect of these
drugs on lysosomal volume are consistent with the effects of other
amphipathic, cationic molecules containing aromatic rings, which
cause an increase in lysosomal volume, purportedly through in-
tercalation of lysosomotropic drugs within lipid bilayers, but with
no change in lysosomal pH (43). Such compounds also have been
shown to increase the trafficking of proteins from the plasma
membrane or endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes (44, 45), and by
doing so would be expected to reduce the quantity of APP ex-
posed to amyloidogenic processing by BACE and γ-secretase.
Materials and Methods
Mice. The 3xTg mice (24) used in this study express the human FAD mutations
APP KM670/671NL (Swedish), MAPT (tau) P301L, and PSEN1 M146V (The
Jackson Laboratory; JAX MMRRC stock no. 034830). The WT mice were C57BL/6J
(The Jackson Laboratory; stock no. 000664). The 2-mo-old C57BL/6J mice were
given DV2-103 dissolved in DMSO by i.p. injection at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Brains
were dissected 4 h later. Hemibrains without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs
were weighed and frozen in liquid N2. Measured volumes of blood were
harvested postmortem and frozen in liquid N2. Brain and blood were trans-
ferred to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Analytical Pharmacology
Laboratory for measurement of DV2-103 concentration, with values normal-
ized to brain wet weight or plasma volume. The 3xTg mice were administered
DV2-103 i.p., and hemibrains were dissected after 4 h and analyzed for total
Aβ by PAGE, followed by electrotransfer to PVDF membranes and Western
blot analysis with antibody 6E10 (Signet Testing Labs).
Transfection of Cells. APP 695, APP A673T, mNotch Δe. N2aWT cells were
transfected using either Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. APP A673T DNA
was constructed using human APP 695 DNA as a template.
Cell Cultures. Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) was purchased from BioVision, and
10 mM stock solutions were prepared in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). DV2-103 was a
generous gift from Drs. Darren Veach and B. Clarkson at MSKCC and was
synthesized at the Organic Chemistry Core facility of Sloan Kettering Institute.
stock solutions (10 and 20 mM) were prepared in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). Each
Inhibitor was rapidly mixed in culture medium (1:1,000 dilution) by vortexing
and then layered onto adherent cells (>95% confluent) that had been in-
cubated in 6- or 12-well tissue culture plates (Corning) for 5 h at 37 °C in 5%
CO2. N2wt, N2 695, N2a-C99, and N2a Swe/Δe9 cell lines were used. In addi-
tion, inhibitors were tested on Cos cells and 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with
APP 695 or APP Swe/Δe9 cells.

 Elisa Assays. Human Aβ 40/42 was measured in cell culture media by ELISA in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Detailed information is pro-
vided in SI Materials and Methods.
Immunoprecipitation/Western Blot Analysis. Antibody 6E10 (Covance) was used
to immunoprecipitate APP-C141 from cell lysates. Primary antibodies used for
Western blot analyses included antibody 6E10 (Covance) to identify sAPPα, APP-
βCTF, and FL-APP; antibody RU369 to identify APP-CTFs, RU anti-sAPPβ to
identify sAPPβ, and anti-Lamp 2 (Abcam) to identify Lamp 2; and anti-NICD
(Cell Signaling Technology) to identify cleaved Notch1. Western blots analyses
were otherwise carried out as reported previously (11) using SDS/PAGE and
electrotransference to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore).
Notch-1 Cleavage Assay. mNotchΔe lacking most of the Notch extracellular
domain was transiently transfected into N2a WT cells as reported previously
(11). mNotchΔe processing by γ-secretase was detected by Western blot
analysis using anti-NICD antibody.
Lysosome Purification. Lysosomes were purified using the Pierce Lysosome
Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in accordi the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Detailed information is provided in SI Materials and Methods.
In Vitro BACE Activity: Fluorogenic Peptide Assay. To measure BACE activity
in vitro, 1 μM fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-SEVNLDAEFRK(Dpn)RR-NH2
(R&D Systems) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 nM rhBACE1 (R&D Sys-
tems). After incubation, fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 405 nm)
was monitored using an Envision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer). A specific
concentration of Gleevec constituted each test condition. The positive control
was 5 μM BACE Inhibitor IV, and the negative control (vehicle) was DMSO.
In Vitro BACE Activity: BACE Cleavage of APP-C140. APP C140 was purified from
Escherichia coli using affinity purification. Then 1 μM APP-C140 was incubated
with 100 ng of rhBACE in the presence of Gleevec, BACE Inhibitor IV (positive
control), or DMSO (negative control) for 1 h at 37 °C. BACE processing of APP-
C140 was assayed by Western blot analysis using antibody RU369 to detect
APP-βCTF, the immediate BACE cleavage product of APP.
Live Cell Imaging. N2a 695 cells were used for live cell imaging. Detailed in-
formation is provided in SI Materials and Methods.
