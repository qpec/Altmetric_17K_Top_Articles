ABSTRACT
Nestin-expressing hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells are located in the bulge area of the
follicle. Previous studies have shown that HAP stem cells can differentiate to neurons, glia, keratinocytes,
smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. HAP stem cells effected nerve and spinal cord regeneration
in mouse models. Recently, we demonstrated that HAP stem cells differentiated to beating cardiac muscle
cells. The differentiation potential to cardiac muscle cells was greatest in the upper part of the follicle. The
beat rate of the cardiac muscle cells was stimulated by isoproterenol. In the present study, we observed
that isoproterenol directs HAP stem cells to differentiate to cardiac muscle cells in large numbers in
culture compared to HAP stem cells not supplemented with isoproterenol. The addition of activin A, bone
morphogenetic protein 4, and basic fibroblast growth factor, along with isoproternal, induced the cardiac
muscle cells to form tissue sheets of beating heart muscle cells. These results demonstrate that HAP stem
cells have great potential to form beating cardiac muscle cells in tissue sheets.

Introduction
Nestin-expressing hair follicle cells were discovered in trans-
genic mice with nestin-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-
GFP).1-4 We have termed these cells hair follicle-associated plu-
ripotent (HAP) stem cells.5
The HAP stem cells can differentiate into neurons, glial cells,
smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes and other cell types.3 HAP
stem cells originate in the bulge area (BA) of the hair follicle and
migrate to the dermal papilla (DP). HAP stem cells from the DP
and BA cells differentiated into neuronal and glial cells after
transplantation to the injured spinal cord of mice and enhanced
injury repair and locomotor recovery within 4 weeks.6-8
HAP stem cells from mouse whisker follicles formed nerve-
like structures contained b-III tubulin-positive fibers9 in Gel-
foam® histoculture. The growing fibers had growth cones on
their tips expressing F-actin, indicating they were growing
axons. These results suggest a major function of HAP stem cells
is for growth of the hair follicle sensory nerve.9
Recently, we demonstrated that HAP stem cells can differen-
tiate to beating cardiac muscle cells. The beat rate of the cardiac
muscle cells was stimulated by isoproterenol and inhibited by
propranolol.10
In the present study, we demonstrate that isoproterenol
directs HAP stem cells to differentiate to cardiac muscle cells,
and that the further addition of activin A, bone morphogenetic
protein 4 (BMP4), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
resulted in the formation of beating cardiac-muscle tissue sheets.
Results and discussion
Isoproterenol directs the differentiation of HAP cells into
cardiac muscle cells
The mouse vibrissa hair follicle was separated into 3 parts
(upper, middle, lower). The upper part of the follicle was placed
on MatrigelTM and cultured for 14 days with 10% FBS in
DMEM supplemented with isoproterenol alone, or the combi-
nation of isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and bFGF once every
four days, or no supplement (Fig. 1A). Cardiac muscle cells
were observed in all conditions after 14 days culture. Immunos-
taining demonstrated that hair follicles cultured in inducing
conditions supplemented with isoproterenol alone, or the com-
bination of isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and bFGF, had
increased differentiation to cardiac muscle cells compared with
non-supplemented conditions (Fig. 1B).
Flow cytometry analysis showed that the cardiac muscle cells
were formed in non-supplemented medium at 8.78 § 3.60%;
formed in medium supplemented with isoproterenol alone at
19.71 § 2.20%), and formed in medium supplemented with the

 combination of isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and bFGF at
16.84 § 1.67%. The number of differentiated cTnT-positive
cardiac muscle cells increased in the hair follicle cultures sup-
plemented with isoproterenol alone or isoproterenol, activin A,
BMP4 and bFGF compared with non-supplemented medium.
There was no significant difference in the extent of differentia-
tion of cardiac muscle cells between medium supplemented
with isoproterenol alone and medium supplemented with the
combination of isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and bFGF
(Fig. 2B).
The combination of isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4, and
bFGF induced HAP stem cells to form beating cardiac-
muscle tissue sheets
In order to investigate establishment of cardiac-muscle tissue
sheets, the upper parts of 5 hair follicles from GFP-expressing
mice were placed on Matrigel
TM in glass bottom culture dishes
and
cultured
for
14
days
with
10%
FBS
in
DMEM,
supplemented with isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and bFGF
once every four days (Fig. 3A). Cells grew from hair follicles,
proliferated and adhered to the culture dish bottom. Then, the
proliferating cells overlaid the hair follicles. Some of the cells
started beating. The cardiac muscle cells spread around the hair
follicles (Fig. 3A, Supplemental Video 1). On the 10th day of
culture, we observed beating sheets layered over the hair fol-
licles (Fig. 3A, Supplemental video 2). Immunostaining of the
beating cardiac-muscle tissue sheets showed that the cardiac-
muscle cells were distributed within the sheets (Fig. 3B).
Flow cytometry analysis of the harvested cardiac-muscle tis-
sue sheets showed that sheets contained 38.88 § 6.64% cTnT-
positive cardiac muscle cells; 22.19 § 6.39% CD31-positive vas-
cular endothelial cells; and 29.58 § 6.11% smooth muscle
actin-positive cells (Fig. 4A). Intercellular Ca2C was observed in
the beating cardiac-muscle tissue sheets using Fluo-3 (Fig. 4B).
To increase cardiac-muscle sheet formation, 10 cultures of 5
upper parts of hair follicles were placed on the bottom of glass
culture dishes that were supplemented with isoproterenol

 alone, the combination isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and
bFGF, or not supplemented. After 14 days of culture, the
hair-follicle cultures supplemented with the combination of
isoproterenol, activin A, BMP4 and bFGF formed beating car-
diac-muscle tissue sheets at 65.0 § 5.77%. In contrast, cardiac-
muscle tissue sheets were not formed in the non-supplemented
cultures or in cultures supplemented with isoproterenol alone
(Fig. 4C).
Wang et al.11 have shown that transplantation of mesenchymal
stem cells significantly increased local recruitment of macrophages
to facilitate cardiac muscle repair. Wada et al.12 reported that
induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated
from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo by transduction
of 3 transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively
termed GMT. Berry et al.13 reported that nestin-expressing intersti-
tial cells can differentiate to cardiomyocytes, which could be used
for regeneration of the dystrophic heart. Sawa et al.14 reported that
the transplantation of neonatal cardiomyocyte or myoblast sheets
could improve cardiac function in heart failure in animal models.
Kawamura et al.15 reported that the transplantation of human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs)
or hiPS-CM sheets could improve cardiac function in a porcine
ischemic cardiomyopathy model. The transplantation of hiPS-
CMs sheets along with a pedicled omental flap resulted in a new
myocardium.16
In the present study, we demonstrate that HAP stem cell
differentiation to beating cardiac muscle cells was directed
by isoproterenol and that further additions of activin A,
BMP4, and bFGF resulted in the formation of beating car-
diac-muscle tissue sheets. The method described here is
appropriate for future use of human hair follicles to grow
nestin-expressing HAP stem cells in sufficient quantities to
differentiate into heart muscle sheets to be used for heart
muscle regeneration in the clinic.

 Materials and methods
GFP transgenic mice
C57BL/6-EGFP mice (GFP mice) were used to isolate the
vibrissa hair follicles.17 All animal experiments were conducted
according to the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation at
Kitasato University.
Isolation of vibrissa hair follicles and differentiation to
cardiac muscle cells
The vibrissa hair follicles from GFP mice were isolated as
described previously.10 For differentiation to cardiac muscle
cells, the upper part of hair follicles were layered onto
Matrigel
TM(BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in 35 mm glass-bot-
tom culture dish (MatTeK corporation, Ashland, MA). The
follicles were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 mg/ml gen-
tamycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY),
10 mM Hepes (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), supple-
mented with isoproterenol (3 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich) alone, or
in combination with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)
(10 ng /ml ) (HumanZyme, Chicago, IL); activin A (10 ng /ml)
(HumanZyme); basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (5 ng
/ml) (Millipore, Temecula, CA). Beating cardiac muscle cells
and cardiac-muscle tissue sheets were visualized and recorded
with a BioStation IM-Q (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and video
microscope camera (ScopPad-500, GelleX, Tokyo, Japan).

 Immunofluorescence staining
The cells were incubated with anti-cardiac toroponin T (cTnT)
mouse monoclonal antibody (1:250, Gene Tex, Hsinchu City,
Taiwan) in blocking buffer (4% BSA, 0.5% Triton X100, 0.04%
NaN3 in PBS) at room temperature for 3 hours. The cells were
then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with
Alexa Flour 568® (1:400, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon)
and 40, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI)
(Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer for 2h at room tempera-
ture. The images were visualized using a LSM 710 microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Flow cytometry
The cells were incubated with anti-cTnT mouse monoclonal anti-
body (1:200) and anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA) mouse monoclo-
nal antibody (1:200; Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) as the primary
antibody and phycoerythrin (PE)-anti-mouse CD31 rat monoclonal
antibody (1:200, BD science). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-
mouse IgG H&L phycoerythrin (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
The cells were analyzed by FACS Verse (BD Bioscience), were ana-
lyzed by FACS suite
TM software (BD Bioscience). Flow cytometry
analyses were repeated in triplicate.
Intracellular calcium imaging
The cells were washed with HEPES Ringer solution at 37�C,
and were loaded with Fluo-3AM (Molecular Probes) for
20 min at 37�C. Fluo-3-AM fluorescence (excitation at 508nm
and emission at 527 nm) of beating cardiac sheets was mea-
sured every 150 msec with the LSM 710 microscope.
Statistical analysis
The experimental data are expressed as the mean § SD. Statis-
tical analyses were performed with the unpaired Student’s t-test
with a P-value of <0.05 considered significant.
Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest
No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.
