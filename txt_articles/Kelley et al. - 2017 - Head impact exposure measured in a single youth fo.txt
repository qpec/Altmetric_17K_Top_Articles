pproximAtely 5 million athletes play organized 
football in the United States—2000 National 
Football League (NFL), 100,000 college, 1.3 mil-
lion high school, and 3.5 million youth players.11,16,30 Even 
though youth athletes make up the largest proportion of 
football participants, youth football has seen declines in 
participation in recent years.36,37 Several factors may be 
contributing to the decline in participation; concern over 
injuries, the high prevalence of concussions, and the long-
term effects of repetitive head impacts in particular have 
been suggested as major reasons.1,6,15,24 Increased public 
awareness and improved concussion management have 
contributed to increases in the number of concussions 
evaluated by clinicians;40 however, the relationship be-
tween youth sports participation and long-term neurologi-
cal deficits is still not well understood. There are conflict-
ing results of studies comparing the long-term neurocog-
nitive ability of professional football players who began 
playing tackle football before 12 years of age or prior to 
high school and those who began playing later.35,38 Addi-
tionally, several imaging and neurocognitive studies have 
evaluated the effect of repetitive subconcussive impacts

OBJECTIVE This study evaluated the frequency, magnitude, and location of head impacts in practice drills within a 
youth football team to determine how head impact exposure varies among different types of drills.
METHODS On-field head impact data were collected from athletes participating in a youth football team for a single 
season. Each athlete wore a helmet instrumented with a Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System head acceleration mea-
surement device during all preseason, regular season, and playoff practices. Video was recorded for all practices, and 
video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each head impact to a specific drill. Eleven drills were 
identified: dummy/sled tackling, install, special teams, Oklahoma, one-on-one, open-field tackling, passing, position skill 
work, multiplayer tackle, scrimmage, and tackling drill stations. Generalized linear models were fitted to log-transformed 
data, and Wald tests were used to assess differences in head accelerations and impact rates.
RESULTS A total of 2125 impacts were measured during 30 contact practices in 9 athletes (mean age 11.1 ± 0.6 years, 
mean mass 44.9 ± 4.1 kg). Open-field tackling had the highest median and 95th percentile linear accelerations (24.7g 
and 97.8g, respectively) and resulted in significantly higher mean head accelerations than several other drills. The multi-
player tackle drill resulted in the highest head impact frequency, with an average of 0.59 impacts per minute per athlete, 
but the lowest 95th percentile linear accelerations of all drills. The front of the head was the most common impact loca-
tion for all drills except dummy/sled tackling.
CONCLUSIONS Head impact exposure varies significantly in youth football practice drills, with several drills exposing 
athletes to high-magnitude and/or high-frequency head impacts. These data suggest that further study of practice drills 
is an important step in developing evidence-based recommendations for modifying or eliminating certain high-intensity 
drills to reduce head impact exposure and injury risk for all levels of play.

over the course of a single season at youth, high school, 
and college levels and have demonstrated a relationship 
between measurable changes in white matter integrity and 
cognition with head impact exposure (HIE).2,3,13,22,25 How-
ever, the nature of the relationship of HIE to imaging and 
neurocognitive results is not fully understood, and con-
flicting results have been reported, although the conflicts 
may be due to methodological variations. Further research 
is needed to increase understanding of the effects of ex-
posure to repetitive head impacts. In particular, HIE data, 
including magnitude, location, and frequency, need to be 
evaluated in the context of the associated activities con-
tributing to the head impacts.
Head impact exposure has been studied at youth, high 
school, collegiate, and professional levels. Although the 
amount of available HIE data for youth-level football play-
ers has been limited, compared with data for high school 
and college players, there have been notable findings from 
past studies.9,17,28,31–33 Results from several studies showed 
that youth football players sustain head impacts approach-
ing the magnitude of those sustained by high school and 
college football players.9,11,39 A study of HIE in youth 
football athletes aged 7–8 years showed that the major-
ity of high-level impacts (> 80g) occur during practice 
rather than games.11 In a recent study, Campolettano et al.8 
evaluated practice drills associated with high-magnitude 
(> 40g) head impacts and found that a greater proportion 
of impacts exceeding 40g occurred in tackling drills com-
pared with skill-type drills, even though approximately 
twice as much time was spent on skill-type drills.
In an effort to reduce the risk of concussion and over-
all HIE, some football organizations have taken steps to 
implement rule changes that affect practice structure. For 
example, in 2012 the Pop Warner youth football program 
limited the amount of contact allowed at each practice 
(one-third of total weekly practice time or 40 minutes 
total at each practice) and eliminated full-speed head-on 
blocking or tackling drills where athletes start more than 
3 yards apart.29 Cobb et al.9 studied the effect of limit-
ing contact in practices in youth football by comparing 1 
team that adopted these practice limitations and 2 teams 
that did not. Players participating on the team with con-
tact limitations in practice had 37%–46% fewer head 
impacts for the entire season than those on the 2 teams 
that did not implement contact limitations.9 Football or-
ganizations have also implemented educational programs 
such as the Heads Up Football program (http://usafoot-
ball.com/headsup) to train coaches on tackling technique, 
proper equipment fitting, and strategies to reduce player-
to-player contact and concussions.19,26 A study evaluating 
the effectiveness of the Heads Up Football program found 
that leagues implementing this program accumulated sig-
nificantly fewer head impacts per practice than leagues 
that did not.19
These studies have shown that HIE can be influenced 
by the rules, regulations, and practice structure used by 
coaches, leagues, and organizations. However, there is 
only a limited understanding of how HIE varies among 
specific practice drills. The objective of this study was 
to evaluate the frequency, magnitude, and location of all 
head impacts in practice drills within a single youth foot-
ball team through biomechanical data collection and de-
tailed video analysis.
Methods
On-field head impact data from athletes participating 
in a local youth football team were collected during 1 
season of play. The study protocol was approved by the 
Wake Forest School of Medicine institutional review 
board, and participant assent and parental written con-
sent were properly acquired for participation in the study. 
The athletes enrolled in the study were participants in 
a youth football league affiliated with American Youth 
Football (AYF), in which athletes range in age from 6 to 
14 years and are placed on teams based on age and weight 
guidelines of AYF. The athletes evaluated in this study 
participated in a team with athletes meeting the age and 
weight requirements of 10 years or younger with a maxi-
mum weight of 124 lbs or 11 years old with a maximum 
weight of 104 lbs. For example, an 11-year-old weighing 
100 lbs would be placed on this team, but an 11-year-old 
weighing 110 lbs would be placed on the next (higher) 
age- and weight-restricted team. Participation in the 
study was voluntary and the athletes had to properly fit 
into a Riddell Speed youth medium size or larger helmet 
to qualify for inclusion in the study. A certified athletic 
trainer was present at all practices and games to monitor 
athletes, regardless of participation in the study, for signs 
and symptoms of a concussion and assist in assessing any 
injuries. The athletic trainer documented all injuries that 
occurred in practices and games. If an athlete reported 
symptoms or showed signs of a concussion, the athletic 
trainer completed a Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 
(SCAT) evaluation, asked about the athlete’s symptoms, 
and tested for cognition and balance.10 If a concussion 
was suspected, the athlete was referred to a sports medi-
cine physician who would evaluate the athlete and con-
firm the diagnosis.23
Head impact data were collected by instrumenting the 
helmets of youth football players with the Head Impact 
Telemetry (HIT) System head acceleration measurement 
device (developed by Simbex) during all preseason, regu-
lar season, and playoff practices. Each study participant 
was issued and properly fitted with a Riddell Speed helmet 
with the HIT System installed. The HIT System measures 
location and magnitude of head impacts with an encoder, 
which is an array of 6 spring-mounted single-axis acceler-
ometers oriented perpendicular to the surface of the head, 
a telemetry unit, a data storage device, and a battery pack. 
The encoder fits within the existing padding structure 
of a Riddell Speed helmet. The spring-mounted accel-
erometer design allows the encoder to remain in contact 
with the head throughout the duration of a head impact, 
ensuring measurement of head acceleration, not helmet 
acceleration.21 Data acquisition is triggered each time an 
instrumented helmet receives an impact greater than 10g, 
and a total of 40 msec of data with 8 msec of pre-trigger 
data are recorded at 1000 Hz. The data from the encoder 
are transmitted via radio wave transmission to the side-
line base unit. The data are then used to compute peak 
resultant linear accelerations, estimated peak resultant ro-

tational acceleration, location of impact, and other biome-
chanical indicators. The HIT System has been described 
in the literature and has been found to reliably compute 
peak linear acceleration, peak rotational acceleration, and 
impact location.4,5
Video was recorded for all practices, and postpractice 
video analysis was performed to ensure that head impacts 
occurred while the athletes were helmeted and to pair 
the video with the biomechanical data. For each drill, the 
name of the drill, start time, and end time were recorded 
such that each head impact was identified as belonging to 
a specific drill. Drill names and descriptions were pro-
vided by the coaches for the team at the beginning of the 
season and were classified as dummy/sled tackling, install, 
special teams, multiplayer tackle, Oklahoma, one-on-one, 
open-field tackling, passing, position skill work, scrim-
mage, and tackling drill stations (Table 1).
Head impact data collected over the season were used 
to quantify HIE for all practice drills in terms of rate, lo-
cation of impact, and mean, median, and 95th percentile 
of head acceleration. The impact rate for each drill was 
quantified by dividing the number of impacts an athlete 
experienced for a drill in a practice by the time spent on 
that drill on that practice day. Generalized linear models 
were fitted, and Wald tests were used to assess differences 
among athletes and drills in the associated linear and ro-
tational accelerations and the impact rate. For inference, 
log transformations were applied for all analyses due to 
the right-skewed distribution of the data. A Bonferroni 
correction was applied for all statistical tests to identify 
significant pairwise differences while maintaining the 
overall alpha level at 0.05. All statistical analyses were 
performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute 
Inc.). Mean values are reported with standard deviations 
and 95% confidence intervals where appropriate.
Results
A total of 2125 head impacts were recorded in 9 indi-
vidual athletes during 30 contact practices. An additional 
46 impacts were excluded from the analysis because they 
occurred during 6 noncontact practices (i.e., helmet only) 
throughout the season. The mean age and mass of the ath-
letes on the team were 11.1 ± 0.6 years and 44.9 ± 4.1 
kg, respectively. The median and 95th percentile linear 
and rotational accelerations of all contact practice head 
impacts were 20.2g and 56.4g and 961.8 and 2337.3 rad/
sec2, respectively. The distribution of the number of head 
impacts experienced during all contact practices in a sea-
son for each athlete was right skewed and ranged from 83 
to 459 head impacts, with a median value of 231 impacts. 
A summary of the total number of head impacts sustained 
by each athlete during all contact practices and their 95th 
percentile linear acceleration is shown in Fig. 1. All ath-
letes were monitored by a certified athletic trainer for 
signs and symptoms of concussion, and no head impacts 
measured in this study resulted in a clinically diagnosed 
concussion. During practices, only 2 muscle strain injuries 
were observed among all of the athletes on this team.
The distribution of head impact magnitudes varied 
among the 11 practice drills, and impact magnitude was 
not proportional to the frequency or number of head im-
pacts (Fig. 2). A summary of HIE data for each drill is 
shown in Table 2. Despite only accounting for 2% of all 
practice head impacts, open-field tackling accounted for 
10% of practice head impacts ≥ 60g and 17% of prac-
tice head impacts ≥ 80g. The install drill resulted in the 
highest number of impacts, 56% of practice impacts, but 
only 43% of impacts ≥ 60g and 41% of impacts ≥ 80g. 
The drills with the lowest-magnitude head impacts were 
dummy/sled tackling, passing, and multiplayer tackle.

Pairwise comparisons resulted in statistically signifi-
cant differences in mean linear and rotational accelera-
tion among drills (Fig. 3). Open-field tackling and one-
on-one had significantly greater mean linear accelerations 
than many other drills practiced by this team. Oklahoma 
and tackling drill stations had significantly greater mean 
linear acceleration than passing. Additionally, open-field 
tackling had a significantly greater mean rotational accel-
eration than dummy/sled tackling, install, special teams, 
passing, and tackling drill stations.
Impact rate was described in terms of the mean number 
of impacts per minute per player, and pairwise compari-
sons were made among drills (Table 2). Multiplayer tackle 
had the highest impact rate, which was significantly great-
er than the impact rate for dummy/sled tackling, install, 
special teams, open-field tackling, passing, and position 
skill work. Oklahoma and one-on-one also had relatively 
high impact rates. The drills with the lowest impact rate 
were dummy/sled tackling and position skill work.
All impacts and impacts with peak linear acceleration 
≥ 60g were evaluated according to impact location (Fig. 
4). The threshold of 60g was chosen because it is a com-
monly used threshold in other similar studies of HIE.7,9,34 
Impacts to the front of the helmet were most common for 
all drills, except dummy/sled tackling. When only impacts 
≥ 60g were considered, impacts to the top of the helmet 
were most common in the Oklahoma, one-on-one, open-
field tackling, and position skill work drills (50%, 86%, 
44%, and 50%, respectively). Impacts to the front of the 
helmet were most common for impacts ≥ 60g during in-
stall, multiplayer tackle, and tackling drill stations (45%, 
100%, and 67%, respectively). There were no impacts ≥ 
60g for dummy/sled tackling and passing.
Discussion
Head impact exposure in practice can be reduced by 
implementing rules, modifying practice structure, and 
educating coaches and leagues on methods to reduce 
concussion risk, but our understanding of HIE within 
specific practice drills and activities has so far been lim-
ited.5,9,11,14,19,31,32,39 The physiological thresholds for adverse 
effects from repetitive and/or concussive head impacts are 
not well understood; however, by quantifying HIE in foot-
ball practice drills, this study is an important step in an 
evidence-based approach to modifying rules and practice 
structure to reduce HIE and head injury risk. In addition, 
because of the increasing numbers of concussions being 
evaluated by clinicians and the growing concern over 
the harmful effects of subconcussive impacts, clinicians 
must become better informed regarding the potential ef-
fects of sport-related activity (e.g., practice drills) on their 
patients’ health. Results from this study demonstrate sig-
nificant variability in HIE among youth football practice 
drills, with tackling drills generally having a distribution 
of higher-magnitude impacts and contact drills with mul-
tiplayer involvement resulting in higher impact frequency.
In this study, open-field tackling resulted in the highest

median and 95th-percentile linear and rotational accelera-
tions (Table 2), with significantly greater mean linear and 
rotational acceleration compared with several of the other 
drills practiced by the team. This drill occurred in only 5 
practices, and with a mean impact rate of 0.18 impacts per 
minute per player it resulted in a relatively small contribu-
tion to the total number of impacts in a single practice 
and the entire season. The high head acceleration values in 
this drill are most likely due to the athletes tackling at full 
speed and starting more than 3 yards apart from each oth-
er. Increased head impact severity with increased closing 
distance has been shown in a previous study; Ocwieja et 
al. found that head impacts with a longer closing distance 
(> 10 yards) between athletes resulted in significantly in-
creased linear and rotational head accelerations than im-
pacts with shorter closing distances.27 Although the distri-
bution of impacts in the open-field tackling drill involved 
impacts of higher magnitude than those typically seen in 
games at the youth level of play,9 high-magnitude impacts 
resulting from full-speed tackling scenarios do occur in 
games and it may be beneficial to introduce proper and 
safe technique in these high-speed tackling scenarios in 
a practice environment.12,27 However, coaches and athletic 
trainers should be aware of possible high-magnitude im-
pacts in this drill.
The one-on-one tackling drill was similar to open-
field tackling as both were player-versus-player tackling 
drills, but the one-on-one drill had a closing distance of 
less than 3 yards and there was a greater focus on improv-
ing form and technique rather than simulating full-speed 
scenarios. Although this drill resulted in high-magnitude 
impacts, the shorter closing distance between athletes and 
the lower speed of tackling may have partially contributed 
to lower head impact magnitudes measured in one-on-one 
tackling than in open-field tackling.27 However, there was 
a higher impact rate in the one-on-one than in the open-
field tackling drill, which was possibly due to the shorter 
closing distance, allowing for more iterations of the drill 
to be completed in a drill session.

ed rule changes in 2012 to eliminate full-speed head-on 
blocking or tackling drills with a closing distance between 
athletes greater than 3 yards and to reduce contact at prac-
tice to either 40 minutes total of each practice or one-third 
of the total weekly practice time.29 Kerr et al. compared 
injury rates among youth football players whose teams had 
implemented the educational program Heads Up Football 
and/or Pop Warner practice guidelines with players whose 
teams had not.18 The authors found that teams implement-
ing Heads Up Football and/or Pop Warner rule changes 
had lower injury rates in practices than teams that did not 
implement either.18 However, the Pop Warner rule changes 
still permit full-speed drills where the athletes approach 
at an angle, but not straight ahead, which is comparable 
to the open-field tackling drill practiced by this team. The 
results presented in the current study, along with those 
from Kerr et al., support the importance of instilling 
proper technique in an effort to reduce head contact and 
indicate that considerations may be made to modify open-
field tackling drills such that the athletes start at a shorter

closing distance or remove this drill entirely from youth 
football practice structures.27
The Oklahoma drill resulted in the second highest num-
ber of impacts per athlete (Table 2). The high impact rate 
during Oklahoma is partially due to this drill involving 
4–6 athletes in each play, rather than just 2 as seen in the 
player-versus-player drills, so each athlete participates in 
more iterations of this drill during a practice. Multiplayer 
tackle had the highest impact rate of all drills evaluated in 
this study but a distribution of relatively low-magnitude 
impacts, with the lowest 95th percentile linear acceleration 
of all drills (44.1g). Although multiplayer tackle is a tack-
ling drill, it is more focused on blocking and improving 
footwork than tackling the opposing player to the ground, 
unlike Oklahoma, in which the focus is more on replicat-
ing full-speed tackling scenarios and the movement of 
players is restricted within a chute. Additionally, the Okla-
homa drill includes a ball carrier and ends when the ball 
carrier is tackled or successfully evades the tackler, where-
as in multiplayer tackle there is no ball carrier and the drill 
ends when the defender is either stopped by the blockers 
or successfully evades the blockers (i.e., tackles a dummy 
or tags a coach who is in place of the quarterback). The 
shift in focus and drill setup for multiplayer tackle may 
explain why this drill resulted in lower-magnitude impacts 
but higher impact frequency than in other tackling drills.
Install was the most commonly practiced drill, result-
ing in the largest proportion of all practice impacts. How-
ever, the impact rate was significantly lower in this drill 
than in several of the tackling drills (Table 2). The lower 
impact rate may be due to the fact that coaches spend more 
time on instruction. In addition there was often a progres-
sion in the amount of contact in this drill, with the first 
few iterations typically being slower and involving only 
limited contact, and later progressing to more full-speed 
scenarios. Campolettano et al.8 found that the offense 
versus defense drill, similar to the install drill but with 
overall fewer players, had an impact rate similar to that of 
tackling drills in their study. However, Campolettano et al. 
also studied the offense or defense drill, which involved 
11 offense or defense players with 3–4 proxy players on 
the other side and had a low impact rate due to the focus 
on positioning and execution of plays rather than on intra-
team scrimmage.8 Although Campolettano et al. focused 
on impacts greater than 40g, a comparison with the install 
drill observed in the present study suggests that focusing 
initially on positioning and execution of plays, and gradu-
ally increasing the amount of contact can reduce impact 
frequency and impact magnitude.8 Scrimmage was similar 
to the install drill; however, the scrimmage drill was prac-
ticed between adjacent age- and weight-based teams. The 
team in our study only did the scrimmage drill with each 
adjacent (i.e., above and below) age and weight level once, 
each on separate practice days. The distributions of head 
acceleration values in this drill were comparable to those 
in the install drill, but the impact rate was higher for the 
scrimmage drill (Table 2). Nevertheless, more studies are 
needed to compare HIE data obtained during install drills 
and during scrimmage with adjacent age- and weight-clas-
sified teams in practice.
We also evaluated head impact data according to hel-
met impact location. The most common impact location 
for all drills, except dummy/sled tackling, was the front 
of the helmet. A distribution with the highest number of 
impacts occurring at the front of the helmet is similar to 
findings in other studies of football athletes.9,11,39,41 How-
ever, when only impacts ≥ 60g were evaluated, the top of 
the helmet was the most common impact location during 
open-field tackling, Oklahoma, one-on-one, and position 
skill work drills. This finding could be indicative of im-
proper tackling technique, with athletes leading with their 
heads instead of leading with their shoulders while keep-
ing their heads up. Studies of HIE of football athletes typi-
cally report the top of the helmet as having a distribution 
of the highest linear acceleration.9,11,41 More in-depth video 
analysis of tackling technique and head impact surface 
(e.g., helmet, player, or ground) is needed to better under-
stand how tackling technique can be improved to lower 
HIE. The most common location for impacts ≥ 60g during 
tackling drill stations was the front of the helmet, unlike 
other tackling drills. Due to the higher ratio of coaches to 
athletes in this drill, the coaches may have been able to 
better correct improper tackling technique, although fur-
ther analysis of coach corrective behavior is needed to ful-
ly understand how coach interaction might influence HIE.
A few limitations of this study should be noted. First, 
only 9 athletes were sampled from 1 youth football team. 
This sample size is small compared with sample sizes in 
some other studies at the high school and collegiate lev-
el.20,39 The 9 youth athletes participating in this study dem-
onstrated variations in overall HIE, which could be due to 
differences in the athletes’ involvement in practices and in-
dividual intensity. A sensitivity analysis removing individ-
ual athletes attenuated the strength of some relationships 
presented here; however, the general trends and overall 
conclusions of the study remained unchanged. The results 
of this study are also limited to a single youth football or-
ganization. The setup and technique that are being taught 
for each practice drill will be coach, league, and organiza-
tion dependent; therefore, athletes on different teams may 
experience different HIEs while practicing similar drills. 
However, this study of HIE in youth football practice drills 
is ongoing, and future work will be conducted to evalu-
ate HIE in specific practice drills for multiple seasons and 
across multiple age- and weight-based teams at the youth 
level. Several studies have shown that football players in 
older age groups (i.e., high school and college) experience 
higher-severity impacts more frequently, so further study 
of HIE in drills in older age groups would also increase 
our understanding of practice-related HIE and injury 
risk.7,17 The impact rate metric, impacts per minute per 
player, only takes into account measured impacts; it does 
not consider instances of no impact while participating in 
the drill. Lastly, the HIT System, which was used for bio-
mechanical data collection, has some measurement error, 
but the error in 5 degrees of freedom (5DOF) acceleration 
measurements are within the range of acceptable error for 
other measurement devices and methods.4
Conclusions
In this study we quantified HIE in 11 youth football

practice drills for a single age- and weight-restricted 
youth football team and demonstrated that HIE varies 
significantly between drills. Open-field tackling had a 
distribution of the highest head accelerations (compared 
with all other drills studied), and these data suggest 
that full-speed tackling drills with a closing distance of 
greater than 3 yards apart can result in high-magnitude 
impacts. The multiplayer tackle drill resulted in a dis-
tribution of relatively low head accelerations compared 
with other tackling drills, which may be due to a great-
er focus on blocking rather than tackling the opposing 
player(s) to the ground, but this drill resulted in the high-
est head impact rate. For all practice impacts, the highest 
percentage of impacts occurred at the front of the helmet, 
but for impacts ≥ 60g the highest percentage of impacts 
occurred at the top of the helmet. These findings con-
tribute to and improve our understanding of HIE in the 
youth football population. Along with future research, 
these data may be used to inform health professionals, 
so that they can better advocate for their patients’ safety. 
These data can also inform coaches, leagues, and organi-
zations about practice drills that may expose athletes to 
more frequent or higher-magnitude head impacts as well 
as methods to restructure practice drills and implement 
rules to reduce HIE.
