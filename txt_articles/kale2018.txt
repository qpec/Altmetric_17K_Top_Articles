Introduction
In our healthcare systems, people interact with their primary 
care providers to engage in patient centered, comprehensive, 
and continuing care that includes disease prevention/health 
promotion, education and counseling, and diagnosis and 
treatment of new or ongoing problems.1 The specter of over‑
diagnosis, largely unrecognized and unmentioned, lurks 
behind much diagnostic testing performed in primary care.
Overdiagnosis is defined as the diagnosis of a condi‑
tion (often subsequently treated), that would otherwise 
not cause symptoms or harm to a patient during his or her 
lifetime.2 It has long been recognized as a consequence 
of cancer screening but in recent years has increasingly 
been acknowledged as an important consequence of any 
diagnostic testing in the absence of symptoms.3‑5 However, 
overdiagnosis remains the “elephant in the examination 
room” for a variety of patient, provider, and sociocultural 
reasons, including confusion surrounding the meaning of

ABSTRACT
Overdiagnosis, is defined as the diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognized, would 
not cause symptoms or harm a patient during his or her lifetime, and it is increas-
ingly acknowledged as a consequence of screening for cancer and other conditions. 
Because preventive care is a crucial component of primary care, which is delivered to 
the broad population, overdiagnosis in primary care is an important problem from a 
public health perspective and has far reaching implications. The scope of overdiag-
nosis as a result of services delivered in primary care is unclear, though overdiagno-
sis of indolent breast, prostate, thyroid, and lung cancers is well described and over-
diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder is also recognized. However, overdiagnosis is a known consequence of all 
screening and can be assumed to occur in many more clinical contexts. Overdiagno-
sis can harm patients by leading to overtreatment (with associated potential toxici-
ties), diagnosis related anxiety or depression, and labeling, or through financial bur-
den. Many entrenched factors facilitate overdiagnosis, including the growing use of 
advanced diagnostic technology, financial incentives, a medical culture that encour-
ages greater use of tests and treatments, limitations in the evidence that obscure 
the understanding of diagnostic utility, use of non-beneficial screening tests, and the 
broadening of disease definitions. Efforts to reduce overdiagnosis are hindered by 
physicians’ and patients’ lack of awareness of the problem and by confusion about 
terminology, with overdiagnosis often conflated with related concepts. Clarity of ter-
minology would facilitate physicians’ understanding of the problem and the growth 
in evidence regarding its prevalence and downstream consequences in primary care. 
It is hoped that international coordination regarding diagnostic standards for disease 
definitions will also help minimize overdiagnosis in the future.
CASE SCENARIO
RG is a 48 year old woman who sees a new primary care 
physician. She has a body mass index of 30 and reports that 
her mother has diabetes. The physician is concerned about 
RG’s obesity and, given her age and family history, orders a 
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) test to screen for diabetes. Her HbA1C 
is 6.0% and the patient is told she has pre-diabetes. She is 
encouraged to modify her diet, increase her exercise, and 
consider a drug to prevent diabetes and its complications. 
She makes a few changes to her diet and starts taking 
metformin. She experiences side effects from the metformin 
but is happy when her next HbA1C test result is 5.8%. Has this 
patient experienced an early diagnosis or overdiagnosis?

ual patient, the potential for overdiagnosis can be under‑
stood on the basis of the evidence of benefits and harms 
of screening. In the case of screening for diabetes, only 
recently has limited direct evidence shown that screen‑
ing improves clinical outcomes; in one European study 
of 1 900 000 patients, screening for diabetes in high risk 
people was associated with statistically significant reduc‑
tions in all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease 
events at 10 years (hazard ratio 0.84 (confidence interval 
0.80 to 0.89) for cardiovascular events).7 Randomized tri‑
als have shown that pre‑diabetes interventions (lifestyle 
and drugs) can prevent or delay the progression to type 2 
diabetes.8 However, a meta‑analysis of prospective obser‑
vational trials of progression rates from pre‑diabetes to 
diabetes found that more than half of people with pre‑
diabetes do not have diabetes after 10 years, suggesting 
that this condition often does not progress to clinically 
important disease, so that treatment in this situation 
would fulfill the definition of overdiagnosis.9
Given the high prevalence of diabetes, the many 
complications of untreated disease, and the benefit of 
screening at a population level, screening for diabetes 
is recommended in high risk groups in many countries 
including the United Kingdom,10 Canada,11 and the 
United States,8 despite the potential for overdiagnosis. 
In RG’s case, screening was consistent with guidelines 
from these countries. The case of pre‑diabetes illustrates 
the potential for overdiagnosis that exists in any screen‑
ing scenario. Overdiagnosis was first described in rela‑
tion to cancer screening.12 However, the potential for 
overdiagnosis accompanies screening for non‑cancer 
conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 
even a “screening” physical examination in an asympto‑
matic person. Theoretically, the potential for overdiagno‑
sis would be eliminated if important disease that would 
threaten health and require treatment could be accurately 
identified. However, perfect tests do not exist and all dis‑
eases occur along a clinical spectrum, so overdiagnosis 
remains.
Overdiagnosis, then, is inherent to the modern prac‑
tice of healthcare, which seeks to diagnose and mitigate 
disease before it is clinically evident. Figure 1 illustrates 
patterns of disease progression after diagnostic testing. 
The test in question could be an imaging test, a labora‑
tory test, a component of the physical examination, or 
even an interview question. Tests are intended to iden‑
tify clinically meaningful disease (green line), which if 
untreated will go on to threaten health or even become 
fatal. Treatment of these diseases will improve health. 
A subset of disease, however, will progress more slowly 
and will not threaten health before the patient’s death 
from other causes (purple line). Finally, some disease 
will never progress at all (pink line). The identification 
of patients with slowly progressive or non‑progressive 
disease represents overdiagnosis because treatment will 
not improve these patients’ health will but still expose 
them to potential harms.
Some level of overdiagnosis is unavoidable, owing in 
part to the unacknowledged trade‑off between minimiz‑
ing underdiagnosis and tolerating overdiagnosis. To opti‑
mize health, we seek to reduce underdiagnosis, or the 
In this review, we present an evidence based sum‑
mary of the scope of overdiagnosis related to screening 
of asymptomatic patients in primary care and provide 
clinical examples of how overdiagnosis is manifest in 
the primary care setting. We also clarify definitions of 
overdiagnosis and related terms, discuss drivers and 
consequences, and clarify the ways in which it can be 
documented and studied. Lastly, we suggest future steps 
to guide research and the implementation of discussions 
about overdiagnosis in primary care.
Sources and selection criteria
We began with a review of the literature to understand 
the scope of the published evidence related to overdiag‑
nosis in primary care, defining overdiagnosis as identifi‑
cation of a condition that would not cause clinical harm 
during the patient’s lifetime.6 We searched PubMed, 
Embase, and Web of Science on 29 August 2017 using 
combinations of the following terms: “over diagnosis”, 
overmedicaliz(s)ation, “medical overuse” [MeSH], “gen‑
eral practice”, “primary health care” [MeSH], and “gen‑
eral practice” [MeSH], with no language restriction. In 
addition, we hand searched references from relevant 
identified articles. We excluded letters and articles pub‑
lished only in abstract form. We excluded articles in 
which the definition of the term “overdiagnosis” differed 
from our operational definition. After reviewing 582 titles 
and abstracts, we identified 71 publications related to 
overdiagnosis in primary care, including primary stud‑
ies (n=19), systematic reviews and meta‑analyses (n=5), 
narrative reviews (n=26), editorials (n=14), guidelines 
(n=4), and other (n=3).
To understand the prevalence of overdiagnosis more 
fully, we performed a second search of the same three 
databases on 8 November 2017 to identify studies quan‑
tifying overdiagnosis but not limited to primary care. The 
second search identified 1073 papers, of which 46 quan‑
tified overdiagnosis. After reference tracking we added 
eight papers for a total of 54 papers.
In papers from our first search (overdiagnosis in rela‑
tion to primary care), cancer was most commonly men‑
tioned, specifically prostate (n=16) and breast (n=12), 
with fewer discussions of lung (n=5), colon (n=4), and 
thyroid (n=2) cancers (appendix table A). We also found 
articles about chronic kidney disease (n=5), depres‑
sion (n=4), neuroblastoma (n=3), and attention‑deficit/
hyperactivity‑disorder (n=5), with additional diseases 
mentioned in a single paper (appendix table B). From 
our search of overdiagnosis quantification, which was not 
limited to primary care, we found that overdiagnosis of 
breast cancer was most commonly measured (24 papers), 
followed by prostate cancer (n=10), lung cancer (n=8), 
and thyroid cancer (n=4). Other cancers and non‑cancer 
problems were covered in eight studies (appendix table 
C). The detailed content of the identified papers informed 
our analysis and discussion.
Context of overdiagnosis
In the case scenario, RG’s diagnosis of pre‑diabetes may 
represent overdiagnosis. Although it is impossible to

offset by the population level benefits of early diagnosis 
(and subsequent treatment) of true disease and therefore 
recommend risk assessment and targeted screening. Lim‑
iting screening to people at the highest risk can minimize 
(though not eliminate) overdiagnosis while maximizing 
benefit. However, to reduce overdiagnosis and its result‑
ant harms further we must also understand the factors 
that drive it.
Drivers of overdiagnosis
Several factors work independently and together to encour‑
age overdiagnosis (table 1).
Broadening disease definitions
Many diseases exist on a severity spectrum. Disease 
cut‑off points must be selected (for example, the blood 
pressure at which hypertension is considered) and are 
often chosen to minimize underdiagnosis, sometimes 
at the expense of high rates of overdiagnosis. Figure 2 
illustrates the impact of different diagnostic thresholds 
on numbers of patients diagnosed, harmed from disease, 
and harmed from treatment. In the absence of screening, 
many patients have delayed diagnosis, all patients have 
the potential to be harmed by their disease, and few are 
harmed from treatment of the disease. When screening 
is performed with a high diagnostic threshold for disease 
(for example, screening for diabetes with a high glucose 
cut‑off point), more patients are diagnosed compared 
with no screening, fewer have clinical harm from dis‑
ease, somewhat more are potentially harmed by treat‑
ment (because more are treated), and a small amount of 
overdiagnosis occurs. Finally, screening with a low diag‑
nostic threshold (for example, screening for diabetes with 
a low glucose cut‑off point) leads to more patients being 
diagnosed with the disease, many patients being over‑
diagnosed, more being harmed from treatment, and the 
fewest being harmed by untreated disease.
Going back to our case, RG has been diagnosed with 
pre‑diabetes, a relatively recently defined “disease.” Tra‑
ditionally, glucose cut‑off values defining diabetes were 
based on the risk of retinopathy.29 However, a desire to 
prevent other complications of diabetes led to the estab‑
lishment of various diabetes precursor conditions such 
as impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, 
and borderline HbA1C values, with cut‑off values defined 
on the basis of the risk of progression to frank diabetes.30 
The creation of these “at risk for diabetes” categories 
led to the creation of the umbrella term pre‑diabetes, 
which in effect broadened the population of patients 
diagnosed with diabetes in some form. However, the 
diagnostic tests used to identify pre‑diabetic conditions 
have variable accuracy for predicting diabetes and dif‑
ferent performance characteristics in different popula‑
tions.31 Reliance on the fiction of a “one size fits all” test 
with a low diagnostic threshold to diagnose pre‑diabetes 
(such as HbA1C of 5.7%) leads to more diagnoses of pre‑
diabetes with fewer of these people developing diabetes. 
Moreover, expanding the spectrum of diabetes to include 
pre‑diabetes promotes the false idea that untreated pre‑
diabetes will universally lead to diabetes. The notion of 
a “pre” disease condition is not limited to diabetes; it is 
failure to identify a disease that ultimately threatens a 
person’s health.13 Ideally, screening limits the underdiag‑
nosis of early disease that is destined to progress. When 
determining the effectiveness of screening, we evaluate 
the balance between clinical benefit (such as improved 
mortality) and clinical harm (such as complications from 
diagnostic tests and treatment) in a screened population. 
Going back to our case of pre‑diabetes, a few studies show 
that screening for diabetes leads to lower mortality and 
mixed evidence suggests that tighter control of type 2 dia‑
betes leads to a reduction in some macrovascular compli‑
cations.14 Although overdiagnosis of both diabetes and 
pre‑diabetes is a consequence of screening, guideline 
panels believe that harms related to overdiagnosis are

matic people contain incidental findings.35 Despite rec‑
ognition that most of these findings are of little clinical 
significance, their presence often triggers a cascade of 
unnecessary sequential diagnostic tests. On the rare occa‑
sion that an incidentally found abnormality appears to be 
clinically important, clinicians or patients may errone‑
ously conclude that more imaging saves lives.
Worry from incidental findings is heightened when 
the incidental finding represents a potentially fatal 
tumor, such as thyroid cancer. Since the introduction 
of neck ultrasound in the 1980s, thyroid imaging has 
become common and the incidence of thyroid cancer has 
increased globally, mainly as a result of a rise in small pap‑
illary carcinomas, with little change in mortality from thy‑
roid cancer. In this context, nearly half of thyroid cancers 
in men and more than 80% in women in high resource set‑
tings are estimated to represent overdiagnosis, amounting 
to more than 500 000 cases.36 The problem of incidental 
findings of unclear importance may be compounded by 
genetic testing, both in clinical and direct‑to‑consumer 
settings, the explosive growth of which may result in wide‑
spread overdiagnosis owing to the identification of gene 
carriers who may never develop disease.37
Public health screening programs
The use of screening programs as a disease prevention 
and control strategy is an important driver of overdiagno‑
sis. By design, screening programs presume that a reser‑
voir of undiagnosed disease exists and that screening will 
lead to a lower clinical impact of, or mortality from, that 
disease. However, a screening program will identify all 
disease along the spectrum of clinical severity and may 
tend to detect more indolent disease, with little to distin‑
guish between severe and indolent disease.38 Screening 
therefore always results in some degree of overdiagnosis. 
Screening for breast cancer provides an important exam‑
ple. Estimated rates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer with 
screening vary across countries and populations, but the 
presence of overdiagnosis is universally accepted.39 A UK 
panel estimated that 11% of screen detected breast can‑
cers represent overdiagnosis,40 and rates of overdiagnosis 
of breast cancer in Europe are estimated to range between 
1% and 10%.22 Within the US system there is more overdi‑
agnosis in higher income populations, which may reflect 
better access to care, particularly screening.41
Culture around medicine and health
In many countries there is great public enthusiasm for 
cancer screening and a relative lack of concern about 
the potential for overdiagnosis. In a study of the general 
US population, most adults believed that routine cancer 
screening is almost always a good idea, with 75% also 
believing that finding cancer early saves lives most or all 
of the time.42 A more recent survey assessed people’s tol‑
erance of overdiagnosis in the context of effective screen‑
ing. Although responses varied widely and there is no 
“correct” answer, participants tolerated a median of 113‑
150 cases of overdiagnosis per 1000 people screened to 
save one life.43 Notably, most survey respondents reported 
never having previously heard of overdiagnosis despite 
more than half having been screened for cancer.
also discussed for conditions such as osteopenia32 and 
for cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia.33 In the case of hypertension, the expan‑
sion of guideline definitions of hypertension to include 
lower systolic blood pressures has identified patients with 
a lower risk of poor cardiovascular outcomes who have 
“hypertension,” thereby subjecting them to treatment 
that is unlikely to benefit them.
Advanced technology
The increasing availability and use of advanced technol‑
ogy also contributes to overdiagnosis. For example, in the 
eight years after high resolution computed tomography 
pulmonary angiography became available to diagnose 
pulmonary embolism, the number of cases doubled 
compared with the previous five years.34 In the absence 
of overdiagnosis, an increase in the number of cases 
should have led to fewer deaths from untreated pulmo‑
nary embolism. However, mortality did not change over 
that time period; this implies that the additional cases 
of pulmonary embolism were clinically insignificant and 
overdiagnosed.34
Incidentalomas provide another example of the impact 
of the widespread use of advanced imaging. About 5‑15% 
of all abdominal imaging tests performed in asympto‑

Without screening, many patients with disease go undiagnosed and many experience harm from 
disease. Screening with a high diagnostic threshold results in more patients being diagnosed 
and fewer experiencing harms related to the disease, though more experience treatment related 
harms, and a small amount of overdiagnosis occurs. Screening with a low diagnostic threshold 
results in many more patients being diagnosed, among whom many are overdiagnosed, with 
little harm from disease but more harm related to treatment

lead a physician to pursue diagnostic testing aggressively 
because of a recent negative experience with a different 
patient in whom a diagnosis was missed. Many of these 
cognitive errors can lead physicians to overestimate the 
benefit of diagnosing and subsequently treating mild dis‑
ease, thus pushing them to practice in a way that fosters 
overdiagnosis.
Important limitations with the evidence related to 
diagnostic test accuracy and the effectiveness of treat‑
ments also enable overdiagnosis. With regard to diag‑
nostic testing, studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy 
often ignore the problem of disease spectrum, and high 
sensitivity tests may largely detect clinically insignificant 
disease,55 as seen with computed tomography pulmonary 
angiography, described above.28 Similar problems occur 
in studies evaluating the effects of treatments. Clinical 
trials generally report the average effect across a popula‑
tion; however, the average treatment effect applies poorly 
to individuals, with the benefit in a particular patient 
being related to disease severity.56 Valuing and applying 
the same intervention to people at lower risk of benefit 
to those at high risk may lead to treatment of overdiag‑
nosed disease and unnecessary exposure of patients to 
potential treatment toxicities. By contrast, targeting high 
risk patients for intervention can maximize net benefit 
in the population. For example, re‑analysis of data from 
the National Lung Screening Trial showed that using a 
risk of death from lung cancer based approach to screen‑
ing would prevent the greatest number of deaths among 
those at highest risk, with very few deaths among low risk 
patients who would not be screened.57
Magnitude of the problem
The magnitude of overdiagnosis is unclear. The limita‑
tion in our understanding is in part attributable to the 
challenges of studying overdiagnosis and in part due to 
relative lack of attention to the problem in many clinical 
areas, particularly outside of cancer. Our literature review 
yielded few reliable estimates of rates of overdiagnosis in 
non‑cancer clinical areas.
Overdiagnosis has been quantified for many cancers 
(table 2). The best evidence exists for prostate and breast 
cancers.2 In these two diseases, estimates of the propor‑
tion of disease that represents overdiagnosis vary widely 
across studies, reflecting both the challenges of quantify‑
ing overdiagnosis and the widely variable rates of overdi‑
agnosis based on patient characteristics. Between 2.9% 
and 88.1% of prostate cancers have been estimated to 
represent overdiagnosis.
The scope of overdiagnosis in diseases other than can‑
cer has not been well defined.61 Although screening for 
chronic non‑cancer conditions such as hypertension, 
diabetes, and depression comprises much of the routine 
work of primary care, there are few estimates of the mag‑
nitude of overdiagnosis of these disorders. In our litera‑
ture review, we found only a few studies that quantified 
overdiagnosis of non‑cancer conditions, namely chronic 
kidney disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). 
In kidney disease, authors simply reported rising rates of 
diagnosis and suggested that the rise probably reflected 
overdiagnosis without quantifying the proportion of 
System factors
Reimbursement structures may also drive overdiagno‑
sis. In fee for service healthcare systems direct financial 
incentives may encourage testing regardless of clinical 
appropriateness. In the US, the ownership of imaging 
equipment by physicians is associated with more testing 
with similar clinical outcomes, implying that financial 
incentives motivate clinical behavior towards exces‑
sive testing.26 Similarly, a lower share of public health 
expenditure (that is, more reliance on direct payments 
from individuals and private health insurance) has been 
found to be associated with a higher incidence of thyroid 
cancer across different healthcare systems, with no dif‑
ference in mortality from thyroid cancer,44 which again 
suggests profit driven testing.
Financial incentives can also operate through more 
complex mechanisms involving the drug and medical 
device industries, which may contribute to overdiagno‑
sis in several ways. Firstly, industry may seek to expand 
drug markets by working to broaden disease definitions 
to create more patients who are eligible for certain drugs 
through influencing guidelines (for example, guide‑
lines for lipid lowering), diagnostic criteria (such as in 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders (DSM)), and the content of medical education.45‑48 
In countries that allow direct‑to‑consumer advertising, 
drug advertising may obscure the line between disease 
and normal variants, driving patient requests for prescrip‑
tions. Furthermore, disease awareness campaigns may 
serve as proxies for efforts to increase patient requests 
for diagnostic testing for the disease in question and ulti‑
mately for drugs to treat it.49
Limitations in evidence application
Evidence based medicine, the application of the best 
medical research to the clinical care of individual 
patients, is understood to optimize medical decision mak‑
ing and improve patient outcomes.50 However, problems 
with physicians’ application of evidence and limitations 
in the evidence itself can contribute to overdiagnosis. 
Physicians have a poor understanding of quantitative 
information and test and treatment performance, which 
probably contributes to unnecessary testing and overdi‑
agnosis.51 52 Several studies have examined the role of 
cognitive biases and heuristics on medical decision mak‑
ing. Doctors’ susceptibility to decision making biases 
such as insensitivity to known probabilities, availability, 
and confirmation affects their ability to interpret infor‑
mation, including physical examination findings and 
diagnostic test results.53 54 Some cognitive errors may 
contribute to overdiagnosis. One example is the repre‑
sentativeness bias, in which an individual is assumed 
to belong to or to be representative of a category (such 
as a disease) on the basis of similarity to other charac‑
teristics in the category. In practice, representativeness 
bias may lead a physician to overestimate the benefit of 
an intervention in a patient with a lower risk of disease, 
expecting that patient to experience similar benefit to 
one with more severe disease who is at higher risk of 
complications. Similarly, availability bias, the tendency 
for recent experiences to affect decision making, might

adjust their life expectations and employment, owing 
to prognostic and functional considerations and mat‑
ters related to disease treatment.69 Some may experience 
depression and anxiety after a new diagnosis.70 71 For 
example, an international study of breast cancer survi‑
vors found an increased risk of suicide up to 25 years after 
diagnosis,70 and patients with ductal carcinoma in situ, 
which may represent overdiagnosed breast cancer, often 
experience persistent anxiety related to fear of recurrence 
and death.72 73 In the context of screening, psychological 
harms related to unexpected diagnoses of prostate cancer 
and AAA have been described, though evidence for most 
diseases is lacking.74 75
Labeling
Patients can be affected by being “labeled” with a dis‑
ease diagnosis in many adverse ways. In children, the 
diagnosis of a benign heart murmur can lead to unnec‑
essary restrictions on activity.76 77 In adults the impact 
of labeling is more difficult to ascertain. Interestingly, 
patients who undergo early imaging for mild acute low 
back pain, which is likely to reveal insignificant anatomic 
abnormalities, are more likely than non‑imaged patients 
to be out of work with disability one year later.78 This sug‑
gests that the knowledge of an identifiable abnormality 
may affect people’s perceptions about their own health 
and engagement in society.
Financial harms
The potential financial harms of overdiagnosis are enor‑
mous and contribute to waste in healthcare systems.79 
In the US, the cost of breast cancer overdiagnosis alone 
(both ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer) 
in women aged 40‑59 years has been estimated at $1.2bn 
(£0.91bn; €1.03bn) a year.80 As health systems around 
the world struggle to reduce unsustainably high costs,81 
the elimination of overdiagnosis is an attractive way to 
save money without compromising, and in fact improv‑
ing, public health.
Related terms
Clarity of terminology is crucial to efforts to enhance the 
understanding of overdiagnosis and minimize its impact. 
Table 3 describes terms that are related to overdiagnosis 
and that may be confused with true overdiagnosis.
In our literature review, we noted that several of these 
terms are often conflated with overdiagnosis. Many arti‑
cles using the term overdiagnosis were really describ‑
ing misdiagnosis, defined as the diagnosis of the wrong 
disease.85 For example, in one cross sectional study of 
overdiagnosis of heart failure diagnosed by primary care 
practitioners, researchers found that one in six people 
probably did not have heart failure, but had another 
disorder instead.88 Although it is tempting to use the 
term overdiagnosis to describe the mislabeling of these 
patients (because the term conjures the concept of an 
excess of a diagnosis), this example reflects an inaccu‑
rate diagnosis and not true overdiagnosis. For patients 
incorrectly labeled as having heart failure, their symp‑
toms (presumably breathlessness) were not caused by 
heart failure so the diagnosis was in fact a medical error.
actual overdiagnosis.62 The paper on AAA used evidence 
on the risk of rupture to estimate rates of overdiagnosis 
for screen detected AAAs of various sizes; the number of 
AAAs representing overdiagnosis ranged from 11.5% for 
>54 mm aneurysms to 87% for 26‑29 mm aneurysms.63
Consequences of overdiagnosis
Overdiagnosis has many consequences, some theoreti‑
cal and others more quantifiable. The effects are multi‑
pronged, affecting the individual, healthcare system, and 
society at large.
Overtreatment
Overtreatment refers to the unnecessary treatment of a 
condition. It occurs whenever overdiagnosed disease is 
treated and can affect the individual patient as well as the 
wider healthcare system. Overdiagnosed disease provides 
no opportunity for treatment benefit so the individual 
incurs only harms. These potential harms include direct 
negative consequences of the unnecessary treatment 
itself (such as a wound infection after thyroidectomy 
to treat an overdiagnosed thyroid cancer) and indirect 
harms related to the consequences of resultant down‑
stream services (such as palpitations resulting from an 
incorrect dose of replacement levothyroxine after thy‑
roidectomy). The individual patient is also affected by the 
opportunity costs related to treatment—for example, time 
away from usual activities while recovering from surgery.
The effects of overtreatment on the healthcare system 
and society are less obvious and challenging to measure. 
Given limited total capacity for healthcare delivery, over‑
treatment of one patient may limit healthcare access for 
another person who may truly need care, causing harm 
to people other than the overtreated patient, which on 
a broad scale amounts to societal harm.64 In addition, 
health system investment in overtreatment deflects 
resources from other pressing medical needs and repre‑
sents lost opportunity to improve the health of the pub‑
lic.65 66
Psychological harms
It is difficult to estimate psychological harm from over‑
diagnosed disease because the patient often does not 
know the “disease” represents overdiagnosis. Patients 
with recognized overdiagnosed thyroid cancer who opted 
against aggressive care have reported anxiety and feel‑
ings of isolation and secret keeping,67 though evidence in 
other clinical settings is limited. However, the psychologi‑
cal ramifications of disease diagnoses probably apply to 
overdiagnosis as well as to legitimate diagnoses.68 New 
diagnosis of a chronic disease may require patients to

ever, Sarafem, which was approved by the FDA in 2001, 
was simply rebranded fluoxetine, which, in the form of 
Prozac, went off patent during that same year.94 Although 
many women experience severe menstrual symptoms,95 
the relabeling of the experience as a disease is likely to 
have led to more widespread, and possibly unnecessary, 
drug treatment. Advertising is a powerful tool to facilitate 
disease mongering and foster overdiagnosis, as is shown 
in the case of Sarafem and others. In the US, direct‑to‑con‑
sumer advertising of testosterone replacement products 
was associated with testosterone testing and initiation of 
treatment with testosterone replacement therapy96; many 
of these cases probably represented overdiagnosis.
It is also important to distinguish misuse, or prevent‑
able complications of care, from overdiagnosis.82 Misuse 
may arise while treating an overdiagnosed disease, and 
some may argue that any treatment of such a disease is a 
case of misuse. However, given the difficulty in discerning 
overdiagnosis in a clinical scenario in real time, this is 
more of a theoretical concern. The growing emphasis on 
avoiding low value care is also relevant to the discussion 
of overdiagnosis. Low value care is defined as care that 
results in little benefit relative to its cost.86 87 Although 
care related to overdiagnosis is inherently low value, not 
all low value care is related to overdiagnosis.
Finally, medical overuse is a term used by some authors 
interchangeably with overdiagnosis. Overuse is the use of 
unnecessary health services, either tests or treatments, for 
which potential harms outweigh potential benefits.82 The 
association between overuse and overdiagnosis is com‑
plicated (see fig 3). Overuse is broader than overdiagnosis 
and can be both a cause and a driver of overdiagnosis.
Figure 3 describes testing and screening scenarios that 
may lead to overdiagnosis, the consequences of overdi‑
agnosis, and the association between overdiagnosis and 
the overuse of medical services (unnecessary testing and 
treatment). Both appropriate and inappropriate testing, 
as well as broadening of diagnostic thresholds, can lead 
to overdiagnosis, which in turn can lead to labeling and 
unnecessary testing and treatment.
Studying overdiagnosis
There are several approaches to quantifying overdiag‑
nosis; each has its own set of assumptions that lead to 
bias and limitations. These biases in part contribute to 
the wide ranges of rates of overdiagnosis among studied 
disease, as seen in table 2.
Table 4 describes approaches to quantifying overdi‑
agnosis. Several methods are used and, confusingly, the 
incidence of overdiagnosis can be expressed as a propor‑
tion of screen detected cases or as a proportion of all cases 
of disease.97 98 The excess incidence approach leverages 
long term follow‑up of groups that had been exposed or 
unexposed to a diagnostic test, generally a screening 
test for cancer. Patients’ exposure to testing can occur 
within a randomized trial or in real world settings. After 
a lengthy follow‑up time, the number of cancers in the 
screened group is compared with the number in the group 
that did not undergo screening; cancers in the control 
group would have been detected clinically or incidentally 
during other testing. After enough time, the number of 
Overdiagnosis and overmedicalization are also often con‑
flated. The confusion regarding these terms is natural for 
semantic reasons, and they have overlapping themes, con‑
cepts, and drivers.4 In overmedicalization, a phenomenon 
that is part of the normal human experience is recontexual‑
ized as disease and (often) treated as such. Overmedicaliza‑
tion shares many of the same consequences of overdiagnosis 
(such as labeling, overtreatment, and excessive cost). For 
example, advances in medical technology and changes 
in culture have led to overmedicalization of the process of 
dying. This has increased the use of more intensive proce‑
dures among those who are dying, with no benefit to indi‑
viduals, and has resulted in a rise in deaths in hospital.89
The term “disease mongering” is related to overmedicali‑
zation but it is used to describe situations in which outside 
forces, mainly the drugs industry, encourage overmedicali‑
zation for the purpose of creating new drug markets.90 91 
For example, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, first men‑
tioned in the DSM fourth edition in 1994,92 93 represents a 
severe form of premenstrual symptoms. A drug targeting 
premenstrual dysphoric disorder, Sarafem, was developed, 
approved by the Food and Drugs Administration, and heav‑
ily marketed to physicians and (in the US) consumers. How‑

mate of rates of overdiagnosis, though future growth in 
biomarkers to distinguish indolent from aggressive dis‑
ease may improve its accuracy.
Minimizing and managing overdiagnosis
Because overdiagnosis is an expected consequence of 
screening in asymptomatic people, some degree of over‑
diagnosis will persist. However, the ethical obligation to 
avoid patient harm compels physicians to minimize the 
prevalence of overdiagnosis,102 which can be done by 
improving the understanding of overdiagnosis, optimiz‑
ing disease definitions, and considering overdiagnosis 
when making clinical decisions. We discuss these three 
goals and strategies to achieve them.
Firstly, enhancing the evidence base related to overdi‑
agnosis would improve understanding. We need better 
estimates of rates of overdiagnosis of non‑cancer condi‑
tions for which there is widespread screening in primary 
care, including hypertension, mental health disorders, 
and hyperlipidemia. Although there are methodological 
concerns, even imprecise estimates of rates of overdiag‑
nosis of these common conditions would be helpful. In 
part the evidence could be advanced through required 
reporting of overdiagnosis in studies involving changes 
in diagnostic thresholds and in studies of new diagnostic 
tests or screening approaches.
Secondly, the medical community could minimize 
overdiagnosis by optimizing disease definitions. Because 
broadening of definitions of disease can lead to overdiag‑
nosis, any changes should use a systematic, transparent 
approach where benefits and harms are explicit, especially 
when they lead to an increase in the prevalence of disease, 
and broadening of definitions should require evidence of 
clinical benefit. International standards for defining dis‑
ease and altering disease definitions already incorporate 
these concepts; such standards could be institutional‑
ized by professional societies and guideline developing 
organizations.103 Primary care providers could minimize 
overdiagnosis by avoiding unnecessary screening and test‑
ing; a more consistent approach to defining disease would 
facilitate best clinical practice and benefit patients overall.
Thirdly, overdiagnosis must be better managed. Guide‑
lines related to screening examinations and changes to 
disease definitions must acknowledge the potential for 
overdiagnosis and attempt to quantify it. Discussion 
of possible overdiagnosis is already commonly recom‑
cancers in the control group will catch up with that in the 
screened group—the two groups should have the same 
number of clinically important cancers over time but early 
detection as a result of screening should be associated 
with better prognosis in the screened group. Extra can‑
cers in the screened group, the excess incidence, repre‑
sent overdiagnosed cancers that were never destined to 
become clinically important. For example, a Canadian 
study compared rates of breast cancer over time before 
and after the introduction of population based screen‑
ing.99 By assessing the increase in the total number of 
cancers after screening was introduced, the authors esti‑
mated that 5.4% of invasive breast cancers were overdiag‑
nosed. The excess incidence approach is considered the 
most reliable method for estimating overdiagnosis, but 
it is resource intensive and requires very long follow‑up.
A second approach to estimating rates of overdiag‑
nosis, the lead time approach, uses modeling based on 
estimates of expected rates of disease. Known treatment 
patterns, response rates, rates of disease progression, and 
likelihood of mortality from competing causes are used 
to estimate predicted disease survival times and over‑
all survival times with screening. In these models, the 
proportion of patients in the screened group predicted 
to die of their disease beyond their overall predicted life 
expectancy represents overdiagnosis. Investigators have 
used a lead time approach to estimate rates of overdiag‑
nosis associated with lung cancer screening. Simulating 
rates of lung cancer development, progression, detec‑
tion, follow‑up, treatment, and survival, investigators 
estimated that a mean of 11.9% (range 5.5‑23.2%) of 
screen detected cancers were overdiagnosed.100
The third and least accurate method for estimating 
rates of overdiagnosis relies on disease characteristics. 
This approach uses pathologic features of screen detected 
disease to predict future clinical behavior; disease that 
is predicted to never become clinically important (or to 
become important only after the patient is expected to die 
from other causes) defines overdiagnosis. For example, 
a study of prostate cancer reported an increase in small 
and very early stage tumors over time as screening rates 
rose; the proportion of these low risk tumors reflected 
the rate of overdiagnosis with screening.101 Although this 
method is informed by an understanding of the associa‑
tion between disease characteristics and prognosis, it 
involves many assumptions and offers only a rough esti‑

considered overdiagnosis
Over time, disease in the control group will be 
diagnosed clinically, so excess diagnoses in the

Uses models of the natural course of 
disease to compare survival time with 
testing or screening to what is expected in

similar across the population.65Figure 4 illustrates over‑
diagnosis in the context of benefits and harms of prostate 
cancer screening. 
Primary care clinicians can also minimize overdiag‑
nosis through thoughtful management approaches and 
referral practices. Conservative management of indolent 
disease that probably represents overdiagnosis can mini‑
mize harm from resultant overtreatment. Such strategies 
are recommended for early stage prostate and thyroid 
cancers,114 115 and they are increasingly discussed in 
the context of breast cancer.116 A recommendation for 
conservative management from the clinician has a big 
influence on the patient’s decision117 and is likely to be 
particularly potent in the context of an ongoing primary 
care relationship, empowering primary care clinicians to 
optimize patient care. Similarly, clinicians can selectively 
refer patients to specialists who are similarly committed 
to minimizing overdiagnosis, and these consultants also 
have substantial influence.118
Finally, greater clarity about the term overdiagnosis, 
with a broadly shared definition, would contribute to 
awareness of the problem and uniformity of approaches 
to curtail it. Lack of agreement regarding the term overdi‑
agnosis and its conflation with related phenomena such 
as overuse, overtreatment, and misdiagnosis reduces 
practitioners’ understanding of overdiagnosis and its 
implications in everyday clinical practice. The dissemi‑
nation of this definition will be key; it will require the 
cooperation of journal editors and would be enhanced 
by outreach in the lay press.
It is impossible to know whether the diagnosis of pre‑
diabetes in our case scenario will lead to clinical benefit 
or if it represents overdiagnosis. However, it is likely that 
neither the patient nor her doctor considered overdiag‑
nosis when the initial HbA1C test was sent. Better under‑
standing of overdiagnosis by physicians and how best to 
manage it, along with an appreciation of the phenom‑
enon by patients, will be important as we try to minimize 
both its prevalence and its harms in primary care.
mended in cancer screening guidelines104‑106 and has 
been alluded to outside of cancer; for example, in the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence hyper‑
tension guideline.107 Broader incorporation of concerns 
about overdiagnosis into guidelines would be facili‑
tated by the inclusion of such concerns into guideline 
development standards from organizations such as the 
Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International 
Network.60 108
Primary care clinicians are also responsible for improv‑
ing the management of overdiagnosis and can use several 
strategies. Firstly, clinicians must inform patients about 
overdiagnosis and incorporate it into clinical decision 
making. Currently, few patients who undergo cancer 
screening report discussing overdiagnosis with their 
physician, and it is likely that even fewer discuss over‑
diagnosis when they undergo screening for non‑cancer 
conditions such as diabetes.109 110 There are challenges to 
discussing overdiagnosis with patients; the concept may 
be difficult to understand and some may not recognize 
overdiagnosis as a real problem.111 112 Patients who do 
appreciate the potential for overdiagnosis may be reluc‑
tant to raise concerns with their doctors. Patient decision 
aids can facilitate these discussions and enhance patient 
knowledge and informed screening choices.113 They are 
particularly suited to decisions related to population 
based cancer screening, where benefits and harms are

HOW PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF THIS 
ARTICLE
To gain insight into overdiagnosis from the patient’s 
perspective, we solicited critical feedback from two 
members of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s 
Patient and Family Advisory Council for Quality. They noted 
the importance of mentioning that patients may be reluctant 
to challenge their doctors about diagnostic testing, and 
this concept was incorporated into the manuscript in the 
Minimizing and managing overdiagnosis section.
FUTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS
• How can new technologies be harnessed to identify 
biomarkers of cancers and conditions that are likely to 
represent overdiagnosis?
• At what step in the clinical decision making process 
should overdiagnosis be discussed and what are best 
communication practises?
• How should overdiagnosis best be explained to clinicians 
and patients to optimize understanding and minimize 
bias?
