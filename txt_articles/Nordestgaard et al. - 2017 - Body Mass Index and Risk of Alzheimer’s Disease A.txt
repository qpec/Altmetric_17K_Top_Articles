Context: Recently, data on 2,000,000 people established that low body mass index (BMI) is asso-
ciated with increased risk of dementia. Whether this observational association reflects a causal
effect remains to be clarified.
Objective: We tested the hypothesis that there is a causal association between low BMI and high risk
of Alzheimer’s disease.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 95,578
individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) with up to 36 years of follow-up
and consortia data on 303,958 individuals from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits
(GIANT) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP).
Main Outcome Measure: Risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
Results: The causal odds ratio for a 1-kg/m2 genetically determined lower BMI was 0.98 [95%
confidence interval (CI), 0.77 to 1.23] for a weighted allele score in the CGPS. Using 32 BMI-
decreasing variants from GIANT and IGAP the causal odds ratio for Alzheimer’s disease for a
1-standard deviation (SD) lower genetically determined BMI was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.22).
Corresponding observational hazard ratios from the CGPS were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.09) and
1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.46) for a 1-kg/m2 and a 1-SD lower BMI, respectively.
Conclusions: Genetic and hence lifelong low BMI is not associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s
disease in the general population. These data suggest that low BMI is not a causal risk factor for
Alzheimer’s disease and that the corresponding observational association likely is explained by
reverse causation or confounding. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 2310–2320, 2017)
U
nderstanding the association between body mass
index (BMI) and dementia is becoming a public
health priority due to increasing prevalence of dementia
and obesity worldwide (1–3). Both obesity and un-
derweight have been associated with increased risk of
dementia, and these discordant findings appear to be
dependent on the age at which obesity was recorded
(4–8). Recently, data on 2,000,000 people from the UK
Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) established
that low BMI is associated with increased risk of dementia
throughout the age range (9). Whether this observational
association reflects a causal effect remains to be clarified.
Despite the recent strong observational evidence be-
tween low BMI and increased risk of dementia (9), such

 data cannot overcome the problems of reverse causation
and confounding, and therefore do not have the ability to
establish causality (10). Dementia, or cognitive impair-
ment prior to establishment of the dementia diagnosis,
may lead to low BMI—so-called reverse causation. Al-
ternatively, the observational association may be due
to confounding, for instance if another factor simulta-
neously decreases BMI and causes dementia, leaving BMI
as a marker of this other causal factor.
Mendelian randomization is an epidemiological ap-
proach that aims to avoid reverse causation and con-
founding by using genetic variants in human populations.
Because genetic variants are determined at conception and
remain constant throughout life, Mendelian randomiza-
tion is not influenced by reverse causation; for instance,
dementia cannot change the genotype of an individual
(10). Furthermore, because random assortment of alleles
occurs during conception, genetic variants with effect
on a modifiable exposure, for example BMI, are ran-
domly distributed in relation to potential confounders. In
other words, genetic variants that are associated with low
BMI can be used as unconfounded proxies to study the
effect of lifelong low BMI on outcomes. Thus, if low BMI
truly is a causal factor in the development of dementia,
genetic variants that cause low BMI would be expected to
also cause high risk of dementia.
Using a Mendelian randomization design, we tested
the hypothesis that there is a causal association between
low BMI and high risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most
common form of dementia. First, we tested whether low
BMI at baseline was associated prospectively with high
risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Second, we tested whether
BMI-decreasing alleles of FTO rs9939609, MC4R
rs17782313, TMEM18 rs6548238, BDNF rs10767664,
and GNPDA2 rs10938397 were associated with low
BMI, as expected (11). Third, we tested whether BMI-
decreasing alleles were associated directly with high risk
of Alzheimer’s disease, and fourth, whether the effect of
BMI-decreasing alleles on risk of Alzheimer’s disease,
using instrumental variable analysis, was consistent with
the observational association between BMI and risk of
Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we tested these associations
in the BMI and Alzheimer disease consortia, the Genetic
Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) and the
International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP),
including a total of 399,536 individuals.
Materials and Methods
The study was approved by institutional review boards and
Danish ethical committees (H-KF-01-144/01) and was con-
ducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki with written
informed consent from participants. All participants were white
and of Danish descent.
Participants
The Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) is a
study of the general population initiated in 2003 with ongoing
enrollment (12–15). Participants were randomly selected from
the national Danish Civil Registration System to reflect the adult
general population aged 20 to 100+ years. Data collection
included a questionnaire, a physical examination, and blood
sampling for biochemical analyses and DNA extraction. We
included 95,578 participants in the present analyses, of whom
645 developed Alzheimer’s disease and 3,281 developed type 2
diabetes, the latter used as a positive control.
Disease endpoints
Information on diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease was col-
lected from the national Danish Patient Registry with data on all
patient contacts from all clinical hospital departments in
Denmark since 1977, including emergency wards and out-
patient clinics from 1995, and from the national Danish Causes
of Death Registry with data on causes of all deaths in Denmark,
as reported by hospitals and general practitioners since
1977. Alzheimer’s disease was World Health Organization
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ICD8 290 and
ICD10 F00 and G30. The validity of Alzheimer’s disease ICD
codes from the Danish registries is high (16), and was further
ensured by the presence of the well-known association with the
apolipoprotein E «4 allele in the present cohort (14). The
prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in the CGPS is in accordance
with the estimated prevalence from the National Dementia
Research Centre (17). Information on diagnoses of type 2
diabetes (World Health Organization; ICD-8 250; and ICD-
10, E11 E13 and E14) was collected similarly, and was used
as a positive control. Follow up began at the time of blood
sampling (observational analyses) or at the establishment of
the national Danish Patient Registry (January 1st, 1977) or on
the birthday of the participant, whichever came later (genetic
analyses). Follow up ended at occurrence of event, death,
emigration, or on November 10th 2014 (last update of reg-
istries), whichever came first. Median follow-up was 7 years
(range: 0 to 10 years) and 36 years (range: 0 to 37 years) in
observational and genetic analyses, respectively, and was
100% complete, that is, no individual was lost to follow-up.
Individuals with events before study entry were excluded from
the observational analyses.
Biochemical and genetic analyses
Standard hospital assays measured total cholesterol,
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
(Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald
equation (18) when plasma triglycerides were # 4 mmol/L (#
352 mg/dL), and otherwise measured directly (Konelab). An ABI
prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) and Taqman-based assays were used to genotype
for FTO rs9939609, MC4R rs17782313, TMEM18 rs6548238,
BDNF rs10767664, and GNPDA2 rs10938397 (11). We chose
these five genetic variants because they have the strongest
association with BMI in the general population out of a total of
32 variants (11). Combining all genotypes, we generated two
different genetic instruments for BMI. The first genetic in-
strument was calculated for each participant using a weighted
sum of BMI-decreasing alleles (19, 20), subsequently

 categorized into four groups of approximately equal size,
named weighted allele score group. The weights correspond to
the sum of the individual b-coefficients for the BMI-decreasing
alleles in each individual adjusted for age and sex (Supplemental
Table 1). The second genetic instrument was a simple counting
of the number of BMI-decreasing alleles in each individual,
subsequently categorized into four groups of approximately
equal size, named simple allele score group.
BMI and covariates
All covariates are from the day of enrollment in 2003 and
onwards. BMI was measured weight (kg) divided by measured
height squared (m2). Hypertension was use of antihypertensive
medication and/or a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or
greater, and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or
greater. Diabetes mellitus was self-reported disease, use of in-
sulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, and/or nonfasting plasma
glucose levels of . 11 mmol/L. Smoking was current smoking.
Alcohol consumption was .14/21 units per week for women/
men [1 unit = 12 g alcohol, equivalent to one glass of wine or
one beer (33 cL)]. Physical inactivity was #4 hours per week of
light physical activity in leisure time. Women reported meno-
pausal status and use of hormonal replacement therapy. Lipid-
lowering therapy was primarily statins (yes/no), and education
was , 8 years of education.
Consortia data
We downloaded summary estimates of genetic variants with
effect on BMI in up to 249,796 individuals (11) from the
GIANT consortium and obtained summary estimates on risk of
Alzheimer’s disease for the same BMI-decreasing variants in up
to 54,162 individuals from the IGAP consortium. The GIANT
consortium is an international collaboration that seeks to
identify genetic loci that modulate human body size and shape,
including height and measures of obesity. IGAP is a large two-
stage study based upon genome-wide association studies on
individuals of European ancestry. We used data from stage 1,
where IGAP has genotyped and imputed data on 7,055,881
single nucleotide polymorphisms to meta-analyze four pre-
viously published genome-wide association study datasets
consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer’s disease cases and 37,154
controls (the European Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative, the
Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium, the Cohorts for Heart
and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium,
and the Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer Disease
Consortium).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Stata/SE version 13.0 and 14.0
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX). P values ,0.001 are given
as powers of 10. Chi-square test evaluated Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium. For trend tests, subjects were coded by BMI in
quartiles or by weighted/simple allele score group as 1, 2, 3,
and 4 with first quartile, group 1, or 0 to 3 as reference
groups.
First, in observational analyses to examine the association
between BMI levels and risk of Alzheimer’s disease, we used
Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as
time-scale and delayed entry (left truncation) to estimate
hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). On
a continuous scale, the relationship between BMI and
Alzheimer’s disease was evaluated with the use of restricted
cubic splines. The number of five knots was chosen to balance
best fit and overfitting (21). Models were multifactorially
adjusted for age (as time scale), sex, hypertension, diabetes,
smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, postmenopausal
status and hormonal replacement therapy in women, lipid-
lowering therapy and educational level. Trend tests were
according to Cox regression trend test. Second, to assess
whether weighted/simple allele score group was associated
with BMI levels, we used linear regression. We used the hazard
ratio for a 1-kg/m2 decrease in BMI in the observational
analysis to calculate theoretically predicted risks of Alz-
heimer’s disease corresponding to the changes in BMI caused
by weighted/simple allele score group. Third, in genetic ana-
lyses, we examined the association between weighted/simple
allele score group and risk of Alzheimer’s disease using Cox
proportional hazards regression models with multifactorial
adjustment. In sensitivity analyses, we determined hazard
ratios for Alzheimer’s disease for the individual genetic vari-
ants. In further sensitivity analyses, we tested for interaction
between weighted/simple allele score group and covariates (as
described previously) on Alzheimer’s disease. Interaction be-
tween these covariates and weighted/simple allele score group
on risk of Alzheimer’s disease was evaluated by the inclusion of
two-factor interaction terms in the Cox regression model,
using a likelihood ratio test between models excluding and
including the interaction term.
A potential causal relationship between genetically low BMI
and risk of Alzheimer’s disease was assessed by instrumental
variable analysis (22) using “ivreg2” and “ivpois” in Stata.
Finally to improve statistical power, we examined the associ-
ation between genetically low BMI and risk of Alzheimer’s
disease in independent cohorts by including data from the
GIANT and IGAP consortia. We used the inverse-variance
weighted method (23) to calculate a causal odds ratio for
Alzheimer’s disease for a 1–standard deviation (SD) decrease
in BMI.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the 95,578 study participants
by Alzheimer’s disease status are shown in Table 1.
During up to 36 years of follow-up, we observed 645
Alzheimer’s disease events and 3956 deaths; 159 in-
dividuals died with Alzheimer’s disease. Median age was 76
(interquartile range = 70 to 80) and 58 (interquartile range =
48 to 67) years for those with and without Alzheimer’s
disease, respectively, reflecting that Alzheimer’s disease is a
disease of the elderly.
BMI and risk of Alzheimer’s disease:
observational estimate
Risk of Alzheimer’s disease increased stepwise as a
function of decreasing BMI in quartiles (P for trend = 5 3
1027; Fig. 1). For individuals in the fourth (lowest BMI)
vs the first quartile (highest BMI), the hazard ratio was
1.89 (95% CI, 1.46 to 2.43) for Alzheimer’s disease.

 for individuals in group 4 vs 1 or group 6 to 10 vs 0 to 3
(Fig. 2, left panel).
Genotype and risk of Alzheimer’s disease
The 2.8% decreases in BMI in weighted allele score
group 4 vs 1 and in individuals with simple allele score
group 6 to 10 vs 0 to 3 theoretically predicted increased
hazard ratios of 1.05 for Alzheimer’s disease (Fig. 2,
upper middle panel). However, neither the weighted al-
lele score nor the simple allele score group was associated
with risk of Alzheimer’s disease (P for trend = 0.37 and
0.52; Fig. 2, upper right panel). In sensitivity analyses,
the
lack
of
association
with
Alzheimer’s
disease
remained across individual genetic variants and strata of
Alzheimer’s disease risk factors (Supplemental Figs. 3–5).
BMI is causally associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
Therefore, to test our method using a positive control, we
examined the association between weighted/simple allele
score group and risk of type 2 diabetes. The 2.8% lower
BMI in weighted allele score group 4 vs 1 and in simple
allele score group 6 to 10 vs 0 to 3, theoretically predicted
hazard ratios of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90 to 0.92) for type 2
diabetes (Fig. 2, lower panel). The corresponding ob-
served hazard ratios for type 2 diabetes were 0.84 (95%
CI, 0.76 to 0.92) for both weighted and simple allele score
group, indicating a causal relationship (P for trend = 6 3
1025 and 3 3 1024).
Genotype and potential confounding factors
We tested whether potential confounding factors were
associated with observational BMI, Alzheimer’s disease,
and weighted/simple allele score group. Age, sex, hy-
pertension, physical activity, education, and menopause
were all strongly associated with BMI and risk of
Alzheimer’s disease and thus constitute potential
confounders for the observational BMI–Alzheimer’s
Figure 2. BMI (left) and corresponding theoretically predicted (middle) and observed (right) hazard ratios for Alzheimer’s disease as a function
of BMI weighted allele score/simple allele score group. Theoretically predicted hazard ratios were calculated from delta BMI and the known
association of BMI with risk of Alzheimer’s disease in the observational study (see Fig. 1). Observed hazard ratios were multifactorially adjusted
for age (as time scale), sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, postmenopausal status and hormonal replacement
therapy in women, lipid-lowering therapy, and educational level. As a positive control, estimates were also presented for type 2 diabetes (lower
part of Fig. 2; multifactorial adjustment omitted diabetes as a covariate). BMI values are mean (6standard error of the mean). P values are test
for trend.

 disease association. In contrast, weighted/simple allele
score group was not associated with any of these po-
tential confounders, except for hypertension (Fig. 3, two
right panels).
BMI and Alzheimer’s disease: causal estimates
We examined the potential causal effect of low BMI on
risk of Alzheimer’s disease in instrumental variable an-
alyses (Fig. 4). Causal odds ratios for a 1-kg/m2 geneti-
cally determined lower BMI were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.77 to
1.23) for weighted allele score group and 1.01 (95% CI,
0.83 to 1.22) for simple allele score group (Fig. 4). The
corresponding observational multifactorially adjusted
hazard ratio for Alzheimer’s disease for a 1-kg/m2 lower
BMI was 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.09). The statistical
strength of the weighted allele score was an F value of
140. To test our method using a positive control, we also
examined the causal effect of low BMI on risk of type 2
diabetes in instrumental variable analyses. Causal odds
ratios for a 1-kg/m2 genetically determined lower BMI
were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.98) for weighted allele score
group and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.99) for simple allele
score group (Fig. 4, lower panel). The corresponding
observational multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio
for type 2 diabetes for a 1-kg/m2 lower BMI was 0.88
(95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89), indicating a causal relationship
as expected.
Finally, when using data from 32 BMI-decreasing
genetic variants from the GIANT and IGAP consortia
(Supplemental Table 2), the estimated causal odds ratio
for Alzheimer’s disease for a 1-SD lower genetically de-
termined BMI was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.22). The
corresponding observational multifactorially adjusted
hazard ratio for Alzheimer’s disease for a 1-SD lower
BMI was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.46; Fig. 5, upper panel).
Further, we plotted the change in Alzheimer’s disease risk
as a function of change in BMI per allele for each of the 32
genetic variants and graphically illustrated the overall
causal estimate (Fig. 5, lower panel).
Discussion
The principal finding of this study is that lifelong low BMI
due to genetic variation in BMI-related genes is not as-
sociated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, in
contrast to the observational association. We generated
these results by combining large scale prospective data
from a homogenous general population study with the
current most powerful genetic data on BMI and Alzheimer’s
disease obtained from international consortia. The discor-
dance between the observational and genetic estimates
suggests that low BMI per se is not a causal risk factor for
Alzheimer’s disease, and that the observational association
may be due to reverse causation or confounding.
The existing literature concerning BMI and Alz-
heimer’s disease is conflicting. Previous studies and a
recent meta-analysis concluded that midlife obesity in-
creases dementia risk (4–6, 24), whereas obesity at older
ages is associated with lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease
(4, 25). Recently, large-scale population evidence from
Figure 3. Association of potential confounders with BMI, Alzheimer’s disease, and BMI weighted allele score/simple allele score group. Potential
confounders were dichotomized: age ($70 vs ,70); sex (male vs female), hypertension (hypertension vs no hypertension), physical activity (high
vs low physical activity), education (short, ,8 years, vs long education), and menopausal status (postmenopausal vs premenopausal). Potential
confounders were defined as described in the Table 1 footnote. For each potential confounder, logistic regression analysis was used to calculate
sex- and age-adjusted odds ratios and P values for, respectively, a 1-kg/m2 lower observational BMI, Alzheimer’s disease vs no event, and
a 1-kg/m2 genetically lower BMI for weighted/simple allele score group.

 the UK CPRD study reported that low BMI in all age
groups was associated with high risk of Alzheimer’s
disease (9). These conflicting results reflect well-known
problems in observational epidemiology, where associa-
tions are prone to confounding and reverse causation—the
latter of special concern when estimating effects of BMI
and Alzheimer’s disease. It is well-known that early pro-
dromal phases of dementia cause loss of initiative and
apathy and changes in eating behavior, appetite, olfactory
function, and food choice, all leading to a reduced caloric
intake and thereby weight loss (8, 26). Therefore, reverse
causation may be a likely explanation for the observed
association between low BMI and high risk of dementia in
the current study as well as in the UK CPRD study (9). To
overcome the inherent limitations of observational epi-
demiology,
we
used
the
Mendelian
randomization
approach, a design that uses genetic variants that are as-
sociated with low BMI as instruments to examine the effect
of lifelong low BMI on risk of Alzheimer’s disease. We
found that observational low BMI was associated with
high risk of Alzheimer’s disease, but with no genetic evi-
dence to support corresponding causal relationships. The
present negative findings are in line with genome-wide
association studies and meta-analyses, which did not de-
tect any associations between BMI related genes and
Alzheimer’s disease (27–29) and in line with two recent
case-control studies also using consortia data that found
no causal association between BMI and risk of Alzheimer’s
disease (30, 31).
Several biological explanations for the observational
association between BMI and Alzheimer’s disease have
been suggested. Concerning midlife obesity and Alzheimer’s
disease, a plausible link could be obesity-related vascular
disease such as hypertension and stroke, as well as al-
terations in brain structure, white matter changes, and
blood–brain barrier disturbances (32–34). Furthermore,
adipokines—defined as hormones, cytokines, and peptides
secreted by adipose tissue—have been suggested to have

 suggested to be involved in synaptic plasticity, amyloid-b
processing, and neuroprotection (35). Because we and
others (30, 31) now suggest that BMI is not causally
associated
with
dementia,
the
proposed
biological
mechanisms for midlife obesity and Alzheimer’s disease
are, however, most likely not of a causal nature.
Our study has limitations and strengths that need to be
addressed. Although the present analyses do not provide
genetic evidence supporting a causal
relationship between BMI and Alz-
heimer’s disease, it is not possible based
on the present data to entirely negate
the hypothesis. The reason for this is
that the associations of the genetic
variants with BMI are relatively small,
and therefore, large numbers of cases
and controls are required to reliably
preclude any causal relation. However,
when comparing the causal genetic es-
timate from powerful consortia data
with the present high-quality observa-
tional estimate adjusted for a range
of important confounders, the CIs are
hardly overlapping, supporting the
hypothesis that BMI is not causally
associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
Taken together, the present pro-
spective study and the recent case-
control studies (30, 31) provide the
first line of evidence arguing against a
causal relation between BMI and risk
of Alzheimer’s disease. A limitation
could be the observation that geneti-
cally low BMI is associated with low
risk of hypertension. This is expected,
as a causal relationship exists be-
tween high BMI and hypertension (36).
However, because genetically low BMI
is associated with low risk of hyper-
tension, and because low risk of hy-
pertension is associated with low risk
of Alzheimer’s disease, these associa-
tions cannot explain the present ob-
servational relation between low BMI
and high risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
Finally,
our
study
has
several
strengths, of which the most impor-
tant are that our findings are based
on a large homogenous population,
that we control for a number of im-
portant confounders, and that we
have included as a positive control
the well-known causal association
between genetically low BMI and low risk of type
2 diabetes.
In conclusion, combining common genetic variation in
five key BMI genes into strong genetic instruments and
supplementing these analyses with data on Alzheimer’s
disease risk of 32 BMI variants from international con-
sortia, we found that genetic and hence lifelong low BMI
is not associated with high risk of Alzheimer’s disease in
Figure 5. Risk of Alzheimer’s disease for a 1-SD lower observational and causal genetically
determined BMI. The hazard ratio for a 1-SD lower observational BMI was calculated using
Cox regression, whereas the odds ratio for genetically low BMI was derived from the inverse-
variance weighted method (upper panel). Estimated effects on Alzheimer’s disease risk are
plotted against estimated effects on BMI (percent of 1 SD on the log scale) for 32 genetic
variants (lower panel). Vertical gray lines show 95% CIs for each individual genetic variant.
We graphically illustrated the overall causal estimate shown as a red solid line with 95% CIs
as red dashed lines (lower panel). The regression coefficient of –0.021 represents the overall
causal estimate. P value: significance of hazard ratio or odds ratio.

 the general population. These data suggest that low BMI
is not a causal risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and that
the corresponding observational association most likely
is explained by reverse causation or confounding.
