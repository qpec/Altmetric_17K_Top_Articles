PURPOSE. Sarcoidosis frequently is complicated by small nerve fiber loss (SNFL), which can be
quantified using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). Prior studies suggest that the innate
repair receptor agonist cibinetide reverses corneal nerve loss. This phase 2b, 28-day,
randomized trial of 64 subjects with sarcoid-associated SNFL and neuropathic pain assessed
the effect of cibinetide on corneal nerve fiber area (CNFA) and regenerating intraepidermal
fibers (GAP-43þ) as surrogate endpoints for disease modification, pain severity, and functional
capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]).
METHODS. Cibinetide (1, 4, or 8 mg/day) was compared to placebo. The primary study
endpoint was a change in CNFA at 28 days.
RESULTS. The placebo-corrected mean change from baseline CNFA (lm2) at day 28 was 109
(95% confidence interval [CI], �429, 647), 697 (159, 1236; P ¼ 0.012), and 431 (�130, 992)
in the 1, 4, and 8 mg groups, respectively. Intraepidermal GAP-43þ fibers increased in the 4
mg group (P ¼ 0.035). Further, changes in CNFA correlated with changes in GAP-43þ (q ¼
0.575; P ¼ 0.025) and 6MWT (q ¼ 0.645; P ¼ 0.009). Pain improved significantly in all
groups, with subjects having moderate-severe pain reporting a clinically meaningful placebo-
corrected decrease in pain intensity in the 4 mg group (P ¼ 0.157).
CONCLUSIONS. Cibinetide significantly increased small nerve fiber abundance in the cornea and
skin, consistent with a disease modifying effect. The relationships between CNFA and other
clinical measures of disease support its use as a surrogate endpoint to assess potential disease
modifying therapies for neuropathy.

S
mall, unmyelinated C and thinly myelinated Ad nerve fibers
mediate autonomic function, nociception, and thermal
sensitivity. These nerve fibers are either selectively reduced
or predate large fiber involvement in many diseases,1 often
resulting in significant, disabling neuropathic symptoms,
especially pain. A common etiology underlying small nerve
fiber loss (SNFL) may be chronic inflammation.2 Sarcoidosis is
an orphan disease of immune dysregulation and sustained
inflammation characterized by pulmonary, skin, joint, nervous
system, and eye involvement.3 Although sarcoidosis often
resolves spontaneously, many patients have persistent disease,
and the majority of these suffer a painful neuropathy associated
with SNFL.4 Currently, to our knowledge there are no approved
therapies to treat the underlying pathophysiology of SNFL and
its symptoms remain poorly managed with analgesic, anticon-
vulsant, or antidepressant therapies.1
Inflammation occurs via a cascade of self-amplifying
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which drive
progressive tissue damage. Recently, a counter-regulatory
mechanism, that limits damage while simultaneously activating
tissue repair has been identified. This system is activated by the
innate repair receptor (IRR) comprised of b common (CD131)
and erythropoietin receptor subunits, which signals via janus
kinase-2 and multiple downstream intracellular molecular
pathways.5 IRR activation promotes tissue protection and
repair in a wide variety of preclinical models,5 including
neuropathy.6–8
Cibinetide (ARA 290; helix B surface peptide) is a novel 11
amino acid peptide with high affinity and selectivity for the
IRR.9 Despite a short plasma half-life, cibinetide triggers
sustained biological effects when concentrations exceed the
low nanomolar affinity of the receptor.5 Notably, in a mouse
model of diabetic SNFL, daily administration of cibinetide
reversed neuronal dystrophy.7 In neuropathic states the
transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ion channel, a
key integrator of nociception and neurogenic inflammation,

 undergoes upregulation and sensitization in peripheral small
nerve fibers and central pain pathways. Recent data demon-
strate that cibinetide antagonizes the TRPV1 channel of small
nerve fibers and relieves mechanical hypersensitivity.10
Three prior clinical studies have shown that cibinetide
reduces neuropathic symptoms11 and may promote nerve fiber
repair12,13 in patients with sarcoidosis or diabetes-related SNFL.
Nerve fiber regeneration in two studies was evaluated using
corneal confocal microscopy (CCM), an in vivo ophthalmic
imaging modality that noninvasively visualizes nerve fibers
within the cornea, including the small fibers of the sub-basal
layer. CCM-assessed sub-basal corneal nerve status correlates
with sensory nerve function and lower extremity intraepider-
mal nerve fiber density (IENFD).14
The present phase 2b clinical trial evaluated safety, efficacy,
and dose range of 28-day subcutaneous (SC) administration of
cibinetide on corneal nerve fiber area (CNFA) compared to
placebo in subjects with sarcoidosis and painful SNFL.
Secondary goals were to evaluate the effect of cibinetide on
other objective cutaneous markers of SNFL, including intra-
epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD), growth-associated
protein-43 (GAP-43) positive nerve fiber length, neuropathic
symptoms, and functional (6-minute walk test [6MWT])
endpoints. Additionally, potential relationships between CNFA
and clinical endpoints were explored to provide information
concerning the suitability of CNFA as a surrogate endpoint for
SNFL.
METHODS
Study Design
The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
two-center assessment of the effects of daily SC administration
of 3 doses of cibinetide or placebo for 28 days in sarcoidosis
subjects with painful SNFL. The trial was registered (EudraCT
[2013-003016-45]; Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02039687]) and con-
ducted in compliance with all regulatory requirements,
including the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Following
approval of the Ethics Committees of Leiden University
Medical Center and The Cleveland Clinic, all subjects provided
informed consent. The trial commenced on January 24, 2014
and was completed on February 3, 2015.
After a �28-day screening period, the subjects were
randomized (1:1:1:1) to 4 treatment groups: 1, 4, or 8 mg
cibinetide or placebo daily from a block randomization scheme
generated by a unit independent from the study sites. On the
basis of preclinical and human pharmacokinetic/pharmacody-
namic data, 1 mg was expected to be an ineffective dose.
Additionally, the 8 mg dose was expected to be similar to 4 mg,
as preclinical neuropathy data suggest that higher doses of
cibinetide do not further decrease pain behaviors if a threshold
dose is exceeded.6 The first subcutaneous administration of
study drug occurred at the research site and thereafter it was
self-administered daily for an additional 27 days. Subjects
returned at weeks 2 and 4 for protocol-specified testing and
safety assessment. Vials were returned to the pharmacy to
determine study drug compliance.
Study Population
Subjects were eligible for study participation if they were
between 18 and 70 years of age with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis
using established criteria15 and SNFL based on: (1) a score of
‡4 on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ‘‘pain now’’ or ‘‘average pain’’
questions and (2) distal leg pain characterized by at least one of
the following: dysesthesia, burning/painful feet worsening at
night, or intolerance of sheets/clothes touching the legs or
feet. Additionally, subjects were required to meet either of the
following two screening criteria: CNFA or IENFD from a distal
leg biopsy obtained within the prior 2 years greater than 2 SD
below the mean of a normative population.16,17 Exclusion
criteria included body mass index ‡40, pregnant or breastfeed-
ing females, a history of a serious malignancy, or use of
biological anti-inflammatory agents or erythropoietin within 3
months before enrollment. Other medical conditions known to
be associated with SNFL (except for diabetes in good control)
were grounds for exclusion. An ophthalmologic history was
obtained to identify corneal pathology that could potentially
confound CCM-derived data. Patients carrying a formal
diagnosis of dry eye (n ¼ 2) were not excluded from the
study, since loss of corneal nerve fibers is itself associated with
dry eye18 and patients with sarcoidosis-associated SNFL
frequently complain of dry eye.19 As the use of contact lenses
has not been associated with a reduction in corneal nerve
fibers as assessed by CCM,20,21 this was not a cause for study
exclusion.
Outcome Measures
The primary study endpoint was a change in corneal nerve
fiber abundance at day 28 as determined by CCM. It currently
is uncertain which single CCM parameter might best charac-
terize change in corneal nerve fibers and, therefore, serve as a
surrogate endpoint for disease modification. Quantification of
CCM-derived corneal nerve morphology within the sub-basal
plexus can be characterized using a variety of features,
including fiber density, length, width (reflecting the variable
number of C-fibers within each bundle), branching, tortuosity,
and beading frequency. The area of the corneal nerve net, that
is, the extent of the cornea surface area covered by sub-basal
nerve fibers (CNFA), reflects a combination of these variables.
Because corneal nerve fiber density is expressed as integer
values normalized per unit area, and is characterized by a
discrete distribution with relatively few numerical possibilities,
it is relatively insensitive to small changes in the nerve fiber
net. In contrast, corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and CNFA
are calculated from a large number of pixels overlying the
nerves, which approximates a continuous distribution and is
more sensitive to changes within the nerve net. Although CNFL
has been suggested to be an optimal single parameter for
assessment of small nerve fiber damage,22 it is a one-
dimensional measure. Nerve fiber regeneration arises not only
from elongation, but also branching, and widening of existing
corneal nerve fibers, that is, it is a two-dimensional process,
which will be better detected by quantification of CNFA.
Notably, in a comparison of CCM variables obtained from a
group of healthy subjects and patients with a wide range of
neuropathic severity due to diabetes, CNFA most closely
paralleled CNFL (r ¼0.93; P < 0.0001; n ¼ 101; Supplementary
Figs. S1, S2).
Corneal nerves were imaged as described previously,13
using the Rostock Corneal Module of the Heidelberg Retinal
Tomograph III (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany)
by one of three experienced investigators. Six to eight images
of sub-basal corneal nerves of each eye were selected on the
basis of image quality by a single analyst blinded to treatment
(MB).23 CNFA was quantified using a custom-developed macro
for FIJI (https://imagej.net/Fiji/downloads), a public-domain
image analysis program, version 1.47e. Corneal nerve fiber
density (CNFD), corneal nerve fiber branch density (CNBD),
and CNFL were calculated in a post hoc assessment using the
automated program ACCmetrics (See Supplementary Materials
for details). Analysis of the image data set from the present
study confirmed the hypothesis that CNFA was a sensitive

 assessment of longitudinal change of the corneal nerve fiber
net and, therefore, appears to be a reasonable surrogate
endpoint for disease modification in small fiber neuropathy
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
Standard dermatologic skin biopsies of 3 mm diameter were
obtained 10 cm above the lateral malleolus at baseline and on
day 28 for IENFD quantification according to international
guidelines.24 Four randomly selected sections were stained in a
free-floating protocol with anti-protein gene product 9.5, a
pan-axonal marker. The sections were analyzed in a blinded
fashion by an expert (MJ). GAP-43 is a specific marker for new
or recently regenerated nerve fibers.25 Changes in intraepider-
mal GAP-43 positivity were assessed using 50-lm thick sections
adjacent to those used to determine IENFD. These were
immunostained for GAP-43 and Z-stacked images (Axiovision
4.8.1; Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Jena, Germany) were used to
manually trace the extent of nerve fibers visualized within the
epidermis using a novel measurement introduced by one of the
authors (MJ). Total length was normalized per mm and mm2 to
provide data with units that could be compared to IENFD (per
mm) or CNFA (per mm2), respectively.
Additional endpoints, obtained at baseline and day 28, were
the 6MWT, performed according to American Thoracic Society
guidelines,26 and self-administered questionnaires (RAND 36-
item health survey [RAND-36], Small Fiber Neuropathy
Screening List [SFNSL],19 BPI, Fatigue Assessment Scale
[FAS],27 and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory [NPSI]28).
Safety endpoints, including serious adverse events (SAEs), also
were obtained.
Statistical Analysis
The safety population (intent-to-treat [ITT]) included all
subjects who received ‡1 dose of study drug. The modified
ITT (MITT) population consisted of all randomized subjects
who received ‡1 dose of study drug and had a baseline and at
least one postbaseline assessment of CNFA. As per the
prespecified Statistical Analysis Plan, the primary efficacy
endpoint was CNFA at day 28 compared to baseline.
Between-group significance was estimated using a Mixed
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis of CNFA change
from baseline at endpoint, which included treatment, visit, and
treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects, the baseline
density as a covariate, and study site as a random effect using
the Kenward-Roger degree of freedom estimate and including
data from all 4 treatment groups. Within-group significance
was analyzed using a paired t-test at the P ¼ 0.05 (2-sided)
significance level.
IENFD, 6MWT, BPI, RAND-36, SFNSL, FAS, and NPSI change
from baseline at day 28 were analyzed using a paired t-test
analysis. Between-group differences for IENFD were deter-
mined using MMRM as for CNFA, and for 6MWT, GAP-43, and
BPI pain intensity by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the
treatment and baseline value as factors. For correlation
analyses Pearson or Spearman Rank Order tests were
performed depending upon whether the data were normally
distributed.
Based on previous studies,11,13 a sample size of 16 for each
group was estimated to provide 90% statistical power to detect
a change of 8.0 points from baseline to day 28 in the secondary
endpoint of SFNSL at the 2-sided 0.05 level.
RESULTS
The disposition of the study subjects is shown in Figure 1.
Although 64 subjects were randomized, treatment assignment
could not be confirmed for two subjects in the 8 mg treatment
group due to pharmacy error. One patient withdrew voluntar-
ily from the 4 mg group. Baseline characteristics of the MITT
groups are summarized in Table 1. Subjects in the groups were
similar in age, CNFA, severity of SNFL, pain and other symptom
scores, and functional capacity. The mean age of the study
population was 50.8 years. The median time since diagnosis of
sarcoidosis was 8 years (interquartile range [IR], 5.8–12), while
the median duration of presumptive SNFL was 6 years (IR, 3-
8.3). Five patients had well-controlled diabetes (2 in the
placebo, 2 in the 1 mg, and 1 in the 4 mg groups).
Following 28 days of dosing, subjects in the 1 mg and
placebo groups exhibited a mean decrease in CNFA (lm2) from
baseline of �64.3 (P ¼ 0.748) and �170.0 (P ¼ 0.32),
respectively. In contrast, CNFA in the 4 and 8 mg groups
increased by 533.8 (P ¼ 0.084) and 203.8 (P ¼ 0.274),
respectively. For the primary efficacy endpoint, MMRM analysis
for treatment group differences demonstrated a significant
increase in CNFA compared to placebo for the 4 mg group
(697.4 lm2; P ¼ 0.012; Table 2).
Following discontinuation of drug administration, CNFA
trended back toward baseline. A sensitivity analysis performed
by excluding the few diabetic patients in this study did not
change the observed outcome for CNFA as an endpoint (data
not shown). Assessment of the change in the corneal nerve
fiber net using ACCmetrics-derived variables showed similar
treatment group response patterns (see Supplementary Mate-
rial).
A representative CCM image for a study subject (Figs. 2A–C)
demonstrated decreased CNFA at baseline typical of sarcoido-
sis-associated SNFL compared to a healthy control, with clear
improvement noted following 28 days of cibinetide adminis-
tration.
In contrast to the significant increase in CNFA observed
after 4 mg cibinetide dosing, no treatment group differences
were observed for IENFD changes as determined by MMRM,
with the 1, 4, and 8 mg groups exhibiting least squares (LS)
mean changes of 0.45 6 0.62 (SEM), 0.43 6 0.64, and �0.55 6
0.63 nerve fibers/mm, compared to 0.75 6 0.60 in the placebo
group. However, the cibinetide 4 mg group showed a
significant increase in the LS mean GAP-43þ fiber length of
1730.8 6 658 lm/mm2 (corresponding to ~23% increase from
baseline) compared to a decrease of �333.5 6 645 lm/mm2
for the placebo group (P ¼ 0.035). Additionally, the 1 and 8 mg
groups had LS mean values of 1181.1 6 638 and �344.4 6 713
lm/mm2, respectively. As an example, Figures 2D and 2E
illustrate representative change in GAP-43þ fibers following 4
mg of cibinetide. Changes in CNFA and skin biopsy intraepi-
dermal GAP-43þ fiber length were significantly correlated
(Spearman q ¼ 0.5750; P ¼ 0.025; Fig. 3A), suggesting that the
effects of cibinetide were consistent across two anatomic sites
and small nerve fiber assessment methodologies.
When expressed as length of GAP-43þ fibers per mm of
epidermis, the 4 mg dose group was increased 44% above
baseline and was significant (P ¼ 0.03) when compared to
placebo (181.7 6 48.2 vs. 29.9 6 48.6 lm/mm). Change in
fiber length in the 1 and 8 mg dose groups was intermediate at
88.8 6 48.2 and 73.8 6 53.8 lm/mm, respectively. When
normalized for the number of nerve fibers, the change in GAP-
43þ fiber length in the 4 mg group was a mean of 49.5 lm/fiber
over 28 days, or approximately 1.8 lm/fiber/day.
The baseline mean 6MWT distance for all subjects at
baseline was reduced (Table 1) compared to predicted
normative values.29 Additionally, baseline 6MWT distance was
inversely related to the level of self-reported pain interference
(r¼�0.384; P¼0.002) as determined by the BPI. At day 28, the
cibinetide 1, 4, and 8 mg groups exhibited an increase in the
total distance walked by 19.3, 17.7, and 18.2 m, compared to
1.2 m in the placebo group (P ¼ 0.11 for the 4 mg vs. placebo

 groups). Further, there was a significant correlation between
the change in CNFA and change in the 6MWT for the cibinetide
4 mg group (Spearman q ¼ 0.645; P ¼ 0.009; Fig. 3B) which
was not observed in the placebo group.
At baseline, subjects reported similar symptom scores
(moderate pain) as measured by self-administered question-
naire instruments (Table 1). Patient self-reported outcomes
exhibited strong placebo effects following dosing, with
significant increases from baseline noted for all treatment
groups for the SFNSL, BPI, and NPSI (Table 3). The RAND-36
Item Health Survey showed significant increases from baseline
at day 28 for the cibinetide 1 mg group in health change; in the
cibinetide 4 mg group for physical functioning, social
functioning, pain, and health change; and in the placebo
group for emotional well-being and pain (data not shown). No
group exhibited a significant change from baseline in the FAS.
For subjects with moderate-to-severe pain (baseline BPI score
‡ 5, n ¼ 44) the largest placebo-corrected treatment effect in
pain reduction was seen in the cibinetide 4 mg group (LS mean
difference, �1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], �2.42, 0.41; P
¼ 0.157; Table 3).
The occurrence of adverse events is summarized in Table 4.
No relationship to cibinetide dosing was evident, with the
lowest incidence across all four treatment groups occurring in
the 4 mg group. The most frequent adverse events were
injection site pain, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, and nausea.
Serious adverse events occurred in 2 subjects in the 1 mg
group (syncope, headache, enteritis), considered unrelated to
the study drug with no change in study drug administration,
and one subject in the 8 mg group (suicidal ideation),
considered possibly related.
DISCUSSION
The study results show a significant, placebo-corrected
increase in CNFA after 28 days of cibinetide administration,
which corroborates a similar increase observed in a prior phase
2a trial13 and provides clinical validation of preclinical data
demonstrating neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of
cibinetide.5 Although parallel assessments of lower limb distal
IENFD did not show a similar change, quantification of new
nerve fiber growth within the epidermis using GAP-43
immunostaining also supported a cibinetide-related increase
in small nerve fiber regeneration. This observation is strength-
ened further by the significant positive correlation noted
between changes in CNFA and GAP-43þ fiber length. As
expected, the 1 mg dose does not appear to be effective.
Although the 8 mg dose group exhibited a trend for
improvement similar to the 4 mg group, the loss of 2 patients
in this group may have reduced discriminatory power in this
small trial.
The results of the present study are unique in that a
therapeutic benefit of a pharmacologic therapy was demon-
strated after what is an exceedingly short treatment course for
chronic neuropathy. Notably, evaluation of normal subjects has
shown that the corneal nerve fiber net is highly dynamic,
undergoing significant morphologic change over a few days.30
In contrast, IENFD is stable over at least 20 days.31 This
observation depends, in part, on the method of calculating
IENFD. Specifically, density counts do not take into account the
extent of nerve fiber arborization. Since elongation and
branching of existing nerve fibers is the major mechanism
underlying regrowth,32 IENFD is an insensitive measure of
change. In contrast, quantification of new nerve fiber length

 using GAP-43 as a marker directly captures alterations in the
cutaneous nerve fiber net.
Whether the observed effect of cibinetide takes place at the
level of the nerve fiber terminals or cell bodies currently is
unclear. Based on a preclinical model of neuropathy,33 a major
target for cibinetide could be at the level of the trigeminal
ganglion where the sensory neuronal cell bodies reside. It
currently is unknown to what extent cibinetide may be
secreted into tears and thereby exert a local effect. However,
the low nanomolar peak plasma concentrations of cibinetide at
the doses administered, coupled with its short circulating half-
life, make this possibility unlikely.
The underlying plasticity of corneal nerve fibers likely
contributes to the demonstration of a significant nerve fiber
regenerative effect of cibinetide over the short treatment
period. This further is supported by the increase in epidermal
GAP-43þ nerve fiber length, suggesting that skin nerve fibers
also possess cibinetide-induced regenerative capacity. The
approximately 2 lm/fiber/day rate of cutaneous regrowth as
estimated by the GAP-43 analysis is of the same order of
magnitude as what has been observed following intracutane-
ous axotomy, but a longer treatment duration will be required
to assess the true magnitude of the effect.
Effective pharmacologic interventions have long been sought
for patients with peripheral neuropathies. Unfortunately, disease
modification strategies for these debilitating and prevalent
disorders have not yielded any approved drug therapies to
date, as long-term clinical trials have failed to demonstrate
significant treatment effects when using currently accepted end
points.34–37 In this regard, it is notable that a significant increase
in CNBD was demonstrated in type 1 diabetic patients 6 months
after successful kidney-pancreas transplantation, with a signif-
icant improvement in CNFL and CNFD at 12 months, without a
significant improvement in quantitative sensory testing, nerve
conduction studies, or IENFD.38
An increasing body of evidence supports the use of CCM to
reliably detect reduced nerve fibers in idiopathic SFN,
hereditary sensory neuropathies, Fabry disease,39 and after
chemotherapy.40 This technique has high reproducibility and
repeatability, with good sensitivity and specificity for diagnos-
ing diabetic neuropathy (DPN).41 A recent meta-analysis of
CCM in DPN (13 studies, 1680 participants) confirmed its use

 in detecting and assessing early nerve damage.42 Two recent
longitudinal studies have shown that corneal nerve fiber loss
predicts the development of DPN43 more accurately than
traditional measures of neuropathy, such as quantitative
sensory testing and nerve conduction studies,44 and corneal
nerve loss has been related to elevated hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) and reduced high density lipoprotein.45 Our findings
further support the use of CCM as a surrogate endpoint to
assess small nerve fiber damage and repair in peripheral
neuropathies.
In addition to enhanced nerve fiber growth, the current
results, along with those of a prior sarcoidosis study,13
suggested that cibinetide therapy may improve functional
capacity as assessed by the 6MWT. The 6MWT is a well-
established outcome assessment for a variety of diseases, as it
provides an integrated global measure of ambulatory function.
FIGURE 2.
Examples of corneal small nerve fiber change following 28 doses of cibinetide. Small nerve fibers visualized in the sub-basal layer of the
cornea using in vivo confocal microscopy (top) and GAP-43 immunoreactivity within the epidermis of biopsies of distal lower limb (bottom), exhibit
increases following daily administration of 4 mg of cibinetide. The distribution of corneal nerve fibers is shown for a healthy volunteer (A),
compared to that of a subject having sarcoidosis with SNFL enrolled in the current study at baseline (B) and after 28 days of cibinetide (4 mg)
treatment (C). Skin biopsies immunostained for GAP-43 reveal intraepidermal nerve fibers at baseline ([D]; arrow), which become more numerous
with branching following cibinetide (4 mg; [E]). *Dermal-epidermal junction. Skin biopsy scale bar: 100 lm.
FIGURE 3.
Change in CNFA is correlated with changes in biomarker and functional indices following cibinetide administration. (A) At day 28,
change in CNFA was positively correlated with change in GAP-43þ nerve fiber staining as assessed by Spearman’s rank-order correlation for the
cibinetide 4 mg group (q ¼ 0.575; P ¼ 0.025). (B) Change in CNFA also was positively correlated with change in 6MWT (Spearman’s q ¼ 0.645; P ¼
0.009).

 Recently, the 6MWT was shown to correlate with CNFL in
patients with DPN46 as well as with the severity of pain in a
population with chronic pain.47 The strong, significant
correlation between an increase in CNFA and an increase in
6MWT noted in the current study provides support for the
clinical relevance of the early corneal nerve fiber improve-
ments seen with cibinetide. It remains unclear whether the
improvements in the 6MWT are due to a reduction of pain,
improvement of dysautonomia, or other factors.
In contrast to previous trials of short-term cibinetide
administration in painful SNFL, our results did not demonstrate
between-group differences using patient-reported outcome
instruments. The design of the trial, without a run-in period
and only limited exposure to cibinetide, may help explain this
finding, as a strong placebo effect was noted for these
parameters. This phenomenon has been noted with increasing
frequency in painful neuropathy clinical trials, with the
magnitude of placebo group improvement ranging from 0%
to 60% of subjects experiencing pain reductions of ‡50% from
baseline.48 However, in patients with moderate pain at
baseline, the cibinetide 4 mg treatment arm demonstrated a
placebo-corrected improvement in pain at day 28 with an
effect size comparable to results noted for approved/first-line
neuropathic pain medications.48
One theoretical concern is whether newly regenerated
nerve fibers could adversely affect neuropathic symptoms, as
preclinical models show that new nerve fiber regrowth often is
accompanied by the development of allodynia and/or hyper-
algesia.49 Therefore, it is reassuring to note that, in addition to
demonstrable pain relief, preclinical data with cibinetide in
capsaicin-induced pain have shown antagonism of TRPV1-
mediated hyperalgesia,10 and improved thermal sensory
thresholds mediated by C-fibers, following 28 days of cibine-
tide administration in subjects with sarcoidosis and SNFL.13
Nevertheless, additional studies will be needed to assess the
potential long-term effects of cibinetide with respect to the
development of allodynia.
This study has limitations. First, only patients having pain
were included whereas some patients have painless SNFL.4 It
currently is unknown how these individuals would respond to
cibinetide, particularly with respect to potential symptoms
related to nerve fiber regrowth. Second, the treatment period
was only for 28 days, which is likely not long enough to predict
the full effects of cibinetide, nor offset placebo responses.

 Third, the study was powered to detect a change from baseline
in the SFNSL in a within-group analysis, and, thus, may have
been underpowered to be able to detect significant treatment
effects for other patient-reported outcomes. Fourth, the
number of patients included is small and the loss of the
patients in the 8 mg group may have prevented a clearer
assessment as to whether the trend toward improvement
noted for this dosage was real. Finally, we did not formally
mandate ophthalmologic assessment for ocular sarcoidosis
during the screening period. Although the subjects typically
had been screened previously for ocular disease, it is possible
that occult ocular inflammation may have been present, which
also may have led to reduced corneal nerve fiber in a subset of
patients. However, the correlation between CCM and markers
of extraocular neuropathy (i.e., GAP-43 staining) suggested that
it is more likely that the CNFA is representative of SFN rather
than an effect of ocular sarcoidosis.
Although the present study focused on sarcoidosis, SNFL is
increasingly recognized as commonly associated with a broad
spectrum of disease processes.1 Therefore, cibinetide may
exhibit restorative function in other diseases complicated by
SNFL, and indeed, data obtained from a group of type 2
diabetic patients with painful SNFL have been encouraging.12
Based on the promising effect on objective (nerve regrowth
assessed by two different measures of nerve fiber regeneration:
CNFA and GAP 43þ IENF immunostaining), functional (6MWT),
and symptomatic (pain) parameters, cibinetide warrants
continued assessment as a potential disease modifying therapy
for SNFL.
