 Summary
Recurrent point mutations in SPOP define a distinct molecular subclass of prostate cancer. Here, 
we describe a mouse model showing that mutant SPOP drives prostate tumorigenesis in vivo. 
Conditional expression of mutant SPOP in the prostate dramatically altered phenotypes in the 
setting of Pten loss, with early neoplastic lesions (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) 
with striking nuclear atypia, and invasive poorly differentiated carcinoma. In mouse prostate 
organoids, mutant SPOP drove increased proliferation and a transcriptional signature consistent 
with human prostate cancer. Using these models and human prostate cancer samples, we show that 
SPOP mutation activates both PI3K/mTOR and androgen receptor (AR) signaling, effectively 
uncoupling the normal negative feedback between these two pathways.

Blattner et al. develop a mouse model and use it to demonstrate that human SPOP mutation can 
drive prostate tumorigenesis through coordinate deregulation of both PI3K/mTOR and AR 
pathways. The study provides insights to both unique and common features of molecular subtypes 
of human prostate cancer.
Introduction
Recurrent missense mutations in SPOP are the most common point mutations in primary 
prostate cancer, occurring in about 10% of both clinically localized and metastatic disease 
(Barbieri et al., 2012; Berger et al., 2011; Blattner et al., 2014; Cancer Genome Atlas 
Research, 2015; Robinson et al., 2015). SPOP mutations define a distinct and key molecular 
class of prostate cancer, with characteristic genomic alterations, patterns of genomic 
rearrangements, gene expression profiles and methylation patterns (Barbieri et al., 2012; 
Blattner et al., 2014; Boysen et al., 2015; Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2015). SPOP 
mutations occur early in the natural history of prostate cancer solely as heterozygous 
missense mutations with dominant negative, selective loss of function towards the remaining 
wild-type allele (Baca et al., 2013; Boysen et al., 2015; Prandi et al., 2014; Theurillat et al., 
2014). To date, no models have established the role of SPOP mutation as a driver of prostate 
neoplasia in vivo, and studies exploring the downstream effects of SPOP mutations have 
largely relied on overexpression of mutant SPOP protein in cell lines with alterations outside 
the genetic context of SPOP mutant prostate cancer (Geng et al., 2013; Geng et al., 2014; 
Blattner et al.

 González-Billalabeitia et al., 2014; Pierce et al., 2015; Theurillat et al., 2014). Here, we 
report development of a conditional mouse model to define the role of SPOP mutation as a 
driver of prostate tumorigenesis in vivo.
Results
SPOP mutation drives prostate neoplasia in vivo in combination with Pten loss
To determine the impact of SPOP mutation in the prostate, we developed a transgenic mouse 
with prostate-specific conditional expression of SPOP-F133V, a common missense mutation 
found in human prostate cancer (Figure 1) (Barbieri et al., 2012; Berger et al., 2011; Cancer 
Genome Atlas Research, 2015). Specifically, we utilized a lox-STOP-lox strategy with the 
human SPOP-F133V transgene knocked into the Rosa26 locus (hereafter R26F133V) 
(Figures 1A, S1A and S1B). These mice were crossed with PbCre4 mice to express mutant 
SPOP specifically in the prostate. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) against IRES-linked eGFP 
confirmed consistent expression of the transgene in the ventral, dorsolateral and anterior 
lobes of the prostate with Cre expression (Figures S1C and S1D), and cell lines derived from 
these prostates confirmed physiological levels of SPOP-F133V protein expression compared 
to endogenous Spop protein (Figure S1C). We observed minimal alterations in prostate 
glandular architecture and histology due to SPOP-F133V expression (Figure S1D), no 
differences in proliferation as measured by Ki67 expression, and no differences in overall 
androgen receptor (AR) expression based on IHC (Figure S1E). However, rare areas in the 
SPOP mutant prostate showed outlier levels of AR expression (Figure 1B and S1F), and rare 
cells showed cytologic atypia with enlarged nuclei (Figure 1B and S1G) in a majority of 
mice ≥12 months (3 of 5 examined). These findings were absent in age-matched control 
mice. These data suggest that SPOP mutation may affect specific cytologic phenotypes, but 
like many other known alterations in human prostate cancer (e.g., ERG, ETV1, TP53), alone 
it is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis in the mouse prostate, at least in the specific genetic 
context of this model.
PTEN is a key tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Conditional heterozygous Pten loss 
(PtenL/+) in the mouse prostate has been reported to show minimal histologic phenotype 
(Trotman et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003). To determine if SPOP mutation accelerated or 
alters prostate phenotypes in other genetic backgrounds, we generated mice expressing 
mutant SPOP in a conditional Pten heterozygous background (PbCre; PtenL/+; R26F133V). In 
the PtenL/+ setting, mice expressing mutant SPOP displayed a highly penetrant phenotype 
with focal areas of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) by 6 months of 
age (Figures 1C, 1E and S1I). Importantly, the histologic phenotype of HG-PIN in PtenL/+; 
R26F133V mice was distinct, characterized by a striking degree of nuclear atypia compared 
to the rarer HG-PIN with minimal atypia in PtenL/+ control mice (Figures 1D, 1E, 1H, and 
S1J). Areas of HG-PIN in SPOP-F133V mice showed high levels of phosphorylated Akt and 
AR as determined by IHC (Figures 1E, 1G and S1H), and increased Ki-67 positive cells 
(Figure 1F). At advanced age (>12 months), areas of invasive cancer were observed in one 
out of five PtenL/+;R26F133V mice (Figure 1I and S1K). We conclude from these data that in 
the context of heterozygous Pten loss, SPOP mutation drives a distinct phenotype of HG-
PIN with atypia and the potential to transition to invasive carcinoma.

 PTEN deletions and mutations, while rare in the early phases of the SPOP mutant subtype of 
human prostate cancer (Barbieri et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2015), 
become more frequent in advanced prostate cancer (Figure S2A) (Grasso et al., 2012; 
Robinson et al., 2015) suggesting that PTEN deletion may contribute to progression of 
SPOP mutant prostate cancer (Barbieri et al., 2014; Haffner et al., 2013). We therefore next 
examined the impact of SPOP mutation in the setting of conditional homozygous Pten loss. 
PbCre; PtenL/L mice developed diffuse, highly proliferative HG-PIN without evidence of 
invasive cancer, but with cystic enlargement of the anterior prostate grossly (Figures 2A–D). 
In contrast, by 12 months of age PbCre; PtenL/L; R26F133V mice displayed severely enlarged 
prostates with areas of solid tumor (Figure 2A, S2B). Histologically, 80% of mice 
expressing mutant SPOP displayed invasive, poorly differentiated carcinomas (Figures 2C, 
2D and S2C). These tumors were highly proliferative, with transitional sarcomatoid 
differentiation and maintained expression of AR (Figures 2D, S2D). We conclude from these 
data that SPOP mutation is able to cooperate with loss of Pten to drive invasive prostate 
cancer in vivo.
SPOP mutant prostate organoids show increased proliferation without AR upregulation
Previous reports studying the biology and downstream effects of SPOP mutations in prostate 
cancer have relied on ectopic overexpression of SPOP proteins in cell lines with multiple 
preexisting genetic alterations (An et al., 2015; An et al., 2014; Gan et al., 2015; Geng et al., 
2014; Theurillat et al., 2014), making the physiologic relevance of these models for normal 
prostate cells difficult to interpret. SPOP mutation occurs early in the natural history of 
prostate cancer and defines a distinct genetic subtype not represented by prostate cancer cell 
lines, therefore it may be necessary to study its effects in benign prostate cells. Organoid 
platforms represent an opportunity to study the effect of cancer-associated alterations in 
genetically normal cells that can recapitulate the cell biology and epithelial architecture of 
the prostate (Chua et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014; Karthaus et al., 2014). To establish models 
to study the underlying biology affected by SPOP mutation in prostate cells, organoid lines 
from the prostates of R26F133V mice (Pten WT background) were isolated and engineered to 
expressed tamoxifen inducible Cre (Cre-ERT2) (Figure 3A). After treatment with 4-
hydroxytamoxifen or vehicle, cells were sorted for GFP and physiologically relevant levels 
of mutant SPOP protein expression was confirmed by Western blot (Figure 3A). Organoid 
lines were then grown as 2D monolayer cultures or 3D cultures in Matrigel. As previously 
described (Chua et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014; Karthaus et al., 2014), in 3D cultures 
organoids recapitulated features of prostate histology, including growth as multilayered 
structures with nuclear AR and expression of CK5 and CK8 in basal and luminal cells, 
respectively (Figure 3B).
Compared to controls, SPOP mutant organoids showed a higher rate of organoid formation 
capability and resulting organoids showed more irregular borders with no differences in size 
(Figures 3B, 3C and S3A), and increased Ki-67 expression enriched in the basal layer 
(Figures 3B and 3D). 2D proliferation assays showed increased proliferation of mutant cells 
(Figure 3E). Increased cell growth was confirmed in multiple SPOP mutant organoid lines, 
including those with Cre expressed under control of the probasin promoter (Figure S3B). 
SPOP mutation also resulted in protein upregulation of previously reported SPOP substrates

 Dek and Src3 (Figure 3G and S3C) (Geng et al., 2013; Theurillat et al., 2014). We saw no 
consistent increased expression of AR by either IHC or Western blot (Figures 3B, 3F and 
3G), however, rare individual biological replicates showed increased AR protein (Figure 
S3C). We did not observe any alterations in Pten expression, although both AR and PTEN 
have been reported to be SPOP substrates (Figure 2G) (An et al., 2014; Geng et al., 2014; Li 
et al., 2014). Taken together, these data support that physiologic levels of mutant SPOP 
expression alone is sufficient to confer features of transformed cells.
Transcriptional profiling of SPOP mutant organoids shows relevance to human prostate 
cancer and nominates PI3K/mTOR activation
To provide further insight to the signaling pathways deregulated by SPOP mutation and 
determine the relevance of these models to human prostate cancer, we performed RNA-seq 
on SPOP mutant organoids and controls. RNA-seq reads mapped to human and mouse 
SPOP confirmed appropriate expression of the F133V transgenic transcript without 
overexpression compared to endogenous mouse Spop (Figures S1C and S4A). We defined 
differentially expressed genes, with robust clustering according to SPOP status (Figure 4A 
and Table S1). Interrogating the gene space nominated by SPOP mutant mouse organoids in 
the transcriptomes of clinically localized human prostate cancer samples (TCGA) revealed 
significant clustering of known SPOP mutant tumors (P = 2.57 × 10−10, Figure 4B). SPOP 
mutations at F133 and other amino acids (e.g. Y87, F102, W131) were well represented in 
the cluster, as were genomic features known to be associated with SPOP mutant prostate 
cancer (including genomic deletions at 5q21, 6q15, and 2q21)(Barbieri et al., 2012; Boysen 
et al., 2015) indicating that SPOP-F133V in mouse prostate engaged a transcriptional 
program consistent with SPOP mutant human prostate cancer (Figure 4B). Differentially 
expressed genes in SPOP mutant mouse prostate organoids showed significant overlap with 
differentially expressed genes in human prostate cancer (Figure 4C). Molecularly, human 
prostate cancers can be classified into those harboring rearrangements in ETS transcription 
factors (e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG) and those lacking ETS rearrangements (Rubin et al., 2011). 
SPOP mutant prostate cancers are exclusively ETS rearrangement negative, and 
differentially expressed genes in SPOP mutant mouse prostate organoids overlapped 
specifically with ETS rearrangement negative human prostate cancer (Figure 4C). Together, 
these data suggest that expression of SPOP-F133V in mouse prostate epithelium 
recapitulates transcriptional features of human SPOP mutant prostate cancer.
Having established the relevance of the mutant SPOP organoid model to human SPOP 
mutant prostate cancer, we next explored the signaling pathways deregulated by SPOP 
mutation. Unbiased gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominated multiple pathways as 
deregulated by SPOP mutation (Figure 4D and Table S2). Multiple independently derived 
organoid lines with induction of SPOP mutation showed strong concordance across prostate 
gene sets (Figure S4B). We previously reported that SPOP mutation affects genomic 
stability similar to BRCA1 inactivation (Boysen et al., 2015) and saw evidence of this in the 
transcriptional response to SPOP-F133V in mouse organoids (Figure S4C). Despite previous 
reports that SPOP mutation drives AR transcriptional output in vitro (Geng et al., 2014), and 
that SPOP mutant human prostate cancer is associated with increased AR transcriptional 
output in TCGA data (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2015), we saw no evidence that gene

 sets defined by androgen regulation in either mouse or human prostates were enriched in 
SPOP mutant mouse organoids (Figure S4D). Instead, we saw enrichment of multiple 
pathways associated with activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, including signatures of 
KRAS activation, PTEN inactivation, and AKT dysregulation (Figure 4D and Table S2). 
GSEA focused specifically on gene sets involving PI3K/mTOR signaling showed significant 
enrichment in prostate cells expressing mutant SPOP (Figure 4E and 4F). These data 
nominate SPOP mutation as a lesion activating PI3K/mTOR signaling in mouse and human 
prostate.
SPOP mutation activates PI3K/mTOR signaling
Previous studies exploring downstream signaling effects of SPOP mutations have not 
identified activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, but have utilized cell lines with multiple 
genetic alterations, which could mask pathway activation (An et al., 2015; An et al., 2014; 
Gan et al., 2015; Geng et al., 2014; Theurillat et al., 2014). We therefore hypothesized that 
in genetically normal prostate epithelial cells, SPOP mutation resulted in deregulation of 
PI3K/mTOR signaling. IHC using antibodies against phosphorylated S6 (pS6), a marker of 
mTOR pathway activation, in prostates of PbCre; R26F133V mice showed focal areas of 
intense pS6 staining, particularly in areas with nuclear atypia, that were absent in controls 
(Figures 5A and S5A). Mouse prostate organoids expressing mutant SPOP alone showed 
increased levels of both pS6 (Figure 5B) and phosphorylated 4eBP1 (p4eBP1) (Figure S5B), 
another marker of mTOR pathway activation; this was observed in multiple organoid lines, 
with Cre expressed under the control of different promoters (Figure 5C and S5C). Increased 
activation of mTOR signaling by SPOP-F133V was maintained in prostate tissue from 
PbCre; PtenL/L; R26F133V mice (Figure 5D). Finally, treatment of organoids with Torin1, a 
potent inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, again revealed increased mTOR output in 
SPOP mutant organoids (Figure 5E).
To determine if activation of PI3K signaling by SPOP mutation was supported by genomic 
events observed in human prostate cancer samples, we examined three publicly available 
datasets comprising 498 tumors (Baca et al., 2013; Barbieri et al., 2012; Cancer Genome 
Atlas Research, 2015). Analysis showed mutual exclusivity between SPOP mutations and 
genomic alterations in components of PI3K signaling that are significantly recurrently 
altered in clinically localized prostate cancer, including deletions and mutations in PTEN, 
and amplification and mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1 (Figures 5F and S5D), consistent 
with previous data (Barbieri et al., 2012). Consistent with this, in PtenL/+ mice, all prostate 
glands expressing p-AKT showed loss of Pten protein expression, while PtenL/+; R26F133V 
prostates showed activation of Akt despite persistent Pten expression (Figures 5G and S5E). 
Finally, in reverse-phase protein array data from 250 clinically localized human prostate 
cancer samples, SPOP mutant human prostate cancers had significantly higher expression of 
phospho-T37 and phospho-T70 4eBP1, consistent with PI3K/mTOR activation (Figure 
S5F). In human prostate cancer samples and mouse organoids, we did not identify gene 
expression changes in components of PI3K signaling in SPOP mutant tumors (Figure S5G), 
suggesting that pathway activation was not due to transcriptional upregulation of PI3K 
components. Taken together, these data suggest that SPOP mutation is associated with

 activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling in mouse prostate tissue and in human prostate cancer 
samples.
Activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling by mutant SPOP is mediated by SRC3
SRC3, encoded by NCOA3, is a bona fide substrate of SPOP and has been shown to be 
stabilized by prostate cancer specific SPOP mutants (Geng et al., 2013). We confirmed that 
Src3 protein was upregulated by SPOP-F133V in mouse organoids (Figure 3G and S3C) and 
prostate tissue (Figure 6A). SRC3 has also been reported to activate PI3K signaling through 
transcriptional upregulation of IGF-1 (Torres-Arzayus et al., 2004). We confirmed in 
prostate organoids that mutant SPOP was associated with increased Igf1 mRNA in both Pten 
WT and Pten deleted backgrounds (Figure 6B), and knockdown of Src3 with siRNA 
abrogated the increase in Igf1 expression by mutant SPOP (Figure 6C). Furthermore, 
inhibition of IGF1R abrogated the increase in pS6 and pAkt protein levels in SPOP mutant 
prostate cells (Figure S6A), and stimulation with IGF1 ligand increased pS6 and pAkt in 
SPOP WT controls to levels comparable to SPOP mutant cells (Figure S6B). We therefore 
hypothesized that activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling by mutant SPOP could be mediated 
by SRC3. Knockdown of Src3 in mouse prostate organoids reduced the increase in pS6 
protein levels seen with mutant SPOP, in both Pten WT (Figure 6D) and Pten deleted (Figure 
6E) backgrounds. These data support that activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling by SPOP 
mutation is mediated in part through the SPOP substrate SRC3.
SPOP mutation maintains AR activity against PI3K mediated feedback inhibition
PI3K and AR signaling have significant reciprocal negative feedback, with PI3K activation 
resulting in downregulation of AR signaling (Carver et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2015; 
Mulholland et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2013). We therefore hypothesized that in our model 
systems, previously reported upregulation of AR signaling by mutant SPOP could be 
masked by the concomitant activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling. We examined the impact of 
SPOP mutation on AR protein level in mouse organoids with inactivation of PI3K/mTOR 
signaling. Treatment with Torin1 resulted in a relative increase in AR protein expression 
with SPOP-F133V (Figure 7A). In addition, modulation of mTOR activity with various 
doses of Torin1 led to an expected inverse relationship between AR protein levels and 
mTOR activity (as measured with pS6 and p4eBP1) in control cells (Figure 7A). In contrast, 
organoids expressing SPOP-F133V maintained AR expression in the face of higher mTOR 
activity (Figure 7A). We next examined the consequences of SPOP mutation on expression 
of AR in mouse organoids with activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling. Prostate organoids 
cultured in low (5 ng/mL) or high (50 ng/mL) EGF conditions were examined for AR and 
pS6 protein levels by IHC. As expected, control cells responded to increased EGF with 
increased pS6 levels, increased Ki67 staining and a dramatic decrease in AR protein 
expression (Figures 7B and S6A), In contrast, SPOP mutant organoids maintained higher 
AR levels with increased EGF exposure (Figure 7B).
Prostate organoids derived from PtenL/L mice showed expected increase in pAkt, and 
downregulation of AR expression (Figure 7C), consistent with previous results (Carver et 
al., 2011). In contrast, SPOP-F133V in the PtenL/L background resulted in upregulation of 
AR protein and increased expression of AR target genes (Figure 7C and 7D). This has been

 confirmed in prostate tissue from one year old PbCre,PtenL/L and PbCre,PtenL/L,R26F133V 
mice compared to age matched wild-type mice (Figure S7B). Furthermore, areas of AR and 
pS6 expression showed clear mutual exclusivity at the individual cell level in PtenL/L 
prostate organoids, while combination with SPOP-F133V resulted in co-expression of AR 
and pS6 (Figure 7E).
Next, we examined the impact of SPOP mutation on AR transcriptional output in human 
prostate cancer samples, using RNA-seq data from TCGA. When considered in isolation, 
SPOP mutation had a strong association with higher AR transcriptional score (p = 
3.65×10-5, Figure S7C). However, when molecular subtype (ETS and PTEN status) was 
considered, we observed an attenuation of this phenomenon (Figure S7D). As previously 
reported, PTEN deletion showed a strong association with decreased AR transcriptional 
activity (Carver et al., 2011), particularly in cancers harboring ETS rearrangements (p < 
0.001, Figure S7D). When compared to tumors of the same PTEN and ETS background, 
SPOP mutant tumors showed both an increase in PI3K/mTOR activity (as measured by 
p4EBP1, p = 0.019) and an increase in AR transcriptional activity (p = 0.047, Figure 7F), 
consistent with the concomitant activation of PI3K and AR signaling in these cancers. 
Together, these data support that SPOP mutation maintains AR transcriptional output in the 
setting of PI3K activation, thereby activating two major pathways in the pathogenesis of 
prostate cancer.
Proteome-wide analysis shows activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling and coordinate 
upregulation of an AR-centric protein network
To gain further insight to the proteins deregulated by expression of physiologic levels of 
mutant SPOP, we performed unbiased proteome-wide profiling of control and SPOP mutant 
mouse prostate cells (Pten WT) using label-free MS/MS. We observed significant 
differential expression in 300 proteins (≥1.5 fold, p < 0.05), with mutant SPOP resulting in 
upregulation of 187 and downregulation of 113 proteins (Figure 8A, Table S3). Consistent 
with hyperactivation of PI3K/mTOR signaling in response to SPOP-F133V, the most altered 
protein was IRS1 (down 15.9 fold, p = 0.002), known to be degraded in response to mTOR 
activation (Harrington et al., 2005). Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of altered 
proteins highlighted AKT1 as one of the top upstream regulators (Figure 8B, Table S4). 
These unbiased proteomic data reinforce the conclusion that SPOP mutation results in 
activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling.
Under these assay conditions and higher level of resolution, several previously established 
SPOP substrates showed significantly increased expression (Table S3), including TRIM24 
(up 3.9 fold, p = 0.002) and AR (up 2.24 fold, p = 0.016). Others demonstrated trends of 
increased expression, but did not meet proteome-wide significance, such as Dek (up 1.36 
fold, p = 0.036) and SRC3 (up 2.02 fold, p = 0.12).
We next determined the frequency of the established SPOP binding consensus (SBC) amino 
acid motif (nonpolar [ϕ] – polar [π] – S/T – S/T – S/T) in all significant altered proteins. 
Upregulated proteins were significantly more likely to harbor a SBC than downregulated 
proteins (Figure 8C, Table S5), consistent with the hypothesis that SPOP-F133V acts as a 
dominant negative. We next performed de novo motif analysis on the top upregulated

 proteins to determine if there were amino-acid sequences specifically associated with 
increased expression in response to SPOP-F133V. This revealed a number of serine-rich 
motifs distinct from the canonical SBC (Figure S8A). The amino acid sequence S-S-S-x-x-S 
was the top enriched motif in upregulated proteins, and was present in established SPOP 
substrates such as Trim24 and AR, AR cofactors such as Rnf14 and other upregulated 
proteins with potential relevance to transcriptional control and prostate cancer pathogenesis, 
such as Brd2, Atr and Setb1 (Figure 8D, Table S6). Interestingly, another highly enriched 
amino acid sequenced contained the L-x-x-L-L motif (Figure S8A, Table S6) known to 
mediate the interaction of transcriptional coactivators with nuclear hormone receptors 
(McInerney et al., 1998).
Finally, to gain insight to the associations among proteins deregulated by SPOP-F133V, we 
performed a network analysis of up- and down-regulated proteins using STRING, a database 
of known and predicted protein-protein interactions (Szklarczyk et al., 2015). Consistent 
with the hypothesis that mutant SPOP acts as a dominant negative to coordinately upregulate 
networks of functionally related proteins, we observed a robust network among proteins 
upregulated by mutant SPOP (Figure 8E); in contrast, there was minimal network structure 
in downregulated proteins (Figure S8B). In particular, there was a subnetwork of 
upregulated proteins centered around AR, including the AR-associated transcription factor 
HOXB13 (Norris et al., 2009), and AR coactivators EP300 (Debes et al., 2002), DNA-PK 
(Goodwin et al., 2015), SRC3 (Xu et al., 2009) and TRIM24 (Groner et al.). Using 
immunoblots, we confirmed increased expression of HoxB13 and p300, using both mouse 
and human prostate cells expressing mutant SPOP (Figure 8F, Figure S8C and D). Taken 
together, these data suggest that mutant SPOP acts as a dominant negative to coordinately 
deregulate networks of functionally related proteins, and in particular may effect 
upregulation of transcriptional complexes consisting of AR and associated transcription 
factors and co-activators.
Discussion
Comprehensive molecular characterization of prostate cancer has revealed numerous 
molecular alterations with the potential to act as drivers of cancer development and 
progression. These include several genes previously not implicated in carcinogenesis, 
making their functional significance unclear. SPOP mutations are the most common point 
mutations in clinically localized prostate cancer, yet SPOP was only recently implicated as a 
cancer gene. This study shows that SPOP mutation promotes prostate tumorigenesis in vivo, 
clearly defining it as a cancer driver (vs. passenger) and reinforcing its importance in human 
prostate cancer.
AR and PI3K signaling represent two critical signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of 
human prostate cancer. Recent data has exposed reciprocal negative feedback between AR 
and PI3K signaling (Carver et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2015; Mulholland et al., 2011; Thomas et 
al., 2013). Here we show that SPOP mutation disrupts this feedback, allowing coordinate 
activation of both pathways, supporting prostate carcinogenesis. In human prostate cancer, 
separate genomic events leading to independent activation of these pathways are common. 
For instance, ERG rearrangement and PTEN inactivation commonly co-occur in primary

 prostate cancer (Barbieri et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2015; Taylor et al., 
2010); PTEN loss drives PI3K activation while ERG maintains AR transcription in this 
setting (Carver et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013). In human prostate cancer, the SPOP mutant 
subclass has been associated with increase AR activity (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 
2015). However, single events resulting in coordinate regulation of these pathways have not 
been described. Our report of SPOP mutation as a single genomic event activating both AR 
and PI3K signaling provides insight to biology underlying this unique subclass of prostate 
cancer, and potentially suggests signaling convergence that underlies the mutual exclusivity 
between SPOP mutation and ERG rearrangement. Furthermore, these findings reinforce the 
critical nature of AR and PI3K signaling across prostate cancer classes, and may suggest 
opportunities for therapeutic intervention upstream of these two critical pathways. In 
addition, activation of AR signaling may confer dependency on this pathway in SPOP 
mutant prostate cancers and increased sensitivity to androgen targeting therapy. Unlike other 
genomic alterations, SPOP mutation is not increased in prevalence in castration resistant 
prostate cancer (Robinson et al., 2015), and may even be depleted in these cancers, 
suggesting preferential response to ADT. However, understanding the full extent of 
mechanisms responsible for the effect of SPOP mutation on these signaling pathways, the 
interaction between them, and the impact on therapeutic sensitivity, requires additional 
investigation.
Genetically engineered mouse models have played a key role in understanding the biology 
of prostate cancer, defining the impact of critical alterations observed in human disease, and 
developing effective treatment strategies. Interestingly, key alterations observed in human 
prostate cancer (such as overexpression of ERG or ETV1 and deletion of TP53) are 
insufficient for prostate neoplasia in mice, but show neoplastic phenotypes in combination 
with other alterations (Baena et al., 2013; Carver et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013; Chen et al., 
2005). Here, we show this is the case with SPOP mutation as well, at least in the specific 
genetic context of this model – one caveat is that mice of the C57BL/6 background are often 
considered relatively tumor resistant (Svensson et al., 2011), and we cannot speculate on the 
consequences of SPOP mutation in other backgrounds. The cytologic abnormalities with 
prostate-specific conditional expression of SPOP-F133V alone may reflect activation of 
underlying oncogenic pathways, which result in robust neoplastic phenotypes in 
combination with Pten deletion. This spectrum of genetic alterations provides the 
opportunity to study the role of SPOP mutation as an early event in cancer initiation 
(Pten+/+), a key driver in cancer progression (PtenL/+) and its role in more advanced disease 
(PtenL/L).
The study of early alterations in a relatively genetically normal context may be crucial for 
defining the biological effects on prostate cancer development. SPOP mutation occurs early 
in the natural history of prostate cancer (Boysen et al., 2015), and ectopic introduction of 
SPOP mutations in cell lines with multiple alterations may mask oncogenic effects. We 
observed that conditional expression of mutant SPOP alone in mouse prostate organoids 
results in transcriptional changes consistent with human prostate cancer, reinforcing the 
relevance of our model and the important role of mutated SPOP in prostate cancer 
pathogenesis. In addition, all SPOP mutations observed in human prostate cancer are 
heterozygous, with roughly equal expression of the wild-type and mutant alleles (Barbieri et 
Blattner et al.

 al., 2012). Our conditional mouse model systems show nearly 1:1 expression of endogenous 
and mutant SPOP proteins, recapitulating physiologically relevant expression levels in 
human disease.
SPOP encodes the substrate recognition component of a CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
and prostate cancer derived SPOP mutants appear to act as dominant negatives with selective 
loss of function (Boysen et al., 2015). Known substrates of SPOP are numerous, and the 
specific substrates that are deregulated by SPOP mutations are starting to be defined. These 
include the chromatin-associated oncogene DEK (Theurillat et al., 2014), the oncogenic co-
activator TRIM24 (Groner et al.; Theurillat et al., 2014) and the androgen receptor itself (An 
et al., 2014) (Geng et al., 2014). We show that SRC3 (NCOA3), another SPOP substrate 
stabilized by SPOP mutation (Geng et al., 2013), mediates, at least in part, the activation of 
PI3K/mTOR signaling by SPOP mutation. Furthermore, an unbiased proteomics approach 
revealed additional candidate proteins regulated by SPOP mutation. Most importantly, it 
showed increased expression of not only AR, but a network of multiple AR-associated 
transcription factors and co-activators. Consistent with this, proteins upregulated by mutant 
SPOP are enriched for the L-x-x-L-L motif, a key mediator of interaction between co-
activators and nuclear receptors (Heery et al., 1997; McInerney et al., 1998). This raises the 
possibility that SPOP mutation can coordinately deregulate multiple components of 
transcriptional complexes rather than a single substrate, therefore amplifying its impact on 
prostate cancer pathogenesis. Given the ability of ubiquitin ligases to coordinate networks of 
signaling events, it is highly likely that no single substrate of SPOP is responsible for all 
downstream oncogenic phenotypes. Further investigation will continue to define which 
SPOP substrates, individually or in combination, are critical for prostate tumorigenesis.
The relationship between SPOP mutations and other genomic alterations in the PI3K 
pathway (such as PTEN deletions) in prostate cancer is likely complex. Here, we show that 
the histologic phenotypes observed in the prostate when SPOP mutation is combined with 
Pten loss are distinct from the histology with Pten loss alone, rather than acceleration of the 
Pten deleted phenotype. In addition, SPOP mutation primarily affects readouts of mTOR 
activity, with less effect on Akt activation driven by Pten loss, consistent with parallel 
signaling rather than truly redundant pathways. SPOP mutations occur early in the natural 
history of prostate cancer, while PTEN deletions are generally later events. As we and others 
have shown, SPOP mutations are mutually exclusive with genomic alterations in PI3K 
pathway components in early, clinically localized disease states, but these alterations co-
occur in more advanced cancers, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Whether 
the emergence of PTEN alterations in advanced SPOP mutant cancers represents natural 
biological progression or a mechanism of resistance to therapy will require additional 
investigation.
In summary, we report that mutation of SPOP, the most common missense mutations in 
prostate cancer, results in neoplasia in the mouse prostate. Physiologic expression of mutant 
SPOP activates PI3K/mTOR signaling in vitro and in vivo and upregulates a network of AR-
associated transcription factors and co-activators. SPOP mutation maintains AR 
transcriptional activity against PI3K/mTOR mediated negative feedback, effectively 
activating two pathways critical for the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

 Experimental Procedures
Gene Targeting and mouse breeding
All mouse studies are approved by Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Care and Use 
Committee under protocol 2015-0022. Gene targeting was performed as previously 
described (Chen et al., 2013). To generate prostate specific SPOP-F133V expression 
Rosa26SPOP/SPOP mice were crossed with previously described PbCre4, PtenL/+ mice 
(Trotman et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2001). Only male PbCre4 positive mice were used to carry 
the PbCre4 allele. All described mice are in a C57BL/6 background.
Mouse prostate harvest
Prostate tissue was harvested from euthanized mice using Co2 and samples were either 
prepared using liquid nitrogen for fresh frozen samples or fixed in 4% formalin over night 
and embedded in paraffin. Sectioning of the prostate was performed as described (Shappell 
et al., 2004).
Pathological review
All sections were reviewed by two independent board certified genitourinary pathologists 
specific expertise in mouse models of human prostate cancer (B.D.R., M.I.). All review was 
performed blinded to genotype.
Protein analysis
Tissue paraffin embedding, sectioning, H&E as well as IHC staining were performed by the 
translational research program at WCM pathology and laboratory medicine. Full list of all 
antibodies used in this study and conditions please see supplemental experimental 
procedures.
Mouse prostate organoid generation and experiments
Prostate tissue was extracted from euthanized mice and digested as previously described 
(Lukacs et al., 2010). Cells were plated in Matrigel (Corning, BD 356231) and covered by 
mouse media containing 5–50ng/ml EGF. Media and culture condition as previously 
described (Karthaus et al., 2014). Inducible organoid systems: Mouse prostate cells were 
virally infected with a CreERT2 construct and selected with puromycin (Line_A) or 
generated from a mouse containing transgenic TMPRSS2-CreERT2 construct (Line_B, (Gao 
et al., 2016)). CreERT2 was activated by adding 1μM 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, 
T176) into the media over night. Either GFP or blind (for control cells) sorting was 
performed on the BD FACSAria – II. Non-inducible organoid system: Organoid lines with 
Cre expression under the control Probasin promoter were generated by taking tissue from 
PbCre negative and PbCre;R26F133V mice. Cell growth was measured in a 96 well format by 
using PicoGreen (Invitrogen, P7581). For “organoid formation assay” 10 single cells were 
plated per well (total of 48) on day 1. Number of formed organoids was counted on day 7 as 
well as day 14 post plating. Size of organoid was measured on day 14 with cellSens software 
by Olympus.
Please see supplemental experimental procedure for further details.

 Significance
Recurrent point mutations in SPOP occur early in 10% of prostate cancers defining a 
distinct molecular subclass. Our findings show that SPOP mutation drives prostate 
neoplasia in vivo through coordinate deregulation of both PI3K/mTOR and AR 
pathways. The discovery that SPOP mutation can activate two of the major pathways in 
prostate cancer exposes not only the biology of the SPOP mutant subclass, but the central 
importance of these pathways and their context across the spectrum of prostate cancer. 
These findings provide insight to both the unique and common features of molecular 
subtypes of human prostate cancer and highlight potential opportunities for precision 
therapy.

 Highlights
•
Mutations in SPOP are driver events that result in prostate tumorigenesis in 
the mouse.
•
SPOP mutation activates PI3K/mTOR signaling in vitro and in vivo through 
upregulation of its substrate SRC3 (NCOA3).
•
SPOP mutation maintains AR signaling against PI3K/mTOR mediated 
negative feedback.
•
Proteome-wide analysis reveals upregulation of a network of AR-associated 
transcription factors and co-activators by mutant SPOP.
