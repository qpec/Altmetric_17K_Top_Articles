Adrenergic-mediated loss of splenic marginal zone
B cells contributes to infection susceptibility after
stroke
Laura McCulloch1, Craig J. Smith2,3 & Barry W. McColl1
Infection is a major complication of acute stroke and causes increased mortality and
morbidity; however, current interventions do not prevent infection and improve clinical
outcome in stroke patients. The mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to infection in these
patients are unclear. Splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells are innate-like lymphocytes
that provide early defence against bacterial infection. Here we show experimental stroke in
mice induces a marked loss of MZ B cells, deficiencies in capturing blood-borne antigen
and suppression of circulating IgM. These deficits are accompanied by spontaneous bacterial
lung infection. IgM levels are similarly suppressed in stroke patients. b-adrenergic receptor
antagonism after experimental stroke prevents loss of splenic MZ B cells, preserves IgM
levels, and reduces bacterial burden. These findings suggest that adrenergic-mediated loss of
MZ B cells contributes to the infection-prone state after stroke and identify systemic B-cell
disruption as a target for therapeutic manipulation.

linical outcome in stroke patients is influenced not only
by the primary brain injury but also neurological and
medical complications. Infection is the most common
complication of stroke, affecting up to one third of patients, and is
independently associated with increased short-term and long-
term mortality and morbidity1,2. Infections of bacterial origin
affecting the respiratory or urinary tracts are the most prevalent
and pneumonia itself is associated with a threefold increase in
mortality and poorer functional outcome in survivors1,3,4.
In
addition
to
dysphagia
and
immobility,
stroke-induced
impairments in some aspects of systemic immunity are thought
to contribute to risk of infection after stroke2,5–7. A general
reduction in cellularity of systemic lymphoid tissues and blood
has been described in experimental models of stroke and in
patients2,8. Impaired function of various T-cell subsets has also
been reported after experimental stroke in mice and is associated
with spontaneous pneumonia2,8–10. Activation of autonomic
neural pathways seems to be central to these systemic immune
alterations2,11,12.
Infection occurs most frequently in the first few days after
stroke; therefore, deficits in conventional mechanisms of adaptive
immunity, which are slowly activated, are unlikely to account for
the initial susceptibility to infection1,3,4. There is increasing
awareness of the importance of lymphocytes with innate-like
functions in tissue homeostasis, immune regulation and infection
control13. Marginal zone (MZ) B cells are a subset of innate-like
lymphocytes in the MZ of the spleen, an important interface
between the circulation and the immune system. MZ B cells
mediate rapid responses to bacterial infection within 1–3 days
after pathogen encounter by rapidly producing polyreactive
immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that recognise highly
conserved microbial molecular patterns. This response is a
crucial early anti-bacterial defence mechanism thought to bridge
the temporal gap until conventional follicular B cells can respond
in a T-cell-dependent manner14–19. Individuals who lack spleens
due to congenital dysfunction or surgery, or have disruptions to
their splenic MZ, are susceptible to similar strains of encapsulated
bacteria that typically cause lung infections in stroke patients20.
The susceptibility to these infections in asplenic individuals
is generally attributed to a lack of MZ B-cell-derived, T-cell-
independent, IgM and IgG antibody specific for bacterial capsular
polysaccharides21–23. MZ B cells are one of the major cellular
sources of IgM produced early after infection and individuals
with IgM deficiency are also at particular risk of bacterial
respiratory infection24–26. Thus there is an important functional
relationship among innate-like functions of splenic MZ B cells,
IgM and the lung that is essential for anti-bacterial defence. It is
therefore pertinent to identify if innate-like B-cell anti-bacterial
defences are affected by stroke, a phenomenon that has not been
investigated previously in the context of any central nervous
system (CNS) injury. In general support that systemic B-cell
populations may be sensitive to CNS injury, a loss of B-cell
populations and reduced antibody production by follicular B cells
in response to immunisation with T-cell-dependent antigen was
shown in experimental models of spinal cord trauma, although
assessment was several weeks after injury27–29. Therefore, given
that most infections occur in the first few days after stroke, and
the established role of innate-like B cells in rapid anti-bacterial
defence against strains typically affecting patients, we sought to
identify if systemic innate-like B-cell functions are affected by
ischaemic stroke and contribute to infection susceptibility.
We show that experimental stroke in mice causes rapid loss
of MZ B cells associated with impaired IgM production and
spontaneous bacterial infection. We also demonstrate lower
concentrations of circulating IgM in patients with acute ischaemic
stroke and that IgM levels are most suppressed in patients who
develop infection. Adrenergic signalling mediates these deficits,
suggesting involvement of autonomic pathways in brain-immune
communication affecting B-cell function after stroke. Blockade of
adrenergic signalling after experimental stroke using propranolol
prevents loss of MZ B cells, restores circulating IgM levels and
reduces infection. These data reveal loss of innate-like B-cell
populations and their associated functions as an important
mechanism contributing to infection susceptibility after stroke
and highlight this pathway as a potential target for intervention.
Results
Disruption to splenic B-cells after experimental stroke. The
microanatomical organisation of splenic immune cells is of cru-
cial importance to B-cell anti-microbial function, for example, by
enabling appropriate exposure to antigen and interactions with
other cell types in the optimal locations30–32. We first investigated
gross changes to splenic B-cell populations in relation to general
structural and cellular alterations after experimental stroke in
mice induced by transient (40 min) occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). This MCAO model produces
moderately
large
brain
infarction
affecting
cortical
and
subcortical tissue (see Supplementary Fig. 1). MCAO resulted
in marked disruption to the splenic microarchitecture with a loss
of lymphocyte segregation and B-cell follicular structures which
was consistent throughout the spleen (Fig. 1a). An extensive loss
of mature (B220 þ) B cells in the white pulp (WP) occurred as
early as 1 day after MCAO and was sustained to 7 day (Fig. 1b,c).
A decrease in the area of CD3 þ T-cell immunoreactivity was also
detected (Fig. 1b,d). CD21 þ follicular dendritic cell (FDC)
networks, which are normally found in B-cell follicles and are
dependent
on
B-cell-derived
signals
for
maturation
and
maintenance, were condensed and reduced in area (Fig. 1c,f).
In contrast, the number of F4/80 þ macrophages within the WP
was increased in mice 1–7 days after MCAO in comparison to
naı
¨ve and sham controls (Fig. 1e,g). As expected and consistent
with
the
correlation
between
stroke
severity
and
immunosuppression in patients, modifying the extent of brain
damage influenced splenic B-cell disruption. 20 min MCAO
generated
small
infarcts
restricted
to
striatal
tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 1) and resulted in negligible splenic
disruption
whereas
40 min
(as
above)
or
60 min
MCAO
produced
moderate
to
large
cortical/subcortical
infarcts
(Supplementary Fig. 1) and caused severe splenic disturbance.
Consistent with previous studies, spleen weights were reduced
after MCAO and inversely correlated with infarct volume
(Fig. 1h). Immunolabelling of B cells to distinguish WP showed
that larger infarcts were associated with reduced area of WP
(Fig. 1i). These data demonstrate marked disruption to B-cell
population size and positioning after MCAO that occurs in the
context of gross disorganisation of the entire splenic WP.
Experimental stroke induces a loss of marginal zone B cells.
Although we have demonstrated multiple splenic immune cell
populations are affected by experimental stroke, innate-like
splenic MZ B cells were of particular interest because their critical
importance to immune surveillance and rapid anti-bacterial
response is highly relevant to the incidence of infection in the first
few days after stroke30. MZ B cells express high levels of CD1d,
IgM and CD21/35 (also expressed on FDC within the B-cell
follicle). Marked loss of immunoreactivity for all these markers
confirmed a substantial loss of MZ B cells as early as 1 day after
MCAO and remained significantly reduced up to 5 day later
(Fig. 2a–c). MZ B cells in mice do not recirculate in the blood
but can shuttle to and from the B-cell follicle. Negligible MZ
B-cell-specific immunolabelling could be detected within the

Immunolabelling to distinguish MZ (red, IgM) from follicular B cells (green, IgD) confirms this. Quantification of MZ B-cell immunolabelling outside the

Quantitative analysis by flow cytometry showed that total
splenocyte
counts
were
reduced
by
65%
2
day
after
MCAO compared to sham-operated animals (Supplementary
Fig. 2a). Consistent with the above data, only 13% of B220 þ
CD23 �CD21/35hi MZ B cells and 25% of B220 þCD23 þ
CD21/35 þ follicular B cells remained 2 day after MCAO in
comparison to sham-operated controls (Fig. 2d, gating strategy
presented in Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Several mechanisms could contribute to this loss of MZ B cells,
including death, migration or lack of repopulation (see also
below). Increased TUNEL labelling was present in spleens 1–7
days after MCAO in comparison to sham and naı
¨ve controls
(Fig. 2e). Furthermore, a large percentage of MZ B cell (Fig. 2f)
and follicular B cell (Fig. 2g) immunolabelling co-localizing with
TUNEL was evident after MCAO even at time points when few
MZ B cells were present. Labelling of MZ B-cell marker (CD1d)
was detected within MOMA-1 (CD169) þ MZ macrophages
(Fig. 2h). Together, these data show that stroke induces a
substantial loss of splenic B cells, notably MZ B cells, most likely
through death and removal by local phagocytes rather than
relocation to the B-cell follicle.
Splenic transcriptome alterations after experimental stroke.
To gain insight to molecular pathways that may contribute to and
be affected by MCAO-induced splenic B-cell loss, we performed
transcriptomic analysis on spleens at the peak of disruption to
lymphoid tissue microarchitecture (5 day after MCAO, see
Fig. 1b). Comparison of splenic transcriptomes in MCAO- and
sham-operated mice showed differential expression of 4,396
transcripts including 1,818 transcripts down-regulated and 2,578
transcripts up-regulated after MCAO (Po0.05, fold changeZ1.5,
Fig. 3a). Markedly down-regulated genes included those highly
expressed by B cells and essential to B-cell function including Cr2,
involved in the capture of opsonised antigen by MZ B cells, Cxcr5,
important in maintenance of B cells in the follicle and Cd40,
important in B-cell activation (Fig. 3b). Validation of microarray
data at the RNA and protein level was carried out on selected
mediators
by
quantitative
PCR
(qPCR)
and
immuno-
histochemistry (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). The Gene Ontology
biological processes B-cell activation, lymphocyte activation and
immune system development were significantly over-represented
in the set of MCAO down-regulated genes (Fig. 3c) as were the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
haematopoietic cell lineage, primary immunodeficiency and B-cell
receptor signalling (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Within the KEGG
Hematopoietic cell lineage pathway, decreased expression of many
genes involved in mature B-cell development was particularly
apparent (Fig. 3d). B cells are reliant on factors produced by
resident stromal and immune cell populations for their main-
tenance, maturation and retention in the MZ or follicle. In con-
trast to the loss of cell intrinsic receptors on B cells that are crucial
for their survival (for example, BAFFR (Tnfrsf13c); Fig. 3e) or
positioning (for example, LFA-1 (Itgal and Itgb2); Supplementary
Fig. 3e), expression of stromal cell-derived ligands that promote
B-cell survival (for example, BAFF (Tnfsf13b); Fig. 3e) and cellular
adhesion molecules that mediate B-cell localization (for example,
Vcam1; Supplementary Fig. 3f) remained unchanged or increased.
These data suggest the effects of MCAO are sufficient to overcome
homeostatic mechanisms that regulate B-cell survival, main-
tenance and positioning within the spleen.
Experimental stroke disrupts MZ anti-bacterial function. The
splenic MZ is optimised for the screening and capture of blood-
borne pathogens that trigger innate-like rapid antibody responses
by MZ B cells and the trafficking of antigen to the B-cell follicle
where development of slower adaptive immune responses take
place. Given the marked loss of MZ B cells induced by MCAO,
we next determined if these alterations led to impairments in key
MZ B-cell-dependent functions. At 2 day after MCAO we
assessed the ability of MZ B cells to capture model antigen
PE-anti-CD21 from the circulation. In the spleens of naı
¨ve or
sham-operated animals, PE-anti-CD21 was detected throughout
the
MZ
1 h
after
intravenous
(i.v.)
administration
and
co-localized with the MZ B-cell marker CD21/35 indicating
efficient capture. In contrast, there was almost a complete absence
of PE-anti-CD21 detected in the MZ after MCAO (Fig. 4a,c).
MZ B cells can regulate other cellular populations within the
MZ, including MZ macrophages, which also capture blood-borne
antigen. MZ B cells were previously shown as essential for MZ
macrophage expression of the c-type lectin SIGN-R1 (ref. 33).
SIGN-R1 recognises bacterial capsular polysaccharide and its
expression is important for protection against pneumococcal
infection34,35. No deficits in SIGN-R1 expression by MARCO þ
MZ macrophages were detected after MCAO despite the
depletion
of
the
MZ
B
cells
described
above
(Fig.
4b).
Furthermore,
MZ
macrophage-targeted
model
antigen,
dextran-FITC, was efficiently captured by MARCO þ
MZ
macrophages in naı
¨ve, sham and MCAO-operated animals 1 h
after injection (Supplementary Fig. 4) and was efficiently
trafficked to the FDC network by 24 h after i.v. administration
(Fig. 4d,e). These data demonstrate a loss of splenic MZ antigen
capture selectively affecting MZ B cells after MCAO.
Unstimulated MZ B cells work in synergy with splenic B1 B
cells to contribute to natural IgM in the circulation under normal
physiological conditions and within 24 h of stimulation give rise
to plasma MZ B cells secreting high levels of IgM. This early
T-independent antibody response is critical for early defence
against many bacterial and viral pathogens16. Circulating IgM
concentration was significantly lower after MCAO compared to
sham-operated controls (Fig. 4f). Previous studies have reported
that experimental stroke can cause spontaneous pneumonia and
bacteraemia2. In agreement, we detected high bacterial counts in
the lungs (Fig. 4g,i) and blood (Fig. 4h,j) of animals 1–7 days after
MCAO that were not present in sham-operated controls
suggesting opportunistic commensals as the most likely origin.
Together these data suggest that MZ B-cell loss after MCAO
causes impairments in immune functions critical for early anti-
bacterial defence, notably antigen capture and IgM production,
and that these are associated with spontaneous bacterial infection.
Suppressed circulating IgM concentrations in stroke patients.
To determine if innate-like B-cell functions could be affected in
patients after acute ischaemic stroke, IgM concentration was
measured in plasma samples from patients and paired controls
matched for age, sex and degree of atherosclerosis36. Plasma IgM
concentration was significantly lower in stroke patients at
admission (up to 12 h after onset of symptoms), 24 h and 5–7
days after stroke in comparison to controls (Fig. 5a). This profile
correlates with the extensive loss of MZ B cells and reduction in
circulating IgM observed at similar time points after experimental
stroke above. Infection in patients was diagnosed using available
clinical, radiological and laboratory data36. Three patients (3/37)
reported infection preceding stroke and were excluded from
subsequent analyses. Around a third (12/34) of patients were
diagnosed with infection in the 14 day following stroke, including
seven patients with pneumonia, which is similar to the incidence
described previously1,37. The majority of these infections (8/12)
occurred within the first 6 days after stroke onset. Minimum
plasma IgM concentration measured up to 7 day after stroke was

 significantly lower in patients who developed infection within the
first 2 weeks in comparison to those who did not (Fig. 5b). The
baseline characteristics of patients with or without infections, and
the matched controls, are shown in Supplementary Table 1. In
agreement with previous studies showing an association between
initial stroke severity and risk of infection, stroke severity
(NIHSS) on presentation was significantly higher in patients
who developed infection within the first 2 weeks after stroke
(Fig. 5c). We performed an exploratory analysis to further
assess the potential relationship among stroke severity, IgM
concentration and infection after stroke. This showed a trend
indicating that the majority of infections occurred in patients
with a combination of high stroke severity and low IgM
concentration (Fig. 5d). Thus, our data from both acute stroke

 T-cell function and bacterial infection after experimental stroke
and altered systemic catecholamine metabolite levels were
associated with infection and mortality in stroke patients2,38.
The effects of adrenergic signalling on B cells after stroke
are unknown, however the rapid effects of MCAO on B-cell
composition and function in the present study suggested
neural
signalling
as
a
plausible
underlying
mechanism.
The concentration of splenic noradrenaline was significantly
increased by 1 day after MCAO and remained elevated up to
5 day in comparison to sham-operated controls (Fig. 6a) whereas
adrenaline concentrations were unaltered (Fig. 6b). b2-adrenergic
receptor (b2-AR) surface protein expression was detected on both
MZ and follicular B cells with a significantly higher proportion of
MZ B cells expressing the receptor (Fig. 6c). This was despite a
small but significantly lower expression of Adrb2 on MZ B cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with Immgen expression data
(https://www.immgen.org/) although differences between gene
and surface protein abundance are not uncommon due to post-
transcriptional and post-translational modification including
regulation of protein trafficking and degradation39. Stimulation
of in vitro cultures of isolated splenocytes with noradrenaline
resulted
in
a
concentration-dependent
reduction
in
B-cell
viability with a greater reduction in viability of MZ B cells
(37%) than in follicular B cells (13%; Fig. 6d). These data are
consistent with our in vivo observations on lymphoid tissue
changes after MCAO where both MZ and follicular B cells
numbers are decreased but MZ B cells are affected to a greater
extent. The more prevalent surface protein expression of b2-AR
on MZ B cells may underlie this relatively greater sensitivity.
The b2-AR was also expressed on bone marrow B-cell
populations in a subset-specific profile (gating strategy presented
in
Supplementary
Fig.
2c).
The
proportion
of
B220 þ
CD23 þCD21 þ mature naı
¨ve recirculating and CD138 þB220 þ
CD21 � /lo plasma B-cells expressing the b2-AR was markedly
greater than B220 þCD23 �CD21 þ immature and CD138 þ
B220 �CD21 � /lo memory B cells where negligible expression
was apparent (Fig. 6e). Analysis of b2-AR expression on more
discrete subsets of bone marrow B-cells using a more extensive
antibody cocktail and alternative gating strategy showed the same
expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. 6). This suggests b2-AR
expression may be developmentally regulated with expression
induced upon B-cell maturation and down-regulated upon
differentiation to a long-lived, memory phenotype. The relevance
to stroke-related B-cell dysfunction was evident in the changes in
bone
marrow B-cell
subpopulations
after
MCAO.
Mature
recirculating subpopulations comprising naı
¨ve and plasma B
cells were significantly reduced, whereas immature B cells newly
differentiated from haematopoietic precursors and long-lived
memory B cells remained relatively unaffected (Fig. 6f,g). Thus,
the sensitivity of bone marrow, as well as splenic B cells, to
MCAO-induced loss corresponds with the pattern of b2-AR
expression across different subsets. These data also suggest that
the sustained loss of splenic B cells up to 5 day after MCAO is
unlikely due to deficits in cellular repopulation of lymphoid
tissues as the numbers of immature progenitor B cells in the bone
marrow were unaffected. In view of the similar effects of stroke on
IgM in patients and mice we assessed if human B cells expressed
b2-AR. b2-AR expression was detected on 85% of CD19 þ B cells
in blood from healthy volunteers (Fig. 6h,i) suggesting that
human
B
cells
could
be
similarly
sensitive
to
increased
catecholamine levels after stroke.

Figure 5 | Circulating IgM concentration is suppressed early after stroke
in patients. (a) Comparison of log-transformed plasma IgM concentrations
shows a significantly reduced mean IgM concentration in patients at
admission (up to 12 h after onset of stroke symptoms), 24 h and 5–7 days
after stroke in comparison to paired controls. To control for circadian
variation, stroke samples taken at admission and 24 h were compared to
paired admission controls, and stroke samples taken at 5–7 days were
compared to 09:00 hours paired controls (n ¼ 38). (b) Minimum IgM
concentration measured in the first 7 day after stroke, was significantly
lower in stroke patients who developed infection within 14 days after stroke
onset than in those who did not ( þ infection n ¼ 12, � infection n ¼ 23).
(c) Average stroke severity on presentation, as measured by National
Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was significantly higher in patients
who developed infection within 14 days post stroke in comparison to those

patients who develop infection within 14 day after stroke to have a
combination of higher stroke severity and low minimum IgM concentration.

 Blockade of b-adrenergic signalling prevents loss of MZ B cells.
We next determined if blocking b-AR signalling in vivo could
prevent the loss of MZ B cells induced by MCAO using the pan-
b-AR blocker, propranolol. Propranolol treatment resulted in
preservation of splenic architecture and retention of both MZ
and follicular B cells after MCAO in comparison to PBS-treated
mice (Fig. 7a). Quantification of immunolabelling confirmed a
significantly greater area of MZ B-cell labelling using multiple MZ

Figure 7 | Blockade of b�adrenergic signalling prevents loss of MZ B cells. To block b�adrenergic signalling, animals were treated with 30 mg kg � 1
propranolol or PBS vehicle control immediately before MCAO and again 4 h later and recovered for 2 days before analysis. (a) Immunolabelling of spleens
demonstrates propranolol treatment after MCAO preserves splenic architecture with organized B-cell follicles (blue, B220) and T-cell zones (green,
CD3).The preservation of MZ B cells after propranolol treatment can also be detected via CD1d (red), IgM (green) and CD21/35 (red) immunolabelling.
PBS-treated controls show loss of MZ and follicular B cells and disrupted microarchitecture after MCAO as described previously (Figs 1 and 2; PBS n ¼ 4,

 (Fig. 7d) and levels approximated those observed in sham-
operated mice described above (Fig. 4f). Propranolol treatment
significantly
reduced
bacterial
burden
in
comparison
to
PBS-treated controls (Fig. 7e). Protection of B-cell numbers in
propranolol-treated mice was mediated by prevention of MZ and
follicular B-cell death as determined by a reduction in MZ
(Fig. 7f,g) and follicular (Fig. 7f,h) B-cell immunolabelling
co-localisating with TUNEL in comparison to PBS-treated con-
trols. There was no significant effect of propranolol on infarct
volume although we did note a trend towards smaller infarcts in
propranolol-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a). However, the
extent of brain injury was comparable to that observed above
(Supplementary Fig. 1a) that induced severe splenic disruption
which was absent in propranolol-treated mice. Moreover, there
was no correlation between infarct volume and plasma IgM
concentration (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b) yet lung bacterial burden
inversely
correlated
with
plasma
IgM
concentration.
This
supports that rescue from severely suppressed levels of IgM in
propranolol-treated mice is associated with lower susceptibility to
infection (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Together, these data suggest
that propranolol can affect plasma IgM concentration indepen-
dently of the extent of primary brain injury and most likely
through preservation of splenic B-cell populations after MCAO,
notably MZ B cells, the major source of rapidly inducible IgM.
Collectively with in vitro findings above, these data show that
b-AR signalling mediates loss of MZ B cells and their innate-like
functions early after MCAO. Importantly, reversal of these
MCAO-induced impairments by b-AR blockade is associated
with reduced susceptibility to stroke-associated infection.
Discussion
The
data
presented
here
provide
compelling
evidence
of
neuroimmune driven disruption to innate-like B cells after stroke
and suggest these alterations as a novel mechanism contributing
to the infection-prone state induced by ischaemic stroke in
addition to previously described impairments in other immune
cell populations. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that anti-microbial function of innate-like B cells is affected by
stroke. Key findings include that (1) stroke induces marked loss of
splenic MZ B cells along with gross disruption to splenic
microarchitecture, (2) MZ B-cell capture of antigen is deficient
after stroke, (3) circulating IgM levels are suppressed after stroke
in mice and humans and lower IgM levels are evident in stroke
patients with infection and (4) b2-AR-mediated signalling drives
stroke-induced MZ B-cell loss and susceptibility to infection.
MZ B cells are one of several types of lymphocytes that display
innate-like attributes as reflected by their innate activation via
pattern recognition receptors, speed of responsiveness and
antigen polyreactivity, making them vital immune sentinels that
mediate
rapid
systemic
anti-microbial
immunity17,19.
The
depletion of MZ B cells as early as 24 h after MCAO results in
deficits in the ability to capture MZ B-cell-targeted antigen and a
high bacterial burden accumulates in the lungs over a similar
time-frame. This rapid loss of a cell population which is critical
for early anti-bacterial defence is highly relevant because of the
timing of infections after stroke. Indeed, almost all cases of
pneumonia occur within the first week, and half of these within 2
days1,4. Such an immediate window of susceptibility suggests that
deficiencies in innate or innate-like functions are important.
Previous studies have reported altered macrophage responses
early after stroke, however these have largely focussed on markers
of immunoregulatory phenotype or antigen presentation rather
than direct effector and microbicidal functions5,40–42. In addition
to their speed of response, MZ B cells are specialised to respond
to T-independent antigens that include polysaccharides of
encapsulated bacteria17. The bacterial strains causing early
onset pneumonia in stroke patients most frequently include the
encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphyloccocus aureus43–45. Loss of
splenic MZ B cells early after MCAO is therefore of particular
relevance to both the types of bacterial infection and when they
occur in stroke patients.
Splenic MZ B cells are a major source of IgM, particularly
during the early stages of infection16,46–49. Despite a high
bacterial burden in the lungs and blood after MCAO and hence
strong stimulus for antibody secretion, we found significantly
lower
levels
of
circulating
IgM.
IgM
is
also
produced
constitutively as ‘natural’ antibody by MZ B cells and B1 B
cells50. Lower IgM levels after MCAO may reflect a loss of
constitutive natural antibody production as well as impaired
infection-triggered production due to a lack of MZ B cells. IgM
has a short half-life (B12 h) thus the early reduction in IgM we
observed after MCAO is consistent with this rate of turnover51. In
agreement with the mouse data, which showed rapid and
sustained splenic MZ disruption, plasma IgM concentration was
also significantly reduced in patients as early as 24 h after stroke
and this was maintained up to the 5–7 days time point. Although
it is possible that individuals who subsequently have stroke could
have lower pre-existing IgM levels than those who do not, this is
an unlikely explanation given that paired controls were well
matched for age, sex and degree of atherosclerosis. A significantly
greater reduction in IgM concentration during the first week after
stroke was associated with infection, which was observed in one
third of patients. As described in previous studies, infection was
also associated with greater initial stroke severity4,12,52. Our data
are consistent with a recent study showing lower IgG levels in
stroke patients which was associated with bacterial infection,
however, these deficits were not associated with a B-cell-
dependent
mechanism53.
In
conjunction
with
our
mouse
MCAO data, it is reasonable to speculate that deficits in innate-
like B-cell function, including IgM production, could mediate the
effects of greater stroke severity on infection risk in patients.
However the precise mechanisms of reduced circulating IgM
concentrations leading to susceptibility to bacterial lung infection
still remain to be fully elucidated in the context of stroke. Our
exploratory analysis indicated a combination of greater stroke
severity and lower IgM may identify those individuals at
particularly high risk of infection although further studies are
warranted to address these links more definitively.
The loss of MZ B cells and suppression of circulating IgM
levels after MCAO were reversed by blockade of b-AR signalling
and this was accompanied by a significantly lower bacterial lung
burden. The spleen is directly innervated and our data showing
elevated splenic noradrenaline levels after MCAO are consistent
with previous studies reporting activation of sympathetic neural
circuits after MCAO and increased circulating catecholamines
(or metabolites of these) in stroke patients2,54. The expression of
the b2-AR across different B-cell subsets was previously unknown
and our data provide a rational explanation for the relatively
greater sensitivity of MZ B cells to depletion after MCAO.
Expression of the b2-AR on human B cells further supports their
sensitivity to similar neural signals as observed in mice. Of
particular note is that few immature B cells expressed the b2-AR
and this correlated with stable numbers in the bone marrow after
MCAO. Loss of specific splenic B-cell populationsis therefore
unlikely to be the result of impaired B-cell differentiation in bone
marrow and moreover highlights selective sensitivity of B cells at
different stages of development to neural signalling activated after
stroke. However we do not exclude that noradrenaline could also
act indirectly via an intermediate cell to affect B cells after
experimental stroke and the precise mechanisms of how brain

 ischaemia results in increased splenic noradrenaline remain to be
determined. We used propranolol simply as an experimental tool
to antagonise b2-AR signalling and it is likely that therapeutic
targeting of B cells themselves would provide a superior approach
clinically to target infection susceptibility given the potential
adverse effects of general b2-AR blockade. Nonetheless it is
relevant to note recent interest in re-evaluating the role of
b-blocker treatment in stroke patients55.
As noted above, our data implicate B-cell death as the terminal
mechanism responsible for their depletion after MCAO. b2-AR
activation on B cells has thus far only been studied in vitro and
reported effects vary dependent on other exogenous stimuli
included in culture56. Atrophy of lymphoid organs including the
spleen occurs after experimental stroke and is thought to reflect
general apoptosis of lymphocytes although effects on MZ B cells
specifically were unknown40. Previous studies have suggested that
surgical and/or anaesthetic stress could contribute to transient
immune alterations after MCAO57,58. However effects on MZ B
cells after MCAO were maintained out to 7 day and we observed
no alterations in cell death or splenic microarchitecture and did
not detect any bacterial growth in sham-operated mice. Thus, the
effects we describe are specific to the stroke-induced brain injury.
The disruption to systemic anti-microbial B-cell function after
stroke we describe here raises the possibility that interventions
directed at preventing these changes could be a novel strategy to
reduce infection risk and associated mortality/morbidity after
stroke. Currently, there are no treatments proven to reduce rates
of infection after stroke that improve clinical outcome, including
preventative antibiotic therapy. A recent study suggests this may
in part be due to ineffective prevention of pneumonia59–61.
Transiently augmenting systemic B-cell function, in particular
innate-like responses in the first few days after stroke, may offer
potential advantages to other approaches. Effects of B cells in the
brain during the acute phase of experimental stroke are
neuroprotective
and
limit

inflammation
suggesting the risk of exacerbating brain damage may be
relatively low for B-cell-targeted approaches62,63. The recent
discovery that auto-antibody production by B cells may promote

must
be
considered, however, these effects are likely greatly separated in
time and space from the role of anti-microbial innate-like B-cell
function relevant to infection control during the acute phase of
stroke64,65. Although increased risk of autoimmunity must
also be considered, a recent study showed that generally
attenuating stroke-induced immunosuppression increased levels
of CNS-specific autoantibodies but had no detrimental effect on
long-term outcome in mice66.
In conclusion, we propose that studies examining the effects of
B-cell-targeted approaches to preventing infection after stroke are
warranted and suggest that markers of systemic B-cell function,
as an adjunct to existing indicators, may have potential utility in
identifying stroke patients at particularly high risk of infection.
Methods
Animals. Male 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 J mice were purchased (Charles River
Laboratories, UK) and used in all experiments unless otherwise stated (Fig. 1h,i and
Supplementary Fig. 1 batch numbers 4,551, 4,848, 4,947; Figs 1a–g,2a–c,e–g,
3a–e,4f–j and 6a,b, Supplementary Fig. 3 batch number 5,461; Fig. 4a–e and
Supplementary Fig. 4 batch numbers 9,224, 9,225, 9,777, 9,778; Fig. 7 and
Supplementary Fig. 7 batch number 6,593 and Fig. 6c–e and Supplementary Figs 5
and 6, batch number unavailable). Ccr2RFP/ þ transgenic mice were used for flow
cytometric analysis of B-cell subsets after stroke (Figs 2d and 6f,g and
Supplementary Fig. 2) and have been previously described67. Breeding pairs of
Ccr2RFP/ þ reporter mice on a C57BL/6 J background were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories (ME, USA) and a colony was established in house. Mice were
maintained under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions and a standard 12 h
light/dark cycle with unrestricted access to food and water. Mice were housed in
individually ventilated cages in groups of up to 5 mice and were acclimatized for a
minimum of 1 week before procedures. All animal experiments were carried out
under the authority of a UK Home Office Project Licence in accordance with the
‘Animals (Scientific procedures) Act 1986’ and Directive 2010/63/EU and were
approved by both The Roslin Institute’s and the University of Edinburgh’s Animal
Welfare and Ethics Review Board. Experimental design, analysis and reporting
followed the ARRIVE guidelines (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines).
Experimental stroke model. MCAO was performed under isoflourane
anaesthesia (with O2 and N2O) by insertion of a 6-0 nylon monofilament with a
2-mm coated tip (210 mm diameter; Doccol, USA) through the external carotid
artery and advanced through the internal carotid artery to occlude the MCA. The
filament was withdrawn after 40 min to allow reperfusion, the neck wound sutured
and the animals recovered. Topical local anaesthetic (lidocaine/prilocaine) was
applied to the wound. For sham surgery, the filament was advanced to the MCA
and immediately retracted. Sham-operated animals remained anaesthetized for
40 min and recovered as above. Core body temperature was maintained at
37±0.5 �C throughout the procedure with a feedback controlled heating blanket
(Harvard Aparatus). Animals were recovered for 1–7 days then anaesthetized and
anti-coagulated (3.8% w/v tri-sodium citrate) cardiac blood samples were taken
followed by transcardiac perfusion with saline.
Assessment of infarct volume. Coronal cryosections (20 mm in thickness) were
cut at 400 mm intervals and stained with cresyl violet. Images were captured and
infarct area on each coronal section was measured using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.
nih.gov/ij/). Infarct volume was calculated by the sum of all areas multiplied by the
distance between each section. The volume of damage was corrected for oedema, as
calculated by subtracting the volume of the contralateral hemisphere from the
ipsilateral hemisphere and expressing the difference as a percentage of the
contralateral hemisphere, as previously described68.
Immunohistochemistry and analysis of spleens. Serial frozen sections of spleen
(6 mm in thickness) were cut on a cryostat, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min,
washed in 0.05% BSA in PBS and blocked using species-specific normal serum
(Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., PA, USA) according to secondary
antibody used. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Follicular B cells were detected using monoclonal antibody (mAb) B220
(2.5 mg ml � 1) to detect CD45R (Caltag, Towcester, UK), or mAB 11-26c.2a
(5 mg ml � 1) to detect IgD (Biolegend, London, UK). MZ B cells were detected
using mAb 1B1 (10 mg ml � 1) to detect CD1d (BD Biosciences, PharMingen,
Oxford, UK), or mAb Il/41 (2.5 mg ml � 1) to detect IgM (affymetrix eBioscience,
Hatfield, UK). MZ B cells and FDCs were visualised using mAb 7G6 (2.5 mg ml � 1)
to detect CR2/CR1 (CD21/CD35; BD Biosciences PharMingen). T cells were
detected using mAb 145-2C11 (5 mg ml � 1) conjugated to biotin to detect CD3
(affymetrix eBioscience). Splenic macrophage populations were visualised by
staining with F4/80 (1 mg ml � 1; clone BM8, Biolegend), MOMA-1 (5 mg ml � 1) to
detect CD169 (Siglec 1; clone 3D6.112, Biolegend), MARCO (5 mg ml � 1; clone
ED31, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK), or SIGN R1 (5 mg ml � 1; CD209, clone 22D1;
eBioscience). Splenic proteins BAFFR (Tnfsfr13c; 5 mg ml � 1) and CD40
(5 mg ml � 1) were detected using clone 7H22-E16 (Biolegend) and clone 3/23
(Thermo Fisher) respectively. Following the addition of primary antibody,
sections were washed in PBS–BSA and 2.5 mg ml � 1 of species-specific secondary
antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594 dyes or Alexa Fluor 647
fluorochromes (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK) were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Sections were washed in PBS–BSA and mounted in fluorescent
mounting medium (Dako, Cambridgeshire, UK) and images captured using a Zeiss
LSM5 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK).
Digital images were analysed using ImageJ software. All spleens from each
experimental group were analysed. From each spleen, two sections, 100 mm apart
were studied and on each section data from 4 individual areas of WP collected.
Fluorescent intensity thresholds were applied and the number of pixels of each
colour (black, red, green and yellow) were automatically counted as previously
described69 and used to determine the area of immunolabelling for each cell type.
To analyse MZ specific immunolabelling, a border was firstly drawn to separate the
MZ from the follicle using MZ macrophage or follicular B-cell immunolabelling as
a guide. The area of the WP was excluded and area of MZ zone specific
immunolabelling was determined as previous.
TUNEL labelling of cell death. Apoptotic TUNEL þ cells were measured using
the ApopTag Fluorescein Direct In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Merck Millipore,
Hertfordshire, UK) to detect DNA fragmentation according to the manufacturers
protocol along with B220 þ immunolabelling to distinguish the WP. In brief,
immunolabelling for B220 was performed as described above. Sections were then
fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS and post-fixed in ice-cold
ethanol: acetic acid (2:1). Sections were incubated in reaction mix containing
DIG-labelled dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 60 min. After
washing, fluorescein-conjugated anti-DIG was applied to sample, which was then
incubated in the dark for 30 min. Sections were washed and mounted in fluorescent

Flow cytometry. Mouse spleens were mechanically dissociated and bone marrow
obtained by flushing the femur and tibia from the left side in 5 ml PBS containing
0.1% BSA. Anti-coagulated venous blood was collected by venipuncture from
healthy human donors. Red blood cells were lysed and resulting single-cell
suspensions were used for flow cytometric analysis of B-cell populations and
b2-AR expression. Briefly, cell surface staining to allow the detection of B-cell
subpopulations was carried out using antibodies against CD45R (clone RA3-6B2;
Biolegend; 2.5 mg ml � 1), CD21/35 (CR1/2, clone 4E3; affymetrix eBioscience
1 mg ml � 1), CD23 (FceRII, clone B3B4; Bioloegend, 1.25 mg ml � 1), CD138
(syndecan-1, clone DL-101; Biolegend 5 mg ml � 1), CD43 (clone S11; Biolegend
1 mg ml � 1), CD93 (clone AA4.1; Biolegend 1 mg ml � 1), IgD (clone 11-26c.2a;
Biolegend 2.5 mg ml � 1), IgM (clone RMM1; Biolegend, 1 mg ml � 1) directly
conjugated to fluorochromes and purified antibody against b2-AR (clone R11E1;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Heidelberg, Germany, 1 mg ml � 1). Mouse cells were
incubated in anti-mouse CD16/32 (clone 93; Affymetrix eBioscience, 0.4 mg ml � 1)
and human cells in Human TruStain FcX (Fc receptor blocking solution,
Biolegend, 1/500) to block Fc receptors then primary antibody cocktails for 30 min
at room temperature. For b2-AR labelling, anti-b2-AR antibody was added for
30 min, cells washed in PBS then incubated with goat-anti-mouse antibody
conjugated to FITC (Poly 4053, Biolegend, 1 mg ml � 1) for 30 min. Cells were
washed again and then incubated in primary antibody cocktails. Flow cytometry
was performed on a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa and analysed by Summit
software (Dako). Lymphocytes were gated based on FSC and SSC and 20,000 cells
in this gate collected for each sample. Quantitative calibration with Countbright
absolute counting beads (Life Technologies Ltd) was used according to the
manufacturer’s protocol to obtain absolute numbers of each cell population.
Cell sorting and subset-specific qPCR analysis. Mouse spleens were
mechanically dissociated, red blood cells were lysed and resulting single-cell
suspensions were labelled to allow distinction of MZ and follicular B-cell subsets
using antibodies against CD45R (clone RA3-6B2; BD Biosciences) CD93 (clone
AA4.1; Biolegend), CD23 (clone B3B4; Biolegend) and CD21/35 (clone ebio8D9;
eBioscience) directly conjugated to fluorochromes. MZ and follicular B cells were
sorted on a FACS Aria Illu and immediately processed for RNA extraction using
the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. RNA
quantity was determined by Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Renfrew,
UK) and reverse-transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). qPCR was performed in a
Stratagene Mx3005P (Agilent Technologies) using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and primer pairs Adrb2-f 50-TTGCCAAGTTCGAG
CGACTA-30 and Adrb2-r 50-GATCCACTGCAATCACGCAC-30, Cd1d-f 50-CCA
GAGCCTTTGTGTACCAGT-30 and Cd1d-r 50-TTTTGCTGGGCTTCAGATT
GTC-30, and Actb primer kit from geNorm Reference Gene Selection Kit
(Primerdesign, Eastleigh, UK). qPCR cycles were performed as follows: hot-start
denaturation cycle 95 �C for 1 min, 40 cycles of amplification with 95 �C for 15 s,
60 �C for 30 s and 72 �C for 1 min. DCt (Ct of housekeeping gene, Actb, minus Ct of
gene of interest) was calculated for each B-cell subset. Data are expressed as a
reciprocal of this value.
Microarray. RNA was isolated from 1
4 spleens from sham-operated animals or
animals recovered from MCAO for 5 days using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Manchester, UK). RNA integrity and quality were verified using
Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA was
reverse-transcribed to cDNA, amplified and labelled using the Affymetrix terminal
labelling kit (Affymetrix,Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were hybridized to MoGene 1.0 ST chips (Affymetrix) using
GeneTitan Hybridisation, Wash and Stain kit for WT array plates (Affymetrix),
stained, and scanned by Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh, UK). Raw data (.cel)
files were normalized directly during import for analysis in Partek Genomics
Suite (Partek Inc, MO, USA.). Probesets were annotated using MoGene-1_0-st-v1
Probeset Annotations, Release 35. To determine which transcripts were changed
due to experimental stroke, normalized datasets were compared in Partek by
ANOVA. Enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology terms was performed in
DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) by uploading lists of differentially
expressed transcripts and selecting the GOTERM_BP_FAT annotation category.
Enrichment was assessed using default settings. Pathway analysis was also
performed in DAVID using the KEGG tool. Microarray data are deposited in the
NCBI GeoDatasets database with the accession number GSE70841.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA of 500 ng prepared for microarray (as above) was
reverse-transcribed using superscript III Reverse transcriptase (Life technologies)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was carried out on a Stratagene
Mx3005P instrument (Agilent Technologies) using Qiagen RT2 SYBR Green
Mastermix (Qiagen) and RT2 qPCR primer kits for Cr2, Cd40, Tnfsfr13c and
Gappdh (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR cycles were
performed as follows: hot-start denaturation cycle 95 �C for 10 min, 40 cycles of
amplification of 95 �C for 15 s and 60 �C for 1 min DCt (Ct of housekeeping gene,
Gapdh, minus Ct of gene of interest) was calculated for each sample. Data are
expressed as the normalised expression ratio (2( � DDCt)) in comparison to sham
samples.
Bacteriological analysis. Lungs were rinsed in sterile PBS and transferred to a
gentleMACS C Tube containing 1 ml sterile PBS and homogenized on a gentle-
MACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK). Lung homogenates and blood,
collected and prepared as described above, were serially diluted, plated onto
Columbia agar and horse blood (EOLabs, Bonnybridge, Scotland), incubated at
37 �C for 48 h and bacterial colonies counted.
Splenic marginal zone antigen capture. To assess the capture and transport of
antigen by MZ cells in vivo, naı
¨ve mice or mice recovered 48 h after sham
or MCAO, were administered either 20 mg of 3,000 kDa Dextran conjugated to
FITC (Sigma, Dorset, UK) or 1 mg antibody against CD21/35 conjugated to PE
(eBioscience) by intravenous injection. Spleens were removed either 1 h or
24 h after injection and the presence of MZ cell-associated or FDC-associated
fluorescent antigen was identified by immunohistochemistry as described above.
ELISA measurement of mouse plasma IgM and catecholamines. Plasma
samples prepared from mice recovered for 48 h after sham-operation or MCAO
were assayed using mouse Ready-Set-Go ELISA kits to detect IgM (affymetrix
eBioscience) and 2-Cat (A-N) research ELISA kits to measure noradrenaline and
adrenaline (LDN laboratory diagnostics, Nordhorn, Germany). Blood samples
obtained by cardiac puncture were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and
centrifuged at 1,000 g and supernatant plasma was collected. For measurement of
IgM, plasma was diluted 1/10,000 and ELISA carried out according to manu-
facturer’s instructions. For detection of noradrenaline and adrenaline, 50 ml of
spleen homogenate prepared from equal weights of spleen tissue was acylated,
enzymatically converted and catecholamines measured by ELISA according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Recruitment of stroke patients and plasma IgM measurement. Blood
from healthy volunteers was collected for the analysis of b-adrenergic receptor
expression under ethical approval obtained from the Lothian Research Ethics
Committee (11/AL/0168). The current analysis of stored samples from the stroke
patient and control cohort previously described9,36 was approved by the Health
Research Authority National Research and Ethics Service Committee (14/EM/
1117). Clinical evaluation of patients was as described previously and baseline
characteristics of patients and controls are described in Supplementary Table 1
(ref. 36). Briefly, patients over 18 years presenting at Salford Royal Hospital,
Salford, UK within 12 h of symptom onset of acute ischaemic stroke were eligible.
Patients were excluded if there was any improvement in symptoms since onset, the
time of onset of symptoms could not be reliably determined, or there was evidence
of active malignancy. Control subjects with no history of stroke or transient
ischaemic attack, without clinically evident infection necessitating medical
treatment, and without a history of cognitive impairment sufficient to interfere
with daily life were matched for age (± 5 years), sex and degree of atherosclerosis.
Written informed consent (or assent from a relative) was obtained for all patients
and control subjects. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
score70 was used to measure stroke severity at presentation. Infections occurring in
the 14 day after stroke onset were recorded prospectively during the study period
using all available clinical information and original investigation results. Patients
with infections preceding stroke onset were excluded from analysis. Venous blood
samples were collected from patients at admission (up to 12 h after the onset of
stroke symptoms), the next 09:00 hours time point where admission was before
07:00 or after 11:00 hours, 24 hours after admission, and 5–7 days at 09:00 hours.
Blood was also drawn from resting control subjects at 09:00 hours and at a time
matched to the patient’s time of admission if this was before 07:00 or after 11:00
hours. To control for circadian variations stroke patient samples taken at
admission and at 24 h were compared to admission-matched, paired controls,
whereas stroke patient samples taken at 5–7 days were compared to 09:00 hours
paired controls. Blood was collected into heparin-coated tubes and at 1 h after
collection centrifuged at 2,000 g for 30 min, at 4 �C. Plasma was separated, frozen
and stored at � 70 �C until analysis. IgM concentration was measured using
human Ready-Set-Go ELISA kits to detect IgM (Affymetrix eBioscience) according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
In vitro splenocyte stimulation with noradrenaline. Single-cell suspensions
were prepared from spleens from naı
¨ve C57Bl/6 J mice as above. Cells were
cultured in 96-well plates (5 � 106 cells per ml) in media optimized for B-cell
survival (RPMI, 1% L-Glutamate, 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 1%
penicillin-streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids and
0.1% b-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with 1, 10 or 100 nM of noradrenaline for
4 h (Sigma Aldrich). Cells were collected for flow cytometry labelling as above
using CD45R þ to identify B cells. Cell viability/ death was measured using an
Alexa Fluor 488-Annexin-V dead cell apoptosis kit (Life Technology Ltd.) based on

 labelling with propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V. Viable cells were negative for
both propidium iodide and annexin V labelling. At least three independent
experiments each comprising triplicate samples were performed for all in vitro
experiments.
In vivo blockade of b-adrenergic receptors. Treatment regimen was chosen
according to the literature2 to block b-adrenergic signalling pathways and not to
perform a pre-clinical study on the effect of b-blockers in stroke. (S)-( � )-
Propranolol hydrochloride (propranolol; Sigma Aldrich) (30 mg kg � 1) was
administered by i.p injection immediately before and 4 h after MCAO. An
equivalent volume of PBS was administered in vehicle-treated animals. Animals
were recovered for 2 d after MCAO and tissues collected as described above.
Experimental design and statistical analysis. Sample sizes were estimated from
pilot studies and previous data using power analysis or the resource equation
method. Animals were randomised to experimental groups (for example, time
point after MCAO, drug treatment) using a computer-based random number
generator (https://www.randomizer.org/) and drug treatments were administered
in a blinded manner. The assessor was unaware of allocation to experimental group
during analysis of outcome measures although no formal blinding procedures were
in place. Data are presented as mean±s.d. unless otherwise indicated. For normally
distributed data differences were tested using unpaired Student’s t-test or analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni or Tukey correction unless otherwise stated.
For non-normally distributed data, equivalent non-parametric tests were used and
results displayed as median±minimum and maximum values. Data analysis for
bacterial colonies after MCAO and IgM concentration in patient samples was on
log10-transformed values. For comparison of IgM concentration in stroke patients
with and without infection, minimum IgM concentration was defined as the lowest
value up to 7 day after stroke. Analysis of the relationship among stroke severity
(NIHSS score), IgM concentration and infection in stroke patients is observational
and for exploratory purposes only. Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism. In
all experiments values of Pr0.05 were accepted as statistically significant.
