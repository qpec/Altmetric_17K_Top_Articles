Imprinting and recalling
cortical ensembles
Luis Carrillo-Reid,* Weijian Yang, Yuki Bando, Darcy S. Peterka, Rafael Yuste
Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of neurons that may represent building
blocks of cortical circuits. These ensembles could be formed by Hebbian plasticity,
whereby synapses between coactive neurons are strengthened. Here we report
that repetitive activation with two-photon optogenetics of neuronal populations from
the visual cortex of awake mice builds neuronal ensembles that recur spontaneously
after being imprinted and do not disrupt preexisting ones. Moreover, imprinted
ensembles can be recalled by single-cell stimulation and remain coactive
on consecutive days. Our results demonstrate the persistent reconfiguration of
cortical circuits by two-photon optogenetics into neuronal ensembles that can perform
pattern completion.
C
ortical ensembles are groups of coactive
neurons evoked by sensory stimuli (1–3)
or motor behaviors (4–6) and likely con-
stitute emergent building blocks of cortical
function (7, 8). In the absence of ex-
ternal inputs, ongoing cortical ensembles re-
semble sensory evoked ones (9–11), as if the
cortex has an imprinted representation of the
world, implemented by groups of neurons
with strong synaptic connectivity. Ensembles
could result from Hebbian plasticity, whereby
the connectivity between coactive neurons be-
comes strengthened (12). Optogenetic studies
in which all expressing neurons and their axons
are simultaneously photostimulated have dem-
onstrated Hebbian plasticity (13). However,
the artificial generation of cortical ensembles
with single-cell resolution has so far been ex-
perimentally difficult.
To do so, we used simultaneous two-photon
calcium imaging and two-photon photostimu-
lation (14, 15) in the primary visual cortex of
head-fixed mice running on a treadmill. GCaMP6s
signals of layer 2/3 neurons were imaged through
a reinforced thinned-skull window, whereas
C1V1-expressing neurons were optogenetically
stimulated with a second two-photon laser (16)
(Fig. 1, A and B).
Two-photon photostimulation of a neuronal
population (fig. S1) evoked calcium transients reli-
ably in a specific subset of neurons (Fig. 1, C to E).
In vivo electrophysiological recordings demon-
strated that population photostimulation evoked
action potential bursts independently of the spatial
location of the neurons (fig. S1). Neurons respond-
ing to direct photostimulation were differentiated
from other active neurons and from photo-
stimulation light artifacts by their different tem-
poral responses (fig. S1). This enabled us to
distinguish photostimulated cells from those that
became active because of the effects of photo-
stimulation on the circuit.
Repeated optogenetic stimulation reliably re-
cruited specific groups of neurons, generating
an artificial “photoensemble” (i.e., a group of opti-
cally activated neurons). To quantify this, we used
multidimensional population vectors to analyze
population activity (17, 18) and found that photo-
ensembles activate different populations of neu-
rons than visual stimuli do (19), with only 20.17 ±
9.4% neurons in common (Fig. 2, A to D, and
fig. S2). Although the number of ensembles was
similar in both experimental conditions, photo-
ensembles activated more neurons than visu-
ally evoked ones (Fig. 2E). Neurons belonging
to photoensembles or visual ensembles had a
widespread spatial distribution and were spa-
tially intermingled (Fig. 2, F and G). Visual
ensembles remained stable after population
photostimulation (fig. S3), which indicates that
repetitive photostimulation did not disrupt pre-
existing cortical ensembles.
We noted that some photostimulated cells be-
came coactive spontaneously (see below), as if the
artificial photoensemble had been imprinted into
the cortex. Moreover, the activation of a single
cell was able to recall these imprinted ensembles
(Fig. 3A), demonstrating pattern completion.
Pattern completion (20) has been described in
the hippocampus (21–23) and is a property of
attractor neural networks (22, 24). Single-cell
activation before population photostimulation
did not produce considerable alterations of overall
network activity (Fig. 3, B, C, and D, left, and fig.

 single-cell photostimulation before and after
population training remained stable (Fig. 3E),
single-cell photostimulation after population
training reliably enabled the recall of a specific
group of neurons that was not coactive before;
this occurred 64.5 ± 12.63% of the time (Fig.
3E). The spatial location of neurons in recalled
ensembles had a broader distribution than the
occasional neurons that were indirectly activated
before population training (Fig. 3, F and G). Also,
after population training, the number of calcium
transients in nonphotostimulated neurons remained
constant whereas it increased in photostimulated
neurons (Fig. 4, A and B), ruling out the pos-
sibility that population photostimulation changed
the basal level of activity in the whole network.
This modification of the functional connectivity
between photostimulated neurons required a mi-
nimal number of trials (Fig. 4C), indicating that
the observed changes were driven by an altera-
tion in the circuit triggered by repeated photo-
stimulation of a specific population of neurons.
To investigate whether imprinted ensembles
were persistently integrated in ongoing cortical
activity, we imaged the same area on consec-
utive days. Single-cell photostimulation still en-
abled the recall of previously imprinted ensembles
on consecutive days (fig. S6). Our analysis of on-
going activity from nonphotostimulated (Fig. 4D,
left) and photostimulated neurons showed that
imprinted ensembles recurred spontaneously, even
on consecutive days and after additional popu-
lation photostimulation (Fig. 4D, right). Although

 cross-correlations between nonresponsive neu-
rons were not altered (Fig. 4E, left), they were
increased between photostimulated neurons and
remained stable the next day (Fig. 4E, right).
Thus, optogenetic activation of identified neu-
rons enhanced their local functional connections
for at least 1 day (Fig. 4F).
Recalled ensembles shared similar characteristics—
such as number of neurons and spatial distribution—
with ongoing ensembles (fig. S7), but the mean dis-
tance between active neurons was shorter (fig.
S7D), which indicates that the effect of the photo-
stimulation is local. Recalled ensembles often
had neurons that did not belong to ongoing en-
sembles (fig. S7, D and E), demonstrating that
recalled ensembles are indeed novel and not just
dormant preexisting ensembles. However, given
that cortical connections are likely not in a tabula
rasa state, we expect that imprinted ensembles
may recruit segments of physiologically relevant
circuit motifs (Fig. 4F).
Previously, electrical or optogenetic stimulation
(25) has been used to show that coactivation of
neuronal groups can produce physiologically
relevant behaviors (13, 26). Here, we show the
possibility of training individual neurons to build
artificial neuronal ensembles (13), which then
become spontaneously active (Fig. 4D, right). Our
results are consistent with the finding that neurons
responding to similar visual stimuli have a higher
interconnectivity (27), as well as with the similarity
between visually evoked and spontaneous en-
sembles (9). In both cases, recurrent coactivation
of a neuronal group would enhance functional
connectivity, imprinting ensembles into the
circuit.
More than 60 years ago, Hebb proposed that
repeated coactivation of a group of neurons
might create a memory trace through enhance-
ment of synaptic connections (12). Because of
technical limitations, this hypothesis has been
difficult to test with single-cell resolution in
awake animals. By combining novel imaging
and photostimulation techniques (14, 15) and
analytical tools (19), our work can be interpreted
as a confirmation of the Hebbian postulate and
as a demonstration that cortical microcircuits can
perform pattern completion.

ECONOMIC POLICY
The impact of homelessness
prevention programs
on homelessness
William N. Evans,1,2,3 James X. Sullivan,1,3* Melanie Wallskog4
Despite the prevalence of temporary financial assistance programs for those facing
imminent homelessness, there is little evidence of their impact. Using data from Chicago
from 2010 to 2012 (n = 4448), we demonstrate that the volatile nature of funding availability
leads to good-as-random variation in the allocation of resources to individuals seeking
assistance. To estimate impacts, we compare families that call when funds are available with
those who call when they are not. We find that those calling when funding is available are
76% less likely to enter a homeless shelter. The per-person cost of averting homelessness
through financial assistance is estimated as $10,300 and would be much less with better
targeting of benefits to lower-income callers. The estimated benefits, not including many
health benefits, exceed $20,000.
O
ver 2 million people experience homeless-
ness each year in the United States (1).
Historically, the primary approach to com-
bating homelessness has been to provide
emergency shelters or transitional hous-
ing services to those who are already homeless.
More recently, policy-makers have increased
their focus on homelessness prevention efforts.
One of the most common prevention strategies
is to provide temporary financial assistance to
people facing eviction in order to keep them in
their residences. In the United States, 93% of
households live in an area that has such a pro-
gram, and these programs receive over 15 million
calls a year (2). Despite the prevalence of these
efforts, there is little evidence about the extent to
which they actually prevent homelessness (3, 4).
Here we examine the effectiveness of tempo-
rary financial assistance by using data from the
Homelessness Prevention Call Center (HPCC)
in Chicago, which processes about 75,000 calls
annually. Chicago residents at risk of becoming
homeless can call 311 to request temporary fi-
nancial assistance for rent, security deposits, or
utility bills. These callers are routed to the HPCC,
which is a centralized processing center that
screens callers for eligibility and connects eli-
gible callers with local funding agencies.
