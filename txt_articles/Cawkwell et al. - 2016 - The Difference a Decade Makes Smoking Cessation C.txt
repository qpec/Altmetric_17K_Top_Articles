Abstract
Introduction: 
There has been a sharp decline in adolescents who smoke cigarettes but no national-
level study evaluating the impact of smoking cessation counseling by pediatricians or other clini-
cians who care for children.
Methods: Combined data from ambulatory portions of the National Hospital Ambulatory Care 
Survey and National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1997–1999 and 2009–2011 were ana-
lyzed to determine changes in the frequency of pediatric visits that included clinician-reported 
tobacco counseling and how such counseling varied by child, family, and clinician characteristics.
Results: In 1997–1999, 1.5% of all medical visits for children aged below 19 years included tobacco 
counseling; this increased to 3.8% in 2009–2011 (P < .001). A marked increase from 4.1% to 11.1% 
was noted at well-child visits (P < .001). There were significant increases in counseling by pediatri-
cians but not mid-level providers or general/family physicians. Provision of counseling did not result 
in greater visit length during either time point. During 2009–2011, visits with a diagnosis of asthma 
were four times as likely (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8–6.2) and visits for otitis media two times as likely (OR 
2.1, 95% CI 1.2–3.7) to include smoking cessation counseling than sick visits for all other diagnoses.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate a significant increase in tobacco counseling by pediatric 
providers within the last decade, especially at well-child visits. However, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics’ recommendation that pediatricians counsel about the harms of tobacco use and sec-
ondhand smoke exposure has not yet been exhaustively implemented.
Implications: A significant increase in smoking cessation counseling at pediatric medical appoint-
ments, especially at well-child visits, occurred from 2009–2011 compared with 1997–1999, par-
alleling a large decrease in smoking prevalence. These improvements in counseling rates have 
been predominantly noted for pediatricians but not mid-level providers or general practitioners. 
Counseling was not associated with increased visit lengths. Although improved counseling prac-
tices by pediatricians have been demonstrated, there is still room for improvement.

Introduction
According to the Surgeon General, 126 million US residents are 
exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS), 22% of whom are children 
under 18 years.1 An additional 10%–15% of children are exposed to 
prenatal smoke.2,3 Although many smokers are aware of the harm-
ful consequences of tobacco smoke to themselves and their families, 
they continue to smoke. There is no safe level or duration of SHS in 
children. Despite this, children are not only more likely to be exposed 
but also more susceptible to the effects of SHS than adults.4–6 Both 
prenatal and postnatal SHS exposure in children is associated with 
sudden infant death syndrome, otitis media (OM), asthma, cardio-
vascular effects, behavioral problems, respiratory problems, and 
increased cancer risk.1,7–16 Furthermore, childhood SHS exposure is 
associated with increased risk of tobacco initiation17–19 and symp-
toms of addiction in children who have never smoked.20 There has 
been a sharp decline in high school students who smoke cigarettes; 
among 12th-grade students, 30-day prevalence rates have declined 
from 37% in 1997 to 14% in 2014.21
There are many reasons for this decline in smoking rates. Some 
well-explored causes include increases in cigarette prices, restriction 
on marketing, mass media campaigns, and increases in knowledge of 
the harms of cigarettes, among others.22 The role of the pediatric cli-
nician in influencing these rates is not clearly defined on a population 
basis. Clinician screening and counseling for smoking cessation have 
been shown to increase smoking cessation among various groups 
of people.23–26 The American Academy of Pediatrics27 and the World 
Health Organization,28 as well as other organizations, have made 
recommendations to encourage clinician screening and counseling 
for smoking cessation. A recent US study assessing tobacco screening 
and assistance among 11- to 21-year olds at physician office visits 
found that clinicians screened for tobacco use at 74.2% of visits 
in 2010 (up from 71.5% in 2004), and 19.8% of individuals who 
screened positive for smoking received cessation assistance, includ-
ing counseling, prescriptions.29
Given this information, there is reason to believe that one impor-
tant driver of reduced smoking rates, including among women 
of childbearing age, is a potential increase in clinician counseling 
practices. It is known that in regard to adults, psychiatrists have 
almost doubled tobacco cessation counseling from 1993–1996 
to 2006–2010.30 Previously, one of the investigators of this study 
(MW) showed that in 1997–1999, clinicians counseled parents at 
remarkably low levels—only 1.5% of all visits included cessation 
counseling.31 These low levels held true across appointment type, 
regardless of whether the visit was a well-child appointment or an 
appointment with regard to illnesses known to be impacted by expo-
sure to SHS.31
Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) 
and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NHAMCS), we set out to examine how clinician tobacco counseling 
rates have changed from the 1997–1999 period to 2009–2011. We 
also examined how visit time is impacted by counseling. As new vari-
ables have been added to the dataset, we include additional analyses 
examining tobacco screening practices for 2009–2011.
Methods
The data analyzed in this study were obtained from the NAMCS 
and NHAMCS. The NAMCS is a national survey based on a sam-
ple of visits to nonfederal office-based physicians engaged in direct 
patient care. Each physician participating in the survey is randomly 
assigned a 1-week reporting period during which a variety of data 
are obtained, including patients’ demographic characteristics and 
symptoms, physicians’ diagnoses, medications ordered, services pro-
vided, and planned future treatments. It has been conducted annu-
ally since 1989. The NHAMCS is designed to collect data on the 
provision of ambulatory care services in hospital emergency and 
outpatient departments. The survey instrument used is the Patient 
Record form, with three versions—one for the emergency depart-
ment, one for outpatient departments, and one for ambulatory sur-
gery facilities. An assortment of data is collected, including many of 
the same variables in the NAMCS. A full description of the data col-
lected and methodology are available from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.32
Data were combined from the NAMCS and the outpatient por-
tion of the NHAMCS. To be included in the analyses, patients had 
to be less than 19 years of age and had to be seen by either a physi-
cian, nurse practitioner, or physician’s assistant. Data were combined 
for two time periods, 1997–1999 and 2009–2011. Similar types of 
office-based clinicians were sampled for the 1997–1999 and 2009–
2011 samples of the NAMCS, although for the 2009–2011 time-
frame, physicians and nonphysician practitioners were also included 
from an additional sampling frame of community health centers.
The variables examined were child age (categorized as 0–1, 2–4, 
5–12, and 13–18 years), race, ethnicity, insurance status and visit 
diagnosis, clinician type (physician or nurse practitioner/physician’s 
assistant), physician specialty (pediatrician, general/family physi-
cian, or other), time spent with physician, problem type (acute, rou-
tine chronic, flare of a chronic problem, surgical, or preventative), 
whether tobacco counseling was provided, and whether tobacco use 
was documented (2009–2011 time period only). For both time peri-
ods, counseling was documented by the medical provider checking a 
box for whichever health education/counseling services he/she pro-
vided, which can include “alcohol abuse counseling,” “tobacco use/
exposure,” “weight reduction,” and others. No further information 
is given about the length of the counseling provided or whether it 
was provided to the patient or parents. There is no further validation 
beyond physician self-report for the provision of counseling. Tobacco 
use is documented simply as “not current,” “current,” or “unknown.” 
Neither survey distinguishes primary care physicians from subspe-
cialists. Visit diagnosis was coded by International Classification of 
Diseases-9 code: asthma (493), OM (381, 382), and well-child (V20, 
V70). The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides 
imputed data for variables with high rates of missing data (race and 
ethnicity)—these estimates are used in our analyses.
All percentages in this study are weighted to reflect national 
estimates—a total of 71 224 individual observations were weighted. 
Independent predictors of tobacco counseling were determined with 
weighted logistic regression. Comparison of means was performed 
with the adjusted Wald test. Analyses were carried out using Stata 
Statistical Software (Release 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Results
From 1997 to 1999, 1.5% of medical visits for children less than 
19 years of age included tobacco counseling—this increased to 3.8% 
of visits between 2009 and 2011 (P < .001, Table 1). Statistically sig-
nificant increases across timepoints were seen by each age-group up 
to 12 years, for white but not black children and for both Hispanic 
and non-Hispanic children. Children were substantially more likely 
to receive counseling at well-child visits in the most recent time

period (11.1%) than in earlier years (4.1%, P < .001). In the 1997–
1999 time period, visits at which children were seen by a physician 
were less likely to include tobacco counseling (1.5%) than visits with 
a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant (4.1%). In contrast, in 
2009–2011, physicians and nurse practitioners/physician’s assistant 
provided counseling at 3.8%. A significant increase from 1.6% to 
5.1% (P < .001) was seen over time for visits that took examining 
care provided by clinicians specializing in pediatrics. The provision 
of counseling was not associated with a significant increase in time 
spent with physician at either timepoint (Table 2).
Overall, in 2009–2011, 86.5% of well-child visits included 
screening for tobacco use, while 11.1% included tobacco counseling 
(Table 3). There were significant differences by age-group for both 
counseling (P < .05) and screening (P < .005) at well-child visits. 
Children aged between 13 and 18 years were most likely to receive 
tobacco counseling (17.7%) but least likely to receive tobacco 
screening (78.1%). Multivariate logistic regression for factors inde-
pendently associated with counseling rates for the 2009–2011time 
period is presented in Table 4. Children seen at visits classified as 
“preventative care” were significantly more likely to receive coun-
seling compared with children seen at acute care visits (OR 5.6, 95%

CI 3.4–9.3), as were children seen by pediatric providers (OR 2.4, 
95% CI 1.4–4.1). Children with asthma were four times as likely 
(OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8–6.2) and children with OM two times as likely 
(OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–3.7) to receive smoking cessation counseling 
than children at sick visits with all other diagnoses. At well-child 
visits, 38.4% of children currently using tobacco received counseling 
compared with 21.6% at all other visit types (P = .21, Table 5).
Discussion
This study reveals a marked improvement in tobacco counseling at 
pediatric visits, especially at well-child visits (from 4.1% in 1997–
1999 to 11.1% in 2009–2011). While only 3.8% of all pediatric 
visits included tobacco counseling in the most recent years investi-
gated, this is a discernable improvement when compared with 1.5% 
of pediatric visits in 1997–1999. In bivariate analyses, there has been 
a marginal increase in counseling at visits for OM but no increase for 
children’s visits for asthma or for any other diagnosis. Multivariate 
analyses, however, reveal that in 2009–201l, visits where the child 
presented with asthma were four times more likely and OM two 
times more likely to include cessation counseling compared with vis-
its for other problems. Perhaps most notably, there were significant 
increases in counseling by pediatricians but not by mid-level provid-
ers or general/family physicians, and in contrast to 1997–1999, pedi-
atricians provided counseling more often than mid-level providers 
or general/family physicians in 2009–2011. This may reflect changes 
in pediatric residency program curricula; surveys of program direc-
tors support that from 2001 to 2010/2011 there was an increased 
focus on prevention of cigarette smoking in residency curricula.33,34 
Because mid-level practitioners were providing smoking cessation 
counseling at a much higher rate than clinicians in 1997–1999 
(4.1% vs. 1.5%), it could be stated that the large increase seen by 
pediatricians was simply catching up to what mid-level providers 
were already doing.
The present study is consistent with prior studies on pediatricians’ 
self-report of cessation counseling, ranging from 2% to 8%.31,35,36 
The reported counseling rate for visits of infants from birth to age 
one has greatly increased from 0.7% to 5.3% but should still be 
considered low, given the increased health risks of SHS exposure in 
the early years of life. Additionally, smoking cessation counseling in 
visits for OM continue to be rare, even though there is an extensive 
literature documenting the independent association between SHS 
and OM.37,38 Moreover, an increase in smoke-free homes is associ-
ated with decreased rates of clinical encounters for OM.39,40
It should be noted that there was no significant improvement 
in tobacco counseling at medical visits for black children or chil-
dren with a reported race of “other”(P = .12; P = .41, respec-
tively). However, significant improvements could be seen at visits 
for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic children (P < 0.01), with rates 
of counseling for Hispanic children only slightly lagging behind 
 
non-Hispanic children by 2011. The Healthy People 2020 objectives 
aim to increase screening for tobacco use by 10% in office-based 
and hospital ambulatory care settings and highlight disparities in 
receiving such screening by both race and ethnicity.41 Our findings 
confirm the need to improve tobacco cessation screening and coun-
seling, especially among racial minorities, and indicate that some 
progress may have been made in decreasing the gap in services by 
ethnicity.
Pediatricians have remarkably powerful positions in efforts to 
reduce parental smoking.42 Parents visit their child’s health care pro-
vider’s office much more frequently than that of their own primary 
care physician.43 Uninsured parents are disproportionally smokers, 
often do not have access to a primary care provider, but do have 
access to the health system through their children.44 Moreover, the 
number of uninsured working-age adults is far greater than the num-
ber of uninsured children.45 Pediatricians can provide counseling to 
expectant and current parents to quit, assist parents in continuing 
their tobacco cessation, counsel adolescents to prevent initiation of 
tobacco use, and counsel adolescents to quit using tobacco.44,46,47 
Successful intervention can add an average of 7 years to a parent’s 
life, improve their quality of life,48 and improve the health of other 
household members, including children.49
Smoking cessation counseling interventions are one of the 
most effective and cost-effective ways to reduce child exposure to 
SHS.50–54 The existing recommendations by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics and US Public Health Service advocate that all pediatric 
health care providers document tobacco use and SHS exposure at all 
clinical visits, educate families about the harms of tobacco use and 
SHS exposure, and provide the appropriate advice to help users quit 
with the help of pharmacotherapy, community cessation programs, 
and nicotine replacement products.27,55,56 Despite these recommenda-
tions, it is well-known that clinicians infrequently screen or counsel 
parental smokers about quitting.27,57 As demonstrated in Table 3, 
there is a large gap between screening and counseling rates at well-
child visits. Although most clinicians are aware of the potential 
benefits of smoking cessation counseling, there are a number of indi-
vidual- and system-level barriers to incorporating tobacco screen-
ing and counseling in the pediatric care setting. Many clinicians are 
ambivalent about raising such issues with their patients as a result of 
uncertainty about the effectiveness of counseling patients and their 
receptiveness to such strategies,58 even though they are comfortable 
doing so in adult health settings.52,59 They have also have cited lack 
of counseling skills and educational resources and stress as reasons 
why they do not routinely screen for or counsel regarding smok-
ing.60–64 Lack of time is often one of the most commonly given rea-
sons for not counseling on cessation.65,66 Although the present results 
do not show an increase in visit length, it has been shown that the 
effectiveness of counseling does increase with the session length.23
There are a number of potential limitations deserving of men-
tion. Both NAMCS and NHAMCS are cross-sectional surveys, and 
as such, inferences regarding causality cannot be made. Data rely on 
self-report by clinicians—it has been found that clinicians tend to 
overestimate the rate at which they counsel, and thus the actual rates 
of screening and counseling may be lower.67 These data do not ena-
ble us to separate out differential rates of counseling by primary care 
clinicians versus that of subspecialists. Further, potentially influential 
elements, such as socioeconomic factors, were not available in the 
datasets, and it is not at all clear why counseling did not increase sig-
nificantly among black families. There is some evidence in the adult 
literature that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status all impact 
the rates of tobacco cessation counseling by physicians.68 There were 
no available data to analyze the quality of the counseling interven-
tion or the time spent on counseling. Finally, these data represent an

individual visit and the provider may have screened and counseled 
for tobacco use at a visit in the recent past.
Great improvements have been made over the past decade 
in smoking cessation counseling in pediatric settings, especially 
at well-child visits. Further, rates of screening for tobacco use are 
approaching 90%, an achievement we believe truly deserving of 
commendation. Yet in light of persistent tobacco use by parents and 
the emerging epidemic of alternative tobacco product use among 
adolescents and young adults,69,70 it is essential to recognize that 
the battle is far from won. It is critical that pediatric practitioners 
continue to take an active role in guiding and educating smokers 
and embrace their role in the arena of tobacco use prevention and 
cessation.
