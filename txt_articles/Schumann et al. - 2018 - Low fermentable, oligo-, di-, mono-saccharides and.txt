ABSTRACT 
38 
The aim of this review was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the effects of low 
39 
FODMAP diet (LFD) on severity of symptoms, quality of life and safety in patients with 
40 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and the 
41 
Cochrane Library were screened through 19th January 2016. Randomized controlled trials 
42 
(RCTs) comparing LFD to other diets were included when assessed symptoms of IBS or 
43 
abdominal pain in patients with IBS. Safety, quality of life, anxiety, depression and effect on 
44 
gut microbiota were defined as secondary outcomes. Standardized mean differences (SMD) 
45 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Nine RCTs with a total of 596 subjects 
46 
were included. Three RCTs compared LFD to habitual diet, two RCTs provided all meals and 
47 
compared LFD to western diet, one RCT each compared LFD to a diet high in FODMAPs or 
48 
a sham diet and two RCTs to other diet recommendations for IBS. Meta-analysis revealed 
49 
significant group differences for LFD compared to other diets on gastrointestinal symptoms 
50 
(SMD=-0.62; 95%CI=-0.93 to -0.31; p=0.0001), abdominal pain (SMD=-0.50; 95%CI=-0.77 to 
51 
-0.22; p=0.008) and on health-related quality of life (SMD=0.36; 95%CI=0.10 to 0.62; 
52 
p=0.007). Three studies reported a significant reduction in luminal Bifidobacteria after LFD. 
53 
Adverse events were assessed in three RCTs only, no intervention-related adverse events 
54 
were reported. 
55 
Finally, this meta-analysis found evidence for short-term efficacy and safety of LFD in 
56 
patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However only preliminary recommendation for LFD 
57 
can be made until long term effects are investigated.

BACKGROUND 
61 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) describes a group of symptoms that include abdominal pain 
62 
or discomfort, and changes in bowel movement patterns and defecation. Although correlation 
63 
between pathophysiology and symptoms is lacking for most cases, patients experience 
64 
abdominal pain and a negative impact on quality of life. IBS is the most common functional 
65 
gastrointestinal (GI) [1]  and diagnosis of IBS is based on Rome criteria [2].  
66 
Although nearly 60 % of patients claim that certain foods trigger their symptoms, IBS patients 
67 
who eliminate those foods, often only find minor symptom improvements [3]. A novel 
68 
treatment option for IBS is the low Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides and Polyol 
69 
(FODMAP) diet which focuses on the restriction of fermentable, short-chain carbohydrates, 
70 
including galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (GOS, FOS), lactose (disaccharide), fructose 
71 
(monosaccharide) and sorbitol (polyol). These carbohydrates are poorly absorbed in the 
72 
small intestine which leads to an increased intestinal osmolality and causes gas production 
73 
due to their rapid fermentation and osmotic action [4]. Therefore, the mechanism behind the 
74 
low FODMAP diet lies in reducing the fermentable load and liquid volume delivered to the 
75 
colon, to reduce gas production and luminal distension associated with gastrointestinal 
76 
symptom relief in IBS patients [5]. Primary purpose of this study is to review and meta-
77 
analyze the effectiveness of such a diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal 
78 
symptoms in IBS patients, while the secondary goal is to determine the safety of the 
79 
treatment and the influence on the microbiome.  
80 
 
81 
METHODS 
82 
PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses [6] and the recommendations 
83 
of the Cochrane Collaboration [7] were followed.

Control 
98 
Habitual diet or standard dietary intervention. 
99 
Types of outcome measures 
100 
To be eligible, RCTs had to assess at least one primary outcome: 
101 
1. Severity of IBS-symptoms, measured by patient-rated scales, such as the Irritable Bowel 
102 
Syndrome – Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) [9], or any other validated scale.  
103 
2. Abdominal pain or discomfort measured through means such as a Numeric Rating Scale 
104 
(NRS).  
105 
Secondary outcomes included: 
106 
1. Quality of life or well-being measured by any generic or disease-specific validated scale 
107 
such as the (SF-36) [10] or (IBS-QOL) [11].   
108 
2. Anxiety or depression measured by any validated scale such as Hospital Anxiety and 
109 
Depression Scale (HADS) [12].  
110 
3. Analysis of gut microbiota. 
111 
4. Safety of the intervention assessed as number of patients with adverse events. 
112 
 
113 
Search methods 
114 
MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library, databases were searched from their 
115 
inception through 19th January 2017. The literature search was constructed around search 
116 
terms for “FODMAP” or “fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and 
117 
polyols” and search terms for “irritable bowel syndrome” or “IBS”. For PubMed, the following 
118 
search strategy was used: (“Irritable Bowel Syndrome”[MeSH] OR “Irritable bowel 
119 
syndrome”[Title/Abstract] OR “IBS”[Title/Abstract]) AND (“FODMAP”[Title/Abstract] OR 
120 
“FODMAPS”[Title/Abstract] 
OR

OR random[Title/Abstract] 
OR 
124 
randomly[Title/Abstract] OR trial[Title/Abstract] OR group[Title/Abstract]). The search 
125 
strategy was adapted for each database as necessary. 
126 
Abstracts identified during literature search were screened and potentially eligible articles 
127 
were read in full to determine whether they met eligibility criteria.  
128 
 
129 
Data extraction and management 
130 
Data on patients (e.g. age, diagnosis), methods (e.g. randomization, allocation concealment), 
131 
interventions (e.g. duration, administration of diet, dietary adherence), control interventions 
132 
(e.g. type, co-interventions, outcomes (e.g. outcome measures, assessment time points) and 
133 
results were extracted independently by two authors using an a-priori developed data

extraction form. Discrepancies were discussed with a third review author until consensus 
135 
was reached. If necessary, the study authors were contacted for additional information. 
136 
 
137 
Risk of bias in individual studies 
138 
Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the risk of bias tool proposed by the 
139 
Cochrane Collaboration [7]. This tool assesses risk of bias on the following domains: 
140 
selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and detection bias using 12 
141 
criteria. Risk of bias was assessed for each criterion as 1) low risk of bias, 2) unclear, 3) high 
142 
risk of bias. Discrepancies were discussed with a third review author until consensus was 
143 
reached. 
144 
 
145 
Data analysis 
146 
Assessment of effect size 
147 
If at least 2 studies assessing a specific outcome were available, meta-analyses were 
148 
conducted using Review Manager 5 software (Version 5.1, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, 
149 
Copenhagen) by a random effects model [10] using the generic inverse variance method. For 
150 
continuous outcomes, standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals 
151 
(CIs) were calculated as the difference in means between groups divided by the pooled 
152 
standard deviation (SD). SMDs were calculated as Hedge’s g using a standardized Excel 
153 
spreadsheet. For dependent samples (ie, crossover trials), the calculation was adapted for 
154 
intercorrelations between groups. Where no correlation was reported, it was estimated as 
155 
0.7. Where no SDs were available, they were calculated from standard errors, CIs, or t-
156 
values, or attempts were made to obtain the missing data from the trial authors by e-mail. A 
157 
negative SMD was defined to indicate beneficial effects of the low FODMAP diet compared 
158 
with the control intervention for all outcomes (eg, decreased gastrointestinal symptoms) 
159 
except for quality of life where a positive SMD was defined to indicate beneficial effects (ie, 
160 
increased quality of life). Cohen’s categories were used to evaluate the magnitude of the 
161 
overall effect size as follows: SMD of 0.2 to 0.5, small; SMD of 0.5 to 0.8, medium; and SMD 
162 
greater than 0.8, large effect sizes. 
163 
 
164 
Assessment of heterogeneity 
165 
The I2 statistics, a measure of how much variance between studies can be attributed to 
166 
differences between studies rather than chance, was used to analyze statistical 
167 
heterogeneity between studies. The magnitude of heterogeneity was categorized as I2=0-
168 
25%: low heterogeneity; I2=26-50%: moderate heterogeneity; I2=51-75%: substantial 
169 
heterogeneity; and I2=76-100%: considerable heterogeneity.[7, 13] The Chi2 test was used to 
170 
assess whether differences in results were compatible with chance alone. Given the low 
171

power of this test when only few studies or studies with low sample size are included in a 
172 
meta-analysis, a P-value ≤ 0.10 was regarded to indicate significant heterogeneity [7]. 
173 
 
174 
Sensitivity analyses 
175 
To test the robustness of significant results, sensitivity analyses were conducted for studies 
176 
with high versus low risk of bias at the following domains: selection bias (random sequence 
177 
generation and allocation concealment), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), 
178 
and attrition bias (incomplete outcome data). If present in the respective meta-analysis, 
179 
subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also used to explore possible reasons for statistical 
180 
heterogeneity. 
181 
 
182 
RESULTS 
183 
Literature search 
184 
The literature search retrieved 179 records, of which 113 non-duplicate records were 
185 
screened and 105 records were excluded because they did not use a RCT design and/or low 
186 
FODMAP diet was not an intervention. One further RCT was excluded as it used the low 
187 
FODMAP diet only to wash-out symptoms in the initial stage of the investigation on the 
188 
effects of diets high or low in gluten [14]. Nine full-text articles (RCTs) with a total of 596 
189 
subjects were finally included for qualitative analysis [15-23]. One randomized cross-over 
190 
trial was excluded from quantitative synthesis as data was not displayed as mean and SD 
191 
and further information from the authors could not be retrieved [24]. Of those, 561 patients 
192 
matched the intervention criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).

Study characteristics 
195 
Characteristics of the sample, interventions, outcome assessment and results are shown in 
196 
Table 1. 
197 
 
198 
Setting and participant characteristics 
199 
Of the 9 RCTs that were included, 1 originated from Australia [17], 1 from New Zealand [22],  
200 
2 from USA [16, 23], 1 from Canada,[18] and 4 from Europe [15, 19-21]. Patients were 
201 
recruited from gastroenterology clinics [15, 18, 20, 22, 23], internet announcements and/or 
202 
advertisement in newspapers [15-17, 22, 23], private dietetics  and tertiary pediatric 
203 
gastroenterological care [16]. Patients in all RCTs were diagnosed with IBS according to 
204 
Rome-III criteria, including subtypes with predominant symptoms of either diarrhea or 
205 
constipation, mixed/alternating symptoms or of unspecified type (IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M/A, 
206 
IBS-U), except for 2 RCTs that only included IBS-D and/or symptoms of bloating [20, 23]. 
207 
Patients’ age ranged from 7 years to 83 years with a median age of 39.5 years. Between

67% and 86% (median: 71.0 %) of patients in each study were female. McIntosh et al. [18] 
209 
and Eswaran et al. [23] were the only studies to specify further exclusion criteria such as the 
210 
use of antibiotics, intake of probiotics, stool bulking agents, narcotic analgesic and lactulose. 
211 
Patients were also excluded if on Paleolithic or gluten-free diet, low FODMAP or low 
212 
carbohydrate diet. 
213 
 
214 
Intervention characteristics  
215 
Two RCTs compared LFD to habitual diet [20, 22], one RCT compared it to a diet generally 
216 
recommended for IBS [15] and two studies provided all meals and compared LFD to western 
217 
diet (American/Australian) [16, 17]. One study compared LFD to a diet high in FODMAPs [18] 
218 
and one trial compared it to a sham diet [21]. One RCTs measured LFD up to usual diet 
219 
recommendations for IBS [15] and one RCT compared the LFD to modified NICE guidelines 
220 
[23]. In the 7 interventions that did not provide meals, dietary advice was given by an 
221 
experienced dietician.  
222 
 
223 
Outcome measures 
224 
Symptoms of IBS were assessed in all RCTs for gastrointestinal symptoms and pain using 
225 
Likert Scale [16], Visual Analogue Scale [14, 17], Numeric Rating Scale [23], GI Symptom 
226 
Rating Scale [20, 21], Adequate Relief Question [23] or Irritable Bowel Syndrome – Severity 
227 
Scoring System (IBS-SSS) [15, 18, 19, 21, 22]. Quality of life was assessed in 2 studies 
228 
using the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire [19, 21, 22]. 
229 
Anxiety was assessed in 2 RCTs using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety 
230 
subscale, HADS-A) [16] and the Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI). Depression was assessed 
231 
through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression subscale, HADS-D) in 1 RCT 
232 
[16]. While all RCTs reported short-term effects, no RCT reported long-term effects. Stool 
233 
microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling by 4 studies [16, 18, 20, 
234 
21].  
235 
 
236 
Risk of bias in individual studies  
237 
Risk of bias in individual studies is shown in figure 2. All studies reported adequate random 
238 
sequence generation, but five studies [15-17, 22, 23] did not report sufficient allocation 
239 
concealment and none of the studies used/reported adequate blinding of participants and 
240 
personnel. Blinding of outcome assessment was sufficient in three studies [18, 21, 23]. Low 
241 
risk was assessed for incomplete outcome data in all but one RCT [16]. Three RCTs were of 
242 
high risk [16, 17, 23] for suspected selective reporting. High risk had also to be considered 
243 
concerning other bias in two studies [22, 23].

Analysis of overall effect 
246 
Results of the meta-analysis are displayed in figures 3-5. 
247 
Primary outcomes  
248 
The meta-analysis revealed significant group differences for LFD compared to any control on 
249 
gastrointestinal symptoms (SMD=-0.62; 95%CI=-0.93 to -0.31; p=0.0001; heterogeneity: 
250 
I2=77 %; Chi2=29.95; P 0.0004), and abdominal pain (SMD=-0.50; 95%CI=-0.77 to -0.22; 
251 
p=0.008; heterogeneity: I2=63 %; Chi2=19.07; P 0.0004).  
252 
While one study found no difference between IBS-D and IBS-C patients [17], improvements 
253 
in IBS symptoms were less for patients with IBS-C in two studies [15, 19]. Investigating 
254 
mainly IBS-C subtypes, Chumpitazi et al. identified only 8 responders to the LFD out of 33 
255 
participants [16] while subjects of the remaining studies were primarily of IBS-D or IBS-M 
256 
type [15, 18, 20-23]. 
257 
 
258 
Secondary outcomes  
259 
Evidence was found for short-term effects of LFD compared to any control on health-related 
260 
quality of life (SMD=0.36; 95%CI=0.10 to 0.62; p=0.007; heterogeneity: I2=14%; Chi2=3.48; P 
261 
0.32). One RCT measured anxiety and depression with the HADS questionnaire, but no 
262 
significant differences were found in between groups.  
263 
Four of the included RCTs assessed gut bacteria via 16SrRNA-profiling. Staudacher et al. 
264 
demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal Bifidobacteria after 4 
265 
weeks of LFD [20, 21] but not when combined with probiotics [21]. In accordance, McIntosh 
266 
et al. found a decrease in Bifidobacteria after LFD. Chumpitazi et al. solely assessed 
267 
microbiota at baseline to identify potential responders and non-responders to the LFD 
268 
according to individual gut bacteria profiles and found responders to be enriched in microbes 
269 
from several taxa with a larger saccharolytic potential.   
270 
 
271 
Safety  
272 
Three studies provided safety-related data, assessed by adverse events [16, 20, 23]. 
273 
Chumpitazi et al. and Eswaran et al. reported the absence of adverse events [16, 23]. 
274 
Staudacher et al. reported four adverse events, two in the intervention group (bronchitis, 
275 
laryngitis) and two in the control group (exacerbation of asthma, pharyngitis) [20]. None of 
276 
these were considered related to the intervention.  
277 
 
278 
Sensitivity analysis 
279 
Results for gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal pain did not change when only RCTs 
280 
with low risk of selection bias, detection bias, or attrition bias were included; the effects were 
281 
thus judged to be robust against potential methodological bias. Effects for quality of life were 
282

robust against selection and attrition bias, but did not remain significant in sensitivity 
283 
analyses for detection bias. Assessment of publication bias was initially planned using funnel 
284 
plots generated by Review Manager software; however, as fewer than 10 studies were 
285 
included in each meta-analysis, funnel plots could not be analysed. 
286 
 
287 
DISCUSSION 
288 
Summary of evidence  
289 
In this systematic review of nine randomized trials significant evidence for short-term benefits 
290 
of diets low in FODMAPs was found for gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain and 
291 
quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, while no side effects were reported. 
292 
Effects were robust against potential methodological bias.  
293 
Despite the evidence supporting LFD efficacy, more than 25% of IBS subjects do not 
294 
improve on the diet [25]. This meta-analysis shows that adherence to LFD significantly 
295 
improves gastrointestinal symptoms. However, these improvements were investigated mostly 
296 
for patients with diarrhea predominant IBS type [15, 19]. Symptom relief for diarrhea-type IBS 
297 
is supposed to be due to osmotic changes. Constipation underlies different intestinal 
298 
mechanisms and has been associated with a lack of dietary fiber, although additional

fiber intake seems to be only moderately effective in idiopathic constipation [26]. The LFD 
300 
has been criticized for not providing sufficient sources of fiber, and further research is 
301 
required to look into effects on single subtypes as well as conjunctive therapies benefitting 
302 
constipation-type IBS. A  strong association of psychiatric disorders in 94% of IBS patients 
303 
could be found [27, 28]   and further studies should investigate anxiety and depression as 
304 
secondary outcomes.  
305 
One of the presumed mediators of the efficacy of a diet low in FODMAPs is the gut 
306 
microbiome [25] which is also suggested to be involved in the etiology of IBS and depression 
307 
[29, 30]. The potential benefits of Bifidobacteria in IBS has been indicated [31, 32] and 
308 
patients with IBS may have lower concentrations of luminal and mucosal Bifidobacteria [33]. 
309 
As the LFD seems to lower gut Bifidobacteria, further research should focus on this outcome. 
310 
 
311 
Agreements with prior systematic reviews 
312 
Only one prior systematic review has assessed the effects of a low FODMAP diet in IBS so 
313 
far. This review limited its assessment on two instruments, the IBS-SSS Symptom severity 
314 
Score and the IBS-QOL for IBS quality of life, and included 6 RCTs as well as 16 non-
315 
randomized trials [34]. In line with our more comprehensive review, this prior review found a 
316 
significant decrease in IBS-SSS score and improvement in IBS-QOL score in both RCTs and 
317 
non-randomized interventions. The findings of our review are also in line with a descriptive 
318 
review on LFD for IBS which considered 40 articles (31 original studies and 9 reviews) and 
319 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
10 
 
concluded that the LFD should be the first dietary approach in patients with IBS as they 
320 
found it not only improve symptoms but also to provide relative ease of implementation [35].  
321 
 
322 
External and internal validity 
323 
All studies used Rome criteria as a standard for eligibility, thus standardizing the results. 
324 
Overall, risk of bias of the included studies was unclear. Only three studies reported 
325 
adequate blinding of outcome assessment [18, 21] and a general high risk was found for 
326 
performance bias. Mainly patients from Europe, Australia, New Zealand and from North 
327 
America were included and female patients represented the majority of participants, thus the 
328 
findings might  be limited to geographical regions and might not be fully applicable to male 
329 
patients [36].  
330 
 
331 
Strengths and weaknesses 
332 
Strengths of this review include the comprehensive literature search and the assessment of 
333 
applicability of the results [37]. The primary limitation of this review is the limited overall 
334 
sample size and the methodological heterogeneity of the studies. Further, none of the 
335 
studies reported long-term effects, results of this review cannot be extrapolated for long term 
336 
effects. Results concerning gastrointestinal symptoms are based solely on subjective self-
337 
reported outcomes. It has to be considered, that the IBS-SSS may fail to detect changes in 
338 
patients with mild IBS scoring lower than 175 [9]. Most importantly, safety of the intervention 
339 
was insufficiently reported. Two unpublished studies were included which are according to 
340 
the study coordinators in the process of submitting for publication. The usefulness of 
341 
including unpublished trials is still under debate [7].  
342 
 
343 
Implications for further research 
344 
Further trials should develop programs that agree on an effective duration for gastrointestinal 
345 
symptom relief, suggested by the majority of research to occur within the first week of 
346 
adherence. While these effects seem to be due to osmotic changes, a stable adaption of gut 
347 
microbiota to dietary changes is suggested to take more time [38]. For a more detailed IBS 
348 
symptom assessment, the IBS Severity Scoring System is preferable and the IBS Quality of 
349 
Life measurement scale can be used to establish changes in health-related quality of life 
350 
[39]. Another drawback of this review resulted from partly insufficient reporting of trial 
351 
methodology, and authors of prospect research should improve the reporting of trials and 
352 
follow commonly accepted reporting guidelines (e.g. CONSORT) [40]. Moreover, it is 
353 
essential for further trials to survey dietary adherence, which is a driving factor for symptom 
354 
relief. The LFD requires intensive meal planning by the patients. In contrast to study 
355

interventions, the daily supply of patients with precooked meals is not feasible in terms of 
356 
time and costs in regular clinical practice. 
357 
 
358 
CONCLUSION 
359 
This meta-analysis found evidence that the low-FODMAP diet is effective to relieve 
360 
symptoms, and to improve quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Still, long-
361 
term outcomes and safety of low-FODMAP diets remain to be investigated. Further studies 
362 
are required to evaluate its long term effects on gut microbiota, cost effectiveness and 
363 
efficacy as compared to other modalities.
