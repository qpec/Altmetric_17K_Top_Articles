Abstract
Background: Previous work demonstrated that a soy-dairy protein blend (PB) prolongs hyperaminoacidemia and muscle
protein synthesis in young adults after resistance exercise.
Objective: We investigated the effect of PB in older adults. We hypothesized that PB would prolong hyperaminoacidemia,
enhancing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and muscle protein anabolism compared with a
whey protein isolate (WPI).
Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial studied men 55–75 y of age. Subjects consumed 30 g protein
from WPI or PB (25% soy, 25% whey, and 50% casein) 1 h after leg extension exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions at 70%
one-repetition maximum). Blood and muscle amino acid concentrations and basal and postexercise muscle protein
turnover were measured by using stable isotopic methods. Muscle mTORC1 signaling was assessed by immunoblotting.
Results: Both groups increased amino acid concentrations (P < 0.05) and mTORC1 signaling after protein ingestion
(P < 0.05). Postexercise fractional synthesis rate (FSR; P $ 0.05), fractional breakdown rate (FBR; P $ 0.05), and
net balance (P = 0.08) did not differ between groups. WPI increased FSR by 67% (mean 6 SEM: rest: 0.05% 6 0.01%;
postexercise: 0.09% 6 0.01%; P < 0.05), decreased FBR by 46% (rest: 0.17% 6 0.01%; postexercise: 0.09% 6 0.03%;
P < 0.05), and made net balance less negative (P < 0.05). PB ingestion did not increase FSR (rest: 0.07% 6 0.03%; postexercise:
0.09% 6 0.01%; P $ 0.05), tended to decrease FBR by 42% (rest: 0.25% 6 0.08%; postexercise: 0.15% 6 0.08%; P = 0.08),
and made net balance less negative (P < 0.05). Within-group percentage of change differences were not different between
groups for FSR, FBR, or net balance (P $ 0.05).
Conclusions: WPI and PB ingestion after exercise in older men induced similar responses in hyperaminoacidemia,
mTORC1 signaling, muscle protein synthesis, and breakdown. These data add new evidence for the use of whey or soy-
dairy PBs as targeted nutritional interventions to counteract sarcopenia. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01847261.

Introduction
As we age, reduced strength and muscle mass, also known as
sarcopenia, are predictors of early mortality (1). With the aging
of the baby boomer generation, the prevalence of sarcopenia will
increase. A sarcopenic population will add to the ever-increasing
health care costs as these older individuals will require enhanced
care from weakness, bedrest, and loss of independence. Addi-
tionally, reduced muscle mass and weakness increase the risk of
falls in older adults (1). A fall can lead to hospitalization and
placement in a care facility (2, 3).
Amino acid (AA)11/protein supplementation and resistance
exercise (RE) are well-studied interventions for maximizing
muscle protein synthesis in adults of all ages (4–10). Unfortu-
nately, these stimuli do not enhance muscle protein synthesis in
the elderly as robustly as in younger individuals. This phenom-
enon has been classified as anabolic resistance (11–15). Although

 the mechanism for anabolic resistance is unknown, evidence
suggests that a dose threshold must be reached for protein
supplementation to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthe-
sis in older individuals (16, 17). Current research suggests
that an intake <20 g protein is insufficient for maximal
stimulation of protein synthesis (18, 19). Therefore, any
supplement provided to older individuals should contain 20 g
protein at a minimum (20). Muscle protein breakdown is less
well studied, especially in older individuals. The fractional
breakdown rate increases after RE alone or exercise combined
with feeding (21–23). Therefore, protein synthesis must be
maximized to counteract these increases in protein breakdown
to shift protein metabolism into an anabolic state and reach a
positive net balance.
Adequate protein intake is only one aspect of using protein
supplementation as a tool to overcome anabolic resistance and
improve muscle protein turnover. The protein source is also
important because different protein sources contain different
compositions of amino acids (24, 25). In addition, certain
proteins vary in their digestion rates (26). Because activation of
skeletal muscle protein synthesis is contingent on the AAs being
taken up by the muscle from the blood, the overall length of
prolonged blood hyperaminoacidemia is crucial (27).
The most well-studied protein supplement, whey protein,
contains high levels of branched-chain AAs compared with other
protein sources. It is especially high in leucine, an AA demon-
strated to be responsible for activating protein synthesis (28).
Whey protein is a rapidly digested protein and thus results in a
rapid spike in blood AA concentrations (29). The other milk
protein, casein, has a slower digestion profile than whey. As a
result, casein prolongs hyperaminoacidemia longer than whey
protein. Although the increase in blood AAs after casein ingestion
does not reach the magnitude seen with whey ingestion, protein
synthesis is still activated postexercise (30, 31). Milk is not the
only protein source for postexercise supplementation. The plant
protein soy is also capable of stimulating muscle protein synthesis
(32). In addition, soy contains many antioxidants and is a good
alternative source of protein for those on a vegetarian diet (33).
Because whey, casein, and soy all have different AA profiles and
digestion rates, a blended protein supplement may potentially
provide the benefit of all 3 proteins (34).
A study using this soy-dairy protein blend (PB) supplement in
young adults demonstrated that the PB prolonged AA net
balance across the leg for #2 h postingestion compared with
only 20 min for the whey-only group (35). In addition, the PB
increased muscle protein synthesis for 4 h post ingestion
compared with 2 h for the whey-only group (34). This prolonged
stimulus may hold the key for improving skeletal muscle protein
anabolism and attenuating sarcopenia in older adults.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether soy-dairy
PB ingestion after RE in older adults promotes muscle protein
anabolism. We hypothesized that soy-dairy PB ingestion in older
adults after a bout of RE would prolong hyperaminoacidemia
and enhance muscle mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
1 (mTORC1) signaling and protein synthesis compared with a
single protein isolate. To test our hypothesis we conducted a
double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in men aged
55–75 y and compared the effects of whey protein isolate (WPI)
to a soy-dairy PB ingested 1 h after a bout of high-intensity RE.
Methods
Screening of participants. We recruited 20 healthy men aged 55–75 y
for this double-blind, randomized clinical trial (Figure 1). Participant
characteristics are shown in Table 1. The participants were recruited
through flyers, newspaper advertisements, and word of mouth. Partic-
ipants were required to be healthy, only recreationally active (no high-
intensity RE regimen), nonsmoking, and not currently using any protein
supplements. Participants were screened on 2 separate days at the
Institute for Translational Sciences-Clinical Research Center at the
University of Texas Medical Branch. Screening one included laboratory
tests (complete blood count with differential, liver and kidney function
tests, coagulation profile, fasting blood glucose, hepatitis B and C
screening, HIV test, thyroid stimulating hormone, lipid profile, urinal-
ysis, and drug screening), clinical history with physical examination and
one-repetition maximum (1RM) testing. The second screening included
a DXA scan (Hologic QDR 4500W) to measure lean and fat mass, an
additional 1RM test, and a cardiac stress test. The 1RM testing was
performed on a leg extension machine (Cybex-VR2). The repetition
maximum was considered the average of the heaviest weight lifted from
each of the 2 sessions. All participants provided written, informed
consent before enrollment in the study. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch
and is in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1983.

 Study design. The infusion protocol for this study was identical for
both groups (Supplemental Figure 1). Enrolled participants checked into
the Institute for Translational Sciences-Clinical Research Center at
;0600 on the day of the study. Participants were instructed to refrain
from exercise for $48 h before admission. Participants fasted for ;10 h
before beginning the infusion but were provided water ad libitum. The
participants were randomly assigned to ingest 30 g protein from a soy-
dairy PB (n = 9) or WPI beverage (n = 10) at 1 h post-RE. Random
assignment was achieved by using the nQuery software (version 3.0); a
random block size scheme was used to ensure nonpredictability and
interim balance. The rest period between biopsies 1 and 2 before RE was
designated as Rest. The 0- to 2-h time period after ingestion of the
supplement was designated as Early. The 2- to 4-h time period after
supplement ingestion was designated as Late, and the entire 4-h period
postingestion was classified as Entire.
Experimental protocol. The experimental protocol matched the
protocol as previously described (34). Briefly, on the morning of the
experiment we began the primed, constant infusion (;10 h) of L-[ring-13C6]
phenylalanine and L-[15N] phenylalanine (Sigma-Aldrich). The priming
dose for the labeled phenylalanine was 2 mmol/kg, and the infusion rate was
0.05 mmol � kg21 � min21 . Muscle biopsies were performed on the lateral
aspect of the vastus lateralis to determine the resting mixed muscle
fractional synthesis rate (FSR) at 2 h and 4 h after infusion initiation. After
the second biopsy, the participants were moved to a leg extension machine
(Cybex-VR2) for high-intensity RE consisting of 8 sets of 10 repetitions.
Sets 4 through 8 were performed at ;70% 1RM. Three additional muscle
biopsies were taken 1, 3, and 5 h after the completion of exercise (0, 2, and
4 h after supplement ingestion). The nutritional supplements were ingested
immediately after the 1-h postexercise biopsy. Muscle tissue was immedi-
ately blotted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 280�C until analysis.
Blood samples were collected during the resting (0, 120, 180, 185, 195,
205, 215, 225, 240 min) and postingestion (260, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100,
120, 140, 160, 180, 185, 195, 205, 215, 225, 240 min) periods (Figure 2) to
determine the blood L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrichment (see below)
and select AA concentrations. The infusion study concluded with the fifth
muscle biopsy, at which time the participants were fed a standard meal.
Protein beverage intervention. The protein beverages (PB or WPI)
were consumed 1 h after exercise. The beverages were dissolved in 300 mL
water and enriched (8%) with L-[ring-13C6] and L-[15N] phenylalanine to
maintain isotopic steady state in arterialized blood. The PB consisted of
30.5 g total protein (providing 2.7–8 g leucine) composed of 50%
protein from sodium caseinate, 25% protein from WPI, and 25%
protein from soy protein isolate. The WPI consisted of 30.4 g protein
(providing 3.26 g of leucine). Thirty grams of protein was chosen for both
supplements because it has been shown to be sufficient to stimulate
skeletal muscle protein synthesis in older subjects (17).
Blood and muscle amino acid concentrations. Concentrations of
phenylalanine and the branch-chained AAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine)
were measured in deproteinized whole blood by using gas chromatography–
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously described using an internal
standard solution (36, 37) for blood AA concentrations. The same free AA
concentrations were measured in mixed muscle with the use of GC-MS as
previously described by using an internal standard solution (37).
Measurement of lean mass. Lean mass was estimated using a DXA
scan (Hologic QDR 4500W). The CV for repeated measures of lean
tissue is <1%.
Measurement of plasma insulin. Plasma insulin concentrations were
measured with Human Insulin ELISA (EMD Millipore) according to the
manufacturer instructions. Measured time points were at baseline,
immediately after exercise, and at various times after ingestion of
protein.
Calculation of muscle protein synthesis. Muscle proteins and
intracellular free AAs were extracted from biopsy samples as previously
described (38). Bound muscle and intracellular free concentrations were
calculated with the internal standard method by using tracer enrichments
for L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine, L-[15N] phenylalanine and appropriate
internal standards (D3 leucine, 13C isoleucine, 13C valine, 15N phenyl-
alanine) via GC-MS (6890 Plus CG, 5973N MSD, 7683 autosampler;
Agilent Technologies) (36). Mixed-muscle protein-bound phenylalanine
enrichment was analyzed by GC-MS after protein hydrolysis and AA
extraction (39) by using the external standard curve approach (40). The
FSR of mixed-muscle proteins was calculated from the incorporation
rate of L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine into the mixed-muscle proteins and
the free-tissue phenylalanine enrichment by using the formula:

where DEp/t is the slope of the straight line that fits the protein-bound

interval encompassing the 2 biopsies, EM(1) and EM(2) are the mean
phenylalanine enrichments (tracer/tracee) in the free-muscle pool in 2
biopsies. The results are presented as %/h.
Calculation of muscle protein breakdown. Muscle protein fractional
breakdown rate (FBR) was measured with phenylalanine tracers by using
the precursor-product method as previously described (21, 37). To
measure FBR at baseline, the L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine enrichment at
4 h was used as the plateau enrichment and L-[15N] phenylalanine
enrichment at 4 h was used for the 1-h decay enrichment. FBR was
calculated by using the formula:
FBR ¼ DEM

where EA(t) and EM(t) are the arterialized and muscle free enrichments at
time t. P = EM/(EA 2 EM) at plateau, and EA and EM are enrichments in
the arterial pool and muscle intracellular pool, respectively, and QM/T is
the ratio of free to bound phenylalanine in muscle.
Calculation of net protein balance. Net protein balance was calcu-
lated as FSR 2 FBR for each group during the Rest and Late periods. The
Late FBR constituted 3–4 h after supplement ingestion. Late FSR
constituted 2–4 h after protein ingestion.
Western blot analysis. Muscle tissue samples were immediately quick-
frozen in liquid nitrogen after the biopsy and kept in liquid nitrogen until
analyzed. Phosphorylation of mTOR, 4-E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1),
S6K1, and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) was measured by using Western
blot techniques as previously described (34, 38). The following rabbit
polyclonal primary antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used: mTOR
(Ser2448), S6K1 (Thr389), 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), and rpS6 (Ser240/
244). Blots were incubated with secondary antibody (Amersham
Bioscience) and washed, and then a chemiluminescent solution (ECL
plus; Amersham BioSciences) was administered. Optical density mea-
surements were then obtained with a digital imager (Bio-Rad) so that a
densitometric analysis (Quantity One software, version 4.5.2; Bio-Rad)
could be performed. All data are expressed relative to an internal control
sample.
Statistical analysis. All values are expressed as means 6 SEMs. Data
were transformed by using the Box-Cox set of transformations to
stabilize the variance and make the data approximately normally
distributed. To test differences between groups, the data were modeled

 by using an ANCOVA model with resting or baseline values and age as
covariates. The testing of differences was conducted through a t test of
the variable indicating the difference between groups. Comparisons with
resting values were based on testing contrasts across time by using a
mixed model with the subject as a random intercept term and age as a
covariate. AUC was calculated by using the AUC function in the flux
package in R; the function uses the trapezoidal rule to do the calculation.
Significance was set at P < 0.05. All calculations were done in R (41).
Results
Subject characteristics. Descriptive characteristics for all
subjects are shown in Table 1. The participants had similar lean
mass, percentage of body fat, and 1RM values. Men in the WPI
group were older than those in the PB group (P < 0.05).
Insulin concentrations. Plasma insulin was elevated for both
treatment groups from Rest (P < 0.05) beginning at 20 min
postingestion. WPI remained elevated until 150 min post-
ingestion, whereas PB was elevated until 100 min postingestion
(Supplemental Figure 2). There was no difference (P $ 0.05)
between groups for AUC (Supplemental Figure 3).
Blood and muscle AA concentrations. Blood concentrations
for valine (Figure 2A) were elevated from Rest (P < 0.05) for
both treatment groups for the entire treatment period post-
ingestion with no difference between groups. Valine intracellular
muscle concentrations were elevated in both groups for the Early
period compared with Rest, (P < 0.05, Figure 2B). Isoleucine
concentrations in the blood were elevated from Rest (P < 0.05)
for both treatment groups for the entire treatment period
postingestion with the concentration greater at all time points
for WPI > PB (P < 0.05, Figure 2C). Both groups had
significantly reduced muscle isoleucine concentrations at 1 h
postexercise compared with baseline, but these concentrations
were significantly increased 2 h postingestion (P < 0.05, Figure
2D). Blood concentrations for leucine were elevated from Rest
(P < 0.05) for both treatment groups for the entire treatment
period postingestion with no difference between groups (Figure
2E). There was no difference between groups for AUC for blood
leucine concentrations (Supplemental Figure 4). Leucine intra-
cellular muscle concentrations were reduced compared with
baseline in both groups 1 h post-RE bout, but they were significantly
elevated for both the Early and Late periods compared with Rest
(P < 0.05, Figure 2F). Blood phenylalanine concentrations were
elevated in both groups up to 205 min postingestion with no
difference between groups (P < 0.05, Figure 2G). Phenylalanine
intracellular muscle concentrations were elevated in both groups
for the Early period compared with Rest (P < 0.05, Figure 2H).
Muscle mTORC1 signaling. The phosphorylation of mTORC1
(Ser2448) showed no treatment difference between groups at 2 h
(P $ 0.05) or 4 h postingestion (P $ 0.05). Phosphorylation was
significantly increased at both 2 h and 4 h postingestion (P < 0.01)
for WPI as well as PB at 2 h (P < 0.05) and 4 h (P < 0.05)
compared with baseline (Figure 3A). There was no treatment
difference between groups at 2 h (P $ 0.05) or 4 h (P $ 0.05)
postingestion for S6K1 (Thr389) phosphorylation. Phosphoryla-
tion was elevated at 2 h postingestion in both groups (P < 0.05).
At 4 h postingestion, S6K1 phosphorylation in the WPI group was
significantly reduced (P < 0.05) from the 2-h time point but did
not differ from baseline (Figure 3B). There was no treatment
difference between groups at 2 h (P $ 0.05) or 4 h (P $ 0.05)
postingestion for 4E-BP1 (Thr37/42) phosphorylation. 4E-BP1
phosphorylation showed a significant increase only at 2 h (P < 0.05)
in the WPI group. (Figure 3C). Lastly, there was no treatment
difference between groups at 2 h (P $ 0.05) or 4 h (P $ 0.05)
postingestion for rpS6 (Ser240/244) phosphorylation. Phos-
phorylation was significantly increased at both 2 h (P < 0.05) and
4 h (P < 0.05) postingestion in WPI and at 2 h (P < 0.05) and 4 h
(P < 0.05) for PB compared with baseline. (Figure 3D).
FSR. No treatment difference existed postingestion for the Early
period (P $ 0.05), Late period (P $ 0.05), or Entire period
(P $ 0.05). There was a difference between groups at Rest (P < 0.05)
for muscle protein synthesis. The PB group had a higher baseline
synthesis rate than the WPI group. Early FSR was elevated from
Rest by 67% in the WPI group (P < 0.05) as well as by 50% during
the Entire period (P < 0.05) (Figure 4). FSR did not increase in the
PB group between Rest and the Early period (P $ 0.05). Similarly,
FSR did not increase between Rest and the Entire period (P $ 0.05).
There was no difference (P $ 0.05) between groups for percentage of
change from Rest to Early, Late, or Entire.

 FBR. There was no difference between groups in muscle protein
breakdown at preingestion (P $ 0.05) or postingestion (P $ 0.05).
The WPI group showed a significant 46% reduction in FBR during
the final hour of the treatment period compared with the baseline
breakdown measure (P < 0.05), whereas there was only a tendency
for FBR to decrease by 42% in the PB group (P = 0.08). There
was no difference between groups for percentage of change from
before protein ingestion to after protein ingestion (P $ 0.05)
(Supplemental Figure 5).
Net protein balance. The WPI and the PB group both showed a
significant change in net protein balance during the final hour of
the Treatment period compared with the Rest period (P < 0.05)
resulting in a less-negative protein balance after protein inges-
tion. There was no difference between groups at either time
point, Rest (P $ 0.05) or Late (P = 0.08). There was no
difference between groups for percent change from Rest to Late
(P $ 0.05) (Supplemental Figure 6).

Discussion
The stimulation of muscle protein synthesis that RE and/or
protein supplementation must provide to overcome anabolic
resistance in older populations has become a major focus in the
field of sarcopenia. Feeding alone can be effective in increasing
muscle protein synthesis in older populations with the proper
dosage. Cuthbertson et al. (11) showed a significant increase in
FSR #3.5 h postingestion using 10–20 g essential AAs (EAAs).
Similarly, Katsanos et al. (17) saw a marked increase in FSR in
older subjects after ingestion of 6.7 g EAA beverage containing
2.8 g leucine. This was the equivalent leucine concentration
of a 25- to 30-g protein supplement. Moore et al. (16) also
demonstrated a need for greater protein intake for stimulating
myofibrillar protein synthesis in older compared with younger
subjects in a retrospective study, with older subjects requiring

Unlike feeding, RE alone typically does not promote a robust
increase in skeletal muscle protein synthesis in older adults.
Using RE, Fry et al. (14) were unable to induce an increase in
FSR in older adults that was shown in younger adults after 8 sets
of 10 leg extensions at 70% 1RM. Kumar et al. (15) saw a
similar disparity between young and old subjects after RE alone
and concomitant increases in FSR. Conversely, Kumar et al. (42)
did find an increase in myofibrillar protein synthesis for older
adults with RE alone when exercise volume was doubled while
intensity was held constant.
It would appear that the key factor for promoting skeletal
muscle protein synthesis is the leucine concentration in the
supplement (9, 17, 28). In older adults, Katsanos et al. (17)
showed that 2.8 g leucine was necessary to increase FSR,
whereas a 1.7-g leucine dose was insufficient, even when the
total EAAs in the beverage remained constant. Bukhari et al.
(43) demonstrated significant elevations in muscle protein
synthesis in older women using a 3-g EAA beverage containing
1.2 g leucine in combination with RE. The study by Katsanos
et al. (17), along with that of Moore et al. (16) cited above, offers
further evidence that body mass may play an integral role in
protein and leucine dosage in older individuals. The mean lean
body mass for subjects in the study by Bukhari et al. (43) was
only 40.5 kg compared with ;53.5 kg for the study by Katsanos
et al. (17). This weight discrepancy may explain the increases in
muscle protein synthesis after ingestion of 1.2 g leucine in one
study not seen with 1.7 g in the other study.
The 2 groups in this study, WPI and PB, were not matched for
leucine content. The WPI group received 3.26 g leucine whereas
the PB received 2.78 g. Although the 2 groups did not ingest
equal amounts of leucine, according to the work of Katsanos
et al. (17), both groups received enough leucine to exceed the
minimum threshold to shift protein turnover into an anabolic
state. Similarly Mitchell et al. (44) demonstrated an increase in
myofibrillar FSR for middle-aged subjects consuming either
whey protein alone or a whole-milk (20% whey, 80% casein)
supplement with the whole-milk group receiving a smaller
leucine dose than the whey protein group.
For the first primary outcome, there was no difference
between groups for either blood leucine concentrations or AUC
measurements after supplement ingestion. Therefore, leucine
availability was comparable for both the WPI group and the PB
group. Interestingly, previous work has shown a pronounced
and prolonged hyperaminoacidemia in older adults after inges-
tion of protein or AAs (45), which may have contributed to the
similar hyperaminoacidemia between groups found in our study.
The sustained availability of AAs in the blood past 2 h for
both groups may explain the increased anabolic signaling
through the mTORC1 signaling pathway at 2–4 h postingestion
of the supplement. This hyperaminoacidemia is vital for
stimulating anabolic signaling in older individuals. Fry et al.
(14) showed no increase in mTORC1 signaling or muscle
protein synthesis after RE alone in older adults. We found for
our second primary outcome that mTORC1 and its downstream
targets rpS6 and S6K1 were similarly phosphorylated after
supplementation for both groups. Thus both groups activated
skeletal muscle mTORC1 signaling in response to exercise and
protein ingestion.
Although both hyperaminoacidemia and mTORC1 signaling
were similarly elevated between groups, only the WPI group
showed a statistically significant increase in FSR, our third
primary outcome, during the Early period (P < 0.05). This may
have been because of the potentially superior ability of fast-
acting whey protein compared with a PB to stimulate muscle
protein synthesis in older adults. Yet there was no difference in
FSR between groups. The PB group had a higher baseline FSR
value and therefore did not show a statistically significant
increase during the Early period. A large variance within the
baseline measures for PB prevented a significant increase in FSR
during the Early period. Still, considering the similarities
between groups in AA concentrations, cell signaling, and overall
FSR during the Early, Late, and Entire periods, it is possible to
speculate that the PB group would have matched the WPI group
during the Early period if not for a few unexplained high values
during the baseline period.
Protein turnover is not only governed by changes in muscle
protein synthesis. Muscle protein breakdown may serve an
important role in controlling muscle accretion or atrophy (46).
Some studies have shown an increase in FBR after exercise but
then an attenuation after feeding in younger adults (5, 6).
Research on FBR in older adults is not as comprehensive. One
study showed no change in FBR in older adults after RE alone
between baseline and 24 h after exercise (21). This study
measured protein breakdown both during the rest period and
the treatment period. Protein supplementation resulted in an
attenuation of the increase in FBR, a secondary outcome
measure, which is commonly observed after RE. WPI yielded
a significant decrease in FBR with only a trend for a de-
crease in the PB group (P = 0.08). This attenuation resulted in
a shift toward a less negative net protein balance (Supplemental
Figure 6).
There are a few limitations to our study. First, we included
only men. Although sex differences are not apparent in younger
populations for mTORC1 signaling and muscle protein synthe-
sis after RE, we cannot make any inferences on the potential sex
differences in older populations when combining RE with a PB
(47). Second, our randomization procedure resulted in subjects
in the PB group being slightly younger. This may have contrib-
uted to the tendency for baseline FSR values to be higher in this
group. However, as mentioned previously, the primary factor for
not detecting a significant increase in FSR in this group was most
likely due to a few subjects with high basal FSR values. In fact, in
the PB group 7 of the 9 subjects had an increase in FSR after
exercise and protein ingestion.
The precursor-product method used for measuring skeletal
muscle protein breakdown in this study has four assumptions
that must be met for the FBR equation to be valid: 1) isotopic
steady state must be maintained, 2) inward transport and
protein breakdown are constant over time, 3) the only source of
tracer is from arterialized blood, and 4) the intramuscular free
AA pool size is constant. First, as shown in Supplemental Figure
7, the L-[15N] phenylalanine tracer enrichment was in a steady
state condition at both time points before termination of the
tracer. After tracer cessation, both groups experienced a similar
loss of tracer enrichment, and there was no difference between
groups at any time point for L-[15N] phenylalanine tracer
enrichment. Second, in our study we were unable to measure
inward transport because we did not use femoral catheters.
However, in our previous study in which we compared these
supplements in young men (35), inward transport rates were not
significantly different from rest during the 3–4 h after ingestion.
Although this may be different in older adults, our earlier data
would suggest that inward transport rates returned to resting
levels during the time period when we measured FBR for the
current study. Third, the contribution of tracer from a source
other than arterialized blood is minimal. The protein-bound

 enrichment was negligible relative to the blood enrichment
because it reached a maximum of ;0.05%, i.e., 3 orders of
magnitude smaller than the blood phenylalanine enrichment
(typically 8–10%) (Supplemental Figure 8). Fourth, the data
in Figure 2 show that intramuscular phenylalanine concentra-
tions had returned to postprandial concentrations by the
muscle biopsy at 4 h after ingestion. This suggests that during
our postprandial FBR measurement (i.e., 3–4 h after protein
ingestion), the intramuscular pool size remained constant. In
summary, all assumptions of the FBR model have been met for
measuring protein breakdown rates during the postprandial
period, and all relevant data for validation of these model
assumptions have been included in Figure 2 and Supplemental
Figures 5–8.
For our net protein balance results, we used the 2- to 4-h time
point (Late period) for FSR in the net balance equation because
the FBR measurement occurred during the 3- to 4-h time point
after ingestion. Although these time points do not match exactly,
they do overlap and thus provide an opportunity to determine
net protein balance over the final hour of the study period. We
believe that net protein balance remained negative in this study
after both RE and protein supplementation because of the timing
of the measurement (i.e., FSR peaked during the Early period
and returned to baseline values during the Late period). Thus,
net protein balance during the first hour after protein ingestion
was most likely positive.
In summary, WPI ingestion after exercise increased FSR and
reduced FBR, resulting in a less-negative net protein balance. PB
ingestion after exercise did not significantly increase FSR and
tended to decrease FBR; however, this combination caused net
balance to become less negative. This resulted in no differences
between groups postexercise for FSR, FBR, or net balance. We
conclude that protein supplementation, whether a single protein
isolate or a PB, enhances mTORC1 signaling and muscle protein
anabolism in older men after RE.
