ABSTRACT: Introduction: X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM),
characterized by severe hypotonia, weakness, respiratory distress,
and early mortality, is rare and natural history studies are few.
Methods: RECENSUS is a multicenter chart review of male
XLMTM patients characterizing disease burden and unmet medical
needs. Data were collected between September 2014 and June
2016. Results: Analysis included 112 patients at six clinical sites.
Most recent patient age recorded was �18 months for 40 patients
and >18 months for 72 patients. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was
3.7 (3.7) months and 54.3 (77.1) months, respectively. Mortality
was 44% (64% �18 months; 32% >18 months). Premature deliv-
ery occurred in 34/110 (31%) births. Nearly all patients (90%)
required respiratory support at birth. In the first year of life, patients
underwent an average of 3.7 surgeries and spent 35% of the year
in the hospital. Discussion: XLMTM is associated with high mortal-
ity, disease burden, and healthcare utilization.
Muscle Nerve 57: 550–560, 2018
X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a cen-
tronuclear myopathy caused by pathogenic variants
in the MTM1 gene, resulting in a lack or dysfunc-
tion of the protein myotubularin.1–8 The disorder is
rare and primarily affects boys, with an estimated
incidence of 1 in 50,000 live male births.9 Infants
present with severe hypotonia, weakness, and respi-
ratory distress, and nearly half die of respiratory fail-
ure in the first year of life.10,11 Children who survive
infancy require extensive supportive care. Most
never
achieve
independent
ambulation,
require
respiratory support, and die prematurely.10,11 Clini-
cal features and comorbidities include elongated
facial features, high-arched palate, ophthalmoplegia,
cryptorchidism,
pyloric
stenosis,
spherocytosis,
hepatic peliosis/hemorrhage, advanced bone age,
and premature adrenarche.12–14
XLMTM is typically diagnosed in the presence
of neonatal hypotonia and weakness, muscle biopsy
showing characteristic histopathologic changes, and
genetic testing for pathogenic variants in MTM1.13
Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments
for XLMTM. Management focuses on maximizing
functional abilities and minimizing medical compli-
cations through multidisciplinary supportive care.9,13
Recent
advances
in
our
understanding
of
XLMTM have led to proof of concept and preclini-
cal studies exploring promising approaches to ther-
apy. Farthest along is the development of gene
therapy. Delivery of a functional myotubularin gene
to Mtm1 knock out mice using an adeno-associated
virus (AAV) system led to increased myotubularin
expression, improved muscle pathology and strength,

 greater motor activity, and prolonged survival.15,16
Similarly, in a dog model of a naturally occurring
MTM1 variant,17 preclinical testing of a single intra-
vascular dose of recombinant AAV8-MTM1 vector
improved muscle weakness and respiratory impair-
ment and prolonged life span through 4 years.18,19
Other studies have suggested that myotubularin pro-
tein replacement,19 down-regulation of dynamin 2
expression,20,21 or inhibition of PIK3C2B22 activity
may be viable therapeutic strategies. With the start of
the first clinical trials of a directed gene therapy for
XLMTM this year,23 there is a clear need for natural
history information for this disease.
The RECENSUS study (NCT02231697, Audentes
Therapeutics, Inc., San Francisco, CA) is a retro-
spective,
multicenter
medical
chart
review
of
patients with XLMTM. The primary objective is to
characterize disease manifestations and recorded
medical management. Secondary objectives are to
identify prognostic disease variables, potential out-
come measures for therapeutic intervention studies,
and clinical disease features that warrant monitor-
ing during therapeutic intervention. The current
analysis examines disease burden and unmet medi-
cal need in XLMTM patients in RECENSUS receiv-
ing the current standard of care.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Eligibility.
Eligible patients
were males diagnosed with XLMTM based on a confirmed
pathogenic variant in MTM1 or clinically affected individu-
als with a combination of genetically confirmed family his-
tory of XLMTM and muscle biopsy. The study protocol was
reviewed and approved by a central institutional review
board (IRB) and local IRBs at participating institutions.
Informed consent was obtained from the parent(s) or legal
guardian(s) of each patient and/or assent by the patient
(when applicable) before initiating medical record review.
Further details regarding data collection, genetic testing,
and statistical analysis are provided as supplementary mate-
rial, available online.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics.
Data were collected from
the medical records of 115 patients, including 6
affected sibling pairs, with XLMTM at 6 sites in
North America. After excluding 3 patients without
a genetically confirmed diagnosis, there were 112
patients. This cohort was stratified by whether the
most recent patient age recorded was �18 months
(n 5 40)
or
>18
months
(n 5 72),
hereafter
referred to as “�18 months old” or “>18 months
old” (Fig. 1). Stratification using 18 months as a
cutpoint was chosen based on the findings of
McEntagart et al.10 where survival to 18 months of
age was 54%; however, in this kind of cross sec-
tional study, many currently living patients in the
�18 months old subgroup eventually survive long
enough to enter the >18 months old group. As
such, this approach was not intended to separate
patients based on the severity of their conditions.
Some of these patients have been previously
reported
in
the
literature
or
online
data-
bases.3,10–12,24,25 Patient characteristics are shown
in Table 1. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis was
3.7 (3.7) months for patients �18 months old
and 54.3 (77.1) months for patients >18 months
old. The majority of patients in both age groups
were white and nearly all lived in North America.
Most XLMTM diagnoses were initially made with
muscle biopsy and confirmed using genetic test-
ing (96%), and most patients were documented
as
hypotonic
at
birth
(Table
2).

 proportion of patients �18 months old had died
compared with those >18 months old.
The time to receiving a genetic diagnosis has
shortened considerably. For the 19 patients born
between 1981 and 1995, before discovery of MTM1,
the average time between birth and genetic confir-
mation was 11.9 years (range, 2.0–24.5 years). The
average age at diagnosis was 35.1 months (range, 0–
128.8 months) for children born 1996–2000, 32.4
months (range, 0.5–149.7 months) for those born
2001–2005, 7.6 months (range, 0.3–28.0 months)
for those born 2006–2010, and 4.4 months (range,
0–17.1 months) for those born 2011–2014. Since
the 1996–2000 birth cohort, average age at biopsy
declined from 7.1 to 2.7 months and one-third of
children are now diagnosed within the first 3
months of life.
Genetic Variants.
MTM1 mutation data were avail-
able for 106 unrelated probands, representing 112
affected individuals. Consistent with the reporting
laboratories’ interpretations of likely or confirmed
pathogenicity, 105 of the 106 MTM1 sequence var-
iants were predicted by MutationTaster26 to be
“disease causing,” with the only variant of uncertain
significance (VUS) being a single nucleotide intron
4 variant predicted to generate a novel splice accep-
tor site 16 bases proximal to the exon 5 splice
acceptor. None of these variants were present in
either the ExAC27 or 1000 Genomes28 databases but
84 have been published and/or listed in the Leiden
Open Variation Database (LOVD) MTM1 gene
mutation database3 as pathogenic variants, with the
remaining 22 being novel variants not previously
reported. Thirty-five pathogenic variants were famil-
ial based either on maternal sequencing or positive
family history, while sequencing confirmed that a
further 8 pathogenic variants were de novo. Informa-
tion on the remaining cases was unavailable.
These 106 independent pathogenic MTM1 var-
iants were spread throughout the gene, affecting
each of the 15 exons. Nine of these were large
multi-exonic deletions, duplications or rearrange-
ments, with the rest being mostly single nucleotide
variants and small indels of up to seven nucleotides.
Sixty-four
variants
were
predicted
null
variants,
expected to lead to complete absence of myotubu-
larin protein, with frameshift insertions or deletions,
splice site variants, and stopgain variants collectively
accounting for 56 (88%) of these. The remainder
were due to short frameshift indels (2), multi-exon
intragenic deletions (2), deletions including exon 1
(2), a start-loss single base change, and one com-
plex multi-exon duplication.25
Predicted
or

alleles
included 37 missense variants and 1 small in-frame

 deletion, with a further 4 multi-exon in-frame dupli-
cations or deletions of unknown consequence. These
were
similarly
distributed
throughout
the
gene,
affecting most of the known protein functional
domains.29 Of the 38 predicted hypomorphic var-
iants, nine (23.7%) altered residues in the amino-
terminal PH-GRAM domain, 11 (28.9%) were in the
Ras-interacting domain, and 11 more in the phos-
phatase domain, including 1 affecting the catalytic
P-loop. The SET-interacting domain was altered in 7
patients, and there were no variants that mapped to
within the carboxy-terminal coiled-coil domain.
Gestational Characteristics.
Gestational characteris-
tics are shown in Table 2. Fetal movement was
decreased in approximately half of patients overall,
but in a larger percentage of those �18 months
old than > 18 months old, and was observed at a
mean 29 weeks’ gestation, with little difference
between
age
groups.
Premature
delivery
(i.e.,
before 36 weeks) occurred in approximately one
third of patients overall at a mean 32 weeks’ gesta-
tion. Polyhydramnios was noted in approximately
half of the cohort at a mean 31 weeks’ gestation.
Birth presentation could not be reliably character-
ized because it was not documented for more than
half of the cohort. Cesarean delivery was the most
common form of delivery in both age groups.
Most patients had a low Apgar score at 1 min after
birth.
Respiratory Support.
Use of respiratory support is
shown in Table 3. The vast majority of patients in
both age groups required respiratory support at
birth. In the first 24 h after birth, a majority
required intermittent positive pressure ventilation

ventilation (SIMV) and approximately one-quarter
required
continuous
positive
airway
pressure
(CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)
support, with little difference between age groups.
Among
patients
with
respiratory
support
data,
reported lifetime incidence of respiratory support
was high in both age groups, including a majority
of patients using IPPV/SIMV support and CPAP/
BiPAP.
Overall, more than one-third of patients had
used supplemental oxygen at some point, with
greater use among patients >18 months old. Ten
patient records did not indicate whether they had
respiratory support at any time, but all 102 remain-
ing patients required it at some point in their lives.
Tracheostomy, performed in 60% of patients, was
more than twice as common among patients >18
months old and was performed at an older mean
age in these patients, although the median age was
the same for both age groups. Nearly half of
patients required ventilator support 24 h per day at
some time. Among patients who were not 24-h ven-
tilator dependent, patients �18 months old had
more hours off the ventilator than those >18
months old.

mile-
stones were inconsistently documented in the med-
ical records. The ability to sit without support for
10 s was achieved in only 1 patient (at 11.8
months) among the 11 patients �18 months old
for whom these data were documented. This mile-
stone was achieved in 41 of 48 patients >18
months old at a mean of 19.9 (13.1) months
among the 28 patients with data on timing. The
ability to walk ten yards was not achieved by any of
the 7 patients �18 months old for whom these
data were documented; 13 patients achieved inde-
pendent
walking

the
42

Related Conditions in the Medical Record.
Other
medical conditions considered related to XLMTM
were present in 72% of patients (Table 4). The most
common related conditions (grouped by MedDRA
System Organ Class30 were musculoskeletal and con-
nective tissue disorders and congenital, familial, and
genetic disorders. In general, related medical condi-
tions were more frequent in patients �18 months old
compared with patients >18 months old for most
major MedDRA system organ classes, with the greatest
difference for abnormal bone development. Among
patients >18 months old, facial paresis was more com-
mon. Dysmorphism, head deformity, macrocephaly,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, and salivary hyperse-
cretion occurred in similar proportions of patients in
both age groups. Hepatic peliosis, a serious and often
fatal complication in older patients with XLMTM,12,13
was documented in 6 patients in the RECENSUS
cohort ranging in age from 1.8 years to 22.0 years.
Similarly, thin or fractured ribs31 were reported in 10
patients.
Hospitalizations and Procedures.
The annual per-
centage time in the hospital per patient for all
patients, and for only patients with records includ-
ing information on hospitalizations, was highest in
the first year of life (35% and 47%, respectively)
(Fig. 2A), declined in Year 2, and continued to
decline through Year 5. Sixteen patients spent
their entire first year of life in the hospital. The
most frequently reported (�5%) reasons for hospi-
talization were respiratory in nature (Table 5).
After discharge, home-based nursing or physical
therapy support was reported for 37% of patients.
The mean number of surgeries ranged between
2.0 (1.5) and 3.7 (2.5) per year (Fig. 2B). The
most frequently reported (�5%) surgical proce-
dures are shown in Table 6. Surgeries performed

included
esophagogastric

tomy, myringotomy with or without ear tube inser-
tion,
bronchoscopy,
laryngoscopy,
orchidopexy,
spinal fusion, adenotonsillectomy and laparoscopy.
Only gastrointestinal tube insertion was performed
in a greater percentage of patients �18 months
old.
Gastrostomy,
circumcision,
muscle
biopsy,
myringotomy, inguinal hernia repair, and ventricu-
loperitoneal shunt were performed in similar pro-
portions of patients in both age groups.
DISCUSSION
Findings demonstrate high mortality and sub-
stantial disease burden in patients with XLMTM,
particularly in those �18 months of age at last
follow-up, where mortality was 64%; this is similar
to the 18-month survival rate of 54% observed by
McEntagart et al.10 The clinical disease burden
includes respiratory support at birth for 90% of
patients, 24-h ventilator dependence for 48%, tra-
cheostomy
for
60%,

 intervention, with patients hospitalized for 35–47%
of their first year of life. As such, the RECENSUS
dataset confirms perinatal and respiratory findings of
earlier studies and provides important insights into
healthcare
use,
medical
intervention,
diagnostic
trends, and the extent of related medical conditions.
Perinatal Complications.
XLMTM often involves a
prenatal history of polyhydramnios and weak or
infrequent fetal movements.10 As in previous stud-
ies, perinatal complications were commonplace in
RECENSUS and frequencies were higher than for
pregnancies in the general population.10,12 Polyhy-
dramnios and decreased fetal movement were each
noted in roughly 50% of RECENSUS pregnancies
comparable to 45% and 58%, respectively, in a pre-
vious study.12 Although statistics on decreased fetal
movement are not widely available, polyhydram-
nios is estimated to occur in only 0.2–1.6% of preg-
nancies overall.32 Preterm birth was reported for
31% of RECENSUS patients, 24–31% of XLMTM
patients in previous studies,10,12 and only 9.6% of
U.S. births overall.33 Similarly, Caesarean delivery
was performed for 59% of births in RECENSUS
and 45% in a previous study,12 compared with
32% of U.S. births overall.33 In addition, the
majority of patients had a low Apgar score at 1 min
after birth, signaling a need for extensive, immedi-
ate and aggressive resuscitation management in
the newborn period.
Respiratory
Support.
A primary presentation of
XLMTM is inability to establish spontaneous respi-
ration. The near-universal (90%) need for respira-
tory support at birth in the RECENSUS population
is consistent with this, and with findings of McEn-
tagart et al. that 85% of patients required respira-
tory support at birth regardless of eventual survival
or degree of disease severity.10 These data also
illustrate that respiratory compromise at birth is
not a reliable predictor of later severity, a fact that
may lead to prognostic uncertainty during the
assessment of newly diagnosed infants. Although
data were unavailable for 10 patients, all 102 of the
remaining cohort required respiratory support at
some point in their lives, underscoring the severity
of this disease. Nearly half of RECENSUS patients
required 24-h ventilator support, consistent with
the rate of 57% reported by Herman et al.12 The
decision to undergo tracheostomy may be driven
by both medical and philosophical or logistical
considerations, but the procedure was uniformly

 common in both the RECENSUS cohort (60%)
and the study by McEntagart et al. (50%).10 Of
interest, tracheostomy was performed for twice the
proportion of patients aged >18 months compared
with
those
�18
months.
Additionally,
older
patients were more likely to be using supplemental
oxygen, but less likely to be dependent on ventila-
tor support 24 h per day. Herman et al. also found
that among patients surviving past 1 year, 57%
were
24-h
ventilator
dependent.12
Increasing
cumulative lifetime need for ventilation and tra-
cheostomy with age place a substantial quality-of-
life burden on patients and their families, likely
including cost, anxiety about the machines failing,
difficulty
communicating,
and
limitations
on
mobility and social activities.
Motor and Cognitive Function.
The medical records
of XLMTM patients in RECENSUS contained lim-
ited data on motor milestones. This is unfortunate
given that hypotonia, weakness and grossly delayed
motor
development
are
hallmarks
of
the
dis-
ease.10,12 Nonetheless, available data for patients
who survived beyond 18 months demonstrated
delays in the ability to sit without support and to
walk 10 yards. Similarly, despite a dearth of infor-
mation on cognitive function, available data sug-
gest that among children living beyond 18 months,
approximately 37% were below grade level. Her-
man et al. reported 20% (7 of 35) of children sur-
viving
past
1
year
had
delayed
cognitive
development.12
Motor
function
and
cognitive
development are important developmental features
that should be regularly and consistently assessed
in XLMTM patients using standardized assessment
tools to better understand the long-term motor
and cognitive development of these children.
Healthcare Use and Medical Intervention.
The aver-
age length of hospital stay for all newborn infants
in the United States has been reported as 4.3 days,
extending to 7.7 days for sick infants, and 15.3
days for premature only infants.34 In contrast, the
average time spent in the hospital for XLMTM
newborns ranged from a third to almost half of
the
first
year
of
life,
depending
on
whether

 complete hospitalization data were available for this
period (Fig. 2A). While the annual percentage time
in the hospital per patient declined after the first
year of life, the number of surgeries per child
ranged between 2.0 and 3.7 per year over the first 5
years of life, which contrasts with reported rates of
429 total surgical procedures per 10,000 infants less
than 1 year of age, and 294/10,000 children aged 1
to 4 years in the U.S. general population.34 These
RECENSUS data highlight the significant propor-
tion of young lives spent in the hospital and under-
going
procedures
during
their
early
years,
demonstrating the high disease burden for young
children and their families, and the likely adverse
impact on quality of life and healthcare system costs.
As might be expected in a disease characterized
by hypotonia and inability to establish spontaneous
respiration, the most common reasons for hospitali-
zation were respiratory distress, respiratory failure
and pneumonia. The most commonly performed
surgeries (gastrostomy in 94% and tracheostomy in
60%) are higher than reported by McEntagart et al.,
in which 56% and 50% of patients, respectively, had
undergone gastrostomy and tracheostomy.10 It is
important to note that the number of surgeries
reported in RECENSUS may underrepresent the
true burden, as each surgery may have multiple pro-
cedures performed under a single episode of anes-
thesia, and some case records, particularly on older
patients, may have contained incomplete data. On
the other hand, surgical procedures captured on
some case report forms (CRFs) also included muscle
biopsy (a routine diagnostic procedure in XLMTM)
and circumcision, which, in some cases, may not be
a therapeutic procedure.

X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy Study
MUSCLE & NERVE
April 2018
 published previously.3,10 The LOVD MTM1 muta-
tion database currently lists 153 missense substitu-
tions and 209 frame shift or nonsense variants
among 529 MTM1 variants (28.9% and 39.5%,
respectively),3
comparable
to
37/106
missense
(34.9%) and 40/106 frame shift 1 nonsense changes
(37.7%) in the RECENSUS cohort. It is likely that
large duplications and rearrangements are under-
represented in both groups as a result of difficulty
identifying these by Sanger and next generation
sequencing methods. The LOVD includes one large
multi-exonic
duplication,
while
the
RECENSUS
cohort includes four, all of which were diagnosed in
2010 or later, reflecting the recent availability of
clinical deletion/duplication testing.25 Genotype–
phenotype correlations are complex, and it will be
important to further explore whether particular var-
iants are associated with mild or severe clinical pre-
sentations. However, both null and missense variants
were found in roughly equal proportions among
cases in the �18 or >18 month age groups.
A striking finding from RECENSUS is the sub-
stantial decrease in time to genetic diagnosis since
the gene was identified in 1996.1 Today, one-third of
genetic diagnoses are made within the first 3 months
of life and sometimes before muscle biopsy results
are returned. Earlier diagnosis has important impli-
cations for strategies to improve clinical outcomes
and quality of life, and helps families and clinical
teams make appropriate decisions regarding ongo-
ing care and potential future children.
Benefits
and
Limitations
of
Retrospective
Chart
Reviews.
While retrospective studies are particu-
larly valuable for rare diseases, they have inherent
limitations. Data collection may be hindered by
inconsistent documentation and data extraction or
missing data. RECENSUS collected a comprehen-
sive range of data using robust methodology;35
however, many of the primary clinical records had
been assembled by a preexisting research study or
by a registry, many were incomplete, and underre-
porting is likely. For example, hospitalization data
on patients with at least one reported event might
be more representative of the group as a whole, as
some records contained diagnostic information
but relatively little retrospective clinical data. Data
on comorbidities in retrospective data collection
are subject to a high degree of missing data, as
many conditions are not documented in patient
medical records or may be masked by successful
management strategies. For example, the propor-
tion of patients with reported dysphagia (which
typically persists despite the insertion of a G-tube)
was <15%, which is lower than the incidence of
G-tube insertion typically used to manage that
symptom.
Similarly,
hypotonia
and
respiratory
failure, which were primary or presenting findings
in a large majority of cases, were also sometimes
reported as comorbidities in the medical records
of
some
of
those
same
patients.
Therefore,
although recorded as comorbidities, these findings
were omitted from Table 4.
Finally, with small datasets, results from one or
two patients can skew the results, e.g., in RECEN-
SUS, the mean age at diagnosis (36.1 months) was
substantially greater than the median (6 months).
Such
studies
may
be
biased
toward
living,
“healthier” patients, due to increased likelihood of
consent from these parents, and difficulty obtaining
IRB approval for deceased patients. There may also
be selection bias; for example, the patients at the
very mildest end of the spectrum of disease manifes-
tations may be under-diagnosed or there may be
other confounding factors (e.g., most RECENSUS
patients were white from North America), meaning
that regional differences in patient characteristics,
treatment patterns and outcomes may not be repre-
sented. Finally, evolution of the disease natural his-
tory with increasingly sophisticated medical care is
unlikely to be captured adequately.
Despite the above limitations, retrospective chart
reviews are valuable tools to address challenges inher-
ent in rare disease research, including small numbers
of geographically isolated patients and inadequate
knowledge
about
the
clinical
disease
course.36
Indeed, as these studies can identify variables that
correlate with disease and outcomes in the absence of
treatment,37 they also help define objectives, out-
come measures, and feasibility for future prospective
studies38 and have provided historical control popula-
tions for interventional studies of treatments that
have
since
received
regulatory
approval.39
The
RECENSUS data characterize measures of XLMTM
that might be useful as potential outcome measures
for therapeutic interventional trials. Future analyses
from RECENSUS will provide valuable information
on predictors of survival in these patients.
In conclusion, the RECENSUS study has more
completely defined the disease burden and medi-
cal management of XLMTM, and reinforces earlier
findings that XLMTM is a severe disorder of child-
hood with substantial mortality, morbidity, and
burden on patients, families, and healthcare sys-
tems. With no currently approved treatments for
XLMTM,
there
are
significant
unmet
medical
needs for this population. This comprehensive
data set will inform prospective studies of treat-
ments for XLMTM.
