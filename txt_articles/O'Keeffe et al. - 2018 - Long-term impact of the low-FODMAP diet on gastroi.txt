Abstract
Background: The low- 
FODMAP diet is a frequently used treatment for irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS). Most research has focused on short- 
term FODMAP restriction; how-
ever, guidelines recommend that high- 
FODMAP foods are reintroduced to individual 
tolerance. This study aimed to assess the long- 
term effectiveness of the low- 
FODMAP 
diet following FODMAP reintroduction in IBS patients.
Methods: Patients with IBS were prospectively recruited to a questionnaire study fol-
lowing completion of dietitian- 
led low- 
FODMAP education. At baseline and following 
FODMAP restriction (short term) only, gastrointestinal symptoms were measured as 
part of routine clinical care. Following FODMAP reintroduction, (long term), symptoms, 
dietary intake, acceptability, food- 
related quality of life (QOL), and healthcare utiliza-
tion were assessed. Data were reported for patients who continued long- 
term 
FODMAP restriction (adapted FODMAP) and/or returned to a habitual diet (habitual).
Key Results: Of 103 patients, satisfactory relief of symptoms was reported in 12% at 
baseline, 61% at short- 
term follow- 
up, and 57% at long- 
term follow- 
up. At long- 
term 
follow- 
up, 84 (82%) patients continued an ‘adapted FODMAP’ diet (total FODMAP 
intake mean 20.6, SD 14.9 g/d) compared with 19 (18%) of patients following a ‘ha-
bitual’ diet (29.4, SD 22.9 g/d, P=.039). Nutritional adequacy was not compromised for 
either group. The ‘adapted FODMAP’ group reported the diet cost significantly more 
than the ‘habitual’ group (P<.001) and affected social eating (P<.01) but there was no 
effect on food- 
related QOL. Healthcare utilization was similar between both groups.
Conclusion and Inferences: Low- 
FODMAP education is effective for long- 
term IBS man-
agement, enables a nutritionally adequate diet, and is broadly acceptable to patients.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most commonly diagnosed gas-
trointestinal disorder1 and is characterized by episodic abdominal 
pain and altered defecation.2 This heterogeneous disorder is a leading 
cause of morbidity among the general population and global preva-
lence is estimated at 11% with women more commonly affected than 
men.3 It has a significant impact on patients’ health- 
related quality of

life (QOL)4,5 and is associated with increased healthcare utilization6 
and has significant economic consequences.1,7 Over 80% of IBS pa-
tients report food- 
related symptoms and this is independently associ-
ated with reduced QOL.8
Dietary restriction of fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, 
monosaccharide, and polyols (low- 
FODMAP diet) is an effective treat-
ment for IBS symptoms, with 50- 
76% of patients demonstrating a clini-
cal response.9-15 Randomized10,13,16,17 and non- 
randomized trials14,15,18 
demonstrate short- 
term (up to 6 weeks) global and individual symptom 
improvement in IBS and have been reviewed elsewhere.19 The diet 
involves restriction of high- 
FODMAP foods for 4- 
6 weeks to achieve 
symptom improvement followed by systematic reintroduction to iden-
tify the tolerance threshold for individual FODMAPs, which enables 
long- 
term self- 
management of symptoms and increasing dietary variety.
The low- 
FODMAP diet is a complex intervention and should be 
implemented with counseling from a dietitian.20-22 To date, research 
has reported on clinical and nutritional outcomes following short- 
term FODMAP restriction.10,13 However, there are concerns regarding 
the nutritional adequacy of the diet and inadequate calcium intake 
following 4 weeks of FODMAP restriction.13 Furthermore, there are 
concerns regarding long- 
term acceptability of the diet.12,18 Data on 
the long- 
term effectiveness, nutritional adequacy and acceptability 
of the low- 
FODMAP diet are scarce. For example, studies have re-
ported symptoms retrospectively12,23 or symptoms and acceptability 
prospectively.18,24 However, there has been no evaluation of dietary 
intake or other aspects of the diet in relation to food- 
related QOL and 
effects on healthcare utilization in the long term.
The extensive elimination of foods and the likelihood that many 
patients that respond will require dietary modification in the long 
term, coupled with the increasing use of the low- 
FODMAP diet war-
rants a comprehensive evaluation of long- 
term outcomes. Therefore, 
the aims of this study were to assess the long- 
term impact of the low- 
FODMAP diet on clinical response, high- 
 and low- 
FODMAP food fre-
quency, nutritional adequacy, dietary acceptability, food- 
related QOL, 
and healthcare utilization in patients with IBS.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study design
This study was a prospective long- 
term follow- 
up postal questionnaire 
study. Consecutive patients diagnosed with IBS in accordance with the 
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (abdominal 
pain/discomfort, bloating or change in bowel habit for at least 6 months 
in the absence of organic disease)21 were recruited from both second-
ary care (Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK) and 
primary care (Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Somerset, 
UK). All eligible patients had been counseled on the low- 
FODMAP 
diet by a specialist gastroenterology dietitian and had received two 
clinical appointments; the initial appointment for dietary education on 
FODMAP restriction (baseline) and the follow- 
up appointment at least 
6 weeks later when they had been following the low- 
FODMAP diet 
(short- 
term follow- 
up) at which point they were educated on FODMAP 
reintroduction. The prospective long- 
term follow- 
up performed as part 
of this study (long- 
term follow- 
up) occurred at least 6 months and no 
more than 18 months after short- 
term follow- 
up. Thus, data were col-
lected from three time points, the first two of which were part of rou-
tine clinical care where only symptom data were collected.
At baseline, patients had been instructed to restrict their intake of 
high- 
FODMAP foods for at least 6 weeks. Written guidance on suitable 
and unsuitable foods and appropriate low- 
FODMAP food products for 
the restriction phase of the diet was provided. At short- 
term follow- 
up, 
counseling on FODMAP reintroduction was provided. Patients were 
instructed to undertake 3- 
day FODMAP food challenges using in-
creasing food portions to identify individual FODMAPs that triggered 
symptoms. This process enabled patients to reintroduce some high- 
FODMAP foods to their tolerance threshold. Both appointments were 
conducted as per normal clinical practice as described elsewhere.14,15
Patients were ineligible for the prospective long- 
term follow- 
up 
study if they had failed to attend the short- 
term follow- 
up clinical 
appointment; had experienced an acute gastrointestinal episode in 
the 4 weeks prior to long- 
term follow- 
up; had been diagnosed with 
a co- 
existing gastrointestinal disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, 
celiac disease), an eating disorder or a significant psychiatric disorder 
since baseline; or were unable to give informed consent.
The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and was approved by the East of Scotland Research and Ethics 
Committee (REC reference: 13/ES/0158). Participation was voluntary 
and all data were confidential and were reported anonymously. All pa-
tients provided written informed consent at long- 
term follow- 
up.
At the prospective long- 
term follow- 
up patients were asked to report 
their current weight and height and whether their weight had changed 
during FODMAP restriction. Patients were also asked to rate their cur-
rent knowledge of the low- 
FODMAP diet using a 5- 
point Likert scale 
(extremely poor; below average; average; above average; excellent).
2.2 | Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool output
Data for symptoms and stool output were available for baseline, 
short- 
term follow- 
up (from clinical records), and long- 
term follow- 
up 
Key Points
• The low-FODMAP diet is a successful treatment for irri-
table bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there are limited 
data on the long-term effects of the diet. The current 
study assessed the long-term impact of the low-FOD-
MAP diet on clinical response, dietary intake, patient ac-
ceptability, food-related QOL, and healthcare use.
• Over half of patients report long-term symptom relief, 
the diet is nutritionally adequate and acceptable to 
patients.
• The findings support using the low-FODMAP diet for 
long-term IBS management.

(from prospective survey). Data from baseline and short- 
term follow-
 
up clinical appointments were matched to the long- 
term follow- 
up 
data using a unique anonymized identifier.
Global symptom response used the question “Do you currently 
have satisfactory relief of your gut symptoms?”.25 The Gastrointestinal 
Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was used to assess the severity (absent, 
mild, moderate, severe) of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, burp-
ing, borborygmi, urgency, incomplete evacuation, nausea, heartburn, 
acid regurgitation, and lethargy.26 Data on stool frequency and con-
sistency (Bristol stool form scale) were collected at all time points and 
based on an average for the last 7 days.27 IBS subtype was based on 
retrospective reporting of predominant stool consistency: those re-
porting Bristol Stool Form type 1 or 2 were classified as constipation- 
predominant IBS (IBS- 
C), those reporting Bristol Stool Form type 6 or 
7 were classified as diarrhea- 
predominant IBS (IBS- 
D), those reporting 
Bristol Stool Form type 1 or 2 and 6 or 7 were classified as mixed sub-
type IBS (IBS- 
M), and those reporting Bristol Stool Form type 3, 4, or 
5 were classified as IBS unclassified (IBS- 
U).
2.3 | Dietary intake, acceptability, and food- 
related 
quality of life
Dietary intake was assessed at long- 
term follow- 
up using the 
Comprehensive Nutrition Assessment Questionnaire (CNAQ) which 
is a semi- 
quantitative food frequency questionnaire validated to assess 
FODMAP and nutrient intake.28 FODMAP intake was determined using 
an automated entry system available online (http://www.cnaq.com.au). 
Nutritional adequacy was assessed by comparison of nutrient intakes 
against the United Kingdom dietary reference values.29-31 Frequency data 
on the consumption of foods high and low in individual FODMAPs was as-
sessed based on cutoffs.32 Each food frequency questionnaire food item 
was categorized as high- or low- 
FODMAP and, if high, which FODMAP(s) 
they contained. Food items were also categorized into food groups and 
sub- 
groups to assess daily intakes. Low- 
FODMAP speciality foods were 
included within their respective food group, eg, low- 
FODMAP cereals 
and grains included gluten- 
free bread, and low- 
FODMAP milk included 
lactose- 
free cow’s milk. Additionally, daily intakes of onion and garlic were 
assessed as they contribute a large amount of fructans to the diet.33
The proportion of patients who consumed foods high in individ-
ual FODMAPs (fructans, galacto- 
oligosaccharides, lactose, fructose, 
sorbitol, and mannitol) at least once a week was assessed between 
groups.
Patients were asked to record their dietary adherence to long- 
term 
FODMAP restriction using a 4- 
point Likert scale: ‘continued strict low- 
FODMAP diet’, ‘reintroduced high- 
FODMAP foods to tolerance’, ‘con-
tinued low- 
FODMAP diet 50% of the time’, ‘returned to habitual diet’. 
The ‘adapted FODMAP’ group included the first three of these.
Acceptability of dietary restriction was assessed at long- 
term 
follow- 
up using a 14- 
item questionnaire adapted from the nutrition- 
related QOL questionnaire.34 Questions considered the impact and 
challenges of diet on eating environment, travel, meal enjoyment, cost, 
shopping, and cooking. Data were scored using a 5- 
point Likert scale 
(strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree).
The impact of the low- 
FODMAP diet on QOL was assessed at 
long- 
term follow- 
up using a seven- 
item questionnaire based on a ge-
neric validated food- 
related QOL tool (Satisfaction with Food- 
related 
Life).35 Data were scored using a 5- 
point Likert scale (strongly agree, 
agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree).
2.4 | Healthcare utilization and work absenteeism
At long- 
term follow- 
up patients were asked to record how often they 
visited their general practitioner or gastroenterologist for gastrointes-
tinal symptoms during the previous 12 months, what IBS medication 
they were currently taking, if it had changed since being advised on 
the low- 
FODMAP diet, and whether they were absent from work due 
to their gastrointestinal symptoms in the same period.
2.5 | Statistical analysis
The primary outcome was global symptom relief at long- 
term follow-
 
up compared with baseline. The sample size was calculated to detect 
a difference in the primary outcome assuming 60% of patients who 
had reported global symptom relief at short- 
term follow- 
up would 
continue to report it at long- 
term follow- 
up vs 10% of patients who 
had not reported global symptom relief at short- 
term follow- 
up would 
report it at long- 
term follow- 
up. A total of 80 completed question-
naires were required at 90% power for detecting a difference in the 
primary outcome at P=.05 significance level. From previous experi-
ence of postal invitation to a dietary intake study, it was anticipated 
that at least 20% of subjects invited would complete and return the 
questionnaires,36 thus it was assumed that 380 patients would be in-
vited to achieve the sample size requirement.
Returned questionnaires were excluded from analysis if more 
than 10% of questions had not been answered. Individual symptom 
responses assessed by the GSRS were collapsed into a dichotomous 
response to report the presence or absence of ‘moderate or severe’ 
symptoms as previously reported.15 Stool frequency was reclassified 
into normal (once every 3 days to three times a day) or abnormal 
(less than once every 3 days or more than three times a day). Stool 
consistency was reclassified into normal (Bristol Stool Form types 
3, 4, or 5) or abnormal (Bristol Stool Form types 1, 2, 6, or 7) as 
previously reported.15 For dietary intake, dietary acceptability, food- 
related QOL, work absenteeism, and healthcare utilization com-
parisons, patients were collapsed into a dichotomous response set 
according to whether they returned to a habitual diet (‘habitual’) or 
continued to restrict high- 
FODMAP foods (‘adapted FODMAP’) at 
long- 
term follow- 
up. Categorical data for dietary acceptability and 
food- 
related QOL were collapsed into three group response sets to 
provide clinically meaningful interpretation and data distribution for 
analysis.
All data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, 
IL, USA). Demographic and baseline symptoms were analyzed descrip-
tively. Data are reported as mean±standard deviation (SD) with 95% 
confidence intervals for continuous data and n (%) for categorical data, 
unless otherwise indicated. A Bonferroni correction was applied for

O’KEEFFE Et al.
multiple comparisons where required. Statistical significance was con-
sidered where P<.05.
Macronutrient and micronutrient intakes were assessed for ade-
quacy in comparison to the UK recommendations. Food frequency in-
takes from the food frequency questionnaire were converted to daily 
intakes using previously published conversion factors.37 Daily intakes 
were adjusted to account for the total number of foods reported as 
consumed by each subject.
3 | RESULTS
A total of 375 (n=309 secondary care, n=66 primary care) patients 
were eligible and invited to participate in the study. Of these, 232 did 
not respond to the invitation to participate, thus 143 were consented 
and recruited (Figure 1). Thirty patients agreed to take part initially 
but did not return the questionnaire while seven withdrew stating lack 
of time or personal reasons, and three patients returned incomplete 
questionnaire and were excluded from analysis. Therefore, 103 pa-
tients were analyzed at long- 
term follow- 
up (Table 1) with 74 from 
secondary care and 29 from primary care. All baseline demographics 
were similar between groups except for gender and age. There were 
significantly fewer males from primary care (females from secondary 
care 50 [49%], females from primary care 26 [25%], males from sec-
ondary care 24 [23%], males from primary care 3 [3%]; P=.022) and 
the patients recruited from secondary care were significantly younger 
than the patients recruited from primary care (secondary care 
45.3±15 year vs primary care 56.6±12 year; P<.001). At baseline, 20 
patients had IBS- 
C, 39 patients had IBS- 
D, 21 patients had IBS- 
M, and 
23 patients had IBS- 
U.
3.1 | Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool output
At baseline, 12 (12%) patients reported satisfactory symptom re-
lief, which increased to 63 (61%) patients at short- 
term follow- 
up 
(FODMAP restriction) and to 59 (57%) patients at long- 
term follow-
 
up (Figure 2; P=.003). There were no significant differences for sat-
isfactory relief between settings at baseline (secondary care 8 [8%] 
vs primary care 4 [4%]; P=.671), short- 
term follow- 
up relief (second-
ary care 42 [41] vs primary care 21 [20%]; P=.143), and long- 
term 
follow- 
up relief (secondary care 41 [40%] vs primary care 18 [18%]; 
P=.539). Of the 63 patients with satisfactory relief at short- 
term 
follow- 
up, 44 (70%) maintained this in the long term. The proportion 
of patients reporting presence of individual symptoms significantly 
decreased over time (Figure 3). Specifically, abdominal pain, bloat-
ing, and flatulence were reported in over 60% of patients at baseline

and decreased by at least a third at long- 
term follow- 
up. There was 
a significant reduction in the proportion of patients reporting abnor-
mal stool frequency (baseline 21%; short- 
term follow- 
up 7%; long- 
term follow- 
up 7% P<.001) and abnormal stool consistency (baseline 
65%; short-

(Cochran test).
3.2 | Dietary intake, acceptability, and food- 
related 
quality of life
At long- 
term follow- 
up, 84 (82%) patients continued to follow an 
‘adapted FODMAP’ diet, while 19 (18%) returned to a ‘habitual’ diet. 
There were no significant differences between groups at long- 
term 
follow- 
up for energy and nutrient intakes, except for folate and 
vitamin A which were both higher in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group 
compared with the ‘habitual’ group (Table 2). At least 95% of patients 
met the appropriate dietary reference value for energy and the ma-
jority of nutrients in both groups. Total carbohydrate and calcium in-
takes, which have previously been reported as lower than controls in 
short- 
term low- 
FODMAP diet studies,9,13 were not different between 
the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group compared with the ‘habitual’ group 
(total carbohydrate: 250±94.4 g/d vs 252±95.5 g/d, P=.925; calcium: 
960±608 mg/d vs 1168±695 mg/d, P=.230, respectively).
Total FODMAP intake was significantly lower for the ‘adapted 
FODMAP’ group (20.6±14.9 g/d) compared with the ‘habitual’ group 
(29.4±22.9 g/d, P=.039; Table 2). No significant differences were noted 
between the groups for individual FODMAP intakes although there 
was a trend for lower lactose intake in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group

compared with the ‘habitual’ group (10.4±12.7 g/d vs 16.9±19.4 g/d, 
P=.072).
Patients in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group reported a significantly 
lower overall intake of high- 
FODMAP food groups (1195±658 g/d 
vs 1751±1015 g/d, P=.004) and a significantly higher overall intake 
of low- 
FODMAP food groups (2770±1236 g/d vs 1857±983 g/d, 
P=.003) than patients in the ‘habitual’ group (Table 3). There were sim-
ilar overall intakes between groups for high- 
 and low- 
FODMAP cereals 
and grains, and the only significant findings for sub- 
groups of cereals 
and grains sub- 
group were that the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group had a 
higher intake of low- 
FODMAP bread (difference 27.04 g/d, P=.022) 
and a lower intake of high- 
FODMAP pasta (difference −26.7 g/d, 
p=0.010) compared with the ‘habitual’ group. The ‘adapted FODMAP’ 
group reported a higher intake of low- 
FODMAP milk and milk prod-
ucts (difference 415 g/d, P=.023), specifically low- 
FODMAP milk 
(difference 393 g/d, P=.024), and low- 
FODMAP vegetables (differ-
ence 220 g/d, P=.020) and a lower intake of fats and oils (difference 
−11.4 g/d, P=.003) compared with the ‘habitual’ group.
Patients in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group consumed significantly 
less onion and garlic than patients in the ‘habitual’ group (onion: 
11.4±19.1 g/d vs 22.9±27.2 g/d, P−.032; garlic 0.32±0.63 g/d vs 
1.25±1.83 g/d, P<.001).
Significantly fewer patients in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group ate 
high fructan foods at least once a week (21% vs 30% P<.001) or foods 
containing high levels of free fructose at least once a week (17% vs 
27% P<.001) compared with the ‘habitual’ group, and there were no 
differences between groups for foods containing high levels of lactose, 
galacto- 
oligosaccharides, sorbitol, or mannitol (Table 4).
There were no significant differences between groups for the 
majority of components of dietary acceptability (Table 5) except for 
the following. Seventy- 
two (86%) patients in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ 
group reported their diet was more expensive than prior to following 
the diet, compared with only 8 (42%) patients in the ‘habitual’ group 
(P<.001). The ‘adapted FODMAP’ group reported increased difficulty 
eating out at restaurants compared with the ‘habitual’ group (66 [79%] 
vs 11 [58%] P=.013), eating at family and friends’ houses (61 [72%] 
vs 9 [48%] P=.009), and eating when traveling (63 [76%] vs 9 [48%] 
P=.014). However, there were no significant differences for any of the 
components of food- 
related QOL between groups (Table 5).
3.3 | Healthcare utilization and resources
There were no significant differences for healthcare utilization be-
tween the ‘adapted FODMAP’ and ‘habitual’ groups for either visiting 
a GP (33 [39%] vs 9 [47%] P=.431) or gastroenterologist (34 [41%] vs 
8 [42%] P=.390). Additionally, there were no significant differences 
for the numbers of days absent from work between groups with 15 
(18%) ‘adapted FODMAP’ patients vs 3 (16%) ‘habitual’ diet patients 
(P=.775) taking at least 3 days off work in the last 12 months due to 
gastrointestinal symptoms.
Approximately half of patients reported taking no medication at long- 
term follow- 
up, 39 (46%) of the ‘adapted FODMAP’ vs 10 (53%) of the 
‘habitual’ group (P=.625). Since low- 
FODMAP advice, significantly more 
patients in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group, 22 (26%) ceased medication 
compared with only 1 (5%) patient in the ‘habitual’ group (P=.048). For 
the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group, 11 (13%) patients started new medication 
compared with 3 (16%) in the ‘habitual’ group (P=.757) and 3 (4%) of the 
‘adapted FODMAP’ group reported a change in medication over the past 
12 months compared with no patients in the ‘habitual’ group (P=.403).
Patients in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group had a greater depen-
dency on supplementary resources to support their diet than those 
in the ‘habitual’ group (P<.001), with just under half of ‘adapted 
FODMAP’ patients (42%) using dietary information provided by the 
dietitian, 19% using websites with low- 
FODMAP recipes, and 18% 
using low- 
FODMAP cookbooks.
4 | DISCUSSION
This is the first study to comprehensively report on the long- 
term im-
plications of the low- 
FODMAP diet in patients with IBS 6- 
18 months 
following dietitian- 
led education. A majority of patients (82%) educated 
on the low- 
FODMAP diet continued with a personalized adaptation of 
the diet to self- 
manage their symptoms in the long term and 57% of

all patients who received low- 
FODMAP education continued to report 
long- 
term satisfactory relief. Nutritional requirements were met by the 
majority of patients and long- 
term nutritional adequacy was not com-
promised when compared with the ‘habitual’ diet group. Overall, patients 
found the ‘adapted FODMAP’ diet acceptable and it did not negatively 
affect their food- 
related QOL, healthcare utilization, and work absentee-
ism more than patients who had returned to a ‘habitual’ diet.
Our finding that dietary adherence to the low- 
FODMAP diet is 
maintained in the long term and is associated with improved symptom 
response is indicative of the therapeutic value of the diet for long- 
term 
management. Short- 
term studies have demonstrated consistent and 
reproducible findings on overall symptoms10,13,14,16,17 and emerging, 
long- 
term data are also supportive. After a median of 16 months fol-
lowing FODMAP education, 86% of patients with IBS and inflamma-
tory bowel disease reported a partial (54%) or full (32%) symptom 
response to the diet,23 consistent with our findings. An earlier retro-
spective study, which investigated adherence and clinical effective-
ness of a partial low- 
FODMAP diet (fructose and fructan restriction) 
found that at 14 months follow- 
up 77% of patients were adherent 
to the diet with 76% reporting significant improvement in abdominal

study; 76% of participants were adherent to the low- 
FODMAP diet at 
a mean 16 months follow- 
up, but satisfaction with symptom response 
was slightly greater at 72% of patients than that observed herein.18 
In a randomized non- 
blinded trial which compared the low- 
FODMAP 
diet with hypnotherapy, 82% of patients who had responded to the 
diet maintained satisfactory relief of symptoms at 6 months, equating 
to 58% of all patients who had received dietary advice.24 Cumulatively, 
long-

FODMAP diet is not only maintained 
in the majority of patients but is also associated with significant

improvement in symptom response. The variation observed between 
studies may be explained, at least in part, by differences in study de-
sign such as the high level of response bias in retrospective studies.
Individual symptom severity reduced at both short- 
 and long- 
term follow- 
up. Significant reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, 
flatulence, incomplete evacuation, and lethargy were reported, with 
pain, bloating, and flatulence decreasing by more than one- 
third in the 
long term. These findings are consistent with existing short10,13,14,16,17 
and long- 
term literature18,23,24,38 as well as a recent systemic review 
and meta- 
analysis.39 The study cohort had a low reporting of abnor-
mal stool frequency at baseline which is not uncommon in IBS due 
to its relapsing and remitting nature. The enduring symptom allevia-
tion associated with the diet is a remarkable advantage of FODMAP 
therapy particularly compared to pharmaceutical management where

symptom relief is limited at best.40 Dietary management of IBS is asso-
ciated with increased feelings of self- 
control and empowerment41 and 
may foster greater long- 
term self- 
management.
The lack of robust long- 
term nutrient data and the identification 
of at risk nutrients in short- 
term studies14 have raised questions re-
garding the nutritional adequacy, and therefore suitability, of the diet 
for long- 
term management. A key finding herein is that an ‘adapted 
FODMAP’ diet maintained for 6- 
18 months achieved nutritional ad-
equacy and any deficits in energy or nutrient intakes were similar to 
those expected in the background population.42
In short- 
term studies of the low- 
FODMAP diet, total carbohydrate 
intakes of 200 g/d have been observed following FODMAP restric-
tion;9,13 however, the current study reports a 20% higher total carbo-
hydrate intake. A gluten- 
free diet for management of celiac disease is 
associated with a similar trend that is a reduction in carbohydrate in-
take observed in patients new to the diet followed by an increase in ex-
perienced users.43,44 There was no reduction in long- 
term dietary fiber 
intake. Data on dietary fiber intakes in short- 
term studies are inconsis-
tent. Two studies report similar levels to baseline,13,45 while another 
shows a significant reduction in intake following FODMAP restric-
tion.9 A reduction in dietary fiber intake during FODMAP restriction 
is plausible given the stringent reduction of some staple cereals and 
legumes. However, in the long term, we observed a greater propor-
tion of patients meeting the dietary fiber nutrient requirements on an 
‘adapted FODMAP’ diet having reintroduced foods high in FODMAPs 
to individual tolerance than for those patients who had returned to a 
‘habitual’ diet. This may be due to increased familiarity with the diet 
and greater understanding of low- 
FODMAP, high- 
fiber food choices.
Previous research suggests that FODMAP restriction leads to 
lower calcium intakes in the short term.13 In the current study, mean 
calcium intakes were adequate and there was no difference in the 
proportion of patients that achieved their calcium requirement on 
an ‘adapted FODMAP’ diet compared with a ‘habitual’ diet. This may 
be due to a significant increase in lactose- 
free milk consumption (in-
cluding calcium- 
fortified plant- 
based milks) in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ 
group such that calcium levels were maintained.
This is the first study to evaluate the intake of foods and food 
groups in patients following a low- 
FODMAP diet. Patients who contin-
ued to follow an ‘adapted FODMAP’ diet had a lower intake of garlic, 
onion, ready- 
meals, some high fructan cereal- 
based foods (eg, pasta), 
high- 
FODMAP sugars (eg, honey), and high- 
FODMAP miscellaneous 
and processed foods compared with the ‘habitual’ diet. Cereal prod-
ucts including pasta, wheat bran, and breakfast cereals have previously 
been identified as symptomatic triggers and the reduction of these is 
unsurprising.46 A reduced intake of high- 
fat foods and miscellaneous 
and processed high- 
FODMAP foods for the ‘adapted FODMAP’ group 
signifies a move toward less high- 
fat, energy- 
dense food options and 
may, in part, explain the reported weight loss observed in over 40% 
of those on an ‘adapted FODMAP’ diet. Previously, patients with IBS 
report greater induction of symptoms with fatty foods compared to 
controls47 and those with IBS show hypersensitivity to lipid infusions 
compared to healthy individuals.48 Interestingly, different proportions 
of fat, protein, and carbohydrate may aggravate IBS, particularly IBS- 
C, 
via hormonal mediators of gut endocrine cells which are understood 
to regulate gastrointestinal functions including visceral sensation, mo-
tility, and secretion.49 In clinical practice, dietary manipulation of car-
bohydrate or fat or an increase in protein intake are associated with 
symptom improvements in some patients.49
An increase of low- 
FODMAP fruit and vegetables as seen here 
is equivalent to two portions of fruit and vegetables daily, again in-
dicative of more healthful dietary patterns in the ‘adapted FODMAP’ 
group. Recent guidelines for IBS report that in a heterogeneous IBS 
population, lower intakes of fruit and vegetables and higher intakes 
of fast foods have been reported to be involved in symptom genera-
tion although the evidence is insufficient to indicate that dietary habits 
have a role to play.22 Thus, if a low- 
FODMAP diet can improve di-
etary habits and decrease overall intake of foods high in fat in the long 
term; it may have additional benefits to health and warrants further 
research.
Further investigation to determine which individual FODMAPs 
and high- 
FODMAP foods can be successfully reintroduced is of great 
interest and may help to determine whether any specific FODMAPs or 
foods are more likely to be tolerated, and which FODMAPs might be 
associated with provocation of specific symptoms.
A reduction in bodyweight has been observed in individuals ran-
domized to a low- 
FODMAP compared with ‘habitual’ diet13 and a 
reduction in energy intake in another study.9 Despite energy intake 
not being measured at baseline in the current study, 42% of patients 
reported weight reduction at long- 
term follow- 
up, this may be due 
to adopting a healthier eating pattern as described above. Weight 
and weight loss was self- 
reported and should be interpreted with 
caution.50
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investi-
gate the long- 
term acceptability of the low- 
FODMAP diet. We re-
port the diet causes disruption for eating out and with family/friends. 
Consistent with a recent retrospective study, the diet was associated 
with increased cost.23 All of these issues can be addressed during di-
etetic consultation.14,15 The low- 
FODMAP diet does not negatively 
affect food- 
related QOL nor does it adversely affect enjoyment of 
meals, cooking, shopping and integration into current lifestyles com-
pared with patients who consume their ‘habitual’ diet. Given the large 
proportion of individuals affected by IBS and the known reduction 
in their QOL4 alongside dissatisfaction with current treatments by at 
least 60% of patients,51 these findings are of importance. They demon-
strate that the diet is not only an effective treatment but it is also 
acceptable with improved QOL for this chronic disorder and patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease.17,23,52
The economic impact of IBS is notable.1,53,54 Recent data suggest 
that IBS accounts for in excess of £80 million in prescription costs 
alone and IBS patients are significant users of healthcare accounting 
for 7.5% of total outpatient visits across specialities.7 The current find-
ings indicate that healthcare usage and medication use is similar among 
those on an ‘adapted FODMAP’ diet and a ‘habitual’ diet; however, the 
expenditure appears to be slightly lower than that reported for UK 
patients with IBS.1 Further work is required to assess healthcare usage 
of patients who do and do not receive low- 
FODMAP education.

There are several limitations of this study. Firstly, only 27% of the 
original sample invited to take part completed the study which is lower 
than other similar postal questionnaire studies.18,55While we acknowl-
edge that it is possible we may have sampled a biased population of pa-
tients who had responded to the low- 
FODMAP diet, global symptom 
data from the baseline and short- 
term follow- 
up were similar for those 
who did and did not reply to the initial invite as reported previously.18 
Over 80% of subjects were recruited from an urban setting although 
most did not reply or had moved. Half of subjects invited from a rural 
area were recruited to the study. The higher response rate among 
these participants may possibly reflect the less transient nature of rural 
communities. In addition, the rural population was significantly older 
and included a smaller proportion of males than the urban population 
perhaps due to greater work opportunities for the younger population 
and for males in the urban area compared to elsewhere as reported 
from national data.56 Secondly, the study design was a prospective 
questionnaire- 
based study that was uncontrolled and unblinded, thus 
increasing the risk of bias. Finally, given the lack of a disease activity 
biomarker in IBS, symptom evaluation was subjective and we acknowl-
edge the limitations associated with subjective measures.22,57 Dietary 
intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire which has been 
validated to assess FODMAP intake; however, not in a UK population. 
As with all food frequency questionnaires this approach can underesti-
mate or overestimate intake of certain foods.58
In summary, we report that the low- 
FODMAP diet is an effective 
long- 
term strategy for the management of IBS addressing an area 
which has, to date, been largely unexplored.59–61
5 | CONCLUSION
This study prospectively evaluated the long- 
term impact of the low- 
FODMAP diet on symptom response, dietary intake, patient accept-
ability, and healthcare utilization in a large cohort of patients with IBS. 
Patients report that the diet is clinically effective with 57% reporting 
long- 
term satisfactory symptom relief. Individuals who have received 
comprehensive education on the low- 
FODMAP diet have completed 
short- 
term FODMAP restriction followed by FODMAP reintroduction 
to individual tolerance. A low- 
FODMAP diet can be nutritionally ade-
quate up to 18 months after initial education and patients find that the 
diet is acceptable and does not adversely impact on food- 
related QOL.
