Abstract
Introduction: 
To date, no studies have explored how different regulatory environments may influ-
ence the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes (ECs) as a smoking cessation aid.
Objective: 
This study compares the real-world effectiveness of adult smokers using ECs for quit-
ting compared with quitting unassisted or quitting with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and/
or prescription medications in two countries with restrictive policies towards ECs (ie, Canada 
and Australia) versus two countries with less restrictive policies (ie, United States and United 
Kingdom).
Methods: Data were drawn from the International 
Tobacco Control Four Country surveys, from the 
United States and Canada (2 waves, n = 318 and 380, respectively), the United Kingdom (3 waves, 
n = 439) and Australia (4 waves, n = 662), collected 2010–2014. Smokers at baseline wave who 
reported making a quit attempt at follow-up were included. 
The primary outcome was self-reported 
abstinence for at least 30 days regardless of smoking status at follow-up assessment. Data across 
waves were combined and analyzed using generalized estimating equations.
Results: Compared to unassisted quitting (ie, no medications or ECs), smokers who used ECs for 
quitting from countries with less restrictive EC policy environments were more likely (OR = 1.95, 
95%CI = 1.19–3.20, p < .01), whereas smokers who used ECs for quitting from countries with more 
restrictive EC policies were less likely (OR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.18–0.72, p < .01), to report sustained 
abstinence for at least 30 days.
Conclusions: Use of ECs in the real world during a quit attempt appears only effective for sustain-
ing smoking abstinence in a less restrictive EC environment suggesting that the benefits of ECs for 
smoking cessation are likely highly dependent on the regulatory environment.
Implications: What this study adds: 
This is the first study to examine the impact of regulatory envi-
ronment for ECs on their real-world effectiveness for smoking cessation. 
This study shows that in

a less restrictive EC regulatory environment, use of ECs during a quit attempt facilitates, but in a 
more restrictive environment, it inhibits, short-term sustained abstinence. 
The findings underscore 
the need for careful consideration on how best to regulate this emerging product so that EC ben-
efits for smoking cessation are maximized and its risks to public health are minimized.
Introduction
Globally, the reported prevalence of electronic cigarette (EC) use 
has increased in recent years.1 The increased use of e-cigarettes has 
fueled debate about whether such products will benefit or harm 
public health.2 Those who oppose ECs are concerned about pos-
sible adverse impacts of EC use on nonsmokers, especially young 
people who would otherwise not smoke or use nicotine-containing 
products.3–5 There is also concern about the real benefits of e-cig-
arettes because of dual use by smokers and unknown health risks 
from long-term use.6,7 Proponents of EC use have emphasized the 
potential benefits to help smokers who are unable or unwilling to 
quit, to stop smoking.8 Current evidence suggests that ECs are less 
harmful than conventional cigarettes, and in fact ECs have shown 
to improve lung function among smokers in a recent randomized 
controlled trial (RCT)9 although ECs may not completely be without 
any risk particular among those with pre-existing health conditions 
such as cardiovascular disease or cancer.10,11
ECs may represent a unique and new paradigm for affecting the 
cessation of conventional cigarettes, although currently the effec-
tiveness of ECs for helping smokers to quit is uncertain. Recent 
meta-analytic reviews of RCTs have shown that the odds of quit-
ting conventional cigarettes were twice as high in those using ECs 
with nicotine compared with those using ECs without nicotine.12,13 
However, a meta-analysis of real-world observational studies came 
to the opposite conclusion, suggesting that the odds of quitting were 
lower for smokers who used ECs compared to those who did not 
use ECs.14 A recent study by Kalkhoran and Glantz15 reviewed find-
ings from clinical trials and observational studies and concluded 
that smokers who used or had used ECs were less likely to have 
stopped smoking than those who had not used ECs. This review, 
however, did not consider three aspects of ECs and their usage that 
have been found to be important in the impact of ECs on quitting. 
First, it did not consider whether or not smokers were using ECs to 
quit; a recent study has found that smokers who used ECs to quit 
in their last quit attempt (LQA) were significantly more likely to 
quit16 and so combining these smokers with those who were using 
ECs for other purposes unrelated to quitting would dilute the posi-
tive impact of ECs on quitting. Second, the review did not take into 
account frequency and duration of the use of e-cigarettes; studies 
have shown that greater frequency and duration (ie, daily use for at 
least a month) is associated with a greater likelihood of quitting.17,18 
Third, the review treated all ECs the same, despite the many dimen-
sions on which these products vary, including dimensions related to 
potential nicotine delivery; a recent study has shown that tank sys-
tems were associated with greater likelihood of quitting, relative to 
other types of e-cigarettes (eg, cigalikes, disposables).13
It is presently unclear whether the use of ECs is associated with 
greater cigarette abstinence than current practice (ie, use of nico-
tine replacement therapy [NRT], prescription medications [PM] or 
behavioral therapy) as the majority of the studies to date have not 
included a comparison to either currently approved quitting meth-
ods (eg, NRT, PM) or no EC use. A recent real-world cross-sectional 
study found that smokers who used ECs were more likely to report 
abstinence than those who used a licensed NRT product bought over 
the counter or no aid to cessation.16
The present study examines the possible impact of the restric-
tiveness of the regulatory environment for ECs on quitting among 
smokers. Availability and access to nicotine-based ECs are likely to 
be affected by the regulatory environment for ECs.19 In countries like 
Australia and Canada where the retail sales of nicotine containing ECs 
are effectively banned, it would be more difficult for smokers to obtain 
ECs with nicotine, and hence, they are likely to have less opportunity 
to experiment with different devices to find ones that best suited to 
them in terms of nicotine delivery. By contrast, in countries like the 
United States and the United Kingdom, where ECs are more widely 
available and nicotine-containing ECs are more accessible, users of 
ECs have greater opportunities to vape and experiment with different 
nicotine-containing devices, which may improve their likelihood of 
being able to quit smoking. Recent evidence indicates that smokers’ 
awareness and use of ECs, especially ones with nicotine, are lower 
in Australia and Canada than in the United Kingdom and the United 
States consistent with the difference in EC regulatory environment.1,20
Using longitudinal data from the International Tobacco Control 
(ITC) Four Country Survey, this study aimed to compare the relative 
effectiveness of using ECs as compared with other methods to quit 
smoking among adult smokers in two countries with more restric-
tive regulatory environments for e-cigarettes (Canada and Australia) 
versus two countries with less restrictive regulatory environments 
(United States and United Kingdom). We hypothesized that the quit 
rate would be higher among smokers who used ECs for quitting 
compared to those using no help but no different from an approved 
method, and that EC effectiveness for quitting would be higher in a 
less restrictive, than in a more restrictive, EC environment.
Methods
Sample
Study participants came from the ITC Four Country Survey, a longitudi-
nal cohort survey of a nationally representative sample of adult smokers 
(aged ≥18) from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and 
Canada, followed up approximately annually. Those lost to the study 
were replenished using the same sampling procedure as initial recruit-
ment. Details of the ITC conceptual model and methodologies have been 
reported elsewhere.21,22 For this study, the analytic sample consisted of 
only those who provided data for at least one wave-to-wave transition, 
defined as smoking at one wave (baseline) and at the next wave (follow-
up) reported having made at least one quit attempt since the baseline 
wave. To ensure sufficient sample size, data from several waves of the 
ITC surveys were combined and analyzed (see Table 1). The study period 
spanned between 2010 and 2014 across the four countries where data 
were collected using a mix of telephone interviews and web surveys.
Measures
Outcome Variable (30-Day Sustained Abstinence)
The primary outcome was self-reported abstinence for at least 
30 days regardless of smoking status at follow-up. This was derived

from responses to several questions asked of smokers at follow-up 
assessment. At follow-up, participants still smoking were asked 
whether they had made a quit attempt since last survey. In addition, 
those quit at follow-up were coded as having made a quit attempt. 
All quit attempters were asked when their most recent quit attempt 
started (in days). Anyone quit for less than 30 days was excluded as 
their quit length could not be determined. Those who relapsed to 
smoking following a quit attempt were also asked when their most 
recent quit attempt ended to compute the duration of their most 
recent quit attempt, which was then used to derive the outcome.
Predictor Variables (Help Used at Last Quit Attempt)
Smokers who made a quit attempt were asked what forms of 
help, including an opportunity to specify any other help, they 
might have received for their last/current quit attempts as well 
as whether they used any (NRT, such as nicotine patch, gum, and 
lozenge) or (PM, such as varenicline or bupropion) for their last/
current quit attempts. Use of ECs was not specifically asked until 
the 2014 (Wave 10) survey (United Kingdom and Australia only) 
using the question: “Did you use an e-cigarette as part of your last 
quit attempt?” For earlier waves, use of ECs for LQA was derived 
from two open-ended questions on what other NRT and other help 
they used for last quit attempt. For the purpose of analysis, help 
at LQA was defined as follows: no help was defined as not using 
any ECs, NRT, or PM for last quit attempts; ECs, NRT, and PM 
were each defined as exclusive use of each method for last quit 
attempts; combination help was defined as any combination of the 
aforementioned methods for last quit attempts (eg, ECs plus NRT; 
ECs plus NRT plus PM). Each of the help categories above could 
include behavioral support (defined as any advice or informa-
tion about quitting smoking from a telephone/Quitline service, an 
internet website about quitting smoking, or a local stop-smoking 
service [clinics/specialists]). Because what constituted behavioral 
support was heterogeneous across countries, a decision was made 
not to use it as a criterion for defining help except for the sensitiv-
ity analysis. In the 2014 survey, additional questions were added 
to assess, among those who reported using ECs for their last quit 
attempts, the frequency of EC use at the start of their quit attempts 
(every day, some days, or not at all) and the product type used 
(disposables, replaceable pre-filled cartridges, or liquid filled tank 
systems). Those who reported ever used an EC were asked whether 
their current/last EC contained nicotine.
Moderator Variable
Country was used as a proxy for the regulatory environment for 
ECs. The key regulatory differences between countries are presented 
in Table 2. For the purpose of this study, United Kingdom and 
the United States were coded as a less restrictive, while Australia 
and Canada were coded as a more restrictive, EC regulatory 
environment.
Covariates
Socio-demographics including age, sex, ethnicity (white vs. non-
white in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada; English-
speaking vs. non-English speaking in Australia), income and 
education assessed at prior wave (baseline) along with smoking-
related variables such as baseline Heaviness of Smoking Index23 to 
assess nicotine dependence, baseline quitting interest, baseline any 
quit attempt within last 6 months, number of quit attempts made, 
recency of last quit attempt, and methodological variables such as 
survey wave, survey mode at each wave (phone vs. web interview), 
year recruited into the study, and inter-wave intervals (time between 
waves).
Data Analysis
All data analyses were conducted using Stata version 14. To account 
for the different number of waves of data available for analyses 
between countries (four waves in Australia, three in the United 
Kingdom and two each in the United States and Canada) and also 
the correlated nature of the data due to repeated measurement, gen-
eralized estimating equations (GEE) models were employed to assess 
the association between different forms of help at LQA and 30-day 
sustained abstinence while controlling for covariates. Marginal quit 
rate by form of help was computed for each individual country and 
similar regulatory environment using the post-estimation command 
“margins” in Stata to obtain the adjusted predictions at the means. 
For modelling the binary outcome (30-day sustained abstinence vs. 
not), parameter estimation was conducted using the logit link func-
tion with robust variance and an unstructured correlation structure 
for our working correlation matrix. To test for significant moderat-
ing effects of regulatory environment, a dummy variable indicating 
more restrictive versus less restrictive EC regulatory environment 
was derived and used to create an interaction term ‘regulation by 
help at LQA’ for inclusion in the models. Statistical significance was 
set at alpha = 0.05.

Results
Sample Characteristics
Table 3 presents the demographic and smoking-related charac-
teristics of the analytic sample. Compared to respondents from 
countries with a more restrictive EC regulatory environment, a 
greater proportion of those from countries with a less restric-
tive EC regulatory environment were older, from low income 
background, of lower nicotine dependence at baseline, had no 
quit interest at baseline, had not made a recent quit attempt at 
baseline, and the target quit date was earlier in the inter-survey 
interval. In addition, based on a 2014 survey where data on EC 
use patterns were available in Australia and the United Kingdom, 
70.2% of the United Kingdom smokers who made a quit attempt 
using ECs reported using ECs on a daily basis (compared to 
58.9% in Australia), 45.5% reported using a tank system (com-
pared to 35.9%) and 75.3% reported using ones that contain 
nicotine as compared to 41.0% of their Australian counterparts 
(data not shown).
Predicting Sustained one-month abstinence
GEE analyses revealed that there was an overall significant interac-
tion between forms of help at LQA and regulatory environment on 
1-month sustained abstinence (p < .001; differential effect found only 
for ECs but not the other forms of help) and thus regulation-stratified 
analyses were conducted. Table 4 presents the results stratified by 
regulatory environment (see Supplementary Table S1 for individual 
country results). In the less restrictive countries—the United States 
and the United Kingdom (see Table 4), about 58% of the smokers 
who reported quitting without using any NRT, PM, or ECs reported 
30-day sustained abstinence as compared to 73% who used ECs to 
quit, 70% who quit using NRT, 74% who used PM, 68% who used 
a combination of help and 68% of those who responded “Don’t 
Know” (DK). GEE results indicated that compared to the no help 
group, those who quit using ECs were significantly more likely to 
sustain abstinence for at least 30 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 1.19–3.20, p < .01) and similarly those 
who quit using PM were significantly more likely to sustain absti-
nence for at least 30 days (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.14–3.77, p < .05).

Those who quit using NRT or a combination help, or responded 
DK were also more likely to report 30-day sustained abstinence 
but this did not reach statistical significance compared to no help 
(OR = 1.64, 1.51, and 1.54, respectively). When compared to the 
group using ECs for LQA, those using NRT and PM and also those 
who used a combination of help showed similar likelihood of being 
able to sustain at least 30 days abstinence (see Table 4).
In the more restrictive countries—Australia and Canada (see 
Table 4), the 30-day sustained abstinence rate was 56% for those 
who quit without help but by contrast, the quit rate for those using 
ECs for their LQA was considerably lower at 32% with the quit 
rate being higher only for PM (69%) and no difference for the 
group quitting using NRT (60%) or a combination of help (56%), 
or who responded DK (45%). GEE results indicated that those who 
quit using ECs were significantly less likely to sustain abstinence 
for at least 30 days compared with those with no help (OR = 0.36, 
95% CI = 0.18–0.72, p < .01) whereas those who quit using PM 
were more likely to do so (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.17–2.46, 
 
p < .01) with no difference for the group quitting using either NRT 
(OR = 1.15) or a combination help (OR = 1.01), or who responded 
DK (OR = 0.64). Compared to those using ECs for their LQA, the 
likelihood of sustaining abstinence for at least 30 days was signifi-
cantly higher for NRT and PM (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.56–6.59, 
 
p < .01; and OR = 4.71, 95% CI = 2.25–9.86, p < .001, respectively) 
and also the combination help group (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.25–
6.26, p < .05).
Sensitivity Analysis
We explored the inclusion of behavioral support as an additional cri-
terion for defining the forms of help categories and the results were 
similar (see Supplementary Table S2). We also explored data avail-
able in the 2014 surveys for the United Kingdom and Australia on 
EC use frequency and product type at last quit attempts to determine 
their possible impact on quitting outcome; unfortunately, however, 
the sample sizes in Australia were too low for meaningful analysis, 
but fewer used tank systems. In the United Kingdom, frequency of 
use of ECs was not significantly associated with quit outcome but 
product type used was positively associated with those using a tank 
system to quit being more likely to sustain abstinence for at least 
30 days compared to disposables/replaceable cartridges (OR = 2.57, 
95% CI = 0.83–8.01, p = .10) and significantly more likely than no 
help (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.08–8.93, p < .05).
We also explored the association of nicotine content of ECs with 
outcome using the 2014 survey data. Logistic regression results 
indicated that the odds of 30-day sustained abstinence were higher 
among those using nicotine-based ECs than among those using 
nicotine-free ECs in both the United Kingdom (OR = 3.07, 95% 
CI = 0.33–27.79) and Australia (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.19–9.07) 
although this was not statistically significant, owing to small sample 
sizes.
Discussion
The results from this study are consistent with the notion that the 
strictness of the regulatory environment for ECs can affect their 
real-world effectiveness for quitting. In the United States and the 
United Kingdom, which have fewer restrictions on marketing and 
sale of ECs, smokers who used ECs for their last quit attempts were 
almost twice as likely to quit for at least 30 days compared to those 
who quit without using ECs or any approved therapy. By contrast, 
in Australia and Canada, which have more restrictive EC regula-
tory environments, those who used ECs to quit were significantly less 
likely to sustain abstinence for 30 days or more compared to those 
who quit without help. The effects were striking because they were 
significant and opposite, suggesting that the impact of the regulatory 
environment can be either facilitative or inhibitory.

The reasons for the facilitative effect of ECs for quitting being 
found only in countries with a less restrictive environment for 
ECs could be because quitters from these countries may have bet-
ter access to products, to more effective products (ie, tanks systems 
with nicotine solutions) and greater opportunity to access new sup-
plies when needed; or a generally more supportive environment 
that is actively supportive of EC use. This may result in them hav-
ing greater opportunities to experiment with different devices until 
they find a suitable device. Use patterns and product type have been 
shown in past studies to be important for ECs to be an effective 
quitting method.17,18 Unfortunately data on frequency of use and 
product type collected only in our 2014 survey were insufficient to 
adequately test the explanatory hypotheses we proffer here, but the 
trends in both tank system use and nicotine use are strongly sugges-
tive that they contribute partly to the observed differences. However, 
product inferiority cannot explain the observed inferiority over no 
aids in the more restrictive environments. The poorer outcome may 
be due to restrictions on ready access to products and greater social 
disapproval, but also could be due to self-selection bias. To succeed 
in quitting smokers have to use the product consistently for weeks, 
if not longer, and both poor access to the product and perhaps reluc-
tance to vape in public around potentially hostile others are plausi-
ble reasons for thinking poor compliance would be a factor in the 
high failure rates. In Australia at least, ECs are seen as less socially 
acceptable.24 It is also possible that in low-availability countries, 
those who chose to use ECs to quit were those who were desperate, 
having failed to quit using approved methods, and were destined to 
fail unless ECs provided a quantum increase in effectiveness over 
approved methods, something which is unlikely.12
The finding of approximately equal effectiveness of ECs and 
NRT for quitting in less restrictive EC policy environment is con-
trary to that found by Brown et al.16 where ECs were shown to be 
superior to NRT for quitting among a population-based sample of 
adult smokers in England. One possible reason for the discrepant 
findings might have to do with how forms of quitting assistance were 
defined. Unlike Brown et al.,16 we did not include behavioral sup-
port, or separate NRT over the counter from NRT on prescription 
in defining our help groups, although reanalysing our data including 
behavioral support as a criterion did not make any difference in our 
sensitivity analysis. Another alternative may have been different pat-
terns of use of tank systems and/or non-nicotine products, but it may 
simply be a chance effect, suggesting ECs, at least the types available 
at the time of the study, were not a lot more effective than other 
forms of NRT. The superior outcome of approved therapies such 
as NRT and PM to ECs in restrictive EC environments both adds 
to the ecological validity of our findings, and suggests that current 
practice may be a better option for those who want to quit in restric-
tive environments than in less restrictive ones, unless they think they 
can overcome the additional problems related to EC use that occur 
in the restrictive environments. Given the evidence that PM were 
superior to no help, irrespective of the EC regulatory environment, 
the use of PM such as varenicline should be recommended where the 
smokers are prepared to use them. The advice for NRT is less clear. 
Although not significant, the odds ratios for NRT compared to no 
help are similar to those found in meta-analyses of RCTs.25,26 Further, 
as we have previously shown, in studies like this, the effects of help 
are attenuated the longer the recall period,27 and unfortunately we 
did not have enough cases to limit the period to one short enough 
to show likely real effects. The problem with existing effective aids 
is that many smokers are not prepared to use them,28 or to use them 
for long enough to sustain abstinence.29 The greater interest in using 
EC, particularly in England, shows that e-cigarettes are likely leading 
to extra quitting because they offer a method of help to people who 
would have otherwise not quit or sought help, even if they led to no 
additional odds of success on any given attempt.30
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths. First, this study directly assessed 
the use of ECs for last quit attempts among smokers, removing any 
confounding with other reasons for the use of ECs, thus allowing 
a better evaluation of the effectiveness of ECs for quitting relative 
to approved methods. Second, this study included data from two 
pairs of countries with divergent policy environments for ECs, thus 
providing a more definitive evaluation of the impact of EC policy 
environment on the effectiveness of using ECs for quitting than sin-
gle country comparisons could, as it reduces the likelihood of con-
flating other country characteristics with policy environment. Third, 
while the interactions are meaningful, the absolute levels of effect 
compared with no treatment need to be viewed with caution as the 
likely benefit of all forms of help is likely underestimated due to dif-
ferential memory effect.27 The common effect found for approved 
medicines adds credibility to our argument that the findings with 
regard to ECs are specific to the policy environment.
Several other limitations warrant some discussion. First, it was 
not possible to control for whether ECs used for last quit attempts 
contained nicotine and the type of devices used. Among the minor-
ity where this information was available, use of non-nicotine was 
more common in the more restrictive environment (at least of 
Australia). However, if these factors contributed to the difference, 
they would simply reflect mechanisms by which the policy environ-
ment had its effects. Second, because data on the use of ECs for 
LQA were extracted from open-ended responses for earlier waves, 
it is possible that we might have under-estimated the prevalence 
of use of ECs for quitting. Third, long-term quit outcome was not 
evaluated in this study, so we can say nothing about effects on 
subsequent relapse.
Policy Implications
The findings from this study suggest that the effectiveness of ECs 
for smoking cessation may depend on the regulatory environment 
for ECs. While the use of ECs for quitting has risen rapidly in recent 
years irrespective of regulatory environment,31 the benefits of ECs for 
smoking cessation may be limited to those who reside in an environ-
ment where there are few restrictions on the retail sale and market-
ing of ECs. If these results are confirmed, it underscores the need for 
careful consideration of how best to regulate this emerging product. 
Even if ECs are no more effective than other effective treatments, the 
higher levels of use as found in the less restrictive environment of 
the United Kingdom, both here and in other studies,30 suggests ECs 
will have a markedly greater impact on overall cessation rates, over-
coming a major limitation with NRT products which are not used 
much.28 Any form of product regulations should maximize overall 
public health benefits while not preventing or inhibiting innovations 
that are critical for continued improvement of ECs and other alter-
native nicotine delivery systems (ANDS).32 Whether ECs should be 
regulated as a medicine, a tobacco product or a consumer product 
and the impacts it might have on its efficacy as a smoking cessation 
aid remain somewhat unclear. However, we note that all the ECs 
used in this study must have been purchased as consumer products

as there are no ECs available as therapeutic goods, so clearly con-
sumer products are being used to quit smoking, albeit in some cases 
substituting vaping for smoking rather than quitting nicotine alto-
gether. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and 
other countries worldwide are moving towards different regulatory 
approaches and will provide further opportunities to study their 
impacts on EC effectiveness as a cessation aid.
Conclusions
In a less restrictive EC regulatory environment, use of ECs during 
a quit attempt in the real world facilitates, but in a more restrictive 
environment, where use is lower, it appears to inhibit, short-term 
sustained smoking abstinence, thus suggesting that the benefits of 
ECs for smoking cessation may be dependent on the regulatory envi-
ronment. If so, developing an appropriate regulatory framework for 
ECs should be a priority so that the benefits of ECs for smoking 
cessation can be realized, while not neglecting potential risks. Where 
the regulatory environment supports it, given the popularity of ECs, 
smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit using current approved 
methods should be offered the option of quitting with ECs or replac-
ing smoking with ECs for harm reduction purposes.33
