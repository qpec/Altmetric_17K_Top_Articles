Abstract: The deleterious effect of chronic activation of the IL-1￿ system on type 2 diabetes and other
metabolic diseases is well documented.
However, a possible physiological role for IL-1￿ in glucose
metabolism has remained unexplored. Here we found that feeding induced a physiological increase in the
number of peritoneal macrophages that secreted IL-1￿, in a glucose-dependent manner. Subsequently, IL-
1￿ contributed to the postprandial stimulation of insulin secretion. Accordingly, lack of endogenous IL-1￿
signaling in mice during refeeding and obesity diminished the concentration of insulin in plasma. IL-1￿
and insulin increased the uptake of glucose into macrophages, and insulin reinforced a pro-inflammatory
pattern via the insulin receptor, glucose metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species, and secretion
of IL-1￿ mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Postprandial inflammation might be limited by nor-
malization of glycemia, since it was prevented by inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2.
Our findings identify a physiological role for IL-1￿ and insulin in the regulation of both metabolism and
immunity.

Abstract 
22 
The deleterious role of chronic activation of the IL-1β system in type 2 diabetes and other 
23 
metabolic diseases is well documented. However, a possible physiological role of IL-1β in 
24 
glucose metabolism remained unexplored. Here we show that feeding induces a 
25 
physiological increase in the number of peritoneal macrophages, which secrete IL-1β in a 
26 
glucose-dependent manner. Subsequently, IL-1β contributes to postprandial stimulation of 
27 
insulin secretion. Accordingly, lack of endogenous IL-1β in mice during refeeding and obesity 
28 
reduced plasma insulin. IL-1β and insulin increased glucose uptake into macrophages, and 
29 
insulin reinforced a pro-inflammatory pattern via the insulin receptor, glucose metabolism, 
30 
reactive oxygen species production, and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion. 
31 
Post-prandial inflammation is limited by normalization of glycemia and can be prevented by 
32 
inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). Our findings identify a physiological 
33 
role for IL-1β and insulin in the regulation of both metabolism and immunity.

Introduction 
36 
Activation of the innate immune system is an initial response of the body to infections and 
37 
injuries. The resulting inflammation aims at protecting against stressors and at restoring 
38 
tissue and organism homeostasis. This process is largely driven by IL-1β, one of the first 
39 
described cytokines1. However, prolonged activation of the immune system by over-
40 
nutrition may eventually promote the development of metabolic diseases2-6. A critical sensor 
41 
of nutrient overload is the NLRP3 inflammasome, which processes pro-IL-1β to its active 
42 
form in various metabolic disorders. This is the case for uric acid crystals which activate the 
43 
NLRP3 inflammasome in gout7, for cholesterol crystals in atherogenesis8, and for glucose, 
44 
fatty acids and islet amyloid polypeptide in type 2 diabetes9-13. Importantly, a causal link 
45 
between IL-1β-induced inflammation and these metabolic diseases has been demonstrated 
46 
by various genetic and pharmacological approaches in animal models14-16 and in clinical 
47 
trials17-21. While these studies shed light on the pathological role of IL-1β in metabolism, a 
48 
physiological function of IL-1β in metabolic control remains largely unexplored.  
49 
 
50 
In response to pathogens and obesity, profound changes in the metabolism of immune cells 
51 
take place22-25. Beyond supplying energy, nutrients can also act as signaling molecules that 
52 
promote the activation of immune cells. Indeed, elevated glucose and other metabolites 
53 
drive production of IL-1β by macrophages14,26.  
54 
 
55 
Insulin-producing β cells have the highest IL-1 receptor expression of any tissue27 and the IL-
56 
1 receptor is the most abundantly expressed cell surface receptor on β cells28, pointing to a 
57 
hitherto unappreciated physiological function. While the deleterious role of high-dose and 
58 
long-term IL-1β exposure on islet function and mass is well documented29,30, a few mainly in 
59 
vitro observations hint to a possible beneficial role of IL-1β in insulin secretion and β-cell 
60 
survival31,32.  
61 
 4 
 
 
62 
Parenteral glucose stimulation leads to a rapid first and second phase of insulin release. In 
63 
contrast, the physiological slower resorption of a meal elicits a sustained increase of insulin 
64 
that depends on the duration of food intake33. Thereby the insulin response to enteral food 
65 
intake cannot be solely accounted for by the associated changes in blood glucose. It is 
66 
modulated by several insulin secretagogues including the incretin hormones GIP and GLP-
67 
134. These hormones promote insulin secretion only when glucose levels are elevated. While 
68 
GIP and GLP-1 are the best described incretins, other incretin-like factors are thought to 
69 
exist. 
70 
 
71 
Several studies show that food intake transiently induces a mild inflammatory response35,36. 
72 
We hypothesized that IL-1β contributes to this postprandial inflammation, regulating whole 
73 
body glucose homeostasis along with an innate immune response. Thereby, it may deliver 
74 
the energy needed to activate the innate immune system in order to prevent the 
75 
dissemination of microorganisms contained in the food. We show here that a postprandial 
76 
rise in glucose leads to acute elevation of macrophage-derived IL-1β, which contributes to 
77 
postprandial insulin secretion via the abundantly expressed IL-1 receptor on β cells. Insulin 
78 
reinforces a pro-inflammatory state and stimulates macrophages to produce IL-1β via 
79 
glucose metabolism, subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which leads to 
80 
activation of the inflammasome14,37. Both, insulin and IL-1β regulate glucose disposal, 
81 
whereby IL-1β preferentially stimulates glucose uptake into the immune cell compartment.

Results 
84 
 
85 
Feeding stimulates intra-peritoneal macrophages to produce IL-1β. 
86 
In order to study the physiological involvement of IL-1β in insulin secretion we performed 
87 
overnight fasting followed by refeeding experiments in wild-type and IL1b-/- mice. Two hours 
88 
after refeeding, circulating IL-1β concentration was increased in wild-type mice, while, as 
89 
expected, IL-1β remained undetectable in IL1b-/- mice (Fig. 1a; for validation of the assay see 
90 
Supplementary Fig. 1a). Of note, IL-1β concentration in serum was already elevated 30 
91 
minutes after refeeding (not shown). Next we investigated the source of increased IL-1β. 
92 
Following refeeding, expression of Il1b mRNA and of the IL-1β-dependent chemokines Cxcl1 
93 
and Ccl2 were increased in the omental fat (the main site from which macrophages migrate 
94 
into the peritoneum38,39; Fig. 1b) but not in the circulating leukocytes, liver, spleen, 
95 
epididymal fat or subcutaneous fat (not shown). Furthermore, the number of stromal 
96 
vascular cells isolated from the omentum was reduced (fasted: 41.8 ± 13.4 x 103 cells/mg; 
97 
refed: 8.3 ± 2.6 x 103 cells/mg; mean ± s.e.m.). Accordingly, we observed a marked increase 
98 
in the number of peritoneal cells (Fig. 1c), which displayed an increase in Il1b mRNA 
99 
expression (Fig. 1d). Flow cytometry revealed that the majority of these cells were 
100 
macrophages (Fig. 1e; for gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. 1b), a repartition that 
101 
remained unchanged between fasting and refeeding (not shown). Ex vivo, spontaneous 
102 
release of IL-1β by cultured peritoneal macrophages from fasted or refed mice was 
103 
comparable (not shown). However, macrophages from refed mice released more IL-1β 
104 
following stimulation with ATP (Fig. 1f). To validate the source of the increased IL-1β during 
105 
refeeding, we generated Il1bfl/flLyz2-Cre mice, which specifically lack IL-1β in the myeloid 
106 
lineage (Supplementary fig. 1c). Two hours after refeeding, circulating IL-1β concentration 
107 
was increased in wild-type mice but not in their Il1bfl/flLyz2-Cre littermates (Fig 1g). We then 
108 
tested whether the increase in serum glucose following feeding mediated the postprandial 
109 
 6 
 
increase in IL-1β. We treated mice with the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, which decreases 
110 
glycemia via inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption. Treatment of mice with canagliflozin 
111 
induced glycosuria and prevented postprandial increase in glucose and insulin 
112 
(Supplementary Fig. 1d-f), along with a complete prevention of postprandial increase in 
113 
circulating IL-1β (Fig. 1h). Similarly, injection of the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 2-
114 
deoxyglucose (2DG) prior to refeeding strongly reduced IL-1β release (Fig. 1i). Finally, we 
115 
tested the role of bacterial products in the stimulation of postprandial IL-1β by treating mice 
116 
with broad-spectrum antibiotics or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Antibiotics-treated mice tended 
117 
to have milder postprandial inflammation than untreated mice as detected by Il1b and Cxcl1 
118 
gene expression in the omental fat pad (Supplementary Fig. 1g, h) together with a mild 
119 
decrease in postprandial circulating IL-1β (Supplementary Fig. 1i) despite similar food intake 
120 
and no change in the number of peritoneal cells (Supplementary Fig. 1j-l). Ex vivo, 
121 
peritoneal macrophages from antibiotic-treated mice released less IL-1β, even in the 
122 
presence of ATP (Fig. 1j). However, priming with LPS prior to ATP stimulation restored IL-1β 
123 
secretion (Fig. 1j). Accordingly, in vivo i.p. injection of LPS into fed mice increased circulating 
124 
IL-1β along with insulin and decreased blood glucose (Fig. 1k). However, injection of LPS in 
125 
genomic Il1b–/– mice failed to induce insulin (Fig. 1l). This suggests that there is a need for a 
126 
microbial-related stimulus and energy supply (glucose) to induce postprandial release of IL-
127 
1β. Thus, feeding increases the number of intra-peritoneal macrophages, which are primed 
128 
by bacterial products to produce and release IL-1β in response to glucose. 
129 
 
130 
Postprandial macrophage IL-1β promotes insulin secretion. 
131 
Next, we examined the direct effect of elevated IL-1β after refeeding on insulin secretion. 
132 
First, we measured postprandial circulating insulin in littermate Il1b-/- or wild-type refed 
133 
mice. Il1b-/- mice had reduced insulin secretion (Fig. 2a) and elevated blood glucose 
134 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a) after refeeding compared to wild-type mice, despite comparable 
135 
 7 
 
food intake (not shown). Since the number of peritoneal cells was increased upon refeeding 
136 
(Fig. 1c), and macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 
137 
1e), we depleted macrophages in wild-type mice by i.p. injection of clodronate 
138 
(Supplementary Fig. 2b) prior to performing fasting-refeeding experiments. Depletion of 
139 
macrophages resulted in a marked decreased of postprandial insulin in the circulation (Fig. 
140 
2b). Similarly, postprandial insulin was lower in Il1bfl/flLyz2-Cre mice compared to their wild-
141 
type littermates (Fig. 2c). In addition, acute blockade of IL-1 with its natural antagonist IL-
142 
1Ra prior to refeeding resulted in slightly decreased circulating insulin in wild-type mice (Fig. 
143 
2d) and elevated blood glucose (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Since obesity is associated with 
144 
inflammation and chronically elevated IL-1β and insulin9, we investigated the effect of acute 
145 
(1 hour before refeeding) IL-1 antagonism in diet- induced obese (DIO) mice to substantiate 
146 
the ability of endogenous IL-1β to regulate insulin. Blocking the elevated circulating levels of 
147 
IL-1β (Fig. 2e) with IL-1Ra lowered fasting insulin levels in DIO mice (Fig. 2f) without 
148 
changing insulin sensitivity or hepatic glucose production as determined by a 
149 
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (Fig. 2g, h). As a second model, genetically obese db/db 
150 
mice were injected with IL-1Ra, which also decreased insulin levels (Fig. 2i). Therefore, 
151 
postprandial IL-1β derived from myeloid cells promotes insulin secretion.  
152 
 
153 
Acute exposure to IL-1β induces insulin secretion. 
154 
To directly test the effect of IL-1β on insulin secretion in vivo, we performed acute injections 
155 
of IL-1β in mice followed by i.p. glucose tolerance test (GTT). IL-1β led to a marked elevation 
156 
in insulin secretion (Fig. 3a) and improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 3b). Insulin was also 
157 
increased and glycemia improved by IL-1β administration in the absence of a glucose bolus 
158 
but to a much lesser extent (Fig. 3c, d; note the different scale in the y-axis compared to 3a 
159 
& b). This glucose-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion is reminiscent of effects 
160 
elicited by the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP34. However, circulating active GLP-1 
161 
 8 
 
concentrations remained unchanged following IL-1β injections (Supplementary Fig. 3a). 
162 
Furthermore, the effect of IL-1β on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance was identical in 
163 
Glp1r-/-/Gipr-/- double knock-out mice compared to their wild-type littermates 
164 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b, c) and treatment of mice with the GLP-1 inhibitor Exendin fragment 
165 
9-39 did not reduce the IL-1β effect on insulin secretion (not shown). Therefore, IL-1β did 
166 
not promote glucose-induced insulin secretion via incretin hormones. Since insulin secretion 
167 
could be increased as a result of IL-1β-mediated peripheral insulin resistance, we 
168 
determined if insulin sensitivity changes upon an acute IL-1β injection using insulin tolerance 
169 
tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. Acute injection of IL-1β had no effect 
170 
on insulin sensitivity or hepatic glucose production (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 3d). IL-1β 
171 
also improved glucose tolerance and strongly increased insulin secretion in DIO mice (Fig. 3f, 
172 
g) and in genetically obese db/db mice (Fig. 3h, i). In contrast to wild-type mice, interleukin 1 
173 
receptor-associated kinase 4 (Irak4-/-) deficient mice injected with IL-1β before an i.p. GTT 
174 
showed no improvement in insulin secretion and no change in glycemia (Supplementary Fig. 
175 
3e, f) demonstrating that the observed effects of IL-1β are mediated by the IL-1 receptor 
176 
signal transduction pathways. Of note, i.p. injection of 0.1 μg/kg of IL-1β resulted in 
177 
circulating IL-1β concentrations similar to those obtained upon refeeding and also induced 
178 
insulin secretion (Fig. 3j, k). Next we tested whether LPS has similar effects. Acute i.p. LPS 
179 
injection improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin secretion in both wild-type and 
180 
DIO mice (Fig. 4a, b). Importantly, IL-1Ra treatment blocked LPS-induced insulin secretion 
181 
(Fig. 4c). Type 1 IL-1 receptor mRNA (Il1r1) was expressed at a much higher level in isolated 
182 
endocrine cells than in islet resident immune or endothelial cells (Fig. 4d). Specific 
183 
immunostaining of mouse pancreatic tissue sections revealed the presence of IL-1R1 in a 
184 
subpopulation of β cells (Fig. 4e). Previous in vitro studies32 demonstrated that very low 
185 
concentrations of IL-1β increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islets. We 
186 
confirmed this effect in mouse and human islets, and with the human β-cell line ENDOC 
187 
 9 
 
(Supplementary Fig. 3g-i), suggesting a direct β-cell effect. To determine whether acute 
188 
administration of IL-1β, in vivo, acts directly on the islet, we used streptozotocin (STZ) to 
189 
eliminate β cells from recipient mice and transplanted them with islets from wild-type or 
190 
Il1r1–/– donor mice. The effect of IL-1β on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance was lost in 
191 
Il1r1–/– transplanted mice (Fig. 4f, g). These results suggest that systemic IL-1β potentiates 
192 
glucose-induced insulin secretion via islet IL-1R1, and this is independent of the incretins 
193 
GLP-1 and GIP or of changes in insulin resistance. 
194 
 
195 
Insulin stimulates IL-1β secretion of macrophages  
196 
Since IL-1β enhanced insulin secretion during refeeding, we investigated the possible 
197 
synergistic contribution of insulin and IL-1β to the stimulation of the immune system. First 
198 
we investigated by flow cytometry the expression of the insulin receptor (InsR) on resident 
199 
macrophages isolated from several tissues. We found that peritoneal macrophages had the 
200 
highest insulin receptor expression compared to other resident macrophages (Fig 5a). 
201 
Moreover, we found that the InsR was upregulated in peritoneal macrophages from DIO 
202 
mice (Fig. 5b) and in the pro-inflammatory M1 compared to naive M0 macrophages, 
203 
whereas it was mildly downregulated in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (Fig. 5c, 
204 
Supplementary Fig. 4a). Accordingly, insulin induced AKT phosphorylation in naive M0, to a 
205 
greater extent in M1 and not in M2 macrophages (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig.4b). The 
206 
insulin effect on AKT phosphorylation was confirmed using a quantitative multiplex assay 
207 
(Fig. 5e). In contrast to the PI3K activation pathway, insulin had no impact on MAPK 
208 
signaling (Fig. 5f). Insulin also stimulated upregulation of the glucose transporter Slc2a1 
209 
(encodes GLUT1, the isoform that is mainly expressed in immune cells25; Fig. 5g) and the 
210 
expression of hexokinase 2 (Hk2), the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis (Fig. 5h), in M1 
211 
macrophages. In line with this pattern, a 2 hour insulin treatment increased glycolytic 
212 
activity in M1 macrophages, but not in naive or M2 macrophages (Fig. 5i, Supplementary 
213 
 10 
 
Fig. 4c). In accordance with the phosphorylation assay, the AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002 
214 
but not the MAPK signaling inhibitor U0126 blocked the effect of insulin on glycolytic activity 
215 
in M1 macrophages (Fig. 5j). Further, insulin induced glucose uptake in naive macrophages, 
216 
and this effect was enhanced by IL-1β (Fig 5k). Similar to the pattern of insulin receptor 
217 
expression and activation, insulin induced secretion of mature IL-1β preferentially in M1 
218 
macrophages in an NLRP3-dependent manner (Fig. 6a). Insulin also stimulated Tnf, Il6, and 
219 
Cxcl1 expression and protein release in M1 macrophages but independently of NLRP3 
220 
activation (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e). This insulin effect on IL-1β appeared to be 
221 
independent of cell death and survival, which remained unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 4f). 
222 
Similar to insulin-induced glycolysis, insulin stimulated IL-1β via the PI(3)K activation 
223 
pathway and was blocked by LY294002 and downstream by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin 
224 
(Fig. 6b). We then tested the role of glucose metabolism in insulin-induced IL-1β secretion. 
225 
First, the GLUT1 inhibitor fasentin blocked IL-1β secretion (Fig. 6c). In addition, insulin failed 
226 
to induce IL-1β when cells were cultured with the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 2DG 
227 
or with the mitochondria targeted ROS scavenger Mito-TEMPO (Fig. 6d). IL-1Ra was 
228 
undetectable following short-term exposure (2 hours) to insulin (not shown) however 
229 
prolonged (12 hours) exposure to insulin induced IL-1Ra in M0 and M1 macrophages 
230 
indicating that the induction of IL-1β was later counterbalanced by IL-1Ra secretion (Fig. 6e, 
231 
f). Similarly to our in vitro data, acute injection of insulin in mice increased amounts of 
232 
circulating IL-1β and CXCL1 (Fig. 6g, Supplementary Fig. 4g). Overall, these data show that 
233 
insulin induces inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion via enhanced glucose metabolism 
234 
and mitochondrial ROS production. These effects are dependent on the AKT/-PI(3)K pathway 
235 
and on the activity status of the macrophages. 
236 
 
237 
IL-1β shifts glucose uptake to immune cells 
238 
 11 
 
Next, we tested how IL-1β contributes to glucose disposal. Exposure of macrophages to IL-
239 
1β led to an increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 7a), while blocking endogenously produced IL-1 
240 
with IL-1Ra slightly decreased glucose uptake (Fig. 7b). We then examined the effect of IL-1β 
241 
and insulin injection on glucose uptake in wild-type mice. To avoid glucose-stimulated 
242 
insulin secretion, we only used trace amounts of non-metabolizable radiolabeled glucose. IL-
243 
1β stimulated glucose uptake in spleen and circulating leukocytes (Fig. 7c, d). IL-1β also 
244 
increased glucose uptake in adipose tissue and in muscle, however to a lesser extent than 
245 
insulin (Fig. 7e-g). This is potentially due to the mild stimulation of insulin secretion by IL-1β 
246 
observed in the absence of a glucose bolus (Fig. 3c). To mimic the chronic elevation of IL-1β, 
247 
we injected mice with IL-1β daily for 3 consecutive days and determined the number and 
248 
glucose uptake of peritoneal cells. Similar to refed mice, IL-1β-injected mice had more 
249 
peritoneal cells (Fig. 7h). Ex vivo, glucose uptake of macrophages from these mice was 
250 
increased (Fig. 7i). To test the physiological relevance of IL-1β-induced glucose uptake, we 
251 
investigated postprandial glucose uptake in immune cells of refed mice. Blockade of 
252 
endogenous IL-1 with IL-1Ra decreased glucose uptake in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 7j). 
253 
To further examine the contribution of immune cells to overall body glucose disposal, we 
254 
first used T and B cell deficient (Rag2-/-) mice. A single injection of IL-1β prior to a GTT in 
255 
Rag2-/- mice lowered glucose concentration as potently as in littermate control mice 
256 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). Since Rag2-/- mice have a compensatory increase in the number of 
257 
macrophages, we additionally ablated macrophages in Rag2-/- mice with clodronate 
258 
liposomes (Supplementary Fig. 5b). This diminished the profound beneficial effect of IL-1β 
259 
on glucose disposal, despite increased insulin levels (Fig. 7k), suggesting that immune cells 
260 
substantially contribute to IL-1β-induced glucose disposal. Thus, beside the stimulation of 
261 
insulin, IL-1β directly regulates glycemia by promotion of glucose disposal preferentially in 
262 
immune cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Discussion 
265 
In the present study we show that feeding induces a physiological elevation of macrophage-
266 
derived IL-1β that promotes postprandial insulin secretion. This effect depends on bacterial 
267 
products, which primes macrophages to produce more pro-IL-1β, and on glucose that drives 
268 
the maturation of IL-1β. The production of IL-1β by M1, and to a lesser extent by M0, 
269 
macrophages is enhanced by insulin. Insulin upregulates functional insulin receptors, 
270 
signaling via the AKT/-PI(3)K pathway, glucose uptake through the glucose transporter 
271 
GLUT1, 
glucose 
metabolism, 
and 
ROS 
production 
that 
activates 
the 
NLRP3 
272 
inflammasome14,37. Both insulin and IL-1β regulate whole body glucose disposal by 
273 
promoting glucose uptake in muscle and fat, and fuel the immune system by stimulating 
274 
glucose uptake into the immune cell compartment. Ablation of macrophages in T- and B-cell 
275 
deficient mice significantly reduced IL-1β-mediated glucose clearance. Self-amplification of 
276 
the system is limited by normalization of glycemia. 
277 
 
278 
The number of macrophages in the peritoneum was increased upon refeeding along with 
279 
increased expression of inflammatory genes including Il1b in omental fat, which supports 
280 
active trafficking of macrophages into the peritoneal cavity40. Therefore, feeding stimulates 
281 
immune surveillance, possibly to limit the dissemination of microorganisms contained in 
282 
food. Activation of the immune system requires energy and contributes substantially to 
283 
whole-body glucose consumption. We provide evidence that both, bacterial products and 
284 
glucose metabolism, are required to induce postprandial IL-1β secretion by peritoneal 
285 
macrophages. Indeed, we show that peritoneal cells from refed mice have elevated Il1b 
286 
mRNA levels. This might rather be promoted by translocation of ingested or intestinal 
287 
bacterial products than by the microbiota itself41-43, since pretreatment of mice with 
288 
antibiotics before refeeding only mildly lowered IL-1β secretion. However, stimulation of IL-
289 
1β release strongly depends on glucose uptake and metabolism. Indeed, we observed that 
290 
 13 
 
decreasing glycemia via SGLT2 inhibition or blocking glycolysis with 2DG prevented 
291 
postprandial IL-1β in the circulation. This suggests that from all factors that could mediate 
292 
this effect during feeding, such as mechanical stress of the digestive system, fiber, amino 
293 
acid and fat intake, it is mainly glucose that drives IL-1β secretion. Our results also suggest a 
294 
role for insulin in postprandial IL-1β secretion since insulin increased glucose uptake and 
295 
metabolism in macrophages. Inhibition of glucose uptake with fasentin or 2DG blocked 
296 
insulin-induced IL-1β secretion. Downstream, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production, 
297 
which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome14,37, also prevented insulin from inducing IL-1β. 
298 
 
299 
Previous in vitro studies have shown that low concentrations of IL-1β mildly stimulate insulin 
300 
secretion32. Here we show that in vivo, IL-1β injections strongly potentiate insulin secretion 
301 
in the presence of a glucose bolus. However, the most natural way to stimulate insulin 
302 
secretion is eating. We find that IL-1β-induced insulin release occurs in physiology by 
303 
demonstrating that postprandially produced IL-1β increased insulin levels and decreased 
304 
glycemia. This IL-1β effect is partly mediated by the highly expressed IL-1R1 on β-cells, since 
305 
the effect of IL-1β on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance was blunted in diabetic mice 
306 
transplanted with islets from Il1r1–/– mice.  
307 
 
308 
The beneficial effects of postprandial IL-1β on glucose homeostasis are in apparent contrast 
309 
to the glucose lowering effects of IL-1 antagonism in patients with type 2 diabetes17 and to 
310 
the well-described deleterious effects of IL-1β on islet function and survival4. Though IL-1β 
311 
provokes β-cell demise30,44, at low concentrations or upon short exposure, IL-1β 
312 
paradoxically stimulates β-cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis32. Therefore, IL-1β is 
313 
not only detrimental for β-cells but has more complex biological functions45. An explanation 
314 
to reconcile the beneficial effects of IL-1 blockade in type 2 diabetes is the difference 
315 
between acute and chronic effects and the concept of β-cell “rest”. Indeed, potassium 
316 
 14 
 
channel openers, which decrease insulin secretion, ultimately improve insulin secretion in 
317 
patients with type 2 diabetes46. The benefit of IL-1 antagonism in patients with type 2 
318 
diabetes could result from β-cell rest, possibly in combination with inhibition of the toxic 
319 
effects of IL-1β.  
320 
 
321 
A further explanation why chronic upregulation of IL-1β leading to elevated insulin levels 
322 
may become unfavorable for metabolism stems from our observation that insulin reinforces 
323 
the inflammatory state of macrophages through enhanced glucose uptake and metabolism 
324 
and increased InsR expression in macrophages of DIO mice. Indeed, activated macrophages 
325 
play a crucial role in insulin resistance47. In line with this, insulin receptor expression was 
326 
also higher in macrophages from DIO mice, where macrophages have been shown to be pro-
327 
inflammatory6. Thus, we propose that insulin, which is increased in early stages of type 2 
328 
diabetes, may drive and sustain the inflammatory state in macrophages and may therefore 
329 
contribute to the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with metabolic diseases. 
330 
Thereby, TNFα, IL-6 and CXCL1 may also add to the effect of IL-1β. In support, myeloid cell-
331 
restricted InsR deficient mice are protected against metabolic inflammation and insulin 
332 
resistance48. 
333 
 
334 
The effect of insulin in macrophages was previously studied without taking into account the 
335 
polarization status of the macrophages 49. Herein we show that insulin preferentially acts on 
336 
pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages characterised by more InsRs, enhanced downstream 
337 
AKT phosphorylation and glycolytic activity. Further insulin promotes the NLRP3 
338 
inflammasome and leads to macrophage-derived IL-1β release. Interestingly, peritoneal 
339 
macrophages had the highest insulin receptor density, supporting their contribution to 
340 
postprandial homeostasis. 
341 
 
342 
 15 
 
SGLT2 inhibitors have recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the 
343 
EMPA-REG outcome study revealed an impressive reduction in mortality50. However the 
344 
mechanisms leading to this protective effect are unclear. In the present study, we show that 
345 
canagliflozin prevents postprandial IL-1β elevation in the circulation. This could be due to 
346 
increased glucose excretion in the urine, which prevents an overload of glucose in tissues, 
347 
thereby avoiding deleterious chronic effects of glucose-induced IL-1β.  
348 
 
349 
Altogether, our findings show that IL-1β, a master regulator of inflammation, and insulin, a 
350 
key hormone in glucose metabolism, promote each other. Both have potent effects on 
351 
glucose homeostasis and on the activity of the immune system, supporting the emerging 
352 
concept that inflammatory mediators play a role not only in the pathology of metabolism 
353 
but are an integral part of its physiology. The physiological synergy between IL-1β and 
354 
insulin on glucose disposal may be required to cope with the concomitant challenge by 
355 
nutrients and microorganisms related to food intake.

Online methods 
633 
 
634 
Human pancreatic islets 
635 
Human islets were isolated in the islet transplantation centres of Lille and Geneva from 
636 
pancreata of cadaver organ donors in accordance with the local Institutional Ethical 
637 
Committee. They were obtained via the “islet for research distribution program” through 
638 
the European Consortium for Islet Transplantation, under the supervision of the Juvenile 
639 
Diabetes Research Foundation (31-2008-416). Islets were cultured in CMRL-1066 medium 
640 
containing 5 mmol/l glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM 
641 
Glutamax and 10 % FCS (Invitrogen) on extracellular matrix-coated 24-well plates (Novamed 
642 
Ltd.) in humid environment containing 5 % CO2.  
643 
 
644 
Mouse pancreatic islets 
645 
To isolate mouse islets, pancreata were perfused through the sphincter of oddi with a 
646 
collagenase solution (1.4 gr/l; collagenase type 4 Worthington) and digested in the same 
647 
solution at 37°C, followed by sequential filtration through 500 µm and 70 µm cell strainers 
648 
(BD). Islets were handpicked and cultured on extracellular matrix-coated 24-well plates 
649 
(Novamed Ltd.) in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO) containing 11.1 mM glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 
650 
100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamax, 50 µg/ml gentamycin, 10 µg/ml Fungison and 10 
651 
% FCS. Islets were either collected directly for RNA isolation extraction or cultured for 36 
652 
hours on extracellular matrix-coated 24-well plates for subsequent glucose-stimulated 
653 
insulin secretion experiments.  
654 
 
655 
Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay in islets and ENDOC cells 
656 
For glucose-stimulated insulin secretion experiments, islets or the human β-cell line ENDOC 
657 
cells (kindly provided by R. Sharfmann51) were cultured for 2 days and pre-incubated for 30 
658 
 29 
 
minutes in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB; 115 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.6 
659 
mM CaCl2 2H2O, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4 2H2O, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 % bovine serum 
660 
albumin, pH 7.4) containing 2.8 mM glucose. KRB was then replaced by KRB with 2.8 mM 
661 
glucose and collected after 1 hour to determine the basal insulin release. IL-1β was added at 
662 
the indicated concentrations for the last 30 minutes of the 1-hour period of the basal insulin 
663 
release (priming). This was followed by 1 hour in KRB with 16.7 mM glucose to determine 
664 
the stimulated insulin release. The stimulatory index was defined as the ratio of insulin 
665 
secretion at 16.7 mM to 2.8 mM glucose/hour and expressed as percentage of untreated 
666 
control. 
667 
 
668 
Animal experiments 
669 
All animal experiments were performed in mice on a C57BL/6N background unless otherwise 
670 
specified. Normal mice were obtained from Charles River. For the diet induced obesity (DIO) 
671 
experiments, 4 week old mice were fed a high fat diet (D12331, Research Diets; containing 
672 
58, 26 and 16 % calories from fat, carbohydrate and protein, respectively) for 20-25 weeks. 
673 
Leptin receptor deficient (db/db) mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories at the age 
674 
of 4 weeks and housed until the age of 16 weeks. Irak4-/- mice on a Balb/c background were 
675 
kindly provided by Amgen. IL1b-/- mice mouse strains on a C57BL/6N background produced 
676 
either by gene targeting52 or with Eucomm embryonal stem cells were used. To generate the 
677 
macrophage specific IL-1β knock-out mouse (Il1bfl/flLyz2-Cre+/-) chimeric mice were produced 
678 
from ES cells containing a modified Il1b allele, which contains loxP sites flanking exons 4 and 
679 
5 and a frt-LacZ-loxP-neo-Frt cassette introduced between exon 3 and 4 (Eucomm clone 
680 
HEPD0840_C04). Chimeric mice were then crossed with C57BL6/N mice and the offspring 
681 
with germ line transmission of the recombined allele were crossed with Flp deleter mice53 
682 
on Bl6/N background to excise the FRT flanked lacZ neo cassette and to obtain the Il1bfl/fl 
683 
mouse. These mice were next crossed with Lyz2-Cre mice54, that were previously 
684 
 30 
 
backcrossed to a C57BL6/N background. As littermate control mice we used the cre 
685 
recombinase negative Il1bfl/flLyz2-Cre-/- mice, and as myeloid cells specific Il1b-/- knock-out 
686 
mice the Il1bfl/flLyz2-Cre+/- mice (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Nlrp3-/- mice were generated as 
687 
described previously55. Rag2-/- mice were bred in house. Il1r1-/- mice and immunodeficient 
688 
female swiss nude were obtained from Charles River laboratories. Glpr-/-/Grp-/- mice were 
689 
generated as described56. 
690 
 
691 
All animal experiments were conducted according to the Swiss Veterinary Law and 
692 
Institutional Guidelines and were approved by the Swiss Authorities. All animals were 
693 
housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12 h light – 12 h dark cycle and had free 
694 
access to food and water.  
695 
 
696 
All metabolic experiments using transgenic mice were performed with wild-type littermates 
697 
as controls. The mice were between 12 and 29 weeks of age. Mice that did not gain weight 
698 
in diet-induced obesity experiments were excluded. All experiments were performed at least 
699 
twice with weight-matched mice and with at least a total of 4 animals per group. For drug 
700 
applications (apart from antibiotics treated mice that can receive commensal bacteria from 
701 
non treated controls) each cage included mice receiving all treatments in order to avoid cage 
702 
dependent differences. 
703 
 
704 
In vivo treatment administration 
705 
Recombinant mouse IL-1β (R&D) was injected i.p. at the indicated time and dose. 
706 
IL-1Ra (Anakinra; 10 mg/kg body weight) was injected i.p. 3 hours prior to intervention. 2-
707 
deoxyglucose (1 g per kg body weight) was injected i.p 1 hour prior to refeeding. 
708 
Canagliflozin (100 mg per kg body weight) or placebo control were homogenised and orally 
709 
 31 
 
administered 1 hour prior to refeeding. LPS (InvivoGen; 1 mg/kg body weight) was injected 
710 
i.p. at the indicated time. 
711 
 
712 
Glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) 
713 
For glucose tolerance testing, mice were fasted for 6 hours starting in the morning and 2 g 
714 
glucose per kg body weight was injected i.p. Blood glucose was measured using a 
715 
glucometer (Freestyle; Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.).  
716 
 
717 
Urine glucose levels 
718 
Glycosuria was assessed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Accu Check Diabur test 
719 
strips, Roche)  
720 
 
721 
Fasting and refeeding experiments 
722 
Before blood collection, fasted mice were provided free access to water but not to food for 
723 
12 hours. Refed mice were treated in the same manner as the fasted mice; however, prior to 
724 
blood collection, refed mice had access to food for 2 hours. In experiments done with 
725 
antibiotics or with IL-1Ra injection or with IL1b-/- mice and littermate wild-type mice, blood 
726 
was collected immediately before refeeding (time 0) and 2 hours after feeding. To avoid 
727 
potential confounding effects due to circadian-mediated fluctuation in circulating IL-1β 
728 
levels all experiments were performed at the same time of the day (between 8 to 10 am). 
729 
 
730 
Glucose clamp studies 
731 
Glucose clamp studies were performed in freely moving mice as previously described57. 
732 
Steady state glucose infusion rate was calculated once glucose infusion reached a constant 
733 
rate with blood glucose levels at 5 mmol/l (70-80 minutes after the start of insulin infusion). 
734 
Thereafter, blood glucose concentration was kept constant at 5 mmol/l for 15-20 minutes 
735 
 32 
 
and glucose infusion rate was calculated. Glucose disposal rate, and hepatic glucose 
736 
production were calculated as previously described57. 
737 
 
738 
Antibiotics treatment 
739 
One week before fasting-refeeding experiment, 1 g/l antibiotic concoction consisting of 
740 
vancomycin 10 mg/ml, neomycin 20 mg/ml, metronidazol 20 mg/ml (all purchased from 
741 
Sigma), was administered by gavage every 12 hours. Gavage volume of 5 ml/kg body weight 
742 
was delivered with a stainless steel tube. Fresh antibiotics concoction was mixed every day. 
743 
 
744 
Streptozotocin induced β-cell death and Islet transplantation. 
745 
Streptozotocin (Sigma) was dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5) and was i.p. injected to 
746 
immunodeficient nude mice at 240 mg/kg. Only hyperglycemic mice (i.e. blood glucose > 
747 
14mM) were subjected to transplantation with 500 wild-type or Il1r1-/- mouse islets, under 
748 
the kidney capsule as described in58.  
749 
 
750 
Macrophage ablation 
751 
Clodronate or PBS liposomes (ordered from ClodronateLiposomes.org) were injected i.p. 
752 
(100 μl per 10 grams bodyweight) 3 days before the start of the assays. Mice were sacrificed 
753 
at the end of the procedure. To verify macrophage depletion, peritoneal cells were isolated 
754 
as described above and analyzed by FACS as described below. Macrophages were defined as 
755 
CD11b+ F4/80+ double positive cells. 
756 
 
757 
Primary cell isolation and culture 
758 
Cells were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice following euthanasia in a CO2 chamber. To 
759 
obtain circulating leukocytes, the heart was punctured and the collected blood was 
760 
incubated briefly with red blood cells lysis buffer (154mM NH4Cl, 10mM KHCO3, 0.1mM 
761 
 33 
 
EDTA). To isolate macrophages, the peritoneum was infused with PBS containing 1% FBS and 
762 
the lavage was filtered through 70 µm cell strainer (BD). Kupffer cells were isolated from the 
763 
liver perfused with 3mL collagenase through the ductal vein followed by a 30 minute 
764 
incubation step and two centrifugation steps: 50 x g for 3 minutes at 4 oC, collection of the 
765 
upper phase and 350 x g for 5 minutes at 4oC. Intestinal macrophages were isolated after 
766 
removal of the intestinal payer patches, cut in pieces and washed twice (20 min shaking in 
767 
PBS, 5mM EDTA), followed by 30min incubation in collagenase type 4 (1.4 g/l). Cells from 
768 
omental and epididymal fat pads were isolated after shaking with collagenase type 4 (1.4 
769 
g/l) for 30 min at 37oC. Spleens were pushed through a 70 μm cell strainer and red cells were 
770 
lysed using lysis buffer (154mM NH4CL, 10mM KHCO3, 0.1mM EDTA). For islet resident 
771 
macrophages, handpicked pancreatic islets were dissociated by accutase (Biolegend, 50%, 2 
772 
minutes, 37 degrees) and washed. All cells were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer 
773 
washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS 0.5% BSA and 5mM EDTA). For macrophage 
774 
culture, cells were allowed to adhere for at least 4 hours in 48 or 96 well plates (TPP) and 
775 
non-adherent cells were washed away, naive macrophages were used for glucose uptake 
776 
assays or were polarized to M1 or M2 phenotypes as follows: 2 hours (serum free) or 16 
777 
hours treatment with LPS (100 ng/ml) + IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for M1 and IL-13 (10 ng/ml) + IL-4 
778 
(10 ng/ml) for M2 polarization, followed by 2 or 12 hours, with or without 1 μg/ml insulin in 
779 
the presence or absence of fasentin (50 μM; Sigma), 2-deoxyglucose (2DG; 10mM; Sigma), 
780 
mito-TEMPO (100 μM; Sigma), LY294002 (10 μM; Sigma), U0126 (10 μM; Sigma), rapamycin 
781 
(20 μM; Sigma) or followed by a 30 minute incubation with ATP (5mM; Sigma). Supernatants 
782 
were collected, centrifuged (at 4oC, 2000 x g for 5 minutes) and stored at -80oC and cells 
783 
were either harvested for RNA extraction (see RNA extraction and qPCR) or assayed by flow 
784 
cytometer for cell survival using Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (eBioscience).  
785 
 
786 
RNA extraction and qPCR 
787 
 34 
 
Total RNA was extracted using the Nucleo Spin RNA II Kit (Machery Nagel) or using RNeasy 
788 
Lipid Tissue (QIAGEN). RNA concentrations were normalized and cDNA was prepared with 
789 
random hexamers (Microsynth) and Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the instructions 
790 
of the supplier. RNA expression was determined with TaqMan assays and the real time PCR 
791 
system 7500 (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan assays were used:

Protein and protein-phosphorylation measurement assays 
800 
Insulin concentrations were determined using human insulin ultrasensitive ELISAs 
801 
(Mercodia) or mouse/rat insulin kits (Mesoscale Discovery). Mouse active GLP-1 was assayed 
802 
using a Mesoscale discovery kit. Protein phosphorylation was assayed using whole cell 
803 
lysates (10 μg total protein) and Mesoscale Discovery kinase phosphorylation assay kits (AKT 
804 
signalling panel; K15177D and MAP kinase panel; K15101D) according to manufacturer’s 
805 
instructions. Mouse cytokine concentrations were assayed using the V-plex mouse IL-1β 
806 
TNFα, IL-6, and CXCL1 kit from Mesoscale Discovery with the following modifications: for 
807 
circulating cytokine assay, after withdrawal, blood was incubated for 30 minutes at room 
808 
temperature and sera were collected after 20 minutes of centrifugation (4oC, 2000 x g). 
809 
Samples were incubated in the assay plate overnight at 4oC with gentle shaking. IL-1Ra was 
810 
determined using ELISA assays (R&D).  
811 
 
812 
Glucose bio-distribution assay 
813 
 35 
 
Male C57BL/6 mice were fasted for 3 hours in the morning, i.p. injected with IL-1β (1 μg/kg 
814 
body weight) or saline and 18 minutes later with 3H labeled 2-deoxy glucose (10 μCi per 
815 
mouse, Perkin Elmer). After 30 minutes mice were sacrificed, quadriceps muscle, epididymal 
816 
adipose tissue and spleen were weighed, washed immediately in ice cold PBS and incubated 
817 
with lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, 62.5mM Tris pH6.8, 6M 
818 
urea) followed by sonication. Leukocytes were isolated as described above, washed twice 
819 
with ice cold PBS, counted and lysed with 0.1% SDS. Triplicate samples were then measured 
820 
in a beta counter. Data are presented for organs as percentage beta counts per minute per 
821 
mg tissue and as beta counts per cell for Leukocytes. In experiments with refed mice, 
822 
fluorescent 2-deoxyglucose (2NBDG 500nmole per mouse; Invitrogen) was i.p. injected 
823 
immediately after a refeeding window. Mice were sacrificed 1 hour later, peritoneal cells 
824 
were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometer (BD Acurri). 
825 
 
826 
In vitro glucose uptake assay 
827 
For in vitro treatment, macrophages were pre-incubated for 2 hours with KRB containing 1 
828 
mM glucose (as described in GSIS section) with or without the indicated treatment. To 
829 
determine glucose uptake, macrophages were then incubated for 30 minutes with 0.4 nCi 3H 
830 
labeled 2-deoxy glucose (Perkin Elmer), washed twice with ice cold PBS, lysed with 0.1 % SDS 
831 
and transferred into scintillation fluid. 3H labeled 2-deoxy glucose uptake was measured in a 
832 
beta counter. 
833 
 
834 
Immunoblotting 
835 
We separated proteins (8-12 μg) in 4-12 % NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), blotted them onto 
836 
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated them with antibodies against total AKT 
837 
(pan AKT; #4691), pAKT (s473; #9271) and Insulin receptor β (4B8; #3025.) All antibodies 
838 
 36 
 
were purchased from Cell Signaling. Blots were analyzed using image lab 4.1 software (Bio-
839 
Rad).  
840 
 
841 
Flow cytometry 
842 
To obtain single cells, islets were dispersed with trypsin (Invitrogen) for 6 minutes at 37°C, 
843 
washed with PBS, centrifuged at 300 x g, 5 minutes, 4oC and resuspended in FACS buffer 
844 
(PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). After 15 minutes incubation with an Fc blocker (Anti-
845 
mouse CD16/CD32; eBioscience 14-0161) peritoneal cells or single islet cells were stained 
846 
with the appropriate antibodies for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark. To verify the effect of the 
847 
clodronate depletion, cells from Rag-/- mice were stained with anti F4/80 (clone BM8) and 
848 
anti CD11b (clone M1/70). To determine the peritoneal cell composition, cells were stained 
849 
with anti CD3e (clone 145-2C11), anti GR-1 (clone RB6-8C5), anti CD11b (clone M1/70), anti 
850 
F4/80- (clone BM8), anti CD19 (clone RA3-6B2) and anti Siglec-F-APC (clone E50-2440). 
851 
Single cells from adipose tissue, islets, Liver, small intestine, and colon were stained with 
852 
CD45 (clone 30-F11) for immune cells (antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, Siglec-F 
853 
was purchased from BD Pharmingen). For additional intra-cellular Insulin receptor intensity 
854 
in tissue resident macrophages, cells were also incubated with intracellular fixation buffer 
855 
(eBioscience) following incubation with permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) according to 
856 
manufacturer’s instructions. Anti InsR β (Cell Signaling; 3025S) was added following 
857 
secondary conjugated donkey anti rabbit antibody (Invitrogen). Stained cells were washed 
858 
twice with FACS buffer prior to FACS acquisition. Cells were analyzed with an Accuri C6 flow 
859 
cytometer or LSR-Fortessa (BD Bioscience). Dispersed islet cells were analyzed and sorted 
860 
with a FACS ARIA III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) using FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). 
861 
All samples were stained with appropriate isotype control antibodies; viability staining was 
862 
done using 7-AAD (Sigma) or DAPI (Biolegend). Macrophages were defined as CD11b+ F4/80+ 
863 
double positive cells. Data were analyzed using Flow Jo 9.4 software (Tree Star).  
864 
 37 
 
 
865 
Extracellular acidification measurements 
866 
An XF24 or an XF96e Extracellular Flux analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) was used to 
867 
determine the bioenergetic profile of FACS sorted macrophages (F4/80 and CD11b double 
868 
positive peritoneal cells). Cells were plated at a density of 500’000 or 300’000 cells per well 
869 
in XF24 or XF96 plate accordingly, incubated for 4 hours and washed before being 
870 
stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) + IFNγ (10 ng/ml) or IL-4\IL-13 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated 
871 
times. Insulin was injected or added to the media (1 μg/ml end concentration) for the 
872 
indicated time. Prior to the assay, cells were incubated in unbuffered RPMI (Seahorse 
873 
Biosciences) containing 11.1 mM glucose for 1 hour. Then extracellular acidification rate 
874 
were assessed during 2 minutes. Basal measurements were followed by measurements 
875 
upon injection of the following agents: Glucose (26.8 mM), oligomycin (1 μM), 
876 
carbonilcyanide p-triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (2 μM), rotenone (1 μM), and 2-
877 
deoxyglucose (2DG; 10mM). To activate cells with insulin during Seahorse measurments cells 
878 
were incubated in unbuffered RPMI containing 5mM glucose for 1 hour, then extracellular 
879 
acidification rate were assessed during 2 minutes for 6 basal measurements followed by 
880 
injections of inhibitors (LY294002, 10 μM; U0126, 10 μM) or DMSO as control and insulin (1 
881 
μg/ml). Oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone were purchased from Sigma. 
882 
 
883 
Immunofluorescence staining 
884 
Pancreata were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4oC, followed by paraffin 
885 
embedding. Sections were deparaffinized, re-hydrated and incubated 1 hour at room 
886 
temperature with guinea pig anti-insulin antibody (Dako; A0564), followed by detection with 
887 
a fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig antibody (Dako). Subsequently, the sections 
888 
were labeled for IL-1R1 with goat anti IL-1-R1 antibody (R&D; AF771), followed by detection 
889 
with a fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Invitrogen).

891 
Statistics 
892 
Appropriate statistical tests were performed where required. Comparisons between groups 
893 
were performed using unpaired, two-sided t-test for normally distributed data. For grouped 
894 
comparisons, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons 
895 
analysis were used where appropriate. Statistically significant outliers were assessed using 
896 
ROUT's test (O = 1%) and were excluded from analysis. Data analysis was performed using 
897 
GraphPad Prism v7.0a Software Excluding diet induced obesity experiments, all animal 
898 
studies were performed on weight matched mice. There was no other prior randomization 
899 
or blinding. Data are expressed as means ± s.e.m. and statistical significance is denoted as *P 
900 
< 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and, ****P < 0.0001. n numbers indicate biological 
901 
replicates for in vitro experiments or number of mice for in vivo experiments.
