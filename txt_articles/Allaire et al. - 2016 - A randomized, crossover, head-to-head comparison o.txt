ABSTRACT
Background: To date, most studies on the anti-inflammatory effects
of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in
humans have used a mixture of the 2 fatty acids in various forms
and proportions.
Objectives: We compared the effects of EPA supplementation with
those of DHA supplementation (re-esterified triacylglycerol; 90% pure)
on inflammation markers (primary outcome) and blood lipids (second-
ary outcome) in men and women at risk of cardiovascular disease.
Design: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, controlled study,
healthy men (n = 48) and women (n = 106) with abdominal obesity
and low-grade systemic inflammation consumed 3 g/d of the follow-
ing supplements for periods of 10 wk: 1) EPA (2.7 g/d), 2) DHA
(2.7 g/d), and 3) corn oil as a control with each supplementation sep-
arated by a 9-wk washout period. Primary analyses assessed the
difference in cardiometabolic outcomes between EPA and DHA.
Results: Supplementation with DHA compared with supplementa-
tion with EPA led to a greater reduction in interleukin-18 (IL-18)
(27.0% 6 2.8% compared with 20.5% 6 3.0%, respectively; P =
0.01) and a greater increase in adiponectin (3.1% 6 1.6% compared
with 21.2% 6 1.7%, respectively; P , 0.001). Between DHA and
EPA, changes in CRP (27.9% 6 5.0% compared with 21.8% 6
6.5%, respectively; P = 0.25), IL-6 (212.0% 6 7.0% compared
with 213.4% 6 7.0%, respectively; P = 0.86), and tumor necrosis
factor-a (214.8% 6 5.1% compared with 27.6% 6 10.2%, re-
spectively; P = 0.63) were NS. DHA compared with EPA led
to more pronounced reductions in triglycerides (213.3% 6 2.3%
compared with 211.9% 6 2.2%, respectively; P = 0.005) and the
cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (22.5% 6 1.3% compared with
0.3% 6 1.1%, respectively; P = 0.006) and greater increases in
HDL cholesterol (7.6% 6 1.4% compared with 20.7% 6 1.1%, re-
spectively; P , 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (6.9% 6 1.8% compared
with 2.2% 6 1.6%, respectively; P = 0.04). The increase in LDL-
cholesterol concentrations for DHA compared with EPAwas significant
in men but not in women (P-treatment 3 sex interaction = 0.046).
Conclusions: DHA is more effective than EPA in modulating spe-
cific markers of inflammation as well as blood lipids. Additional
studies are needed to determine the effect of a long-term DHA
supplementation per se on cardiovascular disease risk. This trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01810003.

INTRODUCTION
Subclinical inflammation is recognized as a key etiologic factor
in the development of atherosclerosis that leads to ischemic heart
disease (IHD).8 (1, 2). There is a growing body of literature that
has suggested that long-chain v-3 (n–3) PUFAs (LCn–3PUFAs),
primarily EPA (20:5n–3) and DHA (22:6n–3), may attenuate the
proinflammatory state that is associated with obesity and meta-
bolic syndrome (MetS) (3). In that regard, a number of mechanisms
supporting the purported anti-inflammatory effects of LCn–3PUFAs
have been proposed. These mechanisms include the inhibition of

 the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor kB in various
tissues through a series of metabolic cascades involving the acti-
vation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-g and several
other signaling proteins (4).
A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
substantiated the anti-inflammatory effect of LCn–3PUFA sup-
plementation as evidenced by significant reductions in plasma
C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and TNF-a concentrations (5).
This analysis was based on data from 68 RCTs and 4601 indi-
viduals with or without chronic nonautoimmune diseases such
as dyslipidemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and MetS. The meta-
analysis revealed significant research gaps pertaining to the
effects of LCn–3PUFAs on inflammation markers. Most im-
portantly, almost all of the RCTs available thus far have either
used a mix of EPA and DHA in various ratios or have investi-
gated only one of the 2 LCn–3PUFAs. The use of these methods
is not a trivial issue considering that DHA appears to be more
potent than is EPA in modulating plasma lipid concentrations
(6). Therefore, it remains largely unknown whether EPA and
DHA have similar or different effects on markers of inflam-
mation. Other significant shortcomings have included the fact
that almost all of the available RCTs to date were not designed
a priori to investigate the effect of EPA or DHA on markers of
subclinical inflammation as a primary outcome and were also
based on sample sizes that may have been too small to yield
robust results. Finally, whether sex influences the efficacy of EPA
and DHA to modulate markers of inflammation is an area of great
interest that remains speculative. Addressing these gaps has im-
portant public health implications considering that EPA plus DHA
supplements are broadly recommended by various health agencies,
including the American Heart Association (7), for IHD risk pre-
vention or the management of triglycerides.
The Comparing EPA to DHA Study is a double-blind, random-
ized, crossover, controlled study that was specifically designed to
compare the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammation markers in
individuals with abdominal obesity and subclinical inflammation.
As a secondary objective, we compared the effects of EPA and
DHA on plasma lipids and verified if responses to EPA and DHA
in men and women are similar. We hypothesized that DHA is
more potent than is EPA in modulating inflammatory markers and
plasma lipid concentrations. However, on the basis of evidence
that suggested that platelet aggregation is more responsive to EPA
in men and to DHA in women (8), we also hypothesized that EPA
supplementation induces a greater anti-inflammatory response
than does DHA in men, whereas women are more responsive to
supplementation with DHA.
METHODS
Study design
This study used a double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-
over design with 3 treatment phases as follows: 1) EPA, 2) DHA,
and 3) corn oil as a control. Each treatment phase had a median
duration of 10 wk. The median washout time between treat-
ments was 9 wk. The random assignment of participants to one
of 6 treatment sequences was performed with the use of an in-
house computer program and was stratified by sex. Allocations to
treatments were concealed from participants, study coordinators,
and laboratory technicians throughout the study. Codes were
unconcealed after all primary statistical analyses had been com-
pleted. Participants were supplemented with 3 identical 1-g capsules
of .90% fish oils/d that provided 2.7 g EPA/d, 2.7 g DHA/d, and
0 g EPA and DHA/d (3 g corn oil was used as the control). Sup-
plements were formulated as re-esterified triacylglycerol and pro-
vided by Douglas Laboratories. Participants were instructed to
maintain a constant body weight during the course of the study.
Subjects were also counseled about how to exclude fatty fish
(including salmon, tuna, mackerel, and herring), fish-oil supple-
ments, flax products, walnuts, and v-3–enriched products during the
3 study phases. Vitamin supplements and natural health products
were allowed at a stable dose. Alcohol consumption was permitted
during the study of intakes that did not exceed 1 or 2 servings
alcohol/d (12–15 g alcohol/d) but was forbidden during the 4 d that
preceded blood draws. Subjects were also instructed to maintain
their usual physical activity except during the 4 d that preceded
blood sampling at the various stages of the study during which they
were asked not to engage in any form of vigorous physical activity.
Study population
The a priori–defined eligibility criterion was to have MetS as
per the International Diabetes Federation definition (9). How-
ever, this criterion was modified 2 mo into recruitment because
of unforeseen difficulties in achieving the intended sample size
with the use of such a criterion (eligibility rate was 2.4% on the
basis of 170 screens). Eligibility criteria were modified to in-
clude having abdominal obesity per International Diabetes Fed-
eration sex-specific cutoffs ($80 cm for women; $94 cm for men)
(9) in combination with a screening plasma CRP concentration .1
but ,10 mg/L. Subjects had to be otherwise healthy. These new
criteria were consistent with the primary aim of the study, which
was to compare the effects of EPA and DHA supplementation on
markers of inflammation. Subjects were recruited at the Institute
of Nutrition and Functional Foods via the media (newspaper and
radio) and electronic newsletters. Subjects had to be aged be-
tween 18 and 70 y and have stable body weight for $3 mo before
random assignment. In premenopausal women, only those in-
dividuals with a regular menstrual cycle (25–35 d) for the past
3 mo were included. Follicle-stimulating hormone measurements
were performed when needed to confirm the premenopausal
status (follicle-stimulating hormone concentration ,25 IU/L) (10).
Women who were using contraceptive agents were eligible. The
use of contraceptive agents was documented and adjusted for
if required (see Statistical analyses section). Evidence has sug-
gested that phases of the menstrual cycle have little effects on
markers of inflammation (11), and therefore, collections of sam-
ples were not adjusted for the menstrual cycle. Exclusion criteria
were a plasma CRP concentration .10 mg/L at screening, ex-
treme dyslipidemias such as familial hypercholesterolemia, having
a personal history of cardiovascular diseases (IHD, cerebrovas-
cular disease, or peripheral arterial disease), taking medications
or substances known to affect inflammation (e.g., taking steroids
or binging alcohol), and the use of LCn–3PUFA supplements
#2 mo of study onset. Postmenopausal women who were re-
ceiving hormone replacement therapy at a stable dose were in-
cluded (12). All participants signed an informed consent document
that was approved by the local ethics committees at the begin-
ning of the study, and the study protocol was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01810003) on 4 March 2013.
EPA, DHA, AND SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION

 Anthropometric measures
Anthropometric measures, including waist and hip circumfer-
ences, were obtained according to standardized procedures (13).
Body composition was measured with the use of dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (GE Healthcare).
Risk factor assessment
Plasma CRP concentrations were measured with the use of the
Behring Latex-Enhanced highly sensitive assay on the Behring
Nephelometer BN-100 system (Behring Diagnostic) and the
calibrators (N Rheumatology Standards SL) provided by the
manufacturer as described previously (14). Other inflammation
markers were measured with the use of commercial ELISA kits
for the human form of the cytokine as follows: IL-6 and TNF-a
(HS600B and HSTA00D; R&D Systems), IL-18 (7620; MBL
International), and adiponectin (K1001-1; B-Bridge International).
Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol were
assessed on a Roche/Hitachi Modular system (Roche Diagnos-
tics) according to the manufacturer’s specifications and with the
use of proprietary reagents. Plasma LDL-cholesterol concen-
trations were calculated with the use of Friedewald’s equation.
Total plasma apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations were mea-
sures with the use of a commercial ELISA kit (A70102; Alerchek
Inc.). CVs for each analyte are shown in Supplemental Table 1.
Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,
apoB, CRP, IL-6, and adiponectin were measured twice on con-
secutive days at the end of each treatment to reduce variation and,
hence, increase statistical power. The mean of the 2 measurements
were used in the analyses. Analyses for TNF-a and IL-18 were
based on a single measure posttreatment. Treatment-specific base-
line values were measured once. All personnel involved in the
measurements of study outcomes were blinded to treatments.
Compliance
Compliance to supplementation was assessed by counting sup-
plements that were returned to study coordinators by participants.
Subjects with compliance ,80% during any given treatment were
considered to be noncompliant, and data from that particular
treatment were excluded from analyses. EPA and DHA contents in
plasma phospholipids were also used as another proxy of com-
pliance in a randomly selected subsample of participants (n = 30;
15 women and 15 men). EPA and DHA contents of plasma
phospholipids were measured before and after treatments as
described previously (15). The fatty acid composition of plasma
phospholipids was expressed as a percentage of all fatty acids.
The concurrent use of a medication during the experimental
protocol was tracked with the use of checklists. Participants were
asked to notify the physician in charge of the clinical aspects of the
study before the initiation of any medication. Variations in dietary
habits during the intervention were monitored with the use of a val-
idated quantitative web-based food-frequency questionnaire at
the end of each treatment phase (16). Usual physical activity was
monitored with the use of a 3-d validated physical activity journal (17).
Sample-size calculation
A priori sample-size calculations indicated that n = 150 in-
dividuals would allow us to detect a minimal difference of 10%
in plasma CRP concentrations when any 2 treatments were com-
pared with a power of 81% and P , 0.01 (2 tailed) (18). CRP was
used as the primary outcome measure for sample-size calculations
because it is considered a key variable for the assessment of the
inflammatory status in clinical practice (19). A 10% reduction in
plasma CRP was considered to be of clinical relevance on the
basis of several epidemiologic studies that have shown a linear
relation between CRP and risk of IHD (19). The power to detect
a significant treatment 3 sex interaction was estimated with the
use of the GLMPower procedure in SAS software (v9.3; SAS
Institute Inc.) with treatment, sex, and treatment 3 sex as main
effects. On the basis of SD estimates (35%) and with consid-
eration of a sample size of 150 individuals equally distributed
between men and women, the power was 80% to detect a signifi-
cant treatment 3 sex interaction (P , 0.05) for a reduction in
plasma CRP, compared with the control value, that was $10% with
treatment A (no change with treatment B) in men and $10% with
treatment B (no change with treatment A) in women. The minimal
detectable difference between treatments in plasma CRP within
each sex was 11.5% [power: 80%; P ,0.05 (2-tailed); with n = 75
in each group]. The anticipated sample size provided high statistical
power to investigate changes in lipid concentrations (not shown).
Statistical analyses
Differences in study outcomes between treatments were as-
sessed with the use of the MIXED procedure for repeated measures
in the SAS program (v9.4) with treatment, sex, and the treatment 3
sex interaction (when significant) as fixed effects and a compound
symmetry or autoregressive covariance matrix to account for
within-subject correlations. The change of each treatment com-
pared with the control value (posttreatment EPA minus control and
DHA minus control) was used as the dependent variable in all
analyses as per our a priori–defined analytic plan (20). To be in-
cluded in the analyses, subjects had to have completed the control
phase plus $1 of the 2 treatment phases. With this approach, the
main treatment effect in the mixed models reflected the direct
comparison of EPA and DHA and was considered the primary
analysis. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was not necessary
because the main treatment effect had only 2 levels. In the same
model and as secondary analyses, the change for each treatment
compared with the control value was tested against the null
hypothesis by the LSMEANS statement in the MIXED pro-
cedure. Potential confounders of the outcome measure response to
treatment, mainly obesity and body fat status, age, use of con-
traceptive agents (premenopausal women), menopausal status,
energy and nutrient intakes, and the sequence of treatments,
were considered by integrating interaction terms with the main
treatment effect into the mixed models. Results from analyses
that were based on the most parsimonious models (i.e., retaining
only the variables that contributed significantly to variations in
any given study outcome) are shown. All primary statistical anal-
yses were undertaken in a blinded fashion with the use of study
codes for each treatment. The skewness in the distribution of all
study outcomes was considered, and data were transformed
when required. In the case of the CRP analysis per se, missing
values were attributed when the mean of the 2 consecutive
posttreatment CRP values was .10 mg/L. Because the MIXED
procedure is robust to missing data, analyses were first conducted
without the multiple imputation of missing data (21). However,

 we also analyzed the study results with the use of an intent-to-
treat (ITT) approach with the multiple imputation of missing
data. Comparisons between treatments (significant compared with
NS) were unchanged in the ITT analysis with only slightly
larger P values with the ITT approach for the significance of the
treatment effect for IL-18 and adiponectin. Details are provided
in Supplemental Table 2.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of subjects
Figure 1 represents the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials flow diagram of the study (22), which was initiated on 3
April 2013 and was completed on 19 June 2015. Of 173 eligible
men and women, a total of 154 subjects were randomly assigned
to treatment sequences. The dropout rate was 20% (n = 31 of
154 randomly assigned participants). Treatment-specific data of
participants with compliance ,80% (n = 2 for the EPA treat-
ment compared with the control) were excluded from analyses.
Characteristics at the screening visit of the 154 subjects randomly
assigned into the study are shown by sex (n = 48 for men; n = 106
for women) in Table 1. Sixty-six percent of women were post-
menopausal, of whom 23% were receiving hormonotherapy.
Seventy-two percent of premenopausal women were using con-
traceptive agents. As per the inclusion criteria, all subjects had
a high waist circumference ($94 cm for men and $80 cm for
women) and an elevated plasma CRP concentration as a group
but were otherwise healthy. There was no difference in the base-
line characteristics of participants between treatments (Sup-
plemental Table 3). We showed marginal differences concerning
dietary intakes of fibers, proteins, EPA, and DHA as well as
a significant difference in alcohol consumption between treat-
ments (Supplemental Table 4). However, such differences in
nutrient intakes had no effect on study outcomes (P . 0.05) and
thus were not included in the final mixed models.
Compliance to treatments and side effects
The mean compliance to supplementation during each treat-
ment phase that was based on returned capsules was high (control:
97% 6 5%; EPA: 97% 6 6%; DHA: 96% 6 5%) and not sig-
nificantly different between treatments (Kruskal-Wallis test: P =
0.17). The plasma phospholipid fatty acid composition that was
measured posttreatment is presented in Supplemental Table 5.
The phospholipid fatty acid profile tracked well with each sup-
plementation phases, which also reflected a high compliance with
treatments. Changes in plasma phospholipid concentrations of
EPA, docosapentaenoic acid, and DHA after each treatment were
similar between men and women with the exception of plasma
docosapentaenoic acid concentrations, which were higher in men
than in women after EPA supplementation (2.56% 6 0.11%
FIGURE 1
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials chart of study subjects. After a telephone screening of 786 subjects, 441 individuals did not meet
the inclusion criteria. Of 345 eligible subjects, 55 individuals declined to take part in the study because of time commitments, and 290 individuals underwent
a clinical assessment. Of 173 eligible subjects, 154 participants were randomly assigned. The dropout rate was 20% (31 of 154 subjects who were randomly
assigned). The completion rate varied by phases because of the randomized crossover nature of the study (not shown). After considering dropouts and subjects
who were excluded because of compliance that was judged to be ,80% (n = 2 for the EPA treatment), the analysis of DDHA (DHA compared with control)
was based on n = 123, and the analysis of the DEPA was based on n = 121. CRP, C-reactive protein.

 compared with 2.10% 6 0.07%, respectively; P = 0.01). There
was no difference in the frequency of self-reported side effects
between treatments (Supplemental Table 6).
There was no difference between EPA, DHA, and the control
in posttreatment body mass index, waist circumference, and
percentages of fat and android fat (data not shown). Table 2
presents absolute changes in study outcomes after EPA and
DHA treatment compared with control values, whereas Figure 2
depicts treatment-specific changes in relative terms.
Inflammation markers
Compared with the EPA treatment, supplementation with
DHA led to a greater reduction in serum IL-18 (P = 0.01) and
a greater increase in adiponectin (P , 0.001) (Table 2, Figure
2). Changes in serum concentrations of CRP (P = 0.25), IL-6
(P = 0.86), and TNF-a (P = 0.63) were not different between
DHA and EPA treatments. Compared with the control, EPA sig-
nificantly decreased plasma IL-6 concentrations (213.4%) but had
no significant effect on other inflammation markers. Compared
with the control, DHA supplementation significantly decreased
plasma CRP (27.9%), IL-6 (212.0%), IL-18 (27.0%), and
TNF-a (214.8%) concentrations and increased adiponectin
concentrations (+3.1%). There was no significant treatment 3
sex interaction in the response of inflammation markers to EPA
and DHA.
Blood lipids
Compared with the EPA treatment, supplementation with DHA
reduced triglycerides (P = 0.005), the cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol
ratio (P = 0.006), and increased serum concentrations of HDL
cholesterol (P , 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.04) (Table 2,
Figure 2). There was a treatment 3 sex interaction (P = 0.0455) in
the LDL-cholesterol response to EPA and DHA (Figure 3). DHA
supplementation increased LDL cholesterol more than did EPA

2P values for EPA and DHA changes compared with control values in the outcome were determined with the use of the LSMEANS statement and were
tested against the null hypothesis in mixed models (SAS v9.4; SAS Institute Inc.).
3Adjustment for potential covariates (sex, age, weight, waist circumference, menopausal status, value of control treatment, treatment-specific baseline
value, and sequence of treatments) was considered only when the covariates were shown to be significant at P , 0.05 in mixed models.
4Main treatment P values for the comparison between EPA and DHA changes compared with control values in the outcome were determined with the use
of the main treatment effect in mixed models. The mixed model for the main effect for the comparison of DEPA and DDHA was based on n = 123 observations
with the exclusion of DEPA data for 2 participants because of low compliance.
5Log-transformed data were used in these analyses because of the skewness of distributions of posttreatment values.
6n = 117 for the control. Because of exclusions that were due to CRP concentrations .10 mg/L after the treatment phase, n = 110 for EPA changes from
control values, and n = 111 for DHA changes from control values.

 in men (12.5% compared with 5.1%) but not in women (4.4%
compared with 3.0%). No significant difference between DHA
and EPA was observed for total apoB concentrations. Compared
with the control, EPA supplementation significantly decreased
plasma triglycerides (211.9%) and increased LDL cholesterol
concentrations (+2.2%) but had no significant effect on other
lipid variables (Table 2, Figure 2). In contrast, supplementation
with DHA compared with the control significantly increased
total cholesterol (+3.8%), LDL cholesterol (+6.9%), total apoB
(+4.5%) and HDL cholesterol (+7.6%) and significantly re-
duced serum triglycerides (213.3%) and the cholesterol:HDL-
cholesterol ratio (22.5%).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that was
designed specifically to provide a head-to-head comparison of the
effects of EPA and DHA on inflammation markers as a primary
outcome in both men and women. Data indicate that DHA may be
more effective than EPA in attenuating systemic inflammation and
modulating plasma lipid risk factors in healthy men and women
with abdominal obesity and subclinical systemic inflammation.
LCn–3PUFAs and markers of inflammation
The current study addressed key research gaps pertaining to the
effect of LCn–3PUFAs on surrogate markers of inflammation.
Previous RCTs on the topic have yielded inconsistent results
because of a number of experimental and methodologic factors
(5, 23). First and foremost, most of the available RCTs in healthy
subjects or in subjects who were at risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) investigated the effect of LCn–3PUFAs on inflammation
markers as a secondary outcome and not as the primary outcome.
In the meta-analysis by Li et al. (5), only one study provided
a head-to-head comparison of EPA and DHA on inflammation
markers in the 68 RCTs reviewed. The study, in patients with
type 2 diabetes, showed no significant effect of EPA or DHA
supplementation (4 g/d for 6 wk) on CRP, IL-6, and TNF-a con-
centrations but was based on a sample of only 25 patients/group
(24). Two recent studies have compared EPA and DHA directly
(,2 g/d) and showed no significant effect on CRP and proin-
flammatory cytokines (25, 26). These parallel-arm studies com-
prised ,20 subjects/group and, therefore, were also clearly
underpowered to yield robust results. These examples emphasize
how studies thus far, in almost all cases, were not adequately
designed to specifically investigate markers of inflammation. In
that context, results from this large RCT provide novel and
meaningful information to our knowledge.
Supplementation with DHA (2.7 g/d) for 10 wk decreased
serum IL-18 and increased adiponectin significantly more than
did supplementation with EPA (2.7 g/d). Also, the reduction in
plasma CRP concentrations with DHA compared with control oil
was almost 4-fold greater in magnitude than the reduction with
EPA although this difference did not reach significance. The data
confirm the indirect evidence from the meta-analysis by Li et al.
(5), which suggested that the anti-inflammatory effects of mixed
LCn–3PUFAs seen in previous studies may have been attributable
to DHA. Results from a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs suggested
a modest increase in plasma adiponectin concentrations with
LCn–3PUFA supplementation (27), but our data indicate that this
effect may also be attributable more specifically to DHA.
Mendelian randomization studies have indicated that increased
plasma CRP concentrations are unlikely to be even a modest
causal factor for CVD (28). This suggestion does not rule out the
importance of inflammation in the etiology of atherosclerosis and
resulting CVD (2). Data from the Justification for the Use of
Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating
Rosuvastatin trial have shown that the statin treatment of patients
with low LDL-cholesterol concentrations but with subclinical
inflammation (CRP concentration .2 mg/L) was highly effec-
tive in reducing risk of vascular events, myocardial infarction,
and stroke (29). Data from the current study indicate that DHA
compared with the control corn oil is effective in reducing
plasma concentrations of several inflammation markers (IL-6,
IL-18, and TNF-a) in addition to CRP. IL-18 is expressed in
human atheroma where it influences the expression of adhesion
molecules, chemokines, cytokines and matric metalloproteinases.
IL-6 is involved in the acute-phase response by inducing the
production of CRP and other inflammatory markers in the liver.
The expression of IL-6 is also stimulated in smooth muscle cells
by circulating IL-18 and other cytokines (30). Changes in each
of these surrogate markers suggest significant effects of DHA on
a variety of inflammation processes. EPA enhances the synthesis
of the E-series resolvins, whereas DHA leads to the production
of the D-series resolvins in addition to enhancing the synthesis of
protectins and maresins, all of which may have different anti-
inflammatory properties. Although relatively well characterized in
cell and animal models (31), the potentially distinct contributions
of resolvins from EPA and protectins and maresins from DHA on
inflammation processes have not been well characterized in vivo
in humans (4, 23).
Although supplementation with a mixture of EPA and DHA
may activate the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-a
pathway in both sexes, the nuclear transcription factor kB pathway

(DEPA compared with DDHA) by sex. **P , 0.05 for within-treatment effects
(compared with control values) determined with the use of LSMEANS state-
ments in the mixed models. For men, n = 36 for EPA changes from control
values, and n = 37 for DHA changes from control values. For women, because
of missing data, n = 85 for EPA changes from control values, and n = 86 for
DHA changes from control values.

 appears to be activated in men only (32), which suggests that men
and women may respond differently to EPA and DHA supple-
mentation. Our results are not consistent with these data or with
our a priori hypothesis that there is a sex-specific anti-inflammatory
response to EPA and DHA.
LCn–3PUFA and plasma lipids
A meta-analysis of RCTs that compared the effect of different
doses of EPA and DHA on blood lipids has been published (6). In
the 21 studies included in the meta-analysis, 10 studies compared
EPAwith a control, 17 studies compared DHAwith a control, and
only 6 studies compared EPA with DHA directly. Results from
our own study are consistent with specific analyses of these 6
head-to-head comparison studies of EPA and DHA in showing
significantly greater reduction in plasma triglycerides and sig-
nificantly greater increases in plasma LDL cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol with DHA than with EPA. The fact that the LDL-
cholesterol–raising effect of DHA seems to be more pronounced
in men than in women deserves further investigation. We showed
that the increase in total plasma apoB after DHA supplementation
was one-half that of LDL cholesterol. This result, combined with
a greater reduction in serum triglycerides, suggests an increase in
the LDL particle size with DHA as well (33). This assumption
needs to be verified by proper measures of the change in LDL
particle size with EPA and DHA.
This study has several strengths but also some limitations that
need to be outlined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
largest crossover-design study to provide a head-to-head com-
parison of the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory markers
as a primary outcome. The repeated measures after treatment re-
duced the intraindividual variability of the results and, hence, in-
creased the statistical power. The use of corn oil as a control may
have blunted the effects of EPA and DHA on some of the study
outcomes. However, many previous RCTs used various veg-
etable oils as a control, and to that extent, our study design was
similar to that of previous studies on this topic (5). Compared
with baseline values, corn-oil supplementation decreased total
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations but had no effect
on other markers in this study (data not shown). Concentrations
of EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipids were measured only
posttreatment, and hence, it was not possible to verify that the
values had returned to baseline concentrations after each washout
period. However, concentrations of blood lipids and inflamma-
tory markers were similar at baseline in the 3 treatments (Sup-
plemental Table 3). There was also no significant sequence-
by-treatment interaction on the study outcomes. These results
provide convincing evidence of no residual or carryover effects of
a treatment onto the subsequent treatment. The 20% dropout rate
remains acceptable for a crossover study of a total duration of
46 wk. Also, the number of subjects who were eligible for statistical
analyses was lower than our sample-size target, which implied
that detectable effect sizes were slightly larger than anticipated.
Inflammation markers are known to be sensitive to acute immune
challenges. However, sensitivity analyses that excluded values
greater than the 95th percentile for each risk factor had no effect
on the results (not shown), which made the results quite robust.
The use of mixed models compared with an ITT approach for the
analysis of data from RCTs is a controversial issue. Nevertheless,
both methods yielded almost identical results, which supported
the robustness of the experimental data.
In conclusion, data from this carefully controlled RCT
indicate that DHA supplementation at a dose of w3 g/d for 10
wk may be more potent in modulating inflammation markers
than would be a similar dose of EPA in men and women with
abdominal obesity and subclinical systemic inflammation but
who are otherwise healthy. To our knowledge, these are im-
portant new data because most available studies have been un-
dertaken with the use of mixtures of various ratios of EPA and
DHA. Consistent with previous studies, DHA was also more
potent than EPA in modulating lipid risk factors. The extent to
which such differences between EPA and DHA in modulating lipid
and inflammation risk factors are meaningful in terms of CVD-risk
prevention remains unclear and need to be investigated in the
future.
