In 2012, approximately 40,000 suicides were reported in the 
United States, making suicide the 10th leading reported cause 
of death for persons aged ≥16 years (1). From 2000 to 2012, 
rates of suicide among persons in this age group increased 
21.1%, from 13.3 per 100,000 to 16.1 (1). To inform suicide 
prevention efforts, CDC analyzed suicide by occupational 
group, by ascribing occupational codes to 12,312 suicides in 
17 states in 2012 from the National Violent Death Reporting 
System (NVDRS) (2). The frequency of suicide in different 
occupational groups was examined, and rates of suicide were 
calculated by sex and age group for these categories. Persons 
working in the farming, fishing, and forestry group had the 
highest rate of suicide overall (84.5 per 100,000 population) 
and among males (90.5); the highest rates of suicide among 
females occurred among those working in protective service 
occupations (14.1). Overall, the lowest rate of suicide (7.5) 
was found in the education, training, and library occupational 
group. Suicide prevention approaches directed toward persons 
aged ≥16 years that enhance social support, community con-
nectedness, access to preventive services, and the reduction of 
stigma and barriers to help-seeking are needed.
CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) 
collects information on violent deaths, including suicides, 
from multiple sources, including death certificates, coroner 
and medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports, 
to monitor trends, understand violent death characteristics 
and risk factors, and inform prevention efforts (2). The most 
recent NVDRS data set available for analysis (2012) includes 
data from 17 states.*
NVDRS Occupation Title and Industry Title fields were 
used to assign each suicide decedent to one of the major 
occupational groups defined by the national Standard 
Occupational Classification (SOC) system (3). The dece-
dent’s usual occupation at the time of death was coded, and 
each decedent was assigned to only one occupational group. 
Additional codes for decedents who were classified as home-
makers/housewives, students, never worked/disabled (and not 
working), retired, prisoners, unemployed, and self-employed 
(unspecified industry) were created by the authors.
Decedents were assigned to SOC codes using three steps. 
First, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health’s Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding 
System (NIOCCS) (4) was applied to the 12,312 suicides 
in the data set, resulting in SOC codes for 5,532 (44.9%) 
decedents (Figure). NIOCCS matched the industry and occu-
pation text fields to U.S. Census Industry and Occupation 
codes†; these were mapped to detailed SOC codes, which 
the authors collapsed into major SOC occupational groups. 
Next, a computer algorithm (developed based on a review of 
* Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South 
Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

cases for which a SOC code was not provided by NIOCCS) 
was used to produce codes for an additional 4,572 (37.1%) 
decedents.§ Finally, manual coding by the authors was used 
for the remaining 2,208 (17.9%) decedents (Figure). For 
729 (5.9%) decedents, the occupation fields were blank or 
lacked sufficient information; these were coded as “unknown.” 
Interrater reliability was assessed for a random 5% sample 
(635 decedents) of the data set, with resulting Cohen’s kappa 
coefficient of 0.87 (554 decedents); the remaining 81 decedents 
not in agreement were resolved through discussions among 
the authors.
Descriptive data were analyzed, including the number 
of suicides and rates of suicide by occupational group. 
Occupational groups were stratified by sex, and rates of suicide 
were calculated for each group using denominators derived 
from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey 
March Supplement (5), which includes a question about the 
person’s primary occupation during the previous calendar year. 
Rates were not calculated for occupation codes created by the 
authors, because the Current Population Survey data set does 
not provide denominator data for these groups. U.S. child labor 
laws prohibit persons aged <16 years from working full-time; 
therefore, only decedents aged ≥16 years were included. SOC 
code 55 (i.e., military specific occupations) was not included 
in the analysis because it was not possible to reliably determine 
whether these decedents were on active duty or retired, or what 
occupation they held in the military. If a decedent had a specific 
coded job and was employed by the military, that decedent was 
coded according to the occupation (e.g., an engineer working 
for the military would be included in the “Architecture and 
engineering” occupational group).
Among the 12,312 suicide decedents included in the 2012 
data set, 9,509 (77.2%) were male, and 2,801 (22.8%) were 
female; information about sex was missing for two decedents 
(Table 1). Decedents ranged in age from 16 to 102 years; 
however, 84.5% were aged 16–64 years. Nearly one third of all 
suicides occurred among persons in the following four occu-
pational groups: construction and extraction (1,324; 10.8%); 
management (1,049; 8.5%); production (953; 7.7%); and 
installation, maintenance, and repair (780; 6.3%) (Table 1). 
The highest proportion (22.7%) of suicides occurred among 
persons aged 45–54 years, and the lowest proportion (11.6%) 
occurred among persons aged 16–24 years (Table 1).
Rates of suicide were highest in the following three occupa-
tional groups: farming, fishing, and forestry (84.5 suicides per 
100,000 persons); construction and extraction (53.3); and instal-
lation, maintenance, and repair (47.9) (Table 2). Rates of suicide 
varied by sex, with higher rates among males than females in all 
occupational groups (Table 2). Among males, the highest suicide 
rates were among persons in the following three occupational 
§ In cases for which NIOCCS provided a U.S. Census occupation code but did 
not provide an SOC code, the algorithm recoded the U.S. Census occupation 
codes to SOC codes and author-created codes. The algorithm also was used to 
code many of the remaining decedents not assigned a detailed SOC or U.S. 
Census occupation code by NIOCCS using the industry and occupation text 
fields. Because the algorithm coded only to SOC major groups, it was able to 
record more decedents than NIOCCS.

groups: farming, fishing, and forestry (90.5 per 100,000); con-
struction and extraction (52.5); and installation, maintenance, and 
repair (47.5). Among females, the highest suicide rates occurred 
among persons in the following three occupational groups: 
protective service occupations (e.g., law enforcement officers 
and firefighters) (14.1 per 100,000); legal (13.9); and healthcare 
practitioners and technical (13.3) (Table 2).
Discussion
Earlier studies of suicide by occupation type in the United 
States have examined one occupational group at a time, such 
as police suicides (6), or have studied data from a specific U.S. 
state (7). This analysis includes recent data from 17 states and 
an analysis by sex. The proportions of suicides among males 
(77.2%) and females (22.8%) in this analysis were similar 
to those reported nationally in 2012 (78.3% and 21.7%, 
respectively) (1).
Occupational groups with higher suicide rates might be at 
risk for a number of reasons, including job-related isolation 
and demands, stressful work environments, and work-home 
imbalance, as well as socioeconomic inequities, including lower 
income, lower education level, and lack of access to health 
services (7,8). Previous research suggests that farmers’ chronic 
exposure to pesticides might affect the neurologic system and 
contribute to depressive symptoms. Other factors that might 
contribute to suicide among farmers include social isolation, 
potential for financial losses, barriers to and unwillingness to 
seek mental health services (which might be limited in rural 
areas), and access to lethal means (8). Construction workers 
might be at higher risk because of financial and interpersonal 
concerns related to lack of steady employment, and fragmented 
community or isolation (9). It has been hypothesized that 
one possible factor contributing to higher suicide risk among 
workers in installation, maintenance, and repair occupations 
might be long-term exposure to solvents that can cause neuro-
toxic damage, including memory impairment and depressive 
symptoms (8). Research has suggested that higher suicide rates 
among police are related to stressors including exposure to 
traumatic, violent, and lethal situations; work overload; shift 
work; and access to lethal means (6,8). Females in protective 
service occupations might also experience additional stressors 
in these traditionally male-dominated occupations (6). Of 
note, while management occupations had the 10th highest rate 
of suicide, they accounted for the second largest percentage 
of suicide deaths overall; therefore, it is important to target 
prevention strategies to managers as well.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, for 729 (5.9%) cases, an occupation or workforce 
status could not be determined. Second, using an automated 
system such as NIOCCS, a computer algorithm, and human 
coders to assign occupation codes might introduce errors in 
categorizing industry and occupation; however, interrater 
reliability checks suggested a high level of consistency. Third, 
coding of industry and occupation in NVDRS, which uses 
open-ended fields, depends on the completeness of information 
available from the NVDRS data sources and accuracy of informa-
tion provided by informants to these systems (e.g., coroner/medical 
examiner and family members). Variations in coding might occur 
depending on the abstractor’s amount of experience. For this reason, 
CDC provides abstractor training, and states conduct blinded re-
abstraction of cases to test consistency and identify training needs. 
Industry and occupation categories assigned in NVDRS are 
a decedent’s “usual occupation,” which might not reflect the 
decedent’s actual position or positions at the time of death. 
Finally, the 17 NVDRS states examined in this report are not 
nationally representative. Analyses of forthcoming data from 
the expansion of NVDRS into 32 states in 2014 might pro-
vide more representative findings, and permit examination of 
occupational trends over time.
Suicide prevention activities directed toward persons aged 
≥16 years include enhancing connectedness to family and 
friends, encouraging help-seeking for persons exhibiting signs 
of distress or suicidality, and supporting efforts to reduce stigma 
associated with help-seeking and mental illness. Some potential

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2012, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death among 
persons aged ≥16 years in the United States, with approxi-
mately 40,000 suicide deaths reported among persons aged 
≥16 years. From 2000 to 2012, rates of suicide for persons aged 
≥16 years increased 21.1%, from 13.3 per 100,000 to 16.1. 
Understanding suicides by occupational group provides an 
opportunity for prevention, but such data have not been 
reported recently for a broad population or examined by sex 
and occupation classification.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of 2012 National Violent Death Reporting System data 
from 17 states indicated that workers in the farming, fishing, 
and forestry occupational group had the highest rate of suicide 
(84.5 per 100,000), followed by workers in construction and 
extraction (53.3), and installation, maintenance, and repair 
(47.9). Among males, farming, fishing, and forestry also 
accounted for the highest rates of suicide (90.5 per 100,000), 
whereas the highest rate among females (14.1) was among 
workers in the protective service occupational group.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Suicide prevention activities directed toward persons aged 
≥16 years, particularly male workers in farming, fishing, and 
forestry occupations and female workers in protective services 
are needed. Prevention strategies that enhance social support, 
community connectedness, access to preventive services, and 
reduction of stigma and barriers to help-seeking are encouraged.
suicide prevention strategies include workplace approaches, 
such as employee assistance programs, which might serve as 
gateways to behavioral health treatment. Workplace wellness 
programs can provide education and training for staff members 
and supervisors to aid in recognition of suicide warning signs 
(e.g., withdrawal, increased substance abuse, agitation, and 
putting affairs in order). Employers also can use technology 
to provide online mental health screenings, web-based tools 
for mental health information, and mental health screening 
kiosks for their employees, as well as ensure that employees 
are aware of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (http://
www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org; 1-800-273-8255).
The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention 
(NAASP) Workplace Task Force has developed a Comprehensive 
Blueprint for Workplace Suicide Prevention that addresses 
suicide prevention strategies, such as screening, mental health 
services and resources, suicide prevention training, life skills 
and social network promotion, and education and advocacy.¶ 
The NAASP online site has resources targeted specifically to the 
construction and law enforcement industries. Evidence-based 
suicide prevention strategies implemented in the workplace 
have the potential to reduce the number of suicides among 
all occupational groups.
