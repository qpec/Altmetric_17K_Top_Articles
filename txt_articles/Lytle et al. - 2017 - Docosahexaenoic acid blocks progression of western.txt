Abstract
Background
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health concern in western socie-
ties. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, is characterized
by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. NASH is a risk factor for
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is predicted to be the leading cause of liver
transplants by 2020. Despite this growing public health concern, there remain no Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved NASH treatments. Using Ldlr -/- mice as a preclinical
model of western diet (WD)-induced NASH, we previously established that dietary supple-
mentation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6,ω3) attenuated WD-induced NASH in a
prevention study. Herein, we evaluated the capacity of DHA supplementation of the WD and
a low fat diet to fully reverse NASH in mice with pre-existing disease.
Methods
Ldlr -/- mice fed the WD for 22 wks developed metabolic syndrome (MetS) and a severe
NASH phenotype, including obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, inflam-
mation, fibrosis and low hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. These mice were
randomized to 5 groups: a baseline group (WDB, sacrificed at 22 wks) and 4 treatments: 1)
WD + olive oil (WDO); 2) WD + DHA (WDD); 3) returned to chow + olive oil (WDChO); or 4)
returned to chow + DHA (WDChD). The four treatment groups were maintained on their
respective diets for 8 wks. An additional group was maintained on standard laboratory chow
(Reference Diet, RD) for the 30-wk duration of the study.
Results
When compared to the WDB group, the WDO group displayed increased hepatic expres-
sion of genes linked to inflammation (Opn, Il1rn, Gdf15), hepatic fibrosis (collagen staining,
Col1A1, Thbs2, Lox) reflecting disease progression. Mice in the WDD group, in contrast,
had increased hepatic C20-22 ω3 PUFA and no evidence of NASH progression. MetS and

NASH progression, DHA alone does not promote full remission of diet-induced MetS or
NASH.
Introduction
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that nearly 80 million adults [1] and
13 million children [2] in the US are obese. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly
associated with obesity [3, 4]; and is the most common chronic fatty liver disease in developed
countries [5]. NAFLD is defined as excessive neutral lipid (triglycerides and cholesterol esters)
deposition in the liver, i.e., hepatosteatosis [6, 7]. The top 4 risk factors for NAFLD are obesity,
dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) [8, 9].
NAFLD is a continuum of diseases ranging from benign fatty liver to primary hepatocellu-
lar cancer (HCC). Approximately 30% of the US population is estimated to have some form of
chronic fatty liver disease [10]. Ten to 30% of NAFLD patients develop nonalcoholic steatohe-
patitis (NASH) [10, 11], the progressive form of the disease. NASH is characterized by hepatic
steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and injury. Excessive damage to the liver resulting
from NASH promotes tissue repair involving deposition of extracellular matrix components
(ECM), consisting of collagens, elastin and other proteins, i.e., fibrosis. NASH has high preva-
lence (�60%) in the T2DM population [12]; and is recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascu-
lar disease [13–15]. NASH patients also have higher mortality rates than NAFLD patients;
and both have a higher mortality rates than the general population. Twenty to 30% of NASH
patients progress to cirrhosis. Over a 10 year period, cirrhosis and liver related deaths occur in
20% and 12% of NASH patients, respectively [16]. By the year 2020, cirrhosis resulting from
NASH is projected to be the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States [17].
Given the increasing prevalence of NASH and its adverse clinical outcomes, NASH is consid-
ered a major public health concern [18].
Diet, genetics and lifestyle contribute to the onset and progression of NAFLD and NASH.
While the best strategy for managing NASH has yet to be defined [18–21], current strategies
focus on lifestyle management, including exercise and diet. Diets recommended for NAFLD
therapy are low in fat, cholesterol & simple sugar [19, 22–34]. We have examined the effect of
ω3 PUFA in NASH therapy because ω3 PUFA lower blood triglycerides, reduce hepatic fatty
acid synthesis and inflammation and increase triglyceride catabolism [35–41]. Moreover,
NAFLD patients consuming a western-style diet have low hepatic PUFA content, and the loss
of hepatic PUFA worsens as patients transition from benign hepatosteatosis to advanced
NASH [42–44]
Our focus is on attenuating the impact of the western diet (WD) on NASH; the WD is a
leading culprit in the obesity epidemic [40–42, 45–50]. The WD is moderately high in fat (satu-
rated and trans-fat), simple sugar (sucrose & fructose) and cholesterol and low in essential
PUFA, i.e., linoleic acid (18:2,ω6) and γ-linolenic acid (18:3,ω3). Despite the promise of ω3
PUFA in NAFLD therapy, clinical studies using ω3 PUFA supplements have yielded mixed
results [29, 51–56]. Studies using either fish oil or Lovaza [~50:50 mix of eicosapentaenoic acid
(20:5,ω3, EPA) & docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6,ω3) ethyl esters (at ~4 g/d, GSK] have

 reported success in reducing steatosis, but little success in improving fibrosis scores [55–58].
EPA-ethyl esters (1.8 and 2.7 g/d) fail to reduce steatosis or fibrosis [57], a finding that recapit-
ulates our observations using the WD-Ldlr-/- mouse model for NASH [40]. The failure of EPA
to lower liver fat and fibrosis in humans is likely due to the poor conversion of EPA to DHA in
humans [58]. Both EPA and DHA suppress the expression of elongases & desaturases required
for PUFA synthesis [37]. DHA is a major bioactive ω3 PUFA accumulating in tissues and is
likely responsible for many of the beneficial effects of ω3 fatty acids seen in vivo.
Our previous studies using ω3 PUFA focused on NASH prevention [40, 41, 59]. We estab-
lished that DHA interferes with transforming growth factor (TGFβ) signaling and attenuates
WD-induced hepatic fibrosis in a prevention study [60]. TGFβ is a major regulator of hepatic
fibrosis [61]. More recently, we focused on treating obese mice with pre-existing NASH [50], a
likely scenario seen clinically. Herein, we evaluated the capacity of DHA to promote NASH
remission in mice with pre-existing NASH. Previous animal studies have shown that hepatic
fibrosis induced by intraperitoneal CCL4 injection, bile duct ligation or a choline-methionine
deficient diet was reversed within 4, 12 and 2 wks, respectively [62–64] after removal of the
pro-fibrotic agent. These models, however, lack the severe obese and diabetic phenotype asso-
ciated with human NASH. We predict that the obese-T2DM phenotype will negatively affect
NASH remission.
Our preclinical mouse model uses the WD to induce a severe NASH and MetS-like pheno-
type in Ldlr-/- mice. These mice are obese, hyperglycemic, dyslipidemic and endotoxinemic.
Their livers are fatty (steatotic), inflamed and fibrotic [65–67]. Like humans with NASH [42],
WD-fed mice have a significant reduction in hepatic PUFA with ω3 PUFA being more affected
than ω6 PUFA. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that dietary DHA will overcome the impact
of WD and fully reverse NASH, including fibrosis, in mice with pre-existing disease. The out-
come of our studies reveal the strengths and limitations of using dietary ω3 PUFA in NASH
therapy.
Materials and methods
Animals and diets
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All procedures
for the use and care of animals for laboratory research were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University (Permit Number: A3229-01).
Male Ldlr-/- mice [B6;129S7-Ldlr1Her/J, stock# 002207, purchased from Jackson Labs] were
individually housed, maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle; and mice were acclimatized
to the animal facilities at OSU for 1-week before proceeding with experiments. At the termi-
nation of the studies, all mice were fasted overnight (1800 h to 0800 h) prior to euthanasia
by CO2 administration and exsanguination; blood and liver were collected as previously
described [66].
At 10 weeks of age male mice were randomized to 2 treatment groups; 8 mice were main-
tained on Purina Pico Lab Diet 5053 ad libitum for 30 wks [(Reference Diet, (RD)], while 40
mice were fed the Western Diet (WD, Research diets D12079B) ad libitum for 22 wks (Fig 1). At
22 wks on the WD, obese mice (average weight 38.3 ± 2.3 g) were randomized to 5 groups:
Group 1 mice were euthanized and served as the WD-baseline group [WDB]; Group 2 mice
were fed ad libitum the WD supplemented with olive oil for 8 wks [WDO]; Group 3 mice were
fed the WD supplemented with DHA for 8 wks [WDD]; Group 4 mice were fed the Purina Pico
Lab Diet 5053 chow diet supplemented with olive oil for 8 wks (WDChO); Group 5 mice were
fed the Purina Pico Lab Diet 5053-chow diet supplemented with DHA for 8 wks (WDChD).

 DHA (DHASCO, DSM, 40% DHA as triglyceride) was added to the WD (WDD) and chow
(WDChD) diets so that DHA was at 2% total energy. This level of DHA is comparable to that used
in ω3-PUFA therapy where humans are prescribed Lovaza (GlaxoSmithKline: EPA- & DHA-ethyl
esters; at 4 g/day) to treat hypertriglyceridemia [68, 69]. Olive oil was added to the WD (WDO)
and chow (WDChO) diets to ensure all diets were isocaloric. Previous studies established that
addition of olive oil to the WD had no impact on the health status of WD-fed mice [38, 40, 59].
A power calculation (http://www.dssresearch.com/toolkit/spcalc/power_a1.asp) was carried
out with the following parameters: difference between the test (test value = 8) and control
(control value = 4) i.e., mean difference is 2-fold; standard deviation 20% of the mean; 95%
confidence, the statistical power for 4 and 6 animals (sample size) was 99.1% and 99.9%,
respectively. We initially started with 8 mice/group, but some mice were euthanized prema-
turely due to severe dermatitis. As such, the RD, WDB, WDO, WDD, WDChO and WDChD
had 5, 4, 6, 6, 6, 7 mice, respectively.
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from livers using Trizol (Life Technologies) as described [70], and quanti-
fied spectrophotometry using a nanodrop-1000. qRT-PCR was performed using the 7900HT
fast machine from Applied Bio-systems as previously described [70].
qRT-PCR arrays were used to profile the expression of genes involved in fibrosis (Mouse
Fibrosis RT2 Profiler PCR Array) and genes related to cytokines (Mouse Common Cytokines
RT2 Profiler PCR Array) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA). Gene expression was normalized to Hsp90ab1, and relative quantification was deter-
mined using the ΔΔCt method.
Fig 1. Study design to examine the reversibility of NASH in male Ldlr -/- mice. The study design included
two treatment arms; a blockade arm and a remission arm. Mice were initially randomized to 2 groups: a) mice
maintained on chow for 30 weeks, reference diet (RD, n = 5); b) mice maintained on the western diet (WD) for
22 wks. After 22 wks on the WD, four mice were euthanized for blood and liver collection; these mice served as
the baseline group (WDB, n = 4). The remaining WD-fed mice were randomized to 4 groups: 1) mice fed the
western diet + olive oil for 8 wks (WDO, n = 6), 2) mice fed the WD + DHA for 8 wks (WDD, n = 6); 3) mice fed
the chow diet + olive oil for 8 wks (WDChO, n = 6); 4) mice fed the chow diet + DHA for 8 wks (WDChD, n = 7).
At termination of the study, mice in the RD, WDO, WDD, WDChO and WDChD groups were euthanized for
liver and blood collection.

 Hepatic lipid composition
Hepatic lipids were extracted as previously described [71]. Total lipid extracts were saponified
and the fatty acids were methylated. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and quantified by
gas chromatography (GC) [71]. GC standards were purchased from Nu-Chek Prep Inc.
Hepatic protein content was measured using Quick Start Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad) and
bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard.
Measurement of plasma and hepatic osteopontin
Plasma osteopontin (OPN) was quantified by Elisa (R&D systems) according to the manufac-
tures protocols. Hepatic OPN was quantified by immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts
using mouse antibodies against Opn (R & D Systems) and vinculin (Millipore) as described
previously [40, 60].
Plasma and hepatic measures
Plasma triglycerides, total and free cholesterol and glucose were measured using kits obtained
from Wako. Plasma aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine amino transferase (ALT)
were measured using kits from Thermo Fischer Scientific. Plasma Toll Like receptor (TLR)2
and TLR4 agonist activity was measured using Hek-Blue cell systems from Invivogen.
Liver histology
Liver (~100 mg) was fixed in buffered-formalin, paraffin embedded, sliced, and stained with
hematoxylin-eosin or trichrome (Nationwide Histology, Veradale, WA). Each slide contained
2–4 slices/liver. Steatosis and fibrosis was seen consistently on all liver sections from the same
animal. Photomicrographs of liver sections shown in the figures are representative of all livers
within each group.
Heat maps, volcano plots and statistical analysis
Heat maps were prepared using data on body weight, plasma (glucose, lipids, ALT, AST, TLR2
and TLR4 agonist, cholesterol, triglycerides), and hepatic (triglycerides, cholesterol, fatty acid
profiles and gene expression) parameters. The data was analyzed using the statistical package
in MetaboAnalyst 3.0 [http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/] [72]. The analyses gen-
erated heat maps, volcano plots, correlation analyses and ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD Post-hoc
test. We also used a separate online statistical package [http://vassarstats.net/] for one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD Post-hoc test of specific features to detect significant differences
between groups when more than two groups were included in the analysis. Student’s t-test was
used when only two groups were being compared and non-parametric tests were used when
unequal variance as determined by f-test was detected between two groups. A p-value �0.05
was considered statistically different. All values are reported as mean ± SD.
Results
DHA halts NASH progression in Ldlr -/- mice with pre-existing disease
Ldlr -/- mice fed the WD for 22 wks (WDB group) are obese, hyperglycemic, dyslipidemic and
display evidence of significant hepatic injury (blood ALT and AST) and systemic inflammation
(plasma TLR2 and TLR4 agonist) (Table 1). Livers of these mice were increased in size relative to
body weight and contain elevated levels of cholesterol and saponifiable fatty acids. Saponifiable
fatty acids are derived from neutral lipids (triacylglycerides and diacylglycerides & cholesterol

 esters) and phosphoglycerolipids; and represent a more complete measure of changes in hepatic
fats associated with hepatosteatosis, than measuring triglycerides alone. Hepatic histology of mice
in the WDB group revealed severe steatosis (lipid droplets, which appear as white vacuoles) as
well as mild branching fibrosis, which appears as blue branching strands in trichrome stained liv-
ers (Fig 2).

 Maintaining the mice on the WD for an additional 8 wks (WDO group) does not signifi-
cantly increase body weight or blood glucose, but significantly increased plasma lipids (triglyc-
erides and cholesterol) and modestly increased hepatic injury and systemic inflammation
(Table 1). Liver weight, cholesterol and fatty acyls are higher in the WDO group versus the
WDB group. Extensive branching fibrosis is apparent throughout the liver in the WDO group,
reflecting disease progression, particularly in fibrosis.
Mice switched from the WD to the WD supplemented with DHA (WDD group) resulted
in no change body weight, blood glucose or TLR4 agonist, but a significant reduction in
plasma TLR2 agonists, when compared to the WDB group. When compared to the WDO
group, however, mice fed the WDD had significantly lower plasma triglycerides, cholesterol
and AST, but not ALT levels. Hepatic weight, cholesterol and fatty acyls were all significantly
lower in the WDD group, compared to the WDB and WDO groups. Histological examination
revealed hepatic lipid droplets were absent from the periportal region, but clustered around
the central vein. This pattern of steatosis may reflect increased triglyceride catabolism and
fatty acid oxidation in the periportal region. While branching fibrosis was absent in livers in
the WDD group, small isolated patches of fibrosis were located near large lipid droplets. The
absence of extensive branching fibrosis in the WDD group, as seen in the WDO group, likely
reflects inhibition of ECM formation during the 8 wk WDD feeding.
Impact of diet on hepatic fatty acid composition in the blockade arm
The WD induces a significant increase in total fatty acyls (Table 1, Fig 3), composed mainly of
saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fat (Fig 3A & 3B). Adding DHA to the WD
had no significant effect on hepatic SFA, but significantly lowered MUFA, including 16:1,ω7;
18:1,ω7 & 18:1,ω9. These fatty acids are derived from the diet and also synthesized endoge-
nously by stearoyl CoA desaturase (Scd1) mediated desaturation of 16:0 and 18:0. DHA sup-
presses hepatic Scd1 expression in WD-fed mice [40].
Although the WD is an essential fatty acid sufficient diet, the essential fatty acids (18:2,ω6 &
18:3,ω3) represent a low percentage of total dietary fat in the WD [40]. Hepatic levels of ω3

 and ω6 PUFA were significantly reduced in mice fed the WD-fed (Fig 3C & 3D). While
hepatic 18:2,ω6 was reduced by ~60% in the WDB and WDO groups, its downstream product,
i.e., arachidonic acid (20:4,ω6), was not reduced, when compared to the RD group. In contrast,
the ~60% reduction in hepatic 20:4,ω6 in WDD-fed mice is likely due to suppressed PUFA
synthesis, since DHA suppresses expression of Fads1, Fads2 and Elovl5 [40]. Increased hepatic
EPA, DPA and DHA in the WDD-fed group is consistent with previous studies showing that
dietary DHA increased hepatic 20:5,ω3 and 22:5,ω3, likely through retroconversion. While the
WD lowers hepatic ω3 and ω6 PUFA content and also significantly increased hepatic ω6/ω3
PUFA ratio by ~35%, dietary DHA significantly decreased the ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio by ~80%
when compared to the RD group (Fig 3E).
Overview of the capacity of DHA to block WD-induced NASH
progression
We next examined diet effects on two major pathways contributing to NASH progression, i.e.,
inflammation and fibrosis. Accordingly, we used commercially available qRTPCR arrays for
an in-depth analysis of inflammation (cytokines) and fibrosis. Results from the gene expres-
sion analysis, along with the anthropometric, plasma and fatty acid data (Table 1 and Fig 3)
were assembled in a spreadsheet and analyzed using the statistical package in MetaboAnalyst
3.0. This analysis allowed us to generate a heat map, a principal component (PCA) and a hier-
archical cluster analysis (HCA) (Fig 4) [72].
The analysis revealed broad effects of the WD on whole body, plasma and hepatic features.
Moreover, most features increased from 22 wks (WDB) to 30 wks (WDO) on the WD, reflect-
ing disease progression. Features that decreased included the essential ω3 and ω6 PUFA and
their C18-22 PUFA products (Fig 3). The PCA analysis shows that the RD group differs from all
WD-fed groups; and that the number and level of changed features increased from the WDB
to the WDO group, again reflecting disease progression.
Fig 4. Overview of diet effects on anthropometric, plasma, hepatic gene expression and lipid parameters
in the blockade arm. All anthropometric, plasma, gene expression and hepatic lipid features were assembled
into an excel spreadsheet for each mouse in each of the 4 groups (RD, WDB, WDO, WDD). The data was
analyzed using (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/) to create a heat map [A] and carry out a principal
component analysis [B] and hierarchical clustering using Spearman’s ranked correlation [C]. The heat map is a
visualization of the changes in abundance/level of features for each animal. Animal identification numbers are
listed on the right side of the heat map. The color ranges from deep orange (high abundance or level) to deep blue
(low abundance or level); white represents no change.

 Particularly relevant is the finding that the WDB and WDD groups overlap reflecting little
difference in features when compared to RD group (Fig 4B). The key difference between these
two groups is that mice in the WDB groups were euthanized at 22 wks, while mice in the
WDD group were placed on the WD containing DHA (WDD) diet at 22 wks and euthanized 8
wks later (Fig 1). The hierarchical clustering analysis established that the WDB, WDO and
WDD groups cluster separately from the RD group, while the WDD group segregates as a sep-
arate subgroup.
Impact of DHA on hepatic gene expression in the blockade arm
Of the 84 transcripts in the cytokine array, 15 transcripts were induced � 3-fold by the WD
(Fig 5A). Many of these transcripts increased from 22 to 30 wks of WD feeding reflecting dis-
ease progression (e.g., Opn, IL1rn, IL7), while other transcripts were significantly induced only
at 30 wks, reflecting late onset in the course of the disease (Tnfsf15, Bmb5). For all genes exam-
ined, DHA (WDD) either knocked down expression (Opn, IL1rn, Gdf15, Tnfsf12) or blocked
further increases in transcript abundance (IL7, IL15, Bmp5).
Of the cytokine transcripts examined, Opn stands out as being highly expressed and well-
regulated by diet in the liver (S1 Fig). Opn is a phosphoprotein cytokine secreted from many
cell types; and its plasma level has been linked to hepatic fibrosis [73]. Accordingly, we quanti-
fied plasma and hepatic Opn levels (Fig 6). Plasma Opn was induced ~40% after 30 wks on the
WD. Plasma Opn levels in the WDB and WDD groups are comparable and both are lower
than that seen in the WDO group. Hepatic Opn protein, in contrast, is low in the RD and
WDD groups, but well induced (10- and 50-fold) in the WDB and WDO groups, respectively.
Hepatic Opn protein parallels changes in hepatic Opn mRNA.
Additional gene expression markers of inflammation (Mcp1, Tlr4, Tnfα, CD68) and oxida-
tive stress (Nox2) were examined by qRTPCR (S2 Fig) [50]. We previously reported that the
WDO diet induced and WDD diet suppressed plasma levels of TNFα and agonist for TLR2
and TLR4 [60]. Most of these markers increased from 22 to 30 wks on the WDO diet providing
further evidence of disease progression. TNFα, in contrast, was well induced by 22 wks (~6-
fold) and showed no further increase at 30 wks on the WD. A complete list of features that

 increased (� 2-fold) or decreased (� 50%) significantly (p-value � 0.05) in the comparison of
the RD and WDO groups is in S1 Table.
Of the 84 transcripts on the fibrosis qRTPCR array, 20 were induced >3-fold (Fig 5B). The
most striking evidence of progression is the induction of Col1A1, the major collagen subtype
induced in rodent and human NASH [60, 74, 75]. Of the 3 collagen subtypes examined,
Col1A1 was expressed at the lowest level in the RD group (S1 Fig) and shows the highest fold
change of any collagen subtype examined. While many of the transcripts linked to fibrosis
were well-induced by 22 wks, the diet effects on hepatic growth factor (Hgf) and lysyl oxidase
(Lox) were only apparent after 30 wks on the WDO diet. In nearly all cases, DHA knocked
down or prevented further induction of the transcripts linked to fibrosis, reflecting a robust
anti-fibrotic effect of DHA. These changes in expression of fibrosis linked genes correlated
with the reduction in ECM staining in the WDD group (Fig 2).
DHA blocks disease progression
To further assess diet effects on disease progression, we used volcano and pie plots (Figs 7 and
8). After 22 wks on the WD, the NASH phenotype is characterized by significantly increased
plasma triglycerides (pTAG), total and free cholesterol (pTChol, pFChol) and the induction of
transcripts encoding multiple collagen subtypes (Col1A1, Col1A2, Col3A1), cytokines and che-
mokines (IL1rn, Ccl3, Ccl12) (Fig 7A). Features that declined significantly in the WDB group
included several ω3 and ω6 PUFA. Of the 196 features examined, 55 increased, 8 decreased
and 129 remained unchanged by 22 wks on the WD (Fig 7D). Sixteen features increased sig-
nificantly from 22 to 30 wks in the WDO group, including Col1A1, Hgf, TfgβR1 and integrins
(Itgα1, Itgα5), while 1 decreased further (20:5,ω3) (Fig 7B & 7D). Overall, the WDO group was

 characterized by a significant increase in 88 features and a significant decrease in 8 features
(S1 Table). These features included a massive increase in hepatic SFA, MUFA and expression
of multiple genes linked to inflammation (Opn) and fibrosis (Col1A1) and decreases in hepatic
ω3 and ω6 PUFA (Figs 3, 7C & 7D).
Comparing the WDD and the RD groups showed a significant increase in plasma lipids
(cholesterol and triglycerides) and hepatic expression of transcripts associated with inflamma-
tion (IL1rn) and fibrosis (Col1A1, Col1A2, Col3A1, Mmp1a) (Fig 8A). However, comparing
the WDD and WDB groups revealed no increase in any inflammatory or fibrosis marker (Fig
8B). Overall, adding DHA to the WD (WDD group) resulted in the induction of 45 features
(Fig 8D, S2 Table), whereas adding olive oil to the WD (WDO group) increased 88 features.
As such, adding DHA to the WD significantly lowered (~50%) the number of features induced
by the WD (Fig 8D). In fact, there is no evidence of disease progression in the WDD group.
The only features that increased in the WDD group versus WDB group were ω3 PUFA, while
5 features significantly decreased (TLR2 agonist; Opn; 18:1,ω7; 18:3,ω6; 20:4,ω6). Thus, DHA
addition to the WD blocks NASH progression. All features that increased (� 2-fold) or
decreased (� 50%) significantly (p-value � 0.05) in the comparison of the WDO versus the
WDD groups are listed in S2 Table.
DHA effects on NASH remission after switching from a WD to a chow
diet: remission arm
We recently reported that switching mice with NASH from the WD to a chow diet attenuated
many, but not all NASH markers in Ldlr -/- mice [50]. Herein, we examined the effect of adding
DHA to the chow diet on NASH remission (Fig 1, Remission Arm). Hepatic histology of mice
switched from the WD at 22 wks (WDB) to a chow diet supplemented with either olive oil
(WDChO group) or DHA (WDChD group) and euthanized 8 wks later showed nearly a com-
plete loss of steatosis and branching fibrosis (Fig 9). This new study confirms our earlier report
that a diet low in fat, cholesterol and sucrose promotes NASH remission [50].

 This remarkable recovery of the liver is associated with a significant decrease in body
weight, plasma glucose, lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol), hepatic injury (ALT, AST) and sys-
temic inflammation (TLR2, TLR4 activation) (Table 2). Moreover, hepatic weight and fatty
acids reveal no significant difference in SFA or MUFA amongst the RD, WDChO or WDChD
groups (Fig 10A & 10B). The only significant difference between the RD and treatment groups
is in ω3 and ω6 PUFA (Fig 10C). Hepatic linoleic acid (18:2,ω6) in the WDChO group is
~50% higher when compared to the RD group (Fig 10C). Addition of DHA to the chow diet
(WDChD group) increased C20-22 ω3 PUFA and lowered arachidonic acid levels, leading to a
significant reduction in the ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio (Fig 10D & 10E).
Overview of the capacity of DHA to augment chow diet-induced NASH
remission
Using the statistical approach described above, our analysis revealed an impressive capacity of
the chow diet to reverse many of the features induced by the WD (Fig 11). The PCA plot (Fig
11B) shows that the WDChO and WDChD overlap with the RD group; these groups were
clearly separated from the WDB and WDO groups. The hierarchical clustering analysis estab-
lished that although the WDChO and WDChD groups cluster with the RD group, the WDChO
appears similar to the RD group, while the WDChD group is a separate subgroup. The factors
contributing to this difference likely reflect increased C20-22 ω3 PUFA and decrease arachidonic
acid in the WDChD group versus the WDChO group (Figs 10 and 11C).
Impact of the chow diet, with and without DHA, on hepatic gene
expression in the remission arm
Of the 15 transcripts identified in the cytokine array that were induced � 3-fold by the WD
(Fig 5), all but one (bone morphogenetic protein 5, Bmp5) were suppressed by returning WD
fed mice to the chow diet (WDChO group). In the fibrosis array, nearly all WD-induced

expression increased after the diet switch from WD to chow (WDChO) (Fig 12B).

increased, while 7 were decreased. Plasma triglyceride and mRNAs encoding Hgf, TgfβR1,&
Fgf10were increased, while only ω6 PUFA were decreased. A comparison of features that sig-
nificantly differed between the WDChD and WDChO groups (S3 Table and Fig 13D) showed
that addition of DHA to chow increased hepatic DHA, EPA, total ω3 PUFA and fibroblast
growth factor 10 (Fgf10),but decreased hepatic transcripts involved in inflammation [lympho-
toxin β (Ltβ), colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf1), interleukin 16 (IL16)], fibrosis [lysyl oxidase-
like 2 (LoxL2), bone morphogenic protein 6 (Bmp6)], angiogenesis [vascular endothelial
growth factor α (Vegfα], metabolism [glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh)]
and tissue repair [growth differentiation factor 2 (Gdf2)]. The outcome of this analysis estab-
lished that the addition of DHA to the chow diet offered a significant, but modest improve-
ment, in liver status.
Discussion
The goal of this study was to evaluate the capacity DHA, alone and in combination with a
chow diet to promote weight loss and full remission of WD-induced NASH in a preclinical
mouse model. This analysis differs from our previous studies [40, 41, 60] where we tested the
capacity of EPA, DHA and EPA + DHA to prevent WD-induced NASH. It also differs from
our recent report [50] where we assessed the impact of low fat-low cholesterol diets to reverse
NASH.
We used two clinically relevant approaches to promote disease remission. We first exam-
ined the capacity of adding DHA to the WD to eliminate all NASH features in mice with pre-
existing NASH (Table 1, Figs 2–8). This scenario is clinically relevant since patient compli-
ance to dietary recommendations, i.e., a low fat-low sucrose diet, has historically been poor.
We also examined the impact of adding DHA to a diet low in fat, sugar and cholesterol, i.e.,
chow diet, on NASH remission (Figs 9–14). Our studies revealed that DHA supplementation

 of the WD exerted broad and robust repressive effects on multiple features associated with
blood, hepatic lipids and hepatic expression markers of inflammation and fibrosis (Table 1,
Figs 2 & 4). This treatment approach, however, failed to eliminate several pathological features
associated with MetS, including obesity, hyperglycemia or TLR4-associated endotoxinemia.
The chow diet, which is low in fat, cholesterol and sucrose, in contrast, significantly attenuated
nearly all pathological features associated with MetS and NASH (Table 2, Figs 9 & 11). DHA
supplementation of the diet low in fat, cholesterol and sugar provided additional benefit over
the effects of low fat, cholesterol and sugar diet alone. Overall, these findings support the use of
supplemental DHA in the clinical management of patients with NASH.
Metabolic plasma parameters
Human plasma markers of MetS include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia (triglycerides and cho-
lesterol) and a low-grade chronic endotoxinemia [76]. Ldlr-/- mice fed the WD display all of
these features, as well as evidence of NASH-associated hepatic injury (ALT & AST) (Tables 1
& 2). Switching mice from the WD to the diet low in fat, cholesterol and sugar returned body
weight and MetS plasma markers to levels seen in mice fed the reference (RD group; chow)
diet (Tables 1 and 2), a finding that confirms our previous report [50]. Switching mice from
the WD to a WD supplemented with DHA (WDD group) at 22 wks failed to lower blood glu-
cose, ALT or TLR4 agonist levels. While the WDD significantly lowered plasma triglycerides,
cholesterol and AST, these plasma markers were not returned to levels seen in the RD group
(Table 1). Only TLR2 agonist levels returned to levels seen in the RD group.
TLRs play a major role in the onset and progression of NAFLD and fibrosis [77, 78]. In
addition to its effects on TLR2 and TLR4 agonist levels, the WD induced hepatic expression of
both TLR2 and TLR4, and the ancillary protein CD14 [40]. TLR2 receptors are activated by
components from gut-derived gram-positive bacteria, like peptidoglycans and lipoteichoic
acid [77], while TLR4 receptors are activated by components from gram-negative gut-derived
bacteria, like endotoxin. In addition, both TLR2 and TLR4 activity is regulated by fatty acids.
Moreover, saturated fatty acids activate while ω3 PUFA inhibit TLR2 and TLR4 function [79].
The WD induces endotoxinemia [41] and severe dyslipidemia (Table 1). Correlation analyses
establish a strong association between plasma TLR2 agonist levels and hepatic features linked
to inflammation (C-X-C chemokine 4 receptor, interleukin 1α) and fibrosis (Timp1, 2, 3; Mmp
1a & 14; TgfβR1& TgfβR2)(S4 Table). DHA attenuates WD-mediated induction of these fea-
tures, while the chow diet returns expression levels of these transcripts to levels seen in the RD
group. TLR effects on hepatic gene expression are mediated through interferon regulatory fac-
tors (IRF-3 & 7), NFκB, Jnk and p38 Mapk. Feeding mice the WD increases NFκB-p50 and
NFκB-p65 in hepatic nuclei, while DHA suppresses WD-induced NFκB-p50 nuclear content
[40]. The impact of DHA on IRF-3 &7, Jnk and p38 MapK in this model has not been exam-
ined. Equally unclear is whether DHA effects on plasma TLR2 agonist levels are linked to
effects on blood levels of gut-derived bacterial components or plasma lipids.
Hepatic inflammation and cytokines
A key pathological feature of NASH is hepatic inflammation, a process that involves infiltra-
tion of the liver by monocytes, macrophage and T-cells; and the production of chemokines,
cytokines and factors contributing to oxidative stress. After 22 and 30 wks on the WD, 11 and
14 transcripts were induced, respectively, at least 3-fold (Fig 5). The most abundant hepatic
transcript induced by the WD was Opn, a secreted phosphoprotein appearing in plasma.
Immunoblot analysis established that changes in hepatic Opn mRNA abundance correlated
well with changes in hepatic OPN protein abundance (Fig 6). Opn expression is regulated by

 the Notch, Hedgehog [80, 81] and vitamin D receptor-Runx2 pathways [82]. Opn is expressed
in multiple cell types and is upregulated in certain cancers [83, 84]. Opn activates cells by bind-
ing integrins (Itgα5 & Itgβ3) and CD44, a ubiquitously expressed receptor for hyaluronic acid
(a soluble marker of fibrosis). CD44 is involved in cell growth and migration [85, 86]. Opn
interaction with these cell surface proteins has been implicated in alcoholic liver disease pro-
gression and it has served as a marker of hepatic fibrosis progression [73] and HCC [87]. Cor-
relation analyses establish a strong association between Opn expression and fibrosis (S5 and
S6 Tables). Recent reports indicate that Opn regulates HMGB1 expression [88], and together
with Opn, acts in a paracrine fashion as a downstream “alarmin” driving Col1A1 synthesis in
hepatic stellate cells. Adding DHA to the WD (Fig 6) or switching from the WD to chow diet
(Fig 12) essentially returned Opn transcript abundance to levels seen in the RD group.
Many of the cytokine-linked transcripts that responded to changes in diet are expressed at
low levels in liver (S1 Fig). The cytokine array identified several interleukins (Il1α, Il1rn, Il5,
Il7, Il12b, Il27) and members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily (Tnfsf 12, 13b, 15,
and 18) as well as a growth differentiation factor (Gdf15) and a bone morphogenetic protein
(Bmp5) as targets for diet control. These transcripts were well-induced by the WD and sup-
pressed by DHA addition to the WD (Fig 5) or by switching from the WD to the chow diet at
22 wks (Fig 12). Interleukins are produced by macrophages, monocytes, T-cells and endothe-
lial cells; they regulate immune response as well as cell survival and proliferation [89, 90].
Interleukins are classically considered “pro-inflammatory” [90–95], while DHA generally
functions in an “anti-inflammatory” capacity [96].
Gdf15 is induced in humans with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [97], while sev-
eral BMPs, which are members of the TGFβ superfamily [98], are induced in NASH, cirrhosis
and HCC. Gdf15 is induced after 22 wks on the WD, but Bmp5 is significantly induced at 30 wks
on the WD. While addition of DHA to the WD at 22 wks blocks Bmp5 induction at 30 wks (Fig
5), switching from the WD at 22 wks to the chow diet, without or with DHA does not block
Bmp5 induction (Fig 12). Since DHA significantly attenuates Gdf15 and Bmp5 expression, DHA
may prevent NASH progression to HCC. Future studies will establish if diet-induced changes in
these transcripts are associated with significant changes in the corresponding proteins.
Hepatic fibrosis
Diet-induced hepatic inflammation promotes liver injury leading to tissue repair and fibrosis.
While our previous reports dealt with prevention, this report focused on stopping disease pro-
gression and promoting disease remission. Clear evidence of fibrosis progression is seen in the
significant increases in Col1A1, Thbs1 & 2, Hgf and Lox expression at 30 versus 22 wks on the
WD (Fig 5). Col1A1 expression shows a strong correlation with multiple transcripts linked to
fibrosis (S7 and S8 Tables), a finding that reveals coordinate control. TGFβ is a major regula-
tor of hepatic fibrosis [61] and a target of DHA suppression [60]. Lox is involved in collagen
cross-linking [60] and hepatic growth factor (Hgf) plays a role in repair of hepatic damage
[99].
While our previous studies described the capacity of DHA to prevent WD-induced hepatic
fibrosis [40, 60], these findings makes clear that inclusion of DHA in the diet of WD fed ani-
mals with well-established NASH and fibrosis blocks fibrosis progression and may even lower
hepatic fibrosis (Figs 2 & 7). At least one mechanism for WD induced and DHA attenuated
fibrosis is through suppression of hepatic nuclear content phospho-Smad3, a key mediator of
TGFβ signaling [60].
The WD appears to coordinately induced the expression of multiple proteins linked to
ECM deposition in the liver (Col1A1, Timp1 & 2, Lox/LoxL2), while also inducing expression

 of enzymes linked to basement membrane remodeling and fibrosis removal, such as matrix
metalloproteases (Mmp1a, 2 & 13) (S7 and S8 Tables). DHA attenuates WD-mediated induc-
tion of these proteins in a prevention study [60] and blocks further induction of these tran-
scripts in a remission study (Fig 5A). The immune system plays multiple roles in NASH; it is
involved in both the onset and progression of NASH as well as its remission. Products of mac-
rophage are required for the resolution of NASH since these cells are the source of enzymes
that remove collagen, e.g., matrix metalloprotease [63, 100]. Due to the limitations of the
experimental design, it is unclear if the DHA-mediated suppression of Mmp1a, 2 and 13a is
due to DHA suppression of expression of these enzymes in innate immune cells involved in
resolution of inflammation or due to an overall suppression of inflammation. Well-designed
time course studies coupled with analysis of DHA effects on innate immune cells and the cor-
responding Timp and Mmp proteins will be required to resolve this issue.
Hepatic PUFA
Arendt, et al [42] recently reported a decline in hepatic ω3 and ω6 PUFA in the transition
from simple steatosis to NASH in humans. Changes in mouse and human liver PUFA content
are associated with changes in expression of Fads1, Fads2 & Elovl5 expression, key enzymes
involved in PUFA synthesis [40, 60]. The suppression of PUFA production is also seen in wild
type mice fed high fat diet; and high fat diets alter FoxO1 and mTorc2 signaling and ATGL
expression to reduce triglyceride catabolism [36, 101, 102]. Thus, our studies support recent
human studies showing that high fat diets negatively impact PUFA metabolism and liver
health.
Addition of DHA to the WD, at 2% total calories, significantly increased hepatic DHA,
DPA and EPA content and lowered MUFA and arachidonic acid content as well as signifi-
cantly lowering the ω6/ω3 PURA ratio (Fig 3). MUFA content decreases because of suppres-
sion of SCD1 expression, while arachidonic acid content decreased because of suppressed
Fads1, Fads2 & Elovl5 expression [40]. EPA and DPA increase as a result of DHA retroconver-
sion [103].
Finally, DHA induced hepatic Fgf10,a growth factor involved in hepatic embryonic devel-
opment [104]. While a role for Fgf10 has not been described in the context of NASH remis-
sion, its role in early organogenesis and development and patterning between the liver and
pancreas has been described [105]. As noted above, we have uncovered gene expression mark-
ers of advanced NASH and HCC, i.e., Gdf15 and Bmp5. What role Fgf10 plays in NASH remis-
sion or its progression to HCC will require further study.
Conclusions
We have established that using DHA as a dietary supplement for the treatment of pre-estab-
lished WD-induced NASH in Ldlr-/- mice blocked disease progression, decreased plasma tri-
glycerides and decreased existing hepatosteatosis, inflammation- and fibrosis-associated gene
expression markers and histological evidence of hepatic fibrosis. Supplemental DHA, however,
did not lower hepatic injury as evidenced by no significant reduction of ALT levels. We
assessed the reversibility of NASH by returning mice with WD-induced NASH to a low-fat
low-cholesterol chow diet without or with supplemental DHA for 8 weeks. This diet returned
NASH livers to livers with minimal evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis or
liver injury within 8 wks. This treatment, while ideal for clinical use, is likely not sustainable in
NASH patients due to poor compliance to dietary therapy. As such, our studies with the Ldlr-/-
mouse suggest that adding DHA (at ~2% total energy) to a patient’s regular diet will block dis-
ease progression, which is a key goal in disease management.
