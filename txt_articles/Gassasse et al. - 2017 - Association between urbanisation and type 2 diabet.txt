AbstrAct
Introduction Previous studies have explored the effect 
of urbanisation on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) at regional/national level. The aim of this study 
is to investigate the association between urbanisation 
and T2D at country level, worldwide, and to explore the 
role of intermediate variables (physical inactivity, sugar 
consumption and obesity). The potential effect  
modification of gross domestic product (GDP) was also 
assessed.
Methods Data for 207 countries were collected from 
accessible datasets. Direct acyclic graphs were used to 
describe the association between urbanisation, T2D and 
their intermediate variables (physical inactivity, sugar 
consumption and obesity). Urbanisation was measured as 
urban percentage (UP) and as agglomeration index (AI). 
Crude and multivariate linear regression analyses were 
conducted to explore selected associations. The interaction 
between urbanisation and T2D across levels of GDP per 
capita was investigated.
results The association between urbanisation and T2D 
diverged by exposure: AI was positively associated, while 
UP negatively associated with T2D prevalence. Physical 
inactivity and obesity were statistically significantly 
associated with increased prevalence of T2D. In middle-
income countries (MIC) UP, AI and GDP were significantly 
associated with T2D prevalence, while in high-income 
countries (HIC), physical inactivity and obesity were the 
main determinant of T2D  
prevalence.
conclusions The type of urban growth, not urbanisation 
per se, predicted T2D prevalence at country level. In MIC, 
population density and GDP were the main determinant of 
diabetes, while in HIC. these were physical inactivity and 
obesity. Globalisation is playing an important role in the 
rise of T2D worldwide.
IntroductIon
In 2015, the International Diabetes Federa-
tion reported that type 2 diabetes (T2D) was 
the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, 
with 415 million people affected.1 Existing 
literature has examined the contextual effects 
of urbanisation on T2D risk.2 3 A structural 
change from agriculture to industrialisation 
has reduced the cost of calories through 
agricultural innovation and by producing 
and processing energy-dense foods4; a recent 
study has identified changes in obesity 
prevalence following alternations to agricul-
ture in India.5 Meanwhile, the cost of fruit and 
vegetables has increased due to the limited 
supply cultivated in less agriculturally produc-
tive land.6 Internal migration contributes to 
changes in industrial practices and has a role 
in changing health outcomes. As populations

Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
 
► Urban environments are regarded as potentially 
obesogenic and diabetogenic.
 
► The majority of the studies investigating the 
association between urbanisation and diabetes 
found a positive association; however, it is not clear 
if this is a global trend, and if the mechanisms 
explaining the association are consistent 
across low-income and high-income countries, 
and therefore across different stages of the 
epidemiological and nutritional transition.
What are the new findings?
 
► This worldwide ecological analysis investigates the 
association between urbanisation and prevalence of 
diabetes, exploring the role of potentially mediating 
factors, that is, obesity, physical inactivity and sugar 
consumption. 
 
► The present data suggest that it is the uncontrolled 
growth of large urban agglomerates, rather than 
urbanisation per se, which is associated to a higher 
prevalence of diabetes worldwide. 
 
► Agglomeration index and gross domestic product 
per capita are the determinant of diabetes in upper-
middle income countries, while in high-income 
countries, obesity and physical inactivity explain its 
prevalence.
recommendations for policy
 
► The effect of urbanisation on diabetes 
prevalence differs depending on the stage of the 
epidemiological and nutritional transition countries 
are going through. 
 
► A controlled and effective urbanisation can 
confer an ‘urban advantage’, which mitigates the 
inequalities associated to the rapid expansion of 
urban agglomerates. 
 
► This would also counteract the surge of risk factors 
for chronic diseases limiting the non-communicable 
disease epidemic.

move towards a more urban environment, higher rates of 
obesity and T2D have been observed,7 likely as a conse-
quence of changes in lifestyles and health behaviours (ie, 
diet and physical activity)8–10 but perhaps also due to the 
changing socioeconomic make-up of these new urban 
populations.
Moreover, increasingly, urban sprawl replaces green 
space with densely populated buildings, reducing 
outdoor spaces suitable for physical activity.11 This also 
hampers proximity and connectivity, where the increase 
in distance and time to make journeys discouraged society 
from walking or cycling.12 Economic literature shows 
that urban sprawl is more common in higher income 
countries (HIC) and that it is a proxy for affluence13–15; 
living in urban environment might also facilitate access 
to healthcare and preventive programmes.16 Few studies 
have examined the association between urbanisation 
and T2D at regional/national level finding mostly,17–20 
but not always,21 higher prevalence in higher urbanised 
areas.
It is not clear to what extent urban growth per se is 
associated with higher prevalence of T2D, or a rapidly 
increasing urban concentration might promote an 
obesogenic or diabetogenic environment. Most measures 
of urbanisation in relation to non-communicable diseases 
were previously found of limited value in measuring the 
urbanisation process.22 The aim of this study is to inves-
tigate the association between urbanisation and T2D at 
country level, worldwide, and to examine the role of the 
main potentially modifiable lifestyle risk factors (physical 
inactivity, sugar consumption and obesity) in mediating 
this association. The potential effect modification of 
gross domestic product (GDP) was also explored.
MetHods
Data on the exposure variable (urbanisation), the 
outcome variable (prevalence of T2D) and potential 
intermediate and interacting variables or confounders 
(physical inactivity, prevalence of obesity, sugar consump-
tion and GDP per capita) at country level, worldwide, 
were collected.
urbanisation
There is no consensus on how to measure urbanisation 
at country level; few indicators have been suggested, 
providing different proxy measures. Data on urban-
isation measured by urban percentage (UP), that is, 
the proportion of a population living in urban areas as 
defined by national statistical offices, was collected for 
207 countries from the 2015 World Bank Development 
Indicators.23 UP, despite being the most commonly used 
and widely available measure because of its simplicity, 
relies on country-specific definition of what it is urban, 
potentially leading to different ranks of urbanisation 
when several countries are considered. As a conse-
quence, also data on the agglomeration index (AI) in 
2008 was obtained for 162 countries from The World 
Bank World Development Report.24 AI is a composite 
measure of population density, size and travel time to 
the nearest urban city. Population density is based on the 
average of two global gridded population data sources—
Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project and LandScan. 
Population size in a defined ‘large’ urban centre used for 
this analysis was 100 000 inhabitants. Travel time to the 
nearest urban city is calculated by a cost–distance model 
that estimates travel time to the city over the average 
travel speeds, based on GIS data, between the transport 
network and off road surfaces. These components are 
aggregated, with the proportion of this number to that 
country’s total population being the AI. This measure is 
designed to quantify the degree of settlement concen-
tration in order to capture the difference between large 
cities growing bigger from many small cities emerging.24 
Also, AI includes only locations that satisfy all three 
components, transcending country-specific and ad hoc 
definition discrete entities, such as cities and administra-
tive boundaries.25 However, AI is sensitive to the chosen 
threshold values used to define the components.
type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence
Prevalence of T2D was calculated using the 2015 World 
Bank Development Indicators26 reporting the percentage 
of people, aged 20–79 years, diagnosed with diabetes from 
207 countries. These figures aggregated type 1 and type 2 
diabetes; however, type 1 diabetes is, on average, a small 
proportion (up to 10%) of prevalent cases27; therefore, it 
is possible to use the aggregate measure to approximate 
T2D prevalence.
Physical inactivity
Physical inactivity was derived from The 2010 WHO 
Global Health Observatory Data Repository28 for 
143 countries as the proportion of a population, aged 
20–79 years, achieving less than 150 min of moderate-in-
tensity physical activity or less than 75 min of vigorous-in-
tensity physical activity per week, reflecting current 
recommendations.
obesity prevalence
Prevalence of obesity was collected for 187 countries from 
the 2014 Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook28 
as age-adjusted measure of the proportion of the popula-
tion, aged 20–79 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 
30 kg/m2 or higher.
sugar consumption
Sugar and sweeteners consumption (kg/capita/year) is 
obtained from The UN Food and Agriculture Organ-
isation Database29 for 173 countries and measures the 
supply in kilograms, for human consumption per year. 
This is calculated by dividing the annual sugar produc-
tion by the mid-year population.
GdP per capita
GDP per capita is the GDP divided by the mid-year popu-
lation in US dollars. This was extracted from the World

statistical analysis
A conceptual framework for studying the intercon-
nectedness of the variables included in this study was 
built using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) (figure 1): 
measures of urbanisation are regarded as the main 
exposure variables; obesity, physical inactivity and 
sugar consumption as intermediate variables; and prev-
alence of T2D as the outcome variable. Accordingly, 
crude associations of each suitable variable (exposure 
or intermediate variables) with T2D and with interme-
diate variables were initially studied. Subsequently, few 
multivariate models were built to study the association 
between urbanisation (measured either as UP or as 
AI) and intermediate variables, with GDP and other 
relevant variables (ie, physical inactivity when studying 
obesity and vice versa) as potential confounders. Finally, 
a model including UP, the AI and intermediate varia-
bles was built. Interaction of the association between 
urbanisation and T2D across income categories has 
been tested using the likelihood ratio test; the final 
model was repeated restricted to each of the income 
categories. All analyses were conducted using STATA 
V.14.1. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
results
The age-adjusted prevalence of T2D at country level, 
the proportion of population living urban areas (or 
UP), and the AI at country level, worldwide, are 
shown in figure 2A–C. Statistical analyses include 
a maximum of 207 countries (crude association 
between urbanisation and T2D) and a minimum of 
109 countries (multivariate analyses) allowing for 
missing values (table 1).

consumption and GDP were positively significantly associ-
ated with obesity. Urbanisation and GDP were also signifi-
cantly associated with sugar consumption (table 1).
In multivariate analyses, urbanisation measured either 
as UP or AI was found significantly and positively associ-
ated with sugar consumption and physical inactivity, but 
not with obesity. In turn, higher sugar consumption was 
significantly associated with higher obesity, and higher 
obesity was significantly associated with higher phys-
ical inactivity (table 1 and figure 1, DAGs connectors in 
orange).
When all the variables were included in a final model, 
higher obesity prevalence, higher levels of physical inac-
tivity and lower GDP were all significantly associated with 
higher prevalence of T2D, entirely accounting for the 
association between UP and T2D. Nonetheless, when 
urbanisation was measured by the AI, this remained posi-
tively statistically significantly associated with T2D in the 
final model and so did the intermediate variables (phys-
ical inactivity, obesity and GDP) (table 1).
A statistically significant interaction was observed 
between urbanisation measured either as UP or AI and 
T2D prevalence across categories of country income 
(p=0.04 and p<0.001, respectively). When UP and AI 
where added to the same model, the former was esti-
mated to be significantly negatively associated with T2D 
(β=-0.047, 95% CI −0.088 to −0.005), while latter was 
significantly positively associated (β=0.066, 95% CI 0.030 
to 0.102) (table 2). When stratified by income categories, 
these associations were still significant only in middle-in-
come countries (table 2).
The association between urbanisation, intermediate 
variables and T2D varied across income categories: while 
none of the variables is associated with T2D prevalence in 
lower income countries, the AI is the only variable signifi-
cantly positively associated with T2D in lower income and 
middle-income countries (LMIC), irrespective of inter-
mediate variable levels. Upper middle-income countries 
with higher prevalence of T2D have higher AI, lower UP 
and higher GDP. Finally, in HIC only high prevalence of 
obesity and physical inactivity are associated with higher 
prevalence of T2D, irrespective of GDP and urbanisation 
(table 2).
dIscussIon
This is an ecological analysis investigating the determi-
nants of the association between urbanisation and T2D 
globally. While the proportion of people living in urban 
settings (UP) is, if anything, negatively associated with 
the prevalence of T2D, a measure of urban concentra-
tion (AI) is strongly positively associated with T2D prev-
alence. These associations are mediated, though not 
entirely explained, by the prevalence of some known 
risk factors for T2D (obesity and physical inactivity) and 
by lower GDP. Sugar consumption at country level is a 
determinant of obesity prevalence but is not associated 
per se to T2D prevalence. In turn, obesity is associated 
with physical inactivity, and both are then associated with 
increased prevalence of T2D.
Notably, urbanisation measured as UP or as AI has incon-
sistent effects on the risk of T2D. UP is based on member

urban or a rural area. Not only do these definitions differ 
widely by country, in many places the traditional urban 
/rural dichotomy is becoming increasingly inadequate.32 
The fact that this measure was negatively associated 
with T2D prevalence in the final model might therefore 
reflect the ‘urban advantage’ paradigm, where economic 
development, through urbanisation, improves social 
welfare.3 Having urban communities better spatial access 
to welfare facilities that offer preventative care contrib-
utes to increasing preventability of chronic diseases 
such as T2D.33 However, the AI, distinguishing between 
large urban cities that grow fast leading to highly densely 
populated areas and the emergence of new, manageable 
urban agglomerates, accounts—at least partially—for the 
‘urban advantage’ effect, and it is significantly positively 
associated with T2D prevalence.
The analysis by income categories suggests how the 
socioeconomic and lifestyle factors can prevail in modu-
lating the risk of T2D across different stages of the nutri-
tional transition these countries are going through. 
During the early phases of the transitions experienced 
by LMIC, agglomeration density measured by the AI is 
the only factor found to be associated with increased T2D 
prevalence. While the transition progresses, other socio-
economic factors, including GDP, play an important role 
in determining the risk of T2D, regardless of its lifestyle 
risk factor distribution (upper middle income countries 
(UMIC)). In HIC, by the end of the transition, lifestyle 
risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity are asso-
ciated with T2D prevalence, regardless of the socioeco-
nomic ones and urbanisation. This suggest that during 
the transition, a plethora of complex risk factors cluster 
according to socioeconomic variables so strongly as to 
making the individual effect of some of them negligible. 
Living in highly dense, overcrowded urban conditions 
that could increase the risk of T2D and other non-com-
municable diseases reflects the ‘urban penalty’ where, 
historically, low socioeconomic groups are spatially 
situated in concentric zones, exposing them to poorer 
lifestyle habits as well as poorer access to healthcare, sani-
tation and healthy nutritional options.34
Findings from individual studies mainly support this 
trend. Among LMIC, recent findings from India showed 
a higher prevalence of T2D in low socioeconomic groups 
living in the rapidly expanding urban areas of the more 
economically developed states.35 Among UMIC, data 
from Peru show how mortality and diabetes-specific 
mortality is higher in urban compared with rural context; 
internal migrants from rural to urban areas maintain their 
lower mortality risk, probably reflecting a healthy cohort 
effect.36 However, the longer migrants live in the new 
urban context, the higher their risk of becoming obese.37 
A multilevel analysis conducted in China, finding double 
diabetes prevalence in highly urban areas compared with 
rural ones, suggests that community economic factors, 
modern markets, communications and transportation 
infrastructure might be responsible for the differences.17 
In HIC, data coming from Oman, showed how diabetes, 
obesity, hypertension and high cholesterol were more 
prevalent in urban areas compared with rural ones.19 
In Greenland, among Inuits, diabetes was more preva-
lent in small town than big cities despite people in small 
town were found to be exercising more but also smoking 
more.20
The nutritional transition experienced at different 
levels by countries worldwide is strongly associated with 
the process of globalisation. Globalisation is associated 
with changing incomes and lifestyles, and it alters the 
quantity, type, cost and desirability of foods available for 
consumption by altering the nature of agrifood systems.38 
The ways globalisation impacts the nutritional transition 
are multiple and interconnected, for example, food 
trade and global sourcing, foreign direct investment, 
global advertising and retail reconstructing. However, 
determining which are the specific mechanisms by 
which globalisation alters diet quality and quantity is a 
challenge, and assessing their long-term health effect is 
even more complicated.39 40 Urbanisation has a pivotal 
role in the effect of globalisation on the nutritional tran-
sition, with the rise of multinational supermarkets and 
fast food chains expanding beyond urbanised areas and 
into smaller cities and towns. This allows producers to 
mobilise the supply of energy-dense foods and calorically 
sweetened beverages to new markets at cheap prices.41 
Urbanisation is also associated with occupation-related 
physical inactivity in the administrative and services 
sector that are incompatible with home food production 
and consumption, exacerbated by increasing infrastruc-
tures and transport networks that limit land available 
for cultivation and recreation.42 However, the effects of 
urbanisation on lifestyle are not immediate; most studies 
explore changes to health of rural to urban migrants over 
years to assess the impact of internal migration on health 
behaviours.7 Urban planning for increasing population 
health is becoming an emerging global challenge; eight 
interventions designed to encourage walking, cycling 
and public transport use while reducing private motor 
vehicle use were proposed, including equitable distri-
bution of employment across cities, designing pedes-
trian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, 
reducing distance to public transport and enhancing the 
desirability of active travel modes.43 However, this needs 
to be coupled to an adequate access to healthcare and 
health education and a minimised westernisation of diet 
in countries undergoing the nutritional transition.44
The main limitation of this study is its ecological design, 
which does not allow generalisation of the associations 
found at country level to an individual level (ecological 
fallacy).45 However, the present results are in line with 
previous ecological and observational study findings, 
indirectly arguing against ecological fallacy. An ecolog-
ical study investigating dietary patterns in association 
with diabetes prevalence found an increasing prevalence 
across agricultural/transitional/westernised nutrition 
patters which, in turn, were associated with increasing

urbanisation and decreasing physical activity.46 A system-
atic review of individual-based studies in Southeast Asia 
was also highly coherent with the present ecological find-
ings: point estimates of the associations between urban-
isation and diabetes coming from single studies were 
not poolable due to high heterogeneity. However, the 
association was shown to be modified by per-capita gross 
national income of the country where the study took 
place being much stronger in countries with a lower gross 
national income.47
Other limitations include genetic population strat-
ification, which could confound the results, with some 
ethnic groups (eg, South Asians) at higher genetic risk of 
T2D.48 49 Ethnicity-specific cut-offs of BMI were not used 
and therefore may underestimate obesity prevalence in 
some populations. A residual confounding effect could 
also be due to diet or other unmeasured variables. Finally, 
the analysis did not take directly into account access to 
healthcare, internal and external migration, literacy 
levels and education, which might account for some of 
the differences in T2D prevalence. The role of some of 
these factors might be particularly difficult to explore 
as they might lay on the causal pathway linking urban-
isation with T2D prevalence (ie, migration or access to 
healthcare).
conclusIon
The uncontrolled rapid growth of highly densely popu-
lated urban agglomerates is associated with an increased 
prevalence of T2D worldwide. In UMIC, which have 
nearly completed the epidemiological and nutritional 
transition, more densely urbanised and relatively richer 
economies have higher prevalence of T2D. In HIC, the 
prevalence of T2D is not associated with wealth nor 
urbanisation but with a more diabetogenic environ-
ment characterised by higher prevalence of obesity and 
physical inactivity. An urbanisation process effectively 
targeting urban planning, including access to healthcare, 
health inequalities associated to the rapid expansion of 
urban agglomerates; and the risks associated to the west-
ernisation of the diet might be effective in limiting the 
non-communicable disease epidemic in countries under-
going the epidemiological and nutritional transition.
