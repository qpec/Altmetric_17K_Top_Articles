Sepsis is a preventable public health
problem

Abstract
There is a paradigm shift happening for sepsis. Sepsis is no longer solely conceptualized as problem of individual
patients treated in emergency departments and intensive care units but also as one that is addressed as public
health issue with population- and systems-based solutions. We offer a conceptual framework for sepsis as a public
health problem by adapting the traditional model of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.
Keywords: Sepsis, Infection control, Public health, Prevention, Epidemiology
In 2017, the World Health Assembly and the World Health
Organization (WHA/WHO) adopted a resolution prioritiz-
ing the reduction of the global burden of sepsis [1]. While
clinical and scientific initiatives to date have primarily fo-
cused on the acute care of sepsis, the WHA/WHO reso-
lution offers a major contrasting paradigm—that sepsis is a
public health problem requiring population-based and
systems-based solutions. Such a shift has happened before
with myocardial infarction and stroke. While these were
once viewed solely as acute, unpreventable conditions,
today their prevention through the management of under-
lying chronic conditions is seen as one of the great public
health achievements of the twentieth century [2]. With sep-
sis pursuing a similar trajectory, familiar—but important—
questions arise. Can we reduce the attributable burden on
society? What systematic interventions are most effective
from a population perspective? And, ultimately, can we pre-
vent sepsis?
Along these lines, we might conceptualize sepsis using
the familiar model of primary, secondary, and tertiary pre-
vention (Fig. 1). In this context, primary prevention refers
to the prevention of infection or the sepsis event (i.e., on-
set of life-threatening organ dysfunction). Secondary pre-
vention refers to the early recognition and treatment of
sepsis. Tertiary prevention refers to in-hospital and post-
hospital treatment to mitigate the long-term conse-
quences of sepsis. While we know much about secondary
prevention, work remains to be done in the realms of pri-
mary and tertiary prevention.
With regards to the primary prevention of sepsis,
while sepsis may be new in the fields of public health,
the prevention of infection has been a guiding principle
for over 100 years. Today, systems continue to prevent
sepsis via myriad strategies applied to different, con-
stantly evolving scenarios. These include nationwide
vaccine campaigns and outbreak management; hospital-
wide policies on invasive medical devices, skin care,
sterile techniques, hand hygiene, and quarantine; clinic-
based surveillance and quarantine practices in high-risk
specialty clinics such as those treating patients with
cystic fibrosis; and individualized infection prophylaxis
among those with immune compromise. These strat-
egies have been immensely successful in reducing, and
even eliminating, some of the burden of infectious dis-
eases [2].
A second realm of primary prevention includes identi-
fying the characteristics of high sepsis-risk individuals,
similar to how the Framingham Study provided under-
standing of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
Early work with administrative healthcare data and con-
temporary cohorts such as the Reasons for Geographic
and Racial Differences in Stroke cohort have provided
major advancements to this knowledge gap for sepsis
[3–5]. These and future works will be critical to help
identify both modifiable risk factors and the risk groups
in which to target future primary and secondary preven-
tion strategies.

 The notion of secondary prevention of sepsis has exist-
ing familiar foundations in clinical initiatives underscoring
early recognition and treatment. Similar to myocardial in-
farction and stroke, sepsis has its “golden hours” where
treatment with antibiotics are much more effective in re-
ducing mortality [6, 7]. Today, the focus is on the effective
implementation of systems-based processes to reduce sep-
sis mortality such as those promulgated by the Surviving
Sepsis Campaign or those mandated by Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services [8–10]. Future directions in-
clude measures that continue to move sepsis care earlier,
with public awareness campaigns highlighting early recog-
nition, call-ahead triage or early treatment by emergency
medical services providers, and hospital-wide sepsis rapid
response teams. Along these lines, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have initiated a Get Ahead of Sep-
sis campaign to increase public awareness of the early rec-
ognition and treatment of sepsis [11, 12].
Tertiary prevention refers to measures to limit the down-
stream effects of sepsis, optimizing the post-sepsis health
trajectory. This trajectory includes sepsis recurrence, long-
term mortality, and long-term morbidity across domains of
psychological, cognitive, and physical function [13, 14].
While completing the picture of the total spectrum and so-
cietal burden of sepsis, the field of post-sepsis recovery is
still in its early phases. There is a current need for health
services and patient-centered outcomes research on strat-
egies to reduce the long-term mortality and morbidity in
sepsis. Until further evidence, the current strategies of ter-
tiary prevention remain those universal to high-quality crit-
ical care: lung-protective ventilation, early awakening and
mobility, early nutrition, reduction of device-associated
complications, skin care, and early rehabilitation, among
others. Future directions include examining interventions
in the post-hospital care of sepsis survivors, which occurs
across a variety of settings. These include long-term acute
care, short-term rehabilitation, and nursing home facilities
but may also involve acute care follow-up clinics.
While great public health benefits will result from the
inclusion of sepsis into global health priorities of infection
control, it is important to anticipate the challenges to this
paradigm shift. First, sepsis is not a clearly defined disease
entity but rather a nonspecific, clinical syndrome result-
ing from myriad combinations of pathogens, host re-
sponses, and organ dysfunctions. This creates conceptual
and practical challenges in targeting public health strat-
egies. Sepsis is difficult to diagnose, more difficult to sur-
veil, and uniform strategies for quarantine do not apply.
These challenges are compounded in resource-poor set-
tings where the sepsis burden is unknown but undoubt-
edly great. A second challenge this paradigm shift faces is
that the widespread adoption of early, empiric antibiotic
treatment may have consequences that are antithetical to
emerging principles in infection control. Specifically,
these include the inappropriate use of antibiotics leading
to depletion of a limited resource, an increase in adverse
drug toxicities, and continued emergence of antimicrobial
resistance.
The complexities of sepsis preclude any one-size-fits-
all public health policy. The needs and high-yield strat-
egies will differ between countries and healthcare sys-
tems and will depend on local pathogens, dominant host

 risk factors, strategies already in place, and resources.
We think that these issues are precisely why sepsis be-
longs within the domain of a comprehensive global pub-
lic health policy. A sepsis public health agenda that
incorporates components of prevention, containment,
early recognition, and treatment and balances policies
within the context of downstream effects on public
health is one that can achieve greater strides and, ultim-
ately, the prevention of sepsis.
