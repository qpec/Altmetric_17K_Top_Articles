ABSTRACT  
1 
Background/Objectives: Walking has well established positive relationships with, and 
2 
effects on, physical health. In contrast, while poor mental health contributes substantially to 
3 
global health burden, an overview of the benefits from walking has not previously been 
4 
published. We aimed to scope the literature and present what is known, and highlight what is 
5 
not known, about walking and mental health.   
6 
Methods: 
7 
Design: Scoping review 
8 
Data sources: Ovid (Medline), ProQuest, Web of Science 
9 
Screening and reporting: 13,014 records were identified and screened by a team of 
10 
researchers. Included full texts were analysed and reported according to mental health 
11 
outcome.    
12 
Results:  For the 8 mental health outcomes (identified a priori) there were a total of 5 
13 
systematic reviews and 50 individual papers included. Depression had the most evidence and 
14 
existing systematic reviews were reported. Evidence for anxiety, psychological stress, 
15 
psychological well-being, subjective well-being and social isolation and loneliness varied in 
16 
volume and effectiveness, but no harmful effects were identified. There were no studies for 
17 
walking and resilience.  The setting and context of walking seems to be important variables. 
18 
Conclusion: The evidence base that suggests walking benefits mental health is growing, but 
19 
remains fragmented and incomplete for some important outcomes. Policy and national guide-
20 
lines should promote the known mental health benefits of increased walking and future re-
21 
search should directly address the gaps we have identified.

What are the new findings? 
1 
 Over the last 20 years the evidence base for the beneficial effects of walking for men-
2 
tal health has grown, but remains fragmented and incomplete for some important out-
3 
comes; 
4 
 For depression and anxiety there may be sufficient evidence to promote walking to 
5 
prevent and treat these conditions; 
6 
 There has been more research on the negative disease based outcomes (such as de-
7 
pression and anxiety) than for the positive well-being outcomes (such as happiness or 
8 
subjective well-being); 
9 
 The evidence base seems to indicate that across the mental health outcomes there are 
10 
additional benefits from walking outdoors in natural environments compared to in-
11 
door, treadmill based walking.

INTRODUCTION 
1 
Regular walking is known to confer many physical health benefits including better physical 
2 
fitness, reduction in disease risk, and reduced risk of disease specific and all-cause mortality.1 
3 
2 In addition to physical health, mental health also contributes substantially to global health 
4 
burden 3 and there is well established evidence for the link between physical activity and 
5 
several mental health outcomes.4 This includes variable levels of evidence for: Depression, 
6 
Anxiety, Psychological Distress, Well-Being, Cognitive Function, Dementia, Sleep, Self-
7 
Esteem, Chronic Fatigue and Psychological Events. 4 
8 
  
9 
While the link between physical activity and mental health is well established,5 6 substantially 
10 
less is known about the role of walking in this respect.1 Morris and Hardman identified this 
11 
gap in their seminal “Walking to Health” paper in 1997 and stated that “The pleasurable and 
12 
therapeutic, psychological and social dimensions of walking, whilst evident, have been 
13 
surprisingly little studied”.7 Addressing this gap in knowledge is important as walking is an 
14 
accessible behaviour conducted by all ages and sexes, and as such one with great public 
15 
health potential.8  
16 
 
17 
Consequently, the aims of this review are to:  
18 
(i) 
Provide an overview of what has been learned in the intervening 20 years in re-
19 
gard to preventing mental ill-being, promoting mental well-being and intervention 
20 
effects;   
21 
(ii) 
Highlight current evidence gaps and research priorities.

METHODS 
1 
We adopted the established five stage scoping review process proposed by Arksey and 
2 
O’Malley.9  
3 
 
4 
Stage 1.1: Identify the research question 
5 
We formulated the following research question: “What is known about the associations and 
6 
effects of walking when considering various specified mental health outcomes?” 
7 
 
8 
For the purposes of this review, we adopted the following definition of walking which we 
9 
have used previously: walking was taken to mean all forms of purposeful or incidental biped-
10 
al locomotion within reasonable speed ranges (i.e. not running or jogging).1 
11 
 
12 
Stage 1.2: Identify the relevant outcomes 
13 
The review team discussed each mental health outcome identified in the 2008 Physical Activ-
14 
ity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report for relevance, appropriateness, and feasibility for 
15 
this study. 4 Two authors were Chartered Psychologists registered with the British Psycholog-
16 
ical Society and provided expert opinion in this process (NM, AN). Depression [Outcome 1 
17 
(O1)], Anxiety [O2], Self-Esteem [O3] were retained. Psychological Distress was classified 
18 
under Psychological Stress [O4]. Well-Being was split into Psychological Well-Being [O5] 
19 
and Subjective Well-Being [O6] due to established evidence for the differences between 
20 
these eudemonic and hedonic constructs. 10 11 Resilience [O7] and Social Isolation and Lone-
21 
liness [O8] were added as areas of particular mental health and public health interest. The 
22 
outcomes were given operational definitions as shown in Table 1.

Outcome 
Description  
1 
Depression 
Depression is a mood disorder categorised by prolonged periods of low mood, or 
lack of interest and/or pleasure in normal activities most of the time. Depression 
includes Dysthymia and Major Depressive Disorder.12 
  
2 
Anxiety  Anxiety is characterised by uncomfortable or upsetting thoughts, and is usually ac-
companied by agitation, feelings of tension, and activation of the autonomic nervous 
system. It is important to note the distinction between transient anxiety symptoms 
(state anxiety), persistent symptoms (trait anxiety), and anxiety disorders: a collec-
tion of disabling conditions characterised by excessive, chronic anxiety. Examples of 
anxiety disorders are: specific phobias, social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder, 
panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.4 
  
3 
Self-esteem 
Self-esteem is the feelings of value and worth that a person has for oneself. It con-
tributes to overall self-concept as a construct of mental health.13 
4 
Psychological 
stress 
Psychological stress or distress can be defined as the unique discomforting, emotion-
al state experienced by an individual in response to a specific stressor or demand that 
results in harm, either temporary or permanent, to that person.14   
 
5 
Psychological 
well-being 
Psychological well-being links with autonomy, environmental mastery, personal 
growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance.  This is 
often referred to as eudemonic well-being.10 
  
6 
Subjective well-
being 
Subjective well-being is defined as a person’s cognitive and affective evaluations of 
his or her life.  Often referred to as hedonic well-being (and closely aligned with the 
construct of happiness).11 
 
7 
Resilience 
Resilience refers to a steady trajectory of healthy functioning after a highly adverse 
event, or a conscious effort to continue in an insightful and integrated positive man-
ner as a result of lessons learned from an adverse experience.15  
 
8 
Social isolation 
and loneliness 
Social isolation is described as lack of a social network while loneliness is described 
as an unfulfilled social need.16 
 
 
3 
 
4 
 
5 
From the original list Dementia was classified under Cognitive Dysfunction (including Alz-
6 
heimer’s and Parkinson’s). These were considered neurological health rather than mental 
7 
health 3 and were not deemed within the scope of this review. Sleep, Chronic Fatigue and 
8 
Psychological Events were considered important but outside the scope and feasibility of this 
9 
review. Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was discussed extensively, but ultimately 
10 
excluded as it contains physical, social and mental components. Mood was also not included 
11 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
7 
 
as it is considered a comparatively transient state that cumulatively contributes more broadly 
1 
to what we have captured in subjective and psychological well-being. 17   
2 
 
3 
Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies 
4 
Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: 
5 
 Research articles in any geographical location or setting 
6 
 Published in English in peer-reviewed academic journals 
7 
 Specify quantitative effects of walking on the predetermined mental health outcomes 
8 
o Preventive effects (deleterious outcomes) 
9 
o Health promotion effects (positive outcomes) 
10 
o Intervention effects (all outcomes) 
11 
 Designs including: primary research studies (cross-sectional or longitudinal designs, 
12 
interventions or natural experiments with pre-post measures and a comparison), re-
13 
views, systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and meta-analyses of suitable primary re-
14 
search studies 
15 
 Include any age groups or sex  
16 
 
17 
Studies were excluded based on the following exclusion criteria: 
18 
 Focus only on clinical groups with a specific physical or mental illness or condition 
19 
that is not the illness or condition being treated with walking i.e. secondary mental 
20 
health (e.g. effects on depression in stroke patients) 
21 
 Evidence types including: guidelines, unpublished and ongoing trials, annual reports, 
22 
dissertations and conference proceedings 
23 
 Qualitative and ethnographic designs 
24 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
8 
 
 Editorials, opinion pieces, magazine and newspaper articles, case reports, papers with 
1 
no primary data 
2 
In studies of participants aged less than 18 years, pedometers were not considered measures 
3 
of walking exposure due to the likely large proportion of counts from other common forms of 
4 
physical activity (e.g. unstructured and structured play, and sporadic movement), but we did 
5 
retain this as a measurement method in adults for whom pedometer counts are  more likely to 
6 
reflect walking. 
7 
 
8 
Search strategy and databases 
9 
The strategy was designed to be as comprehensive as possible, within the constraints of time 
10 
and resource.9 We used the outcomes in Table 1 to define search terms that were adapted for 
11 
each relevant electronic database and combined with common walking terms. Search terms 
12 
and databases are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Searches were conducted in October 
13 
2017.  
14 
 
15 
Stage 3: Study selection 
16 
All identified records were uploaded to the online Covidence software 
17 
(https://www.covidence.org). Duplicates were automatically removed. Titles and abstracts 
18 
were reviewed by 2 researchers (PK, CW) with 20% cross-checked early in the process to 
19 
assess agreement. Full texts were reviewed independently by 2 researchers (PK, section lead) 
20 
with conflicts resolved by a third author. 
21 
 
22 
Scoping reviews are known to be iterative in nature as the researchers become more familiar 
23 
with the data.9 In this review it became apparent that O1: Depression had a more mature evi-
24 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
9 
 
dence base, characterised by many studies and a number of systematic reviews. We therefore 
1 
changed our methods and criteria to include only existing reviews for this outcome.  
2 
 
3 
Stage 4: Charting the data 
4 
For each outcome, key information from the relevant included texts was extracted into a 
5 
standard data form (modified for the depression systematic reviews). Information included: 
6 
author, year, location, design, sample size and characteristics, exposure or intervention char-
7 
acteristics, comparator or control characteristics, outcome measures and key findings. 
8 
 
9 
  
10 
Stage 5: Collating, summarising and reporting the results 
11 
The analytic framework for collating the data was the 8 mental health outcomes (see Table 
12 
1). The aim was to report relevant information on the volume, nature, distribution and charac-
13 
teristics of published studies. We utilised the ‘descriptive-analytical’ method from the narra-
14 
tive tradition, which involves applying a common analytical framework to all the primary 
15 
research reports and collecting standard information on each study.9 Narrative summaries for 
16 
each outcome as well as key concepts and related research gaps were reported.

RESULTS  
1 
In total, we identified 13,014 records from database searches. For depression we included 5 
2 
systematic reviews, while for resilience there were no included studies. Across the 6 other 
3 
outcomes, there were 50 included papers (see Figure 1) though some studies appeared in 
4 
more than one outcome. The findings for each outcome are reported below, with further 
5 
descriptive information in Supplementary table S2. 
6 
 
7 
Outcome 1:  Depression 
8 
Of the outcomes in this review, depression has the most developed evidence base. Specifical-
9 
ly, we report five systematic reviews. 18-22 There were no reviews of walking and prevention 
10 
of depression, but a 2013 systematic review of physical activity and the prevention of depres-
11 
sion included three prospective studies of walking and all found a protective effect. 23-25 Fur-
12 
ther studies that distinguish whether there are differential effects for demographics such as 
13 
age and gender/sex are needed.   
14 
 
15 
Considering treatment, Robertson et al (2012) concluded from 8 eligible randomised con-
16 
trolled trials (RCT) that walking was an effective intervention for clinical depression with an 
17 
effect size of -0.86. 19 This can be considered a large effect and is at least comparable to ef-
18 
fect sizes found in systematic reviews of exercise interventions for depression.26 This finding 
19 
strongly supports the use of walking as a treatment for depression, and yet more needs to be 
20 
known since 8 studies in this review remain a relatively small evidence base when consider-
21 
ing representation of all ages, genders and other relevant demographics.  
22 
 
23 
A systematic review focussed on walking group interventions concluded they were effective 
24 
for reducing depression scores. 20 However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously as 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
11 
 
it was not clear if depression was clinically defined and study design was not limited to ran-
1 
domised controlled trials. A further recent systematic review and meta-analysis looked at the 
2 
effects of physical activity on post-natal depression (PND) and weight-loss.21 Four of the nine 
3 
included studies were walking or pram-walking (with a 5th including walking) but effects on 
4 
PND were no better than comparison groups. 
5 
 
6 
A 2013 systematic review examined modes and settings in effective physical activity inter-
7 
ventions to treat depression, identifying 5 eligible RCTs.22 The authors concluded that indoor 
8 
or outdoor walking was a beneficial aerobic exercise to treat depression. They recommended 
9 
at least some supervision, performed three to four times weekly at a moderate or self-selected 
10 
intensity for 30–40 min over a period of at least nine weeks. 
11 
 
12 
Outcome 2:  Anxiety 
13 
We identified 14 studies focusing on associations between walking and anxiety.27-40 After 
14 
depression this was the second biggest evidence base. Of five cross-sectional studies, four 
15 
showed an association between walking and lower anxiety scores 27-30 while one did not 32. 
16 
Heesch et al., (2012) also found dose-response associations in prospective models. 30  
17 
 
18 
Four studies investigated the acute effects of walking on anxiety and found mixed effects. 35-
19 
37 40 Five studies compared walking interventions to a comparison condition over time (6-12 
20 
weeks) and found favourable treatment effects. 31 33 34 38 39  
21 
 
22 
Overall, walking appears to be beneficial for anxiety. Despite our attempts to operationalise 
23 
the meaning of “anxiety” a priori this remains a broad construct, which made it difficult to 
24 
draw over-all conclusions. Given the magnitude of the global burden of anxiety this may be 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
12 
 
sufficient rationale for more focussed study of walking and anxiety. There is a clear need to 
1 
develop more prospective epidemiology that could assess both walking and persistent symp-
2 
toms of anxiety and or clinically defined anxiety disorders. 
3 
 
4 
Outcome 3:  Self-esteem 
5 
We identified 11 studies that examined the association between walking and global self-
6 
esteem (GSE).36 41-50  There were two cross-sectional studies that examined the relationship 
7 
between walking and GSE.42 43  Both reported no association. We found no prospective anal-
8 
yses. Two acute studies reported benefit on GSE following a single bout of walking.36 44  
9 
 
10 
There were seven intervention studies that compared walking condition(s) with another con-
11 
dition over time (8-12 weeks) with both favourable and null effect findings.41 45-50 Walking 
12 
programmes varied in length from eight weeks to 12 months, and in frequency, duration, in-
13 
tensity, and progression of dose. Two studies suggested significant improvement in GSE fol-
14 
lowing walking compared with comparator groups.  Three of the studies suggested significant 
15 
improvement in GSE following walking, but this was no greater than the comparator, and two 
16 
studies showed no change in GSE.  
17 
 
18 
Overall, the evidence suggests that walking interventions have a positive effect on self-
19 
esteem, but observational findings were limited. Whilst not a focus of this review, several of 
20 
the included studies also incorporated other measures of self-perception (e.g., physical self-
21 
worth) that contemporary theoretical perspectives of ‘self’ would suggest are more suscepti-
22 
ble to change following walking than GSE, and particularly in acute studies. 51  
23 
 
24 
Outcome 4: Psychological stress 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
13 
 
We identified six studies that examined the relationship between walking and psychological 
1 
stress.32 37 52-55 One cross-sectional study showed a large significant association 32 and another 
2 
showed a small non-significant association 32 . Threes studies assessed the acute effects of 
3 
walking on psychological stress 55 37 54 and findings were contradictory. One four week long 
4 
intervention showed promising effects at intervention completion but had no effect at 12 
5 
week follow-up. 53 
6 
 
7 
In summary, there is emerging but limited evidence that walking is associated with lower 
8 
psychological stress in observational studies, and that can be used as a potentially promising 
9 
intervention to decrease psychological stress. It is however clear that available evidence is not 
10 
yet sufficient for firm conclusions. 
11 
 
12 
Outcome 5:  Psychological well-being 
13 
We identified 11 studies that examined the association between walking and psychological 
14 
well-being (PWB).32 34 56-59,60-64 There were three cross-sectional studies that examined the 
15 
association between walking and PWB.  The findings generally supported a positive associa-
16 
tion between PWB and walking. 62 32 60 One large scale longitudinal study showed positive 
17 
findings for walking for transport .63 There were no acute studies. 
18 
 
19 
Seven RCT studies compared the effects of walking interventions on PWB with another con-
20 
dition (typically minimal intervention) over 10-15 weeks. The findings were mixed with in-
21 
stances of no improvements, no between group effects, and some positive effects for walk-
22 
ing.34 56-59 61 64  A targeted review to understand the differential effects of intervention design 
23 
and/or study quality may be required.   
24 
 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
14 
 
To conclude, the evidence is limited but promising with cross-sectional studies and the one 
1 
longitudinal study identifying positive relationships between walking and PWB.  The find-
2 
ings from the intervention studies are more mixed with only two of seven studies demonstrat-
3 
ing positive effects on PWB compared to control groups.   
4 
 
5 
Outcome 6: Subjective well-being 
6 
We identified twelve studies focusing on associations between walking and subjective well-
7 
being (SWB). 32 36 40 65-73 There was diversity in how SWB was described and measured in the 
8 
identified papers including life satisfaction, happiness, emotional well-being and affective 
9 
response. From four cross-sectional studies, three found significant associations between 
10 
higher levels of walking and better SWB 32 65 66 69 Two prospective cohort studies found weak 
11 
but statistically significant relationships between walking and subsequent SWB. 70 68  
12 
 
13 
Five studies found positive acute effects for a single bout of walking on indicators of SWB. 36 
14 
40 71-73 One intervention compared walking to stretching and toning over 6 months and found 
15 
equivalent improvements in “happiness” and “life satisfaction” in both groups. 67  
16 
 
17 
In summary, cross-sectional, prospective cohort and acute studies indicate an association be-
18 
tween walking and SWB. The only long-term intervention study was inconclusive and further 
19 
studies are clearly required. 
20 
 
21 
Outcome 7: Resilience 
22 
The relationship between physical activity and resilience is emerging,74 with associations 
23 
shown in undergraduate students74 and healthy adults.75  However, we identified no published 
24 
journal articles addressing the association specifically between walking and resilience.  
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
15 
 
 
1 
Outcome 8: Social isolation and loneliness 
2 
The topic of “social health” is broad, and for the purposes of this scoping review we have 
3 
restricted the focus to social isolation and loneliness given their direct impact on mental 
4 
health.76 We identified five studies.67 77-80 A cross-sectional study found significant positive 
5 
associations for frequency of contacts with neighbours, neighbours’ social support, neigh-
6 
bourhood involvement and participation, and walking behaviour.77 However, four interven-
7 
tion studies showed mixed evidence. 78 79 80 67 
8 
 
9 
As noted previously,76 81 the social environment is complex and lacks consensus regarding 
10 
definitions of core constructs, which we believe has limited this scoping review. In line with 
11 
the call to action by Hunter et al (2018) in this special edition,76 further research in this area is 
12 
required to: 1) create a taxonomy providing a consensus of definitions for core concepts of 
13 
the social environment; 2) synthesise this complex evidence base to better guide the devel-
14 
opment of theory and conceptual models for walking behaviour and mental health; 3) develop 
15 
interventions that utilise walking to promote social interactions to enrich existing social net-
16 
works, or help create new social networks.

Summary of key findings for mental health outcomes 
19 
Table 2 summarizes the state of the evidence for walking and the 8 mental health outcomes 
20 
included in this study. Depression and anxiety are the two outcomes with consistent evidence 
21 
for beneficial effects. Self-esteem, PWB, SWB and psychological stress have either limited 
22 
or mixed findings for prevention and treatment.  We found no studies investigating resilience. 
23 
Social isolation and loneliness remains a particularly complex area requiring further concep-
24 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
16 
 
tual mapping. The volume and distribution of study type suggests that there is a particular 
1 
evidence gap for prospective designs (see Figure 2).

DISCUSSION  
1 
We aimed to scope and understand what is known about the associations and effects of walk-
2 
ing when considering various specified mental health outcomes. To our knowledge this is the 
3 
first   review of the evidence of multiple mental health outcomes and walking. We have 
4 
shown areas where the evidence base is well developed, and also areas where it is limited and 
5 
findings are mixed. 
6 
 
7 
Key concepts and research gaps in the walking and mental health literature 
8 
Having addressed the nature and sources of evidence for walking and mental health, we then 
9 
mapped the key concepts in the included studies and highlighted research gaps and priorities.9 
10 
These are displayed in Figure 3, organised in five overall themes; (i) context of walking, (ii) 
11 
dose of walking, (iii) study design, (iv) demographic effects, (v) conceptual framework.  
12 
 
13 
Context of walking  
14 
A considerable proportion of studies compared the effect of setting or type of walking. Addi-
15 
tional papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria included studies on types of outdoor en-
16 
vironment,82 green environments compared to urban,83-85 forest settings,86 parks compared to 
17 
woodlands,87 and green exercise that included walking.88 They suggested a multitude of posi-
18 
tive effects on a range of mental health outcomes for green, outdoor, and natural environ-
19 
ments, with variations by types of green settings. 
20 
 
21 
A 2011 systematic review of indoor versus outdoor exercise identified 11 studies, seven of 
22 
which were walking.89 Outdoor walking showed positive effects across a range of mental 
23 
health outcomes compared to indoor walking, as well as increased intention for future 
24 
walking. However, the authors concluded that there was still a paucity of high quality 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
18 
 
evidence. A 2010 systematic review of mental health effects of walking in natural versus 
1 
synthetic environments had similar findings. 90 Conversely, the social context, whether 
2 
walking alone, with friends, partners, or in a group has not been extensively studied. 
3 
 
4 
There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on purpose of walking. This issue may 
5 
be more critical than physiological dose for both effect and public health messaging. Very 
6 
few studies we identified compared, for example, commuter walking to leisure walking or 
7 
dog walking. Furthermore, the difference between walking by choice, or necessity, is not well 
8 
understood. More needs to be known about the role of context of walking, and this is a clear 
9 
research priority. 
10 
 
11 
Dose of walking 
12 
Differential “dose-response” effects by frequency, duration, intensity, and length of interven-
13 
tion or exposure time are not yet well understood. More needs to be known about the optimal 
14 
dose of walking to benefit different mental health outcomes and the relative importance of 
15 
this factor. Intensity of walking, is a particular area of interest. The differences between a 
16 
brisk walk, a slow shuffle, and the differential effects as fitness declines with age and relative 
17 
intensity of walking increases needs to be better understood for effective public health mes-
18 
saging and intervention. Increasing evidence suggests physiological health effects for walk-
19 
ing differ by intensity (Stamatakis (2018) in this special edition); it is important to understand 
20 
if the same is true for mental health. 
21 
 
22 
Understanding these dose related factors will be intrinsically linked to how walking is meas-
23 
ured. When considering intensity, self-report measures can explore perceived intensity, with-
24 
in the limitations of recall bias, while objective measures like pedometers may be able to as-
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
19 
 
sess cadence. Measures of pace/speed and associated measurement of aerobic fitness or re-
1 
sponse may be required. Our scoping review found that measurement of walking varies con-
2 
siderably, and much learning is required in this area. 
3 
 
4 
Study design 
5 
In terms of study design, there are evidence gaps around the nature and content of compari-
6 
son conditions, sample sizes with many small studies, and insufficiently powered analyses of 
7 
mental health outcomes as secondary or tertiary outcomes. Selection and application of ap-
8 
propriate mental health measures is also a key concept in the literature. 
9 
 
10 
Demographic effects 
11 
The effects of walking by sex, age, socioeconomic status and other important demographics 
12 
remains a research priority. We are not able to say if existing evidence is generalizable across 
13 
demographics. The potential interaction of demographics with dose and context of walking is 
14 
another important research gap. 
15 
 
16 
Conceptual framework for walking and mental health 
17 
This review highlights areas where the theory of walking and mental health could be expand-
18 
ed through development of an appropriate conceptual framework. The different outcomes, the 
19 
complexity of the outcomes, the development of ecologically valid interventions, and under-
20 
standing the mechanisms could benefit from an agreed framework. 
21 
 
22 
There is comparatively less research on mental well-being (e.g. SWB, self-esteem) as op-
23 
posed to mental ill-being (e.g. depression, anxiety) particularly for interventions. It is im-
24 
portant to note that these are independent mental health constructs rather than descriptors that 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
20 
 
sit at opposite ends of the same spectrum. While the absence of depression or anxiety is clear-
1 
ly desirable, it does not necessarily equate to high levels of SWB or self-esteem. This mirrors 
2 
the overall definition of health - not merely the absence of disease, but the presence of well-
3 
being - and serves as a reminder of the holistic nature of public health in practice. It may also 
4 
be an important factor to consider when developing public health messaging that is targeted 
5 
at behaviour change. Specifically, positive messages about improving well-being through 
6 
walking may resonate more with segments of the population than the disease aversion mes-
7 
sages that have historically pervaded the health promotion sector. Further investigation of the 
8 
relative contribution of walking to well-being and ill-being outcomes is indicated and should 
9 
also take into the account the most effective methods to influence physical activity behaviour. 
10 
 
11 
The complexity of the mental health domain was a key theme. To quote one of the included 
12 
studies “Mental health is a vast and complex domain, which reaches far beyond symptoms, 
13 
disorders and diagnoses.” 32 Whether studies looking at single outcomes could address this 
14 
domain adequately is for discussion. The reductionist nature of examining these outcomes in 
15 
isolation may not be appropriate when considering the interwoven nature of psychological 
16 
constructs and the high prevalence of comorbid mental illnesses, while studies with multiple 
17 
outcomes may be accused of cherry-picking favourable findings. Furthermore, despite efforts 
18 
to define different mental health outcomes in the literature, there appears to be ongoing con-
19 
fusion and conjecture in the language to describe these constructs. This was particularly chal-
20 
lenging when attempting to categorise studies that used varying outcome definitions.  
21 
 
22 
To have population-level effects, there is a need to transfer promising laboratory and tread-
23 
mill findings to ecologically valid, free-living settings. This will require the development of 
24 
robust programme theory to understand and evaluate delivery and impact. Similarly, the need 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
21 
 
to establish and understand mechanisms of effect is an important priority for future research. 
1 
For example, is it the physiological dose of walking that provides the effect, or is walking a 
2 
vector for increased social contact and support? Or is it a combination of pathways? 91 Fur-
3 
thermore, the interaction and relative importance of the contextual setting (e.g. forest trail vs 
4 
urban street) of walking and its underlying purpose (e.g. leisure vs commute) remains un-
5 
clear.  
6 
 
7 
Implications and future research 
8 
Our findings suggest that while the gap identified by Morris and Hardman has seen a growth 
9 
in research and evidence, it is not as developed as other areas (e.g. physiological responses, 
10 
cardiovascular disease, or all cause-mortality). Nor is it as developed as we expected when 
11 
we began this review. Specifically, once mental health was categorised into individual 
12 
outcomes, in many cases the number of studies found was not high. There remains a vast 
13 
number of questions and evidence gaps as summarised in Figure 3.  
14 
 
15 
The implications for future research clearly include addressing the limited volume and quality 
16 
of prospective and intervention studies for each mental health outcome. In terms of policy 
17 
and practice, discussion and expert consensus is required on whether the current evidence 
18 
base is sufficient to make recommendations for walking and mental health. For example, to 
19 
what extent could the mental health benefits of walking be included in the upcoming update 
20 
of physical activity guidelines by the UK Chief Medical Officers? 
21 
 
22 
Strengths and limitations 
23 
The present study has a number of strengths. It is the first review of such a broad range of 
24 
mental health outcomes specific to walking. It considers both prevention and intervention 
25 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
22 
 
effects, and it identifies the volume and distribution of the evidence base. This has shown 
1 
where we have good evidence for walking, and where more research is warranted. We have 
2 
also mapped the key concepts and research priorities within the literature. 
3 
 
4 
There are a number of limitations to consider. We only included quantitative studies. This 
5 
decision was made as qualitative designs address different questions out-with our research 
6 
aims. However, several qualitative studies were evident in the searches and a similar review 
7 
of this evidence could be highly instructive. As with any review, publication bias is an issue. 
8 
It is not clear how many other studies showed no effect or deleterious effects and were not 
9 
published. 
10 
 
11 
In many studies walking was reported as physical activity or aerobic-exercise. Alternatively, 
12 
the exposure or intervention was walking and running/jogging or progression from walking to 
13 
jogging. This excluded a large volume of literature. We did not include a number of critical 
14 
outcomes such as dementia, cognitive function, mood, and HRQoL. These contribute sub-
15 
stantially to health burden. Additionally, we did not include secondary effects in clinical pop-
16 
ulations. There is a substantial volume of literature in these populations that may need scop-
17 
ing in the future. 
18 
 
19 
It was necessary to limit our search terms and publication language to ensure the review was 
20 
feasible and focussed. It is possible we missed some important literature and a broader search 
21 
strategy would have identified additional relevant studies.  
22 
 
23 
Conclusions 
24 
 Walking to Health 2017: Walking and mental health 
 
23 
 
Walking is known to benefit physical health. We have shown how the evidence base for spe-
1 
cific mental health outcomes and benefits has grown since Morris and Hardman’s “Walking 
2 
to Health” review in 1997.7 In 1997, they stated that “The pleasurable and therapeutic, psy-
3 
chological and social dimensions of walking, whilst evident, have been surprisingly little 
4 
studied”. Despite the growth in the evidence base, given the importance of mental health, and 
5 
the evidence gaps identified, we think this statement still holds true. We anticipate that this 
6 
scoping review will stimulate more research in this area.
