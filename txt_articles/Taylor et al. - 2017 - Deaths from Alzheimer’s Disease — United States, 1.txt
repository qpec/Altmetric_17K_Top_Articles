Deaths from Alzheimer’s Disease — United States, 1999–2014
Christopher A. Taylor, PhD1; Sujay F. Greenlund2; Lisa C. McGuire, PhD1; Hua Lu, MS1; Janet B. Croft, PhD1
Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s), an ultimately fatal form 
of dementia, is the sixth leading cause of death in the United 
States, accounting for 3.6% of all deaths in 2014 (1,2). 
Alzheimer’s deaths can be an indicator of paid and unpaid 
caregiver burden because nearly everyone in the final stages 
of Alzheimer’s needs constant care, regardless of the setting, as 
the result of functional and cognitive declines (2). To examine 
deaths with Alzheimer’s as the underlying cause, state-level 
and county-level death certificate data from the National Vital 
Statistics System for the period 1999–2014 were analyzed. A 
total of 93,541 Alzheimer’s deaths occurred in the United States 
in 2014 at an age-adjusted (to the 2000 standard population) 
rate of 25.4 deaths per 100,000 population, a 54.5% increase 
compared with the 1999 rate of 16.5 deaths per 100,000. Most 
deaths occurred in a nursing home or long-term care facility. 
The percentage of Alzheimer’s decedents who died in a medical 
facility (e.g., hospital) declined from 14.7% in 1999 to 6.6% 
in 2014, whereas the percentage who died at home increased 
from 13.9% in 1999 to 24.9% in 2014. Significant increases 
in Alzheimer’s deaths coupled with an increase in the number 
of persons with Alzheimer’s dying at home have likely added 
to the burden on family members or other unpaid caregivers. 
Caregivers might benefit from interventions such as education, 
respite care, and case management that can lessen the potential 
burden of caregiving and can improve the care received by 
persons with Alzheimer’s.
Mortality data for 1999–2014 were analyzed using CDC 
WONDER (https://wonder.cdc.gov). The data were provided 
by the National Vital Statistics System and based on informa-
tion from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states 
and the District of Columbia (DC). The period analyzed 
represented all of the years with U.S. mortality data available 
at the time of analysis* using the International Classification 
of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code set, which was 
implemented in 1999. CDC WONDER queries were used 
to generate the number of deaths with Alzheimer’s reported 
as the underlying cause of death, along with unadjusted and 
age-adjusted death rates with 95% confidence intervals and 
standard errors for groups defined by characteristics including 
year, sex, age group (≤64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, American 
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic), 
urban-rural classification, state, and county.
The percentages of Alzheimer’s deaths that occurred in medi-
cal facilities, the decedent’s home, hospice facility, or nursing 
home/long-term care facilities also were obtained. County-level 
data were examined for the aggregated years of 2005–2014 
because the geographic distribution for 1999–2004 data were 
* Before the release of 2015 National Vital Statistics System data on December 9, 2016.

inconsistent with more recent data and would have obscured 
any current geographic patterns. ICD-10 codes G30.0, G30.1, 
G30.8, and G30.9 were used to identify Alzheimer’s as the 
underlying cause of death. These codes are used by CDC to 
describe Alzheimer’s as a leading cause of death (1). Other 
forms of dementia were not examined in this analysis.
Mortality rates were calculated using population estimates 
produced by the U.S. Census Bureau in collaboration with 
CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Age-adjusted 
mortality rates were calculated using the 2000 U.S. standard 
population. The z-statistic (assuming a normal approxima-
tion for the distribution of rates) was used to compare rates at 
a statistical significance level of p<0.05. No adjustment was 
made for multiple comparisons. Joinpoint regression was used 
to test the significance of trends in age-specific rates for the 
period 1999–2014.
From 1999 to 2014, age-specific rates of deaths attributed 
to Alzheimer’s increased among adults aged 75–84 years from 
129.5 to 185.6 per 100,000 population and among adults 
aged ≥85 years, from 601.3 to 1,006.8. The largest increase 
in the rates of Alzheimer’s deaths among adults aged ≥85 years 
occurred from 1999 to 2005, compared with 2005–2014 
(p<0.001) (Figure 1). Since 2005, although the mortality rate 
has continued to increase, the rate of increase was not as large 
as 1999–2005.
The age-adjusted Alzheimer’s death rate per 100,000 popu-
lation increased from 16.5 (44,536 deaths) in 1999 to 25.4 
(93,541 deaths) in 2014, an increase of 54.5% (Table). In 
2014, rates were higher compared with 1999 among all age 
groups; also in 2014 rates were higher among women com-
pared with men and among non-Hispanic whites compared 
with other racial/ethnic populations (Table). In 2014, death 
rates for Alzheimer’s were lower among residents of large 
central metropolitan areas and large fringe metropolitan areas 
compared with residents in other urban-rural classifications.
From 1999 to 2014, rates of Alzheimer’s deaths significantly 
increased for 41 states and DC (Table). Only one state, Maine, 
had a significant decrease in age-adjusted Alzheimer’s deaths. 
Age-adjusted rates for all 50 states and DC ranged from 7.0 to 
29.8 per 100,000 in 1999 and from 10.7 to 43.6 per 100,000 
in 2014.
Using average annual county-level data for the period 
2005–2014, age-adjusted rates of Alzheimer’s deaths ranged 
from 4.3 to 123.7 per 100,000 (Figure 2). Counties with the 
highest age-adjusted rates were primarily in the Southeast, plus 
some additional areas in the Midwest and West.
Most Alzheimer’s decedents died in a nursing home or long-
term care facility in 1999 (67.5%) and 2014 (54.1%). The 
percentage who died in a medical facility declined from 14.7% 
in 1999 to 6.6% in 2014. In contrast, the percentage who died 
at home increased from 13.9% in 1999 to 24.9% in 2014, 
with an additional 6.1% who died in a hospice facility in 2014.

Symptoms of early stage Alzheimer’s include memory loss 
that interferes with daily activities, difficulties with problem

solving, losing or misplacing objects, and changes in mood 
and personality. As Alzheimer’s progresses, the brain’s ability 
to control language and reasoning becomes impaired. Persons 
might have problems recognizing family and friends or per-
forming multistep tasks such as getting dressed. In advanced 
stages, persons with Alzheimer’s might be bedridden, have 
difficulty communicating, swallowing, or controlling bowel 
or bladder functions (2).
Adults aged ≥65 years are at greatest risk for develop-
ing Alzheimer’s (2). The number of Alzheimer’s deaths has 
increased, in part, because of a growing population of older 
adults. With the number of older adults increasing, the 
prevalence of Alzheimer’s is projected to quadruple by 2050 
(3). However, age-adjusted rates of Alzheimer’s deaths have 
been increasing since 1979 (4). Although the actual number 
Alzheimer’s deaths might be increasing, the increase in the rate 
of Alzheimer’s deaths might also be attributed to increases in 
premorbid Alzheimer’s diagnosis by patients seeking care for 
symptoms and increased reporting by physicians, coroners, 
and medical examiners who assign causes of death.
Studies have shown that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics 
are more likely to have Alzheimer’s because of a wide variety of 
factors including increased cardiovascular disease risk factors 
(5). In contrast, this analysis showed that non-Hispanic whites 
have higher rates of Alzheimer’s deaths. The causes of the racial 
differences in the increase in Alzheimer’s death rates might be 
the result of competing causes of mortality; 
when compared with non-Hispanic whites, 
non-Hispanic blacks have higher rates for death 
from cardiovascular disease at younger ages (6).
It is important to note that the largest 
increase in the mortality rate occurred in older 
adults aged ≥85 years for the years 1999–2005. 
Since 2005, the mortality rate in this age group 
has continued to increase, but at a slower pace. 
This study did not directly examine factors that 
might have contributed to the sharp increase 
in reported deaths from 1999 to 2005 or the 
subsequent slowing of this increase. Increases in 
the mortality rate for Alzheimer’s might be the 
result of corresponding decreases in mortality 
rates for competing causes of death, including 
cardiovascular disease and stroke (2,6).
The increasing rates of Alzheimer’s deaths 
are not only problematic because of their 
obvious direct health effects on persons 
with Alzheimer’s. The debilitating nature of 
Alzheimer’s means that there are financial 
and societal costs borne by patients and their 
families, and by states and counties that oper-
ate publicly funded long-term care facilities. 
It is estimated that total health and long-term care costs for 
persons with Alzheimer’s and other dementias in the United 
States will total $259 billion in 2017, more than two thirds 
of which is expected to be covered by public sources such as 
Medicare and Medicaid (2). Additionally, most care provided 
to older adults with Alzheimer’s who do not live in long-term 
care facilities is provided by family members or other unpaid 
caregivers (7). In 2015, caregivers of persons with dementia, 
including Alzheimer’s, provided 18.2 billion hours of unpaid 
assistance (2). These caregiving hours might correspond to 
increased financial costs for caregivers and decreased work 
productivity, as caregivers might take leave from work to ensure 
adequate care is provided. The societal costs are substantial 
when considered in the context of the estimated 5.5 million 
U.S. residents who live with Alzheimer’s (2).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, several factors relating to the assigned cause of 
death might affect estimates of death involving Alzheimer’s. 
Evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s deaths reported on death 
certificates might be underestimates of the actual number of 
Alzheimer’s deaths in the United States (8). Because cases were 
identified using the underlying cause of death, persons with 
Alzheimer’s but a non-Alzheimer’s underlying cause of death 
were not identified in this analysis. Second, complications 
from Alzheimer’s, such as pneumonia, might be reported as the

cause of death although the actual underlying cause of death, 
Alzheimer’s, was not reported on the death certificate. Finally, 
a person with Alzheimer’s might have dementia assigned as the 
underlying cause of death rather than a more specific diagnosis 
of Alzheimer’s.
Some modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such 
as obesity and fewer years of education, have been identified as 
factors associated with an increased risk for dementia (9,10). 
Although some treatments have been demonstrated to alleviate 
symptoms of Alzheimer’s, there is no cure or definitive means of 
prevention (2). Until Alzheimer’s can be prevented, slowed, or 
stopped, caregiving for persons with advanced Alzheimer’s will 
remain a demanding task. An increasing number of Alzheimer’s 
deaths coupled with an increasing number of patients dying at 
home suggests that there is an increasing number of caregivers of 
persons with Alzheimer’s. It is likely that these caregivers might 
benefit from interventions such as education, respite care, and case 
management that can lessen the potential burden of caregiving.

 * Alzheimer’s disease deaths in the National Vital Statistics System mortality file were identified using underlying cause-of-death International Classification of Disease, 
Tenth Revision codes G30.0, G30.1, G30.8, and G30.9.
 † Statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in rates for 1999 and 2014 using the z-statistic.
 § Age-adjusted death rates for all groups except age groups were standardized to the 2000 projected U.S. standard population.
 ¶ Records without a specified Hispanic origin were excluded from this section.
 ** The National Center for Health Statistics urban-rural classification scheme classifies all U.S. counties into six levels that include large central metro (counties in 
metropolitan statistical areas [MSA] of ≥1 million population that also contain the entire population of the principal city of the MSA, or have their entire population 
contained in the largest principal city of the MSA, or contain at least 250,000 inhabitants of any principal city of the MSA); large fringe metro (counties in MSAs of 
≥1 million population that did not qualify as large central metro counties; medium metro (counties in MSAs with populations of 250,000–999,999); small metro 
(counties in MSAs with populations <250,000); micropolitan (counties in a micropolitan statistical area that includes one or more urban clusters of 2,500–49,999 
inhabitants that form the core and might contain outlying counties that meet specified requirements of commuting to or from the central counties); and noncore 
or rural nonmetropolitan counties that did not qualify as micropolitan.
 †† State estimates are based on values from the entire state and not just from those counties that had available county-level data.
TABLE. (Continued) Number, unadjusted rates, and age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population for Alzheimer’s disease deaths* as the underlying 
cause of death by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, urban-rural classification, and state — United States, 1999 and 2014
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s) is the most common cause of 
dementia. It currently affects an estimated 5.5 million adults in 
the United States and is expected to affect 13.8 million U. S. 
adults aged ≥65 years by 2050.
What is added by this report?
Age-adjusted rates of Alzheimer’s mortality significantly 
increased in 41 states and the District of Columbia from 1999 to 
2014. Counties with the highest age-adjusted rates were 
primarily in the Southeast, plus some additional areas in the 
Midwest and West. Significant increases in Alzheimer’s deaths 
coupled with an increase in the number of persons with 
Alzheimer’s dying at home suggest that the burden on 
caregivers has increased even more than the increase in the 
number of deaths.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Given the increasing number of Alzheimer’s deaths and persons 
with Alzheimer’s dying at home, there is a growing number of 
caregivers who likely can benefit from interventions like 
education, respite care, and home health assistance; such 
interventions can lessen the burden of caregiving and can 
improve the care received by persons with Alzheimer’s.
