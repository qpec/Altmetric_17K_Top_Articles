Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and cardiometabolic effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction
(MBSR) in women with overweight or obesity.
Methods: Eighty-six women with BMI � 25 kg/m2 were randomized to 8 weeks of MBSR or health edu-
cation and followed for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the Toronto Mindfulness Scale. Secondary
outcomes included the Perceived Stress Scale-10, fasting glucose, and blood pressure.
Results: Compared to health education, the MBSR group demonstrated significantly improved mind-
fulness at 8 weeks (mean change from baseline, 4.5 vs. 21.0; P 5 0.03) and significantly decreased
perceived stress at 16 weeks (23.6 vs. 21.3, P 5 0.01). In the MBSR group, there were significant
reductions in fasting glucose at 8 weeks (28.9 mg/dL, P 5 0.02) and at 16 weeks (29.3 mg/dL,
P 5 0.02) compared to baseline. Fasting glucose did not significantly improve in the health education
group. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, weight, or insulin resistance in the MBSR
group.
Conclusions: In women with overweight or obesity, MBSR significantly reduces stress and may have
beneficial effects on glucose. Future studies demonstrating long-term cardiometabolic benefits of MBSR
will be key for establishing MBSR as an effective tool in the management of obesity.

Introduction
More than two-thirds of US adults have overweight or obesity,
which increases their risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease
(1). Stress could exacerbate obesity and its cardiometabolic comor-
bidities by impeding the adoption of healthy behaviors, altering the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous
system and increasing chronic inflammation (2-5). However, there is
a lack of effective interventions targeting stress in obesity.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), the most researched
mindfulness-based intervention, may be beneficial for reducing stress
and cardiometabolic risk in patients with overweight or obesity (6-8).
Potential mechanisms by which MBSR could improve cardiometa-
bolic
outcomes
include
physiological
changes
in
cortisol
and
catecholamines, psychological changes in depressive and anxiety
symptoms, self-regulation, resilience, and coping, and behavioral
changes in diet and physical activity (5,7,9,10). Mindfulness-based
interventions, including MBSR, have been shown to decrease stress in
various patient populations (11-17). Mindfulness-based eating aware-
ness training, developed for binge eating disorder, reduces binge eat-
ing episodes, improves self-control, and may promote weight loss
(18). Mindfulness-based interventions have also been preliminarily
shown to improve glucose and blood pressure in patients with diabe-
tes (19-21). However, the cardiometabolic effects of MBSR have not
been well studied in populations with overweight or obesity. We
therefore conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the feasi-
bility and effects of MBSR in women with overweight or obesity.

 Methods
Study population
Participants were recruited through Penn State Health Hershey Med-
ical Center clinics and advertisements from November 2011 to
December 2013. Inclusion criteria were women, age � 18 years, and
BMI � 25
kg/m2.
Exclusion
criteria
were
current
pregnancy,
untreated hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes,
androgen secreting tumor, Cushing syndrome, prolactin > 30 ng/mL,
severe active neuropsychological disorder, psychosis or suicidal
ideation, severe untreated depression or anxiety, inpatient admission
for psychiatric disorder within the past 2 years, active alcohol or
drug abuse, inability to read, speak, or write English, inability to
commit to the intervention and follow-up, current enrollment in a
stress reduction program, mindfulness practice within the past 6
months (regular formal practice at least once a week), and current
enrollment in other studies.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Penn State College of Medicine. The trial was registered at clinical-
trials.gov (NCT01464398) prior to enrollment.
Study protocol and design
In this randomized clinical trial, women with overweight or obesity
were randomized to MBSR or health education for 8 weeks and
were followed for 16 weeks. Randomization was performed using a
random number generator. SAS 9.2 proc plan (SAS Corp., Cary,
North Carolina) was used to create a list based on a permuted-
blocks randomization scheme, having variable block sizes of 2 and
4, with equal allocation to the two arms. Randomization was strati-
fied based on the presence or absence of polycystic ovarian syn-
drome (PCOS) to allow for secondary analysis of the effect sizes of
MBSR in PCOS. We used the classic National Institutes of Health
definition of PCOS as chronic hyperandrogenic anovulation (22).
Personnel in the Department of Public Health Sciences generated
the randomization scheme and only communicated it to the Class
Schedulers.
The principal investigator, study coordinator, and all study personnel
involved in the collection and review of outcomes data were blinded
to the block size and group assignments. The Class Schedulers, par-
ticipants, and instructors were directed to keep the group assign-
ments concealed from the blinded study personnel. Details of the
design and methods for this study have been described previously
(23).
Intervention group: MBSR.
Participants randomized to MBSR
received the standard MBSR program consisting of instructor-led
weekly 2.5-hour sessions for 8 weeks and a 6-hour retreat session
(24). One adaptation to standard MBSR was that participants were
asked to do only 25 to 30 minutes of daily home practice instead of
the standard 45 minutes. We have previously reported positive clini-
cal outcomes and high adherence with 25 to 30 minutes of daily
home practice (11,20,25). There were no other changes to the stand-
ard MBSR curriculum, including no changes to the type or content
of meditation practice. The instructor who led the MBSR interven-
tion was well qualified, having completed professional MBSR train-
ing and with 9 years of experience training others in mindfulness.
During the study, the MBSR instructor received regular guidance
from a supervisor highly experienced in teaching MBSR. The
MBSR intervention lasted 8 weeks. Between 8 and 16 weeks, partic-
ipants were encouraged to continue with the daily home practice,
but there was no contact from intervention staff.
All participants in the MBSR and health education groups were
given the same written guidelines on diet and exercise, which con-
sisted of the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’
“General, Healthful Nutrition” handout and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention’s “Physical Activity and Health” webpage.
These guidelines were the only information that was the same across
both groups. The MBSR group did not receive any additional health
education other than these guidelines.
Comparator group: health education.
The health education
group was taught by a registered dietitian who delivered additional
diet and exercise information. To control for instructor attention and
group support, the health education group also received instructor-
led, weekly, 2.5-hour sessions for 8 weeks and a 6-hour retreat. Dur-
ing sessions, the health education group received lectures and par-
ticipated in learning activities about diet, exercise, general stress
management, and the diagnosis, symptoms, complications, and treat-
ments for obesity. Participants practiced exercising with cans, resist-
ance bands, balls, and chairs and created their own exercise plan.
They reviewed their own food logs and identified foods high in
sodium and fat and low in fiber, as well as foods that were good
protein choices. They created meal plans for themselves. During the
stress management session, they wrote down what caused them to
be stressed and what they did when they were stressed (e.g., ate
more, cried). This was followed by a discussion on how to relieve
stress.
General stress management was included in the health education
group to minimize the bias of subject expectations. The health edu-
cation group did not receive any mindfulness. The MBSR group
received a more extensive discussion on stress and practiced using
mindfulness to respond to stress, which is a key component of the
MBSR curriculum (24).
Because weight loss is not a part of the MBSR curriculum, all sub-
jects were informed at enrollment that the primary focus of the
study was stress reduction, not weight reduction. They were
informed that the study was being done to determine the effects of
stress reduction on glucose, blood pressure, and overall health. To
limit subject expectation bias, subjects were not told that one pro-
gram was hypothesized to be more effective than the other. They
were told that the study was being done to test two different stress
reduction
programs,
one
of
which
is
combined
with
health
education.
Outcomes
Validated questionnaires and focused physical exam and laboratory
assessments were obtained at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. The
primary outcome was the change from baseline in the validated
Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), a measure of one’s ability to be
mindful, that is, in a state of curious, decentered awareness of one’s
experiences (26). This was selected as the primary outcome to dem-
onstrate that MBSR is feasible in our population and leads to
increased mindfulness. Before completing the TMS, participants
were instructed to sit quietly for 15 minutes, paying attention to
their breathing or anything else that arose. Afterward, they rated the

 degree to which 13 items described what they experienced on a
scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).
Perceived stress was assessed with the well-validated Perceived
Stress Scale-10, a measure of the degree to which one perceives his
or her life as stressful (27). Quality of life was assessed with the
validated Short Form-36 (SF-36), which yields an eight-scale profile
of functional health and well-being scores, as well as a physical
component summary score and a mental component summary score
(28).
Participants
completed
the
validated
Brief
Symptoms
Inventory-18, which yields three symptom dimensions: somatization
(6 items), depression (6 items), and anxiety (6 items), as well as a
measure of overall psychological distress based on all 18 items,
called the Global Severity Index (29). Participants completed the
validated Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in which they rated
the extent to which they felt 20 different feelings and emotions dur-
ing the past week (30). The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
yields a positive affect measure and a negative affect measure.
Sleep-related impairment was assessed using the validated Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep-Related
Impairment version 1.0 short form (31,32).
Participants were weighed while dressed in light clothing, without
shoes. Weight was followed during the study because it is an impor-
tant metabolic outcome, but participants were informed that the pri-
mary focus of the study was stress reduction, not weight reduction.
Three separate blood pressure measurements were obtained in the
right arm in accordance with American Heart Association recom-
mendations (33).
Fasting blood samples were obtained and analyzed using validated
assays for glucose (glucose oxidase method), insulin (radioimmuno-
assay-double antibody [EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts]),
hemoglobin A1c (immunoturbidimetry, COBAS INTEGRA 800
[Roche Diagnostics USA, Indianapolis, Indiana]), lipid profile (spec-
trophotometric, Olympus 5400 [Olympus, Center Valley, Pennsylva-
nia]), and high sensitive C-reactive protein (enzyme immunoassay
[ALPCO, Salem, New Hampshire]). Salivary cortisol was deter-
mined by enzyme immunoassay (Salimetrics, State College, Penn-
sylvania) using saliva samples collected by participants three times a
day for 2 days before each visit: (1) immediately upon waking in
the morning, (2) 30 minutes later, and (3) at night just before going
to sleep (23). Assays for hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile were per-
formed at Quest Laboratories (Chantilly, Virginia). All other assays
were performed at the General Clinical Research Center and Core
Endocrine Lab at Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey, Penn-
sylvania). All assays had intra- and interassay coefficients of varia-
tion less than 15%.
Statistical analysis
It was determined that a sample size of 72 (36 per group, which
included a 15% dropout factor) would provide 90% power to detect
an absolute difference in TMS total score change from baseline to
week 8 means between the MBSR and health education groups,
assuming change from baseline TMS total score group means of 0.3
in the health education group and 7.6 in the MBSR group; a stand-
ard deviation (SD) of 8.6; and a two-sided test having a type I error
of 0.05. Additional participants were randomized in order to main-
tain reasonable class sizes while achieving recruitment targets. Con-
servative estimates of effect size and variability for sample size
estimation for TMS total score were primarily based on a study by
Gayner et al. and assumed a within-subject correlation coefficient of
0.6 (34).
Data analysis followed the principle of intent-to-treat. Linear mixed-
effects models were fit and contrasts constructed to assess changes
from baseline within the treatment groups and differences of those
changes between treatment groups with respect to continuous out-
comes over time. The independent variables were treatment group,
time of the visit, and their interaction. We also controlled for PCOS
as a covariate in the mixed-effects models. Residual diagnostics
were assessed to determine the appropriateness of the model fit,
and, if necessary, transformations of the response were used to meet
modeling assumptions.
Results
Eighty-six women with BMI � 25 kg/m2 were randomized to 8
weeks of MBSR (n 5 42) or health education (n 5 44). The two
groups were similar in age, BMI, and other baseline characteristics
(Table 1). Although it looks like the MBSR group had higher base-
line TMS scores, this difference was not significant. We followed
up on all participants regardless of how regularly they participated
in the intervention sessions. Sixty-one participants (71%) completed
the 8-week follow-up visit (MBSR 35/42 5 83.3%; health education
26/44 5 59.1%). Fifty-three participants (62%) completed the 16-
week follow-up visit (MBSR 31/42 5 73.8%; health education 22/
44 5 50.0%). At 8 weeks, the dropout rate was significantly higher
in the health education group than in the MBSR group (P 5 0.01).
The flow of participants through the study is shown in Figure 1.
There was significant improvement in the primary outcome of mind-
fulness, as demonstrated by increased TMS total score with MBSR
(19% increase from baseline) compared to health education at 8
weeks (P 5 0.03) (Table 2). There was a significant between-group
difference of 5.4 in the change in TMS total score at 8 weeks, favor-
ing the MBSR group (95% CI: 0.7-10.2). Significance was not sus-
tained at 16 weeks (Figure 2).
Perceived Stress Scale-10 score significantly decreased with MBSR
(15.8% decrease from baseline) compared to health education at 16
weeks (P 5 0.01) (Table 2; Figure 2). There was a significant
between-group difference of 22.3 in the change in Perceived Stress
Scale-10 score at 16 weeks, favoring the MBSR group (95% CI:
24.0 to 20.6). Compared to health education, MBSR significantly
reduced negative psychological affect at 8 weeks (P 5 0.03) (Table
2). There were no significant differences in depression between the
two groups. However, within the MBSR group, there was a signifi-
cant reduction in depression at 8 weeks compared to baseline
(P 5 0.01), whereas no significant differences were seen in depres-
sion within the health education group. Within both groups, anxiety
and SF-36 mental component summary significantly improved at 8
weeks compared to baseline. At 16 weeks, improvements in anxiety
and SF-36 mental component summary from baseline remained sig-
nificant only within the MBSR group and were no longer significant
within the health education group; however, the between-group dif-
ferences were not statistically significant. Within both groups, over-
all psychological distress, positive psychological effect, and sleep-
related impairment significantly improved compared to baseline.

 There were no adverse events in the MBSR or health education
group.
Within the MBSR group only, there were significant reductions in
fasting glucose at 8 weeks (P 5 0.02) and at 16 weeks (P 5 0.02)
compared to baseline (Figure 2). Fasting glucose did not signifi-
cantly improve within the health education group. However, the
between-group difference did not reach statistical significance.
Adjusting for diabetic status did not alter the glucose findings
(results not shown). There was a significant reduction in systolic
blood pressure at 8 weeks compared to baseline within the health
education group (P < 0.05), but not within the MBSR group.
However, the between-group differences in blood pressure were not
statistically significant. There were no significant changes in weight,
BMI, waist circumference, fasting insulin, homeostatic index of
insulin resistance, hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, high sensitive C-
reactive protein, or salivary cortisol in the MBSR or health educa-
tion group (Table 3; Figure 3).
Among the participants who attended at least one session, average
adherence (defined as [hours of classes taken/26 hours] 3 100) was
not significantly different between groups (73.1 6 28.5% [n 5 41] in

 from 2 to 11 in the MBSR group and 2 to 12 in the health education
group. There was no correlation between adherence or class size and
the change in TMS at 8 weeks in the MBSR group.
Discussion
In this study of women with overweight or obesity, MBSR signifi-
cantly increased mindfulness and decreased perceived stress com-
pared to health education. Additionally, fasting glucose significantly
decreased within the MBSR group at 8 weeks and at 16 weeks, but
not within the health education group. The between-group difference
did not reach statistical significance, possibly because this study was
not powered to detect a difference in glucose.
The reason for the reduced fasting glucose in the MBSR group
remains unclear. There were no changes in weight, cortisol, or insu-
lin resistance to explain the reduction in glucose. One possible
explanation is that the increased mindfulness could have made it
easier for the MBSR group to adhere to the diet and exercise
guidelines we gave them. If, as our study suggests, MBSR lowers
glucose in people with overweight or obesity, then it could be an
effective tool for preventing or treating type 2 diabetes.
Few studies have shown that mindfulness per se can improve meta-
bolic parameters. One recent study of adults with obesity reported
maintenance of fasting glucose in the mindfulness with diet-exercise
arm compared to increased fasting glucose of 2.5 mg/dL in the diet-
exercise alone arm (35). Another study in women with overweight
or obesity found no differences in fasting glucose in the mindfulness
group compared to a waitlist control group (36). The different
results could be due to differences in the type or duration of the
mindfulness intervention, whether or not the mindfulness interven-
tion included diet-exercise components, and the comparator group
used.
A potential mechanism by which MBSR may reduce glucose is
through the HPA axis (37). We did not observe any effects on sali-
vary cortisol in the present study. As cortisol is secreted in a diurnal
pattern, it may be important to evaluate effects on more integrated
measures of cortisol, such as 24-hour urine free cortisol. In addition,

 there may be changes in the HPA axis beyond cortisol levels, such
as alterations in cortisol receptor sensitivity, that may be worth
exploring further. Another potential mechanism by which MBSR
may reduce glucose is through the sympathetic nervous system. In
support of this, a previous study demonstrated that MBSR signifi-
cantly reduced catecholamine levels at 1 year; however, we did not
evaluate this in our study (38).
Although the sample size was moderate, our study was not powered
to detect a difference in glucose. It was powered to detect a differ-
ence in mindfulness in order to establish the feasibility of MBSR in
women with overweight or obesity. The present study has provided
us with a more precise estimate of effect size and variability of glu-
cose for future trials. A future randomized, clinical trial having at
least 80% statistical power would require a sample size of 122 sub-
jects per group (i.e., a total of 244 subjects) to detect a difference in
the change in fasting glucose from baseline to week 8 of 7.1 mg/dL
(SD 5 19.7 mg/dL) between MBSR and health education using a
two-sided test having a significance level of 0.05.
The only metabolic improvement noted within the health education
group was a significant 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pres-
sure at 8 weeks. The MBSR group also demonstrated a 3.2 mm Hg
reduction, so the between-group difference was not significant.
One limitation of our study is that 71% of all the participants com-
pleted the 8-week study visit and 62% of all participants completed
the 16-week study visit. Reasons for dropout included personal
issues and changes in participants’ schedules that made it difficult
for them to continue to participate in the study given the nonflexible
timing of sessions, long duration of sessions, and difficulty commut-
ing. The majority of dropouts were in the health education group,
which actually lends support to the feasibility and acceptability of
MBSR in women with overweight or obesity. Retention rates in the
MBSR group were 83.3% at the 8-week study visit and 73.8% at
the 16-week study visit, which is comparable to what has been
reported in other MBSR studies (19,20,38-40). The relatively high
attrition in the health education group is evidence that the current
standard of care is ineffective and unappealing to patients, but it

 also limits the generalizability of our findings. Due to the sample
size decreasing over time, statistically insignificant results must be
viewed with caution because of the increased probability of a type
II error; however, we have provided effect sizes and corresponding
95% CIs to quantify the strength of any differences. In future
research, better strategies for minimizing attrition and enhancing
retention in the health education group will be needed, such as more
flexible scheduling of sessions, online delivery to minimize traveling
burden for participants, more engaging learning activities instead of
lectures, and compensating participants for attending each session.
Future studies should also consider that attrition in the comparator
group may be minimized with the use of an actual control group
with no intervention instead of a health education intervention.
Another benefit of such a study design is that MBSR would be the
only difference between the two groups.
A second limitation is that we did not assess dietary intake. Future
studies should evaluate whether changes in dietary intake could
explain the improvement in glucose and other outcomes. Another
limitation is that with a behavioral intervention, it was not possible
to blind participants. Additionally, as our study population only
included women, the results may not be generalizable to men.
Finally, the duration of follow-up was relatively short, so future
studies are needed to assess long-term effects of MBSR in obesity.
Conclusion
In
conclusion,
MBSR
significantly
increased
mindfulness
and
decreased perceived stress compared to health education in women
with overweight or obesity. Fasting glucose significantly decreased
compared to baseline in the MBSR group but not in the health edu-
cation group. Future studies are needed to determine whether a sus-
tained increase in mindfulness with a longer mindfulness-based
intervention would result in even greater and more long-term
benefits.O
