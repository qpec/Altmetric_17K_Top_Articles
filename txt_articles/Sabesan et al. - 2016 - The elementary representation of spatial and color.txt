The elementary representation of spatial and
color vision in the human retina
Ramkumar Sabesan,1*†‡ Brian P. Schmidt,2† William S. Tuten,1 Austin Roorda1
The retina is the most accessible element of the central nervous system for linking behavior to the activity of isolated
neurons. We unraveled behavior at the elementary level of single input units—the visual sensation generated by stim-
ulating individual long (L), middle (M), and short (S) wavelength–sensitive cones with light. Spectrally identified cones
near the fovea of human observers were targeted with small spots of light, and the type, proportion, and repeatability
of the elicited sensations were recorded. Two distinct populations of cones were observed: a smaller group predom-
inantly associated with signaling chromatic sensations and a second, more numerous population linked to achromatic
percepts. Red and green sensations were mainly driven by L- and M-cones, respectively, although both cone types
elicited achromatic percepts. Sensations generated by cones were rarely stochastic; rather, they were consistent over
many months and were dominated by one specific perceptual category. Cones lying in the midst of a pure spectrally
opponent neighborhood, an arrangement purported to be most efficient in producing chromatic signals in downstream
neurons, were no more likely to signal chromatic percepts. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that the
nervous system encodes high-resolution achromatic information and lower-resolution color signals in separate path-
ways that emerge as early as the first synapse. The lower proportion of cones eliciting color sensations may reflect a
lack of evolutionary pressure for the chromatic system to be as fine-grained as the high-acuity achromatic system.
INTRODUCTION
A single photoreceptor is sensitive to both the intensity and the wave-
length of light falling on it and, therefore, confounds brightness and
color signals (1). Our visual system ultimately constructs a representa-
tion of the external world from the output of the photoreceptor mosaic in
which color and achromatic contrast are divorced (2, 3). How, and which,
postreceptoral neural pathways recover and segregate this multiplexed
information from individual receptors remains unresolved (4, 5). We ad-
dressed this outstanding question by recording visual sensations upon
stimulating spectrally identified cones in human subjects with light.
There are two fundamental impediments to linking visual perception
to the activity of individual retinal neurons. First, the retina is situated inside
the eyeball and thus can be neither visualized nor stimulated at cellular
resolution due to the eye’s aberrated optics. Second, even while steadily
fixating,theretinamovesoverspatialscalesfargreaterthanthesizeofasingle
cone, impeding the repeated and reliable stimulation of the same cell. Here,
we overcome these limitations using adaptive optics (6) and high-speed
retinal tracking (7–9) to record sensations arising from individual cones in
living human retina (Fig. 1A). Studies of visual perception with small spots
have previously been reported, albeit without the capacity to repeatedly
target distinct cones, and hence have relied on an ensemble analysis (10, 11).
BRIEF METHODS
Cone-targeted stimulation
Cone-sized spots (0.45 arc min; 543-nm wavelength; 25-nm band-
width) were targeted on a mosaic of spectrally identified long (L), me-
dium (M), and short (S) wavelength-sensitive cones in two male,
color-normal subjects—S10001R and S20076R. The subjects reported
the color of each flash. The stimuli appeared for 500 ms on a dim
background subjectively adjusted to appear approximately achromatic
at the start of each session. A gray background was chosen to roughly
equate the resting-state activities of L- and M-cones to minimize bi-
ases in downstream neurons. In the case of a large stimulus, chromatic
contrast from a gray background that increases only L-cone activity
produces a reddish sensation in most subjects, whereas excursions
from gray that increase only M-cone activity appear bluish green
(Fig. 1B) (12). These percepts are thought to be represented in the
visual system by spectrally opponent neurons (13). Although this sets
an expectation on the elicited perceptual categories, the extent to which
these large-field predictions will generalize to single cone–mediated
percepts remains unknown.
The spatiotemporal precision of our light delivery system has been
previously validated with a detection experiment carried out under
threshold conditions (7). A model of light capture in single cones ac-
curately predicted performance on the detection task and estimated
that more than 90% of light was coupled into the targeted cone.
The present study used a longer-duration flash [15 frames (500 ms)
versus 1 frame (120 ms)] and targeted cones at a smaller retinal eccen-
tricity (~1.5° versus ~3°), where cones are slightly smaller (14). How-
ever, the delivery error does not grow worse over the duration of the
flash because the eye-tracking algorithm continues to correct for eye
movement throughout (8). Across our subjects, targeting error, de-
fined as the spatial offset between the intended target cone and
the actual stimulus location, remained less than a quarter the size of
a cone at the studied eccentricity—0.21 and 0.16 arc min (~1.0 and
0.7 mm on the retina) for S10001 and S20076, respectively, on average.
The smaller size of cones at 1.5° affects expected light capture but
only minimally. At this location, the model estimated 82% of light
was captured by the targeted cone. On average, this predicts that, of

 the light captured by the mosaic, less than 3% was absorbed by the
neighboring six cones. Therefore, the targeted cone is expected to
catch 20 to 30 times more light than the surrounding cones.
RESULTS
Sensations from single cones are repeatable
S-cones, making up 4% of the targeted cones in our study, are much
less sensitive to the 543-nm stimulation wavelength and therefore
would be expected to have a much higher threshold in a detection
task. Despite permitting subjects to repeat stimulus presentations and
using high-contrast stimuli, the mean fraction of “not seen” trials
was far higher in the sample of S-cones (n = 12; mean fraction not
seen = 0.62; SD = 0.17) compared to L/M-cones (n = 273; mean frac-
tion not seen = 0.11; SD = 0.13) (t283 = 13.3, P < 0.001). Because of the
spatiotemporal precision of stimulation, the percepts originating from
individual cones were rarely arbitrary: Stimulation of the same cone
in different sessions, sometimes many months apart, produced re-
peatable responses (Fig. 1C). The results we report were also largely
invariant to the wavelength and chromatic contrast of the flash (figs.
S1 and S2). The reliability of percepts generated in this unnatural
experimental paradigm demonstrates the nervous system’s ability
to associate the output of an individual cone with a consistent,
though often nonveridical, color sensation.
Separate populations of cones contribute to chromatic or
achromatic percepts
A total of 273 L- and M-cones were targeted, and similar trends were
observed between subjects. Because of the close similarity, we grouped
cells across both subjects in subsequent analyses. In response to flashes
that were seen, our subjects reported achromatic sensations 61.8%
of the time. When red was reported (22.5% of seen trials), it was more
likely to be driven by L- than M-cones (t271 = 7.32, P = 3 × 10−12),
whereas green (15.7%) was more likely to come from the excitation
of M-cones (t271 = −7.45, P = 1 × 10−12). Thus, L-cones tended to sig-
nal both white and red, whereas M-cones tended to signal both white
and green. The observation that these color percepts roughly align with
the predictions of large-field cone-isolating stimuli (see above) suggests
that the same opponent neuronal circuits may be implicated in both
paradigms. This finding also supports the idea that the nervous system
can learn the spectral identity of individual cones (15, 16).
The distribution of responses elicited from the cones in both sub-
jects’ retina is plotted as a function of stimulated cone type in Fig. 2A.

 responses for each cone type. Note that seven L-cones most often eli-
cited green responses, and one M-cone was dominated by red re-
sponses. Together, these cones account for 3% of the tested
population, which is close to the error rate of our cone classification
method (approximately 3 to 5%) (17).
We sought to distinguish two possible scenarios that could have
generated the distribution of color and achromatic responses in our
data, described above. One possibility is that all cones signal achromatic
responses on a large fraction of trials but occasionally and stochas-
tically signal a hue according to the cone-specific distributions in
Fig. 2A. Alternatively, the majority of the L- and M-cones could re-
liably signal achromatic percepts with a small handful of cones purely
signaling red or green. To distinguish these two scenarios, we first as-
sessed the possibility that color names were assigned randomly by cal-
culating the “response purity” of each cell (number of responses in
max category/number of trials). The results of this analysis for all
L- and M-cones (n = 273) revealed a high mean response purity of
0.78. A Monte Carlo resampling of all of the responses revealed that
the probability of the observed distribution occurring by chance was
much less than 1 in 10,000.
Next, we found that the proportion of achromatic responses across
all L- and M-cones (Fig. 2B) exhibited a nonunimodal distribution
(Hartigan’s dip = 0.033, P = 0.035) (18). Most cones signaled white
on a majority of trials, whereas a small group was dominated by red
or green. However, this analysis does not distinguish whether the
population of cells with only a few white reports (left side of Fig. 2B)
was dominated by red, green, or a mix of red and green reports. To
quantify the strength and distribution of color-responding cells, we
defined a red-green (RG) metric (19) as g � r
T
, where r is the number
of times red was reported, g is the number of green reports, and T is
the number of trials. Upon scoring the responses of each cell accord-
ing to the RG metric, we found that cells were dominated by a single
visual sensation: red, green, or white (Fig. 2C). The color-preferring cells
in Fig. 2B were thus not a result of cones signaling both red and green
percepts with high frequency. The apparent segregation of color cat-
egories into distinct populations of cells (Figs. 2 and 3 and fig. S3) is
suggestive of a parallel representation of color and achromatic sensa-
tions. Moreover, these results imply that, for a large number of cones,
their individual activation is not sufficient to produce a color sensation.

 is shown in Fig. 3. As statistically confirmed by the response purity
analysis, repeated stimulation of a cone tended to produce a single
color report. As revealed in Fig. 2C, we did not find individual cones
signaling both red and green in high proportions. A small number of
cones produced occasional red or green reports together with the oth-
er color, but the frequency of this behavior was low. Because of the
inherent difficulty of this task and our subjects are not perfectly reli-
able (Fig. 1C), we decided not to speculate on these anomalies and
instead focused our analysis on the dominant response category eli-
cited from each cone.
We found that the cones most likely to generate strong spectral
opponency in a parvocellular neuron, that is, those surrounded by cones
of opposing type (20, 21), were not more likely to generate red or green
percepts (Fig. 4 and fig. S4). Rather, all these examples, when stimulated
in isolation, drove achromatic percepts on a majority of the trials.
DISCUSSION
The present study represents the first time cone photoreceptors of
known spectral type have been individually targeted and activated
with light in the living human retina. Despite the unusual nature of
this paradigm, the subjects could use basic color terms to reliably de-
scribe their experience of these light flashes. By additionally identifying
the spectral type of each targeted cone, we linked elementary color sen-
sations to the activation of single L- or M-cones. Below, we consider
the implications of these findings on our understanding of the neural
circuitry mediating the appearance of color.
There is little doubt that the long-duration suprathreshold stim-
ulation of individual cones here influences the firing of a number of
different ganglion cell types. In particular, a multielectrode study dem-
onstrated that the activation of a single cone simultaneously evoked
responses in both midget (parvocellular) and parasol (magnocellular)
ganglion cells (22). The latter has been posited to contribute to ach-
romatic percepts (23, 24). However, at the eccentricity studied here (1.5°
temporal retina), midgets make up more than 90% of the ganglion
cells sampling the cone mosaic (25). Moreover, the midget ganglion
cells respond best to high-contrast, low-temporal frequency stimuli. A
500-ms suprathreshold illumination of the center cone of a midget
ganglion cell receptive field, with minimal light from the spot falling
on surrounding cones, represents an ideal stimulus for these cells.
Therefore, our results may be particularly informative in differentiat-
ing proposals about the role of parvocellular neurons in achromatic
spatial and color vision.
Near the fovea, midget ganglion cells are generally considered to
have a center mechanism that receives input from only a single cone
and a surround mechanism that draws indiscriminately from neigh-
boring cones (20, 26, 27). This arrangement naturally confers L/M
spectral opponency in a majority of these cells, and therefore, they are
often assumed to have a central role in red-green color perception. The
center-surround receptive field organization of midget ganglion cells
also makes them well suited for mediating high-acuity spatial vision.
Accordingly, in addition to color vision, they have also been proposed
to have a role in our high-acuity achromatic spatial vision (4, 26, 28).
Thus, theories about the midget system range from emphasizing their
possible role in mediating color percepts to emphasizing the part they
might play in mediating achromatic ones.
Depending on the theory to which one adheres about the role of
midget ganglion cells in perception, our finding that stimulation of
single M-cones surrounded by L-cones most often produces per-
cepts of “white” (Fig. 4 and fig. S4) might seem surprising. As an
example, consider what happens when we stimulate an M-cone with
six L-cones in its immediate surround, such as those represented in
Fig. 4. Light in the center excites the ON midget ganglion cell and
inhibits the OFF midget with direct input from the cone. Conversely,
the same M-cone excites the surround of the nearby L-OFF midgets
and inhibits L-ON midget ganglion cells. Consequently, only consid-
ering the midget ganglion cells associated with a stimulated M-cone
and six L-cone neighbors, our stimulus excites, to a greater or lesser
extent, seven M-ON midget ganglion cells and inhibits seven L-ON
ganglion cells. Therefore, if midget ganglion cells participate in color
appearance, this spectrally opponent arrangement should be most ef-
ficient at eliciting chromatic percepts, but our results do not align with
this expectation (Fig. 4 and fig. S4).
Over the years, since the first recordings of parvocellular neu-
rons (29, 30), two different theoretical approaches have been taken
with respect to their role in vision and how chromatic and achromatic
percepts might be separated. First, midget ganglion cells have been
proposed to do “double duty” at the level of the retina contributing

 to both high-acuity black/white vision and red-green color vision
(28, 31, 32), with the two being separated at a higher level in the
visual pathway. The second class of theories proposes a parallel re-
presentation in which color and luminance are separated in the retina
(33, 34), with parvocellular neurons responsible for a high-resolution
achromatic representation of the visual scene and a sparser population
signaling color in parallel. In the most recent version from this latter
class of theories, the majority of parvocellular neurons are suggested
to serve achromatic percepts, whereas the sparser color-coding gan-
glion cells have been proposed to be a small subset of midget gan-
glion cells (35, 36).
It has been long recognized that, theoretically, chromatic and
achromatic signals carried by parvocellular neurons could be sep-
arated in the cortex (28). Moreover, under the double-duty class
hypotheses, it may be possible that the high spatial frequency na-
ture of single-cone stimuli could favor signaling in an achromatic
pathway (23) and thus explain the white responses reported by our
subjects. However, we also discovered substantial structure to the
spatial organization of color sensations at the level of the cone mosaic
in both subjects. Most striking was the tendency for cells that elicit a
color to cluster near each other (Fig. 3 and fig. S3). In both subjects,
we found patches of two to five cones signaling green or red sur-
rounded by larger groups of L- and M-cones predominantly signal-
ing white. It does not seem that theories, which all midget ganglion
cells do double duty, would have predicted the observed structure
in the spatial organization of sensations at the level of the cone mo-
saic and the distinct separation of cones into populations that elicit
achromatic and chromatic sensations that we observed here. In contrast,
the parallel representation theories predict that color-coded ganglion
cells are interspersed within a higher-density mosaic of achromatic
coding cells (33, 34, 36)—exactly consistent with our observations.
In general, the visual system has adapted to the limits imposed by
the spatial and spectral content of the environment. Given that the
eye’s optics blur the spatiochromatic structure of the natural environ-
ment, an individual cone is almost never stimulated in isolation (27).
Thus, there may be little evolutionary pressure for the visual system
to retrieve color information on the spatial scale of individual cones.
The red-green system samples the visual world at a lower resolution
than the achromatic system (37, 38). The results from the studies re-
ported here are consistent with the idea that the nervous system rep-
resents these two pieces of information with separate pathways that
emerge as early as the photoreceptor synapse: one chiefly concerned
with high-resolution achromatic vision and a second, lower-resolution
color system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
The University of California Berkeley Institutional Review Board
approved this research, and subjects signed an informed consent be-
fore participation. All experimental procedures adhered to the tenets
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Two highly experienced psycho-
physical subjects (S10001 and S20076) with normal color vision were
enrolled in the study. Mydriasis and cycloplegia were achieved with
1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine ophthalmic solutions before
each experimental session. Dental impressions were used to stabilize
subjects’ head position.
Cone-resolved imaging and stimulation
A scanning laser ophthalmoscope equipped with adaptive optics
(AOSLO) was used for imaging and stimulation of cones. Wavelengths
centered at 842 and 543 nm were selected from a supercontinuum
source (SuperK EXTREME, NKT Photonics) and relatively adjusted
for the chromatic vergence difference of the ocular media. Both wave-
lengths were raster-scanned to generate a 1.2° imaging field of view on
the retina. The 543-nm wavelength was chosen to minimize the differ-
ence in L- and M-cone activity. Light scattered from the retina was
similarly split into separate collection assemblies for each wavelength.
The 842-nm wavelength played two roles. First, a fraction (10%) of the
light scattered at this wavelength was used for wavefront sensing and
subsequently driving the adaptive optics correction. The rest was col-
lected in a photomultiplier tube via a confocal pinhole and rendered
into a video stream to perform real-time retinal image registration.
Retinal tracking coordinates so obtained were used to drive an acousto-
optic modulator, a high-speed (50 MHz) optical switch delivering 543-nm
visual stimuli to the retina one pixel at a time. The spatial location
of the stimuli on the retina was retrieved from the exact time stamp of
when the switch was activated and differenced with the desired loca-
tion to arrive at the error in stimulus delivery. Transverse chromatic ab-
erration, the spatial offset between the imaging (842 nm) and
stimulation (543 nm) wavelengths, was monitored and compensated
during the experiment (9). Stimuli were sized ~0.45 arc min in diam-
eter and displayed over 15 video frames (500 ms). Stimulus size was
less than half the size of a cone inner segment (14) at the retinal ec-
centricity studied (~1.5°).
Recording visual sensations from individual cones
The 842-nm wavelength produced a 1.2° square that was dimly red-
dish purple in appearance. A background leak from the stimulus
channel (543 nm) produced a slightly brighter greenish-appearing
square. To extinguish these extraneous color sensations and produce
a neutral viewing background, a digital light processing (DLP) projec-
tor illuminated the subject’s retina in Maxwellian view (Fig. 1B). At
the beginning of each session, the subject was asked to set the back-
ground to be as dim and achromatic as possible. The final chromatic-
ity of the background (imaging raster, stimulus leak, and Maxwellian
view) was measured with a color-matching technique. A second square
adjacent to the background was displayed through the DLP projector.
The subject then adjusted the second square until it matched in chro-
maticity and luminance to the adjacent background. The match was
measured with a PR-650 (Photo Research) spectroradiometer. This
yielded an estimate of the typical background, which had a luminance
of 45 cd m−2 and an x, y chromaticity of 0.23, 0.30 (CIE 1931), though
this varied slightly between sessions and subjects. The luminance of the
stimulus (3570 cd m−2) was approximately 80 times higher than the
background. The power of the stimulus channel was measured with
a radiometer (Newport Optical Power Meter 1830-C). Power measure-
ments were converted into quanta. A single (3 pixel–by–3 pixel, 15-frame)
flash delivered ~7.0-log quanta to the cornea.
On a subset of cones indicated in figs. S1 and S2, we altered the
stimulation wavelength and intensity and undertook the same measure-
ments. To determine the effect of slight intersession variability in
background luminance and chromaticity, we measured the repeatability
in visual percepts across days (figs. S2 and S4), wavelengths, and intensities.
At the beginning of each session, the experimenter marked the
cones of interest on a high-resolution retinal image. Effort was made

 to remain contiguous in cone selection and to repeat the experiment
on a handful of cones across different days. Each cone of interest in our
data set was targeted 20 times during each experimental session. Within
a session, between 6 and 10 cones were tested (120 to 200 trials), with
the presentation randomly interleaved among the cones to prevent sub-
ject bias. The subject was allowed to rest as needed. Responses were
encoded with a handheld tablet. The subject initiated each presentation,
repeating trials as needed.
A 1-s retinal video was recorded accompanying every stimulus pre-
sentation and was denoted by an audible beep. The subject then
selected from six possible choices: red, green, blue, yellow, white,
and not seen. Pilot trials indicated that these categories were sufficient
to encompass the percepts generated under our conditions. The re-
sponse was registered with another keystroke and an audible beep,
different from that for video recording. A digital mark was embedded
into the retinal video, corresponding to the time stamp of optical
switch activation. This mark was retrieved offline using image cross-
correlation and compared against the desired location to arrive at an
estimate of spatial offset errors in stimulus presentation.
Associating visual percepts with cone types
Before the color sensation psychophysics reported here, the cone types
(L, M, or S wavelength) comprised in the retina at 1.5° temporal ec-
centricity were identified using adaptive optics retinal densitometry
(17, 39). The cone identities in a ~0.5° patch—comprising 800 and 631
cones for S10001 and S20076, respectively—were obtained. The percentage
of L-cones [L/(L + M)] in subject S10001 was 66.2% L and 66.7% L in
S20076. Each cone tested psychophysically was identified with a specific
spectral type by aligning the 842-nm reflectance image and the corre-
sponding trichromatic cone mosaic map obtained from densitometry.
The alignment was guided by the pattern of blood vessels in the sub-
jects’ retina, and individual cone locations remained stable across days.
Analysis
The elicited percepts were analyzed for percentage seen, color re-
ported, neighborhood effects, and clustering of cones reporting the
same percept. Except where noted, trials reported as not seen were
excluded from analysis. Two hundred seventy-three L- and M-cones
were used in these analyses except in select cases where low-purity cones
were eliminated. The latter were defined as those cones with response
purities lower than the mean of the Monte Carlo analysis (0.61). All
analyses were carried out in Matlab (MathWorks).
For comparison of mean color responses across spectral classes, we
treated each cone as an individual sample from a population. There-
fore, we had 174 L-cone, 99 M-cone, and 12 S-cone samples. Two-tailed
t tests were used to assess whether these sample populations differed
in the mean proportion of trials that elicited a given response. S-cones
were compared to L- and M-cones together to determine whether the
mean number of not seen responses was higher for S-cones than for
L/M-cones. Similarly, we compared whether L- and M-cone distribu-
tions differed in their mean fraction of red, green, or white responses.
As described above, we assessed the repeatability of color responses
by targeting the same cone during two separate sessions (20 trials
each). The degree of repeatability was then computed as the correla-
tion coefficient (R) between the response distributions. For exam-
ple, if the first session produced a response vector of [3, 14, 0, 0, 0]
(white, red, green, blue, yellow) and the second yielded a vector of [5,
5, 5, 0, 0], the repeatability would equal 0.52. In a few cases, the same
cone was targeted three times, in which case R was computed between
all combinations of days, and the average was used as the repeatability
of that cone.
The probability that the colors reported by our subjects occurred
by chance was assessed with a bootstrapping procedure. First, the
distribution of color responses across all L- and M-cones in the data
set was computed. Color names were then randomly assigned to each
of the cones by sampling from the population-wide distribution with
replacement. After reassigning random color responses to each cone,
the response purity of each randomized cone was determined and the
mean was computed across the population. This procedure was per-
formed 10,000 times. The distribution of mean response purities from
the resampled population was then compared to the mean response
purity observed in our experimental data set. The observed value
(0.78) was substantially above all 10,000 resampled populations.
Clustering analysis was performed with a modified version of the
density recovery profile defined by Rodieck (40). First, the location of
each stimulated cone was identified, and the color response associated
with each cone was transformed into a single number reflecting the
dominant color category elicited from that cone. Cones with a purity
lower than 0.61 (the mean value obtained from bootstrap analysis de-
scribed above) were eliminated from this analysis. This threshold did
not substantially alter the results for S10001 but did cause the analysis
of red signaling cones in S20076 to lose significance. The remainder of
the analysis followed the procedure described by Roorda and col-
leagues (41). Each submosaic (red or green dominated cells) was ana-
lyzed separately. For each cone in the submosaic, its nearest neighbors
were computed and the distance to each like neighbor was used to
generate a histogram. Histogram counts were converted to density
by taking the area of each ring of distances into account. The data
represented here are considered uncorrected density because edge ar-
tifacts that occur at the edge of the measured data were not taken into
account. These artifacts artificially lower the density of long-range
distances, because these will often include unmeasured areas of mo-
saic. To partially mitigate this effect, the longest distance analyzed was
5 arc min. Bootstrapping was used to assess significance. One thou-
sand bootstrapped mosaics were created by randomly reassigning the
dominant color category of each cone according to the distribution of
dominant color responses observed in the data. A given ring of dis-
tances was considered statistically different from random if it ex-
ceeded 2 SDs, in either direction, from the mean of the bootstrap
analysis (P < 0.05).
All regression analyses were carried out as described in the text using
the “regstats” and “corrcoef” functions in Matlab. Two-sample t tests
carried out on color-naming data used the “ttest2” function. Nearest
neighbors were found with the “knnsearch” function. Bimodality was
assessed with Hartigan’s dip test (18), using an implementation of the
algorithm downloaded from http://ringachlab.net/lab/Data.html. A
P value was computed for the dip test using 10,000 bootstraps.
