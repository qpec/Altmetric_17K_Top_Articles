Abstract
As healthcare costs continue to rise, there has been great interest in understanding and defining the value of current
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer. Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a clinically beneficial
alternative to conventional therapies for a variety of malignancies. Characterized by broad clinical activity, durable
response rates, distinct side effects, and unique response kinetics, immune-based agents are vastly different compared
with traditional cytotoxic or targeted therapies. To date, however, value assessments in oncology have not focused on
the unique aspects of cancer immunotherapy, which has resulted in a lack of understanding of the true value of these
therapies. Therefore, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened key stakeholders to address the critical
issues that define the value of cancer immunotherapy in National Harbor, Maryland on November 13, 2016. Organized in
collaboration with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and with over 1500 registrants, this Value of Cancer
Immunotherapy Summit united research scientists, academic physicians, industry professionals, health economists,
third-party payers, and patients to discuss critical issues surrounding the value framework for cancer immunotherapy.
This half-day summit addressed the current landscape of cancer therapy value models, economic outcomes, the
current status of predictive biomarkers, as well as presentations from third-party payers, industry representatives,
patient outcome experts, and patient advocacy groups to gain their perspectives on the value of cancer
immunotherapy. Here, we summarize the presentations and the dominant themes from this symposium, with the
intention of providing insight on future directions and to develop recommendations to better define the value of
cancer immunotherapy for patients with cancer.
Keywords: Cancer immunotherapy, Value, Cost, Summit, Biomarkers, Patient-reported outcomes
Introduction
According to projections from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS), National Healthcare Ex-
penditures (NHE) are expected to grow at a rate of 5.8%
annually, accounting for 19.6% of the national gross do-
mestic product by 2024 [1]. Although it currently repre-
sents a fraction of the overall healthcare expenditures,
the cost of cancer care is one of the fastest growing areas
of healthcare-related spending in the U.S. Globally, in
2015 the costs of oncology therapeutics and supportive
care increased 11.5% from 2010 to $107 billion [2]. Pro-
jections that incorporate trends in incidence, survival,
oncology practice patterns, and cost of cancer therapeu-
tics estimate that the total cost of cancer care in the U.S.
will rise to $173 billion in 2020 [3]. Although this rise in
cost is due to several factors, including an increase in
the demand for oncology care by an aging population,
cancer has been historically rated as one of the mostly
costly medical conditions to treat in adults, second only
to heart conditions [4]. Combined with lost income due
to disease symptoms and the debilitating side effects
from treatment, the financial burden that patients with
cancer face can severely reduce their quality of life and

 may affect their decisions to continue therapy. In recent
years, the dramatic rise in the cost of treating cancer has
been a subject of intense discussion and debate among
members of the oncology healthcare community. There
has, therefore, been a nationwide push to evaluate thera-
peutic strategies based on their overall value, which takes
into account measures beyond financial costs, including
expected clinical outcomes, potential side effects, and
impact on patients’ quality of life. In addition, other
stakeholders may include academic institutions, which
value actionable research as part of their core mission,
and investors/shareholders may value healthcare progress
and/or cost savings.
In the last decade, cancer immunotherapies have pro-
foundly changed the therapeutic landscape for cancer
patients by providing a clinically beneficial alternative to
conventional treatments. Recent U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approvals and the rapid expansion
of indications for existing agents have made immuno-
therapies accessible to patients with a variety of malig-
nancies, including melanoma, hematologic malignancies,
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prostate cancer,
kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and head and neck cancer
[5]. With additional FDA approvals of new therapeutics
on the horizon and drug combination approaches as well
as adjuvant/neoadjuvant strategies in clinical trials, cancer
immunotherapies are expected to significantly impact the
current standard of care in the coming years. Because
these agents are based on the ability of the immune sys-
tem to recognize and eliminate cancer, immunotherapies
have been associated with broad clinical activity, durable
responses, clinically challenging but manageable side ef-
fects, and response kinetics that are unique compared
with conventional cytotoxic and targeted therapies. How-
ever, previous reports and value frameworks centered on
the value of cancer care have not taken the unique aspects
of cancer immunotherapies into consideration, which has
led to uncertainty about the true value of this therapeutic
modality.
In order to initiate this dialogue and address the crit-
ical issues involved in the discussion on the value of
immune-based agents, SITC convened a Value of Cancer
Immunotherapy Summit on the final day of the SITC
31st Anniversary Annual Meeting in Bethesda, Maryland
on November 13, 2016. Organized in collaboration with
ASCO, the summit included speakers representing a
wide range of expertise in tumor immunology, academic
medicine, health economics, payer community, pharma-
ceutical industry, patient outcomes, and patient advo-
cacy. The program concluded with an extended open
panel discussion as well as a question and answer session
with audience participation in order to further define key
issues specific to immunotherapy and drive priorities as
well as recommendations to better define the value of
cancer immunotherapy. This meeting report highlights
key aspects of each presentation and covers the main
topics discussed during this half-day program, with the
intention to provide a synopsis of the meeting and to
inform on future directions for this initiative.

Session I: Current landscape of cancer therapy value
models, economic outcomes, and the patient perspective
Evaluation of current value models
In the opening presentation of the Summit, Dr. Peter P.
Yu introduced key concepts in the value discussion and
presented a detailed evaluation of current frameworks to
assess the value of cancer treatment. Dr. Yu began his
presentation with an overview of the concept of value in
healthcare, which can be defined as the incremental im-
provement in net health outcomes divided by total finan-
cial costs. In this equation of therapeutic value, net health
outcomes are assessed based on their ability to optimize
patient health, which requires assessing both gains in
health due to disease control and reductions in health due
to toxicities of therapy. Consequently, more recent initia-
tives to measure health outcomes have included the bene-
fits of palliation of disease related symptoms as well as
short and long term side effects that negatively impact pa-
tient health. For example, the International Consortium for
Health Outcomes Measurements (ICHOM) has recently
developed standardized outcomes measures for colon and
prostate cancer, which include traditional measures such as
disease free and overall survival and additional measures,
such as quality of life, side effects or complications of treat-
ment, and patient-reported metrics of health [6].
Dr. Yu then presented considerations for defining the
financial cost of cancer therapeutics. Although there is
agreement among the healthcare community that the
rising cost of cancer care is not sustainable, the conver-
sation is less consistent on what is meant by cost of care.
The financial costs associated with drugs are defined dif-
ferently depending upon the perspective of the end-user.
The CMS structures its payment models based on the
average sales price (ASP), which is based on the transac-
tion cost between the drug manufacturer and the drug
distributor. Healthcare systems and providers define
costs by what is paid to the drug distributor and patients
define costs based on their copays, co-insurance, and de-
ductible obligation. Employers define costs in terms of
the cost of providing employee insurance benefits, and
pharmaceutical companies consider their research and
development costs to bring drugs to the market. Thus,
each of these perspectives must be considered and will
impact the assessment of overall financial costs when
determining value.
Following the introduction of the key concepts in the
discussion on value, Dr. Yu described the current value

 frameworks that have been developed to assess cancer
treatments, including ASCO’s Value Framework, the
European Society of Medical Oncology’s Magnitude of
Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS), the National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Evidence Blocks, the
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)’s
Drug Abacus, and the Institute for Clinical and Economic
Review (ICER) Value Assessment Framework. In present-
ing an overview of each model, Dr. Yu highlighted the
overall objectives, unique aspects, and intended audiences
of each (Table 1). As a final example, the World Health
Organization (WHO) Essential Medications List, a list of
drugs every country should provide for their citizens, was
presented. The update to the previous Essential Medica-
tion List defined a new value framework to assess value.
This, in turn, allowed the inclusion of non-generic drugs
for the first time if the cancer indication was a disease
with high prevalence in the population and the benefit
was cure or near cure. Dr. Yu concluded by stating that
overall none of the current value models are perfect or
necessarily easy to use. However, these models serve as
a starting point to engage discussion and may be used
to support, or develop a new value framework for
immunotherapy.
Cancer immunotherapy perspective on current value
models
Continuing the discussion on how well current value
frameworks capture the unique aspects of cancer immuno-
therapies, Dr. Michael B. Atkins provided an overview of
the biological principles and clinical characteristics that
make immunotherapeutics unique compared with con-
vention chemotherapy and tumor-targeted therapies.
Because immune-based agents activate a pluripotent
immune system rather than inhibiting individual path-
ways within cancer cells, cancer immunotherapies me-
diate anti-tumor activity indirectly. The most important
difference between conventional tumor cell directed
therapy and immunotherapy is the potential for the im-
mune system, when optimally activated, to eradicate all
tumor cells. This effect is associated with durable re-
sponses in selected patients that are sustained off treat-
ment, leading to apparent cure of some patients with
metastatic disease. This phenomenon was initially re-
ported when durable responses were observed in early
studies using high-dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) to treat
patients with melanoma and kidney cancer [7, 8]. The
hallmark of immunotherapy demonstrated by these
early studies is the long-term benefit experienced by a
proportion of patients, and this can be mathematically
represented by the flattening of the tail end of the
Kaplan-Meier survival curve as demonstrated in long-
term follow-up of patients treated with HD IL-2. In re-
cent years, the proportion of melanoma patients experi-
encing durable responses has increased from 5–10%
with HD IL-2 to 20–22% with ipilimumab treatment,
35–40% with anti-PD-1 agents, and has the potential to
rise to upwards of 50% with the combination or ipili-
mumab and nivolumab [9]. Further advances using
combinatorial immunotherapy approaches as well as
developments in biomarkers to select patients for treat-
ment have the potential to greatly increase the propor-
tion of patients experiencing durable responses from
these agents. For example, reports using ipilimumab
and nivolumab in NSCLC have already shown efficacy
as high as 92% in PD-L1 positive populations [10].
Given the potential of long-term survival following
treatment with immunotherapy, Dr. Atkins illustrated

 that the current value models are overestimating the
costs of these agents and not accurately representing
their overall value. In particular, the current value frame-
works fail to measure the characteristic treatment-free
tail end of survival curves, and therefore, the potential
for achieving long-term survival associated with im-
munotherapy treatment. Dr. Atkins emphasized that the
costs of immunotherapies should be most accurately
amortized over the longer horizon of benefit in a “cure-
rate” model. Current value models may also overestimate
the toxicities of immunotherapy. Although immunothera-
peutic approaches can have high rates of drug-related ad-
verse events (AEs), these side effects are often manageable
and can be resolved quickly if recognized early and man-
aged appropriately. Even in the context of combination
approaches, previous studies have shown that 80% of AEs
resolve in 4 to 6 weeks with immune-modulating inter-
ventions, such as corticosteroid administration, and that
very few treatment-related deaths have been reported
[9, 11]. Importantly, the management of these side effects
doesn’t appear to interfere with therapeutic activity. An-
other important distinction is the extended treatment-free
survival that patients can experience with cancer im-
munotherapy, which reduces the cost, inconvenience and
overall toxicity of therapy, relative to non-curative ap-
proaches, and most importantly allows patients to return
to their normal lives. This includes returning to product-
ive work, contributing to their family’s well-being and
their community, and having the opportunity to travel and
be present for important life milestones. The positive ef-
fects of immunotherapy on a patient’s quality of life, as
well as that of their family and communities, have not
been captured by existing value frameworks. In addition,
the current value models underestimate the benefits of
immunotherapy for society, with the annual benefit of cur-
ing just 1% more patients with cancer estimated at $500
billion [12]. The models also do not consider the potential
reduction in additional treatment for patients who re-
spond to immunotherapy and will not require other forms
of subsequent therapy. The cure-rate model also has its
limitations since this favors short-term, high expenditures
based on an anticipated savings in the future. This may
further potentiate inherent challenges with respect to sus-
tainability in the current healthcare fiscal environment.
Economic models can be developed that adjust the pricing
or cost of therapy to account for the fact that the benefits
are accrued over time and not necessarily immediately.
Dr. Atkins also presented a variety of ways in in which
the costs of immunotherapies could be reduced. Because
many clinical trials empirically treated patients for a pro-
longed time (e.g., 1–2 years) and the kinetics of radio-
logic response to immunotherapy may lag well beyond
actual tumor response, patients may be treated longer
than
necessary
with
current
immunotherapies.
To
illustrate his point, Dr. Atkins stated that his group has
been successful in stopping treatment without relapse even
in patients with residual abnormalities on CT scans, sug-
gesting that many of the residual abnormalities do not rep-
resent viable tumor. In addition, Dr. Atkins pointed out
that immunotherapy combinations may actually be less ex-
pensive than single agents if they work faster, and therefore,
require less total drug to be administered. Other ways to
cut costs include avoiding combination approaches that
focus on enhancing the benefit of non-curative treatment
approaches rather than the immune effect, and therefore,
don’t allow for cessation of treatment. In addition, bio-
markers should be used to help guide the optimal immuno-
therapy combination for a particular patient. He predicted
that because of the broad activity and high success rate of
checkpoint inhibitor trials, the average cost of bringing a
drug to market will decrease and the number of drugs
available will increase resulting in more market competi-
tion. These effects are anticipated to help lower treatment
costs. Overall, Dr. Atkins summarized that the current
value models overestimate the costs of cancer immunother-
apy treatment, overestimate the impact of acute but revers-
ible toxicities, and underestimate the benefits of long-term
as well as treatment-free survival, leading to a significant
underestimation of the value of these therapies.
Economic outcomes of cancer therapy and the ISPOR
initiative on U.S. value assessment frameworks
Dr. Lou Garrison offered insights from an economic per-
spective, including an overview of the definition of value,
emerging value frameworks, and details concerning the
International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Out-
comes Research (ISPOR) Initiative on U.S. Value Assess-
ment Frameworks. From an economic perspective, value
can be defined by what someone is willing to pay for or
forgo to obtain something, which is variable across indi-
viduals as well as over time. Thus, it is difficult to meas-
ure in healthcare, where decisions are made behind the
veil of insurance, even though cancer may be generally
accepted as a potentially fatal disease requiring higher
costs to attain quality outcomes. In defining the economic
value for a particular treatment, the key drivers typically
considered are: (a) health gain in terms of mortality reduc-
tions (i.e., resulting in life years gained), (b) any cost off-
sets (to drug price) due to reductions in the use of other
health care, (c) improvements in morbidity and quality of
life, and (d) the price of intervention. Dr. Garrison
highlighted that in order to determine improvements in
quality of life, patient engagement is critical to identify the
important attributes of a specific disease. Within value
frameworks for healthcare, Dr. Garrison also emphasized
that concepts such as “value” and “total costs” can be diffi-
cult to measure. For example, the marginal costs of mak-
ing pharmaceutical agents is very low; however, the oft
Kaufman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:38 
Page 4 of 10
 perceived “high” price paid to manufacturers also must re-
flect the reward for innovation to cover the cost associated
with bringing drugs to the market. With regard to the
unique aspects of immunotherapy, the core measures of
economic value can be broadened to incorporate additional
measures, including reduction in uncertainty about thera-
peutic benefit, improvements in population-level adherence
and uptake, innovation that leads to other scientific ad-
vances, extended survival that creates options for future
advances, and the value of hope in the potential for a cure.
These issues have not been addressed for either cancer treat-
ments in general or specifically for cancer immunotherapy.
Dr. Garrison also described some of the current value
frameworks for oncology drugs in the U.S., pointing out
that these models should be viewed as complementary to
one another. These frameworks tend to focus on “shared
decision-making” between the clinician and their patients.
Although each of these frameworks has strengths and limi-
tations based on its objectives, Dr. Garrison argued that the
emergence of a variety of different frameworks has caused
variability in the evaluation of therapies and uncertainty
within the field. Therefore, the ISPOR Initiative on Value
Assessment Frameworks was developed to promote the
development and use of high-quality, unbiased value assess-
ment frameworks. To do so, an expert Steering Committee
was convened to identify and discuss the key methodo-
logical and process-related issues in defining and applying
value frameworks. Based on this discussion, a special Task
Force was assembled to engage key stakeholders to produce
a policy white paper to review current value approaches,
with the intention to provide guidance on the appropriate
definition and use of high-quality value frameworks. The
overall goal of this white paper, which is expected to be
released in May of 2017, is to enable more efficient health
sector decision-making in the U.S. Dr. Garrison concluded
his presentation by describing the challenges and next steps
to assessing value models, which includes identifying what
and how to measure elements of value as well as determin-
ing decision-making rules to apply these measures.
Patient perspectives: tales from the tail end of the survival curve
Providing a more personal perspective in his presentation,
Mr. Silverstein illustrated the importance of incorporating
patient perspectives when defining and prioritizing mea-
sures of value. As chairman of the board for the Melan-
oma Research Foundation and a melanoma survivor after
receiving immunotherapy with HD IL-2 13 years ago, Mr.
Silverstein provided a unique view of the value of im-
munotherapy through his experience as a patient. In his
presentation, Mr. Silverstein considered the overall cost of
multiple courses of treatment, including surgery, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy combined with the ongoing
distress and uncertainty for the patients receiving these
treatments as well as their families. Although the financial
costs of HD IL-2 were high with multiple hospitalizations,
no further therapy was needed after completing treatment.
Emphasizing the potential societal impact of surviving
cancer, Mr. Silverstein also described his feelings of grate-
fulness and desire to give back to the oncology research
community. Through his roles on the board of trustees at
local hospitals, chairman of the board of the Melanoma
Research Foundation, and as a patient advocate on panels
to review funding initiatives, Mr. Silverstein has worked to
promote and lobby for increased funding for cancer re-
search. With the increasing number of patients who are
receiving and responding to immunotherapy, Mr. Silver-
stein challenged the audience to try to measure the value
of the potential societal impact of these survivors. Since
his initial diagnosis of stage IV melanoma, treatment with
HD IL-2 has allowed Mr. Silverstein to travel with his
wife, watch his daughters go through college and graduate
school, and is now looking forward to celebrating their
upcoming weddings. As an individual patient, he consid-
ered his immunotherapy treatment to be valuable, and
concluding his presentation, Mr. Silverstein noted that he
would “call that a really, really good value.”
Patient outcomes perspective: patient-reported outcomes
and personal cost of cancer
Drs. Adam P. Dicker and Heather S. Jim jointly presented
their perspective on the importance of incorporating
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical trials as well
as their ability to enhance current value models. PROs, or
the status of a patients’ health reported directly from the
patient, can be used to illustrate the clinical benefit, such as
changes in disease-related symptoms. For example, in the
Checkmate-025 trial, a phase III study of nivolumab versus
everolimus in previously treated patients with advanced or
metastatic renal cell carcinoma, investigators included a
PRO measure of kidney cancer-specific symptomatology. In
patients taking nivolumab, symptom improvement was
shown at 4 weeks that continued through 2 years of follow-
up, illustrating that nivolumab may improve the quality of
survival, in addition to the time-based overall survival bene-
fit reported [13]. In value models, PROs are very important
to evaluate toxicities and can help model the costs associ-
ated with managing them [14]. Standard measurements of
AEs used in clinical trials have been shown to inaccurately
capture toxicities, with reporting sensitivities at less than
50% for some AEs [15, 16].
PROs can also help improve system management, which
can result in improved outcomes in cancer patients. In par-
ticular, a recent report illustrated that clinic-based monitor-
ing of 12 common symptoms using the PRO-Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)
improved quality of life, reduced emergency room visits, in-
creased the median number of months on chemotherapy,
and increased quality-adjusted 1 year survival rates among
Kaufman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:38 
Page 5 of 10
 cancer patients [17]. Interestingly, there were also more
pronounced benefits for computer-inexperienced patients
who used electronic software to report symptoms, suggest-
ing a role for PROs to address heath disparities [17].
Recent technological advances in collecting PROs were
also presented to address deficiencies of current measures,
including failure to report AEs during gaps in treatment
visits and the overall underreporting of symptoms. Smart
phone-based applications have been developed to provide
real-time monitoring of PROs. In addition, personal tech-
nology monitors can now also be utilized to captures mea-
sures such as sleep, activity level, and basic vital signs.
This enhanced PRO monitoring can be used to improve
monitoring to more accurately capture clinical benefit as
well as the management of treatment side effects, which
can in turn enhance shared decision making, affect regula-
tory approval of drugs, and could be used to help deter-
mine the value of different therapeutics [18]. Dr. Dicker
concluded with a call to action, outlining the need to
develop common PRO measures, particularly in immuno-
therapy clinical trials, and to subsequently incorporate
these measures into routine clinical care.
Session I panel discussion
The first session of the symposium concluded with a
panel discussion with audience questions moderated by
Dr. Howard L. Kaufman. Highlights of this discussion
included whether improvements in current frameworks
would be sufficient to address the weaknesses identified in
current value models. Overall, it was determined that
current models need to incorporate further measures to
make them more applicable to modern immunotherapy
regimens. Among the suggestions discussed, increasing the
role of the patient and PROs in determining value and an
improved effort to collect post-marketing outcome data,
were considered important. The rapid progress in tumor
immunotherapy will require integration of such emerging
data as it becomes available to fully define the value of
immunotherapy agents and combination regimens. In
addition, the importance of engaging patient advocacy orga-
nizations in the discussion of value was emphasized, to also
bring the disease-specific issues for different cancers to the
value framework discussion. The participants also acknowl-
edged that additional issues, such as financial toxicity for
patients required to make increased co-payments and the
potential for conflicts of interest between industry funded
patient assistance programs and not-for-profit patient advo-
cacy foundations, may also require additional discussion.
Session II: Other perspectives on the value of cancer
immunotherapy
Payer perspective
Opening the second session, Dr. William McGivney
provided payer perspectives based on his experiences as
a Vice-President for Coverage at a major national payer,
his membership on the Medicare Coverage Advisory
Committee (MCAC), and working as a consultant in
the biopharma industry. He began his presentation with
insights on how value is viewed from the payer perspec-
tive and by providing an overview of what it’s like to be
a payer in the current healthcare climate. In his intro-
duction, Dr. McGivney presented the concerns of insur-
ance providers with expensive specialty pharmaceuticals
in
oncology,
including
immunotherapy
agents,
and
highlighted the fears around the potential of combination
approaches utilizing multiple costly agents. Essential to
the discussion on value is also an understanding of the
complexity of the contemporary healthcare environment,
which consists of multiple organizations driving clinical
decision-making as well as value metrics and multiple
payment methodologies that insurance companies must
take into consideration in a changing health care delivery
system. Within this complicated environment, some in-
surers would like to be more of a service company that
sells, for example, utilization management services like
precertification, formulary management, etc. to large em-
ployer customers. Increasingly and ironically, insurance
companies (i.e., payers) are seeking to offload risk via new
payment methods for providers and outcome-based risk
sharing arrangements with biopharma companies. Insur-
ance companies must also ensure that they remain com-
petitive and “cutting edge” in regard to the plans that they
sell to employers in the marketplace.
Historically, insurers have been apprehensive about
having strict utilization management practices for oncol-
ogy drugs/biologics (e.g., precertification, step therapy,
formulary exclusion, etc.). However, with the development
of an increasing number of agents, payers are exerting
more scrutiny and inserting themselves into coverage pol-
icy decision-making to actively manage oncology thera-
peutics. In particular, as multiple agents with the same or
similar mechanisms of action are approved within the
same indication (e.g., multiple agents inhibiting the PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway), payers will have more leverage to initiate
preferred agent status and to look for opportunities for
discount arrangements with pharmaceutical companies.
Overall, payers are somewhat interested in risk-sharing
and subsequent risk-based contracts, but there is uncer-
tainty as to how to implement these agreements in such a
complex, ever-changing environment.
Dr. McGivney also provided insight about the deficien-
cies of the current value frameworks, again highlighting
the need for increased patient involvement in the devel-
opment of these models. In particular, he also warned
about the deficiencies of ICER model based upon its
derivation from and use within the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the U.K., as it
has been associated with poorer outcomes and lower
Kaufman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:38 
Page 6 of 10
 overall survival rates across multiple tumor types for the
U.K. compared to other developed Western European
countries [19]. It is possible that the lower survival in
the U.K. may be explained by a diagnostic time bias in
the most common cancers, while the U.K. could be con-
sidered more efficient with better heath indicators at the
population level resulting in lower overall health expend-
iture when compared to the U.S. Moreover, the report is-
sued by ICER on drug value in NSCLC was recently called
into question based on its ability to interpret clinical evi-
dence and reach conclusions based on measures that are
scientifically rigorous, comprehensive in scope, and un-
biased in nature [20].
In the final portion of his presentation, Dr. McGivney
presented the current landscape and potential direction
of alternative payment models. The overall objective of
CMS is to move away from a fee-for-service approach
toward the Medicare Incentive Payment System (MIPS)
that will provide bonuses or penalties (2019) based upon
provider performance. The more financially risky CMS
bundled payment program is also being implemented. In
this program, providers may assume more downside risk
in anticipation that through tight management their prac-
tices can reap increased payments based upon the differ-
ence between practice treatment costs and the assigned
bundled payment. However, to change the healthcare sys-
tem from a fee-for-service model while still ensuring that
there is adequate coverage of services, appropriate com-
pensation for clinicians, and access for patients is a very
difficult task. Dr. McGivney concluded his presentation by
highlighting the complexity of developing coverage
policies that have the potential to affect such diverse
populations of stakeholders. In addition, Dr. McGivney
challenged policy makers and stakeholders to consider
how decisions based upon the policies and processes
implemented may affect individual patients and their
families. Importantly, he suggested that payers should
have more empathy by considering the possibility that
their decisions directly impact access to care for pa-
tients and may affect patient’s family and friends as well
as payer’s loved ones. As such, these decisions must be
directed at meeting the needs of the patient whose
treatment recommendations are being considered.
Industry perspective
Dr. Jon M. Wigginton presented broad perspectives
from industry on the value of cancer immunotherapy. In
the introduction of his presentation, Dr. Wigginton pro-
vided a brief history of the cancer immunotherapy field,
spanning the initial findings using Coley’s toxin to the
modern day success of T cell checkpoint inhibitors to
the promise of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
therapies. Although historically these agents have been
thought of as toxic, complex, and having limited clinical
activity, the recent progress in the field has resulted in
an era where cancer immunotherapy now needs a distinct
value proposition [21–23]. Dr. Wigginton suggested that
the findings in the randomized study of ipilimumab in pa-
tients with metastatic melanoma published in 2010 was a
turning point in the cancer immunotherapy field [22]. As
the first study using an immunotherapy agent to show sig-
nificant prolongation of overall survival, this study also
demonstrated that a short course of immunotherapy and
a relatively low rate of objective response could translate
into meaningful clinical benefit. Moreover, this study also
illustrated the unique patterns of clinical response and the
unique aspects of immune-related adverse events [24].
Further reports using immune checkpoint inhibitors tar-
geting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway underscored the signifi-
cance of these findings and illustrated additional data to
support the durable, immune-mediated patterns of re-
sponse with T cell checkpoint blockade [25–27]. Based on
these foundational studies, checkpoint inhibitors now
have indications in a variety of disease settings and are
likely to become the backbone for future combinatorial
approaches. In highlighting the unique aspects of im-
munotherapy, Dr. Wigginton emphasized the need to
consider the value of the tail end of the Kaplan Meier sur-
vival curve that is characteristic of immunotherapy.
A variety of issues from an industry perspective were
also introduced that pertain to the discussion on value.
Some of the questions/challenges posed by Dr. Wigginton
included how to effectively capture the unique aspects of
clinical benefit, how to address the unique challenges in
developing immunotherapy agents, how to effectively cap-
ture the patient experiences outside of conventional evalu-
ation criteria, and how to reconcile the cost of innovation
vs. value in the context of agents with broad potential use.
In order to address these challenges, Dr. Wigginton em-
phasized the need for a patient-centric model to
maximize patient value. In addition, within this model
the cost of innovation must also be sustained and com-
plexities in the reimbursement structure should be consid-
ered. Current value frameworks are limited in several
areas, including the lack of collaboration in their develop-
ment, lack of applicability to immune-based agents, lack
of long-term quality of life measures, focus on drug costs
vs. the total cost of care, and a disconnect between phar-
macy drug budgets and resources within healthcare sys-
tems. Dr. Wigginton concluded his presentation with an
overview of the promise as well as challenges for devel-
oping biomarkers to predict and monitor response to
immunotherapy agents. In order to overcome the
challenges associated with biomarker development, he
proposed
the
idea
of
generating
a
broad-based,
“Manhattan-project” style research collaboration across
the immuno-oncology field to identify potential bio-
markers for cancer immunotherapy.

 Predictive and companion biomarkers
In the final presentation of the summit, Dr. Roy S. Herbst
presented perspectives of predictive and companion bio-
markers based on the recent developments in lung cancer.
Dr. Herbst began his presentation with a 10-years history
of the progress in the treatment of lung cancer, beginning
with the development of targeted therapies and ending
with the recent breakthroughs that resulted in first-line
approval of pembrolizumab for NSCLC. The experience
in lung cancer with precision medicine and the use of tar-
geted therapy nicely illustrates the need to look both
within and beyond tumors for predictive biomarkers. As a
result of such biomarker-driven trials as the Lung-Map
study, large numbers of patients are being screened to
identify molecular markers to better optimize therapy.
Currently, these large biomarker-driven trials are focused
on therapies targeted to specific-driver mutations within
tumors, while the patients who test negative for these mu-
tations go on to receive immunotherapy. However, in the
near future, this study design could be utilized to include
immune-based biomarkers to test novel immunotherapy
combinations.
Presenting results from the first early phase trial of
nivolumab, Dr. Herbst concluded that immunotherapy is
having a significant impact on patients with lung cancer.
Dr. Herbst highlighted the recent breakthroughs in
NSCLC that have led to the approval of nivolumab,
pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab in the second-line
setting as well as the recent approval of pembrolizumab
frontline for patients with advanced NSCLC [28–31].
The seminal Keynote-024 study demonstrated significant
progression-free and overall survival benefits for patients
with advanced NSCLC after frontline treatment with
pembrolizumab compared with platinum chemotherapy.
Importantly, this study was also performed in a prese-
lected population of patients whose tumors had a PD-L1
tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 50% [30]. This biomarker
cutoff proved to be very important, as the CheckMate-026
study with a lower PD-L1 TPS cutoff at ≥ 5% failed to
show improvements in survival for nivolumab in the first-
line setting [32]. Recent data presented from combination
approaches has also illustrated that PD-L1 has utility as a
biomarker. In combination approaches using chemother-
apy plus pembrolizumab, there were reasonable response
rates even in the PD-L1 negative population, suggesting a
potential role for chemotherapy to help drive an immune
response. Moreover, PD-L1 high patients (TPS ≥ 50%)
have response rates over 90% following treatment with
frontline ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment [10]. Al-
though PD-L1 has proved to be a useful biomarker in cer-
tain settings, Dr. Herbst also described the limitations of
this marker by presenting the potential variation in PD-L1
expression throughout a single tumor sample and the
challenges of having several different assays, which has
highlighted by the effort of the Blueprint Proposal to com-
pare the three currently approved biomarker assays for
PD-L1 expression [33].
Shifting the focus to the future of biomarkers as pre-
dictors and determinants of response to immunotherapy,
Dr. Herbst presented work to illustrate the predictive
value of measuring tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs),
mutational burden, and gene expression analysis signa-
tures from his Lung Cancer SPORE Team at Yale Univer-
sity. In ongoing studies, markers to detect the presences
of TILs with PD-L1 expression are being explored to help
guide therapy for patients whose tumors are immunocom-
petent and to determine ways to illicit immune responses
in tumors that do not currently show evidence of immune
activation [34]. Another area of increasing interest is
measuring mutational burden as a predictive marker,
which was based on findings that illustrated a correlation
between mutation burden and response to checkpoint
inhibition [35]. In addition to mutational burden, gene
expression analysis can be used to identify patients with
“inflamed” tumors using specific immune-based signa-
tures [36]. Concluding his presentation, Dr. Herbst em-
phasized that combination approaches will be key to
the future of immunotherapy, and it will be important
to look at a variety of different markers to better guide
combination approaches as well as to identify mecha-
nisms of resistance to guide patient treatment selection.
Overall, identifying reliable biomarkers will improve ef-
ficacy, decrease toxicity, and therefore optimize the cost
and value of these agents.
Session II panel discussion
Moderated by Dr. Atkins, the final extended panel discus-
sion included additional panelists from a variety of
pharmaceutical companies, including Kirsten Axelsen, MS
(Pfizer), Daniel S. Chen, MD, PhD (Genentech), Ravinder
Dhawan, PhD (Merck & Co), and Gregory Keenan, MD
(AstraZeneca). In the opening of the panel session, the
issue of when to stop immunotherapy and ongoing initia-
tives to address this issue were discussed. Several panelists
confirmed that clinical trials were ongoing to investigate
the timing and duration of treatment; however, due to the
varying response patterns seen in previous studies, the
necessary treatment duration for immunotherapy is still
unclear at this point. It was also emphasized that post-
marketing data is needed to better inform patients and
their physicians who are fearful of stopping therapy, as
extended treatment not only adds to the cost of therapy
but may also contribute to delayed toxicities. Further
discussion focused on the current state of biomarkers
for both single-agent as well as combination approaches.
The panelists confirmed that there is an enormous effort
underway to identify novel biomarkers and to build on the
current PD-L1 assays. It was agreed that biomarkers will
Kaufman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:38 
Page 8 of 10
 likely play a large role in the value of cancer immunother-
apy. The panel considered that if a validated biomarker
was available, it would be used to direct treatment selec-
tion for particular patients, monitor responses during and
after treatment, and help in determining mechanisms of
resistance that could inform decisions about subsequent
treatments as well as the development of optimal com-
bination treatment approaches. Other issues discussed
included the need for large collaborative projects to
identify biomarkers on a larger scale and whether com-
bination approaches should be used upfront to help
combat subsequent emergence of treatment resistance.
As a final conclusion to the summit, the panelists shared
their thoughts on how to ensure patient access to new im-
munotherapy agents. The panel discussion highlighted the
need for collaboration between key stakeholders, in par-
ticular patients, physicians, and policy makers, to prevent
the development of unnecessary regulations and costs that
would restrict access. In addition, panelists from industry
highlighted efforts to increase patient access through dis-
count and reimbursement programs. In this discussion, it
was emphasized that to ensure patient access, the overall
value of immunotherapy needs to be better established in
order to justify the financial costs associated with these
therapies. Other critical issues include sustainability and
the additional costs of new diagnostic procedures applied
at larger scales across larger patient populations.
Conclusions
Dr. Atkins concluded the Summit by reflecting on the
remarkable success of cancer immunotherapy in recent
years. He then challenged the audience to continue to
drive this success by striving to make cancer a “curable”
rather than a “chronic” disease. Building on the outcomes
of this Summit, SITC will continue to better define the
value of cancer immunotherapy in order to inform all
stakeholders of the unique properties of immunotherapy
and to ensure that patients and healthcare professionals
feel empowered to make informed treatment decisions
about their care and have access to high-quality treatment
implementation. A better definition of the value of cancer
immunotherapy will also benefit society in helping to re-
duce oncology costs by promoting the development of
new drugs and ensuring that patients with cancer have ac-
cess to the most effective treatment. In addition, this will
also help to limit potential adverse events and improve in-
dividual patient outcomes with cancer immunotherapy.
