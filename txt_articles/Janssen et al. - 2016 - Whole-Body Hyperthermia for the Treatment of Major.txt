IMPORTANCE Limitations of current antidepressants highlight the need to identify novel
treatments for major depressive disorder. A prior open trial found that a single session of
whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) reduced depressive symptoms; however, the lack of a
placebo control raises the possibility that the observed antidepressant effects resulted not
from hyperthermia per se, but from nonspecific aspects of the intervention.
OBJECTIVE To test whether WBH has specific antidepressant effects when compared with a
sham condition and to evaluate the persistence of the antidepressant effects of a single
treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 6-week, randomized, double-blind study conducted
between February 2013 and May 2015 at a university-based medical center comparing WBH
with a sham condition. All research staff conducting screening and outcome procedures were
blinded to randomization status. Of 338 individuals screened, 34 were randomized, 30
received a study intervention, and 29 provided at least 1 postintervention assessment and
were included in a modified intent-to-treat efficacy analysis. Participants were medically
healthy, aged 18 to 65 years, met criteria for major depressive disorder, were free of
psychotropic medication use, and had a baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
score of 16 or greater.
INTERVENTIONS A single session of active WBH vs a sham condition matched for length of
WBH that mimicked all aspects of WBH except intense heat.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Between-group differences in postintervention Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale scores.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 36.7 (15.2) years in the WBH group and 41.47 (12.54) years in
the sham group. Immediately following the intervention, 10 participants (71.4%) randomized
to sham treatment believed they had received WBH compared with 15 (93.8%) randomized
to WBH. When compared with the sham group, the active WBH group showed significantly
reduced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores across the 6-week postintervention study
period (WBH vs sham; week 1: −6.53, 95% CI, −9.90 to −3.16, P < .001; week 2: −6.35, 95% CI,
−9.95 to −2.74, P = .001; week 4: −4.50, 95% CI, −8.17 to −0.84, P = .02; and week 6: −4.27,
95% CI, −7.94 to −0.61, P = .02). These outcomes remained significant after evaluating
potential moderating effects of between-group differences in baseline expectancy scores.
Adverse events in both groups were generally mild.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Whole-body hyperthermia holds promise as a safe,
rapid-acting, antidepressant modality with a prolonged therapeutic benefit.

depressivedisorder(MDD).1Forexample,inhumans,exposure
to cutaneous heating (41°C) activates the midorbitofrontal cor-
tex, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, and the ventral
striatum, with the degree of activation being associated with
subjective pleasantness ratings made in response to the warm
temperature.2 Importantly, these and other brain regions most
implicatedinregistering—andreactingto—pleasantthermalsig-
nals show decreased activity in patients with MDD.3 Moreover,
patients with MDD display abnormalities in thermoregulation
characterizedbyincreasedcorebodytemperatureandreduced
ability to sweat, both of which have been reported to normal-
ize following successful treatment and both of which would be
expected consequences of reduced activity in warm-sensitive
thermosensory pathways in the periphery, brain, or both.1
Basedontheseconsiderations,weconductedanimalstud-
ies demonstrating that whole-body heating activated subdi-
visions of the dorsal raphe nucleus implicated in mood regu-
lation and antidepressantlike responses, while not activating
other dorsal raphe subregions, including those implicated
inthefacilitationofanxietystates.4,5Wealsofoundthatwhole-
body heating produced an acute antidepressantlike response
(unpublished data; M. W. Hale, J. L. Lukkes, K. F. Dady, K. J.
Kelly, E. D. Paul, C.L.R., C.A.L.; October 2010). To conduct a
preliminary examination of the relevance of these preclinical
findings, we previously conducted a small open trial of whole-
bodyhyperthermia(WBH)inhumans.6In16medicallyhealthy
adults with MDD, we found that a single session of WBH was
significantly associated with a reduction in depressive symp-
toms when measured 5 days after treatment.
While intriguing, these findings provided no way of sepa-
rating direct biological effects of hyperthermia from the many
nonspecificandplaceboeffectsthatattendanyconceptuallyat-
tractive and invasive procedure such as WBH. In addition, af-
tertheday-5posttreatmentassessment,participantsintheopen
trial received other treatments, making it impossible to assess
how long the benefits of a single WBH treatment might persist.
To address these issues, the current study used a random-
ized, double-blind design to compare WBH with a sham pro-
cedure that matched all aspects of the active treatment
except the intense heat. In addition, the study used a 6-week
follow-up period during which participants received no other
antidepressant treatment. We hypothesized that a single ses-
sion of WBH would reduce depressive symptoms 1 week after
treatment when compared with sham, and we sought to char-
acterize whether any observed improvements in depressive
symptoms would persist across 6 weeks of follow-up. In ad-
dition, we sought to better understand the development and
time course of adverse events in response to WBH.
Methods
The University of Arizona institutional review board ap-
proved the study. Signed informed consent was obtained from
all participants after a full description of study procedures and
risks and potential benefits was provided and prior to con-
ducting any study procedures. The full study protocol can be
found in Supplement 1.
Participants
ThisstudyenrolledparticipantsattheBannerUniversityMedi-
cal Center in Tucson, Arizona, between February 2013 and May
2015. Participants were recruited via print, radio, posted fli-
ers, email listserv, social media, and television advertising. Eli-
gible participants were men and women, aged 18 to 65 years,
who were medically healthy and had MDD for at least 4 weeks
prior to signing consent per DSM-IV-TR criteria. The study ini-
tially required a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HDRS) score of 18 or greater for enrollment, but this cutoff was
lowered to 16 or greater as a result of many otherwise eligible
individuals presenting with HDRS scores of 16 and 17 at screen-
ing. Of the 34 randomized participants, 11 were enrolled with
a screening score of 18 or greater and 23 were enrolled with a
screening score of 16 or greater. A full listing of study inclu-
sionandexclusioncriteriaisprovidedineTable1inSupplement
2. At screening, all participants underwent routine hemato-
logical and biochemical laboratory testing, urine toxicology,
and pregnancy testing (in premenopausal women only) and
received an electrocardiogram.
Randomization and Blinding
Participants were randomized on an equal (ie, 1-to-1) basis in
blocks of 6 to a single treatment of WBH or sham based on a
computer-generated randomization list that was provided to
the study by the Arizona Statistics Consulting Laboratory. This
list was kept by a Psychiatry Department administrator who
had no contact with any study participants. Participants re-
mained blinded to their randomization status until comple-
tion of the last study assessment at posttreatment week 6. A
full description of study blinding procedures is provided in the
eAppendix in Supplement 2.

Key Points
Question Does whole-body hyperthermia have an antidepressant
effect not accounted for by placebo factors alone and, if so, how
long does this effect last following a single treatment?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, when compared with a
sham-control condition, a single session of whole-body
hyperthermia produced a significant antidepressant effect
apparent within a week of treatment that persisted for 6 weeks
after treatment.
Meaning Whole-body hyperthermia holds promise as a safe,
rapid-acting, antidepressant modality with a prolonged
therapeutic benefit. Additional studies are required to evaluate
whether different levels of heat exposure or repeated treatments
might increase the intervention’
s antidepressant signal.

of completing screening. Between screening and baseline as-
sessment, participants completed the Inventory of Depres-
sive Symptomatology—Self-report (IDS-SR) at home (mean
[SD], 8.28 [4.17] days after screening). Participants showing a
30% or greater reduction from their IDS-SR score at screening
were considered likely placebo responders and were discon-
tinued from the study. On the intervention day, participants
arrived at the medical center at 8 AM and completed a base-
lineassessmentcomprisingquestionnairesthatassessedallpri-
mary and secondary study outcomes. Following this, they
resteduntilcommencingthestudyinterventionbetweennoon
and1 PM.Oncompletionoftheintervention,participantsrested
for 1 hour and were released to home. Follow-up assessments
were conducted at postintervention days 1, 2, and 3, and weeks
1, 2, 4, and 6. Need for initiation of an antidepressant or psy-
chotherapy during the 6-week follow-up period resulted in
study discontinuation.
Study Interventions
For both WBH and sham, the current study used a Heckel
HT3000 WBH system (Heckel Medizintechnik GmbH and
HydrosunMedizintechnikGmbH).Sensorscontinuouslymoni-
tored core and skin temperatures and heart rate throughout
the procedures. See the eFigure in Supplement 2 for a photo-
graph of the Heckel device.
Based on positive results from our prior open trial, we used
mild-intensity hyperthermia in the active condition. Partici-
pants randomized to active WBH received heating at the level
of the chest by infrared lights and at the level of the lower
extremities by infrared heating coils until their core body tem-
perature reached 38.5°C, which is the upper limit tempera-
ture for mild-intensity WBH.7 Time to attainment of this core
body temperature varied from patient to patient but required
a mean (SD) length of 107 (19.4) minutes (range, 81-140 min-
utes). When core body temperature reached 38.5°C, the infra-
red lights and heating coils were turned off, and participants
remained recumbent in the Heckel device and entered a 60-
minute cool-down phase.
All procedures for the sham condition were identical to
WBH, except that orange-colored nonheating lights and a false
fan were used to produce a similar color and noise as the in-
fraredlightsbutprovidenoheat.Toincreasebelievability,mild
heat was provided within the Heckel device by activating the
heating coils situated above participants’lower extremities at
the same setting used for active WBH, while keeping the pri-
mary infrared lights off. For each participant randomized to
theshamWBHcondition,timeintheHeckeldeviceinthemild-
heating phase was matched to the time the prior participant
of the same sex undergoing actual WBH spent in the active
heating phase. As with WBH, the cool-down phase in the sham
condition was 60 minutes. The mean (SD) maximal core body
temperature achieved during sham treatment was 37.69°C
(0.32), which was significantly lower than the mean (SD) maxi-
mal core temperature achieved during WBH (38.85°C [0.45];
P < .001). Similarly, mean (SD) core body temperature in-
creased less during sham than during WBH (sham: 0.78°C
[0.36] vs WBH: 1.91°C [0.49]; P < .001). The mean (SD) maxi-
mal skin temperature achieved during sham treatment was
39.79°C (1.32), which was lower than the maximum skin tem-
perature achieved during WBH (40.74 [0.85]; P = .03). For a
photograph of the Heckel HT3000 delivering hyperthermia,
see the eFigure in Supplement 2.
Outcome Measures
The study’
s a priori primary outcome measure was reduction
in depression severity across the 6-week study period as as-
sessed by the 17-item HDRS at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks following
exposuretoeitherWBHorshamtreatment.Trainedratersblind
to group assignment performed all HDRS assessments.
Training to establish interrater reliability was overseen by
the principal investigator (C.L.R.) and was conducted
according to a standard procedure for the HDRS.8 Five raters
conducted HDRS assessments for the study. Interrater reli-
ability was assessed using a 2-way mixed, consistency,
average-measures intraclass correlation coefficient to assess
the degree that coders provided consistency in their ratings
of HDRS scores.9 The resulting intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient was in the excellent range (intraclass correlation
coefficient = 0.985),10 indicating that coders had a high
degree of agreement and suggesting that HDRS scores were
rated similarly across coders.
Secondary outcome measures included IDS-SR scores at
posttreatment days 1, 2, and 3, and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6, as well
as Sheehan Disability Scale and Quality of Life Enjoyment Sat-
isfaction Scale—short-form scores at posttreatment weeks 1,
2, 4, and 6. Adverse events were assessed immediately after
study interventions and at postintervention weeks 1, 2, 4, and
6 with the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve
Depression Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE)
questionnaire. At baseline, the Credibility/Expectation
Questionnaire (CEQ) and the Massachusetts General Hospi-
tal Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire were
administered.11,12 We also assessed length of the current
depressive episode and number of past episodes. In addi-
tion, to assess the believability of the sham condition,
immediately following the study intervention, participants
were asked to guess whether they had received the active or
sham treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Frequency distributions, means, and SDs were calculated for
the primary and secondary outcome measures for all waves
ofdatacollection.Distributionswereexaminedforoutliersand
for significant deviations from normality. The primary study
hypothesis was tested with a hierarchical linear model, with
an autoregressive covariance structure using 0, 7, 14, 28, and
42 days’measurement of HDRS with a linear model on ln
(t+1), where t is time from treatment. The mixed-effect model
provides unbiased estimates assuming data are missing at ran-
dom conditional on information in the model. A similar hier-
archical linear model approach was used to evaluate poten-
tial between-group differences in adverse events. Cohen d was
calculated to assess effect sizes for between-group differ-
ences at all posttreatment points based on means and SDs de-
rived from the mixed-effect model. Because baseline expec-
tancy scores differed between groups, possible moderation of

treatment effect by baseline expectations was done by obtain-
ing estimated marginal HDRS means for each participant from
the primary hierarchical linear model analysis. A dichoto-
mous expectancy variable was created by categorizing par-
ticipants with expectancy scores less than the median score
of zero as low expectancy and participants with greater than
or equal to zero as high expectancy. Treatment condition, ex-
pectancy group, and their interaction were entered into an
analysisofvariance.Astatisticallysignificantinteractionwould
indicate that baseline expectancy was a moderator. All tests
were 2-tailed, with significance set at P < .05. Analyses were
conducted with SPSS version 22 for Windows (IBM).
Results
Study Participants
Figure 1 shows the disposition of the 338 individuals screened
for study participation. Thirty-four of those screened met in-
clusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to receive
a study intervention. Thirty received a study intervention
(16activeWBHand14sham).OneparticipantintheactiveWBH
group elected to discontinue the study prior to completion of
any postintervention assessments, 2 individuals randomized
to sham discontinued the study between the postinterven-
tion week 1 and week 2 assessments, and 1 discontinued fol-
lowingtheweek2assessment.Thetreatmentgroupswerewell
matched at baseline on a range of demographic and clinical
measures, as shown in Table 1. However, CEQ expectancy
scores were significantly higher in the group that subse-
quently received active WBH than in the group randomized to
sham (mean [SD] expectancy score, 1.02 [2.68] vs −1.26 [1.91],
respectively; mean [SD] credibility score, 0.89 [2.72] vs −1.01
[2.50], respectively).
Outcome Measures
Supporting the credibility of our sham condition, 10 of 14 par-
ticipants (71.4%) randomized to sham believed they had
receivedactivehyperthermiaimmediatelyoncompletionofthe
procedure (compared with 15 of 16 [93.8%] receiving active
WBH). Table 2 provides scores for the primary study end point
(HDRS scores at postintervention weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6); eTable
2 in Supplement 2 provides scores for relevant secondary out-
come measures (IDS-SR, Sheehan Disability Scale, and Quality
of Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Scale—short-form). As shown in
Figure2,whencomparedwiththeshamgroup,theactiveWBH
group showed significantly reduced HDRS scores across the
6-week postintervention study period (WBH vs sham; week 1:
−6.53, 95% CI, −9.90 to −3.16, P < .001, d = 2.23; week 2: −6.35,

Cognizant of recent concerns regarding the potential of ad-
justment for unplanned covariates to produce false findings,13
covariates were not entered into our primary analysis. How-
ever, because baseline expectancy scores differed between
groups (mean [95% CI], 1.02 [−0.41 to 2.45] for WBH vs −1.26
[−2.42 to −0.10] for sham; P = .02), we conducted a moderator
analysis in the 30 participants with CEQ scores. This analysis
did not find that CEQ expectancy scores significantly moder-
atedbetween-groupdifferencesinHDRSscore(mean[95%CI],
WBH/low expectancy, 15.25 [13.31 to 17.19]; WBH/high expec-

to19.83];sham/highexpectancy,20.91[18.52to23.29];P = .07),
which remained significant in the moderator analysis (mean
[95% CI], WBH, 14.85 [13.62 to 16.08]; sham, 19.58 [18.15 to
21.01]; P < .001).
Safety of Study Interventions
A full listing of PRISE-assessed adverse events is provided in
eTable 3 in Supplement 2. No significant difference in overall
adverseeventswasobservedbetweentreatmentgroupsacross
the postintervention study period. The most common ad-
verse effects immediately following both study interven-
tions were headache, fatigue, and dry mouth, with no statis-
ticaldifferencebetweengroups.Numerically,participantswho
received WBH reported more sweating and nausea.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, double-blind,
sham-controlled study of WBH for the treatment of MDD. Con-
sistent with results from a prior small open trial,6 the current
study found that WBH was associated with a substantial re-
duction in depressive symptoms that was apparent within 1
week of treatment. Moreover, the use of a credible sham
condition increases confidence that the effect of WBH on de-
pressive symptoms is not solely the result of placebo factors
related to nonspecific aspects of the procedure. Indeed, rec-
ognizing the modest effect of sham treatment is important
for not “overselling” the therapeutic effects of WBH.
Although a single session of WBH produced a clear antide-
pressant signal, rates of response and remission at each
postintervention assessment were lower than are typically
observed in antidepressant trials in which the intervention
is delivered on a daily basis throughout the study period
(eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
That a single treatment of WBH might produce long-term
symptomatic improvement is consistent with results from
other novel antidepressant interventions, such as ketamine
and scopolamine, which have also demonstrated therapeutic
effects that outlast their immediate biological actions.14,15
Based on results from most studies of ketamine for MDD, we
anticipated that the magnitude of the antidepressant
response to WBH would diminish between postintervention
weeks 1 and 6 as participants experienced a relapse in their
depressive symptoms, as is common following a single expo-
sure to ketamine.14 However, 2 points require consideration
prior to concluding that WBH may have a longer duration of
effect than is typical for ketamine or scopolamine. First, as is
apparent from Figure 2 and Table 2, active improvement in
mean HDRS scores in the WBH group only occurred during
the first 2 weeks after treatment, after which scores were
maintained but not further reduced. This suggests a time-
frame of biologic effect more in line with the assumed
effects of ketamine and scopolamine. Second, the lack of
relapse across the 2-week postintervention period was seen
in both the WBH and sham groups and may reflect to an
important degree the fact that the study sample—although
had chronic depression—was not formally treatment resis-
tant. Had a treatment-resistant population been recruited,
relapse rates following WBH may have more closely approxi-
mated those seen with ketamine in treatment-resistant
populations.

In general, the adverse effect profiles of both WBH and the
sham comparator were mild and time limited. Adverse ef-
fects obviously induced by WBH, such as sweating or thirst,
had already resolved when posttreatment adverse effects were
assessed approximately 1 hour after treatment. No serious ad-
verse events occurred during the study. Although we did not

Several limitations warrant discussion. The study sample

limited the ability to test the moderating effects of baseline co-
variates not balanced by randomization. In addition, al-
though a large proportion of people randomized to the sham
(71.4%)guessedincorrectlythattheyhadreceivedactiveWBH,
it does not change the fact that the experience of the sham and
WBH treatments was different in terms of the degree of heat
experienced.Becausethiskeyaspectofthe2interventionswas
significantly different, the possibility that functional unblind-
ingcontributedtodifferencesbetweenthe2interventionscan-
not be dismissed. This is highlighted by the fact that almost
all participants who received WBH correctly guessed they had
received the active intervention.
Although most participants had experienced continuous
depression for an extended period, we did not specifically en-
rollparticipantswithtreatment-resistantdepression.Thus,we
do not know how effective WBH would be in this specific sub-
population of individuals for whom a new treatment might be
ofmostvalue.SpecificallyevaluatingtheeffectivenessofWBH
intreatment-resistantdepressionwillbeanimportantnextstep
indeterminingwheretheinterventionwillfitinrelationtocur-
rent treatment algorithms. Nonetheless, we note that with its
sustained antidepressant effect and mild effect profile, WBH
might be an attractive alternative to antidepressant treat-
ment in the large percentage of individuals with depression
who might respond adequately to an antidepressant trial, but
who harbor negative beliefs/feelings about antidepressant
medications that have been shown to reduce adherence and
worsen therapeutic outcomes.16,17
Finally, our selection of mild hyperthermia was based on
the fact that the same temperature had produced an antide-
pressant signal in an earlier open trial and the fact that higher
temperatures might be more likely to activate sensory path-
ways that respond to noxious levels of heat and that activate
brain areas thought to already be hyperactive in MDD.6,18 In
addition, the risks and adverse effect burden of higher levels
of WBH (ie, >38.5°C) are significantly greater,7 which would
reduce the attractiveness of the intervention for prospective
patients. However, we do not know whether either higher or
lower levels of heat might produce more robust antidepres-
sant responses.
Conclusions
Results from the current study suggest that WBH holds prom-
ise as a safe, rapid-acting, antidepressant modality with a pro-
longed therapeutic benefit. Future studies will be required to
identify both the optimal temperature and number and tim-
ing of treatments likely to produce the largest and longest-
lasting clinical response in most patients.
