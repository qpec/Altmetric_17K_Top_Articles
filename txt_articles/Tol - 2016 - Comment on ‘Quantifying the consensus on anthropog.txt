Abstract
Cook et al’s highly influential consensus study (2013 Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) finds
different results than previous studies in the consensus literature. It omits tests for systematic
differences between raters. Many abstracts are unaccounted for. The paper does not discuss the
procedures used to ensure independence between the raters, to ensure that raters did not use
additional information, and to ensure that later ratings were not influenced by earlier results.
Clarifying these issues would further strengthen the paper, and establish it as our best estimate
of the consensus.
The consensus paper by Cook et al (2013) generated a
lot of interest. Consensus is not proof, but occasional
stock takes of the state of scientific knowledge are
useful for identifying fruitful new research avenues
and potential paradigm shifts. Agreement, or per-
ceived agreement, about the extent and causes of
climate change has no bearing on rational choices
about greenhouse gas emission reduction—those are
driven by the trade-offs between the impacts of climate
change and the impacts of climate policy—but it does
affect the public perception of and the political debate
on climate policy, as does the integrity of climate
research.
Cook et al (2013) estimate the fraction of pub-
lished papers that argue, explicitly or implicitly, that
most of the recent global warming is human-made.
They find a consensus rate of 96%–98%. Other stu-
dies6 find different numbers, ranging from 47% in
Bray and von Storch (2007) to 100% in Oreskes (2004)
—if papers or experts that do not take a position
are excluded, as in Cook et al. If included, Cook et al
find a consensus rate of 33%–63%. Other studies
range from 40% in Bray and von Storch (2007) to 96%
in (Carlton et al 2015). Cook et al use the whole sam-
ple. Other studies find substantial variation between
subsamples. Doran and Zimmerman (2009), for
instance, find 82% for the whole sample, while the
consensus in subsamples ranges from 47% to 97%.
Verheggen et al (2014) find 66% for the whole sample,
with subsample consensus ranging from 7% to 79%.
Figure 1 shows these estimates; see also table A1 in the
appendix.
Measuring ‘consensus’ is, of course, not easy—
the human brain always reinterprets information
presented. Different studies may have different
objects of consensus. This is illustrated by Carlton
et al (2015) who ask four different questions—about
the impact on climate change of human activities,
greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and the Sun—
and find four different results for the consensus rate
(90%, 96%, 89%, and 71%, respectively). Other
survey studies ask slightly different questions again.
Oreskes (2004) and Cook et al (2013) rate abstracts,
but where Oreskes finds 75% agreement and 25%
no position, Cook has 33% agreement, 66% no
position and 1% disagreement. Cook’s raters often
disagree with each other about the message of a

 paper (Cook and Cowtan 2015) and they disagree
with the authors too (Tol 2014a).
These differences notwithstanding, the results by
Cook et al (2013) seem to be at the high end in the con-
sensus literature when ‘no position’ is excluded, and at
the low end when included. As Cook et al have a
sample that is so much larger than in other studies,
you would expect its results to lie towards the centre of
earlier results. Figure 1 highlights that this is not
the case.
It may be that there is a trend in consensus findings,
and that study by Cook et al stands out because it is
recent. Cook et al (2013) argue that there is an upward
trend in consensus but Tol (2014a) shows that this is a
trend in composition rather than agreement. There
appears to be no trend in the consensus rate across stu-
dies. There is no statistically significant trend in the
results that include all. There is a statistically significant
trend in the results that exclude ‘no position’, but this
trend disappears if the 1996 Bray and von Storch esti-
mateisomitted.SeefigureA1intheappendix.
The problem may lie in the methodology of Cook
et al (2013)—although earlier papers are not above criti-
cism either (Peiser 2005, Duarte 2014). Reusswig (2013)
praisesCooket al but Legateset al(2015) and Tol(2014a)
question its data and methodology (Bedford and
Cook 2013, Cook et al 2014a, Tol 2014b). Dean (2015)
notes that the paper omits inter-rater reliability tests.
Cook and Cowtan (2015) add these. These methodologi-
calexchangesomitthefollowingfivepoints:
1. Cook et al (2013) do not show tests for systematic
differences between raters. Abstract rater IDs may or
may not be confidential (Queensland 2012, 2014),

Doran, Anderegg, Stenhouse, Verheggen) as a function of the sample size; the top panel excludes don’t know/no position, the bottom
panel includes don’t know/no position.

 but the authors could have reported test results
withoutrevealing identities.
2. The paper argues that the raters were independent.
Yet, the raters were drawn from the same group.
Cook et al (2013) are unfortunately silent on the
procedures that were put in place to prevent
communication between raters.
3. The paper states that ‘information such as author
names and affiliations, journal and publishing date
were hidden’ from the abstract raters. Yet, such
information can easily be looked up. Unfortu-
nately, Cook et al (2013) omit the steps taken to
prevent raters from gathering additional informa-
tion, and for disqualifying ratings based on such
information.
4. Cook et al (2013) state that 12 465 abstracts were
downloaded from the Web of Science, yet their
supporting data show that there were 12 876
abstracts. A later query returned 13 458, only 27 of
which were added after Cook ran his query
(Tol
2014a).
The
paper
is
silent
on
these
discrepancies.
5. The date stamps, which may or may not have been
collected (Cook 2013, Cook et al 2014b), reveal that
the abstracts were originally rated in two disjoint
periods (mid-February to mid-April; second half of
May). There was a third period of data collection,
in which neutral abstracts were reclassified.
Unfortunately, Cook et al (2013) do not make clear
what steps were taken to ensure that those who
rated abstracts in the second and third periods did
not have access to the results of the first and second
periods.
It would be of considerable benefit to readers if
these issues would be clarified, if at all possible. That
would help to convince people that the results of Cook
et al are not just different but better than those in other
studies.
Cook et al (2013) renewed interest in the question
how to communicate (climate) science. While several
studies show that people respond to cues about the sci-
entific consensus (Guy et al 2014, Myers et al 2015,
Van der Linden 2015, van der Linden et al 2014, 2015),
other studies show that this effect is dominated in the
long run by other factors (Bliuc et al 2015, Campbell
and Kay 2014, Kahan 2015).
