During the 2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, we detected 
Zika virus RNA in urine samples collected from Zika virus–
positive pregnant women during different stages of preg-
nancy. Women had positive and negative intervals of viru-
ria; 3 newborns had adverse outcomes. Further research is 
needed to clarify the relationship between viruria and out-
comes for newborns.
Z
ika virus is a reemerging flavivirus that was first iso-
lated in Uganda in 1947 during the course of a yellow 
fever virus survey (1). The virus remained at low transmis-
sion levels until the first Zika virus outbreak in Micronesia 
in 2007, spreading to the Pacific Islands in 2013–2014 and 
reaching Brazil in 2015 (2). Before the outbreak in Brazil, 
Zika virus infection was considered a mild febrile illness 
that did not produce severe outcomes. However, the cases 
of microcephaly, fetal abnormalities, and Guillain–Barré 
syndrome reported in Brazil reshaped our knowledge of 
the course of infection with this flavivirus, and demand for 
a rapid molecular approach to diagnose Zika virus infec-
tion began (2).
Molecular diagnosis of flavivirus infections is usually 
performed with blood or serum samples during the viremic 
period, which is sustained for ≈5–7 days (3). In the case 
of Zika virus infection, urine, saliva, and semen have been 
identified as additional sources that can be used for viral 
RNA detection. Urine and semen are especially useful; de-
tection in these fluids is prolonged, being present even after 
the clearance of viremia (4,5). We describe the detection of 
Zika virus RNA in the urine from a group of Zika virus–
positive pregnant women.
The Study
During the February–October 2016 Zika virus outbreak, 
pregnant patients with Zika-like symptoms were treat-
ed at the Public Health Authority in São José do Rio 
Preto, Brazil. We collected serum and urine samples 
from these women during their first visit to the facil-
ity after symptom onset (Table) and tested their samples 
for Zika virus RNA (6). We extracted viral RNA from 
140 µL of each sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. We performed a 1-step, 
quantitative, real-time, fluorescent probe–based PCR 
with primers targeting the Zika virus envelope gene as 
 
previously described (6).
Pregnant women who were Zika virus positive by 
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (6) 
were monitored by a multidisciplinary medical team at the 
Criança e Maternidade Teaching Hospital in São José do 
Rio Preto, and viruria levels in urine were measured un-
til delivery. RT-qPCR results were considered positive 
if the cycle threshold (Ct) was <38.5 and negative if the 
Ct was >38.5, as described previously (6). The pregnant 
women considered for enrollment in this study were 4–38 
weeks into their pregnancies. This work was approved by 
the institutional review board of the São José do Rio Preto 
School of Medicine.
RT-qPCR results showed that urine samples taken 
from patients at different weeks of gestation were positive 
for Zika virus RNA; however, some of the consecutively 
collected samples were negative, showing positive and 
negative intervals (Table). Although not all samples were 
positive, we detected viral RNA in urine samples acquired 
sequentially over a course of >4 weeks for 6 of 13 patients 
(nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13). The maximum period of detection 
was 7 months (patient no. 2). The number of collections 
varied depending on when during the pregnancy the pa-
tient started treatment at the facility and when the last urine 
sample was collected before delivery. Of the 12 newborns 
for which outcomes were known, 3 (25%) had adverse out-
comes: 1 had subependymal cysts and 2 had unilateral ab-
normal otoacoustic emissions (Table).
Conclusions
We report findings of long-term viruria among Zika 
virus‒positive pregnant women, with Zika virus RNA

 DISPATCHES
being detectable in urine during different stages of preg-
nancy. Plasma and serum are considered the biologic 
fluids of choice for the molecular diagnosis of Zika vi-
rus for <5 days after illness onset (6,7). However, after 
this short viremic period, these fluids are no longer ideal 
for diagnosis, although whole blood has been found to 
be more sensitive than plasma for Zika virus detection 
(6–8). A diagnosis on the basis of viremia is not recom-
mended for cases in pregnant women >1 week after the 
onset of symptoms (7). In this study, Zika virus RNA 
was detected in the urine samples from pregnant women 
collected 1‒7 months after the onset of symptoms; how-
ever, viruria was not detected after the women delivered. 
We suspect that this phenomenon might occur because 
virus replication is maintained in fetal tissues (e.g., 
brain, placenta, umbilical cord, liver, lung, spleen, mus-
cles) at different viral loads (7,9) and that these tissues, 
therefore, act as virus reservoirs (9). The intermittence 
of Zika virus RNA detection in urine samples (fluctua-
tion between negative and positive Ct results) was likely 
due to the sensitivity of the test. More studies are nec-
essary to understand the dynamics of the replication of 
Zika virus in fetal tissues and its connection to viruria in 
pregnant women.
Urine, semen, and saliva have been described as 
specimens that can be used in the molecular detection of 
Zika virus after the clearance of viremia (4,5). The de-
tection of RNA of other flaviviruses in urine and semen 
samples has been previously described (5,10), and for 
these viruses, viral RNA is detectable for longer dura-
tions and at higher viral loads in semen and urine sam-
ples than they are in plasma samples (5,11). The pres-
ence of Zika virus RNA in semen samples supports the 
theory of sexual transmission and has led to discussions

 Viruria in Zika Virus–Infected Pregnant Women
of Zika virus replication in the genitourinary tract (5). 
This hypothesis is supported by West Nile virus liter-
ature showing the detection of virus RNA in the renal 
cells of experimentally infected hamsters (10). Zika vi-
rus viruria and the presence of the virus in the peritu-
bular cells of the testes (12,13) suggests that renal tis-
sue might be a repository of the virus. However, in our 
study, Zika virus RNA was not detected in urine samples 
at all stages of pregnancy.
The use of urine for diagnosis represents an additional 
tool for virus detection. Urine is easy to obtain from preg-
nant women (because collection of this sample does not 
induce physiologic stress) and can be taken >5 days after 
the onset of clinical symptoms (14,15). The detection of 
Zika virus RNA (particularly in blood, urine, and semen) 
>5‒7 days after symptom onset is a new feature in the body 
of knowledge available on flaviviruses. The spread of Zika 
virus and its consequences have led to a paradigm shift and 
a race to develop new technologies to help understand the 
virus and prevent infection.
Considering that some mothers had viruria just before 
delivery and newborns without adverse outcomes, the ad-
verse outcomes of the 3 newborns might or might not have 
been related to the viruria. Because microcephaly and fetal 
abnormalities have been attributed to Zika virus, continu-
ing to monitor women who had Zika virus infections during 
their pregnancies will be essential to manage adverse fetal 
outcomes. The monitoring of Zika virus viruria in pregnant 
women through the regular collection of urine samples 
over the course of the pregnancy proved to be a workable 
approach; however, the meaning of viruria and the conse-
quences for newborns will need to be evaluated further. 
Whether virus replicates in fetal tissues and uses them as 
reservoirs remains to be determined.
