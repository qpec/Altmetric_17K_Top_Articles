ORIGINAL ARTICLE
Abstract: Cohort studies can be biased by unmeasured confounding. 
We propose a hybrid ecologic-epidemiologic design called the trend-
in-trend design, which requires a strong time trend in exposure, but 
is unbiased unless there are unmeasured factors affecting outcome 
for which there are time trends in prevalence that are correlated with 
time trends in exposure across strata with different exposure trends. 
Thus, the conditions under which the trend-in-trend study is biased 
are a subset of those under which a cohort study is biased. The trend-
in-trend design first divides the study population into strata based on 
the cumulative probability of exposure given covariates, which effec-
tively stratifies on time trend in exposure, provided there is a trend. 
Next, a covariates-free maximum likelihood model estimates the odds 
ratio (OR) using data on exposure prevalence and outcome frequency 
within cumulative probability of exposure strata, across multiple peri-
ods. In simulations, the trend-in-trend design produced ORs with neg-
ligible bias in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In empiric 
applications, trend-in-trend reproduced the known positive association 
between rofecoxib and myocardial infarction (observed OR: 1.2, 95% 
confidence interval: 1.1, 1.4), and known null associations between 
rofecoxib and severe hypoglycemia (OR = 1.1 [0.92, 1.3]) and non-
vertebral fracture (OR = 0.84 [0.64, 1.1]). The trend-in-trend method 
may be useful in settings where there is a strong time trend in expo-
sure, such as a newly approved drug or other medical intervention. See

any important causal questions cannot be addressed 
through randomized trials because of ethical or practical 
reasons. Ecologic studies address causal questions by examin-
ing time trends in exposure and outcome, but can be biased by 
co-occurring trends in other factors affecting outcome.1 Epide-
miologic designs such as the cohort study can be biased if there 
are unmeasured determinants of exposure that are associated 
with outcome (i.e., unmeasured confounders). In this article, we 
introduce a novel hybrid ecologic-epidemiologic design called 
the trend-in-trend design. Rather than comparing exposed ver-
sus unexposed persons, the trend-in-trend design examines 
time trends in outcome as a function of time trends in exposure 
across strata with different time trends in exposure. Intuitively, 
in a population stratified on time trends in exposure, an asso-
ciation between exposure time trends and outcome time trends 
across strata should provide evidence for causation unless there 
are unmeasured factors affecting outcome for which there are 
time trends in prevalence that are correlated with time trends in 
exposure across strata. Thus, the scenarios under which a trend-
in-trend study is susceptible to unmeasured confounding should 
be a subset of those under which a cohort study is susceptible, 
making the design more resistant to unmeasured confounding 
than other designs. The trade-offs are that a trend-in-trend study 
is feasible only when there is a strong time trend in exposure, 
and should have less statistical precision than a cohort study.
While novel, the trend-in-trend design is related to two 
established econometric approaches. One is the difference-in-
difference method,4 as both address unmeasured confounding 
by examining within-group changes and time trends in outcome. 
However, unlike the method, the trend-in-trend design estimates 
an individual-level causal parameter. In particular, the trend-in-
trend design yields the odds ratio (OR), which approximates the 
risk ratio when the outcome is rare.3 The trend-in-trend method 
is also related to the use of calendar time as an instrumental 
variable (IV),5,6 and in fact the two are equivalent if only a sin-
gle stratum is used in the trend-in-trend design. However, use 
of calendar time as an IV can be biased by any time trend in 
the prevalence of an unmeasured factor that affects outcome. In 
contrast, the trend-in-trend design is biased by such a trend only 
if the time trend in the unmeasured factor is correlated with the

time trends in exposure across strata defined by factors associ-
ated with exposure. The trend-in-trend design therefore relaxes 
the assumptions under which a calendar time IV study is valid.
In this article, we first introduce the cumulative prob-
ability of exposure, which is used to divide the population into 
strata with different exposure prevalences and thus different 
time trends in exposure, provided that an overall time trend 
exists. We then propose two reasonable models for individu-
als and subgroups, respectively. Under the assumptions that the 
outcome is rare, covariates are either time invariant or change 
randomly over time within person, and there are no time trends 
in unmeasured causal factors that are associated with time 
trends in exposure across strata, we give a mathematical deri-
vation of the connection between individuals and subgroups 
and a method to estimate the OR using group-level data. We 
then show mathematically that this estimate is unbiased by both 
measured and unmeasured confounders. We report a simulation 
study illustrating that the OR estimated using the trend-in-trend 
method is much less biased than that estimated using cohort 
methods when there is unmeasured confounding by factor with 
no trend in prevalence. Finally, we apply the trend-in-trend 
method to healthcare data to reproduce the known positive 
association between rofecoxib and acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI),7 and two presumably null associations: rofecoxib and 
severe hypoglycemia, and rofecoxib and bone fracture.8
METHODS
Stratification Based on the Cumulative 
Probability of Exposure
The analysis of a trend-in-trend study involves two stages. 
In the first stage, we estimate the cumulative probability of 
exposure, which is the predicted probability of exposure over 
the entire study period, based on variables other than exposure, 
outcome, and their potential effects. In particular, suppose we 
observe a population in which each individual’
s binary exposure 
status over the study period is observed. We also observe a set of 
variables that affect but are known from subject-area knowledge 
not to be affected by exposure, such as age, sex, geographic resi-
dence, diagnoses, etc. We fit a logistic regression model using 
these variables as independent variables, with the dependent 
variable being exposure. The fitted value is the estimated cumu-
lative probability of exposure. Because the unit of analysis for 
the cumulative probability of exposure model is the individual, 
and covariates are treated as invariant, each subject will be in the 
same cumulative probability of exposure stratum for all obser-
vation periods. If, analogously to a new user cohort study, sub-
jects are required to be present for a baseline period before the 
first opportunity for exposure, then the values for all variables 
in the cumulative probability of exposure model can be fixed 
at the first opportunity for exposure (e.g., drug approval). How-
ever, many healthcare databases have high turnover rates, and 
restricting the study to persons with sufficient baseline period 
before the first opportunity for exposure may drastically reduce 
available sample size. In such a situation, one can allow the value 
of cumulative probability of exposure variables that require time 
to ascertain (e.g., appearance of diagnoses) to be determined by 
data observed during the study period, provided that subject-
area knowledge can rule out the possibility that exposure status 
affected any cumulative probability of exposure variable. For 
an exposure with an overall time trend in prevalence, intuition 
tells us that the magnitude of the trend should vary across strata 
defined by the cumulative probability of exposure. The cumula-
tive probability of exposure is similar to the propensity score,9 
because both predict exposure, but differs from it in that the 
propensity score is used to balance observed covariates across 
exposure groups, while the cumulative probability of exposure 
is used to identify strata with different time trends in exposure. 
It may also be possible to directly model the trend itself rather 
than the cumulative probability of exposure. The second stage 
analysis, described below, applies to any population stratified on 
time trend in exposure prevalence.
Models in the Trend-in-trend Design
To derive a quantitative estimate of a causal effect, we pro-
pose two models of outcomes. One model is defined for each 
subject at each time point to account for covariates heteroge-
neity across population and time trends of outcome. The other 
one is specified at the population level at each time point, which 
depicts the mean outcome among those subjects within the same 
subgroup. We assume that the study population consists of N 
individuals and there are T time periods. Let Xi
t denotes the vec-
tor of covariates associated with individual i at time period t, 
which represents intrinsic characteristics that might influence a 
particular exposure and/or outcome. Xi
t can be observed, unob-
served, or partially observed. Xi
t is assumed to follow a dis-
tribution F across the population. Zi
t and Yi
t are exposure and 
outcome variables for individual i  at time period t. G is the index 
for cumulative probability of exposure strata.

where h is the link function. The subject-specific model is a 
special case of the generalized linear mixed model with expo-
sure and time period being the fixed effects and the covariates 
for an individual (some of which may be unobserved) repre-
sented as random effects.10 Because the trend-in-trend design 
is intended to estimate the instantaneous risk of an exposure, 
only Zi

predictor of the conditional expected outcome. The coefficient 
β1 for exposure has a causal interpretation at the individual 
level. It is also the logarithm of the OR when both exposure 
and outcome are binary, and the function h is logit.
When unmeasured confounding does not exist, that is, 
Xi
t can be fully observed, it is valid to estimate all coefficients

in Equation (1) using individual-level data. For example, the 
cohort design utilizes information about every unit in a group 
to examine associations with exposures.11 However, in obser-
vational studies, we cannot rule out the existence of unmea-
sured confounding, which may distort estimates of the fixed 
effects coefficients. In addition, the subject-specific model can 
be computationally challenging for the study of rare diseases 
because a large number of subjects is required.

) is a function on 
exposure and group, which represents the heterogeneity 
across exposed and unexposed subgroups. The population-
averaged model is the marginal expectation of the subject-
specific model. It does not require knowledge of covariates 
or assumptions of the heterogeneity across individuals. Its 
coefficients are directly estimable from the aggregated data 
on exposure and outcome, but do not have individual causal 
interpretation.
In general, the two models can be related by integrat-
ing out Xi
t. In Zeger et al.,10 the cases of identity, log, probit, 
and logit link functions are discussed and the corresponding

are listed in detail. The trend-in-trend method will be built 
on the population-averaged model. With the purpose of 
making causal inferences on individuals with a binary out-
come, we require the link function h to be logistic such that 
deriving OR exp(
)
β1  is possible and the estimated quantity 
approximates the risk ratio obtained from a cohort study of 
a rare outcome.
We next provide a mathematical derivation of the con-
nection between the two models and of how to estimate the 
causal OR using only data on trends in the prevalence of both 
exposure and outcome in strata. We further show that under 
plausible assumptions, the trend-in-trend method is uncon-
founded by measured and unmeasured factors, provided that 
there are no trends in the prevalence of covariates that are cor-
related with the prevalence of the exposure over time. As the 
scenarios that will lead to a confounded estimate in a trend-
in-trend study are a subset of those that will lead to a con-
founded estimate in a cohort study, the trend-in-trend design 
is more resistant to potential confounding. However, unlike 
the cohort design, the trend-in-trend design requires a strong 
time trend in exposure, so is available in fewer scenarios.
Estimation of the Odds Ratio
We first stratify the entire population into K strata accord-
ing to the quantiles of the estimated cumulative probability of 
exposure. For each subgroup G and each time period t, we 
aggregate the individual-level data to obtain quantities in the 
following table:
Because h is the logit function, we have

In general, there is no closed form for the marginal mean 
as a function of the fixed effects and β1 cannot be identified. 
However, an approximate form is available when we impose 
the following assumptions:

SIMULATIONS
We performed simulation studies to confirm that when 
unmeasured confounding is present, the OR produced by the 
trend-in-trend method is negligibly biased (albeit somewhat 
less precise) than that produced by a cohort study. We sim-
ulated a study population of size 250,000 with 20 calendar 
quarters as study periods. The data were generated according 
to the following procedure:
Step 1: The covariates Xi
t are a five-dimensional vector 
with three entries generated from a multivariate Gaussian dis-
tribution and two other entries generated from Bernoulli dis-
tributions with different success probabilities. Three scenarios 
are examined: (1) covariates are sampled only once and fixed 
over time, (2) covariates are sampled independently for each 
calendar period, and (3) covariates are sampled repeatedly for 
each calendar period with autocorrelation coefficient of 0.5.
Step 2: Assign Zi
t to 1 with the probability of 
exp(a
a X
a t

+

).
Step 3: Simulate Yi
t based on the subject-specific model 
and the choice of link function h.
We choose a0, a1, a2, a3 such that the simulated exposure 
prevalence has the “up-and-down” shape shown in  
Figure 1, 
which mimics the exposure trend of a drug that becomes widely 
used after introduction, and is then withdrawn (e.g., rofecoxib). 
However, the method should work for a unidirectional trend as 
well. A more detailed description of the simulation setup along 
with values of all parameters is provided in the Section 2 in 
supplementary material (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B123).
Based on the cumulative probabilities of exposure esti-
mated via logistic regression, the study population was strati-
fied into quintiles, that is, K = 5. As expected, these strata, 
each with 50,000 individuals, had different trends in exposure 
prevalence. The cumulative probability of exposure model 
included all five covariates, as shown in Figure 2.
We considered the following scenarios under the rare 
events assumption: (1) the OR takes values of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 
2.5; (2) the strength of the cumulative probability of exposure 
model has three levels quantified by zero, two, and four omitted 
confounders out of five confounders in total, and a c statistic is 
calculated for each level to gauge unobserved heterogeneity in 
factors affecting outcome; (3) the number of cumulative prob-
ability of exposure strata is either five or 10. We compare the 
estimated OR with those calculated using the cohort method. 
The results, which are the average values of 1,000 simulations, 
are summarized in Tables 1–3, corresponding to three different 
scenarios of covariates sampling as described above.
As expected, when there were no unmeasured confound-
ers, both the trend-in-trend and cohort designs yielded ORs 
that were close to the truth. However, as the number of unmea-
sured confounders increased, the ORs produced by the cohort

quarter to 5% in the 15th quarter and then goes down to 
almost 0% in the 20th quarter.

time. The top quintile has the most dramatic change from 
base level to peak while the bottom quintile barely changes.

design became very biased, with biases ranging from 90% to 
127%, while those from the trend-in-trend design remained 
close to the truth, with bias ranging from −3.5% to 3%. The 
SDs for the trend-in-trend method were one to two times as 
large as those for the cohort method, which is to be expected 
as individual-level information is partially lost when counts of 
outcomes are aggregated. Furthermore, we observed a reduc-
tion in SD for the trend-in-trend method when the number of 
strata increases from five to 10, as shown in Table 4.
APPLICATION
We applied the trend-in-trend method to Clinformat-
ics Data Mart Database (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN) 
to examine association between rofecoxib and AMI, severe 
hypoglycemia, and nonvertebral bone fracture. The University 
of Pennsylvania’s Institutional Review Board determined that 
this study met the eligibility criteria for IRB reviews exemp-
tion authorized by 45 CFR 46.101, category 4. Definitions of 
these outcomes are described in the supplementary materials 
(http://links.lww.com/EDE/B123). We first identified all per-
sons age 18 years or older in Optum who received one or more 
prescriptions for rofecoxib during the study period from April 
1, 2000 to December 30, 2004. For each rofecoxib-exposed 
person episode, we ascertained the first month and the last 
month of their continuous enrollment episode (or episodes, 
for persons with multiple enrollment episodes) during the

study period. Thus, the unit of observation was the enrollment 
episode, defined as a period of continuous enrollment for a 
person. A person could contribute multiple episodes. For each 
rofecoxib-exposed episode, we randomly sampled, without 
replacement, nine rofecoxib-unexposed enrollment episodes 
with an enrollment start date on or before no more than 1 year 
of the rofecoxib-exposed subject’s enrollment start date, and 
with an enrollment end date on or after the rofecoxib-exposed 
subject’s enrollment end date. The rationale for this criterion 
was to ensure sufficient overlap in follow-up calendar time 
for exposed and unexposed subjects. Thus, the analysis set 
contained 10 times as many total episodes as there were rofe-
coxib-exposed enrollment episodes. This was done to improve 
computational efficiency versus including the entire study 
population.
We then fit a logistic regression to estimate the cumula-
tive probability of exposure using age, sex, diagnosis of rheu-
matoid arthritis, and diagnosis of osteoarthritis as explanatory 
variables. Diagnosis codes for these variables are listed in the 
supplementary materials (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B123). 
For rofecoxib-exposed subjects, these covariates were mea-
sured at their first prescription date. For control subjects, these 
covariates were measured the same date as their correspond-
ing exposed subjects. The c statistic was 0.61, which produced 
good separation of exposure prevalence across quintiles, as 
shown in Figure 3. The estimated coefficients and SDs (as 
shown in parentheses) are 0.0228 (0.0001) for continuous age, 
0.1458 (0.0027) for female sex, 2.4418 (0.0124) for rheuma-
toid arthritis, and −0.6444 (0.0191) for osteoarthritis.
The trend-in-trend method yielded an OR (95% confi-
dence interval) for rofecoxib and AMI of 1.2 (1.1, 1.4), which 
is consistent with the results of prior epidemiologic studies: 
a 2005 meta-analysis yielded a pooled relative risk of 1.2 
(1.1, 1.3) for cohort and nested case–control studies,12 and a 
more recent meta-analysis reported a pooled relative risk of 
1.3 (1.2, 1.5).13 The ORs for the negative control outcomes, 
severe hypoglycemia and nonvertebral bone fracture (nei-
ther of which is thought to be affected by rofecoxib), were 
1.1 (0.92, 1.3) and 0.84 (0.64, 1.1), which are both consistent 
with no effect.14
DISCUSSION
We describe a novel hybrid ecologic-epidemiologic 
study design called the trend-in-trend design, provide a math-
ematical derivation of the resulting odds ratio, use simulation 
to confirm that the results are less biased (albeit somewhat 
less precise) than those of a cohort study when there is unmea-
sured confounding, and apply that method to reproduce one 
positive and two null associations using real-world data. The 
results of the empiric study using real-world data show that 
the design is readily applicable and produces expected results.
Importantly, the trend-in-trend design avoids the Achil-
les’ heel of most epidemiologic studies of healthcare interven-
tions: conflation of receiving a treatment with needing that 
treatment. Unlike cohort studies, the trend-in-trend design does 
not assume no unmeasured confounders, but instead examines 
changes in outcome occurrence as a function of changes in 
exposure prevalence across strata with differential time trends 
in exposure. Therefore, the results of a trend-in-trend study will 
be unconfounded unless there are unmeasured factors affect-
ing outcome for which there are time trends in prevalence that 
are correlated with time trends in exposure across the strata 
defined by exposure trend. This could occur if there are co-
interventions for which the trend in use is positively correlated 
with trends in use of the exposure, or alternatives for which the 
trend in use is negatively correlated with trends in use of the 
exposure. As the scenarios that would produce a confounded 
trend-in-trend estimate are a subset of those that would pro-
duce a confounded cohort estimate, the trend-in-trend design 
is more resistant to confounding. However, the trend-in-trend 
design is feasible only if there is a strong time trend in expo-
sure prevalence. Similarly, the effect estimates produced using 
calendar period as an IV will be biased if there is any time 
trend in an unmeasured causal factor, whereas a trend-in-trend 
study will be biased only if changes in the prevalence of such 
a factor are correlated with changes in exposure prevalence 
across cumulative probability of exposure strata. The trend-in-
trend design therefore relaxes the assumptions under which use 
of calendar time as an IV is valid.
The causal contrast examined by the trend-in-trend 
approach deserves discussion. It is the instantaneous effect of 
use of the exposure of interest rather than the exposure(s) (if 
any) that the increasing (or declining) trend in use of the expo-
sure of interest displaced (or was displaced by). In the example 
of rofecoxib, this is likely to be some combination of nonse-
lective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and no

treatment. Thus, the trend-in-trend results may not mimic the 
results of placebo-controlled trials evaluating the study treat-
ment. Nevertheless, the causal contrast with the alternatives 
that it displaces or is displaced by is arguably more relevant 
from a public health perspective.
The main limitations of the trend-in-trend method are 
the need for a strong trend in exposure prevalence and the 
reduced statistical precision that accompanies group-level 
rather than individual-level analyses. Limitations of the cur-
rent study include the modest range of scenarios simulated 
and the fact that there is no empirical example with a causal 
effect known with complete certainty.
Additional work is needed to improve the utility of the 
trend-in-trend design. Such work should address control for 
measured factors for which there may be time trends that are 
correlated with time trends in exposure across cumulative 
probability of exposure strata, examination of treatment effect 
heterogeneity, sequential analysis methods to allow multiple 
looks while limiting type-1 error, and estimation of statistical 
power and detectable alternative.
