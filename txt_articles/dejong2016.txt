IMPORTANCE The association between industry payments to physicians and prescribing rates
of the brand-name medications that are being promoted is controversial. In the United
States, industry payment data and Medicare prescribing records recently became publicly
available.
OBJECTIVE To study the association between physicians’receipt of industry-sponsored
meals, which account for roughly 80% of the total number of industry payments, and rates of
prescribing the promoted drug to Medicare beneficiaries.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis of industry payment data from
the federal Open Payments Program for August 1 through December 31, 2013, and prescribing
data for individual physicians from Medicare Part D, for all of 2013. Participants were
physicians who wrote Medicare prescriptions in any of 4 drug classes: statins, cardioselective
β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers
(ACE inhibitors and ARBs), and selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs). We identified physicians who received industry-sponsored
meals promoting the most-prescribed brand-name drug in each class (rosuvastatin, nebivolol,
olmesartan, and desvenlafaxine, respectively). Data analysis was performed from August 20,
2015, to December 15, 2015.
EXPOSURES Receipt of an industry-sponsored meal promoting the drug of interest.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prescribing rates of promoted drugs compared with
alternatives in the same class, after adjustment for physician prescribing volume,
demographic characteristics, specialty, and practice setting.
RESULTS A total of 279 669 physicians received 63 524 payments associated with the 4
target drugs. Ninety-five percent of payments were meals, with a mean value of less than
$20. Rosuvastatin represented 8.8% (SD, 9.9%) of statin prescriptions; nebivolol
represented 3.3% (7.4%) of cardioselective β-blocker prescriptions; olmesartan represented
1.6% (3.9%) of ACE inhibitor and ARB prescriptions; and desvenlafaxine represented 0.6%
(2.6%) of SSRI and SNRI prescriptions. Physicians who received a single meal promoting the
drug of interest had higher rates of prescribing rosuvastatin over other statins (odds ratio
[OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.17-1.18), nebivolol over other β-blockers (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.69-1.72),
olmesartan over other ACE inhibitors and ARBs (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.51-1.53), and
desvenlafaxine over other SSRIs and SNRIs (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 2.13-2.23). Receipt of additional
meals and receipt of meals costing more than $20 were associated with higher relative
prescribing rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Receipt of industry-sponsored meals was associated with an
increased rate of prescribing the brand-name medication that was being promoted. The
findings represent an association, not a cause-and-effect relationship.

P
hysician-industry relationships—including sponsored
meals and promotional speaking fees—are at the cen-
ter of an international debate, intensified by recent
transparency efforts in the United States and the European
Union.1-5 In the United States, in the last 5 months of 2013, 4.3
million industry payments totaling $3.4 billion were made to
more than 470 000 physicians and 1000 teaching hospitals.1
Although some argue that industry-sponsored meals and pay-
ments facilitate the discussion of novel treatments,6,7 others
have raised concerns about their potential to influence pre-
scribing behavior.8,9
Studies suggest that physician-industry relationships are
associated with increased prescribing of brand-name drugs.
Although most studies have relied on physician surveys10-13
or regional data,14,15 recent analyses of physician-specific pay-
ment records found a positive association between physi-
cians’receipt of industry payments and the total percentage
oftheirMedicarePartDprescriptionsthatarewrittenforbrand-
name drugs.4,16,17 These analyses, however, did not identify
the specific drug being promoted by each payment or assess
the link between promotion and prescribing of individual
drugs.Inonestudy,theassociationbetweenpaymentsandpre-
scribing was only significant among physicians who received
at least $2000 from industry.16 It is not known whether much
smallerpayments,suchassponsoredmeals,areassociatedwith
increased prescribing of the promoted brand-name drug over
therapeutic alternatives.
We linked physician data sets from the Open Payments
program and Medicare Part D to examine the association
between industry payments and prescribing rates of the
brand-name medications that were being promoted. We
focused on meals sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry,
which constitute nearly 80% of the total number of pay-
ments by drug and device manufacturers to physicians.1
Methods
Study Population
This study was approved by the institutional review board at
the University of California, San Francisco. We identified phy-
sicianswhoappearedinbothPhysicianCompare18andthe2013
Medicare Part D Prescriber file,19 which reports an end-of-year
count of each physician’
s filled prescriptions. We excluded
physicianswhosetotalnumberofbrand-nameprescriptionswas
redacted because of low claim count. From this population, we
created 4 study groups, each containing physicians who wrote
more than 20 filled prescriptions in 1 of 4 drug categories:
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors
(statins), cardioselective β-blockers without sympathomi-
metic activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE inhibitors and ARBs), and
selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake in-
hibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs). These classes are first-line treat-
ments for common conditions and have been included in pre-
viousstudiesofprescribingofbrand-namedrugs.20,21Individual
physicianscouldbeincludedinmorethan1studygroup(eTable
1 and eFigure in the Supplement).
Drugs prescribed 10 or fewer times in a calendar year are
not reported in that physician’
s Medicare prescribing record;
to ensure that this redaction—which may affect our analysis
of low-volume prescribers—did not significantly affect our re-
sults, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we in-
creased our study group inclusion threshold from 20 to 200
prescriptions in the class.
Selection of Target Drugs
We identified the most-prescribed brand-name drug in each
of the 4 drug categories in Medicare Part D in 2013. We re-
quired that each drug be patent protected through December
2014 and therefore not subject to pharmacy-level automatic
substitution laws22 or declining promotion by the manufac-
turer in the last year of patent protection.23 The resulting tar-
get drugs were rosuvastatin calcium (Crestor; AstraZeneca)
among statins, nebivolol (Bystolic; Forest Laboratories) among
cardioselective β-blockers, olmesartan medoxomil (Benicar;
Daiichi Sankyo) among ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and desven-
lafaxine succinate (Pristiq; Pfizer) among SSRIs and SNRIs.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved all
4 target drugs 5 to 11 years before the study period, and all have
generic alternatives in their class.24 There is limited, mixed,
orcontraryevidenceaboutthesuperiorityofthese4drugsover
generic alternatives,25-28 and all 4 are excluded from the na-
tional formulary for the US Department of Veterans Affairs
medical sytem.29
Measures of Industry Payments
The 2013 Open Payments database describes the value and the
drug or device being promoted for all payments to physicians
from August through December 2013, as reported by pharma-
ceuticalcompanies.Oftherecords,95%identifyaspecificdrug
or device. Group payments, such as sponsored meals, are di-
vided in value among the physicians present; when it is im-
possible to identify recipients (such as when refreshments are
offered to all attendees of an annual conference), the pay-
mentisexemptfromreporting.BecausethefirstreleaseofOpen

Key Points
Question Is the receipt of pharmaceutical industry-sponsored
meals by physicians associated with their prescribing the
promoted brand-name drug at higher rates to Medicare
beneficiaries?
Findings In this cross-sectional study of 279 669 physicians,
physicians who received a single meal promoting the drug of
interest, with a mean value of less than $20, had significantly
higher rates of prescribing rosuvastatin as compared with other
statins; nebivolol as compared with other β-blockers; olmesartan
as compared with other angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors
and angiotensin-receptor blockers; and desvenlafaxine as
compared with other selective serotonin and serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
Meaning Receipt of industry-sponsored meals was associated
with an increased rate of prescribing the promoted brand-name
medication to Medicare patients.

physician review process, we examined data from the second
release and excluded any remaining disputed payments.
We identified all target payments—defined as those pro-
moting 1 of the 4 target drugs—made to physicians in the study
groups. We included payments promoting multiple prod-
ucts. We used physician name and location to link each phy-
sician’
s payments with his or her prescription records, and ex-
cluded physicians with identical matching criteria to avoid
inadvertently matching 1 physician’
s prescribing records with
another physician’
s payment records.
The exposure of interest was industry-sponsored meals.
Because meals were often reported as multiple small food pay-
ments on the same day, our primary measure of industry con-
tact was number of days receiving a meal related to the promo-
tionofatargetdrugduringthe5-monthstudyperiod.Welimited
our regression analysis to the 91% to 99% of physicians in each
group whose only payments related to target drugs were for
meals, excluding those who received other types of payment,
such as research grants, consulting, and royalties.
Measures of Prescribing
For each physician, relative rates of prescribing a target drug
were calculated as a percentage of that physician’
s total Medi-
care Part D prescriptions in the drug category in 2013. Our pri-
mary analysis did not standardize prescriptions by quantity of
medications supplied; we conducted a sensitivity analysis in
which we standardized claims to 30-day supplies.
Covariates
We adjusted for each physician’
s specialty; sex; region; prac-
tice size; number of years since medical school graduation; ru-
ral or urban practice setting30; median household income in
zip code according to 2000 US Census data31; prescribing vol-
ume within the drug class of interest in Medicare Part D; over-
all rate of brand-name drug prescribing across all drug classes
in Medicare Part D; and percentage of prescriptions written for
low-income subsidy beneficiaries, who have limited cost shar-
ing for brand-name drugs, and Medicare Advantage benefi-
ciaries, who obtain prescriptions through a managed care
model with associated formulary differences.
Statistical Analysis
First,usingχ2testsforcategoricalvariablesand2-samplettests
for continuous variables, we tested the association between
the aforementioned covariates and receipt of industry pay-
ments. We then compared mean rates of target-drug prescrib-
ing among physicians who received meals related to target
drugs on 0 to 4 or more days during the study period. We used
Cochrane-Armitage trend tests to assess trends in prescribing
behavior between groups.
Next,usingmultivariablegroupedlogisticregressionmod-
els with binomial physician-level prescribing data, and adjust-
ing for the aforementioned covariates, we measured the as-
sociationbetweenthenumberofdaysthataphysicianreceived
meals related to target drugs and his or her prescribing rate of
the promoted drug as a proportion of prescriptions in the class.
To examine the relationship between cost per meal and
prescribing patterns, we first restricted our regression analy-
sis to physicians who received at least 1 meal and adjusted for
the mean cost per meal received by each prescriber (<$20 or
≥$20). Next, in effect modifier analyses, we assessed whether
the association between number of days receiving a meal and
prescribingofatargetdrugwasaffectedbymeancostpermeal.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis using propensity score
matching. We created a dichotomous outcome variable indi-
cating whether a physician received any target meals; calcu-
lated individual propensity scores using grouped logistic re-
gression models, with the baseline characteristics in Table 1
included as predictor variables; and reran our main regres-
sionanalysiswhilecontrollingforthedecileofpropensityscore.
To isolate the association between prescribing and pro-
motion of a specific drug, rather than general exposure to in-
dustry promotion, we conducted a falsification test. Using the
aforementioned regression methods, we assessed whether re-
ceipt of meals targeting rosuvastatin predicted desvenlafax-
ine prescribing among physicians who received no desvenla-
faxine payments, and vice versa.
Weperformedasensitivityanalysisonrosuvastatin,which
is 1 of the 2 high-intensity statins (rosuvastatin and atorva-
statin calcium) that are available in the United States and rec-
ommended in clinical guidelines for patients with clinical ath-
eroscleroticcardiovasculardiseaseorseverehyperlipidemia.32
To reduce the potential impact of case mix on our results, we
recalculated relative prescribing rates of rosuvastatin as a per-
centage of filled claims for only rosuvastatin or atorvastatin,
and reran the multivariable regression analysis.
All P values were 2-tailed, and P ≤ .05 was considered
significant. Analyses were conducted using R, version 3.1.2
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and SAS software,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
The study population included 279 669 physicians (eFigure in
theSupplement).Ofthese,155 849physicianswrotemorethan
20 prescriptions in 1 of the 4 target drug classes and were as-
signed to study groups. Characteristics of the 4 study groups
are presented in Table 1. A total of 129 675 (83%) of the sample
physicians were assigned to multiple study groups, and 88 724
(57%) were included in all 4 groups.
Across the 4 study groups, 2% to 12% of physicians
received payments promoting the target drug (Table 2). Of
63 524 payments (total value of $1.4 million) related to target
drugs, 95% were for sponsored meals, with a mean value of
$12 to $18 per meal. The remaining 5% of payments promot-
ing the target drugs included speaking fees, honoraria, travel
expenses, and education (such as providing free textbooks or
journal articles); physicians receiving these nonmeal pay-
ments were excluded from the regression analysis. Rosuvas-
tatin represented 8.8% (SD, 9.9%) of statin prescriptions;
nebivolol represented 3.3% (7.4%) of cardioselective
β-blocker prescriptions; olmesartan represented 1.6% (3.9%)
of ACE inhibitor and ARB prescriptions; and desvenlafaxine
represented 0.6% (2.6%) of SSRI and SNRI prescriptions. Phy-

comparisons, P < .001).
Characteristics of the larger study population, divided be-
tween physicians who did and did not receive industry pay-
ments of any kind (not limited to the 4 target drugs), are shown
in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Compared with physicians re-
ceiving no payments, higher proportions of those receiving
payments were men (110 143 [76%] vs 90 651 [67%]), solo prac-
titioners (32 028 [22%] vs 24 233 [18%]), and practiced in the
South(56 828[40%]vs38 335[29%]).Physiciansreceivingpay-
ments wrote fewer claims for low-income subsidy beneficia-
ries (40% vs 43%) and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries (30%
vs 33%). All characteristics were significantly associated with
receipt of payment (all comparisons, P < .001).

(OR,1.79;95%CI,1.78-1.80),olmesartan(OR,1.74;95%CI,1.73-
1.75), and desvenlafaxine (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 2.25-2.34). In fal-
sification tests (eTable 5 in the Supplement), receiving a des-
venlafaxine-related meal did not predict rosuvastatin
prescribing (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-1.00); receiving a rosu-
vastatin-relatedmealpredicteddesvenlafaxineprescribing,but
with much smaller effect sizes than desvenlafaxine-related
meals(OR,1.22;95%CI,1.20-1.24comparedwithOR,2.18;95%
CI, 2.13-2.23 for desvenlafaxine-related meals).
Our findings were unchanged when study group inclu-
sion criteria were increased from 20 to 200 prescriptions in
the class (eTable 6 in the Supplement), when claims were stan-
dardized to 30-day supplies (eTable 7 in the Supplement), and
in a sensitivity analysis of only high-intensity statins, with
slightly smaller effect sizes (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
Other physician-level predictors of target-drug prescrib-
ing (Table 3) included high brand-name drug use across all
medication classes, being in solo or small-group practice,
graduating from medical school more than 5 years ago, prac-
ticing in the South, and being a psychiatrist (for desvenlafax-
ine) or a cardiologist (for rosuvastatin and nebivolol).
Discussion
We linked 2 national data sets to quantify the association be-
tween industry payments and physician prescribing pat-
terns. We found that the receipt of industry-sponsored meals
was associated with an increased rate of prescribing the brand-
name medication that was being promoted.
As compared with the receipt of no industry-sponsored
meals, we found that receipt of a single industry-sponsored
meal, with a mean value of less than $20, was associated with
prescription of the promoted brand-name drug at signifi-
cantly higher rates to Medicare beneficiaries. The differences
persisted after controlling for prescribing volume and poten-
tial confounders such as physician specialty, practice setting,
and demographic characteristics. Furthermore, the relation-
ship was dose dependent, with additional meals and costlier
meals associated with greater increases in prescribing of the
promoted drug. Our findings were consistent across 4 brand-
name drugs, including rosuvastatin, the third-costliest drug
in Medicare Part D ($2.2 billion in federal expenditures in 2013)
after esomeprazole magnesium (Nexium) and fluticasone pro-
pionate/salmeterol (Advair Diskus).33
Our results are consistent with recent analyses that linked
federal or state-level physician payment records with Medi-
care Part D prescribing data. These studies found that indus-
try payments in general (rather than payments linked to a spe-
cific drug) were associated with an overall increase in the
prescribing of brand-name drugs.4,16,17 However, the analy-
ses did not link the promotion of specific drugs with prescrib-
ing rates for those drugs. A study of 2444 Massachusetts phy-
sicians found that for every $1000 received from industry (for
any drug), a physician’
s brand-name statin prescribing rate in-
creased by 0.1%.16 In comparison, our study found a signifi-
cant association between attending a single meal promoting
a specific drug, with a mean value of less than $20, and the pre-
scribing of the promoted drug over therapeutic alternatives.
Our findings are also consistent with smaller studies that
relied on physician self-report or institution-level data.10-13 In
single-hospital studies, exposure to sponsored meals has been
associated with increased clinic-wide use of the promoted
drug,15 choice of the promoted drug when presented with a

clinical scenario,34 and requests to add the promoted drug to
the hospital formulary.35 Marketing studies demonstrate that
industry outreach to physicians facilitates the adoption of new
drugs36; however, the content of these presentations is not ac-
tively monitored by the FDA. Industry-sponsored meals have
beenassociatedwithlearninginaccurateinformationaboutthe
sponsor’
s and competitor’
s drug37 and with increased cost of
prescribing.38
Our data are cross-sectional. The findings reflect an asso-
ciation, and not necessarily causality. Because we linked 5
months of Open Payments data with 1 year of Medicare Part D
prescription data, we also could not determine whether high
prescription rates for brand-name drugs were preceded, fol-
lowed, or temporally unrelated to the receipt of industry-
sponsored meals. The policy implications of our findings thus
depend on further clarification of the mechanism of the asso-
ciation between the receipt of industry-sponsored meals and
physician prescribing behavior. If events where industry-
sponsored meals are provided affect prescribing by inform-
ingphysiciansaboutnewevidenceandclinicalguidelines,then
the receipt of sponsored meals may benefit patient care. If phy-
sicians, however, choose to attend industry events where in-
formation is provided about drugs they already prefer, then
meals may have no affect on prescribing patterns. If, alterna-
tively, meals change physicians’prescribing practices as a re-
sultofpromotionalinfluence,eitherbyencouragingfutureuse
orrewardinganongoingpreferenceforthepromoteddrug,this
would be cause for concern.
Our findings support the importance of ongoing transpar-
ency efforts in the United States and Europe.1,3,5 Although vol-
untary guidelines from the American Medical Association and
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America al-
low meals and gifts to physicians of up to $100 in value,39,40
our findings indicate that even payments of less than $20 are
associated with different prescribing patterns. Small pay-
mentsandmealsshouldcontinuetobemonitoredintheUnited
States and should be incorporated into the European pharma-
ceutical industry’
s recent transparency initiative, which re-
quires drug companies to publicly report payments to physi-
cians with the exception of food and drinks.5
Future research could compare industry-sponsored meals
and other methods for disseminating drug information, such
asacademicdetailing41andindependentdrugbulletins,42with
respecttothecostandqualityofprescribing.Themethodsused
in this study could be applied to other payment types, to drugs
with varying degrees of generic competition and cost-
effectiveness, and to brand-name drugs that compete within
the same class.
This study has several limitations. In addition to the
cross-sectional design and timing of the data (5 months of
payment data and 12 months of prescription data), unmea-
sured confounders may bias our results. The 5 months of
Open Payments data may not be representative of a full year.
The questions that we examined should be evaluated with
alternative study designs and additional years of data. We
linked data sets using physician name and location, which
may have introduced inaccuracies despite exclusion of physi-
cians with identical matching criteria. We did not measure the
use of therapeutic alternatives from other drug classes, and
our analysis did not differentiate between new indications
and refills or adjust for physicians’patient panel size or case
mix. However, case mix is unlikely to fully explain variability
after controlling for physician- and panel-level characteristics.
In addition, our sensitivity analysis of high-intensity statins,
which was intended to make patient populations more
homogenous between physicians, was consistent with our
other findings.
Limitations of the Open Payments data include minimal
prerelease vetting by physicians,2 nonreported payments (in-
cluding free drug samples and patient education materials),
limited information about the accuracy of the data, and de-
identified and disputed payments, which were excluded. The
exemption of indirect payments with unidentifiable recipi-
ents (such as refreshments at large conferences) is a limita-
tion but improves the precision of the database as a whole by
restricting reported payments to those that can be accurately
attributed.
Conclusions
The receipt of industry-sponsored meals was associated with
an increased rate of prescribing the promoted brand-name
medication relative to alternatives within the drug class. The
findings represent an association, not a cause-and-effect
relationship.
