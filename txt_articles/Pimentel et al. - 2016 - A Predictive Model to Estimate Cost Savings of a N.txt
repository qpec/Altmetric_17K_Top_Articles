ABSTRACT
Purpose:
A
high
incidence
of
irritable
bowel
syndrome (IBS) is associated with significant medical
costs. Diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is diagnosed
on the basis of clinical presentation and diagnostic test
results and procedures that exclude other conditions.
This study was conducted to estimate the potential cost
savings of a novel IBS diagnostic blood panel that tests
for the presence of antibodies to cytolethal distending
toxin B and anti-vinculin associated with IBS-D.
Methods: A cost-minimization (CM) decision tree
model was used to compare the costs of a novel IBS
diagnostic blood panel pathway versus an exclusionary
diagnostic pathway (ie, standard of care). The probability
that patients proceed to treatment was modeled as a
function of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of
the individual biomarker tests. One-way sensitivity anal-
yses were performed for key variables, and a break-even
analysis was performed for the pretest probability of IBS-
D. Budget impact analysis of the CM model was
extrapolated to a health plan with 1 million covered lives.
Findings: The CM model (base-case) predicted
$509 cost savings for the novel IBS diagnostic blood
panel versus the exclusionary diagnostic pathway
because of the avoidance of downstream testing (eg,
colonoscopy, computed tomography scans). Sensitiv-
ity analysis indicated that an increase in both positive
likelihood ratios modestly increased cost savings.
Break-even analysis estimated that the pretest proba-
bility of disease would be 0.451 to attain cost neutral-
ity. The budget impact analysis predicted a cost
savings of $3,634,006 ($0.30 per member per month).
Implications: The novel IBS diagnostic blood panel
may yield significant cost savings by allowing patients
to proceed to treatment earlier, thereby avoiding
unnecessary testing. (Clin Ther. 2016;38:1638–

INTRODUCTION
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common relapsing
gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by abdominal
pain and discomfort, bloating, and changes in bowel
habit.1,2 IBS is the most common functional GI disorder
in the population and has a prevalence that ranges from
5% to 15%.3–8 The prevalence of IBS was 10.5% in a
large survey of patients from community-based practi-
ces,8 and a recent meta-analysis reported a pooled global
prevalence of 11.2%.7 Within the overall prevalence,
IBS is subclassified according to the predominant bowel
habit to include diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D),
constipation-predominant IBS, mixed subtype IBS, or
unclassified IBS.4 In the large survey of patients in
community-based
practices,
symptom
profiles
were
evenly divided between those patients with predominant
diarrhea (25.4%) and constipation (24.1%), with more
women than men typically affected by IBS.8

 Chronic diarrhea associated with IBS-D may also
be common among individuals with celiac disease or
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The anti-tissue
transglutaminase antibody is a reliable biomarker
selective for celiac disease9; however, differentiating
IBS from IBD relies on excluding organic disease
origins. Although the diagnosis of IBS is based on
clinical findings that meet Rome criteria (eg, Rome
III),10 these common criteria do not distinguish IBS
from IBD.11 Importantly, the process of exclusion
used for a definitive IBS-D diagnosis can be laborious,
time-consuming, and costly.12
Common diagnostic testing for IBS can include labo-
ratory tests (thyroid and liver function, C-reactive protein
[CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], celiac panel,
and complete blood cell [CBC] counts) and procedures,
such as endoscopy, hydrogen breath test, ultrasound, and/
or abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans.12
In a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with
IBS, blood tests were performed in 49% of patients,
imaging and endoscopic procedures in 47%, colon tests in
37%, and sigmoidoscopy in 18%.13 Although the current
battery of laboratory tests is useful for the differentiation
of IBD and IBS-D, none is associated with biomarkers
that have been linked to IBS-D. ESR and CRP are used to
investigate biomarkers associated with inflammation and
thereby are tests of exclusion for IBS-D.
A recent systematic review reported evidence sug-
gesting that CRP level has significant utility for the
differential diagnosis of IBS-D and IBD whereas ESR
did not. If the CRP level was r0.5, the probability
that the patient had IBD was then r1%.14 A pros-
pective study investigated the performance of several
laboratory tests for the diagnosis of IBS-D; this study
found the sensitivity and specificity of CRP to be 64%
and 92%, respectively, for the discrimination of IBS-D
and IBD.15 Including (and beyond just considering)
the costs associated with reaching a definitive diag-
nosis, the health care burden of IBS is substantial.16 It
contributes 3.5 million physician office visits, even
though a low proportion (10%–25%) of patients with
IBS seek medical treatment. According to 1 study,
annual direct and indirect costs of IBS exceed $20
billion.17
Unfortunately,
IBS
is
a
heterogeneous
disease, and, until now, there has been no reliable
biomarker (organic) that is selective for IBS.4,11
Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of
IBS by the lead author and others has helped lead to
the development of a novel IBS diagnostic blood panel
(Commonwealth Laboratories, Inc, Salem, MA).18–24
The
biomarker
consists
of
a
simple
blood
test
measurement of circulating antibodies to cytolethal
distending toxin B (anti-CdtB) and vinculin (anti-
vinculin). Studies in a postinfectious animal model
have shown that an IBS-like phenotype was produced
when host antibodies to CdtB cross-reacted with
vinculin in the host gut.25 This IBS diagnostic blood
panel was recently validated in a large study that
enrolled patients with IBS-D (n ¼ 2375), IBD (n ¼
142), or celiac disease (n ¼ 121) and healthy control
subjects (n ¼ 43).21 In that study, anti-CdtB and anti-
vinculin titers were significantly higher in patients
with IBS-D than in patients with IBD, celiac disease,
and healthy subjects (all comparisons, P o 0.001). In
that study, optimization demonstrated that for anti-
CdtB (optical density Z2.80), the sensitivity, specific-
ity, and likelihood ratio were 43.7%, 91.6%, and 5.2,
respectively. For anti-vinculin, optimization demon-
strated (optical density Z1.68) that the sensitivity,
specificity, and likelihood ratio were 32.6%, 83.8%,
and 2.0. This diagnostic test is currently available to
providers who are responsible for diagnosing and
managing patients with various GI disorders.
The IBS diagnostic blood panel may have beneficial
economic implications for the diagnosis and manage-
ment of patients suspected of having IBS-D; however,
this possibility has not been studied. Indeed, a reduction
in the time interval or number of diagnostic procedures
used from symptom presentation to treatment initiation
for a definitive IBS-D diagnosis may reduce patient
morbidity and cost burden associated with performing
a battery of exclusionary tests.26,27 The objective of
the present study, therefore, was to apply a cost-
minimization (CM) decision tree model to compare the
costs associated with 2 diagnostic pathways: the novel
IBS diagnostic blood panel pathway and the exclu-
sionary diagnostic pathway (current standard of care).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Physician Surveys
Two surveys were developed and completed by expert
gastroenterologists in the United States. The physician
characteristics are reported (see Supplemental Table I in
the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.
2016.05.003). The first survey addressed physician
characteristics, patient characteristics, patient insurance
type, distribution of patients with IBS according to
M. Pimentel et al.

 subtype, time to diagnosis, diagnostic tests, diagnostic
procedures, treatments for IBS, and the use of (or
agreement with) the Rome criteria III. Frequency of
diagnostic testing and procedure utilization was also
captured. The second survey was circulated among the
same group of physicians and addressed some of the
same variables as the first survey, albeit in a more
detailed manner. This survey also addressed the time to
diagnosis and the sequence of diagnostic testing. Both
surveys
were
analyzed
in
Microsoft
Excel
2010
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington).
CM Model
A CM model for gastroenterology practices in the
United States was constructed to compare 2 different
diagnostic strategies for IBS-D. The time horizon was not
specified; the intent of the model was to sum the health
care resources and associated costs during the diagnostic
process. The decision tree begins with patients who
present with the symptoms of “chronic diarrhea, pain
and bloating” and who do not present with alarm
symptoms. After this symptomatic presentation, there
were 2 differing strategies: the IBS diagnostic blood panel
pathway versus the “exclusionary diagnostic pathway.”
The tests for the 2 biomarkers were modeled independ-
ently; the likelihood ratios, sensitivity, and specificity of
the biomarkers were taken from the validation study.21
The exclusionary diagnostic pathway was based on a
literature review as well as expert clinical guidance; this
pathway depicts what typically happens in the diagnostic
process in an attempt to exclude other organic conditions
(eg, celiac disease or IBD). The overall decision tree
model is depicted in Figure 1A.
The exclusionary diagnostic pathway consists of 2
stages of testing (Figures 1B and 1C): a first stage that
comprises mostly laboratory tests (and 1 procedure
[upper endoscopy]), and a second stage that consists
entirely of procedures (eg, colonoscopy, CT scans,
ultrasound). The testing stages were modeled by using
“summation
nodes.”
The
probabilities
for
the
utilization of these tests and procedures were derived
from the surveys. The summation nodes allow the
probability that each test is utilized to be modeled
independently. The survey also addressed the pretest
probability that the patient population is positive for
IBS-D disease (based on symptom presentation only).
The costs for these tests and procedures were derived
from publically available sources (see Supplemental
Table II in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.
1016/j.clinthera.2016.05.003). The costs are derived
from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and
private payer sources. Only diagnostic costs were
considered for this analysis. Office visit costs were
included in the overall cost of diagnosis. The expert
clinicians advised the focus to be only on diagnostic costs
because there is no consensus on IBS-D treatment; hence,
it would be difficult to model both the diagnostic and
treatment model within the same model framework.
During the survey, the physicians were asked to specify
a time frame for diagnosing a patient with suspected IBS-
D; the responses ranged from 1 week to 6 months.
Therefore, there is no specified time frame for this
decision tree; the focus is to summarize the costs during
the diagnostic process. Because the diagnostic process
will likely conclude within 1 year, there was no dis-
counting. The decision tree was modeled in TreeAge Pro
2014 (TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA).
One of the key parameters using the CM model is
the probability that a patient will avoid further testing
after receiving the IBS diagnostic blood panel results.
Because this probability is unknown, it is modeled as
the posttest probability of IBS-D (based on the pretest
probability of disease and characteristics of the bio-
marker tests). A table of pretest and posttest probabil-
ities has been provided (see Supplemental Table III in the
online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.
2016.05.003). The posttest probability of disease is
computed by using standard equations as follows:
Post�test oddsðDþÞ¼Pre�test oddsðDþÞ
� LRðCdtBÞ � LRðvinculinÞ
½1�
Post�test PrðDþÞ¼
Post�test oddsðDþÞ
1þPost�test oddsðDþÞ
½2�
A matrix of probabilities relating the pretest and
posttest probabilities was developed. The probability that
a patient will avoid further testing after the initial
symptomatic presentation in the exclusionary diagnostic
pathway ranges from 0.0 to 0.7 (base-case, 0.2); these
values were provided by consultation with currently
practicing gastroenterologists. One-way sensitivity analy-
ses were performed for all cost and utilization variables. A
separate scenario analysis was performed in which the
posttest probability of disease is calculated by using the
formulas (formulas 1 and 2) for the posttest probability of
disease for both treatment arms.
A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was per-
formed to estimate the variability for the cost outcomes

 for each diagnostic approach. A Monte-Carlo simula-
tion was performed with 20,000 iterations. Cost
variables were modeled with log-normal distributions;
probability variables were modeled with β distributions
(see Supplemental Tables V and VI in the online version
at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2016.05.003).
The distributions were chosen to have the same
expected value as the corresponding variable probabil-
ities; the variability of the distributions was estimated
because reliable data were unavailable. A cumulative
distribution function plot summarized the differences
between the strategies.28 The cumulative distribution
function plot was prepared by using SAS version 9.2
(SAS
Institute,
Inc,
Cary,
North
Carolina).
Per
simulated iteration, the differences were defined as:
differences¼xi–yi; where xi is the simulated value for
the IBS diagnostic bloodpanel pathway and yi
is the simulated value for the exclusionary pathway
Budget Impact Analysis
A budget impact analysis was performed for a
hypothetical health plan with 1 million covered lives.
The prevalence of IBS was estimated from the medical
literature; the analysis was performed for the US
population
aged
18
to
64
years.29
The
relative
prevalence of the IBS-D subtype was derived from the
physician survey. The net impact to the health plan was
calculated by extrapolating the results of the CM model.
The analysis computes the difference in net costs for 2
scenarios: (1) 100% of eligible patients are diagnosed
with the exclusionary pathway; and (2) 50% of eligible
patients are diagnosed with the exclusionary pathway
and 50% of eligible patients are diagnosed with the IBS
diagnostic blood panel pathway. Using the net differ-
ence in costs, per-member per-month (PMPM) costs (or
savings) are computed. The published research suggests
that a significant proportion of the population with IBS
symptoms do not seek care; therefore, the budget
impact results were reported for a range of probabilities
for this variable (0.10–1.0).16 A sensitivity analysis was
performed for the budget impact analysis with respect
to the pretest probability of disease (IBS-D).
RESULTS
Survey Outcomes
Nine gastroenterologists from primarily academic
centers and with a median tenure in their current
department of at least 7 years were surveyed; survey
results are summarized in Table I. Pretest probability of
IBS-D diagnosis based on in-office symptom presenta-
tion was 0.763. According to survey results, physicians
were most likely to use celiac tests, CRP, CBC, liver
function, and colonoscopy diagnostic tests. Survey
participants were least likely to use barium enema,

 sigmoidoscopy, hydrogen breath test, and ultrasound.
The sequence of diagnostic tests was generally consis-
tent with the probability of using a diagnostic test or
procedure. Physicians were more likely to test CBC,
ESR, CRP, thyroid function, and celiac panel before
performing procedures such as a colonoscopy, ultra-
sound, enema, and sigmoidoscopy. Time to diagnosis
was generally o1 month, although some physicians
estimated a time frame up to 6 months.
CM Model Outcomes
Estimated costs of diagnostic tests and procedures
are summarized in Table I and Supplemental Table II
(given in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/
10.1016/j.clinthera.2016.05.003). Not including the
cost of the IBS diagnostic blood panel, blood diagno-
stic test costs ranged from approximately $22 for a
fecal occult blood test to $450 for a celiac test;
procedures costs ranged from $189 for small-bowel
follow-through to $2727 for a colonoscopy. The per-
visit costs of a new office visit or an established office
visit were $109.05 and $72.94, respectively.
A schematic of the CM model for the 2 diagnostic
pathways (IBS diagnostic blood panel vs exclusionary)
is shown in Figure 1A. The exclusionary diagnostic
pathway included stage 1 (early) diagnostic tests
(Figure 1B) and stage 2 procedures (Figure 1C), in
conjunction with probability of utilization. The IBS
diagnostic
blood
panel
pathway
considered
all
biomarker outcomes and included the possibility
that further testing would be likely in a patient
without a diagnosis of IBS-D. Table II provides a
summary of CM model outcomes. For this model, the
probability that a physician will send a patient to
treatment after the IBS diagnostic blood panel was set
to be the posttest probability for the patient being
IBS-D disease positive. The total expected cost in this
case was $3490. For the base-case, the probability of
sending the patient to treatment was 0.20 in the
exclusionary pathway arm. The total expected cost
according to the exclusionary pathway was $3999,
compared with $3490 for the IBS diagnostic blood
panel pathway, representing an expected cost savings
of $509. Cost savings increase inversely with the
probability that the exclusionary pathway sends pa-
tients to treatment, with potential cost savings of $735
for a probability of 0.0. Conversely, cost savings
associated with the IBS diagnostic blood panel path-
way narrow as the probability of sending a patient to
treatment increases in the exclusionary pathway arm
(Table III). The break-even for this variable occurs
when the probability of treatment in the exclusionary
pathway is equal to 0.652 (Figure 2). A summary of
stage 1 and stage 2 diagnostic costs is presented for
tests and procedure (see Supplemental Table IV in the
online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.
2016.05.003)
A sensitivity analysis was performed for the pretest
probability of disease (IBS-D) (Table IV, Figure 3).
The pretest probability of disease ranged from 0.363
to
0.963
(base-case,
0.763).
The
estimated
cost
savings increase as the pretest probability of disease
increases. The break-even for this variable occurs
when the pretest probability of disease is equal to
0.451. If the pretest probability of disease is 0.363, the
model predicts that the IBS diagnostic blood test
pathway will cost $142 more than the exclusionary
pathway. If the pretest probability of disease ranges
up to 0.963, the model predicts a cost savings of $840
for the IBS diagnostic blood panel pathway.

 The posttest probability of having IBS-D according
to pretest probability and outcomes for individual
biomarkers measured with the IBS diagnostic blood
panel are summarized in Supplemental Table III (given
in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/
j.clinthera.2016.05.003). As expected, the posttest
probability of having IBS-D is proportional to the
pretest probability and greatest when both CdtB and
vinculin are elevated (positive results). The posttest
probability of IBS-D declines when the 2 biomarkers
fail to corroborate (1 positive and 1 negative), and
IBS-D is least likely in patients negative (not elevated)
for both biomarkers.
A scenario analysis has been performed that models
the probability of IBS-D treatment as the posttest
probability
of
IBS-D
for
both
diagnostic
arms
(Table V). The cost savings for the IBS diagnostic
blood panel arm ranges from $302 to ($159). If the
pretest probability of IBS-D is equal to 0.50, the
model predicts a cost savings of $117 for the IBS
diagnostic blood panel arm.
One-way sensitivity analyses were performed for
all cost and utilization variables for both treatment
arms.
For
utilization
probabilities
and
costs,
the values ranged from �25% (probabilities were
restricted to [0, 1]). For the utilization probabilities,

 these analyses indicate which variables had the most
influence on the CM results: colonoscopy (1), CT
scan (2), endoscopy (3), celiac test (4), sigmoidoscopy
(5), and the thyroid function test (6) (see Supplemen-
tal Tables VII and VIII in the online version at http://
dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2016.05.003). For the
cost sensitivity analyses, the following variables
had the most influence on the CM results: colono-
scopy (1), endoscopy (2), CT scan (3), celiac test
(4), sigmoidoscopy (5), and the thyroid function
test (6).
One-way sensitivity analysis for IBS treatment
success with the IBS diagnostic blood panel pathway
and with the exclusionary pathway is summarized in
Figure 4. The probability of IBS treatment success was
derived from the TARGET (Targeted Non-systemic
Antibiotic Rifaximin Gut Selective Evaluation Treat-
ment of Non-constipated IBS) studies for rifaximin (ie,
41% responded to the primary end point for TAR-
GET 1/2; 72% responded to at least 1 dimension for
TARGET 3).21,30 The expected cost of the IBS
diagnostic blood panel pathway is less than that of
the exclusionary pathway for the entire range of the
variable being investigated (ie, the probability of IBS
treatment success). As the probability of IBS treatment
success increased, the cost savings associated with the
IBS diagnostic blood panel pathway increased from
$509 to $1051 per patient.
Budget Impact Analysis
A summary of the budget impact analysis for
1 million covered lives is shown in Table VI.6,29,31
In this analysis, prevalence of IBS and IBS-D were set
at 14.1%6 and 32.2%, respectively (data on file). The
proportion of patients seeking care was tested from
10% to 100%. The IBS diagnostic blood panel cost
savings per patient and annual net cost savings to plan
increase in proportion to the percentage of patients
seeking care. For the base-case, in which the pro-
bability of sending a patient to IBS-D treatment in the
exclusionary arm was 0.200 and the cost savings per
patient was predicted to be $509, the IBS diagnostic
blood panel would be estimated to save the plan a net
savings of up to $3.6 million (annually). Annual plan
cost savings surpass $7 million when 100% of the
persons meeting the criteria for IBS-D seek care.
A sensitivity analysis was performed for the budget

 The majority of simulations (95.7%) indicated a
positive cost savings associated with the IBS diagnostic
blood panel pathway. For the differences between the
simulated values for both diagnostic arms, the interval
from the 10th to the 90th percentile was (–974.31, –
99.15). The mean and SD of the simulated differences
were –502.84 and 356.66.
DISCUSSION
Symptoms of IBS adversely affect patient quality of
life, including social and psychologic aspects, and are
associated with considerable cost to the health care
system.4,16,32,33 Indeed, overutilization of diagnostic
procedures represents a growing complaint among
physicians and payers.34–36 According to recent guide-
lines
for
the
diagnosis
and
management
of
IBS issued by the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence,12 colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, ultra-
sound, thyroid testing, and other diagnostic tests are
not considered necessary to confirm a diagnosis in
individuals who meet IBS diagnostic criteria. We
also recognize that although the risks of diagnostic
testing for IBS are small, they are not insignificant.
Complications of invasive procedures, albeit infre-
quent,
may
include
risk
of
bacterial
infection,
hemorrhage, and bowel perforation.37,38 These pro-
cedures may require sedation, are sometimes painful,
and are generally unpleasant and uncomfortable for
patients. Eliminating tests and/or procedures currently
used in the diagnosis by the exclusionary pathway
may allow patients to start effective treatment earlier,
saving health care dollars in the process.

 In the current study using conservative assumptions
(base-case), we estimated that the cost savings asso-
ciated with the IBS diagnostic blood panel would be
$509 per patient (Table II). The PSA suggests that it is
highly likely (495% of simulations) that the IBS
diagnostic blood panel pathway is associated with a
cost savings greater than zero. When the cost savings
were amortized over 1 million lives, the IBS diagnostic
blood panel was estimated to save the plan a net
savings of up to approximately $3 million annually

 (Table VI). The per-patient and per-plan (annual) cost
savings reached $840 and $6.00 million, respectively,
when more optimistic assumptions for the pretest
probability of disease were tested. As expected, cost
savings associated with the IBS diagnostic blood panel
were highly dependent on the probability that a given
test result would lead to treatment in either treatment
arm. Cost savings grew in proportion to level of
“uncertainty” and “narrowed” with diagnostics that
offer greater certainty (eg, higher probability of IBS-D

 disease). When the importance (to decision-making) of
individual laboratory and procedural tests was as-
sessed, the cost of colonoscopy was the largest con-
tributor to variability in cost-effectiveness outcome.
Other diagnostics that contributed to variability in-
cluded the costs associated with CT scanning and
endoscopy.
A decision to send a patient to treatment based on
an IBS diagnostic blood panel was also affected by
individual biomarker outcomes. For example, an
absence of corroboration between anti-CdtB and
anti-vinculin results reduced the posttest probability
of sending a patient to treatment (Table III). In the
validation study, although both tests were effective in

 discriminating IBS-D from IBD, the value of anti-CdtB
was higher than that of anti-vinculin.21 This finding
was reflected in our model assumptions. From a
mathematical
perspective,
the
negative
likelihood
ratios (anti-CdtB, 0.6; anti-vinculin, 0.8) were not as
influential as the positive likelihood ratios (anti-CdtB,
5.2; anti-vinculin, 2.0). Furthermore, the possibility
that a patient who is negative for both biomarkers has
IBS-D cannot be excluded. Indeed, the posttest prob-
abilities for IBS-D remain fairly significant even when
both test results were negative, ranging from 22%
to 93%.
Cost savings were considered when the model was
extended to assess the effect of treatment for IBS-D.
Estimated cost savings increased as the probability of
treatment success increased. Because there are few
proven safe and effective agents for the treatment of
IBS-D, we derived treatment success (ie, response
rates) from the trials of rifaximin in this patient
population.30 In those
studies,
41%
of patients
randomized to undergo active treatment experienced
relief in global IBS symptoms. We recognize that, at
least in part, the absence of a number of effective
therapies may contribute to the participation rate of
patients with IBS seeking medical treatment.39 For the
analyses assessed in this study, we provided a wide
range of participation rates (ie, 10%–100%) that was
likely to contain the actual rate of patients seeking
medical attention in determining the budget impact of
IBS diagnostic blood tests. In a study of the costs
of IBS in the United States and United Kingdom,
Maxion-Bergemann
et
al16
reported
that
10%
to
25%
of
individuals
with
IBS
seek
medical
treatment.
There were some limitations to the present study.
Mean pretest probability of IBS disease based on
symptom presentation was 0.763; however, there
was a wide range of response among the surveyed
physicians, and the sample size of 9 was relatively
small. The model did not account for the small
percentage of physicians who would initiate treatment
before conducting a battery of diagnostic tests. Our
model concluded with a positive IBS-D diagnosis (for
all practical purposes, the model ended with referral
for treatment). Although potential cost savings asso-
ciated with the IBS diagnostic blood panel was
demonstrated in the model, we recognize that the
probability that a physician will send a patient to
treatment after the test outcome is unknown at this
early juncture. The additional scenario analysis (which
used the posttest probability of disease as the proba-
bility of proceeding to treatment in both arms)
predicted modest cost savings (for the IBS diagnostic
blood panel) or modest additional costs, depending on
the pretest probability of disease.
For the budget impact analysis, the proportion of
patients diagnosed with the IBS diagnostic blood
panel pathway was arbitrarily set at 50%, which
may over- or underrepresent real-world utilization.
In addition, the exclusionary pathway was estimated
conservatively. For example, we did not consider
repeated investigations (eg, multiple colonoscopies)
and the potential for more invasive studies stemming
from false-positive results of the investigations in the
exclusionary pathway. Finally, the cost of pathology
assessments was not considered in the construction of
our model.
Thus, a model to estimate the cost savings associ-
ated with a novel biomarker diagnostic blood panel
conservatively suggested that implementation will
achieve cost savings in the diagnosis of IBS-D. Other
benefits that may be realized but are more difficult to
quantify include reduced loss of productivity and
fewer days out of the office, lower risk for GI
procedure–related complications, and lower morbidity
for patients. In addition to the potential cost savings
associated
with
the IBS
diagnostic
blood panel,
integration of the blood panel into the process of care
may align with current recommendations related to
reducing the number of unnecessary diagnostic tests.12
With the exception of patients who present with
symptoms of alarm that may indicate a diagnosis of
cancer, the application of the IBS diagnostic blood
panel may result in greater efficiencies in patient
management
and
associated
cost
savings
to the
health care system.
CONCLUSIONS
As our knowledge about the pathophysiology of IBS
grows, it will be important to determine how the IBS
diagnostic blood panel is used in the real world, as
well as to assess whether the panel outcomes alter our
view of IBS as a functional disorder rather than an
organic disease. Further studies of this novel assess-
ment, and of others as they are introduced, are
warranted inasmuch as they may streamline the
management of various disorders.
