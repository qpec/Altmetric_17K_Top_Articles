Aims
To appraise the clinical and genetic evidence that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) cause atherosclerotic cardiovas-
cular disease (ASCVD).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We assessed whether the association between LDL and ASCVD fulfils the criteria for causality by evaluating the
totality of evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian randomization stud-
ies, and randomized trials of LDL-lowering therapies. In clinical studies, plasma LDL burden is usually estimated by
determination of plasma LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C). Rare genetic mutations that cause reduced LDL receptor
function lead to markedly higher LDL-C and a dose-dependent increase in the risk of ASCVD, whereas rare var-
iants leading to lower LDL-C are associated with a correspondingly lower risk of ASCVD. Separate meta-analyses
of over 200 prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials including more
than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and over 150 000 cardiovascular events
demonstrate a remarkably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of
exposure of the vasculature to LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD; and this effect appears to increase with increasing
duration of exposure to LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic studies and the randomized intervention
trials consistently demonstrate that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL particle concentration should reduce
the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of expo-
sure to lower LDL-C, provided that the achieved reduction in LDL-C is concordant with the reduction in LDL par-
ticle number and that there are no competing deleterious off-target effects.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Consistent evidence from numerous and multiple different types of clinical and genetic studies unequivocally estab-
lishes that LDL causes ASCVD.

Introduction
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and its clinical mani-
festations, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke,
are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the
world. Multiple exposures have been reported to be associated with
an increased risk of cardiovascular events.1 The most extensively
studied of these exposures by far is low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
Multiple lines of evidence have established that cholesterol-rich LDL
and other apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, including
very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and their remnants, intermedi-
ate density lipoproteins (IDL), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], are directly
implicated in the development of ASCVD.2
Despite this extensive body of evidence, however, some still
express scepticism of the causal nature of the relationship be-
tween LDL and the development of ASCVD.3 With the availability
of new, highly efficacious LDL-lowering agents and the develop-
ment of additional novel lipid-lowering agents with prolonged
duration of action, there is a need for a consensus as to whether
LDL causes ASCVD in order to inform treatment guidelines and
help shape regulatory agency guidance for the approval of new
medicines.
This Consensus Statement, the first of two that evaluates
the case for LDL causality, appraises evidence from genetic, epide-
miologic, and clinical intervention studies. The second paper dis-
cusses the evidence for LDL causality based on the current
understanding of the pathophysiology of ASCVD. While our focus
is on LDL, this does not diminish the importance of the role of
other apoB-containing lipoproteins on the development of
ASCVD nor does it exclude potential atherogenic actions of the
individual components of the lipidome and proteome of LDL be-
yond cholesterol and apoB.
Most publications that question the causal effect of LDL on the de-
velopment of ASCVD tend to cite evidence from individual studies
or a small group of highly selected studies, often without a quantita-
tive synthesis of the presented evidence.4 Therefore, to avoid this
type of selection bias, we have based our conclusions on the totality
of evidence from separate meta-analyses of genetic studies, prospect-
ive epidemiologic studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and
randomized clinical trials. This evidence base includes over 200 stud-
ies involving over 2 million participants with over 20 million person-
years of follow-up and more than 150 000 cardiovascular events.
Together these studies provide remarkably consistent and unequivo-
cal evidence that LDL causes ASCVD as summarized in Table 1.
Pathophysiology of atherosclerosis
The key events in the initiation of ASCVD are the retention and accu-
mulation of cholesterol-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins within the
arterial intima at sites of predilection for plaque formation.5–9
Notably, LDL and other apoB-containing lipoproteins <70nm in
diameter (including VLDL, their remnants, IDL, and Lp(a)) efficiently
enter and exit the arterial intima.9,10 At what is now considered
physiologically relevant levels of LDL cholesterol [LDL-C; �0.5–
1.0mmol/L (20–40mg/dL), typical of newborns11 and a wide range of
mammalian species12], the probability of LDL particle retention and
the risk of developing atherosclerosis is low.6 However, as the con-
centration of LDL-C increases above this level, the probability of in-
timal retention of LDL leading to the initiation and progressive

development of atherosclerotic plaque increases in a dose-
dependent manner.2 This topic will be discussed in detail in the se-
cond Consensus Statement on this topic.
Cholesterol, LDL, and LDL-C
The terms ‘cholesterol’, ‘LDL’, and ‘LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)’ are fre-
quently conflated or used interchangeably, potentially leading to con-
fusion. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and
a precursor of bile acids and steroid hormones. Importantly, choles-
terol of both exogenous and endogenous origin is transported to
peripheral cells largely by the apoB-containing lipoproteins in plasma.
In most people, LDL particles constitute �90% of circulating apoB-
containing lipoproteins in fasting blood (Figure 1). However, in clinical
practice, the plasma LDL level is generally not measured directly but
instead is estimated from its cholesterol concentration—LDL-C—a
measure of the total amount of cholesterol contained in LDL par-
ticles. As a result, calculated plasma LDL-C has become the focus for
assessing cardiovascular risk and for evaluating therapeutic benefit in
randomized clinical trials.
Under most conditions, LDL-C concentration and LDL particle
number are highly correlated, and therefore plasma LDL-C is a good
surrogate for LDL particle concentration. However, in certain condi-
tions (e.g. the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridae-
mia), plasma LDL-C and LDL particle concentration can become
discordant as a result of the predominance of small, dense
cholesterol-poor LDL, and therefore plasma LDL-C may not accur-
ately reflect LDL particle concentration or its effect on cardiovascular
risk. Under these conditions, direct measurement of LDL particle
number or apoB concentration (recognizing that each LDL particle
contains a single apoB molecule) may more accurately reflect the
causal effect of LDL on ASCVD. In this Consensus Statement, we as-
sess the evidence that LDL causes ASCVD by critically appraising the
clinical evidence, with the understanding that the majority of clinical
studies have used LDL-C as an estimate of LDL concentration.
Evidence from inherited disorders
of lipid metabolism
Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal co-dominant
disorder that usually results from a loss-of-function (LOF) mutation
in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, or less commonly, from LOF muta-
tions in the APOB gene that reduce the binding of apoB-containing
lipoproteins to the LDL receptor or a gain-of-function (GOF)

Summary of the evidence (references)
1. Plausibility
1
LDL and other apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins (very low-density lipoprotein their remnants,
intermediate-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein(a)) are directly implicated in the initiation and progression
of ASCVD; experimentally induced elevations in plasma LDL and other apoB-containing lipoproteins lead to
atherosclerosis in all mammalian species studied.2,5–12
2. Strength
1
Monogenic and polygenic-mediated lifelong elevations in LDL lead to markedly higher lifetime risk.13–20,27–31,40,43
3. Biological gradient
1
Monogenic lipid disorders, prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized inter-
vention trials uniformly demonstrate a dose-dependent, log-linear association between the absolute magni-
tude of exposure to LDL and risk of ASCVD13–22,27–36,38–40,42–47
4. Temporal sequence
1
Monogenic lipid disorders and Mendelian randomization studies demonstrate that exposure to elevated LDL
precedes the onset of ASCVD13–20,27–31,40,43
5. Specificity
1
Mendelian randomization studies and randomized intervention trials both provide unconfounded randomized
evidence that LDL is associated with ASCVD independent of other risk factors28,31–33,40,43
6. Consistency
1
Over 200 studies involving more than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and
more than 150 000 cardiovascular events consistently demonstrate a dose-dependent, log-linear association
between the absolute magnitude of exposure to LDL and risk of ASCVD13–22,27–36,38–40,42–47
7. Coherence
1
Monogenic lipid disorders, prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized inter-
vention trials all show a dose-dependent, log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of exposure
to LDL and risk of ASCVD15–18,21,22,28,30–32,35,36,43,44,47
8. Reduction in risk with
intervention
1
More than 30 randomized trials involving over 200 000 participants and 30 000 ASCVD events evaluating thera-
pies specifically designed to lower LDL (including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors) consistently dem-
onstrate that reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the
absolute reduction in LDL-C32–34,38,39,42,45–47
Criteria are graded by a modification of the quality criteria adopted by the European Society of Cardiology system.
For reference, see http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelinesdevelopment/Writing-ESC-Guidelines (31 January 2017).
These are defined as follows:
Class 1: Evidence and/or general agreement that the criterion for causality is fulfilled.
Class 2: Conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about whether the criterion indicated causality.
Class 3: Evidence or general agreement that the criterion for causality is not fulfilled.

mutation in the PCSK9 gene. Regardless of the underlying genetic de-
fect, FH is characterized by markedly elevated levels of LDL-C and
premature atherosclerosis, particularly coronary artery disease.13,14
In the most common form of FH, a mutation in the LDLR gene
causes decreased LDL receptor function leading to a markedly
increased concentration of circulating LDL particles and the choles-
terol carried by those particles (i.e. LDL-C). Heterozygous FH
(HeFH) affects between 1:200 and 1:300 people worldwide15,16 and
when untreated is characterized by LDL-C levels in the range of 4.5–
12mmol/L and a marked increase in risk of ASCVD.13 Homozygous
FH (HoFH) is a much rarer condition, with an extreme phenotype
characterized by untreated plasma LDL-C levels often in excess of
13mmol/L from birth and almost universal development of ASCVD
in childhood or early adolescence.14 Although the phenotypic ex-
pression of FH is variable, the extent of atherosclerosis and the risk
of cardiovascular events in both HeFH and HoFH is proportional to
both the absolute magnitude and the duration of exposure to ele-
vated LDL-C levels.15,17,18
Within any affected family, each child has an equal and random 50%
probability of inheriting a mutation that causes FH. The fact that siblings
who inherit an FH mutation have markedly elevated plasma LDL-C lev-
els and a corresponding dose-dependent markedly elevated lifetime
risk of ASCVD as compared to their unaffected siblings provides
powerful evidence that LDL causes ASCVD.19 This conclusion is sub-
stantially strengthened by the complementary observations that GOF
mutations in PCSK9 result in a markedly elevated LDL-C concentration
and a corresponding markedly elevated risk of ASCVD, while LOF mu-
tations in PCSK9 result in a lower LDL-C concentration and a corres-
ponding markedly lower lifetime risk of ASCVD.20
Evidence from prospective
epidemiologic studies
Several large meta-analyses of prospective observational epidemio-
logic studies using individual participant data have consistently re-
ported a continuous log-linear association between the absolute
magnitude of exposure to plasma LDL-C levels and the risk of
ASCVD.
The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) reported the re-
sults of a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 302 430
persons without prevalent vascular disease at the time of enrolment
in 68 prospective studies during which 8857 non-fatal MI and 928
coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths accrued over 2.79 million
person-years of follow-up.21 In these studies, plasma LDL-C concen-
tration was log-linearly associated with increased risk of non-fatal MI
or CHD death. Although the authors reported the association be-
tween non-HDL-C concentration and risk of CHD in the primary
analysis, all studies included in this meta-analysis measured total chol-
esterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycer-
ides and reported the calculated LDL-C concentration as estimated
by the Friedewald equation. The ERFC authors point out that any re-
gression model that includes terms for non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and tri-
glycerides is a simple mathematical rearrangement of a model that
includes terms for calculated LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides.
Therefore, in the ERFC analysis, the effect of LDL-C is exactly equal
to the effect of non-HDL-C on the risk of CHD by definition in the
analysis. The authors confirmed this fact by demonstrating that in a
subsample of 8 studies involving 44 234 individuals, the effect of dir-
ectly measured LDL-C on the risk of CHD was nearly identical to the
effect of non-HDL-C (and calculated LDL-C) per millimole per litre.
Similarly, the Prospective Studies Collaboration reported a meta-
analysis of individual participant data on 892 337 persons without
cardiovascular disease at baseline who had been enrolled in 61 pro-
spective cohort studies during which 33 744 ischaemic heart disease
deaths accrued over nearly 12 million person-years of follow-up. This
meta-analysis reported a strong, graded log-linear association be-
tween total plasma cholesterol and the risk of ischaemic heart disease
mortality.22 Importantly, in a subsample of 153 798 participants for
whom HDL-C measurements were available, the effect of non-HDL-
C on the risk of ischaemic heart disease mortality was nearly identical
to the effect of total cholesterol per millimole per litre.
Together, these meta-analyses of prospective epidemiologic cohort
studies provide coherent and consistent evidence that plasma LDL-C
concentration is strongly and log-linearly associated with a dose-
dependent increase in the risk of incident ASCVD events (Figure 2).
Evidence from Mendelian
randomization studies
Although the association between LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD is
strong, graded, and reproducible in meta-analyses of prospective co-
hort studies, these studies are not randomized and are therefore un-
avoidably vulnerable to confounding, reverse causation, and other
forms of bias. Mendelian randomization studies introduce a random-
ization scheme into an observational study specifically to assess
Figure 1 Relative concentration of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) con-
tained in circulating lipoproteins in normolipidaemic individuals.
ApoB content was calculated in nanomoles per litre using 500 000
as the defined molecular mass [i.e. low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
100 mg/dL or 2000nmol/L, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) rem-
nants 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L and lipoprotein(a) 10nmol/l*]. *Based

whether an observed association between an exposure and an out-
come is likely to be causal.23
Numerous variants in multiple genes have been reported to be
associated with lower LDL-C levels.24,25 Each of these variants is in-
herited approximately randomly at the time of conception in a pro-
cess sometimes referred to as Mendelian randomization. Therefore,
inheriting an LDL-C lowering allele in one of these genes is analogous
to being randomly allocated to treatment with an LDL-C-lowering
therapy, while inheriting the other allele is analogous to being ran-
domly allocated to ‘usual care’. If the variant under study is associated
solely with LDL-C and not with other lipid or non-lipid pleiotropic ef-
fects, and if allocation is indeed random, then comparing the risk of
ASCVD among persons with and without such a variant should pro-
vide an unconfounded estimate of the causal effect of lower LDL-C
levels on the risk of ASCVD in a manner analogous to a long-term
randomized trial.26
Mendelian randomization studies have consistently demonstrated
that variants in over 50 genes that are associated with lower LDL-C
levels (but not with other potential predictors or intermediates for
ASCVD) are also associated with a correspondingly lower risk of
Figure 2 Log-linear association per unit change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the risk of cardiovascular disease as reported
in meta-analyses of Mendelian randomization studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, and randomized trials. The increasingly steeper slope
of the log-linear association with increasing length of follow-up time implies that LDL-C has both a causal and a cumulative effect on the risk of cardio-
vascular disease. The proportional risk reduction (y axis) is calculated as 1-relative risk (as estimated by the odds ratio in Mendelian randomization
studies, or the hazard ration in the prospective epidemiologic studies and randomized trials) on the log scale, then exponentiated and converted to a

CHD,20,27–30 thus providing powerful evidence that LDL is causally
associated with the risk of CHD. Indeed, when the effect of each
LDL-C variant is plotted against its effect on CHD, there is a continu-
ous, dose-dependent, and log-linear causal association between the
magnitude of the absolute change in LDL-C level and the lifetime risk
of CHD (Figure 2).28,30
Furthermore, when adjusted for a standard decrement in LDL-
C, each of the genetic variants associated with LDL-C has a re-
markably similar effect on the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C,
including variants in the genes that encode the targets of pharma-
cological agents commonly used to lower LDL-C [i.e. 3-hydroxy-
3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the target of
statins;
Niemann-Pick
C1-like
1
(NPC1L1),
the
target
of
ezetimibe; and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9), the target of the monoclonal antibodies alirocumab and
evolocumab; see Figure 3], with no evidence of any heterogeneity
of effect (I2 = 0%).28,30,31 This observation strongly implies that
the causal effect of these variants on the risk of CHD is mediated
essentially entirely through LDL, because it would be implausible
that variants in numerous different genes involving multiple dis-
tinct biological pathways by which LDL is lowered would each
have directionally concordant and quantitatively similar pleio-
tropic effects on the risk of ASCVD.
Taken together, meta-analyses of Mendelian randomization studies
involving more than 300 000 participants and 80 000 CHD cases pro-
vide compelling evidence that LDL is causally associated with the risk
of ASCVD and that the causal effect of LDL on ASCVD is largely in-
dependent of the mechanism by which LDL is ‘lowered’.
Figure 3 Effect of exposure to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by mechanism of LDL-C lowering. Panel A shows the effect of
genetic variants or genetic scores combining multiple variants in the genes that encode for the targets of currently available LDL-C-lowering thera-
pies, adjusted for a standard decrement of 0.35mmol/L lower LDL-C, in comparison with the effect of lower LDL-C mediated by variants in the LDL
receptor gene. Panel B shows the effect of currently available therapies that act to primarily lower LDL-C through the LDL receptor pathway, ad-
justed per millimole per litre lower LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic data in Panel A and the data from randomized trials in Panel B sug-
gest that the effect of LDL-C on the risk of cardiovascular events is approximately the same per unit change in LDL-C for any mechanism that lowers
LDL-C via up-regulation of the LDL receptor where the change in LDL-C (which is used in clinical medicine to estimate the change in LDL particle
concentration) is likely to be concordant with changes in LDL particle concentration.

Evidence from randomized
controlled trials
Perhaps the most compelling clinical evidence for causality is pro-
vided by randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of therapies
that reduce LDL-C on the risk of cardiovascular events. (For refer-
ence, Figure 4 shows the principal sites of action of therapeutic inter-
ventions that act mainly to lower LDL.) It is important to note,
however, that the interpretation of any given individual trial can be
substantially affected by its design. In general, studies that are under-
powered due to small sample sizes or few accrued events, that do
not produce a substantial difference in LDL-C concentration be-
tween treatment arms, and those with short-term follow-up (2 years
or less) are more likely to produce results that do not show statistic-
ally significant differences. Furthermore, some therapies that lower
LDL-C (e.g. oestrogen) also have adverse effects that increase the
risk of ASCVD which can attenuate or erase the clinical benefit of
lowering LDL-C. Over-interpretation of these individual trials may
lead to biased conclusions. For that reason, we focus on the totality
of the evidence derived from meta-analyses of randomized trials.
In a meta-analysis of individual-participant data from 26 statin trials
including almost 170 000 individuals, treatment with a statin was asso-
ciated with a log-linear 22% proportional reduction in the risk of
major cardiovascular events per millimole per litre reduction in LDL-
C over a median of 5 years of treatment.32 The effect was some-
what less during the first year of treatment, followed by a consistent
22-24% proportional reduction in cardiovascular events per milli-
mole per litre reduction in LDL-C during each subsequent year of
treatment.33 The magnitude of this effect was independent of base-
line LDL-C level, similar among persons with and without pre-
existing cardiovascular disease at baseline, and remarkably consistent
in all subgroups studied.32,33 This meta-analysis therefore provides
powerful evidence that reducing plasma LDL-C levels by inhibiting
HMG-CoA reductase with a statin leads to dose-dependent reduc-
tion in the risk of major cardiovascular events that is proportional to
the absolute magnitude of the reduction in LDL-C (Figure 2).
Notably, in the statin trials, the absolute yearly event rate observed
in each randomized treatment arm was strongly and linearly associ-
ated with the absolute achieved LDL-C level (Figure 5A).34 In these
studies, LDL-C and apoB concentrations had very similar effects on
the risk of cardiovascular events per millimole per litre, thus confirm-
ing that LDL-C is a satisfactory surrogate for LDL particle number
under most circumstances. Furthermore, intravascular ultrasound
studies of coronary atherosclerosis involving statin-treated patients
have consistently demonstrated that progression of coronary athero-
sclerotic plaque volume can be substantially arrested at achieved
LDL-C levels of �1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) (Figure 5B).35,36
Importantly, other therapies that reduce LDL-C without inhibiting
HMG-CoA reductase have also been shown to reduce the risk of
cardiovascular events in large randomized cardiovascular outcome
trials. Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol by bind-
ing to the NPC1L1 transporter protein.37 Among the 18 144 persons
with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the IMPROVE-IT trial,
treatment with ezetimibe plus a statin vs. statin monotherapy
reduced LDL-C levels by 0.40 mmol/L over the trial duration, and
was associated with a 6.5% proportional reduction in major cardio-
vascular events.38 Supportive evidence is available from the SHARP
Figure 4 Schematic figure showing that all therapies that act predominantly to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) act via the LDL receptor path-
way to up-regulate LDL receptors and thus increase LDL clearance.

trial in 9270 persons with chronic kidney disease, which compared
treatment with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe with
placebo.
Combination
treatment
reduced
LDL-C
levels
by
0.85mmol/L (33 mg/dL) and reduced the incidence of major cardio-
vascular events by 17% relative to placebo.39 In both trials, the magni-
tude of the observed proportional risk reduction was consistent with
the clinical benefit that would be expected from similar absolute re-
ductions in LDL-C during treatment with statin monotherapy. These
data suggest that statins and ezetimibe have therapeutically equivalent
effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per unit lower LDL-C
(Figure 3B). These findings also agree closely with the naturally
randomized genetic data that have demonstrated that variants in the
HMGCR and NPC1L1 genes have biologically equivalent effects on the
risk of cardiovascular disease per unit lower LDL-C31,40 (Figure 3A).
In addition, among 27,564 participants with cardiovascular disease
enrolled in the recently reported FOURIER trial, treatment with the
PCSK9 monoclonal antibody evolocumab added to a statin reduced
LDL-C by 1.4mmol/L (53.4 mg/dl) to a mean LDL-C level of
0.78mmol/L (30 mg/dl) and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular
death, MI or stroke by 20% during a median of 2.2 years of follow-
up.41,42 When analysed by each year of treatment, evolocumab had
nearly identical effects on the risk of multiple different cardiovascular
endpoints per millimole per litre reduction in LDL-C compared to
treatment with a statin as reported by the Cholesterol Treatment
Trialists Collaboration.31 The results of this trial are remarkably con-
sistent with the results of a recent Mendelian randomization study
that showed that variants in the PCSK9 and HMGCR genes have nearly
identical effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per unit lower
LDL-C, and therefore accurately predicted that PCSK9 inhibitors
would reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by approximately the
same amount as statins per unit reduction in LDL-C.43 The results of
the FOURIER trial are also consistent with the results of the recent
GLAGOV trial in which treatment with evolocumab added to a statin
reduced LDL-C levels by 1.45 mmol/L and induced plaque regression
that appeared to be directly proportional to the achieved absolute
LDL-C level, even at LDL-C levels as low as 0.95 mmol/L (36.6 mg/
dl).44 Taken together, the results of these studies strongly suggest
that PCSK9 inhibitors and statins have biologically equivalent effects
on the risk of cardiovascular events per unit change in LDL-C.
Furthermore, in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary
Prevention Trial, treatment with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyr-
amine reduced LDL-C by 0.7 mmol/L and reduced the relative risk of
cardiovascular death or MI by 19%.45 Similarly, in the Program on
Surgical Control of Hyperlipidemia (POSCH) study, ileal bypass sur-
gery reduced LDL-C by 1.85 mmol/L and reduced the relative risk of
cardiovascular death or MI by 35%.46 In both trials, the observed risk
reduction was consistent with the proportional risk reduction per
unit lower LDL-C observed during treatment with a statin or with
combined statin and ezetimibe therapy (Figure 2). Indeed, in a recent
meta-analysis of 49 studies including 312 175 participants and 39 645
major vascular events that compared the effects of 9 different types
of lipid-lowering therapies, nearly all of these therapeutic approaches
to lowering LDL-C were associated with a consistent 20–25% pro-
portional reduction in vascular events per millimole per litre reduc-
tion in LDL-C.47 These findings are in line with those from the
Mendelian randomization studies and demonstrate that the clinical
benefit of lowering LDL-C appears to be independent of the mechan-
ism by which LDL-C is lowered (Figure 3).
The one notable exception to this finding is the effect of the cho-
lesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors. In the recently re-
ported ACCELERATE Trial, the CETP inhibitor evacetrapib plus a
statin reduced LDL-C by 0.75 mmol/L compared with statin mono-
therapy but did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.48 To
date, we lack a mechanistic explanation for this finding, although dele-
terious effects on CHD due to a 1.5mmHg mean increase in systolic
blood pressure and/or possible dysfunctional HDL phenotypes on
evacetrapib may constitute contributory factors. In addition, the LDL
particle-lowering effect of CETP inhibitors appears to become atte-
nuated when a CETP inhibitor is added to a statin, thus leading to dis-
cordance between the measured LDL-C and apoB reductions.48 The
ongoing 30 000-person REVEAL trial with the CETP inhibitor anace-
trapib will provide more definitive evidence of the effect of adding a
CETP inhibitor to a statin on the risk of cardiovascular events.
Criteria for causality
A critical appraisal of the evidence discussed in this review demon-
strates that the association between plasma LDL-C concentration
and the risk of ASCVD satisfies all the criteria for causality (Table 1).49
Indeed, the prospective epidemiologic studies, Mendelian randomiza-
tion studies, and randomized intervention trials all demonstrate a re-
markably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between
the absolute magnitude of exposure to LDL-C and the risk of
ASCVD, and together demonstrate that the effect of LDL-C on the
risk of ASCVD increases with increasing duration of exposure (Figure
2). This concordance between multiple lines of evidence, most not-
ably the remarkable concordance between the unbiased naturally
randomized genetic data and the results of numerous randomized
intervention trials using multiple different agents to reduce LDL-C,
provides overwhelming clinical evidence that LDL causes ASCVD and
that lowering LDL reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.
Evidence for the cumulative effect
of exposure to LDL on ASCVD
Mendelian randomization studies suggest that long-term exposure to
lower LDL-C is associated with up to a three-fold greater proportional
reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease per unit reduction in LDL-
C, when compared with shorter term treatment with a statin started
later in life after atherosclerosis has developed.28 This finding suggests
that the causal effect of LDL on the risk of ASCVD is determined by
both the absolute magnitude and the cumulative duration of exposure
to LDL-C. This finding is consistent with increasing benefit observed
over time in the long-term follow-up of the WOSCOPS trial.50
Because the effect of LDL-C on the risk of ASCVD appears to be
both causal and cumulative over time, lowering the plasma LDL-C
level earlier than is currently recommended, may result in propor-
tionally greater reductions in the lifetime risk of ASCVD than which
is estimated in short-term randomized trials. Integrating the available
evidence from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized tri-
als suggests that each millimole per litre reduction in LDL-C reduces

the relative risk of ASCVD events by �10% during the first year of
treatment, by �16% after 2 years of treatment and by �20% after 3
years of treatment, presumably related to the stabilization of any
existing underlying plaque burden.33 Each subsequent year of treat-
ment after the third might then be expected to result in a further
1.5% proportional reduction in ASCVD events per millimole per litre
per year (Tables 2–4). Therefore, 5 years of treatment with a lipid-
lowering agent should reduce the relative risk of ASCVD by �20–
25% per millimole per litre reduction in LDL-C, while 40 years of
treatment (or approximately equivalently 40 years of exposure to
lower LDL-C) would be expected to reduce ASCVD events by
�50–55% per millimole per litre lower LDL-C (Figure 2).
Recommendations for treatment
The evidence clearly indicates that reducing LDL-C by increasing the
numbers of hepatic LDL receptors can reduce ASCVD (Figure 4).
Because reducing LDL-C should have a constant effect on the risk of
ASCVD per unit absolute reduction in LDL-C, and because LDL-C
has both a causal and a cumulative effect on the risk of ASCVD, the
proportional reduction in risk that a person can expect from reduc-
ing LDL-C will depend on their baseline LDL-C level, the absolute
magnitude of the reduction in LDL-C, and the duration of therapy.
Similarly, the absolute risk reduction that a person can expect from
reducing LDL-C will depend on their baseline risk of ASCVD, base-
line LDL-C level, the absolute magnitude of the reduction in LDL-C,
and the duration of LDL-C-lowering therapy.
Tables 2–4 provide estimates of the potential clinical benefit that
can be achieved by lowering plasma LDL-C concentration based on a
person’s baseline risk of ASCVD, baseline LDL-C, and the duration
of lipid-lowering therapy, expressed as both expected proportional
and absolute risk reductions. Physicians can use this information to
discuss with their patients about the potential benefits of lowering
LDL-C based on the causal effect of LDL on the risk of ASCVD.
Impact of other exposures on the
casual effect of LDL on ASCVD
In addition to LDL, multiple other exposures have been reported
to be associated with the risk of ASCVD including elevated sys-
tolic blood pressure, diabetes, and tobacco smoking.1 Both the
Mendelian randomization studies and the meta-analyses of
randomized trials demonstrate that changes in LDL-C have a very
consistent proportional effect on the risk of ASCVD across differ-
ent levels of various risk factors. As a result, a given absolute re-
duction in LDL-C is associated with the same proportional
reduction in the risk of ASCVD, regardless of the presence or ab-
sence of other risk factors. However, because persons with more
risk factors have a higher absolute rate of ASCVD in comparison
with persons with fewer risk factors, the constant proportional
reduction in risk per millimole per litre reduction in LDL-C will
translate into greater absolute risk reductions for persons with
increasing numbers of risk factors or among persons who are at a
higher risk of cardiovascular disease more generally.

Recommendations for treatment: expected clinical benefit per unit reduction in LDL-C. The proportional reduction in long-term risk is based on an expected 54% reduction in risk per
millimole per litre reduction in LDL-C over 40 years of exposure as estimated from Mendelian randomization studies and is calculated as [(1-0.46 (absolute reduction in LDL-C in mmol/L))�100].
The absolute risk reduction is calculated as [ARR = Column 1 - Column 5], and the number needed to treat is calculated as [(1� ARR) � 100].

Finally, an important area for future research is to identify persons
who are most likely to benefit from LDL-C-lowering therapies. The
probability that LDL will be retained within the arterial intima leading
to the development and growth of atherosclerotic plaque increases
with increasing concentration of circulating LDL particles.6 Because
retention of LDL particles is a probabilistic event, one would expect,
therefore, that people with similar LDL-C level will have a distribu-
tion of underlying atherosclerotic plaque burdens. Genetic factors
may influence whether a person is more or less likely to retain LDL-
C within the arterial intima or influence the degree to which reten-
tion of LDL particles triggers the inflammatory process or oxidative
changes that influence the rate of plaque growth and the propensity
for plaque disruption.
Indeed, many of the genetic variants most strongly associated with
ASCVD in GWAS are in genes that encode for components of the
arterial wall, which may modify susceptibility to retaining LDL or
modify responses to the accumulated LDL within the artery wall.27
This hypothesis is consistent with the results of a meta-analysis of sta-
tin trials that reported that persons with the highest tertile of a gen-
etic ASCVD risk score derived a greater proportional reduction in
the risk of cardiovascular events per millimole per litre reduction in
LDL-C than did persons with the lowest tertile of the genetic risk
score.53 The genetic score used in this study may have included vari-
ants that lead to a greater susceptibility to retain LDL particles.
Identifying genetic and other factors that influence the likelihood of
retaining LDL particles within the intima is an active area of ongoing
research and may eventually help to personalize the prevention of
cardiovascular disease by identifying persons who are most vulner-
able to the deleterious effects of LDL-C and therefore are most likely
to benefit from therapies that lower LDL-C.
Conclusions
Considered together, the strong and consistent evidence from the
genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian
randomization studies, and randomized intervention trials discussed
here, supported by mechanistic evidence to be presented in the se-
cond Consensus Statement on LDL causality, establishes that LDL is
not merely a biomarker of increased risk but a causal factor in the
pathophysiology of ASCVD. The key implications for this conclusion
are presented in Box 1.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as a causal
factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease:
key implications
• Cumulative LDL arterial burden is a central determinant for the
initiation and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
• The lower the LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level attained by agents
that primarily target LDL receptors, the greater the clinical benefit
accrued.
• Both proportional (relative) risk reduction and absolute risk reduc-
tion relate to the magnitude of LDL-C reduction.
• Lowering LDL-C in individuals at high cardiovascular risk earlier ra-
ther than later appears advisable, especially in those with familial
hypercholesterolaemia.
