BACKGROUND: Soy foods possess both antiestrogenic and estrogen-like properties. It remains controversial whether women diag-
nosed with breast cancer should be advised to eat more or less soy foods, especially for those who receive hormone therapies as
part of cancer treatment. METHODS: The association of dietary intake of isoflavone, the major phytoestrogen in soy, with all-cause
mortality was examined in 6235 women with breast cancer enrolled in the Breast Cancer Family Registry. Dietary intake was assessed
using a Food Frequency Questionnaire developed for the Hawaii-Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort among 5178 women who reported
prediagnosis diet and 1664 women who reported postdiagnosis diet. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 113 months (approximately 9.4 years), 1224
deaths were documented. A 21% decrease was observed in all-cause mortality for women who had the highest versus lowest quartile
of dietary isoflavone intake (�1.5 vs < 0.3 mg daily: HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval CI, 0.64-0.97; Ptrend 5 .01). Lower mortality asso-
ciated with higher intake was limited to women who had tumors that were negative for hormone receptors (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-
0.83; Ptrend 5 .005) and those who did not receive hormone therapy for their breast cancer (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91; Ptrend 5 .02).
Interactions, however, did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, ethnically diverse cohort of women with
breast cancer living in North America, a higher dietary intake of isoflavone was associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
It has been suggested that isoflavone inhibits the development of breast cancer by decreasing estrogen production, inhibit-
ing cell proliferation, and reducing reactive oxygen species production.1 However, isoflavone is also known for its estro-
genic activity by binding and activating estrogen receptors (ERs) in breast tumors,1 which may interfere with tamoxifen
therapy by reducing its treatment effect. It remains controversial whether women should be advised to avoid or to increase
their intake of food products or supplements that contain isoflavone to reduce breast cancer risk or progression.2,3
Only a few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the association between intake of soy foods or dietary isoflavone, ei-
ther before or after cancer diagnosis, and survival in women with breast cancer.4 Although several lines of evidence indicate
a reduced risk of mortality or recurrence associated with increasing soy consumption in Chinese women,5-7 the evidence is
still very limited for women living in Western countries, where soy product consumption is much lower than in Asian
countries. In Western countries, the intake of soy products varies by race/ethnicity.8 It remains unclear whether dietary
isoflavone intake is associated with different mortality rates among Caucasian, Hispanic, African American, and Asian
American women living in the United States. Studies are needed to further quantify whether associations between dietary
isoflavone intake and survival vary by tumor hormone receptor status and by receipt of hormone therapy for the treatment
of breast cancer. These analyses will contribute to the evidence base for developing targeted dietary recommendations for

 breast cancer survivors. The current study examined the
association between dietary intake of isoflavone and all-
cause mortality in a multiethnic cohort of women diag-
nosed with breast cancer living in the United States and
Canada and assessed whether the associations differ by
race/ethnicity, tumor hormone receptor status, and re-
ceipt of hormone therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) is an interna-
tional research infrastructure that was established in 1995,
with 6 participating sites from the United States, Canada,
and Australia that recruited breast cancer families either
through population-based cancer registries (population-
based families) or cancer clinics and community outreach
(clinic-based families).9 Population-based families were
recruited through incident breast cancer cases identified
by the regional cancer registries in the greater San Fran-
cisco Bay area, the province of Ontario, Canada, and the
metropolitan areas of Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.
Clinic-based families were recruited from the local popu-
lations in New York City, Philadelphia, Utah, Ontario,
and
Melbourne/Sydney.
The
first
family
member
recruited into the BCFR is referred to as the proband, re-
gardless of breast cancer status. Population-based pro-
bands were sampled according to site-specific criteria
based on sex, race/ethnicity, family history, and age at di-
agnosis. Permission was sought from the probands to con-
tact eligible family members. Between 1996 and 2011,
more than 13,000 families were recruited and followed
prospectively. Because a different food frequency ques-
tionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary intake in Aus-
tralia, the current analysis only includes women from the
5 North American BCFR sites who completed the same
FFQ at baseline and is limited to women who were diag-
nosed with a first primary, invasive breast cancer
(n 5 7471). We further excluded 588 women who died
within the first year after the baseline questionnaire to
minimize the impact of reverse causation. The remaining
6883 women included 5279 (77%) population-based
probands (5105 women enrolled in the BCFR as affected
probands and 174 enrolled as unaffected relatives who
were diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up) and
1604 women (23%) from the clinic-based BCFR sites
(1471 women enrolled with breast cancer and 133 en-
rolled as unaffected relatives who developed breast cancer
during follow-up).
At enrollment into the BCFR, probands completed
a detailed questionnaire on family history of cancer in
first-degree and higher degree relatives. All participants
completed a structured questionnaire on menstrual and
reproductive histories, hormone use, physical activity, al-
cohol drinking, cigarette smoking, height and weight, as
well as a fan FFQ (see below). For women diagnosed with
breast cancer, self-reported information on treatment was
collected by questionnaire, and information on tumor
characteristics (ie, tumor size, number of affected lymph
nodes, grade, histology, and ER and progesterone recep-
tor [PR] status) was abstracted from pathology reports or
obtained from cancer registry records. The population-
based probands reported on their exposures and dietary
intake up to or during the year before diagnosis. All other
women reported on their exposures and dietary intake up
to or during the year before enrollment.
Self-reported weight and height were used to calcu-
late body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m2) and were classified
as
normal
weight
(BMI < 25 kg/m2),
overweight
(BMI 5 25-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI � 30 kg/m2).
Minutes per week of recent recreational physical activity
(ie, during the 3 years before diagnosis for population-
based probands or before enrollment for all others) were
calculated by summarizing moderate and vigorous physi-
cal activities (MVPAs), which are reported as hours per
week and months per year, and by weighting vigorous
physical activity at 1.67 minutes for each minute of activi-
ty. A binary variable (active vs inactive) was created to re-
flect whether a women’s MVPAs met the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s physical activity guide-
lines for Americans (�150 minutes per week).10 Usual al-
cohol consumption was self-reported in drinks per week
consumed before diagnosis (population-based probands)
or enrollment (all others) and categorized as nondrinkers,
<7 drinks per week, or �7 drinks per week. Smokers
were defined as women who reported smoking at least 1
cigarette a day for 3 months or longer. Cigarette smoking
status was defined as never, former, or current. Pack-years
of smoking were calculated using smoking intensity
(packs per day) multiplied by duration (years smoked).
Dietary Assessment
Dietary intake data were collected at enrollment using a
self-administered FFQ, which was developed for the
Hawaii-Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort to assess dietary
intake in a racially/ethnically diverse population. It was
previously validated with repeated 24-hour diet recalls
and demonstrated high correlations for most food groups
and nutrients.11 The FFQ asked study participants about
Soy and Breast Cancer Survival/Zhang et al
Cancer

2071
 their usual dietary intake of 108 food items and assessed
frequency of consumption (never or hardly ever, once a
month, 2-3 times a month, once a week, 2-3 times a week,
4-6 times a week, once a day, and �2 times a day) and
portion size (3 categories).
There were 6883 women who completed the FFQ
at baseline and were alive within the first year of complet-
ing the FFQ. From these, we excluded 55 women with
potentially unreliable reporting of dietary intake, defined
as total caloric intake exceeding 3 standard deviations
above or below the mean value of the natural log-
transformed caloric intake in the study population. We
also excluded 459 population-based probands who com-
pleted the FFQ more than 5 years after diagnosis to reduce
error associated with recalling more distant dietary intake.
For all other women, we excluded 134 who reported their
dietary intake more than 5 years before diagnosis; and, of
the remaining 6235 women, 4769 reported on their die-
tary intake within 5 years before breast cancer diagnosis
(ie, prediagnosis diet), and 1466 reported on their dietary
intake within 5 years after diagnosis (ie, postdiagnosis
diet).
Survival Outcomes
Vital status of women was ascertained through several
follow-up activities to ensure completeness, including an-
nual telephone contacts or mailed questionnaires with
probands or family members, linkage to cancer registry
and death registry records, and review of medical records
or contact with physicians’ offices. Causes of death were
not available for these analyses.
Statistical Analyses
We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models
to evaluate the association between dietary isoflavone in-
take and all-cause mortality. Days since diagnosis was
used as the time scale, with follow-up time left-truncated
at the date of interview to minimize potential survival
bias. Individuals were censored at the date of either death
or last contact. The rate ratio of all-cause mortality was es-
timated as the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence in-
terval (CI). All models were adjusted for age, study site,
and total caloric intake. Next, we examined a predefined
list of additional confounders and adjusted for variables
that altered the parameter estimates by greater than 10%,
including race/ethnicity, education, total fiber intake,
Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, treatment type, recent
recreational physical activity, BMI, usual alcohol con-
sumption, and cigarette smoking status. A binary variable
(yes vs no) was created for each treatment type (surgery,
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy)
based on self-reported treatment. The HEI-2010 was cal-
culated using the methods provided by the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture and measures the overall diet quality
by assessing adherence to the 2010 dietary guidelines for
Americans.12,13 The total HEI-2010 score ranges from 0
(nonadherence) to 100 (perfect adherence), with higher
scores indicating better adherence to the dietary guide-
lines. Wald tests for trend were used to evaluate associa-
tions
with
increasing
dietary
intake
of
isoflavone
categorized as quartiles based on the intake of all women.
We first performed the analysis in all 6235 women
for total isoflavone intake and specific types of isoflavone
(genistein, daidzein, and glycitein). Separate analyses were
conducted for 4769 women who reported prediagnosis
diet and for 1466 who reported postdiagnosis diet (3
women who did not report age at diagnosis were excluded
from this analysis). For all women, we evaluated potential
effect
modification
by
race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic
white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander/other),
menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal),
receipt of hormone therapy (yes vs no), BMI (<25, 25-
29.9, � 30 kg/m2), and levels of recreational physical ac-
tivity (inactive vs active) by comparing the log-likelihood
statistics of models that included interaction terms and
models without interaction terms. P values < .05 were
considered a statistically significant effect modification at
the multiplicative scale. We further evaluated whether
associations differed for tumor hormone receptors defined
by ER and PR status (any hormone receptor positive vs
hormone receptor negative) by using multinominal Cox
proportional-hazard regression. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Table 1 describes the characteristics of the 6235 women
diagnosed with a first primary, invasive breast cancer en-
rolled in the BCFR who reported reliable dietary intake.
The mean 6 standard deviation dietary intake of isofla-
vone was 1.8 6 3.9 mg daily, and the median intake was
0.7 mg daily (interquartile range, 1.2 mg daily). Genistein
was the major source of isoflavone, followed by daidzein
and glycitein. Women who consumed high levels of die-
tary isoflavone were more likely to be Asian Americans,
young, premenopausal, physically active, more educated,
not overweight or obese, never smokers, and drank either
no alcohol or <7 drinks per week (Table 2). Women with
the lowest or highest quartiles of isoflavone intake had a
higher diet quality index compared with those in the mid-
dle quartiles.

 After a median follow-up of 113 months (approxi-
mately 9.4 years), 1224 deaths were documented. Women
in the highest quartile of dietary isoflavone intake
(�1.5 mg/d) had a 21% decrease in all-cause mortality
compared with women in the lowest quartile (<0.3 mg
daily; fourth quartile [Q4] vs first quartile [Q1]: HR,
0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97; Ptrend 5 .01) (Table 3). The in-
verse association was statistically significant for women
who reported postdiagnosis intake of total isoflavone (Q4
vs Q1: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41-1.00; Ptrend 5 .02). The
association with prediagnosis intake was weaker and was
not statistically significant (Q4 vs Q1: HR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.66-1.06; Ptrend 5 .13). The 3 common types of isofla-
vone (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein) were associated
with similar reductions in all-cause mortality (Fig. 1).
In stratified analyses (Table 4), a reduced risk of all-
cause mortality associated with high (highest vs lowest
quartile) dietary isoflavone intake was statistically signifi-
cant for women with ER-negative/PR-negative tumors
(HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.83; Ptrend 5 .006) and wom-
en who did not receive hormone therapy as a component
of their treatment for breast cancer (Q4 vs Q1: HR, 0.68;
95% CI, 0.51-0.91; Ptrend 5 .02). No associations were
observed for women who had hormone receptor-positive
tumors and those who received hormone therapy. Howev-
er, the interactions were not statistically significant. Anal-
yses stratified by race/ethnicity, menopausal status, BMI,
and physical activity indicated borderline significant
trends across quartiles of isoflavone intake for Hispanics
(Ptrend 5 .05) and normal-weight women (BMI < 25 kg/
m2; Ptrend 5 .05) and a significant trend for physically ac-
tive women (Ptrend 5 .04), but none of the HR estimates
or interactions were statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we examined the association between
dietary intake of isoflavone and all-cause mortality in
6235 women diagnosed with a first primary breast cancer
who had been followed for a median of >9 years. Overall,
we observed 21% lower all-cause mortality associated
with high isoflavone intake. The reduced mortality was
largely confined to women who had ER-negative/PR-neg-
ative tumors and those who did not receive hormone
therapy.
Although several epidemiologic studies reported
that higher soy consumption was associated with a lower
risk of breast cancer recurrence and/or mortality in Chi-
nese women,7,14,15 studies in the United States have
reported inconsistent findings.16,17 For prediagnosis in-
take of dietary isoflavone, 1 study of 3842 women en-
rolled in the Multiethnic Cohort did not indicate an
association with all-cause mortality,18 but an earlier report
in 1210 women detected a 48% reduction in all-cause
mortality for those who consumed the highest quintile of
isoflavone (>7.5 mg daily).19 For postdiagnosis intake, a
pooled analysis of 2 US cohorts did not indicate a signifi-
cant reduction in all-cause mortality associated with high
isoflavone intake (>10 mg daily).16,17,20 However, the 2

 US cohorts were predominantly non-Hispanic whites
(range, 82%-85%) with a small proportion of racial/eth-
nic minorities (approximately 5% Hispanics, 4% blacks,
and 3% Asian Americans). In our more diverse cohort of
women living in North America (approximately 17%
Hispanics, 12% blacks, and 11% Asian Americans), we
observed a significant trend of lower all-cause mortality
associated with higher dietary intake of isoflavone. This
association was similarly observed across all racial/ethnic
groups, although the trend was slightly stronger in His-
panic women. Although Asian American women enrolled
in the BCFR had a higher mean intake of dietary isofla-
vone than women from other racial/ethnic groups (6.1 vs
1.3 mg daily; P < .0001), these intake levels were substan-
tially lower than those of women living in Asian countries
(eg, the mean intake is 45.9 mg daily among women living
in China). Our findings suggest that women living in
North American, despite an overall low consumption of
isoflavone from diet, may still benefit from increasing
their isoflavone intake to a higher level.
Consistent with the pooled analysis in the 2 US
cohorts,16,17,20 we observed that high isoflavone intake
was significantly associated with a reduction in all-cause
mortality only among women with ER-negative/PR-nega-
tive tumors. Cell line studies suggest that soy isoflavone
may interact with tamoxifen therapy and potentially re-
duce the effect of cancer treatment.1 However, our study
did not indicate a negative impact of isoflavone on all-
cause mortality in women who received hormone therapy.
Among those who did not receive hormone therapy as
part of their cancer treatment, high isoflavone intake was
associated with reduced all-cause mortality. These results,
taken together, may indicate that dietary isoflavone is un-
likely to have a negative impact on the survival of women

 who receive hormone therapy; however, the potential ben-
efit may be limited to women who have negative tumor
hormone receptors (ER-negative/PR-negative) or those
who do not receive hormone therapy.
For women with breast cancer in the BCFR, infor-
mation is available on both prediagnosis and postdiagno-
sis dietary intake. This provides a unique opportunity to
assess the potential timing effect of women’s diet on sur-
vival. A statistically significant, inverse trend was observed
for postdiagnosis isoflavone intake only, with an approxi-
mately 35% reduction in all-cause mortality associated
with high intake. For prediagnosis intake, the inverse asso-
ciation was weaker and was not statistically significant. It
is possible that dietary assessment for prediagnostic intake
is associated with more measurement errors that postdiag-
nostic intake, which can bias the findings toward the null.
Alternatively, this finding may suggest that a woman’s re-
cent diet plays a more important role in survival than a
more remote diet, thus highlighting the opportunity for
women to improve their survival by increasing dietary in-
take of isoflavone after a cancer diagnosis.
Some limitations of this study should be considered
when interpreting our results. First, the use of an FFQ to
assess habitual dietary intake is subject to measurement
error in estimating absolute intake. We noticed that the
mean intake levels of isoflavone in our study population
were lower than those reported in other US women,
which may be because of differences in the FFQs used to
capture dietary isoflavone intake. Nevertheless, compar-
ing higher versus lower intake, such as comparing the
highest quartile with the lowest quartile, is still valid for
evaluating diet assessed from FFQs with health out-
comes.21 The FFQ used in the BCFR has also demon-
strated reasonable validity compared with repeated 24-
hour diet recalls (validity coefficient, r 5 0.5 for dietary
isoflavone intake).11 To further improve validity, we ex-
cluded women who had unreliable dietary reporting and
those who completed the FFQ more than 5 years after di-
agnosis to reduce errors associated with recalling more dis-
tant diet. We also adjusted for total energy intake in all
analyses to reduce confounding and improve validity by
removing correlated errors. Although we cannot rule out
misclassification of isoflavone intake, the misclassification
error is likely to be nondifferential, thus attenuating the
results toward the null.
Second, higher dietary intake of isoflavone was asso-
ciated with socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, such as ed-
ucation, BMI, recreational physical activity, cigarette

 smoking, and alcohol consumption. To minimize the
chance of residual confounding, we carefully adjusted for
all of these factors in the multivariable models.
Third, information on treatment was based on
women’s self-reports, and we lacked information on type
and length of hormone therapy, preventing a more in-
depth analysis of potential different effects in women who
received different types and lengths of hormone therapy.
However, previous validation studies in the BCFR have
indicated high agreement between self-reported treatment
information and medical records.22,23
Fourth, tumor hormone receptor status was not
available for approximately 28% of the women; the mean
intake of dietary isoflavone, however, was similar for
women with and without information on tumor hormone
receptor status (1.9 vs 1.8 mg daily, respectively; P 5 .49).
Finally, our study outcome was limited to all-cause mor-
tality, which prevented us from evaluating breast cancer-
specific mortality, recurrence, and other prognostic end-
points. Prior studies of women with breast cancer have in-
dicated that from 48% to 70% of all deaths caused by
breast cancer. We also lacked information on comorbid-
ities, which could influence all-cause mortality. Although
prior studies suggested that lifestyle risk factors may im-
pact all-cause mortality through effects on deaths unrelat-
ed to breast cancer, a pooled analysis of 2 US cohorts
reported that women who consumed high levels of dietary
isoflavone had a significantly reduced breast cancer recur-
rence, which is a surrogate for breast cancer-specific
survival.
The strengths of this study include a large number of
women from racial/ethnic minority populations, which
allowed us to evaluate the potential heterogeneous effect
by race/ethnicity groups, and the availability of clinical
and interview data, which allowed us to consider different
subtypes of breast cancer and subgroups of patients and to
adjust for confounders to minimize confounding. Bias be-
cause of differential follow-up was minimized by the use
of linkages to population-based cancer registries and death
registry record outcomes of all patients. We adjusted for
any survival bias by left-truncating all patients at the time
of recruitment.
In conclusion, in this large, ethnically diverse cohort
of women with breast cancer, higher dietary intake of iso-
flavone was associated with reduced total mortality. High
isoflavone intake may be associated with lower mortality
only for women with ER-negative/PR-negative tumors or
those who do not receive hormone therapy as part of their
cancer treatment.
