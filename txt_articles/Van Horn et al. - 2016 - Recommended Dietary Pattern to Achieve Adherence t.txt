CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
ABSTRACT: In 2013, the American Heart Association and American College 
of Cardiology published the “Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce 
Cardiovascular Risk,” which was based on a systematic review originally initiated 
by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The guideline supports the 
American Heart Association’s 2020 Strategic Impact Goals for cardiovascular 
health promotion and disease reduction by providing more specific details for 
adopting evidence-based diet and lifestyle behaviors to achieve those goals. 
In addition, the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans issued updated 
evidence relevant to reducing cardiovascular risk and provided additional 
recommendations for adopting healthy diet and lifestyle approaches. 
This scientific statement, intended for healthcare providers, summarizes 
relevant scientific and translational evidence and offers practical tips, tools, 
and dietary approaches to help patients/clients adapt these guidelines 
according to their sociocultural, economic, and taste preferences.
T
his scientific statement offers practitioners evidence-based dietary recommenda-
tions and suggested approaches to facilitate patient/consumer adherence to the 
American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) dietary 
guidelines, which are closely aligned with the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans (DGA),1 to help achieve the AHA’s 2020 Strategic Impact Goals for cardiovascular 
health promotion and disease reduction.2 The goal is to provide guidance for achieving 
adherence to a heart-healthy dietary pattern that accommodates cultural, ethnic, or eco-
nomic influences that shape personal food preferences. Current population-wide dietary 
intake departs from many of these recommendations. Implementation strategies pre-
sented here target nutrient-dense foods that contain cardiopreventive types of fats while 
avoiding excessive energy intake. Importantly, there are many options for successful ad-
aptation of one of the recommended dietary patterns that in general advocate emphasis 
on vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; include low-fat or fat-free dairy products, poultry, 
fish, legumes, nontropical (not coconut or palm kernel oil) vegetable oils, and nuts; and 
limit intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), salty or highly processed 
foods, and fatty or processed meats (choose lean or extra-lean meats instead). 
Such an eating pattern can also help achieve AHA/ACC guideline goals to reduce 
saturated fat, dietary sodium, and sugar by choosing the recommended foods.

is noteworthy that the majority of the data are derived 
from observational cohort studies.3 However, the total-
ity of the evidence continues to support population-wide 
recommendations to lower saturated fat intake.1
There is strong evidence that intake of polyunsatu-
rated fat substituted for saturated fat decreases low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.4,5 Studies that 
apply substitution methods, for example, replacement 
of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with other fatty acids or 
other foods, clearly demonstrate the benefits of replac-
ing SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids.6,7 Conversely, 
studies that ignore randomized trials and experimental 
or mechanistic studies on lipoprotein metabolism limit 
the evidence necessary to draw meaningful conclu-
sions. Nutrition research is a dynamic process, and 
science remains open to new discoveries, but current 
evidence documents that although dairy fat may be 
slightly less harmful than other food sources of satu-
rated fat, it is far less beneficial than plant-based fats, 
especially polyunsaturated fatty acids.8 The DGA1 fo-
cuses on healthy foods and eating patterns while ac-
knowledging the detrimental effects of SFAs, sodium, 
and added sugars by recommending reduced intakes. 
The present report provides practical approaches, 
tools, and guidance for reducing food sources of SFAs 
and replacing those calories with unsaturated fatty ac-
ids from plant-based oils.
BACkGroUND
In June 2013, the AHA and ACC jointly published the “AHA/
ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Car-
diovascular Risk.”9 The lifestyle guideline, initiated by the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, was based on 
a systematic evidence analysis of predominantly random-
ized controlled trials that focused on diet and physical 
activity modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk.10,11
Healthy dietary practices, at all stages of life, are in-
tegral to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and other conditions. Dietary recommen-
dations have evolved from nutrient-based to food-based 
dietary patterns that are more easily translated for coun-
seling patients/clients. This does not diminish the impor-
tance of meeting nutrient needs. Rather, for translational 
purposes, the results from food-based scientific evidence 
make possible and preferable the opportunity to offer 
practical recommendations that can readily be applied in 
the purchasing, preparing, or providing of foods and bev-
erages. Dietary pattern guidelines may also help avoid 
the unintended consequences that arose when the focus 
was on individual nutrients or foods. Figure 1 illustrates 
how few Americans currently adhere to a heart-healthy 
dietary pattern. Concomitant with excess intakes of add-
ed sugars, SFAs, and sodium are inadequate intakes of 
vegetables, fruits, dairy, and unsaturated fats, which col-
lectively constitute increased cardiovascular risk.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Beyond the overconsumption and underconsumption 
of specific nutrients and foods, excess calorie intake 
remains a major public health challenge. Often, those 
calories contribute SFAs and added sugars (defined as 
empty calories), along with sodium-laden foods and re-
fined grains that increase risk for overweight, obesity, hy-
pertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Choosing 
a nutrient-dense dietary pattern that leads to maintenance 
of a healthy body weight is key to meeting food-based 
dietary recommendations. In that context, underconsump-
tion of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and nonfat and 
low-fat dairy by the vast majority of the population has 
resulted in inadequate intakes of dietary fiber (current in-
takes are only half the recommended 28–30 g/d), potas-
sium, calcium, and vitamin D, all considered nutrients of 
public health concern. Appendix 1 illustrates these and 
other nutrients by age and ethnicity. Excess intake of 
empty calories can displace the intake of unsaturated oils 
and other nutrient-dense foods that could help meet nutri-
ent requirements and reduce CVD risk. Figure 2 illustrates 
this point across all ages in both males and females. The 
overweight/obesity epidemic currently affects the major-
ity of the US population, with especially high rates in His-
panic and black subgroups, and nearly 1 in 3 (33%) of all 
US children are overweight/obese.14
Reasons for poor adherence to dietary recommen-
dations are many. At an individual level, reasons could 
include inadequate knowledge, misinterpretation of nu-
trition guidance, cost factors, or lack of motivation to 
change. Environmental factors, lack of access to or 
availability of healthy foods (called food desert), and 
easy access to unhealthy foods (called food swamp) are 
common, especially in certain geographic areas. Health-
care providers typically lack adequate information on the 
current dietary intake of their patients/clients and may 
be unfamiliar with the recommended eating pattern to 
foster diet adherence, to meet nutrient needs, and to 
decrease multiple risk factors.15
DEvELoPING DIETAry PATTErN GUIDELINES
The critical question addressed by the AHA/ACC com-
mittee was, “Among adults, what is the effect of dietary 
patterns and/or macronutrient composition on CVD risk 
factors compared with no treatment or with other types 
of interventions?” After an extensive systematic review 
of the literature, the committee concluded that adults 
who need to lower LDL-C and blood pressure (BP) should 
consume a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, 
fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy prod-
ucts, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, 
and nuts; and has limited intake of sweets, SSBs, red 
meats, and processed foods. This dietary pattern not 
only should be adapted to meet appropriate calorie re-
quirements and personal and cultural food preferences 
but also should incorporate relevant nutrition therapy to 
address multiple risk factors or medical conditions such 
as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This pattern can be 
achieved in a variety of ways, but extensive evidence 
demonstrates that following the Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, the US De-
partment of Agriculture (USDA) food pattern, a tradition-

al Mediterranean-style diet, or the AHA dietary pattern 
can successfully accomplish these goals. The last one 
has been mistakenly referred to as a low-fat diet, but 
more accurately, it is an eating pattern low in SFAs and 
sodium and moderate in unsaturated and total fat. These 
eating patterns are more similar than dissimilar and can 
be readily adapted to individual tastes.
More specifically, the AHA recommends reduction of 
SFA intake to <7% of total calorie intake (<6% of total cal-
orie intake for patients at cardiovascular risk), avoidance 
of trans fats, and reduction of sodium intake to <2300 
mg/d (to be consistent with DGA) or further reduction to 
1500 mg/d as needed for enhanced BP lowering. Sodium 
reductions by at least 1000 mg/d are recommended even 
if the desired daily sodium intake is not yet achieved. Both 
of these recommendations (for SFAs and sodium) were 
ranked at Level of Evidence A. Furthermore, strong evi-
dence of the atherogenic effect of SFAs was recently con-
firmed by a Cochrane review reporting increased risk of 
CVD as a result of increased SFA intake.4 Currently, >80% 
of people in the United States consume >2300 mg/d of 
sodium, and >60% of most people consume >10% of 
kcal from SFAs, thereby far exceeding the recommended 
amounts. Appendixes 2 and 3 illustrate these levels. Ex-
cessive SFA intake should be replaced with polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids without 
exceeding energy needs. The Obesity Society has also 
officially endorsed these guidelines.10 The development of 
AHA/ACC/The Obesity Society guidelines for the manage-
ment of obesity in adults involved an extensive systematic 
review of the literature addressing the cardiovascular ben-
efits of weight loss through reduced energy intake, with 
strong evidence to support this recommendation.16–19 Of 
note, the AHA/ACC/The Obesity Society rated the level of 
evidence to support an independent role of macronutrient 
composition on short-term and sustained maintenance of 
weight loss as low to moderate. This conclusion allows 
maximum flexibility when an energy-deficient weight-loss 
diet is tailored to personal preferences.10 (Appendix 4 il-
lustrates that the majority of US adults ≥20 years of age 
are overweight or obese.)

The DASH dietary pattern was developed as part of a 
study to test the effects of modifying the whole diet on 
BP.20 The DASH dietary pattern emphasizes fruits, veg-
etables, and low-fat dairy products; includes whole grains, 
poultry, fish, and nuts; and is reduced in SFAs, red meat, 
sweets, and beverages containing added sugars. This di-
etary pattern is broadly effective in lowering BP and is 
particularly effective in blacks and individuals with hyper-
tension.21 A subsequent trial, the DASH-Sodium trial, com-
bined the DASH dietary pattern with 3 levels of sodium: 
low (1500 mg/d), intermediate (2400 mg/d), and high 
(3300 mg/d).22 The greatest reductions in BP occurred 
when the DASH diet was coupled with sodium reduction. 
Again, blacks and individuals with hypertension achieved 
the greatest BP reductions, but BP reductions also oc-
curred in individuals without hypertension. Thus, there is 
substantial clinical and public health relevance for advo-
cating a DASH-style diet with reduced sodium intake.22
The question of whether modifying macronutrient con-
tent might improve the benefits of the DASH diet on CVD 
risk was tested in the OmniHeart study (Optimal Macro-
nutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health).23 Three variants of 
the DASH diets were tested: a diet rich in carbohydrate 
(similar to the original DASH diet), a second diet higher 
in protein (about half from plant sources), and a third diet 
higher in unsaturated fat (predominantly monounsaturat-
ed fat). Each of the diets tested in OmniHeart was similar 
to the original DASH diet: Each was reduced in SFAs, 
cholesterol, and sodium and rich in fruit, vegetables, and 
low-fat dairy products. Although each diet lowered sys-
tolic BP, the diets rich in either protein or unsaturated fat 
further lowered BP, albeit slightly. The OmniHeart diet 
rich in monounsaturated fatty acids is similar in many re-
spects to Mediterranean-style diets. Reductions in LDL-C 
and triglycerides also occurred.23

In contrast to the clearly defined DASH dietary pattern, 
there is no one, standardized Mediterranean diet. Rather, 
the widely used term Mediterranean diet reflects a variety 
of eating habits traditionally practiced by populations in 
countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, with consider-
able variability by location. The authors of the AHA/ACC 
lifestyle guideline9 reviewed published data reporting as-
sociations between the Mediterranean-type dietary pattern 
and CVD. This pattern was characterized as being “gener-
ous in fruits and vegetables, whole grains and fatty fish.” 
Other characteristics often include lean meat, skim or low-
fat dairy products, and sources of monounsaturated fatty 
acids, including olive, canola oil, nuts (walnuts, almonds, 
and hazelnuts), and soft margarine spreads. Modest con-
sumption of alcohol, specifically wine, is also featured but 
without recommended frequency or amounts. Likewise, 
the 2015 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee de-
fined a healthy dietary pattern as being high in vegetables, 
fruit, whole grains, seafood and fatty fish, legumes, and 
nuts; moderate in low-fat and nonfat dairy products; lower 
in red and processed meat; and low in refined grains and 
foods and beverages containing added sugars.16
The typical Mediterranean dietary pattern includes 
total dietary fat in the range of 32% to ≥35% of total 
energy intake with 9% to 10% of energy from SFAs and

relatively high amounts of monounsaturated and polyun-
saturated fatty acids, with an emphasis on omega-3 fatty 
acids. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains contribute to 
a dietary fiber intake of 27 to 37 g/d, double the cur-
rent US dietary fiber intake.16 Compared with the DASH 
and USDA patterns, the Mediterranean dietary pattern 
is lower in dairy and red and processed meats, higher 
in olive oil and seafood, and moderate with regard to 
intake of wine.16 Several different scoring systems have 
been reported in an effort to quantify the extent of ad-
herence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern.24–29 Cross-
cultural variability in the application of the Mediterranean 
diet limits the development of precise associations or 
conclusive findings on the specific benefits in risk factor 
reduction, including effects on serum lipids.
The AHA/ACC lifestyle guideline designated low 
evidence for this dietary pattern association and con-
cluded, “Counseling to eat a Mediterranean pattern com-
pared to minimal or no dietary advice in free-living middle 
aged or older adults (with or without CVD or at high risk 
for CVD) resulted in no consistent effect on plasma LDL-
C, HDL-C [high-density lipoprotein cholesterol], and TG 
[triglycerides].”9 Likewise, “low evidence” was cited in 
comparing the Mediterranean dietary pattern to minimal 
dietary advice in lowering systolic BP by 6 to 7 mm 
Hg 
and diastolic BP by 2 to 3 mm 
Hg.
Although the evidence base has been rated low for 
traditional CVD risk factors, appreciable outcome data 
demonstrate health benefits, including CVD risk reduc-
tion, that are attributed to a Mediterranean-style dietary 
pattern (2015 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Commit-
tee).16 For example, the PREDIMED study (Prevencion 
con Dieta Mediterranea), conducted in Spain, demon-
strated significant benefits on CVD of a Mediterranean 
dietary pattern supplemented with food products.29 Par-
ticipants were randomized to 1 of 3 arms: 1 group given 
limited advice to lower total dietary fat (<30% kcal total 
fat), 1 group provided with extravirgin olive oil (50 g/d, 
equal to 425 kcal/d), and 1 group provided with nuts 
(30 g/d, equal to 174 kcal/d, including 15 g/d walnuts, 
7.5 g/d almonds, and 7.5 g/d hazelnuts) for 5 years. No 
specific advice was given for weight reduction or physical 
activity. LDL-C was not significantly different among the 
groups (the control group did not achieve a low-fat diet, 
with total fat intake at ≈37% kcal), but favorable changes 
in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyc-
erides were reported among the groups consuming olive 
oil and nuts.29 A significant 30% reduction in cardiovascu-
lar events was reported among the 2 Mediterranean diet 
groups, primarily the result of decreased stroke rates.29 
Because neither group that was provided with the olive 
oil or nuts gained weight during the intervention period, 
it seems likely that other components of their diets were 
reduced. Importantly, because the 2 active interventions 
included provision of food supplements (extravirgin olive 
oil in 1 group and mixed nuts in the other) concurrent with 
dietary advice, it is difficult to attribute the benefits ob-
served in PREDIMED strictly to the Mediterranean diet. A 
subsequent longitudinal study also reported higher poly-
phenol intake associated with this diet based on dietary 
and urinary measures that was associated with reduc-
tions in plasma glucose and triglycerides and lower BP.30
In summary, greater adherence to the Mediterranean 
dietary pattern has been associated with reductions in 
coronary heart disease risk by 29% to 69% and reduced 
risk of a stroke by 13% to 53%. Data from recent meta-
analyses reported a 10% reduction in risk of CVD (fatal 
or nonfatal clinical CVD event) per 2-increment increase 
in adherence to the Mediterranean-style diet.16,24,31–35 A 
recent methodological quality assessment of meta-anal-
yses and systematic reviews of the Mediterranean diet 
and CVD outcomes concluded that current reviews on 
the topic do not fully comply with contemporary meth-
odological quality standards; hence, more research is 
needed to enhance our understanding of how the Medi-
terranean diet affects CVD.36 The evidence for lowering 
SFAs to <7% of total calories to reduce LDL-C is strong 
and justifies the AHA recommendation.

A vegetarian dietary pattern comprises predominantly 
plant-based foods without (vegan) and with dairy prod-
ucts, eggs (lacto-ovo vegetarian), or fish (pesco-vegetar-
ian). These patterns include predominantly vegetables, 
fruits, whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. Other 
common adaptations of vegetarian diets include poultry, 
“white meat,” or dairy products and eggs but not poultry 
or red meat. Such variability complicates the assess-
ment of true risk factor associations.
Randomized controlled trials and observational stud-
ies of vegetarians have consistently demonstrated ben-
eficial effects on LDL-C, systolic and diastolic BPs, and 
body weight.37–39 Some trials have reported lowering of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and 
the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein.40 
Vegetarian dietary patterns are characterized as pre-
dominantly including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, 
and nuts, similar to the DASH diet. Whether vegetarian 
diets, with or without dairy products, achieve benefits 
similar to those of the DASH diet is unknown. Likewise, 
whether there are cardioprotective effect differences be-
tween vegan and lacto-ovo vegetarian diets is unknown. 
Vegetarian diets are generally less prescriptive than the 
DASH diet, but compared with nonvegetarian diets, car-
diovascular outcomes are typically favorable.41–44 Care 
must be taken to ensure that individuals who wish to 
follow a vegetarian diet are including the recommended 
nutrient-dense foods rather than simply avoiding meat 
and resorting to sugar-added or SFA-laden foods.

Energy Balance and Nutrient Density
Concerns about the existing obesity epidemic require care-
ful consideration of the types and amounts of food con-
sumed with a goal of achieving high nutrient density while 
keeping the energy content of the diet within recommended 
ranges for body weight. The increased availability of foods 
prepared with refined grains and caloric sweeteners has 
contributed to the problem of excess energy consumption. 
Figure 2 illustrates the overconsumption of nutrient-poor, 
calorie-dense foods that currently characterizes the ma-
jority of the population across all age and sex groups.
A wide variety of healthy dietary patterns can reduce 
energy intake while improving cardiometabolic risk factors 
associated with weight loss.45–49 The DASH dietary pattern 
formed the basis of the 2005 and 2010 dietary guidelines 
and has become popularized over the past few years.50 
The Federal Trade Commission regards fad diets as those 
that eliminate or severely restrict nutrient-dense foods and 
promote energy-dense foods (added sugars and high-fat 
meat and dairy) that are often poor in nutrients.51–53 Fad 
diets should be avoided. They do not achieve long-term 
weight loss or benefit cardiovascular health.
Table 1 lists the 6 highest-ranked sources of energy 
intake by the US population, including burgers, sand-
wiches and tacos, desserts and sweet snacks, SSBs, 
rice- and pasta-based mixed dishes, chips and crackers, 
and pizza.1 Collectively, these foods provide 43.2 % of 
total current energy intake in the United States. On aver-
age, across age groups, desserts, sweet snacks, and 
SSBs, which provide little or no nutritive value, contrib-
ute 15.0 % of energy intake. Because these foods often 
replace nutrient-dense foods and beverages, the Ameri-
can diet falls short of essential micronutrients such as 
calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and dietary fiber. These 
are regarded as nutrients of concern.
In the interest of facilitating nutrient-dense energy in-
take and weight control, Table 2 presents the Healthy 
US-Style Eating Pattern (at different calorie levels) that 
has been adapted to meet AHA food-based and nutri-
ent recommendations. Specifically, this dietary pattern 
achieves the recommended 5% to 6% of calories from 
SFAs and <2400 mg/d sodium (<2300 mg/d to align 
with the 2015 DGA) at all calorie levels as recommend-
ed in the AHA/ACC guideline.9 In addition, it meets the 
added sugars recommendations (that are based on total 
calories), given that women typically require fewer calo-
ries than men. It can also be safely applied to children’s 
diets on the basis of their calorie requirements.
The following list offers expanded information and ex-
amples of the AHA’s recommended dietary pattern:
• Vegetables: Beneficial sources of potassium, mag-
nesium, and fiber. Examples include broccoli, car-
rots, collards, green beans, green peas, kale, lima 
beans, sweet potatoes, spinach, squash, toma-
toes, and peppers.
• Fruits: Beneficial sources of potassium, magne-
sium, and fiber. Examples are apricots, bananas, 
dates, grapes, oranges, orange juice, grape-
fruit, grapefruit juice, mangoes, melons, papaya, 
peaches, pears, pineapples, raisins, raspberries, 
strawberries, and tangerines.
• Grains: Major sources of energy and fiber that pro-
vide satiety. Whole grains are recommended for 
most grain servings as a good source of fiber and 
nutrients. Examples are whole-wheat bread and 
rolls; whole-wheat pasta; cereals such as grits, 
oatmeal, and brown rice; and popcorn. Portion 
sizes vary and should be monitored.
• Fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products and non-
dairy products: Major sources of calcium, potas-
sium, protein, and vitamin D in fortified products. 
Examples include fat-free or low-fat milk or but-
termilk, low-fat or reduced-fat cheese, and fat-free 
or low-fat regular or frozen yogurt. Nondairy nut/
grain/soy-based milks that are fortified with cal-
cium and vitamin D and low in sugar are accept-
able alternatives. Caution is needed in considering 
added sugars in yogurts and flavored milks.
• Lean and extralean meats, poultry, and fish: 
Beneficial sources of protein and magnesium.

Shown is the daily amount of food from each group (with vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts stated per week). AHA indicates American Heart 
Association; oz eq, ounce equivalent; and Tbsp, tablespoon.
*AHA’s recommended eating pattern from 1200 to 1800 cal meets the nutritional needs of children 4 to 8 years old. Patterns from 1600 to 3100 cal 
meet the nutritional needs of children ≥9 years of age and adults.
†A prudent intake of added sugars is no more than 100 cal/d for most American women and 150 cal/d for most American men. The 2015–2020 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans indicate that added sugars should not to exceed 10% of energy needs for adults and 100 cal/d for children.1
‡Total sodium recommended should not exceed 2300 mg/d. (AHA/American College of Cardiology recommended <2400 mg Na/d.) The AHA’s 
recommended eating pattern limits sodium intake to ≤2300 mg/d (1500 mg/d) as the patient’s needs dictate.

cholesterol per yolk) may be appropriate. Two egg 
whites have the same protein content as 1 oz meat.
• Nuts, seeds, and legumes: Beneficial sources of 
energy, magnesium, protein, and fiber. Examples are 
almonds, hazelnuts, mixed nuts, peanuts, walnuts, 
pistachios, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, peanut 
butter, kidney beans, lentils, and split peas. However, 
individuals should be mindful of calories, choose 
smaller portion sizes, and select salt-free products.
• Fats and oils: The AHA/ACC diet recommends 
avoiding trans fats and limiting SFAs to <6% of total 
calories. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated 
fatty acids should be substituted for SFAs and trans 
fat. An upper limit on total fat was not set, but total 
energy intake should support weight-control efforts. 
The DASH diet has smaller serving sizes for higher-
fat foods from the fats and oils group. For instance, 
1 tablespoon of regular salad dressing is 1 serv-
ing, and 2 tablespoons of low-fat dressing is 1 serv-
ing. Examples include soft margarine, vegetable 
oil (canola, corn, olive, soybean, safflower), low-fat 
mayonnaise, and light salad dressing. Caution is 
needed to avoid sources with added salt or sugar.
• Sweets and added sugars: Should be limited. The 
recommendation for added sugars is no more than 
100 kcal/d for women or 150 kcal/d for men and 
<100 kcal for children on the basis of total energy 
needs, as indicated in Table 2. Examples are SSBs 
such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy 
drinks, and sweetened tea and coffee drinks. Also 
included are candy; sweetened grain-based des-
serts such as cake, cookies, pies, cobblers, sweet 
rolls, pastries, doughnuts, and granola bars; and 
dairy desserts such as ice cream.
• Sodium: The AHA’s recommended eating pattern 
limits sodium intake to ≤2300 mg/d (1500 mg/d) 
as patient needs dictate. The “salty six,” foods 
providing the most sodium in the US diet, include 
bread and rolls, cured meats, pizza, poultry, soup, 
and sandwiches, which contribute excess sodium 
to the diets of most Americans.54 In general, >75% 
of sodium intake is derived from processed and 
restaurant foods, not salt added at the table.55
To help visualize practical applications of these rec-
ommendations, Table 3 provides the food groups with 
examples and portion sizes to facilitate selections and 
choices. In addition, Appendixes 5 and 6 provide prac-
tical applications with suggested menus for vegetarian 
and nonvegetarian choices that further encompass the 
foods, portions by meals, and snack occasions in align-
ment with eating pattern recommendations.
Limiting Alcohol and Sweets: rationale
Alcohol intake can be a component of a healthy dietary 
pattern if consumed in moderation (no more than 1 drink 
per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men) and 
only by nonpregnant women and adults56 when there is 
no risk to health condition, drug-alcohol interaction, or 
work situations. One drink is equivalent to 12 oz beer 
(5% alcohol), 5 oz wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 oz of 
80-proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol).57 Calorie limits 
should be considered.
The 2015 DGA recommends limiting added sugars in-
take to a maximum of 10% of total calories. One teaspoon 
of sugar contributes 16 calories. Added sugars, as docu-
mented in the USDA food patterns for calorie levels ap-
propriate for most people (1600–2400 cal), range from 
4% to 6% of calories from added sugars (or 4.5–9.4 tea-
spoons). A 20-oz bottle of cola contributes 14 teaspoons 
of sugar. The AHA recommends limiting added sugars to 
no more than 100 cal or 6 teaspoons day for most wom-
en and 150 cal or 9 teaspoons a day for most men. When 
added sugars exceed this amount, a healthy dietary pat-
tern is difficult to achieve within the energy needs of most 
people. The DGA focuses on reducing sugar-sweetened 
foods and drinks and refined grains. Healthy beverage op-
tions such as water and fat-free or low-fat milk should be 
encouraged in place of SSBs. There is a robust body of 
evidence that SSB consumption is detrimental to health 
and has been associated with increased risk of CVD mor-
tality,58 hypertension,59,60 liver lipogenesis,61 T2DM,62–64 
obesity, and kidney disease.65 Figure 3 illustrates the ex-
cessive intake of added sugars across the population. Im-
portantly, added sugar consumption decreased in all age 
groups for both sexes between 2001 to 2004 and 2007 
to 2010. Nonetheless, it remains high, and continued ef-
forts are needed to decrease consumption.
Adopting a Physically Active Lifestyle to 
Complement Dietary Intake
For adults and children, physical activity is an essential 
and complementary companion to the heart-healthy di-
etary patterns described above. It is essential to the 
concept of energy balance (ie, energy or calories in ver-
sus energy out or calories burned) for weight control, 
for general fitness, and for achieving cardiometabolic 
risk reduction and optimal health. The “2013 AHA/ACC 
Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardio-
vascular Risk” recommends 40 minutes of moderate 
to vigorous activity 3 to 4 d/wk to help control BP and 
to improve blood cholesterol levels.9,10 The 2013 AHA/
ACC/The Obesity Society guideline for the management 
of overweight and obesity in adults also promotes the 
important role of physical activity to prevent and treat 
overweight and obesity.10 Lifestyle intervention pro-
grams aimed at treating overweight and obesity should 
produce an energy deficit achieved by caloric reduction 
and/or increased physical activity. In such cases, the 
recommended amount of aerobic physical activity is 
>150 min/wk (ie, ≈30 minutes or more on most days of

weight loss, but simple steps to reduce sedentary be-
havior and time spent seated such as increasing time 
spent standing or walking throughout the day are also

have at least 60 min/d of physical activity.1
ADAPTING DIETAry PATTErNS for SPECIAL 
PoPULATIoNS
The multiethnic nature of the country requires special 
consideration to accommodate healthy eating patterns 
that are also culturally appropriate across different age 
groups, families, and socioeconomic and literacy levels. 
Efforts to enhance acculturation by adapting cultural 
preferences through the use of heart-healthy ingredients 
may help achieve better adherence. The “2013 AHA/
ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce 
Cardiovascular Risk” recommends adapting the recom-
mended dietary pattern to decrease LDL-C and BP to 
personal and cultural food preferences.9
Asian/Multiethnic Groups
Some ethnic groups experience a disproportionately 
greater burden of CVD, including coronary heart disease 
and stroke.66 The AHA science advisory on CVD in Asian 
Americans67 addressed the variability among Asian sub-
groups and cited that acculturation is associated with the 
development of CVD. The typical dietary patterns among 
Chinese, Korean, and Japanese people are lower in fat and 
SFAs than US diets but often are higher in sodium. Asian 
Indian dietary patterns are high in saturated and hydroge-
nated fats from ghee (clarified butter), coconut, Vanaspati 
(hydrogenated vegetable oils), and refined carbohydrates. 
The advisory further addressed risk factors in the Asian 
subgroups. Lack of adherence to a dietary pattern rich in 
vegetables and fruits was associated with 2- to 3-fold 
increased risk of incident CVD in South Asians.68
The Oslo Immigrant Health study69 included 629 in-
dividuals 30 to 60 years of age born in Sri Lanka and 
Pakistan who were living in Oslo, Norway. The majority 
reported increased intakes of meat and potatoes, with 
the Sri Lankans also reporting more milk, butter, and 
margarine consumption compared with their native diet. 
Both groups also reported decreased native bean and 
lentil intakes, thereby suggesting overall potential for 
adverse health implications. These shifts have resulted 
in a higher body mass index (2.1–5.8 body mass index 
point difference) in the European Asians compared with 
their native counterparts, and relative risks of T2DM for 
South Asians compared with the native population were 
5.6 and 7.5 for women and men, respectively.70
A US multiethnic population study71 in white, black, 
Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, and Latino 
adults suggested that consuming a dietary pattern that 
achieves a high diet-quality index score regardless of 
cultural specificity is associated with a lower risk of 
mortality from all causes, CVD, and cancer in adult men 
and women. Four diet-quality indexes (the Healthy Eat-
ing Index-2010, Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010, 
alternate Mediterranean diet score, and DASH diet 
score) predicted a reduction in risk of mortality from all 
causes, CVD, and cancer, thereby illustrating common-
alities among healthy eating patterns despite cultural 
variations in specific foods consumed.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Black, hispanic, and Different Age/race/Cultural 
Groups
Blacks have a higher prevalence of hypertension, coro-
nary heart disease mortality, stroke, obesity, and T2DM 
compared with the general population. Latino Ameri-
cans have a higher prevalence of obesity and T2DM, 
and Native Americans have a higher prevalence of 
obesity, hypertension, CVD, and T2DM.72 Higher preva-
lence of overweight and obesity in these ethnic groups 
may exacerbate these related risk factors (Appendix 
4). For some ethnic groups, this higher prevalence is 
associated with diets that reflect less adherence to the 
dietary recommendations. For example, blacks report 
lower intakes of fruits, vegetables, and fiber and higher 
intakes of added sugars compared with non-Hispanic 
whites and other ethnic groups.73–75 American Indians 
and Pacific Islanders consume fewer fruits and vegeta-
bles than whites.76 Reasons for these differences in in-
take vary, including culture and tradition, neighborhood 
availability of healthy foods, price, and other factors. In 
contrast, other ethnic groups traditionally report health-
ier eating patterns than whites. For example, Mexican 
Americans report a higher intake of dietary fiber than 
other ethnic groups.77 Through acculturation, defined 
as the adoption of some beliefs, patterns, and/or be-
haviors of a host culture, or time spent in a new coun-
try,78 traditional eating patterns are lost and the eating 
patterns of the host culture (that often are less healthy) 
are adopted.74,79 Because of these differences, practi-
tioners should suggest strategies to help patients/con-
sumers fit healthy choices into their current cultural, 
ethnic, or other preferred eating pattern. Appendix 5 
provides sample menus to facilitate diet planning con-
sistent with AHA diet recommendations, and Appendix 6 
provides sample vegetarian menus. Other cookbooks of 
interest are available online.80,81

alternate Mediterranean diet score, and DASH) that was 
associated with lower mortality.71 These dietary patterns 
share many common elements. Despite the many Medi-
terranean diet variations, a common factor (clustering 
of foods) accounted for 71% of the variance in analysis 
of 10 scoring systems for the Mediterranean diet us-
ing food frequency questionnaire data.83 A review of the 
35 brief questionnaires designed to score intake on the 
basis of recommended foods (eg, fruits and vegetables) 
or dietary patterns (eg, DGA or the Mediterranean diet) 
concluded that similarity of the clinical population to the 
study population and the measurement characteristics 
of the instrument are important considerations.84 Patient 
and public education has historically used food group 
dietary planning methods.85 Simplified assessment tools 
can promote self-monitoring based on dietary pattern 
recommendations.86 Achieving adherence to the recom-
mended dietary patterns involves choosing meals high 
in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, seafood, legumes, 
and nuts; moderate in low-fat and nonfat dairy products; 
lower in red and processed meat, foods and beverag-
es containing added sugar, and refined grains.16 Food 
group–based dietary planning and evaluation tools can 
promote achieving and monitoring the effects of such 
dietary patterns.12,83,87–92 Identifying inconsistencies and 
gaps through diet assessment can offer targets for ef-
fective intervention based on individual preferences and 
access.
Table 4 offers some options for assessing dietary ad-
herence by the healthcare provider or the patient/client. 
Appendix 7 enhances provider-based attention to guid-
ing patient/client dietary change.
Key user points related to use of electronic diaries 
include the following:
1. A session with a registered dietitian or other qualified 
healthcare professional is strongly recommended 
to launch this effort in a timely and productive man-
ner and to limit patient/client frustration that could 
sabotage adherence.
2. People feel frustrated when they cannot find the 
exact food items listed in electronic food data-
bases. They need to be advised how to select the 
food most similar to what they ate. It is not how 
large the food database is in a self-monitoring pro-
gram that is important; rather, it is the ease of use 
and simplicity of matching food items to what was 
consumed.
3. Self-monitoring is challenging for people who have 
had no previous experience and for individuals who 
rarely cook. Training in self-monitoring is helpful.
4. Self-monitoring programs with an application for a 
mobile device facilitate checking a food while in a 
social setting, for example, at a restaurant while 
reviewing the menu.
Addressing Intervention: More of This, Less of That
The eating patterns described above have many compo-
nents in common. The DASH, Mediterranean, and USDA 
dietary patterns all emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and fish and moder-
ate amounts of lean meats, poultry, and unsaturated fats. 
The DASH and USDA dietary patterns emphasize low-fat 
dairy foods, but unlike the Mediterranean diet, there are 
no specific recommendations on olive oil or red wine. A

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
vegetarian (lacto-ovo or vegan) diet can also represent 
adherence to the recommended dietary pattern with ap-
propriate elimination of animal products and replacement 
with vegetable protein as relevant. The 2015 Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee summarized data from 
55 studies and concluded that there was strong evidence 
that any of the above eating patterns that are “lower in 
SFA, cholesterol, and sodium and higher in fiber, potas-
sium, and unsaturated fats are beneficial for reducing 
cardiovascular disease risk.” Healthcare providers who 
counsel patients/clients to improve dietary pattern intake 
can start by assessing current eating patterns (Table 4) 
or referring to population intakes as illustrated in Figure 1 
and Appendixes 1 through 3. Then, the healthcare provid-
er should introduce the eating patterns that offer healthier 
choices and proceed with the patient/client’s preferences 
in mind. Appendixes 5 through 8 offer healthcare provid-
ers some additional guidance in adapting this process 
to their practices. Table 5 suggests another approach 
to adapting a healthy eating pattern by contrasting food 
group by food group the emphasized and de-emphasized 
food choices, as illustrated in Table 5.
The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee re-
ported moderate-level evidence that favorable outcomes 
related to healthy body weight (including lower body 
mass index, waist circumference, or percent body fat) or 
Table 6. Evidence-Based Strategies to Enhance Adherence to Changes in Diet and Eating Behaviors
Self-monitoring
Self-monitoring consists of systematically observing and recording one’s behavior (eg, foods consumed). Self-monitoring 
consistency is positively related to successful outcomes such as improved diet and weight loss. 
Example: Sustaining self-monitoring efforts is critical, so give positive reinforcement at any effort to self-monitoring. Instruct 
individuals in strategies to maximize efficiency (ie, recording regularly so there is less need to recall, using electronic diaries 
that have a food database that can be used to search for foods and to save frequently eaten meals, and self-monitoring in 
social settings without it being obvious to others).94–97
Goal setting
Teach individuals the importance of setting goals for behavior change and have them be specific, proximal, and reasonably 
attainable.98 Goals can target a change in macronutrient intake (eg, reduced calories or fats); specific foods (eg, reduced SSBs 
or desserts or increased fruits or vegetables); or a behavior change (eg, eat breakfast daily). 
Example: Give feedback on progress to goal, use positive reinforcement for any effort, reevaluate goals and strategies, and 
problem-solve when progress to goal is absent.
Self-efficacy 
enhancement
Self-efficacy enhancement strategies are based on the 4 sources of self-efficacy: mastery, achieving the specified goal; modeling by 
a credible source, watching others prepare healthful foods; verbal persuasion, verbally convincing a person of your belief that she/he 
can perform a specific task; and physiological cues, demonstrating or providing an example of how a person might feel better once a 
behavior change made (eg, losing weight or eating a more healthful diet). Use all strategies to support goal achievement.99
Relapse prevention
Teach participants to recognize situations that place them at risk for lapses from their dietary behavior change program. They 
can learn how to use behavioral and cognitive strategies for handling these situations in the future (eg, remove themselves 
from temptation or convince themselves that tempting food is not worth the calories).100,101 
Example: Engage individuals in strategies to sustain behavior while on vacation (eg, weigh themselves, self-monitor 1 time per 
day, or monitor specific foods that may be a problem).
Reinforcement
Providing positive feedback on progress made toward the goal of behavior change supports self-motivation by acknowledging 
accomplishments and instilling confidence and self-efficacy in the individual’s capability of attaining a goal.102 
Example: Find any positive element that can be reinforced even with weight gain. Any communication on the part of the 
individual can be reinforced and framed as an indicator of their desire to change.
Stimulus control
This strategy recognizes that multiple cues exist in the immediate and distant environment that can trigger behaviors, both 
healthy and unhealthy. The patient can be counseled to remove those stimuli and to restructure the environment to minimize 
the will power needed to overcome strong stimuli. 
Example: Avoid bringing home foods that may lead to lapses and have healthful foods highly visible and ready to eat.103
Social support
Individuals can enlist the support of others in their environment, including work, social, and home settings, and share goals 
with those who can support their efforts in behavior change.104 
Example: Practice asking coworkers to bring in healthier snacks for weekly meetings or remove candy jars from the kitchen.
Ongoing contact
Ongoing contact can be provided through electronic devices, e-mail, or telephone.105,106 
Example: send e-mail or text message reminder to self-monitor and reinforcement messages.
Tailoring the 
regimen
This approach entails being sensitive to the needs of diverse individuals and to cultural practices and beliefs in recommending 
dietary change and being sensitive to literacy and financial constraints.107 
Example: Avoid asking people of Chinese descent to eat salad entrees to increase vegetable consumption because they believe 
warm foods are better for the digestive tract. Be prepared to educate on low-cost fruits and vegetables those individuals who 
cannot afford fresh produce or do not have easy access to them.

risk of obesity are achieved with dietary patterns that are 
higher in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, seafood, and 
legumes; moderate in dairy products (particularly low-fat 
and nonfat dairy) and alcohol; lower in meats (including 
red and processed meats); and low in sugar-sweetened 
foods, SSBs, and refined grains.93 During childhood and 
adolescence, the same dietary pattern associated with a 
healthy weight in adults but modified in portion size and 
age-appropriate foods is encouraged.

Additional research is needed to develop evidence-based 
translational strategies that achieve sustained dietary 
changes and eating behaviors that reduce the risk of CVD 
across all population groups. This includes individual choice 
at the institutional level such as schools, childcare facili-
ties, hospitals, restaurants, prisons, workplace cafeterias, 
and other public food service locations. Some of the key 
research questions and target areas include the following:
1. What is the impact of improving overall diet quality, 
and what defines specific components, including 
reduced levels of dietary sodium, added sugars, 
and solid fats and increased dietary sources of fiber, 
vegetable-based protein, fish, and unsaturated fatty 
acid–based foods, on risk factors for CVD and for 
CVD morbidity and mortality? Interactions with ther-
apeutic medication use (eg, diuretics, antihyperten-
sives, and lipid-lowering drugs), age, body mass 
index, activity, and other lifestyle factors should be 
considered. What impact does full versus partial 
(dose-dependent) implementation of current dietary 
recommendations have on CVD risk?
2. What is the accessibility/utility/accuracy of objective 
biomarkers of dietary intake, for example, 24-hour 
urine collection for sodium assessment in populations 
with different health conditions, fatty acid profiles for 
assessment of fatty acid intake (ie, fish consump-
tion), and metabolomic technology for assessing 
intake of whole grains, fruits/vegetables, legumes, 
etc, and their interactions with different patterns of 
medication use (eg, diuretics, antihypertensives)?
3. What is the effect on eating pattern adherence of 
behavioral interventions with novel approaches 
(eg, flavorful recipes, cooking techniques) that are 
culturally acceptable but anchored on achieving 
dietary recommendations?
4. Should dietary recommendations be made on an 
energy-intake basis, specifically for sodium because 
sodium intake is highly correlated with caloric intake?
5. What are the effects of replacing SFAs with dif-
ferent types of carbohydrates (eg, refined versus 
whole grains) or with different types of unsaturated 
fats on CVD risk? In addition, what is the impact of 
replacing SFAs with a type of protein (plant versus 
animal protein)? What is the optimal mix of macro-
nutrients, including type and amount, needed to 
maximally decrease CVD risk?
6. What are the effects of SFAs when derived from 
different sources, including animal products (eg, 
butter versus lard), plant (eg, palm versus coconut 
oils), and production systems (eg, refined deodor-
ized bleached versus virgin coconut oil), on blood 
lipids and CVD risk?
7. What are effective approaches and policies that 
can help to reduce the amount of sodium, solid 
fats, and added sugars in foods and beverages in 
all settings and for all segments of the population?
8. What are some innovative approaches to monitor 
food consumption (including plate waste) and ways 
to validate self-reported dietary data to enhance the 
accuracy and relevancy of diet assessment method-
ology? How should we address the urgent need for 
applying universally standardized diet assessment 
methodology in clinical, community (schools, work-
sites, faith-based settings, homeless shelters, etc), 
and research settings to better compare/contrast the 
effectiveness of various diet interventions? The field of 
human nutrition research requires standardized meth-
ods to accurately monitor sodium, added sugars, and 
SFA intakes in populations, individuals, and the food 
supply. How do we best proceed with this?
9. How can health disparities be addressed in sys-
tems science research to identify effective dietary 
interventions in different populations?
10.  
With the various contributions of the wide spectrum 
of study designs, including feeding studies/trials, 
behavioral intervention trials, and observational 
studies, how can the importance of these data be 
effectively integrated to inform future dietary guid-
ance? Feeding studies provide more conclusive 
answers to research questions about diet and dis-
ease relationships than do self-reported diet assess-
ment methods, which do not establish causality. 
How can the cost and other limitations of this type 
of research be overcome or leveraged to promote 
adherence and to achieve the most relevant results?
11.  
 
How can we educate/engage/incentivize changes 
to the supply side (agriculture/packaged goods 
and processed foods/restaurants) that will change

CoNCLUSIoNS
Achieving adherence to the AHA recommended dietary 
pattern outlined in Table 2 is a process. It can be accom-
plished by helping patients/consumers choose preferred 
foods that are familiar and enjoyed with consideration of 
cultural, economic, and social influences. By considering 
nutrient-dense choices that meet but do not exceed calo-
rie needs, individuals can achieve further weight-control 
goals. Emphasizing patient/client–tailored intervention 
that encourages self-monitoring of diet and physical ac-
tivity levels is an effective strategy for promoting great-
er acceptance and sustained adherence to the recom-
mended heart-healthy AHA dietary pattern.

Appendix 7. healthcare Providers’ Guide to Dietary 
Assessment and Counseling
1.  
Assess current diet/eating behavior (see Table 6 for assessment 
tools)
2.  
Calculate BMI and energy needs based on goals: weight loss, 
weight maintenance (see http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/
HealthyLiving/WeightManagement/BodyMassIndex/Body-Mass-
Index-In-Adults-BMI-Calculator-for-Adults_UCM_307849_Article.
jsp#)
3.  
Use Super Tracker and/or other tools (http://www.choosemyplate.
gov/supertracker-tools/supertracker.html)
4. Discuss calorie-based AHA diet recommendations (see Table 2)
5. Discuss recommended physical activity levels
6.  
Using motivational interviewing techniques, encourage patient/
client to set realistic goals for diet and physical activity adherence
7. Encourage patient/client to choose a self-monitoring plan
8. Set date for follow-up
AHA indicates American Heart Association; and BMI, body mass index. 
Appendix 8. Dining out Checklist
Eating out can be challenging when trying to follow a heart-healthy 
diet. Here are some suggestions to help you stay on track:
•  
Call ahead or go online to check out the menu of a restaurant you 
wish to consider
•  
Review dietary changes with wait staff (eg, broiled, baked, not fried)
•  
One serving of meat/chicken should be about the size of a deck of 
cards; a baked potato serving is about the size of a computer mouse; 1 
cup is about the size of a baseball; 1 tsp is about the size of your thumb
•  
Consider what you would do if cooking this at home (remove butter 
sauce, use olive oil, add fresh lemon)
•  
Send back anything that is not what you requested (too salty? 
butter added?)
•  
Watch out for salads that sound healthy but include bacon, cheese, 
fried tortilla strips, or high-fat calorie dressing
•  
If all else fails, request a vegetable plate with all the vegetables 
they are serving that day
tsp indicates teaspoon.

This table represents the relationships of reviewers that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on the 
Disclosure Questionnaire, which all reviewers are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be “significant” if (a) the person receives 
$10 000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person’s gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the voting stock or 
share of the entity, or owns $10 000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be “modest” if it is less than “significant” 
under the preceding definition.
