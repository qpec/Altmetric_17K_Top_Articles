gender.
setting British general population.
Design Complex survey analyses of data collected 
for a cross-sectional probability sample survey, 
undertaken 2010–2012, specifically logistic regression 
to calculate age-adjusted OR (AOR) to identify 
associated factors.
Participants 4839 men and 6669 women aged 16–74 
years who reported ≥1 sexual partner (opposite-sex or 
same-sex) in the past year for the third National Survey of 
Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3).
Main outcome measure Lacking interest in sex for ≥3 
months in the past year.
results Overall, 15.0% (13.9–16.2) of men and 34.2% 
(32.8–35.5) of women reported lacking interest in sex. 
This was associated with age and physical and mental 
health for both men and women, including self-reported 
general health and current depression. Lacking interest 
in sex was more prevalent among men and women 
reporting sexually transmitted infection diagnoses 
(ever), non-volitional sex (ever) and holding sexual 
attitudes related to normative expectations about sex. 
Some gender similarities in associated relationship and 
family-related factors were evident, including partner 
having had sexual difficulties in the last year (men: AOR 
1.41 (1.07–1.86); women: AOR 1.60 (1.32–1.94)), not 
feeling emotionally close to partner during sex (men: 
3.74 (1.76–7.93); women: 4.80 (2.99–7.69) and ease of 
talking about sex (men: 1.53 (1.23–1.90);women: 2.06 
(1.77–2.39)). Among women only, lack of interest in sex 
was higher among those in a relationship of >1 year in 
duration and those not sharing the same level of interest 
(4.57 (3.87–5.38)) or preferences (2.91 (2.22–3.83)) 
with a partner.
conclusions Both gender similarities and differences 
were found in factors associated with lacking interest 
in sex, with the most marked differences in relation to 
some relationship variables. Findings highlight the need to 
assess, and if appropriate, treat lacking interest in sex in a 
holistic and relationship-specific way.
IntrODuctIOn
In Britain’s third National Survey of Sexual Atti-
tudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3), lacking interest 
in sex was the most common sexual difficulty 
reported by both men and women.1 Lacking 
interest in sex for ≥3 months in the past year 
was twice as common in women compared with 
men. When duration and symptom severity 
criteria are considered (ie, that symptoms last 
≥6 
months and occur ‘very often’ or ‘always’), 
these prevalence estimates are much lower,2 
but the gender difference is maintained.
Researchers have paid more attention to 
problems of low sexual interest in women than 
in men.3–5 Among men the predominant focus 
has been on erectile functioning and on physi-
ological causes of lacking interest in sex such as 
hormonal status, rather than on psychosocial

strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This study used nationally representative data to 
investigate factors associated with reporting lacking 
interest in sex, and how these vary by gender, in the 
British population.
 
► Few previous population-based studies have 
obtained data on low sexual interest from men and 
women and made direct comparisons between 
them.
 
► The study included detailed assessment of a range of 
relationship context and attitudinal variables seldom 
included in previous population-based surveys.
 
► Information about lacking interest in sex was 
assessed with a single item, asking participants 
whether they had lacked interest in having sex 
for a period of ≥3 months in the past year. Those 
who reported this were also asked whether they 
experienced associated distress.
 
► The cross-sectional data do not allow us to establish 
the causal direction of associations between lacking 
interest in sex and variables of interest.

determinants. This lack of attention to male problems is 
reflected in recent revisions to the Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual (DSM-5) classification of sexual disorders6 
which involved major changes to sexual arousal and desire 
disorder categories in women, but no substantive changes 
for male disorders.
Most but not all studies involving men have reported an 
association between low sexual interest and increasing age 
(for review, see ref. 7). However, there are conflicting find-
ings on the association with physical and mental health.8 9 
Limited research suggests that psychosocial and relation-
ship factors may also be associated with low sexual desire 
in men.8 10–12
Among women, factors that have been consistently associ-
ated with lacking interest in sex are relationship problems, 
relationship quality and partner’s sexual functioning,13–17 
poor physical health18 and negative mood states/depres-
sion.13 18 19 There are inconsistent findings on the association 
between low sexual interest and both age and menopausal 
status.14 18 Few large-scale surveys have examined possible 
links between lacking interest in sex and either sexual atti-
tudes or sexual behaviour. In the second wave of the British 
National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-
2), among women, lacking interest in sex was associated 
with lower frequency of sex and attitudes according sex low 
priority.20
Studies have, for the most part, used small, clinical 
samples of patients seeking treatment for low sexual 
desire problems. The potential for bias in such studies 
is revealed in previously reported findings from Natsal-3 
that only around a third of men and women with one or 
more sexual function problems meeting DSM-5 morbidity 
criteria had sought professional help in the last year.2 The 
few large-scale probability-based surveys involving both 
men and women have focused on associations between 
low sexual desire and sociodemographic factors.
In summary, the evidence on the factors associated with 
men’s and women’s reports of low sexual desire is drawn 
largely from non-representative samples, is somewhat equiv-
ocal and, in men, sparse. Given that most previous research 
has involved non-representative samples, it is important to 
explore how correlates might differ in a population-based 
sample. Understanding the correlates of lacking interest in 
sex is key to informing therapeutic options for this group.
The research questions addressed in this paper are1: 
What sociodemographic, relationship, sexual behaviour 
and sexual attitudinal factors are associated with lacking 
interest in sex in sexually active men and women?2 To what 
extent do these factors vary by gender?3 To what extent 
does lacking interest in sex coexist with other sexual func-
tion problems?
MethOD
Participants and procedure
Natsal-3 is a probability sample survey of 15 162 men 
and women aged 16–74 years in Britain, interviewed 
between September 2010 and August 2012. A multistage, 
clustered and stratified probability sample design was 
used and participants were interviewed in their homes 
by professional interviewers using a combination of 
computer-assisted personal interviews and computer-as-
sisted self-interviews (CASIs) for the more sensitive ques-
tions (including, of relevance to this paper, those on 
sexual function). Interviewers were present in the room 
while participants completed the CASI, but did not view 
responses.20 After weighting to adjust for unequal proba-
bilities of selection and to match the British population 
in terms of age, gender and geographical region, the 
Natsal-3 sample was broadly representative, on key vari-
ables, of the British population as described by the 2011 
Census.21
The estimated response rate was 57.7%, and the esti-
mated cooperation rate (the number of interviews 
completed from eligible addresses for which contact was 
made) was 65.8% (of all eligible addressed contacted).22 
More extensive details of the survey methodology and 
sample characteristics are published elsewhere21 22 and 
for demographic characteristics of the sample, see ref. 22. 
Participants provided oral informed consent for interviews 
and the survey was approved by the NRES Committee 
South-Central— Oxford A (ref.: 10/H0604/27).
Only respondents who reported ≥1 sexual partner 
(opposite-sex or same-sex) in the past year (4839 men 
and 6669 women) were asked whether they had lacked 
interest in sex for a period of ≥3 months in the past year 
(see below). These participants were the focus of the 
current analyses.
Outcome measures
Items were drawn from the Natsal-SF, a measure of 
sexual function, designed and validated for population 
surveys. The measure comprises items on problems with 
sexual response, relational aspects of sexual function and 
self-appraisal of sex life.23 24 Participants who reported at 
least one sexual partner in the past year (hereon ‘sexu-
ally active participants’) were asked, In the last year, have 
you experienced any of the following for a period of ≥3 months? 
and were given a list of difficulties and asked to indicate 
which they had experienced. The list included Lacked 
interest in having sex. Those indicating this difficulty were 
defined as lacking interest in having sex for a period of 
≥3 months in the past year (the outcome for this analysis). 
Individuals reporting lacking interest in sex for at least 
3 months were then asked, And how do you feel about this? 
with response options: not at all distressed, a little distressed, 
fairly distressed and very distressed. Those answering a little, 
fairly or very distressed were defined as lacking interest in 
sex and having distress about this symptom (outcome for 
sensitivity analysis, see below).
statistical analysis
All analyses were done using the complex survey func-
tions of STATA V.14 to account for the weighting, clus-
tering and stratification of the data. We used multivariable 
logistic regression to calculate age-adjusted ORs (AORs)

to examine the associations between reports of lacking 
interest in sex lasting ≥3 months in the past year, and 
sociodemographic, health, relationship, sexual behaviour 
and sexual attitude variables. For each variable, we also 
tested the interaction with gender to see if the magni-
tude of the associations between the above factors and 
reports of lacking interest in sex was the same for men 
and women. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the 
outcome variable reporting lack of interest in sex lasting 
≥3 months and distress about this symptom to assess 
whether similar associations were found. We also exam-
ined the association between reporting lacking interest in 
sex and the other sexual function problems asked about 
in Natsal-3 using AORs.
results
Overall, 15.0% (95% CI 13.9% to 16.2%) of sexually 
active men and 34.2% (95% CI 32.8% to 35.5%) of sexu-
ally active women reported lacking interest in sex for 
≥3 months in the year prior to interview. Table 1 presents 
the associations between lacking interest in sex and socio-
demographic, health, relationship, sexual behaviour and 
sexual attitudinal variables for men and women.
Age was significantly associated with lacking interest in 
sex. Prevalence increased with age, being lowest among 
younger participants (16–24 years; men: 11.5%; women: 
24.8%) and peaking in men aged 35–44 years (17.2%) and 
in women aged 55–64 years (38.8%). Regarding demo-
graphic variables, after adjusting for age, lack of interest 
was associated with leaving school at 16 (men only; AOR 
1.31), being unemployed (men only; AOR: men: 1.44) 
and less frequent religious practice (women only; AOR 
0.79). In women, after adjusting for age, those who were 
students or retired were less likely to lack desire.
After adjusting for age, there were associations between 
all physical and mental health variables assessed and 
lacking interest in sex. Individuals in poorer health 
(AORs: men: 3.29; women: 1.93), those who had much 
difficulty walking upstairs (AOR: men: 2.68; women: 1.55), 
those with a long-standing medical condition (AOR: 
men: 1.76; women: 1.35), and those who had screened 
positive for current depression (AOR: men: 2.95; women: 
2.79) or who had been treated for depression in the past 
year (AOR: men: 2.82; women: 2.32) were more likely to 
report lacking interest in sex. The magnitude of these 
associations was similar for men and women. A greater 
number of comorbid health conditions was significantly 
associated with lacking interest in sex among both men 
and women. Menopausal status in women and circumci-
sion in men were not associated with the likelihood of 
lacking sexual interest.
Regarding sexual behaviour, among both men and 
women, lack of interest was associated with frequency 
of sexual activity (defined as vaginal, oral or anal inter-
course) in the four weeks prior to interview; 12.4% of 
men and 33.8% of women who reported having engaged 
in 3–4 sexual acts reported lack of interest versus 20.7% 
of men and 42.9% of women who reported no sexual 
activity. Associations with recent masturbation differed by 
gender; lack of interest in sex was slightly more common 
among men who reported having recently masturbated 
but less common among women who did so. Women 
with three or more partners in the past year were less 
likely to report low sexual interest than those with only 
one partner (AOR 0.70) but there was no association 
between partner numbers and lacking interest in sex in 
men. Among men only, those who reported ever having 
taken drugs to assist sexual performance were more likely 
to report lacking interest in sex (AOR 1.36). A similar 
magnitude association was seen for women (AOR 1.39); 
however, fewer women reported ever having taken drugs 
and the 95% CI therefore crosses 1.
Associations were found between lacking interest in sex 
and several relationship contextual variables and for many 
of these variables associations were stronger for women 
than for men. For both men and women, lack of interest 
was associated with relationship status; women living with 
a partner were more likely to lack interest in sex than 
those in other relationship categories (see table 1). For 
women, all relationship categories had lower AORs than 
living with partner. Duration of most recent sexual rela-
tionship was significantly associated with lacking interest 
in sex only among women, being more common among 
those in longer relationships.
Among both men and women, there was an association 
between ease of communication and lacking interest in 
sex. Those who found it ‘always easy to talk about sex’ with 
their partner were less likely to report low interest. Lack of 
interest was more likely among those whose partner had 
sexual difficulties in the last year, and those who reported 
a lower assessment of happiness with the relationship, 
and not feeling emotionally close to partner during sex. 
Among women but not men, not sharing the same level 
of sexual interest with a partner, and not sharing the same 
sexual likes and dislikes, was also associated.
Having been pregnant in the last year was associated 
with lacking sexual interest as was having one or more 
young child(ren) (women only). Lack of interest in sex 
was significantly associated with sexual health indicators, 
including previous sexually transmitted infection (STI) 
diagnosis and ever having experienced non-volitional sex. 
The strength and direction of associations was similar for 
men and women, except for reporting another sexual 
function problem, which was significant for two or more 
problems in men, but one or more problems in women. 
Sexual competence at first sex was significantly associated 
with lack of interest in sex only among women.
Regarding attitudinal variables, both men and women 
who endorsed statements that ‘people are under pressure 
to have sex’ and ‘people want less sex as they age’ were 
more likely to report lacking interest in sex over the past 
year. The only attitudinal variable that showed a signif-
icant interaction with gender was that which related to 
men having a ‘naturally higher sex drive than women’. 
Men who agreed with this statement were less likely than

Denominator is those aged 16–74

*p Value for interaction to determine whether the magnitude of association between each variable and lack of interest in sex differs between men and women.
†Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a multidimensional measure of area (neighbourhood)-level deprivation based on the participant's postcode. IMD scores for England, Scotland and Wales 
were adjusted before being combined and assigned to quintiles, using a method by Payne and Abel.50
‡Participants aged≥17 
years.
§Includes arthritis, heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina, other forms of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, broken hip or pelvis, bone or hip replacement ever, backache 
lasting >3 
months, any other muscle or bone disease lasting >3 
months, depression, cancer and any thyroid condition treated in the past year.
¶Participants were asked whether they had often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless in the past two 
weeks and whether they had often been bothered by little interest or 
pleasure in doing things in the past two 
weeks, using a validated two-question patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2).
**Opposite and/or same-sex partners.
††Other means easy with a husband or wife or regular partner, but difficult with a new partner; easy with a new partner, but difficult with a husband or wife or regular partner; difficult with any 
partner; it depends, sometimes easy and sometimes difficult.
‡‡Participants were asked to rate how happy they were in their relationship from 1 (very happy) to 7 (very unhappy); responses of 1 or 2 were regarded as denoting participants who were 
happy with their relationship.
§§A constructed variable to measure readiness, combining consensuality, autonomy of decision-making, timing and use of effective contraception.
¶¶Sexual response problems (for at least 3 months in the past year): lacked enjoyment in sex, felt anxious during sex, felt physical pain as a result of sex, felt no excitement or arousal during 
sex, difficulty in reaching climax, reached a climax more quickly than you would like, trouble getting or keep an erection (men), uncomfortably dry vagina (women).
Unwt, unweighted; wt, weighted.

those who disagreed to lack interest in sex, while the 
reverse was true among women.
Table 2 presents the associations between lacking 
interest in sex and being distressed about this (as a 
measure/marker of severity), and the above sociode-
mographic, health and sexual relationship/behaviour 
variables. While prevalence was lower, the associations 
and the interactions with gender were generally similar; 
however, some of the previous gender-specific associa-
tions with variables (eg, masturbation, and pregnancy in 
women, and education in men) were no longer signifi-
cant when the outcome variable was reported low sexual 
interest and associated distress. In addition, some asso-
ciations became stronger when considering only those 
who reported a distressing lack of interest in sex (vs lack 
of interest without any reported distress). For example, 
the association between depressive symptoms and having 
been treated for depression in the past year was stronger 
in men than in women.
Regarding the association between reporting lacking 
interest in sex and the other sexual function problems 
asked about in Natsal-3, the strongest (positive) associa-
tions were for lacking enjoyment in sex (AOR 9.78 and 
8.95 for men and women, respectively), followed by feeling 
no excitement or arousal during sex (AOR 9.21 and 9.16 
for men and women, respectively) (see table 3).
DIscussIOn
We identified a broad range of factors, including some 
that have not been explored in previous large-scale 
surveys, that were associated with men’s and women’s 
reports of lacking interest in sex in a representative 
British population-based survey. Our findings, discussed 
below, revealed some gender similarities as well as some 
interesting gender differences. The strongest evidence 
for gender differences was for the relationship context 
variables, where associations with lacking interest in sex 
were much stronger for women than for men.
Interpretation of findings in context of previous research
Our finding relating to differences by age is consistent 
with some, but not all, results from previous research 
which has yielded generally inconsistent findings. Some 
studies have, like ours, shown a higher prevalence 
of sexual interest problems in older than in younger 
women.25–27 Others have found no association between 
age and low sexual interest complaints14 28 and yet more 
have shown lack of sexual interest to be more common 
among younger women.18 Whereas we found a marginal 
relationship with age in men, some studies (though not 
all, eg, ref. 29) have found a stronger relationship.12 30 It is 
possible that the varied findings might in part be a result 
of varied definitions of low sexual interest or differences 
in sampling.
The finding in this analysis that having young chil-
dren appears to increase the likelihood of reporting lack 
of sexual interest for women, but not for men, remains

*p Value for interaction to determine whether the magnitude of association between each variable and lack of interest in sex differs between men and women.
†Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a multidimensional measure of area (neighbourhood)-level deprivation based on the participant's postcode. IMD scores for England, Scotland and Wales were adjusted before being combined and assigned to 
quintiles, using a method by Payne and Abel.50
‡Participants aged≥17

months, any other muscle or bone disease lasting 
>3 
months, depression, cancer and any thyroid condition treated in the past year.
¶Participants were asked whether they had often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless in the past two 
weeks and whether they had often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things in the past two 
weeks, using a validated 
two-question patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2).
**Opposite and/or same-sex partners.
††Other means easy with a husband or wife or regular partner, but difficult with a new partner; easy with a new partner, but difficult with a husband or wife or regular partner; difficult with any partner; it depends, sometimes easy and sometimes difficult.

unchanged since the previous Natsal-2 survey.31 This 
may be due to fatigue associated with a primary caring 
role,32 the fact that daily stress appears to affect sexual 
functioning in women more than men33 or possibly a 
shift in focus of attention attendant on bringing up small 
children.
The finding of a link between lacking interest in sex 
and lacking enjoyment in sex and/or feeling no excite-
ment or arousal during sex is not surprising and has 
been shown in previous studies.3 The strong associations 
between lack of interest in sex and physical and mental 
health indicators, which we observed for both men and 
women, are not entirely consistent with findings from 
other studies. While this link has been persuasively shown 
for women,13 18 19 in men, the evidence is more equivocal. 
In a study of men attending an outpatient clinic for sexual 
problems, psychological symptoms such as anxiety and 
depression were more predictive of low sexual desire than 
hormonal or other physical markers.11 In contrast, DeRo-
gatis et al,9 in their study of men with erectile dysfunc-
tion, observed no differences in depressive symptoms, 
concurrent illness or medication use between men with 
and without symptoms of low sexual desire.
The gender differences in associations between mastur-
bation and a lack of sexual interest are interesting and have 
been explored in few previous population-based studies. 
Our observation that lack of interest was more commonly 
reported by men who had recently masturbated, but less 
commonly reported by women who had done so, may 
reflect a tendency among women for self-pleasuring to 
be, not a substitute for partnered sex but instead a part of 
a broader repertoire of sexual fulfilment; this possibility 
is worthy of further exploration. In contrast, for men 
frequency of masturbation reflects reduced frequency 
of partnered sex.34 However, it is worth noting that in 
the U.S. National Health and Social Life Survey lifetime 
number of sexual partners and masturbation practices 
were unrelated to the likelihood of sexual desire difficul-
ties for either men or women.35
Our observation that duration of most recent sexual 
relationship showed a strong association with lacking 
interest in sex in women is consistent with previous 
studies.15 17 There has been little comparable research on 
men with which to corroborate the absence of such an 
association among men in our analysis.
Our data confirm the importance of the relational 
context in individuals’ level of sexual interest. The strong 
associations between relationship and partner factors and 
sexual interest are consistent with those shown in many 
previous studies relating to women13–17 and with a much 
smaller literature in men.36 37 In particular, sexual dysfunc-
tion in a male partner has previously been associated with 
women’s levels of sexual desire,15 38 39 and sexual desire 
discrepancy in couples has been linked to lower reported 
relationship satisfaction and more couple conflict.40
The strong links found between several key sexual 
health outcomes and lack of interest in sex are interesting; 
among both men and women, reporting an STI diagnosis 
and non-volitional sex were associated with reporting lack 
of interest in sex. Our finding that lacking ‘sexual compe-
tence’ at first sexual intercourse was linked with subse-
quent lack of interest in sex among women but not men 
may reflect a greater salience of contextual aspects of first 
sex for women. More women than men report being pres-
sured by a partner on the first occasion of heterosexual 
intercourse, and to have subsequently experienced regret 
about first sexual experiences.41 These findings suggest 
that for women early sexual experiences may shape future 
sexual encounters/relationships to a greater extent than 
for men.
To our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed 
the association between attitudes towards sexual matters 
and lack of interest in sex. Endorsing the assumption that 
‘people want less sex as they age’ was associated with lack 
of interest in both genders. It might be that this belief 
contributes to a decline in interest, or—equally plau-
sible—that those who lack interest adopt this attitude 
to avoid viewing their experience as problematic. Inter-
estingly, men who endorsed the view that ‘men have 
a higher sex drive than women’ were significantly less 
likely to report lacking interest in sex, whereas women 
who agreed with this statement were more likely to do so. 
If people responded to this statement with reference to 
their own relationship, these findings may be seen as 
making intuitive sense. The results suggest that endorsing 
stereotypical gender norms related to sex may adversely 
affect women more than men.
strengths and limitations
Strengths of our study include the use of national proba-
bility sample survey data involving both men and women 
across a wide age range.21 22 With a few exceptions (eg, 
refs.12 14 29 42), most surveys on sexual desire problems 
have sampled either men or women, precluding direct 
comparisons within the same sample. Another strength 
was the detailed and holistic examination of relationship 
context and attitudinal variables, which few previous 
studies have reported. Response rates for Natsal-3 were 
also similar to those of other major social surveys in 
Britain43 and higher than many previous surveys of sexual 
problems.35 44
Limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the 
data, which mean that we are unable to infer temporality 
and causality. The sample is representative of those resi-
dent in private households in Britain, that is, not those 
living in institutions. We included only respondents who 
reported ≥1 sexual partner (opposite-sex or same-sex) 
in the past year, excluding those who had not had sex 
because of lack of interest. We only used a single item 
to assess lacking interest in sex, although we additionally 
took account of whether those who reported this also 
reported that it caused them distress, as a way of trying to 
capture more problematic lack of interest. This sensitivity 
analysis enabled us to demonstrate that for most vari-
ables similar associations exist regardless of whether or 
not distress was reported. It is important to acknowledge,

however, that these data do not necessarily correspond to 
clinical diagnoses. Finally, we have tested many associa-
tions within this study and some will have been significant 
by chance. These were exploratory and descriptive anal-
yses of zero-order relationships and therefore some of the 
smaller effect sizes may not replicate and may not hold in 
multivariable analyses.
Implications for research and practice
The findings indicate that lack of interest in sex is asso-
ciated with a broad range of factors across sociode-
mographic, relationship, sexual behaviour and sexual 
attitudinal domains. There are both research and clinical 
applications of our results.
First, our findings underscore the importance of the 
relational context in understanding low sexual interest 
in both men and women. For women in particular, the 
experience of sexual interest appears strongly linked with 
their perceptions of the quality of their relationships, 
their communication with partners and their expecta-
tions/attitudes about sex. Our findings support the view 
that transient (and often adaptive) reductions in sexual 
desire are not evidence of ‘dysfunction’.45
In the context of the recent US Food and Drug Admin-
istration approval of flibanserin, the first drug to treat 
low sexual desire in women,46 these findings are relevant 
to the current debate about whether striving for a phar-
maceutical solution to women’s sexual desire problems 
is an appropriate and feasible goal.45 47 Some authors 
have suggested that women with complaints of low sexual 
interest might benefit most from integrative approaches 
that accord with a biopsychosocial model.48
Second, our findings on the strong association between 
open sexual communication (ie, ‘finding it always easy 
to talk about sex’) and a reduced likelihood of reporting 
lack of interest in sex, particularly for women, empha-
sise the importance of providing a broad sexual and 
relationships education, rather than limiting attention 
only to adverse consequences of sex and how to prevent 
them. Similarly, the important role of early sexual expe-
riences, and sexual ‘competence’, especially for women, 
in shaping later experiences of sexual desire supports the 
need for comprehensive sex education.
In a clinical context, our findings emphasise the impor-
tance of healthcare professionals assessing psychological 
and interpersonal variables in individuals presenting with 
complaints of low sexual interest.49 In couple therapy, 
it is important that therapists have an awareness of the 
differences between men and women in the factors asso-
ciated with low sexual interest. For example, among the 
subgroup of participants reporting both lack of interest 
in sex and related distress, we found a stronger associ-
ation between depressive symptoms and treatment for 
depression in the last year among men compared with 
women. Lastly, our findings support previous research on 
the critical role of physical and mental health in under-
standing low sexual interest problems experienced by 
men and women.11 18
cOnclusIOns
This study extends our understanding of the factors asso-
ciated with lack of interest in sex in men and women, the 
gender similarities and differences, and highlights the 
need to assess and—if necessary—treat sexual desire prob-
lems in a holistic and relationship, as well as gender-spe-
cific way.
