Crisis resolution home treatment (CRHT) teams were
introduced by the National Health Service (NHS) to provide
intensive treatment at home for individuals experiencing an
acute mental health crisis and who would otherwise be
admitted to hospital care. The intended value was for
CRHT teams to act as gatekeepers to relieve the pressure on
in-patient services, not only through reducing admissions
but also by supporting the early discharge of patients from
acute wards to home treatment. Following the successful
development of crisis intervention models in North America

Summary
Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the use of crisis
resolution home treatment (CRHT) teams as an alternative to psychiatric in-patient
admission. We discuss the functions of these services and their effectiveness. Our
research suggests high rates of suicide in patients under CRHT. Specific strategies
need to be developed to improve patient safety in this setting.

a key setting for patient safety

 and Australia in the early 1990s, the NHS Plan included a
policy
mandating
the
establishment
of
these
teams
throughout England.1 Targets set within the plan included
developing 335 crisis teams by 2004 and delivering home
treatment to 100 000 people by 2005. These targets helped
bring about a relatively rapid implementation of these
services nationwide. They are now available in every trust in
England and receive significant NHS investment each year.2
Although flexibility exists, the guidelines from the
Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide3 recommended
CRHT services for adults aged 18-65 with severe mental
illness who would ordinarily require admission to hospital.
Typically, CRHT is offered to individuals diagnosed with
schizophrenia and affective disorders and excludes those with
primary diagnoses of alcohol or drug misuse, personality
disorder or intellectual disability. Other key features of
CRHT may include 24-hour availability during a crisis,
intensive intervention in the early stages of the crisis, and
active involvement until the crisis resolves. A core principle
of these services is successful engagement with the patient
and involvement with the individual’s family and social
network in the care management plans. Patients are also
provided with practical help with social issues, such as
financial, housing and childcare arrangements. This holistic
approach
has
contributed
to
the
increase
in
patient
satisfaction associated with receiving care under CRHT,4
along with remaining in a familiar environment and the
reduction in stigma attached to psychiatric admission.5,6 In
addition, treatment under CRHT could reduce the need for
out-of-area placements - a growing issue within mental
health services. Despite these benefits, criticism has been
made that CRHT teams are understaffed and patients
experience long waiting times before receiving care, often
being seen by several different team members.7 The
gatekeeping role of CRHT services means patients some-
times no longer have the option of choosing to be admitted
to hospital, despite some individuals preferring to be treated
away from home and the environment that may have
triggered the crisis.
The effectiveness of CRHT services has often been
examined through assessing their role as gatekeepers and
examining changes in admission rates. For example, Jethwa
and colleagues8 reported a 37.5% reduction in monthly
admissions after the introduction of CRHT, whereas Jacobs
& Barrenho9 found no impact of these services on admission
rates. The only UK randomised controlled trial found CRHT
users were less likely to be admitted to hospital in the 8
weeks post-crisis compared with the control group receiving
standard care from in-patient services and community
mental health teams.10 However, a national picture of the
efficacy of CRHT in terms of admission rates or gatekeeping
is difficult to establish with the great variation between
healthcare
providers
in
CRHT
service
delivery.11
For
example, around a third of CRHT teams do not function
as gatekeepers to acute in-patient beds,11,12 whereas a report
for the National Audit Office found around half of all
discharges were not facilitated by CRHT services.13
Published evidence on the outcomes of patients under
CRHT is limited, particularly with regard to patient safety
and serious untoward incidents, including suicide. Studies
from the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and
Homicide by People with Mental Illness (NCISH) have
demonstrated that although there has been a significant fall
in the number and rate of in-patient suicide over the past
decade, there has been a corresponding increase in the
number of patient suicide deaths under CRHT.14 There are
now three times as many suicides under CRHT each year
compared with in-patient suicides.15 This is not unexpected
given the expanding provision of home treatment services
and the reduction in hospital admissions. Reassuringly,
however, the rate of suicide under CRHT has not increased
and has shown a decline between 2003 and 2011.16 This
would suggest that perhaps some of the safety concerns in
CRHTs are being addressed. NCISH findings have also
demonstrated that NHS trusts which have introduced
24-hour crisis teams have lower suicide rates compared
with areas without these services.17
Despite the potential for CRHT to reduce suicide risk,
one concern is the possibility that suicide rates are higher in
the CRHT setting than the in-patient setting. In our recent
study of suicides between 2003 and 2011, we found that the
crude rate of suicide among CRHT patients over this period
was 14.6 per 10 000 CRHT episodes compared with 8.8
suicides per 10 000 admissions for in-patients.16 These rates
do not take into account the varying CRHT service models
or adjust for case mix or other patient confounders, but
reflect overall aggregate national effects. One explanation
could be time at risk - if the length of care under CRHT is
longer than an in-patient stay this could explain the
findings. When we tried to take this into account (by
including national estimates of the duration of treatment),
the risk under CRHT remained substantially higher than
the risk under in-patient care. However, we could not adjust
for length of time before and after admission as robust
time-at-risk data were not available. The higher rates under
CRHT may be indicative of the more intensive treatment
and increased staff availability that an admission brings, but
could also reflect that the case-loads of CRHT teams
increasingly include some of the most acutely ill patients.
NCISH findings have shown a high prevalence of known
suicide risk factors among patients under CRHT who have
subsequently died by suicide, including adverse life events
(49%), living alone (44%) or recent discharge from in-patient
care (34%).16 This raises the question on the suitability of
home treatment for vulnerable patients with limited social
support or who return to a home environment that has the
potential to exacerbate a mental health crisis. We have also
recently shown that between 2012 and 2013, 37% of patients
who died by suicide under CRHT had been under these
services for less than 1 week which may reflect the acuteness
and severity of illness.15 Changes in service provision may
have increased levels of morbidity in admitted and post-
discharge populations and the use of CRHT following
discharge might mean that some admissions are shortened
beyond what is safe. Our previous controlled study on
suicide within 2 weeks of discharge found a link between
post-discharge deaths and an admission lasting less than
7 days.18
What lies ahead for CRHT? Financial pressures could
have contributed to a recent trend for trusts to merge their
specialist teams, such as CRHT or early intervention with
generic community mental health services. However, given

 the potential benefits of the CRHT model, mental health
services should ensure these teams remain a unique
treatment option but with effective liaison with in-patient
and community mental health services. Variations between
providers in CRHT service delivery is of concern and may
reflect uncertainties in the evidence base. Guidelines for
national standardisation of practice may help to improve
the quality of care, especially if these are rooted in sound
research. Service developments in crisis home treatment
need to be monitored carefully with respect to patient
safety to ensure that the right care is being delivered to the
right patients.
