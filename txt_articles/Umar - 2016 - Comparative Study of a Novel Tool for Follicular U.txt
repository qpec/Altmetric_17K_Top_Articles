F
ollicular unit extraction (FUE) is a minimally in-
vasive method of hair transplantation that avoids 
the creation of a linear scar and is increasingly the 
method of choice for patients. To date, conventional FUE 
involves the use of sharp- or dull-edged punches to score 
around the hair follicles at varying depths to substantially 
free it from tissue attachments. This scoring is done by a 
complete, partial, or oscillatory rotary cutting action cre-
ated by a tubular punch edge circled around the follicle. 
The cutting action in these methods follows a transverse 
axial plane relative to the follicular shaft. After scoring, 
the follicle is pulled free using fine forceps with or without 
the aid of further dissection of any remaining tissue at-
tachments of tethered grafts.
Practitioners of conventional FUE are aware of the 
challenges posed by hair curliness and tissue characteris-
tics that may cause traumatic damage to extracted grafts. 
The damage is quantified by the transection rate, defined 
as the ratio of the number of extracted follicles that are 
accidentally cut and damaged during FUE to the total 
number of grafts extracted. As a result, patients with tight-
ly curled hair are often considered poor candidates for 
conventional FUE.1–4 Most patients with the most tightly 
curled hair are of African descent5–7 but these individuals 
are not a homogenous group, with variation in degree of

Background: Hair transplantation involving patients with tightly curled Afro-tex-
tured hair using follicular unit extraction (FUE) employing conventional rotary 
punches frequently leads to unacceptably high transection rates. These patients 
are unsuitable candidates for FUE hair transplantation. Transection rates were ob-
served during FUE in a case series of 18 patients with tightly curled Afro-textured 
hair using different punches.
Methods: Three different punches were sequentially used in patients to extract 
follicular units with several needle gauges until satisfactory transection rates oc-
curred: conventional sharp and dull rotary punches, followed by a 2-pronged 
curved nonrotary punch.
Results: In all instances, the curved nonrotary punch had the best transection rate 
of <5%. Sharp and dull rotary punches completely failed or had excessive transec-
tion rates in 8 patients. The dull rotary punch performed better than the sharp 
rotary punch in 9 patients in whom it was used with few restrictions compared to 5 
patients in whom there were more restrictions.
Conclusions: A curved nonrotary punch configured to accommodate the curliness 
of tightly curled Afro-textured hair can overcome high transection rates experi-
enced using conventional sharp or dull rotary punches. Limitations of this study 
include it being a small, retrospective case series, and that the new technique that 
could require additional training by current FUE hair transplant practitioners.

curliness between groups from different countries.5,6 Vari-
ations also exist in the same individual when hair is taken 
from different scalp regions.7 All these variations reflect 
both ethnic mixing (often for Africans in diaspora such as 
the United States and the Caribbean) that has occurred 
over generations and genetic variations that track closely 
the migratory paths taken in the out-of-Africa migration 
that occurred over 100,000 years ago.5–7 This issue pres-
ents a special challenge for most men with tightly curled 
Afro-textured hair who seek hair transplants and typically 
prefer a shorter haircut; these individuals stand to benefit 
the most from having an FUE procedure to avoid a linear 
scar associated with follicular unit strip surgery.
Whether an Afro-textured–haired patient is a good 
candidate for FUE is uncertain; hence, some FUE provid-
ers conduct a small initial test in which the surgeon takes 
out a few (about 100) grafts from the donor area and then 
evaluates how many complete/incomplete follicular units 
are extracted. This test requirement comes with some in-
conveniences to the patient, who has to schedule an ad-
ditional procedure if successful.
In a single case report, Singh and Avram3 suggested 
methods for improving the transection rate of conven-
tional FUE in Afro-textured hair that included (1) limit-
ing the depth of the first score incision and (2) increasing 
the punch size to a diameter that is large enough to en-
compass the amplitude of the subcutaneous curl wave of 
the follicle (greater than the diameter of the C). However, 
in Dr Umar’s experience, substantially limiting the depth 
of the initial score increases the effort needed to separate 
the remaining tissue attachments of the follicle, causing 
increased stress and trauma to the grafts and significantly 
increasing surgery time. In addition, increasing punch 
sizes to accommodate the subcutaneous amplitude of the 
curl wave of the grafts could result in unacceptably large 
punch sizes, having to be deployed in many instances in 
which the diameter of the C is significant (3–4 mm or 
more in some patients; Fig. 1) with the risk of unaccept-
able scarring sequelae.
The objective of this retrospective study is to present 
the author’s experience in using a novel tool and meth-
odology for performing FUE in Afro-textured hair and 
quantification of the transection rate of the extracted hair 
shafts using different approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was a retrospective case series of outcomes 
in 18 patients of African descent or nationalities with 
tightly curled Afro-textured hair who underwent an FUE 
procedure between January 14, 2014, and November 14, 
2015, at the author’s dermatology clinic. Written informed 
consent for surgery was obtained.
General FUE Technique
In each patient, punches were tried in the following 
sequential order until a satisfactory transection rate was 
attained: sharp rotary punches (18, 17, and 16 gauge), 
dull rotary punches (17 and 16 gauge), and curved non-
rotary punches (17 and 16-gauge). When success was first 
achieved with a rotary sharp or dull punch (satisfactory 
transection rate with no restrictions on donor area), the 
procedure was considered complete with the smallest 
sharp or dull punch that worked best. However, a test ex-
traction of 100 or more grafts was also then conducted 
with the curved nonrotary punch.
In all instances, FUE was accomplished under local 
anesthesia by subcutaneous injections of epinephrine 
(1:100,000) and lidocaine 1%, and bupivacaine hydro-
chloride 0.25% without tumescence. For recipient graft-
ing, slits were created by means of blades that are custom 
sized to the dimensions of the extracted grafts. Main out-
comes were transection rates of extracted hair shafts for 
each of the approaches tried for each patient.
Rotary Punch Technique (Sharp and Dull)
The general technique used by the author for FUE 
by the rotary punches has been described previously.8 In 
brief, the punch was mounted on an electromechanical 
drill that rotates the punch, such that when the punch 
edge is applied circumferentially around the hair follicles, 
it creates an incision that scores along a transverse axis 
to substantially separate the grafts from its surrounding 
tissue attachments. Next, hair follicles were subsequently 
removed with the occasional assistance of hypodermic 
needle-tip dissection and placed in chilled Ringer’s lac-
tate solution. The rotary punches used by the author con-
sisted of custom-fabricated hypodermic needles whose tips 
were modified to impart a circumferential flare outward 
to form a punch-like instrument (UPunch Rotor, fabricat-
ed in the author’s office). Because the axis of the punch-
cutting edges is directed away from the follicles (Fig. 2), 
much of the customary graft damage that accompanies 
use of straight punches is minimzed.8 Sharp punches were

ied patient. the diameter of c is >3 mm in many of the grafts.

constructed from 16-, 17-, or 18-gauge needles, whereas 
dull punches were fabricated from 16- or 17-gauge nee-
dles (Fig. 2). Grafts were irrigated at the time of scoring 
using an automated device (UGraft Revolution prototype 
by Keck Craig, Inc., Pasadena, Calif.).
Nonrotary Curved Punch Technique (Nonrotary)
Nonrotary curved punches (the UPunch Curl) were 
developed by the author and prototyped by Keck Craig, 
Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.; Fig. 2). The two tips of the prongs 
are positioned to straddle either side of the follicle to a 
skin depth of 1–2 mm at angles of 10–15 degrees from the 
scalp plane. The long axis of the punch is first aligned 
with the direction of the hair as it exits the skin. The tip 
of the hook-shaped punch is plunged subcutaneously in a 
quick, arc-like motion that follows the general curl of the 
curved punch tip. The cutting axis thus tracks the longitu-
dinal axis of the curled hair follicle shaft subcutaneously. 
The punch is pushed to the base of the follicles or even 
deeper, at which point the follicle is seen to pop out of the 
skin. Typically, the follicle stays loosely tethered to the ex-
traction hole and is easily pulled out using microvascular 
forceps. Alternatively, it can attach to the punch, in which 
case the fluid mechanism is employed to flush the graft 
into a Petri dish by aid of a foot-pedal-activated flushing 
system that discharges a pulse of physiologic solution to 
the tip of the punch (Fig. 3). In both instances, no further 
dissection is typically required.
Mechanistic Differences between Rotary FUE Punches and 
the Curved Nonrotary Punch
Rotary punches have a cutting edge (sharp, blunt, flat, 
or serrated) that runs through the entire circumference 
of the tube on the same plane. Thus, the cutting action of 
the rotary punches is along a transverse axis generated by 
rotary or oscillatory motion of the cutting edge along the 
complete circumference of the circular edge. The circular 
cut is carried down the long axis of the hair follicle from 
the skin surface toward the hair bulb. If the graft is tightly 
curled as is the case in many Afro-textured hair, it is sus-
ceptible to transection. The curved nonrotary punch has 
a tip that is configured to make allowance for the curliness 
of the hair, with a strategically situated U-shaped cut along 
the circumference of the tubular edge. This is further 
aided by the cutting action generated in a plunging ac-
tion along the longitudinal axis of the curled follicle shaft, 
thus approximating better the natural curly subcutaneous 
course of the follicle (Fig. 3).
RESULTS
Patient 10
A 48-year-old male patient from the Bahamas with 
tightly curled Afro-textured hair presented with Norwood 
3 (NW3) androgenic alopecia for FUE-type hair transplant 
to avoid the linear scarring of follicular unit strip surgery. 
The use of a 17-gauge sharp rotary punch mounted on a 
rotary device resulted in <10% transection rate in a 5–6 cm 
corridor of the mid-occipital areas. The transection rate, 
however, rose significantly (60%–80%) when extractions 
were carried into safe donor areas (SDAs) lateral to this 
narrow corridor toward the parietal areas. The transection

rate remained similarly high with the use of a dull version 
of the 17- and 16-gauge rotary punches. However, when a 
17-gauge nonrotary curved punch was deployed, a transec-
tion rate of <5% in all the areas of the SDA was observed.
Patient 7
A 27-year-old male patient from Cameroun with tightly 
curled Afro-textured hair presented with NW3 androgen-
ic alopecia for FUE-type hair transplantation (Fig. 4). He 
also had linear scarring from an earlier failed follicular 
unit strip surgery. The use of a 17- and 16-gauge sharp 
punch resulted in ~90% transection rate in all areas of the 
SDA. The use of a dull rotary punch (16 gauge) improved 
the transection rate to about 20%, but a 17-gauge nonro-
tary curved punch resulted in a transection rate of <5% 
in all areas of the SDA. After 2 surgeries about 7 months 
apart in which 1,042 and 652 hair grafts were transplant-
ed, respectively (Figs. 5 and 6), the patient’s hairline was 
restored (Fig. 7) with the donor areas being perfectly pre-
sentable.
Patient 3
A 42-year-old African American patient with nonin-
flammatory cicatricial alopecia previously underwent a 
conventional FUE elsewhere with disappointing results 
(Fig. 8). Use of a 16-gauge sharp and dull rotary punch 
resulted in high transection rate of >80%. Upon using the 
16-gauge curved nonrotary punch, however, the transec-
tion rate was dramatically reduced to <5% throughout the 
SDA with satisfactory result and growth reported at 1 year 
after 2 surgeries (Figs. 9 and 10).
All Results
A successful transection rate was considered <10% for 
the 18 patients in this case series, defined before analysis 
of the patient data. The sharp and dull rotary punches 
did not work at all or had excessive transection rates for 
8 patients, with results vastly superior when the nonro-
tary curved punch was used (Table 1). The dull rotary 
punch performed better than the sharp rotary punch 
in 9 patients in whom it was used with few restrictions 
when compared to 5 patients in whom it was used with 
more restrictions; in all these instances, the curved non-
rotary punch had the best transection rate of <5%. Rotary 
punches (sharp and/or dull) were completely successful 
in only 4 patients.
DISCUSSION
In all patients in whom the curved punch was even-
tually used, the transection rate was <10%, and in each 
individual case of curved punch success, both sharp and 
dull punches failed after maxing out their sizes with 
16-gauge punches. This is the first evidence for elimi-
nating the consideration of punch size as the cause for 
the difference in performance and transection rates. In 
all patients in whom the curved punch was used, the ap-
proach for initially limiting the depth of the first score 
using rotary punches (sharp or dull) also failed as it did 
not improve the graft attrition rate. This approach like-
ly failed because in these patients, the skin is so thick 
that the amount of manipulation required to carry the

dissection and release the graft from its attachments is 
very high, resulting in grafts that are transected in the 
process.
The observation that Afro-textured–haired individu-
als responded variably to two different tools (rotary versus 
nonrotary curved punch) supports earlier studies,5,6 which 
established that worldwide, hair of African-heritage indi-
viduals are by no means homogenous. This is due to either 
mixed ethnic heritage or phenotypic changes that are seen 
in populations situated in transition zones along the out-of-

Africa migration paths that go back more than 100,000 years 
ago. The author’s findings (Table 1) suggest that Afro-tex-
tured–haired individuals in diaspora with higher chances of 
ethnically mixed heritage (eg, African Americans or Carib-
beans) and those who originate from the out-of-Africa mi-
gration transition zones (Ethiopians and Somalians) have a

higher chance of responding to conventional rotary punches 
as their follicles tend to be less tightly curled and skin thin-
ner. Furthermore, the variable response to the different tools 
from one area of the SDA to the other in the same individual 
(as in patient 1) is supported by the findings of earlier stud-
ies.6
Although a very small number, there appears to be an 
anecdotal correlation between the coexistence of acne ke-
loidalis nuchae (AKN) and a high failure rate of rotary 
punches in FUE techniques. Although the curved punch 
was successful in all 5 AKN patients, all failed the sharp 
FUE punch technique and only 1 was successfully done 
using a dull rotary punch. In addition, the skin in AKN pa-
tients was relatively tougher and the hair was curlier sub-
cutaneously compared to the rest of the group (non-AKN 
patients). In the cases studied thus far, the transection rate 
for the curved nonrotary punch throughout the SDA in all 
Afro-textured–haired patients is typically <5%, although 
in especially challenging patients with AKN, it is <10%. 
These data suggest that the nonrotary curved punch can 
be reliably used in FUE procedures for all Afro-textured–
haired patients, including the kinkiest-haired patients 
with coexisting AKN lesions, without the need for pretest-
ing. Furthermore, the curved nonrotary punch procedure 
is a 1-step FUE method that involves complete separation 
of the follicle from its attachments in single cutting action, 
with minimal need for further dissection and trauma/
stress to the grafts. Moreover, there was never any need to 
exceed the 16-gauge size regardless of the subcutaneous 
follicular curl wave amplitude (diameter of the C).
Limitations of this study are that it is a small, retrospec-
tive case series limited to men and a larger study would 
be needed to determine the proportions of patients who 
would respond to rotary punches. It is also a new technique 
(manual procedure that has not been automated), which 
could require additional training by current FUE practi-
tioners. The author has also observed that this method is 
most consistent when the extraction areas are restricted 
to the SDA and the areas above it. Zones found inferior to 
the SDA tend to result in increased transection rates. This 
would thus limit the use of nape and periauricular hair 
follicles and all the potential benefits accruing from it.8–10
CONCLUSIONS
Use of a nonrotary curved punch with a tip configured 
to accommodate the curliness of tightly curled hair can 
overcome the high transection rates experienced when 
using more conventional sharp or dull rotary punches or 
when these kinds of punches are found to have limitations 
with specific patients whose hair curliness causes unsatis-
factory transection rates.
