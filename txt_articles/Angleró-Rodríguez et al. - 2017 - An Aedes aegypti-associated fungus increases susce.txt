Abstract Transmission of dengue virus (DENV) requires successful completion of the infection
cycle in the Aedes aegypti vector, which is initiated in the midgut tissue after ingestion of an
infectious blood meal. While certain Ae. aegypti midgut-associated bacteria influence virus
infection, little is known about the midgut-associated fungi (mycobiota), and how its members
might influence susceptibility to DENV infection. We show that a Talaromyces (Tsp_PR) fungus,
isolated from field-caught Ae. aegypti, render the mosquito more permissive to DENV infection.
This modulation is attributed to a profound down-regulation of digestive enzyme genes and trypsin
activity, upon exposure to Tsp_PR-secreted factors. In conclusion, we show for the first time that a
natural mosquito gut-associated fungus can alter Ae. aegypti physiology in a way that facilitates
pathogen infection.

Introduction
Arthropod-borne viral diseases have an enormous global public health impact. While dengue virus
(DENV) remains the most important arbovirus worldwide, the recent emergence of Chikungunya and
Zika virus have exacerbated the impact of Aedes-transmitted diseases. The mosquito Aedes aegypti
is the principal vector of DENV. Successful transmission of the virus requires completion of its infec-
tion cycle in the mosquito, beginning in the midgut tissue and eventually ending up in the saliva,
through which it can be introduced into a new host.
The mosquito acquires the virus through a blood meal from an infected vertebrate host. The
blood is digested in the insect’s midgut through the enzymatic action of a variety of proteolytic
enzymes and provides the necessary nutrients for egg production (Noriega and Wells, 1999). The
proteolytic activity of the midgut impairs DENV infection, and specific trypsins are associated with
this modulation of susceptibility (Brackney et al., 2008; Molina-Cruz et al., 2005). In the midgut
lumen, the virus also encounters a variety of microorganism, which constitutes the vector midgut
microbiota. Studies have shown that some bacterial species can inhibit DENV infection and other
human pathogens (Bahia et al., 2014; Dennison et al., 2014; Ramirez et al., 2012, 2014). However,
the midgut microbiota also comprises fungi, but little is yet known about the mosquito’s mycobiome
(Anglero
´-Rodrı
´guez et al., 2016; da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998; da S Pereira et al., 2009). Most
studies have focused on entomopathogenic fungi for use in mosquito control (Dong et al., 2012;
Scholte et al., 2007). Fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, especially in tropical regions, and
studies have shown the association of filamentous fungi, including Talaromyces species with various
vectors of human pathogens (Akhoundi et al., 2012; da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998; da S Pereira
et al., 2009; Jaber et al., 2016; Marti et al., 2007).

RESEARCH ARTICLE
 In the present study, we have identified a Talaromyces species fungus from Puerto Rico (Tsp_PR)
from the midgut of field-caught Ae. aegypti that renders the mosquitoes more susceptible to DENV
infection, through transcriptional and enzymatic inhibition of trypsin enzymes.
Results
An Ae. aegypti gut-associated Tsp_PR fungus augments DENV infection
of the mosquito midgut
Adult female Aedes sp. mosquitoes were collected in the dengue endemic Maunabo region of
southeastern Puerto Rico. After surface sterilization of mosquitoes, the midguts were dissected and
plated on agar for fungal growth. Among the isolated fungi, we identified a Talaromyces species
fungus and characterized at the microscopic (Figure 1) and molecular levels. Sequence analysis using
the rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) showed a 100% similarity to the fungus Talaromyces spe-
cies and 99% Penicillium species. Talaromyces is often classified as a Penicillium species classifica-
tion, since in 2011, species in the Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium were reclassified as Talaromyces
(Pitt, 2014). To address the ability of Tsp_PR to colonize the mosquito midgut, we fed mosquitoes
on fungus spore-laced sugar solution for 2 days, and then monitored the total fungus colony-forming
units (CFUs) in the whole mosquito and midguts for 25 days (Figure 2A,B, Figure 2—source data
1). Tsp_PR was detected in the whole fungus-exposed mosquitoes and midguts during the entire
time course. The assay also identified a small number of fungi in the control mosquito cohort but not
Tsp_PR. We also investigated whether the presence of the fungus in the mosquito gut had any effect
on mosquito longevity. Introduction of the live Tsp_PR spores through sugar feeding for 2 days did
not affect mosquito survival up to 38 days (p=0.3073) (Figure 2C, Figure 2—source data 1).
To investigate whether the presence of Tsp_PR in the mosquito midgut can modulate susceptibil-
ity to DENV infection, we introduced whole fungus spores to Ae. aegypti mosquitoes via feeding on
a spore-containing sugar solution prior to a DENV-infected blood meal (Figure 2C,D, Figure 2—
source data 1). Two mosquito strains were used: the DENV-susceptible Rockefeller strain and the
partly resistant Orlando strain (Sim et al., 2013). Seven days after DENV infection, midguts were dis-
sected, and DENV titers were enumerated. Spore ingestion by Rockefeller and Orlando strains
females resulted in a significant (p<0.001) increased DENV infection. Upon spore ingestion, both
mosquito strains showed an increased DENV infection prevalence, as a measure of the proportion of
mosquitoes that were infected, however it was only significantly higher in the Orlando strain. Further
studies were performed in the Orlando strain.
Talaromyces sp. and related fungi are known to produce a variety of secondary metabolites and
proteins (Bara et al., 2013; Klitgaard et al., 2014). It was unclear whether the influence of Tsp_PR
on Ae. aegypti’s susceptibility to DENV required the presence of whole live fungi or was mediated
by a secreted factor. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we prepared a sucrose suspen-
sion of the Tsp_PR secretome containing a filtered fungus culture without spores and mycelia. Mos-
quitoes were fed on this suspension prior to the ingestion of DENV-infected blood (Figure 3A,
Figure 3—source data 1). In a separate experiment, mosquitoes were fed on a sugar solution con-
taining a heat-treated fungus secretome preparation prior to ingestion of DENV-infected blood, in
order to address the nature of the factor(s) that influence DENV infection (Figure 3B, Figure 3—
source data 1). Mosquitoes that had ingested the fungus secretome-containing solution showed a
significantly increased virus infection (p=0.002). In contrast, the heat-treated solution did not
enhance DENV infection of the mosquito midgut (p=0.548). Taken together, these findings indicate
that Tsp_PR secretes one or more heat-sensitive molecules that enhance DENV infection in Ae.
aegypti midguts.
Mosquito are exposed to a variety of fungi in nature. In order to test whether the Tsp_PR-medi-
ated increase of DENV infection is fungus-specific, we performed fungus-exposure and DENV infec-
tion assays with a Penicillium chrysogenum that had also been isolated from field-caught
mosquitoes. Feeding mosquitoes on whole P. chrysogenum conidia, or culture filtrates, did not
affect DENV infection (p=0.829, p=0.867, respectively) (Figure 4A,B, Figure 4—source data 1). We
have previously associated P. chrysogenum with an enhancement of Plasmodium infection in Anoph-
eles gambiae (Anglero
´-Rodrı
´guez et al., 2016). To test whether Tsp_PR could influence malaria par-
asite infection in its vector we provided Tsp_PR to An. gambiae mosquitoes prior to infection with

 Plasmodium falciparum, and this resulted in increases parasite oocysts numbers on the mosquito gut
(p=0.015) (Figure 4C, Figure 4—source data 1). These results show that Tsp_PR can enhance infec-
tion of different human pathogens in different mosquito vectors.
Tsp_PR-secreted factor(s) do not affect the mosquito midgut
microbiota or DENV infection of aseptic mosquitoes
Some species of Tsp_PR and the closely related Penicillium are known to produce bioactive com-
pounds with anti-bacterial activity (Bara et al., 2013; Klitgaard et al., 2014). To investigate whether
Tsp_PR produces antibacterial factors, we performed a bacterial growth inhibition assay by a disc
diffusion antibiotic sensitivity test (Figure 5A). We examined possible Tsp_PR-mediated growth inhi-
bition of the following bacteria isolated from field-caught mosquito midguts (Ramirez et al., 2012):
the three Gram-negative bacteria Serratia marcescens, Chromobacterium haemolyticum, and Enter-
obacter hormaechei; and the three Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus capprae,
and Lactococcus lactis. The disk soaked in the Tsp_PR secretome solution did not show any growth
inhibitory activity for any of the six tested bacteria, when compared to an antibiotic control.
To investigate whether Tsp_PR-secreted molecules can influence the mosquito midgut bacterial
load, we quantified the total cultivable bacteria of the midguts of fungus secretome-exposed and
non-exposed mosquitoes using CFU assays (Figure 5B, Figure 5—source data 1). Exposure to the
Tsp_PR secretome did not affect the total bacterial midgut load (p=0.147). Previous studies showed
that reduction or elimination of the mosquito midgut microbiota, through antibiotic-treatment,
(aseptic mosquitoes) significantly increases susceptibility to DENV in Ae. aegypti (Xi et al., 2008).
Next, we tested whether the fungus-secretome would influence DENV infection of aseptic mosqui-
toes (Figure 5C, Figure 5—source data 1). Tsp_PR secretome-fed aseptic mosquitoes did not differ
from the aseptic control cohort with regards to DENV infection intensity (p=0.867), while it showed
a slightly higher but non-significant, infection prevalence. These data suggest that a bacteria-related
factor may in some way influence the fungus-mediated effect on DENV infection.

 mosquitoes reveled regulation (23 up-regulated
and 22 down-regulated) of a variety of genes
belonging to different functional classes (Table 1)
(Figure 6A). Forty-eight percent (11 genes) dis-
playing
increased
transcript
abundance
after
exposure to the Tsp_PR secretome belonged to
the redox class and are putatively involved in vari-
ous oxidoreductive processes, including detoxifi-
cation. As many as 82% (9 genes) of this redox
class encoded cytochrome P450 proteins, sug-
gesting that the fungus activates the detoxifica-
tion
machinery
in
the
mosquito
midgut.
A
significant proportion (55%, 12 genes) of the 22
down-regulated genes were functionally related
to blood digestion, and predominantly proteoly-
sis (41%) (Table 1) (Figure 6B). Twenty-two per-
cent of the total down-regulated genes encoded
trypsins. These results suggest that the Tsp_PR
secretome causes an impairment of the mosqui-
to’s ability to digest the blood meal.
Fungus-secreted molecules impair
trypsin activity of the Ae. aegypti
midgut
Earlier studies have shown that mosquito ovary
development is correlated with the amount of
digested blood and reabsorption of nutrients for
egg production (Bryant et al., 2010; Lea et al.,
1978). Poor digestion of the blood meal there-
fore results in decreased ovary development.
Hence, ovary development after blood feeding
can serve as a proxy assay for blood-digestion
efficiency. We
performed an assay
in
which
Tsp_PR
secretome-exposed
and
subsequently
blood-fed mosquitoes were microscopically eval-
uated for ovary follicle developmental stage after
a
non-infectious
blood
meal.
Mosquitoes
exposed for 48 hr to the fungus secretome prior
to
blood
feeding
showed
a
significantly
decreased in ovary development (p=0.025). Only
9% of the mosquitoes had fully developed ovary
follicles (Figure 7A, Figure 7—source data 1); in
contrast, untreated mosquitoes had a higher level
(29%) of fully ovary follicle development. We
also, examined the mosquito body weight at 1 hr
and 4 hr after a blood meal. Mosquitoes treated
with Tsp_PR secretome were heavier than non-
treated mosquitoes at 48 hr post-blood meal,
indicating
impairment
of
blood
digestion
(p=0.001) (Figure 7B, Figure 7—source data 1).
Following blood ingestion, gut epithelial cells
synthesize and secrete diverse enzymes to digest the protein-rich meal (Borovsky, 2003). Trypsin
activity accounts for most of the proteolytic activity during the mosquito’s digestion of blood (Baril-
las-Mury et al., 1995; Noriega and Wells, 1999). Our transcriptomic analysis showed a down-regu-
lation of several trypsin genes in fungus-treated mosquitoes in the absence of a blood meal.

 Next, we performed assays to determine whether the Tsp_PR secretome down-regulates midgut
trypsin enzymatic activity in vivo, by simply assaying the enzymatic activity of mosquito guts after
exposure to the Tsp_PR secretome at 24 hr after a blood meal. The results showed a significantly
lower trypsin enzymatic activity in the midgut of the experimental Tsp_PR secretome-exposed group
(p<0.001) than in the non-treated control mosquitoes (Figure 7C, Figure 7—source data 1).
The Tsp_PR secretome appeared to stimulate a reduction in trypsin enzymatic activity as a conse-
quence of the transcriptional down-regulation of trypsin genes. However, we also proceeded to test
whether the Tsp_PR secretome could directly influence trypsin enzymatic activity in vitro. This assay
showed that the fungus secretome significantly decreased the in vitro activity of a commercial trypsin
(p<0.01) in absence of mosquito’s guts (Figure 7D, Figure 7—source data 1). To provide functional
confirmation that the Tsp_PR secretome-regulated trypsins could influence DENV infection, we
silenced selected trypsin genes using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing and com-
pared DENV titers to that of a control cohort that has been treated with a GFP dsRNA. Silencing
efficiency was evaluated (Figure 8A, Figure 8—source data 1) for AAEL010196, T196 (Figure 8B,
Figure 8—source data 1); AAEL013707, T707 (Figure 8C, Figure 8—source data 1); AAEL013714,
T714 (Figure 8D, Figure 8—source data 1); AAEL013715, T715 (Figure 8E, Figure 8—source data
1). Silencing of T714 and T715 resulted in a modest increased DENV infection intensity, while simul-
taneous silencing of all trypsin genes (Tmix) significantly increased DENV infection intensity (p<0.05).
Silencing of T714 resulted in the greatest increase of DENV infection prevalence (p<0.001)
(Figure 8F, Figure 8—source data 1). These results indicate that a transcript reduction of multiple

 trypsins has a promoting effect on DENV infection, and trypsin T714 appears to exert the strongest
contribution.
Taken together, these results show that one or more Tsp_PR-secreted factors influence blood
digestion through the modulation of trypsin expression and activity, which in turn, affects susceptibil-
ity to DENV infection.
Discussion
Here we show that a fungus that is naturally associated with Aedes sp. in the field can enhance virus
infection, and thereby potentially also enhance DENV transmission. Several studies have shown that
the mosquito gut microbiota plays a critical role in determining the outcome of pathogen infection

 and that different species of gut-associated bacteria can inhibit DENV and Plasmodium infection in
Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, respectively (Dong et al., 2009; Pumpuni et al., 1996;
Ramirez et al., 2012). Studies of the mosquito microbiota have mainly focused on bacteria, whereas
the influence of fungi on mosquito physiology and pathogen infection remains largely understudied.
Most studies concerning the mosquito mycobiota have explored the biology of entomopathogenic
fungi, such as Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, for use in mosquito control
(Darbro et al., 2011; Scholte et al., 2007). The association of diverse fungi, with different develop-
mental stages of mosquitoes in the field is reported (da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998; da S Pereira
et al., 2009), and fungi, including Talaromyces sp., have also been isolated from the midgut of other
arthropods such as ticks, sandflies, and kissing bugs (Akhoundi et al., 2012; Marti et al., 2007).
Their presence is not surprising, since mosquitoes and many other insect vectors of disease are con-
stantly exposed to a fungus-rich environment, including the larval breeding habitat, the plant nectars
on which the adults feed, and the sites on which they rest.
We have shown that the presence of Tsp_PR spores or fungus secreted-molecules in the midgut
tissue of the mosquito results in higher DENV infections in two different Ae. aegypti strains. How-
ever, modulation of infection does not seem to be a general property of a closely related Penicillium
species, since exposure of Ae. aegypti to whole spores or the secretome of another mosquito-asso-
ciated species, Penicillium chrysogenum, did not affect DENV infection (Anglero
´-Rodrı
´guez et al.,
2016). Our study suggests that Tsp_PR produces a factor(s) that is a likely a heat-sensitive protein or
metabolite that alters the mosquito’s susceptibility to DENV. Mosquitoes treated with the fungus
secretome did not display differences in bacterial load in their midguts, indicating that the fungus-
secreted factor(s) does not compromise the ability of Ae. aegypti to control its intestinal microbiota.

 Our transcriptomic analysis of how the Tsp_PR influences mosquito physiology pointed to a pro-
found regulation of genes principally related to metabolism and digestion. Among the top up-regu-
lated genes were ornithine decarboxylase, which is associated with polyamine biosynthesis; glucosyl/
glucuronosyl transferases, which play an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and the
regulation of endobiotics (Ahn et al., 2012); and cytochrome P450, which is involved in detoxifica-
tion (Strode et al., 2008). Interestingly, a considerable number of up-regulated genes were associ-
ated with detoxification, suggesting that the fungus imposes a certain level of toxicity. However,
Tsp_PR exposure did not seem to affect mosquito longevity. Perhaps the up-regulation of the detox-
ification machinery effectively reverses a detrimental effect.
Among the up-regulated genes, only glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferase (AAEL003099) modulates
DENV infection in Ae. aegypti (Sim et al., 2013). An earlier study showed that this gene was
expressed at a lower level in Ae. aegypti strains that are refractory to DENV and at a higher level in
DENV-susceptible strains, suggesting that the AAEL003099 gene acts as a DENV host factor. These
findings are in agreement with our study, in which Tsp_PR secretome-exposed mosquitoes showed

 an elevated expression of AAEL003099. It is therefore possible that a Tsp_PR-mediated up-regula-
tion of AAEL003099 contributes to the elevated DENV infection levels. Another up-regulated gene
associated with proviral effect is ornithine decarboxylase, a recent study showed that the polyamine
biosynthesis is associated with an enhanced infection of Chikungunya and Zika viruses in humans
(Mounce et al., 2016).
The most striking expression signature that resulted from Tsp_PR secretome exposure was a pro-
found overrepresentation of down-regulated proteolysis genes. Trypsin genes were highly repre-
sented in this category, and they play a crucial role in the blood-digesting process in the mosquito
midgut. Two groups of trypsins are produced after the blood meal: early trypsins during the first 6
hr post-blood meal, and the late trypsins between 8 and 36 hr post-blood meal (Barillas-Mury et al.,
1995; Noriega and Wells, 1999). However, the early trypsin mRNA is produced prior to feeding
and is stored in the midgut epithelial cells, remaining untranslated until blood ingestion
(Noriega and Wells, 1999). Our transcriptomic analysis revealed trypsin AAEL010196 to be the

AAEL010203,
AAEL013715, and AAEL013707). We confirmed the functional significance of trypsin transcript
depletion on DENV infection using RNAi-mediated gene knock-down studies.
A phylogenetic analysis based on the trypsin gene nucleotide sequences revealed that the
AAEL013715 and AAEL013707 cluster together and show a closer resemblance to the early trypsin
EA1 gene, which has been associated with Aedes blood digestion (Figure 9). The trypsin genes
AAEL013714, AAEL010203, and AAEL010196 have a close resemblance to two well-characterized
late trypsins, 5G1 and LT (Brackney et al., 2010). Studies of trypsin 5G1 have established a link
between trypsin activity and permissiveness to DENV infection, since RNAi-mediated repression of
this gene results in greater susceptibility to the virus (da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998). This finding

 agrees with our studies showing that silencing of a closely related trypsin, the AAEL013714, also
results in a greater susceptibility to DENV infection. QTL mapping of loci that determine permissive-
ness to DENV also indicated the likely involvement of trypsin genes (Bosio et al., 2000).

Microbiology and Infectious Disease
 We have recently demonstrated that heat-stable factors secreted by a mosquito-associated P.
chrysogenum fungus can render Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes more susceptible to the malaria
parasite Plasmodium when present in the midgut tissue (Anglero
´-Rodrı
´guez et al., 2016). We
showed that this phenomenon was attributed to the up-regulation of an ornithine decarboxylase
gene which in turn results in a suppression of nitric oxide –dependent parasite killing. While inges-
tion of Tsp_PR also resulted in a strong up-regulation of the Ae. aegypti ornithine decarboxylase
gene, heat inactivation of its secreted factors abolished its ability to modulate DENV infection. Expo-
sure of An. gambiae to Tsp_PR also rendered it more permissive to Plasmodium infection, but expo-
sure of Ae aegypti to P. chrysogenum did not affect its permissiveness to DENV. Finally, exposure of
An. gambiae to P. chrysogenum did not result in a down-regulation of blood digestive enzymes
(Anglero
´-Rodrı
´guez et al., 2016). These results indicate that that the two fungi influence infection
with the virus and the parasite through different factors and mechanisms in their respective mosquito
vectors. While both Tsp_PR and P. chrysogenum appears to secrete a factor that influences An. gam-
biae susceptibility to the malaria parasite, only Tsp_PR produces the factor that render Ae. aegypti
more susceptible to DENV.
Our findings may have significant implications for the epidemiology and transmission of DENV by
Aedes mosquitoes in the field. Fungi are abundantly associated with field mosquitoes (da Costa and
de Oliveira, 1998; da S Pereira et al., 2009; Marti et al., 2007); our studies show that mosquitoes
can acquire Talaromyces sp. fungus through sugar feeding and that it will successfully colonize the
mosquito midgut for at least 25 days. Whether the exposure of mosquitoes to Tsp_PR in the field
results in a greater permissiveness to DENV is unknown and difficult to assess, but greater permis-
siveness is most likely dependent on the intensity of the fungal exposure and the success of the fun-
gus in persisting in the gut of various mosquito populations. A greater susceptibility of mosquitoes
to DENV as a result of Tsp_PR exposure could translate into an enhanced transmission. However,
this possibility remains to be addressed experimentally, perhaps by correlating the presence of
Tsp_PR and DENV in field-caught mosquitoes in dengue-endemic areas. The observed impact of
Tsp_PR on mosquito egg development in the ovary and the delayed degradation of the blood meal
may suggest that exposure of mosquitoes to the amounts of the Tsp_PR secretome used in this
study would impose a fitness cost.
In summary, we show how the mosquito mycobiota can influence Ae. aegypti vector competence
for DENV by physiologically modulating midgut enzymes, one of the first barriers the pathogen
encounters during infection (Figure 10). Our study represents a significant step toward the under-
standing of fungi-mosquito interactions and their possible implications for the transmission of DENV
and perhaps other arboviruses.

Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Johns Hopkins University (Permit Number: M006H300). Mice were only used for
mosquito rearing as a blood source, according to approved protocol. Commercial anonymous
human blood was used for DENV infection assays in mosquitoes, and informed consent was there-
fore not applicable. The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Ethics Committee approved this
protocol.
Cell culture and mosquito rearing
The Ae. albopictus cell line C6/36 (ATCC CRL-1660) was maintained in MEM (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Baby
hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, ATCC CCL-10) were maintained on DMEM (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 mg/mL plasmocin (Invivogen, San
Diego, CA). C6/36 cells and BHK-21 cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 32˚C and 37˚C, respectively.
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were maintained on a 10% sucrose solution at 27˚C and 80% relative humid-
ity with a 14:10 hr light:dark cycle.
Fungus treatments
Tsp_PR was grown on Sabouraud glucose agar (SGA) and identified as described in (Anglero
´-
Rodrı
´guez et al., 2016); spores were collected in PBS, counted, and resuspended in a 10% sucrose
solution containing 1 � 109 spores. For fungal filtrate, spores were collected in a 10% sucrose solu-
tion and kept in a rocker machine overnight at 4˚C. The next day, the solution was centrifuged at
470 rcf to collect the supernatant, which was passed through a 0.2-micron filter to remove fungus
mycelia and spores. The heat-inactivated filtrate was treated in the same way, but the supernatant
was incubated for 2 hr at 95˚C. Adult female Ae. aegypti (3–4 days old) were starved for 6 hr and
fed with the appropriate fungal treatment for 48 hr.
DENV infection
DENV2 strain New Guinea C (NGC) was propagated in C6/36 cells, and titers were determined on
BHK-21 cells by plaque assay. Mosquito infections with DENV were carried out as previously
described (Das et al., 2007). In brief, DENV2-NGC was propagated in C6/36 cells for 6 days. Virus
suspension was mixed 1:1 with commercial human blood and supplemented with 10% human serum
and 100 mM ATP. Mosquitoes were infected via an artificial membrane feeder at 37˚C for 30 min.
Midguts were dissected and individually collected at 7 days post-infection.
Plasmodium infection and oocyst enumeration
Plasmodium falciparum infections were performed following a standard protocol (Dong et al.,
2006). At 48 hr post-feeding on fungi or filtrate, mosquitoes were fed on an NF54W strain gameto-
cyte culture mixed with human blood, through a membrane feeder at 37˚C. Engorged mosquitoes
were maintained at 27˚C for up to 8 days. P. falciparum-infected mosquito midguts were dissected
and stained with 0.1% mercurochrome, and oocyst numbers were determined using a light
microscope.

 Plaque assay
BHK-21 cells were seeded in 24-well plates the day before the assay. The next day, individual midg-
uts were homogenized in DMEM with 0.5 mm glass beads using a Bullet Blender (NextAdvance).
Homogenates were centrifuged at 18,400 rcf and the virus-containing suspensions were 10-fold seri-
ally diluted, and 100 uL of each dilution were inoculated onto 80% confluent BHK-21 plates. Plates
were rocked for 15 min at room temperature and then incubated for 45 min at 37˚C and 5% CO2.
After the incubation, 1 mL of DMEM containing 2% FBS and 0.8% methylcellulose was added to
each well, and plates were incubated for 5 days. Plates were fixed and stained for 30 min with a 1:1
methanol/acetone and 1% crystal violet mixture. Then, plates were washed with water and the pla-
que-forming units counted.
Microbial enumeration
Mosquitoes were surfaced-sterilized for 1 min in 70% ethanol and rinsed twice with 1X PBS. Mosqui-
toes were dissected, and five midguts were pooled in a microcentrifuge tube containing 150 ml of
sterile PBS. Midguts were homogenized with a pestle and plated on LB agar for bacterial enumera-
tion or Sabouraud agar with an antibiotic cocktail of penicillin/streptomycin and gentamicin for fun-
gal enumeration (whole mosquitoes or midguts were collected for this procedure). Plates were
incubated at room temperature for 48 hr for bacteria and 4 days for fungus, and then plates were
counted as colony-forming units (CFU). Bacterial growth inhibition assay. Was performed using a
disc diffusion test, in which a sterile filter paper disk soaked in a fungus secretome solution or an
antibiotic cocktail as a control, was placed over a bacterial culture on LB agar medium. Plates were
incubated for 24 hr at 32˚C and the inhibition zone were evaluated.
Aseptic mosquitoes
Adult female mosquitoes were maintained on 10% sucrose solution containing 75 mg/mL gentamicin
sulfate and 100 units (mg)/mL of penicillin-streptomycin. Treatment was carried out for 4 days. To val-
idate the efficiency of antibiotic treatment, midguts from control untreated and antibiotic treated
mosquitoes were subjected to CFU assays. Mosquitoes were treated with the bacteria-free fungus
secretome for 2 days, and then maintained on antibiotic-treated sucrose after the DENV infection.
Genome-wide microarray-based transcriptome profiling
Transcriptome assays were conducted and analyzed as reported previously with a custom-designed
full genome Ae. aegypti Agilent-based microarray platform (Sim et al., 2013; Xi et al., 2008). In
brief, 200 ng of total RNA per replicate was used to synthesize Cy3 or Cy5-labeled cRNA probes
using a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies). Probes from midguts of Tsp_PR-
treated mosquitoes were individually hybridized against probes from untreated mosquitoes as a con-
trol. The arrays were scanned with an Agilent Scanner. Transcription data were processed by begin-
ning with background subtraction of the median fluorescent values, normalized with the LOWESS
normalization method. Cy5/Cy3 ratios from replicate assays were subjected to t-tests at a signifi-
cance level of p<0.05 using TIGR MIDAS and MeV software. Transcript abundance data from all rep-
licate assays were averaged with the GEPAS microarray preprocessing software and transformed to
a logarithm (base 2). Self-self hybridizations have previously been used to determine a cutoff value
for the significance of gene regulation on these microarrays of 0.75 in log2 scale (Yang et al., 2002).
Three independent experiments were performed. Numeric microarray gene expression data are pre-
sented in Table 1, Supplementary file 1.
Oogenesis assays
Mosquitoes we exposed or not exposed to the Tsp_PR secretome for 48 hr, after they had received
a blood meal. Fully engorged females from both groups were collected and maintained for 6 days;
their ovaries were then dissected in PBS, and oogenesis was microscopically evaluated. Through
microscopic evaluation of the follicle development in the ovary, we assigned an arbitrary score of 0
for small round follicles, 1 for intermediate size follicles, and 2 for fully developed follicles, with the
elongated shape of normal mature eggs.

 Body weight measurements
Mosquitoes were fed with non-infectious blood for 20 min, then fully-engorged mosquitoes were
individually collected and placed in individual round-bottom conical tubes and incubated without
sugar or water. The conical tube weight was measured prior to collecting the mosquito. The weight
of mosquitoes at 1 hr post-infection was calculated by subtracting the empty tube weight from the
total weight. At 48 hr mosquitoes were cold anesthetized and weighted directly to the analytical bal-
ance without the tube to avoid accumulated excreta.
Trypsin activity assay
Mosquito endogenous trypsin activity assay
Mosquitoes were exposed, or not exposed, to the Tsp_PR secretome for 48 hr, after they were fed
an artificial blood meal (40% PBS, 50% FBS, 1 mM ATP, and 2 mg of phenol red) to avoid interfer-
ence with the assay (Brackney et al., 2008). At 24 hr post-blood meal, 10 midguts per group were
dissected, collected in 50 mL of buffer solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 10 mM CaCl2), and
homogenized on ice with a pestle. Supernatants were collected after a high-speed centrifugation
(18,400 rcf) at 4˚C. Trypsin activity assays were performed using the synthetic colorimetric substrate
Na-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride (BApNA) (Sigma). The reaction mixtures, each
containing 5 ml of midgut extract and 1 mM BApNA, were then incubated at 37˚C for 5 min. Absor-
bance values were measured in a plate reader at A405 nm.
In vitro trypsin inhibition assay
A reaction mixture was made using equal volumes of Tsp_PR filtrate and commercial trypsin (105
mM) (Gibco). The mixture was incubated at 27˚C for 3 hr. The reaction solution was prepared by add-
ing increasing volumes of the 1:1 mixture to the buffer solution and 1 mM BApNA, to a final volume
of 200 uL. Absorbance was measured as described above.
dsRNA-mediated gene silencing
The trypsin genes were depleted from adult female mosquitoes using established RNA interference
(RNAi) methodology (Sim et al., 2013). Mosquitoes injected with GFP dsRNA were used as a control
and RNAi assays were repeated three times. Gene silencing was verified by qRT-PCR at 3 days post-
injection using RNA extracted from five whole mosquitoes per independent experiment. The primers
to produce PCR Amplicons for dsRNA synthesis and qRT-PCR are presented in Supplementary file
2.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Mosquito samples were collected in RLT buffer (QIAGEN), and then stored at �80˚C until extraction.
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN); samples were treated with Turbo
DNase (Ambion) before reverse transcription with a MMLV Reverse Transcriptase kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was then used to determine gene expres-
sion by quantitative PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem). The transcript
abundance of trypsin was compared to the expression of the ribosomal protein gene S7 as a normal-
ization control. qPCR primers were designed to amplify the mRNA transcript outside the dsRNA
region. However, groups where trypsins were silenced simultaneously the qPCR primers for a given
trypsin crossed detected the injected dsRNA of other highly similar trypsins making unable the eval-
uation of silencing efficiency.
Statistical analysis
To compare DENV titers between groups, P-values were calculated using Generalized Linear Regres-
sion (GLM) with experiment-clustered robust variance estimates to account for potential within-
experiment correlation of outcomes (Rogers, 1993). The models included different link functions for
various outcomes: identity link was used to compare DENV PFU and bacteria CFU, log-link with Pois-
son distribution was used for modeling infections and score 0 to 2 for oogenesis assays and log-link
with Negative Binomial distribution was used to model number of Plasmodium falciparum oocysts.
The models included an indicator variable for treatment with only two levels or multiple indicator
variables for multiple treatment groups. Wald test P-values are reported in the results. Survival was
