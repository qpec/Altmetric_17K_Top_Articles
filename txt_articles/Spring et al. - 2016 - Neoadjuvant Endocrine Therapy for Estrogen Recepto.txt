Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors of the breast are generally highly 
responsive to endocrine treatment. Although endocrine therapy is the mainstay of adjuvant 
treatment for ER+ breast cancer, the role of endocrine therapy in the neoadjuvant setting is 
unclear.

 OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) on the response 
rate and the rate of breast conservation surgery (BCS) for ER+ breast cancer.
DATA SOURCES—Based on PRISMA guidelines, a librarian-led search of PubMed and Ovid 
MEDLINE was performed to identify eligible trials published from inception to May 15, 2015. 
The search was performed in May 2015.
STUDY SELECTION—Inclusion criteria were prospective, randomized, neoadjuvant clinical 
trials that reported response rates with at least 1 arm incorporating NET (n = 20). Two authors 
independently analyzed the studies for inclusion.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—Pooled odds ratios (ORs), 95% CIs, and P values 
were estimated for end points using the fixed- and random-effects statistical model.
RESULTS—The analysis included 20 studies with 3490 unique patients. Compared with 
combination chemotherapy, NET as monotherapy with aromatase inhibitors had a similar clinical 
response rate (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.50–2.35; P = .85; n = 378), radiological response rate (OR, 
1.38; 95% CI, 0.92–2.07; P = .12; n = 378), and BCS rate (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03; P = .07; 
n = 334) but with lower toxicity. Aromatase inhibitors were associated with a significantly higher 
clinical response rate (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.36–2.10; P < .001; n = 1352), radiological response 
rate (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18–1.89; P < .001; n = 1418), and BCS rate (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.24–
2.12; P < .001; n = 918) compared with tamoxifen. Dual combination therapy with growth factor 
pathway inhibitors was associated with a higher radiological response rate (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 
1.04–2.43; P = .03; n = 355), but not clinical response rate (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54–1.07; P = .11; 
n = 537), compared with endocrine monotherapy. The incidence of pathologic complete response 
was low (<10%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, even as monotherapy, 
is associated with similar response rates as neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy but with 
significantly lower toxicity, suggesting that NET needs to be reconsidered as a potential option in 
the appropriate setting. Additional research is needed to develop rational NET combinations and 
predictive biomarkers to personalize the optimal neoadjuvant strategy for ER+ breast cancer.
Endocrine therapy is the mainstay of treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast 
cancer. At approximately 75% of all breast cancers, ER+ constitutes the most common 
subtype of the disease.1,2 Conceptually, endocrine therapy strategies include 2 approaches. 
The first approach inhibits the production of estrogen (ligand) so no ligand is available to 
activate the receptor. This strategy is used by aromatase inhibitors (AI), which block the 
aromatase enzyme and lower estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, or by luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone agonists, which reduce estrogen production by the ovaries and 
lower estrogen levels in premenopausal women. The second approach targets the estrogen 
receptor itself and is used by drugs such as tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor 
modulator, or fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader.
Although medical therapy for localized breast cancer is primarily used in the adjuvant 
setting, it can also be effectively used in the neoadjuvant (preoperative) setting. Neoadjuvant 
therapy for breast cancer is generally established as a therapeutic option for selected high-
risk breast cancers, such as tumors 2 cm or greater, and for locally advanced disease

 (including tumors initially ineligible for resection). The use of neoadjuvant therapy offers 
several clinical and research advantages. In patients with large tumors, neoadjuvant therapy 
is likely to reduce the tumor size and can make some patients candidates for breast 
conservation surgery (BCS) rather than mastectomy.3 Given that the primary tumor remains 
intact during therapy, the neoadjuvant treatment approach allows for monitoring of treatment 
response and discontinuation of inactive therapy in the event of disease progression, thereby 
saving the patient exposure to potentially toxic therapy. From a research perspective, the 
preoperative setting has become recognized as a human in vivo system to explore biomarker 
development and the efficacy of therapies, including novel agents.4 A number of studies5 
have shown that the benefit of chemotherapy is similar whether treatment is given in the 
adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.
Although the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is well established in localized 
breast cancer, the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET), as monotherapy and in 
combination with other therapies, remains unclear. Owing to concern for delayed time to 
response compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, NET was initially used to treat elderly 
patients with ER+ breast cancer, particularly those who were not considered good candidates 
for systemic chemotherapy or surgery, because NET in general is well tolerated.6–10 Since 
2001, a number of studies11–24 have explored the efficacy of NET in a more general 
population and demonstrated considerable response rates in patients with ER+ breast cancer, 
suggesting that NET could be a significantly less toxic alternative to NACT. However, these 
studies had small sample sizes with low power, which limited their ability to make robust 
conclusions to guide clinical application. Moreover, considerable debate remains on the 
optimal choice of endocrine therapy. Consequently, NET is used infrequently in clinical 
practice. To address these issues, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and 
meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the efficacy of various NETs, including combination 
strategies, for ER+ breast cancer.
Methods
Based on the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) statement,25 a librarian-led systematic search restricted to English-
language studies in PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE was performed in May 2015 to identify 
eligible trials published from inception to May 15, 2015. The search strategy is detailed in 
eMethods in the Supplement. Gray literature was not included. Inclusion criteria were 
prospective, randomized, neoadjuvant clinical trials that had at least 1 NET arm and reported 
response rates. Studies including patients with any neoplasm other than female breast cancer 
were excluded, as were studies analyzing unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. This 
meta-analysis of readily available literature did not require institutional review board 
approval, and each respective study detailed their consent procedures.
Data extraction was performed independently by two of us (L.M.S. and A.G.), with very 
good interobserver agreement (κ = 0.95). The response rate was the primary end point of 
interest. Data on pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and rates of BCS were also 
collected when available. Response rate was defined as the probability of achieving a 
complete response and/or a partial response, determined by serial clinical or radiological

 measurement, as reported by the study under consideration. A pCR was defined as no 
residual malignant lesion detected by pathologic examination of the resected tissue.
Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and P values were estimated for end points using the Mantel-
Haenzel method and considering a fixed- and random-effects statistical model, with analyses 
repeated using the Peto 1-step OR method to account for rare events.26 Meta-analyses were 
conducted with the computer program Review Manager (RevMan; version 5.1 for Windows; 
Nordic Cochrane Centre). The 95% CIs were calculated and presented in forest plots. 
Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated with the χ2 test, and inconsistency was estimated 
using the I2 statistic.27 Differences between studies regarding eligibility criteria, patient 
population, potential bias, and treatment-delivered arms were discussed. The quality of the 
selected randomized clinical trials was assessed based on the instrument developed by Jadad 
et al28 (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the 
effect of various variables on outcomes and to evaluate trends. A P value of .05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 477 potential studies were identified by the systematic search. Studies that were 
duplicated (n = 200) were excluded, and we reviewed abstracts for the remaining 277 
studies. Of these, a total of 27 randomized clinical trials were selected for full review. Seven 
trials were excluded for incomplete data (n = 1), duplication (n = 1), and lack of 
comparisons of interest (n = 5). Ultimately, 20 trials met the criteria for inclusion, with 3490 
unique patients. The PRISMA diagram detailing the inclusion process is shown in eFigure 1 
in the Supplement. The PubMed search was repeated in April 2016, and 1 additional study 
of interest was found.29
Study Characteristics
The selected studies22–24, 30–46 were published from January 2001 to December 2014. The 
sample sizes ranged from 44 to 374 and featured a broad patient population. Eighteen 
studies (90%)22–24, 31–33, 35–46 included postmenopausal women only; 1 study (5%)30 
included premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and 1 study (5%)34 focused entirely 
on premenopausal women. The selected trials compared NACT vs NET and tamoxifen vs 
AIs, used different durations of AI therapy, and administered NET with additional agents. 
Details on the selected studies are shown in the Table.
NET vs NACT
Pooled data of trials comparing NET monotherapy with AI and combination NACT for 
localized breast cancer demonstrated no significant difference in the clinical response rate 
(OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.50–2.35; P = .85; n = 378), radiological response rate (OR, 1.38; 95% 
CI, 0.92–2.07; P = .12; n = 378), pCR (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.62–6.39; P = .25; n = 378), or 
BCS rate (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03; P = .07; n = 334), as outlined in Figure 1. 
Alternative statistical models demonstrating consistent results are found in eFigure 2 in the 
Supplement.30–32

 However, toxicity was significantly increased in the NACT arm in all 3 studies (eTable 2 in 
the Supplement). Alba et al30 reported a reduction in grade 3 (severe) to 4 (life-threatening) 
adverse events (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03–0.35; P ≤ .001) favoring NET. Semiglazov et al32 
reported increased rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and cardiotoxicity with 
chemotherapy. Palmieri et al31 reported statistically significant increases in alopecia, nausea, 
vomiting, stomatitis, and anemia with NACT. One trial33 compared NET plus chemotherapy 
with NACT alone. This trial included patients with ER+ and ER-negative tumors, but in the 
subgroup analysis focused on those with ER+ tumors, a statistically significant benefit 
accrued for the clinical response rate (P = .007) and pCR (P = .04) by adding endocrine 
therapy.
Different Types of NET
Seven trials compared NET plus AIs vs tamoxifen.22–24, 34–37 The pooled analysis 
demonstrated a highly statistically significant benefit favoring the AI over tamoxifen for the 
clinical response rate (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.36–2.10; P < .001; n = 1352) and radiological 
response rate (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18–1.89; P < .001; n = 1418), as outlined in Figure 2A 
and B and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. The IMPACT study (Immediate Preoperative 
Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen)23 compared a third treatment arm in 
which patients received a combination of tamoxifen and letrozole vs tamoxifen alone, with 
no significant difference in the clinical response rate (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.67–2.00; P = .61) 
and radiological response rate (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.79–2.79; P = .22) between the 2 groups. 
No difference was seen in the pCR rate (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.38–5.33; P = .60;n = 633), 
although the total number of events was small and only 3 studies22, 34, 36 reported pCR 
(Figure 2C). For the BCS rate, a statistically significant benefit favored AI over tamoxifen 
(OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.24–2.12; P < .001; n = 918) (Figure 2D). For all studies, toxicity was 
low with both treatment strategies.
One study38 compared durations of exemestane, 25 mg/d, for 6 and 4 months and reported 
no difference between the 2 groups in clinical response rates. Another study39 compared 3 
different AIs and reported no significant difference in clinical response rates among patients 
who received letrozole and anastrozole compared with those who received exemestane (95 
of 127 [74.8%] vs 85 of 123 [69.1%] vs 78 of 124 [62.9%], respectively) and similar 
biological activity based on changes in the Ki67 proliferative index and the preoperative 
endocrine prognostic index. In addition, surgical outcomes were improved in all 3 groups, 
with 81 of 159 patients (50.9%) who were considered mastectomy-only candidates at the 
start of treatment undergoing BCS and 157 of 189 patients (83.1%) who were marginal 
candidates for BCS undergoing BCS.39
One study40 compared fulvestrant dosages of 500 and 250 mg/mo for 16 weeks before 
surgery. Results demonstrated no significant difference in tumor response by 
ultrasonography in the intent-to-treat population (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64–2.64; P = .47) but 
higher biological activity for the 500-mg vs the 250-mg doses, consistent with observations 
in the metastatic setting. Our updated search revealed 1 study29 that compared neoadjuvant 
anastrozole with fulvestrant, which showed similar response rates (33 of 56 [58.9%] vs 28 of

 52 [53.8%], respectively) and BCS rates (33 of 56 [58.9%] vs 26 of 52 [50.0%], 
respectively).
NET as Monotherapy vs Dual Therapy
Agents used in combination with NET in the studies were everolimus,41 celecoxib,42 
zoledronic acid,43 gefitinib,44, 45 dual endocrine therapy with AI plus tamoxifen,23 and 
lapatinib.46 As seen in Figure 3A and B, the analysis of monotherapy vs dual therapy 
showed no difference in terms of clinical response rate (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; P = .
50; n = 941) although with significant heterogeneity, but dual therapy was associated with a 
higher radiological response rate (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.11–2.02; P = .008; n = 758), with 
similar results seen with alternative statistical models (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Of the 
trials looking at NET with an additional agent considered to be a growth factor pathway 
inhibitor, dual therapy was associated with a higher radiological response rate (OR, 1.59; 
95% CI, 1.04–2.43; P = .03; n = 355) but not clinical response rate (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.54–1.07; P = .11; n = 537), which had significant heterogeneity compared with endocrine 
monotherapy (Figure 3C and D), with similar results noted using alternative statistical 
models (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The incidence of a pCR in any arm was low overall 
(<10%), with resultant low numbers not suitable for intergroup comparisons. Rates of 
conversion to BCS were not uniformly reported. An additional study44 testing gefitinib plus 
an AI was not suitable for direct comparison because gefitinib plus placebo represented the 
control arm. This small study (n = 56) showed that the addition of an AI resulted in greater 
tumor size reduction with a minimal increase in treatment-related adverse events.
Discussion
This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that NET, even as 
monotherapy, is associated with similar response rates to NACT given as combination 
therapy but with lower toxicity. The incidence of pCR was uniformly low, consistent with 
other neoadjuvant studies in ER+ breast cancer.47 As demonstrated, neoadjuvant AIs are 
more effective than tamoxifen. Our study also suggests that dual combination therapy might 
be superior to monotherapy.
Although NACT is more widely used for fit patients than NET, both therapies have similar 
efficacy and low toxicity, and NET needs to be reconsidered as a potential option. In terms 
of choice of NET, results of this analysis mirror those seen in the adjuvant setting, with 
superior results for letrozole over tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant trial PO24 and the adjuvant 
trial BIG (Breast International Group) 1–98.22, 48 Notably, similar to the adjuvant trial ATAC 
(Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination), combining tamoxifen and an AI was not 
found to be beneficial in the neoadjuvant IMPACT trial.23, 49 Similarly, the 1 study solely 
focusing on premenopausal women, the STAGE study,34 demonstrated 6 months of ovarian 
suppression plus an AI was more effective in reducing tumor size than tamoxifen, which 
supported results seen in the adjuvant setting in the SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function 
Plus Either Tamoxifen or Exemestane Compared With Tamoxifen Alone) and TEXT 
(Triptorelin With Either Exemestane or Tamoxifen) trials.50

 In the traditional treatment paradigm in ER+ breast cancer, endocrine therapy and 
chemotherapy were not combined because endocrine therapy might have a negative effect on 
concurrent chemotherapy by arresting the cell cycle in the GO phase and limiting the 
sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy.51, 52 However, as reviewed above, 
combination treatment with NET plus chemotherapy compared with NACT alone showed a 
statistically significant benefit to adding endocrine therapy for the clinical response rate and 
pCR, which challenges the notion that, at least in certain instances, endocrine therapy might 
not negatively affect the therapeutic efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy.33 With the 
remarkable therapeutic success seen in the metastatic setting with the combination of 
endocrine therapy and cyclindependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibition, which also affects the 
cell cycle, and the growing appreciation of tumor heterogeneity, it might be time to revisit 
the dogma of never combining endocrine therapies with cell cycle-specific therapies.53, 54
Another traditional treatment paradigm that might warrant reconsideration is the general 
recommendation that NET should not be offered to premenopausal women and that NACT 
should be preferred. This area is understudied. Most of the randomized trials reviewed in 
this analysis focused on postmenopausal women. A potential concern is the time 
(approximately 4 weeks) needed for the combination of AI and luteinizing hormone-
releasing hormone agonists to induce estradiol suppression.30 This concern further 
underscores the importance of other novel endocrine therapies and biomarker-driven trials in 
premenopausal ER+ breast cancer. Furthermore, the use of targeted agents in combination 
with NET for premenopausal women has not been well studied and should be evaluated 
further to balance efficacy with potential toxicities, including long-term toxicities of 
chemotherapy in young breast cancer survivors.
Determination of the correct patient population for NET remains in question. Tools such as 
Oncotype Dx Breast Recurrence Score and the Breast Cancer Index have been validated in 
the adjuvant setting and could be explored in the neoadjuvant setting as a potential 
mechanism to predict response to endocrine therapy.55, 56 In addition, biopsies performed 
during the course of treatment can provide valuable information regarding treatment 
response. Data from the IMPACT trial suggest that 2- to 4-week tumor Ki67 expression 
during endocrine therapy is predictive of long-term outcomes.57 The Alliance for Clinical 
Trials in Oncology cooperative group has designed a phase 3 neoadjuvant clinical trial 
(ALTERNATE)58 randomizing postmenopausal women with localized ER+ invasive breast 
cancer to anastrozole, fulvestrant, or their combination to assess a biomarker-driven 
treatment strategy and identify women with a low risk for disease recurrence. In this trial, 
biopsies are performed during NET, and patients with Ki67 expression greater than 10% are 
switched to chemotherapy. This strategy allows early assessment of endocrine therapy-
responsive vs -unresponsive disease, which could obviate the need for chemotherapy in 
select settings.
The neoadjuvant setting might serve as an attractive model for drug development in ER+ 
breast cancer. The trials comparing endocrine monotherapy with combination therapy 
suggest superior radiological response rates, but the low number of trials, different drugs, 
and nonselective inhibitors limit specific conclusions. Several ongoing trials are combining 
endocrine therapy with selective inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/D-cyclin-CDK4/6 
Spring et al.

 pathways in the neoadjuvant setting, such as letrozole with or without the PI3K inhibitor 
taselisib (LORELEI)59 and letrozole with or without the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib 
(PALLET).60 Preliminary analysis of a phase 2 trial examining palbociclib combined with 
anastrozole as neoadjuvant therapy for stage 2 or 3 ER+ breast cancer showed that the 
addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor significantly lowers Ki67, suggesting that the addition of 
CDK4/6 inhibition can improve the efficacy of NET.61
This study has several limitations. First, to avoid mixing studies with different treatment 
arms and to limit heterogeneity, only studies with similar arms were combined, and some 
pooled analyses were therefore restricted to 2 to 3 studies with resultant small sample sizes. 
Second, some of the studies comparing NET vs NACT used different radiological modalities 
to assess the radiological response rate. Sensitivity analysis including only the studies 
reporting the radiological response rate by ultrasonography demonstrated similar results 
(OR, 1.20; 95%CI, 0.75–1.92; P = .45). Although the response rate was not assessed 
uniformly in all trials, most used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
and no evidence of major publication bias was found (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Third, 
the definition of ER+ varied among some of the studies. The PO24 and IMPACT trials 
demonstrated higher response rates in patients with higher ER expression.22, 23 In addition, 
the studies do not report survival data. Survival is a difficult end point for NET studies given 
the recommended use of adjuvant endocrine therapy, varying adherence with adjuvant 
endocrine therapy, differing use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and the long-term follow-up 
needed for late recurrences in ER+ breast cancer. Semiglazov et al32 reported the local 
recurrence rate after a mean follow-up of less than 36 months (3.3% and 3.4% of patients 
who received endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, respectively). Last, conclusions 
regarding improved rates of BCS are limited overall because determining eligibility for BCS 
is subjective by nature and depends on several variables, including patient preference.
Conclusions
Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be a safe and effective option for localized ER+ breast 
cancer. Given the low toxicity associated with NET, reconsideration of NET as a worthwhile 
treatment option in the neoadjuvant setting is reasonable, particularly as combination 
therapy, similar to NACT in combination, for the correct patient population. Determining the 
correct patient population for NET remains an unanswered question, and will be best 
addressed by additional studies incorporating NET with strong biomarker-driven hypotheses. 
Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy also provides the opportunity to examine mechanisms of 
endocrine resistance, to optimize and compare endocrine therapies, and to investigate 
combination approaches with novel targeted therapies that may delay or prevent endocrine 
resistance. Further studies examining predictive biomarkers are needed to personalize 
optimal NET plus targeted therapy combinations.

 Key Points
Question
Is neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET), as monotherapy and in combination with other 
therapies, an effective treatment option for localized estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) 
breast cancer?
Findings
In this meta-analysis of 20 randomized clinical trials with a total sample size of 3490 
women, NET, even as monotherapy, was associated with response rates similar to those 
of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy but with lower toxicity.
Meaning
Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is a reasonable treatment option for localized ER+ breast 
cancer, and additional studies are needed to develop rational endocrine therapy 
combinations and predictive biomarkers to optimize NET strategies.
