Background. Fosmidomycin–piperaquine is being developed as nonartemisinin-based combination therapy to meet the chal-
lenge of emerging artemisinin resistance.
Methods. The study was a phase 2, single-arm, proof-of-concept study of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of fosmidomycin–
piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection in Gabon. Adults and children of both sexes 
with initial parasite counts between 1000 and 150 000/µL received oral treatment with fosmidomycin (twice daily doses of 30 mg/
kg) and piperaquine (once daily dose of 16 mg/kg) for 3 days and followed-up for 63 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
per-protocol polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–corrected day 28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR).
Results. One hundred patients were enrolled. The PCR-corrected day 28 ACPR rate was 83/83, or 100% (95% confidence 
interval, 96–100). Fourteen patients had asexual parasitaemia between day 28 and day 63; all were typed by PCR as new infections. 
Fosmidomycin–piperaquine therapy led to rapid parasite clearance (median, 36 hours; interquartile range [IQR], 6–60) and fever 
clearance time (median, 12 hours; IQR, 6–48). The electrocardiogram assessments showed 2 patients with prolonged QT interval 
>500 msec following study drug administration. The majority of adverse events affected the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts 
and were transient and mild to moderate in severity.
Conclusions. This is the first report of the use of the combination fosmidomycin–piperaquine. The combination appeared to 
have high efficacy and be safe and well tolerated despite observed transient changes in electrocardiogram with prolongation of the 
QT interval.

Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has made a 
major contribution to reducing the global malaria burden, but 
its role as first-line treatment is being eroded by the development 
of resistance [1, 2]. Strenuous efforts are being made to control 
the spread of artemisinin resistance through implementation 
of the Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment, 
which relies on early case detection and treatment [3].
A priority is the development of new therapies with novel 
modes of action. Such therapies are being referred to as nonar-
temisinin-based combination therapies (NACTs).
Fosmidomycin is an aminopropylphosphonic acid developed 
in the 1970s as an antibacterial agent. It has an antimalarial 
activity through inhibition of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate 
reductoisomerase, an essential enzyme on the non-meva-
lonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis [4]. During the last 
15 years, fosmidomycin has been assessed in several stud-
ies either as monotherapy or combined with clindamycin or 
artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium fal-
ciparum malaria in adult and pediatric populations as detailed 
in a recent review by Fernandes and colleagues [5]. One study 
in children in Mozambique reported very poor efficacy on

day 28 and a prolonged parasite clearance time in very young 
children [16]. Piperaquine is a bisquinoline that is related 
to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines. Synthesized 
in the 1960s, it was used extensively as a chemo-prophylac-
tic agent in the Chinese Malaria Control Programme until its 
effectiveness became compromised by the emergence of drug 
resistance [17]. It has an elimination half-life of more than 
20 days. In  
combination with an artemisinin, it provides fast 
parasite- 
killing with a long-acting partner and was successfully 
developed as  
dihydroartemisinin (DHA)–piperaquine. DHA–
piperaquine is among the most extensively studied antimalarial 
drugs and can lead to electrocardiogram changes such as QT 
interval  
prolongation [8].
The combination of fosmidomycin and piperaquine rep-
resents a novel approach to the chemotherapy of malaria. It 
possesses different modes of action and different biochemical 
targets, with fosmidomycin exerting rapid blood schizonticidal 
activity and piperaquine providing prolonged post-treatment 
prophylaxis. It meets the criteria for NACT.
We conducted a clinical trial with the objectives of deter-
mining the clinical and parasitological responses to fosmido-
mycin–piperaquine as well as the safety and tolerability when 
administered orally for 3 days to adults and children with acute 
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
This phase 2, proof-of-concept, open-label, uncontrolled study 
of fosmidomycin combined with piperaquine for 3-day oral 
treatment in adults and children with uncomplicated P. fal-
ciparum malaria was carried out at the Centre de Recherches 
Médicales de Lambaréné (CERMEL) between March 2014 and 
June 2016 in Lambaréné and Fougamou, Gabon. The study re-
gion is within the equatorial rainforest and highly endemic for 
P. falciparum malaria, which is perennial with little seasonal 
variation [9, 10]. Local strains of P. falciparum show high levels 
of resistance against chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimeth-
amine [10, 11]. 
The study had 2 stages, designated parts 1 and 2, providing 
for the sequential enrollment of 50 patients in each part. Initial 
enrollment in part 1 included 10 patients aged >14 years; pro-
gression to the recruitment of 40 children aged 5–14 years was 
dependent on the outcome of an interim review at day 7 of safety 
and parasitological responses in the initial 10 patients. The 
recruitment of 50 children aged 1–5 years in part 2 depended 
on the overall outcome of part 1. Based on an anticipated cure 
rate of 95%, with a significance level of 5% and 90% power with 
95% confidence, 31 evaluable patients were required for efficacy 
assessment in each part. Additional patients were recruited to 
provide an adequate safety database. Eligible patients were male 
and nonpregnant female febrile patients aged 15–60 years with 
a body weight between 40 and 90 kg for the adult/adolescent 
cohort, aged 5–14 years and body weight between 20 and 40 kg 
for the older children cohort, or aged 1–5 years and body weight 
between 5 and 20 kg for the younger children cohort. Eligible 
patients had microscopically confirmed P. falciparum monoin-
fection 1000–150 000 asexual parasites per µL of blood with 
the exception of patients aged >14 years as the P. falciparum 
monoinfection could either be determined by a rapid diagnostic 
test or any microscopic asexual count of parasites. All patients 
or their parents or guardians, in the case of minors, signed an 
informed consent prior to any study-related activity. Exclusion 
criteria included signs of severe malaria; pregnancy or lacta-
tion; concomitant disease that masked assessment of response, 
including abnormal liver function, impaired renal function, 
hemoglobin level <7.5 g/dL, white blood cell count >12 000/µL, 
history of cardiovascular disease including arrhythmia with QTc 
(corrected) interval ≥450 msec; and previous treatment within 
28 days with antimalarial and selected antibacterial agents.
The study was conducted in accordance with the provi-
sions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of the 
International Conference for Harmonisation–Good Clinical 
Practice. The National Ethics Committee of Gabon approved 
the study protocol, relevant study documents, and related 
information.
Procedures
Eligible patients were treated orally for 3 days with twice-daily 
fosmidomycin sodium capsules at a dose of 30 mg/kg over the 
range of 150 mg to 1800 mg and once-daily piperaquine tri-
phosphate tablets at a dose of 16 mg/kg over the range of 80 mg 
to 960 mg. The study drugs were administered under supervi-
sion. The first dose was administered at the time of the patient’s 
recruitment into the study. Subsequent doses were given at 
12-hour intervals. In the event of vomiting within 1 hour of ad-
ministration, the same dose of each drug was readministered 
once. Rescue treatment consisted of artemether–lumefantrine.
The study medication was manufactured, including packag-
ing and quality control, by Allphamed PHARBIL Arzneimittel 
GmbH, Germany, and dispensed in accordance with a certifi-
cate of compliance and release. The medication consisted of 
capsules that contained fosmidomycin sodium equivalent to 
450 mg acid for part 1 and 225 mg and 75 mg for part 2, plus 
cross-scored tablets of piperaquine–tetraphosphate that con-
tained 320 mg of the tetraphosphate for both parts of the study.
All patients were hospitalized for a minimum of 3 days until 
they were asymptomatic and free of asexual forms of parasites. 
Following discharge, patients were followed up on days 7, 14, 
21, 28, 35, 42, and 63. Patients who did not attend follow-up 
were visited by a health worker who offered transportation to 
the hospital for the scheduled examinations.
Giemsa-stained thick blood smears were performed and 
examined according to the Lambaréné method [12]. For

enrollment, a blood smear was performed at screening and at 
first dose. When screening parasitemia was >1000/µL, patients 
were enrolled even when parasitemia at first dose was <1000/
µL, which can be explained by natural variation. To differentiate 
between recrudescence and reinfection, parasite DNA extracted 
from dried blood spots on Whatman 3M filter paper (Whatman 
cat. no. 3030–866) obtained during primary and recurring 
infections was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
amplification of the highly polymorphic genes MSP1 and MSP2 
using published procedures [13]. In the case of inconclusive 
results, published small sequence repeat markers or microsat-
ellite markers (2–3 base-pair repeats) were used to analyze the 
P. falciparum strain composition by PCR and capillary electro-
phoresis, resulting in higher resolution of alleles [14, 15].
Laboratory safety assessment included hematology (hemo-
globin, hematocrit, total white blood cell count with differential, 
and platelet count) and biochemistry (bilirubin, transaminases 
[alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase], 
urea, creatinine, and glucose), and urinalysis by urine dipstick. 
These assessments were performed at baseline and at subse-
quent visits on days 2, 7, and 28 post-treatment.
Cardiac monitoring was done by sequential 12-lead elec-
trocardiograms (ECGs) at the study site (PC-based resting 
electrocardiograph; Welch Allyn, New York). In part 1, ECG 
assessments were performed prior to dosing of the fosmido-
mycin–piperaquine combination, then at 2 hours and 8 hours 
post-dosing on the first day of dosing (day 0) and on the third 
day of dosing (day 2). In part 2, ECG assessments were per-
formed prior to the combined dosing of fosmidomycin–piper-
aquine, then at 2 hours and 6 hours post-dosing on days 0, 1, 
and 2; at 2 hours; and at 6–8 hours post-dosing corresponding 
to the maximum plasma levels of fosmidomycin and piper-
aquine, respectively. The QTc was corrected from the formulas 
of Bazett (QTcB) or Fridericia (QTcF).
Adverse event were determined by obtaining symptom his-
tories and physical examination during follow-up visits. The 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was used to 
grade severity [16]. Adverse events were classified by primary 
system organ class and preferred term according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 18 [17].
Study Outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of per-pro-
tocol PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological 
responses (ACPR) on day 28. The parasite clearance time 
(PCT) was the first time from fosmidomycin–piperaquine 
administration to the first of at least 2 consecutive negative 
blood smear assessments. The parasite reduction ratio (PRR) 
was the ratio between parasitemia at the onset of drug treat-
ment and 48 hours later, corresponding to 1 asexual parasite 
life cycle. For calculation of PRR and PCT, parasitemia at first 
dose was used.
Statistical Analyses
For statistical analyses, we used STATA/IC, version 13.1 
(StataCorp, Texas). Data were entered on paper case report 
forms, and entries were checked against source data. The inten-
tion-to-treat population included patients who received any 
amount of the study medication and had confirmed positive 
parasitemia at baseline. Patients with no evaluable efficacy end-
points were considered to be treatment failures. The per-proto-
col population consisted of all intention-to-treat patients who 
had completed a full course of study medication and had known 
efficacy endpoints without vomiting after study drug adminis-
tration. The safety population included patients who received 
any amount of study medication.
RESULTS
Between March 2014 and May 2016, 100 patients of Gabonese 
origin were enrolled, as shown in Figure 1. Three patients dis-
continued study treatment; the QTcF prolongation was >450 
msec following first dosing for 2 of the patients and poor com-
pliance (difficulty to swallow tablets) was reported for the third 
patient. Twelve patients discontinued follow-up before day 28, 
1 was excluded because asexual parasitemia was reported posi-
tive at screening and negative at first dose and at all subsequent 
assessments. There were 85 patients, including 10 children aged 
<3 years, evaluable per-protocol for efficacy at day 28 out of the 
97 who received the complete study treatment. A total of 77 
patients constituted the efficacy per-protocol population eval-
uable at day 63 excluding 8 additional patients who were lost to 
follow-up prior to the day 42 visit. Baseline characteristics are 
shown in Table 1.
The efficacy outcomes are presented in Table 2, Table 3, and 
Figure 2. At day 28, overall ACPR was 83/83, or 100% (95% 
confidence interval, 96–100) in the per-protocol population, 
while 2 treatment failures were further classified as reinfections 
by PCR. Late parasitological failures occurred in 12 patients at 
day 35 (n = 5), day 42 (n = 4), and day 63 (n = 3). All were 
classified as new infections based on PCR correction, leading 
to a PCR-corrected day 63 ACPR rate of 100% (65/65). At day 
7, all patients assessed had a negative blood smear for malaria. 
All patients responded rapidly to treatment. Based on the safety 
population, the overall proportions of patients with gameto-
cytes were 5% at day 0 and 3% at day 7.
The patients who were anemic at baseline, 3 adults, 9 older 
children, and 46 younger children, had an increase in hemo-
globin level from day 7 following treatment. Five children in 
each of the children groups with pre-treatment platelet counts 
<100 000/mm3 had increased counts up to the normal level by 
day 7. Apart from a 4-fold increase in the ALT between day 0 
(7.8 U/L) and day 2 (31.2 U/L) in 1 adult, there were no clin-
ically significant changes in any of the blood chemistry values. 
Two patients with anemia experienced a fall in hemoglobin 
of 2 mg/dL on day 3, reported as an adverse event of special

interest as per-protocol requirement but without any clinical 
consequence. No blood transfusion was required.
In total, 55 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, with 
a total of 97 events recorded. Most events involved the gastro-
intestinal tract, including vomiting and abdominal pain, n = 23 
(24%); the upper and lower respiratory tracts, n = 23 (24%); 
skin lesions, n = 13 (13%); and systemic symptoms (headache, 
fever), n = 12 (12%). Less frequent adverse events included 
anemia, n = 5 (5%); urogenital schistosomiasis infection, n = 4 
(4%); and other systems, n = 17 (17%). The majority of clinical 
adverse events were rated as mild or moderate, and none were 
treatment limiting.
From the ECG findings, 2 patients presented with absolute 
values of QTcB >500 msec, exactly 504 msec on day 1 and 507 
msec on day 2; both at 6 hours post-dose. There were several 
occurrences of QTc changes from baseline >60 msec, particu-
larly marked for QTcF. The 2 patients with QTcB >500 msec 
had the highest QTcF changes from baseline, reaching values 
of 106 msec and 105 msec at day 2 (6 hours post-dose), respec-
tively. These 2 patients were both female, aged 5 years, and were 
febrile at baseline (body temperature >38°C) with heart rate of 
116 and 155 bpm, respectively. These events were transient, and 
the patients were not hospitalized. There was a cumulative trend 
with the duration of QTcF and QTcB increasing over the time, 
as shown in Figure 3.
DISCUSSION
The combination fosmidomycin–piperaquine proved to be 
highly efficacious and provided rapid resolution of malaria 
symptoms and parasitemia. However, significant QTc pro-
longations were observed in a subset of patients. Previous 
studies have shown inhomogeneous results as most pediatric 
studies reported satisfactory results with fosmidomycin coad-
ministered with clindamycin for the treatment of uncompli-
cated P. falciparum malaria in Gabon and Thailand [19–21], 
as reviewed by Fernandes and colleagues [5]. One study from 
Mozambique reported ACPR rates of only 43% in children 
aged <3 years [6]. Interestingly, in our study very young chil-
dren were treated successfully. The reason for the previous dis-
crepancy between those aged <5 years and the older children

has not been investigated; however, it is possible that the for-
mulation and the mode of administration as a syrup could 
result in underdosing in younger children. The recrudescent 
parasites from the Mozambique study [6] were whole-genome

genetic change responsible for recrudescence [22]. In our

recovery observed in our study. Resistance to artemisinin in 
P.  
falciparum is still confined to southeast Asia [2]. Although 
there have been a few reports of treatment failure to ACTs in 
travellers from Africa [23], to date there is no evidence of arte-
misinin resistance in Gabon [2]. High asexual parasite counts 
at baseline of up to 150 000 parasites/µL were reported, and all 
parasites were cleared within 36–48 hours. The outliers were not 
the ones with the highest asexual parasite counts and were less 
than 10%, suggesting that other factors such as host immunity, 
differences in pharmacokinetics, or developmental stage of the 
parasite could explain the delayed parasite clearance. Actually, 
the conventional criteria for parasite clearance time may not 
be useful in subgroups of patients such as those with asplenia 
[24]. Prolonged post-treatment prophylaxis by piperaquine was 
within the previously reported interval [25]. The current results 
show that this combination could be as effective as ACTs as 
shown in a previous study in the same area in which cure rates 
of artemether–lumefantrine and artesunate–amodiaquine were 
96% and 97%, respectively [26].
The proportion of gametocyte carriers at day 7 was similar 
to that in other studies in Africa by other authors [27]. The day

 Fosmidomycin–Piperaquine as Malaria NACT • CID 2018:66 (15 June) • 1829
7 gametocytemia was similar to the 2% gametocyte carriage 
observed after treatment with ACTs. In previous therapy studies 
using fosmidomycin with clindamycin or alone, an association 
between the treatment and a high cumulative gametocyte rate 
of around 70%–80% (gametocytes detected during at least 1 fol-
low-up visit) was observed [5].
The clinical tolerability of the drug combination was good. 
Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, transient, and 
generally not judged to have a likely causal relationship to the 
study medication, with the exception of gastrointestinal disturb-
ance that could also be related to malaria. There was rapid resolu-
tion of the abnormal laboratory parameters, with the majority of 
hemoglobin levels and platelet counts returning to normal within 
a few days following treatment. Rapid falls in hemoglobin levels 
could be attributed to the malarial infection or hemolysis, which 
was reported previously by Borrmann and colleagues [28]. The 
one transient increase of ALT was within the normal range.
QTc changes were highly relevant and the most important 
safety findings, although not unexpected. Previous work has 
shown that piperaquine treatment is associated with QT pro-
longation [25], whereas fosmidomycin does not show such an 
effect. There was no clinical sign or symptom of cardiotoxicity 
reported with the episodes of QT prolongation. This finding 
indicates that this drugs combination is to be used with caution 
in some cases, as recently recommended by the Malaria Policy 
Advisory Committee and the World Health Organization [8].
The use of the combination may be constrained by the twice-
daily administration of fosmidomycin in the high doses that 
have been investigated to date but also by the differential sched-
ule of the 2 partner drugs. For this reason, dose optimization 
studies should be aimed at, first, reducing the frequency of 
administration to once a day and, second, to reducing the total 
daily dose of fosmidomycin. The advantages of the combin-
ation fosmidomycin–piperaquine compared to other NACTs 
under development are that the manufacturing processes are 
established with the prospect of the combination being reg-
istered within 3 years. Importantly, several candidate drugs 
may take even longer depending on the availability of suitable 
partner drugs.
Limitations of the study include the design as an open-la-
bel trial and the small number of patients, particularly those 
aged <3 years. Another issue is the noncomparative nature of 
the study.
In conclusion, the combination fosmidomycin–piper-
aquine has demonstrated high efficacy in the treatment of 
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adults and children in 
Gabon. The combination was well tolerated, with the major-
ity of adverse events being transient and mild to moderate in 
severity. However, QTc prolongation was the most important 
safety finding, warranting further studies including at least an 
ACT comparator group, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic 
assessments, and other potential partner drugs.
