Abstract  
 
Background: Following infection with M. tuberculosis, children are at increased risk of 
progression to tuberculosis disease; a condition that can be challenging to diagnose. New 
estimation approaches for children have highlighted the gap between incidence and 
notifications, and suggest there is much more isoniazid-resistant and multidrug-resistant 
(MDR) disease than is identified. No work has yet quantified the burden of drug-resistant 
infection, considered other types of drug-resistance, or accounted for sampling uncertainty.  
 
Methods: We combined a mathematical model of tuberculosis in children with an analysis of 
drug-resistance patterns to produce country-level, regional, and global estimates of drug-
resistant infection and disease. We estimated the proportions of tuberculosis cases at a 
country-level with: isoniazid-monoresistance (HMR), rifampicin mono-resistance, MDR, 
fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR, second-line injectable resistant MDR, and MDR with 
resistance to both a fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable (XDR).  
 
Findings: We estimate 850,000 children developed tuberculosis in 2014; 58,000 with HMR-
tuberculosis, 25,000 with MDR-tuberculosis, and 1,200 with XDR-tuberculosis. We estimate 
67 million children are infected with M. tuberculosis; 5 million with HMR, 2 million with 
MDR, and 100,000 with XDR. Africa and South-East Asia have the highest numbers of 
tuberculosis in children, but WHO EMR, EUR and WPR regions also contribute substantially 
to the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis due to their much higher proportions of 
resistance.  
 
Interpretation: Far more drug-resistant tuberculosis occurs in children than is diagnosed, 
and there is a large pool of drug-resistant infection. This has implications for approaches to 
empiric treatment and preventive therapy in some regions.

 Introduction 
 
Tuberculosis in children is increasingly being recognised as a significant public health 
problem, and an important component of the total global burden of tuberculosis.1 New 
methodological developments for estimating the burden of tuberculosis in children have been 
adopted in the estimation process used by the Global Tuberculosis Programme (GTB) at the 
World Health Organization (WHO).2,3 The GTB estimated that in 2014, 1 million children 
developed tuberculosis disease.4 Understanding the burden is central to resource allocation, 
estimation of market size for potential drug, diagnostic or vaccine development, a tool to 
evaluate programmes and for advocacy. 
 
Following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) young children are at 
particularly high risk of progressing to tuberculosis disease. They are also more likely to 
develop severe forms of disease such as tuberculous meningitis and disseminated 
tuberculosis.5,6 WHO guidance suggests use of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in children 
under five years who have been exposed to tuberculosis.7 IPT has been shown to reduce the 
risk of progression from tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease by around 60% in HIV-
uninfected people (including children)8, and comparable reductions have been seen in 
children with HIV infection.9 Without treatment, tuberculosis disease carries a substantial 
risk of death in children, but if diagnosed and treated, outcomes are excellent.10 
 
Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance is frequently divided into drug-susceptible (DS)-
tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-tuberculosis. DS-tuberculosis suggests that the 
organism is susceptible to the two most effective first-line medications (isoniazid and 
rifampicin), whereas MDR-tuberculosis is defined as disease caused by M. tuberculosis 
resistant to both of these drugs. This division has programmatic motivations, as patients with 
strains that are resistant to only isoniazid can largely be treated successfully with standard 
first-line therapy, whereas those with MDR-tuberculosis cannot. However, the importance of 
isoniazid-mono-resistant (HMR)-tuberculosis is increasingly recognised. First, MDR strains 
have normally acquired resistance to isoniazid first and then resistance to rifampicin, in effect 
making HMR-tuberculosis the usual gateway to MDR disease. Second, those with 
asymptomatic HMR-tuberculosis infection are unlikely to respond to IPT. In addition to the 
emerging recognition of the importance of HMR-tuberculosis, a more comprehensive 
approach to second-line drug (SLD) resistance is required. The most important drug classes 
for treating MDR-tuberculosis are the fluoroquinolones and the second-line injectable 
medications; resistance to these drugs can influence MDR-tuberculosis treatment outcomes. 
 
Children are increasingly being identified, diagnosed and started on treatment for drug-
resistant (DR)-tuberculosis either when DR-tuberculosis is confirmed in an isolate from the 
child or when a child develops clinical disease in conjunction with exposure to a source case 
that has DR-tuberculosis.11 In addition, there is increasing recognition that to reduce the 
burden of tuberculosis it is necessary to identify and treat infected contacts before they 
become unwell.12 Children with DR-tuberculosis infection are a reservoir from which future 
cases will develop and children exposed to DR-tuberculosis are at times treated with non-
standardised preventive therapy.13 The treatment of DR-tuberculosis infection is usually 
directed against the drug susceptibility test (DST) pattern of the identified source case as 
child contacts demonstrate high concordance with the source case, if they do progress to 
disease.14,15  
 
 We previously estimated the burden of childhood tuberculosis in the 22 high tuberculosis 
burden countries but did not estimate a global burden or evaluate drug resistance. Other 
estimates of paediatric tuberculosis incidence exist, based on upwardly adjusting paediatric 
notification rates.3 These approaches do not, however, permit quantification of the burden of 
infection. Although previous estimates of isoniazid-resistant disease and MDR disease in 
children have been made,3,16 no investigators have quantified the burden of DR-tuberculosis 
infection in children. In addition, there have been no comprehensive attempts to quantify the 
different types of DR-tuberculosis disease in children. Moreover, approaches to date have not 
accounted for sample uncertainty associated with numbers of cases with drug-susceptibility 
testing.  
 
 
 Methods  
 
We extended a previously published model of tuberculosis burden estimation in children to 
180 countries for which the necessary input data were available, accounting for over 99% of 
the world population (see Appendix pages 3-5).2 Briefly, this model uses the WHO estimates 
of adult tuberculosis prevalence and a revised Styblo rule to estimate the annual risk of 
infection for children. Data on underlying demography, BCG coverage, HIV prevalence, and 
the natural history of disease in children is then used to estimate incidence of disease at a 
country-level. Uncertainty in all data is included and propagated through to results.  
 
We used the following classification and notation for drug-resistance types: DS - susceptible 
to isoniazid and rifampicin; HMR - isoniazid mono-resistant; RMR - rifampicin mono-
resistant; MDR - multidrug-resistant (resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin); MDR# - 
only resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin; FQR – MDR# with additional resistance to ≥1 
fluoroquinolone but not any second line injectables; SLR – MDR# with additional resistance 
to ≥1 second line injectable but not any fluoroquinolone; XDR – MDR# with additional 
resistance to ≥1 fluoroquinolone and to ≥1 second line injectable. We did not consider 
resistance to other anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as ethambutol, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, 
nor any second-line drugs other than the fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable 
medications. This classification of resistance can thus be summarised as follows: 
 all TB = DS + HMR + RMR + MDR; and MDR = MDR# + FQR + SLR + XDR (see 
Figure 1). 
 
Given the difficulties of bacteriological confirmation of tuberculosis in children, direct data 
on drug resistance types are rare. Systematic reviews suggest that the proportion of isoniazid 
resistance and MDR in treatment-naïve adults is a reasonable proxy for the proportion of the 
corresponding resistance in children3,16.  Analysis of surveillance data failed to find a 
difference between proportions of first-line drug resistance in children and adults regardless 
of treatment status.17 For first-line resistance, we therefore based the proportions of children 
resistant to each compound on data in treatment-naïve adults. For second-line resistance, data 
were not available stratified by treatment history; we therefore directly applied the 
proportions of drug resistance in these data. 
 
Drug resistance was determined using data from the Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug 
Resistance Surveillance at WHO. Data comprised counts of resistance by type from routine 
surveillance, and proportions (with confidence intervals) for each resistance type from 
surveys reported to WHO between 1988 and 2014,4,17 following guidelines for drug 
resistance surveillance.18 In most countries these data relate to patients with pulmonary 
tuberculosis, nearly all of whom are adults. Because of the potential for bias, data were not 
used from surveillance systems where less than 60% of treatment-naïve patients had a 
rifampicin-resistance result.18 For surveys, 82 countries contributed 166 country-years with 
complete data on HMR, RMR and MDR. For surveillance data, 87 countries contributed 627 
country-years with complete data on HMR, RMR and MDR, and there were a further 288 
country-years with data on only MDR resistance. 90 countries reported data on second-line 
resistance among MDR-tuberclosis individuals (MDR#, FQR, SLR and XDR): 33 country-
years from surveys and 273 country-years from surveillance; 227 country-years with 
complete data, 40 country-years with only data on XDR and FQR resistance, 43 country-
years with only data on XDR resistance. We converted proportions from survey data into 
counts by multiplying by the survey sample size. Exploratory data analysis suggested no clear 
trends so we aggregated data over the years 2005-2014.  
  
To sample the uncertain proportions for each DR category in each country, we used the 
following algorithm: 1) if a country had data, we used a Bayesian approach assuming 
multinomial counts with a flat Dirichlet prior on proportions, allowing sampling from the 
closed-form posterior for proportions (approach to missing category counts described 
Appendix page 9); 2) if a country had no data but 2 or more of its 5 nearest neighbours did, 
for each sample we randomly chose a neighbouring country and sampled its proportions as in 
1); 3) if a country had no data and fewer than 2 of its 5 nearest neighbours did, we randomly 
chose a country from the same epidemiological region and sampled its proportions as in 1); 
4) if a country had no data and no countries in the same epidemiological region had data, we 
randomly chose a country with data globally and sampled its proportions as in 1). The nine 
epidemiological regions used for analysis were the those defined in the WHO report 
methodological appendix19 for MDR analyses but the results are presented and discussed for 
the standard six WHO regions (see Appendix pages 8-9).4 
 
We combined 1,000 sampled proportions for each country using this algorithm with 10,000 
sampled country estimates of tuberculosis disease incidence and M. tuberculosis infection 
prevalence from our model (resampling the proportions to generate 10,000 stratified 
incidences). Country estimates of tuberculosis disease incidence and M. tuberculosis 
infection prevalence by drug-resistance type were then aggregated by WHO region and 
globally. Reported aggregate proportions of drug-resistance type are among total tuberculosis 
incidence in children. Standard world maps and a Gastner-Newman cartogram20 (which 
represents data by scaling areas) were used to visualize the geographic variation in median 
quantities.

 Results  
Proportions of DR-tuberculosis 
 
Overall we find that 6.9% (Inter-quartile range [IQR]: 6.6% – 7.1%) of tuberculosis in 
children is HMR and 2.9% (IQR: 2.7% – 3.1%) MDR (see Figure 2A and Appendix page 
11). Of MDR-tuberculosis in children, we find that 4.7% (IQR: 4.3% – 5.1%) is XDR (see 
Figure 2B and Appendix page 11). These patterns of drug resistance vary strongly both by 
region (see Figure 2 and Appendix page 11) and within region (see Appendix page 13-14). In 
the EUR region, in contrast to all the other regions, the proportion of cases that are MDR is 
now higher than HMR. While uncertain, the proportion of children with MDR who have 
second-line drug resistance seems lowest in the AFR and WPR regions. Global resampling 
was not reached for first- or second-line resistance estimates (see Appendix page 10). 
Incident DR-tuberculosis disease 
 
We estimate a total global paediatric incidence in 2014 of 847,000 (IQR: 558,000 – 
1,280,000) of which 58,300 (IQR: 38,300 – 87,000) were HMR-tuberculosis, 24,800 (IQR: 
16,100 – 37,400) MDR-tuberculosis and 1,160 (IQR: 757 – 1,770) XDR-tuberculosis. There 
is substantial variation regionally (see Table 1 for all drug resistance categories and also 
incidence in children under 5).  
 
The proportion of incident tuberculosis in children in 2014 with MDR-tuberculosis varies from very low 
percentages in the Americas and Western Europe (light red in  
Figure 3), through to over 30% in some of the former Soviet states in the WHO European (EUR) region 
(dark red,  
Figure 3). However, countries with low or moderate proportions of resistance in the SEA, 
AFR and WPR regions contribute to the majority of the incident MDR-tuberculosis in 
children, due to their high incidences and large child populations. 
Prevalent DR-tuberculosis infection 
 
We estimate that in 2014 the global paediatric burden of tuberculosis infection was 67.0 
million (IQR: 52.3 million – 85.7 million). Of these infections, 4.8 million (IQR: 3.8 million 
– 6.2 million) were HMR, 2.0 million (IQR: 1.6 million – 2.6 million) were MDR and 
101,000 (IQR: 78,100 - 131,000) were XDR. There is substantial regional variation (see 
Table 2 for all drug resistance categories and Appendix pages 17-18).

 Discussion  
 
Our modelling analysis suggests large numbers of children develop tuberculosis disease each 
year with a global incidence estimate of nearly 847,000. We also estimate a large burden of 
children with DR-tuberculosis each year: in the region of 58,000 with HMR-tuberculosis, 
25,000 with MDR-tuberculosis, and 1,200 with XDR-tuberculosis. A much larger number of 
children will be infected with M. tuberculosis; our estimate is that there are currently nearly 
67 million children globally infected. Of these there are a significant number with drug-
resistant infections: approaching 5 million with HMR, 2 million with MDR, and 100,000 
with XDR. While the WHO Africa and South-East Asia regions dominate the overall 
contribution to tuberculosis in children, EMR, EUR and WPR are substantial contributors to 
the burden of DR disease due to their much higher proportions of drug resistance.  
 
The estimated burden of DR-tuberculosis disease cases highlights a vast gap between 
incidence and treatment. Currently few children globally are treated for DR-tuberculosis. A 
recent individual patient systematic review and meta-analysis of children treated at any time 
in the past for MDR-tuberculosis was only able to identify 1,000 children.21 As we estimate 
25,000 children develop MDR-tuberculosis each year, clearly many children not being 
diagnosed and started on treatment, especially considering that rifampicin mono-resistance is 
clinically managed in the same way as MDR-tuberculosis. If more children are to be treated, 
the implications for diagnostics, funding, training, and an adequate supply of child-friendly 
drugs are profound.  
 
With the roll out of Xpert MTB/RIF, the significant risk of HMR in some regions may be 
overlooked and result in suboptimal treatment. If only Xpert MTB/RIF is used, HMR source 
cases may be diagnosed but considered susceptible to both rifampicin and isoniazid, and child 
contacts (who are likely infected with a HMR strain) given IPT. Although IPT will be 
effective for RMR-tuberculosis, it is unlikely that this will be diagnosed if only Xpert 
MTB/RIF is used; a positive rpoB gene mutation result usually results in the case being 
managed as MDR-tuberculosis. The child is unlikely to be given isoniazid, although this 
would be effective. In areas with high rates of HMR, where Xpert MTB/RIF is used alone, 
consideration could be given to using three months of both isoniazid and rifampicin as 
preventive therapy, so that if the source case has undiagnosed HMR-tuberculosis, the child 
will still benefit from rifampicin. It is also vital that Xpert MTB/RIF testing is followed up 
with testing for isoniazid susceptibility. If a child is exposed to an MDR-tuberculosis case, it 
is unlikely that either rifampicin or isoniazid would be effective as preventive therapy. An 
evolving body of evidence suggests fluoroquinolone-based regimens may be effective and 
three clinical trials are underway to investigate alternative treatments.22 The high rates of 
drug resistance in some regions will also have implications for the choice of drugs in the 
treatment of children with confirmed disease prior to the full DST becoming available (or 
where a full DST is unavailable) and also for children with clinically-diagnosed disease 
without a full DST profile from the source case. 
 
We can compare our estimates of paediatric MDR-tuberculosis and isoniazid-resistant 
tuberculosis with those of Jenkins et al.3 and Yuen et al.,16 respectively. Our estimates of the 
incidence of MDR-tuberculosis are somewhat lower than the 32,000 estimate of Jenkins et 
al.3 for 2013. Our global paediatric tuberculosis incidence estimate is approximately 20% 
smaller than that of Jenkins et al.3, but differences are heterogeneous by location: the 
 difference in MDR-tuberculosis incidence estimates is largely accounted for by our 
substantially smaller estimates for underlying paediatric tuberculosis incidence in China, 
India and Russia, without considering any differences in drug-resistance proportions. These 
countries account for a difference of over 7,000 paediatric MDR cases assuming the same 
proportion of MDR resistance (data not shown). To compare with the existing estimate of 
isoniazid resistance of 120,000 in Yuen et al.16 (which uses the underlying burden estimates 
from Jenkins et al.3), we need to aggregate our HMR and MDR categories (giving a global 
estimate in the region of 84,000 for all isoniazid resistance). Thus our estimate for isoniazid 
resistance is lower than that of Yuen et al.16 and as with MDR, the difference is largest in the 
WHO EUR, SEA and WPR regions and almost entirely accounted for by differences in 
underlying burden (data not shown), notably in China, India and Russia. It is a limitation of 
our approach that we have aggregated over subnational data in India and Russia; nationally-
representative surveys of drug-resistance in India and China are on-going. 
 
Our global estimate of 2.9% MDR in incident childhood tuberculosis is slightly lower than 
the WHO global estimate of 3.3% in all treatment naïve cases, largely reflecting lower MDR 
proportions in regions with higher proportions of tuberculosis incidence among children. 
 
Our analysis has several limitations, associated both with the mathematical model quantifying 
the burden of infection and disease, and with the analysis of patterns of drug resistance. The 
burden model inherits any limitations associated with WHO’s estimates of tuberculosis 
prevalence, and has recognised uncertainties in its treatment of HIV as a risk factor for 
disease progression, BCG vaccination as a source of protection, and ignores potential host or 
pathogen variation as sources of variation in progression rates.2 However, our burden model 
produces estimates that are comparable with an independent approach based on notification 
data,3 and has strengths in generating estimates of latent infection and age-disaggregated 
incidence.  
 
Our main focus was on TB disease in the year 2014, but in the absence of clear trends, we 
used aggregated drug-resistance data over a decade to inform proportions with each type. 
This may average over trends that exist in reality but for which these data do not have the 
power to detect. In estimating the burden of M. tuberculosis infection, we also assumed that 
the annual risk of infection has remained constant during years 1999 – 2014. The global 
tuberculosis prevalence per capita (country mean, weighted by current child population) was 
nearly 60% higher in 1999 than in 2014: the higher annual risks of infection in the past could 
imply today’s burden of latent M. tuberculosis infection is up to 30% larger than an estimate 
based on current infection risks.  
 
Some of the limitations may apply particularly to the inclusion of drug resistance: we have 
assumed that drug-resistance type is not correlated with exposure, infectiousness or 
likelihood of progression. We have assumed that the proportion of first-line drug resistance 
types in treatment-naïve patients reflects that in children and have not included any 
uncertainty in this relation. However, this assumption is supported for isoniazid resistance 
and MDR by systematic review.3,16 For second-line drug resistance, we have assumed that the 
proportions of different drug resistance in all patients reflects that in children, which may 
over-estimate levels of second-line drug resistance in children by including data from 
previously treated patients. Patients with MDR-tuberculosis with additional second-line 
resistance (including XDR-tuberculosis) may be epidemiologically and socially different to 
other groups with drug-resistant tuberculosis. They may be more likely to have been 
hospitalised or imprisoned and clustering may mean that the probability of a child being 
 exposed to a case is less than for other forms of disease. Although, they are more likely to 
have been retreated, it is reassuring that analysis of surveillance data has failed to find a 
difference between first-line resistance proportions in children and adults of any treatment 
status.17 Finally, we have only evaluated the drug resistance categories determined by the 
drugs defining MDR- and XDR-tuberculosis. Resistance to other drugs has not been 
estimated due to shortage of data, partly resulting from technical difficulties in DST (e.g. 
cycloserine and clofazimine) and partly due to lack of good quality diagnostics in much of 
the world (e.g. pyrazinamide).  As a result we expect that global needs in terms of effective 
regimens will be higher than that implied by the burden estimates that we report. 
 
A strength of our work is our treatment of uncertainty. Our analysis of drug-resistance 
patterns is an improvement over previous work in this respect, since it captures the 
uncertainty implicit in the numbers of cases determining proportions, and could be applied to 
determining the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis in all age groups. While a 
geographically-structured hierarchical model may have allowed use of country-level 
variables in imputing missing drug resistance patterns, our regional resampling approach does 
capture regional patterns and variance from resampling, and is relatively simple and 
transparent. 
 
This approach could be built upon to analyse differences between countries and between 
regions, and to identify drivers of drug resistance patterns. As more data become available, it 
may be possible validate the model and also use it to make predictions into the future. 
Quantifying the levels of disease incidence and infection prevalence with particular drug-
resistance phenotypes can also feed into market size calculations for second-line drugs, and 
for new drugs. Finally, this framework would allow investigation of different options for 
empirical studies and their location to improve the precision of these estimates. Comparison 
with other burden estimates of DR-tuberculosis, where there is overlap, highlights the 
importance of better quantifying the underlying burden of childhood tuberculosis in key 
settings such as China, India and Russia. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Far more DR-tuberculosis occurs in children than is diagnosed, and there is a large pool of 
DR-tuberculosis infection. This could have implications for approaches to empiric treatment 
and preventive therapy in some regions.

Underlying mathematical model of tuberculosis burden in 
children 
!
A mechanistic mathematical model that uses estimates of adult tuberculosis prevalence to 
model the process of infection and progression to disease in different age-groups was used to 
generate estimates of latent infection and tuberculosis incidence in 180 countries in 2013. The 
model has been previously published and subsequently extended from the 22 high 
tuberculosis burden countries to a global model covering 180 countries.  
 
The model has a number of uncertain data and natural history inputs, and the uncertainty 
inherent in these quantities is represented by generating a sample of 10,000 outputs running 
the model across a Latin hypercube sample from the distributions characterizing these input 
values. A summary is provided below.

Description of data used 
 
We obtained data on country demography for 2013 from UN ESA, Population Division. 
Where necessary, 5-year age categories were disaggregated under the assumption of 
uniformly distributed ages. These data were used to generate the number of children at risk in 
each country by age.

WHO estimates of adult tuberculosis prevalence were obtained from for 2014, together with 
95% uncertainty bounds. Uncertainty in per-capita prevalence was represented by gamma 
distributions, parameterised by taking the quoted ranges defined by the upper and lower 
bounds as 1.96 x the standard deviation, and the quoted point estimate as the mean. WHO 
notification data from 2010 were used to estimate the proportion of incident tuberculosis that 
is smear positive for the community ARI estimate. The same estimate was used for all 
countries to avoid bias resulting from different case detection infrastructures etc. 
 
BCG vaccination coverage estimates were obtained for 2014 from WHO. The BCG 
vaccination coverages were used to determine the fraction of children whose risks of 
progression from infection to disease were moderated by BCG.  
 
HIV prevalence estimates in those aged under 15 were available for 82 countries from 
UNAIDS, together with 95% uncertainty bounds. Countries for which there were not 
estimates reported from this source were assumed to have negligible HIV prevalence in those 
under 15 years of age. Uncertainty in the prevalences was represented by gamma 
distributions, parameterised by taking the quoted ranges defined by the upper and lower 
bounds were taken as 1.96 x the standard deviation, and the quoted point estimate as the 
mean. This HIV prevalence was assumed to be uniform by age in those under 15. Degree of 
immunosuppression or ART was not considered.  
 
Country linking and exclusions 
 
The WHO tuberculosis estimate and notification data were linked with the demographic, HIV, 
and BCG sets by 3 letter ISO code where possible, and by hand otherwise. Various countries 
were excluded where it was not possible to link them across the data. The WHO version of 
country names was used.

incidence) 
 
Summary of differences from previous work 
 
The largest difference is the set of countries to which the method is applied. Here, we apply 
the model to a set of 180 countries and use tuberculosis data from 2014; whereas in our 
previously published report (see reference in main article), we considered only the 22 highest 
burden tuberculosis countries (HBCs), using data largely from 2010.  
 
We only consider the ‘community’ model of infection in this work, as data to inform the 
household method were not available for a large enough number of countries. We also shifted 
from using the latitude of a country’s capital to the latitude of a country’s centroid in the 
model variant with latitude variation in BCG efficacy.

WHO regions used 
 
The three key differences between the two sets of regions are (i) the split between Central and 
Eastern Europe based on well-studied and known differences in MDR-TB epidemiology, (ii) 
the separate region of high-income countries across the world who are expected to have 
stronger health systems that are closer to universal health coverage (considered proxy for 
lower levels of acquired drug resistance), and (iii) the split of the African region into high and 
low HIV prevalence (HIV being a key determinant of TB burden). The nine epidemiological 
regions are African countries with high HIV prevalence, African countries with low HIV 
prevalence, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, high-income countries, Latin America, the 
Eastern Mediterranean Region (excluding high-income countries), the South-East Asia 
Region (excluding high-income countries) and the Western Pacific Region (excluding high-
income countries).

Missing data 
 
With complete data on the counts !!!! !!! !!! !!! of susceptible, HMR, RMR, and MDR 
tuberculosis we assumed a !"#!!!!!!!!! (i.e. flat) prior on the proportions. Since this is 
conjugate to the multinomial distribution, the posterior was therefore !"#!! ! !!! ! !
!!! ! ! !!! ! ! !!!. 
 
When, additionally (and e.g.) data was available on the total count !! ! !!! ! !!! ! !!! !
!!!, and the number MDR (!!!! !!!! !!! all missing due to incomplete DST), we sampled 
from the posterior summing over all possible unobserved missing counts compatible with the 
total. In effect, this amounts to a draw from a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. In 
combination 
 
!
!!
!!!!!!!!!!!! !!"#!! ! !! ! !!!! ! ! !! ! !!!! ! ! !! ! !!!! ! ! !! ! !!!! 
 
Gibbs sampling was used to sample from these distributions using every 30th draw in a chain 
of 30,000 iterations (after a burn-in of 1,000 iterations). 
 
Other combinations of missing drug resistance counts described in the article were handled 
analogously.
