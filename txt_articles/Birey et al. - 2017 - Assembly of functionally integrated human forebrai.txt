 The development of the nervous system involves a coordinated succession of events including the 
migration of GABAergic neurons from ventral to dorsal forebrain and their integration into 
cortical circuits. However, these interregional interactions have not yet been modelled with human 
cells. Here, we generate from human pluripotent cells three-dimensional spheroids resembling 
either the dorsal or ventral forebrain and containing cortical glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. 
These subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids can be assembled to recapitulate the saltatory 
migration of interneurons similar to migration in fetal forebrain. Using this system, we find that in 
Timothy syndrome– a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the CaV1.2 
calcium channel, interneurons display abnormal migratory saltations. We also show that after 
migration, interneurons functionally integrate with glutamatergic neurons to form a 
microphysiological system. We anticipate that this approach will be useful for studying 
development and disease, and for deriving spheroids that resemble other brain regions to assemble 
circuits in vitro.
INTRODUCTION
The formation of the human cerebral cortex involves the assembly of circuits composed of 
glutamatergic neurons, which are generated in the dorsal forebrain (pallium), and 
GABAergic interneurons, which are born in the ventral forebrain (subpallium)1–3. After 
specification, interneurons migrate long distances over several months during human fetal 
development and subsequently undergo activity-dependent maturation and integration into 
cortical circuits1,4. Genetic or environmental perturbations of this process can lead to an 
imbalance of cortical excitation and inhibition and are thought to contribute to 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (ASD)5,6. 
These key developmental processes, which occur mostly in mid-to-late gestation, have been 
largely inaccessible for functional studies in humans7,8. Moreover, the directed 
differentiation, and particularly the functional maturation of cortical interneurons from 
human pluripotent stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells, hiPSC, or embryonic stem 
cells, hESCs), has been challenging9,10. To date, no reliable, personalized models exist to 
study the migration of human interneurons and their functional integration into cortical 
ensembles.
Here, we leverage a 3D differentiation approach using hPSCs to specify neural spheroids 
resembling the pallium (human cortical spheroids, hCS) or the subpallium (human 
subpallium spheroids, hSS), and we subsequently assemble them in vitro to model for the 
first time the saltatory migration of human interneurons towards the cerebral cortex and their 
functional integration into microcircuits.
GENERATION OF SUBDOMAIN-SPECIFIC FOREBRAIN SPHEROIDS
We have previously described the generation of floating, 3D neural cultures from hPSCs 
resembling the pallium (hCS) that contain deep and superficial layer cortical glutamatergic 
neurons, as well as astrocytes11. To specify spheroids resembling the ventral forebrain or the 
subpallium (hSS), we exposed early spheroids that were patterned by double SMAD 
inhibition to small molecules modulating the WNT and SHH pathways in the presence of

 the growth factors FGF2 and EGF (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 1). At day 25 of hSS in 
vitro differentiation, we observed a strong induction of the transcription factor NKX2-1 in 
hSS accompanied by high levels of FOXG1 expression and down-regulation of the pallial 
marker EMX1, suggestive of a subpallial fate (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Table 2). We next 
examined the hSS cytoarchitecture in cryosections and noticed that NKX2-1 was expressed 
in ventricular zone (VZ)-like structures at day 25 (Fig. 1c) but was distributed more broadly 
at later stages (Fig. 1d). At day 60, we observed strong expression of GABA and the GABA-
synthesizing enzyme GAD67 in neurons (Fig. 1e, f). Of the known markers that identify 
GABAergic subtypes, somatostatin (SST), calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) were the most 
strongly expressed; at later stages (> 200 days), and consistent its expression later in 
development in vivo12, parvalbumin (PV) was also present (Fig. 1g, h; Extended Data Fig. 
1).
To comprehensively characterize hSS and hCS, we performed single cell transcriptional 
profiling at day 105 of differentiation using stochastic barcoding13 (n= 11,838 cells from 
hCS and hSS; BD™ Resolve system; Fig. 1i). Clustering of cells isolated from either hCS or 
hSS using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t–SNE)14 revealed a separation 
of the two conditions. Neurons expressing STMN2 were localized on the upper left of the t–
SNE space, whereas progenitors and mitotically active cells were distributed in the lower 
right (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Further examination identified several subdomains in hCS 
(Fig. 1j, Extended Data Fig. 2d), including a group of glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1+) 
expressing the cortical layer markers TBR1, FEZF2, CTIP2; two groups of intermediate 
progenitors expressing TBR2, INSM1, HES6; and a group of dorsal progenitors expressing 
LHX2, PAX6 and GLAST1 that also encompass HOPX+ outer radial glia-like cells. In 
contrast, hSS included a cluster of ventral neural progenitors, a group of GABAergic cells 
expressing DLX1, GAD1, SLC32A1, SCG2, SST, and a small group of oligodendrocyte 
progenitors (OLIG2, SOX10) (Supplementary Table 3; Extended Data Fig. 2e–m). Astroglia 
from both hCS and hSS clustered together and close to a small group of cells that resemble 
the choroid plexus (TTR+, SLC13A4+). No cells with mesodermal or endodermal identity 
were found.
We next explored the functional properties of hSS. We found that 7 days of exposure to the 
neurosteroid and GABAA receptor agonist allopregnanolone (AlloP) combined with a 3-day 
exposure to retinoic acid (RA), significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous calcium 
spikes (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Notably, exposure to AlloP with or without RA did not 
alter subpallial fate, neurotransmitter identity or the GABAergic subtypes in hSS (Extended 
Data Fig. 3d–l). As a result, these two conditions were used for subsequent experiments. 
Considering the presence of spontaneous calcium activity and astrocytes (Fig. 1j), we 
investigated synaptogenesis in hSS using array tomography (AT). We found expression of 
the presynaptic protein synapsin-1 (SYN1) and the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT (Fig. 
1k). Lastly, we used whole-cell patch clamping to record from neurons in sections of hSS 
and found that ~75% of neurons generated action potentials in response to depolarization 
(Fig. 1l). At the same time, ~60% of neurons exhibit spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic 
currents (IPSCs) that reverse in direction around the chloride reversal potential and are 
abolished by the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (10 μM) (Fig. 1m, n; in contrast to 
synaptic currents in hCS, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 4).

 ASSEMBLY OF FOREBRAIN SPHEROIDS
To develop a model for the migration of interneurons into the cerebral cortex, we placed hCS 
and hSS adjacent to each other inside a conical tube (Fig. 2a). We used day 60 hCS that 
resembled the mid-gestation pallium11, a developmental stage characterized by extensive 
migration of interneurons. After 3 days, the two spheroids fused (Fig. 2b). we used viral 
labeling of spheroids before assembly to monitor cell migration, and used a previously 
described DNA element near the Dlx1 and Dlx2 locus (Dlxi1/2b) that labels medial 
ganglionic eminences (MGE) and derivatives15,16. Approximately 65% of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ 
cells in hSS expressed GAD67 and contained GABA and markers for GABAergic neuron 
subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). We then used live imaging to monitor the position of 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in fused hSS-hCS over multiple weeks. We observed a progressive 
movement of eGFP+ cells from hSS into hCS (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Video 1). This 
movement was specific to fused hSS-hCS and unidirectional: we observed minimal 
movement either from hCS into hSS in fused hSS-hCS or from hSS into hSS in fused hSS-
hSS (Fig. 2d; Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). The same pattern of migration could be observed 
for hSS-hCS assembled at later stages (Extended Data Fig. 5g). When hSS were plated on a 
coverslip, the migration was inefficient or absent (Extended Data Fig. 5h–j; Supplementary 
Video 2) similar to rodent cultures17. In the first 10 days after assembly, the vast majority of 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells that migrated away from hSS had the leading process positioned 
towards hCS at either a 45° or 90° angle relative to the interface (Extended Data Fig. 5k). At 
30–50 days after asssembly, 60% of the migrated cells were localized within the outer 100 
μm of hCS (Extended Data Fig. 5l), and a large population of interneurons migrated into 
hCS as shown by optical clearing (Fig. 2e). Interestingly, we also observed processes of 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells that briefly touched VZ-like regions, reminiscent of rodent ventricle-
directed migration18 (Supplementary Video 3; Extended Data Fig. 5m–o). We next 
investigated the fate of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in hSS after 2 weeks of migration from hSS 
into hCS by isolating single cells and performing transcriptome analysis (Extended Data Fig. 
6a). We found that the majority of migrated cells expressed subpallial markers (DLX1, 
DLX2, DLX5, DLX6) and cortical interneuron markers (GAD1, GAD2, VGAT, CELF4) 
(Extended Data Fig. 6b; Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). We found few cells expressing PAX6 or 
TH, which are indicative of olfactory interneurons, or SP8, GSX2 or CHAT, which are 
indicative of striatal neurons, suggesting that the Dlxi1/2b reporter is primarily labelling 
cortical interneurons (Extended Data Fig. 6b).
We next used confocal imaging to capture the movement of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP-labelled cells in 
fused hSS-hCS. Interneurons moved in a saltatory pattern followed by extensive pauses (Fig. 
2f). This characteristic, cyclical movement involved an extension of the leading process in 
one direction followed by a transient swelling of the soma and nuclear translocation 
(nucleokinesis) (Fig. 2g, h). This pattern of migration is similar to that observed in 
rodents19,20, although the ratio between the length of the leading process and the diameter of 
the soma in hSS-derived interneurons is almost double the ratio in mouse interneurons 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). To validate the biological relevance of interneuron migration in hSS-
hCS, we performed live imaging of cells labelled with the Dlxi1/2b::eGFP reporter in human 
forebrain tissue (gestational weeks, GW18 and GW20; Fig. 2i). Dlxi1/2b::eGFP-labeled

 cells in fetal tissue co-expressed GABA and NKX2–1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f) and 
displayed a similar morphology and pattern of migration (Fig. 2j, k; Extended Data Fig. 8g–
l; Supplementary Videos 4 & 5).
We tested pharmacological manipulation of interneuron migration in fused hSS-hCS 
(Extended Data Fig. 7e). We imaged the movement of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP cells before and after 
exposure to a CXCR4 receptor antagonist (AMD3100). This receptor is expressed in hSS 
(Extended Data Fig. 3l) and plays a key role in the migration of cortical interneurons21. 
AMD3100 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in saltation frequency, saltation 
length, speed when mobile (Extended Data Fig. 7f–h) and a change in the path directness 
(Extended Data Fig 7i, j; Supplementary Video 6).
USING ASSEMBLED SPHEROIDS TO MODEL TIMOTHY SYNDROME
We next investigated whether assembled hSS-hCS could be used to model migration defects. 
Previous work in rodents has indicated that L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) play a critical 
role in interneuron migration by regulating saltation frequency and migration termination17. 
LTCCs have been repeatedly associated with neuropsychiatric disease22,23, and gain-of-
function mutations in the LTCCs-encoding CACNA1C gene lead to Timothy syndrome 
(TS)– a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism spectrum disorder and 
epilepsy24,25. We generated hSS and hCS from hiPSCs from 3 patients with TS carrying the 
recurrent p.G406R substitution (Fig. 3a) and compared them to 4 control subjects (Extended 
Data Fig. 9a, b; Supplementary Table 1). We did not observe defects in the differentiation of 
TS hiPSC lines into hSS (Extended Data Fig. 9c–g). Calcium imaging showed increased 
residual calcium following depolarization in hSS-derived TS neurons, as well as in hCS-
derived TS neurons compared to control cells (Fig. 3b; Extended Data Fig. 9h, i), similar to 
what we have previously shown in TS hiPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons26. We 
investigated the migration of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in fused hSS-hCS (Fig. 3c; Extended 
Data Fig. 9j; Supplementary Video 7) and found an increase in saltation frequency in 
neurons from all three TS patients (Fig. 3d; Extended Data Fig. 9k) in agreement with the 
role of calcium in interneuron motility17. Interestingly, the saltation length and the speed 
when mobile were reduced in TS (Fig. 3d, e; Extended Data Fig. 9l, m) resulting in a less 
efficient migration (Fig. 3f). Moreover, this effect was cell-autonomous because migration of 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells from TS-hSS into control-hCS did not influence the phenotype (Fig. 
3d, e; Extended Data Fig. 9k–m). To further validate these results, we electroporated cDNA 
encoding TS– and wild type (WT)– CaV1.2 into slices of mouse E14 ganglionic eminences 
and performed live imaging (Extended Data Fig. 9n, o). We observed a defect in mouse TS-
CaV1.2 electroporated neurons displaying more frequent but shorter saltations (Extended 
Data Fig. 9p, q). To determine if the TS migratory phenotype was a result of LTCCs activity 
and could be reversed, we treated fused hSS-hCS with LTCCs blockers (Fig. 3g; Extended 
Data Fig. 9r–u). We found that application of the LTCCs blocker nimodipine significantly 
reduced saltation length and speed when mobile in control Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells. However, 
the deficit in these parameters was rescued in TS Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells following exposure 
to nimodipine. Moreover, roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that increases 
voltage-dependent inactivation of CaV1.227,28, also rescued saltation length in TS 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells. These results indicate that the migration defect in interneurons

 carrying the TS gain-of-function mutation can be restored by reducing the activity of 
LTCCs.
INTEGRATION OF INTERNEURONS IN ASSEMBLED SPHEROIDS
To investigate the hSS-derived neurons that migrated into hCS, we examined their single cell 
transcriptome at 4 weeks after assembly (Fig. 4a). t-SNE analysis indicated 3 clusters (Fig. 
4b), with Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in hSS distributed primarily in cluster A, while 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells migrated into hCS primarily distributed in clusters B and C (Fig. 4c). 
Cells in all clusters expressed similar levels of GAD1 and CELF4, but cluster B and C 
down-regulated the subpallial marker PBX3 (Extended Data Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table 
4). Migrated cells displayed expression changes in genes previously associated with 
interneuron migration, including ERBB4, NNAT, MALAT1, SOX11 and NXPH129,30 (Fig. 
4d). These neurons also had higher levels of activity-dependent genes, including FOS, the 
AMPA-receptor trafficking regulator GRIP231 and IGF132, as well as the disease-related 
genes RASD133, TCF434 (Fig. 4d; Extended Data Fig. 6c). We next examined dendrites of 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in hSS and in fused hSS-hCS. We found that hSS-derived cells that 
moved into hCS increased the complexity of their branching (Fig. 4e; Extended Data Fig. 
10a, b). We then measured their electrical properties in hSS before and after assembly. We 
found that Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells that had migrated into hCS had double the maximum 
action potential generation rate as compared to Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in unfused hSS or to 
non-migrated cells in fused hSS-hCS (Fig. 4f; Extended Data Fig. 10c). We then assessed 
the integration of migrated neurons by using AT and observed the presence of gephyrin 
(GPHN), a postsynaptic protein localized to GABAergic synapses, in hCS fused to hSS but 
not in unfused hCS (Fig. 4d; Extended Data Fig. 10d). We constructed ‘synaptograms’ 
consisting of a series of high-resolution sections through a single synapse, and found 
colocalization of eGFP from Dlxi1/2b-labeled cells with the presynaptic proteins SYN1 and 
VGAT and adjacent to the postsynaptic protein GPHN (Extended Data Fig. 10e). To 
investigate the presence of functional synapses in migrated Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ neurons, we 
performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings in sliced hSS-hCS. We found that 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ that migrated into hCS display both excitatory postsynaptic currents 
(EPSCs, downward deflecting) and IPSCs (upward deflecting) (Fig. 4h). Moreover, after 
migration into hCS, these cells primarily receive EPSCs rather than IPSCs and their synaptic 
input increases approximately 3-fold (Fig. 4i; Extended Data Fig. 10f; Supplementary Table 
5). In parallel, glutamatergic neurons from hCS, which exhibit only EPSCs before assembly, 
also begin receiving IPSCs and show an overall increase in synaptic input following the 
migration of interneurons from hSS (Fig. 4j; Extended Data Fig. 10g). Lastly, to assess the 
functional integration of hCS and hSS neurons into neural networks, we applied electrical 
stimulation to the hCS side of assembled hSS-hCS to trigger glutamate release from 
excitatory neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation electrode while simultaneously 
recording EPSCs and IPSCs in Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells that migrated into hCS (Extended 
Data Fig. 10h, i). We found that electrical simulation evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) immediately 
following simulation (> 5 ms); this was followed by presumed multisynaptic IPSCs (< 15 
ms) that were sensitive to gabazine. Together, these data demonstrate that hSS integrate with 
hCS to assemble functional human microcircuits in 3D cultures.

 DISCUSSION
We demonstrate the generation of a human 3D microphysiological system that includes 
functionally-integrated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. This platform has several 
advantages in comparison to previous adherent or 3D methods9,10,16,35–38. First, it involves 
the directed differentiation of subdomains of the forebrain that functionally interact in 
development. In contrast to whole-brain organoids and organoids resembling broader brain 
regions35,38, this approach allows for modularity by combining separately patterned 
spheroids into multi-region neural 3D cultures. Second, this system captures in vitro more 
elaborate developmental processes, including the saltatory migration of interneurons towards 
the cerebral cortex. Using live imaging of the human forebrain, we demonstrate that this 
migration is accurately recapitulated with our assembled 3D platform. Third, by enabling 
their migration into an active neural network, interneurons integrate into a synaptically-
connected microphysiological system without the requirement of seeding onto rodent 
cortical cultures or brain slices. Assembling networks using this modular system may 
facilitate the study of excitation to inhibition interplay during cortical development.
We also demonstrate that forebrain subdomains derived from hiPSCs and fused in vitro can 
be used to identify the transcriptional changes associated with interneuron migration and to 
model disease processes that are otherwise inaccessible. We find that cortical interneurons 
derived from TS subjects display a cell-autonomous migration defect whereby they move 
more frequently but less efficiently. Moreover, the TS interneuron defect is rescued by 
pharmacologically manipulating LTCC. This aberrant interneuron migration, taken together 
with our previous studies in cortical glutamatergic neurons26,39,40, suggest the presence of 
abnormal cortical development and function in TS.
Lastly, the in vitro specification of various subdomains of the developing human brain from 
hPSC and their assembly into 3D cultures opens the opportunity for studying the interaction 
of specific neuronal cell types and for generating and probing neural circuits within 
personalized human microphysiological systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture of hPSCs
The hPSC lines used in this study were validated using standardized methods as previously 
shown26,41. Cultures were tested for and maintained Mycoplasma free. A total of 6 control 
hiPSC lines derived from fibroblasts harvested from 5 subjects (2 males and 3 females), plus 
the human embryonic stem cell line H9, and 7 hiPSC lines derived from fibroblasts 
harvested from 3 subjects with TS (1 female and 2 males) carrying the pG406R mutation 
were used for experiments (Supplementary Table 1; subjects 7643 and 9862 are from26,41). 
The TS point mutation in exon 8a of CACNA1C was verified by PCR as previously 
described41. The hiPSC line H20961 was derived by the Gilad laboratory42. Approval for 
this study was obtained from the Stanford IRB Panel and informed consent was obtained 
from all subjects.

 Generation from hPSC of hCS and hSS
Human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC or hESC) were cultured on inactivated mouse 
embryonic fibroblast feeders (EmbryoMax PMEF; Millipore) in hPSC medium containing 
DMEM/F12 (1:1, Life Technologies, 11330), Knockout Serum (20%, Life Technologies, 
10828), non-essential amino acids (1 mM, Life Technologies, 11140), GlutaMax (1: 200, 
Life Technologies, 35050), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich M3148), penicillin 
and streptomycin (1:100, Life Technologies, 15070), and supplemented with FGF2 (10 
ng/ml diluted in 0.1% BSA; R&D Systems).
The generation of hCS from hPSC was performed as previously described11. To initiate the 
generation of hCS or hSS, intact hiPSC colonies were lifted from the plates using dispase 
(0.35 mg/ml) and transferred into ultralow attachment plastic dishes (Corning) in hPSC 
medium supplemented with the two SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin (DM; 5 μM; Sigma) 
and SB-431542 (SB; 10 μM, Tocris), and the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM; EMD 
Chemicals). For the first five days, the hPSC medium was changed every day and 
supplemented with dorsomorphin and SB-431542. On the sixth day in suspension, neural 
spheroids were transferred to neural medium (NM) containing Neurobasal-A (Life 
Technologies, 10888), B-27 supplement without vitamin A (Life Technologies, 12587), 
GlutaMax (Life Technologies, 1:100), penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, 
1:100) and supplemented with the growth factors EGF (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems) and FGF2 
(20 ng/ml; R&D Systems) until day 24. For the generation of hSS, the medium was 
supplemented with additional small molecules during the first 23 days in culture; a 
schematic showing the recipes is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4a). The hSS-IS condition 
involved the addition of the Wnt pathway inhibitor IWP-2 (5 μM; Selleckchem) from day 4 
until day 24, and the SHH pathway agonist SAG (smoothened agonist; 100 nM; 
Selleckchem) from day 12 to day 24. The hSS-ISA condition also included IWP-2 (inhibitor 
of WNT production–2) and SAG (smoothened agonist) with the addition of 
allopregnanolone (AlloP 100 nM; Cayman Chemicals) from day 15 to day 23, while the 
hSS-ISRA condition included AlloP (100nM) from day 15–23, and a brief exposure (day 
12–15) to retinoic acid (RA 100 nM; Sigma). From day 25 to 42, the NM for both the hCS 
and hSS conditions, was supplemented with the growth factors BDNF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech) 
and NT3 (20 ng/ml; Peprotech) with medium changes every other day. From day 43 
onwards, hCS and hSS were maintained in unsupplemented NM with medium changes every 
four to six days.
Viral labeling and assembly of neural spheroids
The viral infection of the 3D neural spheroids was performed as previously described11,43. 
Briefly, hCS or hSS were transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifudge Eppendorf tube 
containing 300 μl ΝΜ with virus and incubated overnight. The next day, neural spheroids 
were transferred into fresh NM medium in ultralow attachment plates. Lentivirus (Lenti-
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP; construct reported and applied in refs15,16 and received from J.L. 
Rubenstein) was generated by transfecting HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and concentrating the supernatant with the Lenti-X concentrator 
(Clontech) 72 hrs later. Adenovirus (AAV-DJ1-hSYN::mCherry) was generated in the 
Stanford Gene Vector and Virus Core at Stanford.

differentiation), which were virally labeled 8–10 days before, were transferred to a 1.5 ml 
microcentrifudge Eppendorf tube for three days and placed in an incubator. During this time, 
more than 95% of hCS and hSS fused. These hSS-hCS cultures were carefully transferred 
into 24 well ultralow attachment plates (Corning) using a cut P-1000 pipette tip and medium 
changes were performed very gently every two to three days.
Cryopreservation
hCS were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 8% sucrose for 30 min to 2 hrs. They 
were then washed in PBS, transferred to 15% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C and then to 
30% sucrose for 48–72 hrs. Subsequently, they were transferred into embedding medium 
(Tissue-Tek OCT Compound 4583, Sakura Finetek), snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at 
−80°C. For immunohistochemistry, 10 to 20 μm thick sections were cut using a cryostat 
(Leica). Human brain tissue was fixed in 4% PFA for 48 hrs, washed in PBS and transferred 
to 30% sucrose for one week. Sections were then embedded in OCT and 30% sucrose (1:1) 
and sectioned into 30 μm sections using a Leica cryostat.
Immunohistochemistry
Cryosections were washed with PBS to remove excess OCT and blocked in 10% goat serum 
(NGS), 0.3% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. The sections were 
then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 10% GS 
and 0.3% Triton X-100. PBS was used to wash off the primary antibodies and the 
cryosections were incubated with secondary antibodies in PBS with 10% NGS and 0.3% 
Triton X–100 for 1 hr. The following primary antibodies were used for 
immunohistochemistry: anti–NKX2.1 (rabbit, 1:200; Santa Cruz: sc-13040), anti–MAP2 
(guinea pig, 1:1,000; Synaptic Systems: 188004), anti–GABA (rabbit, 1:1,000; Sigma: 
A2052), anti–GAD67 (mouse, 1:1,000; Millipore: MAB5406), anti–SST (rat, 1:200; 
Millipore: MAB354), anti–CR (rabbit, 1:1,000; Swant: CR7697), anti–CB (rabbit, 1:1,000; 
Swant: CB38), anti–PV (rabbit, 1:6,000; Swant: PV27), anti–PV (mouse 1:1,000; Millipore: 
MAB1572), anti–GFP (chicken, 1:1,500; GeneTex: GTX13970), anti–DCX (guinea pig, 
1:1,000; Millipore: AB2253); anti–TBR1 (rabbit, 1:200; Abcam: AB31940), anti–GFAP 
(rabbit, 1:1,000; DAKO Z0334), anti–CTIP2 (rat, 1:300; Abcam: AB18465), anti–OCT4 
(rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), anti–SSEA4 (mouse, 1:200, Cell Signaling 
Technology). AlexaFluo Dyes (Life Technologies) were used at 1:1000 dilution for 
amplifying the signal. Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33258 (Life Technologies). 
Cryosections were mounted for microscopy on glass slides using Aquamount (Thermo 
Scientific) and imaged on a Zeiss M1 Axioscope or Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. 
Images were processed in ImageJ (Fiji).
Dissociation of hCS and hSS
For the enzymatic dissociation of hCS and hSS for culture in monolayer and 
immunocytochemistry, spheroids were incubated with Accutase (Innovative Cell 
Technologies) for 25 min at 37°C, washed with NM and gently triturated using a P-200 
pipet. Cells were plated on poly-ornithine/laminin (Sigma) coated glass coverslips (15 mm;

 Werner) at a density of ~1 spheroid per two coverslips in NM supplemented with BDNF and 
NT3.
To dissociate hCS and hSS for single cell profiling, we adapted a previously published 
protocol used for primary human fetal brain tissue44. Briefly, up to 6 spheroids were 
chopped using a #10 blade and then incubated in papain enzyme solution (27.3 U/ml; 
Worthington), EBSS (1×, Sigma), 0.46% Sucrose (Sigma), 26 mM NaHCO3 (Sigma), 0.5 
mM EDTA (Sigma) at 37°C for 70 min in an incubator (5% CO2). The digested spheroids 
were then washed and carefully triturated in a trypsin inhibitor solution EBSS, 0.46% 
Sucrose (Sigma), 26 mM NaHCO3 (Sigma), 15–30 mg Trypsin Inhibitor (Sigma). After 
centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.2% BSA diluted in PBS and supplemented 
with Y-27632 (10 μM; EMD Chemicals) and the cells were used for FACS.
Mouse slice cultures
Organotypic cultures of mouse coronal forebrain slices were prepared following published 
methods45 with some modifications. Whole brains from E14–E18 mouse embryos were 
embedded in 4% low-melting point agarose and slices were cut at 250–300 μm using a Leica 
VT1200 vibrotome in complete HBSS (100 ml of 10× HBSS without Ca or Mg, 2.5 ml of 
1M HEPES buffer at pH 7.4, 30 ml of 1M D-glucose, 10 ml of 100 mM CaCl2, 10 ml of 100 
mM MgSO4, and 4 ml of 1 M NaHCO3). Slices with visible forebrain structures were 
placed in membrane inserts (diameter, 13 mm; pore size, 8 μm; Costar) coated with Poly-L-
orthinine and Laminin (Sigma) overnight. They were cultured in a Basal Medium Eagle (39 
mL, Life Technologies, #21010046) supplemented with 12.9 ml of complete HBSS, 1.35 ml 
of 1M D-glucose, 250 μl of 200 mM GlutaMax (Life Technologies) and 5% heat-inactivated 
horse serum (Life Technologies, 26050070). Slices were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal 
microscope. Approval for rodent experiments was obtained from the Stanford University’s 
Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC).
Electroporation of mouse slices
Coronal slices of mouse embryonic forebrain at E14 were prepared as described above. 
Sections were transferred into tissue culture dishes containing complete HBSS for ~1 hour, 
after which CAG-Cav1.2 (WT– or TS–CACNA1C) plasmids were focally co-injected with 
CAG::GFP at a ratio of 1:0.5 directly into the ganglionic eminence through a glass 
micropipette. Cav1.2 overexpression constructs were generated by insertion of PCR-
amplified WT– and TS–Cav1.2 coding sequences from dihydropyridine-insensitive Cav1.2 
constructs39 into pCAGIG (kind gift from C. Cepko through Addgene, plasmid 11159)46. 
Slices were then electroporated using two horizontally oriented platinum electrodes powered 
by a BTX Square Pulse Electroporator, and placed onto cell culture membrane inserts for 
subsequent live imaging 48 hrs later as described below.
Human Tissue
Human tissue was obtained under a protocol approved by the Research Compliance Office at 
Stanford University. The tissue was processed using an adapted protocol47. Briefly, GW18 
or GW20 frontal brain tissue was embedded in 4% low-melting point agarose in bubbled 
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM

 CaCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM D-(+)-Glucose) and either sectioned 
using a Leica VT1200 Vibratome at 300–500 μm in ice-cold, bubbled ACSF, or cut using the 
sharp end of a gauge–22 needle to obtain 1–2 mm thick sections. The sections were then 
placed in tissue culture plates containing culture media (66% BME, 25% Hanks, 5% FBS, 
1% N-2, 1% penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine; all from Invitrogen) and 0.66% D-(+)-
Glucose (Sigma) and incubated (37°C, 5% CO2) with the Dlxi1/2b::eGFP lentivirus for 30 
min to 1 hr. Sections were then transferred to cell culture membrane inserts (diameter, 13 
mm; pore size, 8 μm; Costar) and incubated in culture media at 37°C, 8% O2, 5% CO2 for 
up to 8 days. Half media changes were performed every other day. After ~5 days in culture, 
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells could be detected and were subsequently imaged as described below.
Live imaging and analysis of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cell migration
The migration of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells was imaged for 8–12 hrs under environmentally 
controlled conditions (37°C, 5% CO2) in intact, fused hSS-hCS using a confocal microscope 
with a motorized stage (Leica SP8). Fused hSS-hCS were transferred to a well of a 96–well 
plate (glass-bottom plates, Corning) in 200 μl of NM. Spheroids were incubated in an 
environmentally controlled chamber for 30–60 min prior to imaging. During a given 
recording session, up to 8 fused hSS-hCS were imaged at a depth of 50–150 μm and at a rate 
of 15–20 min/frame. For pharmacological manipulation, cells were imaged for 12 hrs to 
record a baseline. Then, the media was carefully removed and new media with small 
molecules (AMD3100 at 100 nM; nimodipine at 5 μM; or roscovitine at 15 μM) was gently 
added to the well. The field of view was readjusted to capture the previous region of interest 
and cells in fused hSS-hCS were imaged for an additional 12 hrs.
For imaging of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells, E17–E18 slices were placed on inserts and infected 
with Dlxi1/2b::eGFP lentivirus after 24 hrs. The slices were imaged 2 days later using a 
Leica SP8 confocal microscope (see above).
For measuring the branch to soma length ratio of human cells on mouse slices, hSSs infected 
with Dlxi1/2b::eGFP lentivirus were dissociated and placed on top of E13–14 mouse slices, 
which were placed on cell culture inserts 8–24 hrs before. The hSS-derived Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ 
cells were imaged with the Leica SP8 confocal microscope system at least 48 hrs later.
The migration of mouse Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells or Cav1.2–electroporated cells and the 
migration of human fetal Dlxi1/2b::eGFP–infected cells were both imaged with the same 
setting described for intact, fused hSS-hCS. Slices were kept on the cell culture inserts 
during imaging.
For quantification of migration of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells after plating on coverslips, intact 
hSS were plated on Poly-ornithine/laminin (Sigma) coated glass coverslips (15 mm; 
Werner). Cells were imaged 7–10 days after using a confocal microscope (Leica SP8) as 
described above.
ImageJ and the Chemotaxis & Migration Tool (Ibidi) were used for the post-acquisition 
analysis of cell mobility. The StackReg plugin in ImageJ was used to correct for minor drifts 
during imaging. To estimate the length of individual saltations, Dlxi1/2b::eGFP cells

 displaying a swelling of the soma were identified, and distance (in μm) to the new position 
of the soma following nucleokinesis was recorded manually. The time necessary for this 
movement was used to calculate the speed when mobile. To estimate directness of 
movement, the x and y coordinates of each cell per frame and time were extracted with the 
Manual Tracking plugin (ImageJ) and the Chemotaxis & Migration Tool (Ibidi) was used to 
calculate the Accumulated (A) and Euclidian (E) distances traveled per cell over time. Path 
directness was calculated as the E/A ratio. Videos were processed using ImageJ and Final 
Cut Pro X.
Fura-2 calcium imaging of hSS or hCS cultures
Dissociated hSS (day 62) or hCS (day 123) derived from control and TS lines were cultured 
on poly-L-ornithine and laminin (Sigma) coated coverslips for 4–5 days. The cultures were 
incubated with 1 μM Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2AM; Invitrogen) for 25 min at 37°C 
in NM medium, washed for 5 min and placed in a perfusion chamber on the stage of an 
inverted fluorescence microscope (TE2000U; Nikon). Cells were then stimulated with high-
KCl Tyrode’s solution (67 mM KCl, 67 mM NaCl2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 30 mM 
glucose and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Imaging was performed at room temperature (25°C) 
on an epifluorescence microscope equipped with an excitation filter wheel and an automated 
stage. Openlab software (PerkinElmer) was used to collect and quantify time-lapse 
excitation ratio images. Fluorescence images were analyzed using the IGOR Pro software 
(WaveMetrics). Residual calcium following high-KCl depolarization was calculated by 
dividing the plateau calcium level by the peak calcium elevation ((C – A)/(B – A); Fig. 3b).
Fluo-4 calcium imaging in intact hSS
Intact hSS at day 43–52 were incubated with 10 μM Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-4AM; 
Invitrogen) for 30 min in NM media followed by a 15 min wash with NM. A Leica SP8 
confocal microscope with a resonant scanner was used for imaging. Spontaneous calcium 
activity was recorded for 10 min (one frame every 8–10 s) in one 10 μm z-stack plane. 
Fluorescence intensity (F) was exported as mean gray values in ImageJ. Signal decay was 
controlled by subtracting the mean fluorescence of the background (Fb). To estimate changes 
in intracellular calcium, ΔF was computed as (Fcell– Fb)/F0, where F0 represents the 
minimum F value per cell across the whole 10 min of recording from which Fb was 
subtracted. A ΔF >1.2 was defined as a spike.
iDISCO
To optically clear fixed fused spheroids, we adapted the iDISCO protocol described by 
Renier et al48. Briefly, after fixation with 4% PFA for 3 hrs, spheroids were dehydrated with 
a day-long methanol (MetOH) dilution series (20% to 100% MetOH). Next, they were 
incubated in 5% H2O2 overnight at 4°C. The following day, they were rehydrated with a 
reverse MetOH dilution series and incubated overnight in 0.2% Triton-X, 20% DMSO, 0.3 
M Glycine/PBS at 37°C. The spheroids were then blocked with 0.2% Triton-X, 10% 
DMSO, 6% goat serum/PBS at 37°C for 2 days, followed by a heparin treatment for 2 hrs 
(PTwH: 0.2% Tween-20, 10 μg/mL Heparin/PBS) to reduce non-specific antibody binding. 
They were next incubated with a chicken anti–GFP (1:1500; GeneTex: GTX13970) antibody 
for 2 days in PTwH with 5% DMSO and 3% goat serum at 37°C. After a day-long wash

 series with PTwH, a secondary antibody diluted in PTwH, 3% goat serum was added for an 
additional two days at 37°C. After 2 days of PTwH washes, the spheroids were cleared by a 
three-step tetrahydrofuran (THF) series (80%, 100%, 100% THF/H2O), a 10 min 
dichloromethane step, and a short incubation in dichloromethane (DBE). The cleared 
spheroids were stored and imaged in DBE on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit and RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen), and 
template cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using the SuperScript III First-Strand 
Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Life Technologies). Real time qPCR was performed 
using SYBR GREEN (Roche) on a ViiA7 machine (Applied Biosystems, Life 
Technologies). Data was processed using the QuantStudio RT-PCR software (Applied 
Biosystems). Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Single cell gene expression (BD Resolve system)
To capture transcriptomic information of hiPSCs-derived hCS and hSS (IS) single-cells, we 
used the BD Resolve system (BD Genomics, Menlo Park, CA) as previously reported with 
modifications13. Multiple hCS or hSS at day 105 of differentiation were combined and 
dissociated enzymatically into single cells, and processed in one batch. Single cell capture 
was achieved by random distribution of a single cell suspension across >200,000 microwells 
via a limited dilution approach. Beads with oligonucleotide barcodes were added to 
saturation such that a bead was paired with a cell in a microwell. Cell lysis buffer was added 
such that poly-adenylated RNA molecules hybridize to the beads. Beads were collected into 
a single tube for reverse transcription. Upon cDNA synthesis, each cDNA molecule was 
tagged on the 5′ end (i.e., 3′ end of mRNA transcript) with a molecular index and cell label 
indicating its cell of origin. Whole transcriptome libraries were prepared using the BD 
Resolve single cell whole transcriptome amplification workflow. Briefly, second strand 
cDNA was synthesized, followed by ligation of adaptor for universal amplification. Eighteen 
cycles of PCR were used to amplify the adaptor ligated cDNA products. Sequencing 
libraries were prepared using random priming PCR of the whole transcriptome amplification 
products to enrich the 3′ end of the transcripts linked with the cell label and molecular 
indices.
Sequencing libraries were quantified using a High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent) on a 
Bioanalyzer 2100 and the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
1.5 pM of the library for each sample was loaded onto a NextSeq 500 system and sequenced 
using High Output sequencing kits (75 × 2bp) (Illumina).
The BD Resolve analysis pipeline was used to process sequencing data (fastq files). Cell 
labels and molecular indices were identified, and gene identity was determined by alignment 
against the gencode comprehensive hg19 reference. A table containing molecule counts per 
gene per cell was output. 7,663 and 4,983 cells were identified for hCS and hSS, 
respectively, with an average number of reads of ~14,800, an average of ~3,710 molecules 
and ~1,700 number genes detected per cell with an average molecular index coverage (i.e. 
number of times a molecule was sequenced) of ~2. A total of 34,242 genes were detected

 across all cells. Cells with mitochondrial gene (with gene symbol starting with MT) content 
> 25%, were discarded retaining 7,126 and 4,712 cells for hCS and hSS (IS), respectively. 
Pseudogenes were removed. The distribution of reads per single cell is shown in Extended 
Data Fig. 2m. For visualization and clustering, the data tables of the two libraries were 
concatenated, and the combined table was further reduced to retain only the most variable 
genes using the method outlined in Macosko et al49, yielding 1,102 genes. t–SNE projection 
of the data was performed using default parameters14. To determine the set of genes 
contributing to the separation of cell clusters, differential gene expression analysis (DEseq) 
based on negative binomial distribution50 was conducted to compare gene expression 
profiles in cells in each cluster versus those in the rest of the data set. Genes were ranked by 
smallest P values (expressed in terms of –log10) and the list of significantly over-represented 
genes with –log10 (P-value) < 10 of each cluster is provided as Supplementary Table 3. 
Patterns of expression for the top 25 genes in each cluster are shown in Extended Data Fig. 
2e–l). A very small group of hCS-derived cells clustered with the GABAergic interneuron 
subdomain, and differential gene expression indicated that these cells expressed TBR1, 
RELN, PAX6 and CALB2.
Single cell RNA-seq (Smart-seq2)
For assessing gene expression in Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells in hSS and in hCS of fused hSS-
hCS, we used a single-cell RNA-Seq assay adapted from the Smart-seq-2 protocol reported 
by Picelli et al51. In short, hSS and hCS that had been fused for ~15 days were separated 
with a scalpel blade and dissociated independently as described. Single-cells were isolated 
by FACS into a 96-well PCR plate containing 5 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.04% Triton 
X-100 (10%, Sigma BioUltra), 0.1 μl recombinant RNase inhibitor (TaKaRa), 1 μl Oligo-
dT30VN (10 μM), 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix (Fermentas) and nuclease-free H20 for a final 
volume of 5 μl. A known number of internal RNA control (ERCC) was added to the lysis 
master mix to estimate the technical variability between the wells of the same plate and 
between plates. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification were performed using the 
parameters described by Picelli et al51. The quality of the cDNA library was checked using a 
High-Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Bioanalyzer). Libraries were prepared using the 
Nextera XT library prep kit (96 index primers, Illumina). Because the Nextera XT kit is very 
sensitive to the concentration of cDNA, we screened pre-amplified cDNA libraries from all 
plates using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit and used 125 pg cDNA from each positive well 
to further process the tagmentation and indexing. Twelve additional PCR cycles were 
performed to further enrich for pre-amplified tagmented DNA. The quality of the tagmented 
library was checked using the High-Sensitivity Bioanalyzer chip. The final pooled library 
was diluted to 2 nM using the elution buffer (Qiagen), and 10 pM was loaded on an Illumina 
HiSeq 2500 instrument for sequencing. Libraries were sequenced to obtain 50 bp single end 
reads (TruSeq Rapid kit, Illumina) with 8 additional cycles for indexing. On average, we 
obtained 2 million pass filter reads per single cell (Extended Data Fig. 6c). We considered a 
gene expressed if there were at least 10 reads detected for that gene. Cells that expressed 
more than 1,000 genes and <10% mitochondrial RNAs were kept for analysis. To avoid bias 
during FACS from RNA contamination from the glutamatergic neurons on the hCS side of 
the fused hSS-hCS, we analyzed STMN2+ cells that did not express SLC17A6 or SLC17A7. 
To control for technical noise, we used a quantitative statistical analysis52 to detect

 biological variable genes and used them for further analysis. To cluster and visualize the 
cells, we used the t-SNE method in the computational software package Seurat53.
Array tomography (AT)
AT was used to collect high-resolution images of synapses within neural spheroids using 
previously published protocols11,54. Briefly, fused hSS-hCS were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline. To preserve GFP fluorescence, the tissue 
was dehydrated with up to 70% alcohol only, with processing through 50% ethanol, 70% 
ethanol, 1:3 70% ethanol:LR White Resin (LRW, medium grade, SPI supplies), and LRW 
overnight before embedding in LRW. The embedded tissue was sectioned into ribbons of 70 
nm thick sections (~30 sections/ribbon) and each ribbon was immunostained in 2–3 rounds 
of staining with the antibodies eluted after each round. The following primary antibodies 
were used for immunostaining: anti–GFP (chicken, 1:200; Genetex: 13970, 1:200), anti–
SYN1 (rabbit, Cell Signalling: 5297S, 1:500), anti–PSD95 (rabbit, Cell Signalling: 3450S), 
anti–VGUT1 (guinea pig, 1:5000; Millipore: AB5905), anti–Gephyrin (mouse, 1:100; BD 
Biosciences: 612632), anti–VGAT (guinea pig, 1:200; Synaptic Systems 131004), anti–
VGAT (mouse, 1:200; Synaptic Systems: 131011), anti–GFAP (chicken, 1:300; Aves), anti–
MAP2 (guinea pig, 1:1000; Synaptic Systems: 188004). Sections were visualized on a Zeiss 
Axio Imager.Z1 upright fluorescence microscope using AxioVision software (rel 4.7, Zeiss). 
Images were processed and registered using FIJI/ImageJ with standard and custom plugins 
(code.google.com/p/smithlabsoftware). FIJI/ImageJ was used for volume reconstruction.
Electrophysiology
Sections of hCS, hSS (day 96–141) or fused hSS-hCS (29–53 daf) for physiological 
recordings were obtained using an approach we previously described11. Briefly, spheroids 
were incubated in bicarbonate buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 23°C and 
equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The aCSF solution contained: 126 mM 
NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 
and 2 mM CaCl2. Slicing was performed using a Leica VT1200 vibratome. Immediately 
after sectioning, slices were moved to a circulation chamber containing oxygenated aCSF at 
32°C. For patch-clamp recording, cells were identified by the presence of a fluorescent 
reporter using an upright Axoscop II microscope (Zeiss). Recording electrodes of 
borosilicate glass had a resistance of 4–6 MΩ when filled with internal solution. A low Cl− 
internal solution was used to distinguish between EPSCs and IPSCs containing: 145 mM K+ 
gluconate, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4 mM Na+ 
phosphocreatine. Cl− reversal was calculated to be at −91 mV according to the Nernst 
equation. A high Cl− internal solution was used to measure EPSCs in a subset of unfused 
hSS containing: 135 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM 
GTP. The Cl− reversal potential was calculated to be 0 mV according to the Nernst equation. 
IPSCs were blocked by application of the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (10 μM, 
Abcam), which was added to superfused aCSF. EPSCs were blocked by application of the 
glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM, Abcam), which was added to 
superfused aCSF. Electrical simulation was delivered using a bipolar tungsten electrode 
(FHS) placed 200–400 μM away from a recorded neuron. Stimulations were delivered to 
slices for 0.1 ms at 300 μV and separated by at least 10 s. Inward EPSCs and outward IPSPs

 were recorded by filling the patch pipette with a low chloride internal solution (ECl–= −90 
mV) and holding the cell at −40 mV, which is near the midpoint between ECl– and EK+/Na+. 
Notably, the average shape of sIPSCs recorded in hSS displayed a prolonged decay as 
compared to the average EPSCs recorded from hCS, as is commonly observed in cortical 
neurons55 (Extended Data Fig. 4b).
Data were collected using a 1550A digitizer (Molecular Devices), a 700B patch-clamp 
amplifier (Molecular Devices) and acquired with the pClamp 10.6 software (Molecular 
Devices). Recordings were filtered at 10 kHz. Synaptic recordings were analyzed using 
custom software developed by J.R.H. (Wdetecta). Action potentials were analyzed using 
custom MATLAB (MathWorks) programs. IPSCs and EPSCs were detected based on their 
direction and shape. We calculated the first time derivative of the current recording and set a 
detection threshold that was above the noise for each trace. Detected responses were then 
evaluated to confirm the detection accuracy.
Statistics
Data are presented as mean ±  s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated. Distribution of the raw data 
was tested for normality of distribution; statistical analyses were performed using the 
Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, χ2-test, or ANOVA with posthoc tests as indicated. 
Sample sizes were estimated empirically or based on power calculations. Blinding was used 
for all analyses comparing patients and control samples.
