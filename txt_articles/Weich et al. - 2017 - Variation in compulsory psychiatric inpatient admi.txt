Abstract: Background  
The increasing rate of compulsory admission to psychiatric in-patient 
beds in England is concerning.  Studying variation between places and 
services could be key to identifying targets for interventions to reverse 
this.  We modelled spatial variation in compulsory admissions in England 
using national patient-level data, and quantified the extent to which 
patient, local area and service setting characteristics accounted for 
this variation.  
 
Methods 
Cross-sectional, multilevel analysis of the 2010/11 Mental Health Minimum 
Data Set (MHMDS).  Data were available for 1,238,188 patients, covering 
64 NHS Provider Trusts (93%) and 31,865 Census Lower Super Output Areas 
(LSOAs) (98%).  Primary outcome was compulsory admission to a mental 
illness bed, compared with people admitted voluntarily or receiving only 
community-based care.   
 
Outcomes 
7∙5% and 5∙6% of the variance in compulsory admission occurred at LSOA- 
and Provider Trust-levels, respectively, after adjusting for patient 
characteristics.  Black patients were almost three times more likely to 
be admitted compulsorily than White patients (OR 2∙94, 95% CI 2∙90-2∙98). 
Compulsory admission was greater in more deprived areas (OR 1∙22, 95% CI 
1∙18-1∙27) and in areas with more non-white residents (OR 1∙51, 95% CI 
1∙43-1∙59), after adjusting for confounders. 
 
Interpretation 
Compulsory psychiatric in-patient admission varies significantly between 
local areas and services, independent of patient, area and service 
characteristics.  Compulsory admission rates appear to reflect local 
 factors, especially socio-economic and ethnic population composition.  
Understanding how these condition access to and use of mental health care 
is likely to be important for developing interventions to reduce 
compulsion.

Abstract (258 words; 243 words excluding funding statement) 
Background  
The increasing rate of compulsory admission to psychiatric in-patient beds in England is 
concerning.  Studying variation between places and services could be key to identifying 
targets for interventions to reverse this.  We modelled spatial variation in compulsory 
admissions in England using national patient-level data, and quantified the extent to which 
patient, local area and service setting characteristics accounted for this variation.  
Methods 
Cross-sectional, multilevel analysis of the 2010/11 Mental Health Minimum Data Set 
(MHMDS).  Data were available for 1,238,188 patients, covering 64 NHS Provider Trusts (93%) 
and 31,865 Census Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) (98%).  Primary outcome was 
compulsory admission to a mental illness bed, compared with people admitted voluntarily or 
receiving only community-based care.   
Outcomes 
7�5% and 5�6% of the variance in compulsory admission occurred at LSOA- and Provider Trust-
levels, respectively, after adjusting for patient characteristics.  Black patients were almost 
three times more likely to be admitted compulsorily than White patients (OR 2�94, 95% CI 
2�90-2�98). Compulsory admission was greater in more deprived areas (OR 1�22, 95% CI 1�18-
1�27) and in areas with more non-white residents (OR 1�51, 95% CI 1�43-1�59), after adjusting 
for confounders. 
Interpretation 
Compulsory psychiatric in-patient admission varies significantly between local areas and 
services, independent of patient, area and service characteristics.  Compulsory admission 
rates appear to reflect local factors, especially socio-economic and ethnic population

composition.  Understanding how these condition access to and use of mental health care is 
likely to be important for developing interventions to reduce compulsion.

Introduction 
Many European countries have witnessed increased rates of compulsory admissions to 
psychiatric in-patient beds in recent decades.1  In England, the total number of such 
admissions (excluding short-term assessment orders) exceeded 63,000 in 2015/16, a 9% 
increase on the previous year and an increase of around 43% since the introduction of the 
2007 Mental Health Act (MHA).2  This is concerning to service users, clinicians, regulators and 
policy makers,3-5 particularly since compulsory treatment is stigmatising and may hamper 
engagement with services.6  Explanations for greater use of compulsion have been suggested, 
including increased use of illicit drugs and alcohol, secular changes in support networks,7,8 
fewer psychiatric beds and failure to provide alternatives.9,10 .  Attempts to reduce 
compulsory treatment  through advance directives and enhanced crisis care plans have had 
only modest effects,11 highlighting the need for further intervention strategies.  
 
Compulsory admission rates vary between places, 9 and this may hold clues to causes of 
upward national trends.  Investment in mental health services, bed capacity and provision of 
community-based alternatives vary between places,12 as do patients and the communities in 
which they live.13  Elucidating the effects of service setting factors and local area 
characteristics across large and representative samples, and differentiating these from 
variation due to differences between patients, may represent the best way to identify 
intervention targets.  Our aims were to describe and model spatial variation in compulsory 
admissions in England using national patient-level data, and to quantify the extent to which 
adjusting for patient, local area and service setting characteristics accounted for this 
variation.

Methods 
Data source and study sample 
Compulsory admissions in England are recorded in the Mental Health Minimum Dataset 
(MHMDS),14 a mandatory administrative dataset. Individual patient records in the MHMDS 
include spatial/service setting identifiers (Table 1) allowing linkage to external data sources.  
We used data for 2010-2011. 
 
<< Table 1 about here >> 
 
Following data quality checks, data from 8 Provider Trusts were excluded, including 3 
independent Provider Trusts which lacked spatial identification codes.  Of 5 NHS Provider 
Trusts excluded, one had no in-patient beds and four lacked ���� �� ��������� ����� ������� T�� 
final study sample consisted of 1,238,188 patients who received care from 64 NHS Provider 
Trusts.  Due to data-coding errors and missing data, analytic samples for alternative models 
varied slightly.       
 
Outcomes 
The main outcome was compulsory admission, defined as time spent in an in-patient mental 
illness bed while subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA) (2007).  We excluded patients 
detained under sections of the Act concerned only with conveyance to, and/or assessment in, 
a Place of Safety, or for short-���� ���� ������ ���������� ���� as these do not in themselves 
direct admission to an-patient mental health bed.  Likewise, we excluded sections of the Act 
relating to guardianship or supervisedcommunity treatment.  Patients detained under short-
term assessment sections and subsequently admitted compulsorily to a mental health bed 
were included in the compulsory admission group; those discharged from short-term 
 7 
 
assessment orders or who were admitted voluntarily were not.  Patients excluded from the 
compulsory admission group were included in the unexposed group, which comprised those 
treated as voluntary inpatients and/or in the community.  Around 95% of those admitted 
compulsorily were detained under MHA Sections 2 and 3. This group also included those 
subject to Sections 4, 35, 36, 37, 38, 47 and 48. 
 
No single variable in the MHMDS described the study outcome.  Rather, it was derived from 
several variables, including admissions and discharges, bed days, receipt of community 
treatment, and legal detention status.15 We were able to identify whether a patient had been 
admitted compulsorily and the highest level of legal restriction (according to the MHA (2007)) 
in the reporting period, but not the number or duration of episodes.  Therefore, each patient 
could only be counted once regardless of number of compulsory admissions in the study year.  
 
The unexposed group therefore comprised all patients who received any type of care other 
than compulsory admission.  Cross-tabulating MHMDS data on community treatment (e.g. 
number of contacts with professionals) with admission data enabled us to identify patients 
who received only community care.  
 
Exposures 
MHMDS contained reasonably complete data (% missing) on a limited number of patient 
characteristics, namely age (<0�01%), sex (0�03%) and ethnicity (9�6%).   Several patient-level 
variables could not be included in our analysis due to high levels of missing data: marital 
status (15%); accommodation status (64%), employment status (75%) and diagnosis (81%).  
 
MHMDS spatial identifiers were used to link patient records to external data sources that 
 8 
 
included variables characterising local areas and mental health services that were potentially 
associated with mental health outcomes (Table 4).  Data sources and measures used to derive 
variables at LSOA-level and Provider Trust-level are shown as supplementary material. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Multilevel models (MM) were applied using MLwIN 16 to estimate variation in compulsory 
admission , starting with null (unconditional) models which partitioned total variance in 
compulsory admission between each level in the model.  Five discrete levels were identified 
in the MHMDS, in addition to patients (Table 1), although computational limitations meant 
that not all could be included in a single model. Moreover, these levels did not nest neatly 
within each other, necessitating use of cross-classified multilevel models (CCMMs) and 
increasing computational complexity.17 Patients were nested within LSOAs but SOAs were not 
nested neatly within Provider Trusts, i.e. patients within any one LSOA could be treated in 
different Trusts.  Such cross-classification results in a data structure that, in effect, increases 
the number of units at the LSOA level.  In the examples shown in figure 1, LSOA 2 is 
represented twice because patients attend Hospital A and Hospital B.   
 
We aimed to specify and estimate the most detailed models possible.  Preliminary work 
suggested that null models with more than four levels, and conditional models with more 
than three levels, were unstable (ie failed to converge with acceptable MCMC diagnostics); 
moreover, there was limited variance in compulsory admission at Strategic Health Authority 
(SHA)-level.  We therefore present findings from competing four-level null models, the results 
of which informed selection of a preferred three-level model.  Finally, multivariate models 
were used to determine how much of the total variance was explained by patient-level 
 9 
 
explanatory variables only, and then by explanatory variables at individual, local area- and 
service setting levels.  
 
Since the outcome was binary, multilevel logistic regression was used.  Following convention, 
we assumed the binary outcome was defined by a continuous latent variable and patient-
����� �������� ��� ������������ �� ��� �������� �������� �� �2/3=3�29.18  In this way, variances 
at each level could be summed, allowing the proportion of (unexplained) variation, the 
Variance Partition Coefficient (VPC), to be calculated at each level.  As this method only 
provides an approximate measure of the VPC in models with binary responses, we also 
calculated Median Odds Ratios (MORs) for our final models.19  If the MOR is equal to 1, there 
is no variation between higher-level settings; large (and statistically significant) MORs indicate 
substantial higher-level variation. 
 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian methods were used to estimate all models.20 All 
null models were estimated twice, using all available data (n=1,149,541 to 1,207,916) and 
then only complete cases (n=1,149,541).  MCMC diagnostics were used to determine the 
number of iterations in each model. We examined the estimate trace, the plot of the 
posterior distribution and the autocorrelation function.  The number of chains was evaluated 
using Raftery-Lewis and Brooks-Draper prospective diagnostics.20 We used the Bayesian 
Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) statistic to compare the fit of alternative MMs.21 Models 
with lower DIC values suggest a better, more parsimonious model; a difference of 10 or more 
is considered substantial. DIC values are only comparable across models with the same 
observed data and hence were estimated using only complete cases. 
To estimate variance explained by patient, local area and service setting characteristics, we 
used the pseudo R-squared approach outlined by Snijders and Bosker18 (p306).  Variance 
 10 
 
explained at, for example, patient-level was estimated as the proportion of total variance 
attributable to the fixed part of a model that included patient-level explanatory variables, 
divided by the total variance.  Total variance is equal to the sum of the variances of the fixed 
part of the model and (unexplained) variances at each higher level.  
 
The statistical significance of fixed-part estimates were tested by deriving Z ratios and 
comparing these against a normal distribution.  Odds ratios (95% credible intervals, CI) are 
reported to show their size.  We do not report p values, in keeping with standard practice for 
reporting Bayesian model results..  MORs are directly comparable to these fixed-part odds 
ratios.   Patients were only excluded from analyses where data were missing.

<< Table 2 about here >> 
 
Null (unconditional) models 
Table 3 shows alternative null models with four levels.  Overall, between 75�1% and 84�5% of 
the variance in compulsory admission to hospital was at patient-level; between 6�4% and 
6�7% was at LSOA-level; between 5�6% and 7�2% was at PCT-level; between 1�9% and 2�7% 
was at GP-level; and between 6�9% and 12�3% was at Provider Trust-level.   
 
Inclusion of PCTs and Provider Trusts in the same model resulted in reduction in patient-level 
variance and commensurate increase in variance between Provider Trusts (from about 7% to 
 11 
 
about 12%).  On further investigation we found that in one-third of Provider Trusts, over 80% 
of patients originated from a single PCT.  It is likely, therefore, that reduced variance at 
patient level in models 3 and 4 is due to conflation of patient- and higher-level variance 
caused by clustering of patients within a small number of PCTs per Trust, a problem 
exacerbated by cross-classification in the data.16,22 We therefore considered that estimates of 
higher-level variance in Models 1 and 2 were more reliable than those of Models 3 and 4.  
Model comparisons using DIC statistic revealed that Models 2 and 3 were superior to Models 
1 and 4, with Model 3 fitting slightly better than Model 2.  These results indicated that the 
most appropriate CCMM comprised patients, LSOAs, GP Practices and Provider Trusts.  
 
<< Table 3 about here >> 
 
Multivariate models  
The computationally complex four-level multivariate CCMM produced an unstable solution in 
terms of MCMC diagnostics.   We therefore selected the most important spatial levels for 
inclusion in more complex models.  We did this on the basis of our null models (Table 3, 
Model 2), and following the a priori view that patients and Provider Trusts were essential to 
any model: the former was the level at which most variation occurred and the latter 
represented the locus at which compulsory admission decisions are made.  We therefore 
included patient, LSOA and Provider Trust as the three levels in multivariate models. 
   
Table 4 shows the results of patient-LSOA-Provider Trust CCMMs, with and without 
covariates.  The null model was based on an MCMC model with burn-in of 500 and 
Monitoring Chain Length of 50,000.  The model with covariates was run for 100,000  
iterations; MCMC diagnostics indicated that burn-in and chain length were sufficiently large.  
 12 
 
The null model shows that while the majority of the variance in compulsory admission 
occurred at patient-level, 8�3% and 7�0% occurred at LSOA- and Provider Trust-levels, 
respectively.  We estimated that patient-level covariates explained 8�0% of the total variance 
in risk of being compulsorily admitted.  Covariates at LSOA- and Provider Trust-levels were 
estimated as explaining only a further 2�2% of this variance, 1�1% at each of the higher levels.  
In total, therefore, just over 10% of the total variance in compulsory admission was explained 
by covariates. 
 
Given the limited explanatory power of covariates, the percentage share of the remaining 
(unexplained) variance at higher-levels did not change substantially once these were included 
in the model.  Following inclusion of patient-level covariates, variance fell to 7�5% and 5�6% 
for LSOAs and Provider Trusts, respectively.  After further inclusion of LSOA- and Provider 
Trust-level covariates, this remained unchanged at 7�5% at LSOA-level and fell slightly to 5�2% 
at Provider Trust-level.  
 
<< Table 4 about here >> 
 
At patient level, after adjusting for all covariates, men had a higher probability of being 
compulsorily admitted to hospital than women (OR 1�29, 95% CI 1�27- 1�31).  Patients who 
were 18 years old or younger were least likely to be admitted compulsorily; compared with 
this group, the risk of compulsory admission was greatest among those aged 18�35 years (OR 
1�92, 95% CI 1�82-2�02) and fell with age, but remained statistically significant even in the 
oldest age group (65 years and older) (OR 1�12, 95% CI 1�02-1�22).  The largest associations 
with compulsory admission at patient-level were observed for ethnicity, with Black patients 
 13 
 
having the highest rate of compulsory admission compared to the White reference group (OR 
2�94, 95% CI 2�90-2�98).  Patients of Asian and mixed ethnicity were also significantly more 
likely to have been admitted compulsorily (Table 4). 
 
At LSOA level, compulsory admission was associated with socio-economic deprivation in a 
manner which suggested a dose-response effect.  Odds ratios for compulsory admission rose 
steadily by deprivation quintile, to a peak of 1�22 (95% CI 1�18 to 1�27) among those living in 
LSOAs with deprivation scores in the top quintile (most deprived) compared to those living in 
the least deprived areas.  The association between compulsory admission and ethnic density 
was also statistically significant and also appeared to show a dose-response effect, with 
patients living in LSOAs with the most non-white residents having much higher risks of being 
admitted compulsorily (OR 1�51, 95% CI 1�43-1�59).  No statistically significant association was 
found between compulsory admission and LSOA population density (Table 4). 
 
At Provider Trust level, no statistically significant associations were found between 
compulsory admission and bed numbers, length of stay, in-patient services performance, 
Patient Environment and Action Team (PEAT) scores, staff satisfaction or annual number of 
admissions.  Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of 
compulsory admission between London Trusts and those outside the capital.  Only one 
Provider Trust-level covariate was significantly associated with greater compulsory admission: 
patients receiving care from a Trust whose community mental health services were rated

The limited power of LSOA, Provider-Trust and patient characteristics in explaining spatial 
variation in compulsory admission is confirmed by the MORs for LSOAs and Provider Trusts 
(Table 4).  After adjusting for all covariates , these were greater than 1 and larger than the 
ORs for many patient characteristics and all LSOA- and Provider Trust-level characteristics, at

Discussion 
Main findings 
We found statistically significant variance at both local area- and service setting-level in 
compulsory admission in England, independent of patient characteristics.  Although most 
variance in compulsory admission was observed between patients, almost 13% occurred 
between local areas (LSOAs) and service settings (NHS Provider Trusts), after adjusting for 
patient characteristics.  Slightly more variance was observed between local areas than 
between Provider Trusts.  
 
Most variance in compulsory admission remained unexplained, even after adjusting for a 
large number of patient, local-area and service-setting characteristics.  We estimated that 
these covariates explained only around 10% of the total variance in compulsory admission.  
Most of the explained variance was accounted for by patient-level characteristics; area- and 
Provider Trust-level characteristics accounted for only just over 2% of total variance in 
multivariate models.  Mean odds ratios (MORs) confirmed the significance of this unexplained 
higher-level variance in compulsory admission between LSOAs and between Provider Trusts. 
 
The non-significance of most Provider Trust-level variables, including measures relating to bed 
capacity was notable.  H������� T����� ���� ��������� �������� ����� ����� ��������� ����� 
 15 
 
other Trusts were almost twice as likely to admit patients compulsorily, suggesting that better 
community mental health services may be associated with increased risk of compulsory 
admission, perhaps due to greater awareness of treatment needs.  This phenomenon has 
been observed previously, for Assertive Outreach and Crisis Resolution services.23,24  
 
We found statistically significant associations at patient and local-area levels.  Black patients 
were almost three times more likely to be admitted compulsorily than White patients, in 
keeping with evidence from elsewhere,25 after adjusting for area- and Provider Trust-level 
characteristics.  Compulsory admission was significantly associated with local-area 
deprivation and the proportion of non-white residents (in LSOAs), after adjusting for other 
covariates including individual ethnicity. 
 
Strengths and limitations 
This was the largest and most complete study of its kind and the national representativeness 
of the sample, deriving from routine clinical activity, was a major strength.  The complex data 
structure reflects the real world settings in which patients live and use mental health services.  
Multilevel models provided a means to examine this complexity.  The availability of patient-
level data and the ability to link this to area-level variables were strengths.  
 
Routine administrative data sources like MHMDS have limitations.  Data were not available to 
allow us to ascertain the number and duration of compulsory admission episodes.  
Consequently, we modelled the likelihood that a patient was compulsorily admitted at some 
point during the study period.  This precluded us from exploring re-���������� ��� ���������� 
����� �������� ��� ��� ������������ ���y make to compulsory admission rates.  
 
 16 
 
We were limited in the patient, local area- and Trust-level variables that were available and 
residual confounding was likely.  The most significant omission was information about 
��������� ���������, socio-economic status and clinical status.26  Previous studies have found 
modest and contrasting associations between individual-level socio-economic status and the 
incidence of psychotic disorders.27 We used total number of mental illness beds as we could 
not distinguish between bed types.  The capping of official bed occupancy statistics at 100% 
may also have biased our findings towards the null and reduced estimates of explained 
variance.28 Finally, s this was a cross-sectional study, we could not investigate factors 
associated with changes in compulsory admission rates. 
 
Interpretation of our findings 
Our findings, based on the first-ever analysis of complete national data, indicate significant 
(and substantial) variation in compulsory admission at both local area- and Provider Trust-
levels.  Despite adjusting for a large number of potential confounders, covariates explained 
only a limited amount of variation.  The most likely explanation was the absence of 
information on key variables, including diagnosis and illness severity, previous history of 
admission and/or compulsion, engagement with services, isolation, and drug and alcohol use 
(individual); availability of adequate housing, social care and other support services (area); 
and bed pressures, crisis intervention response times and local service configuration and 
quality (Provider Trust).  
 
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that compulsory admission rates are not uniform, and may 
reflect local factors, such as the challenges of delivering home-based crisis care in areas with 
high levels of socio-economic deprivation.  Further research is needed to elucidate factors 
that account for spatial variation in compulsory admission, and to understand the ways in 
 17 
 
which factors such as area-level deprivation and ethnic density condition access to and 
delivery of mental health care.  And whereas previous interventions to reduce compulsory 
admission have focused on the individual (patient) level, such as Community Treatment 
Orders and enhanced care plans, 11 our findings suggest that interventions will need to 
operate at more than one spatial level to be effective. 29

Panel: Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Although several studies have been done in the UK and other European countries to examine 
individual, local area and service provider factors associated with spatial variation in the use 
of compulsory admission, few studies have looked at the relative contribution of factors at all 
three levels simultaneously. We searched PubMed for articles published between January 1, 
2000 and December 31st 2016 with the search terms: (compulsory[All Fields] AND 
admission[All Fields]) OR (involuntary[All Fields] AND admission[All Fields]).  Over 730 articles 
 19 
 
were found, 38 of which were of direct relevance to the present study. Much of the previous 
work has consisted of ecological studies. By working at a single aggregate level, these studies 
have been unable to account for the autocorrelation arising from the grouping of patients in 
higher-level settings, be they local areas or service providers. They have also been unable to 
provide an estimate of the relative size of the variation at each of the higher-levels, or the 
contribution of level-specific factors in explaining this variation. This research has also been 
restricted to sub-national samples, either particular regions, cities or hospitals, limiting both 
generalisability and the extent of observed variation. 
 
Added value of this study 
Our findings are based on the first-ever multilevel analysis of nationally representative service 
use data in England, comprising data on over 1.2m patients.  T��� ������� ������� ������� ��� 
occurrence of spatial variation in rates of compulsory psychiatric admission and show that 
this occurs to a substantial and significant degree, and independently, between both local 
areas and mental health service providers.  This amounts to strong evidence of significant 
variation in compulsorily admission between both local areas and services, independent of 
patient characteristics.  Although we found highly significant associations between local area 
socio-economic deprivation and ethnic density, little of the variation between places and 
service providers was explained by the variables characterising local areas, services or 
patients themselves. 
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Compulsory admission rates in England vary between people and places to a significant 
degree.  Understanding how local factors, particularly socio-economic deprivation and ethnic 
 20 
 
density, condition access to and use of mental health services may be key to developing 
interventions and strategies to reduce compulsion.

Abstract (258 words; 243 words excluding funding statement) 
Background  
The increasing rate of compulsory admission to psychiatric in-patient beds in England is 
concerning.  Studying variation between places and services could be key to identifying 
targets for interventions to reverse this.  We modelled spatial variation in compulsory 
admissions in England using national patient-level data, and quantified the extent to which 
patient, local area and service setting characteristics accounted for this variation.  
Methods 
Cross-sectional, multilevel analysis of the 2010/11 Mental Health Minimum Data Set 
(MHMDS).  Data were available for 1,238,188 patients, covering 64 NHS Provider Trusts (93%) 
and 31,865 Census Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) (98%).  Primary outcome was 
compulsory admission to a mental illness bed, compared with people admitted voluntarily or 
receiving only community-based care.   
Outcomes 
7�5% and 5�6% of the variance in compulsory admission occurred at LSOA- and Provider Trust-
levels, respectively, after adjusting for patient characteristics.  Black patients were almost 
three times more likely to be admitted compulsorily than White patients (OR 2�94, 95% CI 
2�90-2�98). Compulsory admission was greater in more deprived areas (OR 1�22, 95% CI 1�18-
1�27) and in areas with more non-white residents (OR 1�51, 95% CI 1�43-1�59), after adjusting 
for confounders. 
Interpretation 
Compulsory psychiatric in-patient admission varies significantly between local areas and 
services, independent of patient, area and service characteristics.  Compulsory admission 
rates appear to reflect local factors, especially socio-economic and ethnic population 
 4 
 
composition.  Understanding how these condition access to and use of mental health care is 
likely to be important for developing interventions to reduce compulsion.  
Funding 
The study was funded by the NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research Programme 
(10/1011/70).

Introduction 
Many European countries have witnessed increased s in rates of compulsory admissions to 
psychiatric in-patient beds in recent decades.1  In England, the total number of such 
admissions (excluding short-term assessment orders) exceeded 6358,000 in 20154/165, a 9% 
increase on the previous year and ann increase of around 4332% since the introduction of the 
2007 Mental Health Act (MHA).2  This is greatly concerning to service users, clinicians, 
regulators and policy makers,3-5 particularly since compulsory treatment is highly stigmatising 
and may hamper engagement with services.6  Several eExplanations for greater use of 
compulsion have been suggested, including increased use of illicit drugs and alcohol, secular 
changes in support networks,7,8 fewer psychiatric beds and failure to provideinvest in 
alternatives.,9,10 although evidence for these remains weak.  Attempts to reduce compulsory 
treatment (predominantly through advance directives and enhanced crisis care plans) have 
had only modest effects,11 highlighting the need for to identify further intervention targets 
and strategies.  
 
Rates of cCompulsory admission rates vary between places, 9 and this variation may well hold 
clues to the causes of upward national trends.  Investment in mental health services, bed 
capacity and provision of community-based alternatives vary between places,12 as do patients 
and the communities in which they live.13  Elucidating the effects of service setting factors and 
local area characteristics across large and representative samples, and differentiating these 
from variation due to individual differences between patients, may represent the best way 
toof identifying targets for intervention targets.  Our The aims of the present study were 
therefore to describe and model spatial variation in compulsory admissions in England using 
national patient-level data, and to quantify the extent to which adjusting for patient, local 
area and service setting characteristics accounted for this variation.

Methods 
Data source and study sample 
Compulsory admissions in England are recorded and made available as part of a mandatory 
administrative dataset, in the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS).,14 a mandatory 
administrative dataset. Individual patient records in the MHMDS include several 
spatial/service setting identifiers (Table 1) allowing linkage to external data sources.  We used 
data for 2010-2011. 
 
<< Table 1 about here >> 
 
Following data quality checks, data from 8 Provider Trusts were excluded, including three3 
independent Provider Trusts which lacked had no spatial identification codes.  Of the 5 NHS 
Provider Trusts excluded, one had no in-patient beds and four lackedhad no ���� �� ��������� 
legal status. The final study sample consisted of 1,238,188 patients who received care from 64 
NHS Provider Trusts.  Due to data-coding errors and missing data on some of the other spatial 
identifiers, the analytic samples for alternative models varied slightly.       
 
Outcomes 
The main study outcome was compulsory admission, defined as time spent in an in-patient 
mental illness bed while subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA) (2007).  We excluded 
patients detained under sections of the Act concerned only with conveyance to, and/or 
assessment in, a Place of Safety, or for short-���� ���� ������ ���������� ���� as these do 
not in themselves direct admission to an-patient mental health bed..  Likewise, we excluded 
sections of the Act relating only to guardianship or supervisedion of community treatmentt 
 7 
 
(Community Treatment Orders)..  Patients who were detained under short-term assessment 
sections and subsequently admitted compulsorily to a mental health bed were included in the 
compulsory admission group; those discharged from short-term assessment orders or who 
were admitted voluntarily were not.  Patients excluded from the compulsory admission group 
were included in the unexposed group, which comprised those treated as voluntary inpatients 
and/or in the community.  Around 95% Most of those admitted compulsorily (around 95%) 
were detained under MHA Sections 2 and 3. , but thisThis group also included those subject 
to Sections 4, 35, 36, 37, 38, 47 and 48. 
 
No single variable in the MHMDS described the study outcome.  Rather, it was derived from 
several a number of variables, including admissions and discharges, number of bed days, and 
receipt of community treatment in the community, and as well as legal detention status.15 We 
were able to identify whether a patient had been admitted compulsorily and the highest level 
of legal restriction (according to using Sections of the MHA (2007)) in the reporting period, 
but not the number or duration of these episodes.  Therefore, each patient could only be 
counted once regardless of the number of compulsory admissions they had in the study year. 
Hence the outcome concerns patients rather than episodes (compulsory admissions).   
 
The unexposed group therefore comprised all patients who received any type of care other 
than compulsory admission.  Cross-tabulating MHMDS data on community treatment (e.g. 
number of contacts with professionalsa community psychiatric nurse or outpatient 
appointments) with admission data information about time spent in hospital enabled us to 
identify patients who received only community care during the study year. The control group 
therefore comprised all patients who received any type of care other than compulsory 
admission, including admission to hospital on a voluntary basis and/or out-patient or 
 8 
 
community treatment.   
 
Exposures 
MHMDS contained reasonably complete data (% missing) on a limited number of patient 
characteristics, namely age (<0�01%), sex (0�03%) and ethnicity (9�6%).   Several other patient-
level variables could not be included in our analysis due to high levels of missing data: marital 
status (15%); accommodation status (64%), employment status (75%) and diagnosis (81%).  
 
MHMDS spatial identifiers were used to link patient records to several external data sources 
that included variables measuring characterisingfactors  local areas and mental health 
services that were potentially associated  shown by previous studies to influencewith either 
mental health outcomes  (Table 4)within local areas or mental health services delivery within 
service settings.  Variables used to characterise the study sample at different spatial levels are 
shown in Table 4.  Data sources and measures used to derive variables at LSOA-level and 
Provider Trust-level are shown set out as supplementary material. and were either at LSOA-
level or Provider Trust-level.   
 
Statistical analysis 
Multilevel models (MM) were applied using MLwIN 16 As the study aimed to estimate 
variation in compulsory admission in England at different spatial levels, multilevel models 
(MM) were applied using MLwIN software.16 , starting with Tnull (unconditional) models 
which partitioned total variance in compulsory admission between each level in the model.  
he first stage comprised estimating a null model which partitioned the total variance in 
compulsory admission between each level in the model. In the next stage, patient-level 
explanatory variables were included to assess how much of the total variance could be 
 9 
 
explained by these characteristics. In the final stage, this was repeated for explanatory 
variables at local area- and service setting-levels.  
 
Five discrete levels were identified in the MHMDS, iIn addition to patients, a further five 
discrete levels were identified in the MHMDS (Table 1), although computational limitations 
meant that not all could be included in a single model. Moreover, these levels did not nest 
neatly within each other, necessitating use of cross-classified multilevel models (CCMMs) and 
increasing computational complexity.17 Patients were nested within LSOAs but SOAs were not 
nested neatly within Provider Trusts, i.e. patients within any one LSOA could be treated in 
different Trusts.  Such cross-classification results in a data structure that, in effect, increases 
the number of units at the LSOA level.  In the examples shown in figure 1, LSOA 2 is 
represented twice because patients attend Hospital A and Hospital B.   
An illustration of cross-classified multilevel datasets is included as supplementary material. 
 
We aimed set out to specify and estimate the most detailed models possible.  Preliminary 
work suggested that null models with more than four levels, and conditional models with 
more than three levels, were unstable (ie failed to converge with acceptable MCMC 
diagnostics); moreover, there was limited variance in compulsory admission at Strategic 
Health Authority (SHA)-level.  We therefore present findings from competing four-level null 
models, the results of which informed selection of a preferred three-level model.  Finally, 
multivariate models were used to determine how much of the total variance was explained by 
patient-level explanatory variables only, and then by explanatory variables at individual, local 
area- and service setting levels.  
We set out to specify and estimate the most detailed models possible.  Preliminary work 
suggested that null models with more than four levels, and multivariate models with more 
 10 
 
than three levels, were unstable; moreover there was limited variance in compulsory 
admission at the Strategic Health Authority (SHA)-level.  We therefore present findings from 
competing four-level null models before moving to three-level multivariate models based on 
null model results.   
 
 
Since the outcome was binary, multilevel logistic regression was used.  FollwingFollowing 
conventionAs is common,, we assumed the binary outcome was defined by a continuous 
latent variable and the patient-level variance was standardized to the logistic variance of 
�2/3=3�29.18  In this way, variances at each level could be summed, allowing the proportion of 
(unexplained) variation, the Variance Partition Coefficient (VPC), to be calculated at each 
level.  As this method only provides an approximate measure of the VPC in models with 
binary responses, we also calculated Median Odds Ratios (MORs) for our final models.19  If the 
MOR is equal to 1, there is no variation between higher-level settings; large (and statistically 
significant) MORs indicate substantial higher-level variation. 
 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian methods were used to estimate all models.20 All 
null models were estimated twice, first using all available data (n=1,149,541 to 1,207,916) and 
then secondly using only complete cases (n=1,149,541).  A number of MCMC diagnostics were 
used to determine the number of iterations used in each model. We examined .,   These 
includinged an examination of the estimate trace of the estimate, the the distribution plot of 
the posterior distribution and an examiningation of the autocorrelation function.  The number 
of chains was also evaluated usingvia the Raftery-Lewis and Brooks-Draper prospective 
diagnostics. 20 The Bayesian Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) goodness of fit statistic was 
used to compare models.We used the Bayesian Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) statistic 
 11 
 
to compare the fit of alternative MMs.21 Models with lower DIC values suggest a better, more 
parsimonious model; a difference of 10 or more is considered substantial. DIC values are only 
comparable across models with exactly the same observed data and hence these were 
estimated using only complete cases. 
Models with lower DIC values are preferred and a difference of 10 or more is considered 
substantial. DIC values are only comparable across models with exactly the same observed 
data and hence these were estimated using only cases with complete data. 
 
 
 
To estimate the amount of variance explained by patient, local area and service setting 
characteristics, we used the pseudo R-squared approach outlined by Snijders and Bosker18 
(p306).  The vVariance explained at, for example, patient-level was estimated as the 
proportion of total variance attributable to the fixed part of a model that included patient-
level explanatory variables, divided by the total variance.  Total variance is equal to the sum 
of the variances of the fixed part of the model and the (unexplained) variances at each higher 
level.  
 
The statistical significance of fixed-part estimates were tested by deriving Z ratios and 
comparing these against a normal distribution.  Odds ratios (95% confidencecredible 
intervals, CI) are reported to show their size.  We do not report p values, iIn keeping with 
standard practice for reporting Bayesian model results,. we do not report p values.  MORs are 
directly comparable to these fixed-part odds ratios.   Patients were only excluded from 
analyses where data were missing.

<< Table 2 about here >> 
 
Null (unconditional) models 
Table 3 shows alternative null models with four levels.  Overall, between 75�1% and 84�5% of 
the variance in compulsory admission to hospital was at patient-level; between 6�4% and 
6�7% was at LSOA-level; between 5�6% and 7�2% was at PCT-level; between 1�9% and 2�7% 
was at GP-level; and between 6�9% and 12�3% was at Provider Trust-level.  The variance at 
each level was statistically significant (p< 0�001).  
 
Inclusion of PCTs and Provider Trusts in the same model resulted in a reduction in patient-
level variance and a commensurate increase in variance between Provider Trusts (from about 
7% to about 12%).  On further investigation we found that in one-third of Provider Trusts, 
over 80% of patients originated from a single PCT.  It is likely, therefore, that reducedthe 
decrease in variance at the patient level in models 3 and 4 is due to the conflation of patient- 
and higher-level variance caused by the clustering of patients within a small number of PCTs 
perfor each Trust, a problem exacerbated by cross-classification in the data structure.16,22 We 
therefore considered thate estimates of higher-level variance in Models 1 and 2 wereto be 
more reliable than those of Models 3 and 4.  Model comparisons using the DIC statistic 
revealed that Models 2 and 3 were superior to Models 1 and 4, with Model 3 fitting having a 
slightly better fit than Model 2.  Collectively, tThese results indicated that the most 
 13 
 
appropriatea CCMM comprisED with four spatial levels of patients, LSOAs, GP Practices and 
Provider Trusts was the most appropriate model.  
 
<< Table 3 about here >> 
 
 
Multivariate models  
The computationally complex four-level multivariate CCMM produced an unstable solution in 
terms of MCMC diagnostics. Multivariate CCMMs with more than three levels proved 
computationally unstable.  We therefore selected the most important spatial levels for 
inclusion in more complex models.  We did this on the basis of our null models (Table 3, 
Model 2), and following the a priori view that patients and Provider Trusts were essential to 
any model: the former because this was the level at which most variation occurred and ; the 
latter because it representeds the locus at which compulsory admission decisions are made.  
We therefore opted to included patient, LSOA and Provider Trust as the three levels in our 
multivariate models. 
   
Table 4 showpresents the results of patient-LSOA-Provider Trust CCMMs, with and without 
covariates.  The null model was based on an MCMC model with a burn-in of 500 and 
Monitoring Chain Length of 50,000.  and t The model with covariates was run for 100,000  
iterations;.  The MCMC diagnostics described above indicated that the burn-in and chain 
length were sufficiently large.   The null model shows that while the majority of the variance 
in compulsory admission occurredwas found at the patient-level, 8�3% and 7�0% occurred at 
LSOA- and Provider Trust-levels, respectively.  We estimated that patient-level covariates 
explained 8�0% of the total variance in the risk of being compulsorily admitted.  Covariates at

LSOA- and Provider Trust-levels were estimated as explaining only a further 2�2% of this 
variance, 1�1% at each of the two higher levels.  In total, therefore, just over 10% of the total 
variance in compulsory admission was explained by the covariates included in the study. 
 
Given the limited explanatory power of the covariates, the percentage share of the remaining 
(unexplained) variance at higher-levels did not change substantially once thesey were 
included in the model.  Following the inclusion of patient-level covariates, variance fell to 
7�5% and 5�6% for LSOAs and Provider Trusts, respectively.  After further inclusion of LSOA- 
and Provider Trust-level covariates, this remained unchanged at 7�5% at LSOA-level, and fell 
slightly to 5�2% at Provider Trust-level.  
 
<< Table 4 about here >> 
 
At the patient level, after adjusting for all covariates, men hadwere shown to have a higher 
probability of being compulsorily admitted to hospital than women (OR 1�29, 95% CI 1�27- 
1�31, p<0�001).  Patients who were 18 years old or younger were the least likely to be 
admitted compulsorily; compared with this group, the risk of compulsory admission was 
greatest among those aged 18�35 years (OR 1�92, 95% CI 1�82-2�02, p<0�001) and fell with 
age, but remained statistically significant even in the oldest age group (65 years and older) 
(OR 1�12, 95% CI 1�02-1�22, p<0�05).  The largest associations with compulsory admission at 
patient-level were observed for ethnicity, with Black patients having the highest rate of 
compulsory admission compared to the White reference group (OR 2�94, 95% CI 2�90-2�98, 
�������).  Patients of Asian and mixed ethnicity were also significantly more likely to have 
been admitted compulsorily (Table 4). 
 15 
 
 
At the LSOA level, compulsory admission was associated with socio-economic deprivation in a 
manner which suggested a dose-response effect.  Odds ratios for compulsory admission rose 
steadily by deprivation quintile, to a peak of 1�22 (95% CI 1�18 to 1�27, p<0�001) among those 
living in LSOAs with deprivation scores in the top quintile (most deprived) compared to those 
living in the least deprived areas.  The association between compulsory admission and ethnic 
density was also statistically significant and also appeared to show a dose-�response effect, 
with patients living in LSOAs with the most non-white residents having much higher risks of 
being admitted compulsorily (OR 1�51, 95% CI 1�43-1�59, p<0�001).  No statistically significant 
association was found between compulsory admission and LSOA population density (Table 4). 
 
At Provider Trust level, no statistically significant associations were found between 
compulsory admission and bed numbers, length of stay, in-patient services performance, 
Patient Environment and Action Team (PEAT) scores, staff satisfaction or annual number of 
admissions.  Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of 
compulsory admission between London Ttrusts and those outside the capital.  Only one 
Provider Trust-level covariate was significantly associated with greater compulsory admission 
after adjusting for other covariates: patients receiving care from a Trust whose community 
������ ������ �������� ���� ����� ����� ��/better than other Trusts� were more likely to be 
admitted compulsorily than patients receiving care from versus those rated providers rated 
������ ���� ����� T������ �O‘ ����� 95% CI ����-����� �������). 
 
The limited power of LSOA, Provider-Trust and patient characteristics in explaining spatial 
variation in compulsory admission is confirmed by the MORs for LSOAs and Provider Trusts 
(Table 4).  After adjusting for all covariates , these were greater than 1 and larger than the 
 16

Discussion 
Main findings 
We found statistically significant variance at both local area- and service setting-level in 
compulsory admission in England, independent of patient characteristics.  Although most of 
the variance in compulsory admission was observed between patients, almost 13% occurred 
between local areas (LSOAs) and service settings (NHS Provider Trusts), after adjusting for 
patient characteristics.  Slightly more variance was observed between local areas than 
between Provider Trusts.  
 
Most of the variance in compulsory admission remained unexplained, even after adjusting for 
a large number of patient, local-area and service-setting characteristics.  We estimated that 
these covariates explained only around 10% of the total variance in compulsory admission.  
Most of theis relatively modest explained variance was accounted for by patient-level 
characteristics; area- and Provider Trust-level characteristics accounted for only just over 2% 
of total variance in multivariate models.  Mean odds rations (MORs) confirmed the 
occurrence and significance of this unexplained higher-level variance in compulsory admission 
between LSOAs and between Provider Trusts. 
 
Indeed, what was particularly apparent from the present study was tThe non-significance of 
most the Provider Trust-level variables that were included, including measures relating to bed 
capacity was notable.  We note, hHowever, that Trusts with community services rated the 
����� ��������� ����� ����� T����� ���� ������ ����� �� ������ �� ����� �������� ������������� 
 17 
 
suggesting that betterimproving community mental health services may, paradoxically, be 
associated with an increased risk of compulsory admission, perhaps due to greater awareness 
of treatment needs..  This phenomenon has been observed previously, forwith the 
introduction of Assertive Outreach and Crisis Resolution services across the UK.23,24  
 
We found several statistically significant associations at patient and local-area levels.  Black 
pPatients of Black ethnicity were almost three times more likely to be admitted compulsorily 
than White patients, in keeping with evidence from elsewhere,25 and after adjusting for area- 
and Provider Trust-level characteristics.  Compulsory admission was significantly associated 
with local-area deprivation and with the proportion of non-white residents (in LSOAs), after 
adjusting for other covariates including individual ethnicity. 
 
Strengths and limitations 
This was the largest and most complete study of its kind and the national representativeness 
of the study sample, deriving from routine clinical activity, was a major strength.  The complex 
data structure of the data set reflects the real world settings in which patients live and use 
mental health services.  Multilevel models provided a means to examine by which this 
complexity could be examined considered of substantive interest rather than a technical 
nuisance..  The availability of patient-level data, and the ability to link this to area-level 
variables, werewas a particular strengths.  
 
Routine administrative data sources like the MHMDS have limitations, however.  Data were 
not available to allow us to ascertain the number and duration of compulsory admission 
episodes during the study period.  Consequently, we modelled the likelihood that a patient 
was compulsorily admitted at some point during the study period.  This precluded us from 
 18 
 
exploring re-���������� ��� ���������� ����� �������� ��� ��� ������������ ���yse make to 
compulsory admission rates.  
 
We were limited in the patient, local area- and Trust-level variables that were available and 
residual confounding was likely.  The most significant omission in this respect was information 
����� ��������� ���������, socio-economic status and clinical status.26  Similarly, it was 
possible that the association between local area deprivation and compulsory admission was 
inflated by the absence of measures of individual socio-economic status.  Previous studies 
have, however, found modest and contrasting and modest associations between individual-
level socio-economic status and the incidence of psychotic disorders.27 Also, wWe used the 
total number of mental illness beds as we could not were unable to distinguish between bed 
types.  As compulsory admissions may be more closely associated with �a����� beds, future 
research should focus on this subset of mental illness beds.  The capping of official bed 
occupancy statistics at 100% may also have biased our findings towards the null and led to 
reduced estimates of explained variance.28 Finally, Finally, as this was a cross-sectional study, 
we could not investigate factors associated with changes in compulsory admission ratesor 
those which might account for increases in use of the Mental Health Act. 
 
Interpretation of our findings 
Our findings, based on the first-ever analysis of complete national service use data, indicate 
significant (and substantial) variation in compulsory admission at both local area- and 
Provider Trust-levels.  Despite adjusting for a large number of potential confounders, 
covariates explained only a limited amount of variation.  The most likely explanation was the 
absence of information on key variables at all spatial levels, including such as diagnosis and 
illness severity, previous history of admission and/or compulsion, engagement with services, 
 19 
 
isolation, and drug and alcohol use (individual); availability of adequate housing, social care 
and other support services (area); and bed pressures, crisis intervention response times and 
local service configuration and quality (Provider Trust).  
 
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that trends in compulsory admission rates are not uniform, 
and may reflect local factors, such as the challenges of delivering effective, timely home-
based crisis care in areas with high levels of socio-economic deprivation.  Further research is 
needed to elucidate those factors (such as those suggested above) that account for observed 
spatial variation in compulsory admission, and to understand the ways in which factors such 
as area-level deprivation and ethnic density condition access to and delivery of mental health 
care.  Both are, and is likely to prove important in developing future interventions to reduce 
compulsion.29 And whereas previous interventions to reduce compulsory admission have 
focused primarily on the individual (patient) level, such as Community Treatment Orders and 
enhanced care plans, 11 our findings suggestmean that interventions will need to operate at 
more than one spatial level to be effective. 29

Panel: Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Although several studies have been done in the UK and other European countries to examine 
individual, local area and service provider factors associated with spatial variation in the use 
of compulsory admission, few studies have looked at the relative contribution of factors at all 
three levels simultaneously. We searched PubMed for articles published between January 1, 
2000 and December 31st 2016 with the search terms: (compulsory[All Fields] AND 
admission[All Fields]) OR (involuntary[All Fields] AND admission[All Fields]).  Over 730 articles 
were found, 38 of which were of direct relevance to the present study. Much of the previous 
work has consisted of ecological studies. By working at a single aggregate level, these studies 
have been unable to account for the autocorrelation arising from the grouping of patients in 
higher-level settings, be they local areas or service providers. They have also been unable to 
provide an estimate of the relative size of the variation at each of the higher-levels, or the 
contribution of level-specific factors in explaining this variation. This research has also been 
restricted to sub-national samples, either particular regions, cities or hospitals, limiting both 
generalisability and the extent of observed variation.

use data in England, comprising data on over 1.2m patients.  T��� ������� ������� ������� ��� 
occurrence of spatial variation in rates of compulsory psychiatric admission and show that 
this occurs to a substantial and significant degree, and independently, between both local 
areas and mental health service providers.  This amounts to strong evidence of significant 
variation in compulsorily admission between both local areas and services, independent of 
 22 
 
patient characteristics.  Although we found highly significant associations between local area 
socio-economic deprivation and ethnic density, little of the variation between places and 
service providers was explained by the variables characterising local areas, services or 
patients themselves. 
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Compulsory admission rates in England vary between people and places to a significant 
degree.  Understanding how local factors, particularly socio-economic deprivation and ethnic 
density, condition access to and use of mental health services may be key to developing 
interventions and strategies to reduce compulsion.   
 
Panel: Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Compulsory psychiatric admission rates have risen for more than two decades in England, and 
more so since changes to the Mental Health Act in 2007.  This worries patients, providers, 
commissioners and regulators.  Trials of interventions to reduce compulsion have been 
restricted to advance directives and enhanced crisis plans, with limited results.  Research in 
England and other European countries shows that compulsorily admission rates vary between 
places, and understanding this may help identify targets for future interventions.  However, 
previous research has been limited methodologically.  Many studies have been ecological in 
design and incapable of distinguishing the variation between patients from that occurring 
between local areas or services, or controlling for confounding at different levels.  Other 
studies have been limited in the number of areas and services studied, limiting both 
generalisability and the extent of observed variation.

1. It is fine to not report p values if this is what is expected when reporting Bayesian statistics - 
thank you for explaining this. However, we need consistency throughout the paper. On page 
10 you refer the reader to table 3 and state the significance of the variances to all be p<0.001. 
I'm afraid it is Lancet policy that we need each individual p value to be reported to significant 
figures unless p<0.0001. Each one needs to be reported separately (so as an extra column in 
the table) and then you can enter either the exact value, or p<0.0001 if that's applicable. But if 
the p values are mentioned in relation to table 3 they all need to be reported. If instead you 
are saying that in Bayesian methods p values aren't reported than please add a sentence 
saying this here and delete the reference to p values in relation to table 3. 
I hope that makes sense - if we are going to mention p values we need each value reported to 
2 sf, the only exception being where a value is <0.0001 and then this must be stated. We 
cannot just say all <0.001. If p values are not being reported this needs to be consistent, and 
instead of saying p<0.001 like it does now there needs to be an explanation about p values not 
being relevant here. Please email if we've misunderstood. 
 
Thank you for pointing out this oversight.  We agree with the need for consistency and, in 
keeping with our previous discussion on the subject, we have deleted the offending sentence.  
The explanation for the absence of p values appears just a few lines earlier. 
 
2. Please could you upload each table as a separate editable file. We need each table and each 
figure as an individual file that we are able to edit. 
 
We have done this. 
 
3. In the Research in Context panel, we need the final section 'implications of all the available 
evidence' to be about all the evidence, not this specific paper. If you could move 
 
'This study's results confirm the occurrence of spatial variation in rates of compulsory 
psychiatric admission and show that this occurs to a substantial and significant degree, and 20 
independently, between both local areas and mental health service providers' to the 'what this 
study adds' part, and instead make the final part about how all the evidence adds together. 
 
We have moved the text and added a further sentence to the final section, drawing this all 
together.
