Objective To investigate the clinical outcomes after 
hamstring tendon autograft ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with 
accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation.
Design Systematic review according to Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 
guidelines.
Data sources Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, 
Cochrane CENTRAL and Google scholar from 1 January 
1974 to 31 January 2017.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Study 
designs reporting outcomes in adults after arthroscopic, 
primary ACLR with hamstring autograft and accelerated, 
brace-free rehabilitation.
results Twenty-four studies were included in the review. 
The clinical outcomes after hamstring tendon autograft 
ACLR with accelerated brace-free rehabilitation were 
the following: (1) early start of open kinetic exercises at 
4 weeks in a limited range of motion (ROM, 90°−45°) 
and progressive concentric and eccentric exercises 
from 12 weeks did not alter outcomes, (2) gender and 
age did not influence clinical outcomes, (3) anatomical 
reconstructions showed better results than non-anatomical 
reconstructions, (4) there was no difference between 
single-bundle and double-bundle reconstructions, (5) 
femoral and tibial tunnel widening occurred, (6) hamstring 
tendons regenerated after harvest and (7) biological 
knowledge did not support return to sports at 4–6 months.
Conclusions After hamstring tendon autograft ACLR 
with accelerated brace-free rehabilitation, clinical outcome 
is similar after single-bundle and double-bundle ACLR. 
Early start of open kinetic exercises at 4 weeks in a limited 
ROM (90°−45°) and progressive concentric and eccentric 
exercises from 12 weeks postsurgery do not alter clinical 
outcome. Further research should focus on achievement 
of best balance between graft loading and graft healing 
in the various rehabilitation phases after ACLR as well as 
on validated, criterion-based assessments for safe return to 
sports.
Level of evidence Level 2b; therapeutic outcome 
studies.
InTrODuCTIOn
Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction 
(ACLR) could be described as adaptations 
to a complex biological system.1 Outcomes 
after ACLR are influenced by both surgical 
and rehabilitation factors. ACL surgery 
requires the understanding of several factors: 
anatomical graft placement, mechanical prop-
erties of the selected graft tissue, mechanical 
behaviour and fixation strength of fixation 
materials as well as the biological processes 
that occur during graft remodelling, matu-
ration and incorporation.1–5 These factors 
influence directly the mechanical properties 
of the knee joint after ACLR and should, in 
combination with rehabilitation progress, 
dictate the time course until normal function 
of the knee joint can be expected.5 6
What is already known?
 
► Accelerated rehabilitation, defined as early-
unrestricted motion, immediate weight-bearing 
and eliminating the use of immobilising braces, is 
appropriate after ACL reconstruction with patellar 
tendon grafts.
 
► Advantages of accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation 
protocols after ACL reconstruction are earlier normal 
function of the knee and immediate weight-bearing 
postsurgery.
 
► Hamstring tendon ACL autografts undergo an intra-
articular remodelling process.
What are the new findings?
After hamstring tendon autograft ACL reconstruction 
with accelerated brace-free rehabilitation:
 
► Strong evidence suggests that clinical outcome is 
similar after single-bundle and double-bundle ACL 
reconstruction.
 
► Moderate evidence suggests that early start of open 
kinetic exercises at 4 weeks in a limited range of 
motion (90°−45°) and progressive concentric and 
eccentric exercises from 12 weeks postsurgery do 
not alter clinical outcome.

After surgery, graft healing is characterised by a remod-
elling process.2 3 5 8 9 During this period, the graft will 
undergo changes, becoming morphologically similar to 
intact ligament tissue.2 5 9–11 Contemporary rehabilita-
tion—defined as early-unrestricted motion, immediate 
weight-bearing and eliminating the use of immobilising 
braces—is appropriate after ACLR with patellar tendon 
grafts.12–20 However, conclusions are unclear when eval-
uating the effects of this type of rehabilitation after 
hamstring autograft ACLR.1 This is important because 
the hamstring tendons are a popular graft source for 
ACLR.7 Advantages of accelerated, brace-free rehabili-
tation protocols after ACLR are earlier normal function 
of the knee, weight-bearing and alleged ability to return 
to even most strenuous activities after primary ACLR at 6 
months.2 5 10 15 21–26 A major challenge in postoperative reha-
bilitation after ACLR is optimising the balance between 
muscular strengthening exercises and loading of the graft 
to stimulate graft cells to produce cellular and extracel-
lular components for the preservation of graft stability, 
without compromising graft integrity, which might result 
into an early elongation of the ACLR.2 5 11 15 27 28
The purpose of this systematic review is to present the 
current knowledge on outcomes after hamstring tendon 
autograft ACLR with accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation 
in adults. The primary aim was to examine the influence 
of different rehabilitation protocols, patient character-
istics and surgical techniques on clinical outcomes after 
hamstring tendon autograft ACLR. The secondary aim 
was to examine the influence of contemporary rehabil-
itation on tunnel widening, tendon regeneration and 
time to return to sports after hamstring tendon autograft 
ACLR.
METhODs
This systematic review was performed according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).29 We had six key review ques-
tions:
1. How do differences in rehabilitation protocols 
affect clinical outcomes?
2. How do different patient characteristics affect 
clinical outcomes?
3. How do different non-anatomical and anatomical 
surgical techniques affect clinical outcomes?
4. Does 
accelerated, 
brace-free 
rehabilitation 
influence tunnel widening?
5. Do hamstring tendons regenerate after harvest?
6. Does the current biological knowledge on 
hamstring tendon autografts support early return 
to sports?
Eligibility criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic 
review are presented in box 1.
Electronic search
A systematic electronic search was performed using 
specific search terms in the following databases: Embase, 
MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL 
and Google scholar from 1 January 1974  to 31 January 
2017 (online supplementary file 1).
study selection
All potentially eligible articles were screened by 
title, abstract and full text by two teams of reviewers 
(RPAJ and NvM, and RPAJ and JBAvM). When two 
reviewers did not reach consensus, a third reviewer 
(NvM or JBAvM) made the final decision. We screened 
the reference lists of excluded and included articles for 
potentially eligible articles that may have been missed in 
the electronic database search.
Data extraction
Data were extracted by two independent reviewers 
(RPAJ and NvM), and disagreements were resolved by 
consensus.
We extracted data on key variables regarding surgical 
techniques, graft type, patient demographics, details 
of rehabilitation, patient-reported outcome, clinical 
outcome measures and radiological evaluation.
synthesis of results
Due to substantial heterogeneity with regard to surgical 
techniques, populations, outcome and study design, it was

not possible to pool data for statistical analysis. Instead, 
we used a best-evidence synthesis30 31 with the following 
ranking of levels of evidence:
1. Strong evidence is provided by two or more studies 
with good quality (low risk of bias) and by generally 
consistent findings in all studies (≥75% of the 
studies reported consistent findings).
2. Moderate evidence is provided by one good 
quality (low-risk of bias) study and two or more 
questionable quality (higher risk of bias) studies 
and by generally consistent findings in all studies 
(≥75%).
3. Limited evidence is provided by one or more 
questionable quality (higher risk of bias) studies 
or one good quality (low-risk of bias) study and by 
generally consistent findings (≥75%).
4. Conflicting evidence is provided by conflicting 
findings (<75% of the studies reported consistent 
findings).31
risk of bias assessment
Two reviewers (RPAJ and NvM) assessed the risk of bias 
of the articles independently. If the two reviewers did 
not reach consensus, a third reviewer (JBAvM) made 
the final decision. The reviewers were not blinded for 
author, journal or publication. The assessment of risk of 
bias of all articles was performed by standardised check-
lists of the Dutch Cochrane Library (ww

down-
loads), namely for therapy and prevention (intervention, 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and for prognosis 
(cohort studies).
The assessment of risk of bias for RCTs used nine 
criteria, displayed in table 1. These nine items could be 
rated ‘yes’ (+), ‘no’ (−) or ‘do not know’ (?). The same 
list was used for assessing clinical controlled trials, but 
these scored a ‘no’ for items 1 and 2.
The assessment of risk of bias for cohort studies 
described eight items, displayed in table 1. All eight items 
could be rated positive (+), negative (−) or ‘do not know’ 
(?). The same list was used for cross-sectional studies, but 
these scored a ‘−’ for item 2 because the study design 
could cause a selection bias.
We also evaluated two additional items due to their 
influence on outcome after ACLR and contemporary 
rehabilitation: (1) accurate description of the reha-
bilitation protocol and (2) ratio of men and women 
participating in the study. A final judgement of ‘good’, 
‘questionable’ or ‘poor’ was given to every article. A 
‘good’ was assigned to articles scoring positive for more 
than 50% of all items (low risk of bias); a ‘questionable’ if 
the positive score was between 30% and 50% (question-
able risk of bias) and a ‘poor’ was assigned to articles with 
a positive score inferior to 30% (high risk of bias). The 
articles with a total score of ‘good’ and ‘questionable’ 
were included in the review.

risk of bias assessment
The results of the risk of bias assessment for the included 
studies are presented in tables 2 and 3. Five articles were 
discarded because of the total score ‘poor’ after quality 
appraisal. Twenty-four articles were included in the 
systematic review.
Details of studies and rehabilitation
The details of the included studies are presented in 
table 4. The details of accelerated rehabilitation of the 24 
included studies are presented in table 5.
results of individual studies and answers to research 
questions
How do differences in rehabilitation protocols affect clinical 
outcomes after hamstring tendon autograft ACLR with accelerated, 
brace-free rehabilitation?
Czaplicki et al46 prospectively evaluated serial changes 
in isokinetic muscle strength preoperatively and post-
operatively. They found significant differences between 
extension peak torques for the injured and healthy limbs 
at all stages of accelerated rehabilitation. At 1 year, there 
was still a deficit in muscle strength of the operated leg.46
The effects of accelerated brace-free free rehabilitation 
versus rehabilitation with brace and limited ROM for 4 
weeks postsurgery were examined by Christensen et al.12

No differences were found between the two groups for 
IKDC, range of motion (ROM) and peak isometric force 
at 12 weeks postsurgery.12
Fukuda et al10 evaluated the outcome of early start of 
open kinetic chain exercises in a restricted ROM at 1 
year after non-anatomical, four-strand hamstring ACLR. 
A start of open kinetic chain quadriceps exercises at 4 
weeks postoperatively in a restricted ROM (90°−45°) 
did not differ from a start at 12 weeks in terms of ante-
rior knee laxity, pain and functional improvement. The 
early start group showed a faster recovery for quadriceps 
strength (19 weeks vs 17 months).10
The effect of progressive eccentric and concentric 
training at 12 weeks on functional performance after 
four-strand hamstring ACLR was investigated by Kinikli 
et al.33 Outcome measures were isokinetic muscle 
strength, single and vertical hop tests, Lysholm score and 
ACL Quality of Life Questionnaire. There was a signif-
icant improvement of all outcome measures except for 
isokinetic strength of knee extensors and flexors.33
Baltaci et al32 compared a 12-week Nintendo Wii Fit 
versus a conventional accelerated, brace-free rehabilita-
tion after hamstring ACLR. The two different 12-week 
physiotherapy programme had the same effect on muscle 
strength, dynamic balance and functional performance 
values.32 Clark et al52 used the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance 
Board to assess weight-bearing asymmetry during squat-
ting as outcome after hamstring autograft ACLR with 
accelerated rehabilitation. The authors found signifi-
cant increases in asymmetry after ACLR compared with a 
matched control group.52
Jenny et al47 assessed functional outcome (sport 
activity, Tegner, Lysholm and IKDC subjective score) 
and rerupture rate after patient-based decision to 
return to work and sports. Return to work was possible 
for 96% of patients after a mean delay of 2.3 months. 
Return to sports was 92%, 6.1 months for pivoting sports 
and 6.6 months for contact sports. A 6% rerupture rate 
occurred after a new significant knee injury.47 Assessing 
time to return to sports based on muscle strength may 
also be influenced by testing technique. Koutras et al49 
compared knee flexion isokinetic strength deficits 
between seated and prone positions after hamstring 
autograft ACLR with accelerated rehabilitation. Peak 
torque knee flexion deficits were higher in the prone 
position compared with the conventional seated posi-
tion by an average of 6.5% at 60°/s and 9.1% at 180°/s 
(p<0.001). At 9 months after hamstring ACLR, most 
athletes would not be cleared to return to sports if tested 
in prone position.49
Brace-free accelerated rehabilitation after hamstring 
tendon autograft ACLR, early start of open kinetic chain 
quadriceps exercises at 4 weeks in a limited knee ROM 
(90°−45°) and progressive concentric and eccentric 
exercises from 12 weeks do not alter clinical outcomes 
(‘moderate’ level of evidence).

Isokinetic extension peak torque deficit is still present 
at 1 year after accelerated rehabilitation. The use of

Patient-based decision to return to work and sports

How do different patient characteristics affect clinical outcomes 
after hamstring tendon autograft ACLR with accelerated, brace-
free rehabilitation?
Gender
Salmon et al38 did not find significant gender differences 
for graft rupture, activity level, self-reported or functional 
assessment or radiological outcome. Women did have 
significantly greater laxity than men on the Lachman 
test, pivot shift test and KT-1000 mean manual maximum 
testing at all time points. The higher laxity measure-
ments did not influence the self-reported and functional 
outcome assessments.38
Gender does not influence clinical outcomes after 
hamstring tendon autograft ACLR with accelerated, 
brace-free, rehabilitation (‘limited’ level of evidence).
Age
Trojani et al55 retrospectively analysed the same ACLR 
technique as Salmon et al38 in patients >50 years. Surgery 
restored knee stability but did not modify pain in patients 
with previous medial meniscectomy. Graft failure did not 
occur. The authors concluded that age over 50 years is 
not a contraindication to select a hamstring autograft 
for ACLR.55 Toanen et al56 demonstrated that older and 
active patients >60 years without osteoarthritis showed 
good results after single-bundle hamstring autograft 
ACLR. The majority of patients (83%) returned to sports 
activities with 50% returning to their preinjury level of 
activity.56
Age >50 years does not influence clinical outcome 
after hamstring tendon autograft ACLR with accelerated, 
brace-free rehabilitation (‘limited’ level of evidence).
How do different non-anatomical and anatomical surgical 
techniques of hamstring tendon autograft ACLR affect clinical 
outcomes after accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation?
Non-anatomical single tunnel four-strand hamstring tendon 
autograft ACLR
Three studies have examined this surgical technique.21 45 51
Howell et al21 presented a single surgeon prospective 
cohort series of transtibial ACLR technique with special 
attention to intercondylar roof impingement. Patients 
returned to unrestricted sports and work activities after 4 
months. The authors justified the early return to vigorous 
activities at 4 months by unchanged knee stability, girth 
of the thigh, knee extension as well as Lysholm and 
Gillquist scores at 2-year follow-up.21
Ali et al51 presented the outcomes of a single surgeon, 
cross-sectional study of transtibial non-anatomical ACLR 
using a hamstring graft without detachment of its tibial 
insertion. Follow-up was 64 (range 48–84) months. All 
patients achieved full ROM with a mean KT-1000 side-
to-side difference of 1.43 (SD 3.86) and negative pivot 
shift test. The authors concluded that their technique 
showed satisfactory and comparable results to studies 
with conventional detachment of hamstring tendons 
from their tibial insertion.51
Zaffagnini et al45 analysed return to sports in a homo-
geneous group of male professional soccer players 
after ACLR. Follow-up was 4 years. The authors used a 
non-anatomical, four-strand hamstring technique with 
additional extra-articular fixation of the graft. After 12 
months, 95% of patients returned to the preoperative 
professional soccer level. Mean time from surgery to first 
official match was 186 (range 107–282) days. The Knee 
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores reached the 
plateau level at 6 months postoperatively. At 4 years, 71% 
still played professional soccer, 62% at the same preop-
erative level and 9% in a lower division. Five per cent of 
patients experienced rerupture of the ACLR.45
Non-anatomical 
transtibial 
four-strand 
hamstring 
ACLR with accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation is asso-
ciated with good clinical results. Return to sports was 
possible at 4–6 months postsurgery (‘moderate’ level of 
evidence).
Non-anatomical versus anatomical hamstring tendon autograft 
ACLR
Koutras et al36 compared the short-term functional and 
clinical outcomes between a non-anatomical transtibial 
versus an anatomical anteromedial ACL technique. The 
anteromedial approach group had better Lysholm scores 
at 3 months and better performance in the timed lateral 
movement functional tests at 3 and 6 months. All other 
comparisons were non-significant.36
Anatomical ACLR shows better short-term results than 
non-anatomical ACLR after accelerated, brace-free reha-
bilitation (‘limited’ level of evidence).
Single-bundle versus double-bundle hamstring tendon autograft 
ACLR
Sastre et al34 compared anatomical four-strand single-
bundle and double-bundle hamstring ACLR in a 
randomised prospective study. The authors did not find 
any difference between the two groups with respect to 
anterior laxity, pivot shift test, IKDC subjective and objec-
tive scores.34 In a similar study, Czamara et al42 found no 
differences between the two groups for anterior tibial 
translation, pivot shift test, ROM and joint circum-
ference, subjective assessment of pain and knee joint 
stability, peak torque for internal and external rotation 
and run test with maximal speed and change of direc-
tion manoeuvres.42 Karikis et al found that anatomical

double-bundle ACLR did not result in better rotational or 
anteroposterior stability measurements than anterome-
dial portal non-anatomical single-bundle reconstruction 
at 2-year follow-up.48
There is no difference in clinical results between 
single-bundle and double-bundle hamstring tendon 
autograft ACLR with accelerated, brace-free rehabilita-
tion (‘strong’ level of evidence).
Semitendinosus versus combined semitendinosus/gracilis 
autograft ACLR
Krolikowska et al53 assessed isometric and peak torque of 
muscles responsible for internal and external rotation 
of the lower leg post-ACLR after a 6-month accelerated 
brace-free rehabilitation programme. There was no 
difference between patients reconstructed with only the 
semitendinosus autograft (ST) compared with patients 
reconstructed with a combined semitendinosus/grac-
ilis autograft (STGR). There was, however, a significant 
difference in isometric internal rotation strength in the 
operated knee compared with the uninvolved knee at 25° 
of internal rotation in the STGR group.53
There is an influence of additional gracilis harvest in 
internal rotation strength at a deep internal rotation 
angle (‘limited’ level of evidence).
Does accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation after hamstring tendon 
autograft ACLR influence tunnel widening?
Vadalà et al35 analysed tunnel widening after four-strand 
hamstring tendon ACLR by means of CT scan comparing 
accelerated brace-free rehabilitation versus non-accel-
erated rehabilitation with brace. Mean follow-up was 
10 months. There was a significant increase in femoral 
and tibial tunnel diameter after accelerated, brace-free 
rehabilitation.35 The extend of tunnel widening with 
hamstring autograft and accelerated brace-free rehabil-
itation was measured by Srinivas et al50 with CT at 1-year 
follow-up: femoral and tibial tunnel widening varied with 
different methods of fixation and was maximal in the 
tibia with suture disc method compared with interfer-
ence screw fixation.50
Accelerated, brace-free, rehabilitation after hamstring 
tendon autograft ACLR causes increased tunnel widening 
on both the femur and tibia (‘limited’ level of evidence).
Do hamstring tendons regenerate after harvest for ACLR with 
accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation?
Regeneration of hamstring tendons in the upper 
leg after harvest for ACLR with accelerated, brace-
free rehabilitation was examined in two studies.44 54 
Ahlen et al54 performed a retrospective MRI study with 
6-year follow-up after hamstring tendon harvest. The 
gracilis tendon regenerated in 18 of 19 patients, the ST 
tendon in 17 of 19 patients.54 Janssen et al44 performed 
a prospective MRI study in 22 patients with follow-up at 
6 and 12 months. Regeneration of the gracilis tendon 
occurred in all patients, the ST  tendon regenerated in 
14 of 22 patients. The majority of tendons regenerated 
distal to the joint line of the knee. The authors did not 
find a significant relationship between isokinetic flexion 
strength and tendon regeneration.44
Hamstring tendons regenerate after harvest for ACLR. 
There is no evidence to support a relationship between 
increased isokinetic flexion strength and tendon regen-
eration (‘strong’ level of evidence).
Does the current biological knowledge of the hamstring graft 
support early return to sports after ACLR with accelerated, brace-
free rehabilitation?
Janssen et al9 examined 67 midsubstance biopsies after 
clinically successful four-strand hamstring autograft 
ACLR with a standardised accelerated rehabilitation 
programme. Cellular density and vascular density were 
increased up to 24 months after ACLR. Especially the 
strong increase in myofibroblast density, from 13 to 24 
months, indicated an active remodelling process from 1 
to 2 years. Furthermore, vessel density increased over 24 
months, whereas cell and myofibroblast density decreased 
but stayed higher than native hamstring and ACL 
controls. Collagen orientation did not return to normal 
in the study period. The authors question whether early 
return to sports (4–6 months) after accelerated rehabili-
tation is to be recommended after hamstring ACLR.9
Intra-articular hamstring graft remodelling is still 
active at 2 years after ACLR with an accelerated, brace-
free rehabilitation. Based on the current evidence, the 
early return to sports after 4–6 months may be question-
able (‘limited’ level of evidence).
DIsCussIOn
A significant body of literature has shown that accel-
erated rehabilitation—defined as early-unrestricted 
motion, immediate weight-bearing and eliminating the 
use of immobilising braces—is appropriate after ACLR 
with patellar tendon grafts.12–20 However, conclusions are 
unclear when evaluating the effects of this type of rehabil-
itation after hamstring autograft ACLR. There are several 
factors that need to be considered. First, hamstring auto-
grafts require fixation of soft tissue (tendon) to bone.57 A 
period of 8–12 weeks is necessary for proper incorpora-
tion of hamstring grafts in the bone tunnels.58 Fixation of 
this soft tissue graft is considered the ‘weak link’ early on 
after ACLR.58 59 In a systematic review, Han et al concluded 
that both intratunnel and extratunnel fixation methods 
of hamstring ACL autografts displayed comparable 
outcomes based on objective IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner 
scores, anterior knee laxity and return to sports timing.59
Second, the intra-articular remodelling of the ACL 
hamstring autograft requires an optimal equilibrium 
between muscle strength training and graft loading to 
prevent stretch out of the ACL graft.2 11 15 27 60 Finally, 
early after ACLR, relative protection of the autograft 
donor site must be considered. Therefore, force gener-
ation from the hamstrings should be minimised when 
a hamstring autograft is employed.58 In summary,

accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation needs to restore 
knee function and at the same time stimulate optimal 
graft healing.61
Accelerated rehabilitation
This review presented a ‘moderate’ level of evidence that 
accelerated rehabilitation after hamstring ACLR does not 
alter clinical outcome compared with non-accelerated 
rehabilitation with knee brace.12 The rationale of using a 
knee brace is to protect the healing graft during the early 
phases of rehabilitation.23 Various systematic reviews 
could not substantiate this hypothesis based on clinical 
results.23 24 28 62 Furthermore, full weight-bearing without 
crutches within 10 days (with a normal gait pattern) 
improves quadriceps function, prevents patellofemoral 
pain and does not affect knee stability.24 62
This review showed that start of open kinetic chain 
quadriceps exercises with 90°−45° ROM at 4 weeks 
postsurgery does not alter the clinical outcome after 
hamstring 
autograft 
ACLR 
(‘moderate’ 
level 
of 
evidence). The combination of closed and open kinetic 
chain exercises protects the healing graft as a result of 
better dynamic lower extremity stability and neuromus-
cular control.61 Beynnon et al63 found similar maximum 
ACL strain values produced by active flexion–exten-
sion (an open kinetic chain exercise) and squatting (a 
closed kinetic chain exercise). They also demonstrated 
that increasing resistance during the squat exercise 
did not produce a significant increase in native ACL 
strain values, unlike increased resistance during active 
flexion–extension exercise.63 Escamilla et al58 showed 
that non-weight-bearing exercises generally loaded the 
ACL graft more than weight-bearing exercises and that, 
for both exercises, the ACL was loaded to a greater 
extent between 10° and 50° compared with 50° and 100° 
of knee flexion.58 These biomechanical findings are in 
agreement with the good clinical results presented in this 
review with the early start of open kinetic exercises in a 
limited ROM.10 64 Majima et al26 demonstrated that accel-
erated rehabilitation with open kinetic exercises started 
at 7–10 days after hamstring ACLR could rapidly restore 
muscle strength without significantly compromising graft 
stability. However, the incidence of synovitis of the knee 
was significantly increased after accelerated rehabilita-
tion.26 Van Grinsven et al concluded in their systematic 
review on evidence-based rehabilitation after ACLR that 
there is increasing consensus that open kinetic chain 
exercises did not increase graft laxity (in and exceeding 
the safe range with a focus on endurance). Additionally, 
these exercises had a favourable effect on quadriceps 
strength.24
This review also demonstrated that start of eccentric 
and concentric muscle training at 12 weeks after surgery 
did not influence clinical outcome after hamstring auto-
graft ACLR (‘moderate’ level of evidence). Therapeutic 
exercises that emphasise eccentric gluteus maximus, 
quadriceps femoris and gastrocnemius–soleus activation 
can improve lower extremity muscular shock absorption, 
prevent knee reinjury, enhance athletic performance, 
help heal lower extremity musculotendinous injuries, 
increase bone mineral density and decrease fall risk.61 
Further research is warranted to determine the best 
timing of introducing open kinetic exercises and safe 
amount of progressive resistance training after ACLR 
with hamstring autografts.24 65
A critical remark is necessary when accelerated reha-
bilitation is discussed. There is little consensus in the 
literature about what composes an accelerated rehabil-
itation programme because few papers have described 
their protocol adequately.24 In this review, almost all 
included studies on accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation 
agreed that immediate weight-bearing, full ROM and 
closed kinetic exercises were permitted after hamstring 
autograft ACLR. However, if even specified at all, the 
programme varied in their timing and details of open 
kinetic chain exercises, frequency of concentric and 
eccentric training and neuromuscular training (table 4). 
Few studies described full details of the accelerated 
rehabilitation after hamstring ACLR. The rehabilitation 
programme by Shelbourne and Nitz was most often cited. 
This programme emphasised specific presurgical rehabil-
itation goals.23 24 26 46 61–63 Remarkably, only five studies 
in this review provided specific details of this prehabili-
tation.9 36 44 46 49 Furthermore, although referring to the 
aforementioned rehabilitation protocols, the timing 
of return to activities such as running or unrestricted 
sports varied widely among studies, often without specific 
criteria (table 4). The lack of details of accelerated reha-
bilitation programme after hamstring autograft ACLR 
makes it difficult to evaluate the potential disadvantages 
of accelerated rehabilitation such as tunnel widening35 66 
and increased synovitis.26 Postoperative rehabilitation is 
a major factor contributing to the success of ACLR and 
needs to be defined in detail for adequate research on 
clinical outcome and safe return to sports.
return to sports
Return to sports is often used as short-term to midterm 
outcome measure for ACLR and rehabilitation.25 In 
their meta-analysis of 69 articles, Ardern et al67 have 
shown that after ACLR, the overall return to some kind 
of sports activity is 81%.67 Sixty-five per cent of patients 
returned to their preinjury level and 55% to competitive 
sports at final follow-up.67 Younger age, male gender and 
a positive psychological response all favoured returning 
to the preinjury level sport.67 Elite athletes had more 
than twice the odds of returning to competitive sports 
compared with non-elite athletes.67 This is supported by 
the evidence in the present review with 95% return to 
sports 1 year after with accelerated, brace-free rehabili-
tation.45 Elite male UEFA soccer league players needed 
7 months to return to the first training after ACLR, 10 
months to return to regular practice and 12 months to 
return to match play.68 69  Grindem et al have shown that 
the return to play after 9 months postsurgery substan-
tially reduces ACL graft rerupture rate.70 Leading ACL

experts generally let their patients return to sports at 6 
months in average and involvement in active competition 
at 8 months postsurgery.71 However, a recent study by 
Herbst et al showed that most patients, in terms of neuro-
muscular abilities and compared with healthy controls, 
were most likely not ready for a safe return to sports, even 
8 months postoperatively. The most limiting factor was 
a poor Limb symmetry index (LSI) value of <90% if the 
dominant leg was involved and <80% if the non-dominant 
leg was involved.72 Gokeler et al found that the majority of 
patients who are 6 months after ACLR require additional 
rehabilitation to pass return to sports criteria.73 Further 
studies identifying sport-specific differences in ACR 
outcomes in athletes could further enhance accelerated 
rehabilitation programme for athletes after ACLR.45 73
Graft failure after ACLR is not uncommon even with 
improved ACLR techniques.2 3 Evidence-based eval-
uations did not prove a 4–6 months return to sports 
to be safe due to the fact that biological healing is not 
complete.2 9 69 74–76 This is also demonstrated in the 
current review: intra-articular hamstring graft remod-
elling was still active at 2 years after ACLR with an 
accelerated, brace-free rehabilitation.9 This may provide 
biological support for the findings by Paterno et al that 
in the 24 months after ACLR and return to sports, 
patients are at greater risk to suffer a subsequent ACL 
injury compared with young athletes without a history of 
ACL injuries.77 Considering the fact that rehabilitation 
protocols were extrapolated from animal in vivo studies, 
studies on human in vivo graft healing suggest a need for 
new postoperative rehabilitation schedules after ACLR 
with hamstring autografts.2 No final conclusions can be 
drawn on the mechanical strength of the healing ACL 
grafts in humans without any available technique for in 
vivo measurements of their mechanical properties.2 74
In this systematic review, only 20% of studies reported 
assessment criteria for return to sports after hamstring 
autograft ACLR. These criteria, however, lacked specific 
details for use in clinical practice or comparative scien-
tific research. This is in agreement with previous 
reviews on return to sports after ACLR.28 78 79 Further-
more, commonly used muscle functional tests are not 
demanding or sensitive enough to identify differences 
between injured and non-injured sides.69 80 Large 
meta-analysis have shown that despite 90% of patients 
having normal validated outcome scores, only 44% of 
patients returned to competitive sports.79 81 Currently, 
there are no concrete guidelines that allow for a safe 
return to unrestricted activity.79 82 Further research 
is necessary to develop a validated set of criteria to 
determine safe return to sport-specific training and unre-
stricted activity.61 67 69 78 83
One of the strengths of this systematic review is that 
it presents all available knowledge on outcomes after 
hamstring tenson autograft ACLR with accelerated reha-
bilitation. This extensive search strategy was performed in 
several databases, for all relevant papers to be included. 
Furthermore, the PRISMA standard was applied to 
study selection, data collection, risk of bias assessment 
and reporting of results. This led to an extensive and 
complete overview of the current evidence on this topic 
with defined levels of evidence. As such, it is a useful 
paper for ACL experts in various fields of healthcare (eg, 
orthopaedic surgeons, physical therapists) and may facili-
tate interprofessional patient care. This systematic review 
also has limitations. Studies of different evidence levels 
were included in the search for all available knowledge 
on clinical outcome after accelerated, brace-free rehabil-
itation after ACLR. It must be noticed that the type of 
rehabilitation was not a primary intervention in all of the 
included studies. Some conclusions of the ‘best-evidence 
synthesis’ may therefore not be primarily related to accel-
erated rehabilitation. Another limitation is the inclusion 
of studies with limited number of patients. Furthermore, 
the ‘best-evidence synthesis’ by van Tulder et al31 for this 
review may have limited the level of evidence due to the 
quality and limited number of studies for specific research 
questions. Although strict and adapted for various study 
types, the risk of bias assessment of the Cochrane Library 
may limit the strength of evidence. It may be argued that 
a ‘low’ risk of bias RCT study is of higher level of evidence 
than a ‘low’ risk of bias prospective cohort study.
The inclusion of merely publications in English is 
another limitation.
COnCLusIOns
After hamstring tendon autograft ACLR with acceler-
ated brace-free rehabilitation, clinical outcome is similar 
after single-bundle and double-bundle ACLR. Early start 
of open kinetic exercises at 4 weeks in a limited ROM 
(90°−45°) and progressive concentric and eccentric 
exercises from 12 weeks postsurgery do not alter clinical 
outcome. Further research should focus on achievement 
of best balance between graft loading and graft healing 
in the various rehabilitation phases after ACLR as well as 
on validated, criterion-based assessments for safe return 
to sports.
