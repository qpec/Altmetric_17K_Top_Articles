Abstract
Background—A recent open-label pilot study (N=15) found that two to three moderate to high 
doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist psilocybin, in combination with 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation, resulted in substantially higher 6-
month smoking abstinence rates than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone.
Objectives—To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at 
≥12 months after psilocybin administration.
Methods—The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the 
previous pilot study at ≥12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin.
Results—All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-
term (≥16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16 – 57 months) 
between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month 
follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, 
nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 
participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the 5 most personally meaningful 
and spiritually significant experiences of their lives.
Conclusion—These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, 
psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. The present 
study adds to recent and historical evidence suggesting high success rates when using classic 
psychedelics in the treatment of addiction. Further research investigating psilocybin-facilitated 
treatment of substance use disorders is warranted.

 Introduction
With almost 6 million tobacco-related deaths per year worldwide, and that number projected 
to rise to an estimated 8 million annual mortalities by 2030, smoking remains among the 
leading public health concerns of the 21st century (1). At present, the most successful 
available smoking cessation treatments fail to promote long-term abstinence in the majority 
of individuals who use them (2,3), underscoring an urgent need to explore innovative 
treatment approaches.
The authors recently reported on a novel intervention for smoking cessation combining two 
to three administrations of psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonin 2A receptor (5-
HT2AR) agonist, with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Initial results showed that 80% 
of participants in this open-label pilot-study (N=15) were biologically verified as smoking 
abstinent at the 6-month follow-up (4). Pilot results demonstrated safety and feasibility in 
this sample, with physiological adverse effects limited to mild post-session headache, and 
modest acute elevations in blood pressure and heart rate (4). Six volunteers (40%) reported 
acute challenging (i.e., fearful, anxiety-provoking) psilocybin session experiences. However, 
these effects resolved by the end of drug session days via interpersonal support from study 
staff, without pharmacologic intervention or persisting deleterious sequelae (4). The current 
report presents long-term follow-up data from this trial, including abstinence outcomes at 12 
months and an average of 30 months post-treatment, as well as data on persisting 
psychological effects at 12-month follow-up.
Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine, and all participants provided informed consent. Participants were 15 
smokers (10 males) without histories of severe mental illness, with a mean age of 51 years, 
who smoked on average 19 cigarettes per day (CPD) for a mean of 31 years at screening, 
with a mean of 6 previous quit attempts. Participants underwent a 15-week combination 
treatment consisting of four weekly preparatory meetings integrating CBT, elements of 
mindfulness training, and guided imagery for smoking cessation. Participants received a 
moderate (20 mg/70 kg) dose of psilocybin in week 5 of treatment, which served as the 
Target-Quit Date (TQD), and a high dose of psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) approximately 2 
weeks later. Participants had the opportunity to participate in a third, optional high-dose 
psilocybin session in week 13 of study treatment.
For 10 weeks following the TQD, participants returned to the laboratory to provide breath 
and urine samples to test for recent smoking, complete self-report questionnaires, and meet 
with study staff. Participants returned for follow-up meetings at 6 and 12 months post-TQD, 
and were later invited back for a retrospective interview probing potential mechanisms of the 
study treatment at a mean of 30 months post-TQD. For a detailed description of the study 
sample and intervention see Johnson et al. (4). The current report presents previously 
unpublished data regarding smoking cessation outcomes at the 12-month and long-term 
follow-ups.

 Measures
Smoking Biomarkers—Biomarkers of recent smoking were used to assess participants’ 
smoking status at 12-month and long-term follow-ups. Breath carbon monoxide (CO) was 
measured using a Bedfont Micro+ Smokerlyzer (Haddonfield, NJ). Urine samples were 
collected and sent to an independent laboratory (Friends Medical Laboratory, Baltimore, 
MD) for analysis of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine.
Timeline Follow-back (TLFB)—Using the TLFB, a widely used retrospective measure of 
substance use (5), participants provided self-reported estimates of their daily cigarette 
consumption in the 30 days prior to beginning the study treatment. On all subsequent visits 
participants self-reported daily cigarette consumption since the last laboratory visit using the 
TLFB. Therefore, the TLFB provided continuous daily data on cigarette consumption.
Persisting Effects Questionnaire—Participants completed a 143-item questionnaire 
designed to measure persisting changes in attitudes, moods, behavior, and spirituality 
attributed to their most recent psilocybin experience one week after each psilocybin session. 
A retrospective version of this questionnaire was administered at the 12-month follow-up 
asking participants to respond regarding their cumulative psilocybin session experiences.
This questionnaire has previously been used to assess intermediate and long-term effects of 
psilocybin (6–8). The initial 140 items are rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 
5 (extreme) assessing positive and negative changes in six categories: Attitudes about life 
(26 items); Attitudes about self (22 items); Mood changes (18 items); Relationships (18 
items); Behavioral changes (two items); and Spirituality (43 items). Additionally, this 
questionnaire included three items asking participants to rate: 1) the overall personal 
meaning, 2) spiritual significance, and 3) effects on well-being or life satisfaction attributed 
to psilocybin experiences or contemplation of those experiences.
Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30)—The MEQ30 is a validated 30-item 
scale designed to assess the occurrence and intensity of mystical-type experiences 
occasioned by psilocybin (9,10). Psilocybin occasioned mystical experiences are defined by 
acute feelings of unity, sacredness, a noetic quality, positive mood, transcendence of space/
time, and ineffability (6), and have previously shown a significant association with 
successful psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation outcomes at 6-month follow-up (11). 
The MEQ30 was completed at the conclusion of each psilocybin session approximately 7 
hours after drug administration. Participants responded based on their experience during 
each particular session day.
Data Analysis
Participants were judged abstinent if breath CO value was ≤6ppm (12), urinary cotinine was 
<200 ng/mL (13), and if no smoking was reported on the TLFB for the previous 7 days. 
Urine samples testing negative for recent smoking were scored as 0 ng/mL for all analyses, 
as laboratory results did not provide specific values for negative (<200 ng/mL) samples. 
Participants who did not report to a follow-up visit were considered to have smoked. The 
three participants who did not complete a long-term follow-up (which occurred at a mean of

 30 months post-TQD for those who completed) had been confirmed as daily smokers at the 
12-month follow-up. Thus, for these three individuals, carbon monoxide, urine cotinine, and 
TLFB self-reported daily smoking data for the long-term follow-up were imputed using their 
individual 12-month follow-up values.
Repeated measures ANOVA tested for changes in TLFB self-reported smoking from study 
intake to long-term follow-up. Planned comparison two-tailed paired t-tests were used to 
compare TLFB data between study intake and each of the following time points: end of 
treatment (10 weeks post-TQD), and 6-month, 12-month, and long-term follow-ups.
Descriptive statistics were calculated using Persisting Effects Questionnaire data to assess 
long-term positive and negative changes, personal meaning, and spiritual significance 
attributed to psilocybin session experiences one week after each session, and at 12-months 
post-TQD.
To examine the hypothesis that greater mystical-type effects and more positive attributions 
regarding psilocybin sessions would be associated with greater smoking cessation success, 
Pearson’s correlations were calculated between psilocybin session ratings (i.e., individuals’ 
mean MEQ30 score across psilocybin sessions from the end of each session day, and 
individuals’ mean ratings of personal meaning and spiritual significance across psilocybin 
sessions from one week after each session) and long-term change scores on each smoking-
related measure (i.e., breath CO, cotinine, TLFB). Change scores were calculated as each 
participant’s score at study intake subtracted from that participant’s score at long-term 
follow-up. For the TLFB this was calculated as mean cigarettes per day (CPD) in the 30 
days preceding study intake, subtracted from mean CPD from TQD to long-term follow-up. 
All datasets examined via correlational analyses were normally distributed as determined by 
Dallal-Wilkinson-Lilliefor corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests at an alpha level of 0.05 
(14).
Results
All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up. Twelve (80%) returned for a long-term 
follow-up (mean 30 months post-TQD; range = 16–57 months) and provided data regarding 
current smoking and past treatment experience. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants 
(67%) were biologically confirmed as smoking abstinent, with 8 of these participants 
reporting continuous abstinence since their TQD. At long-term follow-up, nine participants 
(60%) were biologically confirmed as smoking abstinent, with 7 of these participants 
reporting continuous abstinence since their TQD (Figure 1A–C).
Repeated measures ANOVA found significant change in self-reported smoking on the TLFB 
from study intake through the four follow-up time points at 10 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 
and a mean of 30 months post-TQD (F 2,23 = 81.4; p < 0.001). Planned comparison two-
tailed paired t-tests showed a significant decrease in self-reported daily smoking between 
study intake and the four follow-up time points, from a mean (SD) of 16.5 (4.3) CPD at 
study intake, to 1.4 (3.8) CPD at 10 weeks (t14 = 19.4, p < 0.001); 2.7 (5.5) CPD at 6-

 months (t14 = 11.6, p < 0.001); 3.3 (6.5) CPD at 12-months (t14 = 9.2, p < 0.001); and 4.3 
(6.6) CPD at long-term follow-up (t14 = 9.1, p < 0.001).
Positive persisting effects were rated higher than negative persisting effects across all six 
domains of the Persisting Effects Questionnaire, with average negative effects scores ranging 
from 3.2 to 8.1% of maximum possible score, and average positive effects scores ranging 
from 53 to 64% of maximum possible score (Table 1). For the final question regarding 
effects on well-being or life satisfaction attributed to psilocybin experiences or 
contemplation of those experiences, one participant deviated from instrument instructions by 
endorsing both −3 (decreased very much) and +3 (increased very much) at the 12-month 
follow-up. We therefore excluded this person’s data on this single item from the results 
reported in Table 1. No other participants endorsed any level of decrease in well-being or life 
satisfaction related to psilocybin session experiences at the 12-month follow-up.
The participant endorsing mixed results for well-being or life-satisfaction at the 12-month 
follow-up attributed the decrease in well-being or life-satisfaction to psilocybin session 
content in which she reported re-experiencing traumatic childhood memories. This 
individual was referred to additional counseling, which she reported to be helpful in 
integrating these experiences and resolving associated difficulty. One other participant 
sought outside counseling after their psilocybin session experiences, although this was 
reportedly undertaken with the intention of personal growth and self-improvement. 
Consistent with previously published data (4), no participants reported an increase in 
bothersome visual disturbances at the 12-month follow-up relative to baseline, and no 
clinically significant psychological sequelae were spontaneously reported at the long-term 
follow-up.
Participants attributed great personal meaning and spiritual significance to their psilocybin 
experiences at 12-months post-TQD, with 13 (86.7%) rating these experiences among the 
five most personally meaningful of their lives, and 13 (86.7%) rating them among the five 
most spiritually significant experiences of their lives.
Change in urine cotinine levels from study intake to long-term follow-up were significantly 
correlated with mean ratings of personal meaning of psilocybin session from one week after 
each session (r = −0.55, p = 0.04), and mean MEQ30 scores from the end of each session 
day (r = −0.55, p = 0.03; Figure 1D). The 7 other correlations between psilocybin session 
attributes and smoking cessation success did not reach significance (p range: .10 to .36) but 
were consistently in the predicted direction with moderate effect sizes (r range: −.25 to −.
44).
Discussion
These results, together with previously reported findings indicate that psilocybin may be a 
feasible adjunct to smoking cessation treatment. In controlled studies, the most effective 
smoking cessation medications typically demonstrate less than 31% abstinence at 12 months 
post-treatment (15,16), whereas the present study found 60% abstinence more than a year 
after psilocybin administration. However, the current findings are limited by the small

 sample, open-label design, and lack of control condition, which preclude making definitive 
conclusions about efficacy. Furthermore, participant self-selection bias may have played a 
role in observed success rates, as the study enrolled only individuals motivated to quit and 
willing to undergo a time-intensive experimental treatment for no monetary compensation.
Additional, carefully controlled research in larger, more diverse samples is necessary to 
determine efficacy. Toward this end, the authors are currently conducting a randomized 
comparative efficacy trial in a larger study sample (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier 
NCT01943994). This study is evaluating smoking cessation outcomes between individuals 
receiving a single high dose (30 mg/70kg) of psilocybin vs. a standard 8 to 10 week course 
of nicotine replacement therapy (i.e., patch), with both groups receiving the same cognitive 
behavioral smoking cessation intervention.
Nevertheless, the present results suggest persisting effects of psilocybin-facilitated treatment 
well beyond the time course of acute drug action. Consistent with previous findings, results 
indicated greater mystical-type effects and more positive attributions regarding psilocybin 
sessions were associated with greater smoking cessation success. The only significant 
correlations were between cotinine reductions and mystical-type psilocybin effects, and 
between cotinine reductions and ratings of session personal meaning. However, all other 
correlations between subjective effects of psilocybin and change in smoking-related 
measures were in the predicted direction with a moderate effect size. Therefore, the failure 
of these other correlations to reach significance might constitute a type II error related to 
small sample size.
While the intervention used in this study was not explicitly “spiritual” in nature, participants 
consistently attributed a high degree of spiritual significance to their psilocybin session 
experiences, raising questions about the role of spirituality in smoking cessation. Several 
studies suggest that increased levels of spirituality are associated with improved treatment 
outcomes in substance dependence recovery (17–20), and pilot survey data indicate that 78% 
of smokers reported that spiritual resources would be helpful in quitting smoking (21). The 
lasting psychological and behavioral shifts observed following psychedelic administration 
may be mediated in part by the salient, often subjectively positive acute effects of 5-HT2AR 
agonists, which have sometimes been characterized as mystical or transcendent (7,11,22).
Combined with historical data suggesting high success rates of psychedelic-facilitated 
treatment of alcoholism approximately doubling the odds of success at initial follow-up (23), 
and promising recent pilot data on psilocybin-facilitated treatment of alcohol dependence 
(24), the present findings indicate that 5-HT2AR agonists may hold therapeutic potential in 
treating a variety of substance use disorders in the context of a structured treatment program. 
Considering the often chronic and intractable nature of addictive disorders, further 
investigation of psychedelic-facilitated treatment of addiction and underlying 
neurobiological mechanisms represent important future directions for research.
