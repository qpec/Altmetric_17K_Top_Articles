Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition is the most 
powerful intervention to increase lifespan in simple 
model organisms and rodents [1]. CR decreases 
inflammation, which is believed to protect against age-
associated 
diseases 
[2, 
3]. 
Low-grade 
chronic 
inflammation is  deeply implicated  in  the  pathogenesis

reactive protein (CRP, a highly specific systemic marker 
of inflammation) and TNF-α (a powerful pro-
inflammatory cytokine) are both associated with an 
increased risk of developing insulin resistance, type 2 
diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer

Abstract: Calorie restriction (CR) inhibits inflammation and slows aging in many animal species, but in rodents housed in
pathogen‐free facilities, CR impairs immunity against certain pathogens. However, little is known about the effects of long‐
term moderate CR on immune function in humans. In this multi‐center, randomized clinical trial to determine CR’s effect
on inflammation and cell‐mediated immunity, 218 healthy non‐obese adults (20‐50 y), were assigned 25% CR (n=143) or an
ad‐libitum (AL) diet (n=75), and outcomes tested at baseline, 12, and 24 months of CR. CR induced a 10.4% weight loss over
the 2‐y period. Relative to AL group, CR reduced circulating inflammatory markers, including total WBC and lymphocyte
counts, ICAM‐1 and leptin. Serum CRP and TNF‐α concentrations were about 40% and 50% lower in CR group, respectively.
CR had no effect on the delayed‐type hypersensitivity skin response or antibody response to vaccines, nor did it cause
difference in clinically significant infections. In conclusion, long‐term moderate CR without malnutrition induces a
significant and persistent inhibition of inflammation without impairing key in vivo indicators of cell‐mediated immunity.
Given the established role of these pro‐inflammatory molecules in the pathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases, these CR‐
induced adaptations suggest a shift toward a healthy phenotype.

 adipose tissue TNF-α expression [9]  and serum TNF-α 
levels [10], which are reduced by weight loss [9, 11]. 
However, concerns exist regarding the potential 
immunosuppressive effects of CR, because some studies 
have shown a detrimental effect on cell-mediated 
immune  responses in monkeys [12] and increased 
susceptibility to infection in rodents [13, 14]. On the 
contrary, other studies in aging mouse and monkeys 
show that CR can enhance the T cell receptor diversity 
suggesting improved immune –surveillance [15, 16].  
 
In humans, CR including a restriction of protein and 
essential 
nutrients 
impairs 
cell-mediated 
immune 
responses [17] and increases susceptibility to morbidity 
and mortality from infectious diseases. However, little is 
known about the long-term effects of moderate CR with 
adequate intake of nutrients on inflammatory markers 
and cell-mediated immune response of healthy adults.  
 
A purpose of this 2-year multicenter randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the effects of a 
25% CR diet on inflammatory markers [WBC count, 
high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, adhesion molecules], and in vivo measures of 
cell-mediated immunity [antibody response to 3 vaccines, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response (DTH) 
to three recall antigens] in a large number of healthy, 
non-obese young and middle-aged individuals. Self-
reported infections, allergies and related medications 
were documented. 
 
RESULTS 
 
Participants and baseline characteristics   
 
As described previously [18], 1,069 interested individuals 
were invited to an in-person screening evaluation, 238 
started baseline testing and 220 were randomized. Two 
CR participants dropped prior to randomization, resulting 
in an ITT cohort of 218 (Figure 1 and Table 1). Thirty 
participants withdrew from the study [4 (5.3%) in the AL 
and 26 (18.2%) in the CR group (p= 0.01)]. Three CR 
participants continued the study evaluations beyond 
withdrawal and were included in analyses. There were no 
differences at baseline between AL and CR groups in 
biometric and demographic variables including body 
weight, body mass index (BMI) and other body 
composition and demographic variables, blood glucose or 
lipid profile (Table 1) or for any of the immune and 
inflammatory outcomes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. CONSORT diagram. Two hundred and thirty eight individuals were eligible and 220 individuals were randomized. Two
individuals, both assigned to the calorie‐restricted (CR) group, dropped out prior to starting the intervention, resulting in an intention‐to‐
treat cohort of 218 participants; 75 in the ad libitum (AL) control and 143 in the CR group (Table 1). Thirty participants were withdrawn or
dropped from the intervention prior to completion including 4 (5.3%) in the AL control group and 26 (18.2%) in the CR group (p=0.01).

Intervention adherence and body composition  
 
Participant adherence and changes in body composition 
in response to CR have been published elsewhere [19]. 
Energy intake was reduced by 19.5 (0.8) % (480 kcal/d) 
during the first 6-months of CR, and by an average of 
9.1 (0.7) % (234 kcal/d) for the remaining 18-mo 
(p<0.0001 vs. AL). CR induced significant reduction in 
body weight [8.3 (0.3) kg (11.5%) at 1-y and a net 
change of 7.6 (0.3) kg (10.4%) at 2-y (p<0.001)], BMI 
and % body fat [19]. No significant change was 
observed in energy intake or body composition in the 
AL group. Measured  by  DEXA,  CR  induced  a  6.1%  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(0.2) kg change in Fat Mass at 1-yr and 5.3 (0.3) kg at 
2-yr, but did not change in the AL group. 
 
Moderate CR impacts white blood cell profile 
 
Complete blood count and differentials (CBC-Diff) 
stayed within normal ranges in both groups. However, 
compared to AL, CR significantly reduced the number 
of WBC at month 12 (p=0.03), and 24 (p=0.002) 
(Figure 2A). There was a trend for a correlation 
between changes in BMI from baseline to 24 months 
and that of WBC number (r=0.14, p=0.07) when both 
CR and AL groups were combined.

Compared to AL, CR significantly reduced the number 
of lymphocytes at month 24 (p=0.0001) (Figure 2B). 
The difference in the change in lymphocytes between 
CR and AL group was -0.106 at 12 months (p=0.09) 
and -0.207 at month 24. (p<0.0001. A significant 
correlation between changes in BMI from baseline to 
month 24 and that of lymphocytes (r=0.20, p=0.006) 
was observed when both CR and AL groups were 
combined.  
 
While a significant difference in change in monocytes 
was observed between the two groups, this was mainly 
due to an increase in the AL group. The decrease in 
neutrophils in the CR group at month 24 in comparison 
to the AL group tended to be significant (p=0.067)

the eosinophils or basophils were observed (Both 
groups showed a small but significant increase in 
basophils; these numbers stayed within normal ranges 
(Supplemental Table 1).   
 
Moderate CR reduces circulating inflammatory 
markers  
 
CRP (natLog) decreased significantly in the CR 
compared to AL group at both months 12 and 24 
(p=0.001) (Figure 3A). The correlation between change 
in BMI and change in the natural logarithm of CRP 
trended toward significance (r=0.15, p=0.05).  
 
Plasma TNF-α decreased significantly in both AL and 
CR groups at month 12 (-0.34 vs. -0.30 pg/mL;

further declines in the CR group between month 12 and 
24 (p=0.018) resulted in a significantly higher decrease 
in TNF-α in CR compared to AL group at month 24 
(p=0.025) (Figure 3B). A significant correlation 
between changes in BMI from baseline to 24 months 
and that of TNFα (r=0.15, p=0.04) was observed when 
both CR and AL groups were combined.  
 
Compared to AL group, there was a significant decline 
in serum ICAM-1 levels in the CR group  from baseline 
to month 12 (P<0.0001), however, ICAM levels in the 
AL group decreased significantly between month 12 
and 24 (P<0.0001) resulting in a non-significant 
difference between the AL and CR groups at month 24 
(P=0.14) (Figure 3C). A significant correlation between 
change in BMI from baseline to 24 months and that of 
ICAM-1 (r=0.17, p=0.02) was observed when both CR 
and AL groups were combined.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The change in leptin level was significantly greater in 
CR compared to AL group at both month 12 and 24 
(p<0.0001) (Figure 3D). In addition, a significant 
correlation was observed between changes in BMI from 
baseline to month 24 months and changes in leptin 
when both CR and AL groups were combined (r=0.60,

No significant changes were observed for IL-6, IL-8, 
and MCP-1 (data not shown). 
 
Response to vaccine 
 
Antibody responses to vaccines were measured at the 
end of the intervention. Three vaccines, Hepatitis A 
(HEP-A) (primary T cell-dependent), tetanus/diphtheria 
(TD) (secondary T cell-dependent) and pneumococcal 
(B cell dependent) (PN) were administered at month 17.

17 (before vaccination), 18, and 24 (after vaccination) 
for all vaccines, and 23 for before HEP-A booster. 
There was no significant difference between AL and CR 
groups in pre-vaccination (month 17 and 23) or post-
vaccination (month 18 and 24) levels of antibodies to 
Hepatits A HEP-A, TD), or any of the PN IgG serotypes

 There were no significant main effects of treatment or 
time and their interaction or in the change during 2-
years in the total number of positive antigens or total 
diameter of induration for positive responses (≥5mm) or 
all observed responses at 24 or 48 hours between CR 
and AL groups. A significant within CR group change 
from baseline to month 24 (p=0.001) in total diameter 
of induration (Table 2) was observed and both groups 
showed a significant decline in the diameter of 
induration for positive responses (values ≥5mm) to 
Tetanus toxoid (p=0.016). The reason for this decline is 
not 
clear 
and

true for the annualized rate of infection and allergies 
with the exception of lower respiratory (CR group 
tended to have a lower rate 0.046 vs 0.015; p=0.058) 
and eye infections (CR group had a higher rate 0.00 vs 
0.019; p=0.036) (Supplemental Table 3A).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
This is the first RCT to test the long-term effects of 
moderate CR without malnutrition in a large sample of 
young and middle-aged non-obese individuals using a 
variety of inflammatory and immune outcomes. We 
show that 25% CR for 24 mo persistently reduced 
circulating inflammatory markers including WBC 
count. Serum concentrations of CRP and TNF-α were 
about 40% and 50% lower in the CR group, 
respectively. Furthermore, despite a major reduction in 
body fat and circulating leptin levels, a significant 
impairment in key in vivo measures of adaptive immune 
function with CR was not observed in our study and this 
finding is supported by the lack of clinically significant 
differences in self-reported infection rate between CR 
and AL groups.  
 
Low-grade chronic inflammation is implicated in the 
pathogenesis 
of 
multiple 
age-associated 
chronic 
diseases and in the biology of aging itself [4]. On the 
other hand, research on rodents housed in pathogen-free 
facilities and data from undernourished children and 
adults living in third world countries suggest that a 
chronic reduction in energy intake may impair adaptive 
immunity against pathogens by lowering leptin and 
other nutrient-sensing pathways [17, 20] While data 
from animal and observational human studies show that 
CR without malnutrition inhibits inflammation [3, 20-
22], this RCT is the first to show a causal relationship in 
humans. The WBC count has been broadly used as a 
non-specific marker of systemic inflammation [23], 
with higher levels, even when within the clinical 
reference range, associated with an increased risk of 
developing insulin resistance, T2D [24], hypertension 
[25], CVD [26], and cancer [27]. Moreover, the relative 
risk of CVD and cancer mortality increases in a dose-
dependent manner with increasing WBC count, 
independent of other risk factors [28]. Data from 
previous weight loss studies in obese individuals have 
shown that CR reduces total WBC count, IL-1β, IL-6, 
and TNF-α [29]. We found that CR induced a 
significant reduction in total WBC, lymphocyte and 
monocyte count, as well as a strong trend (p=0.067) for 
a decrease in neutrophils, suggesting that CR has 
metabolic benefits even in non-obese individuals. The 
anti-inflammatory effect of CR is further supported by 
the CR-induced decrease in serum levels of CRP, TNF-
α, ICAM-1, and leptin [30].  However, in our study the 
serum 
concentrations 
of 
other 
pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) were 
not significantly altered by CR, probably because our 
volunteers were healthy, young to middle-aged and non-
obese, with relatively low levels of visceral adiposity 
[31]. Since obesity-associated increase in circulating IL-
6 is mainly contributed by increased output from the 
visceral adipose tissue [31], it is possible that a 
reduction in visceral fat mass would lead to more 
pronounced IL-6-lowering effect in an obese individual 
relative to their non-obese counterpart with an already 
low IL-6 level. 
 
The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory 
effect of CR are not entirely clear. It is hypothesized 
that the reductions in fat mass and leptin largely explain 
the beneficial effect of CR on inflammation. However, 
our findings suggest that other metabolic and molecular 
factors may play a role, because peak reduction in 
circulating leptin levels at month 12 were not 
accompanied by a significant reduction in serum TNF-α 
levels. Thus, the significant reduction in CRP and TNF-
α concentrations observed at 24 months may be due to 
CR-induced alterations of the neuroendocrine system 
through 
the 
down-regulation 
of 
nutrient-sensing 
pathways that impact mitochondrial function, redox 
status and inflammatory gene activation [32-35].  
 
A major finding of this study is the lack of significant 
negative effects of CR on key in vivo indicators of cell-
mediated immunity. There is controversy in the 
literature regarding the impact of CR on cell-mediated

 immunity. Although some animal studies indicate that 
age-associated impairment of immune function may be 
improved by CR, and short-term CR in a small number 
of subjects improved T cell-mediated function [36], 
others have raised concern regarding the potential 
adverse impact of CR on cell-mediated immunity and 
resistance to pathogens. For example, CR mice were 
shown to have lower natural killer cell activity, 
decreased survival, and delayed viral clearance 
compared to ad-libitum fed mice [13, 14], which can be 
reversed by re-feeding [37]. CR also caused higher 
mortality from polymicrobial sepsis [38] and West Nile 
Virus [39], and more susceptibility to the intestinal 
parasite (Heligmosomoides bakeri) infection [40] in 
mice. In this study, despite a ~57% decrease in leptin, 
CR did not exert any detrimental effect on the two best 
available in vivo indicators of acquired (specific) 
immunity, i.e., antibody production to vaccines and 
DTH to recall antigens. This difference might be due to 
moderate level of CR (25%) administered in the current 
study compared to that used in several animal studies 
which can be as high as 40%.  Taken together, these 
results suggest that moderate CR without malnutrition is 
safe and does not adversely affect immune response to 
pathogens, which is also supported by the lack of 
clinically 
significant 
differences 
in 
self-reported 
infection rate between CR and AL groups. It will be 
interesting to determine if lower than 25% CR would be 
effective in reducing inflammation.  
 
In conclusion, data from this unique RCT showed that 
moderate long-term CR without malnutrition decreases 
inflammation 
in 
non-obese, 
healthy 
adults, 
as 
demonstrated 
by 
reduced 
number 
of 
WBC, 
lymphocytes, and neutrophils in blood, as well as 
reduced circulating levels of CRP, leptin, TNF-α, and 
ICAM-1, with no significant adverse effect on key in 
vivo indicators of cell-mediated immunity. These CR-
induced changes suggest a shift toward a healthy 
phenotype, given the established role of these pro-
inflammatory molecules as risk markers in the 
development of metabolic syndrome and age-related 
chronic diseases, in particular CVD, T2D and cancer. 
 
METHODS 
 
Overview. The Comprehensive Assessment of Long-
term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) 
Phase 2 Study was a two-year, multi-center, parallel-
group, single-blind RCT of healthy individuals 
receiving an intervention to reduce energy intake by 
25% (CR) or maintain habitual ad libitum intake (AL-
control) group. Clinical outcomes were assessed every 
6-mo as detailed elsewhere [19, 41]. The study protocol 
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID:NCT00427193), was approved 
by the institutional review boards at all research sites, 
and participants provided written informed consent. 
Exclusion criteria for administration of vaccine and/or 
DTH included history of allergic reactions, infection or 
exposure to antibiotics in the previous two-weeks, non-
steroidal 
anti-inflammatory 
drugs 
within 
72 
h, 
vaccination within last 6-wk, steroids >10 mg/d, or any 
immunosuppressive medication. For Hepatitis A only 
participants were screened out of the vaccination testing 
if they had previously received a vaccination.  
 
Baseline testing was conducted over six weeks and 
included evaluations of health status and doubly labeled 
water (DLW) measurements of energy expenditure to 
individualize the 25% CR prescription. Fasting blood 
samples were collected for immune parameters. DTH 
and vaccines were administered as indicated below.  
  
Following 
baseline 
testing, 
participants 
were 
randomized to either AL or CR in a 2:1 allocation in 
favor of CR. Randomization was stratified by site (3 
sites), sex, and BMI (normal weight, overweight). 
 
The intervention targeted an immediate and sustained 
25% CR [42, 43]. Control participants were advised to 
continue their current diets. No specific level of 
physical activity was recommended. Percent CR was 
calculated and adherence evaluated from DLW 
measurements at months 12 and 24 [43]. Participants 
(both CR and AL) received a multivitamin and mineral 
supplement (Nature Made Multi Complete, Pharmavite, 
Mission Hills, CA) plus a calcium supplement (1000 
mg/d, Douglas Laboratories, Pittsburgh, PA) to ensure 
current recommendations for micronutrients were met 
regardless of the intervention allocation.  
 
Outcome assessments. 
Participants were weighed in a 
pre-weighed hospital gown after an overnight fast 
(Scale Tronix 5200, White Plains, NY). Height was 
measured twice using a wall-mounted stadiometer. 
Percent body fat, lean mass, and bone were measured 
by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic Inc., 
Bedford, MA) and analyzed using Hologic software 
version Apex 3.3.  
 
As part of safety testing, participants record signs, 
symptoms, adverse events, and medication use in a 
diary and hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis 
were monitored every 3-mo [41]. Self-reported 
infection, allergy, and antibiotic use and duration were 
recorded throughout the study and coded for severity 
(mild, moderate, and severe) by the Coordinating 
Center in accordance with MedRA version 14.1 and 
WHO 
Drug 
Dictionary

 Immune and inflammatory markers. Inflammatory 
markers were measured in fasting blood at baseline, 
month 12 and 24, and analyzed at the University of 
Vermont. Hs-CRP was measured using particle-
enhanced immunonephelometric assay (BN II, Siemens, 
Deerfield, IL; CV=3.2 ± 2.5%); TNF-α, monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), leptin, IL-1β, and 
IL-8 using the multiplex immunoassay (Human 
Adipokine Panel B, Millipore, Billerica, MA; Bio-Plex 
200, 
Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, 
Hercules, 
CA; 
CV=6.1±1.7%, 6.4±2.1%, 4.3±1.5%, 8.0±4.4% and 
8.7±3.9%, respectively); and IL-6 and intracellular 
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) using ELISA (R&D 
Systems, 
Minneapolis, 
MN; 
CV=7.9±3.1% 
and 
8.2±1.2%, respectively). Complete blood count and 
WBC differential (CBC-Diff) were assayed using 
automated 
methods 
(Esoterix 
Inc., 
a 
LabCorp 
Company, Cranford, NJ).  
 
In vivo cell-mediated immunity was assessed using 
delayed type hypersensitivity skin response (DTH) and 
antibody response to 3 vaccines. DTH, which 
determines ability of immune response to antigens to 
which it has been previously exposed, was assessed 
using Mantoux test. Three recall antigens [Tetanus 
toxoid (Aventis Pasteur), Candida albicans  (Candin; 
Allermed 
Laboratories, 
San 
Diego, 
CA), 
and 
Trichophyton species (Trichophyton mentagrophytes in 
conjunction with Trichophyton rubrum; Hollister-Stier 
Labs, Spokane, WA)] and a negative control (0.9% 
normal saline) were used. Antigens were employed in a 
standard volume of 0.1 mL except Tetanus toxoid 
[0.025 mL (0.2 limit of flocculation units per dose)] and 
were injected intradermally on the volar surface of the 
forearm by trained research staff. Vertical and 
horizontal diameters of induration after 24 and 48 h 
were measured, and mean values >5 mm were 
considered positive. Total diameter of induration was 
calculated from sum of the means of the 3 antigens.  
 
Antibody responses to vaccines were measured at the 
end of the intervention. Three vaccines, Hepatitis A 
(HEP-A) (primary T cell-dependent), tetanus/diphtheria 
(TD) (secondary T cell-dependent) and pneumococcal 
(B cell dependent) (PN) were administered at month 17. 
A booster shot for HEP-A was administered at month 
23. Blood for antibody response was collected at month 
17 (before vaccination), 18, and 24 (after vaccination) 
for all vaccines, and 23 for before HEP-A booster. Anti-
HEP-A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies (total immuno-
globulin, IgM and IgG) were measured by chemi-
luminescent immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, 
Indianapolis, IN; CV=1.9 ± 1.4%), anti-diphtheria, and 
anti-tetanus toxoid IgG antibodies by EIA, and anti-
Streptococcus pneumonia IgG antibodies (23 serotypes) 
by 
microsphere 
photometry 
at 
Mayo 
Medical 
Laboratories, Rochester, MN. 
 
Complete blood count with differentials(CBC). CBC 
and white cell differential were assayed using 
automated  methods  employed by Esoterix Inc. 
(A LabCorp Company, Cranford, NJ)  
 
Infection, asthma, allergies and antibiotic use. Self-
reported infection, and asthma, allergy and antibiotic 
use, and their start and end date were recorded 
throughout the intervention period and coded based on 
severity 
(mild, 
moderate 
and 
severe) 
by 
the 
Coordinating Center in accordance with MedRA 
version 14.1 and WHO Drug Dictionary Enhanced-
March 2012 guidelines.  
 
Statistical methods. Methods for the overall CALERIE 
study have been described elsewhere [19]. Briefly, 
intention-to-treat analysis was performed by including 
all available observations. For continuous outcomes 
(CBC-Diff and inflammatory markers) repeated Mixed 
models analysis [44-46] were used to examine change 
from baseline, controlling for site, sex, BMI stratum, 
and the baseline value for the outcome of interest. 
Significant between-group differences at each time 
point were tested at α=0.05. Bonferroni correction was 
applied where appropriate [47] for between group p 
values while within group changes p-values were 
always protected by a Bonferroni correction.  
 
For values beyond the limits of detection of the assay 
for antibody response, a parametric regression model 
used in survival analysis [48] was applied. Values 
above or below detection limits were considered 
censored at those points. Between-group tests were 
performed using the lognormal distribution for the 
outcome adjusting for site, sex, and BMI stratum. 
 
For the three DTH antigens, individual positive values 
were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation 
model [49] with the logit link and the Bernoulli 
variance. The number of positive antigens (0, 1, 2 or 3) 
was treated as a binomial outcome and analyzed in a 
similar manner. The induration diameters were treated 
as continuous and were analyzed using the repeated 
measures model described above.  
 
The annualized infection, allergy, and associated 
medication rates were derived as the total number of 
episodes (or drugs) divided by the amount of follow-up 
time. For any outcome, a between-group comparison 
was performed using a generalized linear model [50] 
with the ln link and the Poisson variance, adjusting for 
site, sex and BMI stratum; the natural logarithm of the

 amount of follow-up time contributed by each 
participant was included as an offset. The incidence of 
any infection was treated as a binary outcome, and 
analyzed using the same ln-Poisson model with the 
modification suggested by Zou [51]. 
 
All analyses were performed by the statistical unit at 
Duke University Clinical Research Institute (DCRI, 
Durham, NC) using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS
