SUMMARY
The optimal foraging strategy in a given environment depends on the number of competing 
individuals and their behavioral strategies. Little is known about the genes and neural circuits that 
integrate social information into foraging decisions. Here we show that ascaroside pheromones 
that signal population density suppress exploratory foraging in Caenorhabditis elegans, and that 
heritable variation in this behavior generates alternative foraging strategies. Natural C. elegans 
isolates differ in their sensitivity to the potent ascaroside icas#9 (IC-asc-C5). A quantitative trait 
locus (QTL) for icas#9 sensitivity includes srx-43, a G protein-coupled icas#9 receptor; srx-43 
acts in ASI sensory neurons to suppress exploration. Two ancient haplotypes associated with this 
QTL confer competitive growth advantages that depend on ascaroside secretion, its detection by 
srx-43, and the distribution of food. These results suggest that balancing selection at the srx-43 
locus generates alternative density-dependent behaviors, fulfilling a prediction of foraging game 
theory.
INTRODUCTION
The benefit of a particular foraging strategy varies based on the behavior of competitors, and 
therefore balancing selection can favor the co-existence of multiple strategies within a 
species1,2. The pioneering example of strategic competition is natural genetic variation at the

 foraging (for) gene in Drosophila melanogaster larvae3,4. Two for alleles for active (rover) or 
sedentary (sitter) behavior are maintained in a population because of frequency-dependent 
balancing selection against larvae with the more common foraging strategy5. This example 
and others like it suggest that animals could benefit from detecting and responding to 
competitors in real time, and modifying foraging behavior accordingly. However, little is 
known about the genes and neural circuits that incorporate information about conspecifics 
into foraging strategies.
An opportunity to address this question is provided by the nematode C. elegans, an animal 
with well-characterized foraging circuits and intraspecific pheromone signaling. C. elegans 
foraging on bacterial food spontaneously alternates between an exploratory behavior called 
roaming and a less active behavior called dwelling, each of which persists for several 
minutes per episode6,7. Transitions between roaming and dwelling are regulated by 
distributed neuromodulatory systems that link internal cues such as nutritional status to 
locomotion circuits7,8. C. elegans senses population density using a family of secreted 
pheromones called ascarosides, which control the developmental decision to enter the 
starvation-resistant dauer larva stage9 and regulate behaviors such as aggregation and male 
attraction to hermaphrodites10,11. Here we show that physiological levels of certain 
ascarosides also regulate foraging by suppressing roaming behaviors. By characterizing 
differences in pheromone sensitivity in natural C. elegans isolates, we identify a pheromone 
receptor that shapes alternative foraging strategies and affects fitness depending on the 
structure of the food environment.
RESULTS
Pheromones regulate foraging behavior
The effects of ascaroside pheromones on C. elegans foraging were examined by quantifying 
long-term exploration of a bacterial lawn by individual wild-type N2 animals (Figure 1A). 
To mimic the effects of high density on these isolated animals, we conducted the assay in the 
presence of natural pheromone extracts. The pheromones strongly suppressed exploration 
(Figure 1B), as did several pure synthetic ascarosides at concentrations at or below those that 
induced dauer larva development (Figure 1C, 1D). However, ascr#5, a potent regulator of 
dauer development, only weakly suppressed exploration (Figure 1D). Thus a subset of 
ascarosides regulates foraging behavior at biologically relevant concentrations.
The exploration assay is an indirect measure of the relative time C. elegans spends in 
roaming and dwelling states7,8. Quantitative behavioral analysis of video recordings showed 
that the potent ascarosides icas#9 or ascr#8 decreased the fraction of time spent roaming, the 
duration of roaming states, and locomotion speed during roaming, but did not affect 
dwelling states (Extended Data Figure 1).
A QTL for pheromone sensitivity
A variety of genetically diverse wild-type C. elegans strains responded to ascarosides with a 
suppression of exploration, like the control N2-like strain CX1231112 (Figure 2A). Among 
the wild strains, the German strain MY14 failed to respond to 10 nM icas#9 in the

 exploration assay, while responding normally to ascr#2, ascr#3, and ascr#8 (Figure 2A; 
Extended Data Figure 2). Coupled alterations in pheromone signaling and detection can 
contribute to reproductive isolation during incipient speciation13. However, MY14 and 
CX12311 were found to produce similar levels of icas#9 and 16 other ascarosides (Extended 
Data Figure 3), indicating that the change in the icas#9 response in MY14 was independent 
of icas#9 production.
To determine the genetic basis of icas#9-insensitivity, 94 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) 
were generated from intercrosses between MY14 and CX12311. A continuous distribution 
of icas#9 sensitivity was observed in exploration behavior of the RILs (Figure 2B) 
suggesting that two or more loci contribute to icas#9-sensitivity. The 94 RILs were 
genotyped at ~185 kb resolution across the genome by low-coverage whole-genome 
sequencing14 (Supplemental Table 1). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a 
single significant QTL at genome-wide significance that accounted for 34.9% of the total 
variance between the RILs, roam-1 (Figure 2C). Covariate analysis failed to find additional 
QTLs that were either additive or interactive with roam-1 (Extended Data Figure 4).
The impact of roam-1 on foraging was confirmed by creating near-isogenic lines (NILs) 
with small genetic regions substituted between the strains. NILs in which 2.5 Mb 
surrounding roam-1 were reciprocally exchanged between CX12311 and MY14 were 
intermediate in icas#9-sensitivity compared to the parental strains (Figure 2Di). Depending 
on the direction of the introgression, the major-effect roam-1 locus accounted for 39-46.4% 
of the genetic variance between the two parental strains.
To simplify further mapping, the roam-1 region from MY14 (kyIR139) was crossed into the 
N2 laboratory strain. The resulting NIL (kyIR144, Figure 2Dii) facilitated further mapping 
that localized roam-1 to 182 kb (Figure 2Dii). High-density mapping of 2600 F2 progeny of 
a cross between N2 and the NIL kyIR147 yielded 12 informative recombinants in this 182 
kb region that mapped the roam-1 QTL to 37 Kb on chromosome V (Figure 2Diii, 
Methods).
roam-1 affects the icas#9 receptor SRX-43
The 37 kb roam-1 region contains sixteen protein-coding genes, including five genes that 
encode predicted G protein-coupled chemoreceptors in the srx or str gene families (Figure 
3A). We hypothesized that one or more of the chemoreceptors could be icas#9-receptor(s) 
with reduced activity in MY14, and therefore introduced N2-derived sequences overlapping 
the chemoreceptor genes into the roam-1MY14 NIL strain kyIR163. N2-derived transgenes 
covering srx-43 (bar in 3A) conferred icas#9-sensitivity to roam-1MY14 (Figure 3B), 
whereas transgenes with nonsense mutations disrupting the coding region of srx-43 did not 
(Figure 3B).
The function of srx-43 was examined further by characterizing loss-of-function mutations in 
the endogenous srx-43 gene (Methods). srx-43(lf) mutants were profoundly insensitive to 
icas#9 in both N2 and roam-1MY14 genetic backgrounds (Figure 3C). icas#9 insensitivity in 
the N2 srx-43(lf) mutant was rescued by an N2 srx-43 transgene (Figure 3C). These results

 indicate that srx-43 is necessary for the icas#9 response in both N2 and MY14 strains, and 
essential for the behavioral difference between them.
The activity of the N2 and MY14 srx-43 genes was compared by targeting a single copy of 
srx-43 from each strain to a defined locus using the Mos1 transposase, in an srx-43(lf) 
mutant so that the single-copy transgene was the sole source of srx-43. The N2 srx-43 
genomic region fully rescued the icas#9 response, whereas the MY14 region did not (Figure 
3D). The differential effects of single-copy transgenes indicate that MY14 srx-43 has 
reduced activity compared to N2 srx-43.
Reporter genes with N2 or MY14 srx-43 sequences driving GFP were expressed selectively 
in the ASI sensory neurons (Extended Data Figure 5A), which promote roaming 
behavior8,15. A genomic clone with GFP fused to the C-terminus of the SRX-43 protein was 
enriched in ASI sensory cilia, the site of sensory transduction (Figure 3E). These properties 
suggest that SRX-43 is a chemoreceptor. We investigated effects of icas#9 on ASI activity 
using in vivo calcium imaging, but failed to observe a response. This negative result is 
consistent with studies of dauer formation, where ascarosides regulate gene expression in 
ASI and not acute ASI calcium levels16-19.
To ask whether SRX-43 could be an icas#9 receptor, srx-43 cDNAs were expressed in the 
ASH sensory neurons, which are normally insensitive to ascarosides17 (Extended Data 
Figure 5B), and ascaroside-induced calcium flux was monitored using genetically-encoded 
calcium indicators17,20. ASH neurons expressing SRX-43 responded with calcium transients 
to 10 nM icas#9 but not to other ascarosides or to indole (Figure 3F). Although the MY14 
strain was largely insensitive to icas#9 in foraging assays, MY14 SRX-43 also detected 
icas#9 when expressed in ASH (Extended Data Figure 5C).
A MY14 srx-43 GFP reporter gene was expressed in ASI, but appeared weaker than the N2 
GFP reporter (Extended Data Figure 5A). To ask which sequences distinguished N2 and 
MY14 srx-43 activity, their promoter and coding regions were exchanged and tested as 
Mos1-mediated Single Copy Insertion (MosSCI) srx-43 transgenes. A transgene with the N2 
promoter region and MY14 coding region rescued icas#9 sensitivity in srx-43(lf) mutants 
but the converse did not, localizing the difference to the srx-43 promoter (Figure 3G). 
Quantitative measurements of endogenous srx-43 mRNA levels demonstrated that srx-43 
was expressed at a five-fold lower level in roam-1MY14 than in N2 (Figure 3H). Therefore, 
natural variation in the activity of the srx-43 promoter between N2 and MY14 impacts 
srx-43 gene expression and behavioral sensitivity to icas#9.
Ascarosides promote dauer larva development in part by suppressing transcription of daf-7, 
which is expressed in ASI and encodes a secreted TGF-β-related peptide19. daf-7(lf) mutants 
have reduced levels of roaming, like animals treated with ascarosides7. Expression of a 
daf-7::GFP reporter was significantly reduced by icas#9 treatment, supporting a role for 
daf-7 as a target for icas#9, and animals bearing a daf-7 mutation were less responsive to 
icas#9 than controls (Extended Data Figure 5D,E). icas#9 influenced behavior only after 
several hours of exposure (Extended Data Figure 5F), a delay that is in agreement with slow 
transcriptional regulation in the daf-7 signaling pathway. Together, these results suggest that

 icas#9 acts as a primer pheromone21,22 that regulates foraging via transcription and 
endocrine signaling.
Balancing selection at a foraging QTL
To understand the population genetics of roam-1, we examined the genomic sequence of a 
20 kb region centered around srx-43 in 39 additional wild C. elegans isolates sequenced by 
the Million Mutation project23. Two discrete and highly divergent haplotypes for the roam-1 
region were found, one resembling N2 and present in 34 strains, and the other resembling 
MY14 and present in seven strains with different geographical origins and genetic 
backgrounds (Figure 4A,B, Extended Data Figure 6A). The N2 and MY14 haplotypes 
differed at 2.64% of all positions over the 20 kb srx-43 region, 12 times the genome-wide 
average24. These data derived from Illumina sequencing that can fail to align highly 
divergent sequences; targeted Sanger sequenced revealed that MY14 and N2 actually 
differed at 19.7% of all positions in srx-43 promoter and coding regions (Extended Data 
Figure 6B). A phylogeny constructed for srx-43 and the most closely related genes in C. 
elegans, C. briggsae, and C. remanei confirmed that the divergent srx-43 alleles represent the 
same gene (Extended Data Figure 6C). All seven tested MY14-like strains were relatively 
resistant to icas#9 compared to N2-like strains (Figure 4C). These results suggest that 
naturally occurring icas#9 resistance is associated with a highly divergent roam-1 haplotype 
including srx-43.
The striking allelic divergence of the roam-1 region, combined with the observation that 
most genes in the interval including srx-43 have a low dN/dS ratio (Extended Data Table 1), 
suggests that these alternative haplotypes might be subject to balancing selection. To 
examine this possibility, we analyzed a database of wild strains assembled and sequenced by 
the Andersen lab at Northwestern University (CeNDR – www.elegansvariation.org). The 
MY14 haplotype was present in 21 of the 152 unique strains, and the remainder had the N2 
haplotype. Both haplotypes were found globally: the MY14 haplotype was found in Europe, 
the United States, New Zealand, and Chile. In almost all cases in which individuals with the 
MY14 haplotype were isolated, individuals of the N2 haplotype were isolated from proximal 
environments at the same time, a distribution consistent with balancing selection.
Sequence features of the roam-1 region also matched expectations for a region under 
balancing selection. The region encompassing roam-1 had a relatively high Tajima's D of 
1.01 that is unusual both at the genomic level (<3.4% of bins had a higher value) and in the 
center of chromosome V where srx-43 lies (<3.6% of bins had a higher value). A 
phylogenetic analysis of the 152 strains revealed that the roam-1 haplotype extends 
approximately 30 kb before being disrupted by recombination events (Extended Data Figure 
7). Given the low outcrossing rate in wild C. elegans populations25,26, this short roam-1 
haplotype suggests co-occurrence of both haplotypes within interbreeding populations over 
many generations.
To directly test the possibility that selection could act on roam-1, we designed competition 
experiments to compare the relative fitness of N2 and roam-1MY14 strains. Experiments 
were conducted under high-density conditions to permit the accumulation and detection of 
endogenously produced icas#9, and competition was applied by growing cultures past the

 point of starvation, i.e. with limiting food. The first competition experiments were conducted 
on a standard lawn of OP50 E. coli bacteria with a population founded by 20 N2 and 20 
roam-1MY14 age-matched adults (Figure 5A). These conditions resulted in a growth 
advantage for the N2 genotype over roam-1MY14 in the first cycle of competition that 
continued in subsequent cycles (Figure 5B).
The two tested strains differ in the 182 kb roam-1 region encompassing 81 genes. To ask if 
the competitive advantage required srx-43, the experiment was repeated using N2 srx-43(lf) 
and roam-1MY14 srx-43(lf) strains. The competitive N2 advantage disappeared in this 
setting, identifying the icas#9 receptor SRX-43 as essential for the competitive effect (Figure 
5C).
The role of endogenous pheromones was assessed by repeating the competition experiments 
with N2 and roam-1MY14 strains mutant for the gene daf-22, which is required for the 
secretion of ascarosides including icas#9. daf-22 mutations eliminated the competitive 
advantage of the N2 strain over roam-1MY14 (Figure 5D). A competitive advantage of N2 
daf-22 was partially recovered in the presence of exogenous 10 nM icas#9 (Figure 5D). 
These results show that selection on the roam-1 locus depends on pheromones.
The increased roaming of roam-1MY14 at high density might be expected to cause greater 
exploration of a patchy food environment. In a second competition design, 20 N2 and 20 
roam-1MY14 adults were used to seed a patchy environment consisting of 16 small bacterial 
lawns (Figure 5A). In these conditions the N2 advantage was lost, and instead a moderate 
but significant selection favored roam-1MY14 over N2 animals (Figure 5E). Together, these 
results demonstrate that roam-1 can affect fitness bidirectionally depending on srx-43, 
pheromone production, and food distribution.
DISCUSSION
Conspecific individuals are informative elements of an animal's natural environment, in part 
because they compete for resources. Our results demonstrate that conspecific pheromones 
alter long-term foraging strategies, and that natural variation in this behavior stems from 
altered expression of the icas#9 receptor SRX-43. The complement of ascarosides produced 
by C. elegans varies with sex, age, and feeding status27,28, and the specificity of receptors 
such as SRX-43 provides a mechanism by which this information can be detected by the 
nervous system to regulate different behaviors and physiological responses. srx-43 is 
expressed in ASI sensory neurons, which are also targets of internal neuromodulators that 
regulate roaming and dwelling8, providing a site of integration of internal and external 
influences on foraging behavior. Although we do not know the suite of pheromones that are 
produced by C. elegans in the wild, the presence of secreted icas#9 in dense culture 
supernatants at concentrations 100-fold above those that suppress roaming suggest that it is a 
relevant regulator of foraging, and that altered sensitivity to this molecule could affect 
animals’ overall sensitivity to secreted ascarosides.
The roam-1 QTL that encompasses srx-43 has sequence features of an area under balancing 
selection. While srx-43 is an essential component of roam-1, it may not be the only gene in

 this QTL or the only gene under balancing selection, as the haplotype extends for ~30 kb to 
include several other genes. Moreover, the behavior identified here need not be the most 
important one in natural settings; it may represent one of several behavioral and 
physiological responses that facilitate adaptation to different environments. Balancing 
selection may be fairly common throughout the C. elegans genome: a recent report identified 
61 highly divergent regions likely to be under balancing selection that segregate among wild 
strains of C. elegans, including a second region 200 kb from roam-124,29(Extended Data 
Figure 8). The composition of these regions is biased toward particular gene classes 
including chemoreceptors, which may act as hotspots of evolution.
At a conceptual level, behavioral genetics in animals including humans is dominated by 
evidence for gene-environment interactions30,31. Our results take this abstraction to a 
concrete level, showing that natural trait variation acts explicitly at the intersection of innate 
circuits and environment cues, with genetic changes allowing differential incorporation of 
environmental information into innate foraging behaviors.
METHODS
Nematode Culture
All strains were grown at 21-22°C on nematode growth medium plates seeded with 
Escherichia coli OP50 bacteria32. For OP50 cultures a single colony was inoculated into 100 
ml of LB and grown for 48 hours at 21-22°C. Transgenic lines were generated by standard 
injection methods, and included the desired transgene, a fluorescent co-injection marker, and 
empty vector bringing the total DNA concentration up to 100 ng/ul. For each transgene, 
three independent extrachromosomal lines that propagated the transgene at high rates were 
tested in parallel to account for variability typical of such strains. All mutagenized strains 
were backcrossed 5-7 times before characterization.

Behavioral Analysis
Exploration assays8 were conducted on 35 mm Petri dishes evenly seeded with 100 μl of 
OP50 bacteria 24 hours before the start of the assay. Individual two-day old L4 
hermaphrodites were picked to the center of the plate. After 16 hours, plates were placed on 
a grid containing 35 mm squares, and the number of full or partial squares containing tracks 
were quantified by an investigator blind to the genotype. Pheromones or control solvent 
were mixed into the agar. A pheromone response for each animal on an ascaroside plate was 
determined with respect to the behavior of control animals that were tested on ascaroside-
free plates on the same day.
Individual pheromone response = (mean # squares entered by controls tested on the same 
day) – (# squares entered by test animal).

 Group pheromone response = mean pheromone response of all individuals tested across 
days. For statistical analysis, n = total number of animals in the group.
N2-derived strains were tested in 21% oxygen (Figures 1,2dii,iii, 3,5. Extended Data Figures 
1,5). All naturally isolated strains and CX12311-derived strains bearing ancestral alleles of 
npr-1 and glb-5 were tested in 8% oxygen to suppress the oxygen-dependent roaming 
behavior of ancestral npr-1 alleles12,34 (Figures 2a,b,di,4, Extended Data Figure 2),
Direct examination of roaming and dwelling was modified from Flavell et al 20138. 14.5 
hours before testing, 25 L4 larvae were picked to 150 mm test plates thinly seeded with 1.5 
mL of OP50 bacteria with or without synthetic pheromone. Video recording was conducted 
under red light to minimize behavioral response to imaging conditions. 1.5 hour-long videos 
were recorded at 3 frames/s using Streampix software (Norpix Inc., Montreal, CA) and a 
6.6MP PL-B781F CMOS camera (PixeLINK, Ottawa, CA). Custom Matlab scripts8 were 
employed to determine worm trajectories and conduct a two-state hidden Markov model 
determining the most probable state path for each animal and thereby measure roaming and 
dwelling state durations.
The low basal exploration rate in daf-7(lf) mutants7 prevented a direct assessment of the 
effect of icas#9 on foraging behavior. Instead, we examined daf-7 daf-3 double mutants, as 
daf-7 canonically acts by antagonizing daf-3, which encodes a co-SMAD transcriptional 
regulator. daf-3 mutations suppressed the low basal exploration rate of daf-7 mutants. N2 
daf-7(lf) daf-3(lf) animals explored control plates moderately more than wild-type, so larger 
(10 cm) exploration assay plates were used to score these strains.
Statistics
Most experiments were repeated on three separate days. For exploration assays, the standard 
group size on a single day was 6; this ensured sufficient power to detect moderate effects, 
while also limiting the influence of daily variation. All plates with a healthy adult animal at 
the end of the assay were scored and included in the analysis. Randomization was ensured 
using the following or similar approach: at the start of each exploration assay, 6 animals 
were placed on a pick at a time, and in the order the animals came off the pick, they were 
then transferred individually to three control plates and then to three icas#9 plates. Assays 
were scored by an experimenter blind to the condition or genotype.
Most statistical comparisons were done by ANOVA with Dunnett correction for multiple 
comparisons or (two-sided) t-test, as noted in the figure legends. The normality of the data 
was tested with D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus test. Bartlett's test was used to check for 
differences in variance between groups being statistically compared. N2 groups in 3C and 
3K did not pass normality test. As the n was large (>15), ANOVA was still an appropriate 
test. Moreover, the findings were still significant when a nonparametric test was used 
(Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn multiple comparison test).
Ascaroside Quantification
150 mL unsynchronized worm cultures were grown for 9 d and fed E. coli (HB101 or 
OP50), as described27. Extracts were generated from the culture medium and analyzed by 
Greene et al.

 LC-MS/MS, as described27, and analyzed on a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Access 
MAX, with the collision gas pressure set to 1 mTorr. Ascaroside concentrations present in 
the culture were quantified using the corresponding synthetic standards, except that synthetic 
ascr#18 was used to quantify ascr#22 and ascr#26, and synthetic icas#3 was used to quantify 
icas#1 and icas#10.
Recombinant Inbred Lines
The MY14-CX12311 recombinant inbred lines were generated by crossing MY14 males to 
CX12311 hermaphrodites and CX12311 males to MY14 hermaphrodites, to ensure the 
mitochondrial DNA from both strains were equally represented in the RILs. 94 F2 were 
individually picked to plates and inbred through self-fertilization for 10 generations. RIL 
genotyping was conducted by low-coverage shotgun sequencing14. Genomic DNA was 
fragmented and attached to sequencing adapters with a Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit 
(Illumina, San Diego, USA). Samples were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 
2000. Sequencing reads from each strain were mapped to the WS235 release of the C. 
elegans genome using bwa to create bamfiles for further analysis35. The set of MY14/N2 
SNVs identified in the Million Mutation project were used for genotyping purposes23. Each 
genetic variant was genotyped in each strain. Due to the low coverage, the majority of SNVs 
were not genotyped. To improve the data coverage, we grouped 200 neighboring SNV 
genotypes together to create a consensus genotype for 540 bins (either N2, MY14 or 
heterozygous). These genotypes were used for QTL mapping.
QTL Mapping
The pheromone response index was used as the phenotype in combination with the 540 
genotype bins from above. R/qtl was used to perform a one-dimensional scan using marker 
regression on all 540 markers. The significance threshold was determined using 1000 
permutation tests. The effect-size of the roam-1 locus was estimated using the fitqtl function 
with a single QTL. The peak of the roam-1 locus (Chromosome V: 16451686-16579457) 
was used as an additive and interactive covariate for additional one-dimensional scans, 
assuming a normal model. The significance threshold for these two tests was also 
determined using 1000 permutation tests.
NIL Mapping
Before the detailed QTL mapping by sequencing described above, the roam-1 QTL was 
localized to 2.5 Mb (V:14.3-16.8 Mb) by examining 14 high-confidence phenotypically 
extreme RILs (Supplemental Table 1). This result, which was confirmed by the full analysis, 
guided the initial generation of NILs.
kyIR142 was made by backcrossing the RIL CX14816 nine times to MY14, maintaining N2 
alleles at V:14.3 and V:16.8 Mb at each generation.
kyIR139 was made by backcrossing the RIL CX14708 nine times to CX12311, maintaining 
MY14 alleles at V:14.3 and V:16.8 Mb.

 kyIR144 was made by crossing kyIR139 with N2 and isolating recombinants with the N2 
allele of glb-5 (V:5.56 Mb), the MY14 alleles at V:14.3 and 16.8 Mb, and the N2 allele of 
npr-1 on X.
kyIR147 and kyIR153 were created by crossing kyIR144 with N2 and identifying progeny 
with the N2 allele at V:14.3 Mb and the MY14 allele at V:16.8 Mb.
High Density Recombination Mapping
kyIR147 was crossed with males from CX16290, a N2 strain with an integrated fluorescent 
marker at V:15.83 Mb. F1 progeny were identified by fluorescence, picked to growth plates, 
and allowed to lay eggs for 12 hours. Following 3 days of growth, ~2600 nonfluorescent F2 
were sorted individually into wells of 96-well plates by a worm sorter (COPAS biosort 
systems; Union Biometrica). These F2 were grown in 200 ul of S-basal buffer + cholesterol 
supplemented with OP50 bacteria. A fraction of the F3 progeny from each isolate were lysed 
and genotyped at V:16.043 Mb. Those with an N2 allele at V:16.043 Mb were genotyped at 
V:15.861 Mb. Twelve recombinants with an N2 allele at V:16.043 Mb and a MY14 allele at 
V:15.861 Mb were isolated and characterized behaviorally, among which were kyIR163 and 
kyIR157 (Figure 2Diii). The N2 NIL with kyIR163 (182 kb of MY14 sequence) is referred 
to as roam-1MY14.
Imaging
Calcium imaging experiments were performed and analyzed as described36. Briefly, young 
adult animals were placed into custom-made 3×3 mm microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane 
devices that permit rapid changes in stimulus solution. Each device contains two arenas, 
allowing for simultaneous imaging of two genotypes with approximately ten animals each. 
Animals were transferred to the arenas in S-Basal buffer and paralyzed for 80-100 minutes 
in 1 mM (−)-tetramisole hydrochloride. Experiments consisted of four 10 s pulses of 
stimulus separated by 30 seconds of buffer, with 60 additional seconds between stimulus 
types. Tiff stacks were acquired at 10 frames/second at 5x magnification (Hamamatsu Orca 
Flash 4 sCMOS), with 10 ms pulsed illumination every 100 ms (Sola, Lumencor; 470/40 nm 
excitation).
Fluorescence levels were analyzed using a custom ImageJ script that integrates and 
background-subtracts fluorescence levels of the ASH cell body (4×4 pixel ROI). Using 
MATLAB, the calcium responses were normalized for each stimulus type by dividing 
fluorescence levels by the baseline fluorescence, defined as the average fluorescence of the 
10 s preceding the first pulse of the stimulus. Each experiment was performed a total of four 
times over two separate days. Animals of a given strain were pooled together to calculate 
population mean and standard error (N2 srx-43 allele: 23 animals; MY14 srx-43 allele: 30 
animals; array negative control: 19 animals). Experiments were conducted on two days.
For GFP expression studies, live adult animals were mounted on 2% agarose pads containing 
5 mM sodium azide. Images were collected with a 100X objective on a Zeiss Axio 
Imager.Z1 Apotome microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm CCD camera. For daf-7 
reporter studies, expression was quantified 16-24 hours after L4 animals were placed on 
exploration assay plates. Images were processed in Metamorph and ImageJ to generate a

 maximum intensity Z-projection. Reporter values were assessed as the mean gray value for a 
16-pixel-radius circle centered over the cell body minus the mean background intensity. 
Both ASI neurons were analyzed in each animal; experiments were performed on three days.
Digital PCR
Digital PCR was conducted on a QuantStudio™ 3D digital PCR platform (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Inc., New York, USA), and analyzed on the QuantStudio™ 3D AnalysisSuite 
Cloud. srx-43 mRNA expression studies were conducted on synchronized L4 worms 48 
hours after laying. RNA was collected on RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen, Hilden, DE) and 
treated with DNAse (Qiagen). SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) was used to create cDNA libraries. Custom TaqMan Expression Assays (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) were used for srx-43 quantification, and the tubulin gene, tbb-1, was used 
for normalization of digital PCR.
For quantitative analysis of the competition experiments, DNA was extracted with a standard 
phenol-chloroform protocol. Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) were used to determine the relative ratio of N2 versus roam-1MY14 DNA by 
digital PCR. The assay was validated with known ratios of N2 to roam-1MY14 DNA 
(Extended Data Figure 9).
Population Genetics
To create the gene and organism phylogenies, we used SNV data downloaded from the 
Million Mutation project (http://genome.sfu.ca/mmp/) or the CeNDR resource (http://
www.elegansvariation.org). For the CeNDR dataset, MY14 was assumed to be clonal or 
near-clonal with MY23, as was suggested by RAD sequencing. Software was written in 
Python using the Biopython module to create a neighbor joining tree. For the roam-1 locus, 
SNVs on Chromosome V between 16,010,000 and 16,030,000 were used. For the glc-1 
locus, SNVs on Chromosome V between 16,181,000 and 16,222,000 were used. All SNVs 
were used to construct the whole genome strain tree. Number of genetic variants and 
Tajima's D were calculated on 5 kb bins using vcftools37. dN/dS was calculated by counting 
using custom Python scripts analyzing variants between MY23 and the N2 reference. 
Phylogenies of srx-43 and closely related genes were performed using protein sequences 
from Thomas and Robertson, 200838.
Fitness Assays
Competition experiments consisted of three boom-bust cycles. During the boom phase, 
population growth led to rapid depletion of food, initiating the bust phase, which lasted for 
two days. Simple lawn competition experiments were conducted on 100 mm NGM agar 
plates with a single lawn formed from 800 μl of saturated OP50 culture. Patchy lawn 
competition experiments were conducted on 150 mm NGM agar plates with a 200 μl ring-
shaped OP50 lawn in the center of the plate surrounded by 15 small 40 μl lawns (Figure 
5A); at the assay start and at transfers animals were placed in the center of the plate.
Populations were initiated from 20 N2-type and 20 roam-1MY14-type age-synchronized 
young adult animals. The initial population depleted food within 4 days, and on day 6

 animals were washed into M9 media, 20% of the suspension was transferred to a new plate, 
and the remainder was lysed for quantitative DNA analysis. For the second and third boom 
bust cycle, food resources were depleted in 2 days and the plates were kept starved for 2 
additional days. Following the second bust phase 20% of the animals were transferred to a 
new plate, and following the third bust phase the entire population was harvested for DNA 
extraction.

 Extended Data Figure 6. Alternative roam-1 allele have high sequence variability
a) The roam-1 QTL region (top). roam-1 SNPs = SNPs with respect to the N2 reference 
genome that are shared by JU360, MY2, MY14, ED3021, JU1171, MY16, and MY6 and not 
by any other strains, according to the Million Mutation Project, defining the roam-1MY14 
haplotype. Other SNPs = all other SNPs with respect to the N2 reference genome found in 
any of the 40 wild isolates in the Million Mutation Project.
b) Polymorphisms revealed by Sanger sequencing of srx-43 promoter and coding region. 
Despite the high rate of polymorphism, there are only 4 nonsynonymous mutations in the 
MY14 coding sequence. We confirmed that the MY14 and N2 sequences are alleles of the 
same gene by examining sequence reads of the MY14-like strain MY23 in the CeNDR 
dataset (www.elegansvariation.org) and aligning each read to N2 and MY14 sequence for 
the srx-43 region as determined by Sanger sequencing. 7272 of the MY23(MY14) reads 
better matched the MY14 Sanger sequence and 4 of the reads better matched the N2 
reference sequence, as expected if MY14 and N2 each bear one alternative allele of the gene.
c) Phylogeny constructed for srx-43 and related genes in C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C. 
remanei demonstrates that the srx-43 alleles in N2 and MY14 are closely related alleles of a 
single gene. Genes are color coded by species (green = C. elegans, blue = C. briggsae, 
orange = C. remanei). Protein sequences and gene names are from Thomas and Robertson, 
200838.

a) The glc-1 gene has previously been shown to be under balancing selection33, and is near 
srx-43. The blue line shows SNPs/kb for N2 and MY14 averaged over 5 kb intervals for the 
region spanning srx-43 and glc-1. The large region of low heterozygosity between srx-43 
and glc-1 indicates that balancing selection on glc-1 is unlikely to account for the high 
heterozygosity near srx-43.
