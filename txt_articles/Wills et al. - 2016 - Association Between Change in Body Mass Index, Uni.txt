Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by 
height in meters squared) is associated with improved survival among persons with Huntington 
disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Weight loss is common among persons with Parkinson 
disease (PD) and is associated with worse quality of life.
OBJECTIVE—To explore the association between change in BMI, Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and total scores, and survival among persons with PD and to test 
whether there is a positive association between BMI at randomization and survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Secondary analysis (from May 27, 2014, to 
October 13, 2015) of longitudinal data (3–6 years) from 1673 participants who started the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-
PD LS-1). This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine 
monohydrate (10 g/d) that was performed at 45 sites throughout the United States and Canada. 
Participants with early (within 5 years of diagnosis) and treated (receiving dopaminergic therapy) 
PD were enrolled from March 2007 to May 2010 and followed up until September 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Change across time in motor UPDRS score, change 
across time in total UPDRS score, and time to death. Generalized linear mixed models were used 
to estimate the effect of BMI on the change in motor and total UPDRS scores after controlling for 
covariates. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models of time to death. A 
participant’s BMI was measured at randomization, and BMI trajectory groups were classified 
according to whether participants experienced weight loss (“decreasing BMI”), weight stability 
(“stable BMI”), or weight gain (“increasing BMI”) during the study.
RESULTS—Of the 1673 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [9.6] years; 1074 [64.2%] were 
male), 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss (decreasing BMI), whereas 233 (13.9%) experienced 
weight gain (increasing BMI). After adjusting for covariates, we found that the weight-loss 
group’s mean (SE) motor UPDRS score increased by 1.48 (0.28) (P < .001) more points per visit 
than the weight-stable group’s mean (SE) motor UPDRS score. The weight-gain group’s mean 
(SE) motor UPDRS score decreased by −0.51 (0.24) (P = .03) points per visit, relative to the

 weight-stable group. While there was an unadjusted difference in survival between the 3 BMI 
trajectory groups (log-rank P < .001), this was not significant after adjusting for covariates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Change in BMI was inversely associated with change in 
motor and total UPDRS scores in the NET-PD LS-1. Change in BMI was not associated with 
survival; however, these results were limited by the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00449865
Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in 
meters squared) has been found to be associated with improved survival in several 
neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis.1–5 However, to our knowledge, its effect on Parkinson disease (PD) progression 
and survival has not been previously examined. Midlife obesity has been associated with 
later PD risk in several studies6,7 although not others.8,9 At the same time, patients with PD 
are consistently reported to be underweight compared with healthy controls.10 This 
discrepancy is likely due to premorbid weight loss, which begins years prior to the diagnosis 
of PD.9,11 Weight loss is common among persons with PD and may be related to the effects 
of dopaminergic medications on appetite12 or to a combination of other factors, including 
hyposmia, difficulty self-feeding, dysphagia, intestinal hypomotility, depression, anorexia, 
nausea, and increased energy requirements due to rigidity, dyskinesia, and tremors.13 
Although an abnormally low BMI (<20) has been shown to be a risk factor for fractures 
among persons with PD,14,15 to our knowledge, the effects of changes in body mass on 
changes in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score and survival have 
not previously been studied. A recent study16 using the National Parkinson Foundation 
Quality Improvement Initiative database found that weight loss was associated with a more 
rapid decline in health-related quality of life. In this secondary analysis of data from the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Exploratory Trials in PD 
Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1), we examined the effects of BMI at randomization and 
change in BMI across time in 3 outcomes: (1) change in the UPDRS part III (hereafter 
referred to as the motor UPDRS score), (2) change in the UPDRS parts I, II, and III 
(hereafter referred to as the total UPDRS score), and (3) PD survival.
Methods
Participants
The NET-PDLS-1 was a large, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial of creatine monohydrate (10 g/d). Participants had early, treated PD (within 5 years of 
diagnosis and between 90 days to a maximum 2 years of starting dopaminergic therapy). 
The study design and characteristics at randomization of this clinical trial have been 
previously published.17 A total of 1741 participants were enrolled (from March 2007 to May 
2010 and followed up until September 2013). Participants were scheduled for measurements 
at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 months after randomization.17 Follow-up time was 
defined as the time between the randomization study visit and the loss to follow-up, death, 
or July 17, 2013, when the clinical trial was terminated early.18 The institutional review 
boards of the institutions that participated in the NET-PD LS-1 approved the study, the study

 protocol, and the informed consent process and documentation. All patients provided written 
informed consent.
Of the 1741 participants, 1673 were included in this analysis. The reasons for exclusion 
were as follows: 38 participants reported their height and weight at randomization and not 
across time (no trajectory feasible to estimate); 4 participants had no height and weight 
recorded; 2 participants did not have a height and weight recorded at randomization; 9 
participants did not have the UPDRS scores measured at randomization; 7 participants were 
missing uric acid levels; 5 participants were missing their Beck Depression Inventory II 
score; 1 participant was missing data on the history of cardiovascular disease status at 
randomization; 1 participant was missing data on his or her history of dyskinesia at 
randomization; and 1 participant was missing data on his or her history of dysphagia or 
bulbar dysfunction at randomization. Given the minimal amount of data that was missing 
(from 68 of 1741 participants [3.9%]), the reduced sample was considered to be missing at 
random and to be representative of the observed data.19
Key Points
Question
What is the association of body mass index (BMI) with change in Unified Parkinson’s 
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and survival?
Findings
In this secondary analysis of longitudinal data from participants with early Parkinson 
disease (PD) in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory 
Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1), participants with a decreasing BMI had 
higher motor and total UPDRS scores over time, whereas participants with an increasing 
BMI had lower motor and total UPDRS scores, compared with participants with a stable 
BMI. Change in BMI was not associated with survival; however, there were few deaths in 
the NET-PD LS-1.
Meaning
Change in BMI is an important clinical feature that should be followed even in early PD.
Outcome Measures
This analysis focused on 3 separate outcome measures: (1) change across time from 
randomization in the motor UPDRS score, (2) change across time in the total UPDRS score, 
and (3) time to death.
Exposure
Bodyweight was measured at randomization and at every follow-up visit for each 
participant. Participants’ heights were measured at randomization and assumed to be 
constant across time to calculate BMI. The primary exposure variables were BMI at 
randomization and the classification of the change in BMI across time. Participants were 
classified into 3 trajectory groups according to their change in BMI. That is, the change in

 BMI from each visit to randomization, longitudinally, was used to fit a semiparametric 
group-based model with continuous multivariate density functions under a censored normal 
model.20,21 We sought to identify participants who had experienced weight loss (“decreasing 
BMI”), weight stability (“stable BMI”), or weight gain (“increasing BMI”) during the study.
Covariate Variables
Because randomization took place blocked by site, both site and treatment assignments 
(creatine vs placebo) were included as covariates. For outcomes 1 and 2, the following 
covariates were included based on a hypothesized association between the outcomes and the 
exposure: age, the interaction between visit and age, disease duration, and sex, and the 
following variables were included at randomization: UPDRS score, presence of monoamine 
oxidase B inhibitors, presence of catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors, use of amantadine 
hydrochloride, use of anticholinergics, use of other adjunctive medications, uric acid levels, 
Beck Depression Inventory II total score, and presence of dysphagia or bulbar dysfunction 
reported in the diagnostic features form. Adyskinesia score (sum of questions 1–3 from 
UPDRS part IV) at randomization was calculated. The total levodopa equivalent daily dose 
and the type of symptomatic PD medications (ie, levodopa, dopamine agonist, or >1 type of 
dopaminergic therapy) at randomization were also included as covariates. For outcome 3, 
given the low number of deaths (n = 76) included in this secondary analysis, we limited our 
analysis to the following variables at randomization: age, sex, total UPDRS score at 
randomization, history of cardiovascular disease, and disease duration.
Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and percentages) were used to summarize 
the demographic and clinical characteristics of participants at randomization. The Bayesian 
information criterion was used to determine that 3 trajectory groups with a change in BMI 
across time had a better fit than 4 groups (data not shown). These BMI trajectory groups 
were tested for constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic trends, and the cubic trend was 
preferred (P < .001). The sample size for each group and the unadjusted mean values (and 
their corresponding 95% CIs) of the change in the motor and total UPDRS scores from each 
visit to the randomization visit were reported for each BMI trajectory group. The average 
weight change was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model, via the maximum 
likelihood method, for each trajectory group, controlling for age, visit, the interaction 
between visit and age, treatment assignment, site, and the interaction between BMI 
trajectory group and visit. Treatment assignment and site were included as random effects.
Following the recommendations of the National Research Council of the National 
Academies for analyzing clinical trials,22 we imputed the worst motor and total UPDRS 
scores for any visit after the death of participants in the trial to be 108 and 176, respectively. 
Generalized linear mixed-effects models using the residual maximum likelihood method for 
the change in the motor UPDRS score were performed for each potential covariate 
separately, as well as with age, the interaction between visit and age, treatment assignment, 
and site. The interaction between uric acid level and sex was also evaluated in univariate 
models. Covariates with P < .20 were included in the final multivariable model for the motor 
UPDRS score. Given that BMI at randomization and the trajectory groups were our

 exposure of interest, they were included in the multivariable model regardless of their P 
values. Finally, to evaluate the effect of the BMI trajectory groups by visit, the interaction 
term was included in the multivariable model. We applied the same modeling strategy to the 
total UPDRS score.
Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, including BMI, BMI 
trajectory groups, and the previously mentioned covariates. The log-rank test was used to 
evaluate differences between the BMI trajectory groups without adjustment for covariates. 
The α level is the size of the type I error, which was defined as .05 to evaluate significance. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS 
Institute Inc).
Results
Table 1 shows the overall demographic characteristics at randomization of the subset of 
participants used in this analysis and by the BMI trajectory groups, including the 
percentages of participants distributed by World Health Organization BMI criteria. Few 
participants reported dysphagia or were underweight at randomization (defined as BMI < 
18.5). Surprisingly, 65.3% of participants reported a history of cardiovascular disease at 
randomization. However, based on the predetermined categorization of medical history, this 
included participants with hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Very few participants reported 
dysphagia symptoms at randomization.
In the trajectory analysis, of the 1673 participants, 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss 
(decreasing BMI), 1282 (76.6%) experienced weight stability (stable BMI), and 233 (13.9%) 
experienced weight gain (increasing BMI). There was no imbalance in treatment assignment 
(creatine vs placebo) between the 3 trajectory groups. The decreasing-BMI group had more 
participants classified as obese at randomization, had a higher percentage of participants 
who received levodopa only, and had a higher mean levodopa daily dose equivalence at 
randomization. There was no imbalance in the other baseline characteristics.
Figure 1 shows the unadjusted mean change in the motor and total UPDRS scores and their 
corresponding 95% CIs and sample size by BMI trajectory group across visits. After 
adjusting for all of the previously mentioned covariates, we found that the participants with a 
decreasing BMI experienced a mean (SE) increase of 1.48 (0.28) more points per visit in the 
motor UPDRS score than participants with a stable BMI (Table 2; P < .001). Similarly, 
participants with a decreasing BMI experienced a mean (SE) increase of 2.40 (0.43)more 
points per visit in the total UPDRS score than participants with a stable BMI (P < .001). 
Participants with an increasing BMI experienced a mean (SE) decrease of −0.51 (0.24) (P = .
03) points in the motor UPDRS and a mean (SE) decrease of −0.89 (0.36) (P = .02) points in 
the total UPDRS compared with participants with a stable BMI. By contrast, BMI at 
randomization was not significantly associated with the change in motor or total UPDRS 
scores.
We then explored the effect of BMI at randomization and the change in BMI on survival. 
There were no differences in the causes of the reported deaths between this subset of

 participants (1673 participants) and the total number of participants in the NET-PD LS-118 
(1741 participants): 24 (31.6%) of the 76 deaths were due to cardiac issues, 15 (19.7%) were 
due to an unknown cause, 11 (14.5%) were due to cancer, 9 (11.8%) were due to infections, 
and 17 (22.4%) were due to other causes. The Kaplan-Meier curve for survival stratified by 
the BMI trajectory groups is shown in Figure 2. There were statistically significant 
differences in survival among these groups (log-rank P < .001). However, in the 
multivariable analysis, the effect of the BMI trajectory groups was no longer significant. 
Table 3 displays the hazard ratios, 95% CIs, and corresponding P values for the Cox 
proportional hazards model.
Discussion
In summary, classification in the decreasing-BMI trajectory group was associated with 
higher (worse) scores over time in both the motor and total UPDRS, whereas classification 
in the increasing-BMI trajectory group was associated with lower (better) UPDRS scores in 
the NET-PD LS-1. This was observed in early PD despite theoretically optimal treatment 
with dopaminergic therapy. Although this does not imply causation, our results suggest that 
weight and BMI are important clinical biomarkers and that data on weight and BMI should 
be collected even in early PD. Our analysis of the BMI trajectory groups appears to have 
identified a subtype of PD associated with both decreasing BMI and higher increases in 
motor and total UPDRS scores. This subtype might represent a more severe, hyper-
metabolic form of PD,23–26 or it might be a subtype of PD in which the patient has greater 
gastrointestinal autonomic symptoms, reduced appetite, and reduced oral intake. Dietary 
intake was not measured in the NET-PD LS1, and therefore we do not know whether weight 
gain or weight loss was due to changes in oral intake. Because the increasing-BMI group 
also experienced a relative decrease in UPDRS scores over time compared with the stable-
BMI group, the association of change in BMI with change in UPDRS score cannot be fully 
explained by other comorbid conditions associated with weight loss.
While more of the decreasing-BMI group were taking levodopa only at randomization and 
were prescribed a higher mean levodopa daily dose equivalence at randomization, our 
models adjusted for these variables. One caveat to our study is that we only adjusted for total 
levodopa daily dose equivalence at randomization; thus, participants in the decreasing-BMI 
group may have been less able to tolerate increases in total levodopa daily dose equivalence 
across time.
We were surprised to find that most participants were in the stable-BMI group and that more 
participants were in the increasing-BMI group than in the decreasing-BMI group. This 
reflects the early stage of participants in the NET-PD LS1. These unexpected results also 
suggest the need for further study of weight changes in PD. We were also surprised that uric 
acid levels at randomization were not associated with a change in motor or total UPDRS 
scores, despite its strong association in other studies27,28 (data not shown).
While not significant, the direction of the hazard ratios for the increasing-BMI and 
decreasing-BMI groups in the survival analysis were also consistent with the UPDRS 
results, which suggests that increasing BMI is associated with better disease outcomes. Our

 study was limited by the fact that there were very few deaths in this clinical trial, decreasing 
our power in the proportional hazards model. This was due to the design of the NET-PD 
LS-1, which enrolled participants at an early stage of the disease. Future analyses using 
clinical trials of longer duration may be helpful in elucidating the association of BMI with 
survival.
Conclusions
Change in BMI was inversely associated with change in motor and total UPDRS scores in 
the NET-PD LS-1, with the decreasing-BMI trajectory group experiencing increased motor 
and total UPDRS scores over time compared with the stable-BMI group, despite optimal 
treatment. Participants in the increasing-BMI group also experienced a relative decrease in 
motor and total UPDRS scores. Change in BMI was not associated with survival; however, 
our results were limited by the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1.

 Figure 1. Change in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) by Body Mass Index 
(BMI) Trajectory Groups
A, After adjusting for covariates, we found that the change in the motor UPDRS score 
between decreasing BMI and stable BMI was P < .001 and that the change in the motor 
UPDRS score between stable BMI and increasing BMI was P = .03. B, After adjusting for 
covariates, we found that the change in the total UPDRS score between decreasing BMI and 
stable BMI was P < .001 and that the change in the total UPDRS score between stable BMI 
and increasing BMI was P = .02. Error bars indicate 95% CIs.
