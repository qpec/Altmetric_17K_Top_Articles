Abstract
Background
Antenatal corticosteroid therapy (ACT) is used clinically to prepare the fetal lung for impend-
ing preterm birth, but animal and human studies link corticosteroids to smaller birth size.
Whether ACT is associated with birth size is debated; therefore, we assessed differences in
birth size in treated versus untreated pregnancies.
Methods and findings
This observational register-based study used data from the Finnish Medical Birth Register
(FMBR) covering all births in Finland (January 1, 2006–December 31, 2010). We used
unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses as well as propensity score matching (PSM)
to analyze whether birth size differed by ACT exposure. PSM provides a stringent compari-
son, as subsamples were created matched on baseline and medical characteristics
between treated and untreated women. All analyses were stratified by timing of birth. The
primary study outcome was birth size: birth weight (BWT), birth length (BL), ponderal index
(PI), and head circumference (HC) measured immediately after birth and recorded in the
FMBR. Additional analyses explored indicators of neonatal health in relation to ACT expo-
sure and birth size. A total of 278,508 live-born singleton births with �24 gestational com-
pleted weeks were registered in the FMBR during the 5-year study period. Over 4% of
infants were born preterm, and 4,887 women were treated with ACT (1.75%). More than
44% of the exposed infants (n = 2,173) were born at term. First, results of unadjusted regres-
sion analyses using the entire sample showed the greatest reductions in BWT as compared

232.90 g (±SE 17.24, P < .001), near term −171.50 g (±SE 17.52, P < .001), and at term −-
101.95 g (±SE 10.89, P < .001). Second, using the entire sample, regression analyses
adjusted for baseline and medical conditions showed significant differences in BWT
between exposed and unexposed infants: very preterm −61.54 g (±SE 28.62, P < .03), pre-
term −222.78 g (±SE 19.64, P < .001), near term −159.25 g (±SE 19.14, P < .001), and at
term −91.62 g (±SE 11.86, P < .03). Third, using the stringent PSM analyses based on
matched subsamples, infants exposed to ACT weighed less at birth: −220.18 g (±SE 21.43,
P < .001), −140.68 g (±SE 23.09, P < .001), and −89.38 g (±SE 14.16, P < .001), born pre-
term, near term, and at term, respectively. Similarly, significant reductions in BL and HC
were also observed using the three analytic methods. There were no differences among
postterm infants regardless of analytic method. Likewise, we observed no differences with
respect to PI. Additional analyses showed that exposed and unexposed infants had gener-
ally similar Apgar scores at birth, yet the ACT-treated infants received greater medical care
during the first 7 days of life and beyond. Our study is mainly limited by lack of data in FMBR
specifying the interval between treatment and birth as well as other potential confounders
that could not be tested.
Conclusions
In this study, ACT was consistently associated with reduction in birth size for infants born
preterm, near term, or at term. Further investigation is warranted alongside reevaluation of
guidelines. Efforts need to be made to correctly identify and target patients who will deliver
preterm. Reduced growth should be considered when deliberating early care decisions.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Presently, guidelines recommend one dose, repeated over 24 hours, of antenatal cortico-
steroid therapy (ACT) to accelerate fetal lung maturation in cases of threatened preterm
birth in an effort to reduce infant mortality related to respiratory distress.
• Many exposed infants are born at term and thus exposed unnecessarily to potential
harms of ACT.
• There is persistent concern about the potential risk of ACT to decrease birth size, but
previous results in humans are uncertain.
• Most studies do not use birth size as the primary outcome and do not examine all mea-
surements, i.e., birth weight (BWT), birth length (BL), head circumference (HC), and
ponderal index (PI).

 What did the researchers do and find?
• The entire population of singleton and live-born infants in Finland was studied during a
5-year period (January 1, 2006–December 31, 2010)—in total, 278,508 infants.
• Propensity score was used to generate matched subgroups of ACT-exposed and ACT-
unexposed infants to compare size at birth.
• Exposure to ACT is consistently associated with smaller size at birth including BWT,
BL, and HC among infants born preterm, near term, and at term, but not with PI in pro-
pensity score–matched analyses.
• Deficits in birth size in relation to ACT were greatest for infants born preterm regardless
of analytic strategy.
What do the findings mean?
• There was a clinically significant reduction in birth size among infants exposed to ACT
and born at term—i.e., unnecessarily exposed—as compared to unexposed
counterparts.
• ACT-exposed infants received more medical care than matched unexposed counter-
parts, counter to expectation, suggesting that treated infants’ health was more compro-
mised at birth and required more medical intervention and that the expected
prophylactic effect of ACT was not fully realized.
• Early care decisions need to identify high-risk patients and weigh benefits of ACT
against potential harm of unnecessary exposure.
• These findings provide strong evidence indicating ACT is associated with reduced fetal
growth in humans and provide an agenda for further studies and on par with reexami-
nation of guidelines.
Introduction
Complications arising from preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under
5 years old [1] and a leading cause of morbidity across the life course [2]. Antenatal corticoste-
roid therapy (ACT) accelerates maturation of fetal lung tissue. ACT is used prophylactically
when preterm birth is threatened to reduce risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), asso-
ciated morbidity, and mortality in preterm infants [3]. International guidelines [4–6] recom-
mend that women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery
within 7 days should receive ACT. However, recent reports show that a large portion of
women receive ACT inappropriately [7], with optimal timing of treatment administered in
only 40.8% of patients [8]. Moreover, the estimated number needed to treat with ACT to pre-
vent one case of RDS varies widely [9–10]. As ACT is often initiated before a diagnosis of pre-
term birth is confirmed, and given the uncertainty in predicting parturition, as many as 40%
[7–10] of infants exposed to ACT go on to be delivered at term. These infants would not be

 expected to develop RDS, with or without ACT, but have been exposed to any potential harms
[11–13], thus raising concerns about risks.
ACT may disturb fetal growth [14] and consequently increases risk of disease across the life
course [15–17]. Concern stems from experimental animal models that demonstrate that gluco-
corticoid administration (at clinically bioequivalent doses) impairs fetal growth and develop-
ment of skeletal muscle as well as other organ tissues, which leads to a wide range of
dysfunctions in the cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, nervous, and reproductive systems
in the adult offspring [17]. According to the systematic review focusing on birth size [14], the
evidence in humans for disturbed fetal growth is only suggestive. Firm conclusions could not
be drawn because of the studies’ design limitations, particularly inadequate control for con-
founders [14]. Because of the widespread use of ACT [18], it is especially critical that there is
clear understanding of potential adverse effects related to fetal growth when making early care
decisions. Most available studies have not controlled for relevant factors, are not large enough
to provide robust estimates, or do not use birth size as the primary outcome. Existing evidence
[19] is graded as moderate quality by the World Health Organization.
Our objective was to address previous shortcomings and investigate the association
between ACT exposure and birth size—birth weight (BWT), birth length (BL), ponderal index
(PI), and head circumference (HC)—using data from the nationwide Finnish Medical Birth
Register (FMBR). Because we had complete country data available, we were able to specifically
examine carefully matched pregnancies to address issues of confounding and examine whether
ACT was related to birth size of infants born at term, i.e., who received the prophylactic treat-
ment unnecessarily. Given the very large sample size, we set out to create balanced subgroups
(treated versus untreated) for direct comparison, using propensity score matching (PSM). The
subgroup matching took into account factors influencing ACT treatment. Additional analyses
were conducted to explore whether indices of poor fetal health, potentially precipitating ACT
treatment, were related to growth deficits. We hypothesized that ACT-exposed infants would
be smaller at birth than unexposed infants in one or more of the birth size values.
Methods
Study oversight
The National Institute of Health and Welfare (https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/about-us) in Fin-
land, in accordance with national data protection legislation, authorized the release of the
anonymized data for this register-based study and provided ethical approval. Individual
informed consent was not required, as only deidentified data were used without any additional
patient contact. This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (S1 Checklist).
Study population
We use prospective data registered in FMBR, covering all births within the period January 1,
2006, to December 31, 2010, in Finland. Antenatal care in Finland is tax-paid and offered with-
out fees to all women residing in the country. Standardized information is recorded prospec-
tively during antenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care for all pregnant women and neonates in all
clinics and hospitals in Finland. These data are copied after delivery and sent to FMBR for
archiving. The FMBR includes data on all mothers and their live-born infants and stillbirths
weighing �500 g or with a gestational age of �22 weeks.
The total number of births recorded during the study period was 289,722. We excluded
births <24 gestational weeks, multiple births (because of risk of decreased birth size), and still-
births. Fig 1 shows the entire study population from which we drew the subsample of matched

 participants for the main analysis. Results for the entire sample are presented in the supporting
information.
ACT
ACT administration during the current pregnancy was recorded in FMBR as either received
treatment or not. The recommended treatment consisted of betamethasone 12 mg adminis-
tered twice, 24 hours apart. According to national guidelines, delivery can be postponed
through tocolytic therapy to enable corticosteroid prophylaxis and referral to tertiary hospital,
if necessary.
Birth size
Using a uniform method across Finland, medical staff measure BWT accurate to ±1 g, BL, and
HC in centimeters immediately after birth. We calculated PI using the standard formula
(BWT [kg] / BL [m3]).
Confounding factors
The most important confounder is timing of birth, as the length of gestation directly sets the
limits or opportunity for fetal growth. We therefore examined the impact of ACT on birth size
stratified by the timing of birth: very preterm (gestational weeks 24–29), preterm (30–34), near
term (35–37), at term (38–41), and postterm (�42). Gestational age at birth is recorded in
FMBR as the best estimate including last menstrual period and ultrasound examination.
Women routinely undergo an early-pregnancy ultrasound scan by a specially trained midwife

 at maternity outpatient clinics across the country between 11 + 0 and 13 + 6 weeks of preg-
nancy. This scan is used to date pregnancies and is offered free of charge to all women regis-
tered at the antenatal clinics. Uptake is voluntary, and the majority use the service [20].
The FMBR includes information of clinical relevance on sociodemographics, pregnancy
medical history, and gestational complications, which we used as potential confounders,
depicted in Fig 2 and listed in Table 1. These variables were adjusted for in multiple regression
analyses using the full sample. In the main analysis, the confounders were used to create a pro-
pensity score–matched subset of participants for matched comparison of exposed and unex-
posed infants.
Factors used in additional analyses
We examined the factors available in FMBR that could be used as indicators of neonatal health
to shed light on whether any growth restriction was due to ACT or to poor fetal health, which
would both limit growth and precipitate treatment.
The Apgar score was implemented in 1952 as a quick way to evaluate the physical condition
of the newborn by assessing heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and
color. The Apgar score conducted at 5 minutes after birth has been found to be an excellent
predictor of infant survival in the first 28 days of life and thus considered a meaningful mea-
sure of neonatal health [21].
Neonatal care is recorded in FMBR for the first 7 days of life. We used these data to com-
pare ACT-exposed and ACT-unexposed infants. Data were also available indicating whether
infants were still hospitalized beyond 7 days.

 Lastly, we present in the supporting information results by mode of delivery. Medically
indicated preterm labor reflects a complication with the mother or fetus and occurs mostly
because of preeclampsia, placental abruption or dysfunction, fetal distress, and fetal growth
restriction [22]. In contrast, spontaneous preterm labor starts because of physiologic changes
in the cervix, uterus, or amniotic sac. Causal risk factors associated with spontaneous preterm
birth include intrauterine infections, psychosocial stress, sociodemographic characteristics,
and maternal illness [23]. About 70% of preterm births are considered spontaneous [22–23].
Planned cesarean at term is typical for breech presentation, whereas unplanned or emergency
is common for fetal distress.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were planned a priori and carried out using SAS software, version 9.4
(SAS Institute). Our a priori thinking is depicted in Fig 2, which illustrates the potential causal
pathways in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that guided our work. All models were stratified
by timing of birth. ACT as a single exposure was examined for each of the four birth size out-
comes stratified by five categories of gestational age at birth. Randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) provide firm evidence of causal associations. However, the risk of bias is not
completely eliminated. Analytic strategies in RCTs do not always realistically reflect clinical
complexity or report potential biases. We set out to examine a very large number of pregnan-
cies in order to be able to carry out matched comparisons. The purpose of random assignment
is to equate participants in the treatment and control groups in order to isolate the effective-
ness of treatment. However, outside of an RCT, this equality among participants is not known,
because specific characteristics can predispose individuals to either receive treatment or not.
In such a case, the treatment and control groups are different; thus, the treatment effect cannot
be isolated, and firm conclusions cannot be drawn about the causal effect of treatment. PSM
technique attempts to equate the treatment and control groups after allocation in an observa-
tional study in an effort to produce equal groups. We adopted the propensity score approach
to match participants and minimize the imbalance with regards to the confounding factors.
We match subsamples on all data archived in the FMBR and thus available for analysis in this
study. The two groups (treated versus control) were carefully balanced on baseline characteris-
tics associated with treatment allocation, thereby reducing confounding associated with receipt
of treatment. Our a priori strategy was to conduct stratified unadjusted and adjusted regres-
sion analyses using the entire sample (presented in the supporting material), followed by the
formation of matched subsamples and analysis by stratified regression models using PSM
score (presented as the main results). In this way, we can compare results using two analytic
strategies and are able to ascertain whether any observed differences are driven by bias.
Because all of the background and medical variables recorded in FMBR bear clinical rele-
vance, all were included as confounders, including, e.g., those as identified in previous work
such as cohabitation with expectant father [24–25]. Thus, all available background and medical
factors recorded in FMBR were used. Few missing values are present in the dataset, and in
such cases, pairwise deletions were made. We analyzed the entire cohort using multiple regres-
sions to calculate the association between ACT exposure and birth size (BWT, BL, PI, and HC)
and in the fully adjusted model including all the confounders. We then used the confounders
to generate propensity scores to match ACT patients with controls. ACT patients were
matched to controls on the logit propensity score, using “nearest neighbor matching” [26].
The large sample size permitted a subsample to be generated for analysis consisting of a match-
ing ratio of 5:1, controls to patients, which has been shown to be the optimum matching ratio
[27]. However, because relatively few infants are born very preterm, we used 1:1 matching for

 this stratum. The main analysis comprised direct comparison in the matched samples consist-
ing of 3,077 infants prenatally exposed to ACT (treated) and 11,821 unexposed infants
(control).
Lastly, we performed additional analyses to assess whether potential differences in birth size
could be attributed to poorer health, as indexed by available data, among the exposed versus
unexposed infants. We examined Apgar scores at 5 minutes (additionally stratified by infant
sex, as sex differences have been previously reported), neonatal care, and mode of delivery.
Results
There were 278,508 live-born singleton births recorded in Finland during the study period. Of
these, 11,896 (4.27%) infants were born preterm, 4,887 women were treated with ACT
(1.75%), and 44% of the exposed infants (n = 2,173) were born at term, as shown in Fig 1.
Baseline characteristics of the study population and current medical factors archived in
FMBR are listed in Table 1. These factors were used as the confounders for adjustment in the
regression analyses of the entire sample and used for the propensity score calculation.
Results of unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses using the entire population are pre-
sented in S1 Table. The results showed very consistent deficits in birth size, though estimates
were slightly attenuated in the adjusted models. ACT-exposed infants born very preterm were
lighter by 61 g and shorter by approximately .69 cm. Infants born preterm who had been
exposed to ACT were more than 200 g lighter than unexposed counterparts. These infants also
were significantly shorter and thinner (PI) and had a smaller HC. Near-term and term infants
exposed to ACT were also significantly lighter and smaller, but not thinner, in both unadjusted
and adjusted comparisons. Postterm infants showed no differences in size regardless of ACT
exposure.
Table 2 presents results evaluating birth size differences between ACT exposure and con-
trols by way of PSM subsample analysis. As in the full sample analysis, infants who had been
treated with ACT and born preterm showed the biggest deficits in birth size as compared to
other gestational categories. Preterm infants were 220 g lighter and 1.43 cm shorter, had a .92
cm smaller HC, and were significantly thinner (PI). ACT-exposed infants born near term and
at term, respectively, were significantly lighter (140 g, 89 g) and shorter (.71 cm, .36 cm) and
had smaller HC (.39 cm, .21 cm) but were not thinner. Postterm infants were of similar size
whether ACT treated or not.
Taken together, significant differences were detected by all analytic strategies and for the
birth size measurements we tested, i.e., BWT, BL, and HC. ACT-exposed infants were not
thinner with respect to length—i.e., no consistent differences in PI. The results using the entire
sample were in the same direction as the PSM subsample results, though the reductions in
growth were greater using the complete sample. As compared to controls, ACT-exposed
infants born between gestational weeks 30 and 41 were consistently smaller in birth size
regardless of analytic strategy.
Additional analyses were conducted to assess whether indicators of health at birth differed
by ACT exposure. Table 3 shows that Apgar scores at 5 minutes were somewhat inconsistent
across groups. ACT-exposed and unexposed boys showed no differences in Apgar scores, with
the exception of higher Apgar among unexposed, term-born males. In contrast, there were
some differences in Apgar scores for girls. ACT was associated with lower scores for those
born near term but higher scores for those born at or post term as compared to their unex-
posed counterparts.
ACT-exposed infants received significantly more care after birth than controls (Table 4). As
seen in Table 4, there were generally no differences by ACT in medical care provided to the

 very preterm and postterm groups, though untreated very preterm infants were more likely to
receive hospital transfer. Preterm, near-term, and term-born infants exposed to ACT had
higher rates of respirator care and intubation than matched infants. Further, Table 5 shows
that infants hospitalized beyond the seventh day clearly were more likely to be from the ACT
group born near term or at term.
Very preterm, near-term, and term-born infants exposed to ACT were consistently smaller
at birth than controls regardless of mode of delivery (S2–S4 Tables). Infants born by planned
cesarean would have received ACT in accordance with guidelines 7 days prior to delivery. The
largest deficit (342 g) in BWT was seen for near-term infants in this group.
Discussion
In this population cohort study of 278,508 live-born singleton births, exposure to ACT was
associated with smaller size at birth in comparison to unexposed infants. Matched analyses on
background and medical characteristics as well as timing of birth showed smaller birth size
among infants prenatally exposed to ACT, though no difference in birth size was detected for
the infants with shortest (24–29 weeks) or longest (�42 weeks) gestation in the stringent PSM
analyses. Consistent differences were observed in BWT in matched analyses among preterm,
near-term, and term infants, with the greatest reduction in BWT seen in preterm infants. Simi-
larly, BL and HC were most compromised in the preterm group, and clinically significant

 reductions were also observed for the near-term and term groups. Observed reductions in size
in relation to ACT were generally symmetrical, i.e., no difference in PI.
To our knowledge, this is the largest study conducted to analyze the impact of ACT on
birth size—4,887 individuals in total—and far exceeds the number used in the latest Cochrane
review database of RCTs and BWT [28] using evidence downgraded to moderate (because of
uncertain risk of bias and limitations of study design). Thus, these findings provide clinical evi-
dence in humans that confirms previous suspicions that ACT would reduce growth [14–16].
Our primary outcome was birth size, so to accurately examine differences, we stratified all
analyses by timing of birth and controlled for all available significant background variables.
ACT is indicated to prepare lung maturation in preterm infants; thus, infants born at term rep-
resent the group who unnecessarily received treatment. This group provides an indication of
whether growth deficits are due to ACT exposure or potentially to poor fetal health precipitat-
ing ACT.
Term infants who were exposed to ACT showed significant and symmetrical reductions in
all birth size measurements (BWT, BL, and HC), indicating that even earlier treatment (at the
time of threatened preterm birth) had a lasting impact on growth trajectory. The overall 89.38
g difference in BWT among the term group corresponds to a loss of about 5 days of optimum
growth (at term) according to recent international standards [29]. In comparison, BWT reduc-
tions of 90–150 g are associated with maternal smoking [30].
The 5-minute Apgar scores indicated that infants born preterm, regardless of ACT treat-
ment, were generally equally vigorous. At term, Apgar scores were slightly higher for unex-
posed male infants, whereas female infants had lower scores when born very preterm, near
term, at term, or post term. These results are worthy of further investigation to determine

 whether ACT would have a differential impact on Apgar scores dependent on fetal sex. Recent
evidence shows distinct biological pathways linking fetal sex with various complications asso-
ciated with restricted growth [31].
It is noteworthy that both male and female infants exposed to ACT were more likely to
receive medical interventions and to remain hospitalized beyond 7 days, though the overall
number of hospitalized infants was small. Our matched and stratified analyses show that there
were no differences in care regarding RDS—e.g., neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), respira-
tor care, or intubation—for the very preterm or postterm infants whether or not they had
received ACT. In fact, these medical interventions related to RDS were more likely among
ACT-treated infants than controls born preterm, near term, or at term. These findings suggest
that ACT was confounded by medical indication. Moreover, it is also possible that reduced
growth associated with ACT contributes to compromised neonatal health, thus leading to
more medical interventions. These results are similar to those recently reported [8] showing
that as the period between ACT and birth increased (i.e., birth near term or at term), so too
did the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity and hospitalization. The intention of prophylac-
tic use of ACT is to increase vitality at birth and reduce morbidity. In contrast, our results of
matched comparisons using PSM subsamples and timing of birth indicate that the ACT group
received more care. A large multinational cluster RCT of low- and middle-income countries
reported higher, rather than lower, mortality among the preterm infants prenatally exposed to
ACT [32]. Further, a meta-analysis examining ACT for elective cesarean section of term births

 concluded that although a small yet significant effect of ACT for prevention of neonatal mor-
bidities was observed, the authors strongly cautioned against routine use of ACT because of
other potential harms [33].
Reductions in size of infants also consistently differed by mode of delivery and ACT. For
preterm, near-term, and term-born infants, we observed a graded difference in BWT reduc-
tions, with the highest growth deficits for the unplanned cesarean deliveries, followed by
planned cesarean, and the least reductions in the vaginally delivered group. These findings
merit further investigation to disentangle the effects.
HC in relation to ACT is seldom reported. The few studies that do report HC report similar
deficits [14,34–35]; HC at birth reflects brain growth throughout gestation and has important
implications for neurodevelopment [36]. Basset and colleagues [37] report ACT was protective
for neurodevelopment only for infants with larger HC, indicating larger HC at birth confers
protection for preterm infants. A large prospective follow-up found an association between
ACT exposure and poorer scores on validated mental health screeners in childhood [38].
Smaller HC for preterm, near-term, and term infants, as shown by our data, may have long-
term implications.
BL is strongly associated with adult height, more so than other birth measurements [39],
and adult height in turn confers risk of death from several major chronic diseases [40]. We
consistently found shorter BL among ACT-exposed infants, which bears clinical significance
for health over the life course.

 Study strengths and limitations
This study has several unique strengths afforded by the use of objective population-based reg-
ister data. As far as we know, no other study is based on such a large sample or has focused on
birth size as the primary outcome. Though observational in nature, the size of this study pro-
vided the opportunity to carefully match infants on baseline characteristics that could have
influenced clinical decisions to treat, including risk factors/complications (e.g., preeclampsia)
that can lead to both spontaneous and elective preterm birth as well as intrauterine growth
retardation. The PSM technique enabled us to limit possible bias and include five matched
controls per patient for most analyses, which has been found to be the optimum number for
bias reduction [27]. In this way, difference between groups on severity of gestational complica-
tions is minimized, as five controls are compared to one patient.
We stratified our analysis by gestational age. Stratification is the method of choice for con-
trolling potential confounding and for identifying effect modification related to timing of birth
[41], which would not be captured had we merely controlled for gestational age. Our stratified
analysis revealed a dose-response-like association with greatest deficits in growth seen in all
measurements (BWT, BL, and HC) for preterm infants and reducing in magnitude over time
until eventually disappearing for infants born post term, thus suggesting a potential opportu-
nity for catch-up growth in utero or changing contribution of medically indicated preterm
births. At term, the growth deficits were still statistically and clinically significant, indicating
that even though some degree of catch-up growth may have occurred, the impact of ACT was
long-lasting. Regardless of analytic strategy (PSM or adjusted regression analyses), the results
were consistent and in the same direction, thus indicating that collider stratification bias is not
likely to operate [42]. Further, it is likely that because the sample size was so large, the effect of
ACT on birth size was not attributable to bias in treatment allocation. In fact, the entire sample
produced estimates of greater deficits in birth size, which are probably inflated as compared to
the matched analyses. Thus, we provide here robust estimates.
An advantage of carrying out our study in Finland is the high-quality and uniform antena-
tal care that is offered free of charge to women residing in Finland. Most women have on aver-
age 15 antenatal care visits [43]. There are no sociodemographic differences in the uptake of
care [43], so it is unlikely that complications were missed because of insufficient care by a
more vulnerable group; on the contrary, poor pregnancy outcomes are associated with a
higher number of visits, indicating greater surveillance [43]. Thus, confounding due to
inequalities in access to care is highly unlikely in this sample. Our results show that there were
no differences in socioeconomic status associated with treatment. This is particularly impor-
tant because socioeconomic inequalities are likely to confound birth size yet are rarely men-
tioned in previous research. Understandably, the rate of preterm birth is low in Finland, as the
standard of antenatal care is among the best in the world. This fact helps to discern well the
impact of ACT from potential confounders related to access to care. However, countries where
preterm rates are higher may also have care conditions that are less favorable for the preterm
neonate who would benefit from ACT to promote survival. Indeed, care decisions should also
consider issues of morbidity, neonatal care availability, and quality of life beyond survival.
We concentrated on live-born infants because our emphasis is on growth restriction
among survivors. Stillbirths in high-income countries are also associated with avoidable
maternal lifestyle factors such as obesity and smoking [44], factors that we controlled for in
our analyses. Stillbirths can be related to major complications or malformations, which would
make it very difficult to discern the impact of ACT on such infants.
Lack of detail in FMBR concerning ACT is the main limitation of this study. For example,
we lacked information on the time lag between ACT and birth (which would have enabled

 examination of critical periods of growth), drug name, dose, or number of doses (which would
enable drug-specific conclusions). Betamethasone remains biologically active for a period
ranging between 36 and 54 hours after administration. Thus, the infants who were born
shortly after ACT administration would be unlikely to receive the full effect of the drug. Any
growth deficit would be due to compromised fetal health. In contrast, those born at least 3
days after treatment are likely to have had a full effect of the drug. Growth deficits in these
infants would be due to both compromised health that led to treatment in the first place and
the ACT itself. However, we expect that national guidelines were implemented that recom-
mend a single dose of betamethasone and use tocolytic therapy to delay birth when needed.
Data on serial ultrasound scans are not recorded in FMBR. Studies with serial ultrasound scan-
ning would elucidate this issue by monitoring growth trajectory before and after ACT to deter-
mine the independent effects attributable to restricted growth due to poor health versus due to
treatment. As seen in our DAG representation, unmeasured factors including genetic liability
and lifestyle characteristics, such as health-related behaviors and mental health, are important
factors to include. Thus, the information gained herein is useful for designing future cohort
studies, which would not be restricted by population-based register data but would likely be of
a smaller sample size.
Our data underline the need to establish clinical practices to predict parturition with greater
accuracy to avoid inessential treatment, as nearly 45% of exposed infants were born at term.
Our report should serve as an impetus for identifying techniques to more accurately predict
preterm labor. Such advances have been preliminarily reported for a blood test that could
cheaply and accurately predict parturition [45] and go beyond fibronectin tests, which are
costlier and less often used worldwide. Appropriately targeting high-risk women for ACT
would result in less medical over-intervention. Our report of consistent reductions in growth
(BWT, BL, HC) coupled with increased medical interventions at birth for infants exposed to
ACT calls for further study and reevaluation of clinical practice.
