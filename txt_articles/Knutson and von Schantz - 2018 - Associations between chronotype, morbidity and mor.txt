ABSTRACT
Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep have been associated with greater
morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However,
no one has examined whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was to
test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased mortality in a large cohort
study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 adults aged 38–73 at the time of enrolment and an
average 6.5-year follow-up. The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single self-
reported question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning types, moderate
evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality
due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were
adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and
comorbidities. Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, was significantly asso-
ciated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Comparing definite evening type to definite
morning type, the associations were strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.86–2.02,
p = < 0.001), followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24–1.36, p = < 0.001), neurological disorders (OR
1.25, 95% CI 1.20–1.30, p = < 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19–1.27,
p = < 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18–1.26, p = < 0.001). The total number of
deaths was 10 534, out of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as
an ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI
1.004–1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite
morning types, definite evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 95%
CI 1.02–1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in evening types is consistent with
previous reports of increased levels of cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening
types may be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of which may be
attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological timing and externally imposed
timing of work and social activities. These findings suggest the need for researching possible interven-
tions aimed at either modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater
working hour flexibility.

Introduction
Identifying novel,potentially modifiable, life-style
factors associated with increased morbidity and
mortality can lead to innovative strategies for
improving health. We investigated a measure of
chronotype, which is an estimate of the general
part of the day (ranging between morning and
evening) that a person prefers for their daily activ-
ities. Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference)
and later timing of sleep (which is associated
with later chronotype) have been associated with
morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic
dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
(Reutrakul and Knutson 2015; Merikanto et al.
2013; Yu et al. 2015; Koopman et al. 2017) and
psychiatric symptoms (Jankowski 2016; Melo et al.
2017; Putilov 2017). In the UK Biobank Study, a
large prospective cohort study, a preference for
evening was also associated with more cardiovas-
cular risk factors, such as higher rates of smoking
and overweight/obesity (Patterson et al. 2017).

person”) in the risk of a variety of diseases. The

 objective of this study was to test the hypothesis
that a later chronotype is associated with increased
risk of all-cause mortality as well as mortality due
to CVD in a large study of adults in the United
Kingdom.
Methods
Study design and participants
We used data from the UK Biobank, a large, pro-
spective, population-based cohort study that was
designed to investigate risk factors for major disease
of middle and older age (Sudlow et al. 2015). The UK
Biobank enrolled 502 642 people aged 37–73 years
(53% women) from across the United Kingdom.
Identical assessment procedures were used across
field sites. The recruitment strategy aimed to be as
inclusive as possible, with every individual within the
inclusion age range who were registered with the
National Health Service and living up to about 25
miles from one of the assessment centres invited to
participate (Allen et al. 2012). The baseline assess-
ment was conducted between March 2006 and
October 2010. For the analyses presented here, the
mean follow-up time was 6.5 years.
Our primary exposure variable was chronotype,
which in the UK Biobank questionnaire was
assessed through a single question that asked, “Do
you consider yourself to be” with the four options
(in addition to “Do not know”): “definitely a morn-
ing person” (definite morning types), “more a
morning than evening person” (moderate morning
types), “more an evening than a morning person”
(moderate evening types) and “definitely an evening
person” (definite evening types). This question is
very
similar
to
the
last
question
of
the
Morningness-Eveningness
Questionnaire
(MEQ)
(Horne and Östberg 1976), which asks, “One
hears about ‘morning’ and ‘evening’ types of people.
Which ONE of these types do you consider yourself
to be?” and had the response options “Definitely a
‘morning’ type, Rather more a ‘morning’ than an
‘evening’ type, Rather more an ‘evening’ type than a
‘morning’ type, Definitely an ‘evening’ type”.
Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality
and mortality due to CVD. Mortality information
was obtained from the National Health Service for
England and Wales and by the NHS Central
Register in Scotland. All details from the death
certificate were provided to UK Biobank. Primary
cause of death was codified according to ICD10 by
trained UK Biobank personnel. We identified the
ICD10 codes I00-I99 as CVD-related.
Comorbidities
were
based
on
self-report.
Specifically, participants were asked to report
any illnesses they had and if the participant
was uncertain of the type of illness he/she
had, they described it to the interviewer (a
trained nurse) who attempted to code it. If
the illness could not be coded during the inter-
view,
the
interviewer
entered
a
free-text
description, which was subsequently reviewed
by a physician and, where possible, matched
to codes. Using these codes, cases of self-
reported CVD, diabetes, other endocrine disor-
ders, neurological disorders, renal disorders,
respiratory
disorders,
musculoskeletal
disor-
ders, gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders and
psychological
disorders
were
identified
(see
Supplemental Table 1).
Covariates in the model were selected based on
the potential to confound associations between
chronotype
and
mortality.
These
covariates
included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body
mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (SES),
sleep duration and comorbidities. Age at baseline
assessment was calculated in years based on date
of birth. Three age bins were defined based on
previous analyses of UK Biobank data (Ganna
and Ingelsson 2015): 37–52, 53–62 and 63–73
years. Sex (male/female) and ethnicity were self-
identified. Since a large majority of the sample
(94%) self-identified as “white”, we dichotomised
ethnicity into “white” and “non-white”. Smoking
status was obtained by self-report with the follow-
ing categories: “never”, “previous smoker”, “cur-
rent smoker” and “prefer not to answer”. Standing
height was measured using a Seca 240-cm height
measure while participants stood barefoot with
posture verified by trained staff. Weight was mea-
sured using a Tanita BC418MA body composition
analyser and BMI was calculated as weight (kg)
divided by height squared (m²). SES was based on
the Townsend deprivation index (Townsend et al.
1988), which was calculated immediately prior to
participants joining UK Biobank and was based on
the preceding national census output areas. Each
1046
K. L. KNUTSON AND M. VON SCHANTZ
 participant was assigned a score based on their
postcode.
Finally, sleep duration came from the touch
screen interview based on the question, “About
how many hours sleep do you get in every
24 hours (please include naps)?” and responses
were provided as integers.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were restricted to those participants
who provided a response to the question about
chronotype (n = 444 281) and further excluded
those who were missing any of the covariate
data resulting in a final sample size of 433 268
participants. The chronotype groups were com-
pared in unadjusted analyses using analyses of
variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables (e.g.
age, BMI, sleep duration, SES) or chi-squared
tests for categorical variables (e.g. sex, ethnicity,
smoking, comorbidities). Mean chronotype score
was also compared between groups using t tests
(for dichotomous variables) or ANOVA (for
variables with >2 groups). The prevalence of
the
comorbidities
between
the
chronotype
groups was also compared after adjusting for
age and sex using logistic regression models.
Cox proportional hazards model was used to
estimate
the
risk
of
mortality
according
to
chronotype. We modelled chronotype as an
ordinal variable and, to allow for non-linear
associations, we also created dummy variables
with definite morning type as the referent. Cox
proportional
hazards
models
were
estimated
adjusting for age (as continuous variable), sex,
ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, SES, diagnosed
comorbidities and sleep duration. We also cre-
ated
interaction
terms
between
chronotype
(ordinal variable) and both sex and the three
age groups to test for differences in associations
between
mortality
and
chronotype.
When interaction terms were significant, we
conducted stratified analyses. Finally, a signifi-
cant
number
of
participants
(n
=
50
061)
selected the answer “do not know” to the chron-
otype question. Other investigators reporting UK
Biobank data (Jones et al. 2016) have chosen to
classify
this
group
as
a
fifth,
intermediate
response. So, to verify our findings, we have
repeated the analysis of chronotype and mortal-
ity risk using a five-level chronotype variable: 2
definite morning type, 1 moderate morning
types, 0 do not know, −1 moderate evening
types and −2 definite evening types. The prob-
ability p < 0.05 (two-sided) was set as the
accepted level of statistical significance. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using Stata, v14
(Statacorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Our final sample included 433 268 participants. Ages
ranged from 38 to 73 years (mean 56.5, SD 8.1) and
55.7% was women. Approximately, 27% identified as
definite morning types, 35% as moderate morning
types, 28% as moderate evening types and 9% as
definite evening types. Table 1 describes the full
sample as well as each chronotype group. Those
who identified as definite morning types were on
average older, included a higher proportion of
women and non-smokers, and lower proportions
of white ethnicity than definite evening types.
The prevalence of the various disorders differed
significantly
among
the
chronotype
groups
(Table 1). Table 2 presents the odds ratios asso-
ciated with having each comorbidity based on
chronotype after adjusting for age and sex. When
chronotype is modelled as an ordinal variable, it is
significantly associated with all the comorbidities.
Each incremental increase in eveningness from
definite morning to definite evening type was asso-
ciated
with
increased
odds
of
having
each comorbidity. When chronotype was treated
as categories, those who were definite evening
types were significantly more likely to have each
comorbidity compared to those who were definite
morning types. The association was strongest for
psychological disorders (OR 1.94), followed by dia-
betes (OR 1.30), neurological disorders (OR 1.25),
gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23) and
respiratory disorders (OR 1.22). Mean chronotype
scores also varied by demographic and comorbidity
groups in a similar pattern, with higher mean scores
(greater eveningness) in younger age groups, men,
whites, current smokers, in those without CVD and
in those with diabetes, neurological disorders,
respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal disorders or
psychological disorders (Supplemental Table 2).

 There were 10 534 deaths from all causes during
the follow-up period and, of these, 2127 were due to
CVD. Table 3 presents the hazard ratios for mortal-
ity associated with chronotype as an ordinal variable
as well as the HR for the covariates. Chronotype as
an ordinal variable was associated with all-cause
mortality (1.02 per level, p = 0.017) and CVD mor-
tality (1.04 per level, p = 0.06), such that increasing
eveningness was associated with greater mortality.
When chronotypes were considered as categories,
being a definite evening type was associated with a
10% increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 1.10,

morning types. Neither of the two intermediate
groups was associated with increased risk of all-
cause mortality. None of the chronotype categories
was significantly associated with increased risk of
CVD mortality compared to definite morning
types. Results from analyses where the answer “do
not know” was interpreted as an intermediate chron-
otype were very similar to the findings above
(Supplemental Table 3). Greater morningness was
associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR
0.98, 95% CI 0.97, 0.996, p = 0.012) and CVD mor-
tality (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94, 0.998, p = 0.037).
No significant interactions by sex were observed
(both p > 0.30), indicating that the association
between chronotype and all-cause or CVD mortality
did not differ between men and women. There was,
however, a significant interaction between chrono-
type and age for all-cause mortality (p = 0.02) but not
CVD mortality (p = 0.45). Analyses of all-cause
mortality were then stratified by the three age
groups, and the number of deaths was 1229 in the
37–52-year-old group, 3821 in the 53–62-year-old
group and 5484 in the 63–73-year-old group. The
association between chronotype and all-cause mor-
tality was significant in the 63–73-year-age group

Discussion
Increased eveningness, particularly definite evening
type, was associated with increased prevalence of a
wide variety of diseases or disorders, including dia-
betes, psychological, neurological, respiratory and
gastrointestinal/abdominal
disorders.
Further,
increased eveningness was significantly associated
with increased risk of all-cause mortality over
6.5 years. Chronotype as an ordinal variable was
also associated with increased risk CVD mortality
but did not reach statistical significance. The effect
size was small (2% increased risk with each level of
chronotype); however, this effect size is similar to the
effect we observed for BMI, endocrine disorders
(excluding diabetes), renal disorders, musculoskele-
tal disorders and gastrointestinal/abdominal disor-
ders. Further, mortality is a significant clinical
outcome and any increase in age-adjusted risk of
death warrants attention. There was no evidence
for a difference in these associations between men
and women. We did observe differences between age
groups in that the association between later chron-
otype and increased risk of all-cause was significant
and strongest in the oldest age group.
The unique strengths of this study include its
large sample size and the prospective study
design. No previous prospective population-
based
studies
have
included
a
measure
of
chronotype and mortality. An important poten-
tial weakness is the single question used to
assess chronotype. A significant number of par-
ticipants (50 061) selected the answer “do not
know”; however, as shown in Supplemental
Table 3, including them did not appreciably
change
our
findings.
Circadian
biologists
mainly use two validated instruments used to
assess either circadian preference, the MEQ
(Horne and Östberg 1976), or circadian timing
of
behaviour,
the
Munich
Chronotype
Questionnaire (Roenneberg et al. 2003). Both
instruments require several questions to esti-
mate circadian preference or chronotype, while
the
UK
Biobank
participants
rated
their chronotype through the answer to a single
question. However, this question is practically
identical to the final question of the MEQ,
which has been found to have the highest cor-
relation (p = 0.89) to the total MEQ score
(Adan and Almirall 1991), which suggests that
misclassification
may
have
been
minimal.
Further, the brevity of the question makes it
more acceptable for use in clinic or public
health
settings.
Second,
the
comparison
of
chronotype and prevalent disease does not indi-
cate causal direction. Finally, the UK Biobank
cohort is generally healthier than the general
UK population (Fry et al. 2017), and the degree
to which these findings are generalisable to the
entire population, or to other countries, is not
known.
Our findings both agree with and crucially
add to previously reported associations between
evening types and increased morbidity and asso-
ciated risk factors (Merikanto et al. 2013; Yu
et al. 2015; Koopman et al. 2017). Eveningness
has been associated with less healthy diets,
including
greater
proportion
of
fat
intake
(Kanerva et al. 2012; Sato-Mito et al. 2011),
which could increase risk of cardiometabolic dis-
eases. Other studies have found that people with
later chronotypes had a higher prevalence of
type 2 diabetes (Yu et al. 2015; Merikanto et al.
2013) and hypertension (Merikanto et al. 2013),
which is consistent with our finding that later
chronotypes were more likely to have CVD and
diabetes. Greater eveningness has also been asso-
ciated with depression and mood disorders, par-
ticularly in those 50 years or older (Kim et al.
2010).
Behaviourally,
evening
types
have
a
greater
tendency
towards
impulsivity
and
novelty
seeking
and
lower
harm
avoidance
(Adan et al. 2010; Caci et al. 2004). Evening
types have also reported greater consumption
of legal psychoactive substances (nicotine, alco-
hol and caffeine) (Adan 1994) as well as illegal
drugs (Prat and Adan 2011), which could reflect
either biological differences or sheer opportunity
offered by being awake and active late at night.
These findings are consistent with our observed
association between chronotype and psychologi-
cal disorders, which includes mood disorders
and
substance
abuse.
One
population-based
1050
K. L. KNUTSON AND M. VON SCHANTZ
 study in Finland reported that evening chrono-
types were more likely to have respiratory dis-
orders, such as asthma (Merikanto et al. 2014),
and we made similar observations in the UK
cohort. We also found that evening types have
a greater prevalence of neurological and gastro-
intestinal/abdominal disorders, which has not
been reported previously. In sum, several physi-
cal and mental health measures could underlie
the association between eveningness, morbidity
and mortality risk.
To date, no prospective population-based stu-
dies have examined associations between chrono-
type
and
mortality.
A
prospective
study
of
approximately 11 000 Finnish twins examined
chronotype, shift work in the incidence as well as
mortality due to prostate cancer (Dickerman et al.
2016). That study found that those who identified
as “somewhat evening” types had a significantly
increased risk of developing prostate cancer com-
pared to definite morning types (HR 1.3; 95% CI
1.1, 1.6). The study reported no significant associa-
tion between chronotype and prostate cancer mor-
tality; however, they only observed 110 such
deaths and may have been underpowered.
The health of evening types could be com-
promised by misalignment between their endo-
genous biological clocks and the timing of
social activities (e.g. work or meals), termed
circadian
misalignment.
Experimentally
induced circadian misalignment has resulted in
impairments
in
glucose
metabolism
(Scheer
et al. 2009; Buxton et al. 2012; Leproult et al.
2014), profound disruption of rhythmic gene
expression programmes (Archer et al. 2014)
and impairments in mood (Boivin et al. 1997).
Evening
types
also
commonly
experience
greater “social jetlag” (Wittmann et al. 2006),
which is caused by going to bed and waking up
later on non-work days compared to work days.
Greater social jetlag has been associated with
being
overweight
(BMI
≥25 kg/m²)
(Roenneberg et al. 2012) and adverse cardiome-
tabolic profiles (Rutters et al. 2014; Parsons
et al. 2015). Shorter sleep durations are more
common in evening types (Roenneberg et al.
2007)
and
shorter
sleep
is
associated
with
increased morbidity and mortality (Knutson
2010; Yin et al. 2017). However, the difference
in self-reported sleep duration between the
chronotype groups in our study was minimal
(and controlled for) and thus, differences in
sleep duration are not likely to explain our
observations.
Finally,
increased
morbidity
among evening types may also be due to greater
exposure to artificial light at night that acutely
suppresses melatonin. Lower levels of melatonin
have been associated with greater insulin resis-
tance (Reutrakul et al. 2018), increased risk of
diabetes (Mcmullan et al. 2013) and breast and
prostate cancer (Kloog et al. 2009; Kloog et al.
2010).
The heritable component of chronotype has
been calculated to be between 21% and 52%
(von Schantz et al. 2015). Our data do not
reveal to what extent the association between
eveningness and higher morbidity and mortality
reflects genetic and environmental components.
However, key environmental determinants of
chronotype are potentially modifiable by inter-
ventions aimed at advancing circadian phase,
such as administration of light in the morning
and of melatonin in the evening. Another strat-
egy to improve health of evening types would
be to adjust work schedules to suit individual
chronotype. It is also worth noting that daylight
savings
time
(DST)/summer
time
places
a
further burden on individuals who are already
struggling with the dictates of social norms on
when to start the working day, and the switch
to DST, which is perceived as more uncomfor-
table by evening types than by morning types
(Nascimento
De
Alencar
et
al.
2017;
Kantermann et al. 2007), also coincided with
greater
incidence
of
cardiovascular
events
(Jiddou et al. 2013).
Thus, our findings suggest a need for more
research on the physiological consequences of
being an evening type to explain the increased
risk
of
mortality.
Understanding
the
link
between chronotype and mortality could lead
to the development of additional behavioural
strategies
to
mitigate
risk
associated
with
being an evening type. Strategies could include
therapies that target the circadian system and
tailoring schedules to suit individual chrono-
type
whenever
possible
(Roenneberg
and
Merrow 2016). These novel therapies have the
CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
1051
 potential to critically improve not only well-
being and health but even life expectancy of
evening types.
