consequences of the imagined movement

Research on motor imagery has identified many similarities between imagined and executed
actions at the behavioral, physiological and neural levels, thus supporting their “functional
equivalence”. In contrast, little is known about their possible “computational equivalence”—
specifically, whether the brain’s internal forward models predict the sensory consequences of
imagined movements as they do for overt movements. Here, we address this question by
assessing whether imagined self-generated touch produces an attenuation of real tactile
sensations. Previous studies have shown that self-touch feels less intense compared with
touch of external origin because the forward models predict the tactile feedback based on a
copy of the motor command. Our results demonstrate that imagined self-touch is attenuated
just as real self-touch is and that the imagery-induced attenuation follows the same
spatiotemporal principles as does the attenuation elicited by overt movements. We conclude
that motor imagery recruits the forward models to predict the sensory consequences of
imagined movements.

ne of the most remarkable abilities of the human mind is
its capacity to mentally simulate actions without physi-
cally executing them. More than two decades ago, Jean-
nerod and Decety1,2 proposed that imagined movements are the
internal
simulation
of
actual
movements.
This
influential
“simulation
hypothesis”
received
impressive
support
from
experimental studies: imagined movements were shown to have
similar durations1,3–6 and to follow the same trade-off between
movement duration and task difficulty as real movements7–10.
Physiological studies revealed that imagined movements can
increase physiological variables (e.g., heart rate) proportionally to
the imagined effort, similar to executed movements11,12. Neu-
roimaging studies further showed that motor imagery activates a
set of frontal motor areas, parietal areas, and cerebellar regions
that partially overlaps with the brain network that is activated
during motor execution13,14 (for reviews, see refs. 15,16), and that
motor imagery of different effectors activates the corresponding
sections of the somatotopically organized motor cortex17. This
behavioral, physiological, and neuroimaging evidence enforced
the view that imagined movements are functionally equivalent to
the executed ones in terms of intentions, motor planning, and
engagement of motor programs14,18. However, a strict prediction
of the simulation hypothesis is that motor imagery should engage
the same mechanisms in terms of predictive computational units
(“forward models”, see next paragraph) to generate sensorimotor
predictions as real movements. To date, no previous study has
directly tested this hypothesis of computational equivalence
between motor imagery and motor execution; therefore, we do
not know whether imagined movements engage the same central
sensorimotor mechanisms as overt movements do. This question
is fundamental not only for our basic understanding of the
neurocognitive basis of motor imagery but also for emerging
applications that seek to use motor imagery as a tool to control
brain machine interfaces and advanced prosthetic limbs19–21, or
to replace or complement physical therapy and mobility training
in the rehabilitation of neurological patients22–24.
The prevailing theories of motor control posit that our ability
to execute quick and accurate movements relies on computational
units called forward models. These models encode the dynamics
of our body parts in their interactions with the environment and
anticipate the outcome of our voluntary movements25,26. When a
motor command is sent from the motor cortices to the muscles, a
copy of that motor command (efference copy) is also sent to the
forward models. The forward models then use this information
about the motor command to predict both the state of our body
after the upcoming movement and the sensory consequences that
the movement is likely to generate (sensory predictions)27. These
predictions are effectively combined with the actual sensory
feedback to provide a more reliable estimate of the state of the
body compared with what can be derived from the sensory
feedback alone, because such afferent information is both noisy
and delayed28. In addition, the brain uses these predictions to
attenuate the perception of the sensory feedback of the movement
(reafference), thereby increasing the salience of stimuli that are
generated by external causes29,30. The classical example of this
phenomenon is that when we touch one hand with the other, the
touch feels weaker compared with a touch of identical intensity
that is applied by another person or a robot. This occurs because
the self-generated touch has been predicted by the forward
models based on the efference copy; consequently, the somato-
sensory feedback is attenuated31,32. The sensory attenuation of
self-touch is thus a well-established paradigm for probing the
engagement of efference copy and forward models in sensor-
imotor control.
To test the hypothesis that motor imagery engages the same
computational mechanisms as real movements do, we here
examined whether imagined self-touch elicits somatosensory
attenuation. Specifically, we examined whether an external touch
applied to the left index finger is attenuated when participants
simultaneously imagine a voluntary movement of pressing their
right index finger against their left one. Our experiments show
that imagined self-touch is attenuated and that this imagery-
driven attenuation has a comparable magnitude to the attenua-
tion produced during overt movements. Further control experi-
ments demonstrate that the imagined movement has to comply
with the spatial and temporal principles of self-touch for sensory
attenuation to be observed. We conclude that during motor
imagery, the forward models predict the sensory consequences of
the imagined movement.
Results
Force-matching task. To psychophysically quantify somatosen-
sory attenuation, we used the force-matching task33. In the
classic version of this task, in each trial, participants receive a
briefly presented force on the pulp of their relaxed left
index finger (reference force) by a probe controlled by a
DC motor. Immediately afterwards, they are asked to produce a
force that matches the reference force in terms of magnitude
(matched
force).
When
asked
to
generate
the
matching
force by pressing the pulp of their right index finger against a
sensor placed directly above their left index finger—thus
effectively simulating self-touch —participants consistently apply
forces
that
are
stronger
than
the
reference
ones30,33–35.
This shows that the self-generated force feels weaker than
the
externally
produced
reference
force,
and
that
the
participants are compensating for this by increasing the level of
applied force to match the previously experienced reference
force level. This effect thus constitutes objective evidence for
somatosensory attenuation resulting from the sensory predictions
generated by the forward models. In contrast, when the partici-
pants use a slider (or a joystick) that controls the force output on
their left index finger, they are accurate in matching the reference
forces30,33–35. In this baseline condition, the motor command
(which is generated to horizontally displace the slider) and the
force output are unusually related; therefore, the forward model
cannot reliably predict the force sensations and no attenuation
occurs.
To allow us to study the effects of motor imagery on
somatosensory attenuation, we modified the force-matching task
so the experimental manipulation occurred during the applica-
tion of the reference force instead of during the generation of
the matched forces (Fig. 1a–c). In the press condition, the
participants pressed their right index finger against a sensor
placed above (but not in contact with) their left index finger as
strongly as they felt was required to match the reference force that
they simultaneously felt on their left index finger (Fig. 1b). In the
imagine condition, the participants were instructed to imagine
that they were pressing their right index finger against the sensor
and to imagine a force level that corresponded to the one they
concurrently felt on their left index finger (Fig. 1c). Finally, in the
base condition, the participants completely relaxed their right
hand and right index finger without imagining any action
(Fig. 1a). To report the perceived intensity of the reference forces
applied to the left index finger, the participants used a slider with
their right hand to generate the matched forces in all conditions
(Fig. 1a–c). We hypothesized that if the forward models predicted
the sensory consequences of the imagined finger pressing—as
they do for executed pressing—then the reference force applied
on the left index finger in the imagine condition would feel less
intense compared with the identical forces exerted in the base
condition.

 Twelve naive, right-handed, healthy volunteers participated in
Experiment 1. Figure 1d shows the participants’ performance in
the three conditions across the different levels of reference force
that were tested. A repeated-measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of condition (F
(2,22) = 4.68, p = 0.020), a significant main effect of reference
force level (F(4,44) = 153.5, p < 0.001), and a significant interac-
tion (F(8,88) = 2.81, p = 0.008). Residual errors were normally
distributed (Shapiro–Wilk test, p = 0.297). Pairwise comparisons
between the levels of the reference forces revealed significant
differences for each pair (p < 0.001), which confirmed that
participants discriminated each reference force level well. As
seen in Fig. 1e, the participants produced weaker forces both
when they had previously pressed (mean ± SD = 1.902 ± 0.400 N)
or imagined pressing (mean ± SD = 1.910 ± 0.389 N) the sensor
compared with the base condition, when they relaxed their index
finger
without
imagining
(mean ± SD = 2.094 ± 0.256 N).
A
pairwise comparison revealed that participants generated sig-
nificantly weaker forces in the press condition compared with the
base control condition (t(11) = –2.46, p = 0.032, confidence
interval (CI) = [– 0.364, – 0.020], Hedges’ gav = 0.565), confirm-
ing that when participants actively pressed the sensor on top of
their left index finger, the reference force was attenuated and thus
felt weaker. Critically, the imagine condition also yielded
significantly weaker forces compared with the base condition
(t(11) = – 2.76,
p = 0.018,
CI = [– 0.331,
– 0.038],

finger relaxed on top of a support (base; a); (ii) press a sensor with the right index finger (press; b); or (iii) imagine pressing the sensor with their right
index finger (imagine; c). When pressing or imagining pressing, they were instructed to use as much force as they felt was required to match the reference

 imagined pressing their right index finger against the sensor.
Remarkably, the participants’ forces did not differ significantly
between the press and imagine conditions (t(11) = – 0.12,
p = 0.908, CI = [– 0.157, 0.141], Hedges’ gav = 0.019), showing
that the imagery-induced attenuation had a similar magnitude
as the attenuation produced by real force production. Figure 1f
illustrates these somatosensory attenuation effects, expressed as
the difference between the reference forces and the matched
forces per condition.
To ensure that the participants did not generate any small
muscular contractions while imagining—a factor that would
confound motor imagery with motor execution36—we also
recorded surface electromyographic activity (EMG) from the
first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the right hand during all
conditions. Figure 1g shows the root-mean-square (RMS) of the
EMG activity averaged across all applications of reference forces
per condition. As expected, the FDI activity was greater during
the press condition (mean ± SD = 0.032 ± 0.028 V) compared
with the base (mean ± SD = 0.002 ± 0.0005 V) and imagine
conditions (mean ± SD = 0.003 ± 0.0004 V). Pairwise compari-
sons confirmed that the FDI was significantly more active during
the press compared with both the base condition (n = 12, V = 78,
p < 0.001,
CI = [0.016,
0.036],
r = 0.624)
and
the
imagine
condition
(n = 12,
V = 78,
p < 0.001,
CI = [0.016,
0.037],
r = 0.624). Critically, there was no significant difference between
the base and imagine conditions (t(11) = – 1.23, p = 0.243,
CI = [– 0.0005, 0.0001], Hedges’ gav = 0.36). These results con-
firm that the participants were able to relax their index finger
while imagining pressing it against the sensor.
In summary, Experiment 1 showed that the motor imagery of
pressing the right index finger against the sensor above the left
index finger produced somatosensory attenuation. To confirm
that this imagery-induced attenuation was due to the predictions
of the forward models and not to general factors related to
performing mental imagery, such as differences in the attentional
demands between the base and imagine conditions (e.g., divided
attention), we conducted a control experiment. We hypothesized
that if the sensory attenuation observed in the imagine condition

 of Experiment 1 is truly a consequence of the predictions of the
forward model based on the efference copy, then imagining
another movement that does not have tactile consequences for
the left hand should not produce attenuation. Therefore, in
Experiment 2, a new group of 12 naive, right-handed volunteers
participated under exactly the same conditions as those of
Experiment 1 (identical instructions and task), with the only
difference being that their right hand, the sensor, and the slider
were all displaced by 25 cm to the right of their left index finger
(Fig. 2a–c). Previous studies30,34,37 have shown that when such a
distance is introduced between the hands, touch is perceived
more accurately, because the two hands are too far apart for the
forward models to reliably anticipate physical contact and to
predict touch34. Thus, we hypothesized that if imagery-induced
attenuation is due to the sensory predictions of the forward
models, then in this control experiment, we should observe no
differences between the base and imagine conditions, because the
forward models would no longer generate the somatosensory
predictions required for the attenuation to occur.
Figure 2d shows the participants’ performance for each level of
reference force in the three conditions of Experiment 2. There
was no significant main effect of condition (F(2,22) = 1.30,
p = 0.292) and no significant interaction between condition and
reference force level (F(8,88) = 1.40, p = 0.209). Only a significant
main effect of reference force level was detected (F(4,44) = 208.7,
p < 0.001), confirming again that the participants could discri-
minate the reference force levels well (for all pairwise compar-
isons, p < 0.001). Residual errors were normally distributed
(Shapiro–Wilk test, p = 0.810). Participants produced similar
forces in the three conditions (basefar: mean ± SD = 1.983 ± 0.446
N; pressfar: mean ± SD = 1.937 ± 0.388 N; imaginefar: mean ± SD
= 2.063 ± 0.434 N) (Fig. 2e–f). Pairwise comparisons further
revealed that the matched forces in the pressfar condition
did
not
differ
from
the
basefar
condition
(t(11) = – 0.49,
p = 0.634, CI = [– 0.249, 0.158], Hedges’ gav = 0.106), confirming
the previous findings that when the hands are placed at a
distance, the sense of force is not attenuated34. Importantly,
the forces in the imaginefar condition did not differ significantly
from those in the basefar condition (t(11) = 0.99, p = 0.345,
CI = [– 0.099, 0.260], Hedges’ gav = 0.175), which suggests that
no attenuation occurred during the motor imagery. In accordance
with this finding, the forces in the imaginefar condition were not
significantly different from those in the pressfar condition
(t(11) = 2.12, p = 0.057, CI = [– 0.005, 0.256], Hedges’ gav =
0.296). Finally, the analysis of the EMG data from Experiment 2
confirmed that the participants were able to relax their right
hand and right index finger in the motor imagery and baseline
conditions
equally
well
(n = 12,
V = 38,
p = 0.970,
CI = [– 0.0002, 0.0004], r = 0.016) (Fig. 2g). As expected, the
FDI was significantly more active during the pressfar compared
with the basefar (n = 12, V = 78, p < 0.001, CI = [0.011, 0.049],
r = 0.624) and imaginefar conditions (n = 12, V = 78, p < 0.001,
CI = [0.011, 0.049], r = 0.624). Taken together, these observa-
tions refute any concern that differences related to performing
imagery
per
se
(including
the
somatosensory
aspects
of
kinesthetic motor imagery) or differences in attention or
cognitive effort between the imagery and baseline conditions
could explain the findings in Experiment 1; in contrast, they
suggest that adding a distance between the hands eliminates the
imagery-induced attenuation.
To directly test the effect of the spatial distance between the
hands on the imagery-induced somatosensory attenuation, we
directly compared the force data from the imagine conditions
across the two experiments after normalizing the data to the
corresponding base conditions (to eliminate unspecific between-
group differences; Fig. 3a). The motor imagery conditions in
the two experiments were matched in terms of rated vividness of
the imagery (n = 12, W = 76, p = 0.835, r = 0.048) or difficulty in
evoking the mental images (n = 12, W = 71, p = 0.976, r = 0.012)
(Fig. 3b, c). Importantly, we found that the motor imagery of
pressing the sensor when it was placed on top of the left index
finger led to significantly greater attenuation compared with
imagery of pressing the sensor when it was positioned at a 25-cm
distance from the left index finger: t(22) = 2.51, p = 0.020,
CI = [0.046, 0.484], Cohen’s ds = 1.024. This shows that the
imagery-induced force attenuation follows the same spatial rule as
does the attenuation generated by overt voluntary action.
Finally, we conducted an additional control experiment
(Experiment 3) to address the temporal rule of the imagery-
induced attenuation effect under investigation. Previous findings

 on the force-matching task have shown that somatosensory
attenuation is observed when the forces applied to the receiving
finger occur at the same time that the participants actively
produce the forces on the sensor. If a large temporal delay is
introduced between the two events, the attenuation effect is
eliminated31. To determine whether the same principle holds true
for motor imagery, we conducted an additional control experi-
ment with twelve new volunteers (Supplementary Note 1). The
results showed that the imagery-driven attenuation requires
participants to perform the imagery task at the same time that
they receive the reference force (Supplementary Note 1). No
significant attenuation of the perceived forces was observed when
the imagery task was performed five seconds before the
application of the reference force (Supplementary Fig. 1);
however, concurrent imagery and reference force replicated the
results from Experiment 1. These findings further corroborate our
main conclusion that the imagery-driven sensory attenuation is
the result of predictions made by the forward model that require a
likely causal relationship between the (imagined) movement and
its
sensory
consequences
according
to
the
spatiotemporal
constraints of self-touch perception31,38.
Discussion
The main conclusion of the present study is that motor imagery
produces somatosensory attenuation just as real movements do.
Specifically, our results showed that imagined finger pressing
produced an attenuation of self-touch and that this imagery-
induced attenuation was of comparable magnitude and obeyed
the same spatiotemporal rules between the hands as overt force
production. These findings not only support the notion of
functional equivalence between motor imagery and motor
execution, but they demonstrate a “computational equivalence”.
It has long been theorized that forward models are utilized during
motor imagery25,28,39. Blakemore and Sirigu40 postulated that
during motor imagery, a forward model specific for the imagined
action needs to be retrieved. Almost at the same time, Grush41
introduced his ‘emulation hypothesis,’ according to which for-
ward models (emulators) actively simulate the imagined action
and predict its sensory consequences. Nevertheless, these pro-
posals remained a conjecture42,43, because the covert nature of
imagery and its lack of sensory feedback have made this
assumption difficult to experimentally test. Although a few
experimental studies have suggested the involvement of predictive
processes during speech imagery44–47, there has not been
experimental evidence directly supporting or falsifying this the-
ory. Given that the somatosensory attenuation emerges when the
forward models predict the touch based on the efference
copy27,30,31,34,48,
our
findings
bring
direct
and
conclusive
experimental behavioral evidence that motor imagery does indeed
recruit the forward models to predict the sensory consequences of
the imagined action. This constitutes a major advance in our
understanding of the computational principles of motor imagery.
Based on our results, we propose that imagining a movement
engages the same forward models as does physically executing the
imagined action (Fig. 4a, b). Such a common mechanism would
be
computationally
less
expensive
than
having
different
mechanisms for overt and covert movements. When we imagine
moving one hand to touch the other, the forward models simulate
the imagined action based on the efference copy and predict the
end states of the limbs after the imagined action as well as their
sensory consequences, just as they do for real movements. If the
predicted positions of the limbs after the imagined movement
indicate contact between two body parts, then the forward models
generate tactile predictions. Thus, in our experimental setup,
when we delivered real tactile stimulation at the right time and at
the right place on the body to coincide with the “effects” of the
imagined finger action, the brain processed these somatosensory
signals as though they were the actual anticipated sensory feed-
back of the imagined movement. Consequently, these somato-
sensory signals got attenuated, because they had been predicted
by the forward models (Fig. 4b), which demonstrates that motor
imagery entails the prediction of the sensory consequences of the
imagined action.
What could be the neuronal mechanisms that underlie the
current imagery-induced somatosensory attenuation effects?
Previous studies have shown that motor imagery consistently
activates regions related to motor execution such as the supple-
mentary motor area, the premotor cortex and the cere-
bellum16,49–57. The motor programs and efference copy are likely
produced in the non-primary motor areas and sent to the cere-
bellum via the anatomical connections that exist between these
structures58–60. The cerebellum is then a strong candidate for the
neural substrate of the forward models61–64 that could generate

actions.
The present results are also interesting from the perspective
of computational sensorimotor control, because they provide
unique experimental evidence supporting the critical role had by
the efference copy in sensory attenuation. Although previous

against the other. Given a copy of the motor command, the forward models predict the next state of the body and the associated sensory consequences of
this state. When pressing one finger against the other, these sensory consequences include the tactile feedback from the self-touch. The predicted touch is
used to attenuate the actual tactile feedback (comparator). This model is based on an earlier proposal38. b Somatosensory attenuation during imagining
pressing one index finger against the other. For the covert action, the forward models predict tactile feedback based on the efference copy that is generated
as part of the internal simulation of the action. When touch is applied externally on the finger in a way that matches the predicted feedback from the
imagined movement, the somatosensory sensation is attenuated, just as occurs during real self-touch, because the forward models have already predicted it

 computational models have postulated a central role for efference
copy as an input signal to the forward models, e.g.,27,28,30,38,65,
conclusive experimental evidence in favor of this idea has been
lacking. Efference copy is typically studied in conditions with
active movement, but active movement additionally involves the
descent of motor commands to the spinal cord, muscular con-
tractions and proprioceptive feedback, as well as other kinds of
somatosensory feedback (e.g., skin stretching, joint pressures). In
previous experimental studies on the sensory attenuation of self-
touch30,31,33,34,37, the possible effect of efference copy was always
confounded by these additional factors. This is problematic
because somatosensory feedback during active overt movements
could be subject to “sensory filtering” or “gating” mechanisms66,
which could reduce the perceived intensity of the somatosensory
percepts, independent of the efference copy. Therefore, the pre-
sent results are important because they suggest that the efference
copy is sufficient to elicit the sensory attenuation of self-touch in
the absence of any actual movement.
Finally, the present findings have far-reaching implications for
theories of motor learning through mental rehearsal. There is a
growing interest among movement researchers and clinical pro-
fessionals to use motor imagery as a tool to enhance motor
performance and facilitate motor learning. Several studies have
shown that motor imagery can significantly improve motor
performance in terms of, e.g., movement accuracy and efficacy
(see refs. 67,68 for reviews). Moreover, it has been shown that this
imagery-driven motor learning can generalize to similar tasks that
are physically executed afterwards69. Indeed, motor imagery is
one of the most common strategies for practicing among elite
athletes42,70 and professional musicians71, and it has been proved
to be beneficial for the motor rehabilitation of neurological
patients22–24. Dominant theories of motor learning suggest that
our brain uses the discrepancy between the feedback predicted by
the forward models and the actual sensory feedback (sensory
prediction error) to update the forward models and improve our
control policies72,73. The present study indicates that the motor
improvement seen after the mental practice of movements might
be due to the forward models running offline based on the
efference copy alone during imagery. During the repeated mental
simulation of a movement, the forward models could use the
difference between the predicted and the desired outcome as the
teaching signal in the updating process, thereby establishing a
better and finer motor performance on subsequent overt execu-
tion. Motor imagery thus truly corresponds to the mind’s internal
simulation of action that can be used to improve further per-
formance and induce neural plasticity.
Methods
Participants. Twelve healthy participants (5 women and 7 men, all right-handed)
aged 22–37 years participated in Experiment 1, and 12 different healthy partici-
pants (6 women and 6 men, all right-handed) aged 18–30 years took part in
Experiment 2. The sample size was chosen based on previous studies31,33. All
participants were naive to the purpose of the studies. Three additional participants
were recruited but excluded and replaced, because two of them (one from
Experiment 1 and one from Experiment 2) were unable to fully relax their
right hand and index finger in imagery and baseline conditions, as evident
in the on-line EMG recordings; the third one was excluded after Experiment 1,
because he reported that he did not perform the imagery task as instructed.
None of the participants reported a current or previous history of psychiatric or
neurological conditions, and none of them had a history or current use of any
psychoactive medication. The Regional Ethical Review Board of Stockholm
approved both experiments, and all participants gave their written informed
consent. Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory74.
General procedure. Participants rested their left hand palm up with their left
index finger placed on a molded support. In each trial, a cylindrical probe (25 mm
height) with a flat aluminum surface (20 mm diameter) attached to a lever that was
controlled by a DC motor (Maxon EC Motor EC 90 flat, manufactured in Swit-
zerland) applied a force on the pulp of the participants’ left index finger. A small
force sensor (FSG15N1A, Honeywell Inc.; diameter, 5 mm; minimum resolution,
0.01 N; response time, 1 ms; measurement range, 0–15 N) was placed inside
the probe. This sensor measured the reference forces and the matched forces
applied on the participants’ finger throughout the experiments. An identical force
sensor (sensor displayed in Figs. 1 and 2) was placed inside a second cylindrical
capsule that was positioned on top of a small wooden structure. The wooden
structure with the capsule and the sensor was placed either on top of (but not in
contact with) the probe of the lever above the left index finger (Experiment 1) or
25 cm to the right of the participants’ left index fingers (Experiment 2).
The participants’ right forearms and elbows were comfortably placed on top of
two box-shaped cuboids made of sponge (length × width × height, 20 cm × 10 cm ×
10 cm). The position and height of the boxes were carefully selected such that a
part of the participants’ hands could protrude from the boxes and their right index
fingers could comfortably rest on top of the capsule without any muscular
contraction and without touching anything else.
During each trial, the probe exerted a constant reference force on the
participants’ left index fingers (1 N, 1.5 N, 2 N, 2.5 N or 3 N) that lasted 3 s. At the
same time, in the press condition, the participants pressed their right index finger
against the sensor with force required to match the reference force that they
simultaneously felt on their left index finger. The reference forces applied to the left
index finger were unaffected by the forces simultaneously applied to the sensor by
the participants’ right index fingers, and the participants were explicitly informed
about this so that it would make the task easier. Immediately after the presentation
of each reference force trial, the participants moved the slider of a 13 cm linear slide
potentiometer with their right hands. The slider was placed just in front of their
right hands, so it was easy to reach and use. The slider controlled the force output
of the lever on their left index fingers. The lower limit (left end) of the slider
corresponded to 0 N and the upper limit (right end) corresponded to 5 N.
Participants had 3 s to produce a force that matched the previously applied
reference force. Upon completion of this period, participants were asked to return
the slider to 0 N; thus, every trial started with the slider being at 0 N (left end).
Participants were encouraged to adjust their response in the beginning of the
period to find the force level that best matched the reference force but to keep their
responses stable during the last second of the trials.
In both experiments, participants wore headphones through which moderately
loud white noise was played to eliminate any possibility that the participants could
hear the motor generating the forces. The onset and offset of the periods for the
reference and matched forces were indicated with auditory “go” and “stop” signals.
Moreover, during the base and press conditions of both experiments, participants
were asked to fixate a black cross that was placed on the wall opposite them
(2 m distance), whereas in the motor imagery conditions, they were blindfolded
with a common sleep mask.
Each of the three experimental conditions (see main text above) consisted of 35
force trials, and each of the 5 reference force levels was pseudorandomly repeated
7 times. The order of the conditions was counterbalanced across participants.
No feedback was ever provided to the participants concerning their performance
during the experiments.
Procedures in the imagery condition. In the imagery conditions, the participants
were instructed to imagine pressing their right index finger against the sensor, just
as they actually pressed the finger in the press condition. We emphasized to the
participants that they should imagine performing the movement from a first
person perspective (and not from a third-person perspective) and should imagine
the sensations associated with the movement (i.e., the feeling of force and muscle
contractions in the finger (kinesthetic-motor imagery)) but should not visualize the
movement as though they were watching a video42,75 (visuo-motor imagery). To
make it easier for the participants to understand exactly what action they were
supposed to imagine and thereby increase the vividness of the motor imagery, all
participants first practiced five to ten trials of the actual pressing condition before
they practiced the corresponding motor imagery task. No feedback was ever
provided to the participants concerning their performance during these training
periods. Finally, before the actual force experiment commenced, we asked the
participants whether they could reliably perform the requested motor imagery.
All participants stated that they could perform the imagery task as instructed.
Force registration, processing, and statistical inference. For each trial, we
calculated the average matched force participants generated with the slider during
the period 2000–2500 ms after the “go” signal in accordance with previous
studies30,33. During this time period, the applied force level had stabilized. We then
averaged the forces across the seven repetitions of each level of reference force.
Then, for each experiment, we conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA with
factors (i) the level of the reference force and (ii) the condition. The normality
of residual errors was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. Planned pairwise
comparisons were conducted with two-tailed paired t-tests, as the distributions
confirmed normality. Finally, to compare the effects of imagery between the
experiments, we first subtracted the matched forces of the imagery conditions from
their corresponding base conditions and we then contrasted them with a two-tailed
unpaired t-test, because the distributions were normal and had similar variances.
Force data were analyzed using R (R version 3.3.2, RStudio Version 1.0.136).

 EMG collection, processing, and statistical inference. Surface electromyography
was recorded using the Delsys Bagnoli electromyography system (DE-2.1 Single
Differential Electrodes) from the right FDI muscle after cleaning the skin with
alcohol. The electrode was carefully placed over the belly of the muscle. The signals
were analog bandpass-filtered between 20 and 450 Hz, sampled at 2.0 kHz and
amplified (gain = 1000). An additional notch filter was used to suppress the 50 Hz
power line interference and the DC offsets of the signals were removed.
For each trial, we calculated the RMS of the EMG signal during the full window
(3 s) of the reference force. Then, we averaged the values across the 35 trials of each
condition and for each participant. Planned pairwise comparisons were performed
with either a two-tailed paired t-test or a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
depending on the normality of the distributions. EMG data were processed in
Matlab R2015 and analyzed using R (R version 3.3.2, RStudio Version 1.0.136).
In the base and imagine conditions of each experiment, participants were
reminded to relax their hands and index fingers during the application of the
reference force. To ensure that participants did not contract the muscles of the
right index finger, the EMG signals were always displayed on a computer screen
on-line and monitored throughout the experiment by a second experimenter.
Trials in which there was visible muscular activity were rejected and repeated after
reminding the participants to further relax their right hands and index fingers.
Post-experiment questionnaires and statistical inference. After each experi-
ment, participants were asked to rate their level of agreement for two statements on
a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from – 3 (strongly disagree) to + 3 (strongly agree),
with 0 indicating “neither agree nor disagree”. The two statements were as follows:
Statement 1 (S1). I found it difficult to imagine moving my finger during the
experiment.
Statement 2 (S2). I found that when I imagined moving my finger, the
movement seemed clear and vivid, almost as if the movement were real.
To test for differences in the questionnaire responses between the two
experiments, we used a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test.
Effect sizes were estimated with Hedges gav for paired t-tests and with Cohen’s
ds for unpaired t-tests, as suggested by ref. 76. For the Mann–Whitney U-test and
Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test, effect sizes were calculated as r = Z/√N, where N is the
total sample size of the given test (i.e., N = 24).
