The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy is significantly compromised by medication non-
adherence. Long-acting enteral systems that can ease the burden of daily adherence have not
yet been developed. Here we describe an oral dosage form composed of distinct
drug–polymer matrices which achieved week-long systemic drug levels of the antiretrovirals
dolutegravir, rilpivirine and cabotegravir in a pig. Simulations of viral dynamics and patient
adherence patterns indicate that such systems would significantly reduce therapeutic failures
and epidemiological modelling suggests that using such an intervention prophylactically could
avert hundreds of thousands of new HIV cases. In sum, weekly administration of long-acting
antiretrovirals via a novel oral dosage form is a promising intervention to help control the HIV
epidemic worldwide.

ntiretrovirals have transformed disease management for
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected indivi-
duals1. With reliable life-long adherence to combination
antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV+ individuals have a lifespan
comparable to that of uninfected individuals2. Additionally,
antiretrovirals may be taken by high-risk uninfected individuals
to prevent infection, a strategy known as pre-exposure prophy-
laxis (PrEP)3. When used consistently, PrEP reduces HIV
acquisition rate by 90%4. Despite these developments, the burden
of HIV remains high worldwide. In 2015, 2.1 million people
became newly infected with HIV, and there were 1.2 million HIV-
related deaths5. These findings underscore the need to bridge the
disconnect between availability of effective antiretrovirals and
efficient disease control.
Lack of medication adherence to ART has emerged as a key
barrier to successful HIV treatment6,7 and prevention8,9. The
average adherence rate to long-term ART is ~70%7,10,11 in both
high- and low-income countries, and suboptimal adherence is the
strongest predictor of treatment failure and emergence of drug-
resistant virus12–15. Further, poor adherence has also emerged as
a barrier to successful implementation of PrEP16. For example,
lack of efficacy of various formulations of tenofovir-based PrEP17
in the VOICE trial were explained, in part, by undetectable drug
levels in many participants17 and imperfect adherence was also
implicated for the lack of efficacy in the FEM-PrEP trial18.
Additionally, analyses of the CAPRISA19 and iPrEx trials20
revealed that patients with better adherence to the therapeutic
regimen were more likely to be protected.
Adherence levels are driven by a variety of factors, including
access to affordable medications, stigma about disease status, and
side effects of ART21–23. The high pill burden resulting from daily
long-term HIV medication is known to significantly deter patient
adherence24,25. To overcome this challenge, there has been
interest in developing simplified dosage regimens. One example is
single-tablet regimens, such as Atripla®, Complera®, and Stribild®,
although these still require daily pill administration. Another
recent
breakthrough
is
the
use
of
long-acting
injectable
nanoparticles26–28, which release drug for weeks after intramus-
cular administration29–31. However, their long-term favourability
among patients and their effect on adherence requires careful
assessment, as pain and other injection site reactions have been
commonly reported32,33 and adherence to other injectables, such
as hormonal contraception, is low34,35.
We reasoned that a technology that reduces dosing frequency
and is administered orally could be a promising alternative for
addressing imperfect adherence to ART36–38. However, devel-
opment of such a system has previously proven difficult due to
the limited residence of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract39.
Moreover, although structures with prolonged gastric residence
have been reported40–45, restrictions on materials that can be
used for their construction limit the ability to adequately control
drug release kinetics. For example, we have previously reported
gastric resident dosage forms fabricated from poly(ε-capro-
lactone) (PCL) capable of providing both the mechanical integrity
required for gastric residence and slow drug release for long-term
treatment with ivermectin42. The coupling of mechanical resi-
lience enabling gastric residence with drug release limited initial
formulation to PCL. To develop an orally delivered dosage form
with the capacity to provide extended release of a wide range of
therapeutics in nearly any time release profile, a universal system
capable of accommodating a wide range of polymer formulations
would be required.
Here we describe such a universal system and apply it to the
clinical problem of medication non-adherence in HIV. To
address the challenges of prolonging gastric residence and alter-
ing drug formulations independent of mechanical properties, we
describe here a modular drug delivery system which folds and
recoils, enabling oral dosing, which retains its integrity in the
stomach for prolonged residence, and which can be loaded with
up to six different drug formulations resulting in desired phar-
macokinetics. As a proof-of-principle, we show that this system is
capable
of
delivering
three
highly-potent
antiretrovirals—
dolutegravir (DTG), cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV)—
for a week after a single dose in a swine model.
Results
Design and assembly of the gastric-resident dosage form. The
gastric resident dosage form used in these studies consists of six
arms joined at a central core (Fig. 1a). The central core, made of
an elastomeric material, enables folding of the dosage form into a
capsule and its recoil upon dissolution of the capsule shell in the
stomach. The arms provide rigidity, and capabilities to load and
release the drug (Fig. 1b). To de-couple the gastric resident
capacity from drug release we created a modular system in which
a pocket is milled into the polymer backbone of the arms and is
filled with drug–polymer matrix that controls the rate of drug
release. In this paper, polymers used for the construction of the
polymer backbone are referred to as structural polymers, and
those used for controlling drug release are referred to as release
polymers (Fig. 1b). Adopting this design enabled us to develop a
gastric resident dosage form with the capacity to deliver six dif-
ferent drug formulations from a single structure. Significant
changes could be made to the drug release kinetics and drugs with
different physicochemical properties could be loaded without
altering the core structure of the dosage form.
The method of assembling the dosage form is shown in Fig. 1c
and Supplementary Figure 1. This design allowed us to load the
system with different drug–polymer matrices, each releasing drug
at a different rate. Appropriate combinations of matrices could be
programmed into manufacturing to achieve desired drug release
rates and plasma pharmacokinetics (Fig. 1d).
Material selection and gastric retention. To enable the use of
multiple polymers for drug release, we sought to de-couple the
two functions of the arm: rigidity for gastric residence and
adjustability of drug release. To accommodate this application,
construction of each part of the dosage form with optimal
materials was paramount. Material selection was guided by a
series of mechanical tests as described below.
A four-point bending assay (ASTM D6272 standards) was used
to characterize candidate structural polymers (Fig. 2a). Two
thermoplastic polyesters, PCL and poly(lactide) (PLA), showed
an ultimate flexural stress of ~23.1 ± 0.9 and ~79.0 ± 4.9 MPa
respectively (data is mean ± S.D., n = 4), and a thermoplastic
polyurethane Elastollan®R6000 displayed an ultimate flexural
stress of ~205 ± 14.7 MPa (n = 4). Tensile testing (ASTM D638
Type V standards) was used to evaluate two materials for use as
elastomeric cores: a custom-made cross-linked PCL which was
successfully used for the construction of a previous generation of
these dosage forms42, and a thermoplastic polyurethane Elastol-
lan®1185, due to its ease of manufacturing. Cross-linked PCL had
an elastic modulus of ~12.2 ± 3.6 MPa, while that of Elastol-
lan®1185 was ~27.7 ± 2.2 MPa (n = 3) (Fig. 2b). After seven days
of incubation in simulated gastric fluid (SGF), there was minimal
deterioration in the mechanical properties of these materials.
The system’s mechanical integrity in the stomach depended on
the interface between the structural polymer and elastomeric core.
We used tensile testing to determine the strength of the interface
between the two materials using the same dog-bone shapes
(Fig. 2c). The Elastollan®1185-Elastollan®R6000 interface showed
the highest value for maximum stress (~12.1 ± 1.2 MPa) (n = 3).

 Upon administration, dosage forms experience a continuous
cycling of bending forces in the stomach. To determine their
resistance to these forces, we conducted ‘fatigue tests’ on two
dosage forms (See Supplementary Figure 2a and Methods for
details). The elastomeric cores of both were made of Elastol-
lan®1185, while their arms were made of either PLA or
Elastollan®R6000. The Elastollan®1185-PLA dosage forms failed
in less than 2000 cycles (Supplementary Figure 2b). In contrast
Elastollan®1185- Elastollan®R6000 showed no failure for up to
10,000 cycles, after which the testing was discontinued (Supple-
mentary Figure 2c). Then, the gastric retention of these dosage
forms was assessed in pigs. The results of the in vivo studies were
in agreement with those of the fatigue and tensile tests. The
dosage form consisting of PLA arms started to disintegrate on day
1 (Fig. 2d) and by day 4, half of the arms had separated from the
core. Upon its retrieval from the animal, we found that several of
the arms had broken off close to the elastomer–arm interface
(Supplementary Figure 2d). In contrast, dosage forms consisting
of Elastollan®R6000 arms remained intact throughout the entire
study (Fig. 2d and e, and Supplementary Figs. 2e and f).
We also tested
the force to pass
the Elastollan®1185-
Elastollan®R6000 dosage forms through a simulated pylorus
using an in vitro ‘funnel’ test (Fig. 2f). This test was developed to
provide
ex
vivo
evaluation
of
prototypes
to
aid
in
the
identification of optimal designs and material properties. Our
previous work demonstrated that forces at or above 3 N were near
optimal
to
maintain
the dosage
form
in
the stomach42.
Evaluations were performed before and after week-long residence
in the swine. The force required to pass the dosage forms was
~10–20 N before dosing, and decreased to ~10–15 N post-
retrieval, but remained above the threshold of 3 N (n = 10).
We envision equipping the dosage forms with a safety
mechanism that will enable disassembly in case of premature
passage into the intestine. This could be a pH sensitive linker
connecting the core to the peripheral arms, which is stable in the
acidic environment of the stomach but dissolves in the intestine.
This would facilitate break-up of the dosage form in the intestine,
ensuring its safe clearance. Our group has previously developed
such linkers42,46, and here we present initial in vivo proof-of-
concept. Prototypes were assembled with solid arms composed of
PCL and enteric linkers connecting the arms to the elastomeric
core made of the custom-made PCL elastomer described above.
To
evaluate
the
stability
of
the
linkers
and
provide
an
approximation of an emergent clinical scenario in which an
intact dosage form inadvertently passed out of the stomach, we
endoscopically placed the dosage forms in the stomach and also
in the duodenum. Animals were evaluated twice daily clinically
and radiographically. Dosage forms deployed in the intestine
started to disintegrate within 24 h, and were completely removed
by six days post-administration. In contrast, all three dosage
forms deployed in the stomach remained resident for six days;
two of the dosage forms remained intact, and the third one only
lost one arm (Supplementary Figure 3). Similar safety mechan-
isms can be built into structures consisting of Elastollan®R6000

 and Elastollan®1185. For the studies discussed in this paper,
linkers were excluded to isolate the effect of drug release kinetics
in the gastrointestinal tract.
Development of sustained release drug formulations. Choice of
drugs was based on the recommended daily dose of each drug
(Supplementary Figure 4). Doses of DTG (an integrase inhibitor),
CAB (an integrase inhibitor), RPV (a non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, a
nucleotide reverse transcription inhibitor, and pro-drug of teno-
fovir) were ≤ 50 mg/day, allowing us to load sufficient mass onto
the structure for weekly dosing. To further determine if these
drugs were suitable for use in our system, we tested their stability
at acidic pH (for gastric release) and high temperatures (for
manufacturing
at
elevated
temperatures).
Unless
indicated
otherwise, all experiments described in this manuscript were
performed with the salt forms of the drugs. DTG, CAB and RPV
were stable in SGF for the duration of the study (Fig. 3a). In
contrast, TAF degraded rapidly and only 10% of the drug
remained stable after 10 h of incubation in SGF, leading us to
discontinue further development with this drug. To assess the
stability of the drugs at the elevated temperatures that can be
encountered during dosage form fabrication, we heated each drug
to 150 °C for 2 h. DTG, CAB and RPV were all found to be stable
at these conditions (Fig. 3b); thus, we proceeded with develop-
ment of dosage forms loaded with these drugs. Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the
three drugs is shown in Supplementary Figure 5 and 6
respectively.
We loaded each of the three drugs into a variety of polymer
matrices and tested their release in SGF. We chose three types of
polymers—a poly(ether), poly(anhydrides), and a poly(ester)—
which release drug at different rates. The release of DTG from the
three types of polymers is shown in Fig. 3c. Drug release from the
water soluble poly(ethylene glycol) was rapid, with ~60–70%
of the drug released within the first 6 h (n = 3). Release from
PCL was the slowest, with only 5% of the drug released over a
week (n = 3). Total amount of drug release from the poly
(anhydrides) was nearly 4–8-fold higher than that from PCL, and
the rate of drug release could be altered by changing the
monomer used in the synthesis of the polymer. The more
hydrophilic adipic acid-based poly(anhydride) released greater
amount of drug than the hydrophobic sebacic acid-based
polymer. Similar trends in drug release rates were observed with
RPV (Fig. 3d) and CAB (Fig. 3e).
Pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals. We then analysed the
pharmacokinetics of the three antiretrovirals dosed as immediate
release formulations and in gastric resident dosage forms in pigs.
Manufacturing of the sustained release dosage forms and the
various drug formulations used are listed in Methods and Sup-
plementary Table 1.

 The plasma concentration–time profile of DTG delivered in its
immediate release formulation is shown in Fig. 4a. The drug was
absorbed rapidly, and detectable concentrations were observed
within 15 min. An average maximum concentration of ~500 ng/
mL
was
reached
6 h
post-dose
(n = 3).
On
day
1,
drug
concentrations were low but detectable; however, no drug was
detected at or after day 2. When DTG was dosed in a gastric
resident system, mean peak concentration comparable to that of
the immediate release formulation was obtained within 6 h.
Importantly, throughout the week following dosing, average drug
concentrations of ~200–800 ng/mL were observed (n = 3) (Fig. 4b).
We also examined drug levels in the dosage forms pre- and post-
administration microscopically noting a significant void space in
the arms post-administration (Supplementary Fig. 7).
RPV was also rapidly absorbed from its immediate release
formulation (Fig. 4c). Drug concentrations dropped to below the
limit of detection within 2 days. When dosed in a gastric resident
dosage form, drug absorption was slower with maximum
concentration achieved at 1 day post-dose (Fig. 4d). Drug
concentrations comparable to the Cmax were maintained for the
entirety of the study.
When administered as an immediate release formulation, CAB
levels in the plasma peaked at 6 h (Fig. 4e), and were detectable in
the plasma for up to 2 days. However, no drug levels were
detected at or following day 3. When dosed in the gastric resident
system, average peak plasma concentration was ~2.5-fold lower
than that observed with the immediate release, but sustained
concentrations (200–500 ng/mL) were maintained up to a week
post-dose (n = 3) (Fig. 4f).
Concentration–time curves of individual animals assayed
three times on the LC–MS/MS are also displayed in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8.

 individuals, and thus may also impact the degree of viral sup-
pression. Here we adapt a previously developed framework for
simulating HIV treatment outcomes to predict the impact of this
new formulation47. Our model combined patient adherence
behaviour, pharmacokinetic profiles, pharmacodynamic func-
tions, and a multi-strain version of the well-established viral
dynamic model that tracks mutation and selection between drug-
resistant and sensitive strains (see Supplementary Notes 1). As a
baseline case, we assumed that weekly long-acting therapy has the
same peak and trough drug levels as existing formulations, but 7-
fold longer half-life (Fig. 5a).
Models predict that DTG and RPV given as maintenance
monotherapy
are
similarly
effective
in
their
long-acting
form versus the standard, daily formulation for a range of
adherence levels (Fig. 5b, c, d, f and g). The fraction of treatment
failures accompanied by emergence of drug resistance increases
with
the
long-acting
form
for
RPV
but
not
DTG.
In the conservative scenario of “weekly-choice adherence”, we
assumed that individuals who had, for example, a 70% chance of
taking any given pill of their standard, daily regimen would
also decide with 70% likelihood, at the start of each week, to
either take their long-acting formulation or skip it for the week.
In
the
more
optimistic
“daily-choice
adherence”
scenario,
we assumed these individuals had a 70% chance of taking
the next long-acting dose each day after their previous dose
period has ended. The latter scenario resulted in a lower chance
of individuals going for long periods without drug coverage,
and is predicted to significantly improve patient outcomes
with long-acting antiretrovirals (~6-fold reduction in failures),
even if drug mass in each dose is reduced (Fig. 5e and h).
Population level impact of long acting antiretrovirals. A
particularly promising application for long-acting antiretrovirals is
for PrEP in high-risk uninfected individuals. To gauge whether such
a use case could make an impact on combating the spread of HIV/
AIDS in high-burden countries, we used modelling to estimate how
many new infections could be prevented with the use of a long-
acting oral antiretroviral dosage form for PrEP, as compared to
currently available daily oral PrEP. We started by reviewing a recent
meta-analysis48 which estimated the difference in adherence to daily
versus weekly dosage forms of similar medications prescribed for the
same condition. While the original meta-analysis reported odds
ratios for high adherence (defined as medication possession rate or
proportion of days covered >80%, see Supplementary Methods), we
repeated the analysis to estimate the absolute difference, yielding an
estimated increase of 15% (95% CI: 14–17%) in the highly adherent
population faction (Supplementary Fig. 9) when switching from
daily to weekly dosing. Efficacy of PrEP for HIV prevention is
strongly correlated to the fraction of recipients having detectable
plasma
drug
concentrations,
which
in
turn
is
related
to
adherence. In the Partners PrEP study, 84% of highly adherent
individuals had detectable levels of tenofovir in their blood.
Regression analysis across oral PrEP trials yielded an estimated
1.54% increase in efficacy, defined as the reduction in per-
exposure probability of infection, for every 1% increase in fraction
with detectable drug levels. Combining evidence about the influence
of a weekly regimen on adherence48, the relationship between
adherence and detectable drug levels49, and the relationship between
detectable drug levels and PrEP efficacy50,51 (see Supplementary
Methods), we arrived at a plausible range of 20% (95% CI: 18–22%)
increase in efficacy for weekly PrEP as compared to daily PrEP in

 high-risk populations (blue lines in Fig. 5i and j). However, because
weekly PrEP will likely involve different drugs and may influence
efficacy and coverage in unexpected ways, a wider range of efficacy
and coverage assumptions were input into the EMOD v2.5 micro-
simulation model52–55, a network transmission model of HIV that
includes heterosexual and mother-to-child HIV transmission, cali-
brated to the HIV epidemic in South Africa56–58. Assuming that
availability of a weekly regimen influences only efficacy and
not coverage, the model predicts approximately 200,000 additional
infections averted over 20 years—a 3.4% cumulative reduction—by
making a weekly PrEP formulation available for high risk popula-
tions ages between 15 and 29. Contours (Fig. 5i and j) show the
variability of these estimates under different assumptions about the
increment in efficacy (x-axis), the possibility of increasing PrEP
coverage due to greater acceptability of a weekly regimen (y-axis),
and assumptions whether treatment scale-up could be achieved (left
and right panels). For example, if PrEP coverage were to increase
from 30 to 60% as a result of the availability of a weekly PrEP
regimen, the number of additional infections averted would increase
to between 700,000 and 900,000 (assuming scale-up of HIV treat-
ment to achieve the 90-90-90 goals or maintenance of present-day
treatment coverage, respectively).
Discussion
Engineering- and formulation-based approaches are at the forefront
of efforts directed towards simplifying the antiretroviral dosing
regimen59. To that end, we have developed an orally-administered
platform that can deliver sustained plasma drug concentrations of
three antiretrovirals (DTG, CAB and RPV) for up to seven days
after a single administration event. Several other long acting drug
delivery systems are currently under investigation59, with vaginal
rings60, oral61 and injectable nanoparticles62 being at the most
advanced stages of clinical testing. Treatment with injectable
nanoparticles of CAB and RPV, and vaginal rings of dapivirine have
resulted in sustained systemic and local concentrations respectively,
while orally administered nanoparticles of lopinavir and efavirenz
have afforded enhanced bioavailability and consequent reduction in
dose. However, the approach presented here is distinct from other
strategies in its non-invasiveness and its ability to achieve long-
lasting drug levels in systemic circulation.
The choice of drugs in the current work was motivated in part
by the mounting evidence supporting the efficacy of DTG, CAB
and RPV either alone or in combination (integrase inhibitor
+non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) for maintenance
therapy. For example, the combination of CAB and RPV was
recently tested in HIV-1 patients who had achieved viral sup-
pression63. In these patients the combination was found to be safe
and effective at maintaining viral suppression for up to 72 weeks.
Other clinical trials are underway to evaluate safety and toler-
ability of a combination of long acting formulations of CAB and
RPV
in
healthy
individuals
(clinicaltrials.gov
identifier:
NCT01593046) and their efficacy in patients (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: NCT02938520) that have achieved viral suppression
with an integrase inhibitor-based single tablet regimen. DTG has
also been shown to be effective as monotherapy or in combina-
tion with RPV for treating patients with suppressed viral
loads64–68, albeit cases of resistance to DTG monotherapy are
emerging and its use as such needs serious consideration69–71. In
addition to these clinical studies, a long acting formulation of
CAB has been shown to protect against simian immunodeficiency
virus infection in macaques29,30, providing support for its clinical
testing for PrEP. We do not anticipate all three drugs to be used
together in a single patient.
To evaluate the potential clinical and public health impact of
long-acting
oral
antiretrovirals,
we
employed
established
mathematical modelling frameworks to predict their impact on
patient outcomes and epidemiologic trends. We first examined
the impact of long-acting DTG and RPV in the context of treating
existing infection. We evaluated each drug individually, and
assumed that patients who were completely virologically sup-
pressed by existing combination therapy were transitioned to
long-acting maintenance monotherapy. Predictions for long-
acting DTG and RPV were favourable, especially if individuals
who missed scheduled doses could decide to restart any day of the
week. In reality, drugs may be given in combinations, and may be
used in treatment-naïve patients, altering these predictions.
Adherence patterns may change in more complex ways than
simulated here. Like any model, ours is limited by the availability
of detailed data characterizing pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-
dynamics, knowledge of dominant resistance pathways, and the
reliability of ex vivo/in vivo correlations in viral fitness. The
limited data on CAB, which is not yet FDA-approved, precluded
its inclusion in this modelling.
Evidence from other medications prescribed for long-term use,
and for which both daily and weekly oral dosage forms are avail-
able, implies that adherence to weekly formulations is substantially
higher. We evaluated the potential impact of sustained-release
antiretrovirals used prophylactically on the spread of HIV in South
Africa, an archetypal high-prevalence setting. Mathematical mod-
elling confirms that the improvements in adherence typically seen
with weekly dosing have the potential to avoid hundreds of thou-
sands of new HIV infections. The population-level impact of this
technology would be greatly magnified if weekly dosage forms are
also proven to be more acceptable to end users, enabling admin-
istration to a larger numbers of individuals. This analysis was
performed using efficacy and adherence data from trials of tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate for PrEP. An implicit assumption of our
modelling is that any new drug that would be approved for PrEP
use in the general population would be at least as effective as current
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based prevention. However, to
account for potential differences, we consider a wide range of effi-
cacy values in our sensitivity analysis. Once the pharmacology and
efficacy of the drugs we used in our studies is established, such a
framework can be applied to those drugs as well.
There are several limitations to the current study that need to be
addressed going forward. We used a swine model for studying the
gastric residence and antiretroviral pharmacokinetics, as the
anatomy of the pig stomach closely resembles that of humans72
and pigs used in this study had a body weight comparable to adult
humans. However, gastrointestinal transit time in swine is slower
than in humans73. For instance, in humans fed with indigestible
pellets, 50% of the feed is emptied from the stomach in ~5 h74,
while in piglets fed with pellets of similar density, it can take up to
9 h for 50% emptying73. Moreover, the gastric emptying rate can
depend significantly on the age and size of the animal, and whe-
ther it is in a fasted or fed state. The pigs used in our study were
fed a broad diet, and we did not observe any significant anomaly
in dosage form performance associated with a particular compo-
nent of the diet. However, it is possible that certain diets may
impact the gastric residence of our dosage form, and under-
standing these effects will be key for future development.
Another limitation of using the pig model is that it precludes
evaluating the dosage form in the context of HIV disease.
Additionally, the plasma concentrations of the antiretrovirals
observed in our study were lower than those achieved in clinical
studies involving these drugs, which may be due to physiological
differences between pigs and humans. For example, in pigs the
intrinsic clearance and volume of distribution of drugs such as
prednisolone and cyclosporine A is higher than those in
humans75. To address these issues, further testing in other large
mammals including non-human primates will be necessary.

 Differences between the inactive ingredients used in the com-
mercial formulations and ours could have also contributed to
these differences in pharmacokinetics.
In animals dosed with DTG sustained release dosage form,
there was an upswing in the concentration observed on day 7,
which is likely due to the slowest drug releasing matrix loaded
onto the dosage form [i.e. the poly(sebacic anhydride)-based
matrix]. Removal of this formulation from the dosage form may
result in declining concentrations throughout the seven day per-
iod. Further studies in a disease-relevant animal model (such as
non-human primates) and better understanding of the drug
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties can help guide
future formulation optimization. An in-depth evaluation of
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodyamic properties of these drugs will
also inform best practices in scenarios where the dosage form or a
part of it prematurely passes into the intestine. There is also
considerable inter-animal variability in the plasma drug con-
centrations of the antiretrovirals. This may be because the polymer
drug matrices were manufactured by hand and the variabilities
can potentially be reduced by scalable manufacturing methods.
There are currently some restrictions on drugs that can be
delivered using this platform. During manufacturing and fol-
lowing delivery, drugs are exposed to elevated temperatures,
acidic pH and high humidity making it challenging to deliver
drugs that are unstable under such conditions. Additionally, in its
current state the dosage form can support ~10–30% by weight of
the drug. As a result, only drugs that have a relatively low daily
dose (~50 mg or lower) can be effectively administered. As
highlighted in Supplementary Figure 4, only four drugs have a
dose low enough to be effectively administered using our system,
and of these TAF due to its instability in acidic pH could not be
used with our system. The remaining drugs, DTG, RPV, and CAB
—still an investigational drug—are all being considered for
dual32,33,63,66 or monotherapy29,62,64,65,76 maintenance or pro-
phylaxis, including in combination with each other and models
that incorporate existing knowledge of pharmacometrics and
resistance pathways suggest favourable outcomes. Therefore while
the introduction of more low-dose HIV drugs will intensify the
impact of this technology, it can potentially be developed even
with existing antiretrovirals.
Ultimately, control of the worldwide HIV epidemic requires
innovations to increase the uptake of highly-active ART. We
show here the development of the first orally-available sustained-
release antiretrovirals. This system can currently deliver sustained
concentrations of DTG, CAB and RPV for up to 1 week. Clinical
translation of this strategy would represent a paradigm shift in
HIV treatment and prevention.
Methods
Materials. Poly(lactide) (PLA) was purchased from NatureWorks LLC, USA. All
Elastollan® polymers were obtained from BASF. Dolutegravir (DTG), cabotegravir
(CAB), tenofovir alafenamide and rilpivirine (RPV) were purchased from Hang-
zhou Hysen Pharma Co. Ltd., China. All other chemicals were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich, USA. Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) negative moulds for man-
ufacturing dosage forms and bars for mechanical testing were purchased from
Proto Labs, USA.
Flexural strength of polymers used as structural polymers. Polymers were
selected for use as the structural polymer in the dosage form based on a four-point
bending flexural test. The test was performed on an Instron® 5943 and a servo-
hydraulic 1331 (Instron®, USA) according to ASTM D6272 standards. A 500 N
load cell was used for bars made out of poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and PLA, and a
5 kN load cell was used for bars made out of Elastollan®R6000.
Bars (ASTM D6272 standards) consisting of PCL (Mn ~45 KDa) and PLA were
prepared by melting the polymers in negative moulds at ~100 °C and 220 °C
respectively, followed by cooling at room temperature. Elastollan®R6000 bars were
prepared by extruding the polymer and then injection moulding it in a custom-
made stainless steel die. Extrusion was carried out using an XploreTM twin screw
microcompounder (XploreTM Instruments, Netherlands) at 235 °C and 75 r.p.m.
Injection moulding was carried out on an Xplore™ 5.5 cm3 laboratory injection
moulding machine. The injection moulder barrel and plunger were heated to 240 °
C and the mould temperature was set at 22 °C. The material was injected into the
mould using a ramp function that controlled the pressure. It started at 4 bar for 1 s,
ramped up to 5.5 bar over 1 s, and was held at 5.5 bar for an additional 5 s.
Elastic modulus of polymers used as central elastomers. The suitability of
materials for use as elastomeric cores in the dosage form was determined, in part,
by measuring their elastic moduli. To obtain the elastic modulus of each material,
tensile testing was performed as described in the ASTM D638 Type V test.
For the test, Elastollan®1185 dog bones were manufactured by melting the
polymers in negative moulds at 245 °C and then cooling at room temperature. A
custom-made elastomeric PCL was also tested42. The elastomeric PCL was
prepared as described previously42 by mixing linear PCL (Mn ~45 KDa) with
hexamethylene diisocyanate-mediated cross-linked PCL diol (Mn ~530 Da) and
PCL triol (Mn ~900 Da).
Interface between central elastomer and structural polymer. The interface
between the central elastomer and the structural polymer was evaluated by tensile
testing. Tensile testing was performed as described for the central elastomers in the
previous section. In these experiments, one-half of the dog bones was made with a
candidate elastomeric polymer, and the other half was made with a candidate structural
polymer. The two polymers were interfaced at a temperature above the melting point of
at least one of the polymers for ~30 min, before cooling them at room temperature.
Assessing drug stability. All drugs were converted to their respective salt forms as
described in Supplementary Methods.
To determine drug stability at low pH, the drugs were dissolved in methanol to
form a concentrated stock solution. Methanol solutions were then diluted 20-fold in
simulated gastric fluid, USP without pepsin (pH ~1.2; henceforth referred to as SGF).
Drug solutions were then placed in a shaker incubator (New Brunswick™ Innova®
44, Eppendorf, USA) at 37 °C and 150 r.p.m. At various times, aliquots were
withdrawn and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Drug concentrations in the solution
were analysed using HPLC and reported as percent of the initial concentrations.
HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies Inc., USA) equipped with Model 1260 quaternary pump, Model 1260
Hip ALS autosampler, Model 1290 thermostat, Model 1260 TCC control module,
and Model 1260 diode array detector. The output signal was monitored and
processed using ChemStation® software (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA).
Chromatographic separation was carried out on a 50 mm × 4.6 mm EC-C18
Agilent Poroshell 120 analytical column with 2.7 µm spherical particles.
For DTG, the column was maintained at 40 °C and the mobile phase consisted
of acetonitrile: water (pH 3.5 adjusted with 0.1% formic acid) (25:75 v/v) at a flow
rate of 1.2 mL/min over a 12 min run time. The injection volume was 5 µL, and the
UV detection wavelength of 260 nm was selected.
For RPV, the stationary phase was maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase
consisted of methanol: water (pH 3.5 adjusted with 0.1% formic acid) (43:57 v/v) at
a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min over a 10 min run time. The injection volume was 20 µL,
and the UV detector was set at 290 nm.
For CAB, the column was maintained at 45 °C and the optimized mobile phase
consisted of acetonitrile: water (pH 3.5 adjusted with 0.1% formic acid) (30:70 v/v) at
flow rate of 0.8 mL/min over an 8 min run time. For analysis, 5 µL of the sample was
injected on to the column, and the samples were analysed at a wavelength of 260 nm.
For tenofovir alafenamide, the column was maintained at 22 °C. The mobile
phase consisted initially of acetonitrile: water (pH 3.5 adjusted with 0.1% formic
acid) (100:0 v/v). It was ramped up to acetonitrile: water (pH 3.5 adjusted with
0.1% formic acid) (0:100 v/v) over 3.5 min and held at this ratio for 1 min. At
4.5 min, the mobile phase was brought back to acetonitrile: water (pH 3.5 adjusted
with 0.1% formic acid) (100:0 v/v) over 1 min, and held there until the completion
of the run. The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the run time was 8 min. The injection
volume was 10 µL, and the UV detection wavelength of 260 nm was selected.
To determine the drug stability at high temperatures, the drug was weighed in a
20 mL glass vial, and placed in a convection oven at 150 °C for 2 h. Drug was
dissolved in methanol, and the concentration was compared to that of an unheated
standard of the same initial concentration via HPLC.
Synthesis and characterization of polyanhydrides. Poly(sebacic anhydride) was
synthesized by a two-step reaction as described previously77. Briefly, a prepolymer
was prepared by refluxing sebacic acid with a 10-fold molar excess of acetic
anhydride for 20 min at 140 °C. The unreacted acetic anhydride was then removed
under reduced pressure at 50 °C using a rotavap. The remaining product was
dissolved in toluene and precipitated in ether overnight to yield the prepolymer.
The product was filtered and dried overnight. The prepolymer was then melt-
polymerized at 180 °C under vacuum (~1 mbar) for ~90 min. Every 30 min, the
reaction mixture was stirred and subjected to a strong nitrogen sweep (for ~30 s).
The reaction mixture was cooled and dissolved in dichloromethane. The polymer
was precipitated in ether, filtered and dried overnight before further use.
Poly(adipic anhydride) was synthesized as described by Dinarvand et al78. Adipic
acid was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of acetic anhydride under reflux at 140 °C

 for 4 h. Acetic anhydride was removed under vacuum at 50 °C using a rotavap. The
mixture was then dissolved in toluene and refluxed at 110 °C for 2 h. Using a rotavap,
the solvent was removed under vacuum at 50 °C. The white product was dissolved in
toluene and precipitated in ether overnight to yield the prepolymer. The product was
collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. In the next step, the prepolymer was
dissolved in dichloromethane and polymerized at room temperature for 1 h using
triethylamine (0.4 mol% of the prepolymer), as the initiator. The polymer was then
precipitated in ether, filtered and dried overnight before further use.
The identity of the polymers was confirmed using 1H NMR (Avance 400 MHz
spectrometer, Bruker®, USA). The molecular weight of the polymers was
determined using an Agilent® GPC coupled with a triple detector array 305
(Malvern, USA). A LT6000L mixed high organic column (Malvern, USA) was used
as a stationary phase. The weight average molecular weight of poly(sebacic
anhydride) ranged 9–20 kDa and that of poly(adipic anhydride) ranged 2–5 kDa.
Synthesis and characterization of drug polymer matrices. Drug loaded polymer
matrices were synthesized by melt mixing. Appropriate amounts of drug and
polymer were weighed and mixed in a 20 mL glass vial. The vial was then placed in a
convection oven at 130 °C to melt the polymer. The mixture was then transferred to
a negative mould heated to the same temperature. Once the mould was filled with
the melted mixture, it was removed from the oven and cooled at room temperature.
Drug release studies were performed in SGF supplemented with 5%w/w Tween®
20. The drug–polymer matrices were placed in 50 mL release media at 37 °C in an
incubator shaker at 150 r.p.m. At various times, about 1 mL of the media was
collected and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. The rest of the media was
discarded and the drug–polymer matrix was placed in fresh media. Drug
concentrations in the aliquots were measured using HPLC as described previously.
Manufacturing of gastric resident dosage forms. Based on the in vitro studies, we
selected polymers for the manufacturing of dosage forms. The elastomeric core in the
dosage forms used in our studies was made of Elastollan®1185. Elastollan®R6000 was
used as the structural polymer, and a combination of poly(sebacic anhydride), poly
(adipic anhydride) and poly(ethylene glycol) as the release polymers.
We first manufactured the Elastollan®R6000 arms using a microcompounder
extruder and injection moulder as described above. Post-moulding, pockets were
milled into these arms using an Othermill CNC (Other Machine Co., USA) using a
file generated in MasterCAM software (Mastercam, USA). The arms were secured
in a custom 3D printed fixture in order to allow for repeatable CNC machining.
We developed the capability to machine multiple arms in one run to scale up
manufacturing. The feed-rate of the machine was 75 mm/min with a spindle speed
of 10,500 r.p.m.
The Elastollan®R6000 arms were then placed in the negative moulds, and
Elastollan®1185 was melted in the central part of the mould at 245 °C. Once the
Elastollan®1185 melted, the Elastollan®R6000 arms were slowly inserted in the central
elastomer (about 5 mm) such that they were over-moulded in it. The dosage forms
thus formed were removed from the oven and allowed to cool at room temperature.
Release polymers [poly(ethylene glycol)-Kollidon VA64 (5:1), poly(sebacic
anhydride) or poly(adipic anhydride)] were mixed with drug (40%w/w drug), and
were heated to 130 °C as described before. Different amounts of these mixtures
were transferred to the pocket in the Elastollan®R6000 arms in the dosage form at
130 °C. The relative amounts of mixture used in the dosage forms are listed in
Supplementary Table 1. Once the dosage form was filled with the required amounts
of drug–polymer matrices, it was removed from the oven and allowed to cool at
room temperature. This procedure is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
To make dosage forms with pH sensitive linkers, enteric films were solvent cast
by dissolving an enteric copolymer, L100-55 (Evonik), and an adhesive plasticizer,
Plastoid B (Evonik), in acetone at a 90:10 ratio. Following evaporation of the
solvent a flexible film 500 µm in thickness was formed. The film was cut into
3 mm × 3 mm squares and solvent welded to arms of the dosage form around break
points using 50 µL of acetone. Dosage forms were stored at 23 °C for 24 h prior to
dosing in animals. In the current paper, pH sensitive linkers were introduced in
dosage forms made of PCL, however with further optimization, similar linkers can
potentially be introduced in dosage forms made from other materials as well. We
also anticipate that such dosage forms can be produced at scale using
manufacturing techniques such as injection moulding and extrusion.
Evaluation of fatigue testing of dosage forms. We tested two types of dosage
forms under cyclic loading using a custom-made funnel-shape setup to simulate
folding/unfolding of the structure42. Both types were made of an Elastollan®1185
central elastomer; one group had PLA arms while the other one had Elas-
tollan®R6000 arms. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2a, the structure was placed
on top of a funnel shape on a uniaxial mechanical tester (Instron 5943, Norwood,
MA) and attached to a stainless steel rod using single thread string and Krazy® glue
around and on the centre of the dosage form respectively. This rod pushed the
dosage form through the funnel shape while constraining the structure to minimize
noise during the test. To achieve the most destructive case, the structure was pressed
in the direction opposite to its folding direction. A trapezoidal cyclic displacement
with dmax ¼ 12:94 mm was applied to the structure: (i) pushed down to the funnel
to dmax in 5 mm/s speed, (ii) kept at dmax for 0.5 s, (iii) returned to its un-deformed
shape at 0.5 mm/s and (iv) kept at its un-deformed shape for 0.5 s. dmax ¼ 12:94
mm was chosen so that the span of the structure was at ~25 mm in its folded shape.
The cut-off of 25 mm was chosen based on previous estimates of the size of the
human pylorus79. Three samples of each dosage forms were tested for fatigue.
Funnel testing of gastric retentive dosage forms. In order to evaluate the force
required to pass an intact dosage form through the pylorus, a custom funnel test
was used as described above. Using an Instron machine, the dosage form was tested
in an apparatus consisting of a fixed funnel and a piston. The dosage form was
rested inside the opening of the funnel in the orientation that allows for folding,
while all arms made contact with the funnel walls. The piston was then lowered
causing the dosage form to be folded along the contours of the funnel walls until it
reached the smaller diameter of 20 mm at the bottom of the funnel. The peak force
was recorded after 45 mm of displacement at a rate of 60 mm/min from initial
contact of the piston and dosage form.
Evaluation of pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals. All animal experiments were
approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. In vivo pharmacokinetics were evaluated in an unblinded fashion in
female Yorkshire pigs (50–95 kg) that were randomly assigned to the immediate
release or sustained release groups. Animals were fed daily in the morning and in
the evening with a diet consisting of pellets (Laboratory mini-pig growler diet,
5081), with a midday snack consisting of various fruits and vegetables. Specifically,
the pellets were 5/32” x ¼” length, and consisted of ground oats, alfalfa meal, wheat
middlings, soybean meal, dried beet pulp, salts and other micronutrients.
To determine the oral pharmacokinetics of immediate release dosage forms of
DTG and CAB, 50 mg of DTG and 30 mg of CAB were weighed and filled into
gelatine capsules. For RPV pharmacokinetics, RPV base was dissolved in poly
(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight—400 Da) containing 10-fold molar excess of
citric acid. The concentration of RPV base in this solution was 5 mg/mL and 5 mL
of the solution was dosed in a gelatine capsule. The solution was filled into the
capsule immediately prior to dosing, as a result the capsule did not soften before
administration. To determine oral pharmacokinetics from gastric retentive dosage
forms, the arms of dosage forms (2–3/pig containing 350 mg DTG, 175 mg RPV or
210 mg CAB) were folded into capsule shells immediately prior to dosing. At the
time of dosing, the pigs were sedated using a cocktail of Telazol® (5 mg/kg),
xylazine (2 mg/kg) and atropine (0.04 mg/kg). The capsules containing drug or
dosage form were delivered into the intestine or stomach respectively. At various
time points, blood samples (0.5 mL) were collected from a central line connected to
the external jugular vein or from a mammary vein into BioLegend® Vacutainer
gold top tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Co. USA). Plasma samples were separated
from blood by centrifugation (1800g, 10 min at 4 °C) and were stored at −80 °C.
Atropine can reduce gastric acid production and gastric motility which may affect
the overall drug pharmacokinetics and the gastric retention of the dosage form.
While information about interaction between atropine and CAB is not yet
available, no interactions between atropine and DTG or RPV have been reported.
Additionally, the gastric retention of and drug release from the gastric retentive
dosage forms were evaluated for a week, while the terminal half-life of atropine is
~2 h80. Hence we believe the use of atropine has, if at all, a minor effect on the
overall findings of our study.
Drug concentrations in the plasma were analysed using UPLC-MS/MS. Plasma
samples (100 µL) were spiked with 200 µL acetonitrile solution of 250 µg/mL maraviroc
(internal standard) to cause precipitation. Samples were vortexed and sonicated for
10–20 min and then centrifuged (21130g, 10 min). Two hundred microliters of
solution were pipetted into a 96-well plate containing 200 µL of nanopure water.
Finally, 2.5 μL was injected onto the UPLC–ESI–MS system for analysis.
UPLC separation was carried out on a Waters® UPLC aligned with a Waters®
Xevo–TQ-SMS mass spectrometer (Waters Ltd., UK). MassLynx® 4.1 software was
used for data acquisition and analysis. Liquid chromatography separation was
performed on an Acquity® UPLC CSH C18 (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm particle size)
column at 50 °C. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile spiked with 0.1% formic
acid and 10 mM ammonium formate solution. The mobile phase was flowed at a
rate of 0.6 mL/min using a time and solvent gradient composition. The initial
composition (100% aqueous) was held for 1 min, following which the composition
was changed linearly to 20% organic phase over the next 0.25 min. The composition
was then brought to 100% organic over 1.25 min, held for 0.5 min and finally shifted
to the initial composition and held constant until the end of the run for column
equilibration. The total run time was 4 min and sample injection volume was 2.5 μL.
The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode. Sample introduction and ionization was by electrospray ionization (ESI) in
the positive ion mode. DTG, RPV and CAB were analysed at mass-to-charge ratios
of 420.16, 406.08 and 367.13 respectively. Stock solutions of DTG, RPV, CAB, and
an internal standard maraviroc were prepared in methanol at a concentration of
500 μg/mL. A ten-point calibration curve was prepared ranging from 2.5–5000 ng/
mL. Quality control samples were prepared in a similar procedure using an
independent stock solution at three concentrations (5, 50 and 500 ng/mL).
Each sample was analysed three times. Drug concentrations were considered
non-zero only if the drug concentrations were above the lower limit of detection in
each of the three analyses. All formulations were tested in three pigs based on our
previous studies in the large animal model42.

 Acquisition and analyses of photographs of the dosage forms. Photographs
of gastric resident dosage forms prior to dosing and after recovery from the
animals were acquired using a VHX-5000 Digital Microscope (Keyence Corp.,
U.S.A.) equipped with VH-Z20R/Z20W/Z20T lenses. Photographs were obtained by
automatically stitching parts of the image at a 10 µm step size and were analysed
and processed using an integrated Keyence image analysis software.
