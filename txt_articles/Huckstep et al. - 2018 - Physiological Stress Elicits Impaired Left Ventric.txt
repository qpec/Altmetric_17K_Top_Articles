ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Experimental and clinical studies show that prematurity leads to altered left ventricular (LV) structure
and function with preserved resting LV ejection fraction (EF). Large-scale epidemiological data now links prematurity to
increased early heart failure risk.
OBJECTIVES The authors performed echocardiographic imaging at prescribed exercise intensities to determine
whether preterm-born adults have impaired LV functional response to physical exercise.
METHODS We recruited 101 normotensive young adults born preterm (n ¼ 47; mean gestational age 32.8 � 3.2 weeks)
and term (n ¼ 54) for detailed cardiovascular phenotyping. Full clinical resting and exercise stress echocardiograms were
performed, with apical 4-chamber views collected while exercising at 40%, 60%, and 80% of peak exercise capacity,
determined by maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
RESULTS Preterm-born individuals had greater LV mass (p ¼ 0.015) with lower peak systolic longitudinal strain
(p ¼ 0.038) and similar EF to term-born control subjects at rest (p ¼ 0.62). However, by 60% exercise intensity, EF was
6.7% lower in preterm subjects (71.9 � 8.7% vs 78.6 � 5.4%; p ¼ 0.004) and further declined to 7.3% below the term-
born group at 80% exercise intensity (69.8 � 6.4% vs 77.1 � 6.3%; p ¼ 0.004). Submaximal cardiac output reserve was
56% lower in preterm-born subjects versus term-born control subjects at 40% of peak exercise capacity (729 � 1,162
ml/min/m2 vs. 1,669 � 937 ml/min/m2; p ¼ 0.021). LV length and resting peak systolic longitudinal strain predicted EF
increase from rest to 60% exercise intensity in the preterm group (r ¼ 0.68, p ¼ 0.009 and r ¼ 0.56, p ¼ 0.031,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS Preterm-born young adults had impaired LV response to physiological stress when subjected to
physical exercise, which suggested a reduced myocardial functional reserve that might help explain their increased risk of
early heart failure. (Young Adult Cardiovascular Health sTudy [YACHT]; NCT02103231) (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;71:1347–56)

 P
reterm birth rates range from 5% to
18% worldwide (1). The population of
adults born preterm has risen sharply
in recent decades because modern perinatal
care often achieves 95% survival rates (2).
Multiple studies have described a distinct
preterm cardiovascular phenotype, including
altered cardiac structure and function (3–5)
and impaired exercise capacity (6), as well
as increased risk for hypertensive disorders
and stroke (7). However, as the modern
cohorts
of
preterm-born
survivors
now
approach middle age, the long-term epidemi-
ological consequences of prematurity remain
largely unknown. A recently reported study of >2.6
million individuals born between 1987 and 2012 iden-
tified preterm birth as a novel risk factor for incident
heart
failure
in
childhood
and
adolescence
(8),
emphasizing the importance of research into the un-
derlying mechanisms responsible for increased risk
in this population.
Acute cardiac insufficiency is uncommon in young
adults (9) and a previous cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR) study confirmed that preterm-born
young adults maintain a fully preserved resting left
ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) despite signif-
icant functional and anatomical LV remodeling (4).
Stress echocardiography is a powerful tool used
to unmask underlying cardiac dysfunction that is
well-compensated at rest by assessing the cardiac
response to physiological stressors such as exercise
(10). Because those born preterm have well compen-
sated
resting
LV
function
despite
significant
structural modifications and moderate changes in
myocardial deformation at rest (4), investigating
cardiac functional responses to physiological stress is
essential to more fully understand the impact of be-
ing born preterm on LV function (10). We therefore
used 2-dimensional echocardiography to test the
hypothesis
that
the
LV
of
preterm-born
young
adults has reduced myocardial reserve that results
in
functional
impairment
in
response
to
the
physiological stressor of physical exercise.
METHODS
STUDY
DESIGN. We
completed
YACHT
(Young
Adult Cardiovascular
Health sTudy),
an
observa-
tional, case�control study to investigate cardiovas-
cular structure, function, and physiological stress
response in preterm and term-born young adults.
Participants
age
18
to
40
years
completed
a
detailed multimodal set of study measures, including
24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, cardio-
pulmonary exercise testing, and cardiac imaging.
Ethical approval for YACHT was granted by the
South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee
(14/SC/0275). Study registration was completed via
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02103231).
STUDY
POPULATION. A
total of
149 participants
were recruited into YACHT through open recruitment
in the local Oxford community using posters, mailed
invitations from the John Radcliffe Hospital birth
registries, word of mouth, patient invitation through
the John Radcliffe Hospital Specialist Hypertension
Clinic, and invitations to previous study participants
who had indicated interest in future study participa-
tion. In total, 48 participants were excluded from
this analysis to prevent confounding: 32 diagnosed
hypertensive
participants
recruited
through
the
John Radcliffe Hospital Hypertension Clinic, and
16 additional participants with awake ambulatory
blood pressure measures in the hypertensive range.
Therefore, 101 nonhypertensive young adult partici-
pants (47 preterm-born, 54 term-born) who met the
following criteria were recruited and included in this
analysis: 1) aged 18 to 40 years; 2) body mass
index
<40
kg/m2;
3)
awake
ambulatory
blood
pressure <135/85 mm Hg; and 4) verified birth history
(preterm or term-born). Exclusion criteria included:
1) unwilling or unable to give informed consent;
2) pregnant or lactating; 3) history of acute cardiac or
cerebrovascular event; 4) diagnosis with a disease or
disorder
that could influence study participation
or outcome measures; 5) hypertension diagnosis; and
6) treatment with antihypertensive medication. Par-
ticipants were assessed with a wide range of measures
to
achieve
deep
cardiovascular
phenotyping,
including clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure,
biochemistry, anthropometry, cardiopulmonary ex-
ercise testing, vascular stiffness, multiorgan magnetic
resonance imaging, as well as a full clinical resting
echocardiogram
and
stress
echocardiogram
using
apical 4-chamber views while exercising at 40%, 60%,
and 80% of peak exercise capacity. Cohort character-
istics are provided in Table 1.
STUDY VISIT. Overview. Participants were instruc-
ted to fast overnight for 12 h but encouraged to drink
water to remain hydrated before attending a study
visit at the University of Oxford Centre for Clinical
Magnetic Resonance Research and Oxford Cardiovas-
cular Clinical Research Facility in the John Radcliffe
Hospital (Oxford, United Kingdom). All measurements
were completed by trained study investigators.

 United Kingdom), height was measured to the nearest
centimeter and weight measured to the nearest 0.1 kg
with footwear removed and participants wearing light
clothing. Manual waist circumference was measured
2 cm above the iliac crest, and manual hip measure-
ments were taken at the point of widest overall girth
near the level of the greater trochanter of the femur or
mid-buttock.
Blood pressure. After a 5-min acclimation period,
3 resting peripheral blood pressure measurements
were
recorded
using
a
digital
blood
pressure
monitor (GE Dinamap V100, GE Healthcare, Chalfont
St. Giles, United Kingdom) on the left arm with
the
last
2
readings
averaged
and
subsequently
analyzed.
Twenty-four-hour
ambulatory
blood
pressure monitoring was initiated at the end of the
study visit using oscillometric, ambulatory devices
(TM-2430,
A&D
Instruments,
Abingdon,
United
Kingdom). Correct cuff size was chosen based on
arm
circumference.
Subjects
were
instructed
to
remain still during measurements. Measurements
were
automatically
taken
every
30
min
during
daytime and then hourly from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM.
Subjects
completed
a
diary
documenting
hours
asleep and awake.
Blood sampling. All blood samples were collected
from
the
antecubital
fossa
by
venipuncture
or
indwelling venous catheter. After collecting fasting,
at-rest blood samples, participants were provided a
standardized snack of 2 cereal bars. Samples were
centrifuged within 15 min of collection. Separated
plasma and serum were then pipetted and stored
at �80�C for future analysis. Fasting blood biochem-
istry was measured at the Oxford John Radcliffe
Hospital
Biochemistry
Laboratory
using
routine
validated assays with clinical level quality controls.
Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeo-
stasis model assessment calculator (11).
Resting
echocardiography. Resting transthoracic
echocardiography was performed in the left lateral
decubitus position using a commercially available
Philips iE33 or Philips EPIQ 7C cardiology ultrasound
machine. British Society of Echocardiography guide-
lines were followed for collection of a standard clin-
ical imaging data set to quantify LV dimensions and
systolic and diastolic function, as well as review
valvular function (12).
Cardiopulmonary
exercise
test. Participants
completed
a
peak
cardiopulmonary
exercise
test
(CPET) on a seated stationary cycle ergometer (Ergo-
line GmbH, Bitz, Germany) using a validated incre-
mental protocol, with respiratory gases collected and
measured (Metalyzer 3B, Cortex Biophysik, Leipzig,
Germany). Heart rate was recorded using continuous
electrocardiographic monitoring, whereas the rate of
perceived exertion was recorded every 2 min, and
blood pressure was recorded every 4 min using a
manual
mercury
sphygmomanometer
(Accoson
Freestyle, Essex, United Kingdom). Participants were
instructed to maintain a rate of 60 rpm during the
test, which began with 1 quiescent min of resting
measurements followed by a 2-min warmup with a
20 W workload. After the warmup period, workload
increased to 35 W. To normalize test duration to
approximately
8
to
12
min,
participants
who
reported higher activity or fitness levels had their
workload increased to 75 W after the warmup period.
Workload was then incremented by 15 W each min,
and participants cycled continuously until exhaus-
tion
prevented
them
from
maintaining
at
least
50 rpm. Participants then completed a 2-min cool
down period at 35 W and the rpm of their preference.
Following the cool down period, participants were
transferred to a reclined treatment bed for post-
exercise venous blood sampling.

 Stress echocardiography. After completing CPET
testing, participants had a 30-min recovery period
during
which
they
were
offered
water
and
an
additional cereal bar. Submaximal exercise stress
echocardiography
was
then
performed
on
study
subjects for 3 min at 40%, 60%, and 80% of their peak
exercise
wattage
achieved
during
CPET
testing.
After
participants
exercised
at
each
prescribed
workload for 2 min, and steady-state heart rate was
verified, apical 4-chamber views oriented for optimal
imaging of the LV and pulsed wave Doppler imaging
of mitral inflow were collected at each stage using
either a Philips iE33 or Philips EPIQ 7C cardiology
ultrasound
machine
(Philips
Healthcare,
Surrey,
United Kingdom). Participants were given a 3-min
rest period between each stage. Off-line image anal-
ysis was only performed on images in which heart
rate was within 5% of maximum achieved steady-
state heart rate for a given stage.
DATA PROCESSING. Echocardiographic analysis.
Echocardiographic analysis was completed off-line in
accordance
with
standard
guidelines
from
the
European Association of Echocardiography and the
American Society of Echocardiography (13–15) by a
single blinded investigator to minimize bias and
intraobserver
variation.
The
Philips
Xcelera
3.3
(Philips
Healthcare
Informatics,
Belfast,
United
Kingdom) and TomTec Image Arena 4.6 software
suites
(TomTec,
Chicago,
Illinois)
were
used
for
image analysis. End-diastole was set at the point of
mitral valve closure, and end-systole was set at the
point of minimum LV cavity size. LV endocardial
borders were manually contoured at end-diastole
and end-systole to allow calculation of end-diastolic
volume
(EDV)
and
end-systolic
volume
(ESV).
Resting EFs were then calculated via the biplane
modified Simpson’s method using apical 4-chamber
and apical 2-chamber views, whereas submaximal
exercise EFs were calculated by the single-plane
modified Simpson’s method using apical 4-chamber
views.
Ten
imaging
data
sets
were
randomly
selected
and
re-evaluated
for
intraobserver
and
interobserver
variability.
Intraclass
correlation
coefficients for LV mass, EF, stroke volume, EDV,
longitudinal
strain,
longitudinal
systolic
strain
rate,
and
longitudinal
diastolic
strain
rate
for
intraobserver and interobserver variability yielded:
0.99 and 0.96; 0.89 and 0.85; 0.92 and 0.88; 0.94
and 0.91; 0.93 and 0.86; 0.86 and 0.81; and 0.95 and
0.90, respectively.
Submaximal cardiac output reserve calculation.
Submaximal cardiac output reserve was calculated
similarly to previous studies (16). Briefly, cardiac
output indexed to body surface area (BSA) was
calculated at rest (cardiac index [CIrest]) and also at
40%, 60%, and 80% exercise intensity (CI40, CI60,
CI80) by multiplying heart rate in beats per min by
stroke
volume
indexed
to
BSA,
measured
using
echocardiography.
Submaximal
cardiac
output
reserve (COR) values at 40%, 60%, and 80% exercise
intensity (COR40, COR60, COR80) were then calculated
by subtracting CIrest from the calculated CI at each
exercise intensity (CI40, CI60, CI80). The units for both
CI and COR are ml/min/m2. The submaximal COR
equations are as follows: COR40 ¼ CI40 � CIrest;
COR60 ¼ CI60 � CIrest; and COR80 ¼ CI80 � CIrest.

 STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Statistical
analysis
was
performed using SPSS (version 23, IBM, Armonk,
New York). Shapiro-Wilk testing and visual inspec-
tion were used to assess whether variables were
normally distributed. Direct between-group compar-
isons were performed using independent-samples
Student’s t-tests for normally distributed data and
Mann-Whitney
and
Kruskal-Wallis
tests
for
non-
normally
distributed
data.
Linear
regression
modeling was completed using forced entry with
missing
data
excluded
pairwise.
Standardized
regression coefficients (b) are presented for multi-
variate linear regressions. Pearson correlations (r)
were used for bivariate correlations. The study was
powered at 80%, and p ¼ 0.05 to detect a 0.77 SD
difference between groups for LV exercise echocar-
diographic measures. Where appropriate, compari-
sons between term-born and preterm-born adults
were adjusted for sex by multivariate linear regres-
sion modeling to account for differing sex distribu-
tions between groups. This includes demographic,
anthropometric, biochemistry, blood pressure, and
LV echocardiography measures. Values of p < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS. The gestational age of
the preterm group was lower than the term-born
control
subjects
(32.8
�
3.22
weeks
vs.
39.5
�
1.37 weeks; p < 0.001). The gestational age range for
the preterm cohort was 23 to 36 weeks. However,
80.9% (n ¼ 38 of 47) were born moderate to late pre-
term (32 to 36 weeks), 10.6% (n ¼ 5 of 47) were born
very preterm (28 to 31 weeks), and 8.5% (n ¼ 4 of 47)
were born extremely preterm (<28 weeks). Height
and BSA were lower in the preterm group. There were
no
differences
in
body
mass
index
or
age,
but
between-group sex distribution approached signifi-
cance, with a 30% male preterm group versus a 48%
male term-born group (p ¼ 0.061). Both groups had
similar average awake ambulatory systolic and dia-
stolic pressures; however, the preterm group had
higher resting systolic (119 � 9 mm Hg vs. 115 �
8 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.014) and resting diastolic (70 �
8 mm Hg vs. 66 � 5 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.014) clinic blood
pressure readings (Table 1).
RESTING ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. Altered LV structure in
preterm-born adults. Two-dimensional echocardiogra-
phy of the LV showed the preterm group had a greater
LV mass indexed to BSA (69.1 � 13.5 g/m2 vs. 63.7 �
14.7 g/m2; p ¼ 0.015) and a greater LV mass indexed
to EDV (1.54 � 0.33 g/ml vs. 1.22 � 0.27 g/ml;
p < 0.001). Additional adjustment for systolic blood
pressure
did
not
affect
these
between-group
differences for LV mass indexed to BSA (p ¼ 0.022)
and LV mass indexed to EDV (p < 0.001). Those born
preterm had smaller LV internal cavity diameters at
end-diastole (4.50 � 0.41 cm vs. 4.82 � 0.51 cm;
p ¼ 0.007), with lower EDV indexed to BSA (46.4 �
9.7 ml/m2 vs 52.5 � 12.7 ml/m2; p ¼ 0.037) (Table 2).
Altered resting LV function with preserved EF in
preterm-born
adults. The preterm group had a
higher resting heart rate (68.8 � 24.4 beats/min vs.
58.8 � 16.3 beats/min; p ¼ 0.023) but a similar resting
EF compared with those born at-term (63.1 � 5.4% vs.
63.4 � 4.7%; p ¼ 0.62). However, the preterm group
had a lower E-to-A ratio (1.52 � 0.38 vs. 1.75 � 0.42;
p ¼ 0.013), A velocity�time integral (4.93 � 1.18 cm
vs. 4.38 � 1.12 cm; p ¼ 0.035), as well as an E-to-A
velocity�time integral (2.77 � 0.95 cm vs. 4.38 �
0.74 cm; p ¼ 0.021). Peak systolic longitudinal strain
was also lower in the preterm group at rest (�19.7 �
2.7% vs. �20.6 � 3.0%; p ¼ 0.038) (Table 2).

the EF of the preterm-born group dropped to 6.7%
below the control subjects (71.9 � 8.7% vs. 78.6 �

preterm-born
group,
there
was
a
statistically
significant 3.7% decline in EF when going from 40%
to 60% exercise intensity (p ¼ 0.039). EF remained
lower in the preterm group compared with the term
group at 80% exercise intensity (69.8 � 6.4% vs.
77.1 � 6.3%; p ¼ 0.004). Stress echocardiography
data are presented in Table 3, and EF from rest
through all stages of exercise are presented in the
Central Illustration. Comparisons between preterm-
born and term-born individuals for EF at 40%, 60%,
and 80% exercise intensity were repeated, adjusting
for both sex and systolic blood pressure. EF at 40%
exercise intensity did not differ between preterm-
born and term-born adults (p ¼ 0.387), but was
significantly lower in preterm–born adults at 60%
(p ¼ 0.017) and 80% (p ¼ 0.016).
Reduced submaximal cardiac output reserve in
preterm-born adults. Between-group comparison
at 40% exercise intensity showed the preterm–born
cohort had a 56% lower submaximal COR than that in
term-born participants (729 � 1,162 ml/min/m2 vs.
1,669 � 937 ml/min/m2; p ¼ 0.021). Mean submaximal
CORs at 60% and 80% intensity were lower in the
preterm-born group (41% and 45% lower, respec-
tively) but were not statistically significant (p ¼ 0.057
and p ¼ 0.071, respectively) (Figure 1).

 these parameters against the change in EF from rest
to 60% exercise load (Table 4). Bivariate correlation
showed that LV length and peak systolic longitudinal
strain correlated to acute exercise-induced EF gains
in the preterm group but not in term-born controls.
However, in a multivariate model including both LV
length
and
peak
systolic
longitudinal
strain,
LV
length remained the only significant predictor of ex-
ercise systolic response in the preterm-born group
(b ¼ 0.51, p ¼ 0.036). A linear regression plot of LV
length versus EF change from rest to 60% exercise
load
in
the

group
is

for

and

no

(r2 ¼ 0.02, p ¼ 0.46). Gestational age was also related
to LV length and exercise systolic response in bivar-
iate correlations in the preterm group (r ¼ 0.29,
p ¼ 0.059 and r ¼ 0.67, p ¼ 0.011), and therefore, an
additional
multivariate
model
was
performed
to
explore the independent relationship with exercise
systolic response. In this model, LV length and
gestational age were included as independent vari-
ables, as was systolic blood pressure due to its po-
tential confounding effect on the EF change from rest
to 60% exercise intensity. Only LV length (b ¼ 0.53,
p ¼ 0.016) and gestational age (b ¼ 0.47, p ¼ 0.027)
remained as independent predictors of exercise sys-
tolic response in the preterm-born adults.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated for the first time that pre-
term-born young adults had a significantly impaired
LV
systolic
response
to
physical
exercise
stress.
Structurally, echocardiography revealed that prema-
turity was associated with greater LV mass and lower
LV volumes indexed for body size, as previously
shown by CMR (4). At rest, EF remained fully pre-
served, but increasing exercise intensity elicited a
decline in EF, resulting in an overall lower EF than
term-born control subjects. Submaximal COR was
also lower, and LV length and degree of prematurity
were
highly
predictive
of
this
adverse
systolic
response in preterm-born individuals.
POTENTIAL
MECHANISTIC
LINKS
BETWEEN
PRETERM BIRTH AND HEART FAILURE. Recent large-
scale epidemiological data provided evidence that
being born preterm increased the risk of early heart
failure (8). In line with this, preterm experimental
models in rats showed prematurity-related stress
could elicit LV remodeling and impaired systolic
function before blood pressure elevation. Moreover,
these early cardiac alterations increased susceptibil-
ity to developing heart failure secondary to the insult
of
persistent
hemodynamic
overload
induced
by
angiotensin II infusion (17,18).
It is consequential that the systolic deficits we
observed
manifested
under
moderate
intensity
physical exercise and were clearly evident in this
cohort of healthy, normotensive, preterm-born young
adults, which indicated that, apart from subsequent
pathology or insult, prematurity alone confers this
systolic
impairment
and
diminished
myocardial

 functional reserve. Further decrements over time to
this already marginalized reserve capacity in this
normotensive population would bring peak achiev-
able systolic function increasingly nearer to baseline
requirements
(19). Hypertensive
individuals
were
excluded from this study to avoid potential con-
founding
from
altered
hemodynamics,
treatment
with antihypertensive medications, or other under-
lying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the inde-
pendence of the changes in LV systolic function
during exercise from blood pressure, exposure to
sustained blood pressure elevation or hypertension
might have a greater cardiovascular impact over time
in preterm-born individuals due to this reduced
myocardial
reserve
(19).
These
new
findings
of
impaired systolic response to exercise in preterm–
born adults might help elucidate the mechanisms
linking preterm birth to increased heart failure risk.
Immediate
postnatal
developmental
alterations
appear to be critical for determining future cardiac
risk
and
vulnerability.
Even
modest
prematurity
significantly affects cardiac development (3), which
likely
contributes
to
reduced
cardiac
resilience
throughout childhood and into adulthood. In preterm
birth, the abrupt, premature transition to the ex utero
environment and early reversal of ventricular work-
loads disrupts normal cardiac development and is
understood to produce long-term impacts on the
myocardium. In explant experiments, hearts from
piglets
delivered
preterm
showed
poor
stress
response marked by excessively reduced LV output
when challenged with increased afterload; a hemo-
dynamic challenge similar to physical exercise (20).
Our
new
findings
indicated
these
deficits
likely
persist through development and into adulthood.
Furthermore, a late preterm sheep model showed that
preterm lambs had increased myocardial collagen
deposition and altered cardiomyocyte ploidy, which
suggested an accelerated and potentially disrupted
process of postnatal heart maturation, which might
result in long-term cardiac vulnerability (21). Subse-
quent evidence from human studies indicated that
typical
cardiac
ploidy
not
only
supports
cardiac
development, but also represents a limited cardiac
regenerative capacity from birth through adolescence
(22,23). Accordingly, in those born preterm, myocar-
dial reserve deficits may combine with a further
limited capacity for early life cardiac regeneration,
leading to a compounding of vulnerabilities for future
heart failure.

the LV in 102 preterm-born adults (mean gestational
age 30.3 � 2.5 weeks) versus 132 term-born control
subjects identified a unique cardiac morphology in
the preterm-born group, with lower LV length being a
major anatomical feature (4). Although this present
study showed a similar percentage difference in LV
length in preterm offspring compared with term-born
individuals, the slightly later mean gestational age of
the preterm group (32.8 � 3.2 weeks), smaller sample
size, and increased variance of echocardiography
versus CMR (particularly with apical views) accoun-
ted for the lack of statistical significance. Neverthe-
less, the correlation between LV length and exercise

 systolic response was only evident in the preterm-
born group and might play a future role as a structural
biomarker for risk in preterm-born offspring.
Interestingly, in those born preterm, exclusive
human milk feeding in early post-natal development
was shown to relate to greater LV length and a general
shift toward normalized cardiac structure and func-
tion in adulthood (24). These and other findings
might help direct future targeted intervention stra-
tegies.
The
growing
population
of
preterm-born
adults with increased cardiovascular disease burden
(1,25–27) necessitates clinical risk stratification and
prevention guidelines that include, at a minimum,
basic elements of birth and early life history.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. We designed YACHT as an
observational study around a single, full-day study
visit. Because the exercise stress testing occurred
toward the end of the visit in order not to confound
other measures, not all individuals were willing to
continue with the submaximal exercise testing and
the echocardiography stress testing component. Also,
due to challenges with imaging quality, not all scans
were of sufficient quality for analysis. Finally, the
overall sample size was modest, with a lower per-
centage of men in the preterm cohort; therefore,
p values were adjusted for sex when appropriate.
Despite this, this study was sufficiently powered to
make between-group comparisons for our primary
outcome measure, LVEF, at rest, and at 40%, 60%,
and 80% of maximal exercise capacity using echo-
cardiography, and all scans were anonymized to
avoid bias during analysis, including image quality
assessment.
Due to the retrospective nature of the perinatal
data collection, we did not have complete informa-
tion on perinatal characteristics and complications.
Future prospective studies might be able to address
whether specific early life insults alter LV function.
There was a wide gestational age range in our par-
ticipants, with most of our preterm-born individuals
born moderate to late preterm, which reflected the
demographic characteristics of the general preterm
population (28). Although this made our findings
more relevant to a larger proportion of the popula-
tion, larger studies will be needed to fully explore to
what extent the severity of the LV systolic response to
exercise is altered specifically in very and extreme
preterm-born adults.
Resting
echocardiography
was
performed
per
clinical standards with subjects scanned in the lateral
decubitus position (12); however, upright cycle ergo-
metry and treadmill are the most common clinical
exercise stress modalities (29). We selected upright,
seated cycle ergometry for CPET and stress echocar-
diography to align with clinical norms and to also
minimize torso movement during scanning. Although
all participants received standardized, per-protocol
measurements, the differing posture could confound
the direct comparisons of some resting echocardiog-
raphy versus exercise echocardiography measures,
such as stroke volume (30).
CONCLUSIONS
Preterm-born young adults exhibited a significantly
impaired LV functional response to physical exercise.
This impairment was characterized by a lower exer-
cise EF, which declined with increasing exercise in-
tensity,
as
well
as
a
reduced
submaximal
COR.
Resting echocardiography showed a significant rela-
tionship between birth history and LV structure and
function that was consistent with our previous CMR
findings. Most notably, the novel finding of impaired
exercise response offered insights that might help
explain the recently verified relationship between
preterm birth and increased risk of early heart failure.
Because >10% of young adults worldwide are born
preterm, there is an increasing need for further
research
into
whether
lifestyle
and
clinical
in-
terventions
can
beneficially
modify
cardiac
morphology and function in this growing population
of individuals.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Preterm birth is
an independent risk factor for heart failure early in life. In addi-
tion to altered cardiac morphology, young adults delivered
before term have impaired LV responses to exercise compared
with term-born control subjects, which are evident as reduced
augmentation of LV EF and submaximal myocardial functional
reserve.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further research is needed to
determine whether lifestyle and clinical interventions can
favorably influence cardiac morphology and function in individ-
uals delivered prematurely.
