IMPORTANCE Intensive glucose-lowering treatment among patients with
non–insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of intensive treatment and the association between
intensive treatment, clinical complexity, and incidence of severe hypoglycemia among adults
with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of administrative, pharmacy, and
laboratory data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse from January 1, 2001, through
December 31, 2013. The study included nonpregnant adults 18 years or older with type 2
diabetes who achieved and maintained a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level less than 7.0% without
use of insulin and had no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in the prior
12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk-adjusted probability of intensive treatment and
incident severe hypoglycemia, stratified by patient clinical complexity. Intensive treatment
was defined as use of more glucose-lowering medications than recommended by practice
guidelines at specific index HbA1c levels. Severe hypoglycemia was ascertained by
ambulatory, emergency department, and hospital claims for hypoglycemia during the 2 years
after the index HbA1c test. Patients were categorized as having high vs low clinical complexity
if they were 75 years or older, had dementia or end-stage renal disease, or had 3 or more
serious chronic conditions.
RESULTS Of 31 542 eligible patients (median age, 58 years; interquartile range, 51-65 years;
15 483 women [49.1%]; 18 188 white [57.7%]), 3910 (12.4%) had clinical complexity. The
risk-adjusted probability of intensive treatment was 25.7% (95% CI, 25.1%-26.2%) in patients
with low clinical complexity and 20.8% (95% CI, 19.4%-22.2%) in patients with high clinical
complexity. In patients with low clinical complexity, the risk-adjusted probability of severe
hypoglycemia during the subsequent 2 years was 1.02% (95% CI, 0.87%-1.17%) with standard
treatment and 1.30% (95% CI, 0.98%-1.62%) with intensive treatment (absolute difference,
0.28%; 95% CI, −0.10% to 0.66%). In patients with high clinical complexity, intensive
treatment significantly increased the risk-adjusted probability of severe hypoglycemia from
1.74% (95% CI, 1.28%-2.20%) with standard treatment to 3.04% (95% CI, 1.91%-4.18%) with
intensive treatment (absolute difference, 1.30%; 95% CI, 0.10%-2.50%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More than 20% of patients with type 2 diabetes received
intensive treatment that may be unnecessary. Among patients with high clinical complexity,
intensive treatment nearly doubles the risk of severe hypoglycemia.

C
linical guidelines recommend targeting a hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) level less than 7.0% for most nonpregnant
adults with type 2 diabetes. Although tight glycemic
control may have benefits for some patients with type 2 dia-
betes, achieving an HbA1c level of less than 7.0% in others may
result in higher burden of treatment, higher cost, more ad-
verse drug reactions, and increased risk of hypoglycemia.1-4
In particular, patients with complex health problems, limited
life expectancy, and advanced age are unlikely to benefit from
tight glycemic control and are more likely to be harmed by it
comparedwithyounger,healthierpatients.5-12Accordingly,the
American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Choosing Wisely initiative
advises against use of medications other than metformin to
achieve an HbA1c level of less than 7.5% in most older adults
with diabetes because of the risk of hypoglycemia and other
harms,includingmortality.13Instead,theAGSrecommendstar-
geting an HbA1c level of 7.0% to 7.5% in healthy older adults
with a long life expectancy, 7.5% to 8.0% in adults with mod-
erate comorbidity and a life expectancy of less than 10 years,
and 8.0% to 9.0% in patients with multiple comorbidities and
a shorter life expectancy.13 These recommendations are con-
sistent with, although not explicitly stated by, other clinical
guidelines that promote individualized evidence-based dia-
betes care.14-21 However, despite these recommendations, in-
tensive control remains prevalent among older, sicker pa-
tients with diabetes.22,23
Prior studies22,23 have not assessed the prevalence or ef-
fect of intensive treatment among younger patients or those
using medications other than insulin or sulfonylureas. More-
over, relatively little is known about treatment practices and
outcomes among patients once they achieve recommended
tight glycemic targets. A recent study24 from the US Veterans
Health Administration revealed that treatment is rarely dein-
tensified among patients with very low (<6.0%) and moder-
ately low (6.0%-6.4%) HbA1c levels. In addition to the lack of
deintensification,patientswithcontrolleddiabetes(HbA1clevel
<7.0%) are also at risk for treatment intensification and po-
tentially unnecessary polypharmacy. High rates of redun-
dant HbA1c testing were previously found among low-risk pa-
tients with stable, controlled, non–insulin-requiring type 2
diabetes.25 Such overtesting was associated with treatment in-
tensification, although overall treatment intensity could not
be ascertained. Moreover, that study25 focused specifically on
low-risk patients rather than patients with clinical complex-
ity.Thegoalsofthisstudywerethereforetoquantifythepreva-
lence of intensive treatment specifically among patients with
clinically complex controlled type 2 diabetes and to estimate
the association between intensive treatment, clinical com-
plexity, and incidence of severe hypoglycemia.
Methods
Data Source
We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the
OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW), a deidentified admin-
istrative claims database of more than 100 million individu-
als enrolled in private and Medicare Advantage plans across
the United States (eMethods 1 in the Supplement).26,27 There
was no patient involvement in this study. Study data were ac-
cessed using techniques adherent to the Health Insurance Por-
tability and Accountability Act of 1996, and because this study
involved analysis of preexisting, deidentified data, the Mayo
Clinic Institutional Review Board deemed it exempt from in-
stitutional review board approval.
Study Population
We identified adults (≥18 years old) with stable, controlled type
2 diabetes from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2011,
whohad2consecutiveHbA1cteststhatrevealedlevelslessthan
7.0% within a 24-month period (Figure 1 and eMethods 1 and
eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Date of cohort entry was de-
fined by the second (index) HbA1c test. As shown in Figure 1
and detailed in eMethods 2 in the Supplement, we first iden-
tified 5 297 670 patients within the OLDW who met the Health-
care Effectiveness Data and Information Set criteria28 for dia-
betes between 2001 and 2011. Patients with no HbA1c results
or HbA1c levels of 7.0% and higher were excluded, leaving
619 231 individuals. Most patients were excluded on the basis
of absent HbA1c because the OLDW includes laboratory re-
sults for a convenience sample based on data-sharing agree-
ments between OptumLabs and commercial laboratories. To
restrict the study population to patients with stable glycemic
control, only 329 973 individuals with another HbA1c level less
than 7.0% preceding the index HbA1c within 24 months were
included.
We excluded 12 108 patients with severe hypoglycemia or
hyperglycemiaduringthe12monthsprecedingtheindexHbA1c
because they are at increased risk for recurrent hypoglyce-
mia and likely not subject to usual care; 52 016 patients with
type 1, gestational, nonclinical, and secondary diabetes be-
cause these conditions may have different treatment goals and
natural histories; 10 134 patients with any insulin prescrip-
tion during 120 days preceding the index date because insu-
lin is a known risk factor for hypoglycemia and claims data do
not allow for ascertainment of insulin dose and treatment in-
tensity change; 214 033 patients with lack of continuous en-
rollment for 24 months; 8999 patients younger than 18 years;
Key Points
Question What is the association between and frequency of
intensive glucose-lowering treatment and severe hypoglycemia
among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus?
Findings In this cohort study of 31 542 US adults with type 2
diabetes, of whom 12% had clinically complexity because of
serious comorbidities and/or age of 75 years or older, 731 patients
(18.7%) with high clinical complexity and 7317 patients (26.5%)
with low clinical complexity received intensive glucose-lowering
treatment. Intensive treatment of patients with high clinical
complexity significantly increased the adjusted incidence of severe
hypoglycemia from 1.7% to 3%.
Meaning Clinically complex and elderly patients with type 2
diabetes are frequently treated intensively, thereby increasing
their risk of severe hypoglycemia.

and 1141 patients with incomplete demographic or enroll-
ment information.
Patients entered the cohort once, the first time they be-
came eligible, and were followed for 24 months (up to 2013).
They were stratified on the basis of index HbA1c measure-
ments into 3 categories based on guideline recommenda-
tions for diabetes diagnosis and management: 5.6% or less,
5.7% to 6.4%, and 6.5% to 6.9%.14-20 Patients were censored
on a severe hyperglycemic event because that may precipi-
tate changes in therapy and confound analyses.
Clinical Complexity
High vs low clinical complexity was defined based on the
framework developed by the American Diabetes Association
andtheAGS21asacompositemeasureofageof75yearsorolder
or high comorbidity burden defined by the presence of end-
stagerenaldisease,dementia,or3ormoreseriouschroniccon-
ditions (eMethods 3 in the Supplement).
Independent Variables
Date of index HbA1c test (2001-2011) was recorded to account
for secular trends in glycemic targets, treatment practices, and
glucose-lowering medications and presented in 2-year incre-
mentsexceptin2011.Demographicvariablesincludedage,sex,
race/ethnicity, and US Census region at the time of index HbA1c
test. Specialties of health care professionals seen were mea-
sured for the 12-month period after the index HbA1c test be-
cause patients receiving specialty care may have different dis-
ease severity, comorbidity burden, health care use, and
prescribed treatments than patients cared for by generalists.
Endocrinologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists were cho-
sen because they were the most commonly seen diabetes-
related specialists in this population. Patients seen by mul-
tiple specialists were counted toward each specialty.
Treatment Intensity
Baseline treatment regimens were identified from pharmacy
claims within 120 days preceding the index HbA1c test date.
Diabetes medications were grouped into 9 classes (eTable 1 in
the Supplement); combination tablets were considered as be-
longing to both classes. Treatment changes were ascertained
by comparing pharmacy claims 120 days after vs before the in-
dex HbA1c test date, which accounts for a health care profes-
sional’s review of HbA1c test results (30 days) and an addi-
tional 90 days for the preceding prescription to be completed
until time for next medication fill.
Intensive treatment was defined based on the index
HbA1c test and either treatment regimen at the time that
HbA1c test was performed or treatment change after that
HbA1c test result (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). For patients
with an index HbA1c level of 5.6% or less, intensive treat-
ment was defined as use of any medications on the index
date or treatment initiation within 120 days of index date
because this HbA1c level is below the threshold for treatment
as recommended by clinical guidelines.14-20 For patients
with an index HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, intensive treat-
ment was defined as use of 2 or more drugs at the time of the
index test (because the HbA1c level was also <7.0% before
that test) or treatment intensification by addition of 1 or
more new drugs or insulin after the index date (because

these patients’ diabetes was already controlled per the
guidelines).14-20 For patients with an index HbA1c level of
6.5% to 6.9%, intensive treatment was defined as the addi-
tion of 2 or more drugs or insulin after the index HbA1c test
date (no baseline treatment criterion). The last definition is a
conservative criterion that underestimates intensive treat-
ment as defined by most professional societies that recom-
mend targeting an HbA1c level of 7.0% rather than 6.5% and
may view any treatment escalation at this point to be inten-
sive treatment.15-20 None of the guidelines recommend the
addition of 2 drugs for HbA1c levels of 6.5% to 6.9%.14-20
Treatment deintensification was defined by removing 1 or
more drugs within 120 days after the index HbA1c test date.
Treatment regimens that did not meet the criteria for inten-
sive treatment were classified as standard treatment.
Severe Hypoglycemia
First episode of severe hypoglycemia during the 24 months
after the index HbA1c test was identified by International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifica-
tion (ICD-9-CM), codes 251.x and 250.8 (Ginde algorithm)29
and 962.3 in the principal position of any (ambulatory, emer-
gency department, or hospital) evaluation and management
encounter.
Sensitivity Analyses
To separate the incidence of hypoglycemia caused by sulfo-
nylurea agents vs otherwise intensive treatment, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis for the risk of hypoglycemia (ob-
served and risk adjusted) after excluding 7601 patients
receiving sulfonylurea or glinide drugs after the index HbA1c
test date (eMethods 4 in the Supplement). Furthermore, be-
cause metformin may be used to treat prediabetes and other
conditions, we conducted a second sensitivity analysis that ex-
cluded 5030 patients classified as receiving intensive treat-
ment solely on the basis of metformin (eMethods 5 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as frequencies and means for all variables.
Univariate between-group comparisons were performed using
χ2 tests for categorical and binary variables and Kruskal-
Wallis tests for continuous variables.
Multivariable logistic regression separately examined the
risk-adjusted probabilities of intensive treatment and severe
hypoglycemia. Adjustment variables were set to the sample
means30 of sex, race (white, nonwhite, unknown), house-
hold income, US region, index HbA1c test date, and health care
professional specialty.
Risk-adjusted probabilities and 95% CIs for intensive treat-
ment were calculated for patients with low and high clinical
complexity, adjusting for the aforementioned variables. The
association between intensive treatment and severe hypogly-
cemia was examined in a second logistic regression model in
whichthemainpredictorwasa4-levelmeasureofpatientcom-
plexity and treatment intensity: (1) low complexity with stan-
dard treatment, (2) low complexity with intensive treatment,
(3)highcomplexitywithstandardtreatment,and(4)highcom-
plexity with intensive treatment. Adjustment variables were
settothesamplemeansofindexHbA1clevel,medicationsused
after testing, and the aforementioned variables. Analyses were
conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS In-
stitute Inc), and STATA software, version 13.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Study Cohort
Baseline characteristics of the 31 542 patients included in the
study stratified by clinical complexity are given in Table 1.
Overall, the median age was 58.0 years, 15 483 (49.1%) were
female, and 18 188 (57.7%) were white. The index HbA1c level
was 5.6% or less in 3283 patients (10.4%), 5.7% to 6.4% in
18 014 patients (57.1%), and 6.5% to 6.9% in 10 245 patients
(32.5%). At the time that the index HbA1c level was mea-
sured, 10 370 (32.9%) were not taking any glucose-lowering
medications, 11 883 (37.7%) received 1 drug, 6710 (21.3%)
received 2 drugs, and 2579 (8.2%) received 3 or more drugs.
High clinical complexity was present in 3910 patients
(12.4%) because of age of 75 years or older (n = 3048 [9.7%]),
high burden of illness (n = 470 [1.5%]), or both (n = 392
[1.2%]). Patients with high clinical complexity were signifi-
cantly more likely to be treated with lifestyle management
or only 1 diabetes medication, and had higher index HbA1c
levels, compared with patients with low clinical complexity
who had greater prevalence of polypharmacy and lower
index HbA1c levels (Table 1).
Prevalence of Intensive Treatment
In total, 8048 patients (25.5%) were treated intensively,
including 7317 patients (26.5%) with low clinical complexity
and 731 patients (18.7%) with high clinical complexity
(Table 2). Most patients met the criteria for intensive treat-
ment based on their baseline treatment regimen (6033
patients [21.8%] with low clinical complexity and 620
patients [15.9%] with high clinical complexity); a smaller
proportion had their treatment intensified despite low
index HbA1c level (1592 patients [5.8%] with low clinical
complexity and 139 patients [3.6%] with high clinical com-
plexity). Importantly, 5053 intensively treated patients
(76.0%) did not have their treatment deescalated after the
low HbA1c test result was obtained, with 4571 patients
(75.8%) with low clinical complexity and 482 patients
(77.7%) with high clinical complexity continuing with their
baseline intensive regimen.
The risk-adjusted probability of intensive treatment was
25.7% (95% CI, 25.1-26.2) for patients with low clinical com-
plexityand20.8%(95%CI,19.4%-22.2%)forpatientswithhigh
clinical complexity (absolute difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, 3.4%-
6.4%; P < .001). This probability includes the higher risk-
adjusted probability of intensive baseline regimen among pa-
tients with low vs high clinical complexity (21.0% [95% CI,
20.5%-21.5%] vs 17.3% [95% CI, 16.0%-18.6%]), as well as un-
dergoingtreatmentintensificationdespitelowindexHbA1clev-
els (5.3% [95% CI, 5.1%-5.6%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.7%])
(Table 2).

Intensive Treatment and Severe Hypoglycemia
The overall unadjusted 2-year incidence of severe hypoglyce-
mia was 1.4%, of which 326 cases (73.1%) were documented
during ambulatory encounters, 82 (18.4%) resulted in emer-
gency department visits, and 38 (8.5%) required hospital ad-
mission. Severe hypoglycemia was significantly more fre-
quent among patients with high vs low complexity (112 [2.9%]
vs 334 [1.2%]; P < .001). Among patients with low clinical com-
plexity, the risk-adjusted probability of severe hypoglycemia
didnotincreasewithintensivetreatment(1.02%[95%CI,0.87-
1.17] with standard treatment and 1.30% [95% CI, 0.98-1.62]
with intensive treatment) (Figure 2). In contrast, among pa-
tients with high clinical complexity, the risk-adjusted prob-
ability of severe hypoglycemia increased significantly with
intensive treatment from 1.74% (95% CI, 1.28%-2.20%)
with standard treatment to 3.04% (95% CI, 1.91%-4.18%) with
intensive treatment (absolute difference, 1.30%; 95% CI,
0.10%-2.50%).
The ORs of severe hypoglycemia were 1.72 (95% CI, 1.29-
2.31) for high complexity with standard treatment vs low
complexity with standard treatment groups, 3.05 (95% CI,
1.99-4.67) for high complexity with intensive treatment vs
low complexity with standard treatment groups, and 1.77
(95% CI, 1.12-2.80) for high complexity with intensive treat-
ment vs high complexity with standard treatment groups
(Figure 3). Sulfonylurea and glinide therapy significantly
raised the risk of severe hypoglycemia (OR, 2.19; 95% CI,
1.77-2.71). Patients treated by endocrinologists had signifi-
cantly higher risk of hypoglycemia (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.25-
2.20), even after adjustment for the HbA1c level and medica-
tions used.
To determine whether our findings were driven by use
of sulfonylureas, we performed sensitivity analyses exclud-
ing individuals using insulin secretagogues after the index
HbA1c test date. All results remained consistent, although
not always statistically significant given the smaller sample
size (eResults 1, eTable 2, and eTable 3 in the Supplement).
None of the study results were altered by excluding patients
who were classified as intensively treated on the basis of
metformin use or start only (eResults 2, eTable 4, and eTable
5 in the Supplement).

hypoglycemia compared with patients with low clinical com-
plexity,andtheirriskofseverehypoglycemiawasfurthernearly
doubled by intensive treatment. Intensive treatment did not,
however, significantly increase hypoglycemia risk among pa-
tients with low clinical complexity.
Recent guidelines, issued between 2010 and 2015, rec-
ommend initiation or escalation of pharmacotherapy for
diabetes when the HbA1c level exceeds recommended tar-
gets (6.5% or 7.0%) in patients with low risk for hypoglyce-
mia, low comorbidity burden, and life expectancy consis-
tent with anticipated benefits of glycemic control.14-20
However, 1731 patients (5.5%) in our study, including 139
patients (3.6%) with high clinical complexity, began treat-
ment or had their treatment intensified despite HbA1c levels
much lower than these thresholds. Treatment deintensifica-
tion is also an important aspect of individualized diabetes
management, and clinical inertia encompasses not only fail-
ure to intensify therapy in response to elevated HbA1c
levels31 but also failure to deescalate therapy in response to
low HbA1c levels, particularly if treated with multiple
glucose-lowering medications. In our study, 5053 patients
(76.0%) receiving intensive treatment did not have their
treatment deescalated, including 482 intensively treated
patients (77.7%) with high clinical complexity. These data
are similar to rates reported by Sussman and colleagues24 in
the US Veterans Health Administration. Such failure to dees-
calate therapy in patients with very low HbA1c levels
increases the risk of hypoglycemia, has no proven clinical
benefit, exposes patients to potential adverse effects, and
increases burden of treatment.32
Our study identified several factors associated with
intensive treatment and hypoglycemia. Women and non-
white patients were less likely to be treated intensively,
which may reflect underlying disparities in diabetes
care.33,34 Patients treated by endocrinologists and nephrolo-
gists were more likely to be treated intensively, consistent
with prior studies35,36 and possibly attributable to greater
emphasis on lowering HbA1c levels to reduce complications
or a focus on treating diabetes without placing it in the con-
text of multiple potentially competing diseases. Patients
under endocrinology and nephrology care were also more
likely to experience severe hypoglycemia even after treat-
ment intensity and medical complexity were accounted for,
warranting further investigation.
Furthermore, we examined the often concurrent effects
of sulfonylurea use and intensive treatment on hypoglyce-
mia. We were concerned to find significantly more sulfonyl-
urea and glinide use among patients with high clinical com-
plexity (6294 low complexity patients [22.8%] and 1307 high
complexity patients [33.4%] were treated with either sulfo-
nylurea or glinide after the index HbA1c test), despite the AGS
strongly advising against sulfonylurea use by elderly
individuals.37 As expected, sulfonylureas increased hypogly-
cemiariskirrespectiveoftreatmentintensity.However,wealso
found that patients with high clinical complexity had signifi-
cantly higher rates of severe hypoglycemia even without sul-
fonylurea use, and intensive treatment that does not include
sulfonylureas may further elevate hypoglycemia risk.
The rates of intensive treatment decreased during the
study, particularly after 2009. This finding may be attribut-
able to increasing uncertainty about long-term benefits of tight
glycemic control4,38,39 and awareness of hypoglycemia risk
posed by targeting HbA1c levels less than 6.5% to 7.0%.2,3 How-
ever, the association between intensive treatment and hypo-
glycemia remained unchanged over time, despite more preva-
lent use of novel glucose-lowering agents with lesser risk of
hypoglycemia.36,40,41 Intensive treatment with any glucose-
lowering drugs, even those not typically associated with hy-
poglycemia, should therefore be prescribed with caution, par-
ticularly to patients with high clinical complexity.
Our study has several important limitations, including
stringent inclusion criteria that restricted the population to

or older or high comorbidity burden defined by presence of end-stage renal
disease, dementia, or 3 or more chronic conditions (myocardial infarction,
congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, non–end-stage chronic renal

intensification despite a low index HbA1c result. Risk-adjusted probabilities are

patients with type 2 diabetes who achieved and maintained
glycemic control without use of insulin. Patients receiving
insulin therapy at baseline were excluded because insulin
may precipitate hypoglycemia for reasons beyond intensive
treatment (eg, missed meals, illness, physical activity) and
insulin dose changes cannot be reliably captured by phar-
macy claim data. Because the study cohort was derived
from a data set of privately insured and Medicare Advantage
beneficiaries, the unadjusted rates of intensive treatment
and severe hypoglycemia may not be directly generalizable
to the broader US or international population. The associa-
tion between intensive treatment and severe hypoglycemia,
however, is likely comparable once pertinent covariates are
accounted for. Another limitation stems from the fact that
we considered treatment change that occurred within 120
days of the HbA1c test but measured rates of severe hypogly-
cemia during 2 years of follow-up, which may miss patients
who received standard treatment at the time of cohort entry
but were intensified later, causing hypoglycemia. Con-
versely, patients who were intensively treated at baseline
and had treatment deintensified later may have avoided
hypoglycemia, thereby decreasing the measured association
between intensive treatment and severe hypoglycemia.
Individuals who may have died during follow-up were
excluded because of lack of continuous enrollment. Finally,
not all hypoglycemic events culminate in a clinical encoun-
ter, which would underestimate the incidence of severe
hypoglycemia, particularly among younger and healthier

patients, because frail and elderly patients and those with-
out readily available support are more likely to require
medical attention for severe hypoglycemia.
Conclusions
Intensive glucose-lowering therapy is common, including
among older adults and those with high a burden of comor-
bidity. Although young and relatively healthy patients may
tolerate intensive treatment, it nearly doubles the risk of
severe hypoglycemia among elderly patients and patients
with clinical complexity, yet it has uncertain short- and long-
term benefits in this population. Individualized assessment
of clinical complexity, in addition to careful consideration of
likely risks and benefits of intensive glucose-lowering
therapy, is therefore an important part of patient-centered
diabetes management.

LESS IS MORE
Deintensification of Routine Medical Services
The Next Frontier for Improving Care Quality
Eve A. Kerr, MD, MPH; Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MS
The study by McCoy and colleagues1 in this issue of JAMA
Internal Medicine adds to an increasing body of research2-4
that older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often
receive unnecessarily intensive treatment. The authors
found that nearly 20% of patients with clinical complexity
(75 years or older or with multiple comorbidities) with a
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level less than 7.0% are receiving
intensive oral treatment regimens (they excluded patients
taking insulin at baseline). Furthermore, patients with clini-
cal complexity had a higher
likelihood of severe hypo-
glycemia, even if their treat-
ments did not meet the definition of high intensity. The
results were consistent regardless of medications used,
although one-third of patients with clinical complexity were
treated with sulfonylureas, despite guidelines advising
against their use. Moreover, more than three-quarters of
intensively treated patients did not have their treatments
deintensified after testing revealed a low HbA1c level. This
finding is consistent with research by Sussman et al,5 who
found that once intensive treatments are started, even older
patients with very tight control (eg, HbA1c level <6.0%)
rarely have medications deintensified.
There is an increasing consensus that overtreatment
and overtesting expose some patients to services they may
not need or prefer or that may harm them. This consensus
first achieved national prominence with the Choosing
Wisely campaign, and in fact, the American Geriatric Soci-
ety has a Choosing Wisely recommendation on avoiding
intensive medication treatment for diabetes in most older
adults.6 The preponderance of recommendations for
decreasing overuse focus on avoiding one-time diagnostic
procedures or treatment at the beginning of a discrete epi-
sode of care, such as not treating with antibiotics for acute
sinusitis. However, a substantial amount of health care
involves the long-term use of medical interventions for
chronic and ongoing conditions, such as diabetes. Little
guidance exists on when physicians and patients should
begin the process for deintensifying medical services—
stopping or scaling back the intensity or frequency of medi-
cal interventions that are currently part of a patient's ongo-
ing management.
