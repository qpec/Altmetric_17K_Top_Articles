of wine?

Abstract
Background: In contrast to our knowledge about the number of cancers attributed to smoking, the number of
cancers attributed to alcohol is poorly understood by the public. We estimate the increase in absolute risk of cancer
(number of cases per 1000) attributed to moderate levels of alcohol, and compare these to the absolute risk of
cancer attributed to low levels of smoking, creating a ‘cigarette-equivalent of population cancer harm’.
Methods: Alcohol and tobacco attributable fractions were subtracted from lifetime general population risks of
developing alcohol- and smoking-related cancers, to estimate the lifetime cancer risk in alcohol-abstaining non-
smokers. This was multiplied by the relative risk of drinking ten units of alcohol or smoking ten cigarettes per week,
and increasing levels of consumption.
Results: One bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime cancer risk for non-smokers
of 1.0% (men) and 1.4% (women). The overall absolute increase in cancer risk for one bottle of wine per week
equals that of five (men) or ten cigarettes per week (women). Gender differences result from levels of moderate
drinking leading to a 0.8% absolute risk of breast cancer in female non-smokers.
Conclusions: One bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime risk of alcohol-related
cancers in women, driven by breast cancer, equivalent to the increased absolute cancer risk associated with ten
cigarettes per week. These findings can help communicate that moderate levels of drinking are an important public
health risk for women. The risks for men, equivalent to five cigarettes per week, are also of note.

Background
The health risks of smoking are indisputable and well
understood by the public. Tobacco use accounts for 7
million deaths per year globally with an estimated two
thirds of smokers expected to die from their habit [1, 2].
Smoking is responsible for 22% of cancer deaths world-
wide [3]. Heavy taxes, advertising bans, plain packaging
containing explicit health warnings, and a ban on smok-
ing in public places has led to a decrease in smoking
prevalence from 46% (1974) to 19% (2014) [4], and over
70% of the population now understand smoking to be a
major cause of cancer compared with 40% in 1966 [5].
For many years the tobacco industry tried to suppress
information linking tobacco use and cancer [6], and
there is evidence that the alcohol industry are currently
employing similar tactics [7, 8].
Each year approximately 3.3 million deaths occur due
to the harmful use of alcohol, corresponding to 5.9% of
all deaths globally [9]. Furthermore alcohol was the lead-
ing cause of death among 15–49 year olds worldwide in
2016 [10]. It is estimated that alcohol use lead to
167,000 years of working life lost (YWLL) in England in
2015, 16% of the total and more than that for the ten

 most frequent cancers combined [11]. However alcohol
is generally perceived as being comparatively less harmful
by the public, particularly in terms of cancer, despite being
directly linked to carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx,
oesophagus, colorectum, liver and breast [12–14]. In a re-
cent survey of 2100 adults only 13% named cancer as a
health risk of hazardous drinking, and when presented
with a list of alcohol-related cancers only 18 and 40% cor-
rectly identified breast and colorectal cancer respectively,
despite alcohol being linked to 3200 and 4800 cases of
each per year in the United Kingdom (UK) [15].
All known alcohol-related cancers have been shown to
have a modest, but increased relative risk (RR) of inci-
dence at moderate levels of drinking (Additional file 1:
Table S1) [13, 14, 16]. There is now robust evidence that
low levels of alcohol intake do not provide any protect-
ive health benefits [10], and The World Health Organ-
isation (WHO) International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC), World Cancer Research Fund and
American Institute for Cancer Research have all stated
that no level of alcohol consumption is completely safe
[12, 17–19]. This led to recent reform of the 1995 UK
sensible drinking guidelines to state that any level of
alcohol consumption can be associated with range of
cancers and there is no justification for drinking for
health reasons [20].
The aim of this study was to estimate the increase in
absolute risk of developing cancer as a result of drinking
moderate levels of alcohol in men and women, and com-
pare this to the increase in absolute risk of developing
cancer secondary to smoking. In essence, we aim to an-
swer the question: ‘Purely in terms of cancer risk - how
many cigarettes are there in a bottle of wine’?
Methods
In order to calculate the absolute increase in lifetime
cancer risk (AR) resulting from consumption of ten
units of alcohol (one bottle of wine) or ten cigarettes per
week we began by subtracting the sum of the Alcohol
Attributable Fraction (FAA) (Alcohol Attributable Frac-
tion for England 2013) [21] for all known alcohol-related
cancers
and
Tobacco
Attributable
Fractions
(FTA)
(Tobacco-attributable cancer burden in the UK) [22] for
all tobacco-related cancers from the overall lifetime risk
(R0) of cancer (Cancer Research UK (CRUK) 2010) [23]
for the general population (Additional file 1: Table S2).
This allowed us to calculate the lifetime risk of cancer in
alcohol-abstaining never smokers (RANS), according to
the expression: RANS = R0 – R0FAA – R0FTA, or alterna-
tively: RANS = R0(1 – (FAA + FTA)) (Fig. 1). Lifetime can-
cer risk calculations were performed by the CRUK
Cancer Intelligence Team based on data provided by the
Office for National Statistics, ISD Scotland, Welsh Can-
cer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit, and the Northern
Ireland Cancer Registry, (December 2013 to July 2014).
The methodology used is described by Sasieni et al. [24].
There is well-established synergy between alcohol and
tobacco consumption for oropharyngeal and gastrointes-
tinal (GI) tract cancer [25, 26]. Therefore the sum of the
FAA (calculated from a population of smokers and
non-smokers) [21], and FTA (calculated from a popula-
tion
of
drinkers
and
non-drinkers)
[22],
would
over-estimate their combined contribution towards can-
cer risk. We therefore adjusted for this by multiplying
the FAA by the frequency of alcohol-consumers who are
never-smokers (53%), and the FTA by the frequency of
smokers who do not consume alcohol (12%), for cancers

 in which both alcohol and tobacco are known risk fac-
tors (Additional file 1: Table S2). These data were taken
from the Health Survey for England data for the years
2011–14 (Public Health England) (Additional file 1:
Table S3) [27].
We then multiplied the lifetime risk of cancer in
never-smoking non-drinkers by the percentage increase in
RR (calculated as: (RR-1)*100) of drinking ten (approxi-
mately one bottle of wine) and 30 (approximately three
bottles of wine) units of alcohol per week (Alcohol Attrib-
utable Fraction for England 2008) [28] (Additional file 1:
Table S1) to estimate the increase in absolute lifetime risk
(expressed as a percentage) of developing cancer for this
level of consumption in non-smokers (Fig. 1, Additional
file 1: Table S4). The same method was used to calculate
the percentage increase in absolute lifetime risk of smok-
ing ten or 30 cigarettes per week in non-drinkers (Add-
itional file 1: Table S4).
RR data for the consumption of ten units of alcohol
per week was derived from studies which had adjusted
for smoking in the case of upper aerodigestive tract can-
cers [13]. RR data for smoking was taken from studies
which had adjusted for alcohol [29, 30], or excluded ei-
ther daily drinkers [31], or all drinkers [32]. The percent-
age RR of smoking ten cigarettes per week were
calculated using figures from the largest and most recent
meta-analyses, case-control, or cohort studies available
describing the risk of smoking according to frequency of
cigarettes smoked, and where the primary end point was
cancer incidence (Additional file 1: Table S5). Starting
with the risk of smoking approximately five cigarettes
per day (35 cigarettes per week), generally the lowest
level of risk detailed in these studies, we estimated the
RR of smoking just ten cigarettes per week using a log
transformation (Additional file 1: Table S5, Additional
File 2).
It is generally assumed smokers are dependent daily
users, with tobacco consumption measured in cigarettes
per day, despite an increasing prevalence of non-daily
smokers
in
western
countries
[33].
However
in
non-dependent drinkers, alcohol consumption varies
day-to-day and weekly consumption is the normal
metric, one UK unit = 1 cl (8 g alcohol). In this study we
discuss relatively low levels of alcohol and cigarette con-
sumption and for ease of comparison we use weekly
measures
familiar
to
the
general
public
for
both
throughout, and estimate a bottle of wine contains ten
units = 10 cl (80 g alcohol). In an analysis of data from
the Health Survey for England, the mean alcohol intake
in hazardous drinkers was around 27 units per week; so
as a further comparator we use three bottles of wine, or
30 units per week [34].
Some of the relative risk data from epidemiology stud-
ies are heterogeneous, and as a result any calculation
must be inexact to some extent, and attempts to calcu-
late confidence intervals are likely to give a misleading
impression of precision. We therefore performed a sen-
sitivity analysis reducing FAA, FTA and the calculated RR
of drinking ten units of alcohol, or smoking ten ciga-
rettes per week, by a factor of 50% for cancers in which
both alcohol and tobacco contribute (Additional file 1:
Table S6).
Results
Absolute lifetime risk of cancer due to drinking one
bottle of wine per week in non-smokers
In non-smoking men the increase in the absolute life-
time risk of cancer from drinking one bottle of wine per
week was 1.0%. For non-smoking women this was
approximately 50% higher with an increase in absolute
cancer risk of 1.4% (Additional file 1: Table S4, Fig. 2).
In men this risk is due to cancers of the GI tract (oro-
pharynx,
oesophageal,
colorectal,
liver),
whereas
in
women breast cancer accounts for 55% of additional
cases. This is relevant because smoking is also an im-
portant cause of GI tract cancer, but not breast cancer.
If 1000 men and 1000 women each drank one bottle of
wine per week, we estimate around ten men and 14
women would develop cancer as a result.
A direct comparison of the percentage increase in ab-
solute lifetime risk of all alcohol and tobacco-related
cancers for smoking ten cigarettes per week, or drinking
ten units of alcohol per week revealed that low levels of
smoking carried the greatest risk for men (2.1% AR per
ten cigarettes, 1.0% AR per ten units of alcohol), with
the risk spread throughout the smoking-related cancers.
The increase in absolute lifetime cancer risk for consum-
ing ten cigarettes per week compared with ten units of
alcohol for women however was comparable (1.5% AR
per ten cigarettes, 1.4% AR per ten units of alcohol) as a
result of breast cancer incidence being partly driven by
alcohol (Additional file 1: Table S4).
As alcohol consumption increases, differences in abso-
lute lifetime risk of alcohol-related cancer between men
and women become elevated. Drinking three bottles of
wine per week (approximately half a bottle per day), is
associated with in absolute lifetime cancer risk to 1.9%
for men and 3.6% for women, again due to a significant
risk of breast cancer (2.4%) (Additional file 1: Table S4,
Fig.
3).
Therefore
if
1000 male
and
1000 female
non-smokers drink three bottles of wine per week
throughout their lives, around 19 men and 36 women
may develop an alcohol-related cancer as a result. The
increase in absolute lifetime risks of cancer due to smok-
ing are greater for men compared to women, for nearly
all non-female cancers (Additional file 1: Table S4). As
breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer
for women, and is attributable to alcohol and not

 smoking, a gender gap in smoking-related absolute can-
cer risk can be seen in alcohol abstainers, which widens
with increasing levels of tobacco exposure (Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3, Appendix).
In terms of cancer risk, how many cigarettes are there in
a bottle of wine?
The increase in absolute cancer risk of drinking one bottle
of wine per week is roughly equivalent to five cigarettes per
week (4.7) for men ((1.0/2.1) × 10), and ten cigarettes (9.5)
for women ((1.4/1.5) × 10). Drinking three bottles of wine a
week, a representative consumption in hazardous drinkers,
carries the same increase in absolute cancer risk of smoking
roughly eight cigarettes per week for men, and 23 per week
for women (approximately one packet) (Fig. 3).
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis adjustments led to a reduction in all
absolute lifetime cancer risks (men: 1.7% AR per ten cig-
arettes, 0.6% AR per ten units alcohol; women: 1.2% AR
per ten cigarettes, 1.2% AR per ten units alcohol). Con-
sumption of ten units of alcohol per week carried an
equivalent increase in absolute cancer risk to four ciga-
rettes per week for men (3.5), and ten cigarettes per
week for women (9.8), as breast cancer risks did not re-
quire adjustment.

 Discussion
We must first be absolutely clear that this study is not
saying that drinking alcohol in moderation is in any way
equivalent to smoking. Smoking kills up to two thirds of
its users [2], and cancer is just one of the many serious
health consequences. This study purely addresses cancer
risk in isolation. The UK chief medical officer’s moderate
drinking guideline of 14 units per week is set at a level at
which there is a 1 % absolute risk of mortality from alco-
hol [35]. Furthermore the average consumption of ciga-
rettes by smokers is around 80 per week in the UK and
100 per week in the United States (US) [36], far greater
than our cigarette equivalent for moderate drinkers.
Using previously published resources reporting life-
time cancer risk, alcohol and tobacco attributable frac-
tions and relative risk data for low to moderate levels of
drinking and smoking, we have been able to estimate the
approximate
absolute
lifetime
risk
of
cancer
in
a
non-smoking
population,
associated
with
moderate
levels of alcohol consumption, and derive a cigarette
equivalent in terms of harm. The ‘cigarette equivalent’ of
a bottle of wine is five cigarettes for men and ten for
women. The absolute risk of cancer increases with in-
creasing
alcohol
consumption
and
the
gender gap
widens as a result of the association between alcohol
and breast cancer. These figures occur on a background
of a steady increase in alcohol consumption among
women [37]. The latest survey estimates of alcohol con-
sumption for 16–75 year old women in England is 1.4
units per day (ten units per week) [21]. Survey data
underestimate intake, partly due to variations of units
per glass of wine or pint of beer, and account for only
50% of alcohol consumption as measured by Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) duty receipts.
On this basis the average alcohol consumption for fe-
male drinkers is at least ten units per week. Given the
approximate number of women in the UK aged 16–75 is
23,809,000 [38], current average levels of alcohol intake
could result in around 339,000 extra cancers. It is also
worth considering that there is a higher incidence of
smoking among social drinkers compared to alcohol ab-
stainers [39]. This is important as smoking can substan-
tially increase the carcinogenic risk associated with
alcohol consumption, particularly for cancers of the
upper aerodigestive tract [25, 26].
While the association between hazardous drinking and
breast cancer is well established [12, 14], a number of
studies have highlighted a risk with low to moderate levels
of alcohol consumption [14, 16, 40, 41]. A pooled analysis
from 53 studies recruiting 58,515 women with breast can-
cer was the first to reveal that moderate levels of alcohol
are associated with increased RR of developing breast can-
cer independent of smoking [14]. The UK’s Million
Women Study reported an excess incidence of 15 per
1000 cancer cases for each additional alcoholic drink
consumed per day, 11 due to breast cancer [14, 16]. These
figures are comparable to our findings of 14 extra cancers
per 1000 women drinking ten units per week (eight due to
breast cancer) in non-smokers. The latest results from the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition, found an elevated hazard ratio for developing
breast cancer of 4.2% for every 10 g (1.25 units) of alcohol
consumed per day [40]. More recently Cao et al. presented
data from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Profes-
sionals Follow-up Study and demonstrated just one
alcoholic drink per day
could
increase the
RR
of
alcohol-related cancers independent of smoking [41].
Again this was driven by breast cancer and restricted to
women [41]. While these studies support our data, our
study is the first description of a percentage increase in
absolute lifetime risk of cancer related to alcohol and the
only study to provide a ‘cigarette equivalent’ of harm.
Rising levels of alcohol consumption over the past
decade, are likely to be an important factor in the over
30% rise in breast cancer incidence in England (36,509
registrations in 2003, 55,122 in 2015) [42]. Breast cancer
is now the most common cancer in UK women [43].
Exceptional efforts have been made to improve survival,
however 11,563 women still died from breast cancer in
the UK in 2016 and treatment carries a huge cost bur-
den [42]. The benefits of increasing public awareness of
the risks of moderate drinking could therefore be im-
mense. It is important to educate women that an
increased risk of breast cancer is not restricted to haz-
ardous and harmful drinkers, and the messaging needs
to be simple, relevant and memorable. Furthermore we
hope this data will inform Chief Medical Officers of fur-
ther opportunities for prevention of cancer at a popula-
tion level.
It
is
interesting
to
consider
that
the
list
of
alcohol-related cancers selected by the WHO IARC may
be conservative, as several other cancers have recently
been identified as having a dose-risk relationship to alco-
hol including melanoma, cancer of the gallbladder, pan-
creas, lung and prostate [44, 45]. Furthermore where
papers
have
controlled
for
the
‘sick-quitter’
effect,
alcohol-related RRs of developing cancer are substan-
tially higher [45]. These two factors suggest that the can-
cer risk associated with moderate levels of drinking
described in this paper may be underestimated for both
men and women, although the gender gap may be
smaller.
There are caveats with the methodology used in the
study. Ideally all our risk estimates would have been
calculated from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
alcohol consumption in non-smoking men and women,
and cigarette consumption in teetotal men and women.
While these data are available in a few individual studies,
Hydes et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:316 
Page 5 of 8
 systematic review data are not available for subgroups of
cancer type.
We have therefore estimated the risks for each cancer
type using the most recent and robust available data and
by making a number of assumptions. The data on RRs
for cancer are extremely heterogenous, and while the
original studies controlled for the use of other sub-
stances, our methodology does not account for synergies
between RRs of alcohol and tobacco. In order to remove
some of the confounding influence where these two risk
factors co-exist, we adjusted the FAA and FTA to include
non-smokers and non-drinkers only in alcohol-related
and smoking-related cancers respectively and used ad-
justed RR data. We acknowledge however that the alco-
hol history of smokers is generally less accurate, and
that a higher proportion of smokers may have previously
been heavy drinkers. This factor may have led to a minor
underestimate of the combined cancer risk. Furthermore
FAA and alcohol-related RRs for cancer are derived
largely from mortality, rather than morbidity data, and
are therefore both likely to be underestimated, particu-
larly in the case of breast cancer where the ratio of inci-
dence to mortality is high (Additional file 1: Table S7)
[23]. Therefore, while we were unable to calculate confi-
dence intervals on our estimates we have tried to be
conservative with our assumptions.
The best data available to us on the RR of cancer at-
tributable to moderate levels of alcohol (ten units per
week) were for consumption of less than 19 g per day,
an average of 8.8 units per week if normally distributed.
Similarly, our estimate of 30 units per week was derived
from individuals drinking 20-39 g per day, i.e. 25.9 units
per week (Additional file 1: Table S1) [28]. These data
would slightly underestimate our calculation of the abso-
lute increase in cancer risk associated with drinking ten
and 30 units per week. In terms of tobacco, there is a
lack of published data on RRs of cancer attributable to
very low levels of smoking, with the lowest level of ex-
posure generally reported as one to ten (approximately
five) cigarettes per day. While recent studies have looked
at lower levels of smoking their end point is mortality,
not cancer incidence [46, 47]. While we were therefore
required to estimate the risks of developing cancer at
lower levels of consumption (just ten cigarettes per
week) using logarithmic transformation, we believe this
is justified as exposure to any level of carcinogens within
cigarette smoke is likely to cause harm, and there is no
reason to suppose there is a threshold at which this risk
would begin [48]. As a result of these uncertainties we
performed a sensitivity analysis reducing FAA, FTA and
RRs for consuming ten units alcohol per week or ten
cigarettes per week by 50%. This reduced the ‘cigarette
equivalent’ of one bottle of wine to four for men but
remained ten for women.
This study does not account for the duration an indi-
vidual is exposed to a cancer-related risk factor. Cumula-
tive exposure is directly related to the incidence of
certain cancers, particularly tobacco smoking and lung
cancer [49]. Furthermore this study only takes into
account cancer incidence and not the age at which a
cancer develops and its prognosis. However while the
majority of alcohol-related cancers, including breast can-
cer may have a better ten year survival than lung cancer
(78% vs 5%, Additional file 1: Table S7), the years of life
lost from cancer are comparable. Lung cancer is the
leading cause of years of life lost from cancer (2,365,000
years of life lost), but colorectal cancer is the second
(804,000 years of life lost), and female breast cancer the
third (778,000 years of life lost) [50]. In addition breast
cancer affects women at a relatively younger age com-
pared to lung cancer [51], resulting in a significant bur-
den
for
them
and
their
families,
including
young
children.
It is noteworthy that the attributable fractions and the
absolute risk scores calculated here are dependent on both
the prevalence of exposure to a risk factor within a popu-
lation and the relative risk of that behaviour resulting in
cancer. For smoking the prevalence is low (approximately
20% of individuals in the UK are daily smokers for ex-
ample [52]), with a high relative risk of cancer for current
smokers; whereas alcohol consumption is more common
(72% of women and 83% of men consume some alcohol in
countries with a high socio-demographic index [10]), but
is associated with a lower relative risk of cancers overall;
even for high levels of consumption [53]. Critically, our
findings are not meant to detract from the substantive
cancer risks associated with smoking which remains the
single largest preventable cause of cancer worldwide [54],
and for which even very low levels of exposure are associ-
ated with an increased risk of cancer [46].
Critically our use of absolute ‘lifetime risk’ describes
the average of the number of cancers experienced by a
population, i.e. individuals with and without cancer, and
is not an exact measure of an individual’s probability of
getting cancer. In other words while this study estimates
that drinking ten units of alcohol per week may cause a
similar number of cancers in the population as smoking
five to ten cigarettes per week, these two exposures may
not carry the same cancer risk for any given individual.
We have attempted to minimise this effect by using life-
time cancer risks from CRUK which have been calcu-
lated using the Sasieni method. This corrects incidence
rates for the inclusion of more than one primary cancer
occurring within the same individual, lowering the life-
time cancer risk [24].
Furthermore this study does not take into account
other smoking or alcohol-related outcomes such as re-
spiratory, cardiovascular or liver disease in which case
Hydes et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:316 
Page 6 of 8
 the conclusions would likely be quite different. Cancer
deaths are a fraction of the total number of deaths asso-
ciated with smoking and alcohol and this study is not a
comparison of the overall mortality of smoking versus
alcohol.
Despite
the
caveats,
our
estimation
of
a
‘cigarette equivalent’ for alcohol provides a useful meas-
ure for communicating cancer risks that exploits suc-
cessful historical messaging on smoking, reflects current
epidemiological knowledge and includes an important
aspect of gender differential.
Conclusions
We have shown moderate levels of drinking (one bottle
of wine per week) is associated with a significant
increased
absolute
lifetime
risk
of
alcohol-related
cancers in women, driven largely by breast cancer.
Drinking one bottle of wine per week is associated with
an increase in absolute lifetime risk of cancer equivalent
to smoking ten cigarettes a week for women, and five for
men. These findings highlight moderate levels of drink-
ing as an important public health issue for women and
identify
a
need
to
promote
national
awareness,
supported by the recent change in national drinking
guidelines. This study offers the first attempt to use well
established and well communicated links between cancer
and tobacco as a mechanism to explain similar links be-
tween alcohol and cancer which have to date failed to
reach most of the public.
