BACKGROUND
Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency is characterized by recurrent, unpre-
dictable swelling episodes caused by uncontrolled plasma kallikrein generation and exces-
sive bradykinin release resulting from cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen. Lan-
adelumab (DX-2930) is a new kallikrein inhibitor with the potential for prophylactic 
treatment of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency.
METHODS
We conducted a phase 1b, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascend-
ing-dose trial. Patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency were ran-
domly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either lanadelumab (24 patients) or placebo (13 pa-
tients), in two administrations 14 days apart. Patients assigned to lanadelumab were enrolled 
in sequential dose groups: total dose of 30 mg (4 patients), 100 mg (4 patients), 300 mg 
(5 patients), or 400 mg (11 patients). The pharmacodynamic profile of lanadelumab was 
assessed by measurement of plasma levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen, and 
efficacy was assessed by the rate of attacks of angioedema during a prespecified period (day 
8 to day 50) in the 300-mg and 400-mg groups as compared with the placebo group.
RESULTS
No discontinuations occurred because of adverse events, serious adverse events, or deaths 
in patients who received lanadelumab. The most common adverse events that emerged dur-
ing treatment were attacks of angioedema, injection-site pain, and headache. Dose-propor-
tional increases in serum concentrations of lanadelumab were observed; the mean elimina-
tion half-life was approximately 2 weeks. Lanadelumab at a dose of 300 mg or 400 mg 
reduced cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen in plasma from patients with heredi-
tary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency to levels approaching that from patients 
without the disorder. From day 8 to day 50, the 300-mg and 400-mg groups had 100% and 
88% fewer attacks, respectively, than the placebo group. All patients in the 300-mg group 
and 82% (9 of 11) in the 400-mg group were attack-free, as compared with 27% (3 of 11) 
in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS
In this small trial, administration of lanadelumab to patients with hereditary angioedema 
with C1 inhibitor deficiency reduced cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen and 
attacks of angioedema. (Funded by Dyax; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02093923.)

H
ereditary angioedema with C1 in-
hibitor deficiency is a rare genetic dis-
ease that is characterized by recurrent 
swelling episodes, typically affecting the subcu-
taneous or submucosal tissues of the hands and 
feet, abdomen, face, larynx, or genitourinary 
tract.1 Swelling of the larynx can be life-threat-
ening because of the risk of asphyxiation.2 The 
disease is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction 
of C1 inhibitor, a key regulator of the comple-
ment, coagulation, and kallikrein–kinin cascades. 
In hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor de-
ficiency, activation of the kallikrein–kinin cas-
cade leads to uncontrolled generation of plasma 
kallikrein and consequent proteolysis of high-
molecular-weight kininogen. This results in ex-
cessive bradykinin production, which causes va-
sodilatation, vascular leakage, and subsequent 
angioedema and pain.3
All patients with hereditary angioedema with 
C1 inhibitor deficiency must have ready access to 
an on-demand medication for treatment of acute 
attacks.4-6 In addition, some patients benefit from 
prophylactic treatment, on the basis of a variety 
of criteria, including the frequency and severity 
of attacks, a history of airway swelling, and pa-
tient preference.4-6 Currently approved prophy-
lactic therapies include attenuated androgens 
(e.g., danazol) and a plasma-derived C1 inhibitor 
(Cinryze, Shire). Although both treatments sig-
nificantly reduce the frequency and severity of 
attacks,7,8 they have potential shortcomings. An-
drogens are daily medications and may have side 
effects; studies indicate that approximately 25% 
of patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 
inhibitor deficiency who receive androgens dis-
continue them owing to unacceptable side ef-
fects.9-12 The C1 inhibitor is administered intra-
venously every 3 to 4 days, which is difficult for 
some patients, and carries a theoretical risk of 
infection and loss of venous access owing to 
repetitive administration. Neither attenuated an-
drogens nor the C1 inhibitor prevents all attacks 
of angioedema. Although on-demand treatments, 
if administered at the beginning of an attack, 
usually halt the attack and shorten the time to 
symptom resolution, patients may still have dis-
ruptions to their daily activities and anxiety as-
sociated with the unpredictable and life-threat-
ening nature of the attacks. Thus, despite 
several new therapies, the burden of disease in 
hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor defi-
ciency remains high, with a substantial negative 
effect on quality of life.13-15
Lanadelumab (DX-2930) is a recombinant, fully 
human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody 
inhibitor of kallikrein that has potential for 
prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema 
with C1 inhibitor deficiency.16,17 We report find-
ings from a phase 1b trial evaluating this new 
drug for the long-term prevention of attacks of 
angioedema.
Methods
Trial Design
This was a phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascend-
ing-dose trial of subcutaneous administrations 
of lanadelumab in patients with hereditary angio-
edema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. The objec-
tives were to assess safety and side-effect profile, 
characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic characteristics, and evaluate the im-
munogenicity of multiple subcutaneous lanadelu-
mab administrations. In addition, the frequency of 
attacks of angioedema and the use of on-demand 
therapy were determined in higher-dose groups.
There were four dose groups (30 mg, 100 mg, 
300 mg, and 400 mg), with lanadelumab admin-
istered in a staggered, dose-escalating fashion. 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 
ratio to receive either the active drug or placebo 
within a group. (Additional details on the trial 
agents are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.) If patients had attacks of angio-
edema, they followed standard-of-care on-demand 
treatment as prescribed by their physician.
The sponsor (Dyax) designed the trial with 
input from all the authors. The protocol (avail-
able at NEJM.org) was approved by the institu-
tional review board or ethics committee at each 
participating institution. All the patients pro-
vided written informed consent before enroll-
ment. Data were gathered by trial investigators 
and staff in collaboration with the sponsor. The 
first and subsequent drafts of the manuscript 
were written by the first two authors. All the 
authors reviewed and edited the manuscript and 
made the decision to submit it for publication.

tion of the manuscript was provided by a profes-
sional medical writer at Dyax and by Excel Scien-
tific Solutions. All the authors contributed to 
data interpretation and had access to the full 
data (nondisclosure agreements were in place). 
The authors vouch for the integrity and com-
pleteness of the data and all analyses and for 
adherence of the trial to the protocol. Statistical 
analyses were performed by ICON.
Patient Recruitment
Patients were at least 18 years of age and had a 
documented diagnosis of type I or II hereditary 
angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency, with 
the diagnosis based on their meeting all the fol-
lowing criteria: a clinical history consistent with 
hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor defi-
ciency, a C1 inhibitor antigen or functional level 
less than 40% of the normal level (patients with 
a C1 inhibitor antigen or functional level 40 to 
50% of the normal level could be enrolled if they 
also had a C4 level below the normal range and a 
family history consistent with type I or II heredi-
tary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency), 
and an age at reported onset of first angioedema 
symptoms of 30 years or younger or a family 
history consistent with type I or II hereditary 
angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. Patients 
must have had two or more attacks of angio-
edema per year, with at least one attack in the 
previous 6 months. Patients were excluded if 
they had received long-term prophylactic medi-
cations for hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibi-
tor deficiency in the previous 90 days, used a C1 
inhibitor within 7 days before trial enrollment, 
had participated in another investigational study 
in the previous 90 days, or had exposure within 
the previous 5 years to a monoclonal antibody or 
recombinant protein bearing an Fc domain.
Blood Sampling and Pharmacokinetic  
and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Blood was obtained from patients with heredi-
tary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency 
and from healthy controls to assess the C4 level, 
C1 inhibitor antigen and functional level, and 
level of antidrug antibody and for pharmacoki-
netic and pharmacodynamic analyses. Samples 
were obtained before administration of each dose 
of lanadelumab or placebo (days 1 and 15) and 
on days 2, 4, 8, 16, 18, 22, 29, 36, 50, 64, 92, and 
120 in all four dose groups. (Details are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Efficacy
Prespecified efficacy analyses were performed 
on data from patients in the higher-dose lanadel-
umab groups (300 mg or 400 mg) or in the 
placebo group who had had two or more attacks 
of angioedema during the 3 months before en-
rollment. Thus, the analyses included patients 
who had a reasonable probability of having one 
or more attacks during the 6-week interval from 
day 8 to day 50 (primary efficacy analysis popu-
lation). The primary efficacy end point was the 
number of attacks of angioedema per week from 
day 8 to day 50. A post hoc modified intention-
to-treat efficacy analysis was performed that 
excluded two patients. One patient prematurely 
discontinued the trial after one dose, and the 
other patient was found after trial enrollment 
not to have met the criteria for hereditary angio-
edema with C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1 inhibitor 
testing was not consistent with type I or II heredi-
tary angioedema despite historical laboratory 
tests indicating otherwise). (For a discussion of 
the patients’ removal, see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
Safety
Safety variables were adverse events, including 
serious adverse events; vital signs (blood pres-
sure while the patient was sitting or in the su-
pine position, heart rate, oral body temperature, 
and respiratory rate); physical examination; clin-
ical laboratory testing (hematologic measure-
ments, clinical chemical analyses, coagulation 
tests, and urinalysis); 12-lead electrocardiogra-
phy; and plasma levels of antidrug antibodies 
(details of safety variables are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis and programming of tables 
were performed with the use of SAS software 
(SAS Institute). We analyzed rates of attacks of 
angioedema using a mixed model of repeated 
measurements with the assumption of a Poisson 
distribution and using the baseline attack rate as 
a covariate. Missing data were not imputed. For 
additional details on the statistical analyses, see 
the Supplementary Appendix.

Results
Baseline Characteristics of the Patients
A total of 37 patients with hereditary angioedema 
with C1 inhibitor deficiency were randomly as-
signed to one of five groups (four lanadelumab 
dose groups and a placebo group). The majority 
of the patients were women (62%), although the 
300-mg group had a higher percentage of men 
than women (80% vs. 20%). The mean age was 
39.9 years (range, 18 to 71). All the patients were 
white, and 1 identified as Hispanic or Latino. 
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The 
mean number of attacks of angioedema in the 
previous 3 months was similar in patients who 
received lanadelumab and those who received 
placebo, as was the number of attacks in the 
previous 12 months. A total of 84% of the pa-
tients had a diagnosis of type I hereditary angio-
edema, 11% had a diagnosis of type II, and 5% 
had an unspecified type (either type I or type II). 
Among the 29 patients who had received on-
demand treatment for attacks of angioedema 
during the previous 3 months, icatibant (17 pa-
tients) was the most common therapy.
Safety
The safety population included all randomly as-
signed patients who received at least one dose of 
lanadelumab or placebo (24 patients received 
lanadelumab, and 13 received placebo); this 
population was evaluated for safety in all four 
dose groups (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). No notable differences in adverse events 
were apparent across dose groups. A total of 
58% of the patients who received lanadelumab 
and 77% of those who received placebo had at 
least one adverse event that emerged during treat-
ment (Table 2). Adverse events that occurred in 
at least 5 patients overall were attacks of angio-
edema, injection-site pain, and headache. Rates 
of these adverse events were not appreciably 
higher among patients who received lanadelu-
mab than among those who received placebo.

Hereditary Angioedema Prophylaxis
A total of 25% of the patients who received lan-
adelumab and 38% of those who received pla-
cebo had a severe adverse event that emerged 
during treatment.
A total of 29% of the patients who received 
lanadelumab and 38% of those who received 
placebo had an adverse event that was consid-
ered by trial investigators, who were unaware of 
the trial-group assignments, to be treatment-
related (Table 2). The most common treatment-
related adverse events were injection-site pain 
(occurring in 25% of the patients who received 
lanadelumab and in 23% of those who received 
placebo) and headache (occurring in 8% of the 
patients who received lanadelumab and in 15% 
of those who received placebo). Two patients 
who received lanadelumab had severe adverse 
events that were considered to be treatment-
related: one patient (in the 30-mg group) had 
injection-site pain that lasted for 1 minute, and 
another (in the 400-mg group) had worsening 
headache and ongoing night sweats. There were 
no deaths or discontinuations due to an adverse 
event that emerged during treatment and no im-
portant safety signals in patients who received 
lanadelumab or placebo. There were no serious 
adverse events in patients who received lanadel-
umab. One serious adverse event, pneumonia, 
occurred on day 87 in one patient who received 
placebo.
Antidrug Antibodies
Two of the patients included in the safety analy-
sis were confirmed to be positive for antidrug 
antibodies. One patient (30-mg dose group) 
tested positive at day 120, and the other patient 
(400-mg dose group) tested positive at day 92. 
All antidrug antibodies were nonneutralizing. 
There was no evidence of loss of pharmacoki-
netic or pharmacodynamic effect of lanadelumab 
in either patient who was positive for antidrug 
antibodies.
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic 
Characteristics
The pharmacokinetic analysis population includ-
ed all randomly assigned patients with heredi-
tary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency 
who received at least one dose of lanadelumab 
and had sufficient blood samples (22 patients); 
the pharmacodynamic analysis population in-
cluded these patients plus the 13 patients who 
received at least one dose of placebo (total, 35 pa-
tients) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

An adverse event was considered to have emerged during treatment if the time of onset was after administration of a trial agent through the 
day 120 postdose final follow‑up visit or, in the event that the time of onset preceded administration of the trial agent, the adverse event in‑
creased in severity during the 120‑day postdose follow‑up period. Shown are events that occurred in at least five patients during the trial. A 
total of 25% of the patients who received lanadelumab and 38% of those who received placebo had a severe adverse event that emerged

Drug levels of lanadelumab were dose-dependent 
and had a prolonged half-life, typical of a human 
monoclonal antibody. The maximum plasma 
concentration of lanadelumab increased with 
increasing dose, and the half-life ranged from 
13.8 to 15.0 days (Fig. 1A). In addition, sustained 
quantifiable drug concentrations were observed 
through day 120 in all lanadelumab dose groups. 
These characteristics were consistent with values 
obtained in a phase 1a study involving healthy 
volunteers.16
Two different methods were used to deter-
mine kallikrein activity. A Western blot assay 
measured cleaved high-molecular-weight kinino-
gen, the endogenous substrate of kallikrein, as a 
biomarker of its activity. Predose plasma across 
all patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 
inhibitor deficiency when they were asymptom-
atic (Fig. 1B) contained a mean (±SE) level 
of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen of 
51.0±4.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.6 to 
59.9). In contrast, predose samples obtained 
from healthy controls without hereditary angio-
edema with C1 inhibitor deficiency contained a 
mean level of cleaved high-molecular-weight 
kininogen of 8.3±0.5% (95% CI, 7.2 to 9.4). 
Therefore, plasma from patients with hereditary 
angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency had 
higher levels of circulating cleaved high-molecu-
lar-weight kininogen than plasma from healthy 
controls. No significant differences in mean 
levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen 
were observed between the 30-mg dose group or 
the 100-mg dose group and the placebo group.
An evaluation of mean plasma levels of 
cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen showed 
significant reductions (P<0.05) from predose 
levels in the 300-mg and 400-mg dose groups in 
samples obtained on day 8 and on day 22. 
Maximum reductions in levels of cleaved high-
molecular-weight kininogen in the 300-mg and 
400-mg dose groups occurred on day 22, which 
approximates the time to maximum plasma 
concentration of the drug after the second lan-
adelumab administration. Furthermore, in these 
dose groups, the level of cleaved high-molecular-
weight kininogen approached that observed in 
healthy volunteers (8.3±0.5%), which shows the 
pharmacodynamic activity of lanadelumab and 
suggests its potential to normalize the instabil-
ity of plasma with respect to excess contact-sys-
tem activation in patients with hereditary angio-
edema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. In addition, 
lanadelumab suppressed activated factor XII–
mediated increases in the percent of cleaved 
high-molecular-weight kininogen in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 1C and 1D).
The pharmacodynamic activity of lanadelu-
mab was also evaluated with the use of a fluoro-
genic assay, which showed dose-dependent 
kallikrein inhibition in samples obtained from 
patients in the 100-mg, 300-mg, and 400-mg 
dose groups (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Minimal levels of inhibition were ob-
served in the 30-mg dose group and in the pla-
cebo group. After the second administration of 
lanadelumab in the 100-mg, 300-mg, and 400-mg 
dose groups, peak inhibition values of approxi-
mately 30%, 60%, and 70%, respectively, were 
observed. The inhibition was time-dependent 
and aligned closely with the plasma concentra-
tions of lanadelumab, findings that suggest that 
the effect of lanadelumab treatment correlates 
with its biologic activity.
Efficacy
We evaluated the efficacy of lanadelumab by as-
sessing the incidence of attacks of angioedema 
among patients with hereditary angioedema with 
C1 inhibitor deficiency who were assigned to the 
300-mg, 400-mg, and placebo groups and who 
received two doses of the trial agent (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). All the patients 
(receiving lanadelumab or placebo) included in 
this analysis had a historical baseline attack rate 
of 2 or more attacks in the 3 months before 
enrollment. The baseline rate of attacks of an-
gioedema per week was 0.33 in the 300-mg 
group, 0.55 in the 400-mg group, and 0.39 in the 
placebo group (Table 3). With the removal of the 
2 patients in the 400-mg group for the modified

not change significantly (0.52 attacks per week).
Between day 8 and day 50, all the patients in 
the 300-mg group were attack-free, as compared 
with 3 of 11 patients (27%) in the placebo group, 
representing a rate of attacks per week of 0 ver-

the 400-mg group were attack-free, representing 
a rate of attacks per week (0.05) that was signifi-
cantly lower than the rate with placebo (P 
= 
0.005). 
Patients in the 300-mg group, 400-mg group, 
and combined 300-mg and 400-mg groups had

Hereditary Angioedema Prophylaxis
shows the characteristics of attacks of angio-
edema (location, severity, and on-demand treat-
ment) that occurred during the period from day 
8 to day 50 in patients with hereditary angio-
edema with C1 inhibitor deficiency who were 
included in the prespecified primary efficacy 
analysis. These data suggest a consistent response 
to treatment, regardless of baseline severity. The 
moderate and severe attacks that occurred in 
the patient who received only one dose of lan-
adelumab (and was therefore not included in the 
modified intention-to-treat efficacy analysis) are 
included in that table.
Figure 2A shows the incidence of attacks of 
angioedema during the trial period among pa-
tients who received placebo. We next examined 
the relationship between lanadelumab drug ex-
posure and the incidence of attacks. In order to 
correlate drug exposure and the incidence of 
attacks, the mean plasma concentrations of lan-
adelumab were plotted against the days when at-
tacks occurred in the 300-mg and 400-mg groups 
(Fig. 2B and 2C). During the primary efficacy 
window (day 8 to day 50), the incidence of at-
tacks decreased among patients who received 
lanadelumab at a dose of 300 mg or 400 mg, 
with attacks reemerging when the drug concen-
tration decreased. The one attack that occurred 
during the efficacy period was a mild peripheral 
attack that resolved within 8 hours without treat-
ment. Although the 30-mg and 100-mg groups 
were not included in the primary analysis popu-
lation, the incidence of attacks also decreased in 
these groups (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Discussion
This 6-week phase 1b trial involving patients 
with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor 
deficiency suggests that two administrations of 
lanadelumab 14 days apart are safe at a total 
dose of up to 400 mg. In the primary efficacy 
and modified intention-to-treat analyses, two 
administrations of lanadelumab at a total dose 
of 300 mg or 400 mg appeared to be effective in 
preventing attacks of angioedema, resulting in 
100% and 88% fewer attacks, respectively, than 
the number of attacks with placebo. The pharma-
cokinetic profile of lanadelumab was linear and 
dose-dependent and had a prolonged half-life of 
approximately 14 days, typical of a human mono-
clonal antibody. The decrease in attacks of angio-
edema strongly correlated with drug exposure, 
which corroborated the results of the efficacy 
analysis. In addition, pharmacodynamic results 
confirmed kallikrein inhibition in a dose-depen-
dent and time-dependent manner. Results from 
the Western blot assay suggested the potential to 
normalize levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight 
kininogen to those of healthy controls after 
doses of 300 mg or greater. We believe that the 
observed effects of lanadelumab, both the phar-
macodynamic characteristics and the decrease 
in the rate of attacks, provide proof of concept 
that lanadelumab has the potential to correct 
the pathophysiological abnormality underlying 
attacks of angioedema and may be a new thera-
peutic option for hereditary angioedema with C1 
inhibitor deficiency.

§  
The result is based on general estimating equation (GEE) analysis of repeated counts per week during the observation 
period (days 8 to 50). The baseline rate of attacks of angioedema per week is a covariate, trial group is a fixed effect, and 
trial participant is a random effect in the GEE model with an independent working correlation structure. The observed 
rate of attacks per week was 0% in the 300‑mg group, and thus an arbitrarily small value (0.000001) was imputed for 
the variable of the rate of attacks for a random patient in the 300‑mg group at week 2 to enable the GEE analysis to 
converge.
¶  
Two patients in the 400‑mg group were excluded from the modified efficacy analysis: one patient who received only one 
dose of lanadelumab and was subsequently lost to follow‑up and one patient who did not have type I or II hereditary 
angioedema.

logical defect that is responsible for the develop-
ment of attacks of angioedema, and the impor-
tance of kallikrein as a drug target has been 
validated through the effectiveness of ecallan-
tide (Kalbitor, Dyax), which specifically targets 
kallikrein.18 The Western blot biomarker assay 
measuring cleaved high-molecular-weight kinin-
ogen provides evidence that lanadelumab causes 
a dose-dependent decrease of kallikrein activity 
in patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 
inhibitor deficiency. At baseline, patients with 
hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor defi-
ciency had elevated plasma levels of cleaved high-
molecular-weight kininogen; this finding is simi-
lar to those of previous reports.19 To minimize 
intersite variability, all sites obtained and pro-
cessed plasma in a standardized fashion and 
added protease inhibitors to minimize cleavage 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).19,20
The 300-mg and 400-mg doses reduced cleaved 
high-molecular-weight kininogen in both unac-
tivated and activated factor XII samples to levels 
approaching those observed in healthy controls. 
In addition, the activity of lanadelumab, evalu-
ated with the use of the fluorogenic assay, 
showed dose-dependent kallikrein inhibition in 
samples collected from the 100-mg, 300-mg, 
and 400-mg dose groups (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Collectively, these results 
show the activity of lanadelumab and suggest its 
ability to potentially normalize the instability of 
plasma with respect to excess contact-system 
activation in patients with hereditary angioedema 
with C1 inhibitor deficiency. Furthermore, the 
reduction in attacks of angioedema observed 
during periods of high drug exposure suggests 
that prolonged inhibition of kallikrein is an effec-
tive prophylactic approach to hereditary angio-
edema with C1 inhibitor deficiency.
This phase Ib trial supports the continued 
investigation of lanadelumab. No patients dis-
continued the trial because of adverse events, 
and the low incidence and severity of adverse 
events and the type of events did not indicate a 
safety signal. Fletcher factor deficiency, a condi-
tion characterized by a severe congenital defi-
ciency of prekallikrein, suggests limited risk 
from long-term kallikrein inhibition, since there 
are no obvious clinical complications directly 
attributable to the defect.21-24 Although the effi-
cacy results of this trial are encouraging, the 
duration of the trial was relatively short. A phase 3 
trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 6 months 
of lanadelumab treatment is under way (Clinical-
Trials.gov number, NCT02586805).

tient who received only one dose of lanadelumab and was subsequently lost to 
follow‑up and one patient who did not have type I or II hereditary angioedema.
