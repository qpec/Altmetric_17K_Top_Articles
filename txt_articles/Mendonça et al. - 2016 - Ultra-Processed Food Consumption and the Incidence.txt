Hypertension accounts for approximately 10.4 million 
deaths, 208.1 million disability-adjusted life-years, and 7% of 
the disease burden worldwide.1,2 Moreover, hypertension is 
a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and responsible for at 
least 45% and 51% of deaths due to heart disease and stroke, 
respectively.3 The prevalence of hypertension was approxi-
mately 22% worldwide in 2014 and 25% in the European 
region.1
Modifiable risk factors for hypertension include an 
unhealthy diet (consumption of foods containing excess salt 
and saturated fat and insufficient fruit and vegetables intake), 
harmful alcohol use, lack of physical activity, and excess 
weight.4 In several countries, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) 
are common sources of salt. According to Monteiro et al. 
UPFs are defined as drink and food products which, beyond 
substances of common culinary use such as salt, sugar, oils, 
and fats, include substances also derived from foods but not 
used in culinary preparation and are ready to eat, drink, or 
heat.5–7 They have high amounts of salt, total fat, saturated 
fat, and trans fat, free sugar, and high energy density, and low 
fiber and micronutrients content.8–11
Consumption of UPFs has been associated with higher 
risks of overweight/obesity,12 metabolic syndrome in ado-
lescents,13 and increased total cholesterol and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels in children.14 Collectively,

BACKGROUND
Some available evidence suggests that high consumption of 
ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is associated with a higher risk of 
obesity. Collectively, this association and the nutritional charac-
teristics of UPFs suggest that UPFs might also be associated with 
hypertension.
METHODS
We prospectively evaluated the relationship between UPF consump-
tion and the risk of hypertension in a prospective Spanish cohort, the 
Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra project. We included 14,790 Spanish 
adult university graduates who were initially free of hypertension at base-
line who were followed for a mean of 9.1 years (SD, 3.9 years; total person-
years: 134,784). UPF (industrial formulations of chemical compounds 
which, beyond substances of common culinary use such as salt, sugar, 
oils, and fats, include substances also derived from foods but not used in 
culinary preparations) consumption was assessed using a validated semi-
quantitative 136-item food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hypertension incidence.
RESULTS
During follow-up, 1,702 incident cases of hypertension were identified. 
Participants in the highest tertile of UPF consumption had a higher risk of devel-
oping hypertension (adjusted HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06, 1.37; P for trend = 0.004) 
than those in the lowest tertile after adjusting for potential confounders.
CONCLUSIONS
In this large prospective cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult univer-
sity graduates, a positive association between UPF consumption and 
hypertension risk was observed. Additional longitudinal studies are 
needed to confirm our results.

Ultra-Processed Foods and Hypertension Risk
between UPF and overweight/obesity likely support an 
association between UPF consumption and hypertension. 
Large prospective studies involving an assessment of UPF 
consumption in the development of hypertension are lack-
ing; however, foods that can be classified as UPFs have been 
assessed in previous studies.15–18 For example, sugar-sweet-
ened beverage consumption increases the risk of hyper-
tension according to meta-analyses of prospective cohort 
studies.15,16 Furthermore, processed red meat consumption 
was associated with hypertension in a prospective cohort 
study in French women17 and in the Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.18
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the poten-
tial association between UPF consumption and hyperten-
sion risk in a Spanish cohort during a long follow-up period.
METHODS
Study population
The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) project 
is a dynamic and multipurpose prospective cohort study that 
has been conducted in Spain among university graduates 
since December 1999 to assess the associations between diet 
and the occurrence of several diseases and chronic conditions, 
including hypertension. The recruitment of participants is 
permanently open, and participants are followed-up bien-
nially using questionnaires distributed by post or electronic 
mail. Details of the design, recruitment strategy, and methods 
of the SUN project have been published elsewhere.19,20
As of March 2013, the dataset of the SUN project included 
21,678 participants who had answered the baseline question-
naire. In the present study, we excluded participants with 
prevalent hypertension (self-reported medical diagnosis 
of hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, or self-
reported systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or dias-
tolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg)21 at baseline (n = 2,378), 
who reported total energy intake values outside of predefined 
limits (low: <3,347 kJ/d or <800 kcal/d in men and <2,092 
kJ/d or <500 kcal/d in women; high: >16,736 kJ/d or >4,000 
kcal/d in men and >14,644 kJ/d or >3,500 kcal/d in women; 
n = 1,826),22 who reported a previously diagnosed chronic 
disease at baseline (diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease; 
n = 1,310), or who were lost to follow-up (n = 1,374); 90.7% 
of the participants were retained in the study. Finally, 14,790 
participants were included in the final analyses (Figure 1).
Ethics
This study was conducted according to the Declaration 
of Helsinki guidelines, and all procedures involving human 
subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of the University of Navarra. Voluntary completion of the 
baseline self-administrated questionnaire was considered to 
imply informed consent.
Ascertainment of hypertension
In both the baseline and follow-up questionnaires, par-
ticipants were asked whether they had received a medical 
diagnosis of hypertension. Additionally, the baseline ques-
tionnaire inquired about the most recent systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressures. The follow-up questionnaire also 
requested the date of hypertension diagnosis.
A participant was considered to have hypertension at 
baseline if he/she reported a medical diagnosis of hyperten-
sion, was taking an antihypertensive medication, or reported 
systolic and/or diastolic blood pressures ≥140 mm Hg and/or 
≥90 mm Hg, respectively.23 New cases of hypertension were 
defined as individuals reporting a physician-based diagnosis 
of hypertension in the follow-up questionnaire who did not 
have hypertension at baseline.
Adequate validation of the self-reported hypertension 
diagnosis was observed in a specific study within a sub-
sample of the cohort.24 Hypertension was confirmed using 
conventional measurements of blood pressure for 82.3% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 72.8–92.8) of participants. 
Furthermore, we validated each component of metabolic 
syndrome (including high blood pressure) and found ade-
quate intraclass correlation coefficients for high systolic 
(0.47 [95% CI, 0.36–0.57]) and diastolic (0.46 [95% CI, 0.34–
0.56]) blood pressures using direct assessments.25
Exposure assessment: UPF consumption
Dietary intake was assessed at baseline using a self-
administered 136-item semi-quantitative food-frequency 
questionnaire (FFQ) for the previous year, which was pre-
viously validated in Spain and recently reevaluated.26,27 The 
FFQ included a typical Spanish portion size for each item, 
and consumption frequencies were categorized using 9 cate-
gories (ranging from never/almost never to >6 servings/
day). Daily food consumption was estimated by multiply-
ing the portion size by the consumption frequency for each 
food item.
The UPFs were defined according to the NOVA classifi-
cation,5–7 which classifies foods into 4 groups based on the 
extent and purpose of industrial processing: (i) unprocessed 
or minimally processed foods (fruits and vegetables, grains 
[cereals] in general, nuts and seeds, fresh and pasteurized 
milk, and natural yogurt with no added sugar or artificial 
sweeteners); (ii) processed culinary ingredients (salt, sugar,

honey, vegetable oils, butter, lard, and vinegar); (iii) processed 
foods (canned or bottled vegetables and legumes, fruits in 
syrup, canned fish, unpackaged cheeses, freshly made bread, 
and salted or sugared nuts and seeds); and (iv) UPF and 
drink products (carbonated drinks, processed meat, biscuits 
[cookies], candy [confectionery], ‘instant’ packaged soups 
and noodles, sweet or savory packaged snacks, and sugared 
milk and fruit drinks).
The frequency of UPF consumption per person was esti-
mated using the sum of the UPF items in the FFQ (total of 33 
items). Total UPF consumption was adjusted for total energy 
intake using the residual method.22 The sample was divided 
into tertiles according to total consumption (servings/d).
Assessment of covariates
At baseline, participants completed a questionnaire about 
a wide array of characteristics, including sociodemographic 
information (sex and age), medical history and medication 
use, anthropometric measurements (weight and height), life-
style (smoking status, physical activity during leisure time, 
hours of television watched per day, and hours of sleeping 
and siesta per day), and consumption of a special diet (veg-
etarian diet, hypocaloric diet, diet to control lactose intoler-
ance, and diet to prevent food allergy).
Self-reports of weight and height were validated in a spe-
cific study within a subsample.28 Body mass index was cal-
culated as the self-reported weight (kg) divided by height 
squared (m2). Physical activity was evaluated using a vali-
dated 17-item questionnaire.29
Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was eval-
uated using a well-known score.30 Intakes of total energy, 
macronutrients, sodium, potassium, caffeine, fiber, and alco-
hol were calculated as the frequency multiplied by the nutri-
ent composition of specified portion sizes using the FFQ. 
The nutrient databank was updated by a trained team of 
dieticians using the food composition tables for Spain. The 
consumption of dairy, fruits, vegetables, fast foods (sausage, 
hamburgers, and pizza), fried foods, processed meat (sau-
sages, hamburgers, and ham), meat, and sugar-sweetened-
beverages was also assessed using the FFQ.26,27
Statistical analyses
Differences in the baseline characteristics of participants 
according to the UPF consumption tertiles were evaluated 
using chi-square tests for trends (categorical variables) or 
linear regression models (continuous variables). The base-
line characteristics were expressed as percentages for cat-
egorical variables and mean (SD) for continuous variables.
The follow-up time was defined as the interval between 
the date of recruitment and death date when the last follow-
up questionnaire was returned or the date of hypertension 
diagnosis (for incident cases) whichever came first.
We used Cox regression models with age as the under-
lying time variable. Multivariable Cox regression models 
were fitted to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for 
hypertension risk during the follow-up for UPF consump-
tion tertiles. We used the lowest tertile as the reference cat-
egory. Tests of linear trends were performed by determining 
the median UPF consumption for each category, which 
was considered a continuous variable in the respective Cox 
regression model.
The Cox regression models were adjusted for several 
potential confounders defined a priori. As recommended to 
perform multivariate analyses, we identified potential con-
founders based on a previous causal knowledge of the exist-
ing literature, in spite of recurring to statistical criteria.31,32 
We stratified all models by year of entry into the cohort. 
The models were without any adjustment (crude), adjusted 
for age and sex (model 1), additionally adjusted for physi-
cal activity, hours of television watching, baseline body mass 
index, smoking status, use of analgesics, following a special 
diet at baseline, family history of hypertension, hypercho-
lesterolemia, and alcohol consumption (model 2), and addi-
tionally adjusted for total energy intake, olive oil intake, and 
fruit and vegetable consumption (model 3).
We evaluated the interaction between UPF consumption 
tertiles and the most relevant variables (sex, age, and body 
mass index) using a likelihood ratio test (2 degrees of free-
dom) that compared the fully adjusted Cox regression model 
and the same model with interaction product terms.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by rerunning the mul-
tivariable-adjusted Cox regression models with the follow-
ing changes: (i) additional adjustment for weight gain during 
follow-up (at least 2 years before developing hypertension); 
(ii) additional adjustment for energy-adjusted sodium intake; 
(iii) exclusion of participants with energy intake <5th percen-
tile and >95th percentile; (iv) inclusion of participants who 
reported systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic 
blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg at baseline; (v) exclusion of partic-
ipants with early incident hypertension (reported within the 
first 2 years of follow-up); (vi) exclusion of participants with 
>3 kg weight gain in the 5 years before entering the cohort; and 
(vii) exclusion of participants with incident chronic diseases.
All analyses were performed with the statistical software 
package STATA/SE version 12.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, 
TX), and the statistical significance was set at 5% (based on 
2-tailed tests).
RESULTS
During a mean follow-up period of 9.1 years (SD, 3.9 years; 
person-years, 134,784), 1,702 incident cases of hypertension 
were identified. Compared with participants in the lowest 
tertile of UPF consumption at baseline, those in the highest 
UPF consumption tertile were significantly more likely to be 
men, younger, have gained weight in recent years, current 
smokers, watch more television, less physically active, have 
the highest consumption of total fat, saturated fatty acids, 
sodium, caffeine, and alcohol, have the lowest consumption 
of protein, total fiber, potassium, and olive oil, and were less 
likely to have a family history of hypertension and history of 
hypercholesterolemia (Table 1). On average, participants in 
the highest UPF consumption tertile also consumed more 
fast food, processed meats, fried foods, and sugar-sweetened 
beverages. In contrast, they had the lowest intakes of fruits, 
vegetables, and dairy products, were less likely to follow spe-
cial diets, and had the lowest adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet (Table 1).

In multivariable models, participants in the highest UPF 
consumption tertile had a greater risk of developing hyperten-
sion than those in the lowest tertile (multivariable-adjusted HR, 
1.21 [95% CI, 1.06–1.37]). The estimates showed a statistically 
significant linear trend (P = 0.004) after adjusting for potential 
confounders (Table 2). When we excluded total energy intake in 
our model because of the potential existence of an over adjust-
ment the results did not substantially change (adjusted HR ter-
tile 3 vs. tertile 1: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07–1.37; P for trend = 0.003).
No significant interactions between UPF consumption 
and sex (P interaction = 0.65), age (P interaction = 0.32), 
and body mass index (P interaction = 0.59) were observed. 
The results from the sensitivity analyses did not substantially 
change in any of the scenarios (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study, higher baseline consumption of 
UPFs was associated with a higher risk of incident hyper-
tension, even after adjustment for potential confounding 
factors. To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic 
study that has evaluated the association between UPFs, a 
new category of foods based on their degree of processing, 
and the risk of hypertension.
Our results support those of most previous cross-sectional 
prospective studies17,18,33 and meta-analyses.15,16 Consuming 
processed meat was associated with the incidence of elevated 
blood pressure in black and white men and women in the 
CARDIA study.14 Furthermore, sweetened beverage con-
sumption (≥1 serving/d) was directly associated with hyper-
tension in 2 meta-analyses.11,12
We believe that the observed associations between UPF 
consumption and hypertension risk could be explained by a 
higher total intake of salt, saturated fat, and sugar and an inad-
equate intake of fiber and micronutrients.8–11 Participants who 
consumed a greater amount of UPFs in our cohort had higher 
intakes of salt, saturated fatty acids, and sugar-sweetened bev-
erages, lower intakes of fiber, potassium, vegetables, and fruits, 
and a lower adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. A 
meta-analysis of prospective studies and randomized control

Ultra-Processed Foods and Hypertension Risk
trials provided evidence of the relationship between high 
adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and lower 
risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The 
Mediterranean diet is based on consumption of fresh foods 
such as vegetable, fruit, legumes, and olive oil.34,35 Therefore, 
the Mediterranean diet could act as a confounder in the asso-
ciation between UPF consumption and hypertension. When 
we adjusted for Mediterranean diet score instead of adjust-
ing for alcohol, olive oil, fruits, and vegetables the results did 
not substantially change (adjusted HR tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: 
1.22; 95% CI: 1.07–1.38; P for trend = 0.002). According to 
the International Study of Macro-/Micronutrients and Blood 
Pressure (INTERMAP), individuals with a low cardiovascular 
risk had higher intakes of fiber, vitamins and minerals, veg-
etable protein, and nutrient-dense foods (fruits, vegetables, 
grains, fish) and lower intakes of animal protein, sodium, 
saturated fatty acids, and high-calorie foods (processed meats 
and sugar-sweetened beverages).33 Our results are similar.
Excessive dietary sodium intake is associated with an 
increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular-related 
deaths.36,37 Salt, the main source of sodium, is present in 
processed foods and ready-to-eat meals in many countries.4 
Most UPFs have a high sodium content, especially condi-
ments (complete seasonings and sauces), broths, soup pow-
ders, and processed meats.38,39 In a meta-analysis of 34 trials, 
a longer-term reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d resulted in an 
important reduction in blood pressure (systolic blood pres-
sure: −4.18 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.18, −3.18]; diastolic blood 
pressure: −2.06 mm Hg [95% CI, −2.67, −1.45]), and that a 
greater reduction in salt intake provided a greater decrease 
in systolic blood pressure.40
Similar results have been observed for saturated fat intake. 
Reduced saturated fat intake was associated with a reduced 
cardiovascular disease risk in a recent Cochrane review of 15 
randomized controlled trials that used a variety of interven-
tions to reduce saturated fat intake.41 Furthermore, replacing 
saturated fat with unsaturated plant fats reduces the risk of cor-
onary heart disease.42 Another hypothesis to explain the asso-
ciation between UPF and hypertension risk could be weight 
gain related to UPF consumption during follow-up. In a previ-
ous study in the same cohort, a positive association between 
higher UPF consumption and risk of overweight/obesity was 
shown.43 However, we conducted additional analyses adjust-
ing for weight gain during follow-up, which showed a small 
change in the results, suggesting that additional mechanisms 
might explain the relationship between UPF and hypertension.
In contrast, diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associ-
ated with reduced blood pressure, potentially owing to their 
effect on body weight control and fiber, vitamin, and min-
eral intake. In an analysis of 3 cohorts in the United States 
(Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study), long-term fruit consump-
tion was associated with a reduced risk of developing hyper-
tension in adults.44 In this context, a high consumption of 
UPFs could mean that calories from healthy fruits and veg-
etables are replaced by UPF calories, which is also a plausi-
ble explanation of our findings. In the INTERMAP study, an 
inverse association between raw and cooked vegetable con-
sumption and blood pressure, with a stronger association for 
raw vegetables, was found in 4,680 men and women aged 
40–59 years from Japan and the People’s Republic of China, 
United Kingdom, and United States.45
Although we focused on the association between hyper-
tension risk and consumption of a specific food group 
(UPFs), it is important to consider that the overall dietary 
pattern and lifestyle have more effect than individual food 
intake. We believe that individuals with excessive UPFs 
consumption have other characteristics that comprise an 
unhealthy lifestyle, such as less physical activity, more hours 
of watching television, and tobacco use. In contrast, individ-
uals who consume a smaller amount of UPFs tend to adopt 
healthier lifestyles, such as following the Mediterranean 
diet, which can be beneficial for controlling and preventing 
hypertension.46 These aspects underscore the importance of 
cultural food practices, compared with a pattern of consum-
ing industrialized products, which are artificially produced 
and typically unhealthy.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal 
evaluation of the relationship between UPF consumption 
and hypertension. Other strengths of this study include the 
prospective design, relatively large sample size, long follow-
up period, and use of validated methods.24,26,28
Some limitations are also present. The FFQ used to evalu-
ate UPF consumption was not specifically designed for this 
purpose, which may underestimate or overestimate UPF 
consumption. However, the FFQ was previously validated 
and used to collect information about the main foods con-
sumed by the study population.26 Furthermore, although 
a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension was used, this 
method was previously validated in our cohort.24 Although 
we adjusted for potential confounders related to lifestyle and 
diet, potential residual confounding (i.e., factors associated 
with a healthy lifestyle and the Mediterranean dietary pat-
tern) may still exist. Furthermore, we conducted multiple sen-
sitivity analyses to account for additional mechanisms which 
might explain the relationship between UPF and hyperten-
sion, potential uncertainties in our assumptions regarding the 
induction period and also for possible sources of bias includ-
ing measurement errors. A healthier profile was observed in 
the SUN project participants, who were college graduates and 
may have more health awareness, which potentially implies 
an even greater consumption of UPFs in the general popula-
tion. Therefore, caution is required when extrapolating the 
results to the general population. Furthermore, the partici-
pants had high educational levels and were likely capable of 
providing higher quality self-reported data.
According to our study, excessive UPF consumption was 
associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension in a 
well-defined cohort of university graduates. Methods to encour-
age the consumption of plant foods, adoption of a healthy life-
style, and reestablish the food culture, such as the Mediterranean 
diet, are required. However, these results should be interpreted 
with caution, and other confirmatory studies are necessary.
