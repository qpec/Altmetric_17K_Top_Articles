Recent outbreaks of Zika, chikungunya and dengue highlight the importance of better
understanding the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes across multiple spatio-temporal
scales. Traditional surveillance tools are limited by jurisdictional boundaries and cost
constraints. Here we show how a scalable citizen science system can solve this problem by
combining citizen scientists’ observations with expert validation and correcting for
sampling effort. Our system provides accurate early warning information about the Asian
tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) invasion in Spain, well beyond that available from traditional
methods, and vital for public health services. It also provides estimates of tiger mosquito
risk comparable to those from traditional methods but more directly related to the
human–mosquito encounters that are relevant for epidemiological modelling and scalable
enough to cover the entire country. These results illustrate how powerful public participation
in science can be and suggest citizen science is positioned to revolutionize mosquito-borne
disease surveillance worldwide.

nvasive species that are also disease vectors play large
and growing roles in driving environmental change and
threatening public health1, 2. Climate change, the proliferation
of global trade routes and transportation technologies, and the
growth in human mobility have meant that non-native species are
increasingly introduced into new areas in which they are able to
thrive, while native species increasingly push the boundaries of
their ranges, all with implications for biodiversity, extinction,
ecosystem disruption and economic loss3–5. When these new
invaders also carry human diseases, their impacts balloon to
include altering pathogen transmission cycles and directly
threatening human health1, 2, 6, as recent and ongoing outbreaks
of Zika, chikungunya and dengue demonstrate7, 8.
The study of invasive disease vectors is of critical importance
for these reasons. It is often constrained, however, by questions of
scale. The same factors that make species invasions increasingly
prevalent also ensure that their analysis requires observation
across a large range of scales, from global to local in terms of
space; from centuries to minutes in terms of time1, 3, 9.
Traditional tools for monitoring and control are often impossible
to implement at the larger and smaller ends of this range of scales,
as dispersal through commercial shipping, airline traffic, motor
vehicles flows and other human activities allow invasive species
to quickly jump past jurisdictional boundaries and financially
constrained study sites, and as budgets for long-term and
fine-grained surveillance are cut to meet immediate needs10, 11.
What is needed is some mechanism providing the potential
for massive and sustained collaboration in data collection and
analysis—a mechanism that scales with the same flexibility as the
invasive species in question.
In fact, such a mechanism is among the core benefits promised
by
the
emerging
paradigm
of
networked
citizen
science.
Public participation in science, which dates back thousands of
years12–14, has entered a new phase as citizen scientists are now
being enlisted and linked on previously unimaginable scales by
the Internet, inexpensive mobile phones with powerful sensor
arrays, and other modern information and communications
technologies15, 16. These new networks of citizen scientists are
well positioned to study species invasions around the world
without hitting the geographic barriers and economic constraints
of traditional methods. We demonstrate this with Mosquito Alert,
a scalable citizen science system that we developed to tackle
the problem of Asian tiger mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) in
Spain17, 18.
The tiger mosquito is a potential vector of at least 22
arboviruses, including Zika, dengue and chikungunya. It breeds in
man-made containers, thrives in urban areas, and has spread
from the western Pacific and Southeast Asia to Europe, Africa, the
Middle East and the Americas over the past three decades19.
It was first detected and reported in Spain in 200420. It has since
become established along Spain’s eastern coast11, 17, 18, where it is
well known for its aggressive daytime biting, which degrades the
quality of life, harms summer tourism and presents a serious
epidemiological risk to which public health authorities at local,
regional, national and European levels have been attempting to
respond1, 8, 21.
As with other invasive species, the tiger mosquito invasion
shows a stratified dispersal strategy, combining small-scale
diffusion
with
long-distance
dispersal,
resulting
in
the
formation of isolated colonies that greatly increase the spread22.
With the tiger mosquito, these broader dispersal scales are
apparently facilitated by commercial shipping, airline traffic and
other human transportation11,
20–23. At small scales, tiger
mosquito
prevalence
and
disease
transmission
risks
vary
considerably based on complex interactions and feedbacks related
to
socio-ecological
factors24–27.
Traditional
tiger
mosquito
surveillance generally involves trapping the mosquito’s eggs using
ovitraps, small containers of water that must be set and
recursively checked by experts in the field. The tiger mosquito’s
fast-moving and jumpy invasion, combined with tight budgets,
however, has allowed it to frequently outpace ovitrap surveillance,
with initial detections in new areas coming instead from the
general public11, 20, 28, 29. That is consistent with the literature
suggesting that early warning and invasion-front mapping
are tasks for which citizen science is especially well suited30.
Moreover, the process of public detection is facilitated by the tiger
mosquito’s distinctive appearance and aggressive biting11, 20, 21,
making it simultaneously easy to recognize and difficult to ignore.
Mosquito Alert capitalizes on these characteristics, encouraging
the public to systematically report tiger mosquito sightings,
facilitating collaboration between citizen scientists, researchers,
and public health administrations, and raising awareness about
steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne
diseases. The goal is to generate an efficient system for research,
surveillance and control. This has involved outreach and training
to help citizen scientists (more than 38,400 registered to date,
with thousands of active participants at any given time during the
mosquito season) accurately identify and report tiger mosquitoes,
community
engagement
strategies
to
encourage
reporting,
and expert–citizen collaboration, whereby a team of entomolo-
gists reviews and validates all reports that include photographs31.
The important questions, of course, are how citizen science
differs from traditional methods and whether it can provide
information of comparable quality. To answer these questions, we
have collected data from two radically different surveillance
methods operating simultaneously across a large territory.
We have combined nearly 5000 Mosquito Alert reports from
citizen scientists with data on nearly every ovitrap monitored in
Spain during 2014–2015 (over 1500 traps, checked every
~2 weeks). We compare the citizen science data with the

terms
of

economic
cost,
(2) effectiveness as an early warning mechanism and (3) ability to
capture spatio-temporal variation in human–mosquito encounter
probabilities. We find that citizen science costs less than
traditional methods and provides early warning information and
human–mosquito encounter probabilities of comparable quality
with larger geographical coverage.
Results
Economic cost. Our first point of comparison is cost. Mosquito
Alert operated during 2014–2015 with a total budget of 300,000
Euros, covering 487,775 km2 in Spain for an average cost of about
1.23 Euros per km2 per month. In contrast, we estimate that the
much more labour-intensive ovitraps, which must be set and
checked by experts in the field and lab, cost about 9.36 Euros per
km2 per month (see Methods for detailed calculation)—nearly
eight times the cost of Mosquito Alert. Moreover, these ovitrap
costs are mostly recurring labour expenses, which should scale
linearly with area and time. In contrast, the Mosquito Alert costs
are mostly associated with community building and outreach and
non-recurring investments in technology, both aimed at main-
taining and attracting increasing numbers of participants year
after year.
Early warning. Table 1 and Figs. 1–3 compare the methods
credited with the first detections of tiger mosquitoes in Spanish
municipalities during 2014–2015. We observe that Mosquito
Alert accounts for first detections far beyond the known invasion
area, to which traditional surveillance methods are usually limited
(Fig. 1). The known invasion area comprises the municipalities in
which the mosquito has already been detected, and ovitraps are
usually deployed inside this area or in municipalities contiguous
with its edges (the invasion front). The Mosquito Alert detections
of tiger mosquitoes far beyond this area demonstrate that the
invasion process can occur in jumps.
The comparison between Mosquito Alert and ovitraps is
complicated somewhat by the fact that Mosquito Alert detections
in new municipalities (i.e., first detections) triggered ovitrap
deployment in some of these municipalities32, 33. We know that
this occurred in at least 11 cases32, 33, covering the regions of
Andalusia (5)26, Murcia (4), Aragon (1)27 and Catalonia (1), and
we
suspect
others
in
Valencia
and
the
Balearic
Islands.

this
is

 officially confirm the species’ presence, and this is usually done by
deploying ovitraps. If presence is confirmed, mosquito public
health protocols and management actions are activated, and the
new discovery is often reported in scientific publications32, 33, but
the source of the initial information that led the regional public
health actors to deploy ovitraps is not always clear. Figure 2
illustrates how this process played out in 2015 in the south of
Spain, after Mosquito Alert first detected tiger mosquitoes there
the previous year32. In Andalusia, ovitraps were deployed in five
municipalities from which reliable Mosquito Alert reports had
originated, but also in many other municipalities along the
coastline (Fig. 2). In four out of these five municipalities, tiger
mosquito presence was confirmed in the field by ovitraps. Given
this connection between Mosquito Alert reports and ovitrap
deployment, we distinguish, in the following analysis, between the
non-overlapping sets of municipalities in which ovitraps or
Mosquito Alert observations are alone responsible for the
detection and the overlapping sets of total municipalities for
which each source is credited.
Of 274 Spanish municipalities in which tiger mosquitoes were
detected for the first time in 2014–2015, Mosquito Alert is alone
credited with detections in 108 (39%). In total (including the
municipalities in which both sources are credited), Mosquito
Alert is credited with detections in 175 municipalities (64%).
In contrast, ovitraps are alone credited in 99 municipalities (36%),
with a total (including municipalities in which both are credited)
of 166 (61%). The municipalities for which Mosquito Alert is
alone credited and those for which ovitraps are alone credited
cover
approximately
the
same
area:
5761
and
5787 km2,
respectively, as do the totals for each source: 10,948 and 10,975
km2 (Table 1).
That Mosquito Alert detections tend to be farther from the
known invasion area than ovitrap detections (as noted above and
visible in Fig. 1) is clear from an analysis of the newly detected
municipalities. Of the municipalities for which Mosquito Alert is
alone credited, only 19% lie along the border of the known
invasion area. Of the total Mosquito Alert municipalities, only
25% lie along this border. The rest are separated from the known
invasion area by at least one intervening municipality. In contrast,
60% of the municipalities for which ovitraps are alone credited
and 50% of the total ovitrap municipalities lie along the border of
the known invasion area. A simple Chi-squared test of the
equality of these proportions against the alternative that the
ovitrap proportion is greater yields p-values well below 0.01,
regardless of whether we use the non-overlapping or the
overlapping sets of distances. Thus, the observed differences are
very unlikely to be the result of random variation alone.
The greater distance of Mosquito Alert detections from the
known invasion area can be further quantified if we compare
median and mean distances from the borders of the detected
municipalities to the nearest borders of the known invasion area.
The median and mean distances of the municipalities for
which Mosquito Alert is alone credited are 17 and 37 km, while
those of the municipalities for which ovitraps are alone credited
are 0 km (i.e., contiguous) and 20 km. If we include the
overlapping municipalities in these calculations, the Mosquito
Alert median drops only slightly, to 16 km, and its mean rises to
43 km, while the ovitrap median remains <0.5 km and its
mean rises to 34 km (Table 1). The difference between these
distributions is obvious in Fig. 3 and strongly supported by
Mann–Whitney tests, which yield p-values well below 0.01
regardless of whether overlapping municipalities are included.
The geographic scale of the Mosquito Alert detections is
especially apparent in the new detections located far to the
south and west of the known invasion front (Fig. 1)11, 33 and the
differences would be even more pronounced had Mosquito Alert
detections not triggered overlapping ovitrap detections.
We are confident that nearly all of the Mosquito Alert
detections
are
true
positives

on
a

with
municipalities
in
which
ovitraps
were
deployed
contemporaneously: of 125 municipalities in which ovitraps were
deployed and failed to detect tiger mosquitoes in 2015, only 4
were classified as positive by Mosquito Alert. This gives a
specificity (true negative rate) of 97%, assuming that ovitraps
have perfect sensitivity, and higher if the ovitraps failed to detect
true positives in any of these municipalities. This high specificity
makes sense, given that the Mosquito Alert early warning system

citizen science reports suggest presence; even when they are placed in these municipalities low ovitrap or population densities may generate false
negatives). Boundary data from Spanish National Geographic Institute53. © Instituto Geográfico Nacional

 We also use the comparison with ovitraps to estimate
sensitivity. Of 112 municipalities in which ovitraps were deployed
and detected tiger mosquitoes in 2015, 53 were classified as
positive by Mosquito Alert, giving a sensitivity (true positive rate)
of 47%. This figure must be interpreted in light of Mosquito
Alert’s large geographic coverage and the general problem of
surveillance sensitivity at the edges of invasion fronts, where
colonization is at an early stage and population densities are
low34. Moreover, any comparison between Mosquito Alert and
ovitrap sensitivity must take into account that the calculation of
the former treats the early warning system as having been
deployed country-wide. If we also treat ovitraps as a country-wide
early warning system, rather than considering only those
municipalities in which they were deployed, we can show that
its sensitivity is no more than double that of Mosquito Alert
but the results depend on a variety of assumptions. For example,
if we compare detections from each method across all of Spain,
we estimate that ovitraps have at best the same sensitivity as
Mosquito Alert. Excluding the known invasion area from that
calculation, ovitraps are no more than twice as sensitive as
Mosquito
Alert
and
limiting
the
analysis
to
the
set
of
municipalities falling within 30 km of the edge of the known
invasion area (still excluding the known invasion area itself),
ovitrap sensitivity is no more than 1.35 times that of Mosquito
Alert. The choice of calculation depends on how one views the
sensitivity question: excluding the known invasion area would
seem to be more consistent with the notion of early warning. In
all cases, the ratios drop if we increase the estimated specificity of
Mosquito Alert (see Methods, Eq. (1)).
Human–Mosquito encounter probabilities. Another advantage
of the citizen science
approach is its ability to provide
information about spatio-temporal variation, at both small and
large scales, in the probability of humans and mosquitoes coming
into contact—a key issue for understanding disease transmission
patterns and risks. We use Bayesian multilevel logistic regression
to estimate what we term ‘biweekly alert probability’, the
probability of at least one reliable tiger mosquito report being sent
through Mosquito Alert from a given geographic cell of ~20 km2
during
a
2-week
period,
conditional
on
sampling
effort
(see Methods).
Controlling for sampling effort is crucial to making sense of the
reporting data, and sampling effort is itself modelled as a function
of time elapsed since the participant downloaded the app as
well as intrinsic participant motivation (modelled as random
intercepts). Our sampling effort model (Fig. 4) suggests that
reporting is most likely immediately after the participant
registers, and that reporting propensity decreases with time.
A plausible explanation is that over time participants forget that
the app is installed. Most users had short participation times
(median and mean participation time are 12 and 46 days) but
some remained in the study for long periods (25% remains in for

 at least 57 days). Of these long-term participants, some continued
to send in reports while others did not (see Supplementary Fig. 3
for more information on participation times and withdrawal
rates, and Supplementary Table 1 for comparison of different
reporting propensity models). The reporting propensity model
predictions are used to estimate biweekly alert probabilities,
which we treat as a proxy for human–mosquito encounter
probability.
We make estimates for every day of the mosquito season
across Spain. Figure 5 shows mean September biweekly alert
probabilities
in
municipalities
across
eastern
Spain;
daily
estimates can be viewed in Supplementary Movies 1 and 2.
Parameter estimates for all models are shown in Table 2, and
described in detail in the Methods section.
To validate our results, we compare them with contempora-
neous information about tiger mosquito egg presence from
traditional ovitrap sampling in those municipalities in which
ovitraps were deployed. Figure 6 shows receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves for the Mosquito Alert biweekly
alert probability predictions at the municipality level, using
observed ovitrap egg presence as well as modelled ovitrap
egg presence as ‘ground truth’ (treating the model predictions of
>0.5 as positives). These curves provide a way to evaluate the
performance of a classifier, with greater area under the curve
(AUC) indicating better performance35, 36. Importantly, the ROC
curve is insensitive to changes in class distribution (i.e., the
proportion of positives in the population)35. The comparison
against the modelled ovitrap results gives an AUC of 0.85 and the
comparison against the raw oviposition data gives an AUC of
0.78. In both cases, the areas are well above the value of 0.5
that would result from random guessing. Using the modelled
ovitrap results as ‘ground truth’ gives a better result, but the
comparison with the actual observed data is also striking in that
the Mosquito Alert model is predicting actual ovitrap egg
presence over a 2-week period. If we pick the threshold that
gives the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity, we find that
the Mosquito Alert model can predict 84% of the egg presence
(sensitivity) and 75% of the egg absence (specificity) predicted
by the ovitrap model; it can predict 65% of the actual
municipality egg presence and 85% of the actual municipality
egg absence observed in the ovitraps (Fig. 6). We can see this
comparison directly in Fig. 7, which plots all of the daily
municipal Mosquito Alert predictions for which there was
also ovitrap data in 2015, indicating the ovitrap model prediction
(y axis) as well as the observed ovitrap result (colour) and the
Mosquito Alert sampling effort (size).
Discussion
Overall, the results suggest the potential for citizen science to
outperform traditional methods in many respects. With its
relatively low cost centred on non-recurring investments, citizen
science is inherently more scalable than traditional tools (Fig. 8).
This makes it possible for citizen science to greatly expand
surveillance areas even in the face of shrinking budgets. The
ease with which Mosquito Alert has been able to expand across
jurisdictions can be seen in its detections far beyond the known
invasion front where traditional ovitrap surveillance is usually
deployed (Fig. 1)18, 32, 33. These reports also rapidly connect
apparently isolated invasion areas (Fig. 1). The result is that

 Mosquito Alert facilitates early warning surveillance in new
regions and control in the areas already colonized.
Detection patterns were complex. Mosquito Alert failed to
detect tiger mosquitoes in some municipalities that had positive
ovitraps and vice versa. This illustrates the difficulty of finding
mosquitoes (and other invasive species) at the edges of the
invasion fronts or in other areas undergoing early colonization
stages, and the general problem of tracking species that exhibit
stratified dispersal22. The best solution would appear to be the
combination of citizen science with traditional methods, allowing
the two approaches to complement one another. We are
now working to better integrate citizen science with traditional
mosquito
surveillance
methods,
using
unified
sampling
procedures and management plans. Citizen scientists will play
increasingly important roles in the process and will be rewarded
with near-real-time information about surveillance and control
actions in their vicinity. Our hope is that this will also increase
public understanding about disease vector mosquitoes, and
encourage greater public participation in management efforts,
particularly in removing breeding sites from areas that official
control services cannot access (like private property). The
combination of rich and widespread citizen science information
and public involvement with traditional field surveillance and
management practices can provide a powerful set of tools for
fighting disease vector mosquitoes.
In addition to detecting the invasion front, it is crucial to study
the spatial variation in human–mosquito interaction within the
known range. This is particularly true in the case of disease
vectors, given the direct link to disease risk and transmission rates
and existing evidence that both vector density and human–vector
interaction can vary substantially across small geographic areas,
often linked to complex socio-economic conditions24–27. This is
also an area in which citizen science can provide good solutions to
the problems of scale encountered by traditional methods. Here,
however, sampling bias must be addressed22. As in other citizen
science platforms30, 37, 38, Mosquito Alert participants self-select
into the project—likely based on spatially correlated factors, like
exposure to information and socio-economic status39, 40. More-
over, while participants have access to the data collection tool (the
app) whenever they have their phones, their propensity to report a
tiger mosquito when they encounter it likely depends on spatially
and temporally correlated factors like whether they are at work,
driving a car or relaxing in their backyard. This means that the
density of Mosquito Alert observations is unlikely, on its own, to
provide a good estimate of tiger mosquito density or the prob-
ability of someone (not necessarily a participant) encountering a
tiger mosquito. To remedy this problem of sampling bias41, we
model sampling effort (Fig. 4).
Accounting in this way for sampling bias, we find that citizen
science gives us almost the same information and predictive
capabilities as we get from traditional surveillance tools. If we take
the ovitrap results (modelled or observed) as ‘ground truth,’ we
can calculate citizen science sensitivity, specificity and accuracy,
as well as the more robust measure of AUC. While citizen
science performs well under these tests, the more relevant
question for epidemiological purposes may be about the com-
putation of the probability of human–mosquito encounters. For
this latter purpose, citizen science provides the more direct—and
probably more accurate—estimate. Most importantly, the citizen
science results cover a vastly larger geographic area than those

 from ovitraps, and this allows for predictions about the tiger
mosquito distribution across Spain (and potentially across the
globe) (Fig. 8).
This
discussion
shows
the
importance
of
considering
socio-ecological
dynamics.
Research
on
disease-vector
mosquitoes has identified gaps in our knowledge of the
complex socio-ecological systems in which these mosquitoes
are embedded24. Variation in and interactions between vector
prevalence, exposure, reporting propensity and participation
in control efforts across socio-economic gradients show that
mosquito control hinges as much on an understanding of humans
as it does on an understanding of insects24. Citizen science
often struggles to attract a socio-economically diverse pool of
participants39, and that challenge is clearly vital to ensuring
not only the equitable distribution of benefits stemming from
participation, but also sound scientific outcomes.
Another important issue that this discussion raises is the ways
in which citizen science information is evaluated and employed.
Here it is important to consider ‘fitness for use’. That concept,
with roots in geography, emphasizes that data quality must be
evaluated in light of the particular purpose to which the data will
be put42. It is an idea at the heart of a growing research field that
is rapidly improving the quality and quantity of citizen science
data38, 43, 44. This improvement potential, along with scalability,
makes citizen science particularly powerful for illuminating the
human role in mosquito dispersal.
The highly networked form of citizen science discussed
here shares many characteristics with other new and emerging
methods and data sources centred around the internet and mobile
communications devices, including the volume and ‘velocity’ of
the data (the latter term describing the potential for real-time
analysis and response), as well as the extent to which it depends
on changing patterns of human–computer interaction and crowd
dynamics45. These latter characteristics suggest that special care
needs to be taken with the analysis of citizen science data
over time to avoid unexpected biases caused by changes in the
algorithms behind data collection platforms or the behaviour of
the people and groups interacting with those platforms. Drawing
on experiences in the broader ‘big data’ context, this means
building in robustness checks and validation using multiple
data sources, and frequently recalibrating models46, 47. For
example, the observed patterns of participation time and
reporting propensity could well change over time and so should
be rechecked regularly, with models adjusted accordingly.
This work is the proof-of-concept that citizen science has huge
potential for combatting mosquito-borne diseases. Indeed, our
experience has led us to expand Mosquito Alert to include not
only
tiger
mosquitoes
but
also
Yellow
Fever
mosquitoes
(Aedes aegypti) and to take an increasingly global focus, working
with UN Environment, the Woodrow Wilson International Cen-
ter for Scholars, the European, Australian and American Citizen
Science Associations, the growing citizen science community in
Southeast Asia, and mosquito-related citizen science projects and
research groups around the world to create the Global Mosquito
Alert initiative48. Citizen science is a highly scalable and affordable
complement to traditional surveillance methods for targeted
mosquitoes. Not only can it raise public awareness and involve-
ment, it can also provide useful and scientifically sound data
across broader spatial areas and temporal periods. Citizen science
can make it possible to replace large and expensive ovitrap
deployments with more restricted and prioritized expert man-
agement in the field. Finally, adding citizen-science-based vector
data to existing habitat suitability49 and disease50 models holds
particular promise for addressing epidemiological risks at key
operational scales, from global to local.
Methods
Data collection. Data were collected in Spain from oviposition traps (ovitraps) and
the Mosquito Alert citizen science platform during 2014–2015. Ovitraps are small,
dark containers in which tiger mosquitoes lay eggs and in which those eggs can be
easily detected. A total of 1558 ovitraps were placed in Spain (Fig. 7), in the
provinces of Alicante, Almería, Islas Baleares, Cádiz, Castellón, Granada, Gui-
púzcoa, Huelva, Huesca, Málaga, Murcia, Sevilla, Valencia. The ovitraps were set
repeatedly throughout the year, mostly between June and November, and checked
for tiger mosquito eggs after ~2 weeks of exposure.

 Mosquito Alert reports have been collected continuously since June 2014 from
citizen scientists across the globe, focused mostly in Spain (Fig. 7). The Mosquito
Alert mobile phone application helps participants correctly identify tiger mosquitoes
and lets them easily create sighting reports (observations) that include geolocation, a
brief taxonomic survey (which asked whether (1) the mosquito is it small and black
with white stripes, whether (2) it has a white stripe on the head and thorax and
whether (3) it has white stripes on the abdomen and legs), optional photographs and
optional notes. (In 2016, the system was expanded to include also Yellow Fever
mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, given their important role in Zika, dengue and
chikungunya transmission in many countries; as a result the taxonomic survey has
changed). Reports are subsequently validated by a team of entomologists, based on
the attached photographs. The entomological validation scores fall into six categories
‘confirmed Tiger’, ‘probably Tiger’, ‘unclassifiable’, ‘probably not Tiger’ and ‘surely
not Tiger’31. A report is coded as ‘reliable’ if it is expert validated under categories
‘confirmed’ or ‘probable’, or if the entomological team is unable to give it a score
(because it lacks photos or because the photos are not clear) but the participant
confirms the observation based on the brief taxonomic survey. Indeed, unsupervised
classification of expert-based report scores51, 52, shows that participant answers to the
brief taxonomic survey are among the top five predictors of expert scores (an
affirmative triplet, meaning high scoring), together with the number of reports that
are close in time and space to the targeted report and the total number of reports sent
by the participant52. For the early warning analysis, we use the 1976 reports under
categories ‘confirmed’ and ‘probable’ submitted during 2014–2015 in Spanish
territory (excluding Ceuta, Melilla and the Canary Islands). For the human–mosquito
encounter analysis, we use the 4767 reliable reports submitted during this time period
and from this geographic area. Including survey-based reports (without pictures)
allowed us to improve our modelling and statistical significance, and appears
qualitatively to produce the same results we would expect from the more accurate but
smaller set of 1976 reports under categories ‘confirmed’ and ‘probable’.
Mosquito Alert also collects anonymous information on the geographic
distribution of its citizen scientist participants in order to correct for biases caused
by uneven sampling effort. Although participants may opt out of this feature, by
default the Mosquito Alert Android application uses satellite and network data to
estimate the location of the device five times per day at random times between 7:00
am and 10:00 pm (thus excluding the times when tiger mosquitoes are least likely to
be active). Before transmitting these locations to the server, the application rounds
them down to the nearest 0.05° latitude and longitude, thereby assigning them to
sampling cells of ~20 km2 and protecting participants’ privacy. No data are collected
on the exact location within each sampling cell, or on any other information about
the participant. The sampled locations are linked only to randomly generated
participant identifiers that are different from the identifiers used for participant
reports and other data in order to avoid the risk of re-identification.
Surveillance economic cost calculations. Ovitrap costs were estimated from
detailed information on the ovitrap program in Murcia province during
2014–2015. That program required ~181,074 Euros to deploy 900 traps at
450 sampling points across the province, taking a total of 13,500 samples over
7 months. For comparison with Mosquito Alert, we aggregate these samples by
biweekly period (the approximate duration trap exposure) and sampling cell.
The sum of the sampling cell areas across all biweeks sampled is 38,710 km2, which
gives an average cost of 4.68 Euros per km2 per biweek or 9.36 Euros per km2 per
month. We assume the cost in Spain scales approximately linearly by time
and area covered because 97% of the Murcia estimate consists of recurring
labour and transportation expenses that depend on distances travelled and
areas sampled.
Mosquito Alert costs were calculated from the total project budget for
2014–2015 of 300,000 Euros. For each biweekly period, we take only sampling cells
with non-zero sampling effort (meaning that a participant was detected in the
cell during that period). The sum of the area of these cells across all biweeks
is 487,775 km2, which gives an average cost of 0.62 Euros per km2 per biweek or
1.23 Euros per km2 per month.

 Early warning and surveillance performance analysis. The performance of
Mosquito Alert as an early warning system discussed in the main text is based on a
straightforward accounting of the two main surveillance methodologies that have
been the basis for the first tiger mosquito detections in each municipality: ovitrap
networks and citizen science (Mosquito Alert). For this analysis, we only used the
expert validated reports scored by the entomological team as ‘probable’ or ‘definite’
tiger mosquitoes. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to compute the
number of municipalities, the total area covered, and the distributions of near
distances to the invasion front as known at the end of 201317. We factored this
information for each of the surveillance methodologies used, distinguishing
municipalities where the discoveries have been generated by ovitraps alone,
ovitraps alone and in combination with Mosquito Alert, and by Mosquito
Alert alone and Mosquito Alert in combination with ovitraps. GIS data sets
were obtained from Mosquito Alert data, ovitrap layers17, 18, from Spanish
administrative boundaries53 and other global baseline layers54.
To calculate ovitrap early warning system sensitivity, we use the following
equation:
TPRo
TPRm
¼ TPo
TPm
¼ Po � N � FPRo
Pm � N � FPRm
ð1Þ
where TPRm and TPRo are true positive rates (sensitivities) for Mosquito Alert
and ovitraps, respectively, TPm and TPo are the true positive counts for Mosquito
Alert and ovitraps, respectively, FPRm and FPRo are the false positive rates
(1 − specificity) for Mosquito Alert and ovitraps, respective, Pm and Po are the
number of positives detected by Mosquito Alert and ovitraps, and N is the total
number of negative municipalities in Spain (i.e., municipalities without tiger
mosquito presence).
In 2014–2015 there were 390 municipalities classified as positive by Mosquito
Alert (Pm), of which 175 were outside the known invasion area. There were also
166 municipalities classified as positive by ovitraps (Po), all of them outside the
known invasion area. We use 0.03 as the false positive rate for Mosquito Alert
based on the comparison of 125 municipalities in which ovitraps were placed
and failed to detect tiger mosquitoes during 2015 (only four of which were
classified as positive by Mosquito Alert) and we assume that the false positive rate
for ovitraps is 0. We do not know the total number of negative municipalities in
Spain (N) but we can put an upper bound on it by subtracting all those classified
as positive by ovitraps as of the end of 2015 (538), from the total number of
Spanish municipalities (8033, excluding the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla).
That gives us 7495 as the maximum value of N, which means that the maximum
ratio of ovitrap to Mosquito Alert sensitivity (Eq. (1)) is 1.01 if the known invasion
area is included, and 2.07 if it is excluded. If we reduce the estimated false positive
rate of Mosquito Alert to 0, the ratios fall to 0.43 including the known invasion area
and 0.95 excluding it. In other words, as a country-wide early warning system,
ovitraps have, at most, twice the sensitivity of Mosquito Alert, but possibly much
lower sensitivity.
Including the known invasion area in the calculation may be too far from
the notion of early warning and also may bias the result in favour of Mosquito
Alert because ovitraps tend not to be placed within that area. On the other hand,
excluding the known invasion area while including all other Spanish municipalities
may bias the result in the other direction. An alternative comparison might
focus only on the edge of the known invasion area. For example, if we consider
only the 1398 municipalities that lie within 30 km of the known invasion area
(and excluding those in the known invasion area itself), we have 141 classified
as positive by Mosquito Alert, 139 classified as positive by ovitraps and a
maximum value for N of 1259. This gives a maximum ratio of ovitrap to Mosquito
Alert sensitivity (Eq. (1)) of 1.35. Reducing the estimated false positive rate for
Mosquito Alert to 0 brings the ratio to 0.99.

 for both models is the sampling cell described above, defined by a grid of 0.05°
latitude and longitude (~20 km2) and used for masking participant location
information. All models, apart from the comparison of ovitrap and Mosquito Alert
results, were fit using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations implemented with
Stan and R using the rstanarm package55–58. Each simulation was run on four
parallel chains for 2000 iterations each, with the first 1000 iterations discarded as
warmup. Potential scale reduction factor calculations59 and visual inspection of the
chains for each parameter suggested convergence. Goodness of fit and model
selection was based on Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC), calculated
using the loo package for R60, 61. (WAIC was chosen over the leave-one-out
method for computational reasons.) The comparison of ovitrap and Mosquito
Alert results was done using ROC curves calculated with the pROC package for
R62.
For the ovitrap data, the probability of tiger mosquito egg presence (π) at trap
i placed for x days in sampling cell j on day-of-year d was estimated in a Bayesian
multilevel model with random intercepts for trap (αi) and sampling cell (βj) and
random slopes at the sampling cell level for day-of-year (γj), day-of-year squared
(δj) and day-of-year cubed (ζj) (in order to capture the nonlinear seasonal cycle).
The choice of egg presence (a binary variable) as opposed to number of eggs
(a count) as the outcome is based on concerns that the ovitrap egg counts are
less reliable and less consistent across ovitraps and study sites. The model treats
egg presence as a Bernoulli random variable with probability (π) and log odds
(log(π/(1 − π))) given mean μ specified as:
μijd ¼ αi þ βj þ γjd þ δjd2 þ ζjd3 þ ηx
ð2Þ
The slope and intercept parameters are estimated using weakly informative
prior distributions. Each slope parameter is assigned a normal prior distribution
with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 100. Estimated parameters were centred
and standardized and given weakly informative Cauchy prior distributions with
location 0 and scaling factor 2.5. The choice of the Cauchy distribution is based on
literature suggesting that it outperforms Gaussian and Laplace alternatives and has
other desirable properties63.
For the Mosquito Alert data, the probability of at least one reliable report (π)
sent from sampling cell j during the 2-week period leading up to day-of-year
d given sampling effort x was estimated in a Bayesian multilevel model with
random intercepts for sampling cell (βj)and random slopes at the sampling cell
level for day-of-year (γj), day-of-year squared (δj) and day-of-year cubed (ζj)
(again, to capture seasonal cycle). The choice of the binary variable of at least one
reliable report, as opposed to number of reports, as the outcome is based on
concerns over possible autocorrelation in reporting by a given participant or group
of participants during short time spans. This choice also has the advantage of
making the model easily comparable with the ovitrap model. The model treats the
presence of at least one reliable report as a Bernoulli random variable with
probability (π) and log odds (log(π/(1 − π))) given mean μ specified as:
μjd ¼ βj þ γjd þ δjd2 þ ζjd3 þ η log x
ð Þ
ð3Þ
This model is estimated using centred and standardized variables given the same
prior distributions as with the ovitrap model in Eq. (2).
While Eqs. (2) and (3) show the ovitrap and Mosquito Alert models discussed
in the main text, five alternative models were also tested. These models entailed the
following differences: (a) removing the cubic term from the seasonality polynomial,
(b) removing the cubic and square terms from the seasonality polynomial,
(c) making the seasonality polynomial terms main effects instead of random slopes,
(d) making the seasonality polynomial terms main effects instead of random
slopes and removing the cubic term and (e) removing the exposure term (in the
case of the ovitrap model) and the sampling effort term (in the case of the
Mosquito Alert model). Estimates from all models are shown in Table 2.
We prefer the models described in Eqs. (2) and (3) to these alternatives based
on theoretical considerations as well as on a comparison of expected log pointwise
predictive density (ELPD) estimated as WAIC60. From a theoretical perspective,
using a third degree polynomial allows a more realistic seasonality curve than the
simple parabola forced by a second degree polynomial. Treating this polynomial as
a set of random slopes, rather than main effects, allows for seasonal effects to vary
by sampling cell and thus should be more reliable over large geographic areas.
Finally, exposure (for ovitraps) and sampling effort have logical connections to the
probability of egg presence or report transmission, as discussed in the main text. In
terms of WAIC, the models in Eqs. (2) and (3) have higher ELPDs than any of the
alternatives. For the Mosquito Alert models the difference in ELPDs is greater than
twice the ELPD standard error in all cases except for the comparison between the
chosen model and the one with the third degree seasonality polynomial as a set of
main effects. This could be a basis for choosing the latter model, given its
Fig. 8 Ovitrap and citizen scientist locations. Top left: blue markers show locations of sampling cells containing the 1558 ovitraps used in the analysis,

did not opt out of the background tracking feature). In all cases, white square at centre of marker shows actual sampling cell size, while coloured border is

 simplicity. We opted to keep the former, however, based on the theoretical
considerations of geographically varying seasonality curves, which should be
increasingly important as the project expands. For the ovitrap models, the only
ELPD difference that is less than twice the ELPD standard error is that between the
chosen model and the model without exposure. This is presumably due to the small
variation in exposure times in the data, and exposure was retained in the model on
the assumption that this might vary more in future ovitrap data. Model summaries
and ELPD estimates are shown in Table 2.
Sampling effort was calculated as the sum of participant-sightings (through the
random location sampling of the Android app) in the sampling cell during the two-
week period, weighted by each participant’s reporting propensity score at the time
of sighting. The reporting propensity score is estimated from a model of reporting
activity as a function of time elapsed since the participant first downloaded the app
and registered with the project (participation time), and intrinsic motivation
(Fig. 8). The score is calculated as the marginal probability of a randomly drawn
participant ever sending a report, multiplied by the probability of a participant
sending at least one report on a given day, conditional on that participant ever
sending a report. The conditional probability is modelled as a function of the
number of days elapsed since the participant downloaded the app and registered
with the project, with a random intercept at the participant level to capture
intrinsic motivation (and using only participants who ever sent a report in the
model). The outcome variable here is, again, binary, in order to avoid problems of
autocorrelation related to the reporting behaviour of participants at short time
spans. The model treats the presence of at least one report from participant i sent x
days from registration as a Bernoulli random variable with mean (πi) and log odds
(log(πi/(1 − πi)) given mean μi specified as:
μi ¼ αi þ βx þ γx2 þ δx3
ð4Þ
We estimated this model using the same weakly informative prior distributions
as used in the models shown in Eqs. (2) and (3). We also compared this model to
alternative specifications using only participation time and participation time
squared, using only participation time, and leaving out participation time entirely
(see Supplementary Table 1). We selected the model reported here (Eq. 4) based on
a combination of theoretical considerations and a comparison of goodness of fit of
alternative specifications. From a theoretical perspective, we expected reporting
propensity to drop over time, but we found it unlikely that this would be a linear
relationship. In terms of model fit, the selected model has higher ELPD than the
others, estimated with both the WAIC and leave-one out cross validation (LOO)60
(Supplementary Table 1).
One complication of fitting this model is that the data are highly skewed
towards short participation times: Most users who send a report do so very soon
after registering and most drop out of the study after just over a month (median
participation time = 12 days), creating a high degree of imbalance in the data set,
which complicates estimation64. To reduce bias and variance caused by this
imbalance, we employed a non-parametric pre-processing technique, dropping the
highest 5% and lowest 5% of the participation times and then resampling the data
with sampling weights inverse to the proportion of each total participation time (in
days) in the remaining data64. This resulted in greater balance of participation
times, which were then used as the independent variable in the reporting
propensity model, improving our parameter estimates.
Both the ovitrap and Mosquito Alert models were used to make daily
predictions, for every day of the mosquito season at the sampling cell level. These
predicted probabilities were scaled up to the municipality level as follows: for each
municipality, 1000 draws were taken from the posterior predictive distributions of
the sampling cells falling within the municipality, with the probability of drawing
from a given sampling cell’s distribution given by the proportion of the
municipality’s territory covered by that cell. This gives an estimate of the expected
value of the probability experienced at a point placed randomly within that
municipality.
