Summary
Pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia with oral tracheal intubation is the technique of choice for trauma patients who
cannot maintain their airway or achieve adequate ventilation. It should be carried out as soon as safely possible, and
performed to the same standards as in-hospital emergency anaesthesia. It should only be conducted within organisa-
tions with comprehensive clinical governance arrangements. Techniques should be straightforward, reproducible, as
simple as possible and supported by the use of checklists. Monitoring and equipment should meet in-hospital anaes-
thesia standards. Practitioners need to be competent in the provision of in-hospital emergency anaesthesia and have
supervised pre-hospital experience before carrying out pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia. Training programmes
allowing the safe delivery of pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia by non-physicians do not currently exist in the UK.
Where pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia skills are not available, oxygenation and ventilation should be maintained
with the use of second-generation supraglottic airways in patients without airway reflexes, or basic airway manoeu-
vres and basic airway adjuncts in patients with intact airway reflexes.

What other guideline statements are available on
this topic?
The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain
and Ireland (AAGBI) first produced guidelines on
this area of practice in 2009 [1]. Other related
guidelines have been produced in Scandinavia [2]
and in the USA [3].
•
Why were these guidelines developed?
The guidelines were first developed because pre-
hospital anaesthesia is carried out on a daily basis
in the UK, and standards of care were ill defined.
They set achievable standards which were endorsed
by key organisations. This version updates these
guidelines, taking into account changes in clinical
practice, pre-hospital infrastructure and new related
guidelines that have impacted on the practice of
pre-hospital anaesthesia.
•
How and why does this statement differ from exist-
ing guidelines?
This updated guideline emphasises the core mate-
rial
produced
in
the
initial
guideline,
but
is
updated to reflect changes in UK pre-hospital
infrastructure
and
recent
guidelines
on
airway
management, trauma management and emergency
in-hospital anaesthesia and monitoring. There are
significant differences to Scandinavian and US
guidelines, mostly related to differences in emer-
gency medical services (EMS) infrastructure and
providers.
Introduction
There are existing local and national guidelines for
pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA) and air-
way management [2, 4]. Since the first version of these
UK guidelines was produced [1], significant develop-
ments have taken place in UK pre-hospital care. The
number of air ambulances staffed with doctor–parame-
dic teams in the UK has increased, and with this the
frequency of PHEA. Pre-hospital emergency medicine
(PHEM) has been recognised by the General Medical
Council as a subspecialty, and pre-hospital training
organisations are required to demonstrate clear evi-
dence of a clinical governance structure.
Although the evidence base for pre-hospital care
and PHEA is still of relatively low quality, much has
been published recently. For example, available data
on pre-hospital tracheal intubation failure rates have
more than tripled, and have been used as one indicator
to confirm the importance of experience and training
in successful pre-hospital anaesthesia [5–7].
In 2007, the ‘Trauma: who cares?’ National Confi-
dential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death
(NCEPOD) report documented poor pre-hospital air-
way management [8]. A significant proportion of seri-
ously injured patients were delivered to emergency
departments with airway compromise, and this is not
unique to the UK [9]. More recently, it has been
demonstrated that, in a significant number of trauma
patients,
basic
and
advanced

management

 without PHEA does not reliably correct airway com-
promise [10].
The majority of severely ill and injured patients
have intact airway reflexes, and require drugs to facili-
tate tracheal intubation. In contrast, tracheal intuba-
tion has not been shown to improve outcome in
patients with cardiac arrest [11], and drugs are not
usually required to facilitate tracheal intubation in this
patient group.
Many UK pre-hospital services have aspired to
achieve the key message of the AAGBI 2009 Pre-hos-
pital anaesthesia guidelines – that, despite variable pre-
hospital conditions, the standard of care delivered
should be the same as that for in-hospital emergency
anaesthesia [1]. Recent evidence has shown that anaes-
thesia in the Emergency Department is not without
problems [12], and the standardisation of technique,
along
with
safety
adjuncts
such
as
pre-induction
checklists are probably essential in both the pre-hospi-
tal and Emergency Department environments.
This guideline outlines safety considerations in the
key areas of pre-hospital anaesthetic practice: training
and clinical governance; conduct and technique; moni-
toring; environmental considerations; and minimum data
collection for performance and incident reporting. It does
not consider local and regional anaesthetic techniques.
Although there are many options for the safe deliv-
ery of PHEA, the principles of simplicity and standardi-
sation
are
used
in
this
document
to
provide
a
framework for safe delivery of emergency anaesthesia by
experienced pre-hospital doctors from anaesthetic or
non-anaesthetic training backgrounds. It is recognised
that pre-hospital practitioners without PHEA compe-
tency provide the majority of pre-hospital care in the
UK, and make an essential contribution to pre-hospital
airway management. It is essential that pre-hospital per-
sonnel not trained in the delivery of PHEA ensure that
basic airway manoeuvres are applied immediately and
effectively for any patient with airway compromise [4].
This may be facilitated by managing the patient in the
lateral trauma position where appropriate [2, 13].
Local organisation
All
pre-hospital
organisations
(immediate
care
schemes,
hospital-related
schemes, Medical Emer-
gency
Response
Incident
Teams
(MERIT),
air
ambulance providers and NHS Ambulance Service
Trusts) must provide appropriate, easily accessible
and ongoing support to practitioners who undertake
PHEA.
Pre-hospital emergency medicine trainees under-
taking PHEA without direct supervision must have
immediate access to advice from a senior PHEM clini-
cian who is fully competent in PHEA and pre-hospital
critical
care.
Non-trainees
who
undertake
PHEA
should also ideally have reliable access to senior tele-
phone support.
Key organisational components for safe PHEA are:
•
A named, responsible lead clinician with extensive
PHEM experience, who ensures delivery of compe-
tency-based initial and refresher training specific
for PHEA, including: simulation practice; regular
review of PHEAs undertaken and constructive feed-
back to individual providers; and regular appraisal
of practitioners undertaking PHEA.
•
A robust clinical governance structure that will:
ensure each practitioner is competent; ensure col-
lection of key data on PHEA performed to enable
quality benchmarking of pre-hospital advanced air-
way
management
[14];
provide
regular
case
reviews, audit and an adverse event reporting sys-
tem feeding into a risk register database; and pro-
vide regular reviews of guidelines and standard
operating procedures in the light of emerging evi-
dence.
Pre-hospital anaesthesia for children
It is increasingly recognised that anaesthesia for chil-
dren aged 8 years or under is a sub-specialist area of
in-hospital anaesthesia. Young children with severe
injuries are uncommon, but can present pre-hospital
practitioners with significant challenges. All pre-hospi-
tal organisations must have written guidelines for the
treatment of children that reflect the skills of their
practitioners.
In general terms, the threshold for anaesthesia and
tracheal intubation in young children is high. The
majority can be adequately managed with simple air-
way techniques [15]. Pre-hospital emergency anaesthe-
sia
is
considered
only
after
careful
risk–benefit
analysis.

 anaesthetic practitioner with appropriate equipment is
present, and that simple airway manoeuvres combined
with oxygen therapy have failed to provide a patent
airway
or
adequate
oxygenation.
However,
where
PHEA is necessary, it is usually straightforward with
high intubation success rates [16].
In difficult circumstances, rapid transfer to the
nearest hospital to enable advanced airway manage-
ment may be appropriate, even if definitive care needs
to be undertaken at a different hospital.
Personnel and training
Individual competence
Pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia carries more risk
than in-hospital anaesthesia. Skilled anaesthetic assis-
tance may not be available, and both environmental
and patient factors increase risk. Pre-hospital emer-
gency anaesthesia should not be undertaken in profes-
sional isolation. Providers should have the same level
of training and competence that would enable them to
perform unsupervised emergency anaesthesia and tra-
cheal
intubation
in
the
emergency
department
[17, 18]. Since PHEA is potentially hazardous [12],
and considerable resource is spent to ensure that
anaesthetists who perform rapid sequence induction
(RSI) in hospitals can do so safely, pre-hospital care
standards should at least match these standards.
Some studies have demonstrated low success rates
and significant complications when RSI and tracheal
intubation are undertaken by individuals with rela-
tively little training [19]. The 2007 NCEPOD ‘Trauma:
Who Cares?’ report concluded that “if pre-hospital
intubation is to be part of pre-hospital trauma manage-
ment, then it needs to be in the context of a physician-
based pre-hospital care system” [8].
The training required for undertaking pre-hospital
anaesthesia safely and competently has been described
by the Intercollegiate Board for Training in Pre-hospi-
tal Emergency Medicine (IBTPHEM) [17]. Skills in
both anaesthesia and the ability to work safely in the
pre-hospital environment are required. Competence
should be defined by these skills, rather than by the
primary specialty of the individual.
The Royal College of Anaesthetists requires that
all anaesthetists in training complete an Initial Assess-
ment of Competence before giving anaesthesia without
direct supervision. This assessment is completed by the
trainee after about 3 months of anaesthesia training,
and includes the ability to perform RSI and a failed
intubation routine. The Initial Assessment of Compe-
tence confirms that the individual has the essential
skills to undertake anaesthesia in ASA 1 or 2 patients
in hospital. However, the achievement of this standard
does not imply competence to induce anaesthesia in a
severely injured patient in any setting.
The two-year acute care common stem (ACCS)
training
programme
provides
individuals
with
6 months of training in emergency and acute medicine
and a year in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine.
However, doctors completing ACCS training are inex-
perienced in managing the airway of complex patients,
and will need further training before undertaking
unsupervised pre-hospital RSI and tracheal intubation.
The ACCS programme (or equivalent training) is
considered the absolute minimum required for an indi-
vidual entering a training programme in pre-hospital
emergency medicine. Specific training for working in the
pre-hospital environment is also essential. The IBT-
PHEM and the Faculty of Pre-Hospital Care of the Royal
College of Surgeons of Edinburgh are currently the lead
organisations setting standards for physician pre-hospi-
tal working, qualification and competence. Ideally, doc-
tors likely to be undertaking PHEA should, in the future,
successfully complete the IBTPHEM subspecialty train-
ing in pre-hospital emergency medicine [17].
Anaesthetic assistance should be provided by an
appropriately trained healthcare professional who has
been signed off for extended pre-hospital care practice,
or assessed to provide specific pre-hospital critical care
skills. Rarely, it may be appropriate to proceed without
trained assistance on the basis of an individual case
risk–benefit analysis.
Working under the close supervision of experienced
practitioners is an essential step towards independent
pre-hospital practice. Having achieved PHEA compe-
tence, skills need to be maintained by undertaking the
procedure regularly. The precise number of PHEAs
required to maintain competence is not defined. An aver-
age of one a month has been previously suggested as a
minimum. There is a significant difference in the
reported
incidence
of
difficult
tracheal
intubation
between clinicians considered either ‘competent’ or

 ‘expert’ (based on the number of intubations performed
per year) [20]. Unless an individual is working in a very
busy pre-hospital programme, it is likely that competence
in RSI and tracheal intubation will be achieved only with
regular in-hospital experience of RSI and tracheal intuba-
tion, supplemented with simulation experience where
necessary. Assessment of competence in PHEA should
always involve direct pre-hospital observation by experi-
enced senior clinicians. Simulator practice may usefully
supplement clinical experience. Practitioners undertaking
PHEA must keep a log of procedures to be included in a
clinical governance structure.
Crew resource management techniques are of par-
ticular importance in the pre-hospital environment,
and it is critical that teams have the opportunity to
train and practice regularly in order to ensure the best
possible delivery of care. Pre-hospital care teams need
to be adaptable to changes in their environment to
ensure scene and patient safety. Appendix 1 discusses
safe PHEA in challenging environments.
The Working Party is aware of variable interna-
tional practice with regard to non-physician delivered
drug-assisted
intubation.
Although
non-physician
delivered PHEA is relatively uncommon, the adminis-
tration of sedation to facilitate intubation is reported
in some healthcare systems. Working Party members
are aware of published evidence that has highlighted
major safety concerns, particularly where non-physi-
cians have administered neuromuscular blocking drugs
[21, 22], and do not believe that existing training pro-
grammes enable safe unsupervised administration of
anaesthesia by non-physicians outside physician-led
teams in the UK. A similar position is stated in recent
NICE trauma guidelines [4].
The Working Party believes that all practitioners
providing PHEA should have adequate in-hospital
emergency anaesthetic training and experience, and be
able to demonstrate the necessary competencies before
adapting in-hospital practice for pre-hospital practice.
Equipment and monitoring
Standards of equipment and monitoring used for PHEA
should match those applied to in-hospital anaesthetic
practice [23]. To prevent cross-infection, most pre-hospi-
tal providers have to use ambulance or hospital sterilisa-
tion facilities, or rely on disposable equipment.
Equipment
Pre-hospital equipment must be portable, robust and
weather-resistant, and be effective under varying lighting
conditions. Electrical equipment must have an adequate
battery reserve. Equipment for very adverse conditions
(e.g. extreme temperature environments) needs careful
selection and confirmation of suitability before use.
The equipment required for pre-hospital anaesthe-
sia is shown in Table 1.
Monitoring
Clinical assessment, combined with monitoring, is used
to record the patient’s condition from the preparation
phase, through induction and maintenance, and into
the postintubation and transfer phase. Measured values
can be recorded manually or electronically during the
whole period, although it is recognised that manual
recording is difficult in the emergency setting.
Clinical
measurement
and
observation
should
include: the presence or absence of a pulse, its location
and rate; respiratory rate; pupil size and reactivity,
lacrimation if present; and the presence or absence of
muscular activity and limb movements.
Invasive monitoring is possible, but can be difficult
in the pre-hospital phase, and is mainly used for inter-
hospital transfer. Non-invasive monitoring includes, as
a minimum: heart rate; non-invasive blood pressure;

thesia (PHEA).

 oxygen saturation; continuous waveform capnography;
and electrocardiography [23].
Vital signs should be measured and recorded at
least every 3 min. As oxygen or an oxygen–air mix are
the only commonly used gases during PHEA, anaes-
thetic gas monitoring is rarely used in the pre-hospital
environment. Gas supply failure alarms should be pre-
sent
on
mechanical
ventilators.
Nerve
stimulation
devices are also rarely used in the pre-hospital envi-
ronment. With these exceptions, monitoring in the
pre-hospital environment should aim to meet the cur-
rent AAGBI guidelines on anaesthetic monitoring [23].
Monitoring of end-tidal CO2 is mandatory during
PHEA. Although qualitative capnography can be used
to help confirm intubation, quantitative waveform
capnography is required to prevent hyper- or hypoven-
tilation. It is important to ensure that the circuit and
equipment is connected and functional before induc-
tion. Temperature monitoring should be considered
particularly for vulnerable patient groups (e.g. children
or those with significant burns).
Audiovisual
alarms
on
monitoring
equipment
should be set so that they can be detected in the noisy
pre-hospital environment. Monitoring may need to be
temporarily
suspended
during
difficult
extrication.
Appendix 2 discusses minimum data collection and
key performance indicators.
Technique (general principles)
The principles of PHEA are similar to those for in-
hospital emergency anaesthesia. Techniques should be
simple, reproducible and well-practised. A primary
aim is to secure first-pass tracheal intubation with
minimal
cardiorespiratory
compromise.
The
most
commonly used induction drugs and neuromuscular
blocking drugs can be used in pre-hospital care with
appropriate considerations. Drug choice depends on
the physiological state of the patient, and operator
familiarity with the drug.
The balance between optimising clinical condition
before transfer and getting the patient to definitive care
without delay will determine which interventions are
undertaken before transport to hospital. Although
PHEA increases ‘scene time’, time in the Emergency
Department and time to definitive surgical intervention
may still be reduced. Performing the intervention must
still be weighed against the advantages of earlier trans-
port to hospital, and every effort must be made to
keep pre-hospital time to a minimum.
Preparation
Careful preparation of the patient and equipment will
decrease the frequency of complications. The patient
should ideally be positioned to allow 360° access at a
comfortable height for airway intervention (e.g. on an
ambulance trolley), in adequate but not bright light, to
optimise the view at intubation.
A standardised ‘kit dump’ is prepared so that the
drugs and equipment necessary for safe anaesthesia are
immediately available. The pre-hospital team should be
thoroughly familiar with all medical equipment. A ver-
bal challenge–response pre-induction checklist is an
effective method of confirming availability of equip-
ment, doses of drugs to be administered and the failed
intubation management plan.
The pre-hospital team should be fully briefed. Ide-
ally, four people are required: PHEA physician; anaes-
thetic assistant; provider of manual in-line stabilisation;
and provider of cricoid pressure and/or laryngeal
manipulation (sometimes combined with role two).
Genuine entrapment is rare, and most trapped
patients can be rapidly extricated to facilitate airway
management. Simple airway manoeuvres and adjuncts
may be used to avoid airway obstruction before rapid
extrication. If these measures fail, insertion of a supra-
glottic device, tracheal intubation or a primary surgical
airway may be necessary.
Pre-oxygenation
All patients should be pre-oxygenated. A head-elevated
position can improve oxygenation and reduce the risk
of aspiration. A reverse Trendelenburg position can be
used if spinal injury is suspected.
Pre-oxygenation
in
spontaneously
breathing
patients may be achieved using high-flow oxygen
delivered through a facemask with a reservoir bag.
Hypoxaemic patients (SaO2 < 90%) or patients with
poor respiratory effort usually require gentle support
of ventilation with a bag-mask to facilitate pre-oxyge-
nation. The risk of gastric distension and subsequent
aspiration can be reduced if ventilation pressures are
kept at less than 25 cmH2O [24].

Lockey et al. | Safer pre-hospital anaesthesia 2017
 The provision of apnoeic oxygenation with oxygen
via standard nasal cannulae may, where the airway is
patent, may prolong the time to postinduction desatu-
ration. Although this intervention has been demon-
strated to decrease the incidence of desaturation in
PHEA [25], the evidence base for these techniques is
currently limited [26–30].
Induction
Hard collars limit jaw opening and restrict the view at
laryngoscopy. Once manual in-line stabilisation is
established, the front of the collar and head blocks
should be removed before induction of anaesthesia,
and replaced after induction.
The dose of induction drug should be selected
based on the usual considerations, for example, modi-
fied for hypotensive or head-injured patients. Simple
techniques should minimise the risk of error.
Cricoid pressure should be applied during induc-
tion of anaesthesia to reduce the risk of aspiration.
This may make bag-mask ventilation and insertion of
supraglottic devices difficult, and may improve or wor-
sen the view at laryngoscopy [30, 31]. If it is difficult
to view the larynx, there should be a low threshold for
removal of cricoid pressure. However, cricoid pressure
may also be used to facilitate laryngeal manipulation
to improve the view for the operator.
Intubation
Patients with airway compromise in the pre-hospital
environment may be challenging, and difficult intuba-
tion should be anticipated. Every effort should be
made to ensure successful first-pass intubation, and in
critically ill patients, the practitioner with most anaes-
thetic experience should usually be the first to attempt
intubation. Routine use of an intubating bougie is rec-
ommended. Pre-hospital organisations may approve
other ‘difficult airway’ equipment at a local level.
The number of tracheal intubation attempts is lim-
ited to three [30], and, where possible, the conditions
for successful intubation should be improved between
each attempt. If a patient becomes hypoxaemic during
intubation attempts, the lungs should be ventilated via
a facemask or a supraglottic device. Articulating the
nature of a problem to the anaesthetic assistant may
improve team performance and enhance patient safety.
All pre-hospital organisations must have written
and well-rehearsed ‘failed intubation’ plans. These
should include the use of a second-generation supra-
glottic airway rescue device, and clear indications/
instructions for performing surgical cricothyroidotomy.
Standard, easily reproducible techniques are described
in the 2015 Difficult Airway Society guidelines [30]. It
is unclear if there is any role for needle cricothyroido-
tomy. It is associated with high rates of complication
and failure, and always requires conversion to standard
surgical cricothyroidotomy [32, 33].
Correct tracheal tube placement must be con-
firmed by standard clinical assessment and waveform
capnography, and should be repeated each time the
patient is moved. The breathing system (self-inflating
bag or portable ventilator) should be connected using
an in-line heat and moisture exchange filter.
After confirmation of correct placement, the tra-
cheal tube must be secured. A circumferential tie
around the neck may impair venous drainage of the
head and neck, and it is preferable to use self-adhesive
tape for head-injured patients.
Post-intubation care
Wherever possible, practical procedures should be
completed before patient transport, as they are more
difficult to perform safely once transfer is underway.
The patient should be prepared for transfer by ensur-
ing that intravenous cannulae and adequate oxygen
supplies are accessible. Although high-flow oxygen
therapy is routine practiced in trauma care, it is some-
times necessary to use lower flows for stable patients,
titrated against oxygen saturations to conserve supplies
during transfer.
Where
possible,
post-intubation
critical
care
should commence in the pre-hospital phase of care.
Lung-protective ventilation strategies should be used,
but reduction or removal of positive end-expiratory
pressure may be necessary in hypovolaemic patients.
Ventilation is adjusted to achieve normocapnia, equiv-
alent to an end-tidal CO2 of 4.0–4.5 kPa. The correla-
tion between arterial and end-tidal CO2 may be
reduced in patients with significant physiological or
anatomical derangement. Abnormal end-tidal CO2 is
associated with increased mortality [34]. The use of
transport
ventilators

 ventilation) may decrease the risk of hyperventilation,
and free up a member of the pre-hospital team [35].
In most patients, a hypnotic drug (e.g. midazolam
or propofol) will be required to maintain sedation dur-
ing transfer. Accidental anaesthetic awareness is more
likely whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are
used, particularly in emergency patients with high pre-
induction Glasgow coma scores [36]. Small, frequent
doses
of
sedatives
minimise
haemodynamic
side-
effects, and should be titrated against physiological
variables. Infusions may be preferable for longer trans-
fers, but infusion pumps may make transfer more
complex.
Historically, there have been concerns about using
ketamine in patients with head injury because of the
risks of increased intracranial pressure. These concerns
are of little practical significance, and the drug is now
frequently used in PHEA in patients with head injury
[37, 38]. Relative haemodynamic stability makes keta-
mine an attractive induction drug for pre-hospital
trauma care, but the sympathomimetic effects may
have disadvantages where anaesthesia is delivered after
resuscitation from cardiac arrest or in patients with
severe cardiac disease.
Pre-anaesthesia sedation
Background
Sedation remains a cause of significant morbidity and
mortality, despite the recent publication of compre-
hensive guidelines that advocate knowledge, skills and
a competency-assessed framework for all clinicians
using
sedation.
Patients
requiring
PHEA are
fre-
quently critically unwell and susceptible to the com-
plications
of
sedation.
This
guideline
considers
sedation practice only in association with PHEA, but
notes that practitioners undertaking pre-hospital seda-
tion should be trained to the same standards as those
developed for safe in-hospital practice [39], and must
also have the requisite skills to deal with potential
life-threatening complications. Working Party mem-
bers are aware of recent discussions related to seda-
tion to allow insertion of supraglottic devices for
airway management where PHEA skills are not avail-
able. There is no evidence base to support this prac-
tice, and the safety and potential benefits of this
procedure are not established.
Potential benefits
Patients who require PHEA may be confused, agitated
or even combative [40]. Underlying anxiety, pain and
hypoxia can be exacerbated by failure to comply with
simple treatments such as oxygen administration, so
that pre-oxygenation before PHEA may be ineffective.
Judicious use of sedation can facilitate the establish-
ment of monitoring and ensure adequate pre-oxygena-
tion.
Physical restraint may be required to prevent
patients from harming themselves or others. Restraint
may precipitate a rise in blood pressure or intracranial
pressure, threaten undiagnosed spinal injury, disturb
clot formation and promote bleeding [41]. Using a
physical restraint may also impair performance of the
clinical team. In contrast, provision of anxiolysis and
sedation may improve the ability of the operator to
deal with other elements of patient care or scene man-
agement.
Potential disadvantages
In critically unwell patients, the speed of onset and
effect of sedatives may be significantly altered, and a
reduced dose may be required. Excessive sedation may
cause hypoxia, hypercapnia and hypotension through
loss of the airway, depression of ventilation and
vasodilatation.
Principles of sedation before rapid sequence
induction
Employment
of
non-pharmacological
methods
to
reduce anxiety and agitation should be considered.
The patient should not be crowded, and a ‘single face’
point of contact for the patient should be used. A tar-
get level of sedation should be aimed for [39]. The
patient should be quiet, but responsive to verbal or
painful stimuli. High-risk patients should be identified;
those who are frail, elderly, critically ill or have con-
comitant use of other drugs, for example, opioids [42].
Dilution of the sedative helps to provide better control
of the dose administered. For sedation, the intravenous
route should be used in preference to intramuscular or
other routes [39]. Titration of small doses of sedation
are carried out to achieve the desired effect [43] (e.g.
1–2 mg increments of midazolam). In frail, elderly,
haemodynamically
unstable
patients,
even-smaller

 increments can be considered. End-tidal CO2 monitor-
ing must be used for all patients undergoing moderate
or deep sedation [39].
When to consider intramuscular
sedation
Where intravascular access is difficult (e.g. in combat-
ive patients or those with a history of intravenous drug
abuse), it may be necessary to sedate the patient using
the intramuscular route [43]. As titration is not possi-
ble, a drug such as ketamine that will not cause respi-
ratory or cardiovascular collapse should be used. Once
the patient is sedated, peripheral, central or intra-oss-
eous access can be established before proceeding with
anaesthesia. Oral sedation may also be considered in
some circumstances. The intranasal route has also been
used successfully for pre-hospital sedation and analge-
sia, particularly in children.
Transport
Following induction of anaesthesia, the patient should,
in most circumstances, be transported directly to an
appropriate hospital [4]. Secondary transfer can be
detrimental to patient outcome, particularly in time-
critical injuries [44]. Standards of care initiated at
induction of anaesthesia must be continued during
transport, including: continuous monitoring of vital
signs – ECG, blood pressure, pulse oximetry and wave-
form capnography; maintenance of anaesthesia – ade-
quate
sedation,
analgesia
and,
if
necessary,
neuromuscular blockade; and the provision of support-
ing equipment – airway suction, intubation equipment,
intravenous fluids; contemporaneous written or auto-
matically generated records of vital signs and treat-
ment interventions.
The transport process (availability and type of
vehicle, distance and time to definitive care, journey
and terrain) should be carefully considered before
undertaking pre-hospital anaesthesia. The transport
vehicle must be suitable for the safe transfer of the
anaesthetised patient and attending team. A fixed
patient-carrying device should be used, with straps to
keep the patient secure during transit. To ensure the
safety of personnel, all equipment should be secured,
and the transporting team should remain seated and
restrained. Transport vehicles must comply with road
safety or air transport regulations, and be driven/pi-
loted by a trained person experienced in patient trans-
port. Pre-hospital personnel who perform aeromedical
transfer must have undertaken specific training [45].
The receiving hospital must be given sufficient
warning of the patient’s arrival, and the transferring
clinician is responsible for patient handover to the
receiving clinical team. The AAGBI and Intensive Care
Society have published recommendations on the trans-
fer of ill and injured patients [45, 46], most of which
are applicable to the transportation of patients who
have undergone PHEA.

Appendix 1
Safe anaesthesia in challenging
environments
The practice of PHEA in genuinely dangerous or
extreme environments carries additional risks that
must be considered in the planning and delivery of
care. Such environments may include: areas of conflict,
including battlefields or civil disturbances; areas of
extreme climate and/or high altitude; areas with risk
of exposure to chemical, biological, radiological or
nuclear (CBRN) threats; and areas that are remote or
difficult to access. Constraints are usually related to
access, time, threat, resource limitation and the capac-
ity of the emergency medical services system.
General principles
The standards of care described in this guideline are
applicable, even in adverse environments. Where this
is not possible, careful consideration must be given as
to whether the delivery of PHEA is appropriate. If not,
measures to proceed safely without PHEA must be
considered. This includes the planning of remote expe-
ditions, where the medical support, drugs and equip-
ment
required
to
perform
PHEA
safely
is
only
available in exceptional circumstances.
Personal protective equipment
Consideration must be given to the safety of the pre-
hospital team and their patients. Suitable personal pro-
tective equipment is essential for all involved, but
practitioners need to be aware that equipment such as
body armour can make standard techniques difficult.
This is especially the case in the CBRN environment,
where the conduct of conventional anaesthesia is often
impossible. Biological hazards may preclude the use of
high-level interventions, even when they are available.
Threats to practitioners and equipment may outweigh
the potential benefits of PHEA.
Scene safety
The casualty should be moved to the safest available
location before any intervention. In general, the threat
of remaining exposed to assault, extremes of tempera-
ture or other highly adverse conditions is likely to out-
weigh the risk of delaying PHEA.
Threats can develop rapidly in adverse environ-
ments, and practitioners must understand that their
situational awareness will be significantly impaired
when concentrating on PHEA or other complex inter-
ventions. Other team members should monitor and
maintain scene safety.
Competence and training
In addition to the general competency requirements
associated with PHEA, practitioners working in adverse
environments should ideally undertake additional train-
ing specific to the area of their work (e.g. mountain
medicine, tropical medicine or combat casualty care).
Appendix 2
Minimum data collection and key
performance indicators
Minimum data collection
Pre-hospital
emergency
anaesthesia
is
increasingly
practised, and yet remains supported by few data. The
data are heterogeneous, making it difficult to draw
meaningful conclusions. Advanced airway management
in pre-hospital care has been identified by an expert
panel as a research priority [47], and consensus-
derived datasets need to be developed [14, 48]. Ade-
quate data collection is essential to underpin local
audit and clinical governance processes.
The following variables have been suggested as
part of the minimum dataset:

 •
System variables: highest level of emergency medi-
cal service provider on scene; airway equipment
available; anaesthetic drugs available; methods of
transportation; and response times.
•
Patient variables: age; sex; comorbidities; estimated
weight; presenting illness/injury; and indication for
airway intervention.
•
Intervention variables: vital signs pre- and postinduc-
tion of anaesthesia; drugs (and doses) used; number
of intubation attempts; intubation success; manage-
ment of failed intubation; devices used in successful
airway management; and adverse events including
hypoxia,
hypotension,
arrhythmias
(bradycardia),
aspiration, misplaced tracheal tube, oesophageal intu-
bation (recognised/unrecognised), cardiac arrest.
Key performance indicators
Measuring quality in PHEM can be challenging. The
categorisation of key performance indicators (KPI) has
been previously described [49], and might be helpful in
defining KPIs for PHEA. Examples are shown below.
•
Structure/system: routine use of a standard operat-
ing procedure and checklist for PHEA; all team
members familiar with the failed intubation plan;
daily equipment checks performed; and full moni-
toring, including continuous waveform capnogra-
phy available.
•
Process: pre-oxygenation performed for 3 min;
intubation performed by experienced airway provi-
der; no decrease of more than 20% in systolic
blood pressure; no decrease in SaO2 < 90%, or fall
of > 10% from starting value; and no more than
two attempts required for intubation.
•
Outcome: position of tracheal tube maintained and
confirmed using waveform capnography; adequate
anaesthesia maintained during transfer; cardiovas-
cular stability maintained; ventilation titrated to
end-tidal CO2
The exact content of the data set and KPIs may be
adapted to specific systems and their governance
projects.
