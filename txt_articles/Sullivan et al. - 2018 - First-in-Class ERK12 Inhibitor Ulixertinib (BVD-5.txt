ABSTRACT 
 
Ulixertinib (BVD-523) is an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor with potent preclinical activity 
in BRAF- and RAS-mutant cell lines. In this multicenter phase I trial (NCT01781429), 
135 patients were enrolled to an accelerated 3 + 3 dose-escalation cohort and six distinct dose-expan-
sion cohorts. Dose escalation included 27 patients, dosed from 10 to 900 mg twice daily and estab-
lished the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 600 mg twice daily. Ulixertinib exposure was dose 
proportional to the RP2D, which provided near-complete inhibition of ERK activity in whole blood. In the 
108-patient expansion cohort, 32% of patients required dose reduction. The most common treatment-
related adverse events were diarrhea (48%), fatigue (42%), nausea (41%), and dermatitis acneiform 
(31%). Partial responses were seen in 3 of 18 (17%) patients dosed at or above maximum tolerated 
dose and in 11 of 81 (14%) evaluable patients in dose expansion. Responses occurred in patients with 
 
NRAS- 
,  
BRAF V600–, and non–V600  
BRAF 
-mutant solid tumors. 
 
SIGnIFICAnCE: 
 Here, we describe the fi
 rst-in-human dose-escalation study of an ERK1/2 inhibitor for 
the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. Ulixertinib has an acceptable safety profi
 le with 
favorable pharmacokinetics and has shown early evidence of clinical activity in  
NRAS 
- and  
BRAF 
 V600- 
and non-V600–mutant solid-tumor malignancies.

INTRODUCTION 
 
MAPK signaling via the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK cascade plays 
a critical role in oncogenesis. As the terminal master kinase of 
this MAPK pathway, ERK1/2 infl
 uences cellular proliferation, 
differentiation, and survival through a variety of mechanisms 
( 
1 
). Aberrations of MAPK/ERK pathway components are 
ubiquitous across numerous cancer types. Mutations in  
RAS 
 
family genes ( 
KRAS 
 and  
NRAS 
) occur in approximately 30% of 
all human cancers ( 
2 
), with  
KRAS 
 mutations prevalent in pan-
creatic (>90%; ref.  
3 
), biliary tract (3%–50%; ref.  
4 
), colorectal 
(30%–50%; ref.  
5 
), lung (25–30%; ref.  
6 
), ovarian (15%–39%; ref. 
 
7 
), and endometrioid endometrial (18%; ref.  
8 
) cancers, and 
 
NRAS 
 mutations prevalent in melanoma (20%; ref.  
9 
). Muta-
tions in  
RAF 
 family genes, most notably  
BRAF 
 at codon V600, 
are frequent, particularly in malignant melanomas (50%; ref. 
 
10 
), and in approximately 7% of a wide range of other cancers 
( 
11 
). Atypical  
BRAF alterations (non-V600) occur sporadically 
across numerous tumor types. Insight into the mechanism of 
action of such alterations is developing, with the understand-
ing that  
BRAF 
 V600 alterations can act as monomers to drive 
signaling, whereas specifi
 c atypical  
BRAF non-V600 altera-
tions act in a dimer-dependent manner ( 
12 
). Approved BRAF 
inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) are effective in  
BRAF
V600–driven tumors, but have not been shown to be effective 
against  
BRAF non-V600 mutations. Mutations in  
MEK 
 or 
 
ERK 
 are rare, with reports for  
MEK 
 mutations occurring in 
5% to 8% of melanomas ( 
10, 13 
), and  
ERK mutations occur-
ring in cervical cancer (8%; ref.  
14 
) and head and neck squa-
mous cell carcinoma (1.5%; ref.  
15 
). Collectively, activating 
mutations of MAPK/ERK pathway components are frequent 
events in a range of cancer types. Therefore, downstream inhi-
bition of ERK is an attractive therapeutic avenue to pursue. 
 
Precedence for targeting the MAPK/ERK pathway has been 
established for treatment of  
BRAF V600–mutant melanoma 
and lung cancers, where combined BRAF and MEK inhibition 
is now standard of care following FDA approval of dabrafenib 
plus trametinib ( 
16, 17 
) and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib 
( 
18 
). Furthermore, favorable phase III data have been described 
for encorafenib plus binimetinib ( 
19 
). Initially, BRAF inhibitor 
monotherapy was shown to be effective ( 
20 
), yet the addition 
of MEK inhibition not only attenuated BRAF inhibitor–associ-
ated toxicities but also improved overall response rates (ORR), 
progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS; refs. 
 
16–18 
). The combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy 
now has been studied in a number of  
BRAF 
 V600E–mutant

solid-tumor malignancies with varying results, ranging from 
melanoma-like outcomes in lung cancer (17) to only rare 
responses in colorectal cancer (21), and intermediate results 
in thyroid cancer (22). Additionally, although it has been dem-
onstrated that BRAF/MEK inhibitor–targeted combination 
therapy provides significant additional benefit beyond single-
agent options in melanoma and other cancers, the majority of 
patients eventually develop resistance and disease progression 
after approximately 12 months (16, 23, 24). Several mechanisms 
of acquired resistance following either single-agent or combina-
tion therapies have been identified, including, but not limited 
to, the generation of BRAF splicing variants, BRAF amplifica-
tion, NRAS or MEK mutations, and upregulation of bypass 
pathways (25–31). Central to these mechanisms of resistance 
is the reactivation of ERK signaling, which enables the rapid 
recovery of MAPK pathway signaling and escape of tumor cells 
from single-agent BRAF inhibitors or combination BRAF/MEK 
inhibitor therapies (32, 33). Therefore, ERK inhibition may 
provide the opportunity to avoid or overcome resistance from 
upstream mechanisms, as it is the most distal master kinase of 
this signaling pathway. This is supported by preclinical evidence 
that inhibition of ERK by small-molecule inhibitors acted to 
both inhibit the emergence of resistance and overcome acquired 
resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (34–39).
Ulixertinib (BVD-523) is a highly potent, selective, reversible, 
ATP-competitive ERK1/2 inhibitor that has been shown to 
reduce tumor growth and induce tumor regression in BRAF- 
and RAS-mutant xenograft models. Furthermore, single-agent 
ulixertinib was found to inhibit tumor growth in human xeno-
graft models that were cross-resistant to both BRAF and MEK 
inhibitors (38). Therefore, we undertook an open-label, first-in-
human study (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01781429) of 
oral ulixertinib to identify both the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Study 
aims also included assessment of the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties of ulixertinib as well as prelimi-
nary efficacy in patients with genetic aberrations in BRAF, both 
at V600 and non-V600 positions, NRAS, and MEK.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between April 4, 2013, and March 6, 2017, a total of 135 
patients at 12 sites were consented and enrolled into this 
study; 27 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation por-
tion and 108 patients enrolled in the cohort expansion por-
tion (Fig. 1). All patients received at least one dose of study 
drug. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics are 
presented in Table 1. The median patient age across the study 
was 62 years. Fifty-two percent (14/27) and 64% (69/108) of 
patients were male, and 59% (16/27) and 68% (73/108) had 
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 
(ECOG PS) of 1 for the dose-escalation and cohort expansion 
phases of the study, respectively. Patients who had previ-
ously received BRAF and/or MEK therapy represented 41% 
(11/27) of those enrolled in dose escalation and 19% (21/108) 
in cohort expansion, or 24% (32/135) overall. Furthermore, 
51% (69/135) of patients had received prior immunotherapy. 
Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was present in 46% 
(43/93) of patients evaluated in screening.
In cohort expansion, 108 patients were enrolled to six cohorts: 
patients without prior MAPK-targeted therapy who had BRAF-
mutant colorectal (17 enrolled/11 evaluable), lung (16/12), 
or other cancers (24/21), NRAS-mutant melanoma (22/18), 
or any tumor type with a MEK mutation (8/4), and patients 
with melanoma who had received prior BRAF and/or MEK 
inhibitor treatment and who were refractory to, intolerant of, 
or progressed on these treatments (21/15). A variety of specific 
BRAF and NRAS mutations were included, as were a number of 
different tumor types (Supplementary Table S1). Collectively, 
91 patients with tumors harboring mutations in BRAF, 24 with 
NRAS, 9 with MEK, 5 with no mutation identified, and 6 with 
other mutations (5 KRAS and 1 GNAS) were enrolled.
Dose Escalation, Dose-Limiting Toxicities, 
MTD, and RP2D
Per protocol, 5 single-patient cohorts (from 10 through 
150 mg twice daily) proceeded without evidence of a dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT). The 300-mg twice daily cohort was 
expanded to more fully characterize ulixertinib exposures. 
One of 6 patients given 600 mg twice daily experienced a 
DLT of grade 3 rash. The 900-mg twice daily dose exceeded 
the MTD, with 1 patient experiencing grade 3 pruritus, 
grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase, and grade 3 
elevated alanine aminotransferase, and another patient 
experiencing grade 3 diarrhea, grade 3 vomiting, grade 3 
dehydration, and grade 3 elevated creatinine (Supple-
mentary Table S2). The subsequent intermediate dose of 
 
750 mg twice daily also exceeded the MTD, with DLTs of 
Figure 1.  Study schema. An acceler-
ated dose-escalation study design was 
used to investigate doses from 10 to 
900 mg, twice daily (b.i.d.), followed by 
expansion cohorts initially receiving 
the preliminary recommended phase II 
dose (RP2D) of 600 mg, twice daily.

in another patient, which delayed cycle 2 dosing. Therefore, 
the MTD and RP2D were determined to be 600 mg twice daily. 
 
 
Safety and Adverse Events 
 
Investigator-assessed treatment-related adverse events (AE) 
of any grade were noted in 125 of 135 patients (93%) treated, 
whereas 105 of 115 patients (91%) treated at the RP2D had a 
treatment-related AE. Study wide, the most common treat-
ment-related AEs were rash (76%, predominantly acneiform), 
diarrhea (48%), fatigue (42%), and nausea (42%;  
Table 2 
). No 
patients experienced a grade 4 or 5 treatment-related AE. Most 
events were grade 1 to 2, with treatment-related grade 3 events 
noted in 56 of 135 patients (41%). The most common grade 
3 treatment-related events were rash [17% of patients, includ-
ing maculopapular ( 
n 
 = 13), rash ( 
n 
 = 5), dermatitis acneiform 
( 
n 
 = 4), and erythematous ( 
n 
 = 1)], diarrhea (7%), anemia (4%), 
and fatigue (4%). AEs regardless of attribution leading to 
treatment interruptions occurred in 23 of 27 (85%) patients 
in dose escalation and 70 of 108 (65%) patients in cohort 
expansion, with gastrointestinal, and skin and subcutaneous 
disorders accounting for 20% and 15% of all dose interrup-
tions, respectively. Median dose intensity for patients treated 
at RP2D was 89%. AEs leading to discontinuation regardless 
of attribution occurred in 26 of 135 (19%) patients, 3 in dose 
escalation (75, 300, and 900 mg twice daily) and 23 in cohort 
expansion. Twenty-fi
 ve patients experienced a total of 38 
treatment-related serious AEs (SAE); the only events occur-
ring in multiple patients were diarrhea ( 
n 
 = 7), dehydration 
( 
n 
 = 4), acute renal failure, anemia, increased blood creatinine, 
maculo-papular rash, nausea, and vomiting ( 
n 
 = 2 each). 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
 
Pharmacokinetic analyses of ulixertinib following a single 
dose and after achieving steady state in dose escalation are 
summarized in  
Fig. 2A and B 
. Generally, orally administered 
ulixertinib (taken without food) was slowly absorbed, reach-
ing maximum concentration (C 
max 
) at approximately 2 to 
4 hours, and then declining slowly thereafter. Plasma drug 
concentrations were measured as a function of time through 
a single dosing period (12 hours). As such, it was not possible 
to calculate an effective or terminal phase elimination rate. 
Ulixertinib pharmacokinetics were linear and dose propor-
tional in terms of both C 
max (Supplementary Table S3) and 
area under the curve (AUC) when administered up to 600 mg 
twice daily on day 1 and at steady state ( 
Fig. 2C and D 
, respec-
tively). A further increase in exposure was not observed as the 
dose increased from 600 to 900 mg twice daily, although only a 
limited number of patients were treated at the higher dose levels. 
Minimal plasma accumulation of ulixertinib and its metabolites 
was observed at steady state at the lower (<75 mg twice daily) 
dose levels, whereas accumulation ranged from approximately 
1.3- to 4.0-fold for the higher dose levels. The degree of inter-
patient variability in plasma exposure to ulixertinib and its 
metabolites was moderate and considered clinically manage-
able. Urinary excretion of ulixertinib on day 1 and at steady 
state was negligible (<0.2% of the dose) and not dose-related 
within this very low percentage range. Individual renal clear-
ance values ranged from 0.128 to 0.0895 L/hour (where  
n 
 = 1 
patient per dose level) and mean values ranged from 0.0149 to 
0.0300 L/hour (where  
n 
 ≥3 patients). 
 
 
To confi
 rm on-target and pathway inhibition by ulixertinib, 
we examined RSK1 phosphorylation as a target biomarker in 
patients’ whole-blood samples following oral dosing (assay 
provided in Methods). Samples collected from ulixertinib-
treated patients displayed concentration-dependent inhibition 
of PMA-stimulated ERK activity ( 
Fig. 2E 
), ranging from 0% 
ERK inhibition for patients dosed at 10 mg twice daily to 93% 
± 8% ERK inhibition with dosing at 900 mg twice daily, when 
measured at trough. Near-complete (86% ± 12%) inhibition

of ERK activity was observed throughout the entire dosing 
period at RP2D. Ulixertinib exposures in cohort-expansion 
patients dosed at the RP2D were C 
max 
 1.15 and 2.12 μg/mL and 
AUC 
0-12 8.07 and 19.93 μg*h/mL after the fi
 rst dose and at 
steady state, respectively ( 
Fig. 2F 
). 
 
 
Antitumor Effects 
 
Tumor response to ulixertinib was assessed in 25 and 
81 evaluable patients from the dose-escalation and expan-
sion cohorts, respectively, using Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Per protocol, 
evaluable patients were defi
 ned as those who completed two 
cycles of treatment. Although no patient achieved a complete 
response, 14 partial responses were observed in 101 evaluable 
patients who were dosed at 600 mg twice daily or greater (3 in 
dose escalation and 11 in cohort expansion). 
 
 
Dose-Escalation Cohorts 
 
In dose escalation, 3 of 25 (12%) evaluable patients (all with 
melanoma harboring  
BRAF V600 mutations) achieved partial 
responses (PR). These 3 patients, who were BRAF/MEK ther-
apy naïve, intolerant, or refractory, had response durations of 
4.2, 12.4, and 24.9 months, respectively ( 
Fig. 3A and B 
).  
Fig-
ure 3C shows computed tomography (CT) scans of one of the 
responders, who had progressed on prior vemurafenib and 
subsequent dabrafenib treatment and maintained a PR for 
24.9 months. Noteworthy, this patient’s PR was fi
 rst observed 
after 13.5 months of treatment, whereas total time on study 
exceeded 38.4 months (ongoing at data cutoff). 
 
 
Additionally, 6 patients had stable disease for more than 6 
months.  
Figure 3B depicts the time to PR and the duration of 
response in this study population. One patient with bronchi-
oloalveolar non–small cell lung cancer (not enough tissue for 
molecular profi
 ling) was on treatment for >26.2 months with 
stable disease. Twenty-six of 27 patients (96%) discontinued 
treatment due to progressive disease (85%, 23/27) or other 
reasons (11%, 3/27; 1 drug-related and 2 unrelated AEs). The 
mean duration of ulixertinib treatment before discontinua-
tion was 6.6 months. 
 
 
Dose-Expansion Cohorts 
 
In dose expansion, the tumor response and duration on 
study for each cohort are depicted in  
Fig. 4A and B 
, respectively. 
PRs were seen in 11 of 81 (14%) evaluable patients, including 
3 of 18 with  
NRAS 
-mutant melanoma, 3 of 12 with  
BRAF 
-
mutant lung cancer (2 with V600E and 1 with L597Q), 1 of 
15 with BRAF/MEK inhibitor–refractory  
BRAF 
 V600E–mutant 
melanoma, and 4 of 21 with other  
BRAF 
-mutant cancers. These 
include one each of  
BRAF 
 L485W gallbladder cancer ( 
Fig. 5A 
), 
 
BRAF V600E glioblastoma multiforme ( 
Fig. 5B 
),  
BRAF 
 G469A 
head and neck cancer, and  
BRAF 
 G469A small-bowel cancer. 
Of these patients, two of the responses lasted greater than 4.9 
months. The maximal tumor responses for patients with  
BRAF 
 
non-V600 mutations ( 
n 
 = 28) are shown in  
Fig. 4C 
 and are 
classifi
 ed by their kinase activity ( 
12, 40 
). Of note, central nerv-
ous system (CNS) responses were seen in a patient with  
BRAF 
 
V600E–mutant lung cancer with metastases, and another with 
 
BRAF 
 V600E–mutant glioblastoma mulitforme. 
 
 
 
Based on the preclinical data, it was expected that ulixerti-
nib would have activity in patients with melanoma harboring 
mutations in the MAPK pathway (

escalation and expansion), 53 patients with melanoma were

evaluation per RECIST v1.1. In 19 such patients with BRAF-
mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF and/or 
MEK inhibitor, 3 (15%) achieved a PR, 6 had stable disease, 
and 10 had progressive disease as a best response. In the 
patients with a PR, the time from last MAPK-targeted therapy 
was 21, 26, and 169 days, respectively. In patients with stable 
disease, this number ranged from 19 to 713 days; however, 
all but one commenced therapy within 6 weeks of the last 
dose of these targeted therapies. Seventeen patients with 
NRAS-mutated melanoma were evaluable for response. Three 
patients (18%) achieved a PR, 6 had stable disease, and 8 had 
disease progression as best response. Additionally, 3 other 
patients with melanoma harboring BRAF mutations, who 
had not received prior targeted therapy, were treated. One of 
2 patients with a BRAF V600 mutation responded, and the 1 
patient with a BRAF fusion had stable disease.

measurement
oral treatment with ulixertinib resulted in both radiographic 
responses by RECIST v1.1 (3 PRs) and prolonged disease 
stabilization in some patients, many with tumor alterations 
consistent with MAPK activation (BRAF, KRAS, NRAS). Drug 
exposures increased linearly with increasing doses up to 
 
600 mg twice daily, which provided near-complete 24/7 inhi-
bition of ERK substrate (RSK1) phosphorylation in an ex vivo 
whole-blood assay. Furthermore, toxicities associated with 
ulixertinib were consistent with preclinical models and were 
manageable when administered up to its MTD and RP2D, 
determined to be 600 mg twice daily.
Ulixertinib was successfully administered in six cohorts 
of patients with NRAS, BRAF, and MEK mutations at the 
RP2D, which demonstrated unique and encouraging clinical 
activity. Tumor regression and/or stabilization of disease was 
seen in every dose cohort, and partial responses were seen 
in patients with a variety of solid-tumor malignancies with 
mutations in BRAF V600E/K, non-V600 BRAF, and NRAS. 
In particular, non-V600 BRAF mutations, including L485W, 
L597Q, and G469A across a variety of solid tumors, were 
shown to be clinically actionable for the first time, with dura-
ble objective responses. This study provides the first clini-
cal evidence that dimer-dependent atypical BRAF non-V600 
mutations may be actionable by downstream ERK inhibition, 
highlighting an important new therapeutic target for future 
drug development in solid tumors. Furthermore, the CNS 
activity of ulixertinib was clinically demonstrated by the 
objective responses achieved in glioblastoma multiforme and 
lung cancer with brain metastases.
Ulixertinib was generally well tolerated, with manageable 
and reversible toxicity. The most common AEs were rash 
(most commonly acneiform), fatigue, and gastrointestinal 
AEs, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The safety 
profile of ulixertinib is consistent with its selective inhibition 
of the MAPK pathway; the AE profile overlaps considerably 
with MEK inhibitor experience (41). However, toxicities asso-
ciated with any targeted therapy may include dependence on 
both the specific mechanism and the degree of target inhibi-
tion, as well as any off-target effects.
Durable responses by RAF and MEK inhibitors are often 
limited by intrinsic and eventual acquired resistance, with 
a common feature often involving reactivation of the ERK 
pathway (25–31, 38). Thus, ERK inhibition with ulixertinib 
alone or in combination with other MAPK signaling path-
way inhibitors may have the potential to delay the develop-
ment of resistance to existing therapies and to benefit a 
broader patient population (42). The ability of ERK inhibi-
tors, including ulixertinib, to retain their potency in BRAF- 
and MEK-resistant cell lines provides preclinical evidence for 
their use in patients with acquired resistance to standard of 
care (BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy; refs. 34, 35, 
39). Importantly, in this study, 9 of 19 patients with BRAF-
mutant melanoma previously treated with MAPK inhibitor 
therapy had either a PR or stable disease, including a patient 
with a PR while receiving ulixertinib whose cancer had pro-
gressed after experiencing stable disease when treated initially 
with a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) and subsequently with 
dabrafenib. This patient remained on study for a total of 
38.4 months as of the cutoff date of this publication. Based 
in part on the antitumor effects observed in this patient, the 
FDA has designated as a Fast Track development program 
the investigation of ulixertinib for the treatment of patients 
with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation–positive 
melanoma that is refractory to or has progressed following 
treatment with a BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor(s). One poten-
tial explanation for this activity in patients with BRAF-mutant 
melanoma previously treated with MAPK pathway–targeted 
therapy is repopulation of the tumor following a break 
in treatment (43). However, in 2 of the 3 PRs and 5 of the 
 
6 patients with stable disease, ulixertinib commenced within 
6 weeks of the last BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor dose, with the 
majority treated within 4 weeks.

 Phase I Trial of Ulixertinib, an Oral ERK 1/2 Inhibitor
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
february  2018 CANCER DISCOVERY | 193 
In summary, we report initial data from the phase I study 
evaluating ulixertinib, a first-in-class ERK inhibitor, as a treat-
ment for patients with advanced cancers. Continuous, twice-
daily oral treatment with ulixertinib resulted in antitumor 
effects in subsets of patients with a variety of solid-tumor 
types, including patients either naïve to or having progressed 
on available MAPK pathway–targeted therapies. Ulixertinib 
generally was well tolerated in this population of patients with 
advanced cancer, and toxicities were manageable; the MTD and 
RP2D were 600 mg twice daily. Ulixertinib exposures increased 
linearly up to the RP2D, and robust pharmacodynamic effects 
were evident at this dose level. The preliminary efficacy shown 
in a variety of molecularly defined cohorts, hallmarked by 
MAPK activating alterations, supports the ongoing develop-
ment of ulixertinib as a single agent as well as in combination.
METHODS
Patients
Between April 4, 2013, and March 6, 2017, a total of 135 patients at 
12 sites were consented and enrolled into the study, after local Insti-
tutional Review Board approval. All participants provided informed 
consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. Patients ages 
≥18 years were eligible for participation if they had noncurable, 
histologically confirmed metastatic or advanced-stage malignant 
tumors; an ECOG PS of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, bone mar-
row, and cardiac function; and a life expectancy ≥3 months. Patients 
may have received up to two prior lines of chemotherapy for their 
metastatic disease. Exclusion criteria were known uncontrolled brain 
metastases; gastrointestinal conditions that could impair absorption 
of study medication; history or current evidence/risk of retinal vein 
occlusion or central serous retinopathy; and concurrent therapy 
with drugs known to be strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and 
CYP3A4, or strong inducers of CYP3A4.
Patients who received at least one dose of ulixertinib were included 
in the analysis. We used SAS (version 9.3) to support this study. 
The data cutoff was March 6, 2017. This study is registered with 
 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01781429).
Study Design and Objectives
This was an open-label, phase I study to assess the safety, pharma-
cokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of escalating doses of ulixertinib 
in a capsule formulation in patients with advanced malignancies. 
The dosing regimen combined both accelerated titration and stand-
ard cohort 3 + 3 dose-escalation schema, which were used jointly to 
identify the MTD and RP2D of ulixertinib in patients with advanced 
solid tumors. One to 6 patients per treatment cohort were assigned 
to receive sequentially higher oral doses of ulixertinib administered 
twice daily (12-hour intervals) continuously in 21-day cycles at the 
following doses: 10 mg (n = 1); 20 mg (n = 1); 40 mg (n = 1); 75 mg (n = 
1); 150 mg (n = 1); 300 mg (n = 4); 600 mg (n = 7); 900 mg (n = 7); and 
 
750 mg (n = 4). In the cohort-expansion phase, patients were enrolled 
to one of six cohorts until at least 15 patients per cohort were 
expected to be evaluable for response to therapy. The six cohorts were 
defined as patients without prior MAPK targeted therapy that had 
BRAF-mutant colorectal (17 enrolled/11 evaluable), lung (16/12), 
or other cancers (24/21), NRAS-mutant melanoma (22/18), or any 
tumor type with a MEK mutation (8/4), and patients with mela-
noma who had prior BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor treatment (21/15). 
Notably, the cohort of patients with MEK mutations was closed after 
enrollment of only 8 patients, due to slow accrual.
Patients received ulixertinib until disease progression, unaccepta-
ble toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another withdrawal 
criterion. Dose escalations occurred in up to 100% increments in 
single-patient cohorts until 1 patient experienced at least a grade 2 
toxicity (excluding alopecia or diarrhea). Cohorts were then expanded 
to at least 3 patients each, and subsequent dose-escalation incre-
ments were reduced from up to 100% to a maximum of 50%. When 
at least 1 patient in a 3-patient cohort experienced a DLT, up to 3 
additional patients were treated at this dose level. When more than 1 
DLT occurred in ≤6 patients, this dose level was defined as the non-
tolerated dose, and dose escalation was stopped. Intrapatient dose 
escalation was allowed, provided the patients receiving the highest 
current dose had been observed for at least 3 weeks and dose-limiting 
AEs were reported in fewer than 2 of 6 patients assigned to that 
dose. Patients experiencing DLTs or unacceptable toxicity had their 
treatment interrupted until the toxicity returned to grade 1 or lower. 
Resumption of ulixertinib treatment was then initiated at the next 
lower dose level tested or at a 20% to 30% dose decrease, aligning with 
capsule strength.
The primary objective of the study was to define the safety and 
tolerability of ulixertinib by determining the DLTs, the MTD, and 
the RP2D. The secondary objectives included the determination of 
the pharmacokinetic profile of ulixertinib and the investigation of 
any preliminary clinical effects on tumor response, as assessed by 
physical or radiologic examination using RECIST v1.1. The explora-
tory objectives included evaluation of pharmacodynamic marker 
(biomarker) measures.
MTD, DLT, and RP2D
MTD was defined as the highest dose cohort at which ≤33% of 
patients experienced ulixertinib-related DLTs in the first 21 days 
of treatment. DLT was defined as a ulixertinib-related toxicity in 
the first 21 days of treatment that resulted in a grade 4 or higher 
hematologic toxicity for >1 day; grade 3 hematologic toxicity with 
complications (e.g., thrombocytopenia with bleeding); grade 3 or 
higher nonhematologic toxicity, except untreated nausea, vomiting, 
constipation, pain, and rash (these become DLTs if the AE persisted 
despite adequate treatment); or a treatment interruption exceeding 
 
3 days in cycle 1 (or the inability to be in cycle 2 for >7 days) due to 
ulixertinib-related toxicity.
The RP2D could be as high as the MTD and was determined in dis-
cussion with the clinical investigators, medical monitor, and sponsor. 
Observations related to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and 
any cumulative toxicity observed after multiple cycles were included 
in the rationale supporting the RP2D.
Safety Assessments
Patients who received ulixertinib and experienced any untoward 
medical occurrence had their AE defined as per the MedDRA coding 
dictionary, regardless of causal relationship with test article. The 
AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Grading Scale, version 
4.03. Investigators assessed the relationship of AEs to study drug as 
either unrelated, possibly related, or related, and followed up until 
event resolution or stabilization or the AE was judged to no longer 
be clinically significant. An SAE was defined as any untoward medi-
cal occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required 
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
or resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a con-
genital anomaly/birth defect.
Safety evaluations were conducted at baseline, on days 8, 15, 22, 
29, 36, and 43, and, in patients who continued treatment, every 3 
weeks or if clinically indicated thereafter. Each evaluation included 
a physical examination and clinical laboratory studies. Electrocar-
diograms were repeated if clinically significant and at the discretion 
of the investigator. Holter monitoring (12 ± 2 hours) was performed 
in a subset of patients in cycle 1, at day 1 and day 15 (PK sampling

days) and Holter ECG analyses were conducted by BioClinica. An 
ophthalmologic assessment was also conducted at screening, at the 
end of study, and at other visits by an ophthalmologist if clinically 
indicated.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The pharmacokinetic population consisted of patients who received 
at least 1 dose of ulixertinib and had evaluable pharmacokinetic data 
for plasma and/or urine. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing, 
and then at 0.5 (± 5 minutes), 1 (± 5 minutes), 2 (± 10 minutes), 4 (± 10 
minutes), 6 (± 10 minutes), 8 (± 10 minutes), and 12 (±2 hours) hours 
on day 1 (visit 2; baseline/initiation of treatment) and day 15 (visit 4; 
at steady state). On day 22, prior to dose administration, a final blood 
sample was collected for pharmacokinetic analyses. Urine samples 
were collected pre-dose and at the 1- to 6-hour and 6- to 12- (± 2) hour 
intervals post-dose on days 1 and 15. Plasma and urine samples were 
analyzed for ulixertinib and metabolites using validated LC/MS-MS 
methods. Standard pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained using 
Phoenix WinNonlin (Pharsight) with a noncompartmental method. 
Relationship between dose and exposure was calculated using stand-
ard least-squares regression analysis.
Pharmacodynamic Confirmation of  
Target Inhibition by Ulixertinib
ERK inhibition by ulixertinib was determined by measuring 
pRSK/RSK as a target biomarker in human whole-blood samples 
obtained from patients who had received ulixertinib during the 
phase I study. To establish a ulixertinib-dependent RSK1-phospho-
rylation calibration curve, healthy donor blood was treated with 
serial dilutions of ulixertinib (DMSO control) for 2 to 3 hours fol-
lowed by stimulation with 100 nmol/L PMA for 20 minutes at room 
temperature. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, 
lysed, and flash-frozen prior to measurement of pRSK and total 
RSK by ELISA (PathScan).
A plot of the pRSK/RSK ratio as a function of ulixertinib con-
centration was used as a standard curve for determination of ERK 
activity. Maximum (100%) inhibition was defined as the pRSK/RSK 
value obtained in the presence of 10 μmol/L ulixertinib: Baseline 
inhibition was defined as the pRSK/RSK value obtained in untreated 
and unstimulated blood. The EC50 for ulixertinib was determined to 
be ∼200 ng/mL.
Patient samples were evaluated using this methodology, with each 
patient serving as their own control for maximal and minimal stimu-
lation. Pre- and post-ulixertinib treatment samples were collected at 
day 1 and steady state.
Antitumor Response
Tumor measurements based on physical examination occurred at 
baseline and on the first day of each treatment cycle. CT and other 
assessments were made every 2 to 3 cycles. Findings were assessed 
in accordance with RECIST v1.1: Complete response was defined as 
disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as a ≥30% decrease 
in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking baseline 
measurements as reference; stable disease was defined as being of 
neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the baseline 
measurement. CT scans were performed per routine site protocols 
and assessed by site radiologists; no central read assessments were 
included in this analysis.
