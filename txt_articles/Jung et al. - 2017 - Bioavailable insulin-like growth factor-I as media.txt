Abstract
Objectives—Bioavailable insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I interacts with obesity and 
exogenous estrogen in a racial disparity in obesity-related cancer risk, yet their interconnected 
pathways are not fully characterized. We investigated whether circulating bioavailable IGF-I acted 
as a mediator of the racial disparity in obesity-related cancers such as breast and colorectal (CR) 
cancers and how obesity and estrogen use regulate this relationship.

 Methods—A total of 2,425 white and 164 African American (AA) postmenopausal women from 
the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study were followed from October 1, 1993, through 
August 29, 2014. To assess bioactive IGF-I as a mediator of race–cancer relationship, we used the 
Baron-Kenny method and quantitative estimation of the mediation effect.
Results—Compared with white women, AA women had higher IGF-I levels; their higher risk of 
CR cancer, after accounting for IGF-I, was no longer significant. IGF-I was associated with breast 
and CR cancers even after controlling for race. Among viscerally obese (waist/hip ratio >0.85) and 
overall non-obese women (body mass index <30), IGF-I was a strong mediator, reducing the racial 
disparity in both cancers by 30% and 60%, respectively. In estrogen-only users and nonusers, IGF-
I explained the racial disparity in CR cancer only modestly.
Conclusions—Bioavailable IGF-I is potentially important in racial disparities in obesity-related 
breast and CR cancer risk between postmenopausal AA and white women. Body fat distribution 
and estrogen use may be part of the interconnected hormonal pathways related to racial difference 
in IGF-I levels and obesity-related cancer risk.

Introduction
A racial disparity between African American (AA) and white postmenopausal women in the 
risk of obesity-relevant cancer types is well documented for both reproductive cancers, such 
as breast cancer, and non-reproductive cancers, including colorectal (CR) cancer.(1,2) For 
example, during 2008–2012, overall breast cancer incidence rates increased among AA but 
were stable among whites. In addition, among younger women (< 50 years), the incidence 
increased slightly in whites (0.4% per year) and was stable in AA women, whereas among 
older women (i.e., postmenopausal age), an increasing trend was observed only in AA 
women.(3) CR cancer incidence is also disparate; during 2006-2010, its incidence in AA 
was about 25% higher than it was in white women.(4)
Previous epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested that free bioavailable insulin-like 
growth factor-I (IGF-I) is an important mediator of obesity-associated tumorigenesis (i.e., it 
is a cancer-relevant biomarker) and that greater bioavailable IGF-I is associated with greater 
risk of obesity-related cancers, including breast and CR cancers.(5-11) Previous studies also 
showed that these circulating IGF-I levels are higher in AA than in white postmenopausal 
women (10,12); thus, this variation is plausibly related to the racial disparity in those 
cancers. However, studies evaluating the role of IGF-I in the racial disparity in risk of those 
cancers have not shown enough evidence to confirm this relationship. The findings are 
inconsistent, mainly because of small samples sizes, different measures of IGF-I 
concentration (e.g., total versus bioavailable IGF-I), and lack of consideration of interactions 
with effect modifiers such as obesity and sex hormones.
As a crucial modifiable factor, obesity has been postulated to be a driver of IGF-I 
production, given its association with the growth hormone (GH)–IGF axis.(13) However, the

 obesity–IGF-I association is not simple, and it differs by race: it is nonlinear, rather closer to 
an L shape, and in AA women, obesity is inversely related to the level of bioavailable IGF-I.
(9,10,12) The association between obesity and IGF-I may also differ by body fat 
distribution, such as overall obesity (measured by body mass index [BMI]) or abdominal 
adiposity (measured by waist circumference and waist/hip ratio [W/H]).(8,14,15)
Additionally, in postmenopausal women, IGF and endogenous estrogen (E)receptors interact 
in a synergistic cross-talk mechanism, inducing both receptors' signaling pathways and 
resulting in the enhanced anabolic state necessary for tumor growth and development.
(16-19) Likewise, exogenous E in this population has been postulated to interact with 
circulating IGF-I proteins to affect cancer risk. However, unopposed E (i.e., E only) has a 
different effect than opposed E (i.e., E + progestin [P]) has on IGF-I production. Because of 
first-pass effect induced by oral E resulting in suppressing hepatic production of IGF-I, E-
only users have lower IGF-I levels and lower risk of breast and CR cancers than nonusers 
have.(20-22) Due to non–progesterone-like effects, contrasting with the hepatocellular 
effects of oral E on IGF-I production, E+P users, (compared with E-only users) have 
different IGF-I levels and cancer risk (22-25), although the precise mechanisms are 
unknown. There are few studies evaluating the role of exogenous E in the racial disparity in 
IGF-I levels and obesity-related cancer risk. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no study to date 
has combined obesity and exogenous E as effect modifiers to evaluate the role of IGF-I in 
the racial disparity in risk of obesity-related cancers (breast and CR).
In this retrospective analysis, using secondary data from postmenopausal women in the 
Women's Health Initiative Observation Study (WHI-OS), we therefore evaluated statistically 
the role of free bioavailable IGF-I as a mediator in the racial disparity in the risk of obesity-
related breast and CR cancers and determined how modifiable factors, such as obesity and 
the use of exogenous E, regulate this relationship. We hypothesized that AA women, 
compared with white women, have a greater risk of such cancers and that their higher IGF-I 
levels mediate this racial disparity. In AA women, obesity and the use of exogenous E may 
act as strong predictors of bioavailable IGF-I and obesity-related breast and CR cancers.
Most studies evaluating cancer disparity in relation to IGF-I in different racial groups 
conducted subset analyses of one racial group or the other. This approach reduces the 
statistical power with which to evaluate the main association, especially after accounting for 
multiple other covariates in the models, owing to the decreased sample size resulting from 
dividing the sample by race. To address this methodologic challenge, in this study, we 
examined the mediation effect of IGF-I in relationship with the racial cancer disparity by 
using two complementary statistical methods: a Baron-Kenny approach (26) and quantitative 
estimation of a mediation effect.(26-28) Our findings may thus contribute to better 
understanding of the role of IGF-I as a mediator of the racial disparity in risk of obesity-
related cancers and emphasize the role of obesity and exogenous E in reducing this racial 
disparity among postmenopausal women.

 Methods
Study population
The study included 2,589 postmenopausal women enrolled in the WHI-OS, a longitudinal 
cohort of postmenopausal women, 50–79 years old, who had been recruited at 40 clinical 
centers across the United States between October 1, 1993, and December 31, 1998. Details 
on the WHI's rationale and design have been described elsewhere.(29) For the purposes of 
our study, of the 93,676 women enrolled in the WHI-OS, we included only European-
American and AA women (n = 85,651) (Figure S1). Among these, 3,585 women who had 
free bioavailable IGF-I concentrations (obtained after at least 8 hours' fasting) available at 
baseline (i.e., screening or first annual visit) were included. After excluding women (n = 
659) who had been followed up for less than 1 year or those diagnosed with any cancer at 
enrollment, we had 2,926 participants. We excluded another 337 women for whom 
information regarding covariates was not available, leaving a final total of 2,589 women 
(89% of the 2,926). The participants had been followed up through August 29, 2014 (758 
[29% of white and 32% of AA women] breast cancer patients, and 365 [14% of white and 
23% of AA women] CR cancer patients). This study was approved by the institutional 
review boards at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Data collection and outcome variables
Standardized written protocols were used to ensure uniform data collection. At baseline, 
participants completed self-administered questionnaires on demographic (age, race, 
education, marital status, and family history of cancer) and lifestyle factors (physical 
activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, and diet) and their medical (cardiovascular disease 
[CVD], diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia) and reproductive (oral 
contraceptive and exogenous E use, history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, and ages at 
menarche and menopause) histories. Anthropometric measurements, including height, 
weight, and waist and hip circumferences were measured at baseline by trained staff. Of 32 
variables initially selected from a literature review for their associations with race, IGF-I, 
and obesity-related cancers including breast and CR cancers, after multicollinearity testing 
and univariate and stepwise regression analyses, we finally selected 24 variables for this 
study.
Cancer outcomes were formally determined through a centralized review of medical charts 
and cancer cases were coded according to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End-Results guidelines.(30) The outcome variables were the specific 
cancer type (obesity-relevant, breast, and CR) and the time to develop such cancer. Obesity-
relevant cancers included any of nine cancer types (reproductive cancers: breast, 
endometrial, and ovarian; and non-reproductive cancers: CR, kidney, esophageal, gastric, 
pancreatic, and hepatic).(1,2) The time in days from enrollment to cancer development, 
censoring, death, or study end point were recorded and converted into years.

 (BP)-3 and both total and free bioavailable IGF-I concentrations were determined using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX), 
with coefficients of variation of 2.2% for IGFBP-3, 3.5% for total IGF-I, and 16.4% for free 
IGF-I. The correlation coefficients of values were high (IGFBP-3, R2 = 0.98; total IGF-I, R2 
= 0.98; free IGF-I, R2 = 0.91). For our analysis, we used the level of free bioavailable IGF-I 
and replaced missing data with the molar ratios of total IGF-I/IGFBP-3.(31)
Statistical analysis
Differences in baseline characteristics between the white and AA women were assessed 
using unpaired two-sample t test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical 
variables. If continuous variables were skewed or had outliers, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was 
implemented. Multicollinearity was evaluated by using the coefficient of multiple 
determination, tolerance, and variance-inflation factors for each covariate, using the 
remaining covariates as its predictors; no significant multicollinearity was identified.
Multiple linear regression with the regression assumptions to be met was conducted to 
produce the effect sizes of race (AA versus white women) and potential effect modifiers 
(obesity and exogenous E use) for bioavailable IGF-I. Cox proportional hazards regression 
model was performed to yield hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
race, IGF-I, and effect modifiers on obesity-relevant, breast, and CR cancers. The 
proportional hazard assumption was tested via a Schoenfeld residual plot and rho.
To assess bioavailable IGF-I as a mediator of the race–cancer risk relationship, we applied 
two approaches: 1) Baron-Kenny approach (26,32) and 2) computation of the mediation 
effect (i.e, indirect effect) directly from a delta method using Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) (28), along with the percentage change in the HRs.(26,27) According to the Baron-
Kenny approach, the formal analysis to detect a mediation effect, follows from the definition 
of a mediator: Variable M is considered a mediator if 1) X (the independent variable, i.e., 
race in this study) significantly predicts Y (the outcome of interest, i.e., cancer risk in this 
study), 2) X significantly predicts M (potential mediator, i.e., IGF-I in this study), and 3) M 
significantly predicts Y, controlling for X.(26,32-34) These criteria are assessed by 
estimating the following system of equations:
(1)
(2)
(3)
where ί is an intercept coefficient.(32,34)

 In our study, the first step (path c) of the Baron-Kenny approach was to test the hypothesis 
that AA women have higher risk of cancers than white women; the second step (path a) was 
to evaluate the association between AA (compared with whites) women and IGF-I. The third 
and final step (path b) was to assess whether IGF-I levels were significantly associated with 
cancer risk after accounting for race.
However, those steps can be affected by type II errors and cannot estimate the amount or test 
the significance of the mediation effect.(26) Thus, to estimate and test for the significance of 
the pathway of racial disparity in cancer risk through IGF-I (28), we performed a delta 
method, which is very conservative when it falsely presumes a symmetric distribution, via 
SEM using Mplus software. Additionally, we calculated the proportional change in the HRs 
for the race–cancer risk relationship by comparing a model that includes all covariates with a 
model that includes all covariates and IGF-I.(26,27) A two-tailed P value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. R (v 2.15.1) was used.
Results
Baseline characteristics of participants between white and AA women are presented in Table 
1. Compared with white women, AA women were younger, less educated, less likely to be 
married and to have a family history of cancer, and they were more likely to have comorbid 
conditions (CVD, diabetes, and hypertension ever), a history of hysterectomy or 
oophorectomy, and later menopausal transition. AA women were less likely to use 
exogenous estrogen and to meet the physical activity and dietary guidelines, and they were 
more likely to be obese (overall [BMI] and viscerally [waist circumference and W/H]) and 
to have higher bioavailable IGF-I levels.
Breast cancer: mediation effect of bioavailable IGF-I in racial disparity, stratified by obesity 
status (BMI; waist; W/H) and exogenous E usage (nonusers; E only; E+P)
We first examined the overall mediation effect of IGF-I on the racial disparity of breast 
cancer risk between AA and white women using the three-step Baron and Kenny approach. 
The racial disparity in breast cancer risk (step 1 = path c) was not significant (HR = 1.25, 
95%CI, 0.92–1.68), and AA women had higher IGF-I levels than white women (step 2 = 
path a; effect size = 0.12, 95%CI, 0.07–0.17); women who had higher IGF-I levels were 
50% more likely to have breast cancer (step 3 = path b; HR = 1.49, 95%CI, 1.20–1.85). 
Comparing the step-1 model, the introduction of IGF-I into the model (i.e., step-3 model) 
reduced the racial disparity by 29% (HRwithout IGF-I = 1.25 vs. HRwith IGF-I = 1.18; P <0.05 
using the bootstrapping method), indicating that IGF-I mediates the racial disparity in breast 
cancer risk to a modest degree (Figure S2).
We next explored obesity status with different types of adiposity measures (i.e., BMI, waist, 
and W/H) for its contribution as an effect modifier on the racial disparity in breast cancer 
risk, which could have been mediated by IGF-I (Table 2). Even though the racial disparity in 
breast cancer was not significant (paths c and c′), AA women tended to have higher breast 
cancer risk across obesity status. Notably, the racial difference in IGF-I levels (path a) in the 
overall non-obese group (BMI <30) was greater than it was in the overall obese group (BMI 
≥30). This pattern was reversed when stratified by W/H: in the non-obese group (W/H

 ≤0.85), the racial difference in IGF-I levels was smaller than it was in the obese group (W/H 
>0.85). We also evaluated the association between obesity status and IGF-I, stratified by race 
(Table S1), and found that IGF-I levels in white women increased as BMI and W/H 
increased. However, in AA women, IGF-I levels decreased as BMI increased, but increased 
as W/H increased. This may explain the smaller racial difference in IGF-I levels in the 
overall obese group (BMI ≥30) than in the overall non-obese group (BMI <30) and the 
larger racial difference in IGF-I levels in the viscerally obese group (W/H >0.85) compared 
with those in the viscerally non-obese group (W/H ≤0.85).
Additionally, higher IGF-I levels were associated with breast cancer risk (path b). In path c′, 
introduction of IGF-I in the model evaluating the association between race and breast cancer 
(indirect, mediation effect = a*b) produced a greater reduction of racial disparity (i.e., 
reduction of the HR of IGF-I level on breast cancer) in the overall non-obese group (a*b = 
0.07; Proportion explained = 59%) than it did in the overall obese groups (a*b = 0.03; 
Proportion explained = 6%), but in the W/H-stratified groups, the effect of IGF-I on racial 
disparity were not apparently different.
We then explored IGF-I's role in the race–breast cancer relationship by exogenous E usage 
(nonusers; E only; E+P) (Table 3). The racial disparity in IGF-I levels was smallest in the 
nonusers and largest in the E+P users because the AA women who used E+P had higher 
IGF-I levels than the nonusers had, whereas the white women who used E+P had lower IGF-
I levels than the nonusers had (Table S1). This also contributed to a lesser mediation effect 
(a*b = 0.05; 17%) of IGF-I on racial disparity in breast cancer risk in nonusers than in E+P 
users. Next, in path c, among nonusers, AA women were more likely than white women to 
have higher breast cancer risk, whereas among E+P users, AA women were less likely to 
have breast cancer risk, although those differences were not significant. Among the E+P 
users, although the higher IGF-I levels in AA women reduced the breast cancer risk disparity 
(HRwithout IGF-I = 0.83 vs. ORwith IGF-I = 0.76), this cannot explain the higher breast cancer 
risk in white women. This opposite pattern of racial risk (higher breast cancer risk in white 
than in AA women) in E+P users may be due to a confounding effect of E+P, suggesting that 
AA women are less likely than white women to use E+P (Table S2) and that E+P users are 
more likely than nonusers to develop breast cancer (Table S3).
CR cancer: mediation effect of bioavailable IGF-I on racial disparity, stratified by obesity 
status (BMI; waist; W/H) and exogenous E usage (nonusers; E only; E+P)
In contrast to our findings relative to breast cancer, the racial disparity in CR cancer risk was 
significant (HR = 1.47, 95% CI, 1.02–2.12). AA women had higher IGF-I levels (effect size 
= 0.12, 95% CI, 0.07–0.17), but after adjusting for IGF-I, the disparity in CR cancer risk was 
no longer significant (HR = 1.30, 95% CI, 0.90–1.88), with the risk reduced by 37% (P = 
0.002, using the bootstrapping method).
When we assessed the role of IGF-I in the racial disparity in CR cancer risk, stratified by 
obesity status with different types of adiposity measures, we observed results similar to 
those we found for breast cancer risk (Table 4): introduction of IGF-I into the association 
between race and CR cancer produced a greater reduction in racial disparity (i.e., reduction 
of the HR of IGF-I level on CR cancer) in the overall non-obese group (a*b = 0.15; 61%) 
Jung et al.

 than it did in the overall obese groups (a*b = 0.04; 20%). However, in the W/H-stratified 
groups, the effect of IGF-I on racial disparity in risk of CR cancer among obese group (W/H 
>0.85) was greater than it was among non-obese group (W/H ≤0.85).
When compared with our results in breast cancer, we found that the role of IGF-I in the 
racial disparity in CR cancer differed among exogenous E users (Table 5): a greater 
mediating effect of IGF-I on the racial disparity in CR cancer was found in nonusers or E-
only users (a*b, 0.10 in nonusers; 0.11 in E-only users) than in E+P users (a*b = 0.02). In 
path c, racial disparity in CR cancer risk was observed in nonusers; thus, IGF-I may act as a 
mediator of that racial disparity in those women. Additionally, given that among E+P users, 
AA women had higher IGF-I levels and CR cancer risk than white women had (even if the 
results were not significant), the racial disparity in CR cancer risk was not affected by E+P's 
confounding effect on the associations among race, E+P usage, and CR cancer risk (Table 
S4).
Finally, we analyzed the racial disparity in the risk of any of nine types of obesity-related 
cancer that could be mediated by IGF-I; the results were similar to those we found for CR 
cancer (Tables 6 and S5). In addition, for each cancer, when obesity status was stratified by 
usage of exogenous E, the results were not significantly different.
Discussion
In this retrospective study of a large cohort of postmenopausal women, we found that 
compared with white women, AA women had higher bioavailable IGF-I levels and their 
higher risk of CR cancer, after accounting for IGF-I, was no longer significant. IGF-I levels 
were associated with breast and CR cancers even after controlling for race. Further, when 
stratified by obesity status, bioavailable IGF-I among viscerally obese and overall non-obese 
groups was a statistically strong mediator, reducing the racial disparity in obesity-relevant 
breast cancer risk by 30% and CR cancer risk by 60%. In addition, when stratified by 
exogenous E use status, among E+P users, the higher IGF-I levels in AA women mediated 
the racial disparity in breast cancer risk, whereas among nonusers and E-only users, the 
racial differences in IGF-I accounted for the racial disparity in CR cancer risk. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to combine obesity and exogenous E usage as effect 
modifiers to evaluate the role of IGF-I in mediating the racial disparity in the risk of obesity-
relevant cancers, including breast and CR cancers. We used two complementary statistical 
methods together to assess the effect of IGF-I as a mediator; this approach enabled us not 
only to use our entire study population in the analysis but also to estimate directly the 
mediation effect of IGF-I.
Obesity, specifically visceral obesity, is a central driver of bioavailable IGF-I through the 
GH–IGF pathway and systemic effects such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.
(8,11,14,15,35) However, the obesity–IGF-I relationship is not linear. For example, a 
decreased IGF-I level was observed in obesity, possibly due to the negative feedback loop of 
lower GH.(12) In addition, this relationship differs by race (12), probably depending on 
body-fat distribution. Consistent with previous studies (9,12,36), our study showed that 
obese white women had increased IGF-I levels regardless of fat-distribution pattern but that

 AA women had increased IGF-I levels in only visceral obesity, as measured via W/H; these 
results suggest an important role of visceral adiposity, with its local (i.e., paracrine 
secretions of pro-inflammatory factors) and systemic effect (14) on racial differences in 
IGF-I levels. Further, in this study, the higher IGF-I levels in abdominally obese AA women 
than their white counter parts strongly act as a mediator of the racial disparity in obesity-
related breast and CR cancer risk. This concurred with our hypothesis, indicating that the 
association between IGF-I and racial cancer disparity interacts with obesity status with 
different types of adiposity measures.
In addition, the interplay between IGF-I and estrogen acts synergistically in postmenopausal 
women, up-regulating both receptors' downstream cellular cascades, thereby resulting in the 
enhanced anabolic state necessary for tumor growth and development.(16-19) Similarly, 
exogenous estrogen interacts with IGF-I to affect cancer risk, and the extent of this influence 
may depend on the type of estrogen usage. E-only users than nonusers, have lower IGF-I 
levels, owing to the first-pass metabolic effect of suppressed hepatic IGF-I production. Users 
of E+P, however, have different levels of IGF-I and cancer risk due to non–progesterone-like 
effects (i.e., different effect from natural progesterone) contrasting with the hepatocellular 
effect of oral estrogen (20-25), but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, decreased IGF-I 
levels in E-only users were observed in both AA and white women, but in E+P users, a 
different pattern was shown; among AA women, users had higher IGF-I levels than nonusers 
had, while among white women, users had lower levels than nonusers had. This difference 
explains the highest racial difference in IGF-I levels in E+P users in relation to obesity-
related breast and CR cancer risk, and the higher IGF-I levels in AA than in white women in 
this group explain the significant racial disparity in breast cancer risk. Interestingly, we 
found that the white women in the E+P group—despite their lower IGF-I levels—had a 
higher risk of breast cancer than their AA counterparts had; this may be due to genetic (37) 
and environmental factors such as diet (4,38,39) in addition to the confounding factor such 
as E+P users that are associated with white women and higher risk of breast cancer. Overall, 
these findings support our hypothesis that the association between IGF-I and racial disparity 
in obesity-related cancer is modified by exogenous E use status.
This study has limitations. We measured serum IGF-I levels only at baseline, which 
prevented us from evaluating possible changes over time in circulating levels. We 
acknowledge that long freezer storage of biological specimens might potentially lead to 
degradation which could affect the measurements of the IGF-I. We could not substratify 
women by transdermal vs. oral estrogen usage, but the small proportion (6%) of transdermal 
users may not have affected the overall analytic results. This study evaluated the hypothesis-
driven questions retrospectively (i.e., non-randomized study) among postmenopausal 
women; thus, the results could be prone to selection and information bias and limit the 
generalizability to other populations. AA women made up only 6% of our study population, 
which may lead to an increased risk of type II errors. In addition, the self-reported basis of 
race information may affect the biologic accuracy of race. About 80% of IGF-I proteins are 
bound to IGFBP-3, and 19% of IGF-I is bound to other binding proteins, resulting in less 
than 1% of IGF-I being free, which speaks to the bioactivity of IGF-I. We used the level of 
free bioavailable IGF-I and replaced missing data with the molar ratios of total IGF-I/
IGFBP-3, which roughly represents bioavailable IGF-I.(31)

 Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings suggest that in postmenopausal women, bioavailable IGF-I 
accounts for a substantial amount of the racial disparity in risk of obesity-related cancers 
such as breast and CR cancers. Body-fat distribution and exogenous estrogen usage may 
contribute to the connected hormonal pathways associated with the racial disparities in IGF-I 
levels and obesity-related cancer risk, and further studies are needed to explore these 
complicated mechanisms. Our findings may provide improved understanding of the role of 
bioavailable IGF-I in explaining the racial disparity directly or indirectly in obesity-related 
cancer risk and emphasize the potentially important roles of obesity and exogenous estrogen 
usage in reducing the racial disparity in cancer risk among postmenopausal women.

¥A participant was considered to have diabetes if a doctor had ever said that she had diabetes when she was not pregnant.
¶Physical activity was estimated via MET from recreational physical activity combining walking and mild, moderate, and strenuous physical 
activity; each activity was assigned a MET value corresponding to intensity, and the total MET·hours·week-1 was calculated by multiplying the 
MET level for the activity by the hours exercised per week and summing the values for all activities. The total MET was stratified into two groups, 
with 10 METs as the cutoff.(40,41)
‡HEI-2005 is a measure of diet quality that assesses adherence to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The total 
HEI score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher diet quality.

Note: Proportions explained by free IGF-I for racial disparity in breast cancer risk = 58.9%, 32.2% and 29.1% among non-obese group (BMI <30.0, waist ≤88 cm, and waist/hip ratio [W/H] ≤0.85, 
respectively) and = 6.4%, 21.3%, and 25.4% among obese-group (BMI ≥30.0, waist >88 cm, and W/H >0.85, respectively). Numbers in bold face are statistically significant.
†Multivariate regression was adjusted by covariates (age, education, marital status, family history of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease ever, diabetes ever, hypertension ever, high cholesterol requiring 
pills ever, total Healthy Eating Index-2005 score, dietary alcohol, smoking status, physical activity, oral contraceptive use, history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, age at menarche, and age at 
menopause); effect-modifier variables (obesity and exogenous estrogen use), when not evaluated as effect modifier variables, were adjusted as a covariate; waist circumference and waist/hip ratio were 
exclusively adjusted, as were E-only and E+P use.
¥Indirect effect indicates the effect of free IGF-I that mediates the relationship between race and breast cancer risk.
*95% CIs and P values were estimated by using a delta method to test for a mediation effect of free IGF-I on the relationship between race and breast cancer risk.
