Since the beginning of this century, humanity has been facing a new emerging, or
re-emerging, virus threat almost every year: West Nile, Influenza A, avian flu, dengue,
Chikungunya, SARS, MERS, Ebola, and now Zika, the latest newcomer. Zika virus
(ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, was identifi
ed in 1947 in a
sentinel monkey in Uganda, and later on in humans in Nigeria. The virus was mainly
confi
ned to the African continent until it was detected in south-east Asia the 1980’s,
then in the Micronesia in 2007 and, more recently in the Americas in 2014, where
it has displayed an explosive spread, as advised by the World Health Organization,
which resulted in the infection of hundreds of thousands of people. ZIKV infection
was characterized by causing a mild disease presented with fever, headache, rash,
arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, with exceptional reports of an association with Guillain–
Barre syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. However, since the end of 2015, an increase
in the number of GBS associated cases and an astonishing number of microcephaly
in fetus and new-borns in Brazil have been related to ZIKV infection, raising serious
worldwide public health concerns. Clarifying such worrisome relationships is, thus, a
current unavoidable goal. Here, we extensively review what is currently known about
ZIKV, from molecular biology, transmission routes, ecology, and epidemiology, to clinical
manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and public health.

THE VIRUS
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) classified into the Flavivirus genus
within the Flaviviridae family1. Flaviviruses are small enveloped single stranded positive RNA
viruses that include important human and animal pathogens such as yellow fever virus (YFV),
dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) or tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (Gould and Solomon, 2008).
Historically, ZIKV was discovered in the course of investigations designed to study the vector
responsible for the non-human cycle of yellow fever in Uganda almost 70 years ago. The first
isolation was made in April 1947 from the serum of a febrile sentinel rhesus monkey (named
Rhesus 766) that was caged in the canopy of Zika Forest, near Lake Victoria (Dick et al., 1952).
The second isolation was made from Aedes africanus mosquitoes caught in the same forest in
January 1948 (Dick et al., 1952). Thus, ZIKV received its name from the geographical area where
the initial isolations were made. Both isolations were performed by intracerebral inoculation into
Swiss albino mice of the samples containing the virus (serum from febrile monkey or mosquito

homogenates)
demonstrating
that
ZIKV
was
a
filterable
transmissible agent (Dick et al., 1952). These early filtration
studies indicated that the size of ZIKV was in the range of
about 30–
45 nm in diameter (Dick, 1952). Further transmission
electron microscopy analysis of ZIKV infected cells revealed that
the virions were spherical particles with an overall diameter of
40–
43 nm and a central electron dense core being 28–
30 nm
in diameter (Bell et al., 1971; Hamel et al., 2015). Although
there are still no specific studies on the structure of ZIKV, it
can be inferred from other flaviviruses (Mukhopadhyay et al.,
2005) that the viral particles should be about 50 nm in diameter,
which is compatible with the observations performed for ZIKV.
Cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of flavivirus particles
have shown that virions are composed by a central core that
contains the capsid or core (C) protein associated with the viral
genomic RNA. This nucleocapsid is enclosed into a lipid bilayer
derived from the host cell. The membrane (M) and envelope
(E) proteins are anchored into the lipid envelope and conform
the smooth outer shell of the virion, which is constituted by
180 copies of the M and E proteins arranged as 90 anti-parallel
homodimers (Kuhn et al., 2002; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003).
Regarding the stability of the virion, it has been described
that ZIKV suspensions were most stable at pH of 6.8–
7.4 and
particles were inactivated at pH of under 6.2 and over 7.8, by
potassium permanganate, ether, and temperatures of 58 ◦C for
30 min, or 60◦C for 15 min, but the infectivity was not effectively
neutralized with 10% ethanol (Dick, 1952).
Genome
The flavivirus genome is constituted by a single-stranded RNA
molecule of positive polarity that, in a similar manner to
cellular mRNAs, includes a cap structure at its 5� end (Dong
et al., 2014). Proper methylation of this structure is important
not only for efficient translation of viral genome, but also for
evasion of immune response (Daffis et al., 2010). The sequence
of the prototype strain of ZIKV MR766, which corresponds
to a passaged virus derived from the initial ZIKV isolated by
intracerebral inoculation of the serum of the febrile monkey
(Rhesus 766) into mice in 1947 (Dick, 1952; Dick et al., 1952),
revealed that the ZIKV genome was 10794 nucleotides in length
(Kuno and Chang, 2007). The genome contains a single open
reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein of about 3400
amino acids (Figure 1) that is expected to be cleaved into
the mature viral proteins (see next section for polyprotein
processing). The single ORF is flanked by two untraslated regions
(UTR) located at the 5� and 3� ends of the genome, which in
the prototype ZIKV MR766 are of 106 and 428 nucleotides
in length, respectively (Kuno and Chang, 2007). Remarkably,
and in contrast to cellular mRNAs, ZIKV genome lacks a 3�
poly(A) tract and ends with CUOH in a similar manner to
the other flaviviruses. Subsequent studies have confirmed that
this basic organization is shared among other isolates of ZIKV,
although differences in length and nucleotide sequence have been
documented among different isolates, even among ZIKV MR766
isolates with different passage history (Lanciotti et al., 2008;
Haddow et al., 2012; Baronti et al., 2014; Berthet et al., 2014).
The cyclization of flavivirus genome between 5� and 3� terminal
regions, which is important for the functionality of the genome, is
mediated by the interaction of complementary sequences located
with genome regions termed conserved sequences (CSs). These
CS (CS1 to CS3) are also present in the ZIKV genome, suggesting
that has the potential for cyclization. Nevertheless, it has to be
remarked that the organization of the CS in the 3�end of ZIKV
is different from that of other mosquito-borne flaviviruses (Kuno
and Chang, 2007).
Viral Proteins
The viral polyprotein encoded by the single ORF in ZIKV
(Figure 1), as in other related flaviviruses, is supposed to be
cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into three structural
proteins: the capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM/M), and
envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A,
NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The predicted cleavage
sites of ZIKV basically follow the patterns established for other
mosquito-borne viruses, and, likewise, cysteine residues within
the polyprotein are well conserved relative to other mosquito-
borne flavivirus (Kuno and Chang, 2007). Different proteases
participate in the processing of the viral polyprotein: the host
cellular signalase which cleaves M/E, E/NS1, and the C-terminal
hydrophobic region of NS4A (termed 2K peptide)/NS4B. The
viral serine protease (NS3) is expected to cleave the junctions
between the virion capsid protein (Cv) and the C-terminal
hydrophobic domain of capsid protein (Ci) [Cv/Ci], NS2A/NS2B,
NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, NS4A/2K peptide, and NS4B/NS5. The
NS1/NS2A is believed to be cleaved by an unknown cellular
signalase (Kuno and Chang, 2007). Of key importance is the
proteolytic cleavage of prM to give the pr peptide and M protein,
which is produced by furin-like protease located in the trans-
Golgi network during the egress of the particles and promote the
maturation of the virions (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005).
The analysis of the polyprotein sequence predicts the presence
of potential N-glycosylation sites in the ZIKV proteins prM,
E, and NS1 (Kuno and Chang, 2007; Baronti et al., 2014;
Berthet et al., 2014). However, the functional significance of
the N-glycosylations is not clear in related flaviviruses, since
deglycosylated flaviviruses can maintain the same antigenicity,
suggesting that carbohydrate does not play a major role in the
antigenic properties of the virus (Winkler et al., 1987), and
that glycosylation does not alter epitope recognition (Vorndam
et al., 1993). On the other hand, glycosylation could be
important for replication and maturation (Li et al., 2006). In
the case of ZIKV, there are differences among strains due to
a 12 nucleotides deletion on the glycosylation motif located
at position 154 in the E protein (E-154), which is present
in many flaviviruses (Lanciotti et al., 2008; Haddow et al.,
2012; Baronti et al., 2014). Remarkably, there are differences
on this site even between ZIKV isolates with different passage
history, such as those of the prototypic strain ZIKV MR766,
indicating that passage history influences glycosylation sites
(Haddow et al., 2012). However, the loss of glycosylation on
the E-154 residue is not unique to ZIKV and has also been
observed in other flaviviruses (Adams et al., 1995; Berthet et al.,
1997). Although the functional role of glycosylation in the
E protein is not clear, the presence of this glycosylation in

other flaviviruses has been associated with the ability to cause
significant human outbreaks (Shirato et al., 2004). Moreover, it
has been suggested that the fact that ZIKV strains isolated during
the recent human outbreak in Oceania contain this N-linked
glycosylation signal, whereas the majority of other strains does
not, could indicate that the N-linked glycosylation of the E
protein plays a role on the pathogenicity of ZIKV (Baronti
et al., 2014; Berthet et al., 2014). Nevertheless, functional studies
are required to provide an experimental confirmation of this
hypothesis.
Regarding the functions of the flaviviral proteins, the three
structural proteins participate in the assembly of the virions.
As commented above, the C protein associates with the
genomic RNA to conform the core of the virions, and the
E protein should mediate the binding to the cellular receptor
of the virus and promotes the fusion of the virions with the
endosomal membranes of the target cell during viral entry
(Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005; Roby et al., 2015). Relative to
prM function, this protein assists the folding of E protein
as a sort of chaperone and prevents premature fusion of the
particles prior to be released from the infected cell, and the
cleavage of prM into M protein also promotes the maturation
of the viral particles (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005; Roby et al.,
2015).
To our knowledge there are currently no specific studies
addressing the function of non-structural proteins of ZIKV, but
it is expected that some functions could be inferred from related
flaviviruses (Martin-Acebes and Saiz, 2012; Acosta et al., 2014),
such as the induction of membrane rearrangements associated
with flavivirus replication (NS4A), and the immunomodulation
(NS1, NS2A) or regulation of RNA replication and viral assembly
(NS2A). Furthermore, NS2B acts as a cofactor for the viral
trypsin-like serine protease NS3, which can also act as a
helicase. NS5 is the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase
that is in charge of genome replication, and that also displays
a methyltransferase domain necessary for capping the 5� end
of the viral genomic RNA. Since flavivirus non-structural
proteins constitute major targets for antiviral research (Noble
and Shi, 2012; Luo et al., 2015), deciphering the specific role
of the non-structural proteins in ZIKV infection could greatly
contribute to the development of antiviral strategies against this
pathogen.
Host Cell-Virus Interactions
Zika virus can infect a broad range of cells from different tissues
and species. For instance, experimental infection by blood meal
has revealed that ZIKV replicates in the midgut and salivary
glands of diverse Aedes mosquitoes (Li et al., 2012; Wong et al.,
2013), and also in vitro in cultured mosquito cells C6/36 (Hamel
et al., 2015). ZIKV also replicates in a wide variety of mammalian
cell types. Experimental infection in mice has revealed that the
virus replicates mainly in brain cells, including neurons, and
astroglial cells (Weinbren and Williams, 1958; Bell et al., 1971),
and, in vitro, it can replicate in cultured monkey cell lines such as
LLC- MK2, or Vero, inducing cytopathic effect (Way et al., 1976).
Furthermore, the titer of ZIKV in cultured cells seems to well
correlate with the infectivity of the virus in vivo (Way et al., 1976).
In addition, it has also been recently reported that ZIKV can
replicate in human skin cells and also in immature dendritic cells
(Hamel et al., 2015). This ability of the virus to replicate in cells
from different sources could be related to its transmission cycle,
which includes replication in mosquito (vector) and mammalian
cells (host).
It has been described that ZIKV enters the cell using
adhesion factors such as DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific
Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin) and
diverse members of the phosphatidylserine receptor family
(Hamel et al., 2015). Once the attached viral particles are
internalized into the cell (Figure 2), the viral genome should be
released inside the cytoplasm to start translation and replication.
The mechanism of penetration of the flavivirus genome into
the cytoplasm is initiated by the fusion of the viral envelope
with the membranes of the cellular endosomes from the host
cell, a process triggered by acidic pH inside cellular endosomes
(Stiasny et al., 2011; Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2012). This mechanism
of penetration is consistent with, as mentioned before, an
early observation showing that ZIKV particles were sensible to
acidic pH, and were inactivated by treatment with acidic pH
lower than 6.2 (Dick, 1952). Along this line, the sensitivity of
ZIKV particles to acidic pH is consistent with the observation
performed with other flaviviruses indicating that, in the absence
of target membranes, the exposure of flavivirus virions to
acidic pH induces rearrangements of the E glycoprotein, which
result in a loss of infectivity (Gollins and Porterfield, 1986).
The viral RNA acts as mRNA inside the cytoplasm of the

infected cell, and negative-strand viral RNA is synthesized and
directs positive-strand RNA synthesis in association with a virus-
induced network of membranes derived from the endoplasmic
reticulum, ER (Figure 2). Electron microscopy studies of virus
infected cells showed that ZIKV virions are found in short chains
within tubular elements of the ER, which appeared to be in
continuity with distended cisternae (Bell et al., 1971). These
images were similar to membrane rearrangements observed
in other flavivirus infected cells (Welsch et al., 2009; Martin-
Acebes et al., 2011; Miorin et al., 2013). Although flavivirus
replication is thought to occur in the cellular cytoplasm, it
should be noted that one study reported that ZIKV antigens
could be found in infected cell nuclei (Buckley and Gould,
1988).
De novo synthesized positive strand-RNA has to be packaged
in progeny virions that bud into the ER to form enveloped
immature virions (Figure 2). These virions traffic through the
Golgi complex and, then, the prM is cleaved in the trans-
Golgi network for particle maturation prior to release from the
infected cell (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005; Roby et al., 2015).
Remarkably, the observations made for other flaviviruses have
revealed that not all the copies of the prM protein in the secreted
virions are cleaved, and, thus, that a proportion of them remains
unprocessed in the secreted virions (Plevka et al., 2011). Even

more, the amount of prM within the flavivirus virions varies with
the cell line used for the production of the virus and the infecting
flavivirus, and could be of key importance for the antigenicity of
the particles (Pierson and Diamond, 2012; Lok, 2016).
Knowledge regarding the cellular response to ZIKV infection
is still scarce. However, it has been experimentally probed
that replication of ZIKV provokes an innate antiviral response,
inducing the transcription of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5, as well
as that of several interferon stimulated genes, such as OAS2,
ISG15, and MX1, characterized by a strongly enhanced beta
interferon gene expression (Hamel et al., 2015). In addition,
ZIKV infection is sensitive to interferon (IFN) signaling, as
pretreatment of primary skin fibroblasts with IFN-alpha, beta,
and gamma reduces ZIKV infection (Hamel et al., 2015). ZIKV
infection also upregulates the autophagic pathway in infected
skin fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015), which is consistent with
the observations for other related flaviviruses (Blazquez et al.,
2014). Moreover, the autophagic marker LC3 colocalizes with
viral proteins within ZIKV-infected cells, and the infection
can be reduced by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-
methyladenine, whereas upregulation of autophagy using Torin
1 increases ZIKV replication (Hamel et al., 2015).
MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION
Zika virus is genetically and antigenically related to Spondweni
virus. Both viruses form a unique clade (clade X) within the
mosquito-borne flavivirus cluster (Kuno et al., 1998) (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic analyses reveal the existence of two major lineages:
one includes the African strains, and the other the Asian and
American strains (Haddow et al., 2012; Alera et al., 2015)
(Figure 4). The African lineage is further divided into two groups,
the East African cluster, containing the genetic variants of the

prototypic MR766 strain isolated in Uganda in 1947, and a second
group including West African strains (Olson et al., 1981).
Phylogenetic studies (Faye et al., 2014) have established the
date of the emergence of ZIKV in east Africa around 1920
(confidence range of 1892–
1947). The same study dated the
transmission of eastern African ZIKV to Asia around 1945
(confidence range 1920–
1960), where the virus was first detected
in the late 1960s in Malaysia (Marchette et al., 1969), and
subsequently across south-east Asia. These data indicated a
widespread occurrence of ZIKV from Africa to Southeast Asia,
west and north of the Wallace line (Lanciotti et al., 2008).
Phylogenetic studies have confirmed that Pacific Island ZIKV
strains are related to the Asian lineages (Gatherer and Kohl,
2016). Due to the great geographical distances involved, it seems
likely that the virus was introduced to the island either by a
viremic person, an enzootic host species, or an infected mosquito
transported to the island (Haddow et al., 2012). On the other
hand, recent transmission to the Americas appears to have
originated in the Pacific Islands (Campos et al., 2015; Zanluca
et al., 2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences placed the
Brazilian and other American strains in a clade with sequences
from the Asian lineage, showing a 99% identity with a sequence
from a ZIKV isolate from French Polynesia (Baronti et al., 2014;
Campos et al., 2015) (Figure 4). It has been postulated that two
events may have led to the introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, the
2014 FIFA World Cup tournament and an international canoe
racing event (Musso, 2015), but since Pacific nations were only
represented among the canoe racers, the latter seems to be a
likeliest introduction route.
As exemplified in Figure 4, ZIKV strains collected in the
same geographical region during several years show minimal
changes on their sequences, as is the case of strains collected
from mosquitoes in a 3 years interval in Central African
Republic (Berthet et al., 2014). In this regard, it has been
described that infection and transmission modes of ZIKV allow
the accumulation of synonymous mutations and negatively
selected certain sites (Faye et al., 2014). The arbovirus life cycle
imposes several barriers to non-synonymous mutations in some
important genes as a consequence of the intrinsic constraints
associated with dual replication in mammalian and invertebrate
hosts, thus driving to a more slowly fixation of mutations of these
viruses when compared with RNA viruses transmitted by other
routes. In fact, arboviruses, which are able to successfully adapt to
diverse cell types, are characterized by a high rate of deleterious
mutations (Holmes, 2003).
Human-to-human transmission of the Asian ZIKV strains
along the Pacific Islands and South America has been associated
with significant NS1 codon usage adaptation to human
housekeeping genes, which could facilitate viral replication and
increase viral titers (Freire et al., 2015). Furthermore, this
report predicted the presence of several epitopes in the NS1
protein that are shared between ZIKV and DENV, pointing to a
significant dependence of the recent human ZIKV spread on NS1
translational selection.
As mentioned above, it is noteworthy to note that several of
the ZIKV strains exhibited a 4 amino acid deletion corresponding
to the envelope protein 154 glycosylation motif found in many
flaviviruses (Berthet et al., 2014).
TRANSMISSION CYCLE
Mosquitoes
The arthropod vectors of the ZIKV natural transmission cycle
are mosquitoes of the genus Aedes (Diagne et al., 2015). As
mentioned early, the virus was first isolated from A. africanus
(Dick et al., 1952) and, since then, ZIKV has been isolated from
A. aegypti (Marchette et al., 1969), the main vector of the virus,
and also from A. albopictus (Grard et al., 2014), confirming that
both species are competent vectors.
Aedes aegypti is currently distributed in Asia and Oceania, the
Americas, and in a few regions of Africa and Europe (Madeira

and the north-eastern Black Sea coast)2; however, it has been
recently predicted that this species might soon colonize some
southern European regions, as well as temperate North America
and Australia (Kraemer et al., 2015). The first evidence of the
role of A. aegypti in the urban transmission cycle of ZIKV was
suggested after its isolation from a pool of mosquitoes collected
in 1966 in Malaysia, in what it was the first isolation from a
mosquito other than A. africanus (Marchette et al., 1969).
Aedes albopictus, the so-called Asian tiger mosquito, is also
widely distributed. This species is currently circulating in Asia,
North, Central and South America (Kraemer et al., 2015),
northern Australia, and in some areas of Africa and southern
Europe, where it has spread in the past two decades to France,
Germany, Italy, and Spain (Paupy et al., 2009; Dyer, 2016).
Contrary to A. aegypti, A. albopictus can hibernate and survive
in cool temperature regions (Thomas et al., 2012). This species
can also efficiently transmit the virus, as demonstrated during
the outbreak that took place in Gabon in 2007, where, among all
species tested (including A. aegypti), it was the only one in which
the virus was detected, thus confirming that A. albopictus may
also play an important role in ZIKV transmission (Grard et al.,
2014).
The ability of ZIKV to be efficiently transmitted by both
mosquito species (A. aegypti and A. albopictus) that feed on
humans further complicates their control and, thus, that of
ZIKV. Both species grow very close to human populations, but
while A. aegypti feed almost exclusively on humans in daylight
hours and typically rest indoors (Scott and Takken, 2012),
A. albopictus is usually exophagic and bites humans and also
domestic and livestock animals (Paupy et al., 2009), although
under some circumstances it preferentially feed on humans,
hence, confirming that it can also have an anthropophilic
behavior similar to A. aegypti (Ponlawat and Harrington, 2005;
Delatte et al., 2010). Therefore, methods of control for a species
may not be accurate to control the other one. Furthermore,
when the populations of A. aegypti is reduced, the opportunistic
invasive A. albopictus may rapidly move into the area (Higgs,
2016).
Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, A. albopticus are clearly
involved in ZIKV transmission and spread, but other Aedes spp.,
such as A. polynesienis, are suspected to have also contributed
to it, as it was the case during the 2013–
2014 outbreak in the
French Polynesia (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014). In fact, ZIKV
has been also isolated from, at least, other 15 Aedes species
in different regions of the world (Table 1). Even more, in the
Kédougou region of Senegal, ZIKV was also amplified from
pools of three mosquito species other than Aedes: Anopheles
coustani, Culex perfuscus, and Mansonia uniformis (Diallo et al.,
2014).
As in other arboviral infections, local overwintering could
be an important aspect for maintenance and spread of ZIKV.
Detection of the virus in a pool of A. furcifer males in
2011 in Senegal, even though no infected A. furcifer females
were collected, strongly suggested that ZIKV is vertically

transmitted, at least in this species, and that this transmission
route may be an important mechanism of local maintenance
(Diallo et al., 2014).
Finally, although most of these data were obtained by analyses
of ZIKV naturally infected mosquitoes, their current vector
competence still has to be clearly established. In this sense,
different Aedes species (A. aegypti, A. unilineatus, A. vittatus, and
A. luteocephalus) were recently tested in their susceptibility to
ZIKV oral infection, and, although all of them were susceptible,
viral genome could be amplified from saliva only in the case of
A. vittatus and A. luteocephalus mosquitoes (Diagne et al., 2015).

Zika Virus
Humans and Non-human Primates
During outbreaks, humans are the primary host for ZIKV
(Staples et al., 2016), and both urban (Grard et al., 2014)
and sylvatic (Berthet et al., 2014) viral transmission have been
demonstrated. First ZIKV isolation from humans was reported
in 1954 in Nigeria (Macnamara, 1954), although antibodies to the
virus had been previously found during early surveys on human
sera in different regions of Africa (Dick, 1952; Smithburn, 1952).
Recently, and albeit an estimated 80% of ZIKV infected people
are asymptomatic3, during the ongoing outbreak in Brazil, ZIKV
RNA has been identified in brain, placenta, and amniotic fluid
specimens, and its presence has been associated to microcephaly
in infants and miscarries during pregnancy (Martines et al., 2016;
Mlakar et al., 2016).
One important aspect that still has to be clarified is whether
ZIKV infection in humans drives to viral titers enough to initiate
a new cycle when an infected person is bitten by a naïve mosquito.
Early studies attempting to infect A. aegypti from a ZIKV-infected
human volunteer to further transmit the agent to newborns mice
were unsuccessful (Bearcroft, 1956), probably because viremia
was too low, even though the volunteer was bitten during the
acute phase of the disease (4–
6 days after infection). Later on, a
recent attempt to isolate circulating virus from infected patients
of the 2007 Gabonese outbreak on mammalian (Vero) and insect
(C6/36) cell lines was again unsuccessful, presumably because
of low viral titers (despite two patients presenting only 1 and
4 days after symptom onset), although the inappropriate initial
storage conditions could have also contributed to it (Grard
et al., 2014). In this line, the estimated number of genome
copies circulating in ZIKV-infected patients during the 2007
outbreak on the Pacific Island of Yap was reported to be
0.9 × 103–
7.2 × 105 cDNA copies/ml (Lanciotti et al., 2008).
These relatively low levels of viremia among ZIKV-infected
patients are very far from those reported for other arboviruses, as
Chikungunya (CHIK) and DENV-2, where an estimated 107 and
108 cDNA copies/ml were reported, respectively (Caron et al.,
2012), but they are in the range of other dead-end flavivirus
infection in humans, such as that of WNV, where viral loads
from 50 to 6.9 × 105 copies/ml are observed (Pupella et al.,
2013). Therefore, further experiments are needed to clarify this
issue.
In the case of non-human primates, it is known that epizootics
occur in them (McCrae and Kirya, 1982), but it is unclear whether
they are an obligatory reservoir in the transmission to humans.
In Africa, ZIKV natural transmission cycle involves primarily
Cercopithecus aethiops and Erythrocebus patas monkeys (Faye
et al., 2013). In Asia (Borneo), antibodies against ZIKV have
been detected among semi-captive and wild orangutans (Wolfe
et al., 2001). However, this study reported a higher prevalence of
anti-ZIKV antibodies in humans than in orangutans, suggesting
a possible incidental infection of these animals through contact
with mosquitoes infected by viremic people, or from recently
established sylvatic cycles. Nonetheless, it is also possible that
sylvatic ZIKV transmitting mosquitoes in Borneo have a more
3http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/zika_virus_infection/factsheet-health-
professionals/Pages/factsheet_health_professionals.aspx
narrow distribution, or an ecology that does not lead to frequent
exposure by orangutans.
An acute symptomatic ZIKV infection case after a monkey
bite has been recently described (Leung et al., 2015). Even
though transmission throughout mosquito bite could not be
completely discharged, the presence of ZIKV in the human
pharynx and the previous identification of ZIKV RNA in saliva
from asymptomatic infected patients (Besnard et al., 2014) could
be consistent with a potential transmission from primates’
bite
(Leung et al., 2015).
Other Vertebrates
Information regarding the possible susceptibility of animals other
than human and non-human primates is limited. Antibodies
directed against ZIKV have been found in several vertebrates
species, such rodents, birds, reptiles, goats, sheep, and cattle
in Kenya (Johnson et al., 1977), and in Pakistan, where some
species of rodents were suggested as possible reservoirs of ZIKV
(Darwish et al., 1983). In addition, the rapid periodicity of
amplification observed in Senegal along the 2011 outbreak could
support that, besides primates, other vertebrates may also play a
role in ZIKV circulation (Diallo et al., 2014).
Non-vector
Sporadic reports of direct human-to-human transmission have
been reported to occur perinatally, sexually, and through
breastfeeding and blood transfusion. Likewise, occupational
transmission in the laboratory setting has also been described
(Filipe et al., 1973).
Perinatal transmission from two mothers to their new-borns
during the French Polynesia outbreak has been documented,
although contamination during delivery was not completely
discarded (Besnard et al., 2014). Sera from the mothers were
positive for ZIKV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) within 2 days post-delivery and those of their
newborns within 4 days after birth. In addition, high ZIKV RNA
load was detected in breast milk samples from both mothers,
albeit the virus could not be multiplied in susceptible cell
cultures. Therefore, ZIKV transmission by breastfeeding must be
considered and further clarify. Similarly, a first case of perinatal
transmission of ZIKV was suspected to have occurred during the
same outbreak from a mother that present a ZIKV infection-like
syndrome 2 weeks before delivery, with the newborn showing a
maculopapular rash at birth; however, virological investigations
were not performed in this case (Besnard et al., 2014).
Besides these sporadic cases of non-vector transmission, the
most surprising phenomenon on ZIKV infection is, without
any doubt, the unexpected number of infants supposedly born
with microcephaly (see clinical manifestations and pathogenesis
section below) in Brazil during the ongoing viral outbreak,
apparently as a result of their mothers being infected during
pregnancy, since, in some cases, ZIKV-RNA has been detected in
the amniotic fluid of the mothers4. Around 4000 cases of Zika-
related microcephaly have been recorded in that country until

now since October 2015, accounting for over 40 infants deaths
(Higgs, 2016). Furthermore, ZIKV has been recently found in the
fetal brain tissue of a baby with microcephaly after termination
of the pregnancy requested by the infected woman (Mlakar et al.,
2016).
At present (February 2016), three reported cases indicate
that ZIKV could be sexually transmitted. In August 2008, a
scientist was bitten many times while studying mosquitoes in
south-eastern Senegal. Six days after returning to his home in
Colorado (U.S.), he felt ill with symptoms of Zika fever and
hematospermia. By then, he had had unprotected intercourse
with his wife, who had not been outside the U.S. during the
previous year, which subsequently developed symptoms of Zika
fever. Virus infection was confirmed by serologic testing in both,
but the presence of ZIKV in the semen of the patient was not
investigated (Foy et al., 2011). A second report described the
presence of replicative ZIKV and a high ZIKV RNA load in
semen (1,1–
2,9 × 107 copies/ml) and urine (3,8 × 103 copies/ml)
samples of a patient during the 2013 outbreak in Tahiti, but no
RT-PCR amplification was obtained from sera collected at the
same time (Musso et al., 2015b). In early February 2016, the
Dallas County Health and Human Services Department (U.S.)
reported a third case, still under investigation, of a person that
apparently contracted Zika fever after sexual contact with an
ill person who had recently returned from a ZIKV high risk
country5.
In addition to perinatal, breastfeeding, and sexual sporadic
transmission of ZIKV, the potential for viral transmission
through blood transfusion was demonstrated during the French
Polynesian outbreak. Almost 3% (42/1505) of blood donors,
who were asymptomatic at the time of donation, were found
positive for acute ZIKV infection by specific RT-PCR (Musso
et al., 2014a). Further studies are needed to assess the actual risk
of ZIKV transmission through blood products and the risk to
generate a disease in the recipient, but these data point to the
necessity for quickly adapting blood donation safety procedures
to the local epidemiological context. In fact, the Pan American
Health Organization, PAHO6, and the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Controls, ECDC7, have recently issued a
bulletins to alert their national health and blood safety authorities
on this still poorly recognized viral infection.
Finally, ZIKV has been also detected in saliva samples
(Besnard et al., 2014) with even higher frequency than in
blood samples (Musso et al., 2015a) and, thus, saliva is another
transmission source that have to be considered.
In resume, although ZIKV transmission by routes other
than mosquito bites has been so far sporadic, further studies
are mandatory to clearly establish their possible role on ZIKV
epidemics.

ECOLOGY
Most
arboviruses
are
perpetuated
in
transmission
cycles
independent of human hosts, but those with sylvatic cycles often
infect people who accidentally intrude on their natural habitats.
Nonetheless, in many instances, humans are dead-end hosts
in complex transmission cycles that involve different wild and
domestic vertebrate hosts, as in the case of JEV (Wolfe et al.,
2001) or WNV (Martin-Acebes and Saiz, 2012). Less frequently,
arboviruses may jump from this sylvatic transmission cycle to a
mainly human-mosquito transmission cycle, as it likely was the
case of CHIKV.
In the case of ZIKV, early studies indicated that non-human
primates were the primary vertebrate hosts, with occasional
participation of humans in the transmission cycle, even in highly
enzootic areas. This theory was based on evidences indicating
that A. africanus, a species with a greater preference for them
than for humans (Haddow and Dick, 1948; Haddow et al., 1964),
was the principal (if not the only) ZIKV vector (Haddow et al.,
1964). However, by now, it seems clear that, as commented
before, A. aegypti and, to a lesser extent, A. albopticus are the
main vectors and, thus, that humans probably serve as primary
amplification hosts when their viremia is sufficient in duration
and magnitude (Haddow et al., 2012).
Although it is still unknown if ZIKV overwinters in
geographical areas without reports of cases, it appears that,
as in other flaviviral infections, such as that caused by WNV
(Martin-Acebes and Saiz, 2012), epidemics are more related to
the specific mosquito species, its population density, competence,
and behavior in a given area, as this can shape virus dynamics.
Aedes
aegypti,
which,
as
mentioned
before,
is
found
throughout Asia, Oceania, the Americas and in some regions of
Africa and Europe2 (Kraemer et al., 2015), does not overwinter,
but can be sheltered in domestic settings, which provides prot-
ection against environmental conditions and numerous aquatic
habitats suitable for oviposition. Beside Georgia, this species
does not currently circulate in Europe, but there are no climatic
reasons to believe that, if re-introduced, it cannot become widely
established in southern Europe as before (Reiter, 2010).
Meanwhile, A. albopictus, the most invasive mosquito species
in the world (Medlock et al., 2012), have spread during the
last 30–
40 years to North, Central and South America, parts
of Africa, southeastern Asia, China, Japan, northern Australia,
and southern Europe (Paupy et al., 2009). This successfully
colonization of new regions is due to its ability to adapt
to different climates through the production of cold-resistant
eggs, with temperate strains surviving cold winters in northern
latitudes. On top of that, its preference for container habitats
(e.g., tires and vases) in domestic settings has resulted in increased
potential for contact with humans (Medlock et al., 2012).
ZIKV pandemic is currently in progress, with many important
questions still unanswered. However, as seen during recent
years with other viral agents, urban overcrowding, constant
international travel, disruption of the ecologic balance, and
climate changes can favored the unexpected emergence of asleep,
or yet unknown, infectious agents (Fauci and Morens, 2016).
Therefore, comprehensive and integrated investigations have

to be conducted to better understand the complex ecosystems
in which agents of current and future pandemics could be
aggressively evolving.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Africa
Since the first isolation of ZIKV in 1954 from an inhabitant of
Nigeria (Macnamara, 1954), many serological and entomological
studies have reported the circulation of the virus across a
widespread area of Africa, including Kenya (Geser et al., 1970),
Nigeria (Lee and Moore, 1972; Monath et al., 1973; Fagbami,
1979), Sierra Leone (Robin and Mouchet, 1975), Gabon (Jan
et al., 1978; Grard et al., 2014), Uganda (McCrae and Kirya,
1982), Central African Republic (Saluzzo et al., 1981), Senegal
(Monlun et al., 1993; Diallo et al., 2014; Althouse et al., 2015),
and Ivory Coast (Akoua-Koffi et al., 2001), with prevalence
ranging 1.3–
52%. At present, Cape Verde is the only African
country where, since last year, active viral transmission is
currently being reported8,9 (Figure 5). From the beginning of
the outbreak in October 2015 to 7th February of this year, the
Health Authorities have reported 7362 cases without associated
neurological disorders10. In any case, and although until now

10http://www.minsaude.gov.cv/index.php/documentos/cat_view/34-document
acao/72-zika-virus
human cases of ZIKV related disease have only been sporadically
documented in Africa, it should be kept in mind that this might
have been partially due to underdiagnoses, mainly in areas where
DENV and CHIKV circulate, as infection with all these viruses
presents similar clinical signs (Weissenbock et al., 2010; Grard
et al., 2014).
Asia
In Asia, distinguishing ZIKV infection from other arboviral
infections (dengue, yellow fever, and other tropical diseases) is
also difficult, so that, early epidemiological data should be treated
with caution. In the early 50’
s, seroprevalence of ZIKV in humans
was reported in several countries: India, Malaysia, Philippines,
Vietnam, and Thailand with variable rates, 8–
75% (Smithburn,
1954; Smithburn et al., 1954; Hammon et al., 1958; Pond, 1963;
Marchette et al., 1969). As the time went by, other countries
reported seroprevalence in humans: Indonesia (Java island) from
1977 to 1978 (Olson et al., 1981, 1983) and Pakistan in 1980
(Darwish et al., 1983). More recently a few sporadic human cases
have been documented: a confirmed case in Cambodia in 2010
(Heang et al., 2012), an infected traveler who returned from
Indonesia in 2013 (Kwong et al., 2013), and some several ZIKV
positive cases from travelers returning from Thailand during
2012–
2014 (Buathong et al., 2015). Very recently, in January
2016, WHO notified a case of ZIKV infection in a traveler coming
back to Finland after spending a few months in the Maldives11
(Figure 5).

Zika Virus
Oceania
In April 2007, a ZIKV outbreak was reported in Yap Island,
Micronesia. The way through the virus was introduced is still
unknown, but, as commented before, it has been proposed it
was due to an infected mosquito or to an asymptomatic person
with undetected infection. Serological analysis indicated that
73% of Yap residents had been infected with ZIKV, but not a
single hospitalization, hemorrhagic manifestation, or death were
reported during the outbreak (Duffy et al., 2009).
After detection of the first case of ZIKV infection in the French
Polynesia in October 2013, during the following outbreak, up to
an estimated 11% of population was affected (Cao-Lormeau et al.,
2014; Musso et al., 2014b). Most of the clinical cases presented
low fever, asthenia, wrist and fingers arthralgia, headache, rash,
and only one patient presented Guillain–
Barre syndrome (GBS)
7 days after laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection. It is
noteworthy to remark that, after this outbreak, the incidence of
GBS in French Polynesia increased 20-fold (Oehler et al., 2014).
The reasons for this increase are not known yet. Analyses of the
circulating virus have shown that it was genetically closely related
to the 2007 Yap and the 2010 Camboya strains, which were not
associated to a noticeable number of GBS cases.
Following the French Polynesia outbreak in late 2013,
subsequent outbreaks occurred in New Caledonia, Eastern
Island, and the Cook Islands. In New Caledonia, the first cases
of ZIKV infection were imported from French Polynesia in
November 2013, and, subsequently, in January 2014, the first
autochthonous case was documented, driving the New Caledonia
Health Authority to declare an outbreak situation in February
2014. Up to 1385 laboratory confirmed cases were reported
(Dupont-Rouzeyrol et al., 2015). The outbreak in Eastern Island
also started in January 2014, accounting for 51 confirmed cases
(Tognarelli et al., 2016).
In Australia, the first case of ZIKV infection was notified
in 2012 in a traveler returning from Indonesia (Kwong et al.,
2013). Since then, all cases have been imported from countries
affected by the virus. Nonetheless, as A. aegypti, the main ZIKV
vector, is present mainly in areas of North Queensland, this
region is at risk of an eventual local transmission of ZIKV from
infected returning travelers12. A few imported cases have been
confirmed in New Zealand too, but as the mosquito vectors
are not commonly found in these territories, the risk of local
transmission is so far low13.
In the past 9 months, Fiji, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Solomon
Islands, Marshall Islands, American Samoa, Samoa, and Tonga
(Figure 5) have reported autochthonous cases8,9 but only the
latter three have ongoing outbreaks14.
America
At the beginning of 2015, first autochthonous transmission of
ZIKV in Brazil was reported and, since then, the virus has rapidly

ever-zika-chikungunya#.VsLrOyuG-WM
14http://smartraveller.gov.au/bulletins/zika_virus
spread throughout the Americas (Zanluca et al., 2015). The
Brazilian Ministry of Health estimates that between 440 000 to
1 300 000 cases of ZIKV infections may have occurred in 2015 in
the country15.
Since the initial report in Brazil, during the last 9 months, and
as a 18th of February 2016, 29 countries, or territories, of America
have also reported autochthonous cases of ZIKV infection:
Aruba, Barbados, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Curaç
ao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French
Guyana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,
Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay,
Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, Trinidad y Tobago,
Venezuela, and Virgin Islands8 (Figure 5). Because the epidemic
is still spreading in the Americas, it is reasonable to think that
more countries will report autochthonous ZIKV infections in the
coming months.
Despite outbreaks have occurred mainly in Caribbean
countries/territories and central and south America, imported
confirmed cases are starting to show in North America: USA
and Canada (Figure 5). As of today, 82 and 3 imported cases
have been reported in these countries, respectively16,17. Although
the risk of ZIKV establishment in Canada and northern USA is
low because of the absence of the vectors, it cannot be discarded
that the virus persists and spreads in these regions causing
autochthonous infected human cases, as it has happened with
other related flaviviruses like WNV (Martin-Acebes and Saiz,
2012).
Europe
Nowadays, there is no evidence of autochthonous ZIKV infection
in Europe. All reported cases were imported from people
returning from affected countries. The first laboratory confirmed
case was notified in November 2013 in Germany (Tappe
et al., 2014). Since then, from 2015, imported cases have been
documented in Norway (Waehre et al., 2014), Italy (Zammarchi
et al., 2015), and Germany (Tappe et al., 2015). However, after
the recent explosive expansion of the virus in the Americas,
many European countries have reported imported cases of ZIKV
infection in travelers returning home (Figure 5), including
Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland,
and UK18.
As commented above, currently only A. albopictus has
colonized Europe, mainly the Mediterranean area (Medlock
et al., 2012; Kraemer et al., 2015). Since A. aegypti is the main
responsible of the current transmission of ZIKV in other regions
of the world, the actual risk of a ZIKV outbreak in Europe
seems to be low. Nonetheless, beside the possible reintroduction
of A. aegypti in the continent, A. albopticus is circulating in
the southern regions of the continent and, since this species

can also efficiently transmit the virus, surveillance programs
should be implemented, mainly during warm seasons. In fact,
autochthonous DENV and CHIKV infections in France (La
Ruche et al., 2010; Delisle et al., 2015), Croatia (Gjenero-Margan
et al., 2011), and Italy (Rezza et al., 2007) have already been
documented.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND
PATHOGENY
Humans
Zika virus infection has been reported to be symptomatic
only in around 18% of the cases (Duffy et al., 2009), in
which it causes a mild, self-limiting disease with an incubation
period of up to 10 days, often mistaken with other arboviral
infections like dengue or chikungunya. Clinical manifestations in
symptomatic cases resemble that of an influenza-like syndrome
(Macnamara, 1954), being the most common symptoms fever,
rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis; with headache, vomiting,
edema, and jaundice being reported less frequently (Zammarchi
et al., 2015). Digestive complications (abdominal pain, diarrhea,
and constipation), mucous membrane ulcerations (aphthae),
and pruritus are rarely observed. The symptoms usually
resolve spontaneously after 3–
7 days, but arthralgia may persist
for up to 1 month (Foy et al., 2011). A post-infection
asthenia seems to be also frequent. In any case, severe
disease requiring hospitalization has been uncommon until
now.
First description of clinical manifestations were reported in
1954 by Macnamara (Macnamara, 1954). In 1956, Bearcroft
described the symptoms in an experimentally infected human
volunteer (Bearcroft, 1956). A slight generalized headache and
a rise in temperature started at the 3rd day, increasing during
day 5. By day 7 the patient felt well and the temperature
had fallen to normal. Jaundice did not develop, and no
other evidence of hepatic dysfunction was found. The total
white blood cells during the first 12 days after inoculation
did not differ greatly from pre-inoculation counts. Urine
estimations were consistently negative for bile pigments and
albumin during this period. Estimations of total serum bilirubin
carried out between the time of inoculation and the 17th day
showed normal levels, and the site of inoculation appeared
healthy.
In 1964, Simpson described his own acquired ZIKV illness
while working with ZIKV strains isolated from A. africanus
collected during 1962–
1963 (Simpson, 1964). The illness began
with a slight frontal headache, showing no other symptoms
at the time. During the 2nd day he presented a diffuse pink
maculopapular rash which covered the face, neck, trunk, and
upper arms that spread gradually to involve all four limbs,
and felt slight aching sensations in his back and thighs.
Oral temperature at this time was normal in the morning,
however he was slightly febrile throughout the day. The
temperature returned to normal by the end of the day,
and he felt much better, apart from a slight headache. The
rash persisted to day 5, when it was fading until completely
disappear. No other signs or symptoms were noted during the
illness.
Information on laboratory tested alterations associated with
ZIKV infection are limited, but may include transient leucopenia,
with (Kutsuna et al., 2014) or without thrombocytopenia (Kwong
et al., 2013), and slight elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase,
gamma-glutamyl transferase, and of inflammatory parameters
(C– reactive protein, fibrinogen and ferritin) (Tappe et al.,
2014). Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations may or may not be
elevated.
Guillain–Barre Syndrome (GBS)
An association of ZIKV infection with more severe disease
outcomes, such as GBS has been also proposed. GBS is an
autoimmune disease causing acute or subacute flaccid paralysis
that can even cause death (van den Berg et al., 2013; Dominguez-
Moreno et al., 2014), and that it has been previously associated
with other flaviviral infections (Puccioni-Sohler et al., 2012).
Remarkably, as aforementioned, during ZIKV outbreak reported
in French Polynesia the incidence rate of GBS cases was
approximately 20-fold higher than expected given the size of
the French Polynesia population and its previously established
incidence (1–
2/100 000 population per year) (Oehler et al., 2014).
Likewise, in Colombia, during the ongoing outbreak, 86 cases of
GBS have been associated to ZIKV infection19. Based on the 600
000 expected Zika infections in the country, up to 1000 cases
of GBS could be anticipated. These data point to a worrisome
increase in the potential clinical severity of the disease (Roth et al.,
2014).
Microcephaly
Similarly to GBS, even more disturbing is the astonishing
rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and
neurological disorders that have been suggested to be associated
with the current ZIKV outbreak in Brazil (Schuler-Faccini
et al., 2016). These congenital infections presumably due to
ZIKV exposure have been also associated with an increase in
vision-threatening findings, which include bilateral macular and
perimacular lesions, as well as optic nerve abnormalities in most
cases (de Paula Freitas et al., 2016; Ventura et al., 2016a,b). By
the end of 2015, Brazil’
s Health Ministry reported an unusual
spike in reported cases of microcephaly in the northeastern state
of Pernambuco, where the affected children’
s mothers had been
in early pregnancy at around the same time as large ZIKV
outbreaks occurred. The Ministry subsequently raised the alarm
of a possible link to ZIKV. Although most cases have been
described in Pernambuco, they have also been diagnosed in other
eight Brazilian states so far (Oliveira Melo et al., 2016). However,
it should be noted that neighboring Colombia has reported over
5000 cases of ZIKV in pregnant women and so far, only one
documented case of microcephaly in a newborn, and other two
with other congenital brain abnormalities have been very recently
documented (Butler, 2016).

Saiz et al.
Zika Virus
In any case, this possible association of microcephaly with
ZIKV is still a matter of controversy among researchers.
The
Latin
American
Collaborative
Study
of
Congenital
Malformations (ECLAMC) suggested that the rise in reported
cases of microcephaly might largely be attributable to the intense
search for cases of the birth defect, and to misdiagnoses, that
arose from heightened awareness in the wake of the possible
link with ZIKV. However, it should be noted that a successful
RT-PCR amplification of the complete ZIKV genome from a fetal
brain tissue has been recently described (Mlakar et al., 2016). In
this line, an expectant mother presented a febrile illness with rash
at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy while she was living
in Brazil. Ultrasonography performed at 29 weeks of gestation
revealed microcephaly with calcifications in the fetal brain
and placenta. After the mother requested termination of the
pregnancy, the fetal autopsy revealed microcephaly, with almost
complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and multifocal dystrophic
calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with
associated cortical displacement and mild focal inflammation.
Electron microscopy analysis also revealed spherical virus
particles with morphologic characteristics consistent with ZIKV.
Likewise, very recently, the ZIKV genome has been detected and
sequenced form amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women
whose fetuses where diagnosed with microcephaly, (Calvet et al.,
2016).
The apparent risk of microcephaly was enough for the
World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health
emergency of international concern on February 1 (Rubin et al.,
2016) that has lately been integrated into risk assessments by
the ECDC4. Therefore, the most important current milestone
in ZIKV investigations is to clearly elucidate the possible
relationship of the infection with the development of serious
neurological disorders.
Animal Models
The pathogenicity of ZIKV has been also evaluated in several
animal models. Among these, the most widely used has been
the mouse model. Moreover, initial isolation of ZIKV was
performed by intracerebral inoculation of viral samples into
mice (Dick, 1952). On these initial experiments, infectious
virus was only recovered from infected brain mice, whereas
no infectious virus able to replicate when inoculated in other
mice was recovered from non-nervous tissues such as kidney,
lung, liver, or spleens, highlighting the marked neurotropism
of ZIKV. Infected mice displayed detectable signs of infection
about 5–
6 days post-infection, time at which virus titers peaked
(Dick, 1952). The analysis of the pathological changes observed
in ZIKV-infected mice brains revealed various stages of cellular
infiltration and degeneration that were also found in the spinal
cords. Degeneration of nerve cells, especially in the region of
the hippocampus, resulted in an early and marked enlargement
of astroglial cells with patchy destruction of the pyriform cells
of Ammon’
s horn (Weinbren and Williams, 1958; Bell et al.,
1971). Microscopy analysis confirmed that the virus replicates in
both neurons and astrogial cells (Weinbren and Williams, 1958;
Bell et al., 1971). Remarkably, while mice of all ages tested were
susceptible to intracerebral inoculations, mice of 2 week of age
and over could rarely be infected by the intraperitoneal route. In
contrast, mice younger than 2 weeks were highly susceptible to
intraperitoneal inoculation of the virus (Dick, 1952). This finding
is similar to that reported for other flaviviruses, such as Usutu
virus (Blazquez et al., 2015). ZIKV-induced pathological changes
are confined to the central nervous system in older animals,
but myocarditis (and associated pulmonary oedema) and skeletal
myositis can be also found in young (1–
5 days old) animals
infected with ZIKV (Weinbren and Williams, 1958). However, it
has to be considered that only non-mouse-adapted strain of ZIKV
seems to induce myocarditis (Weinbren and Williams, 1958).
Besides mice, the susceptibility to ZIKV has been also evaluated
in other non-primate small animal models, demonstrating that
cotton-rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits did not show clinical signs of
infection after intracerebral inoculation of a late passage mouse
brain virus. Nevertheless, inoculation of low passage ZIKV in
guinea pigs resulted in death at 6 days post-infection (Dick, 1952).
The pathogenicity of ZIKV in monkeys seems to be also
mild, except from the sentinel Rhesus 766 from which ZIKV
was initially isolated that exhibited a slight pyrexia (Dick
et al., 1952). Experimentally infected monkeys developed an
unapparent infection after subcutaneous inoculation with mouse
recovered ZIKV. Only one of five monkeys tested showed a
mild pyrexia after intracerebral inoculation, whereas the others
showed no signs of infection (Dick, 1952). In any case, it should
be noted that all infected monkeys showed viremia during the 1st
week after inoculation, as well as induction of specific antibodies
about 14 days post-inoculation (Dick, 1952). This induction of
viremia in monkeys is supposed to play an essential role for
the establishment of the enzootic transmission cycle between
non-human primates and mosquitoes.
DIAGNOSIS
Different
arboviral
infections
can
have
similar
clinical
presentations and, thus, their circulation may be underreported
if specific diagnostic tools have not been implemented. In the
case of ZIKV, diagnosis presents several drawbacks; there is no
“
gold standard”diagnosis tool, antibodies are frequently cross-
reactive between flaviviruses, which limits the use of serology,
viral culture is not routinely performed, and, so far, there is
no antigenic detection test available (Musso et al., 2015a). At
present, the diagnosis of ZIKV infection is mainly made through
“
in house”molecular (RT-PCR) and serologic [Ig M ELISA and
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)] assays, as only very
recently molecular commercial tests for ZIKV have been made
available20,21 .
Antibody
An IgM ELISA was developed at the Arboviral Diagnostic
and Reference Laboratory of the CDC to detect ZIKV using
samples from Yap Island outbreak (Lanciotti et al., 2008). IgM

Zika Virus
was detectable as early as 3 days after onset of illness, but
cross-reaction with other flaviviruses was observed. This cross-
reactivity of sera from convalescent-phase patients was more
frequent in those from patients with evidence of previous
flavivirus infections than among those with apparent primary
ZIKV infections, mainly in the case of previous DENV infection
(Lanciotti et al., 2008; Duffy et al., 2009). This IgM cross-
reactivity has been further corroborated (Zammarchi et al., 2015;
Shinohara et al., 2016), so, as in many other flaviviral infections,
ELISA positive results should be confirmed, either by testing
an acute-phase serum sample collected as early as possible after
onset of illness and a second sample collected 2–
3 weeks later, or
by additional assays, such as PRNT, that have to result in at least
a fourfold increase in ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers when
compared with that of the other viruses tested22.
Recently, a report analyzing the presence of IgG against
different flaviviruses among blood donors in French Polynesia,
based on the use of recombinant antigens comprising the domain
III of the envelope protein of each virus strain, claimed to
differentiate between them, as an overall seropositivity rates of
80.3% for at least one DENV serotype, 0.8% for ZIKV, 1.3% for
JEV, and 1.5% for WNV were recorded (Aubry et al., 2015). In any
case, it should be noticed that ELISA cross-reactivity can also be
the result of co-infections with more than one flavivirus that co-
circulate in the same regions, as recently reported for two cases
(Dupont-Rouzeyrol et al., 2015).
Nucleic Acid
The diagnosis of ZIKV is at present primarily based on the
detection of viral RNA from specimens by means of RT-PCR
(Faye et al., 2008; Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014; Grard et al., 2014;
Musso et al., 2015a; Zammarchi et al., 2015; Marcondes and
Ximenes, 2016; Shinohara et al., 2016). However, as the viremic
period is short, direct virus detection should be performed
in samples took during the first 3–
5 days after the onset of
symptoms (Balm et al., 2012).
A specific ZIKV nucleic acid test (NAT) was implemented
in routine practice during the French Polynesian outbreak
(Musso et al., 2014a) on the basis of protocols implemented to
prevent WNV transmission by transfusion in North America.
Additional NATs have been developed based on specific Asian
and African ZIKV strains targeting either the envelope or the
NS5 regions (Duffy et al., 2009; Faye et al., 2013). Likewise, a
one-step RT-PCR assay to detect ZIKV in human serum has
also been developed (Faye et al., 2008). The assay showed to
be rapid, sensitive, and specific to detect ZIKV in cell culture
or serum. Nevertheless, since experimentally infected samples
were used, it needs to be validated for diagnosis using clinical
samples.
All these NATs have several limitations. Because of its
nucleotide sequence specificity, NAT cannot be used to screen a
wide range of pathogens with one run, being necessary the use
of multiple assays if several pathogens are co-circulating in the
same area, but multiple testing is expensive and time-consuming
(Aubry et al., 2016), and it does not detect all infected blood
22http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e3.htm
donations, especially when nucleic acid loads are low and when
sera are tested in large pools (Musso et al., 2015a). Therefore, use
of alternative source of samples has been proposed. In this sense,
the suitability of urine samples for diagnosing ZIKV infection has
been recently confirmed, as RNA of the virus is detectable in urine
at a higher load and with a longer duration than in serum (10 to
>20 days, and >7 days once it become undetectable in serum)
(Gourinat et al., 2015; Shinohara et al., 2016). Saliva has also been
used as an alternative sample for routine ZIKV RNA detection,
showing positivity more frequently than blood samples, but it
did not increase the window of detection in contrast to what
was reported for urine. Since ZIKV RNA detection was found
negative in some saliva samples while positive in blood, saliva
cannot replace blood samples, but just help on detection (Musso
et al., 2015a). As a result of these data, it has been suggested to
collect both blood and saliva samples to increase the sensitivity
of molecular detection of viral RNA for Zika fever diagnosis in
acute phase. On the other hand, urine sample can be associated
at the late stages of the disease. Thus, when detection of ZIKV
is of particular importance, using a combination of samples
(blood/saliva/urine) is recommended (Musso et al., 2015a).
PROPHYLAXIS
Currently there are no specific antiviral agents, vaccine, or
prophylaxis for ZIKV. Treatment is generally directed to
symptom relief with analgesics and anti-pyretics. Therefore,
developing an effective, safe, and affordable ZIKV vaccine, and
search for antiviral effective compounds for disease treatment is
a current challenge for Zika disease.
Vaccines for various flaviviruses have been produced during
the past years, some of them being already in the market,
such as those for YFV or WNV (Dauphin and Zientara,
2007; Ulbert and Magnusson, 2014; Monath and Vasconcelos,
2015). These vaccines have been produced using different
strategies, inactivated or live-attenuated viruses, recombinant
proteins or peptides expressed in different heterologous systems,
recombinant subviral particles, chimeric backbone viruses, or
naked cDNA (Ishikawa et al., 2014). Thus, it seems reasonable
to think that similar strategies can be applied to ZIKV. For
instances, a DNA based vaccine (SynCon, Phamaceutical, U.S.)
has been recently produced, which it is expected to go into Phase
I trials before the end of 2016. In addition, a global patent of two
vaccine candidates (a recombinant vaccine and an inactivated
vaccine) for ZIKV has been just filled (Bharat Biotech, India).
Developing effective specific therapies for ZIKV seems much
more difficult, as so far, and despite several attempts have been
made in the past years, none of such compounds are available
against any flaviviral infection (Apte-Sengupta et al., 2014). Along
with drugs, antibody mediated protection against ZIKV should
also be addressed, as in other flaviviral infections (YF, WN,
or dengue) experimental specific antibodies treatment has been
some time successful (Roehrig et al., 2001; Ben-Nathan et al.,
2003; Engle and Diamond, 2003).
Nevertheless, and despite the great effort that probably will
be made within the scientific community in the coming years, it

Zika Virus
will take time until any drugs or vaccines against ZIKV will be
commercially available.
Public Health and Preventive Measures
As previously detailed, ZIKV infection generally causes a non-
severe disease (Zammarchi et al., 2015), but some areas newly
affected by the virus are providing worrisome information
on the already mentioned potential association of neonatal
malformations (microcephaly) and GBS with ZIKV (Oehler et al.,
2014; Mlakar et al., 2016; Tetro, 2016). As a consequence, and
in the absence of another explanation for these connections,
the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern on the 1st of February of 201623, highlighting the
importance of enhance the measures to reduce the ZIKV
infection, particularly among pregnant women and women of
childbearing age. In this way, as previously remarked, additional
investigations are absolutely necessary to determine whether
there is a casual link between ZIKV and microcephaly and GBS.
Currently, no vaccine or treatment exists to prevent ZIKV
disease, although more probably several vaccine prototypes
will be obtained soon. Thus, to facilitate the surveillance and
control measures, research and development efforts should be
intensified for ZIKV vaccines, therapeutics, and improved new
diagnostics23, especially if the connection between ZIKV and
microcephaly is confirmed.
In the meantime, prevention, and control of ZIKV infection
are mainly focused on avoiding the bites of carrying mosquitoes
responsible for disease transmission. These measures are
the same as those recommended to prevent other diseases
transmitted by mosquitoes bite (Martin-Acebes and Saiz,
2012), and include the use of insect repellent, wearing long-
sleeved shirts and long pants, the elimination of standing
water where mosquitoes can lay eggs, the minimization of
outdoor activities coincident with the maximum activity of
mosquitoes, the installation of window and door screens, and
the implementation of accurate mosquito control programs24.
ECDC and CDC recommend those pregnant women and those
who are trying to get pregnant consider not travel to areas
affected by the virus24,25. Furthermore, some American countries,
including Colombia26, Honduras27, Ecuador28, El Salvador29, and
Jamaica30 have recommended delay pregnancy during the ZIKV
outbreak.

On the other hand, in territories where autochthonous ZIKV
infection has not yet been detected, but potential vectors are
present, the public health institutions should have a quick
response to prevent local transmission when an imported case
is confirmed. In this context, WHO called for health authorities
to collaborate with the transport sector to ensure disinfection of
aircraft from affected areas23.
As described before, a few cases of sexual transmission of
ZIKV has been reported (Musso et al., 2015b; McCarthy, 2016).
Even though further studies are needed to confirm the actual
sexual risk of ZIKV transmission, the CDC recommend the
proper use of preventive measures, such as condoms, if having
sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with a male partner while traveling, or
if he has just comeback from an area where the virus is actively
circulating; even more, in this latter case, sexual abstinence is
recommended if the partner is pregnant31.
Likewise, and since spread of the virus through blood
transfusion has been reported (Musso et al., 2014a), the countries
affected by the virus should take measures to prevent this way
of infection (Marano et al., 2016). Moreover, in territories free of
ZIKV, people returning from affected areas should delay blood
donations32.
The rapid spread of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas, with
the suspected neonatal malformations associated, is being cause
for alarm and the mass media are even questioning if the 2016
Olympic Games in Rio should be delayed or even canceled.
In fact, the Brazilian authorities are performing intense vector
control programs to eliminate mosquito vector that transmit
ZIKV and other arboviruses (Petersen et al., 2016).
FINAL REMARKS
After the discovery of ZIKV in 1947, several investigations
were performed during the 1950s and 1960s to characterize
the new pathogen but, since then, little more was done until
the spread of the virus to the Micronesia in 2007. After that,
with the explosive invasion of the Americas in 2015, and the
possible association of ZIKV with severe neurological diseases,
these investigations have significantly increased, and it should
be expected that much more information regarding the biology
and the clinical consequences of ZIKV infection will be available
soon. Several issues have to be resolved. For instance, most of
the virus molecular biology and the virus-host cell interactions
have been inferred from other related flaviviruses, and, thus,
they should be specifically analyzed. Likewise, the elucidation of
the presence of determinants of virulence/pathogenicity, and the
role that protein glycosylations can play on it will be of much
interest. On the other hand, the role of humans in the spread
of ZIKV, and whether vertical and sexual transmission routes are
important factors for human-to-human spread also need to be
clearly determined. No least is the improvement of more accurate
diagnostic tools, the development of vaccines, and the design
of antiviral therapies. Finally, without any doubt, currently the
most important and pressing issue is to reveal whether ZIKV
