Somatic mutations in human cancers show unevenness in genomic distribution that correlate
with aspects of genome structure and function. These mutations are, however, generated by
multiple mutational processes operating through the cellular lineage between the fertilized egg
and the cancer cell, each composed of specific DNA damage and repair components and leaving
its own characteristic mutational signature on the genome. Using somatic mutation catalogues
from 560 breast cancer whole-genome sequences, here we show that each of 12 base
substitution, 2 insertion/deletion (indel) and 6 rearrangement mutational signatures present in
breast tissue, exhibit distinct relationships with genomic features relating to transcription, DNA
replication and chromatin organization. This signature-based approach permits visualization of
the genomic distribution of mutational processes associated with APOBEC enzymes, mismatch
repair deficiency and homologous recombinational repair deficiency, as well as mutational
processes of unknown aetiology. Furthermore, it highlights mechanistic insights including a
putative replication-dependent mechanism of APOBEC-related mutagenesis.

orrelations between the density of somatic mutations and
various features of genomic structure and function have
customarily been performed on aggregated cancer muta-
tions across many cancer types1–9. These reports show similar
general conclusions, for example, that substitution mutations are
enriched in genomic regions that undergo replication late while
rearrangements are enriched in early replicating regions1–9 or
that specific genomic landmarks like chromatin organization are
variably associated with mutation distribution9,10.
The interpretation of these historic analyses is, however,
complicated, because somatic mutations do not arise from a
single, universal mutagenic process. They occur due to numerous
mutational processes that have occurred throughout the lifetime
of the cancer patient11–14 and may be distinct in different tissues.
Consider analyses based on simple substitution classes across
multiple cancers. C4T transitions, for example, could arise from
disparate
mutational
processes
including
deamination
of
methylated
cytosines,
deamination
by
APOBEC
cytidine
deaminases, exposure to ultraviolet irradiation or mismatch
repair (MMR) deficiency. The interpretation of how C4T
mutations are distributed relative to any genomic landmark
would thus be limited by the complexity of mutational processes
that contribute to C4T mutations.
In addition, previous analyses commonly combined data across
several cancer types with diverse tissues of origin. However,
exposures to DNA-damaging agents are likely to be different
between tissues (for example, ultraviolet damage occurs in skin
but not colorectal tissue) and DNA repair pathways may behave
differently in cells of different organs. Moreover, replicative,
transcriptional and chromatin dynamics may be distinct from
one tissue to another, further hampering interpretation of such
aggregated somatic mutation data10.
Each mutational process will leave its own specific pattern
on the genome or mutational signature11 regardless of whether
it
arose
as
a
pre-neoplastic
process
or
post-malignant
transformation. Recent advances in the mathematical extraction
of mutational signatures14 from cancer sequences have led to the
discovery
of
21
such
signatures
in
30
different
cancer
types14. In a recent article of 560 highly curated whole-genome
sequenced (WGS) breast cancers15, we extracted 12 base
substitution
mutational
signatures
from
3,479,652
base
substitutions (signatures 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 17, 18, 20, 26 and
30). These signatures were based on a 96-mutation classification
that incorporates the base substitution type (expressed as the
pyrimidine of a mutated Watson–Crick base pair, C4A, C4G,
C4T, T4A, T4C, T4G) and the immediate flanking sequence
context of the mutated base (four possible 50 and four possible 30
bases)11,14. We also analysed 77,695 rearrangements that were
classified according to rearrangement type (deletions, tandem
duplications, inversions and translocations), size (range 1 kilobase
to 41 Mb) and whether they were focal or genomically dispersed,
to extract six novel rearrangement signatures (RS1–RS6)15. These
had different predominating features including being mainly
characterized by tandem duplications (RS1 and RS3), deletions
(RS5), clustered rearrangements (RS2, RS4) or translocations
(RS2). In addition, 371,993 indels were categorized into two
distinct signatures. ‘Repeat-mediated’ deletions share the identical
motif as a flanking polynucleotide repeat tract, are small (o3 bp)
and arise from erroneous repair of insertion–deletion loops at
polynucleotide tracts, the onus of post-replicative MMR16. In
contrast, microhomology-mediated deletions show homology
of
several
nucleotides
between
the
start
of
the
deletion
and the flanking sequence of the deletion junction. They are
usually larger (Z3 bp) than repeat-mediated deletions and are
associated with repair by microhomology-mediated end joining
mechanisms.
The significance of these signatures is clear. They are a proxy
for the biological processes that have gone awry in breast tissue
(see Table 1 for summary of signatures, their characteristics and
putative aetiologies). Some associations include homologous
recombination (HR) repair deficiency with signatures 3 and 8,
microhomology-mediated indels, RS1, RS3 and RS5, putative
activity of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases with
signatures 2 and 13, MMR deficiency with signatures 6, 20 and 26
and an excess of repeat-mediated indels and deamination of
methylated cytosines with signature 1. Aetiologies of the
remaining signatures (signatures 5, 17, 18, 30; RS2, RS4 and
RS6) are currently unknown (Table 1). This set of 560 breast
cancers is the largest cohort of WGS cancers of a single tissue-
type to date providing an exceptional opportunity to gain insights
into mutagenic processes of a specific tissue.
We thus set out to comprehensively explore how mutation
signatures in human breast cancers are influenced by genomic
architecture. Critically, we were able to assign probabilistic
estimates for individual somatic mutations to each mutational
signature for every sample. Thus, by studying the genomic
distribution of mutations as mutational signatures, we are able to
interpret how mutagenic processes in breast tissues are influenced
by cellular activities such as replication, transcription or by
physical features like nucleosome occupancy.
Results
Diverse temporal relationships with replication. DNA replica-
tion begins at origins (or near clusters of origins) of replication
and propagates bidirectionally from each starting point17,18 with
some regions of the genome copied sooner (early replicating)
than others (late replicating)19. Using replication-sequencing
(Repli-Seq)20 data generated from the breast cancer cell line,
MCF-7
(ref.
20),
early-
and
late-replicating
regions
were
determined
(Supplementary
Fig.
1a–b)
and
relationships
between mutations attributed to each signature and replication
time were explored (Fig.1, Supplementary Fig. 1c–e).
Base-substitution signatures 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 17, 18, 20 and 26
showed increases in mutation density from early to late
replication, in keeping with previously described observations
on aggregated substitutions. However, each had a distinctive
gradient (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1c–e) underscoring the
individuality of each signature. In contrast, signature 6, 13 and 30
showed the unexpected tendency of relatively constant mutation
densities through all replication time domains.
All six rearrangement signatures (RS1–RS6) from the 560
breast cancers15 were enriched in early replication. However, the
gradient of change from early to late replication was variable
between them (Fig. 1c). There was an approximately twofold
reduction in rearrangement frequencies between the earliest and
latest replication domains for RS1, RS3, RS4 and RS6. In contrast,
RS2 and RS5 had flatter gradients with a greater proportion of
rearrangements found in late replication domains than the other
rearrangement signatures.
Somatic deletions were generally enriched late in replication.
Repeat-mediated deletions showed a steep gradient with more
mutations in late-replication time domains. Ten cancers with
overwhelming indel mutagenesis (range 2,535–66,764) associated
with MMR deficiency demonstrated a particularly steep gradient.
In contrast, microhomology-mediated deletions demonstrated a
gradual slope of increasing frequency towards late replication
domains (Fig. 1d).
Thus, the signature-based approach permits higher resolution
observations of distinctive variation between different mutational
processes including behaviours different from those found when
all mutations are considered together.

 Direction of replication influences mutational distribution.
Replication fork migration from early to late replicative regions
generates replicative strands that act as templates for DNA
synthesis in a continuous and discontinuous manner, respec-
tively18 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Through knowing the direction
of replication fork migration relative to the p-to-q orientation of
the genome, transition zones could be assigned to p-to-q leading
or p-to-q lagging replicative strands, respectively (Methods
section, Supplementary Fig. 2b–d). We were conservative in our
assignments excluding the first and last 25 kb of the latest
replication domains and discarding regions of 10 kb or less
indicative of where potential replicative strand switches could
have occurred21,22 (Methods section). We thus explored whether
the direction of replication influenced mutational processes
through differences in mutation distribution between replicative
strands (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Fig. 2e–i).
The level of asymmetry between strands is referred to as strand
imbalance. A strand imbalance of 20% implies that one strand has
20% more mutations than the other (for example, for every 100
mutations on one strand, there are 120 on the other). We found
that the level of asymmetry was different between the various base
substitution signatures (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 1). Signa-
tures 2, 13 and 26 exhibited strong replicative strand asymmetries
with imbalances 430% for each of the signatures (P value
o2.2e � 16); signatures 1, 3, 5, 6, 17, 18 and 20 had weaker
asymmetries (P value o2e � 4 and strand imbalance o13%) and
signatures 8, and 30 did not exhibit asymmetries of distribution
between replication strands (P value 40.01 and strand imbalance
o3%). Asymmetric mutation distribution between replicative
strands was thus observed more markedly for a variety of
different biological processes including putative APOBEC-related
mutagenesis
(signatures
2 and 13), and
MMR deficiency

 (signatures 6, 20 and 26—all with different biases), implying that
the direction of travel of a replication fork can influence somatic
mutation accumulation in diverse mutational mechanisms.
APOBEC deamination of cytosine to uracil (C4U) is thought
to initiate mutations of signatures 2 and 13 (refs 11,23–25).
Knowledge of which of the Watson–Crick base pair is targeted by
the
APOBEC
enzyme
enables
insight
into
the
preferred
replicative strand and indicates that APOBEC-related mutagen-
esis occurs at a higher rate on the p-to-q lagging replicative
strand. APOBECs require single-stranded DNA as a substrate for
cytosine deamination26,27 and thus the replication process itself
could provide physiological opportunities for mutagenesis. Why
APOBEC mutagenesis favours the lagging strand is unclear but
could be due to differential availability of single-stranded DNA
between leading and lagging strands for APOBEC deamination.
Subtype heterogeneity in breast cancer and mutation distribution.
A variety of breast cancer subtypes exist and these have been
historically classified according to transcriptomic profiles. We sought
to understand whether typical classifications such as oestrogen
receptor subtype (positive or negative) or putative cell-of-origin

 (basal of luminal A/B) showed differences in the behaviour of
mutational signatures, as this could confound the interpretation of
our analyses. We found that mutational signature relationships to
replication time (Supplementary Fig. 1g–k) and to replication strand
(Supplementary Fig. 2e–i) were highly similar regardless of whether
breast cancers were oestrogen receptor positive or negative or
whether they were basal or luminal. Therefore, heterogeneity of the
main breast cancer subtypes does not appear to influence the
distribution of mutation signatures, suggesting that mutational
processes behave relatively similarly in cells from the same tissue. It

 remains to be seen, however, whether mutational signatures will
differ in their distributions when cancers of different tissue types are
contrasted to one another.
Processive mutagenesis. Previous work28 showed that APOBEC-
related signatures 2 and 13 demonstrated strand-coordinated
mutagenesis where pairs of adjacent mutations of the same
reference allele were observed on the same strand more frequently
than expected28. The underlying reason for this observation is
unknown. Here we extend the strand-coordination analysis to
identify long stretches of 10 or more successive mutations
occurring on the same DNA strand (that is, successive mutations
may be C4TyC4TyC4T or G4AyG4AyG4A but not
C4TyG4AyC4T)28 for all mutation signatures. We found
that long processive groups were features of signatures 2, 13, 6, 26
and 17 and were particularly over-represented in signature 13.
157 such processive groups were identified in 27 breast cancers,

Figure 3 | Relationship between mutational signatures and nucleosome occupancy. The distribution of the signal of nucleosome density (y axis) is shown
in a 2 kb window centred on each mutation (position 0 on the x axis), for each signature. The averaged signal was calculated as the total amount of signal
observed at each point divided by total number of mutations contributing to that signal. (a) Nucleosome density for aggregated substitutions (green), and

 76% of these from signature 13, which also had the longest
processive group containing 19 point mutations (Fig. 2c,
Supplementary Table 2).
The longest processive stretch of mutations covered B1.1 Mb
although most processive stretches were tens to hundreds of
kilobases in length (Supplementary Table 3). This suggests that
mutational processes generating processive mutations can do so
for remarkably long stretches, perhaps suggesting that long
stretches of single-stranded DNA exist in cells and/or that
individual proteins track one of the two DNA strands over long
distances.
Transcriptional strand biases. Base substitutions falling within
the footprint of a gene, corresponding to B40% of the human
genome, were classified according to whether they were on the
‘transcribed’ strand (the non-coding strand), which forms the
template for the primary mRNA transcript, or the ‘non-tran-
scribed’ strand11,29,30 (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Fig. 3).
Base-substitution signatures of breast cancer showed variation
in transcriptional strand asymmetries. Signatures 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 18
and 26 showed some transcriptional strand bias (P value o0.01
and strand imbalance up to 10.7%), while signatures 1, 6, 17, 20
and 30 showed no asymmetrybetween transcriptional strands
(P-value 40.01).
While transcriptional strand bias can result from the involve-
ment of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair that
often acts on large, DNA distorting adducts29, the biases detected
here in breast tissue are novel, and not easily ascribed to known
double-helix distorting agents. These observations imply that
other currently undefined transcription-coupled DNA damage
and/or repair processes may be at play31–33 in breast tissue. The
results also suggest that DNA replication has overall a stronger
effect on the mutational landscape than transcription (Fig. 2a,b,
Supplementary Table 1).
Mutation signatures and nucleosome occupancy. Finally, we
examined how mutations due to different mutational signatures
were distributed relative to nucleosome positions (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Fig. 4). Nucleosomes consist of an octamer of
histone proteins wrapped by B147 bp of ‘core DNA’ and are
separated from the next nucleosome by B60–80 bp of ‘linker
DNA’ sequence18. Reference regions indicating stable nucleosome
occupancy were defined based on MNase experiments performed
on an ENCODE line, K562 (refs 4,34). Variant-to-nucleosome
distances were calculated for each variant in each signature
(Fig. 3a,b). A randomization was performed correcting for
systematic variation in AT/CG content of mutational signatures
and of core and linker DNA regions, and the distribution of

increased availability of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (for example, uncoupling between leading and lagging replicative strands or delays in elongation of
the nascent lagging strand by Okazaki fragments) could occur, exposing ssDNA for APOBEC deamination, potentially for long genomic tracts. 2. Uracil-N-

detrimental replication fork stalling or collapse. 4A The final outcome is stretches of successive C4G transversions at a TpC sequence context

distributions through simulations and distinctly different when
compared with all other signatures. By contrast, signature 26
mutations, associated with MMR deficiency, were more frequent
at linker DNA sequences distant from nucleosomes6,36 (Fig. 3b).
We also observed that repeat-mediated deletions, particularly those
from MMR-deficient cancers were enriched at linker sequences
(Fig. 3a) in keeping with previous reports37. Thus MMR deficiency
increases the likelihood of indels as well as base substitutions
occurring between nucleosomes. Intriguingly, it appears to do so in
only one of the three distinct MMR-associated substitution
signatures. Base-substitution signatures 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 20 and
30 did not exhibit a different distribution to that expected from the
randomization experiment suggesting that nucleosome positioning
does not influence their underlying mutational processes.
Discussion
This signature-based analysis is a novel way of visualizing in vivo
mutagenesis providing a powerful means of revealing the natural
experiments that occur in human cells. We find that different
somatic mutational signatures demonstrate distinct partialities in
replicative and transcriptional strands have variable profiles
across replication time and are differentially influenced by
physical genomic attributes such as nucleosome positioning
(Table 1). The observed profiles are out-of-keeping with the
profiles expected through randomization experiments that correct
for per-sample mutation burden, AT/GC content of each
signature and AT/GC content of the genome.
Reference coordinates for replication-related analyses were
generated from Repli-Seq data for the cell line, MCF-7. Of
publicly available Repli-Seq data sets, this ductal breast carcinoma
cell line was selected because it was most closely related to the
breast cancers in terms of tissue-of-origin. A large proportion of
the earliest (average 59.8%, range 51.7–69%) and latest (average
77.9%, range 52.6–85%) replication domains are shared between
MCF-7 and all other ENCODE cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5),
and analytical comparisons suggest that strong biological signals
such as the replicative strand bias for signatures 2 and 13, remains
convincingly consistent with only minor variation between cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 4). Thus,
although a cell line will never be perfectly representative of what
occurs in vivo in any cancer, MCF-7 appears to be a reasonable
proxy for generating reference coordinates for assessing muta-
tional distribution of breast cancers.
The signature-based analysis enables us to distinguish between
similar mutational processes and provides mechanistic insights. Here
we show that replication may be a source of single-stranded DNA
over relatively long genomic distances, providing the potential for
APOBEC-related deamination damage that initiates signatures 2 and
13. However, mathematical extractions differentiate these signatures
and suggest that signature 2 is composed predominantly of
C4T transitions, while signature 13 comprises mainly C4G
transversions11,14. These differences have been hypothesized to be
due to the subsequent reparative step11,13: it was postulated that
C4G signature 13 transversions were fixed via uracil-N-glycosylase
(UNG)- and REV1-polymerase (REV1)-dependent mechanism in
base excision repair, while C4T signature 2 transitions were formed
by replicative polymerases exerting the ‘A’ rule (the preferential
insertion of adenine opposite non-informative templates such as
abasic sites or uracils38).
Here analyses relating to replication dynamics show that first,
signatures 13 and 2 have distinct replication strand biases,
second, signature 13 has consistently longer processive groups
than signature 2 and third, signature 13 mutations are more
frequent early in replication than signature 2. We postulate that
UNG/REV1-dependent uracil processing generating signature 13
mutations occurs earlier in replication, thus has more time and is
more likely to process successive uracils. By contrast, the
reparative process that generates signature 2 mutations acts on
remaining incompletely processed uracils and/or abasic sites
including those that are left at the end of the replication cycle,
leading to the observed distribution of higher frequencies late in
replication. Thus, we suggest a replication-related model of
APOBEC mutagenesis: although the replication process itself
springs forth opportunities for APOBEC-related DNA damage, it
is possible that the variation in repair across replication time
results in these disparate signatures (Fig. 4).
Signatures 6, 20, 26 and an excess of repeat-mediated indels are
all associated with defective MMR23. They are rare signatures
(only 1.7%) in breast cancers, often found together in the same
breast tumours and are overwhelming when they occur. However,
they exhibit differing relationships with respect to replication time
and direction, transcription and nucleosome occupancy (Table 1).
Intriguingly, only one of the three MMR-related substitution
signatures exhibits a distinctive distribution relative to nucleosome
occupancy, an observation that would not have been appreciable
without this signature-based approach applied to WGS data.
Three of six rearrangement signatures (RS1, RS3 and RS5) are
associated with defects in HR and are enriched early in
replication. Microhomology-mediated indels and substitution
signatures 3 and 8 are also associated with HR defects but are
enriched late in replication. These signatures are often found
together (albeit in differing quantities) in individual patients15
and likely represent compensatory methods of double-strand
break (DSB) repair in the face of defective HR.
Perhaps, back-up recombination-based repair pathways39–42
are more likely to be invoked early in replication because DSBs
encountered early in S-phase are poorly tolerated42–45. In
contrast,
microhomology-mediated
deletions
represent
the
outcome of DSB resolution through microhomology-mediated
end joining mechanisms, reflecting a contingency route for DSBs
that have not been repaired successfully by recombination
strategies44,45 earlier in replication. Likewise, base substitution
signatures 3 and 8 could similarly represent the outcome of back-
up error-prone translesion synthesis activity in HR-deficient
cancers46. Regardless, these different compensatory signatures
exhibit distinctive behaviours across replication time, painting the
physiology of HR deficiency as complex mutagenesis that has an
instantly
recognizable
whole-genome
profile
with
potential
clinical relevance15.
To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first systematic
signature-based characterization of the genomic distribution of all
classes of somatic mutations in human cancer. The power provided
by large numbers of WGSs of a single cancer type affords a higher
resolution perspective on the topography of biological processes
underlying mutagenesis in breast tissue. We emphasized how
detailed analyses help showcase the mechanistic contribution of
replication dynamics to specific mutational processes (for example,
APOBEC-related signatures 2 and 13). We also highlighted how
multiple forms of DNA repair have an impact on mutation
distribution leaving complex but distinctive global genomic
profiles. Finally, the signature-based genomic variation seen here
drives home a fundamental point regarding genomic analyses
forthwith: statistical models involving mutability cannot assume
uniform genomic mutation rates and must consider signature-
dependent variation as a factor in all future analyses.

 Methods
Data set. All short-read sequencing data were aligned on the GRCh37/hg19
assembly15 and somatic substitutions, indels and rearrangements called and
curated as previously described15. High-quality mutation calls were parsed through
non-negative matrix factorization11,12,14,47 to extract mutation signatures. In all,
twelve base substitution signatures and six rearrangement signatures were
identified15. Indels were classified according to the properties of the breakpoint
junctions into two signatures. Insights into mechanisms generating deletions
are more certain than that of insertions, thus our analyses were restricted to
deletions.
The non-negative matrix factorization-based mutational signatures analysis
revealed the substitution signatures of 12 mutational processes operative in breast
cancer15. Furthermore, the analysis provided the number of somatic mutations
assigned to each of these 12 signatures in each of the examined breast cancers
(exposures). Using the patterns of the extracted mutational signatures and their
contributions in each sample, we were able to assign an a posteriori probability for
any individual substitution to be generated by any of the 12 mutational signatures
in a given sample. The posterior probability for a given substitution with a
trinucleotide context, k, to be generated by the mutational signature n in the
sample g, (Wkng), was computed as the exposure of this sample to the signature n
(eng), multiplied by the probability of the signature n to generate this particular
mutation with trinucleotide context k (pkn). The a posteriori probabilities were
then normalized to sum to 1 by using the number of mutations observed in the
sample gðzgÞ: Wk
ng ¼ 1=zg � ðen
g � pk
nÞ.
Different methodologies were considered to associate the substitutions with the
mutational processes that generated them: (i) maximum likelihood (the signature
associated with each mutation was the one having the highest probability), (ii)
maximum likelihood with probability threshold (same of maximum likelihood but
here signatures with an a posteriori probability lower or equal to 0.5 were filtered
out), (iii) belief propagation (the a posteriori probabilities Wkng were propagated in
the downstream analyses).
We used the maximum likelihood approach to perform the analyses described
in the main manuscript. This choice was motivated by the fact that this approach
could be consistently applied to all downstream analyses and could be used to
perform statistical tests. For example, belief propagation could not be used for the
analysis of processive groups and it was not suitable for statistical tests requiring
integer values. In addition, the thresholding method tended to result in reduced
power. Regardless, the strong biological signals from analyses of particular
signatures such as signatures 2 and 13 were robust and reproducible across all three
approaches (to compare the different methodologies, please see results from the
thresholding and belief propagation approach in Supplementary Fig. 6).
Replication analyses. Reference coordinates for replication landmarks
were inferred from Repli-seq data obtained from the ENCODE project48
(https://www.encodeproject.org/). Cell lines were first isolated into six cell cycle
fractions of newly replicated DNA (G1/G1b, S1, S2, S3, S4 and G2) and each
fraction was sequenced. To visualize genome-wide replication patterns as a
continuous function, percentage-normalization of sequencing tags was followed
by a wavelet-smoothed transformation.
The majority of origins do not fire as a part of a clear, deterministic programme,
instead origin firing occurs both individually and as clusters49–51. Replication
domains were defined using Repli-seq signal: peaks (local maxima) in the
smoothened profile correspond to replication initiation zones, while valleys (local
minima) correspond to replication termination zones48. Replication time domains
were modelled on conservatively defined transition zones in DNA replication time
data. Repli-seq data were split into deciles with each segment containing exactly
10% of the observed signal. AT/CG content of the deciles were variable
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), and the genome-wide distribution of the deciles was
heterogeneous (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
All analyses related to replication time domains were corrected for genomic
size. In particular, in each decile a mutation density was computed as the total
mutation count in each decile divided by the number of attributable bases
(excluding ‘N’s) contained in the relevant decile. In order for gradients to be
comparable between signatures (given the variation in mutation rate between
signatures), counts were then normalized to between 0 and 1. Results of analyses
with absolute counts can also be found in Supplementary Fig. 1c–e.
Finite difference approximations of second and first derivatives were used to
identify Repli-seq signal local maxima (f 00(x)o0) and local minima (f 00(x)40)
corresponding to potential origin firing sites, and then to distinguish between
leading (f 0(x)o0) and lagging (f 0(x)40) strand, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 2a–b). Derivative functions were defined in agreement with p and q arm
chromosome orientation. We named the replication strand as p2q leading and p2q
lagging. To remain conservative in downstream assignments52,53, we removed the
last 25 kb of the latest zones of the replicating domains. We focused on long
transitions between early and late replicative domains, discarding ambiguous mini-
peaks or valleys that were o10 kb in length. It was possible to assign replication
domains in 2,414,428,423 bp of the genome. The median length of assigned
replication strand was 136,001 bp and the mean length was 196,907 bp, safely and
conservatively within the limits described by recent alternative methods, including
DNA combing54. Derived p2q leading and p2q lagging strands were comparable in
genomic footprint, AT/CG content and in amount of transcribed/non-transcribed
regions (Supplementary Fig. 2c–d).
To investigate asymmetry relative to replication strands, all base substitutions
were first described in the pyrimidine context and then orientated with respect to
the relevant strand.
Choice of reference cell line for mutational distribution. Replication time-
related coordinates for the main analyses reported in the manuscript were gener-
ated from MCF-7 cell line. This choice was motivated by the fact that this is a
ductal breast carcinoma cell line and most closely represented our data set of breast
cancers. Note that across the 14 cell lines available from ENCODE, on average
59.8% of the earliest replication time domain is shared between MCF-7 and each of
the other cell lines (range 51.7–69%), and average 77.9% of the latest replication
time domain (range 52.6–85%; Supplementary Fig. 5a). In other words, large
swathes of the earliest and latest replication time domains are identical between
MCF-7 and other cell lines.
To further contrast the cell lines to identify the most appropriate source of
reference coordinates for our analyses, we analysed the mutation density trend
across the cell cycle for all cell lines where data were available from ENCODE. Cell
lines showing a consistent increase of aggregated mutation density going from early
to late replicative regions, should be preferred over the cell lines that exhibited a
random trend. For each cell line, we extracted replication time deciles and counted
the number of mutations falling in each of these domains. These counts were then
corrected for the genomic size of each domain. In this way, we obtained the
mutation density mij for each decile (i represents the i-th cell line, and j ¼ 1,2,..,10
the decile with 1 and 10 being the earliest and the latest decile, respectively). The
mutation densities were ordered across replication time (½mi
1; mi
2; mi
3; :::; mi
10�) to
capture the overall trend of mutation accumulating across the cell cycle. Pearson’s
correlations were separately applied to assess the relationship between the
distribution of mutations across replication time domains (expecting an increasing
trend progressing through to late replication). The Pearson’s test showed low P
values for strong correlations across replication time. On the contrary, less-
significant P values were observed for distributions that were poorly correlated and
showed more randomly distributed mutations across replication time domains.
Results of this comparison are showed in Supplementary Fig. 1f.
Transcriptional strand characterization. The nucleotide sequence of the primary
mRNA transcript is identical to the sense/non-template/non-transcribed strand
except that U replaces T, and is complementary to that of the anti-sense/template/
transcribed strand (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
All mutations were called on the þ strand of the reference genome, were
placed into the ‘pyrimidine’ context and noted if so. Transcriptional strand
was assigned for each pyrimidine-based mutation (Supplementary Fig. 3b for
explanation of orientation). Regions of the genome with protein coding genes were
used to assign transcriptional strands. On the total of 20,305 protein coding genes,
10,301 (677,912,252 bp) were on the þ strand and 10,004 (646,112,188 bp) were
on the � strand, respectively.
Computing replication and transcription strand ratios. All base substitution
mutations were described in the pyrimidine context and orientated with respect to
the replication and transcription strand (for example, an A4C observed on the
p2q leading strand was counted as a T4G on the lagging). Given the broadly
random orientation of both transcriptional direction of genes in the genome and
replication strand (Supplementary Fig. 2c–d), our null hypothesis is that all the
signatures would have a 50:50 distribution with respect to transcriptional or
replicative strands. To ensure this hypothesis is robust to other features in the
genome effecting mutation rates, such as local base composition, we randomized
the position of the observed mutations keeping the local triplet context (see sta-
tistical analysis section below for more details about the approach used to generate
the simulated data). The random simulations showed no bias towards either
replication strand or transcription strand (all P values 40.05, binomial test). In
contrast, many signatures showed striking bias either in replication strand or
transcription strand with the deviating signatures showing strong statistical sup-
port (all P values o2e � 16 binomial test; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).
Supplementary Figure 2e and 2f show the overall distribution of the ratios for
the six mutation classes and for the 12 signatures, respectively, across all the 560
samples (each dot represents a sample), with summary plots in Supplementary
Fig. 2g–h.
Note that the interpretation of transcriptional or replicative strand bias for
six classes of base substitutions is restricted by the complexity of mutational
mechanisms that contribute to each base substitution class (Fig. 2a,b). For example,
C4T transitions exhibit lagging replicative strand bias (Supplementary Fig. 2g) but
are components of signatures 1 (due to deamination of methylated cytosines), 2
(APOBEC related), 6, 20, 26 (MMR deficiency) and 30 (unknown aetiology).
Hence, our analyses concentrate on exploring extracted base substitution signatures
(Supplementary Fig. 2h) instead of the six classes of base substitutions (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Fig. 2g), but are provided for information.

 Processivity. Processive groups were defined separately for each sample. Kataegis
mutations were excluded from these analyses first as they have been previously
highlighted to demonstrate strand-coordinated mutagenesis thus inclusion of
kataegis would produce a biased signal.
Adjacent somatic mutations were considered to be part of the same processive
group if (i) they were associated with the same signature and (ii) they had the
identical reference allele (complementary mutations were not considered
processive e.g., A4G, T4C, A4G ¼ non-processive while A4G , A4G, A4G
or T4C, T4C, T4C ¼ processive).
The average mutation density for processive groups for each signature is
provided in Supplementary Table 2.
A total of 426,066 processive groups were identified. We characterized each
group by using the number of substitutions involved in each of them (processive
group length). Group length ranged from 2 to 19 (Supplementary Table 2).
Results shown in Fig. 1c were generated by counting the number of groups
having the specified length for each mutation signature. For visualization purposes,
the absolute counts were log10 transformed. We used a set of simulated mutations
to understand whether the observed processive behaviour was the consequence of
the idiosyncrasies of individual samples (that is, the possibility of observing long
processive groups in samples containing many mutations belonging to one
signature may be higher than samples having fewer mutations or having mutations
belonging to several different signatures).
We generated a null distribution by using 100 random data sets that took the
number and type of mutations relevant to each signature into consideration (more
details on the approach used to generate the random simulations can be found in
Relationships with nucleosome occupancy Section. To assess the probability of
observing groups of a particular length, we compared the observed data to the null
distribution. Let pnij be the number of processive groups of length i observed in the
jth random dataset and associated with the signature n. We can compute the
number of processive groups of length i observed across all the 100 simulated
datasets for the signature n as Pn
i ¼ P
j¼1;::;J pn
ij, (J ¼ 1, y, 100), and we can assess
the probability to observe a processive group of length L for the signature n as:
1=J � PðPn
i jiiLÞ. Bonferroni’s correction was used to adjust for multiple testing.
For each signature the replication strand ratio was computed by summing
the mutations over all the groups having the specified length. Two-tailed bino-
mial test was used separately on each group to assess the significance of the
imbalance between leading and lagging strand, and 0.05 was used as the level of
significance in this analysis. Note that groups with less than six mutations did not
contain enough observations to obtain a significant P value from the two-tailed
binomial test.
Intriguingly, we also observed that all or nearly all mutations were on the same
replicative strand within individual processive groups for signature 13. Indeed,
lagging strand bias was Bfourfold stronger for processive mutations than those
that were not processive. The data implies that for signature 13, replication is not
simply a source of single-stranded DNA, it permits processive deamination for
exceptionally long genomic distances.
Relationships with nucleosome occupancy. Micrococcal nuclease sequencing
(MNase-seq) data for the K562 cell line was obtained from the ENCODE
project48. Please see http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=
wgEncodeSydhNsome for details of experiments and generation of nucleosome
density signal maps. Although K562 is not a breast cancer cell line, our choice to
use it for our analysis was motivated by several factors: it has been used in other
research laboratories for similar analyses55, it is one of the two main reference lines
archived in ENCODE with clear cell culture protocols for these experiments and it
is the only cancer cell line available.
To assess the relationships between signatures and nucleosome occupancy, we
created a window of 2 kb centred around each mutation (within a signature), and
obtained the nucleosome density signal observed within the 2 Kb window. We
calculated the SUM of the signal observed across the window for all the mutations
within a signature, and the number of mutations (COUNT) contributing to the
signature. The average signal (y axis) is the SUM/COUNT for every position within
the 2 kb window (Supplementary Fig. 4a–b). The nucleosome density signal
distribution for K562 MNase data encompasses 575,649,742 loci, where the signal
is a smoothed version of the total number of reads. The MNase signal has a skewed
distribution with mode that lies in the interval 0.85–0.9, hence the averaged signal
(accounting for all the mutations) for each signature lies in the region of 0.85–0.9.
Note that every mutation that contributes towards a given signature is at a
different genomic location and there are many thousands, or even tens or hundreds
of thousands of mutations per signature. If mutations in a given signature bore
no relationship to the position of nucleosomes, then when aggregated across
thousands of mutations per signature, a flat line would be seen. However, if
mutations in a particular signature were more frequent at core sequences, there
would be a peak of nucleosome signal where the mutation is centred. If mutations
were more frequent at linker sequences, there would be a trough.
Other computational and statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were
performed in R (version 3.0.2): Pearson’s correlation was performed with cor.test,
binomial test was performed with binomial test, Bonferroni correction was
performed by using p.adjust. Multivariate normal mixtures were computed by
using normalmixEM function available as part of the R/CRAN mixtool package, an
initial mixing proportion of 0.5 was used to compute three components (parameter
lambda and k of the function, respectively). corrplot R package was used to
generate Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b and 5a. Data in bigWig format were
preprocessed by using bigWigToBedGraph script. Perl EnsEMBL API (version 73)
was used to extract the genome features of interest. bedtools (version 2.16.2) was used
to identify intersection and union among genomic features, and to manipulate BED
files. samtools (version 0.1.18) was used to extract subsequences from fasta files.
Random mutations were generated in agreement with their flanking sequence
context defined by the neighbouring bases immediately 50 and 30 to the mutated
base and by the mutated base itself. We generated random simulations of the
dataset obtained from the 560 breast cancers. We imposed the following
constraints: (i) mutation class (ii) flanking sequence context (iii) overall mutation
burden (iv) contribution of each mutation signature to each sample.
To perform simulations of processive data, mutations for each signature were
shuffled separately for each sample. Shuffled samples were then used to compute
the processive groups. For each signature 100 simulations were used to compute
the null distribution associated with the expected processive length associated.
For each observed rearrangement we simulated both breakpoint junctions, and
we kept the signature, and type (that is, translocation, inversion, deletion and
tandem duplication) observed in the real dataset. Given a rearrangement we
randomly picked the first breakpoint from one of the replication time deciles, then
(i) if the rearrangement was not a translocation then we randomly pick the second
breakpoint on the same chromosome of the first one (ii) if the rearrangement was a
translocation we randomly picked also the second breakpoint without any
constraint.
Functional genomics experiments based on next-generation sequencing, such as
Repli-seq and MNase-seq, often produce artefactual signals in certain regions of the
genome. To filter out artefact-ridden regions that tend to show artificially high/low
signals, we excluded from our analyses ENCODE blacklisted genomic regions
(human, hg19/GRCh37):
