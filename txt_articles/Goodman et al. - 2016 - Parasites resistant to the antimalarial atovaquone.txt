Drug resistance compromises control of malaria. Here, we show that resistance to a
commonly used antimalarial medication, atovaquone, is apparently unable to spread.
Atovaquone pressure selects parasites with mutations in cytochrome b, a respiratory
protein with low but essential activity in the mammalian blood phase of the parasite life
cycle. Resistance mutations rescue parasites from the drug but later prove lethal in the
mosquito phase, where parasites require full respiration. Unable to respire efficiently,
resistant parasites fail to complete mosquito development, arresting their life cycle.
Because cytochrome b is encoded by the maternally inherited parasite mitochondrion,
even outcrossing with wild-type strains cannot facilitate spread of resistance. Lack of
transmission suggests that resistance will be unable to spread in the field, greatly
enhancing the utility of atovaquone in malaria control.
A
tovaquone, a component of the safe and
effective antimalarial medication Malarone,
kills both the blood and liver stages of
malaria (1). The rollout of cheap generics
should see increased atovaquone usage,
and atovaquone derivatives are in development
(1). Atovaquone is prone to resistance (1), and it
has been assumed that this resistance will spread
(2, 3), as it has for other antimalarials (4, 5).
However, the target of atovaquone, cytochrome b
(cytB) (6–9), has unique genetics (10–12) and ex-
periences differential selection across the malaria
parasite life cycle (13), which prompted us to in-
vestigatewhetheratovaquoneresistancecanspread
via the mosquito vector.
We tested three atovaquone-resistant strains of
the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei,
eachwithdifferentmutationsintheirmitochondrial
DNA-encoded cytB gene (14, 15), for transmissibility
frommousetomosquitoandbacktomouse(Table1).
Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed on
mice infected with either the parental PbANKA
strain or one of the three atovaquone-resistant
mutants, and sexual development of parasites
in mosquitoes was assayed (Table 1). All three
atovaquone-resistant parasite lines produced wild-
typenumbersofactivemalegametes(exflagellation)
(Table 1). Parasites carrying the PbM133I and
PbY268C mutations in their cytB gene were able
to self-fertilize, generate ookinetes, and successful-
ly produce oocysts, but the oocysts produced had
developmental defects (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table
1). Parasites with the PbY268N mutation were de-
fective in the ability to self-fertilize and infect the
mosquito host (Table 1) due to severely impaired
female gamete activation (Fig. 1C). From 17 at-
tempted mosquito infections, no parasite carrying
an atovaquone-resistant cytB mutation was able
to generate the sporozoite stages in the mosquito
salivary glands or was able to infect a naïve mouse
(Table 1). We conclude that the rodent malaria
atovaquone-resistant cytB mutants tested—which
represent a good cross section of the clinical
atovaquone-resistant genotypes, including the
common Y268 locus (16)—are unable to transmit
from mouse to mouse via A. stephensi mosqui-
toes when self-fertilizing.
To determine whether outcrossing with
atovaquone-sensitive parasites could help transmit
the atovaquone resistance genes, we generated
crosses of our atovaquone-resistant P. berghei
lines with atovaquone-sensitive parasites. These
experiments simulate what might happen if a
mosquito bit an individual (or separate individu-
als) infected with both atovaquone-resistant and
atovaquone-sensitive parasites, which can then mate
inthemosquitogut.Theyallowustoassesswhether
the presence of wild-type copies of the cytB genes
from one parent can complement a mutation in
the other, as observed with deletions of electron
transport components encoded in the nuclear
genome (17). We first crossed PbY268C with an
atovaquone-sensitive line (wild-type cytB) car-
rying a mutation (15) in the nucleus-encoded
dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene conferring
pyrimethamine resistance (PbdhfrS110N) by pool-
ing blood from separate infected mice and then
membrane-feeding mosquitoes. Sporozoites were
produced, and all 14 naïve mice bitten by these
mosquitoes (three trials) developed blood-stage
infections. Genotyping of these progeny [passage

Downloaded from 
 zero (P0)] showed that outcrossing had occurred
because 2 out of 14 mice carried parasites with
both the wild-type and pyrimethamine-resistant
(S110N) alleles of Pbdhfr. However, all 14 mice car-
ried parasites with only wild-type, atovaquone-
sensitive cytB alleles; outcrossing did not facilitate
transmission of atovaquone resistance.
To explore this further, and quantify the level
of outcrossing, we fed A. stephensi mosquitoes
from mice infected with equal numbers of an
atovaquone-sensitive line that constitutively ex-
presses green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the
nucleus (18) and one of our three atovaquone-
resistant lines (PbM133I, PbY268C, or PbY268N),
which lack GFP. All crosses between sensitive
(PbGFP) parasites and our atovaquone-resistant
parasites successfully infected the mosquitoes,
and these mosquitoes were able to infect naïve
mice by biting (Table 2). Presence in the progeny
of both the GFP and the wild-type (no GFP) nu-
clear markers confirmed outcrossing (Table 2).
However, all the progeny had wild-type cytB geno-
type and were sensitive to atovaquone (Table 2
and fig. S1), reaffirming that the resistance muta-
tions cannot be complemented and transmitted,
even when one parent carries a wild-type version
of the gene. We conclude that outcrossing cannot
assist transmission of the commonly occurring
cytB mutations conferring atovaquone resistance.
The malaria parasite cytB gene is encoded on
maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (10–12),
which implies that known forms of atovaquone
resistance must be maternally inherited. We rea-
soned that the block in mosquito-stage develop-
ment when atovaquone-resistant parasites attempt
to self-fertilize (Table 1) is due to the mutation in
the cytochrome b protein in the mitochondrion,
which is only carried by the female gamete and
effectively renders cytB mutant females sterile.
To confirm this, we crossed our three P. berghei
atovaquone-resistant lines with parasites genet-
ically modified to be either male sterile (genotype
Pbs48|45ko) or female sterile (genotype Pbnek-4ko)
(19, 20). If atovaquone resistance is indeed linked
to mitochondrial inheritance, we expect normal ge-
netic recombination from crosses to male-deficient
parasites but no progeny from attempted crosses
toa secondfemale-deficient line. After confirming
the phenotypes of the tester parasite lines (18–20),
we crossed each of them with our three P. berghei
cytB mutants. Crosses to the male-deficient line
resulted in recombinant progeny (Table 2), con-
firming previous results from outcrossing to wild
type. Again, though, all progeny from these crosses
had wild-type, atovaquone-sensitive cytB geno-
type (Table 2), so they must have acquired their
mitochondria from Pbs48|45ko female gametes
(Fig. 2C).
Crossing atovaquone-resistant lines with the
female infertile Pbnek-4ko (20) resulted in no
progeny in 16 of 17 attempts to transmit to a
naïve mouse (Table 2), largely confirming our hy-
pothesis that the atovaquone-resistant mutants
are effectively female sterile. In a single instance,
parasites carrying the Y268C mutation were trans-
mitted but with a markedly reduced efficiency
(8 days to patency) (Table 2). Three independent
cloned lines of the parasites recovered from this
sole transmission event (named PbY268C P0) were
unable to retransmit when either self-fertilized
or backcrossed to Pbnek-4ko parasites (Tables
1 and 2); passage had not improved their trans-
missibility. In sum, from 44 separate transmission
attempts involving 750 mosquito bites, atovaquone
resistance transmission was only observed once,
and this mutant was unable to transmit further
despite seven attempts. We conclude that the
cytB mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of
atovaquone-resistant rodent malaria parasites
render them effectively female sterile and hence
largely unable to pass on the resistance gene,

drion (Fig. 2).
To determine whether the impact of cytB mu-
tations conferring atovaquone resistance on trans-
mission is similar in the human malaria parasite
(P. falciparum), we selected atovaquone-resistant
lines by repeated exposure to sublethal concen-
trations of a drug during in vitro culture (16). Two
clones, with different mutations in cytB (M133I
and V259L), were established (Table 1). In vitro
cultured gametocytes were fed to A. gambiae
mosquitoes, and oocyst numbers were counted
7 days after infection (Table 1). The parental line
(NF54e) retained normal mosquito infectivity
(Table 1). However, the two atovaquone-resistant
mutants were severely impaired in their mos-
quito infectivity and in the number of oocysts
produced when infection did occur (Table 1).
The severe defect in activation of female ga-
metes phenocopies the reduced number of ac-
tivated females in the rodent malaria PbY268N
(Fig. 1C). We conclude that human P. falciparum
malaria parasites carrying atovaquone resistance
mutations in cytB are unable to successfully infect

Our findings show that common, clinically rel-
evant atovaquone resistance mutations block trans-
mission of malaria by the mosquito vector and that
this phenotype is a consequence of maternalinher-
itance of the mitochondrion. Why are cytB muta-
tions “genetic time bombs” that affect the mosquito

recovered atovaquone resistance mutations are in
the quinol oxidase (Qo) site of the mitochondrion-

atovaquone from displacing ubiquinone from

mitochondrion-encoded resistance allele. The progeny develop poorly in mosquitoes, are not viable, and cannot transmit.

 minimal levels during the malaria parasite blood
phase, which relies solely on aerobic glycolysis
(21). Nevertheless, nominal transport is essential,
primarily as an electron sink for pyrimidine bio-
synthesis (22). We hypothesize that the modest
levels of mitochondrial electron transport during
blood phase offer relaxed selection on cytB—which
is multicopy and easily mutable (3, 23)—allowing
respiration-deficient mutants (8, 24) with reduced
atovaquone binding (9) to be readily selected
by drug pressure. However, when these mutants
switch to the mosquito phase—which relies on
full aerobic respiration with an active tricarbo-
xylic acid cycle (25), robust electron transport
(17, 26, 27), and mitochondrial adenosine triphos-
phatase activity (28)—the respiration deficits of
the cytB mutants (8, 24) prevent them from com-
pleting their development and generating infectious
sporozoites. This results in a block of transmission
of atovaquone resistance genotypes to new hosts—
a block that cannot be overcome by outcrossing
because cytB is maternally inherited.
Cytochrome b is thus a rather unique malaria
drug target. Its genetics are constrained by ma-
ternal inheritance (10–12, 29), there is no recom-
bination of mitochondrial DNA (23), and markedly
different selection regimes in the mammalian
versus the mosquito hosts (17, 25, 26, 28) all com-
binetorestricttheparasite’soptionstodisseminate
mutations conferring resistance to atovaquone,
even though they can arise relatively quickly in
patients (2, 3). These constraints likely apply to
other cytochrome b targeting drugs currently
under development (30–32) and perhaps to drugs
targeting the maternally inherited apicoplast
(10–12, 29), an endosymbiotic organelle drug tar-
get that also has differential activity across the
life cycle.

Nuclear envelope rupture and repair
during cancer cell migration

During cancer metastasis, tumor cells penetrate tissues through tight interstitial spaces,
which requires extensive deformation of the cell and its nucleus. Here, we investigated
mammalian tumor cell migration in confining microenvironments in vitro and in vivo.
Nuclear deformation caused localized loss of nuclear envelope (NE) integrity, which led
to the uncontrolled exchange of nucleo-cytoplasmic content, herniation of chromatin
across the NE, and DNA damage. The incidence of NE rupture increased with cell
confinement and with depletion of nuclear lamins, NE proteins that structurally support
the nucleus. Cells restored NE integrity using components of the endosomal sorting
complexes required for transport III (ESCRT III) machinery. Our findings indicate that cell
migration incurs substantial physical stress on the NE and its content and requires
efficient NE and DNA damage repair for cell survival.
T
he nuclear envelope (NE), comprising the
inner and outer nuclear membranes, nu-
clear pore complexes, and the nuclear lam-
ina, presents a physical barrier between the
nuclear interior and the cytoplasm that pro-
tects the genome from cytoplasmic components
and establishes a separate compartment for DNA
and RNA synthesis and processing (1). Loss of
NE integrity and nuclear pore selectivity has
been linked to the normal aging process and a
variety of human diseases, including cancer (2).
In cancer progression, key steps of tumor cell
invasion depend upon deformation of the nu-
cleus into available spaces within the three-
dimensional tissue (3–6). Whereas the cytoplasm
of migrating cells can penetrate even submicron-
sized pores, the deformation of the large and
relatively rigid nucleus becomes a rate-limiting
factor in migration through pores <25 mm2 in
cross section (4, 6–10). We hypothesized that
migration through such tight spaces provides a
substantial mechanical challenge to the integrity
of the nucleus. Thus, we investigated whether
cell migration through confining spaces induces
NE rupture and compromises DNA integrity
