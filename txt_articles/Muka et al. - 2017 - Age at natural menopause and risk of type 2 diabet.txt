Abstract
Aims/hypothesis In this study, we aimed to examine the asso-
ciation between age at natural menopause and risk of type 2
diabetes, and to assess whether this association is independent
of potential mediators.
Methods We included 3639 postmenopausal women from the
prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study. Age at natu-
ral menopause was self-reported retrospectively and was treat-
ed as a continuous variable and in categories (premature,
<40 years; early, 40–44 years; normal, 45–55 years; and late
menopause, >55 years [reference]). Type 2 diabetes events
were diagnosed on the basis of medical records and glucose
measurements from Rotterdam Study visits. HRs and 95% CIs
were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models, ad-
justed for confounding factors; in another model, they were
additionally adjusted for potential mediators, including obesi-
ty, C-reactive protein, glucose and insulin, as well as for levels
of total oestradiol and androgens.
Results During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, we identified
348 individuals with incident type 2 diabetes. After adjust-
ment for confounders, HRs for type 2 diabetes were 3.7
(95% CI 1.8, 7.5), 2.4 (95% CI 1.3, 4.3) and 1.60 (95% CI
1.0, 2.8) for women with premature, early and normal meno-
pause, respectively, relative to those with late menopause (p-
trend <0.001). The HR for type 2 diabetes per 1 year older at
menopause was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98). Further adjustment
for BMI, glycaemic traits, metabolic risk factors, C-reactive
protein, endogenous sex hormone levels or shared genetic
factors did not affect this association.
Conclusions/interpretation Early onset of natural menopause
is an independent marker for type 2 diabetes in postmenopaus-
al women.

 Introduction
Menopause marks a major life transition for women, resulting in
the loss of ovarian follicle development [1]. Although meno-
pause is a universal phenomenon in women, timing of the final
menstrual period differs greatly [1, 2], and is considered a marker
of ageing and cardiovascular health [2]. Women with early onset
of menopause (<45 years) have an increased risk of cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) and overall mortality, whereas menopause
onset at age 50–54 years is linked to a reduced risk of CVD and
mortality [3]. The increased risk of CVD and mortality is be-
lieved to be due to the adverse effects of early onset of meno-
pause on CVD risk factors, but the influence of age at menopause
on levels of cardiovascular risk factors remains unclear [3].
Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for CVD, and it is
unclear whether age at menopause is associated with risk of type
2 diabetes [3, 4]. Data from cross-sectional studies examining the
association between age at menopause and type 2 diabetes are
contradictory, with a few studies reporting no association and
some other reporting higher odds of having type 2 diabetes with
early onset of menopause [5–7]. Recently, a nested case–cohort
study reported that an increased risk of type 2 diabetes is associ-
ated with early onset of menopause, but it did not adjust for
potential intermediate risk factors such as glucose metabolism,
insulin or shared genetic factors [8]. Menopause transition is
associated with weight gain, an increase in visceral fat and im-
pairment of glucose homeostasis, all of which are important risk
factors for type 2 diabetes [9–11]. However, no study has exam-
ined the role of postmenopausal hormone levels in the associa-
tion between age of menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Although the available evidence is not persuasive and the mech-
anisms remain unclear, age of menopause might be associated
with levels of endogenous sex hormones, which might affect the
risk of type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women [12–17].
Therefore, it is not clear whether the observed association be-
tween early onset of menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes can
be explained by differences in sex hormones levels in women
who experience early vs late menopause.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association be-
tween age at natural menopause and risk of developing type 2
diabetes, and to assess whether this association is independent of
potential intermediate risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, we examined the role of endogenous sex hormone
levels in the association between age at natural menopause and
type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Study population
The Rotterdam Study is a Dutch population-based, prospective
cohort study. This project was initiated in 1990–1993 in the
Ommoord district of Rotterdam. The design and rationale of
the Rotterdam Study have been described in detail elsewhere
[18]. In summary, all inhabitants of this district aged 55 years
and over were invited to participate, leading to a baseline cohort
of 7983 participants (RSI). Over the years, two more allocation
rounds were held. The first, in 2000–2001, included all inhabi-
tants aged 55 years and over, leading to recruitment of an addi-
tional 3011 participants (RSII) [18]. In a second extension initi-
ated in 2006, 3932 participants aged 45 years and over were
included (RSIII) [18]. For follow-up, examinations were sched-
uled every 3–5 years [18]. The Rotterdam Study complies with
the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the
Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre and
also complies with the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and
Sport. All participants provided written informed consent to ob-
tain and process data from their treating healthcare providers.
Population for analysis
The present study used data from the third visit of the first
cohort (RSI-3) and the baseline examinations of the second
(RSII-1) and third (RSIII-1) cohorts (electronic supplementary
material [ESM] Fig. 1). A total of 6816 women were eligible
for the analysis. Of these, 2053 women were excluded because
(1) there was no information on their menopause status (n = 9);
(2) they were not postmenopausal (n = 732); (3) age at meno-
pause was not known (n = 145); (4) they did not give informed
consent for type 2 diabetes follow-up (n = 56); (5) they had
prevalent type 2 diabetes (n = 609); and (6) no information on
incident type 2 diabetes was available (n = 502; Fig. 1). A
further 1124 women were excluded because they had experi-
enced non-natural menopause (n = 1109) or the type of meno-
pause was not known (n = 15), leaving 3639 women included
in the final analysis (Fig. 1).
Assessment of age at menopause
Menopausal status was evaluated using a subsection of the
home interview questionnaire [18]. One set of questions was
designed to obtain information on the timing of the last men-
strual period, whether the respondent had experienced a natu-
ral menstrual period within the past 12 months and the age at
last period for women who had not had a period for at least
12 months. Postmenopausal women were defined as women
who reported an absence of menstrual periods for 12 months.
For women who had experienced a natural menopause, age at
menopause was defined as the self-reported age at the time of
the last menstruation. For all women reporting menopause
after gynaecological surgery or radiation therapy, and for
those reporting any other operations before the age of 50 years
that might have led to menopause, information on the exact
date and type of operation was verified using general
1952
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1951–1960
 practitioner records, including correspondence from medical
specialists.
Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes
Participants were followed up from the date of the baseline
centre visit onwards. At baseline and during follow-up, cases
of prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes were ascertained
through active follow-up using general practitioner records,
hospital discharge letters and glucose measurements from
Rotterdam Study visits, which take place approximately every
4 years [19]. Prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes were de-
fined according to recent WHO guidelines as a fasting blood
glucose concentration of ≥7.0 mmol/l, a non-fasting blood
glucose concentration of ≥11.1 mmol/l (when fasting samples
were unavailable) or the use of glucose-lowering medication
[20]. Information on the use of glucose-lowering medication
was obtained from both structured home interviews and phar-
macy records [19]. At baseline, more than 95% of the
Rotterdam Study population was covered by pharmacies with-
in the study area. All potential type 2 diabetes events were
independently adjudicated by two study physicians. In the
case of disagreement, consensus was sought with an endocri-
nologist. Follow-up data were complete until 1 January 2012.
Potential confounding variables
Information on current health status, medical history, medica-
tion use, smoking behaviour, socioeconomic status and other
factors was obtained at baseline (RSI-3, RSII-1 and RSIII-1;
ESM Fig. 1). Education level was defined as low (primary
education), intermediate (secondary general or vocational ed-
ucation) or high (higher vocational education or university).
Data on age at menarche were collected by asking women,
‘How old were you when you had your first menstrual peri-
od?’ The retrospective data on self-reported number of preg-
nancies of at least 6 months’ duration and use of hormone
replacement therapy were collected by a questionnaire during
the home interview. Participants were asked whether they
were currently smoking cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Alcohol
intake was measured in grams of ethanol per day. History of
CVD was defined as a history of CHD (myocardial infarction,
revascularisation, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or per-
cutaneous coronary intervention), heart failure and stroke, and
was verified from the medical records of the general practi-
tioner. BP was measured in the sitting position at the right
upper arm with a random-zero-sphygmomanometer. The
mean of two consecutive measurements was taken.
Medication use information was based on home interview.
Antihypertensive medication use was defined as use of di-
uretics, β blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors
and calcium channel blockers. All biochemical variables were
assessed in serum samples taken after fasting. Thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured on the Vitros Eci
(Ortho Diagnostics). Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol
(HDL-C), triacylglycerol (TG) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
were measured on the COBAS 8000 Modular Analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics). LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were
estimated indirectly from measurements of TC, HDL-C and
TG by means of the Friedewald equation [21]. The corre-
sponding interassay CVs are: TSH, <13.2%; lipids, <2.1%;
and CRP, <16.9%. Physical activity was assessed using the
Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam Physical Activity
Questionnaire and is expressed in MET-h/week [22].
Potential intermediate variables
All intermediate variables were assessed at baseline (RSI-3,
RSII-1 and RSIII-1; ESM Fig. 1), and the height (m) and body
weight (kg) of participants were measured without shoes and
heavy outer garments. BMI was calculated as weight divided
by height squared (kg/m2). Fasting insulin and glucose levels

 were measured using a COBAS 8000 Modular Analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics). The interassay CVs are <8% and
<1.4% for insulin and glucose, respectively. Total oestradiol
levels were measured using RIA and sex hormone-binding
globulin (SHBG) levels were measured using the Immulite
platform (Diagnostics Products, Breda, the Netherlands).
The minimum detection limit for oestradiol was 18.35 pmol/l.
Serum levels of total testosterone were measured using liq-
uid chromatography–tandem MS. The corresponding
interassay CVs for total oestradiol, SHBG and total testoster-
one are <7%, <5% and <5%, respectively. Serum levels of
dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sul-
phate were estimated in 12 batches by coated-tube or
double-antibody RIAs (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories,
Webster, TX, USA). In self-reported white participants,
genotyping was conducted using the Illumina 550K array.
We selected 54 SNPs previously reported to have an associa-
tion with age at natural menopause from a genome-wide as-
sociation study of 70,000 women [23]. We calculated a
weighted genetic risk score by multiplying the number of risk
alleles at each locus by the corresponding reported β coeffi-
cient from the previous genome-wide association study and
then summing the products. The total score was then divided
by the average effect size multiplied by 100 to rescale the
scores to a range of 0–100.
Statistical analysis
Main analyses Person-years of follow-up were calculated
from the study entry date (RSI-3, March 1997 – December
1999; RSII-1, February 2000 – December 2001; and RSIII-1,
February 2006 – December 2008) to the date of type 2 diabe-
tes diagnosis, death or the censor date (date of last contact),
whichever occurred first. Participants were followed up until 1
January 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
evaluate whether age at natural menopause as a continuous or
categorical variable (categories: premature menopause,
<40 years; early menopause, 40–44 years, normal menopause,
45–55 years; and late menopause, >55 years [reference]) was
associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. HR and 95% CIs were
calculated. The proportional hazard assumption of the Cox
model was checked by visual inspection of log minus log plots
and by performing a test for heterogeneity of exposure over
time. There was no evidence for violation of the proportion-
ality assumption in any of the models (p for time-dependent
interaction terms >0.05). To study relationships across in-
creasing categories of age at natural menopause, trend tests
were computed by entering the categorical variables as con-
tinuous variables in multivariable Cox proportional hazard
models. To achieve normal distributions, skewed variables
(CRP, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, insulin, testosterone,
TG, TSH and SHBG) were natural log-transformed. In the
base model (model 1), we adjusted for age, cohort (I, II and
III), use of hormone replacement therapy and reproductive
factors (age at menarche and number of pregnancies of at least
6 months’ duration). To examine whether the relationship of
age at natural menopause with risk of type 2 diabetes was
independent of potential intermediate factors, model 2 includ-
ed the terms of model 1, as well as BMI (continuous), glucose
concentration (continuous) and insulin concentration (contin-
uous). Model 3 included all covariates included in model 2,
along with the following additional potential confounding fac-
tors or intermediate factors: metabolic risk factors (total cho-
lesterol, systolic BP [continuous], indication for hypertension
[yes vs no] and use of lipid-lowering medication [yes vs no]),
lifestyle factors (alcohol intake [continuous], smoking status
[current vs former/never] and physical activity [continuous]),
education level (low, intermediate and high), prevalent CHD
(yes vs no) and CRP level (continuous). Moreover, to explore
whether a nonlinear association was present, a quadratic term
for age at natural menopause (continuous) was tested.
Sensitivity analyses To explore whether sex hormone levels
and common genetic factors could explain the association
between age at natural menopause and type 2 diabetes, the
models were further adjusted for these factors. Studies suggest
that age at menopause and age-related disease risk are linked
through common genetic factors [11]. We also performed a
series of alternative sensitivity analyses. Since waist circum-
ference is a better measure of visceral adiposity (an important
risk factor for diabetes) and menopause is associated with
accumulation of abdominal fat, we performed a sensitivity
analysis substituting BMI with waist circumference [9]. To
account for the specific effects of lipid particles on diabetes,
we substituted TC with HDL-C, LDL-C and TG. We also
restricted the analysis to participants who did not report using
lipid-lowering medication. Information on parental history of
diabetes was collected by trained research assistants during
home visits at RSI and RSII, but not at RSIII. Therefore, we
further adjusted the multivariable model for parental history of
diabetes, but restricting the analysis to RSI-3 and RSII-1.
Since smoking and hormone replacement therapy are impor-
tant determinants of age at natural menopause and are associ-
ated with a risk of type 2 diabetes [24, 25], we restricted the
analysis to women who were not current smokers and did not
report use of hormone replacement therapy. To explore
potential survival bias, we stratified the analysis by baseline
age (<65 years and ≥65 years). We also reanalysed the data
excluding the first 3 years of follow-up and excluding the
participants with prevalent CVD. Moreover, we included
women with non-natural menopause or unknown menopause
type in the analysis to investigate the role of both age at natural
and non-natural menopause in the risk of type 2 diabetes
(selected characteristics are shown in ESM Table 1). Values
were missing for one or more covariates (Table 1). As these
values were likely to be missing at random, to prevent loss of
1954
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1951–1960
 efficiency, missing values were imputed using a multiple
imputation technique (60 imputation sets; ESM Table 2).
There were no significant differences in age at natural
menopause or incident type 2 diabetes between participants
with complete information for all covariates (n = 1884) and
those who had missing values for at least one covariate in
model 3 (n = 1755, 48%). Rubin’s method was used to
calculate pooled coefficients (HR) and 95% CIs [26]. A
p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statistics software
(version 21.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Table 1 summarises the baseline characteristics of all women
included in the analysis (baseline characteristics by cohort are
shown in ESM Table 3). The mean (SD) age at entry into the
study was 66.9 (9.6) years. The mean (SD) age at natural
menopause was 50.0 (4.4) years, with 2.3% and 8.2% of
women experiencing menopause before age 40 years and be-
tween the ages of 40 and 44 years, respectively (Table 2). The
median time since menopause was 15.0 years.
Of the 3639 postmenopausal women without diabetes at
baseline, 348 developed incident type 2 diabetes over a medi-
an follow-up of 9.2 years. Premature menopause and early
onset of natural menopause were associated with a higher risk
of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). In model 1, the HRs for the
association between age at natural menopause and type 2 di-
abetes were 3.65 (95% CI 1.76, 7.55), 2.36 (95% CI 1.30,
4.30) and 1.62 (95% CI 0.96, 2.76) for women who experi-
enced menopause at ages <40, 40–44 and 45–55 years, re-
spectively, relative to those who experienced menopause at
age >55 years (ptrend <0.001; Table 2). The HR for type 2
diabetes per 1 year older age at natural menopause was 0.96
(95% CI 0.94, 0.98; Table 2). Controlling for BMI, glycaemic
traits, metabolic risk factors, lifestyle factors, inflammatory
markers and prevalent CVD did not affect this association
(Table 2); nor did further adjustment for genetic risk score of
age at natural menopause (Table 3). There was also no evi-
dence of a nonlinear relationship (pquadratic >0.05; Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis
In sensitivity analyses, substituting BMI with waist circumfer-
ence as a measure of adiposity, substituting TC for other blood
lipids, restricting the analysis to participants who did not
report the use of lipid-lowering medication, and further
adjustment for physical activity, levels of serum TSH, total
oestradiol, other endogenous sex hormones and SHBG, or
parental history of diabetes, as well as excluding participants
with prevalent CVD, and excluding the first 3 years of follow-
up, did not affect the association between age at natural
menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 3) The results
did not change when the analysis was restricted to women
who were no current smokers or did not use hormone replace-
ment therapy, nor after stratification by age (Table 3).
Although the results were attenuated after inclusion of women
with non-natural menopause, the association between early
age at (natural and non-natural) menopause and risk of type
2 diabetes remained significant (ESM Table 4). Restriction of
the analysis to women for whom data were available for all
covariates provided similar results, albeit not statistically sig-
nificant (ESM Table 5).
Discussion
In this large population-based study of postmenopausal wom-
en free of type 2 diabetes at baseline, we showed that early
onset of natural menopause is associated with an increased
risk of type 2 diabetes, independent of potential intermediate
risk factors for type 2 diabetes (including BMI, glucose and
insulin levels) and of levels of endogenous sex hormones and
SHBG. We also showed that shared genetic factors could not
explain the association between age at natural menopause and
risk of type 2 diabetes.
While most studies have investigated a link between age at
menopause and cardiovascular outcomes, reporting an in-
creased risk of CVD associated with early onset of meno-
pause, few studies have examined a possible association be-
tween age at menopause with risk of type 2 diabetes [3].
Cross-sectional studies examining the association between
age at menopause and type 2 diabetes have yielded contradic-
tory results, showing either no association or an increased
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in women who experience early
onset of menopause [5–7]. Similar to our findings, Brand and
colleagues, in a nested case–cohort study, showed an in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes with early onset menopause,
reporting similar size effects to those of the current investiga-
tion (HR 0.93 per 1 year older at menopause) [8]. However,
we extended their findings and showed that this association
was independent of potential mediators, including endoge-
nous sex hormone levels.
Early onset of natural menopause has been suggested to
increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including type
2 diabetes, due to early cessation of the protective effects of
endogenous oestrogen [5]. Animal studies have shown that
oestradiol decreases the amount of adipose tissue and has a
protective role on glucose metabolism [27, 28]. Also, trials in
postmenopausal women have linked oral oestrogen therapy
with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes [29–31]. In contrast, ob-
servational data do not support a protective effect of oestrogen
in cardiometabolic health. In postmenopausal women, higher
endogenous oestradiol levels have been associated with higher
levels of glucose and insulin, and an increase rather than
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1951–1960

 decrease in diabetes risk [32–35]. Moreover, an early start to
oestrogen exposure (i.e. an early age at menarche) and a high
endogenous oestradiol status have been linked with insulin
resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes [36–38].
This evidence, which is also supported by our study, suggests
that other menopause-related factors may explain the associa-
tion between age at menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes. In
the current study, we showed that neither SHBG levels nor
androgen levels (both of which might be associated with
menopause and with type 2 diabetes) could explain the asso-
ciation between early onset of natural menopause and risk of
type 2 diabetes. A possible explanation for the observed asso-
ciation between age at natural menopause and risk of type 2
diabetes could be disruption of the hypothalamus–pituitary–
ovarian axis, resulting in increased release of the gonadotro-
pins and follicle-stimulating hormone by the pituitary gland.
Our study did not include data on levels of follicle-stimulating
hormone. However, observational studies have shown that

 low (rather than high) levels of follicle-stimulating hormone
are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in
postmenopausal women [39, 40]. Also, lifestyle factors such
as smoking and alcohol consumption are closely linked to age
at menopause; e.g. smokers reach menopause on average
2 years earlier than non-smokers [24, 41]. Therefore, the rela-
tionship between age at menopause and type 2 diabetes is
probably confounded by these factors. However, in our anal-
ysis, adjusting for both smoking and alcohol consumption and
restricting the analysis to women who did not currently smoke
had no impact on the results. Moreover, we found that age at
natural menopause was associated with type 2 diabetes inde-
pendent of glucose and insulin levels. Therefore, the mecha-
nisms linking age at natural menopause with risk of type 2
diabetes remain unclear, and future studies are needed to ex-
plore which biological pathways are involved.
Recent data show that an early natural menopause may be a
marker of premature ageing and related to pathways linked to
longevity [23]. Furthermore, age at natural menopause is as-
sociated with DNA damage repair, which is also linked to risk
of type 2 diabetes [23, 42, 43]. Menopause, therefore, might
be a marker of ageing of the somatic (non-reproductive) tis-
sues [11]. Owing to genetic variation, the soma of women
equipped with less efficient DNA repair and maintenance
might age faster compared with those with more efficient
repair and maintenance [11]. Hence, early menopause might
be a consequence of accelerated ageing of the soma and might
therefore be a very good predictor of general health in later
life, including type 2 diabetes risk [11]. However, when we
adjusted for shared genetic factors, our results did not change.
Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies previously
identified approximately 56 SNPs across the human genome
that account for only a small proportion of the interindividual
variation in the age at menopause [23]. Epigenetic modifica-
tions such as DNA methylation of cytosine residues in CpG
dinucleotides and histone modification might constitute an
additional pathway leading to menopause onset and type 2
diabetes [44]. Future studies should explore epigenetic modi-
fications related to menopause onset and whether epigenetic
signatures can explain the association between age at natural
menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Strengths of our study include its prospective design, the
long follow-up and adequate adjustment for a broad range of
confounders and possible intermediate risk factors for type 2
diabetes. Moreover, incident diabetes was diagnosed via
standardised blood glucose measurements at the repeated
study centre visits and electronic linkage with pharmacy dis-
pensing records in the study area. However, several limita-
tions need to be taken into account. One limitation is reliance
on retrospective self-reporting of age at natural menopause,
which is subject to faulty memory and reporting bias, partic-
ularly in older women. However, the results did no differ
when we stratified by age at enrolment. Also, because the
outcome (type 2 diabetes incidence) was assessed prospec-
tively, the subjective measure of age at natural menopause
would probably lead to non-differential misclassification with
respect to the outcome, and would therefore bias estimates
toward the null. Furthermore, previous reports indicate that
the validity and reproducibility of self-reported age at meno-
pause is fairly good [3, 45]. In addition, mean age at natural

 menopause in the current study is similar to the mean age at
natural menopause reported by other studies in the
Netherlands and United States [46, 47]. However, despite
the prospective design, we cannot rule out the possibility that
the observed associations may partly reflect unmeasured re-
sidual confounding or that diabetes can lead to early onset of
menopause, as suggested recently [48]. Survival bias may also
exist, since women included in our study may represent sur-
vivors of early menopause who did not develop type 2 diabe-
tes or died prior to the enrolment date. There is also a time
interval between the start of menopause and enrolment into
the Rotterdam Study. However, when we stratified partici-
pants by age at enrolment, we did not find any difference in
results. Furthermore, if survival bias were present, then the
true point estimate for the relationship between early meno-
pause and type 2 diabetes might be larger than we observed.
Furthermore, all confounding factors and mediators
considered in the current investigation were assessed years
after menopause and not at the start of menopause, and
oestradiol was measured using an immunoassay with a detec-
tion limit of 18.35 pmol/l, which is considered suboptimal
particularly in postmenopausal women. Therefore, our results
should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, the analysis on
the role of endogenous sex hormones should be interpreted
with caution since the levels of sex hormones were measured
at a later time point, and not at menopause onset. The current
evidence for an association between age at menopause and
postmenopausal levels of endogenous sex hormones is not
persuasive [14–17]. Finally, the Rotterdam Study mainly in-
cludes individuals of European ancestry (98%). Thus, our
findings may not extend to non-white ethnicities.
Early onset of natural menopause is an independent marker
of type 2 diabetes risk in postmenopausal women. Future
studies are needed to examine the mechanisms behind this
