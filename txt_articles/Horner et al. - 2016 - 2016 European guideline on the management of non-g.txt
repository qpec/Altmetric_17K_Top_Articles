Abstract 
We present the updated International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) 
guideline for the management of non-gonococcal urethritis in men. This guideline 
recommends confirmation of urethritis in symptomatic men before starting treatment. It does 
not recommend testing asymptomatic men for the presence of urethritis. All men with 
urethritis should be tested for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and ideally 
M. genitalium using a NAAT as this is highly likely to improve clinical outcomes. If a NAAT 
is positive for gonorrhoea, a culture should be performed before treatment. In view of the 
increasing evidence that azithromycin 1 g may result in the development of antimicrobial 
resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium   azithromycin 1 g is no longer recommended as first 
line therapy which should be  doxycycline 100mgs bd for 7 days. If azithromycin is to be 
prescribed  an extended of 500mg then 250mg daily for 4 days is to be preferred over 1g stat. 
In men with persistent NGU, M. genitalium NAAT testing is recommended if not previously 
undertaken, as is Trichomonas vaginalis NAAT testing in populations where  T. vaginalis is 
detectable in >2% of symptomatic women.

What is new in this updated guideline? 
Diagnosis 
• Urethritis should be confirmed by urethral smear microscopy in symptomatic patients 
• Symptoms and negative urethral smear 
o No empirical treatment. Re-attend for early morning smear if negative NAATs 
and symptoms do not settle 
Investigations 
• All men assessed for STIs, regardless of symptoms, should be tested for C. trachomatis 
from a FVU specimen and for N. gonorrhoeae if they have urethritis. If a NAAT is 
positive for gonorrhoea, a culture should be performed before treatment. 
• 
All men who have sex with men should be tested for both C. trachomatis and N. 
gonorrhoeae from any potentially exposed site.   
• 
Testing male patients with urethritis for M. genitalium, preferably with screening for 
macrolide resistance, is highly likely to improve clinical outcomes. 
Management 
• Recommended syndromic regimen: doxycycline 100mgs twice daily for seven days.  
o Azithromycin 1 gram stat should not be used routinely because of the increased 
risk of inducing macrolide antimicrobial resistance with M. genitalium 
• If M. genitalium-positive: azithromycin 500mgs stat, then 250 mg od for 4 days.  
o A test of cure 3-5 weeks after treatment in those who tested positive for M. 
genitalium should be performed. 
 
Persistent/Recurrent NGU 
• Consider testing for M. genitalium using a NAAT preferably with screening for macrolide 
resistance.  
• Consider testing for Trichomonas vaginalis using a NAAT if it is prevalent in the local 
population (>2% in symptomatic women). 
• Only treat if patient has definite symptoms of urethritis, or physical signs on examination 
AND microscopic evidence of urethritis.

Introduction 
Urethritis, or inflammation of the urethra, is a multifactorial condition which is sexually 
acquired in the majority of cases. It is characterised by discharge, dysuria and/or urethral 
discomfort but may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis of urethritis is confirmed by 
demonstrating an excess of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) in the anterior urethra. 
This is usually assessed using a urethral smear but a first void urine specimen (FVU) can also 
be used. Urethritis is described as either gonococcal, when Neisseria gonorrhoeae is 
detected, or non-gonococcal (NGU) when it is not. The term nonspecific urethritis (NSU) 
applies to non-gonococcal non-chlamydial urethritis and in order to prevent confusion should 
be avoided.  
There are a number of uncertainties with NGU. There is significant inter-observer and intra-
observer error in performing and reading urethral slides and counting PMNLs, especially in 
samples with low grade inflammation.1,2 In many men with urethritis a known pathogen is 
not detected. 3-13 
 
Aetiology 
 
The prevalence of the common organisms associated with NGU in more recent studies is 
listed in table 1. 
 
The commonest organisms implicated are C. trachomatis and M. genitalium, with the latter 
perhaps causing more symptoms.4,5 Chlamydia and M. genitalium are more likely to be 
detected in: 
o Younger patients with NGU, although this association is not as strong for M 
genitalium.3,5,6  
o Those with a urethral discharge and/or dysuria.3,6,7,14 
o C. trachomatis and M. genitalium may be less common in men who have sex 
with men (MSM) than heterosexual men with NGU.15 
o M. genitalium has been associated with balano-posthitis and C. trachomatis 
with a circinate balanitis.16,17  
• The two organisms only infrequently coexist in the same individual with NGU18, but 
dual infections have been identified in up to 10% of men in some studies.3,19  
  
5  
 
• Men with a urethral discharge have a higher bacterial load than those without 
urethritis.20,21 
 
In 30-80% of the cases with NGU neither C. trachomatis nor M. genitalium is detected.3-12 
• The isolation of Trichomonas vaginalis is dependent on the prevalence of the 
organism in the community (22-28).   
• There is good evidence that U. urealyticum causes urethritis in some men but not all 
men.22 Detection even using a nucleic acid amplification test( NAAT) cannot 
distinguish between asymptomatic carriage and possible causality.22   The immune 
response may influence the development of NGU.23 Also, higher organism load 
(>1000 copies/ml of FVU) is a stronger predictor of  NGU.24,25  
o Earlier studies did not differentiate between the two species Ureaplasma 
urealyticum (biovar 2) and U. parvum (biovar 1) which continues to be the 
case if culture alone is used.22 U. parvum is detected more often in controls 
than cases which probably explains why earlier studies failed to demonstrate a 
consistent association of ureaplasmas with NGU.22 
• There is increasing evidence that bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria may cause 
NGU.26-28 
 
• If urinary tract infection is found, young men should be investigated for urinary tract 
abnormalities.29 
• Adenoviruses or Herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 may account for 2-4% of 
symptomatic patients and this may be associated with conjunctivitis.8,30,31 
• N. meningitidis, Haemophilus sp., Candida sp., urethral stricture and foreign bodies 
probably account for a small proportion of NGU, whilst the role of Epstein Barr Virus 
is questionable.32,33  
• What causes organism negative NGU or idiopathic urethritis is unclear. Some of these 
cases are almost certainly non-infective, but we do not currently have the tools to be 
able to differentiate probably non-infective from likely infective cases.34   
 
Asymptomatic urethritis, without an observable discharge, probably has a different aetiology 
from symptomatic urethritis, with C. trachomatis and M. genitalium being detected less 
frequently.4,5,7,35    
  
6  
 
 
This guideline does not recommend testing asymptomatic men with urethral 
microscopy for non-gonococcal urethritis. (III, B) 
 
Clinical features 
 
SYMPTOMS 
• Urethral discharge 
• Dysuria 
• Penile tip irritation 
• Urethral discomfort and/or itch 
• Nil 
 
SIGNS 
• Urethral discharge.  
• Penile tip erythema 
• Normal examination 
 
COMPLICATIONS 
• Epididymo-orchitis  
• Sexually acquired reactive arthritis – acute or chronic 
Diagnosis 
Symptomatic patients and those with a visible discharge should be assessed for the presence 
of urethritis. (IV, C) 
Urethritis should be confirmed by demonstrating PMNLs from the anterior urethra using a 
Gram stained or methylene-blue stained urethral smear, which should contain ≥5 PMNL per 
high power (hpf) (x1000) microscopic field (averaged over five fields with greatest 
concentration of PMNLs).4,36,37   
 
• The quality of the smear is heavily dependent on how the smear is taken and there is 
both inter and intra-observer variation when interpreting the result.1,2 
  
7  
 
Either a 5 mm plastic loop or cotton tipped swab can be used, which should be introduced 
about 1 cm into the urethra.38 (1b) Other methods are also used, including a sterile blunt 
curette or spatula.39 (C) 
• Based on reported sensitivities of microscopy for detection of chlamydia, blunt curette 
is more sensitive than a loop which is better than a swab.4,39-41 (III) 
• If a urethral discharge is present the smear can be sampled without placing the device 
inside the meatus.38  (IV, C) 
• A viral aetiology is likely if the leukocytes are predominantly mononuclear.31 
 
An FVU specimen can be examined for threads and if present these can be stained and 
interpreted as for a spun deposit ( ≥10 PMNL/hpf indicates urethritis).11,42 (III, B) 
 
 
Management of symptomatic patients with a negative urethral smear 
• If the urethral smear is normal the patient can be reassured and advised to re-attend 
for an early morning smear if his symptoms do not settle. He should be advised to 
hold his urine overnight and to attend not having voided urine. It is good practice to 
advise the patient to take their last drink at about 8 pm and to void about 3 hours later 
in order to help avoid waking with a full bladder. (IV, C) 
o A leukocyte esterase dipstick on the remains of the FVU specimen may be 
used to detect urethritis in symptomatic men with a negative urethral 
smear.(54)(IV, C) 
• Empirical treatment without verifying the presence of urethritis is not recommended 
as there is a risk it may perpetuate their symptoms.(IV) This treatment should only be 
given in exceptional circumstances and their partner(s) should also be treated. 
The sensitivity of the smear test for diagnosing urethritis, but probably not the FVU in 
detecting chlamydia 43,44, is affected by the period since last passing urine. The optimum time 
to ensure a definite diagnosis in a symptomatic man is not known, 2-4 hours is conventional. 
(IV,C) 
 
Managing patients in settings in which microscopy is not available 
  
8  
 
Symptomatic patients should be strongly encouraged to attend a centre which has microscopy 
available because the sensitivity and specificity of other methods for diagnosing urethritis is 
imperfect compared to a urethral smear.  When microscopy is not available the following can 
be used to make a diagnosis of urethritis: (IV, C)  
• The presence of a mucopurulent or purulent urethral discharge on examination 
• ≥1+ on a leukocyte esterase dipstick on an FVU specimen.(see above) 
• The presence of threads in a FVU specimen. 45,46 Threads may be physiological e.g. 
semen. 
Investigations 
• Men assessed for STIs should be tested for C. trachomatis from first void urine, 
regardless of symptoms.   
• Men should be tested for N. gonorrhoeae if they have a urethritis. 
• If N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis positive, management should be as specified in 
the European guidelines. 
• Testing male patients with urethritis for M. genitalium, preferably with screening for 
macrolide resistance is highly likely to improve clinical outcomes.47 Testing for M. 
genitalium is therefore recommended. 
• In men with symptoms strongly suggestive of a urinary tract infection  - for example, 
severe dysuria, haematuria (microscopic or macroscopic), nocturia, urinary frequency, 
urgency, or is at low risk for a sexually transmitted infection, a urinary dipstick 
analysis on a mid-stream urine specimen should be considered and the sample sent for 
culture and sensitivities.29  Although a urinary dipstick is only  68-88% sensitive, it is 
inexpensive and a useful screening test.29  If a urinary tract infection is confirmed 
consider further urological assessment. (IV, C) 
 
GENERAL ADVICE 
The following should be discussed and clear written information provided: 
• An explanation of the causes of NGU, including non-infective causes, and possible 
short term and long term implications for the health of the patient and his partner. 
• The side effects of treatment 
• The importance of: 
o complying with their sex partner(s) being evaluated and treated 
o complying with any follow-up arrangements 
  
9  
 
• Advice to abstain from sexual intercourse, including for oral sex, until he and his 
current partner(s) have completed therapy (IV) 
• .Advice on safer sex  
• .Patient information: http://iusti.org/regions/Europe/PatientInformation.htm 
 
Treatment 
Men with severe symptoms should be treated as soon as the diagnosis is made and without 
waiting for the chlamydia, gonorrhoea and M. genitalium test results. In men with mild 
symptoms and microscopically proven low grade urethritis (5-15 PMNLs/hpf), another 
option is to review the patient after 3-7 days, preferably for an early morning smear, with the 
results of the NAAT(s) (including M. genitalium) and gonorrhoea culture as sometimes 
urethritis can resolve without treatment.48  If laboratory tests are positive, or he has persistent 
microscopic urethritis, microorganism guided antimicrobial treatment can be administered at 
the second visit.  
Ideally, treatment should be effective (microbiological cure >95%), easy to take (twice daily 
or less), with a low side effect profile, and cause minimal interference with daily lifestyle. 
However, assessing treatment efficacy is difficult as persistence of inflammation may not 
indicate persistent infection.11,49,50 Detectable inflammation may persist for an unknown 
length of time, even when the putative organism has been eliminated.51 Two recent large 
randomised controlled trials from the United States observed that both doxycycline and 
azithromycin are <85% effective with regard to clinical cure.13,52  
 
RECOMMENDED REGIMENS (GRADE OF RECOMMENDATION A) 
Doxycycline 100 mgs twice daily (bd) or 200 mgs once daily (od) orally for 7 days (Ib) 
SECOND LINE REGIMENS (III, C) 
Azithromycin 500 mgs single dose (stat) then 250mgs od for 4 days or Azithromycin 1 gram 
stat 
(Azithromycin 1 gram stat should not be used routinely because of the increased risk of 
inducing macrolide antimicrobial resistance with M. genitalium.47,53) 
Lymecycline 300mgs bd for 10 days 
Tetracycline hydrochloride 500mgs bd for 10 days 
If patient is M. genitalium-positive  
  
10  
 
Azithromycin 500 mgs stat, then 250 mgs od for 4 days (see above) (III, C) 
 
• Doxycycline 100 mgs bd for 7 days is > 95% effective in men who are chlamydia-
positive,13,52,54-57 and as effective (70-80%) as azithromycin 1 gram in men who are U. 
urealyticum-positive.58-60  
• Azithromycin 1 gram is associated with development of macrolide resistance in M. 
genitalium,13,52,53,61-63 is likely to increase macrolide resistant strains in the 
population,47,53,64,65 and has a reduced efficacy in chlamydia-positive men with 
urethritis.55,66,67  The efficacy of Azithromycin may be lower than 80% depending on 
background macrolide resistance in population47,62,64,68, and M. genitalium-positive 
men who fail therapy with 1 gram are at high risk of developing a 23sRNA gene 
mutation conferring macrolide resistance.53,69-73 If this were to occur, an extended 5 
day azithromycin regimen would not be effective at eradicating the infection. 
47,64,68,74,75  
• Azithromycin for 5 days (500mgs stat then 250mgs od for 4 days) is about 95% 
effective in eradicating macrolide susceptible M. genitalium and may be more 
effective at eradicating chlamydia in men with urethritis.47,67,69,76,77 It appears to 
induce macrolide antimicrobial resistance at a lower rate than the 1 gram regimen, 
although there is limited literature evaluating this.53,69,76 Although macrolide 
antimicrobial resistance in M. genitalium appears to be worldwide and possibly 
increasing it is probably <40% in the majority of countries.47,64,65,71,75,78,79  
• Although never evaluated, using 1gram instead of 500mgs on day 1 maintains the 
benefits of single dose therapy, and is likely to improve microbiological cure rates and 
reduce the risk of macrolide resistance developing in M. genitalium. (IV) 
• Lymecycline 300 mgs bd for 10 days or tetracycline hydrochloride 500 mgs bd for 10 
days are probably > 95% effective in men who are chlamydia-positive.80.Unlike 
doxycycline, these antibiotics do not induce photosensitivity. 
 
Sexual contacts/partners 
All sexual partners at risk should be assessed and offered epidemiological treatment, 
maintaining patient confidentiality. The duration of “look back” is arbitrary; 4 weeks is 
suggested for symptomatic men. Partner(s) notification and management should be carried 
out with sensitivity, considering socio-cultural issues and avoiding stigma. 
  
11  
 
Current partner(s) should be tested and treated and the patient advised not to be sexually 
active until all have completed treatment. 
If C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae are detected it is important to ensure that all sexual 
partner(s) potentially at risk have been notified and managed as detailed in the European 
Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea guidelines.  
(available at http://www.iusti.org/regions/europe/euroguidelines.htm)  
• Details of all contacts should be obtained at the first visit. Consent should also be 
obtained so that if C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium are detected 
subsequently and the index patient does not re-attend, he can be contacted and/or 
provider referral can be initiated for sexual contacts (IV, C). 
 
In a study conducted before NAAT for C. trachomatis and M. genitalium was available there 
was no evidence of treatment benefit to partners of men with chlamydia-negative NGU.81 
There are, however, a number of issues which may influence decision making. 
• M. genitalium accounts for approximately 15-30% of cases and there is a high 
concordance of infection in sexual partners.82 M. genitalium probably causes 
disease in women and is a co-factor in HIV transmission.14,47,83 
• There are reports of patients with persistent or recurrent ureaplasma-positive  
urethritis being cured only after their sexual partner received appropriate 
treatment.84  
Follow up for patients with NGU 
Patients with persistence of any symptoms however slight at three weeks should be asked to 
return to the clinic and if confirmed persistent urethritis retreated with appropriate regimen 
(see below) and the possibility of re-infection explored. (IV, C) A test of cure 3-4weeks after 
treatment in those who tested positive for M genitalium should be performed 85. 
If chlamydia is confirmed (see European guideline), a test of cure is not recommended to be 
routinely performed in uncomplicated urethritis.  
 
Persistent and recurrent NGU 
Persistent NGU, when symptoms do not resolve following treatment, can result from both 
treatment failure and re-infection. It occurs in 15-25% of patients following initial treatment 
of acute NGU. Recurrent NGU is empirically defined as the recurrence of  symptomatic 
  
12  
 
urethritis occurring 30-90 days following treatment of acute NGU11 and occurs in 10-20% of 
patients.11,86  
 
The aetiology of persistent NGU is probably multifactorial with an infectious agent being 
identified in <50% of cases.6,11,74,86 M. genitalium has been identified in 20-40%6,11,74,87 and 
C. trachomatis in 10%-20% of men treated with azithromycin 1gram.52 U. urealyticum may 
also play a role in some men, but urethritis appears to resolve despite persistent 
infection.11,58,60,88 Trichomonas vaginalis can be identified in up to 10% of populations where 
it is endemic.6  Herpes simplex virus should also be considered as this can cause dysuria 
without signs outside the urethra. 
 
Any treatment of persistent NGU should cover M. genitalium, T. vaginalis and probably BV 
associated bacteria.25,28,89 The only randomised controlled trial for persistent NGU was 
undertaken before M. genitalium had been identified as an important pathogen (but before 
macrolide resistance was common)  and used erythromycin, an older generation macrolide.90  
Although a 3 week course was better than placebo it is not clear how relevant this regimen is 
today, given that better macrolides are available with less side effects.91 
It is likely that re-treatment of the sexual partner and index case will be beneficial if 
persistent/recurrent NGU in the index case resolves following extended therapy, but 
subsequently recurs. This remains an area where further research is needed. (IV, C) 
 
DIAGNOSIS OF PERSISTENT/RECURRENT NGU (IV, C) 
• Only undertake a Gram or methylene blue stained urethral smear in men who are 
symptomatic. 
• For those patients with confirmed chlamydia at initial presentation please refer to 
European Chlamydia guideline for further guidance on repeat NAAT testing.  
• Test for M. genitalium using a NAAT, including screening for macrolide resistance if 
not undertaken at presentation.  
• Consider testing for Trichomonas vaginalis using a NAAT if available, if it is 
prevalent (>2% in symptomatic women) in the local population. 
 
RECOMMENDED REGIMENS – second attendance or first follow-up visit 
  
13  
 
Patient symptomatic or an observable discharge present AND microscopic evidence of 
urethritis.  11,14,50,69,92 
 
Doxycycline prescribed as first line therapy 
Azithromycin 500 mgs then 250mg for the next 4 days (III, B) 
plus metronidazole 400 mgs twice daily for 5 days (IV, C) 
NB if macrolide resistant M. genitalium is detected moxifloxacin should be 
substituted for azithromycin (see below) 
 
Azithromycin prescribed first line therapy 
Moxifloxacin 400 mgs orally once daily for 7-14 days (III, B) 
plus metronidazole 400 mgs twice daily for 5 days (IV, C) 
 
NB: moxifloxacin should be used with caution and reserved for treatment failures 
which are thought secondary to macrolide resistant M. genitalium, because of rare but 
serious adverse reactions. Australia successfully uses a 10 day course and Nordic 
countries a 7 day course whilst no treatment failures have been identified using a 14 
day regimen in the UK. 47,69,93,94.  However a recent study suggests a 14 day course is 
more effective than a seven day course in eradicating M. genitalium in women with 
cervicitis.95 In patients having contracted M. genitalium infection in South-East-Asia, 
dual resistance to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones are currently around 10%. 
Such infections are difficult to treat and only pristinamycin (registered in France) has 
proven effective on a case basis.75  
 
 
CONTINUING SYMPTOMS 
There is only limited evidence on how best to manage patients who either remain 
symptomatic following a second course of treatment, or who have frequent recurrences after 
treatment. Testing for M. genitalium is essential to guide management.  
• Moxifloxacin 400mgs orally once daily for 7-14 days (IIIb, B) 
• Urological investigation is usually normal unless the patient has urinary flow 
problems 96,97  and is not recommended. (IV, C) 
  
14  
 
• The chronic pelvic pain syndrome should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis.90,98,99
