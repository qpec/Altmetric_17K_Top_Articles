IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, little research has examined concussion across the
youth/adolescent spectrum and even less has examined concussion-related outcomes (ie,
symptoms and return to play).
OBJECTIVE To examine and compare sport-related concussion outcomes (symptoms and
return to play) in youth, high school, and collegiate football athletes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Athletic trainers attended each practice and game
during the 2012 to 2014 seasons and reported injuries. For this descriptive, epidemiological
study, data were collected from youth, high school, and collegiate football teams, and the
analysis of the data was conducted between July 2015 and September 2015. The Youth
Football Surveillance System included more than 3000 youth football athletes aged 5 to 14
years from 118 teams, providing 310 team seasons (ie, 1 team providing 1 season of data). The
National Athletic Treatment, Injury, and Outcomes Network Program included 96 secondary
school football programs, providing 184 team seasons. The National Collegiate Athletic
Association Injury Surveillance Program included 34 college football programs, providing 71
team seasons.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the mean number of symptoms, prevalence
of each symptom, and the proportion of patients with concussions that had long
return-to-play time (ie, required participation restriction of at least 30 days). Generalized
linear models were used to assess differences among competition levels in the mean number
of reported symptoms. Logistic regression models estimated the odds of return to play at less
than 24 hours and at least 30 days.
RESULTS Overall, 1429 sports-related concussions were reported among youth, high school,
and college-level football athletes with a mean (SD) of 5.48 (3.06) symptoms. Across all
levels, 15.3% resulted return to play at least 30 days after the concussion and 3.1% resulted in
return to play less than 24 hours after the concussion. Compared with youth, a higher
number of concussion symptoms were reported in high school athletes (β = 1.39; 95% CI,
0.55-2.24). Compared with college athletes, the odds of return to play at least 30 days after
injury were larger in youth athletes (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.10- 6.85) and high school
athletes (odds ratio, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.61-5.19). The odds of return to play less than 24 hours
after injury were larger in youth athletes than high school athletes (odds ratio, 6.23; 95% CI,
1.02-37.98).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Differences in concussion-related outcomes existed by level
of competition and may be attributable to genetic, biologic, and/or developmental
differences or level-specific variations in concussion-related policies and protocols, athlete
training management, and athlete disclosure. Given the many organizational, social
environmental, and policy-related differences at each level of competition that were not
measured in this study, further study is warranted to validate our findings.

A 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine8 highlighted the
need for more extensive concussion data in athletes aged 5 to
21 years, which encompasses youth, high school, and colle-
giate athletes. High school and collegiate athletes have been
well studied in the past decade9-12; however, youth sports con-
cussions remain understudied.13 A 2015 study14 found that the
1-year concussion risk in youth football was lower than that
in high school and college football.
Previous research across all levels of competition has in-
dicated that common self-reported concussion-related symp-
toms were headache, dizziness, and confusion.15-21 Surveil-
lance data of high school athletes showed that 23% of
concussions resulted in return to play within 1 week of injury,12
compared with 37% of collegiate athletes.9 Research sug-
gests that high school athletes may take longer to recover af-
ter concussion both symptomatically and on neurocognitive
testing.22-24However,thereisalackofrelatedresearchinyouth
athletes, although puberty and brain development may affect
concussion-related outcomes.25,26 Therefore, the purpose of
this study was to examine sport-related concussion out-
comes, including symptoms and return to play, in youth, high
school, and collegiate football athletes.
Methods
Data were collected as part of 3 injury surveillance programs:
(1)theYouthFootballSafetyStudy;(2)theNationalAthleticTreat-
ment, Injury, and Outcomes Network; and (3) the National Col-
legiateAthleticAssociation(NCAA)InjurySurveillanceProgram.
TheYouthFootballSafetyStudyincludedyouthfootballathletes
aged 5 to 14 years from 118 teams, providing 310 team seasons
(ie,1teamproviding1seasonofdata).TheNationalAthleticTreat-

obtainedbecauseall3surveillancestudiesweredeemedexempt.
Protocol
At all 3 levels of competition, at least 1 athletic trainer at-
tended each practice and game during the 2012 to 2014 sea-
sons and reported concussion and exposure data via their pre-
ferred injury documentation application. Athletic trainers
completed a detailed report on the injury circumstances such
as event type (ie, competition or practice). Injury documen-
tation applications worked with Datalys to ensure that data
were collected in similar manners across systems and levels
of competition (Datalys Center Inc).
A reportable injury in all 3 surveillance programs was an
injuryoccurringasaresultofparticipationinanorganizedprac-
tice/game and requiring attention from an athletic trainer or
physician. We did not provide a definition of concussion be-
cause we relied on the medical expertise of the athletic trainer
or physician providing data, although they were encouraged
to follow the definition provided by the Consensus State-
ment on Concussion in Sport.7 All concussions were assessed
by athletic trainers and/or physicians. At the youth level, all
concussions were required to have physician clearance to re-
turntoplayfollowingconcussion.Atthehighschoollevel,con-
cussion management was determined locally by the institu-
tionorstateguidelines.Atthecollegiatelevel,NCAAlegislation
passed in 2010 required approval from a physician and/or phy-
sician designee before returning an athlete to play.
For all levels, when a concussion occurred, student ath-
letes reported symptoms associated with the concussion. For
youth athletes, information from both the parents/guardians
and the athletes were used to determine concussion symp-
toms; this may have required athletic trainers to follow up with
parents/guardians. Symptoms were selected from a 17-item
yes/no checklist. In grouping symptoms, we used a modifica-
tion of the Lau et al20 symptom clusters (cognitive, migraine,
neuropsychiatric, and sleep). The migraine cluster included
headache, dizziness, sensitivity to light/noise, nausea/
vomiting, tinnitus, loss of balance, and visual disturbance. The
cognitive cluster included posttraumatic amnesia, retro-
grade amnesia, difficulty concentrating, disorientation, loss of
consciousness, and excess drowsiness. The neuropsychiatric
clusterincludedexcessiveexcitabilityandirritability.Thesleep
cluster included insomnia. After initially inputting injury
data,athletictrainerscouldreturntoupdatesymptoms,suchas
delayed onset of symptoms, as needed. Thus, our symptom

Key Points
Question How do concussion outcomes differ among youth, high
school, and college football athletes?
Findings In this descriptive, epidemiological study of 1429
sports-related concussions, concussions in high school football
had the highest mean number of reported symptoms, followed by
college and youth. The proportion of concussions with
return-to-play time of at least 30 days was the highest in high
school athletes, followed by youth and college athletes.
Meaning There are differences in concussion outcomes across
levels of competition in football, which could be attributed to
biologic differences or organizational, social-environmental, and
policy-related differences.

Athletic trainers selected from a categorical variable for re-
turn-to-play time (ie, the time required for full return to sports
participation).Return-to-playtimewascategorizedaslessthan
24 hours, 24 hours to 6 days, 7 to 13 days, 14 to 29 days, and
30 or more days. Concussions that resulted in a long time to
return to play were those requiring at least 30 days before re-
turntoplayorresultingintheathletesprematurelyendingtheir
season.
From the electronic health record applications, common
data elements that included injury and exposure information
werestrippedofanypersonallyidentifiableinformation.28This
common data element standard allowed the athletic trainers
to document injuries as they normally would as part of their
daily clinical practice. All electronic health record applica-
tions must have successfully completed a data-validation pro-
cess to be certified. All 3 programs used the same technology,
method, and common data elements with slight variations
accommodating for setting and level of competition.27,28
Exported data passed through an automated verification
processthatconductedaseriesofconsistencychecks.Datawere
reviewedandflaggedforinvalidvalues.Theathletictrainerand
data quality assurance staff were notified and worked to-
gether to resolve the issue. Data that passed the verification
process were then placed into the aggregate data sets.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed to assess patterns of concussion out-
comes sustained in all 3 levels of football. Our 3 outcomes were
the mean number of reported symptoms, the prevalence of
each symptom, and return-to-play time. The mean number of
symptoms presenting with concussions were calculated for all
symptoms and the Lau et al20 symptom clusters. Cases with
missing outcome data were excluded from analyses.
To account for clustering within league in youth football
and within team in high school and college football, general-
ized estimating equations with an exchangeable covariance
structure were used for all analyses. Clusters (league or team)
were based on the level at which each athletic trainer covered
football. Generalized linear models (identity link and normal
distribution) were used to assess differences among compe-
tition levels in the mean number of reported symptoms over-
all and within the Lau et al20 symptom clusters. Generalized
linear models (logit link and binary distribution) estimated the
odds of return to play at less than 24 hours and at 30 days or
more. Bonferroni corrections accounted for the 3 compari-
sons conducted for each outcome (youth vs high school; youth
vs college; and high school vs college). Data were analyzed
using SAS-Enterprise Guide software, version 5.1 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc).
Results
Overall Findings
During the 2012 to 2014 seasons, a total of 1429 concussions
were reported across all 3 levels of competition (Table 1). A
mean (SD) of 5.48 (3.06) symptoms were reported across all
concussions (Table 2). In addition, a mean (SD) of 1.51 (1.29)
cognitive symptoms and 3.57 (1.88) migraine symptoms were
reported. The most commonly reported symptoms were head-
ache (n=1331 [94.3%]), dizziness (n=1059 [75.0%]), and diffi-
culty concentrating (n=854 [60.5%]; Table 3). In addition, 219

after injury, and 3.1% resulted in return to play less than 24
hours after injury (Table 4).
Comparisons Across Levels of Competition
Mean Number of Reported Symptoms
Concussions in high school football had the highest mean (SD)
number of reported symptoms (5.60 [3.16]), followed by col-
lege (5.56 [3.03]) and youth (4.76 [2.58]) (Table 2). Compared
with youth, a higher number of concussion symptoms were
reported in high school (β = 1.39; 95% CI, 0.55-2.24). No dif-
ferenceswerefoundbetweencollegeandyouth(β = 0.88;95%
CI, −0.02 to 1.45) and high school and college (β = 0.51; 95%
CI, −0.27 to 1.29). No differences were found between com-
petition levels when restricting analyses to migraine symp-
toms.Whenrestrictinganalysestocognitivesymptoms,higher
mean numbers of symptoms were reported in college ath-
letes (β = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.06-0.78) and high school athletes

athletes reported a higher mean number of neurocognitive
symptoms than youth (β = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.25). Higher
mean number of sleep symptoms were reported in college ath-
letes (β = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.14-0.31) and high school athletes
(β = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.13-0.26) than in youth athletes.
Return-to-Play Time
Distributions of return-to-play time varied by level of compe-
tition (Table 4). High school athletes had the highest propor-
tion of concussions with return to play of at least 30 days
(19.5%), followed by youth (16.3%) and college athletes (7.0%).
In the logistic regression model accounting for clusters by
league/team, the odds of return to play of at least 30 days was
larger in youth (odds ratio [OR], 2.75; 95% CI, 1.10-6.85) and

and youth athletes (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.47-2.36).
Youth athletes had the highest proportion of concussions
with return to play of less than 24 hours (10.1%), followed by
college (4.7%) and high school athletes (0.8%; Table 4). In the
logistic regression model accounting for clusters by league/
team, the odds of return to play less than 24 hours in youth
was larger than that in high school athletes (OR, 6.23; 95% CI,
1.02-37.98).Differenceswerenotfoundbetweenyouthandcol-
lege athletes (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.39-8.27) and college and high

Discussion
The Institute of Medicine has called for further research re-
garding the incidence of concussion in athletes aged 5 to 21
years.8 Along with incidence research, it is equally important
for those managing concussions to understand the symp-
toms and outcomes among this age group and variations by
level of competition. To our knowledge, our study is the first
to explore concussion-related symptoms and return-to-play
time in youth, high school, and college football athletes. Our
findings suggest an association between level of competition
and these outcomes and highlight the need for future re-
search to continue exploring how the epidemiology of sports-
related concussion varies across the lifespan.
The mean reported number of concussion-related symp-
toms was lowest in youth football athletes. In particular, youth
reported less cognitive and sleep symptoms. Of note, very few
concussions across all 3 levels resulted in loss of conscious-
ness, further highlighting the limited utility of that symptom
in diagnosing concussion. We caution interpretation of these
findings because the understanding of the symptoms may
vary by the age of those reporting. Interviews with the ath-
letic trainers evaluating youth football athletes cited unfa-
miliarity with the youth population as the greatest challenge
in assessing concussion, also noting that young children may
lack understanding of concussion symptoms.29 Such chal-
lenges may have led to youth athletes reporting symptoms
differently from their older counterparts.29,30 We used par-
ent feedback to better obtain concussion symptoms in their
children, although this may have also introduced bias.
Although the use of similar symptom checklists across all 3
competition levels increased comparability, future prospec-
tive surveillance research should use available child-
oriented symptom checklists30 that were not available dur-
ing the study timeframe.
High school football athletes reported the highest num-
ber of symptoms and the longest return-to-play time. Our re-
sults are consistent with many reports of younger athletes
taking longer to recover23,31,32 but also contrast other find-
ings. Covassin et al33 evaluated 150 high school and 72 colle-
giate athletes who had sustained a concussion and found no
differences by level of play in total number of symptoms re-
portedandtheproportionreturnedtobaselinesymptomscores
by day 14 postinjury.33 A retrospective study of symptoms in
clinical medical records of 184 high school and collegiate ath-
letes found no differences in symptom presence, symptom se-
verity, or return to baseline symptom scores using reliable
change index methods.24 In contrast, Cantu et al34 examined
a specialty clinic sample and found that compared with ath-
letes with concussions younger than 18 years, those aged 18
years and older experienced a greater number and longer du-
ration of symptoms. In contrast, Field et al22 found that high
school football and girls’soccer athletes with concussions had
increased postconcussive symptoms relative to control par-
ticipants on day 5 after injury, whereas college football and
women’
s soccer athletes had no significant differences from
control participants by day 5.
There are many possible reasons for the age differences we
observed.Theremaybeagedifferencesowingtobiologicalfac-
tors, such as puberty and brain development, that occur in
youth and high school athletes. Researchers have shown that
during adolescence, the brain undergoes a structural reorga-
nization in which white matter increases and gray matter
peaks.25,26 The increase in white matter is typically seen as an
increase in axonal myelination.26 Gray matter has been shown
to increase in the brain during childhood but then reaches a
peak in adolescence, plateaus, and decreases through
adulthood.25,26 These changes in brain development may re-
sult in increases in reported cognitive deficiencies. However,
some age differences may be related to organizational differ-
ences at each level of competition. High school students have
longer durations of class without breaks, which prolong symp-
tomrecovery.Additionally,highschoolstudentsgenerallyhave
less access to resources regularly available in college pro-
grams (eg, medical professionals, neurologists, tutors, and
time-management advisors). However, research on how these
level-specific variations in resource allocation and setting may
be associated with recovery and return to play is lacking, war-
ranting additional research.
Across all 3 levels, a number of athletes with concussions
returned to play less than 24 hours after injury. In youth foot-
ball, 1 in 10 athletes with concussions returned to play less than
24 hours after injury. Such findings may be the result of ath-
letes presenting with delayed concussion symptoms, disagree-
ment between athletic trainers and physicians, or difficulty of
youth in reporting symptoms.30 For example, given no signs
of concussion, an athletic trainer must rely on athletes’re-
porting of symptoms, which may not occur until days after the
event. If the athlete participated in any games or practices,
the athletic trainer would note the athlete returned in less
than 24 hours. At the youth level, procedures required all
student athletes to attain physician approval before return-
ing to play, and it is possible the physician disagreed with
the athletic trainers’assessment of concussion and provided
approval for the student athlete to return the next day. It was
not logistically possible to assess athletic trainer–physician
agreement. Youth football athletes may also struggle to iden-
tify symptoms and express how they feel to athletic trainers,
which may result in misdiagnosis that is not corrected until
symptoms persist.30 It is imperative to educate athletic
trainers, parents, coaches, and officials on recognition and
management of concussions in youth. This should include
strategies on how to effectively elicit symptoms in this

There were limitations to the study. Our study aimed to
examine differences associated with concussion outcomes in
3 levels of competition; however, our study did not evaluate
the many organizational, social, environmental, and policy-
related factors that may differ at each level of competition.
Our study also did not track individual demographics that
modify concussion outcomes, such as previous concussions
and learning disabilities, which could differ across competi-
tion levels. In addition, it is unclear whether individuals with
concussions described symptoms or disclosed concussions
differently by level of competition. These issues may be more
prevalent in younger athletes that are unable to fully compre-
hend concussion symptoms. Future research that considers
these factors is warranted.
The number of athletic trainers varied by level of compe-
tition and may contribute to observed variability. Many col-
leges and universities have more than 1 athletic trainer on staff
for football, but most high schools and all youth sites only had
1 athletic trainer, possibly leading to more missed cases than
in college football. The samples from all 3 programs are con-
venience samples, which may limit generalizability to non-
participating teams and other sports, particularly those with
female participants. Given that only 3 seasons of data were ex-
amined, it is difficult to ascertain temporal trends; additional
seasons of prospective data collection are warranted.
We did not provide a definition of concussion to the ath-
letic trainers reporting injuries, although they were encour-
aged to use the definition provided by the Consensus State-
ment on Concussion in Sport.7 To lessen data collection
burden, return to play was a categorical measure, which may
result in bias and losses in efficiency compared with data
captured as continuous variables. Return to play was also left
to the discretion of the clinicians and was therefore not stan-
dardized. Rather than examining symptom prevalence across
recovery, our measure was an aggregate of symptoms re-
ported at any point during recovery.
Finally, despite comprehensive quality-control proce-
dures,includingdataentrytraining,real-timeautomatedrange
and consistency checks, and human verification, we relied on
athletic trainers to enter data into the injury documentation
application. Therefore, if a participating athletic trainer chose
not to enter data, we could not recover that missing data. How-
ever, the percentage of missing data is minimal (<3%) across
each level of competition.
Conclusions
Injury surveillance programs are essential in driving the de-
velopment of evidence-based concussion prevention and poli-
cies. To our knowledge, this was the first study to exclusively
examine and compare concussion-related symptoms and re-
turn-to-play time in youth, high school, and collegiate foot-
ball athletes. Our study found that the mean reported num-
ber of concussion-related symptoms was higher in high school
and collegiate athletes than in youth athletes. Collegiate foot-
ball athletes also reported a higher mean number of cognitive
symptoms compared with youth athletes, demonstrating dif-
ferences in concussion symptoms between levels of compe-
tition. Also, very few concussions resulted in loss of conscious-
ness, further highlighting the limited utility of that symptom
in diagnosing concussion. These data provide the most com-
mon symptoms across levels of play, providing clinicians some
guidance as to which symptoms should be minimally in-
cluded in an assessment. High school athletes had the high-
est proportion of concussions with a long return-to-play
time. Given that our study did not measure individual char-
acteristics, as well as the many level-specific organizational,
social-environmental, and policy-related factors, further re-
search is warranted to validate our findings.
