Summary
Background: Irritable bowel syndrome is the most frequent gastrointestinal disor-
der. It is assumed that lifestyle interventions might be a rational treatment
approach.
Aim: To examine the effect of a yoga-based intervention vs a low-FODMAP diet
on patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
Methods: Fifty-nine patients with irritable bowel syndrome undertook a single-
blind, randomised controlled trial involving yoga or a low-FODMAP diet for
12 weeks. Patients in the yoga group received two sessions weekly, while patients
in the low-FODMAP group received a total of three sessions of nutritional coun-
selling. The primary outcome was a change in gastrointestinal symptoms (IBS-SSS).
Secondary outcomes explored changes in quality of life (IBS-QOL), health (SF-36),
perceived stress (CPSS, PSQ), body awareness (BAQ), body responsiveness (BRS)
and safety of the interventions. Outcomes were examined in weeks 12 and 24 by
assessors “blinded” to patients’ group allocation.
Results: No statistically significant difference was found between the intervention
groups, with regard to IBS-SSS score, at either 12 (D = 31.80; 95%CI = �11.90,
75.50; P = .151) or 24 weeks (D = 33.41; 95%CI = �4.21, 71.04; P = .081). Within-
group comparisons showed statistically significant effects for yoga and low-FOD-
MAP diet at both 12 and 24 weeks (all P < .001). Comparable within-group effects
occurred for the other outcomes. One patient in each intervention group experi-
enced serious adverse events (P = 1.00) and another, also in each group, experi-
enced nonserious adverse events (P = 1.00).
Conclusions: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome might benefit from yoga and a
low-FODMAP diet, as both groups showed a reduction in gastrointestinal symp-
toms. More research on the underlying mechanisms of both interventions is
warranted, as well as exploration of potential benefits from their combined use.

BACKGROUND
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) describes a group of symptoms,
including abdominal pain or discomfort, and changes in bowel move-
ment patterns and defecation, for which a correlation between
pathophysiology and symptoms is mostly lacking.1 IBS is the most
common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder.2 Its diagnosis is
based on criteria devised by the Rome Foundation.3 Although almost
60% of IBS patients claim that certain foods trigger their symptoms,
eliminating those foods from their diet often leads to only minor
symptom improvements.4 A recent treatment option for IBS is the
use of a low Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides and Polyol
(FODMAP) diet, which focuses on restricting fermentable, short-
chain carbohydrates, including galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides
(GOS, FOS), disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose) and
polyols (such as sorbitol and mannitol). This diet produces gastroin-
testinal symptom relief by reducing the fermentable load on the
colon, in order to reduce gas production and luminal distension.5
Past theorists have hypothesised that irritable bowel syndrome is
partly caused by visceral hypersensitivity and psychosocial factors,
with links between such factors as disturbed stress regulation and
autonomic nervous system dysfunction and the condition’s patho-
physiology.6,7 Psychiatric comorbidities are also common in patients
with IBS.8 Yoga, based on an ancient Indian philosophy, has been
adapted for use in complementary medicine, especially with regard
to preventing and treating of disease.9 Traditionally, yoga consists of
body postures (sanskrit: Asana), breathing exercises (Pranayama) and
meditation (Dhyana); a practice to “still the mind.”10,11 It is hypothe-
sised that yoga practice corrects stress-induced underactivity of the
parasympathetic nervous system.12 Yoga has been shown to reduce
stress and psychological distress, in varied patient populations.13-18 It
may prove equally effective in improving the symptoms of IBS.19
The primary purpose of this study was to analyse the effectiveness
of a yoga-based intervention compared to the use of a low-FOD-
MAP diet in treating the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with
IBS. The secondary goal was to determine these interventions’
potential effects on patients’ perceived quality of life, perceived
stress and health status, body awareness and responsiveness; whilst
considering the safety of these treatments.

METHODS
2.1
|
Study design and drop-out rate
This single-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted in the
Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, at the Kliniken
Essen-Mitte; based in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of
Duisburg-Essen in Essen, Germany. The study was approved by the
University of Duisburg-Essen’s Ethics Committee (Approval No: 15-
6653-BO), and registered on the website ClinicalTrials.gov (Registra-
tion No: NCT02721836), prior to patient recruitment. The study was
conducted and reported in line with the consolidated standards of
reporting trials (2010) guidelines.20
2.2

Patients
Patients were recruited by the Department of Internal and Integra-
tive Medicine via advertisements online and in the local press in
March and April 2016. Individuals who responded were screened by
a research assistant to assess their eligibility. Those who appeared to
be eligible were invited for an assessment conducted by a study
physician. Stool analysis was used to determine the presence or
absence of faecal lactoferrin as a marker of intestinal inflammation.
Individuals who met the study inclusion criteria, and did not meet its
exclusion criteria, were included in the trial. Participants received
detailed oral and written information about the study. Those who
wished to proceed signed a consent form to demonstrate their
informed consent.
Male and female patients were included if they were between
18 and 75 years old, had suffered from diagnosed IBS for at least
6 months and met the ‘Rome-III’ criteria. No restrictions were placed
on the IBS-type. To participate, patients had also to be physically
and mentally capable of performing yoga exercises. The study exclu-
sion criteria included a concentration of faecal lactoferrin > 7 mg/g,
the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, complete resection of
the colon, ongoing acute infection, concurrent disease that precluded
even light yoga exercise, pregnancy and regular yoga practice or
nutrition counselling in the previous 12 months.

Randomisation
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to yoga or nutrition counselling
by block-randomisation with randomly varying block lengths, strati-
fied by a history or nonhistory of diagnosed depression. The ran-
domisation list was created by a biometrician, not involved in the
study’s patient recruitment or assessment, using the Random alloca-
tion software.21 The list was password-secured and accessible only
by the biometrician concerned. The latter prepared sealed, sequen-
tially numbered, opaque envelopes containing the treatment assign-
ments, based on this list. After the study’s baseline assessments had
been
conducted,
and
written
consent
information
had
been
obtained, the physician opened the lowest-numbered envelope to
reveal each patient’s assignment.

Interventions
2.4.1
|
Yoga
The yoga intervention included traditional hatha yoga group sessions
of 75 minutes duration twice weekly for a period of 12 weeks. The
yoga intervention was designed by a certified hatha yoga instructor,
prior to the intervention, and was specifically customised for patients
with IBS. Those yoga postures and breathing techniques thought to
relax the body and mind, as well as asana (poses) traditionally
thought to influence the digestive organs positively, were included
(see supporting information).11 The study’s yoga intervention was
provided by the same yoga instructor throughout. She guided
204 |

 patients to focus on their bodies, during their yoga classes, taking a
nonjudgmental attitude towards their bodily sensations. One of the
weekly classes consisted of yoga postures and yogic breathing tech-
niques.11 The second explored yoga philosophy22 and yogic medita-
tion techniques, including mantra meditation and yoga nidra (deep
relaxation techniques).23 The postures used in each class built upon
the previous ones, with the difficulty and intensity levels being
increased carefully as the program progressed (Table S1). Patients
were provided with a written manual and three half-hour videos and
were encouraged to practice their yoga at home every day. Prior to
patients’ home practice, yoga practice was introduced in class. The
patients indicated their daily home practice time (in minutes) in a
daily log.

Low-FODMAP diet
Patients who were randomised to the nutrition group received 4 ses-
sions of nutritional counselling; consisting of an educational group
lecture, 2 sessions of individual counselling based around a food
diary and a group counselling session. Each of these sessions lasted
60-90 minutes. Patients in this study arm also received a pamphlet
containing nutritional advice for people with irritable bowel syn-
drome, produced by the german association for nutrition (DGE).24
This pamphlet explained the nature of a low-FODMAP diet and the
principles of balanced nutrition. Specifically, patients were instructed
that foods rich in fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides (eg, wheat,
rye, garlic, onions and legumes), items that contained lactose, foods
with fructose in excess of glucose (such as apples, mangoes and
honey), as well as food sources rich in sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol
and xylitol (such as apricots, peaches and artificially sweetened prod-
ucts) must be avoided.25 To aid patients in their food choices, they
were also given a set of low-FODMAP recipes, a list of foods to
avoid and another of foods that they might eat instead. After the
study’s 12-week intervention period (elimination phase), patients re-
challenged each week a different FODMAP group for 2 to 3 days
during that week to test individual tolerance levels to each of the
FODMAP groups (reintroduction phase). This scheme was explained
to the patients in an individual counselling session. All patients com-
pleted a 6-day food diary on two occasions; once during the study
screening period and a second time during the last week of the 12-
week study intervention period. These diaries were scored by a
nutritionist according to the amount of FODMAP consumption.
Patients’ compliance with the nutritional advice given was rated by
the same nutritionist. It was also self-rated by each patient. In both
cases, a nonvalidated 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), with ‘0’
indicating no compliance at all and ‘100’ indicating complete compli-
ance, was used.

Outcome assessment
The study’s outcomes were assessed at weeks 12 and 24, after ran-
domisation by an outcome assessor ‘blinded’ to patients’ group
allocation.
2.5.1
|
Primary outcome
The irritable bowel syndrome severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) is
a self-reported questionnaire exploring the severity and frequency
of
patients’
pain,
the
degree
of
abdominal
distension/bloating
experienced, the level of patients’ satisfaction with their bowel
habits and the extent to which the latter interfere with patients’
everyday lives.26 Each question is scored from 0-100 on a visual
analogue scale. This study used patients’ gastrointestinal symp-
toms, as assessed by the IBS-SSS at week 12, as its primary out-
come measure. All other outcomes were defined as secondary
outcomes and were analysed exploratively only. This way, no
a-level adjustment was necessary to maintain the overall Type I
error rate of 5%.27
The maximum achievable IBS-SSS score is 500; with higher
scores indicating higher symptom severity. Mild, moderate and sev-
ere cases are indicated by scores of 75-175, 175-300 and > 300
respectively. Patients with a score below 75 are considered to be in
remission, as healthy controls scored within this range. Clinically rel-
evant improvements are defined as a decrease of 50 points or
more.26
2.5.2
|
Secondary outcomes
This study used the irritable bowel syndrome quality of life (IBS-
QOL) measure28 to assess specific aspects of participants’ quality of
life related to their IBS and the 36-Item short form health survey
(SF-36)29 to capture their more general health-related quality of life.
Symptoms of anxiety or depression were monitored by the hospital
anxiety
and
depression
scale
(HADS).30
Perceived
Stress
was
assessed by using the cohen perceived stress scale (CPSS)31 and the
perceived stress questionnaire (PSQ).32 While the CPSS is the tool
most often used to assess stress in general, the PSQ is most fre-
quently used in patients with gastrointestinal and/or psychosomatic
disorders. Additional data about study participants’ body awareness
and responses were gathered using the body awareness question-
naire (BAQ)33 and body responsiveness scale (BRS)34 respectively.
Finally, patients kept diaries, which contained questions asking about
the extent to which they experienced adequate relief (AR) of their
IBS symptoms and/or a general global improvement. Patients’ gut
microbiomes were also assessed, but these results will be reported
elsewhere.

|
Safety
Patients were asked to record any adverse events that they had
experienced during the study period, regardless of their potential
relationship to the study intervention. Patients that experienced
such events were asked to see the study physician to assess the
events’ import and to initiate a response if needed. Additional
open-ended questions were used, following the study interven-
tions, to capture any adverse events not previously reported by
patients.

Sample size calculation and statistical analysis
The required sample size was calculated a priori. A group difference
of 83 points on the IBS-SSS total score has been shown to represent
a considerable self-reported improvement.26 Assuming a standard
deviation of 103.8, based on a former trial with IBS patients,35 a
two-sided, level 5% t test requires a total of 26 patients per study
group in order to detect a respective group difference with a statisti-
cal power of 80%. To account for the potential loss of statistical
power from the withdrawal of up to 10% of participants, the trial
aimed to recruit a total of at least 58 patients. All of the trial analy-
ses were based on an intention-to-treat basis, with all participants
being randomised, regardless of whether or not they provided a full
set of data or adhered to the study protocol. Missing data were mul-
tiply imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo Method,36,37
yielding a total of 50 complete data sets. Baseline group differences
in patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were anal-
ysed using Student’s t tests for continuous data and chi-square tests
for categorical data. Linear outcomes were analysed by univariate
analyses of covariance, which modelled the outcomes at weeks 12
or 24 to produce overall effect size estimates, 95% confidence inter-
vals and P-values. In order to assess the interventions’ safety, the
number of patients in each study group that experienced serious or
nonserious adverse events during the study period was assessed,
using chi-square tests. In keeping with the work of Francis et al, the
findings’ clinical relevance was assessed by comparing the number of
participants who reported an improvement of 50 or more points on
their IBS-SSS total scores26 at weeks 12 and 24, using chi-square
tests. Finally, the number of participants in clinical remission, based
on an IBS-SSS total score < 75, was compared between groups at
weeks 12 and 24 using chi-square tests.
Explorative statistical subgroup analyses were performed to con-
trol for potential differences in the effectiveness of the interventions
for patients with single IBS subtypes.
All analyses were performed using the statistical package for
social sciences software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, release
22.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Group).

RESULTS
3.1
|
Patients
A total of 208 patients completed the telephone screening, of which
144 were excluded due to a lack of interest, scheduling problems or
the failure to meet the study inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Sixty-four
patients completed the assessment by the study physician; at which
point five were excluded, leaving 59 patients who were enrolled in
the study and randomised to either the yoga group (n = 30) or the
FODMAP group (n = 29). A total of 7 patients; 3 in the yoga group
(2 due to scheduling problems and 1 to a loss of interest) and 4 in
the FODMAP group (2 due to difficulties with the diet, 1 due to
scheduling problems and 1 due to the relapse of a major depressive
episode) withdrew from the study. All patients were analysed on an
intention-to-treat basis. No group differences in sociodemographic
or clinical characteristics were found (Table S2). Patients in the yoga
group attended an average of 14.87 � 7.99 (61.94%) of the 24 yoga
classes. Patients additionally practiced a mean 96.30 � 38.22 further
minutes of yoga per week at home. Patients in the FODMAP group
attended 2.62 � 0.68 (87.36%) of the 3 study meetings. Compliance
with the nutritional advice given was self-reported to be 70.7 �
32.0 on a 100 mm VAS scale and 67.6 � 2.26 (mean �
standard
deviation) as scored by the study nutritionist according to patients’
food diaries.

Outcomes
3.2.1
|
Primary outcome
No statistically significant group differences were found at week 12
(D = 31.80, 95% CI �11.90; 75.50, P = .151) or at week 24
(D = 33.41, 95% CI �4.21; 71.04, P = .081) according to the IBS-
SSS. From week 0 to week 12, the IBS-SSS total score decreased
from 263.02 � 74.49 to 196.86 � 86.08 in the yoga group and
from 259.73 � 80.39 to 163.55 � 94.51 in the FODMAP group.
This resulted in statistically significant changes within both the yoga
and the FODMAP group at week 12 (yoga: P < .001; FODMAP:
P < .001) and week 24 (yoga: P < .001; FODMAP: P < .001) (Fig-
ures 2-5). Explorative subgroup analysis revealed no statistically sig-
nificant differences in the interventions’ effectiveness by reason of
patients’ IBS subtypes (data not shown). The results of these analy-
ses are limited by the small number of participants in each IBS sub-
group. The five subscales of IBS-SSS were analysed in detail
(Table S3). Significant within-group improvements were observed in
3 of the 5 categories in Yoga including duration of pain, bowel satis-
faction and interference with life and for the same categories in the
FODMAP group and also for abdominal distension. Between-group
comparison of Yoga and FODMAP group showed no significant dif-
ferences besides in the category abdominal distension at week 12
(P = .040), but not at Week 24.
3.2.2
|
Secondary outcomes
The study’s secondary outcomes are summarised in the supportive
information in Table S3. No statistically significant between-group
differences were found on the SF-36, except for the physical com-
ponent summary subscale, which showed a statistically significant
improvement in the yoga group. The CPSS and PSQ did not reveal
between-group differences, but within-group comparison showed
statistically significant improvements for both groups, using the
CPSS, but only for the yoga group using the PSQ. The IBS-QOL
showed a statistically significant between-group difference only on
one subscale; namely a decrease in quality of life at week 12, related
to FODMAP group patients’ avoidance of some foods (P = .005).
The HADS questionnaire revealed significantly lower scores in
the yoga group, compared to the FODMAP group, within the sub-
scale for anxiety (HADS-A) after 12 weeks (P = .025). Within the

Scores for the BAQ showed no statistically significant between-
group differences at week 12 (P = .064), but a significant difference
was found at week 24 in favour of the yoga group (P = .017). The
subscale relating to the importance of interoceptive awareness (BRS-
1) showed no statistically significant between-group differences at
either time points and the subscale measuring perceived mind-body-
connection (BRS-2) showed significant between-group differences at
week 12 in favour of the yoga group (P = .027).
According to the patients’ food diaries, at week 12, 82.4% of
patients in the yoga group experienced adequate relief of their IBS
symptoms vs 78.6% in the FODMAP group, although no statistically
significant between-group differences were found (P = 1.000). These
findings must be interpreted with care, as not all patients completed
their food diaries adequately; with only 17 patients in the yoga and
14 patients in the FODMAP group answering the ‘Adequate Relief’
question. Global improvements at week 12 are shown in Figures S6
and S7.

Clinical relevance
Sixteen patients in the yoga group reached a clinically relevant
decrease of at least 50 points in their IBS-SSS total scores at week
12, compared to 21 in the FODMAP group (P = .180). One patient
in the yoga group was in clinical remission at week 12, based on a
score lower than 75 points, compared with 6 patients in the FOD-
MAP group (P = .052). At week 24, a total of 3 patients in each
group were in clinical remission (P = 1.000).
3.4
|
Safety
Three patients in the FODMAP group reported adverse events dur-
ing the study intervention. One serious event related to a major
depressive episode experienced by one patient, with two nonserious
events (a mild self-reported depressive episode and an unwanted
loss of weight) reported by another. Two patients in the yoga group
reported adverse events: with one serious event relating to a newly
diagnosed deep leg vein thrombosis and one nonserious event relat-
ing to back pain caused by heavy lifting. None of these events were
adjudged to relate to the study interventions.

 the subscale abdominal distension of the IBS-SSS at week 12
(P = .040) in favour of the FODMAP group, no between-group dif-
ferences for participants’ overall gastrointestinal symptoms could be
shown. Nevertheless explorative within-group comparisons revealed
statistically significant improvements in participants’ overall gastroin-
testinal symptoms for both groups. Significant between-group differ-
ences were found in favour of the yoga group with regard to
patients’ levels of anxiety, body awareness and body responsiveness.
The FODMAP diet had a nonsignificant tendency (P = .052) to
induce remission more frequently than yoga, at 12 weeks, but this
tendency was not seen at 24 weeks (P = 1.000). Only 1 randomised,
controlled trial has studied the outcomes of a low-FODMAP diet for
more than 6 weeks to date and more data on the long-term out-
comes of a low-FODMAP diet are needed.38,39 With regard to
patient safety, yoga has occasionally been associated with serious
adverse events in some case studies,40 but most systematic reviews
of yoga interventions, in varied patient populations, have failed to
find such links.13,14,16,19,41 No serious adverse events related to
either yoga, or to patients’ adoption of a low-FODMAP diet, were
observed during the current study.
The value of a low-FODMAP diet is seen by some commentators
as
controversial.
While
the
related
carbohydrates
are
poorly
absorbed in the small intestine, leading to increased intestinal osmo-
lality and gas production due to their rapid fermentation and osmotic
action, fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides serve as prebiotics.42,43
It has been shown that low- FODMAP diets are effective in reducing
bowel symptoms,44 while they alter the colonic luminal microenvi-
ronment, possibly due to a lowered content of these prebiotics.5,45
Unfortunately, no published data on the influence of hatha yoga on
the gut microbiome exist to date. Since the latter is hypothesised to
be involved in the aetiology of IBS and depression, the impact of a
low-FODMAP diet and yoga on the gut microbiota warrants further
research in this context.46,47 Both of the current trial interventions
require adequate supervision and are, thus, relatively cost-intensive.
Adopting a low-FODMAP diet requires patients to engage in inten-
sive meal planning; supervised closely by well-trained personnel.
Such factors would offer considerable challenges if such diets were
implemented
in
clinical
practice.
Moreover,
the
restrictions
demanded by a low-FODMAP diet might lead to nutritional inade-
quacy and foster disordered eating.43 In contrast, yoga could poten-
tially enhance body awareness and responsiveness; lessening the
occurrence of disordered eating attitudes.34 A low-FODMAP-diet
was found to improve patients’ overall IBS symptoms in 4 of 4 stud-
ies reported elsewhere.48 Most studies excluded IBS-C patients and
as a result the low-FODMAP diet has been most extensively studied
in IBS-D patients. The current trial found no statistically significant
differences in an explorative subgroup analysis, comparing the effec-
tiveness of a low-FODMAP diet in IBS-C and IBS-D patients. Else-
where, Chumpitazi and colleagues have linked gut microbiome
biomarkers to patients’ clinical responses to a low-FODMAP diet,
leading them to speculate that such diets may work differently for
different patients.49 With regard to the yoga intervention, it is
important to note that the yoga classes delivered in the current trial
were purpose- designed and adapted to patients’ needs. The trial’s
yoga intervention encompassed philosophical elements, not usually
included in conventional asana-based yoga classes; enhancing the
psychological dimensions of the approach. Gut-directed hypnother-
apy is another psychological therapy that has claimed to improve
patients’ IBS symptoms.50 When such hypnotherapy was compared
to the adoption of a low-FODMAP diet, in a randomised controlled
study, neither intervention was found to be superior.51 It should also
be borne in mind that the current trial’s yoga intervention was devel-
oped and delivered by an experienced yoga instructor, well-trained
in the field, and was supported with videos to encourage patients to
practice at home. These sessions were delivered twice a week; more
often than the yoga interventions delivered in other studies. The lat-
ter were often less intensive, with either weekly yoga sessions or
teaching delivered solely via videos for home-based practice.19

 Although the current trial’s findings are limited, they may prove
replicable if the above points are taken into consideration. Both
hatha yoga and the adoption of a low-FODMAP diet may be feasible
adjunctive therapies patients with IBS.

Strengths and weaknesses
The strengths of this trial include its randomised controlled design,
its ability to control for nonspecific therapy effects via the use of an
active control group and its ‘blinding’ of outcome assessors. Its pri-
mary limitations are its monocentric design, its inability to ‘blind’
patients with regard to the allocated interventions and the subjective
self-report nature of the outcome measures used to explore patients’
gastrointestinal symptoms. The IBS-SSS may also fail to detect
changes in patients with mild IBS, scoring lower than 175 points.26

CONCLUSION
This study found evidence that both hatha yoga and a low-FODMAP
diet can relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and improving a range of
other psychological and physiological health parameters in patients
with IBS. Both interventions seem to offer promising, safe treat-
ments for people with this condition. Further studies are needed to
evaluate the long-term effects, cost-effectiveness and efficacy of
these approaches, as compared to other treatment modalities.
