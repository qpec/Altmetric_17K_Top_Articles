Abstract
While many phenotypes have been associated with variants in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
genes, the full phenotypic impact of HLA variants across all diseases is unknown. We imputed 
HLA genomic variation from two populations of 28,839 and 8,431 European ancestry individuals 
and tested association of HLA variation with 1,368 phenotypes. A total of 104 four-digit and 92 
two-digit HLA allele-phenotype associations were significant in both discovery and replication 
cohorts, the strongest being HLA-DQB1*03:02 and type 1 diabetes. Four previously unidentified 
associations were identified across the spectrum of disease with two and four digit HLA alleles 
and ten with non-synonymous variants. Some conditions associated with multiple HLA variants 
and stronger associations with more severe disease manifestations were identified. A 
comprehensive, publicly-available catalog of clinical phenotypes associated HLA variation is 
provided. Examining HLA variant disease associations in this large dataset allows comprehensive 
definition of disease associations to drive further mechanistic insights.
Introduction
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes 
have been extensively studied due to their key role in immune responses(1). Despite 
containing only a small fraction of all human genes, the MHC contains the greatest number 
of significant associations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relative to any 
other region in the genome(2). In GWAS alone, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
the MHC have been associated with over 100 different phenotypes according to the National 
Human Genome Research Institute’s GWAS catalogue(3). Four digit HLA alleles, which 
characterize MHC proteins at the amino acid level, and key HLA amino acid residues are 
often found to have critical roles in immune-mediated disease. This HLA variation can be

 now imputed with high accuracy from SNP-level data(4–6). Previous investigations 
including GWAS have utilized a phenotype to genotype approach, which involves 
identifying individuals with a specific phenotype first and then determining genetic 
associations with that phenotype. The broader question of the influence of HLA variation in 
these genes across multiple human disease phenotypes has not been comprehensively 
investigated(7).
Here we report the results of a large phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) that 
systematically examined relationships between variants in the MHC and a broad set of 
human disease phenotypes. PheWAS using electronic health record (EHR) systems have 
replicated hundreds of previous GWAS associations (including many associations with 
MHC SNPs), identified new associations, and have been used in other applications, such as 
an evaluation of the phenotypic legacy of Neandertals in modern humans(7–14). We 
conducted a PheWAS on European ancestry individuals genotyped on the Illumina® 
HumanExome BeadChip and tested association of imputed HLA variants with 1,368 EHR 
phenotypes. Populations were derived from two institutions with DNA biobanks coupled to 
de-identified EHRs: Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s BioVU (n=28,839) and the 
Marshfield Clinic’s Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP, n=8,431). The results 
are freely available as a web catalog of HLA risk loci and their associated phenotypes at 
www.phewascatalog.org.
Results
Primary PheWAS Analysis
A total of 99 four digit HLA alleles, 77 two digit alleles, and 988 non-synonymous variants 
were imputed using SNP2HLA(6) and included in the analysis (Table 1). In a subset of 
3,152 BioVU individuals of European ancestry who also underwent direct HLA sequencing, 
the overall concordance rate and call rate for SNP2HLA-imputed four digit alleles compared 
to sequencing were 96.93% and 99.98% respectively. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) 
adjustment of q<0.10 in the discovery cohort (BioVU) and p<0.05 in the replication cohort 
(PMRP), a total of 104 significant associations with the same direction of effect were 
identified between four digit HLA alleles and the 1,368 phenotypes tested (Figure 1 and 
Figure S1). A total of 284 four digit allele associations were significant in BioVU before 
replication in PMRP. The 104 significant associations were observed with 29 distinct 
phenotypes and 29 unique alleles. After meta-analysis of associations in BioVU and PMRP, 
there were 12 four-digit allelic associations with a meta-analysis P value ≤1.9×10−25 (Table 
2; other associations are presented at www.phewascatalog.org). The strongest was observed 
between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and HLA-DQB1*03:02 (OR 3.62, meta-analysis 
p=1.04×10−54).In the analysis of two digit alleles, 92 significant associations were observed 
with 24 distinct phenotypes and 25 unique alleles. A total of 205 two digit allele associations 
were significant in BioVU before replication in PMRP. There were 9 meta-analysis 
associations with P<1.9×10−25 (Table 2; other associations are presented at 
www.phewascatalog.org), and the strongest was a between HLA-B*27 and ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS, OR 32.48, meta-analysis p=3.06×10−45). In the analysis of non-
synonymous variants, a total of 1,759 phenotype- non-synonymous variant associations were

 observed with 53 distinct phenotypes and 467 unique amino acid substitutions. A total of 
3,862 non-synonymous variant associations were significant in BioVU before replication in 
PMRP. The strongest association observed was between AS and an asparagine substitution 
at position 97 of HLA-B (OR 33.25, meta-analysis p=1.17×10−45). QQ plots for association 
analyses are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S2–S4). Results acquired 
using the additive genetic model were similar to results acquired using the dominant model.
Table 3 compares major HLA genetic associations for common autoimmune/inflammatory 
diseases based on previous literature and the association results from the PheWAS analysis 
in BioVU. The major association for each disease was highly significant with effect sizes 
similar to those previously published, suggesting the validity of the approach and results. 
Further evaluation of PheWAS results compared to previous associations is presented in 
Supplementary Materials.
The results also provide supportive evidence for associations previously reported but not yet 
widely-accepted. For instance, one of the strongest associations observed with multiple 
sclerosis (MS) was for an non-synonymous variant at position 71 in HLA-DRB1, (OR 2.66, 
meta-analysis p=3.54×10−16) consistent with previous reports(15, 16). Similarly, cervical 
cancer has been linked with class II HLA alleles and class II HLA haplotypes(17, 18) and 
we observed a significant association between ‘Cervical cancer and dysplasia’ and non-
synonymous variation at position 37 of HLA-DRB1 (OR 1.43, meta-analysis p=7.22×10−7).
Previously Unidentified Associations
This PheWAS also identified associations between immune-mediated diseases and non-
synonymous variants where only a four or two digit allele association was previously 
reported. For instance, several HLA alleles have been associated with increased risk for 
Sicca syndrome (SS) in European populations, including HLA-DQB1*02:01(19, 20), but the 
association of non-synonymous variants with SS is largely unknown(21). This PheWAS 
identified HLA-DQB1*02:01 as the strongest HLA risk factor in our population and also 
implicated non-synonymous variation at position 77 in HLA-DRB1 with SS susceptibility. 
Similarly, uveitis is known to be associated with HLA-B*27(22) and the PheWAS now 
implicates non-synonymous variation at position 114 of HLA-B with uveitis susceptibility. 
Notably, this non-synonymous variant association with uveitis was observed to have a higher 
odds ratio and stronger association than the four digit allele. These results may clarify the 
driving association for a given phenotype is a two or four digit allele, or a non-synonymous 
variant, based on the strength of association and the work supports further attempts to 
identify critical and more shared peptide residues among autoimmune diseases.
The PheWAS also identified associations with diseases for which evidence for predisposing 
HLA variation is minimal or has not been previously reported. These were primarily with 
non-synonymous variation (Table 4), and were observed across organ systems (neurologic, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, infectious, oncologic, neurologic, cardiologic, and 
respiratory conditions). The large numbers of subjects studied also allowed evaluation of 
“subphenotypes” such as those indicating specific T1D complications or manifestations. In 
this analysis, a stronger OR was consistently observed for the T1D sub-phenotype than for 
the T1D phenotype (Table 5). For instance, the OR for the association between HLA-

 DQB1*0302 and T1D (OR 4.42) was reduced compared to that between HLA-DQB1*0302 
and T1D with ketoacidosis (OR 7.09), T1D with neurological manifestations (OR 6.26), 
T1D with ophthalmic manifestations (OR 7.33), and T1D with renal manifestations (OR 
6.66). Similar significant associations were observed for phenotypes indicating more severe 
manifestations of disease, including non-synonymous variants associations with psoriatic 
arthropathy compared to psoriasis (Table 5).
Pleiotropic associations
For four and two digit HLA alleles, we found consistent evidence of association with 
multiple phenotypes. Figure 2 represents a heatmap of four digit HLA allele associations. In 
order to determine cross-phenotype associations potentially driven by pleiotropic effects, we 
implemented the Trait-based Association Test (TATES)(23). TATES was implemented for all 
phenotypes that had over 40 cases and crossed the FDR significance threshold for any four 
digit HLA allele (MAF>1%) in BioVU. We found 60 HLA alleles with significant (p<0.05) 
evidence for cross-phenotypic effects with the strongest evidence for HLA-B*27:05 (TATES 
p value=7.76×10−68), which was associated with AS and uveitis (Supplementary Table 1). 
Among four digit alleles associated with multiple phenotypes, HLA-DQA1*01:02 and 
HLA-DQB1*02:01 were significantly associated with 8 phenotypes, the largest number of 
associations with any allele in our dataset. The most significant results of the TATES 
analysis and the HLA alleles with multiple phenotypic associations are presented in the 
Supplemental Materials (Supplementary Table 1). Shared HLA signatures have been 
previously observed for T1D(24–26) and T1D was associated with most of the alleles that 
had the strongest evidence of cross-phenotypic associations. The HLA-DQB1*02:01 and -
DRB1*03:01 alleles shared associations with T1D, SS, systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
celiac disease. Shared associations were also common among the non-synonymous variants. 
For instance, substitutions at position 26 of HLA-DRB1 were significantly associated with 
an increased risk of T1D, RA, celiac disease, SS, and diffuse disease of connective tissue.
In order to further refine our models of pleiotropy, we conducted conditional analyses of 
phenotypes in a pairwise fashion. The purpose of the conditional analysis was to determine 
whether association of multiple phenotypes with the same allele were due to co-occurrence 
of phenotypes rather than independent association of both phenotypes with the allele. This 
analysis showed that HLA associations with T1D, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), MS, SS, and 
celiac disease were independent. Notably, the HLA associations with RA and polymyalgia 
rheumatica appeared to be independent in conditional analyses, as did HLA associations 
with AS and uveitis in addition to T1D and diabetic retinopathy. However, conditional 
analyses suggested that the optic neuritis, ‘other demyelinating diseases of central nervous 
system,’ and ‘lack of coordination’ phenotypes are more strongly associated with MS than 
with HLA variation, i.e. these associations were driven by an association with MS.
To further understand the relationships between HLA loci, alleles, and phenotypes, we 
conducted a network analysis using nodes to represent PheWAS codes, HLA genes, and 
HLA alleles with links representing associations that were significant at p<1×10−5. HLA 
genes and their alleles are further organized into a hierarchical structure by linking alleles to 
HLA genes. A total of 135 PheWAS analysis associations between four-digit HLA alleles

 and PheWAS codes were observed in the BioVU dataset. The majority of the most 
significant associations (at p≤1×10−15) are among T1D with HLA-DQB1*02:01, -
DRB1*03:01 and -DRB1*03:01, T1D/RA with HLA-DQA1*03:01 and -DRB1*01:02, and 
T1D/MS with HLA-DQB1*06:02 and -DRB1*04:01 but with the opposite (protective) 
effect on MS. Figure 3 presents an undirected graph with nodes representing PheWAS 
codes, HLA genes, and four digit HLA alleles. Nodes with more significant associations and 
that share more connections are topologically clustered together. The layout is intuitive to 
visualize the complex PheWAS associations where clusters of PheWAS codes stay closer 
due to shared genetic associations, and vice versa. The genes HLA-DRB1, -DQB1, and –
DQA1 cluster together strongly with autoimmune diseases with T1D and T1D sub-
phenotypes at the focus. An interactive version of Figure 3 is available at http://
phewascatalog.org.
Discussion
We conducted a systematic test of phenomic associations with HLA variation. Significant 
associations with large effect sizes were replicated in autoimmune conditions well 
represented in the population, such as T1D, AS, MS, and RA, providing strong evidence of 
the validity of the PheWAS approach and HLA imputation. We find evidence for several 
previously undescribed associations with MS and cervical cancer. Previously unidentified 
associations were also observed between HLA variation and multiple phenotypes, including 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, nodular lymphoma, cancer of the brain and nervous system, 
cervical cancer & dysplasia, kidney transplant, partial epilepsy, and atherosclerosis of the 
extremities. We found consistent evidence for pleiotropy between HLA variation and 
common autoimmune diseases, especially for class II HLA alleles associated with T1D and 
other autoimmune diseases. Our analysis confirms the ability of PheWAS to identify 
multiple associations from well-powered studies. In each of the common diseases studied, 
the most significant known HLA contributor to disease was identified as a risk factor in this 
study, suggesting the validity of the results. Our results also provide a publicly available, 
comprehensive set of HLA risk loci for validation of previous findings and hypothesis 
generation for future research.
The strongest observed associations in our study were with T1D, in keeping with the fact 
that T1D is a common, dependably diagnosed disease and 40–50% of T1D heritability has 
been attributed to HLA variability(27). Genetic influences on T1D risk include a hierarchy 
of predisposing and protective HLA haplotypes, with the greatest risk conferred by the DR3-
DQ2 and DR4-DQ7/8 haplotypes, especially in patients heterozygous for both 
haplotypes(28, 29). These haplotypes are well represented among our observed associations. 
The strongest association observed overall was for an non-synonymous variant at position 57 
of HLA-DQB1, a locus which was identified early as a susceptibility locus for T1D(30, 31). 
Our data support this observation and the notion that class II HLA allelic associations for 
T1D are a reflection of underlying amino acid substitutions involved directly in autoimmune 
etiology. In this study, the non-synonymous 57 HLA-DQB1 variant was a stronger 
association than any other HLA variation for T1D, suggesting that the non-synonymous 57 
HLA-DQB1 variant is the driver of the association, which is in line with previous 
observations(30). Our observations were consistent with prior disease models for a number

 of other autoimmune diseases, such as RA, AS, MS, celiac disease, psoriasis, primary biliary 
cirrhosis, and SS.
This is one of the first systematic studies of clinical phenotypes with HLA variation in a 
single population. Previous studies investigating phenotype associations with HLA variation 
have identified similar associations through recruitment of specific case control cohorts. The 
availability of extensive phenotype data enables an in depth investigation of pleiotropy. This 
extensive phenotype data also allows investigation of sub-phenotypes, such as T1D with 
various manifestations of the disease. A larger OR was consistently observed for the T1D 
sub-phenotype than for the T1D phenotype. This might indicate a stronger HLA association 
with T1D disease severity or potentially a phenotype with less misclassification. Finally, we 
consider the paucity of observed associations for non-autoimmune phenotypes to be 
interesting and informative. The relatively small number of associations with infectious 
diseases, psychiatric disorders, or oncologic disorders could be due to the lack of a 
significant biological effect of HLA variation on these disorders or a lack of power for these 
relatively uncommon phenotypes within our dataset in the presence of multiple comparisons.
One limitation of the work is that the observed strength of association depends on the 
accuracy of ICD9 code diagnosis, accuracy of imputation, and frequency of both diagnosis 
and allele in our population. Any misclassification error should underestimate the magnitude 
of effect size estimates, thus leading to a bias toward a null result. PheWAS has been 
previously shown to accurately replicate diverse phenotype-genotype associations(12, 14), 
and data presented here replicate many previous reports of HLA associations, as noted 
above. Similarly, our results depend on the accuracy of prediction of HLA alleles and non-
synonymous variants based on SNP data from the HumanExome BeadChip. Previous 
literature suggests HLA alleles can be imputed accurately(4–6, 32) and alleles were imputed 
with high accuracy compared to sequence data in a subset of our population. Rare alleles 
were not included here and the study does have limited power to detect significant 
associations for phenotypes with limited sample sizes in our population. While the total 
number of individuals within our study is large, the number of individuals with specific 
phenotypes was relatively small, which limits our ability to detect associations with modest 
effect sizes. Additional diagnostic information that would add specificity, such as anti-cyclic 
citrullinated peptides (CCP) antibodies in RA, was not employed in this study. Finally, we 
encountered challenges in the selection of appropriate methods for multiple comparisons 
adjustment that minimized false positive results while accounting for strong linkage 
disequilibrium in the HLA region. Such challenges in defining statistical significance with 
extensive correlations in the genotypes and phenotypes have likely resulted in some false 
positive associations.
We provide large-scale replication of phenotypic associations with variation in the HLA 
region. Our observations are valuable since they add evidence to known and uncertain HLA-
disease associations and may help uncover HLA variation that drives a given immune-
mediated phenotype and identify key residues that provide mechanistic insights. The 
associated type of HLA variation (i.e. four digit allele versus non-synonymous variant) gives 
clues to the molecular and structural basis of disease. For some diseases, variation in HLA 
may be necessary but not sufficient and in some cases HLA alleles may be protective with

 effects that outweigh risk alleles. A two versus four digit association may point to the 
serotype, the HLA protein which is expressed from the respective HLA gene and is detected 
by the respective antibody, more broadly associated with general phenotypes of diseases and 
may relate to shared peptide binding specificities. Locations of non-synonymous variants in 
peptide binding domains or killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) interaction sites 
may also inform disease mechanisms. Our results are freely available and provide a 
comprehensive set of HLA risk loci for additional research, allowing an in-depth evaluation 
of the underlying genetic architectures for a range of diseases.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
The objective of our study was to determine associations between variation in the HLA 
region and a broad set of phenotypes. We employed a PheWAS approach, which tests the 
association of genomic variation with multiple phenotypes (8). Multiple phenotypes for each 
individual were derived from de-identified EHR data. HLA variation was imputed using 
SNP-level data from GWAS platforms using two large biobanks that link DNA extracted 
from discarded blood samples to de-identified EHRs. The discovery analysis was performed 
using BioVU, the Vanderbilt DNA databank, and the replication analysis was performed in 
Marshfield Clinic’s PMRP. All individuals with sufficient EHR and genotype data 
(described below) from the replication and discovery cohorts were included in a non-
randomized and non-blinded fashion.
Patient Populations
The discovery cohort included a population from BioVU, the Vanderbilt DNA databank that 
links DNA extracted from discarded blood samples to de-identified EHRs(33). BioVU 
accrues DNA samples extracted from blood drawn for routine clinical testing. A full 
description of this resource and its associated ethical, privacy and other protections has been 
previously published(33). At the time of this study, BioVU contained approximately 210,000 
patients with DNA and 28,839 self-identified white/non-Hispanic patients with available 
Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChip genotyping were included. The mean age of the 
individuals was 55.4 years and 53% were female. BioVU operated on an opt-out basis until 
January 2015 and on an opt-in basis since(33). The phenotypic data in BioVU are all de-
identified and the study was designated “non-human subjects” research by the Vanderbilt 
Institutional Review Board.
The replication cohort consisted of self-identified white/non-Hispanic Marshfield Clinic 
patients recruited into the PMRP as described previously(34). PMRP represents a 
homogenous population with 77% of participants claiming German ancestry. In this 
PheWAS, 8,431 patients were included for independent validation of BioVU signals. PMRP 
Discovery set participants were all over age 40 with over 30 years of EHR data on average, 
and have been genotyped by Illumina® HumanExome BeadChip.

 Genotyping and HLA imputation
All samples were genotyped using the Illumina® HumanExome BeadChip, which contains 
2,061 HLA tag SNPs. Before imputation, SNP data were cleaned using the quality control 
(QC) pipeline developed by the eMERGE Genomics Working Group(35, 36). Classical two 
and four digit HLA alleles and HLA non-synonymous variants were imputed from SNP data 
on the HumanExome BeadChip using SNP2HLA(6) with the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics 
Consortium (T1DGC) reference panel, a marker window size of 1000, and a posterior 
probability (gprob) threshold of 0.5. We restricted our analysis to individuals of at least 90% 
European descent, as defined using 3,242 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) from the 
HumanExome BeadChip input into STRUCTURE using HapMap reference populations(37). 
Identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis was performed and related individuals (parent-child and 
full sibling) were removed from the dataset. Principal components (PC) analysis was 
performed on AIMs using the EIGENSTRAT method implemented in PLINK(38, 39). To 
minimize confounding by population stratification, association analyses were adjusted for 
PCs 1 and 2. We imputed individual dosages for classical four-digit alleles, two-digit alleles 
and polymorphic non-synonymous variants at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -
DQB1 and -DRB1 from 28,839 individuals of genetically-determined European ancestry. 
All HLA alleles and non-synonymous variants with minor allele frequencies greater than 
0.01 were included in the analysis.
In order to confirm accuracy of HLA imputation for four digit alleles, high resolution, four-
digit HLA sequencing was performed in 3,152 subjects from the Vanderbilt Electronic 
Systems for Pharmacogenomic Assessment (VESPA) cohort(40) for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-
C, HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ at the Institute for Immunology and Infectious 
Diseases (IIID) at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia. The IIID is accredited by the 
American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) and the National 
Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) and is an established center for sequencing the 
HLA loci and participating in large, multicenter trials which use HLA sequence data(41, 42). 
All samples that were successfully typed were included in the study population. 
Concordance rates and call rates for four digit HLA alleles were then calculated for 
SNP2HLA compared to direct HLA sequencing results. A detailed description of HLA 
sequencing methods are available in the Supplemental Materials.
PheWAS Analysis
Phenotypes were defined by patient EHR data as previously described(11, 13, 14). The 
ICD9 coding system describes diseases, signs and symptoms, injuries, poisonings, 
procedures and screening codes(43). We translated the ICD9 data into the custom ‘case 
phenotypes’ (phecodes) and their algorithm-defined control groups using version 1.2 of the 
phecode mappings (available from http://phewascatalog.org)(14). Phecodes aggregate codes 
so that their granularity is appropriate for research purposes, including large-scale genomic 
studies(11). We used a minimum code count threshold of 2 distinct days to define a case for 
a phenotype. We tested only phenotypes with at least 40 cases, including a total of 1,368 
phenotypes, and used a dominant genetic model adjusted for age, gender, and PCs one and 
two.

 In the primary discovery PheWAS analysis, a total of 99 four-digit HLA alleles, 77 two-digit 
HLA alleles, and 988 non-synonymous variants were tested across 1,368 phenotypes that 
had at least 40 cases. Phenotypes reflected diagnoses extracted from the EHR and included a 
broad range of diseases grouped into the following categories: infectious, neoplastic, 
endocrine and metabolic, hematopoietic, psychiatric, neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, 
digestive, genitourinary, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, symptoms and signs, and injuries.
In the discovery cohort, we employed the FDR method to correct for multiple comparisons 
in association tests by variant type (two or four digit HLA allele, non-synonymous variant)
(44). We declared statistical significance at a q value cutoff of 0.10 in the discovery cohort 
(BioVU) combined with p<0.05 in the replication cohort (PMRP). All predicted HLA alleles 
and non-synonymous variants were tested for association with phenotypes derived from the 
EHR in a dominant model adjusted for age, gender, and PCs one and two. Although the 
dominant genetic model was used for the primary analysis, an additive model was also 
performed for comparison. We conducted association tests using logistic regression to 
predict case/control status based on the HLA allele, age, sex, and a categorical ascertainment 
variable based on the experiment under which the genotyping was originally performed. 
Fixed effects meta-analysis was employed to determine overall effects of HLA variation in 
both discovery and replication cohorts. The analysis was conducted using PLINK and Perl 
scripts and graphics were generated using the R PheWAS package(11, 45).
Pleiotropy Assessment and Network Visualization of PheWAS Associations
In order to assess pleiotropic or cross-phenotypic associations for four digit HLA alleles in 
the discovery cohort, we first calculated the number of phenotypes significantly associated 
with each allele. We then performed conditional analysis when multiple significant 
associations with the same allele were present, adjusting for the second phenotype in a 
logistic regression to predict the first phenotype. The purpose of the conditional analysis was 
to determine whether association of multiple phenotypes with the same allele were due to 
co-occurrence of phenotypes rather than independent association of both phenotypes with 
the allele. For instance, the association of an allele with both multiple sclerosis and the ‘lack 
of coordination’ phenotype might suggest that co-occurrence of ‘lack of coordination’ and 
MS is driving this association. In order to adjust for this effect, we performed regressions 
adjusted for the second phenotype whenever an allele was significantly associated with 
multiple phenotypes. If an allelic association became non-significant after this adjustment, 
we concluded that the allelic association was due to co-occurrence with another phenotype, 
rather than a true association of the allele.
A Trait-based Association Test (TATES)(23) was conducted using R (www.R-project.org) 
for all phenotypes that had over 40 cases and crossed the FDR significance threshold for any 
four digit HLA allele (MAF>1%) in BioVU. TATES combines the p values obtained in 
single marker associations to determine a global p value while correcting for observed 
correlation structure among phenotypes(23, 46). The TATES procedure affords improved 
power to detect a combined effect for a group of correlated phenotypes. Thereby, we 
examined the significance of TATES result to indicate a pleiotropic effect. All pleiotropy 
analyses were performed on a dataset pruned of redundant phenotypes, including phecode

 “subphenotypes” that indicated specific T1D complications such as T1D with ketoacidosis, 
neurological manifestations, ophthalmic manifestations, or renal manifestations. To 
minimize co-occurrence of related phenotypes in the TATES analysis, we removed 
redundant phenotypes related to complications (e.g. “Type 1 diabetes with renal 
manifestations”) and broad versus narrow phenotype classifications (e.g. “Hypotension” was 
pruned while “Orthostatic hypotension” was preserved). We also eliminated sex specific 
phenotypes such as “Dysplasia of female genital organs.”
To visualize the complex many-to-many relationships between phenotypes and HLA genes 
from the PheWAS analysis, we generated both a heatmap and a network map for four digit 
allelic associations. The heatmap was generated using the odd ratios of associations between 
4-digit HLA alleles and phenotypes. Heatmaps were generated with the heatmap.2 function 
in the R package gplots and colors were chosen from the R package RColorBrewer. All 
phenotypes and HLA alleles with at least one association with p<1×10−5 were included in 
the heatmap. Dendrograms of phenotypes and HLA alleles clustering were generated with 
heatmap.2 and used Euclidean distance. To determine which clusters represented actual 
structure in the dataset, a bootstrap analysis was performed. For both the HLA allele and 
phenotype clustering, 1,000 simulations were performed, sampling with replacement from 
the actual dataset for each simulation. Clusters that were present in over 90% of the 
simulations were identified and indicated in the heatmap.
For the network map, we used R package igraph 1.0.0 and constructed a graph 
representation that maps associations between phenotypes and HLA genes/alleles(47). In 
this network map, we use nodes to represent either PheWAS codes or HLA genes/alleles and 
links between HLA alleles and PheWAS codes represent the significant associations 
between four-digit HLA alleles and PheWAS codes that are considered significant at 
α=1×10−5. In addition, HLA genes and their alleles are further organized into a hierarchical 
structure by linking all alleles to its HLA genes. A Force-directed layout is then applied to 
the graph to stimulate the network graph as a physical system so links act as springs that 
attract connected nodes closer together and are weighted by p-values so more significantly 
associated nodes have stronger attraction forces to stay closer. As a result, nodes with more 
significant associations and share more connections are topologically clustered together. The 
layout is intuitive to visualize the complex PheWAS associations where clusters of PheWAS 
codes stay closer due to shared genetic associations, and vice versa.

Network diagram of 171 PheWAS analysis associations between four-digit HLA alleles and 
PheWAS codes at p<1×10−5. Large circular nodes indicate HLA genes, small circular nodes 
represent four digit HLA alleles and colored squares represent PheWAS phenotypes. Lines 
indicate an association and distance between nodes indicates the strength of the association 
by p value. Dashed lines represent a protective effect (OR <1) and solid lines indicate a risk 
effect (OR >1). The shade of the lines indicated three different levels of statistical 
significances based on P values, with the darkest level for the most significant associations at 
p<1 × 10−15, the intermediate level for the significances at p value between 1 × 10−8 and 1 × 
10−15 and the light level for those at p<1−5. An interactive version is available at http://

PMRP indicates Personalized Medicine Research Project; aa, amino acid; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; MAF, minor allele frequency; OR, odds ratio.
1)Overall minor allele frequency of allele in the discovery cohort (BioVU)
2)Odds ratios and p values generated using logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and two principal components and considered significant in Discovery cohort (BioVU) at FDR-adjusted q<0.10.
3)P values considered significant in Replication cohort (PMRP) at p<0.05.
4)Meta-analysis performed in a fixed effects model adjusted for age, gender, and two principal components.
5)Conditional analyses suggest that the optic neuritis phenotype is more strongly associated with multiple sclerosis than with HLA variation
