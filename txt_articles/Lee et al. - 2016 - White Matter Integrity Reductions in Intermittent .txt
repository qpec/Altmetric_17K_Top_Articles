Intermittent explosive disorder (IED), as described in DSM-5, is the categorical expression of pathological impulsive aggression. Previous
work has identified neurobiological correlates of the disorder in patterns of frontal-limbic brain activity and dysregulation of serotonergic
neurotransmission. Given the importance of short- and-long range white matter connections of the brain in social and emotional behavior,
studies of white matter connectivity in impulsive aggression are warranted. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in the related conditions
of antisocial and borderline personality disorder have produced preliminary evidence of disturbed white matter connectivity in these
disorders, but to date there have been no DTI studies in IED. A total of 132 male and female adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years
underwent Turboprop-DTI on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner. Of these, 42 subjects had IED, 40 were normal controls, and 50 were clinical
psychiatric controls with psychiatric disorders without IED. All subjects were free of alcohol, psychotropic medications, or drugs of abuse.
The diffusion tensor was calculated in each voxel and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated. Tract-based spatial statistics
(TBSS) were used to compare FA along the white matter skeleton among the three subject groups. IED was associated with lower FA in
two clusters located in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) when compared with the psychiatric and healthy controls. Impulsive
aggression and borderline personality disorder, but not psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder, was associated with lower FA in the
two clusters within the SLF. In conclusion, IED was associated with lower white matter integrity in long-range connections between the
frontal and temporoparietal regions.

INTRODUCTION
Pathological impulsive aggression is characterized in DSM-5
as intermittent explosive disorder (IED). IED is not rare,
with a prevalence of 3–5% (Coccaro, 2012) and a mean age of
onset of 14 years (Kessler et al, 2006). Impulsive aggression is
operationalized as reactive verbal or physical aggression
against people, objects, and animals. Episodes are generally
triggered by social provocation and are associated with anger
(Coccaro et al, 2014). This is in contrast to instrumental
aggression, as seen in psychopathy, that is aggression carried
out in pursuit of a reward or dominance (Glenn and Raine,
2009).
Current
therapeutic
approaches
such
as
SSRI
medications and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can
help, but are not always effective (respectively Coccaro et al,
2009; McCloskey et al, 2008). Thus, there is a real need
for new approaches in the clinic. Identifying the neurobio-
logical abnormality causing impulsive aggression would be
an important step toward the development of more effective
treatments.
Studies to date suggest that impulsive aggression is related
to the function of brain systems mediating social and
emotional behavior. On the molecular level, serotonergic
(Coccaro et al, 2015), neuropeptide (Coccaro et al, 1998),
and inflammatory protein abnormalities (Coccaro et al,
2014) have been linked to impulsive aggression. At the macro
level, functional brain imaging studies have found evidence
of exaggerated amygdala response to angry faces and
diminished functional connectivity between the amygdala
and orbitofrontal cortex (Coccaro et al, 2007). Impulsive
aggression has been associated with abnormal patterns of
task-related functional brain activity, with enhanced blood
oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the amygdala and
orbitofrontal cortex during provoked aggression but lower
parietal activity in the medial parietal regions (New et al,
2009); enhanced amygdala BOLD reactivity to neutral faces
(Bobes et al, 2013); lower striatal metabolic activity in both
provoked and nonprovoked aggression as measured by
FDG-PET in males (Perez-Rodriguez et al, 2012); and higher
error-related dorsolateral prefrontal cortex BOLD activity
(Moeller et al, 2014).
Thus, evidence to date implicates dysfunction in neural
circuits
mediating
emotional
behavior
and
executive

 function that rely on brain networks with hubs in both the
cortical and subcortical structures.
Given that brain function depends on coordinated activity
across connected brain structures, white matter connections in
the brain are of potential importance in impulsive aggression.
In IED, cognitive deficits appear to be circumscribed to
affective and social domains but are relative, not absolute
deficits of function in these domains (Best et al, 2002) and
are not associated with lower intelligence (Best et al, 2002).
These findings suggest that the underlying neural abnormality
is more subtle than that encountered in disconnection
syndromes caused by gross lesions or neurodevelopmental
disorders. A more sensitive measure of white matter tract
health is magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
that provides estimates of white matter integrity by measuring
the diffusion of water molecules (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;
LeBihan et al, 2001). Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar
measure of the degree to which the diffusion process of water
is anisotropic: a perfectly spherical diffusion tensor would
have an FA of zero (first reported in Basser and Pierpaoli
1996; reviewed in Alexander et al, 2007).
In order to test the hypothesis that IED is associated with
region-specific abnormalities in white matter integrity, a
cross-sectional study was undertaken to compare white
matter diffusion anisotropy between IED and control
subjects using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (Smith
et al, 2006). To test the specificity of purported white matter
integrity differences, a psychiatric control group (PC) was
included in comparisons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
All subjects provided written, informed consent using
documents approved by the Committee for the Protection
of Human Subjects (IRB). A total of 132 physically healthy,
right-handed subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years
participated in this study. This included 42 subjects with
IED, 40 normal controls, and 50 clinical psychiatric controls
with non-IED psychiatric disorders. Subjects were recruited
through public service announcements seeking out indivi-
duals who had difficulty managing anger and/or aggression
as well as individuals who identified themselves as healthy.
Subjects with a life history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia
(or other psychotic disorder), developmental delay, or
current substance dependence disorder were excluded from
this study. Medical screening was conducted with a com-
prehensive
medical
history,
physical
and
neurological
examination, and drug screen for amphetamine, barbitu-
rates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, methadone, meth-
amphetamine, phencyclidine, oxycodone, and marijuana.
Drug screening and alcohol breathalyzer was repeated before
the research scan.
Diagnostic Assessment
Axis I and Axis II Personality Disorder diagnoses were made
according to DSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994). The diagnosis of
IED was made by Integrated Research Criteria as previously
described (IED-IR: Coccaro, 2011, 2012). Diagnoses were
assessed and assigned through a best estimate process as
described in previous reports (Coccaro, 2012).
Treatment Characteristic of the Sample
No subject was taking any medical or psychotropic agent for
at least 4 weeks at the time of study and only 25 (19%) of the
subjects (all PC/IED) had any lifetime exposure to psycho-
tropic agents. Of these subjects, 19 had been exposed to
antidepressants, 5 to benzodiazepines, 3 to stimulants, and
2 each to antipsychotic, mood stabilizing, and sedative-
hypnotic agents. History of lifetime exposure to psychotropic
medication had no effect on FA values (F(1, 130) = 0.31,
p = 0.58). The same proportion had a history of formal
psychiatric treatment and this variable also had no effect on
FA values (F(1, 130) = 0.03, p = 0.88). Subjects were also
informed that initial and follow-up urine toxicology would
be performed randomly just before study; illicit drug use was
not detected in any subject reported herein.
Assessment of Aggression and Impulsivity
Aggression measures included the Aggression score from the
Life History of Aggression assessment (LHA; Coccaro et al,
1997) and the ‘physical’ and ‘verbal’ aggression scores from
the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ; Buss and
Perry, 1992). LHA aggression reflects a subject’s history of
actual aggressive behavior, whereas BPAQ aggression reflects
a subject’s self-assessment of his or her tendency to be
aggressive in given situations. Impulsivity measures included
the Impulsiveness Scale from the Life History of Impulsive
Behavior assessment (LHIB, Coccaro and Schmidt-Kaplan,
2012) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11
(BIS-11; Patton et al, 1995). LHIB impulsivity reflects a
subject’s history of actual impulsive behavior, whereas
BIS-11 impulsivity reflects a subject’s assessment of his or
her tendency to be impulsive. History of suicidal behavior
was assessed during the diagnostic work-up as previously
described (Coccaro, 2012).
Measures of Relevant Measures of Personality
General temperament was assessed using the Neuroticism,
Psychoticism, and Extraversion scales from the Eysenck
Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Psychopathic personality
traits were assessed using the Screening Version of the
Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-SV; Hare et al, 2003). The PCL-
SV has separate scores for the Callous/Unemotional (Part 1),
and for the Socially Deviant (Part 2), psychopathic traits.
Current global psychosocial function of subjects was assessed
by the Global Assessment of Function scale (GAF, APA, 1994).
Image Acquisition
Structural and DTI data were collected with a 3T Philips
MRI scanner (Best, The Netherlands). High-resolution
T1-weighted anatomical data were obtained with a 3D
magnetization-prepared

 has reduced sensitivity to image artifacts from eddy currents
and susceptibility-related distortions (Pipe and Zwart, 2006;
Arfanakis et al, 2005). The parameters for Turboprop-DTI
were: TR = 4000 ms, six spin-echoes per TR (ETL = 6), five
k-space lines per spin-echo, 120 samples per line, 12 blades
per image, field of view 24 cm × 24 cm, 40 axial slices, 3 mm

thickness,
256 × 256
reconstructed
image
matrix,
b = 750 s/mm2 for a set of 15 diffusion directions uniformly
distributed in 3D space, one b = 0 s/mm2 image volume, and
scan time of 17 min.
Image Processing
For each subject, the brain images were extracted from the
raw DTI data. The diffusion-weighted image volumes
were averaged, and a mean diffusion-weighted volume was
generated.
The
mean
diffusion-weighted
volume
was
then registered to the b = 0 s/mm2 volume using 3D rigid-
body registration. Each of the diffusion-weighted image
volumes was then registered to the new mean diffusion-
weighted volume, using rigid-body registration, to eliminate
any mismatch because of bulk motion. Eddy current and
susceptibility-related distortions are not present in Turbo-
prop-DTI data and therefore no correction was necessary.
The B-matrix was appropriately reoriented. The diffusion
tensor in each voxel was estimated using nonlinear tensor
fitting, and maps of the FA and trace of the diffusion
tensor were produced using TORTOISE (http://www.tortoi
sedti.org).
Statistical Analysis
TBSS was used to compare FA values across groups. Because
the location and course of white matter tracts differ between
individuals, there is a need to co-register FA maps across
individuals to permit voxelwise group comparisons of FA
(Smith et al, 2006). The high contrast between white and
gray matter FA makes minimizing the effects of any residual
misregistration of white matter tract FA maps essential in the
study of slender white matter tracts. TBSS addresses this
issue by projecting the highest FA information from each
individual’s white matter tracts onto a standardized white
matter skeleton. Following this process, FA maps from all
subjects were first nonlinearly spatially transformed to a
template, and the local FA maxima from each subject were
then projected onto the white matter skeleton, thereby reduc-
ing the effects of residual misregistration (Smith et al, 2006).
Linear regression models were used to test for differences
in FA values across groups, controlling for age, sex, lifetime
alcohol dependence, and any nonalcohol drug dependence.
Linear regression was used to test for differences in the trace
of the diffusion tensor across groups. The null distribution
was built using the ‘‘randomise’’ tool in FSL (FMRIB,
University of Oxford, UK) and 5000 permutations of the data
(Winkler et al, 2014). Differences were considered significant
at
po0.05,
familywise
error
(FWE)
corrected.
The
Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) method was
used to define clusters with significant differences (Smith
and Nichols, 2009).
The mean FA and trace values in clusters that showed
significant differences across groups were extracted for each
subject. Comparisons of regional values across groups were
performed by t-test, with correction for unequal variances
where necessary, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and by
the χ2 tests. Correlational analyses of regional tensor-derived
values with behavioral variables were conducted including
Pearson’s
correlation,
partial
correlation,
and
multiple
regression. A two-tailed α-value of 0.05 was used to denote
statistical significance, uncorrected for multiple comparisons.
Composite variables for ‘aggression,’ ‘impulsivity,’ and ‘im-
pulsive aggression’ were created in a data-reduction step by
taking the average of each subject’s z-scores for the primary
behavioral measures, as described in Coccaro et al (2010).
RESULTS
The demographic characteristics are displayed in Table 1.
These groups did not differ in age or distribution in gender
but did differ in distribution in race and Hollinghead’s
socioeconomic (SES) class. The difference in race was due to
more non-whites among the IED vs the HC/PC groups and
to more SES class I subjects among the PC vs the NC/IED
subjects.
Tract-Based Spatial Statistics Results
TBSS analysis revealed significantly lower FA values in IED
patients than healthy controls in two clusters within the
superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). These two clusters
were located in the SLF I and SLF II subdivisions (Figure 1)
(Makris et al, 2005). No other parts of the brain showed
significant FA or trace differences across groups. Mean FA

 values from these two clusters followed a normal distribu-
tion, and were highly correlated (r = 0.59, n = 132, po0.001).
FA of Clusters 1 and 2 as a Function of Subject Group
and Covariates
Multiple regression analysis revealed that among all demo-
graphics variables, only gender (B = 0.023 ± 0.009, β = 0.216,
t127 = 2.51,
p = 0.013)
and
SES
class
(B = 0.025 ± 0.010,
β = 0.221, t127 = 2.60, p = 0.010) correlated significantly with
regional FA values, with female gender and higher SES class
associated with higher FA values. Accordingly, these two
variables were used as covariates in the analyses reported
below. One-way ANOVA of the FA of cluster 1 (Figure 1)
revealed
a
significant
effect
of
group
(F(2, 129) = 9.9,
po0.001). The post hoc testing with Tukey’s method revealed
that IEDoPC (p = 0.03) and HC (po0.001) but PC and HC
were not significantly different. Adding gender and SES to
the model did not significantly change the results. One-way
ANOVA of the FA of cluster 2 (Figure 1) revealed a
significant effect of group (F(2, 129) = 10.35, po0.001). The
post hoc testing with Tukey’s method revealed that IEDoPC
(p = 0.03) and HC (po0.001) and PCoHC at a trend level of
significance (p = 0.07). Adding gender and SES to the model
did not significantly change the results.
FA and Impulsive Aggression
Across all subjects, a significant inverse correlation was
observed between FA value of cluster 1 and composite
impulsive aggression (r = − 0.428, n = 76, po0.001; Figure 2),
composite aggression (r = − 0.415, n = 76, po0.001), and
composite impulsivity (r = − 0.331, n = 76, po0.001). Partial
correlation, controlling for SES and sex, did not meaningfully
affect these relationships (composite impulsive aggression:
r = − 0.346, df= 72, po0.001; composite aggression: r =
− 0.418, df= 72, p = 0.004; composite impulsivity: r = − 0.332,
df = 73, po0.001). A similar pattern was seen with correla-
tions of the FA values of cluster 2 with composite impulsive
aggression (r = − 0.346, n = 76, p = 0.002; Figure 3), composite
aggression (r = − 0.305, n = 76, p = 0.007), and composite
impulsivity (r = − 0.297, n = 76, p = 0.009). Partial correlation,
controlling for SES and sex, did not meaningfully affect these
relationships (composite impulsive aggression: r = − 0.337,
df = 72, p = 0.003; composite aggression: r = − 0.294, df = 72,
p = 0.01; composite impulsivity: r = − 0.297, df = 73, p = 0.01).
Multiple regression analysis of the FA value of cluster
1 with the regressors PCL-SV ‘callous/unemotional’ traits
and PCL-SV ‘socially deviant’ traits and sex and SES as
covariates did not result in a significant model (F(4, 63) = 1.5,
p = 0.212). Similarly, multiple regression analysis of cluster
2
FA
values
did
not
result
in
a
significant
model
(F(4, 63) = 2.268, p = 0.07). These results suggest that in-
dividual differences in cluster 1 and cluster 2 FA values were
not significantly explained by psychopathy traits.
FA Values and History of Self-Directed Aggression in the
PC/IED Group
Among the PC/IED group, 14 (16%) had a life history of a
suicide attempt (SA+) and 8 (9%) had a life history of
self-injurious behavior (SIB). For cluster 1, FA values were
significantly lower among SA+ subjects controlling for SES
and
sex
(SA+:
0.536 ± 0.053
vs
SA − :
0.573 ± 0.052,
F(1, 127) = 5.183, p = 0.02). For cluster 2, FA values were
not significantly different (SA+: 0.511 ± 0.056 vs SA − :
0.544 ± 0.068, F(1, 127) = 2.531, p = 0.114). FA for clusters
1 and 2 did not differ as a function of a history of SIB,
controlling for SES and sex (cluster 1: SIB+ = 0.528 ± 0.067
vs SIB − = 0.545 ± 0.051, F(1, 127) = 2.369, p = 0.126; cluster
2: SIB+=0.519±0.072 vs SIB−: 0.541±0.067, F(1, 127)=0.459,
p=0.5).

participants.
FA Values and Personality Disorders
Four personality disorders (borderline, antisocial, narcissis-
tic, and avoidant) with sufficient representation in the
sample were assessed for their relationship to FA using
multivariate-ANCOVA. The four personality disorders were
distributed unequally across the PC and IED groups (see
Table 1). MANCOVA of cluster 1 FA values for these four
personality disorders, covarying for current IED, sex, and
SES, revealed that only borderline personality disorder
was associated with significantly
decreased
FA values
(F(1, 117) = 5.462, p = 0.02). No interactions were significant.
MANCOVA of cluster 2 FA values for these factors and
covariates revealed that only avoidant personality disorder
was associated with decreased FA values (F(1, 117) = 4.389,
p = 0.04). No interactions were significant.
DISCUSSION
Evidence was found for altered white matter integrity as
measured by FA in IED relative to normal control subjects in
the SLF. This is the first report linking white matter integrity
to adults with IED. The approach taken used TBSS and a
hypothesis-free
approach
with
correction
for
multiple
comparisons.
Although we are not aware of any other DTI studies in
adults with IED, DTI studies have been conducted in the
populations
with
the
related
conditions
of
borderline
personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and
conduct disorder. All three of these conditions are char-
acterized by problematic impulsivity.
BPD in adults has been associated with decreased FA in
the corpus callosum and white matter of the orbitofrontal
cortical regions (voxelwise analysis; Carrasco et al, 2012), the
corpus callosum and the dorsal anterior cingulate (Rüsch
et al, 2007), and the cingulum and fornix (Whalley et al,
2015). Two studies in adolescents with BPD found evidence
for decreased white matter integrity in the inferior long-
itudinal fasciculus in adolescents with BPD (not found in
adults with BPD in this study; New et al, 2013), the SLF, and
fornix (Maier-Hein et al, 2014). Our findings of decreased
FA in the SLF in IED as well as BPD is most similar to the
results found in adolescents with BPD.
In the case of antisocial personality disorder and the
related condition of conduct disorder, a somewhat similar
pattern of results has been reported. Criminal psychopathy
has previously been associated with decreased FA of the
uncinate fasciculus, the white matter track connecting the
amygdala to prefrontal cortex (Craig et al, 2009). A whole-
brain study of adults with ASPD similarly found decreased
FA in the uncinated fasciculus (Sundram et al, 2012), as well
as the genu of the corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital
fasciculus, anterior corona radiata, and the internal capsule.
In conduct disorder, an ROI-based study (Zhang et al, 2014)
found higher FA in the uncinate fasciculus in boys. A single
study has examined the relationship between aggression in
children with ADHD and white matter connectivity between
the frontal lobes and nucleus accumbens, using probabilistic
tractography (Cha et al, 2015). This study found evidence for
decreased frontal-accumbal white matter connectivity in
aggressive children with ADHD. These disparate findings
have not yet been replicated and remain preliminary.
However, the lack of overlap of DTI findings between
psychopathic traits and IED suggest that at the very least,
our
white
matter
findings
are not driven
exclusively

 psychopathic traits. Future studies should be conducted to
examine the extent to which white matter FA is differentially
related to hostile versus instrumental aggression.
The finding of white matter abnormalities in the SLF in
IED is somewhat unexpected but intriguing. The SLF
connects parietotemporal association areas with the frontal
lobe. Given the importance of the inferior parietal and
posterior temporal cortex in social cognition (Decety and
Lamm, 2007; Young et al, 2010), and evidence for disturbed
social cognition in IED (Coccaro et al, 2009), findings of
disrupted white matter connectivity in these tracts in IED
could be of considerable importance. First described by
Theodore Meynert (Wernicke, 1874), lesioning of the SLF
was proposed by Norman Geschwind to cause a set of
disconnection syndromes, characterized by impairments in
language and praxis (Geschwind, 1965a, b; Catani and
Ffytche, 2005). The SLF can be divided into four subcompo-
nents (Makris et al, 2005). SLF I, II, and III connect the
frontal lobes to the medial and superior parietal regions, the
caudal inferior parietal lobe, and rostral inferior parietal
lobule respectively. The arcuate fasciculus links the caudal
superior temporal gyrus to Broca’s area. These patterns of
connectivity would suggest that the SLF has a role in the
executive functions of motor planning, visuospatial working
memory, and language; this is confirmed by reports of
association of SLF white matter integrity with measures of
executive function (Sasson et al, 2013). Other psychiatric
disorders that have been associated with abnormal indices of
SLF white matter integrity include anorexia nervosa (Via
et al, 2014; Frieling et al, 2012) and borderline personality
disorder (Maier-Hein et al, 2014). Our finding of decreased
FA in SLF I and II indicates impaired connectivity between
the frontal lobes and medial, superior, and caudal inferior
parietal lobes. The cause of lower FA in the IED subjects
cannot be identified from this cross-sectional study. Previous
work has found that FA of the SLF is moderately heritable
(Blokland et al, 2012), suggesting a role for genetic factors.
In summary, we provide for the first time evidence for
subtle disruption of the long-range white matter tracks
connecting the parietal and temporal lobes to the frontal
cortex in IED. These disruptions have some specificity for
IED, as FA in the regions of the SLF identified with voxelwise
analysis is lower in IED compared with psychiatric controls.
