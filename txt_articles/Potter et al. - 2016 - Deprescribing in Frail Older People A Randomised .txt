Abstract
Objectives
Deprescribing has been proposed as a way to reduce polypharmacy in frail older people.
We aimed to reduce the number of medicines consumed by people living in residential aged
care facilities (RACF). Secondary objectives were to explore the effect of deprescribing on
survival, falls, fractures, hospital admissions, cognitive, physical, and bowel function, quality
of life, and sleep.
Methods
Ninety-five people aged over 65 years living in four RACF in rural mid-west Western Austra-
lia were randomised in an open study. The intervention group (n = 47) received a depre-
scribing intervention, the planned cessation of non-beneficial medicines. The control group
(n = 48) received usual care. Participants were monitored for twelve months from randomi-
sation. Primary outcome was change in the mean number of unique regular medicines. All
outcomes were assessed at baseline, six, and twelve months.
Results
Study participants had a mean age of 84.3±6.9 years and 52% were female. Intervention
group participants consumed 9.6±5.0 and control group participants consumed 9.5±3.6
unique regular medicines at baseline. Of the 348 medicines targeted for deprescribing (7.4
±3.8 per person, 78% of regular medicines), 207 medicines (4.4±3.4 per person, 59% of tar-
geted medicines) were successfully discontinued. The mean change in number of regular
medicines at 12 months was -1.9±4.1 in intervention group participants and +0.1±3.5 in con-
trol group participants (estimated difference 2.0±0.9, 95%CI 0.08, 3.8, p = 0.04). Twelve
intervention participants and 19 control participants died within 12 months of randomisation
(26% versus 40% mortality, p = 0.16, HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.30 to 1.22) There were no signifi-
cant differences between groups in other secondary outcomes. The main limitations of this
study were the open design and small participant numbers.

Introduction
People consume an increasing number of medicines as they age.[1,2] In Australia, two-thirds
of community dwelling adults aged 75 years and older are exposed to polypharmacy (the regu-
lar consumption of five or more medicines) and one in five take more than nine medicines
daily.[3] Other developed countries report similar levels of medicine use.[1,4,5] People living
in residential aged care facilities (RACF), particularly those with dementia, experience higher
rates of polypharmacy than their community-dwelling peers. Approximately 90% of people liv-
ing in Australian RACFs are prescribed five or more regular medicines and residents consume
seven to ten medicines daily.[6–8]
The benefits of many medicines in frail older people are unquantified. Twenty-five to fifty
per cent of clinical trials have a specific upper age limit and approximately 80% of clinical trials
exclude people with co-morbidities. [9,10] Treatment guidelines based on such trials are often
extrapolated to people who live in RACF despite an absence of evidence for benefit.[11] By
contrast, the risks from many medicines in older people are well established. Older people are
at high risk of adverse drug effects and toxicity due to reduced renal and liver function and
age-related changes in physiological reserve, body composition, and cellular metabolism.[12]
In frail older people the number needed to treat for some medicines is greater than the number
needed to harm. [13–15]
Differentiating between the adverse effects of polypharmacy and the adverse effects of the
co-morbidities targeted for treatment is difficult, but observational data suggest that polyphar-
macy independently increases the risk of frailty, falling, and hospital admission.[16,17] The
more medicines an individual takes, the greater their risk of experiencing an adverse drug reac-
tion, a drug-drug interaction, a drug-disease interaction, cascade prescribing, non-adherence,
and drug errors (wrong drug, wrong dose, missed doses, erroneous dosing frequency).[18–21]
Older people exposed to polypharmacy are not only at risk of harm from some of their medi-
cines, they are also less likely to receive medicines that could help them. [6,22]
The cure for polypharmacy appears simple, doctors should prescribe and patients consume
fewer medicines. Effecting this cure is not straight-forward. There are many barriers to reduc-
ing polypharmacy in practice, not least a lack of confidence on the part of doctors about when
and how to cease medicines. [23,24] Doctors receive a great deal of information about the indi-
cations for starting medicines but very little guidance on when and how to stop them. In the
absence of evidence to guide decision-making, doctors may feel it is simpler and safer to con-
tinue prescribing medicines than to discontinue them.[25,26]
Several randomised controlled trials in frail older people have investigated the effects of
deprescribing, the planned cessation of non-beneficial medicines.[27–29] Deprescribing

 appears to reduce inappropriate medicine use but the effect on clinical endpoints such as hos-
pital admissions and survival remains uncertain.
The primary objective of this study was to determine whether deprescribing would reduce
the total number of medicines taken by frail older people living in RACF. Secondary objectives
were to explore the effect of deprescribing on survival, falls, fractures, hospital admissions, cog-
nitive, physical, and bowel function, quality of life, and sleep.
Materials and Methods
Ethics
This study obtained ethics approval from the University of Western Australia Human Research
Ethics committee (RA/4/1/4517) and the WA Country Health Service Board Research Ethics
Committee (ID 2011:21). Written informed consent was obtained from all competent partici-
pants. Written informed consent for the participation of people who were not competent was
sought from the next of kin (NOK) or legal guardian. The study was conducted in accordance
with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Design
Participants were randomised to an intervention (deprescribing) or control group (usual care)
in a 1:1 ratio in an open trial with a parallel design.
Participants
Every person living in an RACF in Geraldton, Western Australia (population ~40 500, 3
RACF, 241 beds) and Dongara, Western Australia (population ~3 800, 1 RACF, 6 beds)
between July 2011 and December 2013 was screened for inclusion in the study. Residents were
eligible to participate if they were aged 65 years or older. Residents were excluded if they were
taking no regular medicines, were in the final terminal stages of an illness, or if their usual gen-
eral practitioner (GP) or the RACF nurse manager did not agree to their participation.
Intervention
The intervention was an individualised medicine review followed by the planned cessation of
non-beneficial medicines. Both groups received a medicine review but only intervention group
participants were deprescribed. Both groups received regular monitoring visits from KP (a gen-
eral practitioner) and usual care from their own GPs. The intention of deprescribing was to
reduce the total number of unique medicines consumed by intervention group participants.
Medicine review.
All RACF residents received their regular oral medicines from a per-
sonal blister pack supplied weekly from a community pharmacy. A nurse administered each
medicine dose, including regular medicines given by a non-oral route (eye drops, ear drops,
skin lotions, ointments, analgesic patches, and insulin injections), and signed a pharmacy-gen-
erated administration record indicating if the medicine had been given, withheld, or declined.
Records of the date, time, and dose of all pro re nata (PRN) and nurse-initiated medicines were
also kept.
KP compiled a list of all medicines used by each participant at baseline from the drug chart
and the most recent administration record. Discrepancies between the drug chart and the
administration record were resolved by inspecting the blister pack. Participants were asked to
list all self-administered medicines. The generic name, dose, frequency, and route of adminis-
tration of all medicines available for use by the participant were recorded. The number of doses

 of each PRN, nurse-initiated, and self-administered medicines consumed in the preceding
month were recorded.
A medicine-focused clinical history was compiled from the RACF medical records and
progress notes by KP. She also interviewed each participant, their NOK, the nurse manager,
and/or treating doctor. An indication was recorded for each medicine. Relevant co-morbidities,
contraindications, and possible adverse effects were recorded; for example, regular nose bleeds
or unexplained iron deficiency anaemia in a resident taking aspirin or anticoagulants, recurrent
falls or postural hypotension in a resident on antihypertensive agents. Participants and nursing
staff were asked specifically about possible medicine side effects, for example a dry mouth or
urinary dysfunction in people taking anticholinergic medicines, ankle oedema and constipation
in people taking calcium-channel blockers. Participants were asked if they were still experienc-
ing symptoms that were the intended target of specific treatments, for example reflux symp-
toms in people taking a proton-pump inhibitor, joint pain in people taking paracetamol or a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. All participants were asked whether they experienced any of
the following common medication side effect symptoms: nausea, constipation, diarrhoea,
abdominal pains, dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, insomnia, skin rash or itch, cough, ankle
swelling, and dry eyes. Frequency (not during past month, less than once per week, once or
more per week, daily or almost daily) and severity (causing mild, moderate, or severe distress)
were recorded for any symptoms reported. KP examined all participants for cachexia, muscle
wasting, tremor, rashes, cough, dyspnoea, heart murmurs, basal crepitation, ankle oedema, and
for signs of discomfort, depression, anxiety, agitation, and/or confusion.
One experienced registered nurse (RN) performed baseline assessments. KP repeated the
assessments on the first five participants after one week and results were compared to ensure
consistency. The baseline assessments consisted of blood pressure (three sitting or lying blood
pressures taken at five minute intervals followed by a standing or sitting blood pressure), tibial
length, weight (most recent weight recorded by the RACF), symptom check list (described
above), and bowel function assessed over the previous 14 days from the most recent bowel
chart (number of bowel motions, any episodes of faecal incontinence, number of episodes of
faecal incontinence, number of days with no bowel motion). The RN used validated question-
naires to assess cognitive function,[30] (30) sleep quality, quality of life and self-reported gen-
eral health.[31] (31) She also interviewed a carer to assess sleep quality and physical function.
Deprescribing.
Two investigators (KP, a general practitioner, and CEB, a geriatrician/clin-
ical pharmacologist) independently identified deprescribing targets using a list of potentially
inappropriate medicines (S1 Table). [32–37] They used baseline data (clinical history and
examination findings, baseline MMSE and MBI scores, BP measurements, weight, bowel func-
tion, and side-effects questionnaire)to test each target medicine against four deprescribing cri-
teria defined in Fig 1.
Medicines intended for symptom relief were considered for deprescribing if symptoms were
stable according to pre-defined criteria (S2 Table). The investigators determined which medi-
cines required dose tapering prior to cessation and planned a cessation order. First they tar-
geted medicines causing active harm to the participant (contraindicated medicines, toxic
medicines with no clear indication, medicines causing significant adverse effects). Next they
targeted medicines unlikely to be benefitting the participant and unlikely to cause adverse with-
drawal effects (eg. multivitamins in people with an adequate nutritional intake, aspirin and
statins in people with no history of vascular disease). Then they targeted medicines with possi-
ble adverse effects and a high potential for adverse withdrawal reactions or rebound symptoms
(eg. benzodiazapines, anti-reflux medicines, antihypertensives, antidepressants). Finally they
targeted low risk medicines intended for symptomatic relief where symptoms were stable (eg.
paracetamol, sorbolene cream, osmotic laxatives).

 When both investigators had completed a medicine withdrawal plan for each participant (an
individualised list of target medicines with dose tapering recommendations and cessation
order), they compared the plans and discussed any discrepancies to generate a final consensus
medicine withdrawal plan. Group allocation was revealed after the consensus plan was finalised.
GPs were advised in writing of group allocation and asked to proceed according to their
clinical judgement if they wished to start or stop any medicine during the trial period. They
were given the individualised medicine withdrawal plans for each intervention group partici-
pant and asked to identify any medicines that should not be stopped. All participants and/or
NOK were advised of group allocation. KP discussed the medicine withdrawal plan with inter-
vention group participants and/or NOK and removed from the plan any medicines they
declined to cease. Control group participants and/or NOK were advised to discuss any medi-
cine-related concerns with their own GP.
The medicine withdrawal plan, amended to reflect changes requested by participant, NOK,
or GP, was implemented over several months. In the first five participants, individual medicines
were ceased sequentially with two weeks between withdrawals or dose changes. The study proto-
col was subsequently amended to allow the withdrawal of up to three medicines simultaneously,
provided the medicines were unlikely to cause adverse withdrawal effects or that any adverse
withdrawal effects or symptom recurrence would be attributable to a single culprit medicine.
Before ceasing or reducing the dose of medicines likely to cause adverse withdrawal effects KP
discussed potential adverse effects with the participant and/or carers. If an RN did not want a
medicine stopped, cessation was not attempted. Dose reductions and cessation orders were
faxed or emailed to the pharmacist and GP. Expected cessation date, dose changes, and a
description of possible adverse withdrawal effects were recorded in the participant’s notes.
KP reviewed participants weekly during deprescribing. She measured blood pressure, elic-
ited any symptoms related to the medicine changes and examined the participant for signs of
distress and/or adverse medicine withdrawal effects. She inspected blister packs to confirm
dose change or cessation, checked progress notes for reports of adverse withdrawal effects or
symptom recurrence, and asked carers if they had observed any changes in the participant. If
withdrawal effects or signs or symptoms of disease recurrence were confirmed, the depre-
scribed medicine was restarted and the GP informed of the withdrawal failure. All participants
were reviewed on each RACF visit to ensure control group participants were visited as fre-
quently as intervention group participants. Control group participants had blood pressure
measured and were asked if they had any concerns at each visit. Any significant issues in con-
trol group participants were reported to nursing staff for appropriate follow-up.
Outcomes
Primary outcome. The primary outcome was the mean change in the number of unique
regular medicines consumed by participants at 12 months post-randomisation. The total num-
ber of regular medicines was comprised of all regular medicines, any PRN, nurse-initiated or
self-administered medicine that had been used more frequently than once per week during the
preceding 3 month period (>13 doses), and any short term medicine (eg. antibiotics, topical
steroids) being used by the participant on the date of the 12 month follow-up. A medicine was
defined as any prescribed, non-prescribed, complementary, or alternative medicine. Medicines
were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) system. Medicines with
a single active ingredient were counted as a one medicine. The active ingredients of combina-
tion products were counted as individual medicines if available in a similar dose and form as a
single medicine (Australian Medicines Handbook [38]) and an ATC code for the intended
therapeutic purpose existed. Alternative and complementary medicines were allocated an ATC
Deprescribing in Frail Older People: A Randomised Controlled Trial

 code that most accurately reflected their intended therapeutic purpose. Multivitamins, mineral
supplements, topical treatments, eye drops, and haemorrhoid creams were counted as a single
medicine unless the criteria for combination products were met.
Secondary outcomes
• Survival at 12 months post-randomisation.
• Proportion of participants experiencing a fall or non-vertebral fracture (confirmed by radio-
logical assessment). A fall was defined as anything reported as a fall in the progress notes or
any incident where a participant was found kneeling, sitting, or lying on the floor by NOK or
an RACF staff member.
• Proportion of participants experiencing an unplanned hospital admission or out-of-hours
GP visit (defined as an unscheduled GP visit before 8am or after 6pm on a weekday or on a
Saturday or Sunday or an ambulance call where the participant was not transported to
hospital).
• Change in the mean number of medicines consumed by participants at three, six and nine
months.
The outcomes listed above were assessed by KP who was aware of treatment allocation. She
recorded these data from the RACF progress notes and medicine charts every three months.
The outcomes listed below were assessed by one RN who was blind to treatment allocation.
These outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires (unless otherwise specified) at
baseline, six, and twelve months.
• Cognitive function assessed with the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE).[30]
• Physical function assessed by proxy with the Modified Barthel Index (MBI).[39]
• Bowel function assessed using the RACF bowel chart.
• Self-reported quality of life assessed with Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Dementia
(QOLAD).[40]
• Self-reported general health assessed with the EQ-5D.[31]
• Sleep quality assessed by proxy with the Neuropsychiatric Index—Nursing Home Version
(NPI-NH) in all participants and self-assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(PSQI) in participants with an MMSE score >23. [41,42]
Sample size
This trial was designed to have adequate power to detect a clinically relevant change in the
number of unique regular medicines at 12 months. A clinically relevant reduction in medicines
was assumed to be between one and two regular medicines per person. A secondary objective
was to explore the effect of deprescribing on other clinical outcomes. We planned to enrol 250
participants. This number would have given us adequate power to detect a mean change of
±1.34 in the number of medicines (α = 0.05 and 1-β = 0.8, SD 3.9). The total number of eligible
RACF residents in Geraldton and Dongara during the recruitment period was 324 however,
and we were unsuccessful in establishing a second recruitment site. Consequently, our partici-
pant numbers were too small to precisely estimate the effect of deprescribing on the secondary
outcomes.

 Randomisation
The random allocation sequence was generated prospectively by a statistician who used a digi-
tal random number generator to create permuted blocks of 2, 4, 6, and 8. The group (A or B)
was printed on a slip of paper and sealed in an opaque envelope by the statistician. Envelopes
were labelled consecutively from 1 to 250. Participants were assigned an envelope in the order
in which they were enrolled. The envelopes were opened to reveal allocation only after the
medication review, medication withdrawal plan, and baseline assessments were complete.
Blinding
The RN who performed baseline and secondary outcome assessments was blind to group allo-
cation. The primary investigator (KP), community pharmacists, GPs, participants, NOK, and
RACF nurses and carers were all aware of group allocation.
Statistical methods
Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with per protocol statistical tests. SPSS v.22
was used for statistical analyses. The primary outcome of change in the mean number of
unique regular medicines at one year was assessed with an independent t-test. Mortality was
assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Cox proportional hazards model was used
to compare survival in the intervention and control groups. Fisher’s exact test was used to com-
pare the proportion of participants in each group who had experienced an after-hours GP visit,
a hospital admission, a fall, or a fracture at six and twelve months post-enrolment. The MMSE,
MBI, QOLAD, EQ-5D, PQSI and NPI-NH sleep scores at six and twelve months were com-
pared using generalised linear models adjusted for age, sex, and number of regular medicines
at baseline. The models used were random effects linear models with maximum likelihood esti-
mation for the EQ-5D, MMSE, QOLAD and PSQI scores and a random effects negative bino-
mial model for the MBI and NPI-NH scores. These models included a test for group effect,
time effect and a time�group interaction. P-values for all tests are reported and p-values of less
than 0.05 are considered significant. The study was inadequately powered to assess secondary
outcomes. The secondary analyses should be viewed as hypothesis-generating and the p-values
interpreted with caution. All data are reported as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise
stated.
Results
Participant recruitment
Every individual living in an RACF in Dongara or Geraldton between 19th July 2011 and 12th
November 2013 was screened for eligibility (n = 324). Approximately one third of the eligible
population were enrolled in the trial (n = 100, 31%). Three quarters of the participants (n = 75)
had cognitive impairment (MMSE score <24) and their NOK were required to provide formal
consent to participation. All participants were followed for twelve months from randomisation
or until death. Two participants (1 control, 1 intervention) died less than 72 hours before their
final assessment was due and one participant (control) was moribund on the due date for his
final assessment. The medicines, adverse outcomes, and bowel function data from these partici-
pants were included in the 12 month analyses but other secondary outcomes were not col-
lected. There was no difference between the groups in the frequency of review visits during the
study period (intervention group 16 ± 7 review visits, control group 15 ± 6 review visits, esti-
mated difference 0.91, 95% CI -1.88, 3.69, p = 0.52). Fig 2 shows recruitment and participation.

 Baseline data
Table 1 shows baseline demographic data, clinical characteristics, and medicines data for each
group. A greater proportion of study participants were male than the screened population
(0.48 versus 0.35, p = 0.02), but the mean age of participants and eligible non-participants
was similar (84 ± 7 years versus 85 ± 7, p = 0.32). Control group participants had a lower
mean systolic blood pressure than intervention group participants at baseline (standing BP of

 114 mmHg versus 135mmHg, p<0.001). The reason for this difference is unclear. Similar pro-
portions of control group and intervention group participants were taking at least one antihy-
pertensive agent at baseline (n = 33, 69% versus n = 27, 57%, p = 0.20) and the mean number of
antihypertensive agents did not differ significantly between groups (2.2 ± 1.2 versus 1.9 ± 1.2,

not significant. However RACF medical records are not a complete clinical record and we are
thus unable to verify the accuracy or completeness of the listed diagnoses.
Primary outcome
Fig 3 shows deprescribing outcomes in the intervention group. Two intervention group par-
ticipants had no medicines suitable for cessation. At least one medicine was ceased in 89% of
participants (42/47 participants) and 4.4 ± 3.4 medicines per person were successfully
ceased. Withdrawal was either not attempted or failed for 41% of the medicines selected for
deprescribing (n = 141/348 medicines). The main reasons for no withdrawal attempt were
participant death or withdrawal from the study (n = 33 medicines, 9% of targets), investiga-
tor decision against cessation (n = 29 medicines, 8% of targets), and participant decision to
continue a medicine (n = 16 medicines, 5% of targets). Withdrawal failures were due to the
medicine being restarted (n = 28 medicines, 8% of targets) or dose reduction without cessa-
tion (n = 19 medicines, 5% of targets).
Table 2 shows withdrawal success rates for the most frequently deprescribed medicines
(targeted in ten or more participants). Medicines with highest withdrawal success rates were
bisphosphonates, aspirin, iron supplements (8/9, 89%), angiotensin II antagonists, vitamin
and mineral supplements, and statins. Medicines with the lowest withdrawal success rates
were anti-epileptics (2/8, 25%), laxatives, analgesics, antidepressants, proton-pump inhibi-
tors, and benzodiazepines. The full list of medicines targeted for deprescribing is reported in
S4 Table.
Fig 4 shows change in the mean number of unique regular medicines consumed by partici-
pants during the study period. At 12 months the mean change was -1.9 ± 4.1 in the intervention
group and +0.1 ± 3.5 in the control group (estimated difference 2.0 ± 0.9, 95%CI 0.08, 3.8,
t = 2.09, df = 65, p = 0.04). The maximal change in number of medicines occurred at six month
post-randomisation (-2.3 ± 3.1 versus +0.2 ± 2.5, estimated difference 2.5, 95% CI 1.3, 3.8,
t = 3.98, df 76, p<0.001) Although 4.4 ± 3.4 regular medicines per participant were successfully
deprescribed (no longer consumed at the last follow-up assessment), many new medicines were
started during the study period. Eighty per cent of surviving intervention participants and 72%
of surviving control participants were taking at least one new regular medicine at 12 months
(2.9 ± 2.0 new medicines in 28 participants versus 3.0 ± 2.1 in 23 participants, p = 0.85). The
most commonly prescribed new medicines in the intervention group were laxatives (A06,
n = 12), analgesics (N02, n = 8), eye drops (S01, n = 6), topical antifungal agents (D01, n = 5),
and vitamins (A11, n = 5). Skin emollients (D02, n = 8), analgesics (N02, n = 7), inhaled agents
for obstructive airways disease (R03, n = 6), and laxatives (A06, n = 5) were the most commonly
initiated new medicines in the control group. The full list of new regular medicines prescribed
for surviving participants at 12 months is reported in S5 Table.

event was in an intervention group participant (acute coronary syndrome, an elevated troponin
rise only, no ECG changes). Two intervention group participants experienced significant
adverse medicine withdrawal reactions. One man was admitted to hospital in October 2012
with symptomatic rapid atrial fibrillation following cessation of his amiodarone in May 2012.
The second man became agitated when his oxazepam dose was reduced from twice daily dos-
ing to once daily dosing. Both participants withdrew from the study after these events but their
data were included in analyses. Other adverse outcomes are reported in Table 5.

 Mortality
Survival data are presented in Fig 5. In the twelve months from randomisation there were 12
deaths in the intervention group (26% mortality) and 19 deaths in the control group (40% mor-
tality, χ2 1.9, df 1, p = 0.16, HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.30 to 1.22)
Discussion
Deprescribing reduced the number of regular medicines consumed by frail older people living
in residential care in rural Western Australia. Risk-modifying medicines (aspirin, statins, anti-
hypertensives, bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D) were more successfully deprescribed
than symptom-modifying medicines (analgesics, laxatives, antidepressants, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics). The reduction in medicines at twelve months (two medicines per person) was half
the number of medicines ceased during the trial (four medicines per person) and considerably
smaller than the number of medicines selected for deprescribing (seven to eight medicines per
person), confirming the difficulty of reducing polypharmacy in practice.
The main weakness of this study is the small sample size. We were unable to accurately esti-
mate the effect of deprescribing on clinical outcomes other than the number of prescribed
medicines or rule out adverse effects from the intervention. In addition, there were differences
between groups at baseline in blood pressure and in medical diagnoses that may have affected
the secondary outcomes, including survival rates.
The open design, while representing actual clinical practice, is also a major weakness, mak-
ing it difficult to eliminate treatment biases or informal deprescribing in control group partici-
pants. Our protocol allowed GPs, RNs, and/or NOK to decline the cessation of any medicine in
cognitively impaired participants. Although this might have hindered effective deprescribing,
our data show that fewer than 4% of planned cessations were vetoed by a GP, nurse, or family
member.
More than three-quarters of our study participants had dementia. Many of these people had
difficulty reporting symptoms or adverse medicine withdrawal effects. We regularly checked
progress notes and asked RACF staff about specific withdrawal symptoms, but we may have

 underestimated the negative effects of deprescribing in this population. People with advanced
dementia were also unable to reliably complete sleep, quality of life and self-reported general
health assessments. Our data on these outcomes are incomplete and unreliable. Using a proxy
to assess these outcomes would have strengthened the data.
The main strength of this study is that we actively deprescribed rather than relying on indi-
rect deprescribing methods such as recommendations to prescribers. The RACF setting meant
we had accurate records of the medicines being consumed by our participants and we were
able to confirm that deprescribed medicines were actually ceased. We minimised potential
sources of bias by having a blinded research nurse assess the more subjective outcomes. Addi-
tional strengths are a randomised design with prospective registration of the protocol, per-pro-
tocol statistical analyses, and an appropriate control group treated as similarly as possible to
the intervention group.
A 2008 systematic review of 31 studies that withdrew a single class of medicine in older peo-
ple reported that diuretics, antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, and psychotropic agents could
often be withdrawn without causing harm, but that psychotropics had a high rate of post-trial
re-instatement.[43] High quality deprescribing studies that cease more than one class of medi-
cine are rarer. Garfinkel et al. conducted two non-randomised deprescribing studies in a geriat-
ric hospital and in community-dwelling older adults and achieved significant reductions in
Fig 5. Kaplan Meier survival plot to 12 months post-randomisation.

 medicine use in both cohorts and significant improvements in survival and self-assessed gen-
eral health respectively.[34,35] Gallagher et al. and Dalleur et al. conducted randomised studies
using the Screening Tool of Older People’s Prescriptions (STOPP) to reduce the use of poten-
tially inappropriate medicines (PIMs) in older hospital inpatients.[27,28,44] Gallagher et al.
reported significantly reduced PIMs use in the intervention group at discharge and 6 months
post-discharge, no change in the rate of hospital readmission, and non-significant reductions
in falls, all cause-mortality, and GP visits during the 6 month follow-up period in 382 people
aged 65 years and older.[27] Dalleur et al. enrolled frail inpatients aged over 75 years and
reported reduced PIMs use in the intervention group on discharge, although the proportion of
people prescribed at least one PIM was not altered.[28] Another recent randomised study
investigated the effect of nurse training on potentially harmful medicine use in 227 residents of
assisted living facilities in Helsinki and reported a small reduction in the use of potentially
harmful medicines (-0.43, p = 0.004), fewer days in hospital, and a non-significant increase in
mortality at 12 months in intervention group participants.[29]
Indirect deprescribing using education, medicine reviews, and advice to prescribers has
been more frequently reported than direct deprescribing interventions where medicines are
actively ceased by researchers. Indirect interventions achieve only small reductions in the num-
ber of medicines consumed by older people.[45] Consequently the impact of indirect interven-
tions on clinical outcomes other than prescribing patterns is frequently insignificant or
unreported. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of pharmacist-led medication
reviews on hospital admissions and mortality in older people reported a small reduction in the
mean number of prescribed medicines (-0.48, 95% CI -0.89, -0.07) but no significant effect on
hospital admissions (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87, 1.14, p = 0.92) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.82,
1.13, p = 0.65).[46]
Our results, when combined with evidence from these earlier studies, suggest that it may be
possible to deprescribe in frail older people without adversely affecting survival or outcomes
related to quality of life. We found that risk-modifying medicines with no symptomatic benefit
were simple to deprescribe. We considered cessation of these medicines to be appropriate in
people close to death where quality of life was a higher priority than extending survival. Our
follow-up period was too short and participant numbers too small to determine whether dis-
continuation of these medicines would ultimately increase fracture and vascular event rates,
but the theoretical risk of these events should be weighed against futility of treatment in people
with very limited life expectancy and the potential for improved quality of life through reduced
adverse drug effects and a reduced pill burden. Decision-making about symptom-modifying
medicines was more difficult, particularly in people with cognitive impairment who were
unable to reliably report symptoms. We were able to cease analgesics, laxatives, anti-reflux
remedies, antidepressants, hypnotics, and anxiolytics without incident in 40% to 70% of people
in whom withdrawal was attempted. These results suggest that withdrawal of symptom-modi-
fying medicine is worth attempting if symptoms are stable and people are adequately moni-
tored during and after deprescribing.
Quality deprescribing, as with good prescribing, requires the patient to be at the centre of
the process. The risks of each medicine need to be weighed against the expected benefits in this
specific person at this specific point in their life, taking into account their preferences and
expectations, their likely prognosis, their co-morbidities, their symptoms, their other medi-
cines, and the wishes and expectations of their family or carers. This is not a straightforward
process and there is no simple list, guideline, or algorithm that will make it so. The protocol
used in this study provides some guidance for doctors who wish to deprescribe. The results,
while requiring confirmation in larger studies, suggest that careful deprescribing is unlikely to
harm patients.
