Abstract: Neuropathic pain (NeuP) is a syndrome that results from damaged nerves and/or 
aberrant regeneration. Common etiologies of neuropathy include chronic illnesses and medica-
tion use. Chronic disorders, such as diabetes and alcoholism, can cause neuronal injury and 
consequently NeuP
. Certain medications with antineoplastic effects also carry an exquisitely 
high risk for neuropathy. These culprits are a few of many that are fueling the NeuP epidemic, 
which currently affects 7%–10% of the population. It has been estimated that approximately 10% 
and 7% of US adults carry a diagnosis of diabetes and alcohol disorder, respectively. Despite 
its pervasiveness, many physicians are unfamiliar with adequate treatment of NeuP
, partly due 
to the few reviews that are available that have integrated basic science and clinical practice. In 
light of the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that advise against the 
routine use of μ-opioid receptor-selective opioids for chronic pain management, such a review 
is timely. Here, we provide a succinct overview of the etiology and treatment options of diabetic 
and alcohol- and drug-induced neuropathy, three different and prevalent neuropathies fusing 
the combined clinical and preclinical pharmacological expertise in NeuP of the authors. We 
discuss the anatomy of pain and pain transmission, with special attention to key ion channels, 
receptors, and neurotransmitters. An understanding of pain neurophysiology will lead to a better 
understanding of the rationale for the effectiveness of current treatment options, and may lead 
to better diagnostic tools to help distinguish types of neuropathy. We close with a discussion of 
ongoing research efforts to develop additional treatments for NeuP
.

Introduction
Neuropathic pain (NeuP) arises from aberrant or incomplete regeneration of damaged 
nerves, and is characterized by hyperalgesia and allodynia, enhanced sensitivity to 
pain, and exaggerated pain response to normal stimuli.1 The prevalence of NeuP varies 
around the world, but has been cited as at a minimum of 3%,2–4 and true prevalence 
has been estimated to be around 7%–10%.5 The incidence of NeuP also varies by type, 
as categorized by the mechanism of injury: diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropa-
thy, and medication-induced neuropathy.6 A concerning trend in the US is the rise in 
diagnosis of neuropathies caused by type 2 diabetes.7 This may in part be fueled by 
increased health care costs hampering proper management of diabetes (diabetes.org).8 
Alcoholic neuropathy in the US occurs in roughly 65% of patients diagnosed with an 
alcohol-use disorder.9 Anticancer medications, especially taxanes, are also known to 
cause neuropathy. A study found that 100% of patients receiving paclitaxel developed

symptoms of neuropathy.10 On a clinical level, NeuP trans-
lates to a complex syndrome that is often multidrug-resistant 
and unresponsive to alternative therapies. Therefore, it is 
imperative that clinicians understand the etiology of NeuP 
and the mechanism and effectiveness of the current repertoire 
of treatments.
Significance and limitations
In this integrative review, an internal medicine physician 
and preclinical behavioral pharmacologist summarize dif-
ferences and overlap in etiologies and treatment options for 
NeuP
. This review focuses on three of the most common 
neuropathies – diabetic, alcohol-induced, and drug-induced 
neuropathy – describes the specific nerve fibers associated 
with each neuropathy, and lists recommended treatment 
options for NeuP
. The review is purposely succinct, aimed 
at providing clinicians with insight into the etiology of NeuP 
and educating preclinical scientists on the diagnosis and 
choice of treatment for NeuP
. The review favors conciseness 
over an extensive in-depth analysis of the available literature, 
thus limiting its scope.
Materials and methods
A PubMed search was performed to identify clinical and 
preclinical studies detailing etiology and treatment of NeuP
. 
Emphasis was given to articles published in the last 10 years, 
with older articles used primarily to provide a frame of 
reference.
Basic anatomy of pain
Comprehending the pathophysiology of peripheral neu-
ropathy and the mechanism of action for drugs requires a 
basic appreciation of the anatomy of the somatosensory 
system, especially with respect to pain. Noxious stimuli, 
such as thermal, chemical, and high-threshold mechanical 
stimuli, are detected in the periphery and conducted to the 
spinal cord via two types of small fibers. The C fibers are 
unmyelinated, slow-conducting, and localize pain poorly. 
The Aδ fibers are thinly myelinated, faster-conducting, and 
localize pain better.11,12 Larger and more thickly myelin-
ated than Aδ fibers are Aα and Aβ fibers, which primarily 
transmit information about proprioception and vibration.13 
It is primarily the Aδ and C fibers that are indiscriminately 
affected in the different types of neuropathies (Figure 1). 
Measuring which type of fibers are impacted is not trivial, 
but can be attempted by clinical examination; loss of tactile 
or vibratory skin sensation or tendon reflexes are indicative 
of large-fiber neuropathy, whereas alterations in lower-limb 
pinprick sensation and a visual analog scale pain score >40 
suggest small-fiber neuropathy.14 Small-fiber neuropathy can 
also be determined by measuring intraepidermal nerve-fiber 
density following biopsy.15 Aδ-fiber neuropathy can be mea-

Integrated perspective on neuropathic pain
sured noninvasively by laser evoked-potential16,17 and contact 
heat-evoked potential.18,19 Nerve-conducting studies are a 
useful technique for NeuP research, but less relevant for 
clinical studies, as they primarily measure Aβ-fiber function, 
which supersedes small-fiber neuropathy20 and is laborious.21
Receptors on primary sensory neurons convert environ-
mental stimuli, such as pain, into an electrical signal that is 
transmitted to the dorsal root ganglia, with an important role 
for sodium channels.22,23 In the terminals of the dorsal root 
ganglia, neurons subsequently convert this electric signal into 
chemical signals by releasing neurotransmitters and neuro-
peptides, including glutamate, substance P
, and calcitonin 
gene-related peptide into the dorsal horn ( 
Figure 1). A sig-
nificant event that occurs during the development of a chronic 
pain state is central sensitization, where postsynaptic gluta-
mate (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic 
acid [AMPA] and N-methyl-d-aspartate [NMDA]) receptors 
become increasingly more adaptive in transmitting pain 
signals.24–28 Activation of presynaptic calcium channels can 
reduce the release of neurotransmitters and dampen central 
sensitization (Figure 1).29,30 In the spinal cord, this nocicep-
tive signal can be modulated by inhibitory interneurons using 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine as their main neu-
rotransmitters. Following the reception of a pain signal in the 
cortical structures of the brain, the experience of pain can still 
be suppressed by a descending system that originates from 
the brain stem. This efferent system attenuates the afferent 
signal via neurotransmitters, such as endogenous opioids, 
serotonin, and noradrenaline.31–33
Diagnosis of neuropathic pain
The diagnosis of NeuP is usually made on clinical grounds. 
Screening questionnaires are available for NeuP
, including 
the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs,34 
PainDetect,35 and Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4).36 Of 
these, the DN4 has the higher sensitivity and specificity. 
The DN4 is a questionnaire that consists of four questions 
and incorporates both subjective and objective information, 
namely the patient’s perception of pain and the physician’s 
exam findings. It has been validated as a screening tool for 
different types of NeuP
, including diabetic neuropathy, and 
has sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 92%, respectively, 
at a score cutoff of 4.36 At a score cutoff of 3, sensitivity and 
specificity are 84%.36 While these screening tools are useful, 
the diagnosis ultimately hinges on the clinician’s intuition 
from effective interviewing and physical examination. 
Symptoms of neuropathy can range from hypoalgesia and 
paresthesia (tingling) to hyperalgesia, especially prominent 
in the distal extremities, known as the “stocking and glove” 
distribution. Patients with neuropathy may exhibit a painful 
response to benign stimuli, such as light touch from a cotton 
swab or a finger. Patients may also exhibit an attenuated/
exaggerated response to a pinprick. These phenomena are 
known as allodynia and hypo/hyperalgesia, respectively. As 
the neuropathy progresses, more severe symptoms, including 
burning sensations and electric shocks, can arise. Symptoms 
are aggravated during rest and prolonged weakness and sen-
sory loss in extremities; particularly feet can culminate in gait 
impairment.37 Because the diagnosis is based on subjective 
data, it can sometimes be challenging for the physician to 
track response to therapeutics. With this said, the threshold 
to treat NeuP is exceedingly low, given the good side-effect 
profile of most drugs. In our experience, most physicians 
would trial a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
(SNRI) if a patient complained of burning pain, even if no 
other findings were present.
Three major types of neuropathy
Diabetic neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common microvas-
cular complications of diabetes. It has been estimated that 
~50% of diabetics suffer from peripheral neuropathy,38 and 
50% of these neuropathies are considered at least moderate in 
severity.39–41 Histological studies suggest that primarily small 
C fibers are affected by diabetes and glucose intolerance,42–45 
although Aδ fibers have also been shown to be affected by 
type 1 and type 2 diabetes.46–48 Morbidities associated with 
diabetic neuropathy amount to more than $10 billion in the 
US.49
Diabetes or glucose intolerance can impair vasodilation 
and lead to ischemia, which is thought to be central to the 
pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy, including trigeminal 
neuralgia.50,51 A recent study demonstrated that patients with 
glucose intolerance, even without carrying the diagnosis 
of diabetes, exhibited C-fiber neuropathy, highlighting the 
devastating effect of prolonged hyperglycemia on neuronal 
health.52 On a molecular level, there are at least five prevailing 
mechanisms of how hyperglycemia leads to different com-
plications of diabetes, with the polyol and PARP pathways 
being the most relevant to neuronal death.53 In the polyol 
pathway, the influx of glucose into the cell activates aldose 
reductase to convert glucose to sorbitol. Sorbitol is then con-
verted to fructose via sorbitol dehydrogenase. Both of these 
steps generate oxidative species that contribute to neuronal 
injury.53,54 In Schwann cells, endothelial cells, and sensory 
neurons, PARP is stimulated by oxidative species and induces

further oxidative stress in a feedback mechanism.55–59 PARP is 
a nuclear enzyme that can also alter gene expression, leading 
to impairment of neuronal conduction velocity, small-fiber 
neuropathy (Figure 1), hyperalgesia, and allodynia, as well 
as other diabetic complications.53,55,60–64
Alcoholic neuropathy
The prevalence of alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy has 
been estimated to occur in two-thirds of chronic alcohol-
ics.9 Alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy is historically 
regarded as a large-fiber neuropathy from thiamine defi-
ciency (Figure 1).65–69 In contrast to small sensory fibers, 
large fibers are responsible for vibration and proprioception. 
However, advances in scientific techniques have reshaped 
the pathophysiology of alcoholic neuropathy. Observations 
that neuropathy can develop even in the setting of normal 
thiamine levels70 and that the early stages of alcoholic neu-
ropathy are characterized by painful paresthesia71 have led 
scientists to postulate that alcohol and its metabolites have 
direct neurotoxic effects on small C fibers (Figure 1).72,73 
Acetaldehyde is a known neurotoxin that is formed when 
alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase. The pre-
cise mechanism underlying alcoholic neuropathy is yet to be 
fully elucidated. Some proposed explanations include direct 
neurotoxic effects of alcohol or its metabolite acetaldehyde70 
through activation of spinal cord microglia,74 involvement 
of metabotropic glutamate 5 and opioid receptors74,75 in the 
spinal cord, promotion of oxidative stress by the activity of 
alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in the liver,76 and release of 
proinflammatory cytokines coupled with phosphorylation 
of protein kinase C77 and extracellular signal-regulated 
kinases.78 Taken together, these different initiating events may 
ultimately lead to DNA fragmentation and neuronal apopto-
sis.79 Once formed, acetaldehyde is metabolized by ALDH 
into a much less harmful acetate. Interestingly, pharmaco-
logical and genetic data suggest that reducing ALDH activity 
can precipitate peripheral neuropathy, whereas increasing its 
activity may carry therapeutic potential. As such, disulfiram, 
an ALDH inhibitor, has the side effect of causing NeuP
.80
Medication-induced neuropathy
Disulfiram is not unique in causing NeuP; in fact, many and 
more commonly prescribed drugs, which span the spectrum 
of chemotherapy to cardiovascular medications, are known to 
induce neuropathy. This section focuses on taxanes, with men-
tion of statin-induced neuropathy. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are 
antineoplastic taxanes used to treat numerous types of solid 
tumors, including ovarian, breast, lung, and head and neck 
malignancies. Paclitaxel has its chemotherapeutic effect by 
promoting microtubule assembly in a disorganized manner, 
thereby prohibiting mitotic division. It is by this very same 
mechanism that paclitaxel causes peripheral neuropathy, one 
of the most common and limiting side effects of the drug. In 
vivo studies have demonstrated that paclitaxel causes abnor-
mal microtubule accumulation, leading to demyelination,81,82 
and inhibits the regenerative capacities of neurons.83,84 In a 
non-dose-dependent manner, paclitaxel causes hyperalgesia 
and allodynia without affecting motor performance.85 Clini-
cally, patients have complained of sensory neuropathy and 
decreased vibration and proprioception, indicating that both 
small C and Aδ fibers are affected (Figure 1).86–89 One of the 
original articles on paclitaxel-induced neuropathy studied 
paclitaxel infusion at three doses, and found that neuropathy 
developed in >80% of the patients at all doses and was dose-
limiting in 70% of patients at the highest dose.90
It is noteworthy that diabetes is a predisposition to drug-
induced neuropathy. In a retrospective study comparing 
the rates of taxane-induced neuropathy, chronic diabetics 
(defined by >5 years) developed neuropathy more fre-
quently compared to nondiabetics.91 With regard to treating 
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, SNRIs have 
been shown to be superior to placebo.92 These drugs are also 
used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Together, these 
data suggest that taxanes and diabetes act differently but 
synergistically in causing peripheral nerve damage and NeuP
.
Statins are prescribed to >40 million patients in the US 
alone (https://meps.ahrq.gov), and are frequently prescribed 
to diabetics to reduce their cardiovascular risk. It is interest-
ing to note that there have been reports of statin-induced 
peripheral neuropathy.93,94 Though statins are demonstrated 
to have pleiotropic effects, preclinical studies suggest that 
they can attenuate NeuP by potentiating antioxidation.95,96 
Promising data have also been found in human studies 
where rosuvastatin improved both the intensity of diabetic 
neuropathy pain and nerve conduction.97 In combination 
with the rarity of statin-induced neuropathy, these data sug-
gest that this potential side effect of statin should minimally 
influence the physician’s decision to prescribe statins for 
vascular protection.
Current neuropathic pain therapies
Based on a 2015 analysis of a systemic review and meta-
analysis performed by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest 
Group on clinical studies of NeuP pharmacotherapy, a new 
guideline for treatment of NeuP was recently proposed.98 The 
guidelines highlight the difficulty in adequately treating NeuP

Integrated perspective on neuropathic pain
but recommend the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), 
SNRIs, pregabalin, and gabapentin as first-line treatment 
options for NeuP
.98 In the following section, we discuss these 
medications in more detail.
Tricyclic antidepressants
A number of randomized controlled trials have shown that 
TCAs may exert their NeuP-relieving effect via multiple 
mechanisms of action.99,100 The potential of TCAs in pain 
relief is primed by their inhibition of presynaptic reuptake 
of serotonin and norepinephrine101,102 and activity at NMDA 
receptors and sodium channels,103 all of which are involved 
in pain transmission. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are two 
of the oldest TCAs on the market. Although their use to treat 
depression has declined with the increased popularity of 
SNRIs and selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors, they con-
tinue to be used off-label to treat NeuP
. However, according 
to recent Cochrane meta-analyses, no high-quality evidence 
exists to support the analgesic effect of both amitriptyline 
and nortriptyline, despite an extensive history of anecdotal 
success.104,105 A factor for the declining use of TCAs, whether 
for depressive disorders or NeuP
, is that TCAs have a higher 
risk for fatal overdose and require careful dosing. Therefore, 
TCAs should not be advocated for use as first-line treatment 
of NeuP
.
Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors
Venlafaxine and duloxetine are SNRIs that are prescribed to 
treat depression, anxiety, and NeuP
. Serotonin and norepi-
nephrine play integral parts in the descending pain pathway 
to suppress pain.106–108 Preclinical and clinical research has 
shown that drugs that increase serotonergic and noradren-
ergic neurotransmissions exert antinociceptive properties. 
For example, SNRIs significantly attenuated pain-related 
behaviors in the formalin model of persistent pain and the 
L5–L6 spinal nerve ligation model of NeuP in rats.109 SNRIs 
are also efficacious in the treatment of pain and functional 
impairment associated with fibromyalgia, as per a number 
of randomized controlled trials.110–113
Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that for cer-
tain SNRIs, serotonin reuptake inhibition predominates at 
low drug concentration, whereas inhibition of norepinephrine 
reuptake occurs only at much higher doses.114 Unlike treating 
depression, the treatment for NeuP with SNRIs is achieved 
at higher doses and more rapidly. For venlafaxine, the usual 
antidepressant dosage is much lower than what is needed 
for pain relief,115 suggesting that norepinephrine contributes 
more strongly to attenuating pain. The importance of nor-
epinephrine is further exemplified by the effect of clonidine 
and the adrenergic receptor agonist in alleviating pain.116 
However, a Cochrane review found that venlafaxine had 
limited efficacy compared to placebo.32 Despite relatively 
similar pharmacology, duloxetine was effective for the relief 
of NeuP
.117 Duloxetine is a much more potent inhibitor of the 
serotonin- and norepinephrine reuptake transporters than 
venlafaxine.114 Therefore, when choosing an SNRI, we would 
favor the use of duloxetine.
Calcium-channel blockers
Changes in the expression and activity of voltage-gated cal-
cium channels are known to modulate neuronal excitability 
and synaptic plasticity in the dorsal horn, culminating in pain 
processing.118–120 The Cavα2δ1subunit, an important accessory 
subunit for calcium channels, plays an important role in 
NeuP development, based on reports of increased expression 
in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal neurons during NeuP 
states.121–123 Further supporting evidence shows that blockade 
of the Cavα2δ1 subunit could reverse tactile allodynia in nerve-
injured animals.124,125 Interestingly, the Cavα2δ1subunit is the 
binding site for pregabalin and gabapentin.126 Pregabalin and 
gabapentin were developed and US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) approved for treatment of epilepsy, but have 
become first-line treatments for NeuP
.
A Cochrane review using randomized double-blind 
trials found pregabalin to be effective for the treatment of 
NeuP. Pregabalin at doses of >300 mg provided moderate 
pain relief (50% improvement from baseline) in different 
types of pain.127 Another Cochrane review investigated 
the efficacy of gabapentin on NeuP using randomized 
double-blind controlled studies, and concluded that 1,200 
mg daily was needed to achieve 50% pain relief. This 
effect was found in 35% of study participants compared 
to 21% in the placebo group.128 To avoid sedating effects, 
gabapentin is divided into three doses, and patients are 
routinely instructed to titrate the dose, starting at 300 mg 
daily. However, compliance is a major issue in patients 
on gabapentin, usually as they dismiss the medications 
as ineffective and discontinue the medications before 
reaching the therapeutic dose. Therefore, it is prudent to 
educate patients of this therapeutic range. Moreover, a 
recent study has shown that the endogenous lipid palmi-
toylethanolamide has synergistic effects with gabapentin 
to relieve chemotherapy-induced allodynia in mice, which 
makes it possible to reduce the dosage of gabapentin and 
lower its side effects.13

Zeng et al
To illustrate further the vital role of calcium channels in 
pain transmission, ziconotide is a selective calcium-channel 
blocker and potent analgesic. Ziconotide is FDA approved for 
the treatment of refractory chronic pain.129 As ziconotide is a 
large peptide that cannot readily cross the blood–brain bar-
rier, it can thus only be administered intrathecally. Intrathecal 
drug delivery can be used to manage chronic pain effectively, 
and may provide the most targeted approach with the fewest 
side effects.130–133
Opioids and drug development
Although opioids are intended for short-term use for acute 
pain, they have repeatedly been used to treat chronic pain. For 
example, tramadol has been used to treat chronic pain, in part 
due to its dual action as a μ-opioid agonist and SNRI.98 Patients 
frequently cite failures of different adjunctive therapies to alle-
viate their pain, and revert to the use of opioids. In light of the 
rapid increase in patients suffering from opioid-dependence/
use disorders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) has recently published guidelines to avoid routinely 
prescribing narcotics for the management of chronic pain. In 
addition to dependence, opioids also cause other serious side 
effects, including tolerance, ileus, and respiratory depression. 
The latter side effect explains the high hospitalization and 
mortality rate associated with opioid overdose, which has 
increased concomitantly with the rise in opioid dependence. 
Moreover, prolonged use of (escalating doses of) opioids can 
lead to paradoxical pain, also known as opioid-induced hyper-
algesia, and discontinuation of opioids leads to withdrawal of 
hyperalgesia. While the CDC guidelines are helpful for guiding 
narcotic use, it will be challenging to unearth the culture of 
pain management that is heavily rooted in narcotics. The CDC 
currently excludes these guidelines from patients with active 
malignancy, which remains a challenge to treat, despite rapidly 
escalating doses of opioids. Clearly, safer and more potent and 
selective therapeutics are necessary and overdue. Although the 
CDC raised concerns regarding the use of μ-opioids in chronic 
pain, it is important not to dismiss completely their analgesic 
potential for acute pain and palliative care.134 Importantly, 
other opioid-receptor subtypes like μ are also expressed along 
descending pain pathways, and increasing research efforts have 
identified these non-μ-opioid receptors as potential analgesic 
targets for chronic pain.
While current analgesic opioids target μ-opioid recep-
tors, there are three other opioid-receptor subtypes. One of 
the most intriguing new developments in the use of opioids 
for NeuP comes from work focused on δ-opioid receptors 
(DORs), κ-ORs (KORs), and nociception ORs (NORs). 
DORs, KORs, and NORs are expressed in several levels 
of pain pathways, including the periphery, spinal cord, and 
supraspinal regions.135–141 The expression of opioid-peptide 
messenger RNA also increases under conditions of chronic 
pain.142–144 Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that inhi-
bition of DORs or KORs via either opioid antagonists or 
genetic ablation in mice enhances allodynia and hyperal-
gesia following spinal cord injury.145–148 Additionally, both 
DOR and KOR agonists have elicited antinociceptive and 
antiallodynic effects in animal models of NeuP
.142,149–151 An 
intriguing recent study identified 6-methoxyflavanone as a 
positive allosteric modulator of GABAA channels that can 
alleviate streptozotocin-induced diabetic NeuP in female 
rats in a naloxone-reversible manner, potentially via direct 
interaction with DORs and KORs.152 In contrast, the role of 
NORs in nociception is less linear: analgesic actions of the 
nociceptin system in rodents are bidirectional, depending 
upon the doses and assays.153–156 Encouragingly, the activation 
of NORs produces only attenuated and not intensified pain 
in primates regardless of experimental conditions,157,158 and 
thus their therapeutic potential in humans remains.
Summary
NeuP results from nerve damage, and can be classified 
based on the inciting factors, such as hyperglycemia (as in 
diabetes), toxins from alcohol metabolism, and drugs like 
chemotherapy. In basic pain anatomy, noxious stimuli are 
detected in the periphery, and are transmitted via small fibers 
to the central nervous system, where they are converted into 
the experience of pain (Figure 1). This afferent system is 
modulated by an efferent system via GABAergic neurons 
and neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine. 
Opioids that act on GABAergic neurons have been used 
in pain relief for millennia. However, the side effects of 
opioids, especially their addictive properties, have recently 
led the CDC to advise against their use in chronic pain. 
Therefore, an understanding of adjunctive therapies for 
NeuP is essential. Meta-analyses show the most promising 
efficacy in calcium-channel ligands and SNRIs over older 
TCAs, but these medications still leave a number of patients 
untreated. Sodium-channel blockers may represent a broadly 
applicable strategy for many types of NeuP
.159–162 However, 
improved diagnosis of symptoms paired with increased 
understanding and detection of the exact fibers affected by 
disease-specific neuropathies may guide the development 
of more precise therapeutics.163 Targeting receptors or ion 
channels that are uniquely expressed in Aβ, Aδ, or C fibers, 
including DORs and transient receptor-potential (TRPV
, 
TRPA1) channels164–166 may represent a new direction for 
NeuP treatment.
