ABSTRACT
Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only curative treatment of honeybee venom (HBV) allergy, which is
able to protect against further anaphylactic sting reactions. Recent analyses on a molecular level have
demonstrated that HBV represents a complex allergen source that contains more relevant major allergens
than formerly anticipated. Moreover, allergic patients show very diverse sensitization profiles with the
different allergens. HBV-specific immunotherapy is conducted with HBV extracts which are derived from
pure venom. The allergen content of these therapeutic extracts might differ due to natural variations of
the source material or different down-stream processing strategies of the manufacturers. Since variations
of the allergen content of therapeutic HBV extracts might be associated with therapeutic failure, we
adressed the component-resolved allergen composition of different therapeutic grade HBV extracts which
are approved for immunotherapy in numerous countries. The extracts were analyzed for their content of
the major allergens Api m 1, Api m 2, Api m 3, Api m 5 and Api m 10. Using allergen-specific antibodies we
were able to demonstrate the underrepresentation of relevant major allergens such as Api m 3, Api m 5
and Api m 10 in particular therapeutic extracts. Taken together, standardization of therapeutic extracts by
determination of the total allergenic potency might imply the intrinsic pitfall of losing information about
particular major allergens. Moreover, the variable allergen composition of different therapeutic HBV
extracts might have an impact on therapy outcome and the clinical management of HBV-allergic patients
with specific IgE to particular allergens.

Introduction
Stings of Hymenoptera such as honeybees or vespids can cause
severe and even fatal anaphylaxis in allergic individuals. The
only curative treatment which is effective in reducing the risk
of subsequent systemic reactions is venom-specific immuno-
therapy (VIT). VIT is effective in 75% to 98% of patients in pre-
venting sting anaphylaxis.1 However, therapy failures occur
more often in honeybee venom (HBV) compared with yellow
jacket venom (YJV) allergy.2
HBV represents a complex mixture of various substances
such as low-molecular weight components (e.g. histamine, nor-
adrenalin, serotonin and dopamine), peptides (e.g., melittin,
apamin, kinins and mast cell degranulating peptide) and a
plethora of proteins from which several are allergens.3 VIT is
performed with venom extracts which are administered either
as aqueous or aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed extracts (depot
preparations). The latter are used in the conventional build-up
and maintenance phases, while the aqueous extracts are used in
ultra-rush, rush, clustered and maintenance phases.4 Interest-
ingly, in Europe many specialists switch from aqueous extracts
to depot preparations after up-dosing.5,6
All therapeutic HBV extracts are derived from pure venom,
which is usually collected by electrostimulation, a procedure
which leads to a relatively pure venom. Another possibility for
obtaining venom extract is the dissection of whole venom glands
and venom sacs, a method yielding less pure extract since in
addition to the venom components, also proteins from the sur-
rounding tissue are contained in the extract. However, only
scarce information is available about how the venom is further
processed by different manufacturers to produce therapeutic

 grade venom extracts. Although this classification is a little mis-
leading in the literature, aqueous venom extracts are sometimes
classified as “purified” and “non-purified” extracts.4,7,8 This ter-
minology results from the fact that, even though, all manufac-
turers surely undertake purification steps of the pure venom for
injection purposes, some companies claim to offer an ultrapure
venom extract for therapy which does not contain vasoactive
amines and a reduced content of small peptides.4 In the com-
monly used licensed depot preparation, the “purified” extract is
adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. In comparative trials, the
purified aqueous and the purified aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed
extracts appear to be better tolerated than non-purified extracts,
especially in terms of severe large local reactions.7,8
Although the production of therapeutic allergen extracts has
to be highly standardized in terms of the production process
and of the total allergenic potency,9 the lack of information
about a broader range of clinically relevant allergens and of
appropriate molecular tools for their assessment hampers the
generation of highly reliable venom extracts with a more favor-
able overall therapeutic efficacy.
Especially HBV might represent a challenge for the prepara-
tion of therapeutic extracts including all relevant allergens in ade-
quate amounts, since over 60% of its dry-weight is made up by
the allergens Api m 1 (12%) and Api m 4 (50%).10 While Api m
1 (phospholipase A2) represents a well-established major aller-
gen, Api m 4 (melittin) is a minor allergen with restricted clinical
relevance.3 Recently it was demonstrated that HBV contains
many more additional important major allergens, namely Api m
2 (hyaluronidase), Api m 3 (acid phosphatase), Api m 5 (dipep-
tidyl peptidase IV) and Api m 10 (icarapin) which exhibit sIgE
reactivity with 47.9–52.2%, 49.6–50%, 58.3–61.7% and 61.8–
72.2% of allergic patient’s sera, respectively.11,12 Compared to
Api m 1 and Api m 4, all these allergens are present in the
venom in only minimal amounts.13,14 This might implicate that
especially the amount of these allergens in therapeutic extracts,
might be easily affected by natural variations of the source mate-
rial, different work-up strategies of the manufacturers or even by
degradation of particular components.
In a former study we used monoclonal antibodies and dem-
onstrated that, compared with crude HBV, the allergens Api m
3 and Api m 10 are underrepresented or even missing in partic-
ular therapeutic HBV extracts which are commonly used for
VIT.13 Very recently, another study correlated treatment fail-
ures of HBV VIT with a predominant Api m 10 sensitization
and demonstrated the lack or underrepresentation of Api m 10
in different therapeutic HBV extracts.11
Such data might be of major importance for the clinical
management of HBV-allergic patients with specific IgE to par-
ticular allergens. Therefore, in this study we extended former
analyses and generated highly specific and sensitive antibodies
for the detection of the major allergens Api m 2, Api m 3, Api
m 5 and Api m 10 and compared different therapeutic HBV
extracts regarding their allergen content. Thereby, we were able
to demonstrate the underrepresentation of relevant major aller-
gens in particular therapeutic extracts. Moreover, compared
with another study,11 we found dramatically different results
concerning the Api m 3 and Api m 10 content of particular
products, a fact that is of major importance for clinical deci-
sions on the selection of licensed immunotherapeutic products
in Europe. Additionally, our findings on Api m 10 stability
might have an impact on the immunotherapeutic procedure
for venom allergy, both in Europe and in the United States.

 recombinant allergens (Fig. 1A). Moreover, all antibodies
proved to be highly specific for the natural allergens in the
crude HBV and detected single allergen bands of the expected
molecular weight in immunoblots (Fig. 1B). The sensitivity of
the detection was assessesd using dilution series of the crude
venom and all antibodies showed adequate detection of their
target allergens within 4 mg of whole venom (Fig. 1C).
Allergen content of therapeutic HBV extracts
We addressed the major allergen content of 4 different aqueous
therapeutic HBV extracts which are approved for immunother-
apy
in
different
countries
world-wide:
Venomil
(Allergy
Therapeutics, Worthing, UK), Reless (ouside Germany also
known as Pharmalgen; ALK-Abell�
o, Hamburg, Germany),
ALK lyophylisiert SQ (ouside Germany also known as Aquagen
SQ; ALK-Abell�
o) and Venomenhal (HAL Allergy, Leiden,
Netherlands). Furthermore, the allergen content of these thera-
peutic HBV extracts was compared with 2 commercially available
crude HBV extracts (I: Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany: II:
Latoxan, Portes-l�
es-Valence, France).
For the analyses, all lyophilized extracts were reconstituted
with ddH2O and the freshly reconstituted extracts were applied
for immunoblotting. Staining of the major allergen Api m 1
served as loading control to ensure that all extracts were present
on the immunoblot at equal amounts (representative stainings
are shown in Fig. 2). Api m 1 was present in all therapeutic
extracts as well as in the crude venoms in equal and high
amounts. Additionally, Api m 2 was well detectable in all thera-
peutic extracts (Fig. 2A). Api m 3, Api m 5 and Api m 10 were
detectable in comparable amounts in Venomil, Reless (Phar-
malgen) and Venomenhal, although, to a slightly lesser extent
than in the crude HBV (Fig. 2A). However, all 3 allergens were
strongly underrepresented and only barely detectable in ALK
lyophylisiert SQ (Aquagen SQ) (Fig. 2A).
Intriguingly, while these results were reproducible for 5
batches of Venomil, 2 batches of Reless and 2 batches of ALK
lyophylisiert SQ, in another batch of Venomenhal, Api m 3 and
Api m 10 were not detectable. The direct comparison of the 3
batches of this product showed that both allergens were well
detectable in 2 batches but undetectable in a third batch
(Fig. 2B), while the content of the other investigated allergens
was comparable for all batches (data not shown).
In a recent study a comparable Api m 3-specific antiserum
was used and a clear reactivity of all therapeutic HBV extracts,
comparable to that of crude HBV, was postulated. Due to these
divergent results we repeated the analysis using an already pub-
lished monoclonal Api m 3-specific antibody.13 Thereby, we
were able to completely confirm our previous results using the
polyclonal antiserum, namely, a lesser Api m 3 content of all
therapeutic extracts compared with the crude venom and an
underrepresentation of Api m 3 in ALK lyophylisiert SQ
(Aquagen SQ) compared with the other products (Fig. S1).
Stability of Api m 10
To address the variable Api m 10 content of different therapeu-
tic products and the observed discrepant results for particular
products compared with the recently published study by Frick
et al.,11 we evaluated the stability of this relevant allergen. Inter-
estingly, applying recombinantly produced and purified Api m
10 in a comparable concentration as found in the crude venom,
our analyses demonstrated rapid degradation of the allergen
within 3 days, when stored in solution at C4� C (Fig. 3A).
In our analyses we always used freshly reconstituted thera-
peutic venom extracts. However, the observed instability of Api
m 10 could critically influence immunoblot-based analyses in
the laboratory. For laboratory purposes the freeze-dried thera-
peutic venom extracts are routinely solved in ddH2O or buffers
like PBS and not in the supplied albumin-containing saline

 diluent for injection purposes. This implies that some PBS-
reconstituted products such as Reless (Pharmalgen) or Venom-
enhal contain human serum albumin (HSA) since it is already
contained in the freeze-dried venom. In contrast, for Venomil
the HSA is added together with the diluent in clinical practice,
so that ddH2O- or buffer-reconstituted Venomil contains no
HSA. The stabilizing effect of HSA on Api m 10 in crude
venom, stored in solution at C4� C, is shown in Fig. 3B. More-
over, these results indicate that laboratory analyses of therapeu-
tic venom extracts might be influenced by the reagents used for
their reconstitution and by the subsequent storage of the solu-
bilized extracts, as demonstrated by the different results for
ddH2O-reconstituted Venomil and Reless stored at either
-20�C or C4� C (Fig. 3C). However, in clinical practice this fact
does not matter since all analyzed products contain HSA after
reconstitution with the supplied diluent.
Discussion
In this study we established tools that allow a component-
resolved analysis of therapeutic HBV extracts. Four therapeutic
HBV extracts commonly used for VIT were analyzed for their
content of the major allergens Api m 1, Api m 2, Api m 3, Api
m 5 and Api m 10. Intriguingly, numerous differences could be
demonstrated for the particular products. The observed varying
major allergen content of therapeutic HBV extracts might have
a high impact on clinical practice and on the handling of
patients with particular sensitization profiles.
Although obtained by methods, yielding relatively pure
venom, the analyzed therapeutic HBV extracts showed a
diverse content of important major allergens. This degree of
variation, as also demonstrated for other allergen extracts,18-22
indicates that different strategies for down-stream processing
of the pure venom for the production of therapeutic grade
venom extracts, can substantially affect the representation of
major venom allergens, resulting in the potential loss of
particular allergens with high clinical relevance. Moreover, the
geographical origin or seasonal variations might additionally
affect the composition of the source material.23
During the last years, studies demonstrated that in addition to
Api m 1 also Api m 2, Api m 3, Api m 5 and Api m 10 repre-
sent
major
allergens
of
HBV.12,13,15,17,24,25Additionally,
39
different sensitization profiles were identified in 144 patients
with HVB allergy, applying 6 different allergens (Api m 1–5 and
10).12 Interestingly, in HBV allergy these 6 allergens are neces-
sary to reach a diagnostic sensitivity of approximately 95%, a
fact that indicates a more complex allergen composition of HBV
compared with YJV. In YJV allergy the 2 major allergens Ves v
1 and 5 are sufficient to reach the same diagnostic sensitivity.26
Both of the 2 important allergens are present in YJV in substan-
tial and equimolar amounts (Ves v 1 with 6–14% and Ves v 5
with 5–10% of the venom dry weight).14 In contrast, in HBV
Api m 1 is the only major allergen that is present in substantial
amounts and all other relevant allergens make up only 0.6–2%
of the venom dry weight.13,14 Therefore, it could be speculated
that these differences between the 2 venoms might be a reason
for the higher success rate of YJV-specific immunotherapy.
Currently, it is a matter of debate whether particular sen-
sitization profiles are linked to the outcome of VIT with
HBV. Very recently, a study correlated treatment failures of
HBV VIT with a predominant Api m 10 sensitization.11
The same study demonstrated the lack or underrepresenta-
tion of Api m 10 in different therapeutic HBV extracts
commonly used for VIT. As a consequence of the variable
Api m 10 content, it was suggested that patients with pre-
dominant Api m 10 sensitization should be treated with a
HBV extract containing a relevant amount of the allergen.
To our opinion this is a major step forward toward a per-
sonalized medicine approach in VIT and, surely, will influ-
ence the use of VIT products. Likewise, it might be an
option to treat patients without Api m 10 sensitization with
a product that lacks the allergen.

 In this study, the content of 5 relevant major allergens in 4
aqueous HBV extracts which are commonly used for immuno-
therapy was addressed for the first time. Thereby, we were able
to demonstrate comparable allergen contents for Api m 1 and
Api m 2. However, substantial differences were demonstrated
for the other allergens. While Api m 3, Api m 5 and Api m 10
could be reproducibly detected in different batches of Venomil
and Reless (Pharmalgen), all 3 allergens were clearly underrep-
resented in ALK lyophylisiert SQ (Aquagen SQ). An underrep-
resentation of Api m 3 and Api m 10 was observed for one but
not for 2 other batches of Venomenhal. Only one batch of the
product was available on the market at a time and the under-
representation was observed only for the earliest purchased
batch. Therefore, the differences in the Api m 3 and Api m 10
content could either be due to batch to batch variations or to a
modified production process.
Whether the underrepresentation of the 3 major allergens,
which was observed for ALK lyophylisiert SQ (Aquagen SQ),
also holds true for the related depot preparation (ALK-depot
SQ or Alutard SQ), can only be speculated at this time point
since the analysis of aluminum-adsorbed venom extracts by the
here applied methods is very challenging. Recently, the pres-
ence of Api m 10-derived peptides was demonstrated for
Aquagen SQ (and Alutard SQ) by mass spectrometry (MS)
analyses.27 This is in accordance with our immunoblot analyses
which were also able to detect minimal amounts of intact Api
m 10 in ALK lyophylisiert SQ (Aquagen SQ). Nevertheless, our
results demonstrate obvious differences in the amount of full-
length Api m 10 in this particular product compared with other
aqueous extracts. Moreover, while our analyses address the
content of the full-length protein, the applied MS analyses are
not able to discriminate between full-length Api m 10 and Api
m 10-derived degradation products. Additionally, the used MS
analyses were not quantitative. However, so far it is not known
whether the intact allergen and derived degradation products
thereof exhibit the same potency in inducing a tolerogenic
immune response. Definitely, further studies are needed, which
address, if small amounts of Api m 10 or Api m 10-derived
peptides in the therapeutic extracts are sufficient to induce tol-
erance in the majority of patients. Nevertheless, our analyses
suggest that intensive purification and processing steps of the
crude venom might strongly influence the content of full-length
Api m 10 (as well as of Api m 3 and Api m 5), and since under-
representation was most pronounced in ALK-lyophylisiert SQ
(Aquagen SQ), it’s processing that removes low molecular
weight substances and reduces the amount of bioactive pepti-
des, may be relevant here.4,7,8
A recent study demonstrated the lack or underrepresenta-
tion of Api m 10 in Venomil, Venomenhal and Aquagen SQ as
well as its presence in Pharmalgen.11 Although in our analyses
we applied the same methods, intriguingly, we found dramati-
cally different results in part, a fact that is of major importance
for clinical decisions on the selection of licensed immunothera-
peutic products in Europe. Our study was able to confirm the
underrepresentation of Api m 10 in Aquagen SQ (ALK lyophy-
lisiert SQ) and its presence in Pharmalgen (Reless). However,
in strong contrast to that study, we were able to detect compa-
rable amounts of Api m 10 in 5 independent batches of
Venomil. For Venomenhal our analyses demonstrated batch to
batch variations ranging from Api m 10 content comparable to
Venomil and Pharmalgen to undetectable content. These are
facts that might be of importance for the handling of patients
with Api m 10 sensitization.
Regarding the reasons for these different results, it can only
be speculated. The analyses were reproducibly performed with
different independent batches in both studies. The sensitivity of
detection is not able to give a reasonable explanation for the
observed discrepancy, since the evaluated detection limit of our
experimental setup is significantly higher than the postulated
detection limit by Frick et al.: Whereas 4–10 mg of crude venom
was necessary to achieve adequate detection of Api m 10 in our
immunoblots, Frick et al. show effective detection when apply-
ing 0.5–1.5 mg of crude venom. Most likely, the observed dis-
crepancies might be explained by the rapid degradation of the
allergen after solubilizing the lyophilized therapeutic extracts
and storage at C 4� C. Unfortunately, Frick et al. do not state
how venom extracts were handled in the laboratory after solu-
bilization. Nevertheless, these data clearly demonstrate the
need for standardized operation procedures for quality-control
of therapeutic extracts in different laboratories.
In clinical practice in Europe, the observed Api m 10 insta-
bility might be limited by the fact that all of the licensed prod-
ucts contain potentially stabilizing human serum albumin after
reconstitution of the lyophilized extract. However, our results
might implicate that the use of small pharmaceutical phials
that contain therapeutic extracts for one injection might be
superior over larger ones that are stored for several weeks after
reconstitution. However, the obtained results may not only
influence clinical decisions for the selection of immunothera-
peutic products in Europe. Due to the observed instability of
Api m 10, they might also have an impact on the immunother-
apeutic procedure in the United States, where the clinical rou-
tine practice involves the formulation of patient-specific
preparations for immunotherapy based on stock solutions of
venom extract stored at C 4� C, exactly the conditions that lead
to rapid Api m 10 degradation.
In contrast to a former analysis in which we used an Api m
3-specific monoclonal antibody for detection,13 the study by
Frick et al.11 demonstrated the presence of Api m 3 in all
assessed therapeutic products in comparable amounts to that
in crude HBV by applying polyclonal antibodies. Our analyses
shown here, also used polyclonal rabbit antibodies that were
generated against full-length Api m 3 produced in insect cells.
Surprisingly, these analyses showed clearly lesser amounts of
Api m 3 in all therapeutic extracts, compared with crude HBV
as well as an underrepresentation in ALK lyophylisiert SQ
(Aquagen SQ) and in 1 out of 3 batches of Venomenhal com-
pared with the other therapeutic extracts. Although, both stud-
ies used polyclonal rabbit antibodies, these differences might be
explained by slight differences in sensitivity or specificity of
detection. In contrast to the antibodies used in our study, which
detected a single band of Api m 3, the antibodies used by Frick
et al. resulted in multiple bands in some of the analyzed prod-
ucts. Moreover, our results are in full accordance with the data
obtained in a former study13 and with the results obtained
using the monoclonal Api m 3-specific antibody in this study.
Considering the complex sensitization profiles of HBV-
allergic patients,12 it might be speculated that some of the
2486
S. BLANK ET AL.
 therapeutic extracts could be associated with therapeutic failure
in patients with particular sensitization profiles, an issue that
should be addressed in future studies. Potential candidates
might be patients who are polysensitized to several allergens or
who are exclusively sensitized to allergens such as Api m 3 and/
or Api m 10 (4.8% of patients12), which are not or only barely
detectable in particular therapeutic HBV extracts, and against
which, only minimal IgG4 is induced during VIT in contrast to
other allergens that are present in substantial amounts.12 More-
over, the immune response to minimal amounts of allergen in
particular HBV extracts might differ strongly in individual
patients. Notably, HBV in general might represent a particu-
larly challenging allergen source for the preparation of thera-
peutic extracts, containing all major allergens in sufficient
amounts. Studies of other therapeutic vaccines for allergen
immunotherapy demonstrated that maintenance doses of 3 to
20 mg of major allergen are associated with clinical improve-
ment after immunotherapy.28 Taken a maintenance dose of
100 mg, these amounts are only reached for Api m 1 and none
of the other major allergens of HBV, even within crude venom.
Therefore, the mechanism of tolerance induction against low
amounts of major allergens in the majority of HBV-allergic
patients clearly should be a focus of future research. The limita-
tion of our study is represented by the fact that at this time no
connection between therapeutic outcome, allergen content of
products used for therapy and IgE sensitization profiles of
patients can be revealed. Therefore, our results clearly demon-
strate the need for extended prospective clinical studies focus-
ing on this relationship.
Nevertheless, our results might have implications for i) the
clinical management of HBV-allergic patients particular sensi-
tization profiles worldwide, ii) the quality control and regula-
tory process for patient-named and licensed products used for
VIT procedures, and iii) all major stakeholders (doctors,
patients, regulators, reimbursement systems/insurance compa-
nies) in the affected health markets, helping them to make the
right decisions in the emerging era of precision medicine.
Taken together, our data demonstrate obvious differences in
the quality of therapeutic HBV extracts in terms of the content
of important allergens, a fact that might be of major impor-
tance at least for patients with particular sensitization profiles.
Moreover, standardization of therapeutic venom extracts by
determination of the total allergenic potency might imply the
intrinsic pitfall of losing information about particular major
allergens. Allergen-specific antibodies represent valuable tools
that allow component-resolved analyses of therapeutic extracts
on a molecular level that cope with the advanced knowledge of
the composition of relevant allergens.
Materials and methods
Allergen-specific antibodies and recombinant allergens
The recombinant CCD-free allergens were produced in Spodop-
tera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells and purified as described
previously.12,13,15-17 Polyclonal antibodies were generated by
immunization of rabbits (Davids Biotechnology, Regensburg,
Germany) with either recombinant Api m 2, Api m 3 or Api m
10 according to established protocols. The monoclonal Api m
3- and Api m 5-specific IgE antibodies were generated as
described previously.13,17,29
Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, lyophilized HBV extracts were dissolved
in ddH2O to a stock concentration of 1.3 mg/mL. Immediately
after dissolving 23 mg/lane (or less for sensitivity testing of the
antibodies) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing con-
ditions
and
immobilized
onto
nitrocellulose
membranes
(Thermo Scientific, 88018). Blot membranes were blocked with
40 mg/mL nonfat dry milk powder (AppliChem, A0830) in
PBS (Life Technologies, 70011051). Polyclonal allergen-specific
rabbit antisera were diluted 1:1000 with 20 mg/mL nonfat dry
milk powder in PBS. Recombinant monoclonal IgE antibodies
were used in form of cell culture supernatants (DMEM (Gibco,
31966–021) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Bio-
chrom, SO115)) of antibody-producing HEK293 cells. All anti-
bodies were applied to the corresponding Western blots and
incubated over night at 4� C. After washing for 3 times with
PBS, bound allergen-specific antibodies were detected for
1 hour at room temperature via polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Sigma-Aldrich, SAB3700854) or monoclonal mouse anti-
human IgE (BD Biosciences, 555859) antibody, conjugated to
alkaline phosphatase, diluted 1:5000 or 1:1000 with 20 mg/mL
nonfat dry milk powder in PBS, respectively. After washing for
3 times with PBS bound antibodies were visualized using nitro-
tetrazolium
blue
chloride
(AppliChem,
A1243)/5-bromo-
4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (AppliChem, A1117) according
to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Ponceau S
(Sigma-Aldrich, P7170) staining of immobilized Api m 1
served as loading control.

over night at 4� C and blocked with 10 mg/mL BSA (Appli-
Chem, A1391) in PBS (Life Technologies, 70011051). Allergen-
specific polyclonal rabbit antisera were diluted 1:5000 and
monoclonal recombinant antibody cell culture supernatants 1:2
with 5 mg/mL BSA in PBS, applied to the corresponding wells
and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. After washing
5 times with 0.05% Tween20 (EMD Chemicals, 655204) in
PBS, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rab-
bit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, SAB3700854) diluted 1:5000 or mono-
clonal mouse anti-human IgE (BD Biosciences, 555859) diluted
1:1000 in 5 mg/mL BSA were added for 1 hour at room temper-
ature. After washing 5 times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS,
detection was performed with 5 mg/mL 4-nitrophenylphosphat
disodium salt hexahydrate (AppliChem, A1442) in AP-detec-
tion buffer (100 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2
�6 H2O, 100 mM
NaCl, pH 9,5) and signals were read at 405 nm.
