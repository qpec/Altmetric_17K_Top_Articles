Fatal and nonfatal injuries resulting from gun violence remain a persistent problem in the United States. The avail-
able research suggests that gun violence diffuses among people and across places through social relationships.
Understanding the relationship between gun violence within social networks and individual gun violence risk is crit-
ical in preventing the spread of gun violence within populations. This systematic review examines the existing sci-
entific evidence on the transmission of gun and other weapon-related violence in household, intimate partner, peer,
and co-offending networks. Our review identified 16 studies published between 1996 and 2015 that suggest that
exposure to a victim or perpetrator of violence in one’s interpersonal relationships and social networks increases the
risk of individual victimization and perpetration. Formal network analyses find high concentrations of gun violence in
small networks and that exposure to gun violence in one’s networks is highly correlated with one’s own probability of
being a gunshot victim. Physical violence by parents and weapon use by intimate partners also increase risk for
victimization and perpetration. Additional work is needed to better characterize the mechanisms through which net-
work exposures increase individual risk for violence and to evaluate interventions aimed at disrupting the spread of
gun and other weapon violence in high-risk social networks.

INTRODUCTION
Despite reductions in gun-related homicide rates over the
last 2 decades, gun violence remains a major contributor to
morbidity and mortality in the United States. In 2013, for
example, over 11,000 individuals died in a firearm-related
homicide, with an additional 62,000 experiencing nonfatal
firearm-related injuries in violent assaults (1). Public health
researchers, criminologists, and other scholars have exam-
ined the various causes, correlates, and consequences of gun
violence, as well as how such information might be used to
guide intervention and prevention efforts (2–4). One reoccur-
ring theme in this research is the epidemiologic idea that gun
violence can be transmitted from one person, community,
group,orpopulationtoanother(5,6).Thatis,gunviolencecan
and does diffuse in a population through exposure, leading to
someoftheobservedepidemic-likepatterns.Thetransmission
of gun violence is suggested to occur through interpersonal
relationships or networks—the social, behavioral, friendship,
kinship, and other types of ties that link individuals and
groups (7, 8).
This systematic review aims to summarize the available
empirical evidence on the transmission of gun violence with-
in social networks. In particular, we review studies that exam-
ine how exposure to a victim or perpetrator of violence in
one’s social network influences one’s own individual risk of
victimization or perpetration. Because the adaptation of for-
mal network models within public health and epidemiology
is still a relatively new endeavor (7, 9, 10), we define “social
networks” both broadly with respect to familial, domestic,
and interpersonal relationships and specifically in terms of
formally measured social and behavioral ties among individ-
uals. Gun carrying emerged as a closely related concept dis-
cussed in many eligible studies; as such, we include a brief
narrative review of relevant gun-carrying studies to further
explore links between network exposures and risk of violence.
Our findings are followed by a discussion of the transmis-
sion mechanisms suggested by the reviewed studies, the

 limitations of existing studies of the estimated effects of ex-
posure to violence within networks, and the policy implica-
tions of available research for gun violence prevention and
intervention efforts.
METHODS
We reviewed the literature for all studies that presented em-
pirical data on the relation between exposure to victims or
perpetrators of violence in one’s social network (defined as
family, intimate partners, friends or peers, and co-offenders)
and experiences of individual victimization or perpetration.
To be eligible for the review, studies had to include an “ex-
posure” measure of violent victimization or perpetration by a
defined social network member (i.e., a parent, intimate part-
ner, friend, or associate) and an “outcome” measure of indi-
vidual victimization or perpetration. We originally intended
to restrict our review to studies of the transmission of gun vi-
olence; however, we discovered that there were only 3 studies
in which both the exposure and outcome were specific to gun
violence. Therefore, we expanded our review to include stud-
ies in which either the exposure or outcome measure or both
were specific to gun or other weapon-related violence, in-
cluding threats of or actual use of a weapon like a gun or
knife. This more inclusive search allowed us to identify pa-
pers that, although not specific solely to the transmission of
gun violence, nevertheless provide insight into the generation
and consequences of serious weapon-related violence within
social networks, including networks not defined by criminal
involvement.
Citations from the following databases were identified:
PubMed, Web of Knowledge (including the Science Citation
Index, Social Science Citation Index, and Medline), Social
Sciences Full Text, Sociological Abstracts, Criminal Justice
Abstracts, National Criminal Justice Reference Service Ab-
stracts, and Proquest Criminal Justice. We used the search
terms “gun,” “firearm,” and “weapon” in combination with
terms related to violence and violent behaviors (“violence,”
“victimization,” “perpetration,” “injury,” “homicide”) and
network classifications and transmission processes (“net-
work,” “peer,” “friend,” “gang,” “family,” “household,”
“parent,” “maternal,” “paternal,” “sibling,” “spouse,” “part-
ner,” “domestic,” “intergenerational,” “transmission,” “con-
tagion”). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified
studies to obtain additional articles for inclusion and consid-
ered relevant articles in press at the time of the search that
were known to the authors. Time restrictions were not placed
on the search; however, we did restrict to English-language
papers. In total, 16 articles met our inclusion criteria and
were included in this review (Figure 1). Common reasons pa-
pers were excluded from the systematic review included
providing only descriptive information about the prevalence
of violence exposure in a particular population, presenting
information only about gun carrying or gun ownership, and
including only composite measures of violence or de-
linquency rather than assessing gun or weapon violence in
particular. We also note that we excluded papers that only
assessed exposure to community or school violence (e.g., per-
sonally witnessing or hearing about someone in one’s neigh-
borhood being shot), as well as those that included measures of
personal victimization exposure without specifying a par-
ticular perpetrator, as our goal was to focus on the particular
links between individuals through which violence may be
transmitted.
RESULTS
The 16 studies included in this review are summarized in
Table 1. All 16 studies were published in peer-reviewed jour-
nals between 1996 and 2015 and were conducted in the United
States, except for 1 study conducted in Canada (11) and 1 con-
ducted in Scotland (12). Two studies included only men, and
3 studies included only women. One study assessed violence
among children, and 4 studies were limited to adolescents,
whiletherestwereconductedamongadults,including1utilizing
a community-based sample, 7 studies restricted to individuals
with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV), and 6 studies
relying on police records regarding arrests or gang member-
ship. Six studies presented estimates of the risk of violence
transmission between family members, 6 between intimate
partners, 1 among peers, and 3 within co-offending net-
works. Within these network classifications, 4 types of vio-
lence relations were possible: 1) victimization of a network
member influencing individual victimization; 2) victimiza-
tion of a network member influencing individual perpetra-
tion; 3) perpetration by a network member influencing
individual victimization; and 4) perpetration by a network
member influencing individual perpetration.

 Violence transmission among family and household
members
Our systematic review identified several types of violence
transmission between family and household members, in-
cluding the intergenerational transmission of violence from
parents to children (12–16) and the influence of gun victim-
ization of family members on weapon use among adolescents
(17). Together, these studies demonstrate a heightened risk
for gun or other weapon victimization and perpetration at dif-
ferent stages of the life course among individuals who were
exposed to violent perpetration or gun victimization among
family members in childhood.
Violent perpetration by a family member as a risk factor for
individual victimization.
Two included studies found evidence
of an association between exposure to violence perpetrated by
parents and risk of weapon victimization by someone else.
In the study of weapon victimization among participants in
the third wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health (Add Health) by Murphy (13), retrospective self-
reports of physical abuse perpetrated by parents against the
participants themselves in childhood were associated with
being threatened or injured with a gun or knife in the past
year as a young adult (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.51).
The authors also found associations between parent per-
petration of physical abuse in childhood and risk of inti-
mate partner victimization in young adulthood, though not
weapon victimization specifically. Tucker et al. (14) exam-
ined a similar question among a national sample of younger
children (aged 2–9 years) whose parent or caregiver re-
ported on the child’s experience of witnessing physical vi-
olence perpetrated by a parent against another household
member, as well as the child’s victimization by a juvenile
sibling, classified into none, common (including mild phys-
ical aggression, stolen or ruined property, and psychological
aggression), and severe (including weapon use). Witnessing
parent perpetration of violence was associated with severe
victimization by a sibling in adjusted multinomial logistic
regression models (aOR = 3.22, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.53, 6.75).
Violent perpetration by a family member as a risk factor for
individual perpetration.
Several included studies provided
support for an association between exposure to violence per-
petrated by parents during childhood and one’s own violent
behaviors. In Murrell et al. (15), 6.6% of a sample of men with
a history of domestic violence reported having witnessed
threatened or actual weapon use by either parent during their
childhood, and more than half (57%) had threatened to or ac-
tually used a weapon against an intimate partner themselves,
with reports verified from court records. The prevalence of
weapon violence in this sample was very high given their his-
tory of IPV, yet the study indicated that weapon violence
against intimate partners was more common among those
with parental weapon violence exposure than those without
(83% vs. 55%), although this finding may be confounded
by other correlates of violence and also did not consider dif-
ferent levels of violence frequency.
Khan and Cooke (12) interviewed a young sample of juve-
nile offenders (aged 10–19 years) about their exposure
to physical violence between their parents and their own
perpetration of weapon violence against their siblings. Nearly
one third of the sample (30.6%) reported having threatened a
sibling with a knife at least once, whereas 9.9% reported hav-
ing fired a gun at a sibling. In an unadjusted model, there was
a significant association between interparental violence and
weapon perpetration in this sample (β = 0.24), indicating that,
on average, juvenile offenders who witnessed parental violence
reported 0.24 more incidents of weapon perpetration against
siblings than those without exposure to parental violence.
Casiano et al. (16) used data from the National Comorbid-
ity Survey-Replication, a nationally representative sample of
the United States, to show that about 13% of adults in the
sample reported witnessing serious physical fights at home
during childhood, whereas 3.5% reported threatening some-
one with a gun in adulthood, and 6.3% reported threatening
someone with a weapon other than a gun. In adjusted logistic
regression models, exposure to physical fights at home during
childhood was associated with increased odds of weapon per-
petration in adulthood, though the association was stronger
for gun threats (aOR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.8, 3.8) than for threats
with another weapon (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.8).
These studies represent a very small subset of the large
body of literature that has examined the intergenerational
transmission of violence, often termed the “cycle of vio-
lence,” from a variety of disciplinary perspectives over the
past 40 years (18, 19). Much of this work is not specific to
gun or other weapon violence and therefore was excluded
from our review; however, other reviews of this literature
are available (18, 20, 21). Although work in this area has
been beset by a number of methodological shortcomings
(18, 20), these studies have generally found evidence of an
association between childhood abuse or exposure to interpar-
ental violence during childhood and increased risk of violent
or delinquent behaviors in adulthood, including abuse of
one’s own children and intimate partners (18, 20, 21). This
work has been strengthened by a series of prospective inves-
tigations among children, including those with documented
histories of abuse or neglect and comparable control groups,
followed into adulthood, providing clearer evidence of the in-
creased propensity of individuals maltreated in childhood to
engage in violent and criminal behaviors (22–24) and to ex-
perience other negative consequences later in life, including
IPV victimization (25, 26).
Violent victimization of a family member as a risk factor for
individual perpetration.
One additional study among adoles-
cents from junior high schools in New York City (17) found
that 41.5% of adolescents in the sample reported that a close
friend or family member had been shot, and 19.4% reported
having ever used a weapon on someone themselves. Gun vic-
timization of a family member or close friend was associated
with increased odds of weapon perpetration (odds ratio = 2.8,
95% CI: 2.1, 3.6). However, because this was a cross-
sectional study, the temporal association between gun victim-
ization of one’s family member and weapon use could not be
established. Therefore, this finding cannot distinguish be-
tween multiple possible explanations, including increased
weapon carrying and use because of fear of victimization
(27) or higher levels of gun-related behaviors among adoles-
cents with other risks for violence exposure and delinquent
behaviors in their families and broader social networks (28).

 Violence transmission among intimate partners
We identified 6 studies that assessed the association between
previous perpetration of gun or other weapon threats or use by
an intimate partner and increased risk for reassault, homicide
victimization, or homicide perpetration (11, 29–33). These stud-
ies used interviews and police records to identify occurrences of
IPV, generally demonstrating that weapon use in the relation-
ship serves as a powerful predictor of subsequent violence.
Violent perpetration by an intimate partner as a risk factor
for individual perpetration.
One study examined the role of
prior gun violence in the relationship as a predictor of female-
perpetrated homicide. Roberts (29) interviewed a sample of
women incarcerated for killing their male partners and a control
sample of abused women drawn from police department and
women’sshelterrecordsandfoundthatagreaterproportionofin-
carcerated women reported that their abuser had used a gun
against them (39.7% vs. 18.8% of the controls). The restriction
of the homicide offenders to those incarcerated (thus excluding
those who were acquitted or on probation) limits the inferences
that can be drawn from this study, although otheranecdotal stud-
ieshavesimilarlysuggestedthatweaponuseinarelationshipmay
spurhomicideperpetrationbyvictimsinself-defense(29,34,35).
Violent perpetration by an intimate partner as a risk factor
for individual victimization.
Alargerbodyofempiricalstudies
has examined weapon perpetration by an intimate partner as
a predictor of subsequent victimization. Campbell et al. (30)
collected information from proxy respondents for a sample of
femicide cases and from a sample of abused control women re-
garding their male abusers’ previous threats with a weapon and
gun use. Threats with a weapon were more common among the
femicide cases than the controls (55.3% vs. 4.7%), as was gun
use (38.2% vs. 0.9%), and both were found to be significantly
associated with femicide versus control status in adjusted logis-
tic regression models. In another study relying on interview
data,Glassetal.(31)foundthatwomenwhosepartnerorformer
partnerhadusedagunagainstthemwere1.93timesmorelikely
than abused women whose partner had not used a gun to expe-
rience reassault during a 1-month follow-up period, although
this estimated association was not statistically significant
(95% CI: 0.79, 4.75) given the relatively small size of the sam-
ple, which consisted of 84 women with a history of physical or
sexual violence in the past year by a same-sex partner.
Three additional studies assessed the risk of reassault
among individuals who had previously been victimized by
their intimate partners, using police and court records to char-
acterize initial and subsequent abuse incidents. Kingsnorth
(32) followed heterosexual couples for 18 months after an
IPV arrest and found that weapon use during the index
event that prompted the arrest was associated with increased
odds of physical violence recidivism during the follow-up
period, even after considering sociodemographics and other
characteristics of the index event (aOR = 2.14) (P < 0.05).
Similarly, Bonomi et al. (33) followed couples for 2 years
after a police-reported IPV incident perpetrated by a male
against a female and found that weapon use during the
index event was associated with 72% more physical violence
victimization occurrences reported to the police during the
follow-up period (95% CI: 1.29, 2.30). In contrast with
these findings, Folkes et al. (11), using data collected from
criminal records of male offenders, found that offenders’
weapon threats or use during the index IPV incident, though
associated with greater severity of that incident, were not as-
sociated with subsequent IPV recidivism. The use of police
records restricts these studies to instances of serious violence
that came to the attention of law enforcement, with the pos-
sibility that complete information about weapon use or sub-
sequent victimization was not captured in police reports.
Despite these limitations, these studies are consistent with
others reporting a progressive escalation of violence in inti-
mate partner relationships, eventually culminating in threats
with or use of a weapon and sometimes death (30, 36). Recent
research also emphasizes the reciprocal nature of IPV, where-
in the majority or near majority of couples report perpetration
by both partners (37–40). Whether this mutual perpetration,
including weapon use, reflects a defensive response to prior
or concurrent victimization is sometimes hard to discern (41),
but such reciprocal patterns of violence and retaliation often
result in more severe injury than in relationships where non-
reciprocal partner violence is the norm (40). These patterns may
develop early, influenced by exposure to partner violence be-
tween parents in childhood (26, 37) and continuing through
teen dating relationships, in which physical violence may be
aggravated by weapon carrying and use (42).
Violence transmission among peers
Although a large body of research has examined the influ-
ence of delinquent peers on violent behaviors (43–45), much
of this work uses general measures of delinquency and vio-
lence that encompass a wide range of behaviors, from drug
use to physical fighting to weapon use. We identified only
1 study that looked specifically at the influence of peer phys-
ical violence perpetration on an adolescent’s individual risk
of weapon perpetration.
With regard to violent perpetration by a peer as a risk factor
for individual perpetration, Haynie et al. (46) used data from
the Add Health study to evaluate the associations between
neighborhood characteristics and adolescent violence and
whether exposure to violent and/or prosocial peers mediates
these associations. During an initial in-school survey, Add
Health participants nominated up to 10 friends (5 of each
sex) from school rosters; these friends’ self-reports of physi-
cal fighting were used to create a measure of exposure to vi-
olence in one’s peer network. Participants later reported
serious violent behaviors in the past 12 months (including
threats or actual use of a knife or gun) during the wave II in-
home interview. The authors found that a 1-standard devia-
tion increase in peer fighting was associated with higher lev-
els of weapon perpetration among adolescents (β = 0.178,
standard deviation, 0.034) in adjusted hierarchical linear
models. The use of peer-reported information on violence
was a strength of this study, which concluded that residence
in disadvantaged neighborhoods fostered association with vio-
lent peers, which in turn influenced riskof weapon perpetration.
Violence transmission within co-offending networks
Our systematic review identified 3 studies that specifically
examined the influence of co-offending networks on violent
gun victimization. These studies applied formal social network

 analysis techniques to analyze the structure of co-offending
networks and then correlate how observed network positions
influenced individual risk of gun victimization, demonstrating
that gun violence is highly concentrated in specific compo-
nents of co-offending networks and that the social closeness
of individuals in the network to gunshot victims significantly
influences their own risk of violent gun victimization. These 3
studies were the only included studies that looked specifically
at the transmission of gun violence within social networks.
In the first study, Papachristos et al. (8) used social network
analysis to study all fatal and nonfatal gunshot injuries in a
co-offending network of 763 individuals within Boston’s
Cape Verdean community. The co-offending network was
constructed by first identifying the population of Cape Verdean
gang members known to the Boston Police Department;
these gang members were linked to their immediate asso-
ciates and then their associates’ associates through Field In-
terrogation Observation reports, representing noncustodial
police contacts with and observations of individuals. The
analysis revealed that roughly 85% of all gunshot victims
were in a single network representing less than 5% of the
Cape Verdean community’s population. In adjusted logistic
regression models, a greater percentage of immediate associ-
ates who were gunshot victims was associated with increased
odds of individual gun victimization (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI:
1.11, 5.36). Further, each network association removed from
another gunshot victim reduced the odds of gunshot victim-
ization by 9% (aOR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99).
In the second study, Papachristos and Wildeman (47) esti-
mated the association of an individual’s exposure to gun
homicide in a co-offending network and the risk of individual
gun homicide victimization across a high-crime African-
American community of some 82,000 residents in a 6-square
mile (15.54 km2) area of Chicago, using the same exposure
measure as Papachristos et al. (8). Co-offending networks
were established by using Chicago Police Department data
to determine instances where 2 or more people were arrested
together for the same crime. The analysis showed that gun
homicide victimization was highly concentrated within a
single component containing less than 4% of the neighbor-
hood’s population but accounting for 41% of all gun homi-
cides that occurred during the study time period. Logistic
regression models showed that each social tie removed
from a gun homicide victim decreased one’s odds of being
a gun homicide victim by about 58% (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI:
0.27, 0.65). Papachristos and Wildeman (47) concluded that
network exposure to gun homicide was strongly associated
with fatal gun victimization: The closer one is to a gun homi-
cide victim, the greater the risk of fatal gun victimization.
The previous 2 studies relied on small samples and/or data
for a single community. However, Papachristos et al. (48)
used Chicago Police Department arrest data to analyze the en-
tire co-offending population of Chicago in an effort to pro-
vide more accurate estimates of the true distribution of gun
violence victimization risk in a large city. The resulting
co-offending network comprised 169,725 unique individu-
als, representing approximately 6% of the total population
of Chicago and 40% of all individuals arrested during this pe-
riod. Nearly 70% of all nonfatal gun injuries were concentrated
in this network of high-risk individuals during the study
period. This study used an exposure term that measured the
percentage of an individual’s associates who were victims of
gunshot wounds at various network distances (i.e., immedi-
ate associates, associates’ associates, and so on). Results from
logistic regression models revealed that, as an individual’s
exposure to gunshot victims increased, his/her own odds of
victimization also increased. Papachristos et al. (48) esti-
mated that every 1% increase in exposure to gunshot victims
in one’s immediate network increased the odds of victimiza-
tion by roughly 1.1%, holding all else constant. By extension,
if 10% or 50% of one’s associates were victims, the odds of
being shot increased by 12.1% or 76.9%, respectively, com-
pared with someone with no associates who were victims.
Gang membership featured prominently in all 3 co-offend-
ing network studies. Briefly, these studies suggest that gang
members may very well “pass on” violence within their net-
works via processesconsistent with qualitative research on the
norms of retaliation and respect among males in high-crime
communities (5, 49, 50), with gangs and other delinquent
groups exerting strong influence on violent offending and
victimization, including gun carrying and use (51, 52). As
a case in point, a recent study of gang networks in Chicago,
Illinois, and Boston, Massachusetts, found that gang homi-
cides are driven by norms of retaliation, organizational mem-
ory, status-seeking behaviors, and other network processes
(53). Furthermore, the increased risk of violence among gang
members may spread to non-gang members with whom they
associate, as evidenced in a study using social network analy-
sis techniques similar to those described above to document a
co-offending network in Newark, New Jersey (54), in which
social closeness to a gang member, defined through number
of ties in the co-offending network, was strongly associated
with a higher risk of gun victimization, reiterating the impor-
tance of network connections for risk of gun violence.
Gun carrying
Although it was not the main focus of our review, the impor-
tance of gun carrying continually emerged as a critical corre-
late of the transmission of gun violence, especially within the
contexts of peer networks and urban street gangs. A large body
of literature has assessed the correlates of gun-carrying behav-
iors, primarily among adolescents, including demographic, be-
havioral, and network influences, and has noted the important
link between gun carrying and involvement in other types of
gun violence, as well as the increased lethality of altercations
between individuals when guns are involved (55, 56).
Although several studies have found that adolescents re-
port fear of victimization and need for protection as their pri-
mary reason for carrying a gun or other weapon (27, 57),
evidence for the role of previous and witnessed victimization
in weapon carrying has been inconsistent (55, 58, 59). Some
studies have found an association between the gun victimiza-
tion of a close friend or family member with an adolescent’s
own gun carrying (17, 60, 61), whereas others have failed to
find fear of victimization to be a convincing explanation of
gun-carrying behaviors, especially when other network influ-
ences and aggressive tendencies are considered (58, 59, 62).
The gun-carrying behaviors of household members and
peers, however, have been consistently found to correlate
80

 strongly with individual gun-carrying behaviors (28, 55–58).
This may represent a contagion effect, in which the percep-
tion of high levels of gun carrying among peers and class-
mates may lead adolescents to conclude that they also need
to carry guns for protection, in turn leading to higher levels
of gun carrying (58, 61, 63). Studies using formal network
approaches have also found weapon carrying by relatives,
peers, and associates to influence one’s own gun carrying
(27, 64), in contrast to possible selection processes, whereby
individuals who have already adopted gun-carrying behaviors
cluster together (64). Pro-weapon socialization by relatives and
peers may thus be an important means of transmitting gun
violence within networks. In addition, exposure to domestic
violence perpetration during childhood may increase the risk
of gun carrying (65, 66), which is in turn associated with
IPV in dating relationships (42, 67, 68) and thus a potentially
critical link between family violence exposure in childhood
and perpetration of IPV later in life.
Gang involvement has also been closely linked with gun-
carrying behaviors (58, 69). For instance, in their surveys of
juvenile inmates and high school students, Sheley and Wright
(70) found that 65% of inmate gang members and 30% of
high school gang members owned a handgun compared
with only 47% of nongang inmates and 11% of nongang stu-
dents. In their 3-year field study of 99 active gang members,
Decker and VanWinkle (71) found that 81% of their subjects
owned guns and that two thirds had used the guns in gang
conflicts, drive-by shootings, attacks against strangers, and
other violent incidents. Consistent with these studies, a lon-
gitudinal analysis of 1,100 youth from around the United
States found that, controlling for peer weapon carrying, sub-
jects reporting gang membership were 220% more likely to
carry hidden weapons than were nongang members (69).
Bjerregaard and Lizotte (51) found that Rochester, New
York, gangs were more likely to recruit youth who already
owned firearms. Further, compared with nongang members,
gang members were much more likely to own a gun for pro-
tection, have peers who own a gun for protection, carry their
guns outside the home, and be involved in gun-related crimes.
Lizotte et al. (52) used panel data from an ongoing study of
urban youth to demonstrate that gang membership was strongly
associated with gun carrying during adolescence but, at older
ages, drug dealing and illegal peer gun ownership replace
gang membership as the primary determinants of illegal
gun carrying.
Studies among gang members also confirm the powerful
role of fear and the need for self-protection driving gun acqui-
sition and carrying. Gang members acquire firearms because
they believe their rivals have them, and they do not want to be
caught at a disadvantage in local environments perceived to
be highly dangerous (71–73). Among gang members and
other youth involved in criminally active street networks,
guns are also viewed as salient symbols of power and status
and as a strategic means of gaining status, domination, or ma-
terial goods (5). Gang members use guns to acquire and de-
fend their status among their associates and rivals in their
co-offending networks. Drawing from contagion perspec-
tives on the proliferation of violence, Loftin (74) and Decker
(75) suggest that, as guns are introduced into gang networks,
more gang members arm themselves, guns are used to settle
disputes and grievances, and more retaliatory gun violence
results, thus escalating the deadliness and frequency of gang
violence in many urban environments.
DISCUSSION
The results of our systematic review demonstrate that one’s
risk of violence, including victimization and perpetration
of gun or other weapon violence, is increased through close
connection with someone who has either perpetrated or been
a victim of violence, with transmission demonstrated across
family ties, intimate partner relationships, peer networks, and
co-offending networks. Although not restricted to studies
specifically using measures of gun violence as exposures
and outcomes, this review shows that serious weapon-related
violence can potentially arise from exposure to domestic
violence in childhood, not just from delinquent and criminal
activity among peers. Furthermore, the introduction of weap-
on violence into an intimate partner relationship signifies an
increased risk of severe subsequent violence in that relation-
ship. Taken together, the studies included in this review con-
firm the notion that gun violence has important origins in and
consequences for networks of individuals, and future research
must consider how connections between individuals promote
or reduce the spread of gun violence in the population.
Given the observed patterns of intergenerational transmis-
sion of violence and reciprocal violence, our review suggests
that gun and other weapon violence within intimate partner
relationships is particularly hazardous, both for children who
witness such perpetration in their households and for the vic-
tims and perpetrators of such violence. Studies utilizing for-
mal network analysis indicate that increased risks of gun
violence quickly decrease with increased distance from other
victims, but such findings are derived mainly from the exam-
ination of co-offending networks. Further, findings from co-
offending studies highlight the concentration of gun violence
within particular high-risk subgroups and the need to dis-
rupt processes of violence transmission within these groups.
Studies of gun carrying in households, peer networks, and
gangs confirm the central role of gun carrying as an impor-
tant link in the transmission of gun violence within social
networks.
Violence transmission mechanisms
The included studies provide insight into several potential
mechanisms through which association with a victim or per-
petrator of violence in one’s social network influences one’s
own experiences of violence, including gun or other weapon
violence. First, having a perpetrator of violence in one’s net-
work places individuals at direct risk of victimization by that
perpetrator, as in the studies demonstrating that weapon per-
petration by an intimate partner was one of the strongest pre-
dictors of subsequent victimization, including homicide, by
that same partner (11, 30–33). Although not explicitly inves-
tigated in any of the studies included in our review, parent
perpetration of violence against another adult household
member is also highly correlated with child abuse (76), as
an abusive adult often has multiple targets of violence in
the home. These direct relations between a perpetrator and

 victim represent the most obvious pathway through which
network interactions influence victimization risk.
Second, in addition to direct victimization, close associa-
tions with a violent perpetrator increase vulnerability to vic-
timization in other contexts, as in 2 of the included studies of
victimization among children of violent parents (13, 14). This
is a repeated finding in the violence literature, suggesting that
individuals who are exposed to violence during childhood are
likely to experience revictimization throughout their lives,
potentially through acceptance of violence as the norm and
the related development of “scripts” in which individuals as-
sume the expected victim role (13) or through negative cop-
ing behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, that may leave
individuals prone to victimization (77–79).
Third, exposure to violent perpetration by a social network
member has a strong influence on one’s own propensity for
violent perpetration. In the case of intergenerational transmis-
sion of violence, social or observational learning theory sug-
gests that violent behaviors perpetrated by or between parents
serve as a model for children’s behavior and establish vio-
lence as a normative experience within families and relation-
ships (80, 81). The included study by Murrell et al. (15) set
out to test the role of specific learning or specialized transmis-
sion, in which individuals engage in the same behaviors they
witnessed as children, by specifically assessing threatened
or actual use of a gun or knife by the study respondents them-
selves and their parents. Although they did find evidence of
an association between parents’ weapon violence and the
men’s own weapon violence against an intimate partner, the
association was small and the sample was limited to men who
already had a history of domestic violence, limiting the infer-
ences that can be drawn from this study; however, other stud-
ies have also found evidence of specific learning of violent
behaviors (82). Social learning may also have played a role
in the other included studies of weapon perpetration by indi-
viduals exposed to interparental violence (12, 16), as well as
violence among peers (46). Besides social learning, studies of
violence transmission within families have suggested that
poor parental supervision and attachment, harsh parental dis-
cipline, accumulated traumatic experiences in childhood,
poor psychosocial functioning and emotion dysregulation,
early initiation of substance use, and early aggressive behav-
iors may serve as important links between family violence in
childhood and later violent behaviors (24, 83–86).
Fourth, the violent victimization of a close social network
member may predispose individuals to violent perpetration
in retaliation or self-defense, as suggested by the literature
on gang violence and on gun carrying referenced above. The
study by Vaughanet al. (17) may be an example of this type of
violence transmission, though more information would be
needed about the timing of different violent behaviors to dis-
tinguish between alternate explanations. The study by Rob-
erts (29) also reflects violence in self-defense, although
other motivations for homicide perpetration by the women
studied may also have been at play. Additionally, the spread
of violence within co-offending networks in the included
studies may reflect retaliatory processes (8, 47, 48), with
the distinction between victims and perpetrators blurred as in-
dividuals get caught up in violence to avenge an injured or
killed associate or act in self-defense (87).
Finally, high-risk behaviors shared by individuals in the same
social network, including alcohol and drug use and other crim-
inal and delinquent behaviors, may predispose connected indi-
viduals to share violent experiences, increasing risk for both
perpetration and victimization, as in the studies of peer and
co-offending networks (8, 46–48). We note that gun and other
weapon access and carrying play a critical link in each of these
types of network violence transmission, as illustrated in our
brief narrative review of gun-carrying studies.
Limitations of existing studies of the transmission of
violence
The studies of violence transmission reviewed here suffer
from a number of methodological limitations. The majority of
studies utilized cross-sectional (12–17) or case-control (29,
30) designs, including reliance on retrospective reports of
violence exposure within networks. This severely limits our
ability to draw inferences about the temporal associations be-
tween violence in one’s network and one’s own subsequent
victimization or perpetration. Prospective study designs, in
which recent violence exposure is measured at different points
in time and related to subsequent violence in individuals, are
needed to better elucidate the processes through which net-
work exposure to violence influences individuals’ own risk.
Several included studies of IPV recidivism reflect examples
of prospective designs, in which assault experiences were as-
sessed during a follow-up period after first classifying partic-
ipants by violence exposure at baseline (11, 31–33).
The data sources used to identify violence exposures and
outcomes also introduce a number of limitations and poten-
tial biases into the reviewed studies. First, several studies re-
lied on self-reports of both network violence exposure and
experiences of individual victimization or perpetration (12–14,
16, 17, 31). Associations may be either under- or overesti-
mated in these studies as a result of differential misclassifi-
cation, in which individuals with violent outcomes may be
more likely than those without such outcomes to under- or
overreport their network violence exposure. Second, a num-
ber of studies utilized confirmed measures of individual vio-
lent outcomes (e.g., IPV, homicide) yet relied on self-reports
of network violence exposures (15, 29, 30). For example,
weapon threats or use against intimate partners was verified
by court records in the study by Murrell et al. (15); however,
parental weapon violence was self-reported by the men in the
study, resulting in a noncomparable exposure measure and
potentially leading to underestimates of this exposure or
differential reporting influenced by the men’s own violent be-
haviors. Similarly, Roberts (29) and Campbell et al. (30) both
collected information on previous weapon threats or use by
intimate partners; the abused control women in these studies
may have been more reluctant than the cases to disclose such
details of their relationships, particularly if they were still in-
volved with the perpetrator. Furthermore, the use of proxy re-
spondents by Campbell et al. (30) may have resulted in
misclassification of previous weapon-related IPV among fe-
micide cases, because the family members and friends who
served as proxy respondents, although selected because of
their knowledge of the relationship between the femicide vic-
tim and her partner, may not have been privy to these details.

 In addition, studies relying on police reports to identify IPV
incidents and create co-offending networks (8, 11, 31, 33, 47,
48) likely provide a conservative look at violence transmis-
sion within networks, as connections and violent incidents
unknown to the police are not included. Finally, the network
measures of violence exposure presented in several studies
failed to specify the exact nature of the relation between the
study respondent and the victim or perpetrator of violence in
their network, utilizing language such as “family member”
and “close friend” (17), which may be interpreted differently
by different respondents and have different influences on vio-
lence risk. Specifying the exact relation of network members
(e.g., parents vs. siblings), as well as the degree of connect-
edness (e.g., close friend vs. friend of a friend), and using
data on violence collected directly from network members
as in the study by Haynie et al. (46) may shed further light on
the connections that most increase risk of violence. The in-
creasing use of formal network analysis to study the transmis-
sion of violence holds promise for clarifying these risks and
relevant points of intervention within networks, but it requires
new types of data collection and study design.
We found the literature on the transmission of gun vio-
lence within social networks to be disappointingly scarce,
with only 3 of the included studies specifically examining the
risk of individual gun violence associated with gun violence
in one’s social network and all 3 of these studies focusing on
co-offending networks. Although the other included studies
provided additional clues to the generation and consequences
of gun violence within other types of networks, many of them
utilized measures of “weapon” use, including firearms along
with other types of weapons like knives (12–15, 17, 32, 33, 46).
Although the carrying and use of a broad arrayof weapons bring
increased risks of violence worth noting (58, 59), the particular
lethality of firearms, along with their less frequent usage com-
pared with other weapons, suggests that distinguishing them
from other types of weapons is important for identifying indi-
viduals who may be at greatest risk for lethal violence. Further-
more, several studies failed to distinguish between weapon
threats and actual weapon use (15, 16, 31), which also has im-
portant implications for the severity of violence.
The reliance on restricted populations in several of the in-
cluded studies limits our ability to generalize the findings to
other groups or the population more broadly. Three of the in-
cluded studies among adolescents used school-based samples
(13, 17, 46), which may exclude youth who have dropped out
of school and are at perhaps even greater risk for gun violence
(61, 63, 67); others relied on samples with a historyof violence
(11, 12, 15, 29–33), which may display unique patterns of
weapon behaviors relative to individuals without a history of
violence. Studies also largely failed to consider differential es-
timated effects of network violence exposure across different
subgroups of the population, defined by sex, age, or urbanicity,
despite evidence that violence exposure may have different
outcomes for different groups (81).
Finally, although most of the included studies considered
potential confounders of the relation between network vio-
lence exposure and one’s own violent behaviors, the range
of confounders considered varied widely, and few studies
explicitly investigated potential mediators of the observed
relations. Several studies provided only simple unadjusted
comparisons of violence among individuals with and without
a connection to a victim or perpetrator (11, 12, 15, 17, 29,
31), leaving open the possibility that observed associations
could be explained by other correlates of both the exposure
and outcome. However, the majority included a variety of
potential confounders in adjusted models, including socio-
demographic characteristics of the participants and/or their
parents (8, 13, 14, 16, 30, 32, 33, 46–48); other previous vi-
olence experiences, such as childhood neglect, sexual abuse,
or other prior victimization (13, 16, 46); measures of parent-
ing quality and parent-child relationships (14, 46); lifetime
mental disorders (16); characteristics of the relationship be-
tween the victim and perpetrator and prior violent incidents
(30, 32, 33); other network characteristics, such as network
size and presence of gang members (8, 47, 48); and neighbor-
hood characteristics, such as income and residential stability
(33, 46). These studies generally did not specify hypothe-
sized pathways from network violence exposure to individual
violence risk, failing to distinguish between potential media-
tors and confounders. Although the finding of a positive as-
sociation between network violence exposure and individual
violence was generally upheld even when adjusting for other
covariates, the causal nature of the association cannot be in-
ferred from these observational studies without additional
assumptions. Improved data collection on potential con-
founders and mediators, preferably utilizing a prospective
study design, will be needed to advance our understanding
of the mechanisms connecting exposure to gun violence in
one’s network to one’s own gun violence risk (24, 82). More
advanced analytical techniques, including complex systems
modeling approaches, can also be utilized to test alternate
theories about the transmission of gun violence within net-
works, similar to models applied to infectious disease trans-
mission processes (88, 89), and to identify and test causal
models of violence transmission.
It should also be noted that our review itself was subject to
the limitations of any systematic review, especially our inclu-
sion of only a restricted number of databases and our appli-
cation of eligibility criteria that may have excluded other
potentially relevant studies.
Implications for interventions
Identifying and disrupting the spread of gun and other
weapon violence within high-risk networks hold great poten-
tial for reducing the burden of violence and its consequences
in the population. Our review suggests that children exposed
to violence in their households, including domestic violence
disputes or the gun victimization of a family member, should
be targeted for interventions aimed at improving psychoso-
cial functioning, reducing behavioral problems, and learning
conflict resolution strategies that do not involve violence;
these children may be identified by police or family courts
investigating domestic violence incidents or through services
offered in women’s shelters (24). Adult household members
may also benefit from parenting and conflict resolution train-
ing, for example, through home visitation programs, whether
they are living in a household prone to domestic conflict (24)
or in areas where gun violence is common (90). Similarly,
women or men who have been the victim of threats or use of

 a gun or other weapon by an intimate partner are in need of
intervention to prevent further escalation of violence. Health-
care practitioners should question individuals not only about
domestic violence but also about abusers’ access to a gun
(30) and should provide appropriate referrals to services and
information regarding serious risks in such situations (31).
Research on violence exposurewithin co-offending networks
provides unique insights that might be leveraged for more ef-
fective gun violence prevention efforts. In particular, network
graphing techniques, as well as potential risk-assessment
models, might be used to identify individuals occupying es-
pecially vulnerable positions within networks and to direct
resources and intervention efforts accordingly. Interventions
in Boston (91) and Cincinnati, Ohio (92), have already begun
using network analysis to identify potential high-risk gangs
as part of violence prevention efforts and have produced
statistically significant reductions in gun violence. For exam-
ple, a recent quasi-experimental evaluation of a gang vio-
lence reduction program in Boston found a 31% reduction
in shootings among gangs targeted by the program as com-
pared with similar gangs within the city (93). Insights from
the co-offending models reviewed here imply that similar ef-
forts targeted at individuals within networks have great po-
tential for reducing gun violence.
In conclusion, this review identified 16 articles that high-
light the important role of exposure to violence in one’s social
network as a risk factor for individual victimization and per-
petration, confirming the spread of violence through varied
network connections, including families, romantic relation-
ships, peers, and co-offenders. Further research on the transmis-
sion of gun violence specifically and on the exact mechanisms
through which the spread of gun violence occurs within net-
works is needed to fully understand how these transmission
processes can be most effectively disrupted.
