Abstract
Background—Cancer patients are encouraged to obtain second opinions prior to starting 
treatment. Little is known about men with localized prostate cancer who seek second opinions, the 
reasons why, and the association with treatment and quality of care.
Methods—We surveyed men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in the greater Philadelphia 
area in 2012-2014. Men were asked if they obtained a second opinion from a urologist, and the 
reasons why. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between 
second opinions and definitive prostate cancer treatment and perceived quality of prostate cancer 
care.
Results—2386 men responded to the survey (adjusted response rate 51.1%). 40% of men 
obtained second opinions, commonly because they wanted more information about their cancer 
(50.8%), and wanted to be seen by the best doctor (46.3%). Overall, obtaining second opinions 
was not associated with definitive treatment or perceived quality of cancer care. Men who sought 
second opinions because they were dissatisfied with their initial urologist were less likely to 
receive definitive treatment (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.73) and men who wanted more information 
about treatment were less likely to report excellent quality of cancer care (OR 0.70; 95% CI 
0.49-0.99) compared to men who did not receive a second opinion.
Conclusions—While a large proportion of men with localized prostate cancer obtained second 
opinions, they were not associated with treatment choice or perceived quality of cancer care. 
Future work is needed to determine when second opinions contribute to increasing the value of 
cancer care.

INTRODUCTION
The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society encourage patients with 
cancer to obtain second opinions prior to starting treatment.1 With increasing options for 
cancer treatment, patients need to weigh risks and benefits and consider how each choice 
aligns with their personal preferences. Second opinions may be helpful by enabling patients 
to gather more information about their cancer diagnosis, hear about potential management 
plans, and better understand their disease.2-4 However, relatively little is known about who 
seeks second opinions, the reasons why, and their impact on treatment choices and 
experiences of care.
In a recent systematic review, Ruetters et al. identified thirteen studies examining second 
opinions among cancer patients. Many of the published studies focused on women with 
breast cancer, had small sample sizes, frequently lacked racial, ethnic and socioeconomic 
diversity, and often, represented only single institutions.5 In the reviewed studies, 6.5% to 
36% of cancer patients obtained a second opinion. The most common reasons for obtaining 
second opinions included dissatisfaction with their initial physician, a desire for more 
information prior to making a treatment decision, and seeking confirmatory advice about 
their diagnosis and treatment recommendation.5 Prior studies show that second opinions 
may be linked with patient experience with cancer care; patients report higher level of 
satisfaction with physician communication during the second opinion visit, however, there is 
no association with perceived quality of care.3,6,7
Second opinions in the setting of prostate cancer may be uniquely important for several 
reasons. First, prostate cancer is common and a large public health burden with an estimated 
180,890 men diagnosed in 2016.8 Second, treatment options for localized prostate cancer 
vary widely from surgery and radiation therapy to active surveillance programs with 
differing benefits and costs.9-11 Second opinions could provide patients with more 
information about their treatment options.5 Third, research using claims data suggests that 
nearly forty percent of men have different diagnosing and treating urologists for their 
prostate cancer.12 While this may suggest that men frequently obtain second opinions, 
studies examining the prevalence of second opinions among this population are limited. 
Lastly, urologists providing a second opinion are more likely to recommend radical 
prostatectomy, potentially increasing the influence of second opinions on treatment.13
In this study, we assess the frequency and reasons for second opinions for localized prostate 
cancer and the characteristics of those that seek them. We also evaluate whether second 
opinions are associated with treatment choice and perceived quality of prostate cancer care. 
Based on prior studies, we hypothesized that men who obtained a second opinion would be 
more likely to receive definitive treatment but report similar quality of care compared to men 
that did not.

 METHODS
Data for this analysis were obtained from the Philadelphia Area Prostate Cancer Access 
Study (P2 Access), a cohort study of black and white men with newly diagnosed localized 
prostate cancer from the Greater Philadelphia Area. The University of Pennsylvania and 
Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Boards approved this study.
Patient population and recruitment
Men were identified from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR) and were eligible to 
participate if they were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between January 1, 2012 
and December 31, 2014, and were a resident of the greater Philadelphia region (defined as 
Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, and Philadelphia 
counties). Men were excluded if they had military insurance or received chemotherapy for 
treatment. For our analytic cohort, we also excluded men if they did not see a urologist for 
an initial consultation given this paper focuses on men who obtain second opinions from 
urologists (99% of men reported having an initial visit with a urologist).
Patients were mailed surveys between February 2014 and August 2015 (Supplement 1). An 
unconditional $2 incentive was provided with the first mailing. Non-responders were also 
sent an additional mailing of the survey and received follow up phone calls. Patients 
received $15 upon completion of the survey.
Measures
Second opinions—to determine if men obtained second opinions from another urologist, 
we asked: “Did you get an opinion from more than one urologist about your prostate cancer? 
In other words, did you get a second opinion?” If they answered yes, they were further asked 
to choose one or more of the following reasons for obtaining second opinions: (1) wanted 
more information about cancer; (2) dissatisfaction with initial doctor; (3) wanted the best 
doctor; (4) wanted information about treatment options not offered by initial doctor; (5) 
encouraged by family and friends; and (6) other. These reasons were selected based on 
previous studies and additionally were pilot tested within a similar cohort of men newly 
diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.1,3,6
Outcome measures—we determined whether a patient had received definitive treatment 
defined as either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy 
or seed brachytherapy) from the PCR. We measured perceived quality of prostate cancer 
care in the survey by asking men, “Overall, how would you rate the quality of health care for 
your prostate cancer?” with responses on a five point scale (dichotomized as excellent or not 
in our analyses).
Patient and tumor characteristics—additional patient characteristics measured in the 
survey included: age, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Insurance status at the 
time of diagnosis was obtained from the PCR. These factors have previously been shown to 
influence prostate cancer treatment.14,15 We calculated life expectancy using a validated 
mortality index using factors measured in the survey including: age, sex, body mass index,

 comorbidities, and functional limitations.16 We obtained tumor characteristics (tumor stage 
and Gleason score) from the PCR. Men were also asked if they had seen a radiation 
oncologist in the course of choosing their treatment for prostate cancer as specialist referral 
has been shown to influence treatment choice.17,18
Statistical analysis
We summarized the characteristics of respondents along with their reasons for obtaining a 
second opinion. Using a chi-squared test, we compared the sociodemographic factors (age, 
race/ethnicity, education, insurance, and marital status), clinical characteristics (Gleason 
score, clinical tumor stage, life expectancy) and consultation with another specialist 
(consultation with a radiation oncologist) of men who did and did not obtain a second 
opinion from a urologist. Using multivariable logistic regression, we investigated patient and 
tumor characteristics independently associated with obtaining a second opinion. We then 
modeled the association of obtaining a second opinion with three outcomes using 
multivariable logistic regression: a) receipt of definitive treatment; b) receipt of surgery 
among men who received definitive treatment; and c) perceived quality of prostate cancer 
care. As a secondary analysis, we examined the characteristics of men that sought second 
opinions for specific reasons (e.g., wanted more information about cancer) and the 
association of those second opinions with treatment choice and perceived quality of prostate 
cancer care. Separate models were run for each reason for obtaining a second opinion. 
Lastly, we examined the association between second opinions and receipt of definitive 
treatment and receipt of surgery among men who received definitive treatment among men 
with low risk prostate cancer (based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
classification).
To account for missing data in our model covariates, we used multiple imputation methods. 
Using multiple chained equations and performing five imputations, we imputed all 
covariates except for our primary independent variable (obtaining a second opinion) and our 
outcome variables (receipt of definitive treatment, type of treatment, and perceived quality of 
prostate cancer care).19 All analyses were performed using Stata 13.0 (College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Of the 4,672 eligible men, 2,386 responded to the survey for an adjusted response rate of 
51.1%. After applying exclusion criteria, the final analytic cohort included 2,365 
respondents. Responders were more likely to be white (77.5% vs. 61.5%), have private 
insurance (54.9% vs. 50.9%), and receive definitive treatment (79.5% vs. 70.9%) as 
compared to non-responders (Supplement Table 1). The average age of men who responded 
was 65.4 years (SD=8.4) (Table 1). The majority were white (78.5%), educated (62.2% with 
some college education or higher), and privately insured (55.3%). Most men had lower risk 
tumors with Gleason scores ≤7 (79.6%) and clinical tumor stage I disease (71.4%).
Frequency and Reasons for Second Opinions
A large proportion of men (40.2%) obtained a second opinion from a urologist and of these, 
over half (51.2%) reported more than one reason. The most common reasons cited for 
Radhakrishnan et al.

 obtaining second opinions from urologists included wanting more information about their 
cancer (50.8%) and wanting to be seen by the best doctor (46.3%) (Figure 1). Thirty one 
percent indicated they were encouraged by a family member or friend to get a second 
opinion and 25% noted they wanted to find out about treatment not offered by their first 
doctor. Dissatisfaction with their initial urologist was the least frequently reported reason to 
seek a second opinion (15.5%).
Association between Patient Characteristics and Second Opinions
In unadjusted analyses, younger men (49.4% for men <60 years vs. 23.6% for men ≥75 
years), men with college-level education (44.6% of college graduates and 49.2% beyond 
college education vs. 30.3% for those with less than high school), and privately insured men 
(45.5% compared to men with Medicaid (37.1%) and Medicare (32.7%)) were more likely 
to obtain second opinions (Table 2). In adjusted analyses, however, only age and education 
were significantly associated with obtaining second opinions from urologists. Compared to 
younger men, men 70-74 years old (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.32-0.70) and men ≥ 75 years (OR 
0.30; 95% CI 0.19-0.47) were less likely to obtain a second opinion whereas men with 
college graduate level education (OR 1.57; 95% 1.02-2.41) or beyond (OR 1.96; 95% CI 
1.31-2.92) were more likely compared to men with less than high school level education. 
Younger men (age <60) were more likely to cite wanting more information about their 
cancer and to see the best doctor as the reason to seek a second opinion (Supplement Table 
2). However, older men ≥75 years were the least likely to report obtaining a second opinion 
due to dissatisfaction with their initial urologist. Men with a college education or beyond 
also were more likely to cite wanting more information about their cancer as a motivation 
for a second opinion (Supplement Table 2).
Association of Second Opinions with Treatment and Perceived Quality of Care
Overall, nearly 80% of men received definitive treatment; 76.5% of men who obtained a 
second opinion from a urologist received definitive treatment compared to 81.6% who did 
not (p=0.04). In adjusted models, obtaining a second opinion was not associated with receipt 
of definitive treatment (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.84-1.08, Table 3). Similarly, among those who 
received definitive treatment, second opinions were not associated with receiving surgery. 
Further, among men with low risk disease, we did not observe a significant association 
between second opinions and receipt of definitive treatment or surgery. Receiving a second 
opinion was not associated with perceived quality of prostate cancer care.
Though they constituted a modest fraction of the sample, men who obtained a second 
opinion because they were dissatisfied with their initial doctor were less likely to receive 
definitive treatment compared to men who did not receive a second opinion (OR 0.49; 95% 
CI 0.32-0.73). Among men who received definitive treatment, those who obtained second 
opinions because they wanted more information about their cancer (OR 1.70; 95% CI 
1.24-2.34), the best doctor (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.72-3.51) or were encouraged by friends/
family (OR 2.25; 95%CI 1.49-3.39) were more likely to receive surgery compared to men 
who did not receive a second opinion. Men who sought second opinions because they 
wanted information about treatment not offered by their initial urologist were less likely to 
report excellent quality of prostate cancer care (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.49-0.99).

 DISCUSSION
In a large cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, 40% reported obtaining second 
opinions from urologists, most commonly because they wanted more information about their 
cancer and wanted to be seen by the best doctor. However, obtaining a second opinion was 
not associated with definitive treatment choice. National organizations in fact encourage 
patients to seek second opinions to promote preference-sensitive treatment decisions – a 
uniquely important concern for localized prostate cancer where there is concern for 
overtreatment. It is noteworthy that certain motivations for seeking second opinions – 
wanting more information, the best doctor, or from encouragement by friends/family – were 
actually associated with higher rates of surgery. Our results suggest that second opinions 
may be common in prostate cancer, however, the extent to which they promote delivery of 
high-value care remains less clear.
The proportion of men in our study that obtained a second opinion was similar to that 
described by DuGoff and colleagues in a study of men with prostate cancer but higher than 
rates have been reported in other types of cancer.6,12,20 The high rate of seeking second 
opinions for localized prostate cancer may reflect the complexity of decision-making for 
treatment with multiple different treatment modalities with varying risks and benefits. It may 
also reflect the less urgent nature of beginning treatment compared to other types of 
cancer.21,22 In contrast to other cancers, time to definitive treatment in localized prostate 
cancer has not been linked to better cancer control, potentially allowing men more time to 
seek out second opinions.23,24 Though other studies involving cancer patients have found 
that patients commonly seek second opinions due to dissatisfaction with their physician, this 
was the least likely reason in our study.5 These findings suggest that across different types of 
cancer, the motivations and context for seeking second opinions differ.
Earlier work by Tatterstall and colleagues found that 42% of cancer patients (mostly women 
with breast cancer) who saw a medical oncologist for a second opinion changed treatment.6 
Our study extends this by examining the impact of second opinions from urologists on 
prostate cancer treatment choices. Though we did not observe an overall association of 
second opinions with treatment choice, the sub-group of men who pursued a second opinion 
because they wanted more information, were seeking the best doctor, or were encouraged by 
friends or family were more likely to receive surgical treatment. It is possible that these men 
obtained second opinions because they wanted or were encouraged to have surgery and 
wanted the best doctor to perform it. In this context, second opinions may sometimes 
function as a way to carry out a planned treatment rather than as a way to explore treatment 
options. We further did not observe an association between second opinions and treatment 
among men with low risk disease which may suggest that second opinions, in and of 
themselves, may be insufficient to reduce overtreatment among this group.
Even without altering treatment patterns at a cohort-level, it is possible that second opinions 
remain important for aligning patient preferences with treatment choices. Similar to previous 
studies, we found that men with lower education were less likely to receive a second 
opinion.6,13,25 Seeking second opinions can be considered to reflect active engagement by 
the patient in their healthcare. Prior literature has shown that black men and men with lower

 education tend to participate less in shared medical decision-making related to their 
treatment, and black men in particular are notably under treated for their prostate 
cancer.4,20,26 This difference by socioeconomic status raises important considerations about 
the equitable distribution of cancer care, and future studies aimed at better understanding 
medical information seeking behaviors and targeting unmet needs amongst men with lower 
levels of education should be considered.
Our study has several limitations. First, our measure of second opinions was based on self-
report, which may be subject to recall and social desirability bias. However, in contrast to 
claims-based data which may only assess patterns of care, our study allows patients to 
directly state whether they sought a second opinion and to indicate the underlying reasons 
why. Second, we do not have information on the content of the discussions during a second 
opinion visit. To better understand how second opinions may or may not influence treatment 
choice, examining the content of physician-patient discussions is important for future work. 
Third, white men and those that received definitive treatment were more likely to respond to 
our survey. Fourth, our perceived measure of quality is not specific to particular providers. 
Finally, although the survey respondents were recruited from a cancer registry of a large and 
diverse geographic area with nearly 5.3 millions residents from urban and suburban locales, 
the findings may not be generalizable to other areas.
In accordance with recommendations from national cancer organizations, our results suggest 
that a large proportion of men with prostate cancer are obtaining an opinion from a second 
urologist regarding their treatment. The high rate of second opinions underscores their 
potential importance in cancer care delivery. At the same time, we did not observe an overall 
association between second opinions and either the receipt of definitive treatment or 
perceived quality. Additional research is needed to better understand the content of these 
second opinion visits in order to assess their value in cancer care.

*Separate models were constructed for obtaining second opinions overall, and for each specific reason for obtaining a second opinion with not 
obtaining a second opinion as the reference group. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age, race/ethnicity, education, 
insurance, marital status), clinical factors (10-year mortality risk, clinical tumor stage, Gleason score), and visit to radiation oncologist
