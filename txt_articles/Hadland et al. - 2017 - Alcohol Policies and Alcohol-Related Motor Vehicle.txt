abstract
BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a leading cause of death among young 
people in the United States. We examined the relationship between states’ alcohol policy 
environments and alcohol-related MVC fatalities among children, adolescents, and young 
adults under the minimum legal drinking age of 21 years.
METHODS: We used the Alcohol Policy Scale (APS), an assessment of 29 alcohol policies across 
50 states and Washington, DC, developed with the assistance of an interdisciplinary Delphi 
panel. Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, we examined APS scores in relation 
to fatalities of people ≤20 years old from 2000 to 2013 occurring in crashes in which ≥1 
involved driver had a blood alcohol content ≥0.08%. Logistic regression was used with a 
1-year lag between policies and MVC fatalities and adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of 84 756 MVC fatalities of those ≤20 years old during the study period, 23 757 
(28.0%) were alcohol related, including deaths of 11 006 (46.3%) drivers, 10 212 (43.0%) 
passengers, and 2539 (10.7%) pedestrians, cyclists, and others. People killed in alcohol-
related MVCs were predominantly male (72.7%) and older (65.5% were 18–20 years old), 
and 51.2% were non-Hispanic white. Restrictive policy environments were associated 
with fewer fatalities (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 per 10-percentage-point increase in APS 
score; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.94). The association was observed for drivers and 
passengers, male and female decendents, and children, adolescents, and young adults.
CONCLUSIONS: More restrictive alcohol policies are associated with reduced alcohol-related 
MVC mortality among young people. Studies should scrutinize the relationship between 
policies and fatalities to highlight mechanisms.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Motor vehicle 
crashes are a leading cause of death among young 
people in the United States. Stronger alcohol policies 
prevent motor vehicle crash deaths, but studies to 
date have examined only single policies rather than 
the overall alcohol policy environment.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We found that >1 in 4 
motor vehicle crash fatalities among children, 
adolescents, and young adults <21 years old were 
alcohol related and that stronger alcohol policy 
environments appeared protective for both drivers 
and passengers regardless of age and sex.

Unintentional injury is the leading 
cause of mortality for children, 
adolescents, and young adults in 
the United States. 
1 Motor vehicle 
crash (MVC) fatalities are the most 
common cause of unintentional 
injury deaths among young people, 
and 1 in 4 male and 1 in 5 female 
MVC fatalities involve alcohol. 
2, 
 
3 
More restrictive state-level alcohol 
policy environments, that is, a strong 
collection of alcohol control policies 
acting in concert in a state, have 
been linked to decreased alcohol 
consumption. 
4– 
6 Because adolescents 
and young adults who drink may 
drive while impaired or ride with an 
impaired driver, 
 
7 and children may 
be driven by adults who drink, 
 
8 more 
restrictive alcohol policies may be an 
effective intervention to reduce MVC 
deaths among young people.
However, studies to date have 
generally examined only the effect of 
single alcohol policies. 
9, 
 
10 
Additionally, most studies examining 
MVCs have examined the entire 
driving population rather than 
specifically considering young 
people. This is a critically important 
omission in the literature because 
adolescents and young adults under 
the minimum legal drinking age 
access alcohol through different 
means from adults ≥21 years old 
and are subject to different driving 
rules, such as graduated licensing 
requirements. 
6, 
 
11 Furthermore, 
deaths of young people who are 
passengers of alcohol-impaired adult 
drivers have not been systematically 
examined in relation to alcohol 
policies.8
A number of individual alcohol 
policies may lower risk of MVC 
death, such as provisions that reduce 
alcohol availability, 
 
12 raise the price of 
alcohol through taxes, 
 
13, 
 
14 lower legal 
blood alcohol limits for underage 
drivers, 
 
15, 
16 raise the minimum legal 
drinking age to 21 years, 
 
16, 
 
17 limit 
nighttime driving and transportation 
of passengers for underage 
drivers, 
 
11, 
 
15 and institute sobriety 
checkpoints.18, 
 
19 Alcohol-related 
MVC mortality is complex and likely 
to be influenced by multiple policies 
acting simultaneously to influence 
both drinking and driving behaviors. 
Therefore, it is critical to examine 
states’ comprehensive alcohol policy 
environments.
To identify associations between 
alcohol policy environments and 
MVC deaths among young people in 
US states, we used the Alcohol Policy 
Scale (APS) score, 
 
4 a novel rating 
system that takes into account the 
efficacy of alcohol policies and their 
level of implementation in a given 
state. We hypothesized that stronger 
(ie, more restrictive) alcohol policy 
environments would be associated 
with reduced alcohol-related MVC 
mortality.
METHODS
Alcohol Policy Environment
To quantify the alcohol policy 
environment, we used the APS, a 
previously validated assessment 
of policies across all 50 states and 
Washington, DC from 1999 to 
2012. 
4 
– 
6, 
 
10 Ratings were developed 
with the guidance of a modified Delphi 
panel of policy experts from academia, 
government, and the private sector 
who represented multiple disciplines, 
including law, sociology, economics, 
epidemiology, and psychology.
Policies for potential inclusion in the 
score were obtained from the Alcohol 
Policy Information System from the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism and other data 
sources. 
4, 
 
20 A full list of policies is 
available in Supplemental Table 4, 
and the coding system has been 
described previously. 
4
Once study investigators generated 
the list of alcohol policies for 
potential inclusion, the Delphi 
panelists independently assessed 
each policy with regard to its efficacy 
for reducing excessive drinking or 
alcohol-related harm. Panelists drew 
on their expertise and the available 
scientific literature to generate a 
5-point Likert score (1 = low efficacy, 
 
5 = high efficacy) for each policy for 
each state and year. Next, the panel 
met as a group to review ratings and 
discuss the evidence supporting each 
policy before independently rerating 
each policy after the discussion. 
These final ratings were compiled.
Panelists then provided ratings 
on the degree of legislative 
implementation for each policy 
for each state and year. To 
guide panelists in doing so, 
study investigators designed an 
implementation rating scale for 
each policy, specifically examining 
each law’s provisions that made the 
policy broadly applicable, effective, 
or enforceable at reducing excessive 
drinking or alcohol-related harm. 
For example, laws restricting hours 
of alcohol sales received higher 
implementation ratings the earlier 
they required stores to close (eg, 
states requiring closure by 12:00 
midnight received higher scores 
than states requiring closure by 
2:00 AM). Panelists then provided 
study investigators with feedback on 
the implementation rating scales for 
each policy, and investigators revised 
the scales based on this feedback, 
generating a possible range from 0 
(no policy in a given state that year) 
to 1.0 (policy present in a given state 
that year with the strongest possible 
provisions). 
4
Ultimately, 29 policies were 
included in the APS. To calculate 
an overall APS score for each state 
and year, each of the 5-point Likert 
efficacy scores was multiplied by 
its implementation score, and they 
were summed with the other policies 
for that state and year. 
4, 
 
6, 
 
10 We 
then standardized scores on a scale 
from 0 to 100, with high APS scores 
representing more restrictive alcohol 
policy environments.

MVC Fatalities
Data on fatal MVCs from 2000 
to 2013 were extracted from 
the Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System (FARS) database of the 
National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA). 
21 To have 
been recorded in FARS, an MVC death 
had to have occurred in a crash that 
involved ≥1 motor vehicle, directly 
resulted in any involved person’s 
death within 30 days of the incident, 
and occurred on a US public roadway.
For each state and year, we extracted 
data on all people ≤20 years of 
age who died as a result of a MVC. 
Decedents included people who 
were drivers, passengers, cyclists, 
pedestrians, or occupants of a 
motor vehicle not in transit. We 
also extracted data on age, sex, and 
race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, 
or other) of all decedents. We then 
defined “alcohol-related” MVC 
fatalities as those resulting from 
a crash in which ≥1 driver of any 
involved motor vehicle had a blood 
alcohol content (BAC) greater than 
or equal to the legal limit of 0.08%. 
If several vehicles with both drivers 
and passengers were involved in a 
crash and only 1 driver had a BAC 
≥0.08%, all people who died in that 
crash were considered an alcohol-
related MVC death. All people who 
died as cyclists, pedestrians, or 
occupants of a motor vehicle not in 
transit were killed by a driver with 
positive BAC in a moving vehicle.
BAC in FARS is ascertained by 
combining information from multiple 
sources, including police reports, 
coroner or medical examiner reports, 
and emergency medical service 
reports. Of all drivers involved in 
crashes in the present analyses, 
67.3% had a BAC that had been 
directly measured and recorded 
in FARS. To address missing data 
in FARS, NHTSA has developed 
an algorithm that uses multiple 
imputation that has been previously 
validated. 
22 In this approach, NHTSA 
provides 10 probability-based 
imputed values per missing BAC 
that are combined into an unbiased 
estimate and SE of the BAC by using 
multiple imputation. We applied this 
technique to the remaining 32.7% of 
drivers for whom BAC was missing in 
our sample.
Statistical Analyses
Alcohol-related MVC deaths were 
first stratified according to whether 
the decedent was a driver or a 
passenger, and we also examined 
overall alcohol-related MVC deaths 
(including drivers and passengers, 
as well as pedestrians, cyclists, and 
occupants of a motor vehicle not in 
transit who were killed as a result 
of a driver with BAC ≥0.08%). We 
also explored time trends in alcohol 
involvement in MVC deaths over the 
study period by using BAC cutoffs of 
>0% (ie, any amount of alcohol in the 
blood) and ≥0.05%. To describe the 
epidemiology of alcohol-related MVC 
deaths, we also examined the day of 
the week and time of day that such 
deaths occurred during the study 
period.
Odds ratios (ORs) were computed for 
alcohol-related MVC deaths across 
states in relation to their APS score. 
Recognizing that there is often a 
delay between enactment of a policy 
and its actual implementation, we 
introduced a 1-year lag between 
exposure and outcome such that, 
for example, MVC fatalities from 
2006 were examined in relation 
to APS scores from 2005. We used 
the alternating logistic regression 
algorithm to account for clustering 
of multiple MVC deaths within a 
single crash and of multiple crashes 
occurring within a single state. 
23 
Associations were examined for 
overall MVC deaths, as well as 
for driver and passenger deaths 
separately. We generated a map 
of state-by-state comparisons of 
the proportion of MVCs that were 
alcohol-related and APS scores 
pooling the 2 most recent years 
of data available to generate 
information about the current public 
health and policy context across the 
United States.
After identifying bivariate 
associations between APS score 
and odds of alcohol-related MVC 
fatality, we evaluated sequential 
multivariable models incorporating 
sex, age, race or ethnicity, year 
(treated as an indicator variable), and 
state-level covariates (proportion 
male, proportion ≥21 years old, race 
and ethnicity proportions, college 
education, median household income, 
level of urbanization, policing rates, 
and vehicle miles traveled). All state-
level covariates were extracted from 
the US Census Bureau’s American 
Community Survey and Current 
Population Survey with the exception 
of vehicle miles traveled, which 
were obtained from the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism. 
14, 
 
24, 
 
25 We also examined 
final multivariable models with 
respect to odds of a fatal alcohol-
involved MVCs involving BAC 
≥0.05% and >0%. After fitting 
multivariable models, we repeated 
models stratifying by sex, age, 
and race and ethnicity to examine 
associations between APS score 
and alcohol-related MVC fatalities 
according to sociodemographic 
characteristics and identified 
associations according to day of the 
week and time of day.
Analyses were performed in 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC). All P values were 
2-sided and considered significant 
at P < .05.
RESULTS
Across states from 1999 to 2012, the 
mean APS score by state-year was 42 
(SD, 8; range 24 [Iowa in 1999] to 75 
[Utah in 2011]). The APS increased 
during the study period (mean APS 
in 1999, 38; mean APS in 2012, 45; 
P < .001 for trend).

From 2000 to 2013, there were 
84 756 MVC fatalities observed 
among people ≤20 years of age, 
of which 23 757 (28.0%) were 
alcohol-related (as defined by ≥1 
involved driver in the MVC having a 
BAC ≥0.08%). Among these 23 757 
alcohol-related MVC deaths, 11 006 
(46.3%) were drivers, 10 212 
(43.0%) were passengers, and 2539 
(10.7%) were pedestrians, cyclists, 
or occupants of a motor vehicle not 
in transit; nearly four-fifths (79.5%) 
of passenger deaths occurred in a 
vehicle operated by a driver ≥21 
years of age.  
Fig 1 shows trends in 
the proportion of MVC deaths that 
were alcohol involved according 
to different BAC thresholds. The 
proportion of MVC deaths that were 
alcohol involved remained nearly 
constant during the study period at 
all BAC levels.
 
Table 1 lists the characteristics of 
decedents of alcohol-related MVCs. 
As noted, underage driver decedents 
were more likely to be male, older 
(18–20 years), and non-Hispanic 
white compared with passengers, 
who had a higher proportion of 
female decedents, younger decedents 
(16–17 years), and those with race 
or ethnicity other than non-Hispanic 
white.  
Fig 2 shows the proportion of 
alcohol-related MVC fatalities by day 
of week and time of day. Nearly one-
half (47.6%) of all deaths occurred 
in the evening or after midnight on a 
weekend night (ie, between 6:00 PM 
Friday evening and 5:59 AM on 
Saturday morning and between 
6:00 PM on Saturday evening and 
5:59 AM on Sunday morning).

fatalities that were alcohol related

Alcohol-related MVC fatalities were those occurring in crashes in which the BAC of ≥1 involved driver was ≥0.08%.
a “Overall” category includes not only drivers and passengers but also pedestrians, cyclists, and occupants of motor vehicles not in transit; therefore, this category contains a larger 
sample than the sum of the “Drivers” and “Passengers” columns.

Table 3 displays aORs for alcohol-

with a 10-percentage-point increase

stratified by decedent and crash-
related characteristics. Stronger 
alcohol policy environments were 
associated with lower odds of 
alcohol-related MVC fatalities for 
both sexes and for all age categories. 
However, the association was 
significant only for people from 
non-Hispanic white and other 
backgrounds and for passengers who 
were Hispanic. The associations were 
similar and significant regardless 
of day of week and were significant 
at various times of day except for 
drivers killed in a daytime MVC and 
passengers killed in an evening MVC.
DISCUSSION
This study offers a comprehensive 
examination of alcohol-related 
MVC fatalities among children, 
adolescents, and young adults in 
the United States in relation to 
states’ alcohol policy environments. 
From 2000 to 2013, >1 in 4 deaths 
from MVCs were alcohol related 
(ie, attributable to a driver with a 
BAC above the legal limit of 0.08%), 
and more than half involved a 
driver with any level of alcohol >0. 
Nearly half of all deaths occurred 
at nighttime on weekends. More 
importantly, we found that a 
10-percentage-point increase in the 
strength of states’ alcohol policy 
environments was associated with a 
9% decrease in the odds of alcohol-
related MVC fatalities.
These findings are consistent 
with previous studies in which we 
found that states with restrictive 
alcohol policy environments have 
lower levels of binge drinking and 
self-reported impaired driving. 
4, 
 
6, 
 
26 
Our results suggest that reducing 
driving after any amount of 
drinking may be an important 
policy goal, because one-quarter 
of young people died in MVCs in 
which the BAC of the driver was 
positive but below the 0.08% legal 
limit. Previous research shows 
that a higher BAC clearly places 
young people at increased risk of 
alcohol-related MVC death (either 
as drivers or passengers) in a dose-
dependent fashion; the relative risk

A 1-y lag was introduced between APS score and MVC fatalities (eg, states’ mortality rates from 2013 were associated with APS scores from 2012).
a All models adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, year (as a categorical variable), and state-level covariates (proportion male, proportion ≥21 y old, race and ethnicity proportions, 
college education, median household income, level of urbanization, policing rates, and vehicle miles traveled). Alcohol-related MVCs were defi
 ned as those in which the BAC of ≥1 driver 
involved was ≥0.08%.
b “Overall” category includes not only drivers and passengers but also pedestrians, cyclists, and occupants of motor vehicles not in transit.
c Driver deaths were not examined for 0- to 15-y-old drivers because of small sample size.

of MVC fatality is increased by 55% 
among young male drivers and by 
35% among young female drivers 
at a measured BAC of only 0.01% to 
0.02%. 
27 Recognizing the elevated 
risk of MCV death even after only 
low levels of alcohol consumption, 
approximately half of countries 
worldwide have imposed lower 
legal BAC limits, most commonly 
0.05%.28, 
 
29 Notably, whereas other 
industrialized countries have 
experienced a decrease in alcohol-
involved crashes in recent decades, 
the United States has continued 
to demonstrate little decline in 
alcohol-related MVC mortality. 
30
We found that the potential 
impact of alcohol policies was 
consistent across sex and age and 
generally held for drivers as well as 
passengers. This relationship did 
not hold for young people who were 
Hispanic or non-Hispanic black. 
Although previous data show that 
black and Hispanic people are less 
likely than white people to have 
an alcohol-related MVC, 
 
31 other 
studies have shown that seat belt 
and child restraint laws may have 
lower penetration to black and 
Hispanic populations in the United 
States. 
32 Thus, poor safety restraint 
usage might dampen the potential 
impact of alcohol policies on MVC 
deaths among minority populations. 
It is important that future research 
disentangle the extent to which 
policies may not have an equal effect 
on all sectors of the population and 
thus exacerbate health disparities.
Although younger children in 
the study were driven by adults 
who had been drinking, many 
adolescents and young adults were 
killed in MVCs in which the driver 
was also <21 years old. Previous 
studies highlight that legal BAC 
limits <0.08% are appropriate for 
underage youth drivers, because 
they are less experienced and may 
be disproportionately at risk for 
MVCs even after drinking only small 
amounts. 
27, 
 
33 Zero tolerance laws, 
which prohibit driving after any 
amount of drinking for people ≤20 
years of age, have been associated 
with a decrease in MVC mortality of 
~20%. 
16 Our results showed that 
most alcohol-related MVC fatalities 
among young people occur at 
nighttime and support graduated 
licensing laws that place restrictions 
on driving after dark. 
34 
– 
37 Limiting 
passengers of underage drivers (also 
a component of many graduated 
licensing laws) may be appropriate 
because a large number of youth who 
died in alcohol-related MVCs were 
passengers rather than drivers. 
35, 
 
37– 
39 
Notably, most states in the United 
States have already implemented 
graduated licensing laws that include 
these and other provisions, 
 
39, 
 
40 
thus highlighting the importance 
of enforcing such laws. 
41– 
43 
Opportunities for enforcement 
include sobriety checkpoints, which 
not only offer opportunities to stop 
drivers who operate vehicles while 
intoxicated but also raise awareness 
of possible apprehension and 
serve as a deterrent for impaired 
driving. 
18, 
 
19
There are several limitations to this 
study. There are no cross-state data 
on enforcement of alcohol policies; 
thus, it is possible that some 
policies may have been efficacious 
but lacked enforcement in some 
settings. Nonetheless, in developing 
the implementation rating for 
policies, study investigators and 
panelists carefully considered 
whether policies included provisions 
that made policies more likely to 
be enforceable. 
4, 
 
10 Additionally, 
reverse causality is possible, in that 
states with lower rates of underage 
drinking and lower mortality from 
alcohol-related MVCs might have 
been the same states to establish 
stronger alcohol policies. To 
address this concern, we lagged 
MVC fatalities by 1 year after the 
measured APS score to establish 
temporality in the relationship 
between exposure and outcome. 
Finally, APS scores incorporated 
only state policies and do not 
account for interactions with federal 
or local policies.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study supports the importance 
of comprehensive alcohol policies 
to reduce alcohol-related MVC 
fatalities among young people. 
More restrictive alcohol policy 
environments are clearly associated 
with lower odds of alcohol-related 
MVCs, an effect that holds for drivers 
and passengers alike and across 
age and sex. Future research should 
examine whether demographic 
subgroups such as non-Hispanic 
black and Hispanic people benefit 
equally from current state policies 
and should distinguish which 
policies within the overall policy 
environment are most effective. Our 
findings lay the groundwork for 
studying the relationship between 
the alcohol policy environment and 
crash fatalities in the United States 
and internationally.
