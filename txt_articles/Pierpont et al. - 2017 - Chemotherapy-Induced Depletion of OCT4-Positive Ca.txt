In Brief
Using a mouse testicular germ cell tumor
model, Pierpont et al. establish that male
germ cells are susceptible to malignant
transformation during a restricted
window of embryonic development. The
cancer stem cells of the resulting
testicular cancers demonstrate
genotoxin hypersensitivity, rendering
these malignancies highly responsive to
conventional chemotherapy.

SUMMARY
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are among
the most responsive solid cancers to conventional
chemotherapy. To elucidate the underlying mecha-
nisms, we developed a mouse TGCT model featuring
germ cell-specific Kras activation and Pten inactiva-
tion. The resulting mice developed malignant, meta-
static TGCTs composed of teratoma and embryonal
carcinoma, the latter of which exhibited stem cell
characteristics, including expression of the pluripo-
tency factor OCT4. Consistent with epidemiological
data linking human testicular cancer risk to in utero
exposures, embryonic germ cells were susceptible
to malignant transformation, whereas adult germ
cells
underwent
apoptosis
in
response
to
the
same oncogenic events. Treatment of tumor-bearing
mice with genotoxic chemotherapy not only pro-
longed survival and reduced tumor size but also
selectively eliminated the OCT4-positive cancer
stem cells. We conclude that the chemosensitivity
of TGCTs derives from the sensitivity of their cancer
stem cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.
INTRODUCTION
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most commonly
diagnosed cancers in young men in the United States and Eu-
rope, and they are increasing in incidence (Nigam et al., 2015).
Intriguingly, testicular cancers are among the most responsive
cancers to chemotherapy. Prior to modern genotoxic chemo-
therapy, the 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with met-
astatic testicular germ cell cancer was only 5%. Remarkably,
with conventional chemotherapeutics and surgery, 99% of pa-
tients with early-stage disease and 74% of patients with late-
stage disease now live at least 5 years (Howlader et al., 2016).
TGCTs arise from transformed germ cells, most likely prenatal
germ cells, such as primordial germ cells or spermatogonial
precursors. In the latest classification scheme, TGCTs are cate-
gorized by whether or not they originate from a precursor lesion
termed germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) of the testis (Moch
et al., 2016). Seminomas and nonseminomas are malignancies
that do originate from GCNIS, and they were referred to as
type II TGCTs in earlier classifications. These are the most com-
mon TGCTs in adult males and frequently metastasize (Chieffi
and Chieffi, 2013). TGCTs that do not originate from GCNIS
include infantile teratomas and yolk sac tumors as well as
spermatocytic seminomas (previously referred to as type I and
type III TGCTs, respectively). To date, mouse TGCT models
have featured primarily benign teratomas rather than the more
common malignancies originating from GCNIS.
Men presenting with TGCTs often have mixed TGCTs
comprised of both seminoma and nonseminoma components,
most notably containing highly malignant embryonal carcinoma
(EC) tissue. EC cells are totipotent and well established to have
stem cell properties. Indeed, a single EC cell is sufficient to reca-
pitulate an entire tumor (Kleinsmith and Pierce, 1964). EC cells
share many characteristics with embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
and they are similarly identified by expression of the pluripotency
factor OCT4 (de Jong et al., 2005). OCT4 is used clinically as a
diagnostic marker for EC and seminoma as well as early pre-
invasive GCNIS lesions (de Jong and Looijenga, 2006). EC cells
also express other pluripotency markers, including SOX2 and
NANOG (de Jong et al., 2008; Hart et al., 2005), and either differ-
entiate, giving rise to teratoma tissue, or remain undifferentiated
and highly malignant, as they do in metastatic TGCTs such as
teratocarcinoma, a mixed germ cell tumor composed of EC
and teratoma.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs), also referred to as tumor-initiating
cells or tumor-propagating cells, are cancer cells with the capac-
ity to self-renew as well as differentiate (Visvader and Lindeman,
2012). Such cell populations have been characterized in several
cancers, including glioblastomas, breast cancers, and germ cell
tumors. Many somatic CSCs have been linked with chemoresist-
ance, making them particularly interesting clinically because
failure to target and eliminate CSCs would leave a patient sus-
ceptible to relapse. In contrast to CSCs in somatic cancers,
EC cells cultured in vitro are sensitive to DNA-damaging chemo-
therapeutics (Oosterhuis et al., 1984). Furthermore, chemore-
sistant TGCTs often show loss of pluripotency gene expression

 (Taylor-Weiner et al., 2016). We propose that the unique chemo-
sensitivity of germ cell-derived CSCs plays an important role in
the overall curability of TGCTs and highlights the potential
benefit of developing therapies that eliminate CSCs in cancers
that are refractory to current treatments.
The molecular basis for the chemosensitivity of TGCTs re-
mains elusive. One explanation for why somatic cancers are
resistant to genotoxic chemotherapy is that they accumulate
mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, most
notoriously in the p53 gene (Bartkova et al., 2007b). DDR signals
like the early double-strand break marker gH2AX are often
constitutively active in early-stage somatic cancers (Bartkova
et al., 2005, 2007a). This DDR activation can act as a tumorigen-
esis barrier by slowing or halting cell cycle progression in the
presence of oncogene-induced DNA damage, but it may also
create selective pressure to mutate the genes involved in
maintaining that barrier, thus facilitating continued tumorigen-
esis despite genomic instability (Bartkova et al., 2005, 2007a,
2007b). Once DDR genes have been mutated, cells no longer
respond appropriately to DNA damage, including damage
induced by chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin. Depending on
the particular genes affected and the tissue context, DDR muta-
tions can either enable avoidance of DNA damage-induced
apoptotic signals, conferring chemoresistance, or render cancer
cells susceptible to particular genotoxins or to the inhibition of
residual DDR function, approaches that are now being evaluated
for clinical efficacy. Unlike solid tumors of somatic origin, human
TGCTs do not exhibit constitutive DDR activation during early
tumorigenesis (Bartkova et al., 2007a). This lack of DDR signaling
in TGCTs may alleviate the selective pressure to mutate DDR
genes, such as Atm and p53, which are mutated at unusually
low frequency in TGCTs compared to somatically derived solid
tumors (Bartkova et al., 2007a, 2007b).
Previous studies of malignant TGCTs have focused primarily
on the analysis of cultured tumor cells and histological sections
of human tumors, since genetically engineered mouse models of
TGCT have been limited to those that develop well-differentiated
teratomas with little EC and low rates of metastasis, thus being
representative of the less-common pediatric TGCTs. These
mouse teratoma models include conditional knockout of the
Pten tumor suppressor targeted to primordial germ cells (Kimura
et al., 2003) as well as 129-Dnd1Ter/Ter mice (Stevens, 1973),
which are homozygous for a mutation in the Dead end gene
(Youngren et al., 2005). Interestingly, the 129 strain background
is permissive for testicular teratoma formation in mice; on other
strain backgrounds, the Dnd1Ter/Ter mutation leads to BAX-
mediated germ cell apoptosis rather than tumorigenesis (Cook
et al., 2009).
Susceptibility genes have been identified for mouse testicular
teratomas, including the Steel locus, which encodes Kit ligand,
as well as additional loci (Bustamante-Marı
´n et al., 2013). Similar
susceptibility factors have been identified in human TGCTs,
including PTEN and KITLG (Litchfield et al., 2016). Inactivating
PTEN mutations in humans specifically mark the transition
from TGCT precursor lesions to invasive germ cell tumors
(Di Vizio et al., 2005). The most common chromosomal aberra-
tion in human TGCTs is isochromosome 12p (Litchfield et al.,
2016), an additional copy of a region from the small arm of chro-
mosome 12, which contains the KRAS oncogene (KRAS2) as
well as several stem cell-related genes (NANOG, STELLA, and
others).
To develop a genetically engineered TGCT mouse model
representative of malignant TGCTs in men, we targeted both
Kras activation and Pten tumor suppressor inactivation to pre-
meiotic germ cells, which led to rapid development of metastatic
mixed testicular germ cell tumors in young male mice. These ma-
lignancies contained substantial populations of pluripotent EC
cells with tumor-propagating activity, and these CSCs were
selectively depleted following chemotherapy, defining a key
determinant of the remarkable chemosensitivity of TGCTs.
RESULTS
Generation of Germ Cell-Specific Pten and Kras
Mutant Mice
To study the remarkable responsiveness of TGCTs to DNA-
damaging chemotherapeutics, we developed a genetically
engineered mouse model of malignant, metastatic TGCT by
conditionally activating the Kras oncogene and inactivating the
Pten tumor suppressor gene specifically in germ cells. This
was accomplished using mice carrying a G12D-activating muta-
tion in the first exon of the endogenous Kras gene, preceded by a
conditional LoxP-Stop-LoxP cassette (LSL-KrasG12D; Jackson
et al., 2001), as well as a conditional allele of Pten (Ptenflox/flox)
in which the critical exon 5 is flanked by LoxP sites (Lesche
et al., 2002). Recombination between adjacent LoxP sites, which
enables KrasG12D expression and inactivates Pten, was medi-
ated by the CRE recombinase under the control of a portion of
the Stra8 promoter (Stra8-Cre; Sadate-Ngatchou et al., 2008),
which is active primarily in mitotic spermatogonia in early post-
natal life and continuing throughout adulthood. Double-mutant
experimental animals, which we refer to as gPAK mice for
germ cell-specific Pten and Kras mutant mice, harbored one
conditional and one null allele of Pten (Ptenflox/�), one copy of
the conditional LSL-KrasG12D allele (Kras+/LSL), and the Stra8-
Cre transgene (Stra8-CreTg) on a mixed-strain background.
Both single- and double-mutant mice were obtained at expected
frequencies.
Simultaneous Stra8-Cre-Driven Kras Activation and
Pten Inactivation Result in Testicular Germ Cell
Tumorigenesis
While Kras activation or Pten inactivation individually rarely re-
sulted in TGCT formation, combined Kras activation and Pten
inactivation in gPAK mice led to rapid germ cell tumorigenesis,
with 75% of gPAK mice succumbing to large bilateral or unilat-
eral TGCTs with a median tumor-free survival of 24.5 days (Fig-
ure 1A). The reduction in tumor-free survival in gPAK mice as
compared to controls was highly significant (p = 1.56 3 10�6),
and no control mice developed tumors within the same time
period.
TGCTs in these mice were characterized histologically as
teratocarcinomas, which are mixed germ cell tumors (nonsemi-
noma) containing teratomatous components, including tissues
derived from all three germ layers as well as highly malignant
EC tissue (Figures 1B–1F). Metastases that histopathologically

1897
 resembled the primary neoplasms were detected in at least 37%
of TGCT-bearing gPAK mice at various sites, including spleen,
liver, pancreas, and abdominal lymph nodes (Figure 1G).
gPAK TGCTs Express OCT4 and Other Pluripotency
Markers
The OCT4 transcription factor is a key regulator of pluripotency.
OCT4 expression is used in human patients as a diagnostic
marker for EC as well as for TGCT precursor lesions (de Jong
and Looijenga, 2006). The presence of EC is the main histological
feature that distinguishes teratocarcinoma from benign tera-
toma. To assess OCT4 expression in gPAK TGCTs, we per-
formed OCT4 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on serial sections
from early- and late-stage gPAK teratocarcinomas and metasta-
ses, as well as on benign 129-Dnd1Ter/Ter teratomas for compar-
ative purposes. All gPAK tumors contained prominent clusters of
OCT4-positive (OCT4+) cells distributed in a multifocal pattern
throughout the primary tumors (Figures 2A–2C), as did 50% of
metastases (Figure 2D; proximal lymph node metastasis). In
contrast, 3 of 3 129-Dnd1Ter/Ter teratoma samples were OCT4
negative (Figure 2E).
In addition to the use of OCT4 in human TGCT diagnostics, an
array of stem cell markers has been established for distinguish-
ing between subtypes of TGCTs. For example, NANOG is a spe-
cific marker of EC and seminoma as well as the precursor lesion
GCNIS, and it is not expressed in mature teratomas (Hart et al.,
2005); SOX2 is expressed in EC, but not in GCNIS or seminoma
(de Jong et al., 2008). SOX17 is present in GCNIS, seminoma,
and teratoma, but not in EC (de Jong et al., 2008; Nonaka,
2009). Similar to what has been reported for human specimens,
129-Dnd1Ter/Ter teratomas did contain cells expressing SOX2
and SOX17, whereas EC clusters within gPAK teratocarcinomas
were positive for the stem cell markers OCT4, NANOG, SSEA1,
and SOX2, but they were devoid of SOX17 (Figures 2A, 2B,
and 2E). Thus, gPAK TGCTs express the same stem cell-associ-
ated markers as human malignant TGCTs. gPAK TGCTs were
also highly proliferative, as indicated by Ki67 staining (Figure 2B).
Finally, we assessed the activation of AKT, which is normally
opposed by PTEN, in gPAK samples. AKT phosphorylation
was observed specifically in tumor tissue from gPAK mice and
only in a subset of tumor cells (Figure 2F).
To determine whether gPAK ECs were CSCs, we first tested
for tumor propagation by transplantation into secondary recip-
ient mice. Whereas teratomas fail to form secondary tumors
upon transplantation (Sachlos et al., 2012), gPAK TGCTs could
readily be transplanted into secondary recipient mice and serially
propagated (Table S1), and the resulting tumors contained
OCT4+ EC cells (Figure S1A). These results suggested that EC,
the malignant component of teratocarcinoma that is lacking in
teratoma, had tumor-propagating activity, in agreement with
previous studies (Kleinsmith and Pierce, 1964). To confirm this,
we bred an OCT4-GFP transgene into the gPAK model, isolated
OCT4+ and OCT4� cells from the resulting tumors, and tested
tumor-propagating activity (Figures S1B–S1E). The OCT4+ pop-
ulation formed teratocarcinoma in secondary hosts whereas
OCT4� cells did not, confirming that the OCT4+ EC cells have
tumor-propagating activity and function as CSCs.
gPAK TGCTs Originate during Embryonic Development
The rapid development of TGCTs in gPAK mice prompted us to
examine the precise timing of tumor initiation in this model. Stra8
is a developmentally regulated gene that is expressed in early
germ cells just prior to their entry into the meiotic program
(Feng et al., 2014). In mice, Stra8 is broadly expressed in

Kras+/LSL (Kras single-mutant) mice or control mice (including Cre-negative as well as Stra8-CreTg Pten+/flox Kras+/+ animals). Tumor-free survival was significantly
reduced in gPAK mice relative to controls (log rank test; p = 1.56 3 10�6), but not in Pten single mutants, despite the low incidence tumor formation (log rank test;

 spermatogonia beginning at post-natal day (P)3. The Stra8-Cre
transgene, used here to generate gPAK mice, contains a frag-
ment of the Stra8 promoter that is reported to be expressed in
spermatogonial stem cells (Sadate-Ngatchou et al., 2008). While
Stra8-Cre has been shown to be expressed at P3 in the pre-
meiotic spermatogonial cells, we observed substantial tumors,
sometimes occupying the majority of the testis, in 3 of 4 gPAK
mice at P10, 1 of 1 gPAK mouse at P6, and 3 of 7 gPAK mice
at P3, as well as 2 of 5 Pten single-mutant mice at P3, suggesting
that the neoplasms originate prior to P3 (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
all gPAK mice that developed TGCTs did so by 33 days, suggest-
ing an early developmental window for tumor susceptibility.

 Thus, to determine the precise timing of Pten/Kras manipu-
lation in our model, we used a CRE-responsive fluorescent
reporter, and we assessed the precise timing of Stra8-Cre activ-
ity. While Stra8-Cre was broadly expressed in spermatogonia
beginning at P3, a few small clusters of tdTomato-positive cells
(indicative of Stra8-Cre expression) were identifiable within the
seminiferous tubules beginning at embryonic day (E)12.5 and
observed in 6 of 6 embryos (Figure 3B). No tdTomato-positive
cells were detected prior to E12.5. From E13.5 to E18.5, the
number and approximate size of the clusters remained un-
changed. Beginning at P0, additional individual cells throughout
the testes became tdTomato positive and the clusters also

 expanded, resulting in staining throughout the testes by P3.
Similar results were observed with a LacZ reporter (Figure S2).
The presence of these infrequent clusters of Cre-expressing
cells in the embryonic testis, together with our observations of
only one or two tumor initiation sites per testis in gPAK mice, is
consistent with the notion that germ cell tumorigenesis in the
gPAK model arises from rare, early Stra8-Cre expression in
only a few germ cells during embryogenesis. We also used the
tdTomato reporter in combination with Pten/Kras targeting as a
sensitive approach to identify early neoplasms, and we detected
well-developed TGCTs in 3 of 5 gPAK mice at P0 (Figure 3C),
providing further evidence for the in utero origins of these
neoplasms.
Most pre-invasive somatic cancers express markers of DDR
activation, including gH2AX, but human TGCTs interestingly
lack such activation (Bartkova et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b).
It has been proposed that a lack of DDR activation in TGCTs
may reduce selective pressure to mutate key DDR genes that
enforce the anti-cancer barrier, explaining why TGCTs rarely
have mutations in DDR genes like p53, unlike somatic cancers.
To test whether gPAK mouse TGCTs similarly share this prop-
erty, we assessed the presence of gH2AX, one of the earliest
DDR signals, in early-stage gPAK TGCTs. Similar to the findings
in early-stage human TGCTs (Bartkova et al., 2007b), we found
that gPAK TGCTs were largely devoid of gH2AX-positive cells,
particularly in OCT4+ regions. gH2AX expression was instead
confined to the meiotic cells of the seminiferous epithelium,
which mount a DDR during normal meiotic progression (Figures
3D–3F). These results provide further parallels between the
gPAK TGCT model and human disease, establishing the utility
of gPAK mice for investigating the link between DDR activation
status and chemosensitivity in these uniquely treatable cancers.
Testicular Germ Cells Exhibit a Restricted
Developmental Window of Susceptibility to Oncogenic
Transformation
Since Stra8-Cre expression occurs early in embryonic testis, and
gPAK tumor formation appears to initiate from rare CRE-ex-
pressing embryonic germ cells, we were interested in under-
standing the impact of oncogenic events occurring at higher
frequency with the onset of broader CRE expression at P3.
Germ cell proliferation and germ cell numbers were, therefore,
quantified in post-natal gPAK mice without apparent neoplasms.
We first assessed the cellularity of P3 gPAK testes (Figure 4A),
and we performed IHC staining for mouse VASA homolog
(MVH/Ddx4; Figure 4B), which marks early germ cells (Fujiwara
et al., 1994). No significant differences in germ cell numbers
were detected at P3 in any of the tumor-free single or double mu-
tants (Figure 4C). There was, however, increased cellularity in the
seminiferous epithelium of gPAK testes relative to controls at
P10 (81.2 ± 8.8 cells per tubule in gPAK mice versus 56.6 ± 4.1
in controls; p = 0.0351) and P17 (141.5 ± 14.0 cells per tubule
in gPAK mice versus 101.4 ± 5.3 in controls; p = 0.0177)
(Figure 4D). To measure proliferating germ cells, we performed
IHC staining for the proliferation marker phospho-histone H3
(pH3). Tumor-free gPAK testes had significantly increased
numbers of pH3-positive cells at P10 relative to controls
(p = 0.045), but not at P3 (Figures 4E and 4F). Interestingly

 proliferation returned to normal levels by P17 in tumor-free gPAK
testes, and it was followed by dysplastic changes in the testis as
early as P30 and P40, accompanied by significantly increased
germ cell death (p < 0.005) (Figures 5A, 5B, and S3).
By P180 the seminiferous tubules of tumor-free gPAK mice
exhibited prominent degenerative changes, including vacuoliza-
tion, pyknotic nuclei, and multinucleate spermatid giant cells as
well as increased numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl tranfer-
ase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic cells
apparent at various stages of spermatogenesis (Figures 5C–5E
and S3; p = 0.002). 25% of gPAK mice never developed tumors,
and these tumor-free adult gPAK mice had decreased testis
size and significantly decreased numbers of epididymal sperm
(p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively; Figures 5F and 5G).
Pten single mutants showed increased vacuolization and degen-
erative changes at P180 (Figure 5C), as well as increased germ
cell apoptosis (Figures 5D and 5E; p = 0.01) and significantly
reduced sperm counts (Figure 5G; p < 0.001). That some gPAK
mice experience testicular degeneration rather than tumorigen-
esis suggests that germ cell transformation in this model likely
occurs during a restricted period of embryonic development,
when male germ cells are susceptible to malignant transforma-
tion or when a suitable microenvironment is available to support
tumor growth. Subsequent widespread oncogenic events in
post-natal germ cells (P3 and beyond) initially promote germ
cell hyperproliferation in the postnatal testis, but they ultimately
lead to germ cell death and impaired fertility rather than malig-
nant transformation and tumorigenesis.
gPAK Tumor Cells Are Predominantly Diploid and
Harbor Recurrent DNA Copy Number Aberrations
Aneuploidy is a distinguishing characteristic of most cancers.
Teratomas, however, have been reported to have normal diploid
chromosome numbers (Bussey et al., 1999). To assess chromo-
somal integrity and also determine whether the absence of onco-
gene-induced DNA damage might underlie the lack of DDR
activation seen in human TGCTs (Bartkova et al., 2007a), we per-
formed metaphase chromosome analysis of gPAK teratocarci-
noma cells as well as cells from benign 129-Dnd1Ter/Ter mouse
teratomas. Cells from both tumor types were primarily diploid,
with a mean metaphase chromosome number between 38
and 42, indicating that the increased malignancy of gPAK tumors
is not associated with gross chromosomal instability (Figure S4).
These results are consistent with findings of near-diploid chro-
mosome numbers in cultured mouse teratocarcinoma cells
(Swartzendruber et al., 1976). Thus, if tumorigenesis is associ-
ated with oncogene-induced DNA damage in this model, the
damage must comprise smaller-scale aberrations rather than
gross changes in chromosome number or structure.
To further assess oncogene-induced genomic alterations in
gPAK tumors, we analyzed copy number aberrations via array
comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). As depicted in Fig-
ure S5A and Table S2, gPAK tumors harbored recurrent copy
number gains and losses across the six tumors analyzed,
including events on chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, and X.
A subset of the regions recurrently altered in gPAK tumors
was also altered in 129-Dnd1Ter/Ter tumors (Table S2, right),
such as loss of chromosome (chr)7qA3 (Figure S5B), which
was confirmed in both tumor types by qPCR (Figure S5C).
129-Dnd1Ter/Ter teratomas additionally harbored recurrent copy
number changes on chromosomes 4, 6, 11, and 20 that were
not identified in gPAK tumors (Table S3). Recent genomic ana-
lyses of human TGCT revealed a high frequency of copy-neutral
reciprocal loss-of-heterozygosity events (Taylor-Weiner et al.,
2016), but unfortunately aCGH cannot be used to detect such
events. Analysis of the altered gPAK chromosomal regions via
Panther and Enrichr gene list analysis tools revealed enrichment
for G-protein-coupled receptors (p = 3.45 3 10�21) and recep-
tors (p = 1.79 3 10�11) as well as for genes regulated by partic-
ular transcription factors, most notably SOX2 (33/188 genes,
p = 4.97 3 10�18; Table S4). SOX2 is highly expressed in gPAK
neoplasms, likely reflecting the cell of origin and consistent
with the idea that regions of the genome containing highly ex-
pressed gene clusters are prone to replication-associated chro-
mosome breakage (Barlow et al., 2013).
gPAK TGCTs Are Sensitive to Chemotherapy
TGCTs in humans are exquisitely sensitive to the DNA-damaging
chemotherapeutic cisplatin, which is used routinely as a frontline
drug in combination with bleomycin and etoposide. To deter-
mine whether gPAK TGCTs were also chemosensitive, gPAK
mice were treated intraperitoneally with either two 6-mg/kg
cisplatin doses or a full course of bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin
(BEP) at doses comparable to those used in humans. Cisplatin-
treated gPAK mice lived significantly longer than untreated gPAK
mice (p = 0.0192), with a median survival of 36 days for untreated
mice and 49 days for cisplatin-treated mice (Figure 6A). Two
cisplatin doses were not sufficient to eradicate the tumors, and
treated mice ultimately reached humane endpoint criteria;
however, primary tumor volume at endpoint was significantly
lower in cisplatin-treated gPAK mice than in untreated animals
(p = 0.004; Figure 6B). gPAK mice were even more responsive
to BEP, with several mice surviving to an arbitrary 100-day
endpoint (median survival of 87.5 days; p < 0.001) and primary
tumor volume significantly reduced (p = 0.002). Thus, gPAK
murine TGCTs, similar to their human counterparts, can be effec-
tively treated with chemotherapy, even in the absence of the sur-
gical interventions that typically accompany chemotherapy in
humans.
gPAK CSCs Are Significantly Depleted following
Genotoxic Chemotherapy
To directly test how EC cells respond to chemotherapy in vivo,
we quantified OCT4-expressing cells in gPAK tumors collected
at endpoint from mice treated with cisplatin or BEP. Strikingly,
the percentage of OCT4+ cells was significantly reduced in the
gPAK mice treated with either cisplatin alone or BEP (Figures
6C and 6D; p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). To understand
how the chemosensitivity of OCT4+ EC cells compared with
that of bulk tumor cells, we also stained for SOX17, which is pre-
sent in a subset of non-EC tumor cells. The percentage of
SOX17-positive cells within gPAK TGCTs was not decreased
in response to BEP or cisplatin treatment, in contrast to what
we observed for OCT4+ EC cells (Figures S6 and 6E). We
conclude that TGCT chemosensitivity is specifically linked to
the responsiveness of EC cells to genotoxic chemotherapy.

Cell Reports 21, 1896–1909, November 14, 2017
 Since EC cells are the CSCs of TGCTs, this selective sensitivity
may explain why chemotherapy in humans is more effective
against TGCTs than somatic solid cancers.
To understand the acute responses to chemotherapy in gPAK
TGCTs, tumor-bearing gPAK mice were euthanized at 12 or
48 hr after a single dose of 6 mg/kg cisplatin. Apoptosis was
significantly increased at 12 hr post-treatment (4.5 ± 1.2 [treated]
versus 0.67 ± 0.5 [untreated] apoptotic cells per field, p = 0.0378)
(Figure 7A). Apoptosis appeared to be enriched within OCT4+
clusters, and, by 48 hr, nearly all OCT4+ cell clusters exhibited
altered morphology and reduced cell number. Importantly, this
indicates that the OCT4+ EC cells in gPAK TGCTs are sensitive
to cisplatin-induced DNA damage, which leads to rapid initiation
of apoptosis and elimination of CSCs. Consistent with this
notion, g-H2AX staining was clearly increased in gPAK tumors
at 6 hr post-cisplatin treatment (Figure 7B).
Following chemotherapy, surviving CSCs that are refractory to
treatment can cause tumor recurrence. To determine whether
the reduced amount of EC in gPAK tumors post-treatment corre-
lated with reduced tumor-propagating activity, we compared
tumor formation following transplantation of tumor cells from
treated or untreated gPAK mice. Subcutaneous injection of
10,000 cells from untreated gPAK TGCTs was sufficient to
produce tumors at 75% of injection sites (n = 16; Figure 7C;
Table S5). By contrast, 25,000 gPAK tumor cells transplanted
48 hr post-cisplatin treatment failed to result in tumor formation
in recipient mice (n = 20). Tumor-propagating activity was not
completely eradicated by cisplatin treatment, as transplantation
of 1 million or 100,000 cells from treated gPAK tumors was suf-
ficient for tumor formation, though with much longer latency than
observed for untreated tumor cells (p < 0.005). Limiting dilution
calculations based on these data estimated a frequency of viable
CSCs of 1 in 9,167 tumor cells from untreated gPAK TGCTs,
which likely underestimates the true frequency of the CSCs
due to EC cell death during tumor disaggregation (Table S5).
Notably, cisplatin-treated gPAK TGCTs contained only 1 CSC
in 252,332 tumor cells, signifying a 28-fold reduction in CSC
frequency following treatment. Since a single intact EC cell
is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis (Kleinsmith and Pierce,
1964), these results support the notion that the chemosensitivity
of TGCT CSCs underlies the remarkable curability of TGCTs.
Consistent with this conclusion, OCT4+ EC cells were detected
in 4 of 5 tumors arising from transplants derived from untreated
mice but in none of 4 tumors formed by cells from cisplatin-
treated animals (Table S5).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed a mouse model of malignant TGCT
that, like human TGCTs, exhibits marked chemosensitivity
that is associated with an inherent sensitivity of EC cells, the
CSCs of TGCT, to elimination by conventional genotoxic
chemotherapy. This is in contrast to most CSCs, which are
refractory to treatment and often contribute to disease recur-
rence following initial chemotherapeutic treatment (Visvader
and Lindeman, 2012). This establishes a powerful system for
testing the molecular mechanism underlying the chemosensi-
tivity of these unique CSCs, which we hypothesize is a direct
consequence of germ cells having a distinct DDR compared
to other cell types. Since there are several known determinants
of cisplatin sensitivity, including DNA repair factors, studies of
their roles in EC cells may reveal strategies for sensitizing other
types of cancers with chemoresistant CSCs. The apparent pro-
liferative state of gPAK CSCs may also contribute to their che-
mosensitivity, as quiescence may help CSCs in other tumors
survive genotoxic therapies. Finally, EC cells may be poised
to undergo damage-induced apoptosis due to mitochondrial
priming, which has been observed in human TGCTs (Taylor-
Weiner et al., 2016).
We observed tumors in gPAK mice at birth (P0), indicating that
the tumors most likely do not arise from postnatal initiation
events but rather from rare transformation of embryonic germ
cells. Consistent with this, we were able to detect Stra8-Cre-
mediated recombination in a few small clusters of testicular
germ cells at E12.5, and subsequently we observed only 1–2
neoplasms per testis. It remains unknown whether the embry-
onic Cre expression observed in this model reflects the normal
activity of the Stra8 promoter or is unique to the Stra8-Cre trans-
gene. Male germ cells show endogenous Stra8 mRNA expres-
sion at E13.5 (Heaney et al., 2012), and a small subset of male
germ cells expresses meiotic markers at E14.5 (Yao et al.,
2003), suggesting that Stra8 expression can occur naturally dur-
ing embryonic germ cell development. Regardless, the data sug-
gest that gPAK TGCT initiation occurs in early/mid-embryonic
germ cells, a time point between primordial germ cell (PGC)
arrival at the gonad and the onset of G0 cell-cycle arrest (Busta-
mante-Marı
´n et al., 2013). Notably, teratoma formation in DndTer
mice is associated with a failure of embryonic germ cells to un-
dergo proper mitotic arrest, suggesting that G0 arrest and down-
regulation of pluripotency gene expression at E12.5–E15.5 may
mark the end of the period during which germ cells are parti-
cularly susceptible to malignant transformation (Cook et al.,
2011). Interestingly, Kras and Pten targeting in postnatal germ
cells initially triggered widespread overproliferation, but ulti-
mately it led to cell death and germ cell depletion. Together,
our results suggest that there is a specific developmental win-
dow during which TGCTs can arise (Figure S7). This mimics
the case in humans, where epidemiologic data indicate that
TGCT risk in men is associated with in utero environmental expo-
sures (McGlynn and Cook, 2009). It may be that the microenvi-
ronment in post-natal testes is not conducive to tumor initiation
or that molecular features of germ cells protect against onco-
genic events in adults but allow sustained hyperproliferation at
certain stages of embryogenesis. Interestingly, loss of the pro-
apoptotic gene Bax causes testis hypercellularity soon after
birth, followed by massive cell death at P25, suggesting the

 existence of mechanisms to eliminate excess germ cells from
adult testes (Russell et al., 2002).
It is unclear why Kras activation or Pten inactivation alone is
insufficient to cause germ cell tumorigenesis in the majority of
cases. It has been reported previously that Stra8-Cre-driven
Pten loss does not induce TGCTs or affect fertility (Huang
et al., 2011), although in our studies we did see infrequent TGCTs
as well as germ cell loss with Pten deletion alone, perhaps re-
flecting differences in mouse strain background in these studies.
No TGCTs were observed in mice with Stra8-Cre-driven Kras
activation alone even after 1 year. That Ras activation is insuffi-
cient for oncogenic transformation in germ cells is consistent
with reports that some mouse tissues are more susceptible to
Ras-induced transformation than others. Mice expressing acti-
vated oncogenic Kras in somatic tissues primarily develop lung
cancers as well as oral, gastric, and skin papillomas and thymic
lymphomas, but rarely neoplasms of other tissue origins (Guerra
et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2001). Substantial evidence indicates
that Pten loss and Kras activation can be potent collaborating
events during tumorigenesis, including in ovarian cancer (Mul-
lany et al., 2011), pancreatic cancer (Hill et al., 2010), and mela-
noma (Nogueira et al., 2010). Thus, Pten loss and Kras activation
are functionally non-equivalent, despite their overlapping impact
on key signaling pathways, and in the context of germ cells they
strongly synergize to promote TGCT formation.
The contrasting effects of Pten and Kras alterations in germ
cells may be particularly relevant to their modulation of the germ-
line stem cell pool. Pten inactivation in oocytes promotes prema-
ture activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, causing an
initial surge of follicle maturation that leads to premature ovarian
failure (Reddy et al., 2008). Ras activation in cultured spermato-
gonial stem cells (SSCs), on the other hand, promotes prolifera-
tion and self-renewal rather than differentiation (Lee et al., 2009).
Interestingly, excessive self-renewal triggered by activated Hras
in cultured SSCs led to germ cell tumors upon transplantation
into murine testes. It is possible that the combined Pten inactiva-
tion and Kras activation in our model promote premature cell
division of SSC precursors concomitant with activation of exces-
sive self-renewal signals, leading to the development of germ
cell-derived tumors containing OCT4+ malignant stem cells
(EC cells). Supporting this idea is the fact that Pten-null mouse
pluripotent stem cells cultured in vitro develop into aggressive,
tumorigenic EC cells through increased survival and self-renewal
caused by the loss of Nanog repression (Lindgren et al., 2011).
Many questions remain regarding TGCT biology, most notably
related to the fundamental differences in the cell of origin
between germ cell and somatically derived cancers and the
different molecular mechanisms governing their responses to
oncogenic transformation. In stark contrast to most somatically
derived cancers, early-stage TGCTs in our gPAK mice and hu-
mans (Bartkova et al., 2007b) lack markers of DDR activation
such as gH2AX, despite the fact that TGCTs can mount a robust
DDR to genotoxic chemotherapy. This fundamental difference in
response to oncogene-induced DNA damage may be due to
differential DDR wiring of germ cells versus somatic cells or
dampening of the DDR in pre-meiotic germ cells to allow full
DDR activation following meiotic double-strand break (DSB)
induction, which is absolutely necessary for the completion of
meiosis and production of functional sperm. It remains to be
seen whether germ cells in fact incur as much DNA damage in
response to oncogenic proliferation as do somatic cells, which
would also impact DDR activation. Interestingly, ESCs contain
greater numbers of dormant origins than more differentiated
cells (Ge et al., 2015), and it is conceivable that embryonic
germ cells could use this or related mechanisms to protect
against replication stress that normally accompanies onco-
gene-induced hyperproliferation. Whether the DDR is differen-
tially regulated depending on germ cell developmental stage
also remains to be determined. For instance, whereas embryonic
germ cells do not appear to mount a DDR against oncogenic
events, the germ cell apoptosis associated with oncogenic
events in adult gPAK mice could reflect a DDR triggered by
replication stress associated with the widespread hyperprolifer-
ation observed at P10. Identification of the molecular features
that make TGCT CSCs so sensitive to DNA-damaging chemo-
therapeutics may yield broadly applicable biomarkers for che-
mosensitivity or chemoresistance and provide avenues for the
development of more effective therapies for other cancers by
targeting their more deadly, chemoresistant CSCs.
