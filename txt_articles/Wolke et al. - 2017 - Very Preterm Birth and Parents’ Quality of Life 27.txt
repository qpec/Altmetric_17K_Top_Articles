BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Parents of preterm children experience increased distress early 
in their children’s lives. Whether the quality of life of parents of preterm children is 
comparable to that of parents of term children by the time their offspring reach adulthood 
is unknown. What precursors in their offspring’s childhood predict parental quality of life?
METHODS: A prospective whole-population study in Germany followed very preterm (VP) 
(<32 weeks gestation) or very low birth weight (VLBW) (<1500 g) (N = 250) and term-born 
individuals (N = 230) and their parents (VP or VLBW: N = 219; term: N = 227) from birth 
to adulthood. Parental quality of life was evaluated with the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life assessment and the Satisfaction with Life questionnaire when their offspring 
were adults (mean age 27.3 years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.2 to 27.3). Childhood 
standard assessments of VP or VLBW and term offspring included neurosensory disability, 
academic achievement, mental health, and parent-child and peer relationships.
RESULTS: Overall quality of life of parents of VP or VLBW adults was found to be comparable 
to parents of term individuals (P > .05). Parental quality of life was not predicted by their 
children being born VP or VLBW, experiencing disability, academic achievement, or the 
parent-child relationship in childhood but by their offspring’s mental health (B = 0.15, 95% 
CI: 0.08 to 0.22) and peer relationships (B = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.16) in childhood.
CONCLUSIONS: As a testament to resilience, parents of VP or VLBW adults had quality of life 
comparable to parents of term adults. Support and interventions to improve mental health 
and peer relationships in all children are likely to improve parents’ quality of life.

WhAt’S KNOWN ON thIS SUbjECt: Very preterm 
birth is associated with increased disability and 
schooling problems. Parents of preterm children are 
more stressed in the first year after preterm birth 
and report more burden still when their preterm 
children reach adolescence.
WhAt thIS StUDy ADDS: Parents of preterm adults 
do not consider their quality of life to be poorer than 
those of term adults. Poor child–peer relationships 
and mental health problems, but not prematurity or 
disability, predict poorer parental quality of life in 
the long-term.

 Being born very preterm (VP) 
or with very low birth weight 
(VLBW) is associated with a highly 
increased risk of mortality, neonatal 
complications, long-term morbidity, 
1  
and higher costs.2 Medical 
achievements, such as more children 
surviving with chronic conditions, 
may have hidden consequences 
for health and the quality of life 
of parents.3 Having a child born 
VP or VLBW increases parental 
stress and mental illness symptoms 
during the first 7 years of life.4 
– 
8 The 
neonatal difficulties that the children 
encounter7, 
9 and their physical, 
emotional, and social problems have 
been reported to mediate the link 
between preterm birth and parental 
stress.10
There is increasing evidence that 
motor, 
11 cognitive, 
12 and mental 
health problems13 after VP or VLBW 
birth persist into adulthood. Adults 
born VP or VLBW are less likely 
to live independently, more often 
receive social benefits, more often 
have periods of unemployment, and 
are less likely to find a romantic 
partner14, 
15 than term-born controls. 
Thus, their transition into adulthood 
is more challenging and their self-
reported quality of life is lower than 
those of term adults.16 These long-
term consequences of VP or VLBW 
birth may also affect the quality of 
life of their parents even when the 
offspring are adults.
To date, only a few researchers have 
investigated parental psychological 
distress and burden as their VP or 
VLBW offspring transitioned into 
adolescence. Some found continued 
higher family burden and stress17, 
 
18  
and adverse effects on parents’ 
emotional functioning.19 Those 
parents who had adolescents with 
significant developmental difficulties 
reported being more burdened 
and stressed.17 Researchers in only 
1 study to date followed VLBW 
and control parents when their 
children reached adulthood. They 
found that differences in burden 
had ameliorated by adulthood, but 
it had curtailed the parents’ job 
opportunities.20 Although there 
is some indication that burden 
continues for parents of VP or 
VLBW at least into adolescence, 
there is complete paucity of findings 
on the parents’ quality of life and 
life satisfaction when their VP or 
VLBW children reach adulthood. 
Which developmental difficulties 
in childhood may affect parental 
quality of life in the long-term is also 
unknown. However, this information 
is important to evaluate the full range 
of consequences of VP or VLBW birth, 
to direct resources appropriately, 
and to counsel parents about the 
long-term effects of VP or VLBW birth 
on their lives.21
Our aims with this prospective cohort 
study were to assess the quality of 
life of parents of adults who were 
born VP or VLBW compared with 
parents of term offspring and to 
investigate what factors in childhood 
predict the quality of life of parents of 
VP or VLBW and term offspring when 
they reach adulthood.

Study Design and Participants
The Bavarian Longitudinal Study is a 
geographically defined, prospective 
whole-population study of VP and 
VLBW and term individuals in 
Germany born between January 1985 
and March 1986.12 The offspring  
and parents (major caretakers) of 
VP and VLBW (mothers: N = 192, 
fathers: N = 27) and term controls 
(mothers: N = 212, fathers: N = 15) 
were assessed 7 times since the birth 
of their offspring. For this study, 
parents were contacted and asked to 
fill in questionnaires on their quality 
of life and life satisfaction when the 
young adults were ∼27 years of age 
(mean age 27.3, 95% confidence  
interval [CI]: 27.2 to 27.3). In total, 
data on parents’ quality of life and 
life satisfaction were available for 
446 parents (VP and VLBW: 219 
parents of 250 offspring (because  
of multiple births); term controls: 
227 parents of 230 offspring)  
(Fig 1). Ethical approval for this study 
was granted by the Ethical Board 
of the University Hospital Bonn, 
Germany (reference # 159/09). 
Parents gave fully informed, written 
consent for their participation and 
the participation of their children 
in childhood. Adolescents (13-year 
assessment) gave their own written 
consent to participation.
Measures
Parental Quality of Life
The German version of the World 
Health Organization Quality of Life 
instrument, Short Edition (WHOQoL-
BREF)22, 
 
23 was administered to assess 
parental quality of life. The WHOQoL-
BREF has excellent validity, 
22 is 
composed of 26 items, and assesses 
quality of life profiles across the 
following 4 domains: physical health 
(7 items), psychological health (6 
items, eg, “How often do you have 
negative feelings such as blue mood, 
despair, anxiety, depression?”), 
social relationships (3 items, eg, 
“How satisfied are you with your 
personal relationships?”), and 
environment (8 items). In addition, a 
global assessment of an individual’s 
perception of his or her quality of 
life and general health is computed 
(2 items, eg, “How would you rate 
your quality of life?”). The raw 
scores of the WHOQoL-BREF were 
transformed into scores ranging 
between 0 and 100, with a higher 
score denoting higher quality of life 
(VP and VLBW parents Cronbach’s 
α [term control parents in brackets]: 
physical = 0.81 [0.85], psychological =  
0.79 [0.74], social relationships = 
0.64 [0.66], environment = 0.76 
[0.74], and global = 0.70 [0.65]).
Parents then answered the 5-item 
Satisfaction with Life Scale, 
24 which 
is also reported to have high validity 
and reliability.25, 
 
26 The items were 
as follows: “In most ways my life is 
close to my ideal,

 my life are excellent, 
” “I am satisfied 
with my life, 
” “So far I have gotten the 
important things I want in life, 
” and 
“If I could live my life over, I would 
change almost nothing.” Items are 
rated on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly 
agree to 7 = strongly disagree) 
and summarized into a global life 
satisfaction score (VP and VLBW 
parents: Cronbach’s α = 0.91; term 
control parents: Cronbach’s α = 0.90).
The global life satisfaction score, the 
4 WHOQoL domain scores, and the 
global score of quality of life were 
highly correlated (r = 0.42–0.75). To 
avoid inflation of significant results 
by using multiple individual domain 
comparisons, the 5 WHOQoL and 
the Satisfaction with Life Scale were 
entered into a confirmatory factor 
analysis by using Mplus version 7.3, 
27 
 
yielding a single overall parental 
quality of life score (factor loadings 
shown in Supplemental Table 4). 
The standardized factor score, which 
represent overall parental quality of 
life, was retrieved.
Assessment of Child Functioning
Child functioning in 5 areas was 
assessed with multiple measures 
during childhood. Supplemental 
Tables 5 and 6 provide fully 
referenced and detailed descriptions 
of all measures.
Disability in childhood was defined 
as having cerebral palsy, blindness, 
noncorrected hearing problems, 
motor problems, or cognitive 
impairment at the ages of 6 or 8 
years.
Mental health was measured 
with parental reports in the Child 
Behavior Checklist at 6 and 8 years 
and parental and child reports 
in the Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire at 13 years (4 
measures).
Academic achievement measures 
included the Kaufman Assessment 
Battery for Children achievement 
subtest at 6 and 8 years; tests of 
mathematics, reading, and spelling at 
8 years; and child school success at 
13 years (6 measures).
Parent-child relationship was 
assessed with nurses’ observations 
of parenting neonatally and 
observations of maternal sensitivity 
at 6 and 8 years (3 measures).
Peer relationships were measured 
by using parental and child reports 
of the number of friends they have 
during interviews at 6 and 8 years 
and parental and child reports of the 
quality of peer relationships, which 
were assessed with the Pictorial  
Scale of Perceived Competence and 
Social Acceptance, at 6 and 8 years  
(8 measures).
To obtain domain scores of mental 
health, academic achievement, peer 
relationships, and parent-child 
relationships from the various 
childhood measures, we performed 
confirmatory factor analysis for 
each domain using Mplus version 
7.3.27 Measures were used as 
factor indicators, and standardized 
factor scores for each of the 4 child 
functioning domains were retrieved. 
All factor loadings >0.3 were included 
(see Supplemental Table 7).
Potential Confounders
The following variables were 
considered as potential confounders: 
parental sex; family socioeconomic 
status at birth classified as low, 
middle, and high28; maternal major 
depression diagnosed according to 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition at 
629 or 8 years; maternal age; marital 
status at birth; and multiple births.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted by using 
SPSS version 22. Differences between 
parents of VP and VLBW and term 
control adults and between offspring 
groups were tested with a t test or 
χ2 test. Multiple comparisons were 
Bonferroni adjusted.
To predict overall parental quality 
of life, VP or VLBW birth, child 
disability, and the domain scores 
for mental health, academic 
achievement, parent-child 
relationship, and peer relationships 
were entered in univariate regression 
analyses. For parents with multiple 
births, mean child functioning 
domain scores were used. Disability

the multiples had a disability. 
Subsequently, to examine which 
child functioning domains were most 
strongly associated with the outcome, 
all child functioning domains and 
potential confounders were entered 
simultaneously in the regression 
model.
Regression analyses were repeated 
separately for the 6 original parental 
quality of life outcome scores.
RESULtS
Family Demographics and Child 
Functioning
Participating parents of VP and 
VLBW adults were more often 
fathers compared with parents of 
term adults (Table 1). More fathers 
of VP or VLBW adults were divorced 
or widowed than fathers of term 
controls. Parents of VP and VLBW 
individuals less often had a high 
socioeconomic status than parents 
of term individuals. No group 
differences were found for current 
paternal age, maternal age, or marital 
status at birth. Maternal clinical 
depression during their offspring’s 
childhood was more frequent for 
parents of term controls.
By definition, VP and VLBW offspring 
were born with lower gestational 
ages and birth weight and were 
more often multiple births than term 
controls, but no group differences 
were found with regard to sex. In 
childhood, VP and VLBW offspring 
had more disabilities, more mental 
health problems, lower academic 
achievement, and worse parent-child 
and peer relationships than term-
born comparisons (Table 1).
Participants Compared With those 
Lost to Follow-up
Participating parents of VP and 
VLBW adults did not differ from 
parents of VP and VLBW who 
dropped out in terms of maternal and 
paternal age at birth and maternal 
depression when their children were 
aged 6 or 8 years (Supplemental 
Table 8). However, dropouts were 
more often socially disadvantaged 
(low family socioeconomic status: 
48.0% vs 30.3%, P = .002) and less 
often married or cohabiting with a 
partner at the time of birth of their 
children (87.3% vs 94.3%, P = .019).
Participating parents of term control 
adults were not different regarding 
marital status at birth or maternal 
depression at 6 or 8 years compared 
with dropout term parents. Parents 
of term control adults who dropped 
out, however, were more often 
socially disadvantaged (low family 
socioeconomic status: 44.9% vs 
25.6%, P = .002) and younger at the 
time of birth of their children (mean 
maternal age: 27.2 years [95% CI: 
26.0 to 28.4] vs 29.1 years [95% CI: 
28.5 to 29.7]; mean paternal age: 30.5 
years [95% CI: 29.1 to 31.8] vs 32.4 
years [95% CI: 31.6 to 33.2]).

Downloaded from 
 VP and VLBW offspring did not 
differ in terms of sex, gestational 
age, and birth weight from dropouts 
(Supplemental Table 8). Dropout 
VP and VLBW adults were less often 
multiples compared with VP and 
VLBW who participated (18.6% vs 
29.2%, P = .016).
No differences were found between 
term offspring and dropouts.
Parental Quality of Life and their 
Offspring’s Childhood Functioning
The overall Quality of Life factor 
score of parents of VP and VLBW and 
term offspring was not different (VP 
and VLBW: mean standardized factor 
score −0.02 [95% CI: −0.13 to 0.08], 
term controls: mean standardized 
factor score 0.02 [95% CI: −0.07 to 
0.12], P > .05) (Fig 2). Table 2 shows 
the individual scale scores. There 
were no group differences for the 4 
quality of life domain scores, global 
life satisfaction, global score of 
quality of life, and health perception 
(Bonferroni corrected P > .008). 
Because there were more fathers in 
the VP and VLBW group, we repeated 
analysis using a 2 × 2 analysis 
of variance with parent sex and 
prematurity as factors. The Quality 
of Life factor score did not differ 
according to parent sex, prematurity 
and the interaction effect of parent 
sex X prematurity was also not 
significant (overall model: degrees of 
freedom (3); F = 0.79; P = .50).
Of the 5 childhood domains of 
functioning, better mental health 
and better peer relationships 
in childhood were consistently 
predictive of higher overall parental 
Quality of Life factor scores in 
unadjusted and adjusted analyses 
(Table 3). Detailed analyses of the 
5 WHOQoL and the Life Satisfaction 
scales are shown in Supplemental 
Table 9.
DISCUSSION
We found that the quality of life of 
parents of VP and VLBW offspring 
who had reached adulthood was  
not different from that of parents  
of term children. We also showed 
that, in offspring, better mental 
health and peer relationships 
in childhood (independently of 
whether they were born VP or 
VLBW or term) still predicted 
parents’ quality of life more than  
a decade later.
VP and VLBW children more often 
experience disability, 
30 mental 
health31 and academic achievement 
problems, 
32 and poorer peer 
relationships33, 
34 in childhood 
than those born at term. This was 
confirmed in this prospective study 
of a geographically defined sample 
in Germany (Table 1). Despite 
the increased stress in the initial 
years8, 
 
9 and the challenges faced 
by parents of VP and VLBW adults, 
who are still more likely to have

Downloaded from 
 those of parents of term adults is a 
testament to their resilience. The 
findings are similar to the only 
other study of extremely low birth 
weight parents compared with term 
controls20 in Canada, which detected 
no differences in maternal health 
and functioning. It suggests that in 
countries with universal access to 
health care, such as Germany and 
Canada, despite other cultural and 
educational differences, parents of 
VP and VLBW children on average 
show remarkable ability to cope 
with the challenges presented to 
them.
Furthermore, consistent with the 
study by Saigal et al, 
20 we found 
that disability (despite the many 
sacrifices parents had to make to 
care for their disabled children) 
did not reduce the quality of life 
of parents when their offspring 
became adults. Similarly, academic 
performance in childhood and 
parent-child relationships did not 
predict parents’ quality of life more 
than a decade later.
In contrast, poorer mental health 
and poor peer relationships 
in childhood predicted lower 
quality of life of parents. In other 
words, parents feel better about 
themselves and their relationships 
when their offspring had friends 
and were happy during childhood. 
This is likely to be due to the long-
term adverse effects that both 
childhood mental health problems 
and social relationships can have 
on adult functioning. Both mental 
health problems, even when they 
are subclinical, 
36, 
 
37 and being 
bullied, socially excluded, and 
without friends38 have been shown 
to have long-lasting effects on 
adult adaptation, such as social 
relationships, partnering, wealth, 
and independent living. These affect 
the health-related quality of life 
of adults born VP or VLBW or at 
term16 and are also reducing the 
quality of life of parents, as shown 
here.
This study has a range of strengths, 
the most important being the long-
term follow-up of a large whole-
population sample of VP and VLBW 
and term individuals recruited in the 
same obstetric hospitals and the use 
of reliable and valid tests to assess 
a range of childhood functions and 
parental quality of life over  
27 years.
There are also limitations. First, 
although 66% of the eligible VP and 
VLBW and term parents participated 
at 27 years, the dropout was not 
random. This is found in many 
longitudinal studies, 
39 but VP 
and VLBW or term offspring who 
participated or dropped out did not 
differ in neonatal characteristics. 
We controlled for factors that were 
found to differ between parents who 
dropped out and stayed or found 
to differ between participating VP 
and VLBW and control parents. 
Simulations have further shown 
that even when dropout is selective 
or correlated with the outcome of 
interest, regression functions may 
alter only marginally40 but cannot be 
excluded.
CONCLUSIONS
Twenty-seven years after birth, 
parents of VP and VLBW adults have 
similar quality of life as parents 
of term adults. This is a testament 
to resilience, adaptability, and 
coping, and it reveals important 
new information for counseling of 
parents of VP and VLBW children 
dealing with disability and schooling 
problems in childhood. Parents’ 
quality of life was mainly affected 
by their offspring’s mental health 
and relationships with peers in 
childhood rather than by their 
children being born VP or VLBW, 
having disabilities, or poor 
school performance. Support and 
interventions to improve mental 
health and peer relationships  
in all children is likely to positively 
affect both the children as  
they grow up and the parents’ 
quality of life and may reduce 
health-related costs.
Future researchers of very preterm 
children may want to include similar 
parental quality of life outcome 
measures to allow for comparisons 
across different samples to 
determine if the findings reported 
here are specific to variations 
of neonatal treatment, social 
conditions in countries, or health
