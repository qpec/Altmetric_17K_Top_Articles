THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE
Federally Qualified Health Center
Clinicians And Staff Increasingly
Dissatisfied With Workplace
Conditions
ABSTRACT Better working conditions for clinicians and staff could help
primary care practices implement delivery system innovations and help
sustain the US primary care workforce. Using longitudinal surveys, we
assessed the experience of clinicians and staff in 296 clinical sites that
participated in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Advanced Primary Care Practice
Demonstration. Participating FQHCs were expected to achieve,
within three years, patient-centered medical home recognition at
level 3—the highest level possible. During 2013–14, clinicians and staff in
these FQHCs reported statistically significant declines in multiple
measures of professional satisfaction, work environment, and practice
culture. There were no significant improvements on any surveyed
measure. These findings suggest that working conditions in FQHCs have
deteriorated recently. Whether findings would be similar in other primary
care practices is unknown. Although we did not identify the causes of
these declines, possible stressors include the adoption of health
information technology, practice transformation, and increased demand
for services.
B
etter working conditions, which
are inherently important to prima-
ry care clinicians and staff, could
also help practices implement de-
livery system innovations and help
sustain the US primary care workforce.1 In the
past decade, primary care practices in the United
States have been exposed to multiple health
system changes that could affect their working
conditions. These changes include incentives to
adopt electronic health records (EHRs), expo-
sure to alternative payment models, and efforts
to encourage practice transformation (for exam-
ple, via medical home recognition programs).2–8
Each of these health system changes has the
potential to improve or worsen working condi-
tions in primary care. Though medical home
initiatives might improve professional satisfac-
tion,9 practice transformation can involve sub-
stantial changes to roles, responsibilities, and
workflows within primary care practices. Such
changes canbe stressful and have the potentialto
worsen working conditions for clinicians and
staff, especially in the short term.1,10 Similarly,
adopting EHRs can have complex effects; clini-
cians report appreciating some EHR features
(such as the ability to access information remote-
ly) but loathing others (such as distraction
from face-to-face patient care).5,11 The effects of
alternative payment models and other system

 changes on primary care working conditions
have not been evaluated quantitatively, but qual-
itative research points to a mixed picture.6
Because of resource constraints owingto payer
mix, safety-net practices such as federally quali-
fied health centers (FQHCs) may be especially
vulnerable to the stresses of practice transforma-
tion, technology adoption, and realignment of
financial incentives.12,13 At the same time, safety-
net practices such as FQHCs may be especially
resilient in responding to these stresses because
of their greater prior experience with EHRs,
team-based care, and other capabilities such as
enhanced payments via Health Resources and
Services Administration grants and cost-based
Medicaid reimbursement, compared to non-
safety-net practices.14–16 In this study we evaluat-
ed longitudinal changes in professional satisfac-
tion, work environment, and practice culture
within a national sample of FQHCs.
Study Data And Methods
Setting We sampled all 503 federally qualified
health center sites that participated in the Cen-
ters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Demon-
stration, which ran from 2011 to 2014.17 Three of
these sites were replacements for sites that
dropped out in the first few months of the dem-
onstration; there were never more than 500
FQHC sites participating in the demonstration
at any one time. The 503 participating sites
represented 271 unique FQHCs, which can be
multisite organizations.
As described elsewhere, participating FQHCs
were expected, by the end of the demonstration,
to achieve patient-centered medical home recog-
nition at level 3—the highest level possible—
under the 2011 criteria for National Committee
for Quality Assurance recognition.17 The demon-
stration required participating FQHC sites to do
so within three years; 70 percent achieved
this goal.
Survey Design And Scoring Building on
previously published surveys, we designed and
cognitively tested one instrument for clinicians
(physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician
assistants) and a second closely related instru-
ment for other staff (nurses, medical assistants,
and technicians). These survey instruments as-
sessed three measures of professional satisfac-
tion (overall satisfaction, burnout, and intent to
leave), five measures of work environment
(work control, stress, time pressure, practice at-
mosphere, and top-of-license activity), and thir-
teen measures of practice culture (for example,
adaptive reserve and communication open-
ness).18–21
To facilitate interpretation, we dichotomized
responses to the single-item variables following
preexisting convention, at a conceptually intui-
tive threshold or at a threshold that produced the
most even split (when there was no preexisting
or intuitive threshold). For example, we counted
“agree” and “strongly agree” responses to the
item “Overall, I am satisfied with my current
job” as indicating overall satisfaction, following
the convention of the source instrument.22 For
the continuous variables (a subset of work envi-
ronment measures and all measures of practice
culture), we calculated standardized scores by
dividing each raw score by its standard deviation.
The exact wording, scoring details, and sources
of all survey items are described in online Appen-
dix Exhibit 1.23
Survey Sample And Administration We ob-
tained names and work addresses for all clini-
cians and staff members who worked at least
thirty hours per week in sites participating in
the FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Dem-
onstration. We then fielded the surveys in an
early wave (April–August 2013) to three clini-
cians and three staff members selected at ran-
dom from each site. Some sites had fewer than
six eligible respondents, and we reallocated
excess survey opportunities from these small-
sample sites to sites with larger staffs. Overall,
we sent early-wave surveys to 1,496 clinicians
and 1,515 staff members. Of these, 1,277 re-
sponded (42 percent response rate), represent-
ing 440 of the 503 participating sites from 259
unique FQHCs.
We then fielded a late survey wave (June–
October 2014) to all clinicians and staff who
had completed the baseline survey, after exclud-
ing respondents who had left their clinics. Of the
1,068 clinicians and staff eligible for the follow-
up survey, 564 responded (236 clinicians and
328 staff; 53 percent response rate), represent-
ing 296 sites from 202 unique FQHCs.
The early-wave survey was fielded via mail on-
ly, but online completion was available for the
late-wave survey. There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between mailed (n = 454)
and online (n = 110) responses for any sur-
vey item.
Other Site Characteristics We obtained
data on sites’ baseline use of EHRs, provision
of after-hours care, and prior medical home cer-
tification (from any source) from their applica-
tions to participate in the demonstration. For
each FQHC, the Health Resources and Services
Administration supplied data on participation in
its Patient-Centered Medical Home Recognition
Initiative (which covers the cost of applying for
recognition), annual revenue, and the number of
affiliated clinical sites (because each FQHC can

 have multiple sites).We also obtained data from
the National Committee for Quality Assurance
on the end-of-demonstration medical home rec-
ognition levels (or lack of such recognition) for
all 503 participating sites.
Using Medicare claims, we also calculated
characteristics of each site’s attributed popula-
tion at baseline: percentage female, percentage
disabled, and mean Medicare Hierarchical Con-
dition Category risk-adjustment score.24 We esti-
mated the poverty rate within each site’s census
tract from the American Community Survey five-
year aggregated file (2005–09).
Analysis We evaluated changes over time in
working conditions among clinicians and staff
members who responded to both survey waves.
To do this, we fitted single-difference regression
models for each measure of working conditions
in which the main predictor was the survey wave
(early versus late).
In all models, we used nonresponse weights;
robust standard error estimates to account for
nonindependence of observations within sites;
functional forms appropriate to each dependent
variable (linear regression for continuous mea-
sures and logistic regression for dichotomized
measures); and covariates to control for survey
version (clinician versus staff), baseline site
characteristics (EHR use, after-hours care, prior
medical home certification, participation in the
Health Resources and Services Administration’s
Patient-Centered Medical Home Recognition
Initiative, number of sites affiliated with the
FQHC, total revenue), patient population char-
acteristics (sex, disability, Hierarchical Condi-
tion Category score), and local-area poverty.
We then repeated these models separately for
clinicians and staff.
We used SAS 9.4 for data management and
analysis. RAND’s Human Subjects Protection
Committee approved this study.
Limitations Our study had limitations. First,
despite applying weights to account for survey
nonresponse, our modest response rates could
have biased our results. Second, the early survey
was fielded eighteen months into the medical
home intervention. It is possible that results
would be different if the survey had been fielded
closer to the beginning of the demonstration.
Third, our study was limited to FQHCs, so our
findings might not apply to other types of prima-
ry care practices. Finally, we did not analyze re-
lationships between FQHC working conditions
and patient outcomes.
Study Results
Survey respondents and nonrespondents repre-
sented federally qualified health center sites
that had similar baseline characteristics and that
served generally similar patient populations
(Exhibit 1). However, respondents’ sites served
a smaller proportion of disabled Medicare bene-
ficiaries (52.7 percent versus 54.3 percent for
nonrespondents). Respondents were less likely
than nonrespondents to be clinicians (41.8 per-
cent versus 51.5 percent).
All three measures of professional satisfaction
worsenedsignificantlyover time(Exhibit 2)(full
versions of Exhibits 2–4, with confidence inter-
vals, are in the online Appendix).23 Overall satis-
faction rates declined from 84.2 percent in
the early wave to 74.4 percent in the late wave.
Rates of burnout increased from 23.0 percent to
31.5 percent. The proportion of respondents
reporting that they were likely to leave their prac-
tices within two years increased from 29.3 per-
cent to 38.2 percent.
Three of five work environment measures
worsened significantly over time, with adjusted
standardized differences of −8.3 percent for
work control and −11.2 percent for low-stress
environment (Exhibit 3). The proportion of
respondents reporting a hectic/chaotic practice
atmosphere increased from 31.6 percent in the
early wave to 40.1 percent in the late wave. There
were no statistically significant changes in top-
of-license activity for any of the four types of
practice staff or in time pressure during visits
with new, established, or urgent care patients.
Twelve of thirteen practice culture measures
worsenedsignificantlyover time(Exhibit 4).The
greatest adjusted standardized declines were for
teamwork, at −26.4 percent and facilitative lead-
ership, at −23.3 percent. Only values alignment
did not exhibit a significant change over time.
Analyses stratified by clinicians versus staff
showed similar findings to the main analyses
in both subgroups on nearly all measures, as
shown in Appendix Exhibits 2–4.23
Discussion
We found statistically significant declines in
most measures of professional satisfaction, work
environment, and practice culture among clini-
cians and staff in a national sample of federally
qualified health center sites. Our study did not
identify the causes of these declines, but there
are several possibilities. For example, rapid
adoption of new EHRs (which can disrupt prac-
tice workflow and distract from face-to-face
care), expansion of coverage under the Afford-
able Care Act (which may have caused a demand
surge for many clinics), and medical home trans-
formation (whether spurred by the CMS FQHC
Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration
or other initiatives) all could have stressed FQHC

SOURCE Authors’ own analyses. NOTES The early wave was conducted during April–August 2013. The late wave was conducted during June–October 2014, repeating the
survey with clinicians and staff who had completed the early-wave survey. Adjusted standardized differences are the adjusted differences divided by the standard
deviation of the corresponding measure. Top-of-license scores were calculated separately for respondents in each of the four categories of respondents shown.
Within each respondent category, these scores were based on responses to the question: “In a typical day at the practice, how often do you do the following
activities?” The response options for each of sixteen activities ranged in required expertise from “checking in and orienting patients” to “evaluating patients and
making treatment decisions.” Responses were on a four-point scale: 1 (never) to 4 (frequently). Separately for each of the four staff categories, each of the sixteen
activities was rated as “top of license,” “probably below license,” and “definitely below license.” A composite top-of-license score was created by adding one point
for each “top of license” activity reported as being performed “sometimes” or “frequently” and subtracting one point for each “definitely below license” activity
reported as being performed “sometimes” or “frequently.” This composite could take values between −7 and +3 for physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), and
physician assistants (PAs); −2 to +3 for nurses; −3 to +4 for educators; and 0 to +5 for clerks. A full version of this exhibit, including confidence intervals, is in

 clinicians and staff members.1,5,10,25
Though our sample of FQHCs was drawn from
those participating in the demonstration, our
analyses could not determine whether the
changes we observed were attributable to partic-
ipation in the demonstration.We were unable to
survey clinicians and staff in comparison FQHCs
or non-FQHC primary care clinics. Without a
comparison group, any effects of the demonstra-
tion are not distinguishable from factors that
might affect working conditions across FQHCs
inside and outside the demonstration, such as
incentives to adopt EHRs.
Our findings are consistent with reports of
increasing burnout and declining professional
satisfaction among physicians across the United
States, not just in safety-net clinics.26 However,
they differ with the only assessment of longitu-
dinal changes in provider experience during a
medical home initiative published to our knowl-
edge, in which transformation within a single
Group Health Cooperative site was associated
with improvements in providerburnout between
2006 and 2008.9,27 This discrepancy might be
explained by differences in time frame, type of
clinic (FQHC versus integrated system), and in-
tervention design (the Group Health pilot was
motivated by and designed to mitigate provider
burnout). Moreover, some FQHCs have high
staff turnover, and most serve patients with com-
plex medical, behavioral, and social needs—
which can make practice transformation more
difficult.13 The finding that top-of-license scores
did not improve suggests that many FQHCs in
our sample may have transformed only to a mod-
est extent. Applying for and receiving medical
home recognition could have been a higher pri-
ority than transformation. In addition, when
safety-netclinicshaveinsufficient staffinglevels,
this can increase the risk of burnout associated
with quality improvement efforts.28
We observed simultaneous, similar changes
in multiple measures of working conditions—a
result consistent with previous studies docu-
menting strong associations between measures
of clinician and staff experience, job satisfaction,
and work environments in safety-net clinics.29–31
Taken together, these findings suggest that
professional satisfaction, work experience, and
clinic culture are likely to change in unison.
Conclusion
Clinicians and other staff members working in
a national sample of federally qualified health
center sites reported declines over time in mul-
tiple measures of professional satisfaction, work
environment, and practice culture. Our analysis
could not identify the factors contributing to
these declines. However, as additional health
system changes accumulate under the Medicare
Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2016
and new legislative and regulatory activity, poli-
cy makers should consider further study of how
these forces could affect primary care working
conditions—especially in FQHCs and other safe-
ty-net clinics. ▪
