Survival of HIV-positive patients starting antiretroviral 
therapy between 1996 and 2013: a collaborative analysis of 
cohort studies
The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration*
Summary
Background Health care for people living with HIV has improved substantially in the past two decades. Robust 
estimates of how these improvements have affected prognosis and life expectancy are of utmost importance to 
patients, clinicians, and health-care planners. We examined changes in 3 year survival and life expectancy of patients 
starting combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 1996 and 2013.
Methods We analysed data from 18 European and North American HIV-1 cohorts. Patients (aged ≥16 years) were 
eligible for this analysis if they had started ART with three or more drugs between 1996 and 2010 and had at least 
3 years of potential follow-up. We estimated adjusted (for age, sex, AIDS, risk group, CD4 cell count, and HIV-1 RNA 
at start of ART) all-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for the first year after ART initiation and the 
second and third years after ART initiation in four calendar periods (1996–99, 2000–03 [comparator], 2004–07, 
2008–10). We estimated life expectancy by calendar period of initiation of ART.
Findings 88 504 patients were included in our analyses, of whom 2106 died during the first year of ART and 2302 died 
during the second or third year of ART. Patients starting ART in 2008–10 had lower all-cause mortality in the first year 
after ART initiation than did patients starting ART in 2000–03 (adjusted HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·61–0·83). All-cause 
mortality in the second and third years after initiation of ART was also lower in patients who started ART in 2008–10 
than in those who started in 2000–03 (0·57, 0·49–0·67); this decrease was not fully explained by viral load and CD4 cell 
count at 1 year. Rates of non-AIDS deaths were lower in patients who started ART in 2008–10 (vs 2000–03) in the 
first year (0·48, 0·34–0·67) and second and third years (0·29, 0·21–0·40) after initiation of ART. Between 1996 and 2010, 
life expectancy in 20-year-old patients starting ART increased by about 9 years in women and 10 years in men.
Interpretation Even in the late ART era, survival during the first 3 years of ART continues to improve, which probably 
reflects transition to less toxic antiretroviral drugs, improved adherence, prophylactic measures, and management of 
comorbidity. Prognostic models and life expectancy estimates should be updated to account for these improvements.

Introduction
For 20 years, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has 
been the standard approach to treating HIV-1 infection in 
Europe and North America. The first ART regimens were 
inferior to those currently available, which better suppress 
HIV replication, are less toxic, and have higher genetic 
barriers to resistance, reduced pill burden (often one a 
day), and fewer side-effects.1,2 Other improvements in 
health care since 1996 for people living with HIV include 
treatment and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections 
and manage 
ment of co 
morbidities.3 Improvements in 
intensive care manage 
ment, disease screening, and health 
promotion might also have improved prognosis. Therefore, 
people living with HIV who started ART more recently 
might have improved survival compared with those treated 
earlier in the ART era.
The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration 
(ART-CC) previously reported that despite improvements 
in virological response to ART, mortality 1 year after 
initiation of ART did not decrease between 1998 and 2003.4 
This absence of improvement in survival might have 
been related to changes in patients’ characteristics: 
increasing numbers were from areas with a high 
prevalence of tuberculosis infection.4 Some studies have 
reported improvements in overall survival and changing 
causes of death, with proportionately fewer AIDS-related 
deaths in more recent years,5–9 but none has investigated 
trends in prognosis after starting ART by calendar period. 
We examined changes in all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality in the first 3 years of ART during 1996–2013, 
and investigated trends in life expectancy.
Methods
Participants
We combined data from 18 European and North American 
HIV cohorts participating in ART-CC, which includes ART-
naive people living with HIV aged 16 years or older who 
started treatment with three or more antiretroviral drugs

between 1996 and 2010.10 Cohorts were approved by ethics 
committees or institutional review boards, used standard-
ised data collection methods, and scheduled follow-up 
visits at least every 6 months. Cohorts included in this 
paper were the French Hospital Database on HIV (FHDH); 
the Italian Cohort of Antiretroviral-naive patients (ICONA); 
the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS); the AIDS Therapy 
Evaluation project, Netherlands (ATHENA); the Multicenter 
Study Group on EuroSIDA; the Aquitaine Cohort, France; 
the Royal Free Hospital Cohort, UK; the South Alberta 
Clinic Cohort, Canada; the Danish HIV Cohort Study, 
Denmark; HAART Observational Medical Evaluation and 
Research (HOMER) Cohort, Canada; HIV Atlanta Veterans 
Affairs Cohort Study (HAVACS), USA; Osterreichische 
HIV-Kohortenstudie (OEHIVKOS), Austria; Proyecto para 
la Informatizacion del Seguimiento Clinico-epidemiologico 
de la Infeccion por HIV y SIDA (PISCIS), Spain; University 
of Washington HIV Cohort, USA; VACH, Spain; Veterans 
Aging Cohort Study (VACS), USA; Vanderbilt, USA; and 
the Koln/Bonn Cohort, Germany.
Eligible patients started ART at least 3 years before the 
cohort-specific database close date, which varied from 
May 31, 2012, to July 31, 2013, and had a baseline CD4 cell 
count measured within a window 3 months before until 
2 weeks after starting ART. We defined CD4 cell count 
and viral load 1 year after the start of ART as the closest 
measurement before 1 year within a 9–12 month window.
Patients were followed up for all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality from the time of starting ART, considered lost 
to follow-up if there was a gap of more than 1 year 
between the dates they were last known to be alive and 
the database close date, and censored 6 months after the 
last recorded measurement. Mortality infor 
mation was 
obtained through linkage with Vital Statistics agencies 
and hospitals or physician report and active follow-up of 
participants. Methods for classifying causes of death, with 
an adaptation of the CoDe project protocol, are described 
elsewhere.11 Deaths were coded as AIDS-related if there 
was a serious AIDS defining condition close to death or a 
low CD4 cell count (<100 cells per µL) before death, and 
a diagnosis compatible with AIDS as cause of death.
Statistical analysis
We compared characteristics of patients by calendar 
period of initiation of ART (1996–99, 2000–03, 2004–07, 
2008–10). We used Cox models stratified by cohort to 
estimate unadjusted and adjusted mortality hazard ratios 
(HRs) by period of initiation of ART. Models were 
adjusted for sex, injecting drug use, AIDS at baseline, 
age (16–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, ≥60 years), CD4 cell 
count (0–24, 25–49, 50–99, 100–199, 200–349, 350–499, 
≥500 cells per µL), and HIV-1 RNA viral load (0 to <10 000, 
≥10 000 to <100 000, ≥100 000 copies per mL) at the start of 
ART. Because mortality is higher in the first year of ART, 
we fitted separate models for the first year after starting 
ART and the second and third years after starting ART. To 
investigate the mediating effect of response to therapy, we 
additionally adjusted the second and third year analysis 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We ran three PubMed searches for articles published between 
Jan 1, 2001, and June 1, 2016, with the terms (1) “HIV”, “calendar 
year”, and “mortality”; (2) “HIV”, “life expectancy”, and 
“mortality”; (3) “HIV”, “causes of death”, and “mortality”. A study 
of 2675 patients in the Australian HIV cohort found lower 
mortality in individuals who started antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
from 2004 onwards compared with earlier years, although that 
study focused on the effect of duration of treatment rather than 
trends in early mortality on ART. A large study by D:A:D found 
lower all-cause, cardiovascular, and liver disease mortality in 
patients followed up in 2009–11 compared with 1999–2000, but 
did not analyse deaths by period of starting ART. We previously 
reported that between 1995 and 2003, virological response to 
ART improved but early mortality did not decrease. Surveillance 
data from the USA showed increasing life expectancy with year of 
HIV diagnosis between 1996 and 2005. We also reported that life 
expectancy in individuals starting ART increased between 1996 
and 2005; studies in Europe and the USA have also shown 
increases in life expectancy over time.
Added value of this study
Our study, based on a large collaboration of cohorts in Europe 
and North America, found that substantial declines in 
mortality for individuals starting ART in 2008–10, compared 
with earlier years, has resulted in increased life expectancy. 
However, this life expectancy remains lower than that of the 
general population. Declines in mortality were greater for the 
second and third years after starting ART than for the 
first year after starting ART. Rates of non-AIDS-related deaths, 
particularly deaths from cardiovascular disease, were 
substantially lower in 2008–10 than previously. There was 
little evidence that mortality has declined in people who 
inject drugs.
Implications of all the available evidence
Improvements in the care of people living with HIV since the 
introduction of ART 20 years ago have led to improved 
survival and increased life expectancy in those starting ART. 
These improvements probably reflect the availability of 
superior antiretroviral agents, more options for the 
management of patients developing resistance, fewer drug 
interactions, better management of opportunistic infections 
and chronic diseases, and introduction of screening and 
prevention programmes. Prognostic models and estimates of 
life expectancy should be updated to account for these 
improvements.

for CD4 cell count and viral load measured 1 year after 
initiation of ART. We compared HR for regimen failure, 
defined as switching regimen within 6 months of a viral 
load measurement of more than 1000 copies per mL after 
first achieving viral suppression, by period of ART 
initiation. In patients with regimen failure, we estimated 
mortality HR by period of ART initiation.
We used Cox models to investigate the consistency of 
mortality trends across subgroups of patients defined by 
sex and transmission risk (men who have sex with men 
[MSM], male heterosexual, female heterosexual, men 
who inject drugs, women who inject drugs) in European 
patients (because transmission risk was missing for 
large numbers of North American patients); CD4 cell 
count categories (<100, 100–199, 200–349, ≥350 cells 
per µL); age; and region (Europe, North America). In a 
sensitivity analysis, patients were considered lost to 
follow-up at 6 months rather than 12 months. We 
repeated analyses with the following causes of death as the 
outcome: AIDS-related, non-AIDS-related (ie, non-AIDS 
infection, malignancies not caused by AIDS or hepatitis, 
liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and other [causes 
with ≤20 cases]), and unnatural causes (suicide, accident 
or other violent death, euthanasia, and substance abuse), 
and those missing or unknown. We estimated sex-specific 
life expectancy by period of ART initiation, overall and by 
region (North America, Europe). We used a Poisson 
model to estimate mortality in age bands of 5 years, which 
were used to construct life tables and estimate average age 
at death for those aged 20 years at initiation of ART. We 
compared these estimates with those from the French and 
US general populations. For comparability across periods 
and to investigate the effect of higher mortality in the first 
year of ART, we estimated life expectancy on the basis of 
mortality in the first 3 years of follow-up, and then with 
mortality in the second and third years of follow-up. 
Because there were few patients aged 70 years or older, for 
the oldest open-ended age group we used the French 
general population mortality multiplied by the mean rate 
ratio in ART-CC compared with the French general 
population (chosen because France contributed the most 
patients) for ages 60–64 and 65–69 years. Per-period 
changes in life expectancy were estimated with meta-
regression. We used Stata (version 14) for analyses.

Results
88 504 patients were eligible for our analyses. During 
84 621 person-years, 2106 (2%) patients died in the first 
year after starting ART (24·9 per 1000 person-years). 
81 608 (92%) individuals remained in the study for 
more than 1 year, of whom 2302 (3%) died during 
153 813 person-years (15·0 per 1000 person-years). 
4594 (5%) patients were lost to follow-up during the first 
year after starting ART and 6674 patients (8%) were lost-
to follow-up during the second and third years. Patients 
who were lost to follow-up had lower viral loads and 
higher CD4 cell counts than were those not lost to follow-
up, and they were also more likely to be female, younger, 
and people who inject drugs (data not shown).
The proportion of women increased from 20% in 
1996–99 to 28% in 2004–07, then decreased to 21% 
in 2008–10 (table 1). Median age increased between 1996–99 
and 2008–10, whereas the proportion of people who inject 
drugs decreased from 17% to 7%. Median CD4 count 1 year

after ART initiation increased substantially, from 370 cells 
per µL (IQR 211–572) in 1996–99 to 430 cells per µL 
(295–570) in 2008–10, and the proportion of patients with 
HIV-1 RNA viral load of 500 copies per mL or lower 
increased from 71% in 1996–99 to 93% in 2008–10.
During 1996–99, most patients started a protease 
inhibitor-based regimen, whereas after 2000 non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-
based regimens were most common (table 2). The 
protease inhibitors indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir 
were replaced by atazanavir, darunavir, and lopinavir. Of 
the NNRTIs, efavirenz was the most commonly used 
third regimen drug from 2000 onwards. The NRTIs 
didanosine, stavudine, and zidovudine were replaced by 
abacavir and tenofovir.
Compared with patients who started ART in 2000–03, 
all-cause mortality during the first year of ART was 
similar in patients who started ART between 1996 
and 2007, but substantially lower for those who started 
ART in 2008–10 (adjusted HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·61–0·83; 
figure 1). The adjusted HR per calendar period was 0·90 
(0·87–0·95). Declines in 1 year mortality over calendar 
time were consistent across subgroups of patients defined 
by their characteristics at the start of ART, apart from 
individuals who inject drugs and those starting ART with 
CD4 counts less than 100 cells per µL or CD4 count 
greater than or equal to 350 cells per µL (appendix).
All-cause mortality in the second and third years 
after starting ART declined substantially over calendar 
time (adjusted HR per calendar period 0·78, 95% CI 
0·75–0·82; figure 2). Declines were consistent across 
Europe and North America, age groups, and CD4 cell 
count at ART initiation. The decline in mortality was less 
in people who inject drugs (adjusted HR per calendar 
period 0·90 [0·80–1·02] for men and 0·95 [0·76–1·20] for 
women; appendix p 1) than in other groups. We examined 
the mediating effects of CD4 cell count and viral load 
measured 1 year after starting ART on mortality trends 
during the second and third years of ART in 53 244 (65%) 
eligible patients with available measurements (figure 2). 
Additionally adjusting for 1 year CD4 cell count and viral 
load attenuated the adjusted HR per calendar period 
to 0·90 (0·85–0·96). The proportion of patients with 
regimen failure declined over time (adjusted HR per 
calendar period 0·73, 0·72–0·75), but among those with 
regimen failure there was no evidence of an improvement 
in survival (adjusted HR per calendar period 0·98, 
0·87–1·09; appendix p 2). Results of sensitivity analyses 
in which patients were considered lost to follow-up at 
6 months rather than 12 months were similar to the main 
analyses (data not shown).
Causes were classified for 3126 (71%) of 4408 deaths. 
Rates of deaths from AIDS during the first year of ART 
declined over calendar time (adjusted HR per calendar 
period 0·93, 95% CI 0·86–0·99), with greater declines

for the second and third year of ART (0·69, 0·64–0·76). 
Rates of non-AIDS-related death during the first year of 
follow-up declined over calendar time (0·87, 0·80–0·95), 
as did rates during the second and third years of 
follow-up (0·75, 0·69–0·81). Declines in mortality were 
consistent across causes of mortality (table 3): the 
greatest decline was in liver-related deaths during the 
second and third years of ART.
Life expectancy increased with calendar period of 
initiation of ART, for both men and women (figure 3 
and appendix p 2). Expected average ages at death for 
Europeans aged 20 years starting ART in 2008–10, on the 
basis of mortality during the first 3 years of ART, were 
67·6 years (95% CI 66·7–68·5) for men and 67·9 years 
(67·2–68·7) for women, lower than in the French general 
population (79 years in men and 85 years in women). Life 
expectancy was lower in North America (expected age at 
death 65·9 years [65·0–66·8] in men and 63·2 years 
[62·2–64·3] in women for patients aged 20 years starting 
ART in 2008–10) than in Europe and was lower than in the 
US general population (78 years in men and 82 years in 
women). When estimates of life expectancy were based on 
mortality during the second and third years of ART, the 
average ages at death were around 10 years higher. 
Increases in life expectancy over calendar time were 
similar when estimated with data for the first 3 years and 
for the second and third years of follow-up. The expected 
age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting ART during 
2008–10, who had a CD4 count of more than 350 cells 
per µL 1 year after starting ART, was 78·0 years (77·7–78·3).
Discussion
Between 1996 and 2013, survival of people living with 
HIV in the first 3 years since ART initiation improved 
substantially. During the first year of ART, mortality was 
similar in patients who started ART between 1996 
and 2007, but lower during 2008–10. Survival over 
calendar time improved consistently during the second 
and third years after initiation of ART. Declines in 
mortality were lower in people who inject drugs than in 
other groups. Response to ART, measured by CD4 cell 
count and viral load 1 year after starting ART, only partly 
explained improvements in survival during the second 
and third years of ART. AIDS-related and non-AIDS-
related mortality declined over calendar time, during the 
first year and second–third years after ART initiation. 
Life expectancy in patients starting ART has increased by 
about 10 years during the ART era, but remains lower 
than in the general population. Patients who started ART 
during 2008–10 whose CD4 counts exceeded 350 cells 
per µL 1 year after ART initiation have estimated life 
expectancy approaching that of the general population.
Reduced mortality during the first year of ART is likely to 
be explained by better initial regimens with greater 
effectiveness and improved tolerability with fewer 
side-effects, because rates of regimen modification are 
highest soon after starting ART.12 Improvements in survival 
during the second and third years of ART are probably 
caused by increased viral suppression, declining rates of 
viral failure, and increasing treatment options.13,14 Simpler 
regimens might have contributed to improve 
ments in 
both short-term and long-term adherence to ART. Drug 
pharmacokinetics have improved and since 2006, single 
daily pill formulations with fewer drug interactions have 
been available.2 Mortality soon after starting ART is 
strongly influenced by the proportion of patients who start 
ART with severe immunodeficiency (late presentation), 
but reductions in the proportion of such patients starting 
ART do not explain our findings, because we controlled for 
previous AIDS and for CD4 cell count at ART initiation. 
Better management of patients with late presentation of 
HIV infection and more general improvements in health 
care for people living with HIV could have contributed to 
improved survival. With the perception that HIV-positive 
people will live into old age, clinicians are screening for 
and treating comorbidities more aggressively, including 
common disorders such as cardiovascular disease, 
hepatitis C, and cancer. Increasing life expectancy

might encourage patients to engage in risk reduction 
programmes, to cease smoking, and to increase adherence 
to ART.15 In the USA, improved survival after 2010 could in 
part be a result of the introduction of the National HIV
/
AIDS Strategy, which aimed to increase access to care, 
improve health outcomes, and address health inequities 
among people living with HIV.
Rates of AIDS deaths during the first year of ART were 
substantially lower in the most recent period, which is 
probably caused by declining rates of more serious AIDS 
events, such as AIDS-defining malignancies.6 As we 
reported previously,16 the proportion of deaths from 
AIDS has declined over time. The substantial decline in 
cardiovascular mortality could be a result of more 
aggressive screening and treatment of cardiovascular 
risk factors, decreasing contraindications for lipid-
lowering medications, especially statins (because of 
drug interactions or poor overall condition), and reduced 
use of abacavir in individuals who have high viral loads, 
are HLA B5701 positive or are at high risk of myocardial 
infarction.17 Moreover, the incidence of cardiovascular 
disease has decreased in the general population over 
time, and therapeutic interventions have improved.18
Between 1996–99 and 2008–10, life expectancy in people 
living with HIV starting ART increased by around 10 
years for both sexes, in Europe and North America. 
However, the 12-year improvements that we found were 
less than the 15–24 year increases over similar time 
periods reported by other studies in the UK and North 
America.19–22 Two of these studies examined trends by 
period of follow-up21,22 and two19,20 did not control for 
duration of ART, which tends to increase estimated life 
expectancy in earlier periods relative to later periods23 
because mortality is higher soon after the start of ART 
than after successful treatment for a number of years. 
Estimates of life expectancy in patients who survive the 
first year of ART are much higher than at ART initiation, 
reflecting the importance of starting therapy early in the 
course of HIV infection.20,23
We analysed data for many people living with HIV who 
were receiving routine clinical care in western Europe, 
the USA, and Canada. Some cohorts, such as the Danish 
HIV cohort, FHDH (France), and ATHENA (Netherlands) 
cover most of their countries. Others are regional but are 
representative of public care for the areas in which they 
operate. Therefore, our findings should be generalisable 
to treated people living with HIV in high-income settings.

follow-up between calendar periods and accounted for 
heterogeneity in death rates between cohorts.24 Our 
results might be affected by confounding: patient 
characteristics have changed during the 20 years that 
ART has been available, with a smaller proportion of 
infections in people who inject drugs in more recent 
years and changing patterns of migration from 
sub-Saharan Africa. Transmission group is sometimes 
misclassified, and transmission for people who inject 
drugs does not necessarily imply continuing drug use. 
Outcomes in patients lost to follow-up within 3 years of 
starting ART are uncertain, but most cohorts link to 
death registries. CD4 cell count and viral load 1 year after 
starting ART were missing for some patients who might 
have been less engaged in care and likely to have worse 
prognosis. Mortality was estimated on pooled data and 
therefore the estimated life expectancy reflects patients’ 
average experience. Estimates of life expectancy are 
sensitive to mortality in the oldest age groups, for which 
data are sparse. Our study only includes patients who 
started ART, whereas most deaths in people with HIV 
infection occur in the untreated population.
Our study tracks the progress made in treating people 
living with HIV between 1996 and 2013. Monitoring 
survival can clarify when and how improvements were 
achieved, and provides a benchmark against which current 
or future interventions, such as treatment with integrase 
inhibitors, guidelines recommending earlier treatment, or 
limiting CD4 cell count and viral load monitoring in stable 
patients, can be measured. Prognostic information is 
important to patients, their relatives, and clinicians, and 
can be used to inform health-care planning at the 
individual, clinic, and government levels. Improvements 
in survival with better ART regimens could provide 
evidence to policy makers that modern palatable and 
effective treatments should continue to be used in 
preference to older antiretroviral drugs that are becoming 
available as cheaper generics. Information about life 
expectancy in people living with HIV and the knowledge 
that it could be approaching that of the general population 
is important to motivate at-risk individuals to test for HIV 
and convince those infected to start ART immediately, and 
might decrease stigmatisation of people living with HIV 
and help them to obtain insurance or employment.
Since modern ART is highly effective and has low 
toxicity, the excess mortality in people living with HIV 
is unlikely to be addressed by further development of 
antiretroviral drugs. Instead, lifestyle issues that affect 
adherence to ART and non-AIDS mortality, and diagnosis 
and treatment of comorbidities in people living with HIV 
will need to be addressed. Interventions are needed to 
promote modern therapy to vulnerable populations, such 
as people who inject drugs, who currently do not fully 
benefit from ART. Improved access to opioid substitution 
treatment programmes and direct acting antiviral drugs 
for hepatitis C virus co-infection should be a priority for 
this group.25
Continued efforts are required to address late diagnosis 
and presentation to care to decrease mortality soon after 
starting ART, and support lifelong adherence to ART. 
Treatment guidelines changed in 2015 after results of the 
START trial showed clear benefits of immediate versus 
deferred treatment.26 Most future patients diagnosed 
with HIV are likely to start ART immediately (both for their 
own health and to prevent transmission to others), but this 
will only result in improved survival if the problems of late 
HIV diagnosis and access to care are addressed.
