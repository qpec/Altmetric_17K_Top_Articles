Widening Disparities In Infant
Mortality And Life Expectancy
Between Appalachia And The Rest
Of The United States, 1990–2013
ABSTRACT Appalachia—a region that stretches from Mississippi to New
York—has historically been recognized as a socially and economically
disadvantaged part of the United States, and growing evidence suggests
that health disparities between it and the rest of the country are
widening. We compared infant mortality and life expectancy disparities in
Appalachia to those outside the region during the period 1990–2013. We
found that infant mortality disparities widened for both whites and
blacks, with infant mortality 16 percent higher in Appalachia in 2009–13,
and the region’s deficit in life expectancy increased from 0.6 years in
1990–92 to 2.4 years in 2009–13. The association between area poverty
and life expectancy was stronger in Appalachia than in the rest of the
United States. We found wide health disparities, including a thirteen-year
gap in life expectancy among black men in high-poverty areas of
Appalachia, compared to white women in low-poverty areas elsewhere.
Higher mortality in Appalachia from cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer,
chronic lower respiratory diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, diabetes, nephritis or kidney diseases, suicide, unintentional
injuries, and drug overdose contributed to lower life expectancy in the
region, compared to the rest of the country. Widening health disparities
were also due to slower mortality improvements in Appalachia.
I
nfant mortality and life expectancy have
long been considered important indica-
tors of a nation’s health and well-being,
with life expectancy also recognized as a
key measure of human development.1–3
For more than two decades, increasing life ex-
pectancy and reducing health disparities, includ-
ing disparities in infant mortality, have been the
two most important health policy goals for the
United States, as specified in the national health
initiative Healthy People 2020.1,2 Although trends
and social inequalities in these indicators have
been well documented for the United States as a
whole, limited research has investigated dispar-
ities between Appalachia and the rest of the
nation, particularly over time.1,4,5 Appalachia, a
geographically based cultural region in the east-
ern United States, has historically been recog-
nized as a socially and economically disadvan-
taged region.5
Although substantialpublic and privateinvest-
ments have been made in the past five decades to
tackle poverty and other unfavorable economic
conditions in Appalachia, the region has contin-
ued to lag behind the rest of the nation in social
and economic development. Economic and de-
mographic trends in Appalachia have been less
favorable because of the region’s overreliance on
just a few industries; the decline of the logging,
mining, and manufacturing sectors there; and
the resulting job losses and outmigration of
skilled workers.5 There is also evidence to sug-

 gest that Appalachia is losing ground in impor-
tant health matters relative to the rest of the
nation, which may be contributing to region’s
lower quality of life and economic vitality.5 Given
these trends, we might expect to see increasing
health disparities between Appalachia and the
rest of the country. If that were the case, the
region could provide lessons to other economi-
cally distressed US regions.
Previous studies of Appalachia have examined
disparities for a number of health outcomes such
as all-causemortality, cardiovasculardisease and
cancer mortality, lung disease, diabetes, inju-
ries, and health-risk behaviors and have found
higher rates of disease, smoking, obesity, and
physical inactivity in the region, compared to
the rest of the United States.6–9 Indeed, central
and southern portions of the Appalachian region
have been shown to have among the highest
death rates in the country.6,7 However, to our
knowledge, only one previous study, published
in 2005, has compared life expectancy for poor
whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley
with that for all US whites.10
A number of studies have shown that poor
people live much longer in some communities
than in others and that the impact of areapoverty
on life expectancy and mortality rates is higher
in certain regions, including rural areas of the
United States.2,11–13 People living in economically
distressed or rural communities have lower life
expectancy and higher mortality rates than those
in affluent communities.2,11–13 Given these differ-
ential patterns of association between poverty
and health, we examined whether impoverished
communities in Appalachia fare better or worse
in their infant mortality and life expectancy pat-
terns, compared to their counterparts in the rest
of the United States.
Life expectancy estimates are routinely avail-
able for sex and broad racial/ethnicgroups in the
United States.4 A few US studies have reported
rural-urban and socioeconomic differentials in
life expectancy, particularly by area-based pover-
ty or deprivation level.2,11,12,14,15 Less attention has
been paid to the estimation of life expectancy in
Appalachia, particularly the analysis of trends
over timeamong areas with high levels of poverty
and economic deprivation.10 It is not known
whether changes in infant mortality and life ex-
pectancy in Appalachia differ from changes in
the rest of the United States.
In this article we compare disparities over time
in infant mortality and life expectancy between
Appalachia and the rest of the country, using
national vital statistics data. Understanding
the magnitude and causes of these disparities
across populations or regions such as Appala-
chia, where socioeconomic and health condi-
tions differ markedly from the rest of the coun-
try, is essential to formulating policies to tackle
the problem of growing health inequalities.2,5,12
Study Data And Methods
Data And Analyses Data on mortality in the
period 1990–2013 from the National Vital Statis-
tics System were used to analyze temporal trends
in infant mortality and life expectancy.4,16,17
These data identify all decedents’ county of resi-
dence, which allowed us to distinguish Appala-
chia from the restof the nation.We used the 2008
Appalachian Regional Commission definition
of Appalachia, which covers 428 counties in
thirteen states5,17 According to this definition,
the region includes all counties in West Virginia
and some counties in Alabama, Georgia, Ken-
tucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, and Virginia5,17 (for a map of the
region, see online Appendix Exhibit 1).18
Infant mortality rates and life expectancy at
birth were calculated for seven time periods:
1990–92,
1993–95,
1996–98,
1999–2001,
2002–04, 2005–08, and 2009–13.4,16,17,19 Age-,
sex-, and race-specific populations and deaths
specific to them were summed across counties
within bothAppalachiaand the restof the United
States and grouped by the three distinct area–
poverty-rate categories described below, to pro-
duce age-specific mortality rates for each area–
poverty-rate group.2 Life-table estimates were
calculated using the standard life-table method-
ology: converting observed age-specific mortali-
ty rates into life-table probabilities of dying.2,12,20
Since poverty status of decedents is not re-
ported in the National Vital Statistics System
and direct computation of infant mortality and
life expectancy by income level is not possible,
we linked the data on poverty in 2009–13 from
the American Community Survey to the mortali-
ty statistics for the age-sex-race-county popula-
tions to derive infant mortality and life expectan-
cy estimates by area–poverty-rate group.2,19
Counties were assigned to one of three county-
level poverty groups by percentage of the popu-
lation with annual incomes below the federal
poverty level: < 10:00 percent (low poverty),
10.00–19.99
percent
(middle
poverty),
and
≥ 20:00
percent
(high
poverty).2,19
Similar
area–poverty-rate categories have previously
been used in analyses of life expectancy and mor-
tality trends.2,13
We examined disparities in life expectancy by
stratifying analyses according to race and sex for
all time periods and additionally by area poverty
level for the period 2009–13. Health disparities
were measured by rate differences and rate

 ratios. Absolute differences in life expectancy in
1990–92 and 2009–13 between Appalachia and
the rest of the United States were decomposed
additively by age groups and into major under-
lying causes of death by employing Eduardo
Arriaga’s widely used life-table decomposition
method.2,20–22 Age-adjusted rates of mortality
from major causes of death were computed for
the periods 1990–92 and 2009–13 to supplement
the life-expectancy trend analysis. Rates of
drug-poisoning deaths (also referred to as
drug-overdose deaths) for the periods 2005–
08 and 2009–13 were computed for Appalachia
and the rest of the United States4,23 but could not
be computed for earlier time periods because of
the lack of data. Differences in life expectancy
and in infant and cause-specific mortality rates
were tested for significance (p < 0:05, p < 0:01,
and p < 0:001).
Descriptive sociodemographic and health data
for Appalachia and the rest of the United States
were derived from the decennial censuses, Amer-
ican Community Survey,19 Area Health Resource
File,24 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sys-
tem (BRFSS),25 and the national natality file.26
Limitations Our study was subject to several
limitations. First, it was descriptive in its design
and did not quantify the independent impacts of
socioeconomic conditions, health-risk behav-
iors, and access to medical care on the temporal
disparities in infant mortality and life expec-
tancy.
Second, poverty rates at the census-tract level
could vary greatly within a given county.2,12,19
Unfortunately, census-tract geocodes are not
available in the National Vital Statistics Sys-
tem.2,4,12,16 Given the compositional heterogene-
ity of counties, the association between area
poverty, life expectancy, and infant mortality
reported here is likely to be underestimated.2,12,27
Third, our analysis was based on aggregate-
level population data. Drawing inferences about
individual-level association (for example, be-
tween poverty and life expectancy) could lead
to ecological bias.2,12,27
Fourth, we considered Appalachia as a single
geographical
entity,
but
health
and
social
inequalities vary greatly within Appalachia.5–7
Central Appalachia has a larger concentration
of persistently poor and economically distressed
counties, compared to northern and southern
Appalachia.5–7 However, the stratification of in-
fant mortality and life expectancy analyses by
poverty level in our study provides important
insights into the magnitude of health variations
that exist across the subregions of Appalachia.
Finally, health-related or economic migration
out of Appalachia might also explain the diver-
gence in health trends between Appalachia and
the rest of the United States. Slower population
growth in Appalachia is partly due to outmigra-
tion, as has been previously reported for the
rural United States as a whole5,13 (for details
about the differences between populations in
Appalachia and the rest of the United States,
see Appendix Exhibit 2).18 If residents of Appa-
lachia who were healthier, more affluent, or both
migrated to more urban and affluent areas of the
United States, this would have increased the
health and socioeconomic inequalities between
Appalachia and the rest of the country.
Study Results
Disparities In Sociodemographic And Health
Characteristics About 8.2 percent of the US
population lives in Appalachia. In the period
1990–2012, the region’s population grew by
16 percent, compared to growth of 25 percent
for the rest of the nation (Appendix Exhibit 2).18
Compared to the rest of the United States, aver-
age socioeconomic status is lower in Appalachia,
with higher poverty and unemployment rates
and lower education levels. Appalachia also
has a lower rate of physician availability but
higher indicators of need for health care ser-
vices, such as prevalence of adult smoking, obe-
sity, physical inactivity, disability, and diabetes.
Rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, mater-
nal diabetes, and maternal hypertension are
significantly higher in Appalachia.
Trends In Infant Mortality Disparities In
1990–92 the infant mortality rate for all races in
Appalachia was 9.3 per 1,000 live births, which
was not significantly different from the rate of
9.2 for the rest of the United States (Exhibit 1).
Although these rates declined consistently dur-
ing 1990–13 in both Appalachia and the rest of
the country, by 2009–13 the infant mortality rate
was 16 percent higher in Appalachia than in the
rest of the United States. The disparity in mor-
tality also widened for both white and black
infants, though black infants had higher rates
throughout the study period in both Appalachia
and the rest of the country. Infant mortality was
correlated with poverty level both in Appalachia
and elsewhere. In 2009–13 infants in high-
poverty areas in Appalachia and elsewhere had
mortality rates that were higher (by 39 percent
and 55 percent, respectively) than those for
infants from low-poverty areas (Exhibit 1).
Trends In Life Expectancy Disparities In
1990–92 life expectancy at birth for both sexes
and all races in Appalachia was 75.2 years—0.6
years shorter than the life expectancy of 75.8
years in the rest of the United States (Exhibit 2).
In 2009–13 the deficit in life expectancy for
Appalachia had increased to 2.4 years. The

 difference was most pronounced among white
men: In 2009–13 this group was expected to live
74.5 years in Appalachia and 2.6 years longer
outside the region.
Between 1990–92 and 2009–13, residents of
the United States outside Appalachia experi-
enced larger gains in life expectancy than those
of Appalachia, which contributed to the widen-
ing gap. For Appalachian men, life expectancy
increased by 2.9 years between the two time
periods, while for non-Appalachian men, it
increased by 4.6 years. The corresponding in-
creases in life expectancy among women were
0.7 and 2.4 years, respectively.
The association between area poverty and life
expectancy was stronger in Appalachia than in
the rest of the United States. In Appalachia in
2009–13, residents of high-poverty areas had a
life expectancy of 75.1 years, compared with 79.9
years for those in low-poverty areas (Exhibit 3).
When stratified by sex, race, and poverty level,
life expectancy in 2009–13 ranged from 70.4

 years among black men in high-poverty areas
of Appalachia (Exhibit 3) to 83.0 years among
white women in low-poverty areas elsewhere
(Appendix Exhibit 3).18
Consistent with the life-expectancy trends,
all-cause mortality in Appalachia was 5 percent
higher in 1990–92 and 18 percent higher in
2009–13, compared to the rest of the United
States (Appendix Exhibit 4).18 In 2009–13 in-
fants in Appalachia were 8 percent, 12 percent,
and 61 percent more likely to die from perinatal
conditions, birth defects, and sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS), respectively, compared
to infants outside of Appalachia.
Excess mortality among people younger than
25 in Appalachia contributed to 0.16 years or
6.5 percent of the life expectancy gap of 2.4 years
in 2009–13 between Appalachia and the rest of
the United States (Exhibit 4). The rest of the gap
can be attributed to excess mortality among
those ages 25–64 in Appalachia (48.6 percent)
and those ages 65 and older (45.0 percent). Car-
diovascular diseases (especially heart disease),
unintentional injuries (which include drug over-
doses), and cancer accounted for 57.8 percent
of the life-expectancy gap. Stroke, chronic lower
respiratory diseases or chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, nephritis or kidney diseases,
diabetes, influenza or pneumonia, and Alz-
heimer’s disease accounted for larger propor-
tions of the life-expectancy gap in women, while
unintentional injuries, lung cancer, heart dis-
ease, and suicide accounted for greater percen-
tages of the gap in men. Smoking-related
diseases accounted for more than half of the
life-expectancy gap between Appalachia and
the rest of the country.
A decomposition analysis for the period 1990–
92 indicated that excess mortality among people
ages sixty-five and older accounted for much of
the life-expectancy gap of 0.6 years at that time
between Appalachia and the rest of the country
(Appendix Exhibit 5).18
Discussion
Our study has provided new analyses of the
trends in disparities between Appalachia and
the rest of the United States in life expectancy,
infant mortality, and mortality from major
causes of death. Decomposition of life expectan-
cy disparities by age and cause of death is a par-
ticularly novel feature of our study. Although life
expectancy increased everywhere in the United

 States between 1990 and 2013, less rapid de-
clines in mortality and slower gains in life expec-
tancy among people in Appalachia have led to
a widening health gap. Higher rates of birth
defects and SIDS mortality in Appalachia are
important policy concerns, as they accounted
for 60 percent of the infant mortality gap be-
tween Appalachia and the rest of the country
in 2009–13 (data not shown).
Stratification by sociodemographic groups
showed wide disparities in life expectancy, in-
cluding a thirteen-year gap in life expectancy
between black men in high-poverty areas of Ap-
palachia and white women in low-poverty areas
in the rest of the United States. Smoking-related
diseases accounted for more than half of the life-
expectancy gap between the regions, although
relatively high levels of employment in coal-
mining industries and air pollution in some re-
gions of Appalachia might also have contributed
to lower life expectancy and excess mortality
from lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.5–7 Dis-
parities in life expectancy across areas with dif-
ferent levels of poverty are consistent with recent
studies that show a difference of 4.5 years in life
expectancy between the least- and most-deprived
areas, and a difference of 3.0–6.0 years between
low- and high-poverty areas, in the United
States.2,12
Our findings on poverty and infant mortality
are consistent with the results of studies that
show increases in infant mortality rates in accor-
dance with increasing area deprivation and
poverty levels in the United States.2,12,27 Our find-
ings are also consistent with those of previous
studies showing higher all-cause mortality and
mortality from leading causes of death (such as
heart disease, stroke, all cancers combined, lung
cancer, colorectal cancer, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diabetes, and unintentional
injuries) in Appalachia, compared to the rest of
the United States or the nation as a whole.6–8
Recent reports have documented that a steep
rise in mortality from drug abuse has contribut-
ed to declining life expectancy among Appala-
chian women and an increase in mortality
among all middle-aged white Americans.28–30 In
our analysis, we found that life expectancy de-
clined among white women in Appalachia from
1990 to 2004, while life expectancy increased
among white women in the rest of the nation.
Between 1999 and 2013 in the United States, the

 dose deaths more than doubled, the rate from
drug-overdose deaths involving opioid analge-
sics more than tripled, and the rate from those
deaths involving heroin nearly tripled.4,23 In
2012 the Appalachian states of West Virginia
and Kentucky had the highest rates of drug-
abuse deaths in the nation.23 In our study,
drug-overdose mortality in the period 2005–13
was substantially higher and increased more
rapidly in Appalachia, compared to the rest of
the country (see Appendix Exhibit 4),18 and that
excess mortality accounted for 6.3 percent of
the life expectancy gap in 2009–13. Additional
decomposition analyses not shown here indicat-
ed that drug overdose accounted for 5.1 percent
of the gap in 2005–08. This seems to suggest that
drug overdose is becoming an increasingly im-
portant determinant of the widening life-expec-
tancy gap between Appalachia and the rest of the
country.
The widening gap in infant mortality and life
expectancy between Appalachia and the rest of
the United States may be related to persistent or
increasing disparities in general living standards
and health-risk behaviors such as adult smoking,
smoking during pregnancy, obesity, physical in-
activity, and heavy consumption of alcohol.5–9 As
shown in Appendix Exhibit 218 and reported in
another study,5 socioeconomic and material liv-
ing conditions of people in Appalachia worsened
relative to the conditions of people outside the
region and of the general US population during
our study period.
It should be noted that with social and eco-
nomic inequality continuing to increase and

 rising, there is no guarantee that life expectancy
and mortality rates will continue to improve in
the United States and its regions, including Ap-
palachia. Indeed, the latest available data for the
country show a slight decline in life expectancy
in 2015 and a rise in mortality from eight leading
causes of death, including heart disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, unintentional
injuries, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes,
kidney disease, and suicide.31
Policy Implications
Given the continued gap in socioeconomic and
living conditions evident between population
groups and regions in the United States, a new
commitment to investment, at various levels
of government, in human and physical capital;
infrastructure
developments,
particularly
in
higher
education;
and
increased
access
to
high-quality affordable health care is likely to
provide a substantial long-term health benefit
to residents of Appalachia and other economical-
ly depressed regions of the United States.32 Such
investments can lead to reduced health inequal-
ity, including inequality in life expectancy and
infant mortality. Transportation, housing, the
food environment, and social environments
are other important areas where social and pub-
lic health interventions can greatly improve pop-
ulation health and reduce health disparities in
Appalachia. Higher rates of suicide and drug
overdose mortality in Appalachia may be an in-
dicator of the region’s higher levels of social
isolation, joblessness, psychological distress
and other mental health disorders, and limited
economic opportunities.5,33
Smoking and obesity are associated with
major causes of death such as cardiovascular
diseases, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, diabetes, and kidney diseases, which
account for much of the life expectancy disparity
between Appalachia and the rest of the United
States. As the data in our study indicate, smoking
takes a tremendous toll on the health of Appa-
lachians. In fact, the Appalachian states of Ken-
tucky and West Virginia have the highest rates of
current smoking and secondhand smoke expo-
sure in the nation.34–36
A number of population-based tobacco control
policies have proved to be effective in reducing
smoking and related health disparities. These
policies include tightening restrictions on smok-
ing or making it illegal to smoke in public places
and banning the marketing of tobacco prod-
ucts.37 The Appalachia Community Cancer Net-
work, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is
an initiative in seven states designed to reduce
cancer disparities between Appalachia and the
rest of the country.38 Three of these states (Ken-
tucky, Virginia, and West Virginia) have much
lower tobacco excise taxes than the national av-
erage, while two of the states (Pennsylvania and
Virginia) have weak state laws regarding smoke-
free workplace policies.38 There is evidence to
suggest that people in rural communities, in-
cluding those in Appalachia, may be more ac-
cepting of tobacco use as a social norm and,
therefore, less likely to favor smoke-free policies
in the workplace, schools, or other public places,
or not to allow smoking in their home.39 To ad-
dress these challenges, in 2010 the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started a
program called Communities Putting Prevention
to Work.40 The program was designed to prevent
tobacco- and obesity-related chronic disease and
improve health in fifty communities by promot-
ing environmental changes at the local level,
such as the adoption of smoke-free air policies.
To address the obesity epidemic in the United
States, the CDC has long advocated for policy and
environmental changes to transform communi-
ties into places that promote good nutrition and
physical activity.41 Data from the BRFSS25 and the
Department of Agriculture’s Food Environment
Atlas42 indicate that the lower accessibility of
grocery stores, especially among households
with inadequate transportation, is related to
higher obesity and diabetes rates in counties
both in Appalachia and elsewhere in the country.
The Appalachian region faces a particularly
challenging food desert crisis, with many of its
communities
lacking
sufficient
access
to
healthy, nutritious food, as a result of decades
of economic deprivation and more recent energy
market shifts.43
Historically,rates of access to and use of health
care services have been low in Appalachia.5,6,44
A large proportion of Appalachian counties are
designated as medically underserved areas be-

 cause of shortages of primary care doctors, high
poverty, or high elderly populations. According
to a recent study, on average Appalachian coun-
ties have more disparities in terms of health care
cost, coverage, and access, compared to the na-
tional average.45
The area of unintentional injury has several
potential causal pathways in Appalachia. Motor
vehicle deaths account for nearly 30 percent of
all unintentional injury deaths in Appalachia,16
and this excess mortality contributes substan-
tially to the life expectancy gap. Lower rates of
seat-belt use; longer driving distances between
geographically isolated communities; and differ-
ences in motor-vehicle safety, speed limits, and
the enforcement of those limits may contribute
to higher mortality from motor-vehicle injury
in Appalachia.13 Rates of opioid abuse, alcohol-
impaired driving, and lower access to treatment
for trauma and drug poisoning may be other
factors that contribute to higher mortality from
unintentional injury and to lower life expectancy
in Appalachia.33 Implementing policies that in-
crease seat-belt use, reduce alcohol-impaired
driving and speeding, improve trauma care, ed-
ucate people about the dangers of opioid abuse,
and increase access to opioid dependency treat-
ment could reduce deaths from unintentional
injury and improve life expectancy in Appa-
lachia.33
Conclusion
Disparities between Appalachia and the rest of
the United States in infant mortality and life
expectancy are expected to remain substantial
for the foreseeable future, given that differences
in mortality from several major causes of death
are persisting or even increasing. Health policy
interventions such as smoking reduction, anti-
obesity measures, and improved access to health
care have the potential to reduce health dispar-
ities between Appalachia and the rest of the
country.2,6–8,12,13 However, reducing inequalities
in the underlying social determinants of health—
for example, by improving educational opportu-
nities and achievement; reducing poverty; and
providing stable housing, transportation, and
labor market opportunities—are equally impor-
tant policy goals for reducing the health gap
between Appalachia and the rest of the na-
tion.2,5–7,12,13 ▪
