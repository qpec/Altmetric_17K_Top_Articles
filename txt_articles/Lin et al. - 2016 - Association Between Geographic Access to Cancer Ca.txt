Abstract
Purpose—Trimodality therapy (chemoradiation and surgery) is standard of care for Stage II/III 
rectal cancer but nearly one third of patients do not receive radiation therapy (RT). We examined 
the relationship between density of radiation oncologist and travel distance to receipt of RT.
Materials/Methods—A retrospective study based on the National Cancer Data Base identified 
26,845 patients aged 18–80 with Stage II/III rectal cancer diagnosed between 2007–2010. 
Radiation oncologists were identified through Physician Compare Dataset. Generalized Estimating 
Equations clustering by Hospital Service Area was utilized to examine the association between 
geographic access and receipt of RT, controlling for patient sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics.
Results—70% of patients received RT within 180 days of diagnosis or within 90 days of surgery. 
Compared to travel distance <12.5 miles, patients diagnosed at reporting facility who traveled ≥50 
miles had a decreased likelihood of receipt of RT (50–249 miles: adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.75, 
p<.001; ≥250 miles: aOR 0.46, p=.002), all else being equal. Density level of radiation oncologists 
was not significantly associated with receipt of RT. Patients who were female, nonwhites, ≥50 
years, and with comorbidities were less likely to receive RT (p<.05). Patients who were uninsured 
but self-paid for their medical services, initially diagnosed elsewhere but treated at reporting 
facility, and resided in Midwest had increased likelihood of receipt of RT (p<.05).
Conclusions—Increased travel burden was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving 
RT for stage II/III rectal cancer patients when all else being equal, but radiation oncologist density 
was not. Further research in geographic access and establishing transportation assistance 
programs, or lodging services for patients with unmet need may help decrease geographic barriers 
and improve the quality of rectal cancer care.
Introduction
The efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy for surgically resectable Stage II/III rectal 
cancer is well-established from randomized trials. These studies demonstrated an increase in 
local control, disease-free and overall survival when combined with a 5-fluorouracil based 
chemotherapy after surgical resection. Preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery is 
often employed to allow sphincter-preservation and to decrease bowel morbidity. NCCN 
treatment guidelines also recommend radiation therapy (RT), either pre-operatively or post-
operatively for stage II/III rectal cancer.1 However, a large proportion of patients do not 
receive recommended RT.2–4

 Because RT requires access to radiation oncologists and linear accelerators for treatment, the 
receipt of RT may be partly influenced by geographic access. Geographic availability of RT 
resources may be evaluated by assessing geographic distribution of radiation oncologists 
and/or travel burden experienced by the patient. Higher population density of radiation 
oncologists is associated with increased likelihood of receiving RT5 and improved treatment 
outcome.6 Studies have demonstrated, however, that radiation oncologists are geographically 
maldistributed across the nation,7, 8 clustered at academic centers7 and of limited 
accessibility relative to other oncology specialists.9 Traveling long distances to cancer care is 
a barrier to cancer treatment,10–12 associated with decreased utilization of RT,13–15 or worse 
treatment outcome.16 Even with data on association between geographic access and receipt 
of RT, there is limited information specific to rectal cancer. Therefore, we sought to examine 
the relationship nationally between geographic access to cancer care and receipt of RT for 
stage II/III rectal cancer.
Methods and Materials
Data source
The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a hospital-based cancer registry that is jointly 
sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society, contains 
standardized data collected from over 1,500 Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited 
facilities and captures around 70% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States.17 
The Morehouse School of Medicine Institutional Review Board reviewed this study and 
granted IRB review exemption.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Compare dataset was used to 
identify number and location of radiation oncologists. It includes physicians and other 
providers, identified by National Provider Identifier, who have submitted Medicare claims in 
the previous 12 months. The data contains demographic information, practice location and 
specialty designation and is updated monthly.
Study population
Patients with first primary American Joint Committee On Cancer collaborative stage II/III 
rectal cancer (International Classification of Disease for Oncology, 3rd Edition site codes: 
C19.9–C20.9) with no distant metastasis, diagnosed between 2007 and 2010, aged 18 to 80, 
who were surgical candidates, and treated at CoC-accredited facilities were selected. Patients 
were considered surgical candidates if they received cancer-directed surgery (including 
partial or total proctectomy) within six months of diagnosis. Patients were excluded if 
receipt of RT, RT administration dates, surgical treatment or area of residence was unknown 
(Figure 1). Due to small numbers, patients who had government sponsored insurance other 
than Medicaid and Medicare (e.g. Indian Bureau of Affairs, Public Health Service) (n=149) 
were excluded from the study.
Outcome and Covariates
The primary outcome was receipt of RT. The consensus for optimal management of rectal 
cancer has changed over the past decade. Several randomized clinical trials support either

 preoperative or postoperative irradiation.18, 1920 In order to include both treatment 
sequencing patterns, receipt of RT was allowed within 180 days of diagnosis or 90 days of 
surgery in the NCDB. Time from diagnosis to RT was calculated from the date of cancer 
diagnosis to the RT start date while time from surgery to RT was calculated from the 
surgical date to the RT start date.
The major variables of interest were density level of radiation oncologists in a patient’s area 
of residence and travel distance to cancer treatment facility. Radiation Oncologists were 
identified through a November 2013 Physician Compare dataset if their primary specialty 
was listed as radiation oncology. The number of unique radiation oncologists was counted 
per Hospital Service area (HSA). HSAs, developed by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health 
Care21, are geographic areas covering one or more ZIP codes where medical resources are 
used based on the analysis of travel patterns for routine hospital care. The density was then 
calculated as the number of unique radiation oncologists per 100,000 residents in each HSA. 
Because many HSAs did not have radiation oncologists, a separate density level was created 
as “no radiation oncologist.” Among HSAs with ≥1 radiation oncologist, quartiles of density 
level were created from Q1 to Q4, with Q1 as the lowest quartile and Q4 as the highest 
quartile. Each patient was, then, assigned with a density level of radiation oncologists based 
on the HSA of residence at diagnosis.
Travel distance to cancer treatment was defined as driving distance between the centroids of 
ZIP codes of patient residence at diagnosis and reporting facility, as calculated by using 
Google Maps in the NCDB dataset. It was categorized as 0–12.49, 12.5–49.9, 50–249 and 
≥250 miles, based on previous literature.22–24 For patients who lived outside the continental 
U.S. but traveled back to seek cancer treatment, their travel distance was calculated by the 
“crow-fly” method.
Other variables of interest extracted from the NCDB included: patient demographics (age at 
diagnosis, gender, race/ethnicity), comorbidity, socioeconomic status (median income of 
their neighborhood), insurance, census region, location of diagnosis, facility type, and cancer 
stage. Patient insurance status was defined as private, uninsured-charity, uninsured-self-pay, 
Medicaid, younger Medicare (age 18–64) and older Medicare (age ≥65). Race/ethnicity was 
categorized as non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, other and missing. Comorbidity was 
designated by the Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score based on medical conditions captured in 
comorbidity and complication fields. Median income in the neighborhood of a patient’s 
residence was derived from 2000 US Census data and categorized based on national 
quartiles by ZIP code. Location of diagnosis was defined using the class of case codes. 
Initial diagnosis at reporting facility was defined by codes 10–14, while initial diagnosis 
elsewhere was defined by codes 20–22. Facility type was assigned by the CoC accreditation 
program.
Statistical Analysis
Geographic distribution of radiation oncologists was mapped by ArcGIS software (version 
10.2.2). Patient characteristics were summarized overall, by density level of radiation 
oncologists, by travel distance, and by location of diagnosis. Chi-squared tests were used to 
determine if statistically significant differences existed at 0.05 levels. Generalized

 Estimating Equations (GEE) clustering by HSA were utilized to examine the association 
between geographic access and receipt of RT, controlling for patient sociodemographic and 
clinical characteristics. GEE is a multivariate model that allows for potential correlation 
among patients within the same HSA. Pairwise comparison of interaction terms between 
main effects (radiation oncologist density, travel distance) and all other covariates were 
evaluated and included in the model if significant interaction was found. Two-sided p values 
with significance level at 0.05 were reported. All statistical analyses were performed using 
SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).
Results
Geographic distribution of Radiation Oncologists Nationwide
A total of 4,253 radiation oncologists were identified. Figure 2 shows geographic 
distribution of radiation oncologists in quartiles at HSA level. Of 3436 HSAs in the U.S., 
1053 (30.7%) HSAs have at least one radiation oncologist. The density levels from Q1 to Q4 
are 0–1.46, 1.47–2.32, 2.33–4.22, and ≥4.23, respectively, and overall average density is 
1.28 radiation oncologists (Interquartile range [IQR]: 1.25) per 100,000 residents. While 
over half of HSAs have no radiation oncologists, only 26.1% of population resided in those 
HSAs. The HSAs with no radiation oncologists were more likely to have smaller population 
(average 27000s–32000s residents) and in Midwest or South regions.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted using de-identified American Society for Radiation 
Oncology (ASTRO) membership data aggregated by ZIP code of practice location to define 
the number and location of radiation oncologists. Overall, geographic distribution of 
ASTRO-member radiation oncologists was similar to those based on Physician Compare but 
did not capture a greater number of radiation oncologists in majority of the HSAs.
Patient Characteristics
Among 26,845 rectal cancer patients identified as study cohort, nearly 70% of them received 
RT within 180 days of diagnosis or within 90 days of surgery (Table 1). Median age was 60 
years (IQR: 17). Most RT, if performed, was received pre-operationally (75%) and in 
reporting facilities (68%). The majority (99%) of RT was external beam RT with median 
total dose of 50.4Gy. Median time from diagnosis to initiation of RT was 38 days while 
median time between initiation of RT and surgery was 84 days (prior to surgery).
Among those patients who did not receive RT, 6.5% of them received RT but in a later time 
period, with median time from diagnosis as 226 days and median time from surgery as 203 
days (after surgery). Of others who did not receive RT, 86% of the reason for not receiving 
RT was “not part of first course of treatment”; 6% involved patient refusal; 3% was not 
recommended by doctors because of other risk factors; 1% was recommended by physicians 
but reason unknown why not administered; and 3% was recommended by doctors but 
unknown whether administered.
Around a quarter (27.8%) of patients resided in areas with no radiation oncologist 
(Supplementary Table 1). The majority (75%) of those residing in areas with no radiation 
oncologists sought treatment at facilities in areas with ≥1 radiation oncologists. Patients

 resided in areas with no radiation oncologists who traveled to seek RT were more likely to 
go to an academic comprehensive cancer program or NCI-designated facilities compared 
with patients resided in areas with radiation oncologists. As expected, most patients (75%) 
who resided in areas with ≥1 radiation oncologists did not seek treatment in areas with 
higher density of radiation oncologists.
Nearly half (45.8%) of patients had traveled <12.5 miles to the reporting facility 
(Supplementary Table 2A). Patients who resided in “no radiation oncologist” HSAs traveled 
almost three times as far to a reporting facility for treatment compared with those who 
resided in areas with ≥1 radiation oncologists (median distance: 30 vs. 11 miles, p<.001). 
Since there was a significant interaction between travel distance and diagnosis location (p<.
001), stratified descriptive analyses showed that among patients diagnosed at reporting 
facility, those traveled ≥50 miles were less likely to receive RT than those traveled shorter 
distance (Supplementary Table 2B). This trend, however, was opposite among patients 
diagnosed elsewhere (Supplementary Table 2C).
Almost half (45.6%) of our study cohort were diagnosed elsewhere but treated at reporting 
facility (Table 2). Compared with patients diagnosed and treated at reporting facility, those 
diagnosed elsewhere were more likely to receive RT (65% vs. 75%, p<.001), reside in areas 
without any radiation oncologists (23% vs. 33%, p<.001), and travel ≥50 miles to reporting 
facility (7% vs. 23%, p<.001). Patients were less likely to seek treatment in different 
facilities if aged ≥76, black race, female, uninsured or Medicaid insured, with comorbidities, 
resided in areas with lower median income.
Factors associated with receipt of radiation therapy
The adjusted associations between geographic access to and receipt of RT are shown in 
Table 3 and stratified analyses by diagnosis location are presented in Supplementary Table 3. 
In univariate analysis (Supplementary Table 2A), receipt of RT was lower among whom 
traveled <12.5 miles. These untreated patients were more likely to be female, of non-white 
races, ≥50 years, had ≥1 comorbidities, lower income, non-private insurance, or resided in 
the South. However, after taking into account all the variables in multivariate analyses, 
patients diagnosed at reporting facility who traveled ≥50 miles had a decreased likelihood of 
receipt of RT (50–249 miles: adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.75, p=<.001; ≥250 miles: aOR 
0.46, p=.002) than those traveled <12.5 miles. This likely indicates that the patient 
population varied significantly as distance from the reporting facility changed. Hence, taking 
into account these other variables is important in estimating the effect of distance.
Overall, density level of radiation oncologists was not significantly associated with receipt 
of RT. For patients diagnosed at reporting facility, lower density level of radiation 
oncologists had a trend in decreasing likelihood of receiving RT but without statistical 
significance in every level (Supplementary Table 3). On the other hand, for patients 
diagnosed elsewhere, those resided in areas with no radiation oncologist had greater 
likelihood in receipt of RT (aOR 1.21, p=0.04). In addition, for patients diagnosed at 
reporting facility, those treated at comprehensive cancer program, academic cancer program 
and NCI program had greater likelihood in receiving RT while there was no difference in 
receipt of RT across facility types for patients diagnosed elsewhere. Patients who were

 uninsured but self-paid for their medical services, diagnosed elsewhere, or resided in the 
Midwest region had increased likelihood of receiving RT.
Discussion
In this study, we observed two distinguished treatment patterns in receipt of RT. Among 
patients diagnosed and treated at reporting facility, those traveled ≥50 miles were less likely 
to receive RT compared with those traveled <12.5 miles, all else being equal, and there was 
a trend observed between radiation oncologist density and receipt of RT. On the other hand, 
among patients diagnosed elsewhere but treated at reporting facility, traveling longer 
distance was not associated with decreasing likelihood of receiving RT.
Despite the fact that combined RT, with or without chemotherapy, plus surgery has been a 
consensus guideline treatment for stage II/III rectal cancer patients, only 70% of our study 
cohort received RT. For the majority of those not receiving RT, the reason given was 
redundantly that RT was not included as part of first course of treatment. Similar RT 
underuse among patients in the SEER registry with 32.35% of stage II/III rectal cancer 
patients not receiving RT was reported.2 Based on guidelines and expert opinion, the optimal 
utilization rate was estimated around 73.6% (±0.7%)25; however, the actual utilization rate 
was found lower.26, 27 Similar to previous studies,2, 27, 28 our study found that patients with 
older age, female sex and a diagnosis in earlier study years were associated with a decreased 
likelihood of receiving RT.
Possible explanations for underuse of RT include: referral to a radiation oncologist was not 
made, some radiation oncologists failed to follow treatment guidelines to deliver RT, and 
that these data under-report the use of RT given that NCDB is a hospital-based registry and 
outpatient RT might not be captured well. In a study evaluating completeness of NCDB 
treatment data by comparing with private payer claims in Ohio, NCDB captured 84% of RT 
in colorectal cases.29 Similar under-ascertainment of RT was also reported by studies using 
population-based cancer registry data.3031 Walker et al. reported that delay in the start of RT, 
residence in a newer cancer registry, advanced age or rural county were associated with 
under-ascertainment of RT. Therefore, even though CoC-accredited programs required 
facilities to capture all first course treatment, our study cannot rule out possible under-
ascertainment of RT use in the NCDB.
A substantial variation in the density of radiation oncologists across the country was 
observed in this study, which is consistent with previous findings.6, 7, 9, 32 Aneja et al. used 
the Area Resource File to examine geographic access to radiation oncologists.6, 7 They 
reported that radiation oncologist density varies regionally and were inequitably distributed, 
being primarily located in metropolitan areas and being absent in 66% of 2472 counties or 
44% of 949 Health Service Areas in the U.S. By using linked SEER-Medicare claims and 
the American Medical Association Masterfile, Baldwin et al. reported that one fourth of 
colorectal cancer patients did not have radiation oncology services available within 30 miles 
of their residence.9 Since radiation oncologists cannot deliver external beam RT without a 
linear accelerator, geographic distribution of facilities equipped with radiation delivery units 
can also provide insights into RT accessibility. By merging data from the Radiologic Physics

 Center, the Radiation Dosimetry Services, and the American Hospital Association and state 
health department, Ballas et al. identified 2246 unique radiation facilities in the U.S. and 
found that people in many rural areas would need to travel great distances to access RT.32
Despite geographical mal-distribution of radiation oncologists, radiation oncologist density 
was not statistically significantly associated with receipt of RT. It is likely that travel 
distance trumps density and that the clustering unit HSA does not accurately reflect referral/
travel patterns for RT. On the other hand, it is quite encouraging that a great proportion of 
patients who resided in areas with no radiation oncologist still received RT by traveling to 
areas with ≥1 radiation oncologists. Interestingly, they were more likely to travel to 
academic or NCI-designated cancer programs, which might not be the nearest RT facility. It 
is possible these patients were seeking care from providers perceived to have more 
experience or better quality of care.33, 34 However, some patients are unable to travel or 
obtain a referral. Our study showed that patients who were older, black, with comorbidities, 
uninsured or insured by Medicaid were less likely to change facility after diagnosis. Travel 
distance could be a barrier.
We found that travel distance to cancer treatment facility was a significant factor associated 
with decreased use of RT among rectal cancer patients diagnosed and treated at the same 
facility. Like the findings reported for other cancer diagnoses, traveling a long distance to 
cancer care decreased the likelihood of receiving standard treatment.10, 13, 15, 27, 35, 36 Onega 
et al. and Punglia et al. found that travel distance to a RT facility was associated with the 
selection of treatment. They found that early-stage breast cancer women were more likely to 
select mastectomy instead of breast-conserving surgery plus post-operative RT when travel 
distance to nearest RT facility was longer.13, 15 Mackillop et al.27 found that cancer patients 
who resided >50 km from the nearest RT center had significantly lower rate of receiving RT. 
In addition, travel burden varied between different race/ethnicities. Guidry et al. reported 
that non-white patients were more likely to consider transportation (e.g. distance and lack of 
transportation) as a barrier to cancer treatment and possibly forgo needed treatment.10 Onega 
et al. also found that black patients who resided in rural areas that required longer travel 
distance were less likely to access care, compared to rural whites.35 Based on simulation 
results in finding optimal locations for radiation, studies suggested adding new centers in 
underserved areas or non-centralized small-city to improve geographic access.37, 38
Our study has several limitations. First, the NCDB captures only patients who are diagnosed 
or treated in CoC-accredited facilities and may not be representative of all cancer patients in 
the United States. However, when comparing stage II/III rectal cancer patients reported by 
the NCDB and the SEER18 (Supplementary Table 4), most of patient demographic and 
clinical characteristics were similar, except race/ethnicity. The NCDB identified fewer 
patients with Hispanic Ethnicity than the SEER.39 Second, NCDB did not capture all RT 
locations to calculate travel distance. Since our entire study cohort made treatment decisions 
at reporting facilities and two-thirds received RT at reporting facility, travel distance to the 
reporting facility should be a sound proxy measure to estimate travel burden. Third, travel 
distance was measured between the centroids of ZIP codes of patient residence and reporting 
facility and might be underestimated if patient resided in the same ZIP code as the reporting

 facility. However, ZIP codes are the smallest geographic detail we can obtain for the study in 
order to protect patient privacy.
While many factors influence treatment decisions, geographic location is an important and 
potentially alterable factor that might affect treatment patterns. Further research in 
geographic access and establishing transportation assistance programs, or lodging services 
for patients with unmet need may help decrease geographic barriers and improve the quality 
of rectal cancer care.

 Summary
In a cohort of 26,845 stage II/III rectal cancer patients extracted from the National Cancer 
Data Base, we sought to examine the relationship between density of radiation oncologist 
and travel distance to receipt of radiation. Our findings showed that increased travel 
burden was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving radiation therapy when all 
else being equal, but radiation oncologist density was not.
