he 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in 
West Africa was the most widespread in history.1 The 
outbreak started in December 2013 in Guinea and rap-
idly expanded to other countries in the region, with > 11 000 
deaths in nearly 30 000 cases.2 At the onset of the outbreak, sev-
eral Ebola vaccines were under development; however, few had 
progressed to clinical trials.
An EVD vaccine, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, was developed at the 
Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health 
Agency of Canada using the live, attenuated recombinant vesic-
ular stomatitis virus (rVSV) backbone.3 Consequent to substitut-
ing its glycoprotein (GP) gene with that of a target pathogen, 
live, attenuated rVSV synthesizes and expresses foreign viral GP 
antigens, which subsequently induce cellular and humoral 
immunity.4 Wild-type VSV infects primarily cattle and horses, but 
rarely causes clinical infections in humans.5,6 In vivo, the rVSV is 
highly attenuated and nonpathogenic, with narrower cell tro-
pism than wild-type VSV;7,8 it replicates normally, expressing the

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The 2013–2016 Ebola 
virus outbreak in West Africa was the 
most widespread in history. In response, 
alive attenuated recombinant vesicular 
stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing 
Zaire Ebolavirus glycoprotein (rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP) was evaluated in humans.
METHODS: In a phase 1, randomized, 
dose-ranging, observer-blind, placebo-
controlled trial, healthy adults aged 
18–65 years were randomized into 4 
groups of 10 to receive one of 3 vaccine 
doses or placebo. Follow-up visits 
spanned 180 days postvaccination for 
safety monitoring, immunogenicity test-
ing and any rVSV virus shedding.
RESULTS: Forty participants were 
injected with rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine 
(n = 30) or saline placebo (n = 10). No 
serious adverse events related to the 
vaccine or participant withdrawals were 
reported. Solicited adverse events dur-
ing the 14-day follow-up period were 
mild to moderate and self-limited, with 
the exception of injection-site pain and 
headache. Viremia following vaccination 
was transient and no longer detectable 
after study day 3, with no virus shedding 
in saliva or urine. All vaccinated partici-
pants developed serum immunoglobulin 
G (IgG), as measured by Ebola virus 
envelope glycoprotein-based enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
Immunogenicity was comparable across 
all dose groups, and sustained IgG titers 
were detectable through to the last visit, 
at study day 180.
INTERPRETATION: In this phase 1 study, 
there were no safety concerns after a sin-
gle dose of rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. 
IgG ELISA showed persistent high titers at 
180 days postimmunization. There was a 
period of reactogenicity, but in general, 
the vaccine was well tolerated. This 
study provides evidence of the safety and 
immunogenicity of rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP 
vaccine and importance of its further 
investigation. Trial registration: Clinical-

imported GP that binds to host cell receptors and initiates 
immune responses.9
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP provides both pre- and postchallenge pro-
tection in animal models.10,11 In nonhuman primates, the vaccine 
was well tolerated12 and protective against lethal Zaire Ebola 
virus (ZEBOV) challenges following a single dose.13 The vaccine 
induced protective humoral and cellular immune responses in all 
vaccinated monkeys.14
As part of a coordinated, international effort to expeditiously 
evaluate candidate EVD vaccines and make them available to 
control the epidemic, we conducted a phase 1 trial of the rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP. The main objective of this coordinated partnership 
was to determine the lowest vaccine virus dose that would be 
safe and well tolerated, and induce an immune response.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a single-centre, randomized, observer-blind, dose-
ranging, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety (including 
rVSV viremia and shedding) and immune response after a single 
injection of one of 3 dose levels of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine.15

Healthy adult male and female volunteers aged 18 to 65 years were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 vaccine groups (1 × 
105 plaque-forming units [pfu], 5 × 105 pfu, and 3 × 106 pfu) or a pla-
cebo control group (Figure 1). A randomization list was computer 
generated with a block size of 8. Exclusions to enrolment included 
prior infection with a filovirus or VSV or risk of exposure to either; 
health care worker; child care worker or household contact with 
young children; pregnant or lactating women; immunocompro-
mised individuals; allergy or any adverse reactions to the vaccine 
components or other vaccines; underlying medical conditions; and 
abnormalities on screening tests. Participant screening included 
medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and 
blood testing, including complete blood count with white blood 
cell differential, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, 
serum metabolic panel, urine pregnancy screen (females only), 
viral serologies (hepatitis B, C, HIV) and urinalysis. The study was 
conducted at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology in Halifax 
(clinicaltrials.gov, no. NCT02374385).
Vaccine
The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is a live, attenuated recombinant virus 
in which the GP gene of VSV Indiana strain is replaced by that of the 
ZEBOV Kikwit 1995 strain. The vaccine was licensed to BioProtection 
Systems (NewLink Genetics Corporation) and more recently subli-
censed to Merck & Co., Inc. Vaccine product was compliant with good 
manufacturing practices, suspended in recombinant human serum 
albumin 2.5 g/L and 10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), dispensed at 1 × 108 pfu/mL 
per unit vial and stored at –70ºC (lot number 0030513). Preservative-
free normal saline was used as diluent (Alveda NaCl 0.9% lot number: 
13331012) to prepare lower doses. Placebo injections were 1 mL nor-
mal saline. Study pharmacists prepared allocated treatment; an 
unblinded nurse concealed and administered it. The pharmacists did 
not have any interaction with study partici-
pants or blinded study staff, and the unblinded 
nurse had no other role in the study.
Study procedures
Each participant was injected intramuscularly 
with 1 mL of vaccine or placebo. Participants 
were monitored at least 30 minutes postin-
jection for adverse events (AEs). Assessment 
visits occurred on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 
and 180. During the 14-day period after injec-
tion, solicited and unsolicited AEs were col-
lected using memory aids; subjects recorded 
temperature, injection-site reactions, serious 
adverse events (SAEs) or systemic reactoge-
nicity symptoms. Solicited symptoms 
included injection-site redness, swelling or 
pain; subjective and objective fever; chills; 
sweats; myalgia; arthralgia; fatigue; head-
ache; and gastrointestinal symptoms. There-
after, unsolicited AEs were documented on 
days 28, 56, 84 and 180. SAEs were monitored 
throughout the study. The investigator (SAH) 
assessed all AEs for causality.
The first volunteer was injected only after day 7 data from 
the first and lowest dose (3 × 106 pfu) cohort of a separate dose-
escalating Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) 
study16 were evaluated by the independent Data Safety Moni-
toring Board. This assured us that we could proceed with our 
dose-ranging design, as 3 × 106 pfu was the highest dose used 
in this study. Other safety measures included staggered vacci-
nation, follow-up, holding rules and safety monitoring for AEs 
and SAEs. The study was monitored by an Independent 
Research Monitor.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was vaccine safety and tolerability through 
assessment of injection-site events, AEs, SAEs at all visits, and 
hematologic and biochemical laboratory measures at days 0, 1, 3, 
7, 28 and 180, as well as testing for viremia and viral shedding on 
study days 0–14. Secondary outcomes were antibody measure-
ments on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 180 by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA), and days 0 and 28 by pseudovirion neu-
tralization assay (PsVNA) 50 and PsVNA80.
An ELISA using recombinant glycoprotein (rGP) from homolo-
gous Zaire-Kikwit strain as the solid phase assessed total anti-GP 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera (Battelle Biomedical Research 
Center, West Jefferson, OH), Battelle Standard Operating Proce-
dure, BBRC. X-127.17–19 A PsVNA measured neutralizing antibody 
responses to Ebola GP (US Army Medical Research Institute of 
Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, MD).16,20–24 This assay is based on 
non-replicating VSV expressing luciferase reporter protein parti-
cles pseudotyped with ZEBOV envelope glycoproteins.20 The 
assay determined the highest serum dilutions causing 50% 
(PsVNA50) and 80% (PsVNA80) inhibition of virus cell entry and 
expression of luciferase.

Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) was performed to identify vaccine rVSV in plasma, saliva 
or urine through amplification of the VSV-nucleoprotein gene.16
Routine hematologic, biochemistry and screening serology 
were performed at the IWK Health Centre using standard methods.

Categorical variables were summarized by number and percentage 
of participants within each category (with a category for missing 
data) of the parameter. For continuous variables, the number of par-
ticipants, mean (or geometric mean, where applicable), median, 
standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
geometric mean, minimum and maximum values were performed. 
Statistical hypothesis testing of primary and secondary immunoge-
nicity outcomes was conducted at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level; p 
values were not adjusted for multiplicity. Summary statistics were 
performed as well as 2-sided 95% CIs on selected parameters. An

compare log (base 10) transformed ZEBOV IgG concentrations (in 
ELISA units/mL); pairwise comparisons of antibody concentrations 
at analysis days 14, 28 and 180 between rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP dose lev-
els and between each rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP dose level with placebo 
were performed in the per-protocol population. The ELISA lower 
limit of quantification was 55.34 units/mL; samples with a concen-
tration at or below the lower limit of quantification were entered as 
27.67 for statistical analysis. PsVNA positivity was defined by titers of 
20 or higher; values < 20 were assigned 10 for calculation. For both 
assays, seroconversion was defined as at least 4-fold increase from 
baseline titer. Antibody titer calculations were on the log10 scale. 
Summaries were provided for each vaccine dose and for placebo.
All descriptive statistical analyses were generated using SAS 
software version 9.3 or later. (SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc.

were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 17.0. Concomitant medications were coded 
using the most recently available version of the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary.

Written, informed consent was obtained before any study proce-
dure. The protocol was approved by Health Canada and the

Results
Study participants
A total of 40 participants were vaccinated between Nov. 27 and 
Dec. 15, 2014 (Table 1). Mean age was 35.6 years (range 18–62) 
among vaccine recipients, and 32.0 years 
(range 20–50) among placebo recipients; 23 
were female (57.5%). All participants 
completed follow-up visits (Figure 1).
Safety
There were no SAEs related to the vaccine or 
withdrawals from the study. The 3 SAE 
reports from 2 study subjects were choleli-
thiasis in a recipient of 5 × 105 pfu vaccine, 
and psychotic disorder and major depres-
sion in a placebo recipient. All were assessed 
as being unrelated to the vaccine, and were 
resolved. Reports of AEs solicited from the 
participants were primarily characterized as 
mild to moderate, with 3 separate severe 
events: headache and diarrhea in the 5 × 105 
group, and fatigue in the 3 × 106 group. 
Headache was the most frequent systemic 
reaction overall (Figure 2). There were no 
reports of injection-site swelling or redness; 
only mild to moderate pain was noted 
locally. In the first day postvaccination, there 
was higher incidence of injection-site pain in 
vaccine recipients compared with placebo. Incidence of injection-
site pain was 0%, 30% and 80% in the 1 × 105 pfu, 5 × 105 pfu and 3 × 
106 pfu cohorts, respectively, and 20% in placebo. 
Arthralgia and myalgia had a similar trend, with frequency on 
the first day postvaccination higher in vaccine than in placebo 
recipients. Arthralgia was reported in 10%, 0% and 50% in the 1 × 
105 pfu, 5 × 105 pfu, and 3 × 106 pfu dose cohorts, respectively, 
and 0 in placebo; and the incidence of myalgia was 20%, 0% and 
40% in the 1 × 105 pfu, 5 × 105 pfu and 3 × 106 pfu cohorts, respec-
tively, and 10% in placebo. Onset of systemic solicited AEs 
ranged from as early as the day of injection to 14 days thereafter, 
lasting 1 to 9 days. Objective fever was not measured in any of 
the participants. A grade 1 subjective fever (3.3%) was reported 
by 1 participant who received the 3 × 106 pfu dose, and 2 placebo 
recipients reported grade 1 and grade 2 subjective fever.
Overall, 60% of vaccinees reported unsolicited AEs, yet the 
incidence of each event was not greater than 2 subjects in any 
treatment arm (data not shown). Unsolicited AEs were mostly 
mild to moderate, except a report of severe arthralgia that 
started at day 18 and lasted 1 day, with no objective signs of 
arthritis upon immediate examination. No cases of arthritis were 
observed; however, 1 subject receiving the 3 × 106 pfu dose 
reported grade 1 joint swelling for 14 days, starting at day 13 
postvaccination.
Detection of viremia and virus shedding by PCR
Two participants in the 3 × 106 pfu group developed viremia by the 
first day postvaccination, which continued to day 3 for 1 of them. 
Overall, viremia peaked on study day 3, when 18 (60%) of the 30 
vaccinated participants were positive, with the greatest frequency 
in the highest dose group. All subsequent samples were negative 
(Table 2). There was no virus shedding in saliva or urine.

Immunogenicity
ZEBOV rGP ELISA
Seroconversions were observed by day 14 in all 3 vaccine dose 
groups, 4 of 10 (40%) who received the 1 × 105 pfu, 2 of 10 (20%) 
who received the 5 × 105 pfu, and 4 of 10 (40%) who received the 
3 × 106 pfu doses (Table 3). By day 28, seroconversions had 
increased to 7 of 10 (70%) who received the 1 × 105 pfu or 5 × 105 
pfu, and all 10 (100%) who received the 3 × 106 pfu doses. With 
the exception of 1 subject in the 1 × 105 pfu group, all vaccinees 
showed seroconversion at some point during the course of the 
study. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) increased over time from 
day 0 to day 180, with the exception of a decrease in the 3 × 106 
pfu dose group from day 28 to day 180. At day 28, there was a 
nonsignificant trend to higher GMTs in the 3 × 106 pfu group 
compared with the low and medium doses (p = 0.071 and p = 
0.054, respectively). Serum IgG titers at study day 180 remained 
significantly higher in all 3 dose groups compared with placebo. 
GMT responses were similar in the 1 × 105 pfu and 5 × 105 pfu 
dose groups.

PsVNA titers
Seroconversion by day 28 using PsVNA50 was noted in 8 of 10 
(80%) volunteers in the 1 × 105 and 5 × 105 pfu groups, and in 7 of 
10 (70%) of the volunteers in the 3 × 106 group (Figure 3). On day 
28, seroconversion by PsVNA80 was less, with rates of 20% (2 of 
10 volunteers) in the 1 × 105 and 5 × 105 pfu groups, and in 1 of 10 
(10%) of the volunteers in the 3 × 106 group. No difference was 
observed at baseline between vaccine groups and placebo.
Interpretation
In this phase 1 study, all 3 dose levels of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP live, 
attenuated vaccine were well tolerated by participants and no 
safety concerns were identified. Solicited AEs were primarily 
characterized as mild to moderate, with only 3 severe events 
(headache and diarrhea in the 5 × 105 pfu group; fatigue in the 3 
× 106 pfu group). Arthralgia during the first 14 days post-
vaccination was infrequent and not severe. Arthritis was not 
reported. Viremia was transient, with no detection of vaccine 
virus shedding in urine or saliva. In the subset of vaccinees who 
developed viremia, the incidence of frequently reported solic-
ited AEs was similar or moderately increased compared with 
other vaccinated subjects overall. The vaccine was immuno-
genic, eliciting glycoprotein-binding antibodies in recipients of 
all 3 doses. In this report, we provide the first extended post-
vaccination serology assessments and show that antibody 
titers persist at high levels 180 days postimmunization.
A phase 1, dose-escalation trial at WRAIR enrolled participants 
to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 3 × 106 pfu and 2 × 107 
pfu doses.16 At the United States National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) Clinical Center, a 2-dose regimen was evaluated using these 
2 dose levels.16 The VSV Ebola Consortium25 conducted 4 parallel 
phase 1 trials at sites within Europe and Africa.24 Three of the 4 tri-
als were open label, uncontrolled and dose escalating, designed 
to assess the safety, AEs and immunogenicity of rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP doses ranging from 3 × 105 to 2 × 107 pfu. The fourth 
trial, in Geneva, initially administered the 1 × 107 pfu and 5 × 107 
pfu vaccine doses, but was put on hold as a result of a 25% (13 of 
51) and 22% (11 of 51) incidence of fever and oligoarthritis with 
these 2 doses, respectively. After preliminary data indicated toler-
ability and immunogenicity of low vaccine doses in other studies, 
the study was resumed in Geneva, but at a lower dose of 3 × 105 
pfu, comparing outcomes to those of vaccinees who had received 
the higher doses before the study was put on hold.26
Patterns of detectable viremia were comparable with other 
studies that investigated the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine; viremia 
was transient, peaking by day 3 and no longer evident on day 
7.16,24,26 Glycoprotein-binding serum antibodies were detectable 
in all vaccinated individuals, irrespective of vaccine dose. 
Although neutralizing antibody titers were detected among most 
participants of our study, a dose response was not evident. A sig-
nificant dose response for neutralizing antibody titers was not 
observed in the WRAIR phase 1 trial comparing 3 × 106 versus 2 × 
107 pfu dose, but was observed in the larger VSV Ebola Consor-
tium studies comparing multiple doses between 3 × 105 and 5 × 
107 pfu dose with higher vaccine doses.16,24,26 Unlike higher doses 
of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine,24 the dose levels tested in our 
study were minimally reactogenic, which confirms the tolerabil-
ity of low-dose rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccination.16,24,26 There were 
no reports of arthritis among our cohort for the 180-day follow-
up period, similar to published trials from WRAIR and NIH.16 
Reports of arthritis with overlapping and higher doses of the vac-
cine suggest an intrinsic association with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, and 
not only a dose-dependent one.24,26

The multiple phase 1 rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP trials across North 
America (United States and Canada), Europe (Switzerland and 
Germany) and nonepidemic regions of Africa (Gabon and Kenya) 
have shown that the vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic, 
and warrants further study. The range of doses administered in 
this study were assessed along with those in the WRAIR and NIH 
studies and together used to select the optimum dose to be eval-
uated in the phase 2/3 trials. Currently, there are 4 ongoing 
phase 2/3 studies: a phase 2 placebo-controlled trial in Liberia, 
sponsored by the US NIH; a phase 3 ring vaccination trial in 
Guinea, sponsored by the World Health Organization; a phase 3 
trial in Sierra Leone, sponsored by the US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention; and a phase 3 immunogenicity, safety 
and lot consistency trial in North America and Europe, sponsored 
by Merck. As part of an African–Canadian collaboration, prepara-
tions for a phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and immunogenic-
ity of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in HIV-infected adults and adolescents 
are underway with the intent to begin enrolling in 2017.
There are several candidate Ebola vaccines at different 
stages of development and testing.27 The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP 
vaccine is the first to progress to phase 3 trials in Africa after 
data from the 8 phase 1 studies, including this one, collectively 
determined that 2 × 107 pfu is a favourable dose. Other vac-
cines include the Ad26-EBOV and MVA-EBOV by Johnson & 
Johnson and Bavarian Nordic, which have entered phase 2 and 
3 trials. The recombinant protein Ebola vaccine by Novavax 
and Monovalent Ebola Zaire Vaccine (rVSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1) by 
Profectus BioSciences Inc. are being assessed in phase 1 trials. 
The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3) is 
completing phase 2 studies.28–30
Limitations
Limitations of this study are primarily the small sample size, 
overall and per group, and the fact that only participants from 
North America were enrolled. Another limitation is the lack of 
follow-up after six months for long-term immunogenicity data.
Conclusion
Ebola transmission in Africa is now considered to be under con-
trol.2,31 However, recent clusters of cases are still being reported 
as a result of virus spread from shedding survivors, and more are 
anticipated, with the virus still present in sub-Saharan Africa’s 
ecosystem.32 These facts underscore the importance of continu-
ing efforts and collaborations that may ultimately lead to licensed 
Ebola vaccines that would protect humans and prevent or control 
outbreaks in the future. Our study confirms the immunogenicity 
and tolerability of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, and provides 
new information about duration of the antibody response.
