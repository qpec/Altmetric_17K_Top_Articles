Abstract
Objective: This study determined whether two different formulations of hormone therapy (HT): oral conjugated
equine estrogens (o-CEE; 0.45 mg/d, n ¼ 209), transdermal 17b-estradiol (t-E2; 50 mg/d, n ¼ 201) plus cyclic
progesterone (Prometrium, 200 mg) or placebo (PBO, n ¼ 243) affected sleep domains in participants of the Kronos
Early Estrogen Prevention Study.
Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline and during the intervention at 6, 18,
36, and 48 months. Global sleep quality and individual sleep domain scores were compared between treatments using
analysis of covariance, and correlated with vasomotor symptom (VMS) scores using Spearman correlation coefficients.
Results: Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (mean 6.3; 24% with score >8) were similar across groups
at baseline and were reduced (improved sleep quality) by both HT (average change �1.27 [o-CEE] and �1.32 [t-
E2]) when compared with PBO (�0.60; P ¼ 0.001 [o-CEE vs PBO] and P ¼ 0.002 [t-E2 vs PBO]). Domain scores
for sleep satisfaction and latency improved with both HT. The domain score for sleep disturbances improved more
with t-E2 than o-CEE or PBO. Global sleep scores significantly correlated with VMS severity (rs ¼ 0.170, P < 0.001
for hot flashes; rs ¼ 0.177, P < 0.001 for night sweats). Change in scores for all domains except sleep latency and
sleep efficiency correlated with change in severity of VMS.
Conclusions: Poor sleep quality is common in recently menopausal women. Sleep quality improved with both
HT formulations. The relationship of VMS with domains of sleep suggests that assessing severity of symptoms and
domains of sleep may help direct therapy to improve sleep for postmenopausal women.

 Menopause Society posits that about 73% of postmenopausal
women report vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (ie, hot flashes
and night sweats). VMS may also be a risk factor for
future cardiovascular disease.3,4 Hormone therapy (HT) is an
effective treatment for common VMS, and also for alleviation
of some sleep problems during menopause.5-7 Many studies
have evaluated the relationships among HT, sleep, and VMS in
perimenopausal women.8-10 It is difficult overall to disentangle
age-related worsening of sleep from menopause-driven change
in sleep. In one 14-year longitudinal examination of the meno-
pausal transition, no strong relationship between menopause
and worsening sleep was observed. However, a small group
of ‘‘at-risk’’ women were identified who had poor sleep at
baseline, and who reported VMS.11 This group of women was
most likely to have acute worsening of their sleep as they
traversed the menopause. In agreement with this body of
research, a systematic appraisal of the literature suggests that
onlya subgroupofwomenwithconcomitantVMSmayderivea
modest improvement in sleep from HT.12 Therefore, questions
remain regarding the association of domains of sleep (sleep
disturbances compared with overall sleep quality) in relation-
ship to VMS in menopause and HT.13,14
There are three major difficulties in assessing the relation-
ships between VMS, HT, and sleep. First, a variety of HT
formulations, doses, and routes of administration are used to
treat menopausal symptoms, making comparisons among
studies difficult. No studies have compared the effectiveness
of two types of HT on their relationship to alleviation of VMS
and domains of sleep. The second difficulty emanates from a
heterogeneity in the tools used to evaluate and characterize
sleep.15 Clinically, poor sleep quality is defined as perceived
sleep problems that are bothersome, but do not meet criteria
for a clinical sleep disorder.16,17 However, poor sleep quality
may be comprised of different factors, or domains, for differ-
ent individuals; therefore, a standard tool that measures sleep
through multiple domains allows for optimal characterization
of sleep quality15 and may provide a better insight into the
associations between alleviation of VMS and sleep in meno-
pausal women. A third difficulty is that self-reported changes
in VMS may not accurately reflect their frequency, duration,
and severity.18-20
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of two
formulations of HT on self-reported sleep quality and sleep
domains using the broadly accepted Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI); and to assess the relationship between the
changes in global sleep quality, and the domains of sleep
with VMS for each HT formulation compared with placebo
(PBO) in recently menopausal women enrolled in the Kronos
Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS).
METHODS
Participants
The KEEPS (NCT00154180)—a randomized, double-
blind, PBO-controlled multisite trial—enrolled women from
the communities surrounding each recruitment site who were
between the ages of 42 and 58 years, between 6 and 36 months
since their last menses, and had serum follicle-stimulating
hormone level �35 mIU/mL and/or estradiol level <40 pg/
mL. Women were excluded if they had a coronary artery
calcium score of >50 Agatston Units, history of cardiovas-
cular disease, body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m2, uncon-
trolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >150 mm Hg
and/or diastolic blood pressure >95 mm Hg), low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) >190 mg/dL, triglycerides
(Tg) >400 mg/dL, fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dL (or
history of diabetes), current or recent (6 months) use of
cholesterol-lowering medications (statins, fibrate, or >500mg/d
niacin), if they reported smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day,
or had a diagnosis of clinical depression. The study was approved
by Institutional Review Boards at each participating institution.
All participants were recruited and all gave written informed
consent. The study design and methods have been described in
detail elsewhere.21
Study design
Participants (n ¼ 727) were randomized (4:4:5 ratio) to
either oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE; Premarin,
0.45 mg/d) plus a PBO transdermal patch (n ¼ 230), transder-
mal 17b-estradiol (t-E2; Climara 50 mg/d) plus a PBO pill
(n ¼ 222), or PBO pills and patch (n ¼ 275). Women in the
active treatment groups also received oral micronized pro-
gesterone (Prometrium, 200 mg) for the first 12 days of each
month, whereas women in the PBO group received a PBO
capsule for the first 12 days of each month.
The randomization sequence generation was done using a
random number table. Study drugs were supplied to the
clinical sites identified only by the participant’s ID number,
with both research participants and investigators blinded to
treatment. Treatment was given for 4 years. Participants at all
sites were invited to complete the PSQI before randomization
(baseline) and then at 6, 18, 36, and 48-month study visits,
which coincided with cognitive testing (NCT00623311).22,23
Changes in the domains of sleep were not prespecified out-
comes from the main KEEPS protocol, but including the PSQI
questionnaire to the study visits was approved as an ancillary
study to the main protocol.
Outcomes
PSQI for sleep parameters
The PSQI is a brief self-report, nine multi-item question-
naire, assessing seven domains of sleep quality: sleep satis-
faction,
sleep
latency,
sleep
duration,
habitual
sleep
efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications,
and staying awake during daytime activities (daytime dys-
function).24 The PSQI has strong reliability and validity, in
both clinical and nonclinical samples.25
Each of the seven domains of sleep is clinically relevant for
evaluating sleep and is scored from a range of 0 to 3 points:
0 ¼ no difficulty, 3 ¼ severe difficulty.24 The global sleep
score represents a summation of the individual sleep domain
scores 0 to 21. Poor sleep quality was defined by a PSQI
global score >8, which is the clinical threshold for requiring

 complete somnological evaluation.26 Analyses were per-
formed on PSQI global scores and on six out of seven
individual domains: sleep satisfaction, sleep latency, habitual
sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep duration, and day-
time dysfunction. Use of medication was not included in the
present analysis, because the mean baseline score for this
domain was 0.61, with 69% of the participants (71% in PBO,
67% in t-E2, and 68% in o-CEE) reporting not taking med-
ications for sleep in the previous month. Caffeine intake was
not recorded.
Vasomotor symptom scale
To assess the burden of hot flashes and night sweats over
time, participants completed a questionnaire reporting symp-
toms of hot flashes and night sweats over the past 3 months,
ranking symptoms on a 4-point Likert scale as none (0), mild
(1), moderate (2), or severe (3). As reported previously,27
these symptoms were evaluated retrospectively at baseline
and annually during the study period, with an average score
calculated and compared with baseline for each symptom.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive
statistics
on
baseline
characteristics
are
reported as number and percentage for categorical variables
(which were dichotomized), and as mean and standard devia-
tion (SD) for continuous variables. Baseline comparisons
between randomized treatment groups were performed using
Pearson’s chi-square test or analysis of variance, as appropri-
ate. The study outcomes of interest included the PSQI global
score (0-21) and six preselected domain scores (0-3), and also
two menopausal symptom severity scores (0-3). To describe
the treatment response for each outcome treated as a continu-
ous variable, repeated measurements were reduced into a
single measure of response by computing the average score
per participant during the treatment period and subtracting
their baseline value. Since changes in the outcome variables
were generally observed early at 6-month assessment and
sustained through the study visits at 48 months, it was
reasoned that the average change provides an adequate sum-
mary of the response and makes better use of available
information than the change computed at a single follow-
up time. To augment the description of PSQI global scores in
this study, the measured continuous scale was also dichoto-
mized at a clinically relevant threshold score of >8 to indicate
poor sleep quality.28
Formal comparison of the change in response between
treatments
was
performed
via
analysis
of
covariance
(ANCOVA) using all available follow-up measurements, with
use of the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method to
account for correlation among the repeated measures on
participants. One ANCOVA model was fit to each outcome
variable, with the follow-up score included as the dependent
variable, treatment group as the primary independent variable,
and baseline score as the covariate. Study site was included in
the models as an additional adjusting covariate. Race was not
included as a covariate as the majority of participants were
white by self-report and ancestry genotype.29,30 To avoid
deletion of a small subset of individuals lacking a baseline
PSQI measurement (n ¼ 38), the mean baseline value of the
combined sample was imputed for these individuals. Each
ANCOVA model yielded a least squares mean estimate of the
baseline-adjusted change within treatment group, presented as
mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). Treatment group
differences in these adjusted changes were assessed by testing
the group term in the model for significance, using an omni-
bus 2 degree of freedom test; individual pair-wise compar-
isons were carried out only if the overall test revealed
evidence
of
any
statistically
significant
difference
(if
P � 0.05). An analogous model based on the GEE formulation
of logistic regression was used for the binary PSQI outcome to
test whether the change in rate of poor sleep quality differed
between treatment groups after adjustment for baseline rate.
Secondary analyses were performed to assess the relation
between changes in PSQI scores (global and individual domain
scores) and changes in the menopausal symptom scores based
on the partial Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rs),
which were adjusted for treatment group. The same method
was used to perform a post hoc subgroup analysis to assess the
correlation between changes in sleep quality and changes in
menopausal symptoms in women who reported moderate to
severe hot flashes and night sweats (score 2 or 3 on VMS scale)
at baseline. All analyses were carried out in SAS software
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
In all, 727 women were enrolled in the KEEPS, with 275
randomly assigned to PBO, 230 to oral (o-CEE), and 222 to
transdermal (t-E2) treatments. Baseline clinical parameters
and menopausal symptoms (Table 1), and also education
status, incomes, marital status, and number of term pregnan-
cies27,31 were similar among treatment assignments and were
not different from women excluded from the main KEEPS
protocol.29 For the primary analysis, the effects of treatment
on aspects of sleep were assessed on 653 (90%) participants
who completed the PSQI at one or more study visits during the
4-year intervention period (Fig. 1). To examine the potential
for selection bias, the 653 PSQI respondents were compared
with the remaining 74 KEEPS participants who did not
complete the PSQI, and no significant differences were found
in baseline clinical parameters (results not shown).
PSQI global score
At baseline, PSQI global score did not differ significantly
among treatment groups (Table 2). Overall, 24% of partic-
ipants (22% PBO, 21% t-E2, and 28% o-CEE) had poor sleep
quality (global scores >8) at study entry. Compared with
baseline values, each of the two HT groups and the PBO group
showed a reduction in average PSQI global scores over 4 years
of treatment (each P < 0.001). The average reduction in the
global score was similar between the two hormone-treated
groups (average change of �1.27 [o-CEE] and �1.32 [t-E2]

 points), and both were significantly greater than that in the
PBO group (�0.60 points; P ¼ 0.001 [o-CEE vs PBO] and
P ¼ 0.002 [t-E2 vs PBO]; Table 2). Similarly, the percentage
of women with poor sleep quality (PSQI global score >8)
decreased with t-E2 (from 21% to 9%; P < 0.001) and o-CEE
(from 28% to 16%; P < 0.001), with a smaller decline with
PBO (from 22% to 17%; P ¼ 0.06). When compared with
PBO, the reduction in the percentage of women with poor
sleep quality (ie, the number of women with improved sleep
quality)
was
significantly
greater
in
the
t-E2
group
(P ¼ 0.003) and modestly but not significantly greater in
the o-CEE group (P ¼ 0.07).
PSQI individual domains score
Compared with baseline scores, significant improvements
in all six domain scores were observed during treatment
within each group, with the exception of sleep latency in
the PBO group (P ¼ 0.06; Table 2). The average improvement
in score differed between treatments for three out of the six
domains (sleep satisfaction, sleep latency, and sleep distur-
bances), with each of these three domains showing signifi-
cantly greater improvement in one or both of the HT groups
when compared with PBO (Fig. 2). Among the three domains,
only sleep disturbances showed a statistically significant
difference between the two HT formulations (P ¼ 0.029),
with t-E2 improving more during follow-up than o-CEE
(Table 2). There were no significant differences between
groups for the changes in domain scores pertaining to sleep
efficiency (P ¼ 0.45), sleep duration (P ¼ 0.38), or daytime
dysfunction (P ¼ 0.26) across follow-up.

scores of hot flashes and night sweats were significantly
reduced by both HT formulations when compared with PBO
(P < 0.001 for both), with no difference between the o-CEE
and t-E2 groups (P ¼ 0.343 and P ¼ 0.919, respectively;

662 respondents (n ¼ 243 [PBO], 205 [t-E2], 214 [o-CEE]); to describe the treatment responses, repeated measurements were summarized by the average
score per woman during the treatment period, whereas comparisons between treatments utilized all serial data points available via repeated measures
analysis (see ‘‘Methods’’ section for details).
Treatment groups were tested for a difference in response in ANCOVA models that included site and baseline score as covariates, with the GEE method
used to account for within-participant correlation from repeated measurements. From each ANCOVA, the three-level treatment effect was screened for
significance and only when such evidence was revealed did we proceed with post hoc testing of pair-wise group differences.

correlated positively with change in severity. In addition to
the domains of sleep latency and sleep efficiency, the domain

 P ¼ 0.004 adjusting for changes in night sweats). Controlling
for the effects of treatment, the associations between the
change in each VMS and change in sleep remained significant
as well (P ¼ 0.002 for hot flashes and P ¼ 0.029 for night
sweats).
Post hoc VMS subgroup analysis
At baseline, 226 women reported having moderate to
severe night sweats, and 279 women (some overlap with
those having moderate to severe night sweats) reported having
moderate to severe hot flashes. In these respective subgroups
of women, there were significant and positive correlations of
changes in the global PSQI score, with changes in severity of
night sweats (rs ¼ 0.181, P ¼ 0.002) and with changes in
severity of hot flashes (rs ¼ 0.207, P ¼ 0.002; Table 3). In
contrast to the results obtained on the overall set of partic-
ipants, improvement in sleep latency in these women with
moderate/severe symptoms correlated significantly with re-
duced severity of hot flashes (rs ¼ 0.137, P ¼ 0.022) and night
sweats (rs ¼ 0.147, P ¼ 0.028); in addition, sleep duration
correlated more strongly with reduced severity of hot flashes
(rs ¼ 0.239,
P < 0.001)
and
night
sweats
(rs ¼ 0.169,
P ¼ 0.011). In models adjusting for HT, the association
between average changes in VMS and the average change
in PSQI global score remained significant in both VMS
subgroups (both P < 0.001). In contrast, the association of
treatment with average change in PSQI global score was
attenuated and no longer significant in both subgroups after
adjustment for the average change in the corresponding VMS
(P ¼ 0.525 and 0.128 from partial tests of treatment effects in
the subgroup with baseline hot flashes and with baseline night
flashes, respectively).
DISCUSSION
In a population of a majority of white recently menopausal
women, improvements in sleep quality were observed with
the use of low-dose HT (oral and transdermal) over a 4-year
period. The global sleep score indicative of sleep quality in
women at baseline is consistent with what has been reported
for population-based studies.2 The average change in the
global sleep score during treatment was a reduction of about
1.3 points in both groups randomized to HT. The magnitude of
change in sleep score with HT was about twice as great as that
reported by the PBO group (0.06), which is consistent with
effects of HT on sleep reported in other studies.12
A second finding of the present study is that changes in
sleep quality correlated with changes in VMS (hot flashes and
night sweats)—a finding that persisted after controlling for
treatment assignment to HT and consistent with other stud-
ies.10 However, a multivariable analysis on the overall set of
women demonstrated significant partial effects of both treat-
ment and change in VMS, indicating the alleviation of VMS
does not fully account for the improved sleep outcomes
among those assigned to HT and suggesting that HT affects
other mechanisms associated with sleep. A causal relationship
between these factors is hard to establish, as there is a
bidirectional relationship of perceived sleep quality and
VMS, in that poor sleep quality is both a consequence of
VMS and also an influence on the extent to which VMS are
perceived as bothersome. Some insight into why HT may
affect sleep through mechanisms other than alleviation of
VMS is provided by the subanalysis of the relationship
between symptom relief and sleep domains in women report-
ing moderate/severe VMS at baseline. In these women, unlike
the entire set of women, the association between the change in
symptom severity and the change in PSQI score was attenu-
ated and no longer significant after adjustment for treatment.
These results suggest that in women with moderate to severe
symptoms, but not in those with none to mild, the effects of
HT on sleep are mediated through symptom relief—a finding
consistent with conclusions of the recent meta-analysis of
other studies of sleep, VMS, and HT.12
A third finding of the present study is the direct comparison
between two formulations and doses of HT, which are com-
monly used in clinical practice, on sleep domains. The majority
of previous sleep studies evaluated o-CEE at 0.625mg/d.12 In
the present study, following clinical guidelines that followed
the cessation of the Women’s Health Initiative in 2002 for use
of lower doses of HT,32 0.425mg/d of o-CEE was used in
KEEPS when it was designed in 2004. Although overall sleep
quality was improved with HT, not all domains of sleep
showed significant change averaged across the treatment
period. The finding that t-E2 was more efficacious than
o-CEE in alleviating sleep disturbances may be related to
the pharmacokinetics of these two formulations. Transdermal
E2islikelytoprovidemore consistent24-hourestradioldosing,
whereas o-CEE may engender daytime peaks and night-time
troughs if women took their o-CEE in the morning, thus,
leading to less relief of sleep disturbances. In the entire group,
sleep efficiency and sleep duration were not affected by either
HT, reflecting, perhaps, that other factors such as life circum-
stances may impact these domains, especially in women who
do not report moderate to severe symptoms.
Unlike what has been reported in other studies,12 daytime
dysfunction was not improved by HT in the KEEPS cohort.
This difference may be explained, in part, by a lower preva-
lence of women with poor sleep quality (global score >8) in
the present study sample (24% at baseline) compared with
other studies.33,34 In addition, the majority of participants in
the KEEPS were white and recently menopausal as confirmed
by strict criteria, whereas in other studies, women were more
often of mixed ethnicity and were perimenopausal and also
postmenopausal. The possibility that doses or formulations of
HT directly influence specific domains of sleep apart from
changes in VMS in women of different ethnicities and ages
will require additional study.
There are difficulties in comparing self-reported sleep
outcomes among clinical trials due to heterogeneity among
the available questionnaires and the absence of objective
testing.12 For example, self-reported sleep tools may include
validated and nonvalidated scales, single-item or multiple-
items measures, visual analog scales, and diaries such that

 clinical applicability of results in various reports to clinical
management is uncertain.35 Yet, the use of sleep architecture
measurements (polysomnography, wrist actigraphy) does not
always correlate with perceived sleep quality,36,37 and due to
costs and accessibility, these tests have limited applicability in
large population settings. Therefore, self-report instruments
remain crucial in the clinical assessment of outcomes after
interventions to improve sleep. In studies of menopause, self-
report instruments may allow clinicians to evaluate who might
benefit from HT for sleep and who might benefit from
additional clinical assessment, such as testing for sleep apnea.
Although the PSQI contains questions regarding symptoms of
snoring and stopping breathing during the night, the responses
to these questions are included in an overall score for sleep
disturbances and may not provide accurate information re-
garding sleep apnea for those individuals who sleep alone.
However, the answers to these questions may provide infor-
mation for the individual physician who examines the ques-
tionnaire for their individual patient.
This present study has a number of strengths. Evaluating
the recently menopausal women enrolled in KEEPS allowed
many of the deficiencies of the prior literature to be
addressed. First, KEEPS was a randomized clinical trial
enrolling a large number of well-characterized and otherwise
healthy, recently menopausal women meeting the standard
and stringent clinical and biochemical criteria for meno-
pause. In addition, the design allowed for a direct comparison
between the two modalities of menopausal HT commonly
used in current clinical practice—o-CEE and t-E2. The
differences in pharmacokinetics and dynamics between the
products may help to direct clinical decisions related to which
formulation best meets the women’s needs. A second strength
of the study is the use of a validated tool for self-reporting
global sleep quality and domains of sleep. The PQSI provided
important qualitative information on the domains of sleep
that cannot be obtained by laboratory analysis with important
implications for women whose major sleep complaints relate
to their ability to fall asleep, sleep disturbances, and overall
sleep satisfaction. Because data regarding VMS was by self-
report, responses of symptom severity are susceptible to
misclassification bias and may under or over-represent the
symptoms. However, the associations between sleep and
symptom severity are, to our knowledge, the first reported
with use of low doses and two different routes of two different
estrogen products in the same study. A limitation of the
present study is that other stressors related to sleep quality
such as marital, employment and socioeconomic status,
allergies, caffeine intake, and numbers of children in the
home were not considered. Although the study could be
criticized for eliminating the domain of sleep medication,
the use of such medications was low at baseline, limiting
statistical power, and their use is not well-established with
health outcomes.15 Additionally, no clinical assessments
were obtained regarding other potential confounders of sleep
such as emotional stress, obstructive sleep apnea, or restless
leg syndrome. As with other studies, it is important not to
generalize the results of this study to other groups not defined
by the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
CONCLUSIONS
In recently menopausal women, the overall sleep quality
was improved by both HT regimens compared with PBO, with
the transdermal estrogen formulation performing modestly
better than the oral formulation. Of the studied sleep domains,
sleep satisfaction, disturbances, and duration were improved,
with sleep disturbances more improved by t-E2 than by o-
CEE. Domains of sleep latency, efficiency, and daytime
dysfunction were not affected by the HT regimes used in
this study. Alleviation of VMS was associated with improve-
ments in overall sleep quality. This result in not an unexpected
outcome as it is common to use amelioration of VMS as a
clinical guide to treatment. In a subset of women reporting
moderate to severe VSM at baseline, reduced symptoms also
correlated with improvement in the domain of sleep latency.
These findings suggest that at least one way to approach the
use of HT for sleep complaints is to assess the severity of
VMS, and perhaps explore additional underlying problems
affecting sleep, for example, obstructive sleep apnea.
Sleep disorders in midlife women warrant evaluation be-
cause treatment can lead to substantial improvements in quality
of life andhealthoutcomes.1,17These resultsfrom a sufficiently
powered, randomized clinical trial suggest that fostering a
conversation about sleep quality, and sleep domains during
clinical encounters may be a more appropriate guide for
a patient-centered approach for achieving optimal sleep
health.
