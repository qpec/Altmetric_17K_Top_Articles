Abstract Background:Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has agonist activity at various serotonin
(5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific
receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown. Methods: We therefore
conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study (ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT02451072) during which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii)
placebo+LSD (100 mg po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist,+LSD. We
quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method
and compared it to cortical gene expression maps. Findings: LSD reduced associative, but
concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully
blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched
5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans. Conclusion: Together, these results strongly
implicate the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD’s neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the
critical role of 5-HT2A in LSD’s mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational
development of psychedelic-based therapeutics. Funding: Swiss National Science Foundation

Introduction
Disorders of perception and the form and content of thought are important contributors to the
global burden of disease (Murray et al., 2012). Mechanistic studies of consciousness may be under-
taken using psychedelic drugs as pharmacologic probes of molecular signaling within cortical net-
works underlying perception and thought. In particular, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a

 psychedelic drug with predominantly agonist activity at serotonin (5-HT)2A/C, �1A/B, �6, and �7
and dopamine D2 and D1 receptors (R). Its administration produces characteristic alterations in per-
ception, mood, thought, and the sense of self (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2002; Nichols, 2004).
Despite its powerful effects on consciousness, human research on LSD neurobiology stalled in the
late 1960s because of a narrow focus on the experiential effects of hallucinogenic drugs, combined
with a lack of understanding of its effects on molecular signaling mechanisms in the brain. However,
renewed interest in the potentially beneficial clinical effects of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2016a; Gasser et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2016) warrants a better understanding of their underly-
ing neuropharmacology. Nevertheless, major knowledge gaps remain regarding LSD’s neurobiology
in humans as well as its time-dependent receptor neuropharmacology.
To address this critical gap, the current study aims to comprehensively map time-dependent
pharmacological effects of LSD on neural functional connectivity in healthy human adults and com-
pare them to the spatial expression profile of genes coding for receptors interacting with LSD. The
goal is to leverage the statistical properties of the slow (<1 Hz) intrinsic fluctuations of the blood-
oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal hemodynamics at rest (i.e. resting-state functional connectiv-
ity (rs-fcMRI)). Critically, rs-fcMRI analyses are able to reveal the functional architecture of the brain,
which is organized into large-scale systems exhibiting functional relationships across space and
time (Biswal et al., 2010; Buckner et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014a). Rs-fcMRI measures have fur-
thermore revealed potential biomarkers of various neural disorders (Murrough et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2016a), as well as proven sensitive to the effects of neuropharmacological
agents (Driesen et al., 2013a; Anticevic et al., 2015 ).
Focused analyses on specific regions revealed effects of intravenously administered LSD on func-
tional
connectivity
between
V1
and
distributed
cortical
and
subcortical
regions
(Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016b). However, such ‘seed-based’ approaches rely on explicitly selecting specific
regions of interest based on a priori hypotheses. Therefore, such an approach has limited ability to
detect pharmacologically-induced dysconnectivity not predicted a priori. To characterize LSD effects
on functional connectivity in the absence of strong a priori hypotheses, the current study employed
eLife digest The psychedelic drug LSD alters thinking and perception. Users can experience
hallucinations, in which they, for example, see things that are not there. Colors, sounds and objects
can appear distorted, and time can seem to speed up or slow down. These changes bear some
resemblance to the changes in thinking and perception that occur in certain psychiatric disorders,
such as schizophrenia. Studying how LSD affects the brain could thus offer insights into the
mechanisms underlying these conditions. There is also evidence that LSD itself could help to reduce
the symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.
Preller et al. have now used brain imaging to explore the effects of LSD on the brains of healthy
volunteers. This revealed that LSD reduced communication among brain areas involved in planning
and decision-making, but it increased communication between areas involved in sensation and
movement. Volunteers whose brains showed the most communication between sensory and
movement areas also reported the strongest effects of LSD on their thinking and perception.
Preller et al. also found that another drug called Ketanserin prevented LSD from altering how
different brain regions communicate. It also prevented LSD from inducing changes in thinking and
perception. Ketanserin blocks a protein called the serotonin 2A receptor, which is activated by a
brain chemical called serotonin that, amongst other roles, helps to regulate mood. By mapping the
location of the gene that produces the serotonin 2A receptor, Preller et al. showed that the receptor
is present in brain regions that show altered communication after LSD intake, therefore pinpointing
the importance of this receptor in the effects of LSD.
Psychiatric disorders that produce psychotic symptoms affect vast numbers of people worldwide.
Further research into how LSD affects the brain could help us to better understand how such
symptoms arise, and may also lead to the development of more effective treatments for a range of
mental health conditions.

 a

derived

theory
called
Global
Brain
Connectivity
(GBC) (Anticevic et al., 2014a). In essence, GBC computes the connectivity of every voxel in the
brain with all other voxels and summarizes that in a single value. Therefore, areas of high GBC are
highly functionally connected with other areas and might play a role in coordinating large-scale pat-
terns of brain activity (Cole et al., 2010). Reductions in GBC may indicate decreased participation of
a brain area in larger networks, whereas increased GBC may indicate a broadening or synchroniza-
tion of functional networks (Anticevic et al., 2014a). One focused study examined GBC after intra-
venously administered LSD in a sample of 15 participants, revealing connectivity elevations across
higher-order association cortices (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). While compelling, this preliminary study
did not take into account the influence of global signal (GS) artefacts (e.g. via global signal regres-
sion, GSR), which are known to exhibit massive differences in clinical populations and following phar-
macological manipulations (Power et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016b; Lewis et al., 2017;
Driesen et al., 2013b). Specifically, GS is hypothesized to contain a complex mixture of non-neuro-
nal
artefacts
(e.g.,
physiological,
movement,
scanner-related),
which
can
induce
elevated relationships across the brain (Yang et al., 2014a). No study has examined LSD-induced
changes as a function of GS removal. To inform this knowledge gap a major objective here was to
study data-driven LSD-induced dysconnectivity in the context of GS removal.
Another aim of the current study was to determine the extent to which the neural and behavioral
effects of LSD are mediated by 5-HT2A receptors. Preclinical studies suggest that LSD binds potently
to many neuroreceptors including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT1A, D2, and other receptors (Marona-
Lewicka et al., 2002; Passie et al., 2008). Yet, a recent paper from our group (Preller et al., 2017)
reported that the psychedelic effects of LSD were entirely blocked in humans by ketanserin (Ket), a
selective antagonist at 5-HT2A and a-adreno receptors (Leysen et al., 1982). This would suggest
that the neural effects of LSD should be blocked by Ket. It also suggests that networks modulated
by LSD should highly be associated with the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain and not
closely associated with the distribution of receptors unrelated to the mechanism of action of LSD.
Here we leverage recent advances (Burt et al., 2018) in human cortical gene expression mapping
to inform the spatial topography of neuropharmacologically-induced changes in data-driven connec-
tivity. We hypothesized that the LSD-induced GBC change will quantitatively match the spatial
expression profile of genes coding for the 5-HT2A receptor. In turn, we hypothesized that this effect
will be preferential for the 5-HT2A but not other receptors and that the spatial match will be vastly
improved after artefact removal. In doing so, this convergence of neuropharmacology and gene
expression mapping validates the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor to LSD neuropharmacology.
In turn, it also highlights a general method for relating spatial gene expression profiles to neuro-
pharmacological manipulations, which has direct and important implications for the rational refine-
ment of any receptor neuropharmacology.
Collectively, this pharmacological neuroimaging study addresses the following major knowledge
gaps in our understanding of LSD neurobiology, by demonstrating: (i) data-driven LSD effects across
brain-wide networks, which are exquisitely sensitive to GS removal, (ii) the subjective and neural
effects of LSD neuropharmacology are attributable to the 5-HT2A receptor, and (iii) the cortex-wide
LSD effects can be mapped onto the spatial expression profile of the gene coding for the 5-HT2A
receptor.
Results
LSD modulates global brain connectivity and induces marked subjective
drug effects
The main effect of drug on GBC computed with global signal regression (GSR) revealed significant
(TFCE type I error protected, 10000 permutations) widespread differences in GBC between drug
conditions in cortical and subcortical areas (Figure 1). Comparing LSD to Ketanserin+LSD (Ket+LSD)
+Placebo (Pla) conditions across sessions shows that LSD induces hyper-connectivity predominately
in sensory and somatomotor areas, that is the occipital cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the
postcentral gyrus, as well as the precuneus. Hypo-connectivity was induced in subcortical areas as
well as cortical areas associated with associative networks, such the medial and lateral prefrontal cor-
tex, the cingulum, the insula, and the temporoparietal junction. All changes in connectivity were

 expressed bilaterally (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows mean connectivity strength (Fz) for each drug
condition and the distribution of Fz values for grayordinates (i.e. either a surface vertex (node) or a
volume voxel in gray-matter) showing significant hyper- and hypo-connectivity for LSD compared to
(Ket+LSD)+Pla conditions. Mean Fz values do not differ between Pla and Ket+LSD conditions either
in hyper-connected or in hypo-connected areas. Figure 1C depicts the comparison between LSD
and Pla conditions and Figure 1D the comparison between LSD and Ket+LSD conditions. Similarly
to the comparison LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla shown in Figure 1A, LSD compared to both Pla and Ket
+LSD separately induced a connectivity pattern characterized by significant (TFCE type I error pro-
tected, 10000 permutations) hyper-connectivity in predominantly sensory areas and significant hypo-
connectivity in associative networks. The similarity between the LSD>Pla and LSD>Ket+LSD con-
trasts is corroborated by a significant positive correlation (r = 0.91, p<0.001) between the respective
Z-maps (Figure 1E). Furthermore, only negligible differences were observed when comparing Ket
+LSD and Placonditions directly (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we tested if the
directionality of LSD-induced effects on GBC (hyper-connectivity across sensory and somatomotor
networks, hypo-connectivity across associative networks) are separable effects or result from func-
tionally related systems-level perturbations. To this end, we correlated the mean connectivity
strength difference between Pla and LSD in hyper-connected regions with mean connectivity
strength difference in hypo-connected regions across subjects (based on the LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla
contrast). There was a significant correlation between hypo- and hyper-connectivity (r = �0.90,
p<0.001, Figure 1F) indicating that participants with the highest LSD-induced coupling within sen-
sory and somatomotor networks also showed the strongest LSD-induced de-coupling in associative
networks. This suggests that LSD-induced alterations in information flow across these networks may
result from systems-level perturbations. Together, these results indicate that LSD-induced GBC alter-
ations are predominantly attributable to its agonistic activity onto the 5-HT2A receptor. In line with
this, a repeated-measures ANOVA (drug condition�scale) was conducted for the retrospectively
administered Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire, and revealed significant main
effects for drug condition (F (2, 46)=88.49, p<0.001) and scale (F (10, 230)=14.47, p<0.001), and a
significant interaction of drug condition�scale (F (20, 460)=13.02, p<0.001). Bonferroni corrected
simple main effect analyses showed increased ratings on all 5D-ASC scales in the LSD condition com-
pared to Pla and Ket+LSD conditions (all p<0.05) except for the scales spiritual experience and anxi-
ety (all p>0.20). Pla and LSD+Ket scores did not differ on any scale (all p>0.90) (Figure 1G).
Influence of global signal regression on global brain connectivity
following LSD administration
To investigate the influence of GSR on LSD results, we repeated the analyses presented above with-
out GSR (i.e. the effect of drug condition on GBC shown in in Figure 1). The main effect of drug on

 GBC computed without GSR revealed significant predominantly left-hemispheric widespread differ-
ences in GBC between drug conditions (Figure 2A, TFCE type I error protected, 10000 permuta-
tions). Figure 2B shows mean Fz for each drug condition and the distribution of Fz values within
voxelgrayordinates showing significant hyper- and hypo-connectivity for LSD compared to (Ket+LSD)
+Pla conditions. Mean Fz values for hypo-connected grayordinates differed significantly between Pla
and Ket+LSD conditions. Mean Fz values for hyper-connected grayordinates differed significantly
between Pla and Ket+LSD, and LSD and Ket+LSD conditions. Figure 2C depicts the comparison
between LSD and Pla conditions. Without GSR LSD induced hypo-connectivity mainly in the right
insula and hyper-connectivity predominantly in the cerebellum. Figure 2D shows the comparison
between LSD and Ket+LSD conditions with LSD-induced hypo-connectivity in the left insula and
widespread predominantly left-hemispheric hyper-connectivity in the frontal and temporal cortex,
the tempoparietal junction, and the cerebellum. Comparing Ket+LSD and Pla conditions revealed
Ket+LSD induced hyper-connectivity predominantly in the right hemisphere (Figure 2E). LSD>Pla
and LSD>Ket+LSD Z-maps were significantly correlated (r = 0.81, p<0.001, Figure 2F). To test the
relationship between hyper- and hypo-connectivity when GSR was not performed, we correlated the
mean Fz difference between Pla and LSD without GSR in hyper-connected regions with the mean Fz
difference in hypo-connected areas (based on the LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla contrast) across subjects.
There was a significant positive correlation between hyper- and hypo-connectivity (r = 0.92,
p<0.001, Figure 2G). In contrast to the analysis performed with GSR showing a negative relationship
between hyper- and hypo-connectivity change scores, the analysis without GSR indicates that partici-
pants with the highest LSD-induced hyper-connectivity showed the weakest LSD-induced de-cou-
pling. Correlating the combined hyper- and hypo-connectivity values with GSR with those without
GSR showed that these are not significantly related within subjects (r = 0.003, p=0.99, Figure 2H).
Furthermore, we tested the consistency of the hyper/hypo relationships with and without GSR by
examining the areas that survived the type I error correction following TFCE with data that has
undergone GSR (Figure 1). Here we focused on the areas showing hyper vs. hypo effects, which we
used as masks to extract values for each person prior to GSR. If GSR altered or induced the hyper/
hypo effect then we would hypothesize the correlation would weaken prior to GSR. The effect was
not consistent with this null hypothesis – namely that the hyper/hypo individual difference remained
highly stable even without GSR (r = 0.92, p<0.001, Figure 2I). Put differently, this is not consistent
with the hypothesis that the hyper/hypo changes are an artefact of the GSR process.
Characterizing the directionality of LSD-induced effects on association
versus sensory-somatomotor areas
We reported robust and widespread differences between GBC analyses results with and without
GSR following LSD administration. This discrepancy calls into question interpretations regarding the
directionality of LSD on sensory-somatomotor vs. association cortices, at least when assayed via the
GBC metric. To inform this question, we conduced three additional analyses designed to investigate
the influence of LSD and GSR on BOLD signal properties, which help inform and constrain GBC
interpretations:
First, we investigated if the amplitude of the BOLD signal is influenced by GSR across different
experimental conditions (i.e. LSD vs. Pla). Specifically, we quantified ‘amplitudes’ using a measure of
local grayordinate-wise variance – an approach validated in our prior work in the context of clinical
neuroimaging and effects of GSR in such datasets (Yang et al., 2014b). Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1 shows the change in local grayordinate-wise variance under LSD vs. Pla. The effect illustrates
a very weak alteration in local variance (min/max Z = �1.54/+2.28). No areas survived whole-brain
correction. This result in not consistent with the hypothesis that LSD markedly alters grayordinate-
wise amplitudes/variance relative to Pla.
Second, we calculated the mean variance of the GS across all grey matter grayordinates (as
opposed to local grayordinate-wise variance). We achieved this by defining the mean of all gray mat-
ter signal for a given subject based on their FreeSurfer segmentation and then computed the vari-
ance of the BOLD signal time course, averaged over all grayordinates in this global greymatter
mask. Results indicate that variance of the GS does not differ significantly between conditions on
average when computing the mean across all grey matter grayordinates [F(2, 46)=0.71, p>0.49)].
Third, we investigated the possibility that the GS itself may exhibit a shifted topography on LSD,
as shown in prior work (Yang et al., 2016b). Specifically, the two analyses above reveal that

 grayordinate-wise and average GS variance do not markedly differ for LSD vs. Pla. However, the
mean GS analysis above cannot address the possibility that the GS signal itself has a distinct spatial
configuration following LSD administration. In other words, which areas are maximally contributing
to the mean GS may not be the same after LSD administration. To investigate the possibility of a
shifted topography of the GS, as shown in prior work (Yang et al., 2016b), we computed the beta
map of the GS for each subject (see Materials and methods). This GS beta map allowed us
to compare the spatial topography of GS under LSD vs. Pla conditions (Figure 3A). As evident from
the figure, the GS beta contrast was quite robust, especially when compared to the local grayordi-
nate-wise variance results (min/max Z = �5.73/+7.74). Critically, the map revealed a bi-directional
spatial shift of the GS under LSD where associative cortices and large areas of sub-cortex showed an
elevated GS contribution. In contrast, the blue areas showed a reduced GS contribution under LSD.
This map correlated highly with the spatial organization of the LSD-induced changes on GBC. This is
unsurprising as GBC is highly sensitive to shared brain-wide signal shifts. Put differently, a GBC mea-
sure will be sensitive to the change in the mean shared signal across the brain. If LSD is altering this
mean shared signal topography, then the GBC effect should be similarly affected. To quantify this
we calculated the relationship between the LSD-Pla contrast GBC map before (Figure 3C) and after
GSR (Figure 3B) and the LSD-Pla contrast GS beta map. The LSD-Pla contrast GS beta map exhib-
ited a highly significant negative correlation with the LSD-Pla contrast GBC map after GSR (r = 0.65,
p<0.001), but a highly significant positive correlation before GSR (r = 0.66, p<0.001). This result pro-
vides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a transformation in the GS beta map
itself, which is contributing the GBC effect pre/post GSR.
However, this analysis still does not inform the ‘ground truth’ effect of LSD on baseline connectiv-
ity – namely if LSD reduces or elevates connectivity across sensory and somatomotor versus associa-
tive cortices. There is a core limitation to the GBC metric in relation to the GS topography inherent
to the way it is computed: Specifically, GBC yields the mean shared signal from a given
grayordinate to all other grayordinates. This calculation is therefore affected by the shared variance
across all grayordinates (i.e. the map of the GS). If this shared GS variance structure is shifted in one
condition versus the next, then the GBC calculation will shift accordingly in a spatially ordered way
corresponding to the GS spatial shift.
Therefore, it is not known from the GBC effects alone if LSD elevates or reduces mean connectiv-
ity in associative vs. sensory and somatomotor cortices. This interpretational challenge stems from
the presented GS beta map analyses because it is not clear if GS beta map transformations on the
GBC effect under LSD are primarily neural or artefactual.

increased (red) and decreased (blue) covariance with the GS in the LSD condition compared to Pla. The Z map in the lower panel illustrates the
unthresholded contrast between LSD vs. Pla for the GS beta map computed for each subject. Specifically, we calculated the GS (computed as mean
grey matter signal) for each frame in the BOLD time course. This mean GS was then used as a regressor in a subject-specific general linear model
(GLM). The resulting beta map indicates which areas are maximally co-varying with the mean GS for each subject under LSD or Pla. This ‘GS beta map’
was then entered into a 2nd level analysis as done for the connectivity dependent measures. This comparison tests the hypnosis that the spatial
contribution to the GS is altered under LSD vs. Pla. The result shows LSD>Pla in warm colors and LSD<Pla in cool colors. (B) Negative correlation

 To address this, we designed a complementary analysis, which yields a map that is interpretation-
ally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts. Here we focused on the thalamo-cortical system
leveraging a well-established effect that is not affected by GSR transformations (Yang et al., 2014b;
Anticevic et al., 2014b; Woodward et al., 2012). To examine brain-wide thalamic coupling in ses-
sion one we computed a seed-based map by extracting average time-series across all grayordinates
in each subject’s anatomically defined bilateral thalamus (via FreeSurfer segmentations). To examine
between-drug differences, thalamic maps were entered into a second level analysis as done for the
GBC measures (mean thalamic connectivity maps for each condition are displayed in Figure 4—fig-
ure supplement 1 and all contrasts in Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Here we used both the cor-
relation and covariance as methods of statistical association, which we conjuncted (Cole et al.,
2016). We did this because covariance reflects a non-normalized measure of shared BOLD signal
across time (which is scale free and unaffected by variance structure) whereas correlation is inher-
ently normalized by pooled variance. Furthermore, given that GS induces mean signal shifts (i.e. it
may induce anti-correlation), we also obtained the top and bottom 10% of all thalamic connections
from both correlation and covariance maps before and after GSR. This final 4-way conjunction map
ensured that the resulting regions in the top/bottom ranges exhibit thalamic coupling irrespective of
processing (i.e. GSR/noGSR) or statistical method (i.e. r or cov). This map was then used to calculate
LSD induced effects on top 10% and bottom 10% of seed thalamic brain-wide connections. The pre-
diction was that LSD would decrease thalamic connections that were in the top 10% (i.e. highly posi-
tive thalamic connections at baseline, which represent thalamo-associative coupling, Figure 4A). In
turn, we predicted that LSD would elevate connections that were in the bottom 10% (i.e. very weak
thalamic connections at baseline, which represent thalamo-sensory coupling, Figure 4A).
Figure 4B and C shows the difference in the average signal between drug conditions for the cor-
relation method after GSR. Here, LSD consistently decreases coupling in associative areas and
increases FC in sensory-somatomotor regions (Figure 4A). Critically, this effect was preserved for
the LSD-(Ket+LSD) analysis (Figure 4B). Without GSR however, inconsistent results emerged (Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 2). To reconcile the interpretation of LSD-induced directionality we lever-
aged the conjunction map that was robust to processing method and statistical approach. This
conjunction map was used as a mask to extract the average signal across these regions in the LSD-
Pla and LSD-(Ket+LSD) contrast before and after GSR in the seed-based correlation/covariance anal-
yses as well as GBC correlation/covariance analyses. Figure 4F shows the difference in the average
signal between these drug conditions across analyses methods (thalamic seed FC/GBC, correlation/
covariance) after GSR. Here, LSD consistently decreased thalamic coupling in associative areas and
increased thalamic coupling in sensory-somatomotor regions irrespective of analysis method. Impor-
tantly, the thalamic seed analyses matched GBC effects. Without GSR however (Figure 4G), seed
thalamic coupling and GBC results were inconsistent. Furthermore, in contrast to results after GSR,
LSD did not consistently decrease connections that were in the top 10% or elevate connections that
were in the bottom 10% without GSR. To investigate individual differences, we computed the corre-
lation between the top and bottom connections before and after GSR across participants
(Figure 4H, full connectivity matrix is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3). The prediction
was that individuals with biggest elevation for bottom 10% would should the biggest drop in the
top 10% under LSD. Predicted negative individual differences emerged after GSR but without GSR
results were not compatible with individual difference predictions based either for thalamic seed
analysis or GBC. Collectively, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that, following GS
cleanup, LSD reduces shared signals for association cortices but elevates shared signals for sensory
and somatomotor areas across both seed-based thalamic and GBC analyses.
Time course of subjective drug effects
To investigate the time course of subjective effects, a short version of the 5D-ASC was administered
180 min, 250 min, and 360 min after the second drug administration. A repeated-measures (drug
condition�time�scale) ANOVA for the short-version 5D-ASC questionnaire revealed significant main
effects for drug condtition (F (2, 44)=58.32, p<0.001), time (F (2, 44)=26.61,p<0.001), and scale (F
(4, 88)=14.83, p<0.001) and significant interactions for drug condtion�time (F (4, 88)=16.89,

ment intake (all p<0.05). 360 min after intake, score on the disembodiment scale and elementary

treatment conditions. Scores did not differ between the Pla and Ket+LSD treatment conditions for
any scale at any time point (all p>0.90; Figure 5, Figure 5—source data 1). Test-retest reliability of

(Marona-
Lewicka et al., 2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007), two resting-state scans were conducted
on each test day: 75 min (session 1) and 300 min (session 2) after the second drug administration.
No significant differences in GBC were observed when comparing session 1 and 2 within the Pla and
the LSD condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Within the Ket+LSD condition, participants
showed significant decreases in GBC in session two compared to session one predominantly in
occipital areas. Increases in GBC in session two were found in cortical regions such as the anterior
and posterior cingulate cortex, and the temporoparietal junction, as well as subcortical structures
including the thalamus and the basal ganglia (Figure 6A). Figure 6B shows the significant (p<0.05)
difference in mean Fz between session 1 and session two in hyper- and hypo-connected areas and
the distribution of Fz values for grayordinates within hyper- and hypo-connected areas for both ses-
sions (hyper- and hypo-connected areas are derived from the LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla contrast, see
Figure 1A).
We next specifically investigated mean Fz (with and without GSR) for all drug conditions and ses-
sions for grayordinates within seven functionally-defined networks using parcellations derived
by Yeo et al. (2011), Buckner et al. (2011) and Choi et al. (2012) (Figure 7). This parcellation con-
tains both sensory (visual and somatomotor) and associative (dorsal attention, ventral attention, lim-
bic, frontoparietal control, and default mode) networks. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed
significant main effects for drug condition for all networks (all p<0.05) except for the dorsal attention
network when including GSR, with the LSD condition differing significantly from both, Pla and Ket
+LSD conditions (all p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected), except for the somatomotor network, where LSD
differed significantly only from Ket+LSD. Pla and Ket+LSD conditions did not differ significantly in
any network. Without GSR, main effects for drug were found in the frontoparietal control network (F
(2, 46)=4.09, p<0.03) with significantly lower values in the Ket+LSD condition than in both, the LSD

Global brain connectivity in somatomotor network correlates with
subjective effects
To evaluate the relationship between LSD-induced changes in GBC in functional networks and sub-
jective LSD-induced effects, Fz mean connectivity change (LSD–Pla condition, session 2, with GSR) in
the seven functional networks (see Figure 7) was correlated with the mean 5D-ASC short version
score at 250 mins (assessment closest in time to resting-state data collection, see Figure 1—figure
supplement 2 and Figure 5). Correlating measures at session two allows high stability in LSD-
induced effects. Bonferroni corrected correlations showed a significant relationship between the
change in Fz connectivity in the somatomotor network and subjective LSD-induced effects (r = 0.81,
p<0.001, Bonferroni corrected, Figure 8A and Figure 8B). Correlations between mean 5D-ASC
score and Fz connectivity in the other six networks and did not reveal significant relationships (all
p>0.16, Bonferroni corrected). To further investigate the contribution of specific LSD-induced symp-
toms to the relationship with somatomotor network Fz connectivity, we calculated the correlation
between Fz mean connectivity change in the somatomotor network with each 5D-ASC short version
scale separately. All five scale scores (blissful state, disembodiment, changed meaning of percepts,
elementary imagery, spiritual experience) were significantly correlated with Fz mean connectivity
change in the somatomotor network (all p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected, Figure 7C–G), indicating that
the relationship between somatomotor network Fz connectivity and subjective effects was not driven
by a specific LSD-induced symptom alone. The five scale scores were moderately to strongly

 distinct by network. Next, we investigated whether there is a common pattern of distribution
between the six gene expression maps. Correlation analyses showed that the expression of the main
gene of interest (HTR2A) is highly negatively correlated with the expression of HTR7 (r = �0.68,
p<0.001, Bonferroni corrected, Figure 9B). Figure 9C illustrates the cortical distribution of HTR2A
gene expression. This HTR2A cortical gene expression map is highly correlated with the unthre-
sholded GBC Z-score map for the LSD condition vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla condition with GSR (r = 0.50,
p<0.001), and higher than all other candidate serotonin receptor genes. While the correlation
between the unthresholded GBC Z-score map without GSR and the HTR2A cortical gene expression
map also reached significance (r = 0.18, p<0.001), this correlation was significantly weaker than
between the Z-score map with GSR and the HTR2A gene expression map (p<0.05, Bonferroni cor-
rected, Figure 9F). Taking into account all available gene expression maps the correlation between
the Z-score map with GSR and the HTR2A gene expression map was higher that 95.9% of all possi-
ble correlations. The GBC Z-score map with GSR and the HTR7 gene expression map was lower than
99.8% of all possible correlations, indicating a strong negative relationship (r = �0.63, p<0.001,
Figure 9D). The correlation between both HTR2A and HTR7 with the GBC Z-Score map is not sur-
prising considering the strong negative correlation between HTR2A and HTR7 gene expression
maps (Figure 9B). Lastly, Figure 9F illustrates that correlation coefficients between gene expression
maps and GBC Z-score maps were significantly stronger with GSR (all p<0.05, Bonferoni corrected),
except for DRD1 expression map, where the absolute value of the correlation coefficient increased
when correlated with the Z-score map without GSR.
Discussion
Interest in the potential clinical effects of psychedelics is boosted by positive preliminary reports on
the safety and tolerability in healthy participants as well as patient populations (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016a; Gasser et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). However, the under-
lying neuropharmacology psychedelics is scarcely investigated in humans. The current study closes
major knowledge gaps in the area by characterizing the effects of the prototypical psychedelic by
showing that i) LSD increases GBC across sensory and somatomotor functional networks and reduces
GBC in associative networks, which is sensitive to GS removal; ii) time-dependent effects are only
found in the interaction with katenserin; iii) GBC in the somatomotor network was associated with
subjective effects; iv) LSD-induced effects on GBC and subjective symptoms are linked to the phar-
macology of the 5-HT2A receptor; v) innovative gene expression analyses across cortex reveal for the
first time a correspondence between specific spatial gene expression patterns and in-vivo pharmaco-
logical effects in humans.
LSD increases GBC across sensory and somatomotor functional
networks and reduces GBC in associative networks
We show across conditions that LSD induces hyper-connectivity predominantly in sensory and soma-
tomotor areas (i.e. the occipital cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus).
LSD-induced hypo-connectivity was observed across subcortical areas (with the exception of the
amygdala and sensory thalamus) as well as cortical areas associated with associative networks (i.e.

 the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulum, the insula, and the temporoparietal junction)
(Figure 1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a de-synchronization of
associative networks whereas sensory and somatomotor areas exhibit elevated brain-wide shared
signal (Anticevic et al., 2014a). This is in line with previous seed-based studies reporting increased
V1 resting-state connectivity with the rest of the brain after LSD administration (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016b). Additionally, decreases of connectivity within the DMN were reported after
ayahuasca, a tea containing the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-Dimethyltryptamine,
intake (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015). Furthermore, desynchronization within the DMN was reported
after psilocybin infusion measured with magnetoencephalography (Muthukumaraswamy et al.,
2013). As noted, while subcortical areas predominantly show hypo-connectivity under LSD there
were key exceptions: the amygdala exhibited brain-wide hyper-connectivity under LSD. Amygdala
neurons abundantly express 5-HT2A receptors, and alterations in amygdala activity and connectivity
have
been
hypothesized
to
be
important
for
potential

clinical
effects
of
psychedelics (Rainnie, 1999; Kraehenmann et al., 2016). Furthermore, results showed that partici-
pants with the highest LSD-induced coupling within sensory and somatomotor networks also showed
the strongest LSD-induced de-coupling in associative networks. This suggests that LSD-induced
alterations in information flow across these networks probably results from linked systems-level per-
turbations, as opposed to being due to dissociable mechanisms across subjects. This pattern of
hyper-and hypo-connectivity may underlie the psychedelic state, suggesting increased processing of
sensory information which is not counterbalanced by associative network integrity. Consequently,
this may result in an altered state of consciousness whereby internal and external sensory computa-
tions are not integrated, leading to psychedelic symptoms.
A virtually identical pattern of hyper-connectivity in sensory networks and hypo-connectivity in
associative networks is revealed when contrasting LSD effects with the condition where LSD is
blocked by pre-administration of Ket. This brain-wide net effect of LSD was virtually indistinguishable
from LSD vs. Pla condition. Put differently, pre-treatment of LSD with Ketanserin induced only negli-
gible changes compared to LSD vs. Pla, indicating that Ket blocked virtually all LSD-induced altera-
tions in GBC. Ketanserin has high antagonistic properties particularly on the 5-HT2A receptor. Thus,
these results indicate that LSD-induced alterations in neural and behavioral effects are highly depen-
dent on stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor (Leysen et al., 1982). This is in line with data on subjec-
tive LSD-induced effects which were normalized by Ket pretreatment (Figure 1G).
Collectively, these data extend previous studies by revealing that the described pattern of brain-
wide dysconnectivity may be directly attributable to stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor. Specifically,
the effect can be characterized by brain-wide integration of sensory networks and dis-integration of
associative networks, which presumably underlie LSD-induced altered state of consciousness. Fur-
thermore, these data highlight the importance of the 5-HT2A receptor system in LSD-induced neural
and behavioral alterations.
LSD’s effect on GBC is sensitive to GS removal
One small study by Tagliazucchi et al. has previously investigated the effects of intravenously admin-
istered LSD and reports that association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode,
salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased GBC under
LSD (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). These results are partially contradictory to the data presented in Fig-
ure 1. Importantly, this previous study did not quantify the influence of the GS, which likely contains
a complex mixture of non-neuronal artefacts (e.g. respiration, which may be increased under
LSD [Power et al., 2017; Glasser et al., 2017]). Such artefacts can induce spuriously high statistical
association across the brain (Yang et al., 2014a; Coyle, 2006). Due to these discrepancies, we stud-
ied the data as a function of GS regression to inform how this methodological step affects
results (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). These analysis support the observations by Tagliazucchi et al.
(2016) when GS was not considered: results showed increased GBC in fronto-parietal, temporal,
and subcortical areas (Figure 2). The analysis without GSR showed a positive correlation between
hyper- and hypo-connectivity change scores, indicating that participants with the highest LSD-
induced hyper-connectivity showed the weakest LSD-induced de-coupling. This was in contrast to
results after GS removal. Furthermore, connectivity values with GSR and those without GSR were not
significantly

 (Figure 7). These data suggest that GS related effects cannot be explained by a mean-shift in con-
nectivity values on average, but instead may reflect a process within each subject.
One hypothesis is that GSR statistically attenuates non-neural arts and therefore provides a
method
to
better
isolate
functional
networks
in
pharmacological
resting-state
connectivity
studies (Yang et al., 2014a; Coyle, 2006). This interpretation is consistent with the absence of a
neural-symptom correlation without GSR. Finally, spatial correlations with gene expression maps
(discussed below) were notably attenuated for without GSR. That said, this dataset is not well-suited
for drawing conclusions about GSR suitability for pharmacological neuroimaging. In fact, it can be
argued that results are more replicable across session 1 and 2 without GSR. However, the statistical
phenomenon of ‘artefactual’ replication is not surprising, if one considers that GSR is designed to
attenuate sources of spatially pervasive structured artefacts which may persist across sessions; f.e.
elevated respiratory artefacts). Put differently, there is a key nuance between ‘noise’ and ‘artefact’.
Pure unstructured noise can be signal-averaged out and would not yield a consistent ‘artefactual’
effect. In contrast, ‘structured’ artefact represents a signal that can induce the same spurious effect
multiple times (Power et al., 2018; Glasser et al., 2018). Therefore, if a structured artefact is large
across both measurements (session 1 and 2), then this artefact will spuriously drive the effect and will
be replicable. Experiments that manipulate variables such as breathing rate and vigilance will be key
to fully characterize the effects of GSR on pharmacological neuroimaging data and help separate
neuropharmacological effects associated with ‘global artefacts’ versus those affecting ‘global neural
signal’ (Glasser et al., 2018). Furthermore, there are open knowledge gaps regarding LSD’s effects
on neurovascular coupling and the hemodynamic response function properties. This pitfall needs to
be addressed in experiments incorporating measures specifically designed to investigate changes in
hemodynamic coupling. Here animal studies, which offer the possibility to combine neuronal record-
ings with simultaneous measurement of hemodynamics, will be critical to help interpret LSD effects
inhumans.
Considering the directionality of LSD’s neural effects
As expected, the GS analyses indicate that a GBC metric is highly sensitive to global shared signal,
which is altered under LSD. This raises the question regarding the direction of the LSD-induced
effects on association vs. sensory-somatomotor areas. To inform the directionality of LSD modula-
tions of GBC we completed an additional analyses based on seed-based thalamic functional connec-
tivity, which yielded a map that was robust to GS transformations. The reason for this phenomenon
is that the thalamus exhibits strong bi-directional brain-wide shared signal. Furthermore, we con-
structed a conjunction measure that identified baseline (i.e. Pla) thalamic FC that was interpretation-
ally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts (Figure 4). This seed-based conjunction analysis
revealed that LSD-induced changes were consistent after GSR and comparable to GBC effects. With-
out GS removal, neither the thalamic nor GBC effects converged across metrics. This observation,
however, does not rule out the possibility that GS removal in fact attenuates signal components that
are neuronal in origin and may be relevant to important LSD-induced properties (Tagliazucchi et al.,
2016). Careful manipulation and measurement of respiratory-related artefacts during pharmacologi-
cal fMRI is needed to disambiguate the amount of GS variance that relates to neuronal vs. artefac-
tual LSD effects.
Time-dependent effects of LSD
Animal studies suggest distinct temporal phases of LSD pharmacology (Marona-Lewicka et al.,
2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007). Therefore, we investigated the time-dependent effects
of LSD on subjective effects as well as on GBC. As shown in Figure 5, subjective effects were highest
180 min after LSD administration and decreased in intensity 250 and 360 min after administration as
expected (Passie et al., 2008; Schmid et al., 2015). No differences were found between Pla and
Ket+LSD conditions at any time point, with subjective effects in both conditions being very low in
intensity (<4.7%). This shows that Ket blocked subjective LSD-induced effects over the whole time
course, indicating that subjective effects are most likely attributable to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation.
To investigate the time course of LSD-induced effects on GBC, two resting-state scans were ana-
lyzed, conducted 75 min (session 1) and 300 min (session 2) after the second drug administration.
While no significant differences were observed when comparing session 1 and 2 within the Pla and

Neuroscience
 the LSD condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), participants showed significant changes in GBC
in session two compared to session one in the Ket+LSD condition. Taken together with time-depen-
dent results observed in the functionally defined networks (Figure 6), the blocking effect of ketaner-
sin is particularly evident in the session one across all networks. Specifically, Ket not only blocks LSD
effects in session one but also augments the effects seen in Pla, indicating the opposite mechanism
of action from that seen by LSD – namely 5-HT2A receptor antagonism (Leysen et al., 1982;
Kometer et al., 2013). On the other hand, it seems possible that there exist two distinct pharmaco-
logical time phases as described in animal studies. The first phase may be modulated by 5-HT2A
receptor activation and the second phase possibly by D2 receptor activation, as suggested by pre-
clinical work (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007). This hypothesis of
time-dependent complex receptor pharmacology awaits further testing. First, studies are needed to
investigate the effect of Ket alone on GBC to verify the preferential effects of 5-HT2A antagonism.
Second, studies using pre-treatment of LSD by antagonists on receptors other than 5-HT2A are
needed to determine if the second phase is indeed modulated by another receptor system. Lastly,
indications of different pharmacological phases are not evident from subjective drug effects which
remain completely blocked by Ket. Studies using higher doses of LSD are therefore needed to inves-
tigate if the potential effect of LSD’s action on other receptors becomes more pronounced and
therefore subjectively accessible.
LSD-induced alterations in GBC in the somatomotor network are
associated with subjective effects
The LSD-induced change in connectivity in the somatomotor network correlated significantly with
general and specific subjective LSD-induced effects (mean across all scales, blissful state, disembodi-
ment, changed meaning of percepts, elementary imagery, spiritual experience). Participants with
increased connectivity in the somatomotor network also showed higher subjective effects. On aver-
age, the change in connectivity between the LSD and Pla condition in the somatomotor network was
not significant. However, this is likely explained by the heterogeneous connectivity changes within
this network: while the pre- and postcentral gyrus predominantly showed increases in GBC, medial
areas were hypo-connected. Connectivity changes in other functional networks were not significantly
correlated with subjective effects. This points to the importance somatomotor network brain regions
and their connectivity with the rest of the brain for psychedelic experiences. This is in line with previ-
ous results obtained from task-related data showing that the supplementary motor area is associated
with LSD-induced alterations in meaning and personal relevance processing (Preller et al., 2017).
These results also support broader theories of consciousness emphasizing the importance of the
sensorimotor system for the perception of presence and agency, and therefore a sense of self (e.g.,
interoceptive predictive coding model of conscious presence (Seth et al., 2011), comparator
model (Frith et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2016; Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Furthermore, altera-
tions
in
sensorimotor
gating
have
been
suggested
to
underlie
psychedelic
experiences (Quednow et al., 2012; Ludewig et al., 2003). Somatomotor system activity and con-
nectivity has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Anticevic et al., 2014b),
an illness characterized by delusions and alterations in the sense of self, potentially arising from alter-
ations in sensorimotor gating deficits in an inferential mechanism that allows distinguishing whether
or not a sensory event has been self-produced (Synofzik et al., 2010). The current results corrobo-
rate and extend these previous findings by showing that somatomotor network connectivity is also
closely associated with an LSD-induced psychedelic state.
LSD-induced alterations in GBC correlate with HTR2A and HTR7 cortical
gene expression
To further investigate LSD’s receptor pharmacology we specifically used the threshold-free Z-score
map of LSD effects relative to Ket blockade and Pla. The logic here is that such a map may reflect
Ket-specific contributions to LSD blockade, which is hypothesized to involve the 5-HT2A receptor.
This map was then correlated with gene expression maps of receptors that may be stimulated by
LSD (Nichols, 2004). LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity after GSR exhibited strong pos-
itive relationships with HTR2A expression (higher than 95.9% of all possible gene expression correla-
tions, Figure 9). These results show that LSD-induced changes in GBC quantitatively match the

 spatial expression profile of genes coding for the 5-HT2A receptor, supporting the central role of this
receptor system in LSD’s neuronal and subjective effects. LSD-induced changes in functional connec-
tivity were also highly negatively correlated with HTR7 gene expression (lower than 99.8% of all pos-
sible gene expression correlations, Figure 9). This can be explained by the highly anti-correlated
expression of these two genes (Figure 9). However, it is also possible that the 5-HT7 receptor func-
tionally contributes to LSD-induced effects. In contrast to its agonistic properties on the 5-HT2A
receptor, LSD has been reported to be an antagonist in the 5-HT7 receptor (Wacker et al., 2013).
Since
previous
studies
have
shown
that

receptor

potential (Waters et al., 2012; Abbas et al., 2009), it seems very unlikely that LSD’s effects have a
strong and appreciable contribution on the 5-HT7 receptor. However, future studies should examine
5-HT7 receptor pharmacology more carefully as they may reveal a role of this receptor system in
pro-cognitive effects that contrast those of LSD. While the current results strongly implicate the
involvement of the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD-induced effects, it must be noted that no further conclu-
sions can be drawn regarding the functional contribution of other receptors agonized or antago-
nized by LSD. This limitation needs further investigation in future studies by blocking serotonin and
dopamine receptors involved in the pharmacology of LSD beyond the 5-HT2A receptor. Furthermore,
the contribution of these receptors to the effects of different doses of LSD still need to be studied.
Finally, we show that the spatial match between gene expression maps and GBC maps is signifi-
cantly improved after GSR, even though correlation coefficients in particular for DRD1, DRD2,
HTR1A, and HTR2C remain moderate. These results also highlight the validity of this approach as a
general method for relating spatial gene expression profiles to neuropharmacological manipulations
in humans. An important next step allowing further methodological validation is comparing LSD-
induced alterations in GBC with receptor maps provided by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
(Saulin et al., 2012; Ettrup et al., 2016; Ettrup et al., 2014), preferably using MR scanners that are
both MR and PET compliant allowing for cross-validation across BOLD and PET modalities within the
same person.
Conclusion
In summary, the current results close major knowledge-gaps regarding the neurobiology and neuro-
pharmacology of LSD. First, we show that LSD induces widespread alterations of GBC in cortical and
subcortical brain areas, characterized by a synchronization of sensory and somatomotor functional
networks and dis-integration of associative networks. We show that this effect is sensitive to GSR,
which has important implications for future pharmacological resting-state studies. Second, we inves-
tigated the receptor-pharmacology of LSD, showing that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a critical role in
subjective and neuronal LSD-induced effects. However, analyzing the time course of LSD-induced
alterations in functional connectivity, it seems likely that at a later phase, modulation by receptors
other than the 5-HT2A receptor is involved. The comparison of LSD-induced effects on functional
connectivity and receptor-gene expression maps underscores the interpretations of 5-HT2A pharma-
cology and points to potentially impactful studies on 5-HT7 receptor pharmacology. Lastly, in line
with various theories of consciousness we showed that the somatomotor system in particular is
related to LSD-induced psychedelic effects. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of
psychedelic compounds and offer important directions for development of novel therapeutics.

Participants were recruited through advertisements placed in local universities from March to July
2015 and underwent a screening visit before inclusion in the larger study protocol (Preller et al.,

analysis,
and
electrocardiography.

were used to exclude subjects with present or previous psychiatric disorders or a history of major
psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives. Participants were asked to abstain from the use of any
prescription or illicit drugs for a minimum of two weeks prior to the first test day and for the duration

 of the entire study, and to abstain from drinking alcohol for at least 24 hr prior to test days. Urine
tests and self-report questionnaires were used to verify the absence of drug and alcohol use. Urine
tests were also used to exclude pregnancy. Participants were furthermore required to abstain from
smoking for at least 60 min before MRI assessment and from drinking caffeine during the test day.
Further exclusion criteria included left-handedness, poor knowledge of the German language, car-
diovascular disease, history of head injury or neurological disorder, history of alcohol or illicit drug
dependence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exclusion criteria including claustrophobia, and pre-
vious significant adverse reactions to a hallucinogenic drug.
Twenty-five participants took part in the study. One subject was excluded due to failure in regis-
tration caused by an improper head position. Therefore a sample of 24 participants was included in
the final analysis (n = 19 males and n = 5 females; mean age = 25.00 years; standard deviation
(SD) = 3.60 years; range 20 – 34 years). All participants provided written informed consent state-
ments in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki before participation in the study. Subjects
received written and oral descriptions of the study procedures, as well as details regarding the
effects and possible risks of LSD and Ket treatment. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Bern,
Switzerland, authorized the use of LSD in humans, and the study was approved by the Cantonal
Ethics Committee of Zurich (KEK-ZH_No: 2014_0496). The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT02451072). No substantial side effects were recorded during the study. Four participants
reported transient headaches after drug effects had worn off. One participant reported transient
sleep disturbances for the first two nights after drug administration. Participants were contacted
again three months after the last drug administration. No further side effects were recorded.
Study design
The study employed a fully double-blind, randomized, cross-over design (see Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 2). Randomization was completed by a study nurse who had no other role in the trial. Sam-
ple size (n = 24) was determined based on a previous study reporting LSD-induced effects on
functional brain connectivity (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Recruitment was stopped after the deter-
mined sample size was reached. Specifically, participants received either:
(i) placebo +placebo (Pla) condition: placebo (179 mg Mannitol and Aerosil 1 mg po) after pre-
treatment with placebo (179 mg Mannitol and Aerosil 1 mg po);
(ii)placebo +LSD (LSD) condition: LSD (100 mg po) after pretreatment with placebo (179 mg Man-
nitol and Aerosil 1 mg po), or
(iii) Ketanserin +LSD (Ket+LSD) condition: LSD (100 mg po) after pretreatment with the 5-HT2A
antagonist Ket (40 mg po) at three different occasions two weeks apart.
Pretreatment with placebo or Ket occurred 60 min before treatment with placebo or LSD. The
resting-state scan was conducted 75 and 300 min after treatment administration. Participants were
asked to not engage in repetitive thoughts such as counting and close their eyes during the resting
state scan. Compliance to this instruction was monitored online using eye tracking (NordicNeuroLab
VisualSystem,
http://www.nordicneurolab.com/).
The
5D-ASC
(a
retrospective
self-report
questionnaire) (Dittrich, 1998) was administered to participants 720 min after drug treatment to
assess subjective experience after drug intake. In addition, a short version of the 5D-ASC was admin-
istered 180, 250, and 360 min after drug treatment to assess the time course of subjective
experience.
Neuroimaging data acquisition
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3.0T whole-body scan-
ner (Best, The Netherlands). A 32-channel receive head coil and MultiTransmit parallel radio fre-
quency transmission was used. Images were acquired using a whole-brain gradient-echo planar
imaging (EPI) sequence (repetition time = 2,500 ms; echo time = 27 ms; slice thickness = 3 mm; 45
axial slices; no slice gap; field of view = 240 � 240 mm2; in-plane resolution = 3 � 3 mm; sensitivity-
encoding reduction factor = 2.0). 240 volumes were acquired per resting state scan resulting in a
scan duration of 10 mins. Additionally, two high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using
T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. T1-weigthed images were collected via a 3D magnetiza-
tion-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (MP-RAGE) with the following parameters: voxel
size = 0.7�0.7�0.7 mm3, time between two inversion pulses = 3123 ms, inversion time = 1055 ms,

 inter-echo delay = 12 ms, flip angle = 8˚, matrix = 320�335, field of view = 224�235 mm2, 236 sag-
ittal slices. Furthermore T2-weighted images were collected using via a turbo spin-echo sequence
with the following parameters: voxel size = 0.7�0.7�0.7 mm3, repetition time = 2500 ms, echo
time = 415 ms, flip angle = 90˚, matrix = 320�335, field of view = 224�235 mm2, 236 sagittal slices.
Preprocessing
Structural and functional MRI data were first preprocessed according the methods provided by the
Human Connectome Project (HCP, RRID:SCR_006942), outlined below, and described in detail by
the WU-Minn HCP consortium (WU-Minn HCP Consortium et al., 2013). These open-source HCP
algorithms, optimized for our specific acquisition parameters and Yale’s High Performance Comput-
ing resources, represent the current state-of-the-art in distortion correction, registration, and maxi-
mization of high-resolution signal-to-noise (SNR). Here we briefly describe the processing steps.
Complete details are outlined by Glasser and colleagues (WU-Minn HCP Consortium et al., 2013).
First, the T1w/T2w images were corrected for bias-field distortions and warped to the standard
Montreal Neurological Institute-152 (MNI-152) brain template through a combination of linear and
non-linear transformations using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, RRID:SCR_002823) linear image
registration tool (FLIRT) and non-linear image registration tool (FNIRT) (Jenkinson et al., 2002).
Then, FreeSurfer’s recon-all pipeline was employed to compute brain-extraction, within-subjects reg-
istration, and individual cortical and subcortical anatomical segmentation (Reuter et al., 2012). T1w/
T2w images were then converted to the Connectivity Informatics Technology Initiative (CIFTI) vol-
ume/surface ‘grayordinate’ space.
Raw BOLD images were first corrected for field inhomogeneity distortion, phase encoding direc-
tion distortions and susceptibility arts using the pair of reverse phase-encoded spin-echo field-map
images implemented via FSL’s TOPUP algorithm (Andersson et al., 2003). Motion-correction was
then performed by registering each volume in a run to the corresponding single-band reference
image collected at the start of each run. BOLD images were then registered to the structural images
via FLIRT/FNIRT, and a brain-mask was applied to exclude signal from non-brain tissue. After proc-
essing in NIFTI volume space, BOLD data were converted to the CIFTI gray matter matrix by sam-
pling from the anatomically-defined gray matter ribbon.
Following these minimal HCP preprocessing steps, a high-pass filter (>0.008 Hz) was applied to
the BOLD time series in order to remove low frequencies and scanner drift. In-house MATLAB (RRID:
SCR_001622) tools were used to compute the average variation in BOLD signal in the ventricles and
deep white matter. This signal was regressed out of the gray matter time series as a nuisance vari-
able because any BOLD signal change in those structures was likely due to pervasive rather than cor-
tical activity. Finally, mean gray matter time series (i.e. the global signal) was also regressed to
address spatially pervasive artefacts, such as respiration. There still remains considerable controversy
regarding the utility of mean signal de-noising strategies (Power et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016b),
with clear pros/cons. While there are several emerging approaches in the literature that attenuate
and/or remove sources of global artefacts in BOLD data (Glasser et al., 2018), the field-wide gold-
standard approach still uses a univariate framework for removing variance from each grayordinate’s
time series by computing the mean across grayordinates and regressing it from each grayordinate’s
time course (Power et al., 2018). GSR was performed using these standard procedures, explicitly
excluding ventricles and white matter (which are defined as separate nuisance regressors). The GS
and its first derivative (with respect to time) were used as nuisance predictor terms within a multiple
linear regression model along with other nuisance predictor terms (ventricular signal, white matter
signal, movement parameters, and the first derivatives of each of these, as noted above). Finally, all
data
were
motion-scrubbed
as
recommended
by
Power
et
al.
(2013).
As
accomplished
previously (Anticevic et al., 2012), all image frames with possible movement-induced artual fluctua-
tions in intensity were identified via two criteria: first, frames in which the sum of the displacement
across all six rigid body movement correction parameters exceeded 0.5 mm (assuming 50 mm corti-
cal sphere radius) were identified. Second, root mean square (RMS) of differences in intensity
between the current and preceding frame was computed across all voxels and divided by mean
intensity. Frames in which normalized RMS exceeded 1.6 times the median across scans were identi-
fied. The frames flagged by either criterion, as well as the one frame preceding and two frames fol-
lowing each flagged frame, were marked for exclusion (logical or). Subjects with more than 50%

 frames flagged were completely excluded from all analyses. All the included subjects in the final
samples passed these criteria.
Global brain connectivity calculation
Most connectivity studies focus on pre-defined areas (i.e. seed-based approaches). Such approaches
assume ‘dysconnectivity’ across similar regions or networks. However, functional dysconnectivity
induced by LSD, especially across heterogeneous associative cortical circuits, may exhibit variability
across people. To address this, here we applied recently optimized neuroimaging analytic techni-
ques to identify dysconnectivity in a data-driven fashion, termed global brain connectivity
(GBC) (Anticevic et al., 2013; Anticevic et al., 2014c; Cole et al., 2011). GBC is a measure that
examines connectivity from a given grayordinate(or area) to all other voxelgrayordinates (or areas)
simultaneously by computing average connectivity strength – thereby producing an unbiased
approach as to the location of dysconnectivity. Also, unlike typical seed approaches, GBC involves
one statistical test per grayordinates (or area) rather than one test per grayordinate-to-grayordinate
pairing, substantially reducing multiple comparisons. These improvements dramatically increase the
chances of identifying pharmacologically-induced dysconnectivity, or individual differences corre-
lated
with
symptoms,
as
we
demonstrated
by
our
prior
studies
conducted
in
clinical
populations (Cole et al., 2010; Anticevic et al., 2013; Cole et al., 2011). By extension, this
approach can be readily applied to pharmacological neuroimaging studies. Specifically, the GBC
approach (Cole et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2011) was applied using in-house Matlab tools
studies (Anticevic et al., 2013; Anticevic et al., 2014c; Cole et al., 2011), extended across all
grayordinates in the brain, as defined via the CIFTI image space, which was obtained via an adapted
version of FreeSurfer software fine-tuned by the HCP pipelines (Fischl et al., 2002). Finally, for each
grayordinate in the CIFTI image space, we computed a correlation with every other whole-brain
grayordinate, transformed the correlations to Fisher z-values, and finally computed their mean. This
calculation yielded a GBC map for each subject where each grayordinates value represents the
mean connectivity of that grayordinate with all other grayordinates in the brain. We also verified that
differences in variance of BOLD signals did not drive our GBC results, as predicted by our prior
computational modeling work (Yang et al., 2014c). To this end, we computed GBC using a non-nor-
malized covariance measure, which did not alter effects. Appropriate whole-brain type I error correc-
tion was computed via FSL’s PALM tool (see second - Level Group Comparisons below).
Thalamic seed functional connectivity
To examine the thalamus coupling with all grayordinates in the brain in session one we computed a
seed-based thalamus correlation and covariation map by extracting average time-series across
all grayordinates in each subject’s bilateral thalamus and then correlating/covarying these with
each grayordinate. For details on this approach see (Anticevic et al., 2014b).
Global signal regression
Because
of
emerging
findings
suggesting
that
clinical
populations
exhibit
elevated
GS
variability (Yang et al., 2014c), we separately examined results without GSR implemented. This dem-
onstration is particularly important given recent reports suggesting that the GS may be abnormally
altered in specific clinical populations (Yang et al., 2014c; Gotts et al., 2013), but also that it may
contain major elements of respiratory artefacts (Power et al., 2017), which could influence GBC
analyses.
Global gray matter signal beta map calculation
To obtain global signal (GS) beta values, we first performed GS regression (GSR) using standard
widely adopted procedures (Anticevic et al., 2013; Cole et al., 2011). The GS timeseries for each
subject was obtained by calculating mean raw BOLD signal averaged over all grayordinates for each
time point, explicitly excluding ventricles and white matter signal. This GS timeseries was used as
nuisance predictor term within a multiple linear regression model. More formally, we used the fol-
lowing multiple regression analysis:

The ‘mean GS beta weight’ computation in Figure 3 is done by fitting a generalized linear model
(GLM) to each grayordinate’s BOLD time series to obtain the GS beta weight (bGS) as shown above.
In that sense, the grayordinate-wise whole-brain map of GS beta weights is more interpretable as a
task-evoked GLM analysis than to a functional connectivity measure. In other words, GS beta weights
are not functional connectivity values and should not be interpreted as such – instead they represent
the amount of GS variance accounted for by that grayordinate for a given subject. This ‘GS beta
map’ was then entered into a second level analysis as done for the functional connectivity dependent
measures. This comparison tests the hypnosis that the spatial contribution to the GS is altered under
LSD vs. Pla, as done in our prior work (Yang et al., 2016b).
Quality assurance analyses
For quality assurance purposes we computed the following measures: (i) signal-to-noise ratio
(defined as mean signal over the entire BOLD time series for a given grayordinate divided by its
standard deviation), and (ii) the percentage of ‘scrubbed’ images. In turn, we correlated these meas-
ures with mean Fz-connectivity with and without GSR for the first and second session in the LSD con-
dition (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). All correlations were non-significant indicating that changes
in GBC induced by LSD are not attributable to motion and image arts.
Second level statistical analysis
GBC maps for each subject, condition, and session were entered into a 2 � 3 repeated-measures
ANOVA and tested using FSL’s Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM,[Winkler et al.,
2014]). Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was used to avoid the need to define clusters
using arbitrary thresholds for cluster size. We report the default TFCE parameters that were used in
the permutation, which are fully described in the PALM code (https://github.com/andersonwinkler/
PALM/blob/master/palm_defaults.m). The statistical images were thresholded at p<0.05 (family-wise
error corrected), with 10000 permutations. For further analysis connectivity strength (Fz) values for
hyper- and hypo-connected areas (based on the LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla contrast) were averaged
across grayordinates for each participant and condition. Furthermore, Fz values for grayordinates
within seven functionally-defined networks using parcellations derived by Yeo et al. (2011),
Buckner et al. (2011) and Choi et al. (2012) were averaged for each participant and condition. All
analyses were performed with and without GSR. Results were visualized using the Connectome
Workbench software (https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench.html).
Statistical analysis of behavioral data
The 5D-ASC comprises 94 items that are answered on visual analogue scales (Dittrich et al., 2006).
Scores were calculated for 11 recently validated scales (Studerus et al., 2010): experience of unity,
spiritual experience, blissful state, insightfulness, disembodiment, impaired control and cognition,
anxiety, complex imagery, elementary imagery, audio-visual synesthesia, and changed meaning of

 percepts. The short version of the 5D-ASC includes the 45 items that comprise the spiritual experi-
ence, blissful state, disembodiment, elementary imagery, and changed meaning of percepts scales.
5D-ASC score was analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA with treatment condition (Pla, LSD,
and Ket+LSD) and scale as within-subject factors. 5D-ASC short-version score was analyzed using a
repeated-measures ANOVA with treatment condition (Pla, LSD, and Ket+LSD), scale, and time (180,
250, and 360 min) as within-subject factors. The 5D-ASC short-version scores of one participant
could not be analyzed due to missing data at 360 min after administration. Bonferroni-corrected
Pearson correlations were conducted to investigate the relationship between Fz values within the
seven functionally defined networks at session two and subjective drug effects (5D-ASC short version
at 250 min).
Gene expression preprocessing
To relate LSD-related neuroimaging effects to the cortical topography of gene expression for candi-
date receptors, we used the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA, RRID:SCR_007416). The AHBA is a
publicly available transcriptional atlas containing gene expression data, measured with DNA microar-
rays, that were sampled from hundreds of histologically validated neuroanatomical structures across
six normal post-mortem human brains (Hawrylycz et al., 2012). All reported analyses were per-
formed on group-averaged gene expression maps in the left cortical hemisphere, which were gener-
ated following a previously reported procedure (Burt et al., 2018). In brief, a group-averaged,
dense cortical expression map was constructed through a neurobiologically informed approach
using a surface-based Voronoi tessellation combined with a 180-area unilateral parcellation with the
Human Connectome Project’s Multi-Modal Parcellation (MMP1.0) (Glasser et al., 2016) (Figure 9—
figure supplement 1).
