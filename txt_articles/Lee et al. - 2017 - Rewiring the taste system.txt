Abstract
In mammals, taste buds typically contain 50-100 tightly packed taste receptor cells (TRCs) 
representing all five basic qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami1,2. Notably, mature taste 
cells have life spans of only 5-20 days, and consequently, are constantly replenished by 
differentiation of taste stem cells3. Given the importance of establishing and maintaining 
appropriate connectivity between TRCs and their partner ganglion neurons (i.e. ensuring that a 
labeled line from sweet TRCs connects to sweet neurons, bitter TRCs to bitter neurons, sour to 
sour, etc.), we examined how new connections are specified to retain fidelity of signal 
transmission. Our results show that bitter and sweet TRCs provide instructive signals to bitter and 
sweet target neurons via different guidance molecules (Sema3A and Sema7A)4-6. Here, we 
demonstrate that targeted expression of Sema3A or Sema7A in different classes of TRCs produce 
peripheral taste systems with miswired sweet or bitter cells. Indeed, we engineered animals 
whereby bitter neurons now respond to sweet tastants, sweet neurons respond to bitter, or with 
sweet neurons responding to sour stimuli. Together, these results uncover the basic logic of the 
wiring of the taste system at the periphery, and illustrate how a labeled-line sensory circuit 
preserves signaling integrity despite rapid and stochastic turnover of receptor cells.
Unlike the wiring of the mammalian olfactory system, where odorant receptors play a key 
role in directing connectivity between olfactory neurons and their targets in the olfactory 
bulb7,8, taste receptors themselves are not essential for establishing connectivity between 
TRCs and their targets (i.e. TRCs lacking taste receptors still signal properly when 
expressing engineered receptors9,10). Thus, we reasoned that as new TRCs are produced,

 they must express dedicated molecular cues that act as permissive and/or instructive signals4 
to establish connectivity with the right complement of taste neurons (Fig. 1a).
We isolated sweet and bitter TRCs (see Methods for details), performed RNAseq and 
searched for candidate proteins that could potentially serve to specify the wiring of labeled 
lines (e.g. adhesion molecules, growth factors, axon guidance molecules, synaptic 
components)11-13. In this analysis, bitter cells were readily identified by the high levels of 
expression of bitter taste receptors (Fig. 1b, green symbols)10, while sweet TRCs were 
characterized by the presence of subunits of the sweet receptor (Fig.1b, blue symbols)9. 
Several candidate molecules were differentially expressed between classes of TRCs, 
including semaphorins, protocadherin, and dscams (Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 1d; 
Supplementary Table 1)11-13.
Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a known connectivity molecule5,6, was enriched more than 100-
fold in bitter TRCs versus other cells types (Fig.1 b,c). Semaphorins are a large family of 
membrane-associated and secreted proteins that are widely expressed throughout the 
nervous system, and are often implicated in axon guidance, neural circuit assembly, and 
synaptic refinement13-15. Sema3A, in particular, was first identified as a secreted repulsive 
axon guidance-signal mediating growth cone collapse16,17, but more recently it has also 
been implicated in chemoattraction18-20.
To probe the specificity of the ‘handshake’ between bitter ganglion neurons and TRCs, we 
performed in vivo functional calcium imaging experiments (see ref. 21). In essence, since the 
taste-selectivity of ganglion neurons reflect the identity of the TRCs they connect to (e.g. 
sweet TRCs, bitter TRCs, etc.), by recording the responses of ganglion neurons to 
stimulation of the tongue with all 5 tastes, we can directly infer their corresponding TRC 
input21,22. Therefore, we targeted the calcium indicator GCaMP6 to geniculate ganglion 
neurons using retrograde viral transduction, exposed a small imaging window through the 
tympanic bulla allowing optical access to the entire ganglion in vivo, and assessed the tuning 
properties of taste neurons using bitter, sweet, sour, salt, and umami stimuli (see Methods for 
details). In wild type controls, the vast majority of geniculate ganglion neurons respond to a 
single taste quality (Fig. 2a-c)21. For example, over 90% of bitter responsive neurons receive 
input from only bitter TRCs (see Fig. 2c).
How do bitter ganglion neurons, which do not turn over, recognize and re-connect to 
continuously turning over bitter taste receptor cells? To investigate the role of Sema3A in 
bitter TRCs, we engineered animals with a conditional deletion of Sema3A in bitter taste 
receptor cells (Sema3AFlox/Flox crossed to T2R19-Cre)10,23. Figure 2 shows that loss of 
Sema3A dramatically changed the responses of bitter neurons, such that nearly half of all 
bitter-responding neurons are now also activated by other tastants, including sweet, umami 
and salt (Fig. 2d-f; see Legend for details). These results suggest at least two possibilities: 
Sema3A, normally secreted by bitter TRCs, acts as an attractive signal to guide connectivity 
between bitter TRCs and bitter ganglion neurons. Alternatively, Sema3A acts as a repulsive 
signal preventing improper connections between bitter TRCs and non-bitter ganglion 
neurons.

 We reasoned that if Sema3A functions as an attractive local signal released from bitter 
TRCs, we may be able to re-wire and redirect bitter neurons to another class of TRC by mis-
expressing Sema3A ectopically in those cells (see Fig. 3a). Thus, we engineered a mouse 
line that expresses Sema3A in sweet (and umami) cells using the upstream regulatory 
regions of the sweet/umami T1R3 receptor subunit (T1R3::Sema3A; see Extended Data Fig. 
3a). We hypothesized that bitter ganglion neurons would now be “attracted” to sweet TRCs, 
and consequently there should be a selective emergence of bitter-sweet ganglion neurons. 
Indeed, our results (Fig. 3b,c) demonstrated a 7-fold increase in the population of bitter-
sweet doubly-tuned cells (from background levels in controls to over 20% in 
T1R3::Sema3A). Moreover, unlike the Sema3A knockout that produces multi-tuned cells 
across all taste qualities (e.g. bitter-salty, bitter-sweet-salty), the bitter phenotype of the mis-
expressed animals is largely restricted to bitter-sweet.
The mis-expression studies described above used engineered animals that still carry wild-
type copies of Sema3A. We anticipated that completely removing functional Sema3A24 
from bitter cells should further decrease the remaining number of “properly wired” (singly-
tuned) bitter cells in the sweet-expressing Sema3A animals (T1R3::Sema3A;Sema3AM/M; 
Fig. 3d). As predicted, mis-expression in the mutant background leads to nearly a halving of 
the remaining singly-tuned bitter cells (Fig. 3e, from ~50% in the mis-expressed to 30% in 
the mis-expressed lacking functional endogenous Sema3A). Of note, even in the absence of 
functional Sema3A in bitter TRCs, ganglion neurons can still connect to bitter cells, 
indicating that additional cues must guide their targeting to bitter TRCs.
Given that T1R3::Sema3A;Sema3AM/M animals have 70% of their bitter-responding 
neurons as multi-tuned (Fig. 3e), we examined their behavioral responses to bitter stimuli. 
Indeed, our results showed that sensitivity to bitter chemicals was markedly impaired, with 
animals exhibiting compromised aversive responses (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 5).
The results described above validate Sema3A as a key mediator of connectivity between 
bitter TRCs and their partner ganglion neurons. What about the wiring between sweet-TRCs 
and sweet ganglion neurons? Are similar rules guiding their handshake during the constant 
renewal of sweet TRCs? We searched for candidate molecules that may mediate the 
connectivity between sweet TRCs and sweet ganglion neurons. Our expression profiling 
studies (Fig. 1b, 4a-b) singled-out Sema7A, a membrane-bound member of the semaphorin 
family25,26, as highly selective for sweet cells. To investigate the role of Sema7A in guiding 
sweet TRC-ganglion connectivity, we engineered animals that mis-express Sema7A in bitter 
TRCs (Extended Data Fig. 3). We reasoned that if Sema7A functions in sweet cells by 
providing an instructive signal to sweet ganglion neurons (like Sema3A from bitter TRCs 
does to bitter ganglion neurons) then the peripheral taste system of animals mis-expressing 
Sema7A in bitter TRCs should now result in a re-routing of sweet ganglion connections to 
bitter TRCs. As predicted, our results (Fig. 4c,d) demonstrated the selective emergence of a 
very large number of sweet responding neurons that are also activated by bitter tastants in 
the engineered animals. Can these findings be extended to additional classes of TRCs? Next, 
we examined sour taste, and generated animals mis-expressing Sema7A in sour taste 
receptor cells. We anticipated that in this instance the taste system would be re-wired such 
that sour TRCs are now signaling to sweet ganglion neurons. Indeed, these engineered mice

 have a dramatic loss of singly-tuned sour TRC, with the vast majority of their sour responses 
in neurons that are also activated by sweet stimuli (Fig. 4e).
The taste system affords the unique opportunity to explore how labeled lines between 
primary sensory cells and neurons are wired and preserved. At the periphery, five basic 
classes of TRCs signal to a matching set of ganglion neurons. How do ganglion processes 
identify their proper TRC partners? The chemoaffinity hypothesis has been a tenet of 
neuronal connectivity for over 100 years27,28. Yet, despite much effort, there are limited 
examples in vertebrates where guidance molecules expressed by target cells direct cell to 
cell, rather than “regional” level connectivity29. Because taste cells are assembled into 
tightly packed taste buds (with a random distribution of TRCs representing each 
modality)30, they provide an ideal experimental platform to explore how connectivity rules 
may operate at a cell-to-cell level. Moreover, as TRCs are constantly renewed during the life 
of the animal, they require continuous re-establishment of connections between existing 
ganglion processes and newly born TRCs. Here, we combined single-cell functional imaging 
and mouse genetics to demonstrate that sweet and bitter TRCs use distinct semaphorins in a 
deterministic fashion to guide wiring of the peripheral taste system (likely with other 
connectivity molecules as part of a multi-component wiring specificity code; see also 
Extended Data Fig. 2). Our results showed how targeted mis-expression of even a single 
connectivity signal alters taste cell-neuronal communication in a predictable fashion (e.g. 
sweet signaling to bitter, or sour to sweet). Together, these studies reveal basic rules of TRC-
neuron connectivity, substantiate the labeled line organization of the taste system, and help 
explain how a hard-wired sensory system maintains fidelity of signaling in the face of 
random turnover of receptor cells.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All procedures were carried out in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, and were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University. Adult animals 
ranging from 2-12 months of age and from both genders were used in all experiments. No 
statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, and investigators were not 
blinded to group allocation. No method of randomization was used to determine how 
animals were allocated to experimental groups. Transgenic mice were engineered by 
pronuclear injection of recombineered BAC constructs. FLAG tags were added to Sema3A 
and Sema7A mis-expression constructs using Gibson cloning (NEB) to detect mis-expressed 
proteins. T1R3::Sema3A was generated by insertion of a human Sema3A (GE Dharmacon 
MHS6278-211690268) into the T1R3 start codon in BAC RP23-236C12 (see Extended Data 
Fig. 3 for validation of the new mouse lines). Sema3A-Cre was generated by recombineering 
a Cre cassette at the start codon of the Sema3A gene in BAC RP23-151O24. T2R::Sema7A 
was generated by recombineering a human Sema7A cDNA (GE Dharmacon 
MHS6278-202857566) at the start codon of T2R19 gene in the BAC RP23-325J2. 
PKD2L1::Sema7A was engineered by insertion of the human Sema7A into the PKD2L1 
start codon in BAC RP23-297K23. TRPM5-BFP was generated by insertion of p2A-BFP

 cassette (Evrogen) to replace the TRPM5 stop codon in BAC RP23-366M16. PKD2L1-
tdTomato was generated by insertion of a tdTomato cassette at the PKD2L1 start codon in 
BAC RP23-297K23. Other mouse strains used were previously described: T2R-GFP 
(T2R32-Sapphire)31, Sema3AFlox/Flox (RIKEN RBRC01106)23, Sema3AM/M (JAX 
Stock#014646)24, Rosa-EYFP (JAX Stock#6148). All strains were backcrossed (for at least 
two generations) and maintained in a C57BL/6 background.
Taste receptor cell isolation and RNAseq
Tongues were extracted from euthanized mice expressing fluorescent reporters for specific 
TRCs and injected with a dispase/collagenase (Roche) enzyme cocktail. After a 10 minute 
incubation in 37°C, lingual epithelia were carefully peeled off from the muscle layer. Peeled 
lingual epithelia were placed in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes at 37°C, 
triturated, and sequentially passed through 70 μm and 40 μm filters (Corning) to obtain 
single cells. Fluorescently-labeled TRCs were isolated from dissociated cells using a 
fluorescence activated cell sorter (MoFlo Astrios, Beckman Coulter).
Bitter and sweet/umami TRC populations were isolated from a mouse line harboring both 
T2R-GFP and TRPM5-BFP transgenes (labeling sweet, umami and bitter TRCs)32. From 
these mice, GFP+BFP+ (bitter TRCs) or GFP−BFP+ TRCs (sweet/umami) were sorted by 
FACS into tubes containing cell lysis buffer. Each pool amounted to ~500 cells. Total RNA 
was extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher) according to 
manufacturer instructions and was immediately used for RNAseq library generation with the 
Ovation RNA-Seq System v2 (NuGEN). RNA-sequencing and analysis were performed by 
the Columbia Genome Center core facility. The RNAseq experiment was performed in three 
biological replicates.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Samples were from circumvallate papilla (taste tissue), lingual epithelia, T2R-GFP+TRPM5-
BFP+ (bitter) TRCs, T2R-GFP−TRPM5-BFP+ (sweet/umami) TRCs, and PKD2L1-
tdTomato+ (sour) TRCs. Total RNA from each sample was isolated and complementary 
DNA prepared using the Ovation RNA-Seq System v2 kit. Quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR was performed on a StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems) cycler using the Taqman Gene 
Expression system (Thermo Fisher). Taqman probes were as follows: t1r3 
(Mm0167446_g1), t2r5 (Mm0098502_s1), pkd2l1 (Mm00619572_m1), sema3A 
(Mm01230889_m1), bdnf (Mm04230607_s1), slit2 (Mm01216521_m1), dscaml1 
(Mm01174253_m1), pcdhgb7 (Mm04209449_m1), tspan18 (Mm00806028_m1), nrxn3 
(Mm04279482_m1), sema7A (Mm00441361_m1) and actb (Mm01205647_g1). For 
detection of semaphorin receptors, samples were from geniculate ganglia and fungiform 
papillae. qRT-PCR was performed using VeriQuest SYBR green master mix (Thermo 
Fisher) with the following primer pairs: plxna4 (ACCCGGATCTTCTTCAGCTT and 
CTCTGGGAGTTTCCGAAATG), plxnc1 (CAGTTTTCAAAGCTCCCAGC and 
TTGCAAACTGCAGTAAACGG), itgb1 (GGCCAAATACAGAACAAATCAA and 
ACACCGACCCGAGACCCT), nrp1 (AGGTGCAATCTTCCCACAGA and 
CCGGAACCCTACCAGAGAAT), actb (ATGGAGGGGAATACAGCCC and 
TTCTTTGCAGCTCCTTCGTT), p2x3 (TGATGGTGGGAATGATGTTG and

 TGTTTCCCCTGGCTACAACT), t1r3 (CTTTTCTCTGGGGACCACTG and 
AAAGGGCTTTCATTCCTGCT). Experiments were performed in three biological 
replicates. Data were normalized to beta-actin.
Immunostaining
Animals were euthanized and fixed by intracardiac perfusion with a 4% paraformaldehyde 
solution. Tongues were excised and placed in 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C for 
cryoprotection. Tissues were embedded in OCT compound and sectioned at 30 μm thickness 
on a cryostat. Sections were washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), blocked with 
10% donkey serum in PBST, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, and 
incubated with fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 
hours at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were: anti-Sema7A (R&D Systems 
#AF1835; 1:300 dilution), anti-FLAG (Sigma #F7425; 1:1000 dilution), anti-T1R3 (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology #sc-22458; 1:500 dilution), anti-Car4 (R&D Systems #AF2414; 1:500 
dilution), anti-Plcβ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-206; 1:1000 dilution), anti-GFP 
(Abcam #ab13970; 1:500 dilution), anti-Nrp1 (R&D Systems #AF566; 1:200 dilution), and 
anti-PlxnC1 (R&D Systems #AF5375; 1:200 dilution).
Viral delivery of GCaMP sensors
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, 
intraperitoneal), with subsequent booster doses to maintain depth of anesthesia. Body 
temperature was controlled using a closed-loop heating system. A small craniotomy (<1 mm 
diameter) centered approx. 6.5 mm dorsal to bregma and 1.25 mm from the midline was 
performed. AAV virus carrying AAV2.1-hSyn-GCaMP6s (Penn Vector Core) was delivered 
to the brain at three locations along the rostrocaudal axis: 1.25 mm/−4.0 mm (lateral 
coordinate relative to bregma/inferior coordinate relative to the dura), and −6.3 mm/−6.5 
mm/−6.7 mm (anterior coordinates relative to bregma); approximately 200 nL was delivered 
per injection. After incision closure and recovery from surgery, mice were housed in their 
home cages for at least 1 week prior to imaging.
Calcium imaging
A metal bar was affixed to the dorsal cranium of an anaesthetized mouse (see above) with 
Vetbond Tissue Adhesive (3M) and dental cement as described previously21. The mouse was 
positioned in a supine position, and its head rigidly secured using a metal bar. A 
tracheotomy was performed to maintain a clear airway during tastant delivery to the oral 
cavity. The surgical strategy used to image the geniculate ganglion in vivo was as previously 
described21. Imaging data was obtained using an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera 
(Photometrics). All images were acquired at 5 Hz, at 10× magnification. A single field of 
view was analyzed for each ganglion.
Tastants were delivered (5-10 ml/min) using silicon tubing positioned approximately 8 mm 
inside the oral cavity, dorsal to the tongue. Tastants dissolved in water were delivered for 2 
seconds each in serial order, interspersed with 13 s of water rinse. Images were acquired 
during epochs of continuous irrigation. The concentrations (and application order) of 
tastants used were: acesulfame K (AceK), 30 mM; quinine hydrochloride, 5 mM; NaCl, 60

 mM; monopotassium glutamate + inosine monophosphate, 50 mM + 1 mM, respectively; 
citric acid, 50 mM. Additional tastants: sucrose (300 mM) and cycloheximide (100 μM).
Calcium imaging data analysis
Imaging data was analyzed using custom software implemented in Matlab (MathWorks) as 
described previously33. For each field of view, all image stacks were first registered for 
motion correction using Image Stabilizer for ImageJ21. To identify neurons, maps of peak 
activity (maximal pixel intensity over mean pixel intensity) median filtered, thresholded and 
separated by watershed segmentation to create candidate regions of interest representing 
active neurons, which were reviewed manually to identify ROIs for all active neurons. 
Fluorescence traces for each region of interest were normalized to neighborhood 
fluorescence intensity (defined as the average intensity within a two cell radius distance of 
each cell, excluding all other defined ROIs) to correct for neuropil signal33. Calcium 
transients were automatically detected as fluorescence excursions of >3 fold above noise 
(defined as median average deviation). We visually scored cells, by directly observing the 
aligned image data displayed as a relative fluorescence movie, as well as the putative cells’ 
fluorescence time series21. Note that if a ganglion neuron were completely mis-wired such 
that it lost its original tuning identity, it would not show up as multi-tuned, thus 
underrepresenting the extent of rewiring. To ensure that signals originated from a single 
neuron, and not from closely adjacent cells or out-of-focus fluorescence from deeper cell 
layers, we examined the correlation of pixels in the neighborhood of each ROI for each 
calcium transient, discarding from analysis any neuron contaminated by outside signals. 
Fisher’s exact test was used to determine statistical significance between cell populations.
Behavioral assays
Taste behavior was assayed using a short-term assay that directly measures taste preferences 
by counting immediate licking responses in a multi-channel gustometer (Davis MS160-
Mouse gustometer; DiLog Instruments)32. Mice were water restricted for 24 hours before 
gustometer training. For 2-3 days, mice were acclimated to the gustometer, and trained to 
lick water from the gustometer spouts. After 10 minutes in the gustometer 2× per day, the 
mice were given 1 hour access to water in their home cage. On testing days, the mice were 
placed individually into the gustometer chamber, and presented with water or two different 
concentrations of a given bitter tastant at random (quinine hydrochloride, denatonium, or 6-
n-propylthiouracil (PROP)). During each presentation, the shutter opens, and the mouse has 
a 60 s window to lick the spout to continue the trial, otherwise it proceeded to the next trial. 
After the first lick is detected, the mouse is given 10 s to lick before the shutter closes, and 
the next presentation starts. The number of licks, inter-lick interval, and lick latency are 
recorded for each presentation. The duration of the experiment was 20 minutes.
Nerve recordings
Lingual stimulation and recording procedures were carried out as described previously32; 
data analysis used the integrated response during the 5 s of tastant stimulation. Compounds 
used for nerve recordings were: acesulfameK (30 mM); quinine (0.625 - 5 mM), and NaCl 
(60 mM). Data were analyzed for statistical significance using an unpaired, one-tailed 
Student’s t-test and 95% confidence limits.

 results in a significant loss of bitter taste sensitivity (see also Fig. 3f). b, The graphs show 
the relative fraction of licks to water and to 2 different concentrations of PROP in control 
and T1R3::Sema3A;Sema3AM/M animals. c, The graphs show the relative fraction of licks 
to water and to 2 different concentrations of denatonium in control and 
T1R3::Sema3A;Sema3AM/M animals. n = 3, mean + s.d., ** P < 0.01, Student’s 2-tailed, 
unpaired T-test. d, Chorda tympani whole nerve recording32 in control and 
T1R3::Sema3A;Sema3AM/M mutant mice. Responses were normalized to 60 mM NaCl (n = 
3, mean + s.d.). Note that whole nerve responses to bitter and sweet are unchanged, likely as 
nerve recording measure bulk neural activity, further highlighting the importance of 
recording single-neuron activity; GCaMP-based imaging of ganglion activity is significantly 
more informative than whole-nerve, or even single-fiber physiological recordings, as it 
allows simultaneous sampling of large numbers of neurons with single-cell selectivity.
Extended Data Table 1
The table shows the distribution of geniculate ganglion neurons according to their responses 
to each of the five basic taste qualities. All responsive neurons are included in the table. 
Shown are numbers of cells responding to the various stimuli in Sema3A mutant animals, 
and their littermate controls; all the data are included in Fig. 2. Note that since bitter-sour 
tuned neurons reflect the activation of T2Rs (see ref. 21), they were grouped in the table and 
in Fig. 2.

50 mM + inosine monophosphate 1 mM) and sour (citric acid, 50 mM). Colored bars mark 
time and duration (2 s) of the stimulus. Note the specificity of the responses to single taste 
qualities. c, Venn diagram displaying all possible combinations of tuning properties in 
control mice, with numbers of neurons in each class indicated as % of total. Note that over 
90% of all neurons are singly-tuned. Because there are very few umami responding neurons 
in the mouse geniculate ganglion (see ref. 21), we grouped sweet and umami cells in our 
analysis. Bitter-sour segments are merged as nearly all neurons responding to bitter and sour 
stimuli represent bitter TRCs that are sensitive to acid21; n=13 mice, 254 cells. d-f
