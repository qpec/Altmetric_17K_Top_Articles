Abstract Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neuropathological disorder that belongs to the
class of synucleinopathies, in which the protein alpha-synuclein is found at abnormally high
concentrations in affected neurons. Its hallmark are intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies and
Lewy neurites. We here report the structure of cytotoxic alpha-synuclein fibrils (residues 1–121),
determined by cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.4 A
˚ . Two protofilaments form a polar
fibril composed of staggered b-strands. The backbone of residues 38 to 95, including the fibril core
and the non-amyloid component region, are well resolved in the EM map. Residues 50–57,
containing three of the mutation sites associated with familial synucleinopathies, form the interface
between the two protofilaments and contribute to fibril stability. A hydrophobic cleft at one end of
the fibril may have implications for fibril elongation, and invites for the design of molecules for
diagnosis and treatment of synucleinopathies.

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of Lewy
bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN). Spillantini et al. (1997) identified fibrils formed by the presynap-
tic protein alpha-synuclein (a-Syn, 140 residues, ~14 kD) as the main component of these human
brain inclusions (Spillantini et al., 1998; Spillantini et al., 1997).
Certain a-Syn fibril forms can seed LB-like and LN-like inclusions in cell culture and intra-neuronal
aggregation of mouse a-Syn in vivo (Luk et al., 2009; Thakur et al., 2017; Volpicelli-Daley et al.,
2014). In addition, abnormal a-Syn produces neuronal cell inclusions and axonal spheroids, as well
as oligodendrocytic aggregates, known as glial cytoplasmic inclusions, found abundantly in Multiple
System Atrophy (MSA) (Arima et al., 1998; Tu et al., 1998), which makes a-Syn fibrils an important
target for the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for PD and related
synucleinopathies.
Despite a-Syn fibrils, other forms of a-Syn might also be involved in neurodegeneration, such as
an oligomeric a-Syn intermediate (Danzer et al., 2007; Lashuel et al., 2002; Outeiro et al., 2008;
Vicente Miranda et al., 2017; Villar-Pique
´ et al., 2016; Winner et al., 2011), or the process of fibril
aggregation itself (Oueslati et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2017; Taschenberger et al., 2012). Fibrils
of a-Syn show significant fibril strain polymorphism (Peelaerts et al., 2015).
Several factors point to a-Syn as an important player in the onset of PD: (i) six known point muta-
tions in the a-Syn gene (SNCA) are associated with familial forms of synucleinopathies: A30P

(iii) individuals with duplications or triplications of the a-Syn gene exhibit overexpression of a-Syn

Two related proteins, b-synuclein (b-Syn) and g-synuclein (g-Syn), with sequence homology to a-
Syn, have been described (Clayton and George, 1998; Jakes et al., 1994; Stefanis, 2012). b-Syn
and a-Syn share the greatest aminoacid sequence homology, with b-Syn lacking 12 amino acids (resi-
dues 71 to 82) within the non-amyloid component region (NAC; residues 61–95 in a-Syn)
(Giasson et al., 2001; Ue
´da et al., 1993). In synucleins, regions with the highest homologies are
located in the structurally heterogeneous, amino-terminal half (residues 10–84 in a-Syn) composed
of 5 to 6 imperfect repeats with the consensus sequence KTKEGV (Der-Sarkissian et al., 2003). In
contrast, the carboxyl terminus is highly negatively charged and unstructured (Chen et al., 2007;
Vilar et al., 2008).
A number of post-translational modifications have been described for a-Syn including phosphory-
lation (Anderson et al., 2006; Fujiwara et al., 2002; Paleologou et al., 2010), acetylation
(Iyer et al., 2016; Maltsev et al., 2012), ubiquitination (Hasegawa et al., 2002), and C-terminal
truncation (Anderson et al., 2006; Crowther et al., 1998). C-terminal truncation of a-Syn occurs
normally in vivo, under physiological conditions and it has been shown to promote fibrillization
(Crowther et al., 1998; Li et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2016). In turn, truncated forms
of a-Syn play a role in inducing Lewy body formation (Dufty et al., 2007; Li et al., 2005;
Prasad et al., 2012), suggesting that truncation by proteolysis may be important in the pathological
process.
eLife digest People with Parkinson’s disease have damaged cells in a part of the brain involved
in movement, learning and reward-seeking behaviors. These cells contain blob-like aggregates that
contain abnormally high amounts of a protein called alpha-synuclein. It is generally believed that,
within these blobs, this protein clusters together into small needles called fibrils.
Discerning the structure of a fibril could help researchers to understand both how alpha-synuclein
damages brain cells and how diseases like Parkinson’s spread. Biophysicists have attempted to
reveal the fibril structure previously. But many of these efforts only looked at short segments of the
alpha-synuclein protein. Researchers still need more detailed imagery of the fibrils to confirm
previous findings regarding their architecture and ultimately to identify ways to counteract the
damage they cause.
Guerrero-Ferreira et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to capture images of
frozen fibrils made from a version of human alpha-synuclein that readily aggregates and that is only
slightly shorter than the full-length protein. Processing these high-resolution images with computer
software then revealed a three-dimensional model of the fibril structure, in which fine details are
clearly visible. In the fibril, the proteins cluster to form a helix, similar to a flight of stairs. Each turn
of the helix is formed by two alpha-synuclein molecules, facing each other but rotated by almost 180
degrees from one another. The three-dimensional model displays which parts of the protein lie at
the core of the helix and thereby stabilize the fibril structure. Guerrero-Ferreira et al. speculate that
fibrils may also take alternative forms because common alpha-synuclein mutations, which correlate
with disease, would destabilize the observed helical structure.
In the future, researchers may be able to use the features of this three-dimensional model to help
design molecules that would make the fibrils detectable via medical imaging. This could help
doctors to diagnose people with Parkinson’s disease at an earlier stage. Further research is also
needed to understand where and how fibrils form, if differences in fibril structures exist within or
between patients, possibly leading to different sub-classes of the disease, and how such fibrils
interact with and possibly damage human brain cells.

 In vivo studies investigating a-Syn aggregation demonstrated that activation of the inflamma-
some and more specifically caspase-1, the enzymatic component of the inflammasome, leads to the
production of an a-Syn fragment truncated at aspartic acid 121 (D121) (Wang et al., 2016). This
C-terminally-truncated a-Syn form (a-Syn(1-121)) aggregates more rapidly than full-length a-Syn
(including disease-associated mutants), and its production is associated with cell toxicity. Further-
more, the use of VX-765, a pro-drug that produces a specific inhibitor of caspase-1 in vivo
(Wannamaker et al., 2007), improved survival of a neuronal cell model of PD (Wang et al., 2016),
and reduced neurodegeneration in a transgenic mouse model of MSA (Bassil et al., 2016), suggest-
ing an important role of a-Syn(1-121) in cellular toxicity in both, cell cultures as well as a mouse
model.
To this date, high resolution structures of a-Syn fibrils are limited to the results of a micro-elec-
tron diffraction (microED) study of two small segments of the protein (Rodriguez et al., 2015) and a
solid-state NMR structure obtained from ~5 nm diameter, single protofilaments (Tuttle et al., 2016),
in addition to solid state NMR studies at the secondary structure level (Bousset et al., 2013;
Kim et al., 2009; Vilar et al., 2008), and X-ray diffraction studies of shorter segments of a-Syn
(Li et al., 2014), or a-Syn bound to other molecules (De Genst et al., 2010; Gruschus et al., 2013;
Rao et al., 2010; Ulmer et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2010; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2011).
Here, we report the atomic structure of a-Syn(1-121) fibrils determined by cryo-electron micros-
copy (cryo-EM). The structure allows conclusions about the organization of a-Syn fibrils at near-
atomic resolution, suggest mechanisms for fibril formation and growth, and allows conclusions on
fibril stability.
Results and discussion
The 3D structure of a-Syn amyloid fibrils
Several preparations of recombinant human a-Syn fibril were screened by negative stain transmission
electron microscopy (TEM; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These included fibrils formed by full
length a-Syn (Figure 1A), a-Syn phosphorylated at serine 129, N-terminally acetylated, and C-termi-
nal truncated a-Syn comprised of residues 1–119 (a-Syn(1-119)), 1–121 (a-Syn(1-121)), or 1–122 (a-
Syn(1-122)).
The diameters of the a-Syn fibrils produced varied from 5 nm to approximately 10 nm when stud-
ied by negative stain TEM. The fibrils formed by a-Syn(1-121) were straight, between 20 and 500 nm
long and the only ones of consistent diameters of 10 nm (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement
1E). This fibrillar form a-Syn(1-121) has been described as an aggregation-prone species resulting
from a-Syn truncation by caspase-1 (Wang et al., 2016). The recombinantly produced a-Syn(1-121)
used here showed a similarly aggressive aggregation profile.
Preparations of a-Syn(1-121) fibrils were quick-frozen in the holes of fenestrated carbon coated
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids, and imaged with a Titan Krios 300kV cryo-EM instrument,
equipped with a Quantum-LS energy filter and a K2 Summit direct electron detector. Helical image
processing of recorded cryo-EM movies produced a 3D reconstruction of the a-Syn(1-121) fibril at
an overall resolution of 3.4 A
˚ (Figure 1C and D, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 2, and
Video 1).
Our 3D map shows that fibrils are formed by two protofilaments, each of 5 nm in diameter (Fig-
ure 1). These lack C2 symmetry, but are related by an approximate 21 screw symmetry, akin to the
symmetry exhibited by the paired helical filaments of tau (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017) and by amyloid-
ß(1-42) filaments (Gremer et al., 2017). a-Syn(1-121) fibrils are therefore polar, meaning that both
protofibrils are aligned into the same direction. The position of a given ß-sheet in a protofilament is
produced by the rotation of 179.5˚ of one sheet around its axis (helical twist), followed by a vertical
translation of 2.45 A
˚ (helical rise). This ß-sheet arrangement results in a spacing of 4.9 A
˚ between a-
Syn subunits in successive rungs of a single protofilament (Figure 1C and D). The quality of the EM
map allowed an atomic model of the region between residues L38 and V95 to be built.
Each a-Syn(1-121) molecule comprises eight in-register parallel b-strands (i.e. residues 42–46 (b1),
48–49 (b2), 52–57 (b3), 59–66 (b4), 69–72 (b5), 77–82 (b6), 89–92 (b7), and 94-(~102) (b8)), which are
interrupted by glycine residues (i.e. G41 before b1, G47 between b1 and b2, G51 between b2 and
b3, G67 and G68 between b4 and b5, G73 between b5 and b6, G84 and G86 between b6 and b7,

b-strands b2-b7 wind around a hydrophobic intra-molecular core composed of only alanine and

fibril, they are likely to contribute to the stability of the protofilament. The hydrophobic core is sur-
rounded by two hydrophilic regions (i.e. (i): Q79, T81, and (ii): T72, T75, T54, T59, and E61) both still
within the core of the structure (Figure 3). While most of these side chains form so-called side chain

less well defined b1 and b8 strands are attached
to the core, while the first 37 N-terminal residues
and the last ~20 C-terminal residues of a-Syn(1-
121) are not visible in the 3D reconstruction
(Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement
2A), indicating a disordered structure in line with
quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange – solu-
tion-state NMR (H/D exchange NMR) and limited
proteolysis (Vilar et al., 2008), which showed
these terminal segments to be unprotected in
nature. Together with our results, this suggests
that approximately 40 residues of both the N-
and C-terminal ends of full-length human a-Syn
are flexible, and surround the structured core of the fibril with a dense mesh of disordered tails, simi-
lar to the ‘fuzzy coat’ recently described in the cryo-EM tau structure (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017).
Two b-sheets (one from each protofilament) interact at the fibril core via a hydrophobic steric zip-
per-geometry comprised of b-strand b3 (i.e. residues G51-A56). As a consequence, two a-Syn mole-
cules per fibril layer are stacked along the fibril axis (Figure 2B and C). The side chains of residues
A53 and V55 form the inter-molecular surface contributing to the interface between the two protofi-
laments, which is further stabilized by a surface-exposed salt bridge between E57 and H50 that
might be sensitive to pH, as an unprotected histidine has a pK of ~6.2 (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 3H). The same structure with a steric zipper topology was found in micro-crystals of the pep-
tide comprising residues G47-A56 (Rodriguez et al., 2015). Interestingly, the b-strand b6 that is
sandwiched between b-strands b2/b3 and b7 is also aligned with a neighboring molecule but shifted

 by one monomer along the fibril axis, as shown in Figure 1G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1.
Thus, hetero and homo steric zippers are both present in the 3D structure. Of these, the homo steric
zipper at the inter-molecular interface has an extensive and well-packed b-strand interface, forming
a very densely packed fibril. This stacking generates an asymmetric fibril with two distinct ends. Fur-
thermore, the hydrophobic core of the fibril is composed of b-strands that interact with each other
in a half-stacked zipper topology, contrasting with the hydrophilic core comprised of b-strands b4
and b5, which are non-stacked (Figure 1G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The latter confirms
previous results from site-directed spin labeling experiments, which show that the region including
residues 62–67 at the beginning of the NAC region, has a pronounced lack of stacking interactions
(Chen et al., 2007).
The outer surface of the ordered region of the fibrils is mostly hydrophilic, with a few exceptions
(i.e. L38, V40, V82, A85, A90, F94, V95) (Figure 3A). The side chain of V66 should probably not be
classified as surface exposed because of its interaction with b-strand b8 (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 2A). If we ignore the influence of the non-polar alanine residues due to the small size of their
side chains, the surface of the fibrils has two highly hydrophobic regions formed by residues L38 and
V40, and by residues F94 and V95. Other interesting properties of the surface are the salt bridge
formed by the side chains of E46 and K80 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3G) and the rather highly
positive clustering of K43, K45, K58, H50 that requests the binding of a counter-ion, as it is sup-
ported by an observed density (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C).
The familial PD mutations in the context of the 3D fibril structure
Six familial mutations in a-Syn are known to be associated with PD and other synucleinopathies (i.
e. A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E, and A53T). Of these, all but A30P are located in the heart of the
core of the fibril structure presented here (Figure 1A and E). E46 forms a salt bridge with K80 (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 3G). The mutation of the glutamic acid E46 to a positively charged lysine
in an E46K mutant would thus induce a charge repulsion between b-strands b1 and b6, likely destabi-
lizing this a-Syn fibril structure (Tuttle et al., 2016). The familial PD/DLB-causing mutation E46K was
found to enhance phosphorylation in mice (Mbefo et al., 2015), and its toxic effect was increased
by the triple-K mutation (E35K, E46K, E61K) in neuronal cells (Dettmer et al., 2017).
Previous high-resolution structures of a-Syn only included small peptides or single protofilaments
(Rodriguez et al., 2015; Tuttle et al., 2016). Our 3D map suggests structural contributions of some
familial mutations to fibril stability, since H50, G51 and A53 are all involved in the inter-molecular
contact between the two b-sheets from adjacent protofilaments at the core of the here studied a-
Syn(1-121) fibrils. Mutation of the positively charged histidine 50 into a polar, uncharged glutamine
in the H50Q mutant would likely interfere with the salt bridge established between residues E57 and
H50 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3H). Adding to the absent side-chain of glycine 51 a negatively
charged aspartic acid in mutant G51D, or transforming the small side-chain of alanine A53 into a
larger threonine in mutant A53T, would likely disrupt the steric zipper interaction between the two
protofibrils, whereby the A53T mutation would in addition change the highly hydrophobic surface at
the zipper to partly hydrophilic one. In our a-Syn(1-121) fibril structure, A53 is part of a hydrophobic
pocket that defines the interaction of protofilaments and likely contributes to fibril stability as the
hydrophobic interactions exist along the fibril axis. Mutations at the core of this a-Syn fibril would
compromise the formation of the structure presented here. This suggests that a different fibril struc-
ture (i.e. fibril strain) could be formed from a-Syn containing the above discussed familial PD
mutations.
Several features of our structure, such as non-functional hydrophobic surface patches (Figure 3),
a hydrophilic tunnel (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D), and a positively charged side chain arrange-
ment like the one comprised of residues K43, K45, K58, H50 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C) are
not found in functional amyloid structures such as that of HET-s (Wasmer et al., 2008). However,
similar structural characteristics have been previously observed for pathological tau filaments
obtained from Alzheimer’s disease brains where (i): lysine and tyrosine residues play a similarly stabi-
lizing role in the interface region of two protofilaments of the straight filaments (SF), and (ii): the
area in the center of the protofilaments is dominated by hydrophilic residues (Fitzpatrick et al.,
2017). It is plausible that these structural features might arise because folding to form the amyloid
fibril structure is dictated by the need to bury the maximum number of hydrophobic side-chains as
efficiently as possible, as is also the case for the Ab(1-42) amyloid fibrils (Gremer et al., 2017).

 The artificial, highly toxic, but not synucleinopathy-related mutant E57K (Winner et al., 2011) is
interesting to mention in the context of the 3D structure presented, because E57 is also at the inter-
molecular interface (Figure 2). The presence of a positive lysine side chain at this position in the
E57K mutant would significantly interfere with the formation of the interface and even the amyloid
fibril (Winner et al., 2011). Indeed, this mutant was designed in a successful structure-based
attempt to interfere with amyloid fibril formation (at least under some conditions) (Winner et al.,
2011). Furthermore, both in a lentivirus-rat system as well as in a transgenic mouse model, the E57K
mutant formed a significant amount of oligomers and was highly toxic, resulting in a large decay of
TH-sensitive neurons in the substantia nigra of rats and a motor phenotype reminiscent of PD in
mice (Winner et al., 2011). Thus, the artificial mutant E57K can be regarded as a ‘familial PD-like’
mutation both from the in vivo and from the structure/mechanism-based point of view.
Comparison with earlier structural data
Full-length a-Syn subunits in a fibril studied by NMR ([Tuttle et al., 2016], PDB 2N0A) were found to
be in a roughly similar secondary structure arrangement as in the here reported structure of a-Syn(1-
121) (Figure 4A), even though the primary structure and the side-chain interactions of our here
reported structure are very different from the NMR structure. Most importantly, the fibrils used for
the NMR study were only approximately 5 nm wide, which corresponds to the diameter of a single
protofilament. The larger diameter of our fibrils, 10 nm, results from the interaction between two
protofilaments, which allowed us to hypothesize on the nature of a-Syn(1-121) protofilament interac-
tions. Fibrils of 5 to 10 nm in diameter found in substantia nigra samples from the brain of PD
patients, (Crowther et al., 2000), cingulate cortex of patients with DLB (Spillantini et al., 1998),
cerebral
cortex
of
PD
patients
(Kosaka
et
al.,
1976),
and
in-vitro
aggregated
samples
(Bousset et al., 2013). Crowther et al. (2000) had already suggested that the 10 nm filaments are
the result of the interaction between 5 nm protofilaments.
An important difference between our here reported structure and the NMR structure reported by
Tuttle et al. (2016) is the orientation of residue A53. The mutation A53T is associated with early
onset PD. In our structure, residue A53 faces the interface between the two protofibrils and thereby
likely contributes to fibril stability. In contrast, Tuttle et al. (2016) reported in their NMR structure
A53 to point towards the hydrophobic core of the one observed individual protofilament, which may
explain the lack of 10 nm fibrils in their sample. However, it is also noted here that the NMR study
by Tuttle et al. (2016) showed a significant disagreement among the ten lowest-energy NMR struc-
tures for residues 51–67 [Figure 3d in Tuttle et al. (2016)], indicating a lower confidence for those

 residues in the NMR structure. Our here reported cryo-EM map has the side-chains for those resi-
dues pointing into the opposite direction as reported in the Tuttle et al. (2016) structure.
Our structure includes a serine residue at position 87 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E), which is
one of the several phosphorylation sites in a-Syn, in addition to Y125, S129, Y133 and Y135
(Oueslati et al., 2012; Paleologou et al., 2010). S87 is the only phosphorylation site located within
the NAC region. The previous solid-state NMR structure of a-Syn placed the side chain of this resi-
due towards the inside of the protofilament core, leading to the assumption that phosphorylation of
S87 might be the only modification occurring at a region not accessible in the fibrillar state. How-
ever, in our cryo-EM structure, S87 faces the outside of the fibril and hence remains accessible for
disease-associated modification in a-Syn fibrils.
We also observed the arrangement of G47 and A78 described by Tuttle et al. (2016), which was
proposed to favor the interaction between residues E46 and K80 and allow them to form a stable
salt bridge between two consecutive a-Syn monomers (Figure 1—figure supplement 3G). The con-
servation of the geometry adopted by these residues confirms their role in facilitating backbone-
backbone interactions. In addition, our structure also confirms that residues A69 and G93 (and likely
G68) help to stabilize the distal loop in a protofilament (Figure 1—figure supplement 3F).
A microED structure obtained from crystals produced from a 10-residue peptide simulating the
core of a-Syn fibrils (PreNAC, from 47 to 56; Figure 4B) and including a threonine instead of an ala-
nine at position 53 (i.e. A53T), also proposed that residue 53 forms the hydrophobic core within a
protofilament (Rodriguez et al., 2015). In addition, the microED model suggested that the interac-
tion between adjacent protofilaments would occur through residues 68 to 78 (referred to as
NACore) (Rodriguez et al., 2015). However, their short peptides did not include most residues
responsible for the a-Syn monomer topology that we observed. Instead, our cryo-EM structure
reveals that the PreNAC is responsible for the interaction between protofilaments, and places the
NACore at the very center (i.e.the core) of a single protofilament.

 Possible mechanism of fibril elongation
Our 3D structure allows us to hypothesize a mechanism for fibril elongation (fibril growth). Because
two different stacking modes are present (i.e. the half-stack at the intermolecular interface and the
stacking of b-strand b6), the two ends of the fibrils are distinct, suggesting an end-dependent
growth of the fibrils, as documented and also suggested for other amyloids (Lu
¨hrs et al., 2005).
One end of the fibril includes a hydrophobic cleft formed between b-strands b2/ b3 on one side and
b7 on the other side (residues V49, V52, A88, I89), providing a hydrophobic entry point for the next
incoming molecule, with the matching segment consisting of 5 hydrophobic residues (V74-V82, Fig-
ure 5). This suggests that the initial binding event of fibril elongation might be a hydrophobic inter-
action involving residues V74-V82. This peptide segment is the central part of the NAC region and
strong experimental evidence suggests that it is critical for fibril formation (Giasson et al., 2001). In
addition, it has been shown that b-synuclein, which lacks residues V74 to V82, is incapable of forming
fibrils (Giasson et al., 2001).
It is intriguing to speculate that a small molecule binding into this hydrophobic cleft could be a
potent fibril elongation inhibitor or tracer, with the potential to be applied in PD and other synuclei-
nopathies. Finally, the inter-molecular stacking may also play a role in fibril elongation, since the zip-
per interaction is of hydrophobic nature. Furthermore, it is likely that fibril growth alternates
between the two protofilament structures at the level of monomer addition. Failure thereof may
result in the growth of a single protofilament with little stability, yielding a dynamic on- and off-bind-
ing of monomers and larger oligomers, which has been observed for other amyloid fibril systems
(Carulla et al., 2005).
In conclusion, we present the structure of recombinant a-Syn(1-121) fibrils determined at a resolu-
tion of 3.4 A
˚ by cryo-EM. Our structure encompasses nearly the complete protein (residues 38 to
95), and includes the NAC region (residues 61 to 95) of a-Syn. We determined that various residues
associated with familial forms of PD and other synucleinopathies are located in the interacting region
between two protofilaments, suggesting their involvement in fibril formation and stabilization. The
cryo-EM structure presented here reveals how two protofilaments interact to form a fibril, and how
the NAC region contributes to protofilament formation and stability. Our structure also presents
novel insights into how several PD-relevant mutations of a-Syn would compromise the structure of
this fibril, suggesting that in the case of certain familial forms of PD, a different structure of a-Syn
than this fibril strain might be involved. Our findings on protofilament interaction and our hypothesis
on the mechanism of fibril elongation invite for the design of molecules for diagnostics or treatment
of synucleinopathies.
Materials and methods
Recombinant proteins
Recombinant full-length a-Syn was expressed from the pRT21 expression vector in BL21(DE3) com-
petent Escherichia coli (E. coli). For N-terminal acetylation of a-Syn, cells were pre-transfected by
pNatB vector coding for the N-terminal acetylase complex (plasmid kindly provided by Daniel Mulvi-
hill, School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK) (Johnson et al., 2010). C-terminally
truncated forms of a-Syn(1-119), a-Syn(1-121), and a-Syn(1-122) were expressed in BL21-DE3-pLysS
competent E. coli. Purification of a-Syn strains was performed by periplasmic lysis, ion exchange
chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration chromatography as previously
described (Huang et al., 2005; Luk et al., 2009). Polo like kinase 2 (PLK2) was expressed in BL21-
DE3-pLysS competent E. coli, isolated via its His-tag and immediately used to phosphorylate purified
a-Syn. This was followed by standard ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography to separate
phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated a-Syn. Endotoxins were removed from all a-Syn strains by
Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removing Gel (Thermo Scientific) usually in one run or until endotoxin levels
were below detection level. The sequence of the expressed a-Syn strains was verified by tryptic
digestion followed by MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) or HPLC/ESI tandem MS for total mass was
performed. Purity and monodispersity was determined by Coomassie blue or Silver staining of the
SDS PAGE gel and analytical ultracentrifugation and the concentration was determined by the bicin-
choninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Dialyzed and
lyophilized a-Syn(1-121) was prepared by dialyzing the purified protein in a 2 kD Slide-A-Lyzer unit

 Fibrillization
Fibrils were prepared by dissolving dialyzed and lyophilized, recombinant a-Syn protein at 5 mg/mL
in incubation buffer (DPBS, Gibco; 2.66 mM KCL, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 137.93 mM NaCl, 8.06 mM
Na2HPO4-7H2O pH 7.0–7.3). Reactions of 200 mL per tube were incubated at 37˚C with constant agi-
tation (1,000 rpm) in an orbital mixer (Eppendorf). Reactions were stopped after 5 days, sonicated (5
min in a Branson 2510 water bath), aliquoted, and stored at �80˚C until use. The presence of amy-
loid fibrils was confirmed by thioflavin T fluorimetry and high molecular weight assemblies were visu-
alized by gel electrophoresis.
Electron microscopy
Cryo-EM grids were prepared using a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 95% humidity
at 4˚C. Amyloid fibrils (3 mL aliquots) were applied onto glow-discharged, 300 mesh, copper Quanti-
foil grids. After blotting, grids were plunge frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Sam-
ples were imaged on a Titan Krios (ThermoFisher Scientific) transmission electron microscope,
operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS imaging energy filter (GIF, 20 eV
energy loss window; Gatan Inc.). Images were acquired on a K2 Summit electron counting direct
detection camera (Gatan Inc.) in dose fractionation mode (50 frames) using the Serial EM software
(Mastronarde, 2005) at a magnification of 165,000� (physical pixel size 0.831 A
˚ ) and a total dose
of ~69 electrons per square angstrom (e-/A
˚ 2) for each micrograph. Micrographs were drift-corrected
and
dose-weighted
using
MotionCor2
(Zheng
et
al.,
2017)
through
the
Focus
interface
(Biyani et al., 2017). Additional data collection parameters are detailed in Table 1.
Image processing
Helical reconstruction was carried out with the RELION 2.1 software (Scheres, 2012), using methods
described in He and Scheres (2017). Filaments were manually selected using the helix picker in
RELION 2.1. Filament segments were extracted using a box size of 280 pixels (233 A
˚ ) and an inter-
box distance of 28 pixels. A total of 18,860 segments were extracted from 792 fibrils manually
picked from 118 micrographs (Table 1). 2D classification was carried out with a regularization value
of T = 10, and 2D class averages with a clear separation of b-strands were selected for further data
processing. Power spectra of 2D class averages show the layer line at 1/ (4.9 A
˚ ) with peak intensities
on both sides of the meridian (Bessel order n = 1). This is the result of an approximate 21 screw sym-
metry between a-Syn subunits on the two protofilaments (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Seg-
ments assigned to the best 2D classes were used for 3D classification using a regularization value of
T = 8 and with optimization of the helical twist and rise. For both 3D classification and refinement, a
helical_z_percentage parameter of 10% was used, which defines the size of the central part of the
intermediate asymmetrical reconstruction that is used to apply real-space helical symmetry (He and
Scheres, 2017). An initial reconstruction was calculated using a cylinder generated via the helix tool-
box in RELION 2.1 as initial model. This reconstruction was low-pass filtered to 60 A
˚ and employed
as the initial model for a 3D classification with a single class (K = 1) and T = 20, an approach that
allowed the successful reconstruction of amyloid filaments (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). The handed-
ness of the reconstruction was determined by comparison with atomic force microscopy images,
which showed left-coiled surface patterns for the fibrils.
Refinement was carried out by the auto-refine procedure with optimization of helical twist and
rise. This resulted in a structure with overall resolution of 3.8 A
˚ . Post-processing with a soft-edge
mask and an estimated map sharpening B-factor of �82.6 A
˚ gave a map with a resolution of 3.4 A
˚
(by the FSC 0.143 criterion). An estimation of local resolution was obtained using RELION 2.1 and a
local-resolution-filtered map was calculated for model building and refinement.
Model building and refinement
A model of the a-Syn(1-121) fibril was built into the Relion local resolution-filtered map using COOT
(Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), with the PDB ID 2N0A as an initial model for the early interpretation of
the map. The structure helped to determine the directionality of the protein chain and facilitated the
assignment of densities in the map to specific residues. However, due to the large differences
between the NMR structure and our EM map, major rebuilding was necessary. The high quality of
the EM map allowed us to unambiguously build residues 38–95. A comparison was also carried out

 between our structure and X-ray structures of a-Syn fragments 69–77 (PDB ID 4RIK), 68–78 (PDB ID
4RIL) and 47–56 (PDB ID 4ZNN; with the mutation A53T).
The structure (10 monomers, 5 on each protofilament) was refined against the RELION local reso-
lution-filtered map with PHENIX real space refine (Afonine et al., 2013). Rotamer, Ramachandran
restraints, and ‘NCS’ constraints were imposed, and two B-factors per residue were used during
refinement. For validation, we randomized the coordinates (with a mean shift of 0.3 A
˚ ) and refined
(using the same settings) against one of the refinement half-maps (half-map 1). We then calculated
the FSC between that model (after refinement against half-map 1) and half-map 1, as well as the
FSC between the same model and half-map 2 (against which it was not refined). The lack of large
discrepancies between both FSC curves indicates no overfitting took place.
