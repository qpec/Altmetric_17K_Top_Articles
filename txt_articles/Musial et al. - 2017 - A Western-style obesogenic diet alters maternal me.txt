Key points
r In the Western world, obesogenic diets containing high fat and high sugar (HFHS) are
commonly consumed during pregnancy, although their effects on the metabolism of the
mother, in relation to feto-placental glucose utilization and growth, are unknown.
r In the present study, the consumption of an obesogenic HFHS diet compromised maternal
glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in late pregnancy in association with dysregulated lipid
and glucose handling by the dam.
r These maternal metabolic changes induced by HFHS feeding were related to altered
feto-placental glucose metabolism and growth.
r A HFHS diet during pregnancy therefore causes maternal metabolic dysfunction with
consequences for maternal nutrient allocation for fetal growth.
r These findings have implications for the health of women and their infants, who consume
obesogenic diets during pregnancy.
Abstract In the Western world, obesogenic diets containing high fat and high sugar (HFHS) are
commonly consumed during pregnancy. However, the impacts of a HFHS diet during pregnancy
on maternal insulin sensitivity and signalling in relation to feto-placental growth and glucose
utilization are unknown. The present study examined the effects of a HFHS diet during mouse
pregnancy on maternal glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, as well as, on feto-placental
glucose metabolism. Female mice were fed a control or HFHS diet from day (D) 1 of pregnancy
(term = D20.5). At D16 or D19, dams were assessed for body composition, metabolite and
hormone concentrations, tissue abundance of growth and metabolic signalling pathways, glucose
tolerance and utilization and insulin sensitivity. HFHS feeding perturbed maternal insulin
sensitivity in late pregnancy; hepatic insulin sensitivity was higher, whereas sensitivity of the
skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue was lower in HFHS than control dams. These changes
were accompanied by increased adiposity and reduced glucose production and glucose tolerance
of HFHS dams. The HFHS diet also disturbed the hormone and metabolite milieu and altered
expression of growth and metabolic signalling pathways in maternal tissues. Furthermore, HFHS
feeding was associated with impaired feto-placental glucose metabolism and growth. A HFHS
diet during pregnancy therefore causes maternal metabolic dysfunction with consequences for
maternal nutrient allocation for fetal growth. These findings have implications for the health of
women and their infants, who consume HFHS diets during pregnancy.

Introduction
In the developed Western world, women of child-bearing
age obtain a high proportion of their energy intake
from fat and/or sugar (Balanza et al. 2007; Temme
et al. 2010; Austin et al. 2011). These dietary habits are
contributing to the increasing number of women who gain
excessweightduringpregnancyand/ordevelopgestational
diabetes (GDM); a condition affecting 5–10% of pre-
gnant women (Schieve et al. 1998; Agha-Jaffar et al. 2016;
Koning et al. 2016). Increased maternal fat deposition
and/or obesity during pregnancy are also associated with
health complications for the mother and infant after birth
(Thorsdottir et al. 2002; Berggren et al. 2016). Mothers
gaining excess weight during pregnancy have a greater
probablility of retaining the weight post-delivery and are
at increased risk of obesity, type-2 diabetes and cardio-
vascular disease later in life (Frias & Grove, 2012; Berggren
et al. 2016). Their infants are also often of abnormal
birth weight and more prone to obesity, hypertension
and type-2 diabetes as adults (Thorsdottir et al. 2002;
Oken et al. 2007; Frias & Grove, 2012). Experimental
animal studies have supported the human observational
studies and shown that feeding diets high in fat and/or
sugar during pregnancy programs metabolic dysfunction
in the adult offspring (Khan et al. 2005; Samuelsson et al.
2008; Elahi et al. 2009; Ashino et al. 2012; Franco et al.
2012; Alfaradhi et al. 2014; Fernandez-Twinn et al. 2014).
However, the mechanisms operating during pregnancy
that mediate the programming effects of these diets on the
mother and her offspring remain largely unknown.
To sustain pregnancy and fetal growth, nutrients must
be appropriately partitioned between the gravid uterus
and mother. To achieve this, the mother’s metabolism
is shifted to a more insulin resistant state such that
her own glucose utilization is limited, in favour of fetal
supply (Butte, 2000; Catalano et al. 2002; Musial et al.
2016). Whole body insulin resistance during pregnancy
results from changes in the action of insulin in the liver,
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These adaptations are
assumed to be signalled, in part by changes in placental
hormone production. In non-pregnant animals, insulin
resistance and altered insulin signalling in these tissues
are observed in response to feeding Western-style diets
high in fat and sugar (HFHS) (Um et al. 2004; Wang
et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). However, the effects
of feeding HFHS diets during pregnancy on insulin
sensitivity and tissue insulin signalling pathways in the
pregnant mother remain unknown. Furthermore, it is not
clear whether feto-placental glucose utilization is altered
in these circumstances. Therefore, the present study aimed
to examine the effects of a HFHS diet during mouse
pregnancy on maternal glucose tolerance and insulin
resistance and on feto-placental glucose metabolism. It
also determined the effect of HFHS feeding on placental
expression of prolactin/placental lactogen (Prl/Pl) related
genes, which change with gestational age and have
proposed metabolic effects in the mother (Simmons et al.
2008).
Methods
Animals
All experiments were carried out under the UK Home
Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, following
ethical review by the University of Cambridge. C57Bl/6
females were housed under a 12:12 h dark/light photocycle
with free access to water and a standard rodent diet (RM3;
Special Dietary Services, Witham, UK). At 8–12 weeks
of age, 92 females were mated with C57Bl/6 males and
the day of copulatory plug detection was defined as day
(D)1 of pregnancy. From D1, females were maintained
on either the standard diet (n = 50) or were fed a
HFHS diet (n = 42). The nutritional composition of
both diets has been reported previously (Sferruzzi-Perri
et al. 2013). All procedures were performed on either
D16 or D19 of pregnancy and mice were allocated for
tissue and blood collection, a glucose tolerance test or a
hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp.
Tissue and blood collection
Between 08.00 and 10.00 h, unfasted pregnant dams
(n = 10 per diet, per age) were weighed and anaesthetized
(10 μl g−1 fentanyl-fluanisone:midazolam in sterile water,
1:1:2; I.P.; Janssen Animal Health, Beerse, Belgium). A
cardiac blood sample was taken before death by cervical
dislocation. Liver and retroperitoneal white adipose tissue
(WAT) were dissected, weighed and snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen for western blotting. Maternal skeletal
muscle (biceps femoris) was also dissected and snap
frozen.Bloodglucoseconcentrationsweremeasuredusing
a hand-held glucometer (One Touch Ultra; LifeScan,
Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd, Livingston, UK). At D19,

dehydrated and embedded into paraffin wax before
sectioning at 8 μm and staining with haematoxylin and
eosin. Tissues and blood taken from dams in the pre-
viously published cohort (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013),
contributed to the samples used for biometrical and
biochemical analyses on the mother and placental gene
expression.
Glucose tolerance test (GTT)
Conscious dams underwent a GTT on D16 or D19
(n = 6–9 per diet, per age) after fasting from 08.00 h
for 6 h. Blood samples (�5 μl) were taken from the
tail vein immediately before I.P. glucose administration
(10% w/v, 1 g kg−1 body weight) and, subsequently,
at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min to measure glucose
concentrations as above. Mice were then killed by cervical
dislocation.
Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (HEC)
The
HEC was performed as described previously
(Musial et al. 2016) on D19 mice. Mice fasted for

maintained at 37°C using a servo-controlled thermo-
pad (Harvard Instruments, Cambournse, UK). After
catheterizing a tail vein,
D-3H-glucose was infused
continuously (0.006 MBq min−1 in PBS, 50 μl h−1, I.V.,
370–740 GBq mmol−1; PerkinElmer, Wokingham, UK).
After steady-state was achieved at 60 min (basal state,
�3.5 h fasted), two blood samples were taken 10 min
apart. Insulin was then injected as a bolus (3.3 mU,
I.V.; human insulin; Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd,
Denmark) followed by infusion (0.09 mU min−1) together
with the D-3H-glucose. Blood glucose concentrations were
monitored throughout the protocol and a variable rate
glucose infusion (12.5% w/v PBS, Sigma, I.V.) was begun
10minlatertomaintainbloodglucoseatmeanbasallevels.
At 50 min after insulin administration, 2-deoxy-glucose
(14C-2DG, specific activity: 9.25–13.0 GBq mmol−1;
PerkinElmer) was injected I.V. By 70 min of insulin
administration, blood glucose levels were clamped at basal
concentrations and a further three blood samples were
collected at 10 min intervals. Mice were then killed by
cervical dislocation and samples of biceps femoris and
white adipose tissue were collected together with the
fetus and placenta adjacent to the cervix in each horn
(n = 2 fetuses and placentas per litter) for analysis of
tissue 14C-2DG content. Rates of glucose utilization and
production and whole body and hepatic insulin sensitivity
were calculated as described previously (Voshol et al.
2001).

(MP Biomedicals, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Sferruzzi-Perri
etal.2011).PlasmainsulinconcentrationsduringtheHEC
were measured by ELISA (Crystal Chem, Inc., Downer’s
Grove, IL, USA), which detected both mouse and human
(Musial et al. 2016).
Tissue biochemical composition
Hepatic glycogen content was measured enzymatically
using amyloglucosidase as reported previously (Roehrig
& Allred, 1974). The fat content of the liver and
pooled samples of skeletal muscle were measured using
the modified Folch method (Folch et al. 1957). To
determine tissue phosphorylated 2DG (p2DG) content,
maternal tissues and whole fetuses were homogenized in
0.5% perochloric acid and the homogenates neutralized
to separate p2DG from 2DG by precipitation before
scintillation counting, as described previously (Musial
et al. 2016).
Tissue protein expression
Proteins were extracted (�50–100 mg, n = 5–6 per diet
per age) from the maternal liver, skeletal muscle and WAT
for assessment of insulin signalling and lipid metabolism
pathways using western blotting as described previously
(Musial et al. 2016). In addition, phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
(PEPCK)
and
glucose
6-phosphatase
(G6Pase) were detected using antibodies from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (sc-32789 and
sc-27198, respectively). Protein bands were quantified
usingImageJ(NationalInstitutesofHealth,Bethesda,MD,
USA). To control for variations in loading, expression of
the proteins of interest was normalized to a corresponding
bandofsimilarmolecularweightontheponceauS-stained
membrane.
Placental gene expression
RNA was extracted from placentas with the second light-
est weight for the litter using the RNeasy Plus Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK). RNA was then reverse
transcribed using Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase with
random primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) and analysed in duplicate using Taqman assays
for Prl/Pl-related genes, Prl5a1, Prl2b1, Prl7b1, Prl7a2,
Prl3d1 and Prl3b1 (Mm00517851 m1, Mm01163874 m1,

and Mm00435852 m1, respectively) and the housekeepers
Hprt and Gadph (Mm00446968 and Mm99999915 g1,
respectively). The genes of interest were normalized to
the geometric mean expression levels of the housekeepers,
which remained constant across diets and age. Data were

2013).
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as the mean ± SEM. All statistical
analyses and calculations were performed using Prism
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The effect
of diet at different ages was assessed using an unpaired
ttest.Changeswithinthesamedietarygroupwereassessed
by a paired t test. In the GTT protocol, the changes in
glucose concentration were analysed by two-way ANOVA
with time as a repeated measure and the area under the
curve (AUC) calculated using the trapezoid rule. P < 0.05
was considered statistically sigificant.
Results
Biometry
OnD16ofpregnancy,wholebodybutnothysterectomized
weight was lower for HFHS compared to control dams
(Table 1). HFHS dams had a lighter liver but greater white
adipose tissue (retroperitoneal fat, WAT) mass compared
to control dams on D16. There were no significant changes
inmaternalbiometrywithdietatD19(Table2).HFHSdiet
reduced both fetal and placental weight on D16, whereas
only placental weight remained significantly decreased on
D19 (Tables 1 and 2). There was no effect of diet at either
time point on the ratio of fetal to placental weight per
litter, nor any affect on litter size (Tables 1 and 2).
Metabolites and hormone concentrations
In the fed state, HFHS dams were hyperglycaemic,
hyperinsulinaemic,
hyperleptinaemic
and
hyper-
cholesterolaemic at D16 but not at D19 (Tables 1 and
2). They remained hyperglycaemic in the fasted state at
D16 (Table 1). Plasma TG and IGF1 concentrations were
lower in HFHS compared to control dams at D16 but not
at D19 (Tables 1 and 2). Plasma NEFAs were unaffected at
D16 but were decreased at D19 by HFHS feeding (Tables 1
and 2). There was no effect of a HFHS diet on maternal
plasma corticosterone concentrations on either D16 or
D19 of pregnancy (Tables 1 and 2).

Obesogenic diet impairs gestational metabolic physiology

Tissue biochemical composition
Hepatic protein and glycogen content did not differ with
diet at either stage of pregnancy (Tables 1 and 2). Hepatic
fat content was higher in HFHS compared to control
dams at D19 but not at D16, when expressed both as
total weight and as a proportion of liver weight (Tables 1
and 2). Histological staining confirmed intrahepatic fat
accumulation in D19 HSHF-fed dams (Fig. 1A–D). In
skeletal muscle, protein content was lower, whereas fat
content tended to be higher in HFHS compared to control
dams at D19 only (Table 2). Protein content of WAT was
lower in HFHS compared to control dams at both ages
(Tables 1 and 2).
Glucose tolerance
There was no significant difference in the increment in
blood glucose or in the glucose AUC with diet at D16,
although glucose concentrations appeared to be higher
and remain elevated for longer in HFHS dams (Fig. 2A
and B). At D19, the glucose increment in HFHS dams
was greater at 30, 45 and 60 min compared to control
values (Fig. 2C). Consequently, HSHF feeding led to a
greater AUC (Fig. 2D), indicative of diet-induced glucose
intolerance in late pregnancy.
Insulin sensitivity
Whole body and hepatic insulin sensitivity were examined
by HEC on D19. In both groups, blood glucose

handling, a disturbed hormone and metabolite milieu,
and altered expression of growth and metabolic signalling
pathways in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue of the mother. Moreover, the maternal metabolic
changes induced by HFHS feeding were related to altered
feto-placental glucose metabolism and growth, as well
as Prl/Pl-related gene expression in the placenta. A
HFHS diet during pregnancy therefore, causes maternal
metabolic dysfunction with consequences for maternal
nutrient allocation for fetal growth. These findings have
implications for the health of women and their infants in
the Western world where HFHS diets are common during
pregnancy.
The HFHS diet resulted in increased maternal adiposity
during pregnancy; there was an expansion of WAT mass
(significant at D16) and accumulation of fat in the
liver and skeletal muscle at D19. Consistent with this,
hepatic, skeletal muscle and WAT expression of lipogenic
proteins were upregulated and/or lipid oxidation markers
downregulated in HFHS dams at D19. Hepatic steatosis
has previously been reported in pregnant rodents fed high
fructose or high-fat diets (Zou et al. 2012; Heerwagen
et al. 2013). However, in the dams of the present study,
the abundance of some lipogenic proteins was decreased,
which may be a compensatory response to prevent further
lipidaccumulationinmaternaltissueswithHFHSfeeding.
In the skeletal muscle and WAT, the accumulation of lipids
came at the expense of tissue protein. This was in line with
diminished signalling via the protein synthesis pathway,
mTORC1, in these tissues, as well as the increased whole
body adiposity but reduced lean mass and dietary protein
intake reported previously for dams on this HFHS diet
(Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013). The HFHS diet also affected
conceptus mass, with a reduced weight of the fetus and
placenta on D16 and a reduced placental weight on D19,
as reported previously (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013). Taken

together, these data suggest a global shift in nutrient
partitioning between the dam and gravid uterus with
HFHS feeding.
The HFHS diet also led to abnormal metabolite and
hormone concentrations in the dam during pregnancy,
particularly at D16, in line with previous observations
of obese pregnant women with and without GDM
(Uebel et al. 2014). Plasma triglycerides, weight of the
maternal liver and the liver-derived hormone, IGF1, in
the circulation were all reduced in HFHS dams at D16.
Reduced IGF1 may have contributed to the increased
adiposity and diminished lean mass of HFHS dams
because maternal endocrine IGFI is known to reduce
adiposity and increase amino acid uptake by skeletal
muscleinpregnantguinea-pigs(Sferruzzi-Perrietal.2006;
Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2007a,b). Hypotriglyceridaemia has
been reported in fructose fed rats that also show increased
adiposity during pregnancy (Jen et al. 1991) and, in both
the present study and previous studies, this may reflect
a redistribution of triglycerides with greater storage in
maternal tissues and less in the circulation. Maternal liver
weight was no longer reduced in HFHS dams at D19 in
the present study, which paralleled an increase in hepatic
activation of the growth-promoting, MAPK signalling
pathway by D19. Moreover, circulating hormones and
metabolites had normalized in HFHS dams by this stage
of pregnancy. Normalization of maternal glycaemia near
term was also observed previously in pregnant rodents fed
high-fat or sucrose diets (Jen et al. 1991; Liang et al. 2010).
In the present study, plasma NEFAs were lower in HFHS
compared to control dams on D19, which is consistent
with previous observations in near-term pregnant mice
fed high-fat diets (Heerwagen et al. 2013). By contrast, in
obeseandGDMwomenNEFAconcentrationsareelevated

& Scholl, 2008).

insulin resistance, although overt glucose intolerance
was not observed until D19. Late gestational glucose
intolerance has also been reported in mice fed a HFHS
diet from before pregnancy; however, this was associated
with fetal overgrowth (Rosario et al. 2015), which is
similar to a subset of mothers with obesity. Impaired
pancreatic β cell proliferation may have contributed to
the glucose intolerance of HFHS dams. Proliferation
of the β cells during mouse pregnancy depends on
placental secretion of PRL/PL-related proteins (Brelje
et al. 1993). A HFHS diet reduced placental expression
of Prl/Pl-related genes on D16, which may have had
consequences for β cell proliferation and the ability to
respond to acute hyperglycemia (Huang et al. 2009).
Further experiments measuring insulin concentrations
during the glucose tolerance test are required to establish
the relative importance of insulin secretion vs. insulin
action with respect to the glucose intolerance induced by
HFHS feeding.
At D19, a higher rate of glucose infusion was needed
to maintain euglycaemia in HFHS than control dams.
This was unexpected and suggested that HFHS feeding
increased, rather than decreased, whole body insulin
sensitivity of the dam. However, compared to controls,
the maternal liver of HFHS dams was more sensitive to
insulin at D19 because insulin more effectively suppressed
EGP, which is consistent with the increased hepatic insulin
receptor abundance. Even at D16, there was evidence of
increasedhepaticinsulinsignallinginHFHSdamsbecause
phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-p85α expression and
Akt activation (pAkt T308 at D16 and pAkt S473 at
both D16 and D19) were enhanced compared to controls.
Increased insulin signalling via the PI3K-Akt pathway
may have contributed to the observed fatty liver in

HFHS-fed dams because deletion of genes in this pathway
protects against high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in
non-pregnant mice (Leavens et al. 2009; Chattopadhyay
et al. 2011). However, whole body glucose utilization
was lower in both basal and hyperinsulinaemic states
and glucose utilization during hyperinsulinaemia by the
skeletal muscle was diminished in HFHS dams. Moreover,
expression of several components of the insulin signalling
pathway was downregulated in the skeletal muscle and
WAT of HFHS dams on D16 and D19 and may have
mediated the decreased expression of lipogenic markers
in these tissues, in contrast to the hepatic data. In line
with this, a diet high in sugar and/or fat reduced insulin
sensitivity index and insulin responsiveness of isolated
fat cells in late pregnant rats (Jen et al. 1991; Holemans
et al. 2004) and decreased whole body insulin sensitivity
and glucose uptake by the hindlimb in pregnant dogs
(Moore et al. 2011; Woolcott et al. 2015). Furthermore,
womenwithGDMdisplayeddecreasedwholebodyinsulin
sensitivity, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue insulin
signalling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during
pregnancy (Garvey et al. 1993; Friedman et al. 1999;
Shao et al. 2000; Catalano et al. 2002; Shao et al. 2002).
Overall, the results of the present study indicate that
HFHS feeding affects tissue insulin resistance in some,
but not all, maternal tissues during mouse pregnancy
(Fig. 11).
At D19, the liver of HFHS-fed dams produced
less glucose endogenously in both basal and hyper-
insulinaemic states than controls. This was coupled to
decreased hepatic expression of G6Pase, the rate-limiting
enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
G6Pase is inhibited by insulin (van Schaftingen & Gerin,
2002) and its downregulation is consistent with increased
hepatic insulin sensitivity and insulin receptor expression
in HFHS dams. However, HFHS feeding did not cause
an accumulation of glycogen in the maternal liver. This
may have been secondary to the disrupted mTORC1
signalling observed in the liver of HFHS-fed dams because
the mTORC1 pathway regulates glycogen synthase, the
enzyme responsible for producing glycogen (Wang et al.
2011). Reduced maternal glucogenesis is consistent with
a higher dietary sugar intake and would explain the
increased rate of glucose infusion required to maintain
euglycaemia in the HFHS relative to control dams,
especially given the large drain of glucose into the gravid
uterus at D19. By decreasing glucose availability between
feeding periods, the lower rates of gluconeogenesis could
also have contributed to the restricted growth of the
placenta and the lower body weights of the fetuses
observed both in the present and previous studies at D16
(Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013), when fetal growth is more
dependent on glucose than amino acid availability (Coan
et al. 2011).
The fetuses of the HFHS dams achieved a normal
weight near term (both in the present and previous
studies; Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013). This occurred despite
a smaller placenta and a reduced rate of glucose utilization,

indicated by the lower p2DG accumulation in the HFHS
fetusesatD19.ThesedatasuggestthatfetusesinHFHS-fed
dams must use substrates other than glucose for growth
and oxidative metabolism during late gestation. Indeed,
previous studies have shown transfer of amino acids
by the System A transporters, per unit surface area, is
increased near term in HSHF-fed dams (Sferruzzi-Perri
et al. 2013; Rosario et al. 2015). Moreover, placental
FATP1 expression was upregulated by HFHS feeding on
D19 (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013) suggesting that there
may also be an increased materno-placental supply of
NEFAs to the HFHS fetuses. Fetal growth is correlated
with placental amino acid but not glucose supply on D19
of mouse pregnancy (Coan et al. 2011) and an increased
maternal supply of fats during pregnancy resulted in fatty
liver in offspring (Elahi et al. 2009; McCurdy et al. 2009;
Ashino et al. 2012; Alfaradhi et al. 2014). Collectively,
these data show that the placental supply and fetal
use of metabolic substrates are altered by a HFHS diet
during pregnancy with potential consequences for fetal
developmentandtheprogrammingofoffspringmetabolic
phenotype (Samuelsson et al. 2008; Sferruzzi-Perri et al.
2013). Further work is required to determine the
relationship between maternal glucose-insulin dynamics
and feto-placental glucose metabolism and growth in pre-
gnancies in which the mother started to eat a HFHS diet
prior to pregnancy.
In
summary,
HFHS
feeding
during
pregnancy
differentially altered insulin sensitivity of maternal tissues,
with increased hepatic insulin sensitivity but decreased
sensitivity of the skeletal muscle and WAT (Fig. 11). These
changes were accompanied by increased adiposity and
reduced glucose production and glucose tolerance of the
dam in late pregnancy. They were also related to impaired
nutrient partitioning between the mother and the gravid
uterus and, hence, feto-placental growth and metabolism.
The changes in maternal metabolism, placental phenotype
(Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013) and fetal growth induced by
HFHS feeding during pregnancy may explain, in part,
the early life programming of adult disease by maternal
obesity and obesogenic diets. They may also shed light on
the mechanisms by which altered maternal-fetal resource
allocation during pregnancy increases the risk of poor
health in the mother post-partum.
