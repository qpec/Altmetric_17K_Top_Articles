Abstract
Background: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) frequently complain of cognitive difficulties such as problems with
concentration and clouding of thought, yet this has scarcely been objectively defined and underlying mechanisms remain
unknown.
Objective: The objective of this article is to objectively measure cognitive impairments in patients with CD compared with
healthy controls, and if present, to identify potentially modifiable, contributing factors associated with cognitive impairment.
Methods: CD patients and healthy age-/sex-matched controls completed surveys encompassing clinical, demographic,
psychiatric, fatigue and sleep parameters. Contemporaneously, disease activity assessment with serum CRP, faecal calpro-
tectin, Harvey–Bradshaw Index and the Subtle Cognitive Impairment test (SCIT) were performed, with the primary measure
of response time (SCIT-RT) compared between groups. Multiple linear regression assessed for factors associated with slower
SCIT-RT, denoting subtle cognitive impairment.
Results: A total of 49 CD and 31 control individuals participated, with median age 44 years (range 22–65) and 43 years
(21–63), respectively. Compared to controls, SCIT-RT was slower across all timepoints in CD patients (ANOVA p < 0.001). In
multivariate analysis, serum CRP (standardised beta coefficient 0.27, 95% CI (0.02, 0.51)), abdominal pain (0.43 (0.16, 0.70)),
plasma haemoglobin (1.55 (1.42, 1.68)), and concurrent fatigue (0.56 (0.25, 0.88)) were each independently associated with
slower SCIT-RT in CD (each p < 0.05), with a trend for poorer sleep quality 0.54 (�0.03, 1.11) (p ¼ 0.06), yet conversely,
higher faecal calprotectin titres were associated with faster SCIT-RT (�1.77 (�1.79, �1.76), p < 0.01).
Conclusions: Patients with CD demonstrated subtle cognitive impairment utilising the objective SCIT, correlating with sys-
temic inflammation and other disease burden measures, although higher faecal calprotectin titres were unexpectedly
associated with less cognitive impairment.

Introduction
Chronic diseases like Crohn’s disease (CD) have wide-
ranging effects on health and normal function beyond
classic symptoms like diarrhoea and abdominal pain.
These include effects on the brain, as depicted by the
increased incidence of psychological stress, mood dis-
order and neurological sequelae in CD.1–3 Moreover,
patients with CD frequently complain of vague symp-
toms such as difficulty concentrating and clouding of
thought, which align with the notion that cognitive dys-
function is a major concern for sufferers, yet it is often

 ignored by clinicians. Few studies have demonstrated
that cognitive dysfunction is more prevalent in patients
with chronic diseases like CD compared to healthy con-
trols.4,5 Nonetheless, this is an important consideration,
as even if the decrements in cognitive function in CD
are subtle,6 such deficits can have serious consequences,
such as an increased risk of motor vehicle or workplace
accidents.7,8
The Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test (SCIT)9,10 is
sufficiently sensitive to detect mild cognitive impair-
ment in elderly individuals with Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) scores in the normal range
(�24 points) and has been used and validated in
many healthy and diseased study populations, includ-
ing coeliac disease.10–13 Based on our observations that
those with active CD are more likely to report severe
cognitive fatigue,14 plus the concept of a ‘cytokine
hypothesis’ for depression in chronic disease,15 we
hypothesised that systemic CD-related inflammation
may
be
associated
with
cognitive
impairment
in
patients with CD. To address this hypothesis, the
SCIT was applied to address two aims: (i) to compare
cognitive function in patients with CD with demo-
graphically matched healthy controls; and (ii) to separ-
ate disease-related and patient-related factors that
might be associated with the cognitive dysfunction. It
is anticipated that the identification of modifiable fac-
tors could provide potential pathways for therapeutic
application.
Materials and methods
Setting and recruitment
A cross-sectional, observational study was performed
in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CD according
to standard histological, endoscopic and/or imaging
criteria. Patients were recruited from the Box Hill
Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Clinic, a
metropolitan outpatient clinic providing secondary and
tertiary IBD care. Relevant clinical and demographic
data were extracted from the patients’ medical records
and the IBD clinic database. Healthy volunteers were
recruited via advertisement in local hospital notices, the
local community newspaper and university newsletters/
bulk emails. All study participants were aged between
18 and 65 years, were able to understand English and
give
written,
informed
consent.
Participants
were
excluded if they had any known major medical comor-
bidity that may potentially affect cognition, independ-
ent of their CD, including neurological/ neuromuscular
disorders, advanced renal, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary
and/or thyroid disorders, were known to be pregnant
and/or if they consumed �40 g of alcohol per day on
average.
Survey
Prior to the study visit, all prospective participants were
required to complete a survey either online or on paper
sent via mail, comprising part of a larger study
described
elsewhere.14
The
survey
included
the
Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) to assess
for comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Initially vali-
dated in hospital clinics, it has since been used and
validated in chronic diseases including IBD, with
scores >7 indicating possible and >11 probable ‘case-
ness’ for anxiety and/or depression.16 The Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess partici-
pants’ sleep quality in the past month, providing a
global sleep quality score ranging from 0 to 21 – a
higher score equalling poorer sleep quality. An empir-
ically derived cut-off score >5 indicates poor sleep qual-
ity.17 The PSQI has been validated in healthy and
diseased
populations,18,19
and
used
previously
in
IBD.20 Also the Fatigue Impact scale (FIS, 40 items),
with particular reference to the cognitive fatigue dimen-
sion in this study (10 items), was applied as in multiple
studies previously in IBD.5,21 The FIS asks the partici-
pant to rate his or her fatigue in the past month in
reference to each item’s statement on a scale of 0
(no problem) to 4 (extreme problem). The cognitive
fatigue subscore of the FIS has a maximum possible
score of 40, indicating severe cognitive fatigue.22
The survey also comprised demographic informa-
tion, medical, psychiatric and medication history and,
for patients with CD, detailed questioning on disease
history including surgical, admission and treatment
data. Initial non-responders were sent two reminders
after six and 12 weeks, respectively, and were also con-
tacted via phone to maximise the return of surveys and
study participation (see Figure 1).
Study visit. All recruited individuals completed a visit
with the primary investigator (DvL) during which par-
ticipants gave informed consent and further up-to-date
demographic and disease-related information could be
gleaned. In patients with CD, disease activity was
assessed at the time of interview using the Harvey–
Bradshaw Index (HBI)23 with active disease defined as
an HBI � 5. Participants provided a faecal sample for
measurement of calprotectin concentration, and a
sample of peripheral blood was taken for detailed path-
ology testing as outlined elsewhere.24 Individuals were
excluded if any of the following tests/data were
incomplete.
Cognitive testing
During the study visit above, each participant per-
formed the SCIT.9,10 This test requires a participant
to make a decision regarding which of two lines,
580
United European Gastroenterology Journal 5(4)
 presented very briefly on a computer screen, is the
shorter. The visual stimulus is presented for varying
durations, with the shorter side appearing randomly
on the left or right side. Two psychometric measures
are recorded: error rate (SCIT-ER) and response time
(SCIT-RT). These are divided according to whether the
stimulus was on the screen long enough for conscious
inspection. Thus responses to stimulus durations of less
than 65 ms are referred to as the ‘head’ of the data
curve, while responses to stimulus durations of longer
than 65 ms comprise the ‘tail’. The SCIT takes four
minutes; it can detect small decrements in cognition
and has no learning effect, or gender or cultural bias.
The SCIT does not measure performance in specific
cognitive domains, such as memory. Rather it is a
global measure of cognition that is sensitive to decre-
ments in signal processing that underpin most cognitive
domains. The SCIT head component is a measure of
conscious and subconscious signal processing speed,
while the tail component is more concerned with the
efficacy
of
conscious
and
subconscious
decision
making.25,26
Statistical analysis
Grouped data (between CD patients and healthy con-
trols) were examined descriptively and normality was
assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Given that the
SCIT-RT and SCIT-ER variables conformed to a
Gaussian distribution, the mean with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) are presented, and one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) tests were applied to compare
SCIT-RT and SCIT-ER between the groups across all
exposure durations of the SCIT. Also in the CD group,
exploratory bivariate comparisons using Pearson cor-
relations, then subsequently a multiple linear regression
analysis were conducted with head and tail response
(difference from the mean of healthy controls in each
case) as the dependent variables. A stepwise model was
used and variables were kept continuous wherever pos-
sible. Variables were included in the multivariate model
on the basis of statistically significant (or trending
towards) bivariate associations with SCIT-RTH (head)
and
SCIT-RTT
(tail)
as
well
as
those
variables
considered to be of importance/relevance to cognitive
dysfunction and/or CD pathogenesis (including age,
symptom-based disease activity score (HBI, including
abdominal pain and diarrhoea subscores), cognitive
fatigue
and
duration
since
diagnosis
of
CD).
A p value < 0.05 was deemed to be statistically signifi-
cant in all analyses.

vs 551.1 ms (523.4, 578.8) for controls (two-tailed t-test,
p ¼ 0.01) and mean SCIT-RTT for CD of 571.0 (545.4,
596.6) vs 521.2 (500.3, 542.2) (t-test, p ¼ 0.01) for con-
trols (Figure 2). Error rates (SCIT-ER) were, however,
not statistically different between the groups (Figure 3)
with the mean SCIT-ERH for CD of 0.12 (0.10, 0.15) vs
0.13 (0.10, 0.16) (t-test, p ¼ 0.7) for controls and mean
SCIT-ERT for CD of 0.016 (0.01, 0.02) vs 0.018 (0.01,
0.03) for controls (p ¼ 0.7).
Factors associated with impaired SCIT-RT
On bivariate analysis, multiple variables were significantly
associated with a slower SCIT-RTH, including total HBI
(and
including
subscores
HBI-well-being
and
HBI-
abdominal pain) and fatigue (as per FIS, including
cognitive fatigue subscore) (each p< 0.05). There were
non-significant
trends
towards
correlation
between
SCIT-RTH and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP), HADS anxiety score and disease duration since
diagnosis. There was an unexpected inverse correlation
between faecal calprotectin concentration and SCIT-
RTH (r¼ �0.38, p< 0.01). Yet when assessing the sub-
group only with ‘active disease’ defined by an HBI � 5,
this relationship between calprotectin and SCIT-RTH did
not persist (r¼ �0.18, p¼ 0.5).

 Regarding a slower SCIT-RTT, HBI-well-being and
HBI-abdominal pain subscores, serum CRP and fatigue
(relevantly the cognitive FIS subscore) were signifi-
cantly
correlated,
but
only
non-significant
trends
existed for total HBI, HADS anxiety score and inver-
sely for faecal calprotectin (Table 3).
Incorporating the above variables and others puta-
tively important in cognitive dysfunction in CD, the
multivariate linear regression analyses for each depend-
ent variable are also shown in Table 3. Factors inde-
pendently and significantly associated with slower
SCIT-RTH included a higher serum CRP, more severe
abdominal pain (as per HBI subscore), poorer sleep
quality (PSQI score) and a higher cognitive FIS fatigue
score (each p < 0.05). Interestingly, a higher plasma
haemoglobin
(Hb)
was
positively
associated,
yet
faecal calprotectin level was again inversely associated
with SCIT-RTH (each p < 0.01).
The only factor significantly associated with a slower
SCIT-RTT when correcting for other variables in the
multivariate analysis was serum CRP, whereas there
were non-significant trends for HADS anxiety score
(p ¼ 0.06) and once again inversely for faecal calprotec-
tin (log concentration, p ¼ 0.08).
Discussion
Response times, as measured by the computer-based
SCIT, were slower across all exposure durations in
patients with CD compared to well-matched healthy
controls. These results objectively and definitively dem-
onstrate the presence of subtle cognitive impairment in
patients with CD. The impairment was limited to
response times as there was no discernible difference
between CD and control groups in the rates of errors
made during the SCIT. The present results support the
anecdotal observations of difficulties with concentra-
tion, clouding of thought and memory lapses that are
frequently reported to clinicians by patients with CD.
The presence of deficits in response time but not in
error rates indicates that patients with CD have impair-
ments in the speed of signal processing rather than in
the efficiency of processing or decision making.25
Importantly, this decrement in the speed of processing
was equivalent for exposure durations in both the head
and tail of the response curve, suggesting that the
impairment is due to problems in rapid automatic pro-
cesses that are involved in detecting, coding and inte-
grating perceptual information. It is noteworthy that
the slowed response times were significantly correlated
with clinical indices of inflammation, such as the HBI
scores and serum titres of CRP. This finding is consist-
ent with recent reports that elevations in serum titres of
cytokines, including CRP, are associated with signifi-
cant increases in response times on cognitive tasks in
middle-aged and elderly populations.27,28 While the
basis of this effect is not fully understood, experiments
on rodents have shown that inflammation of the colon
results in an upregulation of inflammatory activity in
microglia of the hippocampus that in turn causes

 profound impairments in post-synaptic responses.29 If
such decrements in post-synaptic responsiveness occur
in humans with CD, they could readily account for the
slower response times observed in the present study.
The strong association of poorer sleep quality with
cognitive dysfunction is another salient finding of this
study, given the prevalence of sleep disturbance in CD
patients and the potentially cumulative effects of poor
sleep quality on cognition.30 Overall self-reported,
nightly sleep durations were generally longer in CD
than control participants in this study, thus implying
a problem of greater sleep disturbance in CD within
sleep, rather than the overall amount of sleep per se.
Perhaps more intriguing, however, was the positive
association
between
higher
Hb
titres
and
slower
SCIT-RTH. In this cohort very few participants were
anaemic with Hb < 100 g/l, precluding the opportunity
to assess for lower Hb effects on cognition, which are
well described,31 but there are also studies demonstrat-
ing that higher Hb titres may be associated with cogni-
tive dysfunction. These include a study by Shah et al.32
which demonstrated a link between higher Hb and
slower perceptual speed, which is a similar construct
to that measured by SCIT-RTH.
The inverse correlation of faecal calprotectin with
cognitive function might appear counterintuitive, but
we were anticipating no relationship since systemic
inflammation is often discordant with intestinal inflam-
mation. For instance in this cohort, there were no sig-
nificant correlations between faecal calprotectin and

 HBI or CRP (each p > 0.05), whereas CRP significantly
correlated both with HBI and cognitive function. As a
quantitative global measure of intestinal inflammation
at one point in time, calprotectin is unhelpful for com-
paring the degree of inflammation between individuals
given its concentration is dependent on multiple factors
including the location and extent of inflammation and
may be confounded by concurrent rectal bleeding,
medications and gastrointestinal (GI) infection.
The present study is the first to use an objective
measure to demonstrate that patients with CD have
impaired cognition compared to healthy controls. Our
team previously showed that patients with untreated
celiac disease exhibit impaired performance on the
SCIT that improves when the patients adhere to a
gluten-free diet.12 Similarly, Hollerbach and colleagues
(published only in abstract form) reported that electro-
physiological testing showed that patients with IBD
had higher mean peak P300 latencies, suggestive of
short-term memory disturbances, compared to con-
trols.33
Other
studies
have
used a
semi-objective
approach, utilising multiple questionnaires or paper-
based test including the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
of Intelligence (WASI) to assess cognitive function in
patient groups with IBD, irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) and healthy controls.34,35 Dancey et al. demon-
strated a deficit in verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) as a
measure of higher cognitive processing in the IBD
group compared to both the IBS and control groups.
Kennedy et al. showed cognitive deficits in both their
CD and IBS groups compared to controls, though com-
paratively CD patients had less memory disturbance,
but similar to our study, exhibited more abnormal
executive functioning, particularly slower response
times (i.e. Stroop interference effect).29,30,36,37 Thus it
may be postulated that cognitive dysfunction in IBD
and IBS may share some underlying pathophysiology
(such as cofactors of abdominal symptom burden and
psychiatric comorbidity) but also exhibit disorder-
specific mechanisms, which may include effects of
Crohn’s-related systemic inflammation.
Prior studies in IBD and those in other chronic dis-
eases may have been stymied by the fact that the
differences between normal and impaired cognition
are typically subtle. The main question then is whether
the subtle cognitive impairments in individuals with CD
are clinically or functionally meaningful. Although
definitively answering this question is beyond the
scope of the current study, a mean difference of over
50 ms in SCIT-RTH scores between the CD and healthy
control groups is of a greater magnitude than the
change in the same measure in healthy volunteers
after consuming sufficient alcohol to reach a mean
peak
blood
alcohol
concentration
of
just
above
0.05 g/100 ml (over the legal limit for driving a motor
vehicle in Australia and most European Union (EU)-
zone countries). Although many people with CD func-
tion effectively in their chosen work or study, it remains
uncertain whether a patient who reports decreased cog-
nitive performance should, from a societal perspective,
continue in performance-critical roles such as driving a
bus, working as an air traffic controller or as a surgeon
operating during a 24-hour on-call shift.
The current study has limitations. The cross-sec-
tional, observational design does not enable assessment
of causality or of longitudinal changes in cognition,
including
treatment
effects.
Second,
the
relatively
small sample size prevented a more detailed assessment
of the relationship between cognitive impairment and
CD-related inflammation. Third, there is the potential
for selection bias given the ‘captive’ recruitment of con-
secutive CD patients from a specialist clinic vs our
‘open’ recruitment of healthy controls who volunteered
in response to advertisements. Fourth, the anomalous
inverse relationship between faecal calprotectin and
cognitive function cannot be easily explained in this
study from a clinical nor a theoretical perspective and
warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, strengths
of this study include the quality of matching between
CD and control groups in terms of relevant confoun-
ders (such as age, sex, educational attainment and
employment status). Even more important is the use
of an entirely objective, operator-dependent test that
enabled the detection of cognitive impairment that
may have gone undetected by standard pencil and
paper tests.25
In summary, this study has objectively demonstrated
the presence of subtle cognitive impairment in a clinic-
based cohort of CD patients compared with well-
matched controls using the SCIT computer-based test.
The results suggest that CD-related cognitive impair-
ment is strongly linked with systemic inflammation
yet is inversely related to intestinal mucosal inflamma-
tion, and might be a consequence of an amalgam of
‘indirect’
disease
effects,
including
the
cumulative
burden and duration of CD, comorbid anxiety and
sleep disturbance. While further research is required
to define the impact of this cognitive impairment on
normal activities of daily living, the results of this
study reinforce the long-held notion that CD is a multi-
systemic disease with wide-ranging consequences.
