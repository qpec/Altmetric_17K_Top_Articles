ABSTRACT
Objective: Previous studies have estimated future PD
prevalence based on population aging. This study
revisits that projection by accounting for the potential
impact of declining rates of smoking.
Methods:
The
age-
and
gender-stratified
smoking
prevalence in the United States from 2000 to 2040
were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the
U.S. Surgeon General’s Smoking Report. PD preva-
lence was estimated based on population aging with
and without an account of the impact of declining
smoking rates. Relative risks of 0.56 and 0.78 were
applied for current and former smokers, respectively.
Results: Accounting for aging alone, ~700,000 PD
cases are predicted by 2040. After accounting for the
declining smoking prevalence, ~770,000 cases, an
increase of ~10% over the estimate without smoking,
is predicted.
Conclusions:
If
the
epidemiological
association
of
smoking and PD is causal, projecting future cases
without considering smoking may underestimate dis-
ease burden, underscoring the urgency of adequate
resource allocation. V

Public health initiatives targeting tobacco use have
impacted health behaviors and average life expectancy
in the United States.1,2 The U.S. Surgeon General and
the Department of Health and Human Services predict
decreases in the prevalence of smoking in coming dec-
ades, whereas U.S. Census Bureau projections suggest
substantial growth in the U.S. population �50 years
old.3,4 Both trends reflect improved population health,
but may lead to an increase in the prevalence of
Parkinson’s disease (PD), whose risk is known to
increase with age.5 In addition, smoking is associated
robustly with lower PD risk, although a mechanism
for causality is not known.5-9
Dorsey and colleagues10 estimated the prevalence of
PD in the year 2005 in 15 countries (including the
United States) according to age group. The study pro-
jected PD prevalence for the year 2030 and has
become a landmark for estimates of future economic
and social burdens of PD. However, it projected PD
prevalence based only on the aging of the population,
not taking into account the trend toward the decline
of smoking that suggests that the decline of smoking
will contribute to a higher PD incidence in the years
to come. Thus we have included the predicted smok-
ing trend in reexamining the previous projection of
PD prevalence to provide a more accurate estimate of
the future prevalence.
Methods
Data on both historical and projected U.S. popula-
tions by gender from the years 1990 to 2040 were
obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.3 The data were
tabulated based on age- and gender-specific cohorts of
ages 50-64, 65-74, and 751 for each calendar year.
Data regarding historical and future estimates of
smoking prevalence from 1990 to the year 2040 were
obtained
from
the
Surgeon
General’s
Report
on
smoking,11 specifically projections by Holford and
colleagues.12 The prevalence rates for current, former,
and nonsmokers were derived for age- and gender-

 specific cohorts of ages 50-64, 65-74, and 751 for
each calendar year.
In PD, dopamine cell loss may start 5 to 13 years or
more before clinical diagnosis.13,14 Thus we imple-
mented a 10-year lag of smoking behavior to predict
PD prevalence in a given year to account for the tem-
poral effect of smoking on PD incidence.
A large meta-analysis including 44 case-control stud-
ies and 4 cohort studies determined a pooled relative
risk of PD of 0.59 for former smokers and a relative
risk of 0.39 for current smokers.9 The largest study in
the United States with detailed smoking data deter-
mined odds ratios of 0.56 for current and 0.78 for for-
mer smokers.15 Because the incidence of PD is so low
in the general population, the odds ratio can reason-
ably be interpreted as relative risk.16 The model incor-
porates odds ratios for PD of 0.78 for former smokers
and 0.56 for current smokers; this represents the more
conservative U.S. estimates.15,17
We applied the population data to PD prevalence
models, where P is prevalence and Pop is population.
First, we used the same prevalence estimates from
Dorsey and colleagues10 for each age cohort (P50-64,
P65-74, P751) to calculate the PD prevalence in each
year until the year 2040 (equation 1). This model does
not account for smoking.

Then we projected PD prevalence until the year 2040
by accounting for smoking prevalence. The overall
prevalence of PD for a given year resulted from a sum-
mation of the output of the following model for each

Results
From year 2000 to 2040, the U.S. population �50
years of age will increase by 46.2% while the percentage
of smokers �50 years of age will decrease by 59.8%
(Fig. 1). The absolute number of former smokers in the
United States will plateau, although the percentage of
the population comprised by this group will decrease.
By the year 2040, active smokers are expected to be
only 3.5% of the U.S. population �50 years of age,
whereas former smokers are predicted to be 26.4%.
The number of people in the United States with PD
in the year 2040 is projected (equation 1) to be
approximately 700,000 individuals due to aging alone
(Fig. 2). This number, however, will increase to
approximately 770,000 (10% higher) if smoking truly
decreases
PD
risk
and
the
current
trend
toward
decreased smoking continues (equation 2). This repre-
sents an approximately 56% increase in the PD popu-
lation between 2005 and 2040. Our model also
demonstrates an overall disease prevalence rate of
0.535% of the entire U.S. population in 2040 com-
pared with a prevalence rate of 0.401% in the year
2005. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the burden of PD
in the United States will grow substantially as the
prevalence of smoking continues to decrease. The
divergence between PD prevalence projections (Fig. 2)
occurs because the prevalence of smoking in the
United States is expected to continue to decrease.10 Of
note, the U.S. Surgeon General’s projected changes in
smoking habits within the U.S. population and popu-
lation growth are nonlinear, resulting in the nonmono-
phasic increase in cases of PD and the initial crossover
of the models shown in Figure 2. Although the

ers (FS), and never smokers (NS) between the years 2000 and 2040.

 proportion of smokers in the overall population is
expected to decrease over time, certain age cohorts are
projected to experience increases in the number of
smokers at various time points rather than a continual
decrease. The divergence of the PD prevalence projec-
tions occurs farther in the future when the number of
smokers across all cohorts is decreased in contrast to
decreases only in certain age cohorts earlier in time.12
Discussion
Chronic diseases constitute a major health care bur-
den
in
the
United
States.18
Estimates
of
annual
disease-related medical costs per PD patient range
from $10,378 to $14,400 (in 2010 U.S. dollars), not
including indirect costs.19-22 Our study suggests that
previous projections may have underestimated PD
prevalence by 10% in the coming decade by not
accounting for the impact of decreasing rates of smok-
ing. Even by our conservative estimates, these 70,000
additional PD cases would add an annual cost of
greater than $700 million for the United States.
Estimates of PD prevalence vary widely, although
there is a lack of current large studies for the United
States.23 A commonly cited estimate of U.S. prevalence
of PD based on a single door-to-door survey was
extrapolated
to
an
estimated
PD
prevalence
of
430,000 in 2010 for the population aged older than
40.24 Recently, Strickland and Bertoni25 used a PD
registry combined with capture–recapture methodol-
ogy in Nebraska in 2000 and estimated a 2010 PD
prevalence estimate for people aged 40 or older of
nearly 920,000 individuals in the United States, some-
what greater than Kowal and colleagues19 whose esti-
mate was 630,000 people. Other studies also have
focused on estimated incidence of PD.26-30 The most
conservative estimates have generally used door-to-
door surveys or autopsy data, whereas studies that
focus on claims data yielded higher estimates.30
In the current study, we selected the conservative,
well-accepted, and widely cited estimate of PD preva-
lence from Dorsey and colleagues10 as our base model.
They used International Data Base’s population pyra-
mids in combination with door-to-door studies with
age-specific prevalence to create a model that esti-
mated 373,968 individuals in 2010.10 Our model also
used conservative modifiers for the effect of former
and current smoking on the risk of developing PD.
Other studies report risk reductions as profound as
74% in current smokers.31 Therefore, it stands to rea-
son that our estimate of disease prevalence for the
year 2040 is also conservative and in reality the num-
ber may be much greater.
The results indicate that if tobacco nonuse is indeed
causally related to an increased risk of PD, past projec-
tions may underestimate the prevalence of PD in 2040 by
at least 10%. The PD prevalence that our model projects
would vary based on the source data for current PD prev-
alence, but we emphasize that accounting for declining
rates of smoking, regardless of baseline disease preva-
lence, is necessary for a more accurate depiction of future
PD burden. This also holds true for the degree of risk
modification due to smoking that is used in the model,
which also varies in the literature.9,15
A recent study by Savica and colleagues32 demon-
strated that the incidence of PD might have increased
during the 30-year time period from 1976 to 2005.
Although intriguing, this finding needs confirmation,
as one may speculate that it may be due, at least to
some extent, to the decreasing trend of smoking in the
past 50 years in the United States.32 Therefore, our
model incorporating the diminishing trend in smoking
may offer a more accurate projection of future PD
prevalence if smoking is indeed causally linked to PD
risk. Smoking prevalence is projected to continue to
decline with ongoing nationwide smoking cessation
health initiatives.12 The Centers for Disease Control
has set a goal of decreasing smoking prevalence to
12% of the population by the year of 2020.33 Until
smoking prevalence reaches its nadir, it is reasonable
to expect continual increases in yearly PD incidence
with a plateau beginning in 2030 and with subsequent
effects on disease prevalence.
Our model relies on the hypothesis that smoking is
neuroprotective
for
PD,
thus
PD
prevalence
will
decrease as smoking decreases in the United States. It
has been proposed, however, that this effect is the
result of decreased responsiveness to nicotine in the
PD prodromal period, thereby leading to decreased
rates of smoking in individuals later diagnosed with
PD.34 Although this latter idea is not widely accepted,
if true it would nullify the current calculations. This
limitation is important, as causality has not been
proven. We also used a 10-year lag in estimating the
influence of smoking on PD risk, but we recognize
that this is somewhat arbitrary and also limits the
accuracy of our projections. Finally, projection accu-
racy is predicated on the estimates of future numbers
of smokers, former smokers, and nonsmokers; this is
dependent on the continued success of public health
measures related to smoking cessation.
Above and beyond medical costs, as a chronic con-
dition, PD imposes a significant burden on families
and caregivers that is not easily quantified. This will
continue to grow as the size of the elderly population
in the United States continues to increase. Our study
suggests additional resources are likely to be needed
above those currently estimated.
