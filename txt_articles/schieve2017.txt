Previous studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and birth spacing had limitations; few examined phenotypic case
subtypes or explored underlying mechanisms for associations and none assessed whether other (non-ASD) develop-
mental disabilities (DDs) were associated with birth spacing. We assessed associations between inter-pregnancy inter-
val (IPI) and both ASD and other DDs using data from the Study to Explore Early Development, a multi-site case-
control study with rigorous case-finding and case-classification methods and detailed data collection on maternal
reproductive history. Our sample included 356 ASD cases, 627 DD cases, and 524 population (POP) controls born in
second or later births. ASD and DD cases were further sub-divided according to whether the child had intellectual dis-
ability (ID). ASD cases were also sub-divided by ASD symptom severity, and DD cases were subdivided by presence of
some ASD symptoms (indicated on an autism screener). Odds ratios, adjusted for maternal-child sociodemographic
factors, (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were derived from logistic regression models. Among term births, ASD
was associated with both IPI <18 months (aOR 1.5 [1.1–2.2]) and �60 months (1.5 [0.99–2.4]). Both short and long
IPI associations were stronger among ASD cases with high severity scores (aORs 2.0 [1.3–3.3] and 1.8 [0.99–3.2],
respectively). Associations were unchanged after adding several factors potentially related to the causal pathway to
regression models. DD was not associated with either short or long IPI—overall, among term births, or in any sub-
group examined. These findings extend those from previous studies and further inform recommendations on optimal
pregnancy spacing. Autism Res 2018, 11: 81–94. V

Lay Summary: We investigated whether the amount of time between pregnancies was associated autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) or other developmental disabilities (DD) in children. ASD was increased in second and later-born chil-
dren who were conceived less than 18 months or 60 or more months after the mother’s previous birth. Other DDs
were not associated with birth spacing.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is estimated to occur
in 1–2% of U.S. children [Christensen et al., 2016;
Blumberg et al., 2013]. While genetic factors are impli-
cated in the etiology of ASD [Miles, 2011], the compos-
ite evidence supports gene–environment interactions
[Kim & Leventhal, 2015]. ASD risk factors identified
from
epidemiologic
studies
include
maternal-fetal
health conditions, such as diabetes, preeclampsia, infec-
tion, and preterm birth, and maternal exposures such
as medication use, environmental pollutants, and folic
acid deficiency before and during pregnancy [Ornoy,
Weinstein-Fudim, & Ergaz, 2016]. Neurobiological stud-
ies also suggest that embryogenesis is a critical period
for ASD exposures [Arndt, Stodgell, & Rodier, 2005].
Thus, investigation of factors related to early pregnancy
might provide clues about the causes of ASD. Short
birth spacing or inter-pregnancy-interval (IPI), an estab-
lished risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes includ-
ing
preterm
delivery,
intrauterine-growth-restriction,
and neonatal intensive care admission [Conde-Agudelo,
Rosas-Berm�
udez, & Kafury-Goeta, 2006; Conde-Agudelo,
Rosas-Berm�
udez, Casta~
no, & Norton, 2012; Appareddy,
Pryor, & Bailey, 2016], is thus also of concern for poten-
tial longer-term child health effects, such as ASD.

 Several studies report associations between ASD and
short IPI [Cheslack-Postava, Liu, & Bearman, 2011;
Dodds et al., 2011; Gunnes et al., 2013; Cheslack-
Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015; Durkin, DuBois, &
Maenner, 2015; Zerbo, Yoshida, Gunderson, Dorward,
& Croen, 2015]. Some also report associations with
long IPI [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015;
Durkin et al., 2015; Zerbo et al., 2015]. However, short
IPI was variously defined as <9 to <24 months and sev-
eral studies did not separate births after long IPI from
the referent category. Few studies present data on IPI as
a continuous variable to further inform the binary or
ordinal IPI categories presented and only one study
assessed a continuous IPI variable in a model that
allowed for non-linear prediction effects [Gunnes et al.,
2013]. However, that study was nonetheless limited in
that estimates from the continuous IPI assessment were
imprecise, especially for long IPIs.
Because previous studies were based on data from
existing medical or administrative records, they were
further limited in the data available for both pregnancy
history and child developmental outcomes. In most
studies, cases were limited to those who had accessed
services and received an ASD diagnosis; in several stud-
ies,
ASD
case
definitions
were
based
on
non-
standardized administrative diagnostic coding, with the
possibility of varying diagnostic rigor and possible mis-
classification and selective ascertainment of the most
severe cases. Data on maternal reproductive history
from existing data sources is also often incomplete. For
instance,
many
population-based
registries
do
not
include fetal losses at all or do not include timing of
fetal losses; thus, IPI was necessarily defined based only
on
previous
livebirths.
However,
evidence
supports
treating stillbirths similar to livebirths in IPI calcula-
tions; short IPI after stillbirth has been linked to
increased risks for preeclampsia, intrauterine-growth-
restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal and neona-
tal death [Bigelow & Bryant, 2015]. Previous studies
were also limited in their ability to assess potential bio-
logic mechanisms and phenotypic case subtypes. More-
over, the few studies that included assessments of DSM-
IV ASD subtypes report inconsistent findings. Gunnes
et al. [2013] reported that short IPI was associated with
autistic disorder but not other disorders (Asperger’s Dis-
order and pervasive developmental disorder–not other-
wise
specified
[PDD-NOS]
combined);
Zerbo
et
al.
[2015] reported that both short and long IPI were asso-
ciated with ASD regardless of subtype; and Cheslack-
Postava et al. [2014] reported that short IPI was associ-
ated
with
autistic
disorder
and
PDD-NOS
but
not
Asperger’s disorder and long IPI was associated only
with Asperger’s disorder. Nonetheless, Cheslack-Postava
et al. [2014] also reported that IPI associations were
similar for ASD cases with and without co-occurring
intellectual disability (ID).
A few studies have reported associations between
short IPI and developmental delay [reviewed in Conde-
Agudelo, Rosas-Bermudez, & Norton, 2016]; however,
various methodological limitations hamper interpreta-
tion of the findings. To our knowledge, no study has
examined associations between IPI and ASD and non-
ASD developmental disabilities (DDs) in the same study
population. Thus, it has not been possible to assess
whether associations reported between IPI and ASD
might
reflect
a
more
general
neurodevelopmental
effect.
The Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a
large multi-site case-control study specifically designed
to assess pre-conception and prenatal ASD risk factors,
has several advantages over prior studies. Case finding
included identification of young children with a range
of developmental delays from numerous sources serving
diverse population subgroups, thus casting a “wide net”
to identify possible ASD cases (including yet undiag-
nosed cases) and a second non-ASD DD case group.
Final case classification was based on in-depth standard-
ized in-person developmental assessments administered
by research-reliable clinical study staff, rather than
reports of past diagnoses. Developmental assessment
data also allowed us to systematically define various
case subtypes. Exposure ascertainment was based on
detailed maternal reproductive histories taken as part of
a
comprehensive
maternal
interview,
which
also
included data on conditions possibly in the causal path-
way of an IPI–ASD association.
Using SEED data, we conducted a comprehensive
analysis of the association between IPI and ASD. We
examined both short and long IPI, including assess-
ments of an ordinal IPI variable that aligns with clinical
guidelines and a continuous IPI variable evaluated
using cubic spline analyses. We examined associations
with non-ASD DDs in addition to ASD and also exam-
ined associations for several ASD and DD phenotypic
subtypes. Finally, we assessed several factors possibly
related to the underlying causal pathway.
Methods
SEED Methodology
SEED was implemented in 2007 in six sites located in
California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, North Caro-
lina, and Pennsylvania. Institutional review boards at
CDC and each site approved the SEED protocol.
Details of the SEED methodology were previously
published [Schendel et al., 2012]. Each site followed a
common protocol, including enrollment of three study
groups: children with ASD, children with other (non-
82
Schieve et al./Autism and birth spacing
INSAR
 ASD) DDs, and children from the general population
(POP). Children for the ASD and DD groups were iden-
tified
from
multiple
special
education
and
clinical
sources that provide services to children with disabil-
ities. Children recruited from each source were those
with select special education or International Classifi-
cation of Disease codes indicative of autism/ASD or
other DDs often seen as precursor or co-occurring
diagnoses in children eventually diagnosed with ASD.
POP children were selected from random samples of
the birth certificates within a given site’s defined study
area.
Eligible children for the first phase of SEED were born
between 2003 and 2006, lived in the respective site’s
study area both at birth and at study enrollment, and
lived with a caregiver since 6 months of age who could
provide legal consent and was capable of communicat-
ing in English (all sites) or Spanish (two sites). For 98%
of children, the caregiver was the biological mother.
Children were enrolled at 2–5 years of age.
Although children were initially identified as poten-
tially being eligible for a given group—ASD, DD, or
POP—final study group classification was determined
from standardized research developmental assessments
[Wiggins et al., 2015]. Upon enrollment, all children
were
screened
for
possible
autism
characteristics
through their caregivers’ completion of the Social Com-
munication Questionnaire (SCQ). Children with SCQ
scores at or above the predetermined threshold of 11
were designated as potential ASD cases regardless of
how they were initially identified. Additionally, all chil-
dren who had a previous ASD diagnosis or autism spe-
cial
education
classification
were
designated
as
potential ASD cases regardless of their SCQ scores. Chil-
dren in all study groups were seen in person and
administered a general developmental assessment, the
Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Children in the
potential ASD group were additionally administered the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and
their caregivers were administered the Autism Diagnos-
tic Interview - Revised (ADI-R). Final ASD case classifica-
tion was based on ADOS and ADI-R scores. Children
who had been designated as potential ASD cases, who
did not meet the criteria for classification as an ASD
case after the ADOS and ADI-R, received a final classifi-
cation of either DD or POP depending on their original
identification source (education/clinical source vs. birth
certificate sample, respectively).
A
wealth of
data
were
collected
from
all study
groups, including an extensive interview with the care-
giver about family socio-demographics and, if the care-
giver
was
the
biological
mother,
her
reproductive
history and information about her pregnancy with the
child.
Sample Selection
Altogether, 3,200 children enrolled in SEED and com-
pleted sufficient assessments to receive a final classifica-
tion of ASD, DD, or POP. Of these, 2,728 children had
data on maternal pregnancy history; 2,725 also had
data on potential confounders of interest. The sample
for the current analysis was necessarily limited to sec-
ond or later births (n 5 1,507).
Birth Spacing
During the computer-assisted-telephone-interview, the
biological mother was asked how many times she had
been pregnant, and for each pregnancy, she was asked
the outcome and date (exact date or month and year of
outcome, year of outcome, or her age at outcome if she
could not recall the date). Birth spacing or IPI was cal-
culated as time in months from most recent date of
birth (stillbirth or livebirth) preceding the index preg-
nancy to estimated date of conception of index preg-
nancy. Date of conception was calculated as date of
index birth minus gestational age, obtained from birth
certificate files. Our choice to calculate IPI as interval
from most recent stillbirth or livebirth, but not most
recent miscarriage, was based on previous studies that
document adverse perinatal and infant consequences
for pregnancies conceived within a short interval of a
stillbirth, but few risks for pregnancies conceived within
a short interval of a previous miscarriage [Bigelow &
Bryant, 2015].
Statistical Analysis
We examined distributions of maternal reproductive
history variables and potential confounders—maternal
age and education at birth, maternal race-ethnicity, ges-
tational
age,
and
child
sex—by
case-control
study
group. Potential confounders were factors previously
found
to
be
associated
with
ASD
and
IPI
[Bilder,
Pinborough-Zimmerman, Miller, & McMahon, 2009;
Schieve, Clayton, Durkin, Wingate, & Drews-Botsch,
2015; Thoma, Copen, & Kirmeyer, 2016; Appareddy
et al., 2016]. We tested the significance of differences
between ASD and POP groups and DD and POP groups
with chi-square tests.
We assessed associations between ASD and DD and
IPI in several sets of analyses.
Assessment of ordinal IPI variable. We initially
computed unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) for associations between both ASD
and DD (each compared to POPs) and IPI (<18 months
or �60 months vs. 18–59 months). The IPI cut points
were chosen based on review of previous IPI-ASD stud-
ies [Dodds et al., 2011; Gunnes et al., 2013; Cheslack-
Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015; Durkin et al.,
2015;
Zerbo
et
al.,
2015],
published
clinical

 recommendations [Bigelow & Bryant, 2015], and sam-
ple sizes of our study groups—overall and within sub-
groups of interest. We also subdivided the lowest IPI
category as <12 months and 12 to <18 months and
examined
findings
separately
for
these
groups;
as
expected estimates were less precise for these smaller
categories.
We conducted stratified analyses examining each
potential
confounder
individually;
the
findings
informed our final multivariable adjustment models.
Because we observed notable differences in IPI associa-
tions
within
gestational
age
strata,
we
conducted
adjusted analyses for the total sample and for the sam-
ple restricted to term births. Adjusted ORs (aORs) were
derived from ordinary logistic regression models that
included IPI, child sex, maternal race/ethnicity, mater-
nal education at birth, and maternal age at birth as
independent variables. While we also examined house-
hold income as a potential confounding factor, we did
not include income in our final models to avoid reduc-
ing our sample size; 3–5% of mothers did not respond
to the income question on the maternal interview. The
aOR estimates derived from models with and without
income were very similar; we thus present only the lat-
ter here.
We also assessed several factors possibly related to the
underlying causal path between IPI and adverse neuro-
development (i.e., potential mediator variables): (1)
pregnancy planning; (2) maternal infertility disorder
diagnoses; and (3) maternal hypertension or diabetes
during pregnancy. We re-ran our logistic regression
models among term births with each of these factors
added. Data on pregnancy planning and infertility dis-
orders were collected as part of the maternal telephone
interview. The interview included a question on general
pregnancy planning—whether before her pregnancy
with the index child the mother was trying to get preg-
nant. Infertility was ascertained from a series of ques-
tions on whether before the index pregnancy a doctor
or other healthcare provider ever told the mother it
would be impossible or difficult to get pregnant—over-
all and because of specific infertility-related disorders,
including blocked or damaged fallopian tubes; PCOS or
multiple
ovarian
cysts;
diminished
ovarian
reserve
because of advanced age, premature ovarian failure or a
medical
condition;
endometriosis;
uterine
problem,
such as fibroids; or a diagnosis of unexplained infertil-
ity. Women could respond affirmatively to more than
one disorder. For this analysis, we created a single, “any
maternal infertility disorder” variable. Multiple SEED
instruments included information on hypertension and
diabetes
during pregnancy: the maternal
telephone
interview; prenatal care record abstractions (available
for �70% of study participants); and a self-administered
maternal medical history checklist form. A previous
SEED analysis reported high agreement for medical
record and self-reported data for both hypertension and
diabetes (currently unpublished data). Therefore, we
classified the mother as having each condition if it was
reported in any of the three study instruments.
Assessment
of
ASD
and
DD
subgroups.
We
assessed both ASD and DD within subgroups defined
according to whether or not the child scored in the
intellectual disability (ID) range (<70) on the MSEL,
which was administered to all children during the in-
person
developmental
assessment.
We
additionally
examined ASD subgroups defined according to the
severity of ASD symptoms. A calibrated ADOS severity
score was calculated for all ASD cases based on the
ADOS total score, ADOS language level, and child age
at developmental assessment. The ten-point scale was
dichotomized into ‘less severe’ (scores of 4–7) and
‘more severe’ (scores of 8–10). We also subdivided the
DD group by whether the child had an indication of
some autism symptoms, even though s/he had not met
the ADOS and ADI-R criteria for classification as an ASD
case.
Autism
symptoms
were
defined
as
SCQ
score5>11. Separate regression models were run for
each phenotypic subgroup. In each of these models, we
compared IPI among children in a given subgroup (ASD
with ID, ASD without ID, DD with ID, DD without ID,
ASD with more severe symptoms, ASD with less severe
symptoms, DD with autism symptoms, DD without
autism symptoms) to the total POP group.
Assessment of continuous IPI variable. IPI was
also analyzed as a continuous variable using logistic
regression with restricted cubic splines to allow for non-
linear (log scale) risk relationships between IPI length
and outcome odds. We specified 3 knots at 12, 18, and
59 months, and specified 36-month IPI as the reference
value. The covariates included in the multivariable
logistic regression with restricted cubic splines were the
same as those included in the multivariable categorical
approach. The models with restricted cubic splines were
compared to the models without splines using Likeli-
hood ratio tests for testing non-linearity.
Results
In our sample, children with ASD and DD were more
likely than children in the POP group to be male and
to have been delivered preterm (Table 1). Their mothers
were less likely than POP mothers to be Non-Hispanic
white or to have completed college at the time of their
births and were more likely to have had hypertension
during pregnancy. Mothers of ASD children were also
more likely than mothers of POP children to have had
an infertility disorder diagnosis and were less likely to
report trying to get pregnant. DD mothers were more
84
Schieve et al./Autism and birth spacing
INSAR
 likely than POP mothers to have had diabetes during
pregnancy. Over two-thirds of ASD children and about
one-fourth of DD children had ID. Close to 40% of ASD
children had a high ASD symptom severity score and
nearly 30% of DD children were classified as having
some autism symptoms.
The ASD group had higher frequencies of both short
and long IPI than the POP group (Fig. 1) and the differ-
ence between the ASD and POP distributions was statis-
tically significant (P 5 0.005). The distribution of IPI in
the DD group was not significantly different from the
POP group distribution.

 Both before and after adjustment, we observed posi-
tive associations between ASD and both short (<18
months) and long (�60 months) IPI. Associations were
more pronounced among term births (aORs 1.5 [95%
CI: 1.1–2.2] and 1.5 [95% CI: 0.99–2.4] for short and
long IPI, respectively) (Table 2). We could not assess
adjusted associations between ASD and IPI among pre-
term births due to small sample sizes and instability of
the regression model; however, unadjusted stratified
analyses
were
suggestive
of
an
effect
modification
between IPI and gestational age (P 5 0.075 with positive
associations between ASD and both short and long IPI
among term, but not preterm births) (data not shown).
Analyses of finer gradations of short IPI revealed that
the magnitude of effects for associations between ASD
and IPIs of <12 months and 12–18 months were simi-
lar. Addition of various mediator factors to regression
models had minimal impact on effect estimates for
either short or long IPI.
Associations were similar for ASD with and without
ID (Table 3). Associations for “more severe ASD” were
stronger than those observed for ASD overall. Con-
versely, associations between “less severe ASD” and
either short or long IPI were attenuated and no longer
statistically significant.
DD was not significantly associated with either short
or long IPI in the total sample or among term births
(Table 4). Although sample sizes were small and esti-
mates were imprecise, there was also no association evi-
dent among preterm births (data not shown). Addition
of mediator factors to regression models did not impact
the findings. Additionally, there was no association
between IPI and any of the DD case subgroups exam-
ined (Table 5).
The U-shaped association between ASD and IPI is
more fully illustrated in the findings from the cubic
spline analyses (Fig. 2). Likelihood ratio tests indicated
that a restricted cubic spline model fit the data signifi-
cantly better than the model without the spline for the
total sample (P 5 0.044, Fig. 2A), term birth sample
(P 5 0.005,
Fig.
2B)
and
term
birth
sample
with
assessment of more severe ASD only (P 5 0.011 Fig. 2C).
The findings from the cubic spline model also suggest
that the magnitude of the association between ASD and
long IPI increases gradually after 59 months. Cubic
spline models for the DD group did not fit the data bet-
ter than models without cubic splines (P 5 0.777 for
total sample and P 5 0.888 for term birth sample). The
plots, which showed flat straight lines, indicated no
association between DD and any level of IPI (Fig. 3).
Discussion
We found that in children born in 2nd or later term
births, ASD was associated with pregnancy conception
either <18 months or �60 months after the mother’s
preceding birth. Our cubic spline analyses confirmed
this pattern of results and also suggested associations
become stronger with IPI’s beyond 60 months. We did
not observe an association between ASD and IPI among
preterm births, a finding we could not explore fully due
to sample size constraints. However, one possible rea-
son for this finding is that preterm birth posed a com-
peting risk that masked associations with IPI.
While we observed similar findings for children with
ASD plus ID and ASD without ID, we found that associ-
ations with both short and long IPI were primarily lim-
ited
to
ASD cases
with
a
higher
calibrated ADOS
severity
score,
a
measure
of
core
ASD
symptoms
designed to limit influences from child demographics
or non-ASD developmental outcomes, including ID
[Wiggins et al., 2017]. Moreover, we found that non-
ASD DD was not associated with either short or long IPI
- overall, in term or preterm births, among subgroups
with or without ID, or among subgroups with or with-
out ASD symptoms reported. Altogether, these findings
support the hypothesis that the ASD–IPI associations
are unique to ASD rather than being reflective of a
more general neurodevelopmental effect.
Our findings are consistent with several previous
studies showing associations between ASD and short IPI
[Cheslack-Postava et al., 2011; Dodds et al., 2011;
Gunnes et al., 2013; Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Coo
et al., 2015; Durkin et al., 2015; Zerbo et al., 2015] and
the few studies that additionally demonstrated a U-
shaped relationship between ASD and IPI [Cheslack-
Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015; Durkin et al.,
2015; Zerbo et al., 2015]. The findings from the few pre-
vious studies that assessed ASD diagnostic subtypes
[Gunnes et al., 2013; Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014;
Zerbo et al., 2015] and ASD with and without ID [Che-
slack-Postava et al., 2014] were inconsistent. In the cur-
rent
study,
we
were
able
to
examine
phenotypic
subtypes more fully. The developmental assessment
data we collected allowed us to subdivide ASD cases

 based on the child’s core ASD symptoms, rather than
relying on a previous subtype diagnosis. As noted, this
particular subdivision was more informative than that
based on cognitive functioning.
There has been little study of other DDs and IPI over-
all and the few previous studies available must be con-
sidered cautiously, given methodological limitations.
Thompson et al. [2003] examined a general develop-
mental delay outcome, defined based on education eli-
gibility data that encompassed a broad array of delay
types and also included children deemed at risk for
delay. They reported modest associations (most effect
estimates <1.3) with low and high IPI. De Moura et al.
[2010] reported an association between IPI <24 months
and suspected developmental delay at two years in a
study of an urban Brazilian population; however, the
outcome was defined based on Battelle Screening Devel-
opmental Inventory which has not been validated in a
Brazilian population and given the young age of the
cohort,
might
have
selectively
identified
the
most
severe cases of DD. Pinto-Martin, Cnaan, & Zhao,
[1998] reported an association between very short IPI
(<6 months) and disabling cerebral palsy. Of note,
none of the aforementioned studies defined cases of
disability in a way that specifically excluded ASD; thus,
it is not possible to determine if associations observed
were related to ASD, which often co-occurs with other
disabilities [Boulet, Boyle, & Schieve, 2009].
To our knowledge, no previous study of IPI has exam-
ined ASD and non-ASD DD associations in the same
study population. SEED provided an opportunity to
compare ASD and non-ASD DDs in a systematic manner
with an in-depth case classification. While our DD
group was a heterogeneous mix of disabilities with a
range of severity levels, the SEED protocol included
screening of all children enrolled in the study for
autism symptoms with the SCQ and follow-up of those
who screened positive, such that even children without
a previous ASD diagnosis, were classified as an ASD case
if they met study criteria on the ADOS and ADI-R.
Thus, our DD group is unique in that we intentionally
excluded children meeting ASD criteria from it; more-
over,
data
from
various
developmental
assessments
allowed us to sub-divide the DD group based on both
ID and autism symptomatology.
Possible hypotheses that have been put
forth to
explain associations between ASD and short IPI include
nutrition depletion from the previous pregnancy, partic-
ularly folic acid depletion, which plays a key role in neu-
ronal
development
and
DNA
methylation
and
is
vulnerable to depletion by the end of a pregnancy [Sha-
char & Lyell, 2012; Conde-Agudelo et al., 2012], linger-
ing maternal inflammation from the previous pregnancy

 be more common in pregnancies after short IPI [Shachar
& Lyell, 2012; Conde-Agudelo et al., 2016], an increased
risk for maternal complications during pregnancies con-
ceived after a short IPI [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014],
and unintended pregnancy and the consequent delays
in various health behavior changes due to later recogni-
tion of pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation, changes in
medication use, initiation of folic acid supplementation)
[Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014]. The trend toward delayed
childbearing among U.S. women (i.e., first birth at age
35 or older) has also been associated with shorter IPI
[Nabukera et al., 2009]; this phenomenon might repre-
sent an intentional desire for short pregnancy spacing
and it might also occur among women who have diffi-
culty conceiving their first birth due to an infertility dis-
order. The association between ASD and long IPI has
been hypothesized to reflect an association between ASD
and
underlying
sub-fertility
[Conde-Agudelo
et
al.,
2016]; additionally some of the adverse impact associ-
ated with long IPI might be due to unintended preg-
nancy [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014].
Previous studies of ASD and IPI were limited in their
examination of potential causal pathways. Only a few
studies included some analyses of potential intermedi-
ary variables beyond preterm delivery, and those studies
were themselves limited. Dodd et al. [2011] included
adjustment of a binary maternal condition variable in
their analyses that was broadly defined to include pul-
monary disease, heart disease, renal disease, or anemia.
Durkin et al. [2015] included adjustment for gestational
diabetes, but their data were from birth certificates, a
source with only moderate sensitivity for diabetes [Dev-
lin, Desai, & Walaszek, 2009]. Zerbo et al. [2015]
adjusted for maternal use of antidepressants and mater-
nal body mass index. We had data linked to several
potential causal pathways—pregnancy planning, infer-
tility, and maternal pregnancy complications. More-
over, our data on pregnancy complications were more
comprehensive than past studies and our data collec-
tion protocol, which included abstraction of prenatal
care records for a subset of our sample, allowed us to
validate maternal self-report data. Our findings from
analyses
that
included
potential
mediator
variables
indicate that the associations we observed between ASD
and both short and long IPI were not explained by
unplanned pregnancy, maternal infertility disorders, or
two common maternal antenatal complications, hyper-
tension and diabetes.
Nonetheless, we lacked data to examine several other
factors possibly related to the causal pathway, such as
folic acid supplementation, folic acid levels early in
pregnancy, and inflammatory markers in pregnancy.

these two areas might be particularly important to
examine in future studies. It is possible that certain
pregnancies associated with ASD risk specifically are
particularly vulnerable to the impacts of short preg-
nancy
spacing
on
maternal
nutritional
stores
and
inflammation.
Limitations
This study must be interpreted in the context of limita-
tions. Because SEED sought to include mother–child
pairs from diverse population subgroups, children were
recruited from multiple clinical and education sources
and population-based controls were sampled from birth
certificates. One drawback to this approach is that a
number
of
families
initially
targeted
for
potential
recruitment could not be located. It is possible many of
these families were ineligible for inclusion since our a
priori eligibility criteria required both current and birth
residence in the study catchment area. Still, we cannot
rule out some selection bias in our sample. However,

 we conducted a detailed analysis of characteristics of
responders and non-responders in the one site with
data on all non-responders and found that while cer-
tain demographic factors were associated with nonre-
sponse—younger
maternal
age
and
lower
maternal
education—other
perinatal
factors,
including
birth
order, were not (unpublished data). We adjusted analy-
ses for maternal age and education and we initially
assessed all associations within demographic strata.
Additionally, we note that the proportions of short and
long IPI among mother–child pairs in the SEED POP
group are in line with expectations for US births with
similar race-ethnicity and maternal education distribu-
tions [Gemmill & Lindberg, 2013; Copen, Thoma, &
Kirmeyer, 2015].
Because we did not exclude children from the general
population control group if they had evidence of dis-
abilities, with the exception of those who met our ASD
case
definition,
our
associations
could
have
been
slightly attenuated, particularly for ASD and DD sub-
groups defined based on ID. However, we conducted
sensitivity analyses in which we repeated ID subgroup
analyses after excluding from the POP group children
who had evidence of ID (2.8%) and the findings were
very similar to those presented here (data not shown).
Strengths
Despite limitations, this study has a number of impor-
tant
strengths
including
more
rigorous
case-
classification than previous studies, which relied on
existing medical and administrative records. Indeed, a
prior SEED analysis suggests that reliance on existing
clinical diagnoses data for ASD case classification in
young children is subject to misclassification as a result
of both under- and over-ascertainment; 17% of children
enrolled in SEED who had a previous clinical ASD diag-
nosis did not meet SEED ASD-case criteria based on the
ADOS and ADI-R and 15% of children who met SEED
ASD-case criteria did not have a previous diagnosis
reported [Wiggins et al., 2015]. Also, as discussed, the
inclusion of a separate DD group and the wealth of
developmental data collected using research reliable
methods allowed us to examine associations with ASD
alongside associations with non-ASD DDs and to subdi-
vide both case groups into more homogenous sub-
groups. The in-depth SEED data collection protocol,
which encompassed maternal reproductive history and
pregnancy complications, allowed us to assess several
important potential mediator factors that other studies
could not and allowed us to define IPI more appropri-
ately than past studies by including time since last still-
birth. We note however, that this was not a driving
factor for the associations observed in this study; we
conducted a sensitivity analysis in which mother–child
pairs with a previous stillbirth were excluded from our
sample and observed comparable ASD–IPI associations
as reported here (data not shown).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest ASD is increased in children born
in second or later births after a short or long IPI. Addi-
tionally, the disparate findings between the ASD and
DD groups and between ASD subgroups with high
severity score versus lower severity score suggest that
the underlying mechanism for the associations between
ASD and birth spacing might be unique to autism
rather than reflecting neurodevelopment effects more
generally. Despite unanswered questions, these findings
in concert with those from other studies can inform
public health and clinical guidelines about optimal
pregnancy spacing. Since pregnancy spacing is poten-
tially modifiable, it is particularly important to more
fully understand the underlying explanation for the
ASD–IPI associations such that women can be fully
informed of the potential risks associated with short
and long IPIs.
