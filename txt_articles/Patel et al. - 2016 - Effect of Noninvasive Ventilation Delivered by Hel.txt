vs Face Mask on the Rate of Endotracheal Intubation
in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
A Randomized Clinical Trial

IMPORTANCE Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with a face mask is relatively ineffective at
preventing endotracheal intubation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Delivery of NIV with a helmet may be a superior strategy for these patients.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether NIV delivered by helmet improves intubation rate among
patients with ARDS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center randomized clinical trial of 83 patients
with ARDS requiring NIV delivered by face mask for at least 8 hours while in the medical
intensive care unit at the University of Chicago between October 3, 2012, through September
21, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to continue face mask NIV or switch to a
helmet for NIV support for a planned enrollment of 206 patients (103 patients per group).
The helmet is a transparent hood that covers the entire head of the patient and has a rubber
collar neck seal. Early trial termination resulted in 44 patients randomized to the helmet
group and 39 to the face mask group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who
required endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included 28-day invasive
ventilator–free days (ie, days alive without mechanical ventilation), duration of ICU and
hospital length of stay, and hospital and 90-day mortality.
RESULTS Eighty-three patients (45% women; median age, 59 years; median Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score, 26) were included in the
analysis after the trial was stopped early based on predefined criteria for efficacy. The
intubation rate was 61.5% (n = 24) for the face mask group and 18.2% (n = 8) for the helmet
group (absolute difference, −43.3%; 95% CI, −62.4% to −24.3%; P < .001). The number of
ventilator-free days was significantly higher in the helmet group (28 vs 12.5, P < .001). At 90
days, 15 patients (34.1%) in the helmet group died compared with 22 patients (56.4%) in the
face mask group (absolute difference, −22.3%; 95% CI, −43.3 to −1.4; P = .02). Adverse
events included 3 interface-related skin ulcers for each group (ie, 7.6% in the face mask group
had nose ulcers and 6.8% in the helmet group had neck ulcers).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with ARDS, treatment with helmet NIV
resulted in a significant reduction of intubation rates. There was also a statistically significant
reduction in 90-day mortality with helmet NIV. Multicenter studies are needed to replicate
these findings.

N
oninvasive ventilation (NIV) by face mask can obviate
theneedforendotrachealintubationandimprovemor-
tality in patients with acute respiratory failure. Com-
plications of endotracheal intubation include pneumonia,1
excessive sedation,2 delirium,3 and intensive care unit
(ICU)–acquired weakness.4 Noninvasive ventilation allows pa-
tients to remain animated while in the ICU, a strategy now ad-
opted in many ICUs.5 Although benefits of face mask NIV for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations6
and cardiogenic pulmonary edema7 are compelling, its use in
acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) remains contro-
versial. Initial reports suggested improved survival in immu-
nocompromised patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure8;
however, those findings have not been replicated.9 A study by
Fratetal10showedincreasedmortalitywasassociatedwithface
mask NIV for AHRF compared with high-flow nasal cannula.
About half of patients with hypoxemia, especially those
with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are not
helped with face mask ventilation.11,12 Often higher levels of
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve oxygen-
ation are needed. However, at high PEEP, face mask intoler-
ance and air leak can impede effective oxygenation.13 There-
fore, the face mask has limitations that may contribute to
reduced efficacy during AHRF.9
An alternative is to deliver NIV via a helmet interface—a
transparenthoodthatcoverstheentireheadofthepatientwith
a soft collar neck seal. This interface confers several advan-
tages over face mask including improved tolerability and less
airleakduetothehelmet’
slackofcontactwiththefaceandim-
provedsealintegrityattheneck.14,15Therefore,thehelmet’
sde-
sign may allow increased titration of positive airway pressures
without substantial air leak. This could reduce intubation rates
and extend the benefits of NIV to more patients with ARDS.
To our knowledge, there have been no randomized trials
directly comparing face mask to helmet NIV for the preven-
tion of endotracheal intubation in ARDS. We conducted a
single-center, randomized clinical trial of patients admitted to
the ICU for ARDS requiring NIV to determine whether helmet
NIV could reduce the rate of intubation and improve other pa-
tient outcomes.
Methods
Consecutive patients admitted to the adult medical ICU at the
University of Chicago from September 2012 through Septem-
ber 2015 were screened daily. The institutional review board
approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained
from participants or from their authorized surrogate decision
maker. Patients 18 years or older who required face mask NIV
for at least 8 hours for the management of ARDS were eligible
for enrollment. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was de-
fined by the Berlin criteria.16
Patients were excluded if they had impending cardiopul-
monary arrest, a Glasgow coma scale score lower than 8, ab-
senceofairwayprotectivegagreflex,elevatedintracranialpres-
sure, tracheostomy, or upper airway obstruction; were
pregnant; or had refused endotracheal intubation. Patient de-
mographicssuchasracewerecollectedbyself-reportwithfixed
categories. Race data were collected to reflect the diversity of
patients admitted to the medical ICU.
Intervention
After 8 hours of NIV via face mask, patients were approached
forconsent.Theywererandomlyassignedina1:1ratiotoeither
continue with the face mask (control) or switch to a helmet in-
terface (intervention). A computer-generated, permuted block
randomization scheme with varying block sizes ranging from
4 to 8 was used to allocate patients to each group. The block
allocation was blinded. Each assignment was designated in a
consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelope.
Patients randomized to the intervention switched from
a face mask (Philips Respironics) to a latex-free helmet
(Sea Long). The helmet group received NIV via an ICU ventila-
tor (Engström Carestation, GE Healthcare) in pressure support
orcontinuouspositiveairwaypressuremode.Thehelmet,made
oftransparentlatex-freepolyvinylchloride,wassecuredbypad-
ded armpit braces attached to 2 hooks on the front and back of
aplasticringconnectingthehelmettoalatex-freeneckseal,thus
producing a breathing circuit closed from the outside environ-
ment. The patient neck circumference was measured and the
necksealwascuttoensureatightbutcomfortableseal.Thehel-
met was connected to the ventilator by conventional respira-
tory circuitry joining 2 port sites to allow inspiratory and expi-
ratory flow. To avoid carbon dioxide rebreathing, pressure
supportlevelsweresettomaintainaventilatorinspiratoryflow
rate of more than 100 L/min.17 To minimize inspiratory effort
and optimize patient-ventilator synchrony, the ventilator pres-
surization time was set to 50 milliseconds and cycling off de-
lay set to 50% of maximal inspiratory flow (Video).18
The face mask group was managed with a single-limb non-
invasiveventilator(PhilipsRespironicsV60).Thehelmetcould

Both groups had titration of NIV by a standard protocol: PEEP
was increased in increments of 2 to 3 cm H2O to improve oxy-
gen saturation to more than 90% at an inspired oxygen frac-
tion (FIO2) of 60% or less, if possible. Inspiratory pressure was
increasedinincrementsof2to3cmH2Otoobtainarespiratory
rateoflessthan25/minanddisappearanceofaccessorymuscle
activity. For NIV weaning, support was reduced progressively
in accordance to clinical improvement and discontinued if the
patient maintained a respiratory rate of less than 30/min and
partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of more than 75 mm Hg with
FIo2 less than 50% and PEEP of less than 5 cm H2O.
The decision to intubate all patients was based on prede-
termined criteria similar to those used in previous studies of
NIV.10,19 These included neurologic deterioration, persistent
or worsening respiratory failure (eg, oxygen saturation <88%,
respiratory rate >36/min), intolerance of face mask or hel-
met, airway bleeding, or copious respiratory secretions. All de-
cisions to intubate were made by the primary care team with
no involvement from the research team. Patients who re-
quired endotracheal intubation had initial ventilator settings
of assist-control mode with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg of ideal
body weight20 and titration of PEEP to achieve oxygen satu-

Daily interruption of sedation,2 awakening and breathing
trials,21 and early mobilization22 were performed per ICU stan-
dard care. Adverse events were prespecified to include fac-
tors specific to helmet NIV use and included skin ulceration
at the neck seal, patient intolerance (ie, claustrophobia), and
device complications (ie, helmet deflation).
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who un-
derwent endotracheal intubation based on criteria established
a priori.10,19 Secondary outcomes were 28-day invasive venti-
lator-free days (ie, days alive without mechanical ventilation),
duration of ICU and hospital length of stay, hospital and 90-
day mortality, and adverse events. Because we have multiple
secondary outcomes, and we analyzed them without adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons, we considered them explor-
atory.Becauseofthenatureofthe2interventiongroups,blind-
ing was not possible for the outcomes of interest.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming an intubation rate of 50% for patients with hypox-
emicrespiratoryfailurerequiringNIV,10,23,24wecalculatedthat
enrollment of a total of 206 patients would provide 80% power
todetecta20%absolutereductionoftheprimaryoutcome,with
a 2-sided α level of .05. Because previous work has shown that
50% of patients with ARDS treated with NIV delivered via face
mask required intubation,24 we reasoned that a 30% intuba-
tion rate (ie, a 20% reduction) would be a clinically significant
improvement.
Allanalyseswereperformedbyanintention-to-treatanaly-
sis. Patients who died during the study were assigned scores
of 0 for ventilator-free days.25 The χ2 test or Fisher exact test
was used as appropriate to compare categorical variables, in-
cluding the primary outcome. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
2-sample rank sum test or t tests were used to compare con-
tinuous variables. The area under the curve was calculated for
everymeasuredrespiratoryrate,oxygensaturation,FIO2,PEEP,
and pressure support levels during NIV.26 To evaluate the ef-
fect of the intervention on 90-day survival, a time-to-event
analysis estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure was used.
The effect of the intervention was compared between groups
using the log-rank test. The cumulative incidence of intuba-
tion(withdeathwithoutintubationasacompetingrisk)within
each randomized group was estimated using a nonparamet-
ric estimator and compared using the Fine-Gray test.27
Additional analyses were performed with Cox-regression
models that adjusted for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation (APACHE) II and the presence of the helmet inter-
vention. Hazard ratios (HRs) together with 95% CIs were es-
timated using this model. Stata 11.0 (StataCorp LP) software
was used for statistical analyses. The study protocol and sta-
tistical analysis plan are available in the Supplement.
Safety Monitoring
Anindependentdataandsafetymonitoringboard(DSMB)con-
tinuously monitored safety and study conduct. Interim analy-
ses were planned at one-third and two-thirds of enrollment
(70 and 140 patients, respectively). Early stopping for efficacy
was predetermined at a P value <.001 for rejection of the null
hypothesis to declare that the helmet strategy was superior to
face mask. At the first interim analysis, the results met criteria
for early stoppage of the trial for efficacy; however, the DSMB
determined that the trial should continue because the helmet
was not available for use outside the trial; therefore, nonstudy
patients would not be deprived of the benefit. In addition, the
DSMB determined that there were no safety concerns and that
the study had not met other secondary end points that (eg, ICU
length of stay) could have been reached with further enroll-
ment. Subsequent to this, the DSMB evaluated work by
Frat et al10 that reported increased mortality among patients
treatedwithfacemaskNIVcomparedwithhigh-flownasalcan-
nula.TheDSMBdeterminedthatthefacemaskgroupcouldhave
been exposed to increased risk of mortality and because the
studyalreadyhadmetthepreestablishedcriteriaforearlystop-
page, the DSMB recommended that the study be stopped for
both efficacy and safety after the enrollment of 83 patients.
Results
From October 2012 through September 2015, 740 patients
were screened, of whom 83 patients were randomized and
enrolled (Figure 1). Thirty-nine patients were assigned to

conventional face mask and 44 to helmet NIV. No patient was
lost to follow-up. The median interval of NIV prior to random-
ization was not different between face mask and helmet (13.0
vs 10.3 hours, P = .65).
Characteristics at Inclusion
There was no statistically significant difference between base-
line characteristics of patients in both groups. Sixty patients
(72%) had a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of less than 200. Both groups had
a high severity of illness as indicated by APACHE II scores.
About half of the patients in each group were immunocom-
promised by virtue of cancer or transplant, and about one-
third in each group had an immunocompromised pneumo-
nia (Table 1).
Treatments
Patients in both groups had similar postrandomization dura-
tions of NIV treatment. Patients in the helmet group had a me-
dian sustained PEEP of 8.0 H2O vs 5.1 cm H2O in the face mask
group (absolute between-group difference, 1.7 (95% CI, 0.6-
2.9; P = .006). The 2 groups had statistically similar oxygen
saturations. The helmet group had an FIO2 of 50% vs 60% in
the face mask group (absolute difference, −7.5; 95% CI, −14.2
to −0.8; P = .02). Titration of PEEP to higher levels per proto-
col in the face mask group was limited because of patient in-
tolerance and excess air leak. There was no significant change
in respiratory rate in patients receiving NIV via face mask at
the time of randomization (baseline, 28.3/min; to after ran-
domization, 29.1/min; absolute difference, −0.8/min; 95% CI,
−4.9/min to 3.3/min; P = .21). In contrast, the transition from
face mask to helmet resulted in a significant reduction in
tachypnea from 27.7/min at baseline to 24.5/min after ran-
domization (absolute difference, 3.2/min; 95% CI, 0.2/min to
6.1/min; P = <.001).
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
Theintubationratewas61.5%inthefacemaskgroupand18.2%
in the helmet group (absolute difference, −43.3%; 95% CI,
−62.4% to −24.3%; P < .001, Table 2. In a competing risk
analysis,27theunadjustedsubhazardratioforthehelmetgroup
for the primary outcome of endotracheal intubation was 0.22
(95% CI, 0.11-0.47; P < .001). After adjusting for the APACHE II
score and the intervention, the subhazard score for the helmet
remained significant (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.50; P < .001).
The most common reason for intubation among patients in the
face mask group was respiratory failure—ie, tachypnea and
hypoxemia despite protocolized adjustment of NIV settings
(83.3% for face mask vs 37.5% for helmet; absolute difference,
−45.3;95%CI,−82.5to−9.1;P = .01).Incontrast,neurologicfail-
ure (ie, altered mental status, loss of airway protective reflex)

(62.5% for helmet vs 4.2% for face mask; absolute difference,
58.3; 95% CI, 24.8-92.8; P = .001).
In the exploratory secondary analyses, the helmet group
had more ventilator-free days than the face mask group (28 vs
12.5;absolutedifference,8.4;95%CI,13.4to3.4;P < .001).The
helmet group spent 4.7 days in the ICU vs 7.8 days for the face
mask group (absolute difference, −2.76; 95% CI, −6.07 to 0.54;
P = .04) but did not spend statistically significant less time in
the hospital (10.1 days for the helmet group vs 15.2 days for the
facemaskgroup;absolutedifference,−2.92days;95%CI,−8.47
to 2.63 days; P = .16).
Hospital and 90-day mortality were significantly lower in
the helmet group than in the face mask group (Table 2). The
unadjusted HR for death at 90 days was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.24 to
0.91 days; P = .03) in the helmet group. The APACHE II score
was also independently associated with death at 90 days (HR,
1.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.15; P = .02). The risk of death at 90 days

remained significantly lower in the helmet NIV group after ad-
justment for APACHE II score ratio (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.23 to
0.99; P = .047; Figure 2).
Adverse Events
Overall, the incidence of adverse events was low. There were
2 instances when the helmet was deflated, which was quickly
corrected and did not result in endotracheal intubation. There
was no statistical difference in the rate of mask-related skin
ulceration between groups with 3 patients (7.6%) in the face
mask group with a nose ulcer and 3 patients (6.8%) in the hel-
met group with a neck ulcer.
Discussion
In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, NIV delivered
by helmet significantly reduced the intubation rate among
patients with ARDS compared with the patients receiving NIV
by face mask. The helmet also was associated with improved
ventilator-freedaysandsignificantlyreducedICUlengthofstay
as well as 90-day mortality.
Avoiding intubation is critical for patients with acute
respiratory failure because endotracheal intubation is asso-
ciated with numerous infectious1 neurologic,28 respiratory,
and musculoskeletal complications.29 Such complications
can have long-standing consequences, particularly among
patients with ARDS.30 The 8-hour period of face mask NIV
was chosen a priori as a study entry criterion to avoid
patients needing NIV for only a short time; this ensured that
only those with high illness acuity and a substantial chance
of requiring endotracheal intubation were enrolled. The sig-
nificant reduction in the intubation rate may be explained
in part by the effective delivery of higher levels of PEEP. We
hypothesized that the helmet’
s neck seal would allow for
delivery of higher airway pressures without substantial air

domized to the helmet group had substantially higher levels
of PEEP, which were sustained throughout NIV. This corre-
sponded with a significant reduction in the respiratory rate
and similar oxygen saturation levels on a lower FIO2 than
achieved with face mask. These higher sustained PEEP lev-
els appear to have maintained acceptable gas exchange,
thereby reducing the need for intubation. In addition to the
PEEP effects, high ventilator fresh gas flow with the helmet
interface was noted, typically between 100 to 200 L/min.
High fresh gas flow rates reduce the risk of CO2 rebreathing
in the helmet.17 Thus, the PEEP and fresh gas flow effects of
helmet NIV appear to have improved oxygenation and work
of breathing so that failures of helmet NIV were rarely due
to respiratory failure, but instead usually due to mental sta-
tus changes and loss of the airway protective reflex.
The observed intubation and mortality rates among pa-
tients in the face mask group were higher than some recently
reported studies of AHRF.9,10,31 However, our patients had very
high APACHE II scores, with predicted mortality rates in the
50% range.32 A study by Frat et al10 recently reported in-
creased mortality among patients with AHRF randomized to
face mask NIV compared with patients randomized to high-
flownasalcannula,althoughtherewerenodifferencesinover-
all intubation rates. The patients in this trial had much lower
severity of illness than patients in our trial, as measured by av-
erage Simplified Acute Physiology Scores (SAPS II) of be-
tween 24 and 27. These scores predict a hospital mortality of
between 5.8% and 7.9%.33 Lemiale et al9 noted no difference
in intubation or 28-day mortality in immunocompromised pa-
tientsrandomizedtoreceivemaskNIVoroxygentherapyalone.
Despite being immunocompromised, the median admission
SequentialOrganFailureAssessment(SOFA)scorewas5inboth
groups,9 compared with a SOFA score of 7 in the current study.
In contrast, Antonelli et al24 previously reported that pa-
tients with ARDS treated with face mask NIV had a 51% intu-
bation rate and a 64% hospital mortality, similar to the face
mask NIV group.
The helmet interface is a relatively novel approach to NIV
and this study has several cautions and limitations. First, the
large internal volume of the helmet and its high compliance
may lead to CO2 rebreathing17,34 and patient-ventilator
dyssynchrony.35 Also recruitment maneuvers cannot be ap-
plied with noninvasive ventilation.36 The study findings sug-
gest that patients whose ARDS was managed with helmet NIV
should have pressure support levels set to ensure high inspi-
ratory flow levels (ie, greater than 100 L/min—this was al-
ways easily achievable with modest pressure support set-
tings; Table 3),17 as well as periodic arterial blood sampling
during helmet use.34
Second, like any new tool or technology, there is likely to
be a learning curve as clinicians gain familiarity. Careful train-
ing of all physicians and staff will be needed, just as was the
case 20 years ago when face mask NIV was first introduced.
Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists involved in this
study quickly became familiar and comfortable with helmet
NIV during the course of the trial.
Third, the nature of this trial intervention made blind-
ing impossible. Accordingly, we followed predetermined cri-
teria for endotracheal intubation to decrease bias. Fourth, as
a single-center trial, our results may not have external valid-
ity. Fifth, although this study was stopped early for efficacy
based on predetermined criteria, the significance of the
effect size of the primary outcome suggests that the prob-
ability of type I error is very low. However, early stoppage of
trials tends to exaggerate the magnitude of the effect size
and future studies replicating this trial may report lower
efficacy of helmet NIV.
The physiologic effects observed with helmet NIV sug-
gest biologic plausibility for the prevention of endotracheal in-
tubation by enhanced PEEP effect. These findings also affirm
the far-reaching benefits of spontaneous yet highly sup-
ported ventilation in an awake, animated patient over inva-
sive mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube. These find-
ings warrant further investigation of helmet NIV for patients
with ARDS and other types of AHRF, particularly with atten-
tion to long-term outcomes.30
Conclusions
For patients with ARDS, treatment with helmet NIV was asso-
ciated with a significant reduction of intubation rates com-
pared with delivery by face mask. There was also a statisti-
callysignificantreductionin90-daymortalitywithhelmetNIV.
Multicenter studies are needed to replicate these findings.
