Introduction
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease, for which the diagnosis is associated with an extremely poor 
prognosis and median survival of 14 months following surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (1–3). Our 
group and others have pioneered a DC vaccine–based immunotherapy platform, the results of which have 
suggested benefit in early-phase trials by promoting an endogenous antitumoral immune response (4–7). 
An ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial is now underway based on these results. 
However, survival in DC vaccine-treated GBM patients has been varied (5). While increased T cell infiltra-
tion correlates with survival benefit across subjects, the ability to generate and sustain this response appears 
to be dependent on factors such as active tumor progression and GBM subtype (4, 8). These findings 
emphasize the need to more clearly understand the cellular mechanisms by which DC vaccination induces 
effective tumor-specific immune responses.
A possible explanation for the variability of vaccine efficacy is that the tumor and its microenvironment 
can adapt to suppress an immune response directed against them. Studies in various cancer models have sug-
gested that checkpoint mechanisms, which exist to promote self-tolerance and protect against autoimmunity, 
can develop in the tumor microenvironment (9–14). PD-1/PD-L1 (programmed death 1/programmed death 
ligand 1) has been shown to induce functional anergy and limit activation of cytotoxic T cells during long-
term exposure to antigen, a phenomenon associated with neoplastic disease (9, 15–17). The upregulation 
of inhibitory PD-L1 in tumor cells appears to be associated with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs), a phenomenon readily noted in immunogenic cancers with an endogenous immune infiltrate (18, 19). 
Studies in melanoma have frequently shown robust antitumor responses in response to PD-1 mAb blockade 
DC vaccination with autologous tumor lysate has demonstrated promising results for the treatment 
of glioblastoma (GBM) in preclinical and clinical studies. While the vaccine appears capable of 
inducing T cell infiltration into tumors, the effectiveness of active vaccination in progressively 
growing tumors is less profound. In parallel, a number of studies have identified negative 
costimulatory pathways, such as programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1), 
as relevant mediators of the intratumoral immune responses. Clinical responses to PD-1 pathway 
inhibition, however, have also been varied. To evaluate the relevance to established glioma, the 
effects of PD-1 blockade following DC vaccination were tested in intracranial (i.c.) glioma tumor–
bearing mice. Treatment with both DC vaccination and PD-1 mAb blockade resulted in long-term 
survival, while neither agent alone induced a survival benefit in animals with larger, established 
tumors. This survival benefit was completely dependent on CD8+ T cells. Additionally, DC vaccine 
plus PD-1 mAb blockade resulted in the upregulation of integrin homing and immunologic memory 
markers on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In clinical samples, DC vaccination in GBM 
patients was associated with upregulation of PD-1 expression in vivo, while ex vivo blockade of 
PD-1 on freshly isolated TILs dramatically enhanced autologous tumor cell cytolysis. These findings 
strongly suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays an important role in the adaptive immune 
resistance of established GBM in response to antitumor active vaccination and provide us with a 
rationale for the clinical translation of this combination therapy.

(20–22). It was first shown that inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 promotes the antitumoral activity of TILs present 
in B16 melanoma models (23–27). This blockade was dependent on the presence of an infiltrating CD8+ 
population (21). PD-1/PD-L1–mediated suppression was noted in a glioma model, as well. Adjuvant PD-1 
mAb blockade combined with external beam ionizing radiation promoted long-term survival in mice when 
compared with mice that only received radiation alone (28).
Unlike melanoma, however, GBM are not inherently immunogenic, and active vaccination is neces-

sary to first generate an intratumoral immune response. In this study, we demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 
modulates adaptive immune resistance to tumor lysate–pulsed DC vaccine treatment in our murine glioma 
model. Specifically, we show that this negative costimulatory ligand plays a role in suppressing TIL acti-
vation, trafficking, and memory responses and that blocking PD-1 can reverse this suppression. Finally, 
we recapitulated these findings in our patient-derived GBM tissue by a series of ex vivo studies, further 
documenting the clinical relevance of the PD-1 mechanism. Thus, these findings suggest that the combina-
tion of DC vaccine with PD-1 mAb blockade in human GBM provides a clinically translatable means of 
promoting an antitumoral immune response and attenuating immune suppression.
Results
DC vaccination promotes an antitumor, infiltrating T cell response but is ineffective in established intracranial glioma. 
We previously noted that established tumor burden and immunosuppressive cytokine levels negatively cor-
related with immune responsiveness and patient survival after DC vaccination (4). As such, we were inter-
ested to examine the critical mechanisms of resistance to vaccine treatment in the face of established tumor 
burden, despite T cell infiltration. To evaluate this question, mice were implanted with 2 × 104 murine 
GL261 glioma cells in the brain and treated with tumor lysate–pulsed DC vaccination. Mice that began 
receiving DC vaccine on the day of tumor implant, prior to establishment, showed significant survival ben-
efit (Figure 1A). Mice that did not begin receiving DC vaccine treatments until 3 days after tumor implanta-
tion or later did not demonstrate increased survival when compared with nontreated controls (Figure 1B). 
Thus, we showed that DC vaccination was ineffective when there is a larger, established tumor burden.
To determine whether vaccination promoted a local immune response in these established tumors, 
explanted brains were analyzed by IHC staining. DC vaccine–treated tumors showed a robust CD3+ infil-
trating population (Figure 1, C–F) similar to what was seen in patients’ tumors (4), suggesting that DC 
vaccine treatment elicited a significant intratumoral immune response compared with nontreated controls, 
despite being ineffective at promoting long-term survival in mice with established tumors. To assess wheth-
er this tumor-associated lymphocyte population was glioma reactive, we evaluated the ability of purified 
TILs to lyse cultured GL261 glioma cells in vitro. In a real-time cytotoxicity assay, CD3+ TILs from DC 
vaccine–treated mice showed 50% cytotoxicity against cultured GL261 glioma cells over 20 hours, whereas 
splenic lymphocyte controls demonstrated little or no cytotoxicity (Figure 1G). In whole, these findings 
demonstrated that, despite a lack of survival benefit in mice with established tumor burden, DC vaccina-
tion induced a significant antitumor immune infiltrate.
Adjuvant PD-1 mAb blockade in the setting of  established tumor burden enhances the therapeutic benefit of  DC 
vaccination. We hypothesized that local immune suppression in the intracranial (i.c.) tumor microenvi-
ronment prevented an effective antitumor T cell response following DC vaccination. Recent studies have 
described PD-1–mediated suppression of T cell responses (9, 21). In our mouse glioma model, we found 
relevant increases in the expression of PD-1 on TILs following DC vaccination in larger, established tumors 
(Figure 2, A and B). There was also a significant increase in PD-1 expression on TILs compared with splen-
ic lymphocytes in both control nontreatment and DC-vaccinated mice (Figure 2B). In order to gain a more 
complete understanding of the genetic changes of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in our mouse model, 
RNA was isolated from CD3+ TILs of nontreated control and DC vaccine–treated mice, and quantitative 
transcriptional changes were assessed. We noted a significant upregulation in PD-1, confirming the FACS 
data (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/jci.
insight.87059DS1). Other T cell markers of immune inhibition, including CTLA-4, TIGIT, ICOS, BTLA, 
and TGF-β, were downregulated on TILs following DC vaccine treatment (Supplemental Figure 1, B–F).
Because PD-1 was the only inhibitory marker elevated on TILs following DC vaccination in murine 
samples, we hypothesized that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway mediated immune suppression of the DC vac-
cine–induced immune response in established tumors. We noted that GL261 glioma cells expressed PD-L1 
(Supplemental Figure 2). To evaluate the relevance of this finding in our murine model, we first cocultured 
TILs harvested from tumor-bearing mice treated with DC vaccination together with i.c. derived GL261 
tumor bulk cells and found that ex vivo PD-1 mAb blockade significantly increased GL261 glioma cell 
cytolysis over control cocultures of TILs with tumor bulk alone (Figure 2C and Supplemental Figure 3). 
We then performed in vivo PD-1 mAb blockade together with tumor lysate–pulsed DC vaccination in mice 
with established i.c. GL261 gliomas. When PD-1 mAb blockade was administered concomitantly with 
DC vaccination, a highly significant survival benefit resulted. Approximately 40% long-term survival was

observed selectively in the combination treatment group (Figure 2D). As we described before, there was no 
therapeutic benefit with DC vaccination alone in these large, established tumors. Similarly, there was no 
survival benefit noted with PD-1 mAb blockade alone. As such, this data suggested that antibody blockade 
of PD-1 recovered the therapeutic benefit of DC vaccination in the established i.c. glioma setting.
PD-1 mAb blockade enhances the functional intratumoral CD8+ T cell response. To understand this PD-1 
regulatory mechanism and the immune cell subsets critical for the survival benefit seen with the com-
binatorial treatment, we depleted mice of either CD4+ or CD8+ cells. As depicted in Figure 3, A and B, 
the clinical benefit of a combined DC vaccine and PD-1 mAb blockade was completely dependent on 
CD8+ cells and not on CD4+ cells. DC vaccination induced a highly significant increase in the tumor 
infiltrating CD3+ T cell population, which was also maintained in the combination DC vaccine plus 
PD-1 mAb setting (Figure 3C). Of note, there was no change in the numbers of tumor-infiltrating 
helper T cell (CD4+) or Treg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) populations across treatment groups (Supplemental 
Figure 4, A and B). A significant proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ cells from DC vaccine– and DC 
vaccine plus PD-1 mAb–treated mice was composed of CD8+ T cells. Thus, we evaluated differences 
in the activation pattern of these T cells between DC vaccine– and DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb–treated 
mice. Expression of CD25, the high-affinity subunit of IL-2R, was evaluated. Even though there was an 
elevation in the percentage of activated CD8+CD25+ T cells in PD-1 mAb–treated mice, only a minimal 
number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells could be isolated in the absence of a DC vaccine. In contrast, we 
observed a significant number of infiltrating T cells in the presence of a DC vaccine; however, without

PD-1 mAb treatment, there was not a significant proportion of activated cells. Only in mice treated with 
both DC vaccination and PD-1 mAb blockade was there a significant increase in both the proportion 
and number of activated CD8+CD25+ T cells (Figure 3D). Thus, our findings suggest that the addition 
of PD-1 mAb blockade to a DC vaccine enhances the migration and activation of T cell responses in a 
CD8-dependent fashion.
To obtain a more complete understanding of the gene expression differences between TIL isolated 
from DC vaccine– versus DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb–treated animals, we performed an unbiased tran-
scriptional screen of purified TILs. In purified TIL populations isolated from mice treated with DC vac-
cination and PD-1 mAb blockade, there was increased transcription of the late-activation marker IL-2Rα, 
as well as genes associated with activation, homing, and survival (Supplemental Figure 5, A and B). Fur-
thermore, cell-free supernatants from ex vivo cocultures of TILs and GL261 tumor cells had significantly 
elevated concentrations of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the presence of PD-1 mAb (Supplemental Figure 6, A and 
B). These findings suggested that suppression of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling mechanism via PD-1 mAb 
blockade activates CD8+ TILs.

PD-1 mAb blockade enhances the trafficking of  a tumor-infiltrating memory CD8+ T cell population into i.c. 
gliomas. Previous work has suggested that expression of the α4, β1 integrin was critical for the trafficking 
of tumor-specific T cells to glioma (29, 30). Additionally, the development of a memory response with 
inhibition of PD-1 has been previously described (31, 32). To evaluate this in our model, we compared the 
pattern of memory and integrin homing markers from splenic T cells and TILs harvested from our DC 
vaccine– and DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb–treated mice. In both treatment groups, there was a population 
of memory T cells (CD8+CD44+) in the spleen (Figure 4A) that was not different. However, a significant 
increase in the percentage of tumor-infiltrating memory T cells was observed with adjuvant PD-1 block-
ade, such that there was an approximate 2-fold increase across treatment groups (Figure 4, B and C). We 
further interrogated CD8+CD44+ memory T cells for the expression of CD62L (L-selectin), a lymph node 
homing receptor expressed on central memory T cells. There was a significantly elevated proportion of 
CD8+CD44+ memory T cells in the spleen from DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb–treated mice that expressed 
CD62L when compared with mice that only received DC vaccination (Figure 4D). This difference was also 
significant when we looked specifically at tumor-infiltrating cells (Figure 4E). Previous work has demon-
strated the role of tumor homing signals, such as the integrin α-4 chain (CD49d), to promote T cell traffick-
ing to CNS tumors (33). In our model, we noted that the concomitant use of PD-1 mAb blockade together 
with DC vaccination was associated with a statistically elevated proportion of CD8+CD44+ memory T cells 
that expressed CD49d (Figure 4, F and G). To evaluate how such T cell populations influenced immune 
memory, we challenged surviving mice from the DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb treatment cohort 60 days after 
the initial tumor inoculation with GL261 glioma cells in the contralateral hemisphere. These mice did not 
receive any additional treatments. When compared with naive control mice, a significant survival benefit 
was noted in the long-term survivors from previous DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb therapy (Figure 4H). Such 
findings suggested that the addition of PD-1 mAb blockade to tumor lysate–pulsed DC vaccination pro-
moted selective i.c. glioma trafficking and immune memory.
Ex vivo PD-1 mAb blockade enhances TIL cytotoxicity against patient GBM cells. To evaluate whether similar 
biological principles exist in human GBM patients, we interrogated our clinical trial patient samples using 
a quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence staining panel. There was marked PD-L1 expression in the 
GBM tumor microenvironment (Supplemental Figure 7, A–F). Additionally, the percentage of CD8+ TILs 
that dually expressed PD-1 was elevated following DC vaccine treatment compared with the percentage 
seen in pretreatment samples (Figure 5, A–H). We noted that this difference was significant across multiple 
patient samples (Figure 5I). Having confirmed upregulated PD-1 expression on our patient TILs, we next 
evaluated whether ex vivo PD-1 mAb blockade enhanced TIL function in purified, live GBM TILs. To test 
this, we obtained fresh GBM tissue samples from patients undergoing surgical resection to remove their 
tumors and harvested CD3+ TILs and autologous tumor cells. When these TILs were cocultured with the 
original GBM tumor, we noted some cytotoxicity (Figure 5J). However, when a blocking PD-1 mAb was 
added to the cocultures ex vivo, there was a significant increase in cytotoxicity across samples. This demon-
strated that the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling mechanism suppressed the cytotoxicity of TILs. We confirmed that 
TILs exerted a tumor-specific immune response, as there was minimal tumor cytolysis when TILs from 1 
patient were cocultured with GBM from another patient (Supplemental Figure 8). Together, these findings 
suggested that DC vaccination results in upregulated PD-1 expression in GBM patients and, when blocked 
ex vivo, could restore function in tumor-infiltrating T cells.
Discussion
In immunogenic cancers, such as melanoma, biologic therapies that incorporate PD-1 blocking antibodies 
(nivolumab or pembrolizumab) have resulted in extended patient survival in randomized controlled trials 
(34–42). However, as suggested by Tumeh et al., the significant survival benefit in melanoma patients was 
dependent on a preexisting infiltrating population of cytotoxic T cells (21). A study in GBM patients noted 
that increased T cell infiltrates at the time of resection were predictive of increased survival (43). Based on 
our previous work, such T cell infiltration is not consistent across GBM subtypes, with nonmesenchymal 
subtypes exhibiting a lower endogenous lymphocyte infiltration when compared with mesenchymal GBM 
(8). Although results of ongoing trials examining GBM treatment with PD-1 mAb alone have not yet been 
published, we hypothesize that clinical efficacy may be varied and dependent on a preexisting TIL popula-
tion for PD-1 mAb treatment to work.
Our group previously demonstrated that, despite promoting a T cell infiltrating response, the ability

of active vaccination to initiate an immune response and improve 
survival is less consistent in patients with large, progressive dis-
ease (4). Thus, we were particularly interested to understand the 
mechanisms that would prevent some patients with established 
and progressive recurrent disease from showing survival benefits. 
In this study, we effectively recapitulated these clinical findings in 
our mouse model by vaccinating mice bearing large established 
i.c. gliomas. We demonstrated that, despite generating a signifi-
cant localized CD8-dominant tumor-specific T cell response with 
vaccination, there was no significant survival benefit when mice 
were vaccinated in the setting of large, progressive i.c. tumors. 
Importantly, additional vaccine treatments did not provide therapeutic benefit for mice bearing these larger 
tumors (data not shown). The corresponding elevation of PD-1 expression with increasing TILs follow-
ing vaccination suggested that the PD-1/PD-L1 negative costimulatory mechanism of adaptive immune 
resistance becomes functionally relevant in an environment of elevated tumor burden (44). As such, while 
the T cell response appears to be crippled by these regulatory mechanisms, it is significantly functionally 
activated when the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is inhibited. Thus, by generating an immune response in a non-
immunogenic, established tumor — and by activating it with PD-1 mAb blockade — we are able to both 
generate and maintain effective immunity with therapeutic benefit (Figure 6).
Mice that had been treated with DC vaccine and PD-1 mAb were able to reject a second tumor 
inoculation without additional vaccination or PD-1 mAb treatments. The relevance of PD-1/PD-L1 to 
memory T cell generation in the tumor environment has been described previously (31, 45). Interestingly, 
an elevated proportion of our central memory T cell population in mice vaccinated with adjuvant PD-1 
mAb blockade expressed elevated tumor homing markers CD62L and CD49d. These findings suggest that 
this population may represent a subset of memory T cells that are recent emigrants into the tumor. As 
they mature to become effector cells, they may downregulate these homing markers. Another possibility 
is that these non-CD62L– and CD49d-expressing memory T cells may represent a resident memory T cell 
population analogous to those present in barrier tissues such as the epithelium of skin, lung, and gastro-
intestinal tract (46, 47). These resident cells likewise express memory cell markers, but they are generally 
thought to be unable to recirculate from tissue to lymph and then back again, an important aspect of the 
homing phenotype (47). Together, these findings suggest that, despite a large, established nonimmuno-
genic tumor, we are able to generate and maintain an immune response that both targets existing tumors 
and prevents tumor recurrence: a hallmark of GBM. It is possible that, in patients, dual vaccination and 
PD-1 mAb blockade will not only enhance survival benefit with established tumors, but also decrease the 
likelihood of GBM recurring.
The role of helper T cells and Tregs in tumor-mediated immune suppression has been examined 
(48–51). Although we cannot rule out that PD-1 mAb blockade does not affect the function of Tregs, 
we did note in our studies that CD8+ T cells largely mediated our antitumoral immune response with no 
significant changes in CD4+ and CD4+ Treg populations across treatment groups. Depletion of CD4+ T 
cells did not provide any added benefit compared with DC vaccine alone. Importantly, the DC vaccine 
plus PD-1 mAb treatment was not improved with the depletion of CD4+ T cells. Our flow cytometry 
data on harvested cells demonstrated that there was no increase in the tumor-infiltrating helper T cell and 
Treg populations with DC vaccine treatment, and adjuvant PD-1 mAb did not reduce their proportion in 
the tumor environment. Therefore, while it is possible that CD4+ cells play some role in the PD-1/PD-L1 
mechanism on a broader scale, our results suggest that this is noncontributory in our DC vaccine plus 
PD-1 mAb treatment model.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the PD-1/ PD-L1 negative costimulatory system mediates adap-
tive immune resistance to the vaccine-generated tumor infiltrating T cell response in GBM. Specifically, we 
described the effect of PD-1 blockade on intratumoral effector and memory T cells. We demonstrated dras-
Figure 6. Therapeutic benefit for i.c. glioma is dependent on TIL infiltra-
tion and activation. DC vaccination promotes activation of a significant 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) population, which is then further 
activated in the presence of PD-1 mAb blockade.

tically improved survival in the in vivo setting following both treatments. Furthermore, mice that survived 
the initial tumor challenge inoculation following DC vaccine plus PD-1 mAb treatment sustained survival 
benefit over naive controls when rechallenged with tumors contralaterally. With this study, we also demon-
strated the necessity of a vaccine-generated TIL population in order for the PD-1 pathway to be able to 
exert an effect within GBM tumors. Although there is probably a broad spectrum of tumor environment–
mediated adaptive inhibition, PD-1 is a likely dominant regulatory mechanism in vaccine-induced immune 
suppression in our model. Future studies are needed to better understand what is likely a heterogeneous 
array of mechanisms utilized to prevent antitumor activity. The interplay of these mechanisms may provide 
the key to successfully treating GBM using endogenous immune mechanisms.
Methods
Human tissue samples. Paraffin-embedded human GBM tissues from pre- and post-DC vaccine treatments 
were obtained through the Brain Tumor Translation Resource (BTTR) at UCLA and used for histology 
and IHC. GBM tissue from freshly resected patient samples was placed in collagenase overnight for diges-
tion and then passed through a Percoll gradient to separate TIL and tumor cell layers; it was then used for 
functional ex vivo assays.
GL261 lysate preparation. GL261 glioma cells, obtained from Henry Brem (Johns Hopkins University) 
were cultured in complete DMEM media. Cells were then harvested and subjected to several freeze-thaw 
cycles. The suspension was then filtered, and the concentration of the lysate obtained was then quantified 
using a Bradford protein assay.
Cell lines. Cells were maintained in complete DMEM (Mediatech), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gem-
ini Bio Products), and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin (Mediatech Cellgro) and cultured in a humid-
ified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Murine Model. Female C57BL/6 mice, age 6–8 weeks, were obtained from our institutional breed-
ing colony and kept under defined-flora pathogen-free conditions at the Association for Assessment and 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–approved animal facility of the Division of Experimental Radi-
ation Oncology at UCLA.
i.c. glioma implantation. Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were anaesthetized, and GL261 glioma 
cells (2 × 104 in 2 μl PBS) were stereotactically injected at 2.5 mm lateral to bregma at a depth of 3.5 mm 
below the dura mater with a sterile Hamilton syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle. The i.c. injection was 
performed over a 2-minute period. Following i.c. tumor implantation, mice were randomized into treat-
ment groups (n = 6–16 mice/group).
BM-derived DC and vaccination model. DCs were prepared from murine BM progenitor cells using a 
method previously described (52). Mice were treated with s.c. injections of lysate-pulsed DC vaccination (1 
× 106 cells/mouse) on days 3 and 13 after implantation (elevated tumor burden) or days 0, 7, and 14 (low 
tumor burden).
In vivo antibody treatments and cell depletions. PD-1 mAb (clone RMP1-14, BioXCell) was administered 
i.p. at 250 mg/kg daily on days 3–5 and 13–15. CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioXCell) and CD8 (clone YTS 169.4, 
BioXCell) depleting antibodies were administered i.p. at 200 mg/kg every other day starting 4 days prior 
to tumor implantation.
Tissue harvests, IHC, and flow cytometry. Spleens, lymph nodes, and tumor-bearing brain hemispheres 
were harvested from mice on day 16, 72 hours following the second DC vaccination. In cases where sec-
tioning and IHC were required, tissue was placed in Zinc Fixative (BD Biosciences) for 24 hours and then 
transferred to 70% ethanol before being embedded in paraffin wax. Murine tissue was stained via IHC 
methods with the assistance of the UCLA Translational Pathology Core Laboratory (TPCL) for CD3. 
Immunofluorescent staining was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) 5-μm patient-de-
rived tissue sections as described (21) using CD8 (clone C8/144B, DAKO, 1/5,000), PD-1 (clone EPR4877, 
abcam, 1/50,000), and PD-L1 (clone 1-111A, eBioscience, 1:4,000). Cy3 and FITC TSA kits (Invitrogen) 
were used to visualize primary antibody, and nuclei were visualized with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(DAPI; Invitrogen). Analyses for all tissue was performed using the Vectra inForm analysis software to 
select and quantify staining and colocalization of markers of interest.
For flow cytometric staining, tumor-bearing brain hemisphere was placed into tissue collagenase over-
night. Lymphocytes were isolated from the tumor suspension the following day using 30%–70% Percoll 
gradient or from spleens using a 70-μm mesh cell strainer. Remaining tumor burden was maintained in

DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin. In experiments 
requiring analysis of isolated lymphocytes, cells were stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies to 
CD3 (clone 17A2), CD4 (clone 4SM95), CD8 (clone 53–6.7), CD25 (clone PC61.5), FoxP3 (clone FJK-
16s), Thy1.2 (clone 30-H12), and PD-1 (clone RMP1-14) obtained from eBioscience All FACS analysis 
was performed with the use of an LSRII (BD Biosciences). Gates were set based on isotype-specific control 
antibodies (data not shown). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software. TILs used in in vitro assays were 
FACS sorted for CD3+Thy1.2+ using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences).
nCounter GX NanoString Analysis. TILs were harvested and then FACS sorted for Thy1.2+CD11b– T 
cells. Sorted cells were then lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, RNEasy Kit). The gene expression (2,500–10,000 
cells/ sample) of approximately 770 genes was quantified via direct binding to tagged probes using the 
nString NanoString system.
Multianalyte Luminex immunoassay. FACS-sorted TILs were placed into culture with GL261 tumor with 
or without 10 μg/ml PD-1 mAb (murine, clone RMP1-14; human, clone J110, BioXCell). After 24 hours, 
supernatant was collected and then processed using the multianalyte Luminex immunoassay.
Real-time cytotoxicity assay. Cytotoxic killing of tumor cells was assessed using the xCELLigence Real-
Time Cell Analyzer System (Acea Biotechnology). In mice, T cells were initially harvested from tumor-bear-
ing brain hemispheres or spleens and then purified via Percoll gradient and FACS sorting (CD11b–, CD3+). 
In patient samples, T cells were harvested from freshly resected tumor tissue and then purified. After over-
night tumor culture to allow adherence of the cells to the well bottom, T cells were added to tumor cell cul-
tures at a 10:1 T cell/tumor ratio. Cell index values (relative cell impedance) were collected over 15 hours 
and normalized to the maximal cell index value immediately prior to effector cell plating using RTCA 
Software 2.0 (Acea Biotechnology) as described previously (53). PD-1 mAb was added to the T cell cultures 
prior to coculture at 10 μg/ml where necessary.
Statistics. The 2-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare continuous variables. Data that necessitated 
the comparison of more than 2 groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Kruskal-Wallis statistics. 
Data and data bars in figures represent mean ± SEM. Values were considered significant at P < 0.05. In the 
cases of survival studies, median survival times were graphed using Kaplan-Meier plots and analyzed using 
log-rank survival statistics.
Study approval. For human studies, patients provided informed consent for their tissue to be used for 
research purposes, which was approved by UCLA Medical IRB. For murine studies, mice were handled in 
accordance with the UCLA animal care policy and approved animal protocols.
