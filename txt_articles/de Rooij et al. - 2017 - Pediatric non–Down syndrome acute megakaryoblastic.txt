Abstract
Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (AMKL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 
which cells morphologically resemble abnormal megakaryoblasts. While rare in adults, AMKL 
accounts for 4–15% of newly diagnosed childhood AML1–3. AMKL in patients without Down 
syndrome (non-DS-AMKL) is frequently associated with poor outcomes. Previous efforts have 
identified chimeric oncogenes in a significant number of cases, including RBM15-MKL1, 
CBFA2T3-GLIS2, KMT2A gene rearrangements and NUP98-KDM5A4–6. The etiology of 30–
40% of cases, however, remains unknown. To better understand the genomic landscape of non-DS-
AMKL, we performed RNA and exome sequencing on specimens from 99 patients (75 pediatric 
and 24 adult). We demonstrate that pediatric non-DS-AMKL is a heterogeneous malignancy that 
can be divided into seven subgroups with varying outcomes. These subgroups are characterized by 
chimeric oncogenes with cooperating mutations in epigenetic and kinase signaling genes. Overall, 
these data shed light on the etiology of AMKL and provide useful information for treatment 
tailoring.
The earliest insight into the genomic alterations that drive non-DS-AMKL occurred with the 
recognition of a recurrent t(1;22) found in infants7. Ten years after this initial report, the 
RBM15 and MKL1 genes involved in this translocation were identified4,8. Subsequent to 
this, a high resolution study of DNA copy number abnormalities (CNAs) and loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) on pediatric de novo AML identified a significant number of 
alterations in non-DS-AMKL cases, suggesting that additional gene rearrangements may be 
present in this population9. To define the functional consequences of these structural 
variations, diagnostic leukemia specimens from 14 pediatric patients previously underwent 
RNA and exome sequencing5. This effort identified chimeric transcripts encoding fusion 
proteins in 12 of 14 cases, including the novel recurrent CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion which 
correlates with a poor prognosis. In parallel, a separate non-DS-AMKL cohort was evaluated 
by PCR and split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for fusion events 
associated with myeloid malignancies including NUP98 and KMT2A gene rearrangements 
(KMT2Ar)6. In this cohort, NUP98 and KMT2Ar were identified in 15% and 10% of cases 
respectively. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genomic alterations that 
lead to non-DS-AMKL, specimens from 99 patients (75 pediatric and 24 adult cases) were 
subjected to RNA and/or exome sequencing (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Combined with 
the 14 cases previously described, the pediatric cohort described in this manuscript yields 89 
cases, the largest of this rare malignancy to undergo next generation sequencing to date.
Of the 93 patients for whom sufficient RNA was available, 5.5% adult and 72.4% pediatric 
cases carried a structural variation (SV) predicted to lead to a fusion product by RNAseq 
(Supplementary Table 4). Ten additional fusion events in the 19 patients that lacked RNA for 
sequencing could be recognized by RT-PCR, FISH, or southern blotting (Figure 1, 
Supplementary Tables 1,4). In the pediatric cohort, the most frequent previously reported

 fusion events include CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (18.6%), KMT2Ar (17.4%), NUP98-KDM5A 
(11.6%), and RBM15-MKL1 (10.5%). Previously described low frequency non-DS-AMKL 
fusions identified in this expanded cohort include a case of NIPBL-HOXB9 and a novel, but 
analogous NIPBL-HOXA9 fusion5. Similarly, a case carrying GATA2-HOXA10 was 
identified, which is comparable to the GATA2-HOXA9 fusion that has been reported in a 
single case5. Chimeric transcripts not previously described include several fusions involving 
genes within the HOX cluster (EWSR1-HOXB8, PLEK-HOXA11-AS, BMP2K-HOXD10, 
and EP300-HOXA7). Collectively, fusions involving a HOX cluster gene (HOXr) occurred 
in 14% of patients within this cohort (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1,4). Many of the 
HOXr are predicted to lead to an in-frame functional fusion protein (Table 1, Supplementary 
Table 4). As proof of principal, we evaluated three of these fusion events and found all three 
to enhance self-renewal as determined by an in vitro colony replating assay (Supplemental 
Figure 1). Several fusions, however, involve non-coding RNA species and are predicted to 
result in a loss of function of these regulatory transcripts (Supplementary Table 4). 3.5% of 
cases carried non-recurrent fusion proteins involving hematopoietic transcription factors and 
epigenetic regulators, including MN1-FLI1, BCR-ABL1, and MAP2K2-AF10 
(Supplementary Tables 1,4). 3.5% of cases were found to have chimeric transcripts involving 
the cohesin gene STAG2 which were all predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein 
(Supplementary Tables 1,4). In 21% of the pediatric cases, no potentially oncogenic fusion 
event could be detected. However, in 50% of these latter cases, a truncating mutation in exon 
2 or 3 of GATA1 was found, amounting to 10.1% of the pediatric cohort overall (further 
discussed below, Figure 1 and Supplementary Tables 1,3–7).
To determine if these fusion events contribute significantly to gene expression patterns, 
samples with greater than 60% purity were subjected to unsupervised clustering using the 
top 100 most variant genes by standard deviation (Figure 2a,b, Supplementary Tables 8,9). 
Confirming the strength of the fusions in determining gene expression signatures, samples 
clustered according to fusion status; specifically KMT2Ar, HOXr, NUP98-KDM5A, and 
CBFA2T3-GLIS2 cases formed distinct clusters. When analyzing expression of the HOX 
gene cluster, we found upregulation of the HOX gene involved in the fusion construct 
(Supplemental Figure 2a), often accompanied by upregulation of adjacent HOX genes. To 
determine whether this upregulation has downstream effects on HOX protein targets such as 
PIM1, we evaluated expression of a gene set defined by HOXA9 overexpression in 
hematopoietic cells10,11. This demonstrated the highest association for the majority of target 
genes with the HOXr subgroup, providing further evidence of a HOX gene expression 
signature (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure 2b). Combined with KMT2Ar and NUP98-
KDM5A, chimeric oncogenes known to upregulate HOX cluster genes, roughly half of 
pediatric non-DS-AMKL patients carry a HOX gene expression program. These cases were 
distinct from those carrying the cryptic CBFA2T3-GLIS2 inversion which clustered away 
from all other non-DS-AMKL, as previously shown5.
In addition to RNAseq data, 68 pediatric patients had DNA available for whole exome 
sequencing (WES), of which 30 had paired germline material (Supplementary Tables 1–2, 
5). To identify single nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events (SNV/Indels) in cases 
lacking WES, RNAseq data was also interrogated for these mutational events 
(Supplementary Table 5). To identify high confidence somatic calls, unpaired samples

 underwent a rigorous filtering process as described in the online methods (Supplementary 
Figures 3,4 and Supplementary Tables 6,7). Of 83 pediatric cases at diagnosis for which 
SNV/Indel analysis was available, the most highly recurrent mutations occurred in GATA1 
(13.3%), JAK kinase or STAT genes (16.9%), Cohesin or CTCF genes (18.1%), and RAS 
pathway genes (15.7%) (Figure 3a, Supplementary Tables 1,5,6). Additionally, 18.1% of 
patients carried mutations in a cytokine receptor gene, the most frequent of which was the 
thrombopoietin receptor MPL (n=11) that plays a role in normal megakaryoblast growth and 
survival12. In contrast, in the adult cohort (n=24) which lacked recurrent fusion genes, the 
most highly recurrent mutations were in TP53 (20.8%), cohesin genes (16.7%), splicing 
factor genes (16.7%), ASXL genes (16.7%) and DNMT3A (12.5%) (Supplementary Table 
7). Paired exome specimens and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were 
available in 40 specimens for copy number alterations analysis to identify additional 
cooperating mutations (Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 10). The tumor suppressor RB1 
gene was found to be recurrently targeted with focal deletion events (Supplementary Table 
11). Combined with SNV/Indels and structural variations, RB1 mutational events occurred 
in 14.3% of the pediatric cohort and 8.3% of the adult cohort. Confirming previous reports, 
gains in chromosome 19 and 21 were also recurrent in the pediatric cohort as determined by 
WES and/or cytogenetics in 24% and 39.2% of cases, respectively (Supplementary Tables 
1,10)13,14.
Of the ten cases carrying GATA1 truncating mutations in the pediatric cohort, 
(Supplementary Table 12), none had physical stigmata consistent with DS. Karyotypes were 
available for all patients and found to be negative for constitutional trisomy 21. Four 
pediatric cases had matched germline available with an average coverage of 110X. With the 
exception of one case that had evidence of low level tumor contamination in the germline 
specimen, GATA1 mutant calls were absent from these remission samples, including a case 
with 160X coverage, arguing against mosaicism in the hematopoietic compartment of these 
patients. One patient had non-hematopoietic tissue available for analysis and was found to 
be germline mosaic for trisomy 21 (Supplementary Table 12)15. The strong association of 
GATA1 truncations in DS patients suggests cooperativity between amplification of the Down 
syndrome critical region (DSCR) on chromosome 21 and the GATA1 mutant. We therefore 
evaluated cases for amplification of the DSCR using SNP arrays and exome read depth in 
paired samples. Nine of ten GATA1 mutant cases had amplifications in the DSCR 
(Supplementary Table 12). In all cases, GATA1 mutations and chromosome 21 
amplifications were in the major clone and thus the order of acquisition could not be 
determined (Supplementary Table 12). Across the entire cohort, amplifications of 
chromosome 21 were found to be one of the most highly recurrent copy number alterations 
(39.2% overall; Figure 3b, Supplementary Tables 1,10). Candidate genes in this region that 
play a role in megakaryopoiesis include UBASH3A, LINC00478/MONC, DYRK1A, and 
ERG among others16–20. GATA1 mutant cases comprised a distinct subset at the gene 
expression level (Figure 2a,b), and this signature was strongly correlated with that found in 
DS-AMKL (Supplementary Figure 5a). Confirming cooperativity with chromosome 21, the 
GATA1 mutant subset significantly overexpressed chromosome 21 genes, even in 
comparison to other samples carrying extra copies of this chromosome (Supplementary 
Figure 5b and Table 13). Combined with RNA-seq data, this led us to divide our cohort into

 seven subsets based on genomic lesions for further analysis: CBFA2T3-GLIS2, RBM15-
MKL1, NUP98-KDM5A, KMT2Ar, HOXr, GATA1, and “Other” which is a subset 
comprised of cases not falling into any of the aforementioned categories (Figure 1).
Cooperating mutations as identified by WES and SNP arrays revealed a significant 
association between subgroups and recurrent mutations (p=2.8×10−8, global test) (Figure 3c, 
Supplementary Table 14)21. NUP98-KDM5A cases carried mutations in RB1 almost without 
exception and demonstrated a decrease in expression of this gene (Supplementary Figure 6 
and Table 11); KMT2Ar often associated with RAS pathway lesions as has been previously 
described (p=0.09 for enrichment, Fisher’s exact test) while JAK pathway and cohesin 
mutations were commonly identified in GATA1 mutant cases (p=0.003 and p=0.04 
respectively)22,23. HOXr cases were found to be significantly enriched in activating MPL 
mutations (p=0.01). To further evaluate the functional consequences of HOXr and MPL 
mutations, we introduced the wild type MPL gene or one of two MPL mutations along with 
a HOXr into murine bone marrow for colony forming assays (Supplementary Figure 7a). 
Expression of both a HOXr and either wild type or mutant MPL failed to alter colony 
numbers or immunophenotype (Supplementary Figure 7a and data not shown). When cells 
were removed from cytokine containing media, however, a growth advantage was identified 
in cells containing both a HOXr and a MPL mutation (Supplementary Figure 7b). Activated 
JAK-STAT signaling as determined by phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT5 was found in HOXr 
cells containing a MPL mutation in contrast to wild type MPL or empty vector, providing 
one mechanism for this growth advantage (Supplementary Figure 8).
Clinical outcomes for DS-AMKL are uniformly excellent, whereas studies on non-DS-
AMKL have shown discrepant results, with the majority reporting inferior survival rates 
compared to other AML subtypes2,3,24–26. Furthermore, the recommendation for allogeneic 
stem cell transplant (SCT) in first complete remission for non-DS-AMKL patients is not 
uniform among pediatric cooperative groups. To understand the association between 
genomic subgroups and patient outcome in pediatric non-DS-AMKL, we first utilized the 
global test to evaluate if the subgroups correlated with different probabilities of survival. 
Overall survival (pOS) did not differ statistically between patients treated across continents 
(p=0.8; data not shown). We observed statistically significant associations with CBFA2T3-
GLIS2, which carries the strongest negative association, and GATA1 mutant cases which 
carry the strongest positive association (p=1.7×10−5 for pOS, p=3.4×10−5 for event free 
survival (pEFS), see Supplementary Figure 9)21. Kaplan-Meier estimates of pOS, pEFS, and 
cumulative incidence of relapse or primary resistance (pCIR, pgray=1.4×10−4) confirmed this 
trend (Figure 4a–c, Supplementary Table 15). Specifically, CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and KMT2Ar 
were found to have significantly inferior pEFS and pOS. NUP98-KDM5A cases also 
demonstrated a trend towards poor outcomes, however due to small numbers this failed to 
reach statistical significance. Conversely, GATA1 and HOXr subgroups carried significantly 
superior outcomes. Of note, all GATA1 mutant cases that lacked a fusion gene were cured, 
mimicking the excellent outcomes observed in DS-AMKL24. Hence these patients are not 
only biologically but also clinically similar, suggesting that they may benefit from the less 
intensive chemotherapy regimens given to DS-AMKL patients15,27. In contrast, the two 
patients carrying a GATA1 mutation and a poor prognosis fusion gene were non-survivors. 
Based on these results, we recommend all pediatric non-DS-AMKL patients be tested for the

 presence of GATA1 mutations, CBFA2T3-GLIS2, KMT2Ar, and NUP98-KDM5A. 
Chimeric oncogenes that define two of these subsets, CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and NUP98-
KDM5A, are missed by conventional karyotyping and therefore require split-signal FISH or 
RT-PCR for detection. Although SCT was not associated with improved pEFS or pOS, a 
decrease in relapsed free survival (RFS) was found for those patients receiving this treatment 
modality (HR 0.28 p=0.044 see Supplementary Table 16). Therefore patients carrying 
CBFA2T3-GLIS2 or KMT2Ar that have inferior outcomes may benefit from allogeneic SCT 
in first complete remission. While NUP98-KDM5A outcomes did not reach statistical 
significance, their pEFS and pOS warrant close monitoring and consideration of allogeneic 
SCT as well. In contrast, patients lacking these lesions have outcomes on par with or 
superior to other subtypes of pediatric AML and transplant in first remission should be 
reserved for those showing a poor response to induction therapy (e.g. high levels of minimal 
residual disease).
In summary, pediatric non-DS-AMKL is a heterogeneous malignancy comprised of distinct 
subsets as defined by next generation sequencing with varying outcomes. We have identified 
a previously unrecognized subtype characterized by diverse rearrangements in the HOX loci 
that share similar gene expression signatures, cooperating mutations, and clinical outcomes. 
Identification of key genomic events in newly diagnosed non-DS-AMKL patients is 
important for risk stratification as these lesions have therapeutic implications. Allogeneic 
SCT in first complete remission should be considered for patients carrying a poor prognosis 
fusion event including CBFA2T3-GLIS2, KMT2Ar, and NUP98-KDM5A.
ONLINE METHODS
Patient Samples—Specimens were provided from multiple institutions. All samples were 
obtained with patient or parent/guardian provided informed consent under protocols 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution. Samples were deidentified 
prior to nucleic acid extraction and analysis.
Next Generation Sequencing—RNA and DNA library construction for RNA and whole 
exome DNA sequencing were done as per manufacturer’s instructions using the Illumina 
True-seq RNA sample preparation V2 and Nextera rapid capture exome kits, respectively. 
Sequencing was completed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 as per manufacturer’s instructions. 
Analysis of RNA and whole-exome sequencing data which includes mapping, coverage and 
quality assessment, SNV/Indel detection, tier annotation for sequence mutations, and 
prediction of deleterious effects of missense mutations have been described previously5,28. 
Open reading frames predictions of fusion transcripts detected by RNAseq were validated by 
RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the purified PCR products.
Exome Filtering—To identify high confidence somatic calls, unpaired samples underwent 
a vigorous filtering process including the removal of low quality calls and known 
polymorphisms. Rare variants (defined as a mutant allele frequency of <0.1% in the non-
cancer NHLBI ESP cohort) were retained for further analysis. Known recurrent somatic 
variants present in the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer database (COSMIC) were 
designated as high confidence lesions. Remaining calls were evaluated by damage-

 prediction algorithms. Those with mutations occurring in a conserved domain of a cancer 
consensus gene and predicted to be damaging were designated as intermediate confidence 
lesions.
Gene Expression Analysis—Transcript expression levels were estimated as Fragments 
Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped fragments (FPKM); gene FPKMs were 
computed by summing the transcript FPKMs for each gene using Cuffdiff229,30. A gene was 
considered “expressed” if the FPKM value was >= 0.35 based on the distribution of FPKM 
values. Genes that were not expressed in any sample group were excluded from the 
downstream analysis. Hierarchical clustering and t-SNE were performed using the top 100 
most variant genes. Prior to the analysis we excluded sex specific genes, sno, miRNAs and 
genes whose expression are correlated with inflammatory responses (see Supplementary 
Table 11).
All statistical analyses were performed in R statistical environment.
Unsupervised clustering: Expression levels of genes were estimated as Fragments Per 
Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped fragments (FPKM); FPKMs were computed by 
summing the transcript FPKMs for each gene using Cuffdiff229,30. A gene was considered 
“expressed” if the FPKM value was ≥ 0.35 based on the distribution of FPKM gene 
expression levels. Genes that were not expressed in any sample group were excluded from 
the final data matrix for downstream analysis (log2 FKBM value −1.514573) leaving 18905 
genes. To avoid disturbances from gene expression from normal bone marrow cells and 
based on the distribution of tumor purity, samples were included with a blast count 
percentage of >60%. To further eliminate contaminating gene expression, technical replicas 
from a sample which was either blast cell purified (SJAMLM7010964_D1, blast percentage 
93%) or unpurified (SJAMLM7010964_D1, blast percentage 78%) were compared and 
genes with high expression in the unpurified sample (n = 25) only were eliminated 
(Supplementary Table 11). In addition sex specific genes (n = 41) and small RNA encoding 
genes (n = 279) were removed. The latter to remove variance based on RNA extraction 
protocol (Supplementary Table 11). The final data matrix is composed of 48 samples and 
18563 genes. We performed hierarchical clustering (HC) using the top 100 most variant 
genes (Supplementary Table 12). A HC tree, with Spearman correlation as distance metric 
and Ward linkage, was constructed. The distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding 
method implemented in the R-package tSNE was used to visualize the similarities between 
samples in two-dimensional space.
Analysis of chromosome 21 expression levels: Genes on chr21 (chr21) and those not on 
chr21 (non-chr21) were first saved. Lowly expressed genes (mean log2 FKBM value <= −1) 
were removed. For each gene mean expression levels in AMKL subgroups were calculated, 
and subsequently log fold changes between chr21 and non-chr21 were determined. P value 
was calculated using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Chr21 amplification status was derived from 
karyotype and/or CNV data. Differential chr21 gene expression between the non-DS 
GATA1s subgroup samples (n=5, all carrying one or more extra copies of chr21) and other 
non-DS AMKL samples with one or more extra copies of chr21 (n=13) (Supplementary 
Table 13) was performed on RNAseq count data using the R-package edgeR. Similar

 filtering was performed, i.e. genes with a count per million value of > 2 across >= 4 samples 
included.
Comparison of gene expression in DS and Non-DS AMKL: DS-AMKL logFC gene 
expression data was taken from Klusmann et al31. Subgroup-specific RNA expression in 
non-DS-AMKL was calculated using RNAseq count data aggregated on genes from samples 
from unique patients with a blast count > 60%, comparing each subgroup against all others 
using the R-package edgeR32. Prior to the analysis, sex-specific genes were removed. Data 
were merged and aggregated on gene symbol and gene expression values. Finally, most 
significantly differentially expressed genes in both data sets (FDR < 0.2) were correlated.
Association of gene expression with HOXA9 target genes: First, up-regulated targets of 
HOXA9 were taken from Dorsam et al10. Then, association between the expression values 
of these genes, with the exception of those that were not expressed in either sample, and 
AMKL subgroups was quantified using the global test, where group label were used as 
response variable.
Associations of AMKL subgroups with cooperating mutations—High confidence 
SNVs/Indels from the initial diagnostic samples excluding mutations in GATA1 were 
combined with structural alterations excluding those identifying genomic subgroups were 
subjected to mutational frequency analysis (see Supplementary Tables 4, 6, 9, and 15). One 
hypermutated sample (SJAMLM7060_D) was excluded from this analysis. Genes mutated 
in >4 cases (RB1, MPL, CTCF, JAK2 and NRAS) were identified. Based on these five 
genes, five non-overlapping proximal gene sets were constructed from mutated genes, 
covering 44% of identified cooperating mutations. Global association with AMKL subgroup 
was calculated using the global test21. Enrichment of gene set mutations in AMKL 
subgroups was determined by one-sided Fisher’s exact tests. The Circos plot was 
constructed using Martin Krzywinski’s table viewer (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer/).
Colony Forming Assay—All experiments involving mice were reviewed and approved 
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Bone marrow from 4–6 week old 
female C57BL/6 mice was harvested, lineage depleted, and cultured in the presence of 
recombinant murine SCF (rmSCF, Peprotech, 50ng/ml), IL-3 (rmIL3, Peprotech, 50ng/ml), 
and IL-6 (rmIL6, Peprotech, 50ng/ml) for 24 hours prior to transduction on RetroNectin 
(Takara Bio Inc.) coated plates. Cultured supernatants containing ecotropic envelope 
pseudotyped retroviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells as 
previously described33. Murine bone marrow cells were harvested 48 hours following 
transduction, sorted for vector-encoded mCherry or GFP expression, and plated on 
methylcellulose containing IL-3, IL-6, SCF and erythropoietin (EPO) (Stem Cell 
technologies, Vancouver, BC) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Colonies were counted 
after 7 days of growth at 37°C, harvested and serially replated.
Affymetrix SNP Arrays—Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array genotyping was performed for 14 of 
15 AMKL cases in the discovery cohort, and array normalization and DNA copy number 
alterations identified as previously described34–37. To differentiate inherited copy number 
alterations from somatic events in leukaemia blasts from patient’s lacking matched normal

 DNA, identified putative variants were filtered using public copy number polymorphism 
databases and a St. Jude database of SNP array data from several hundred samples38,39.
Copy Number Alteration Detection Using Whole Exome Sequencing—Samtools 
mpileup command was used to generate an mpileup file from matched normal and tumor 
BAM files with duplicates removed40. VarScan2 was then used to take the mpileup file to 
call somatic CNAs after adjusting for normal/tumor sample read coverage depth and GC 
content41. Circular Binary Segmentation algorithm implemented in the DNAcopy R package 
was used to identify the candidate copy number alterations for each sample37. B-allele 
frequency info for all high quality dbSNPs heterozygous in the germline sample was also 
used to assess allele imbalance.
Western Blot Analysis
Cells transduced with both a fusion gene and a MPL construct were flow sorted and grown 
on cytokine supplemented methylcellulose and serially replaced for three weeks. Cells were 
then harvested and grown in liquid media in the absence of cytokines. 48 hours after 
withdrawal of cytokines cells were harvested, washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer. 
Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by Mini-protean TGX Stain-Free Precast Gel 
(Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies used were Phospho-Jak2 (Tyr1007/1008, clone C80C3, 
catalog# 3776 Cell Signaling Technology), Jak2 (clone D2E12, catalog# 3230 Cell 
Signaling Technology), Phospho-Stat5 (Tyr694, clone C11C5 catalog# 9359 Cell Signaling 
Technology) and Stat5 (catalog# 9363 Cell Signaling Technology). The intensity of the 
detected signals was measured by using Image Lab.
Survival Analysis—Kaplan-Meier curves for probability of overall survival (pOS), event 
free survival (pEFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse or non-response (pCIR) were 
constructed using the R-package survival and IBM SPSS 20.0. Gray’s test statistic and p 
value for CIR were calculated using the cuminc function in the R-package cmprsk. 
Summary statistics for each group are presented in Supplementary Table 15. Events in pEFS 
calculations were defined as relapse, death in remission by any cause, and non-response 
which was included as an event at the date of diagnosis. For pCIR, only relapse and non-
response were included. No significant differences were present in cumulative incidences of 
competing risk (p=0.7). For multi-variant analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model was 
used to obtain the estimates and the 95%-confidence interval of the relative risk for 
prognostic factors. HSCT was included as time-dependent covariable. Computations were 
performed using SAS (Statistical Analysis System Version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Data Availability—Whole exome, RNA–seq and SNP microarray data have been 
deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under accession 
EGAS00001002183.
