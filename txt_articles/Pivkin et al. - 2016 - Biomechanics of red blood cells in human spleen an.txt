Correction for “Biomechanics of red blood cells in human spleen
and consequences for physiology and disease,” by Igor V. Pivkin,
Zhangli Peng, George E. Karniadakis, Pierre A. Buffet, Ming Dao,
and Subra Suresh, which appeared in issue 28, July 12, 2016, of
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (113:7804–7809; first published June 27,
2016; 10.1073/pnas.1606751113).
The authors note that on page 7806, the expression for red
blood cell (RBC) volume (Eq. 3) appeared incorrectly. The correct
exact expression for RBC volume, to be taken within Eq. 8 cor-
responding to the dotted line in Fig. 3, should be given as

In this case, there is no longer a need for Eqs. 5 and 6. The dotted
curve in Fig. 3 was actually plotted with the exact analytical solu-
tion using the correct Eq. 3 above for the RBC volume. All results
presented originally in Fig. 3 are correct with the above Eq. 3.
The authors further note that the originally printed expression
for RBC volume (Eq. 3) on page 7806, in conjunction with the
original Eqs. 5 and 6, should constitute an approximate solution
for RBC volume. After correcting a typo, the correct ap-
proximate expression for RBC volume (Eq. 3) would appear as

Red blood cells (RBCs) can be cleared from circulation when alterations
in their size, shape, and deformability are detected. This function is
modulated by the spleen-specific structure of the interendothelial slit
(IES). Here, we present a unique physiological framework for develop-
ment of prognostic markers in RBC diseases by quantifying biophysical
limits for RBCs to pass through the IES, using computational simula-
tions based on dissipative particle dynamics. The results show that the
spleen selects RBCs for continued circulation based on their geome-
try, consistent with prior in vivo observations. A companion analysis
provides critical bounds relating surface area and volume for healthy
RBCs beyond which the RBCs fail the “physical fitness test” to pass
through the IES, supporting independent experiments. Our results sug-
gest that the spleen plays an important role in determining distribu-
tions of size and shape of healthy RBCs. Because mechanical retention
of infected RBC impacts malaria pathogenesis, we studied key biophys-
ical parameters for RBCs infected with Plasmodium falciparum as they
cross the IES. In agreement with experimental results, surface area loss
of an infected RBC is found to be a more important determinant of
splenic retention than its membrane stiffness. The simulations provide
insights into the effects of pressure gradient across the IES on RBC
retention. By providing quantitative biophysical limits for RBCs to pass
through the IES, the narrowest circulatory bottleneck in the spleen, our
results offer a broad approach for developing quantitative markers for
diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and malaria.
erythrocytes | microcirculation | spleen clearance | malaria | spherocytosis
T
he spleen, about 10–12 cm in length with a mass of 100–200 g
and located in the left superior abdomen, is the largest lym-
phatic organ in the human body (1, 2). The spleen plays a key role
in the human immune system by protecting the body from path-
ogenic microorganisms reaching the bloodstream, through innate
phagocytosis or adaptive responses operated by lymphocytes and
antibodies. The spleen also serves as a filter that can remove red
blood cells (RBCs) from circulation because of either physiological
senescence or pathological alterations.
RBCs can be recognized as altered when changes in their shape,
size, or surface are detected or their deformability is impaired as a
consequence of such changes. Archetypical surface alterations are
externalization of phosphatidyl-serine on the outer leaflet of the
phospholipid bilayer of the RBC membrane or fixation of antibody
on surface antigens, as occurs in transfusion mismatch. Sensing of
these alterations by macrophages can occur all over the body with
strong predominance in the spleen and liver (3). By contrast, rec-
ognition of altered size, shape, and deformability is considered a
spleen-specific function. Surface area loss and reduced deform-
ability also occur during aging of healthy RBCs (4). The arche-
typical disease where mechanical retention of RBCs in the spleen is
the central pathogenic process is hereditary spherocytosis (HS). HS
is a genetic disorder resulting in dysfunctional membrane proteins
that play a role in transforming the shape of the RBC from a
normal discocyte to a sphere. HS occurs at a frequency of 1 in 5,000
births in the Caucasian population and is the most common origin
of hereditary intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. In HS,
defects in band 3, ankyrin and spectrin membrane proteins con-
necting the RBC membrane to the spectrin network can lead to the
vesiculation of unsupported lipid bilayer. Such vesiculation causes a
gradual reduction in cell surface area by as much as 20% compared
with that of a healthy RBC (5). This reduction, in turn, can sig-
nificantly increase the retention rates of RBCs in the spleen be-
cause of their increased sphericity (6). Severe reduction in RBC
deformability attributable to spherocytosis results in the flow of
RBCs to be obstructed as they pass through the spleen (7, 8).
Consequently, the RBCs are phagocytosed causing hemolytic
anemia and splenomegaly (i.e., enlarged spleen). The fact that
surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) alleviates anemia to
a large extent in patients with severe HS lends support to the
argument that recognition of altered deformability of RBCs is a
specific function of the spleen. Increased in vitro mechanical
retention of RBCs collected in splenectomized subjects further
supports this inference (9). RBC deformability is impaired in
several other conditions including thalassemia (10), burns (11),
and Plasmodium falciparum malaria (12). During its 48-h life
cycle, the P. falciparum-infected RBC progressively increases in
stiffness. During the so-called “ring” stage (i.e., within 24 h of
host cell invasion by the parasite), the infected RBCs (iRBCs)
undergo ∼9.6% surface area loss (13) and reduced deformability
arising from up to a fourfold increase in membrane shear
modulus (14). Innate mechanical retention of a proportion of
normally circulating ring-iRBCs has been observed ex vivo in a
Significance
The 3D opening of the interendothelial slit in human spleen
creates a physical fitness test for red blood cells (RBCs) and clears
them from circulation if their geometry and deformability are
altered. We present a unique computational framework for the
development of prognostic markers for diseases that alter RBC
physical characteristics and identify quantitative limits for splenic
slit clearance. Our work shows how the splenic slit determines
distributions of size and shape of healthy RBCs. Our work lays the
groundwork for systematic reconstruction of RBC navigation in
the human spleen with consequences for a variety of acute and
chronic medical conditions associated with hereditary alterations
of RBCs, infectious diseases, and cancers.

 human spleen perfusion system (15) and in vitro (13, 16). The
mechanical retention of iRBCs in the spleen is predicted to
markedly impact the initial evolution of infection (17, 18) and is
exploited in the search for new antimalarial drugs (19). Studies
of iRBCs and human spleen have further validated the notion
that mechanical retention of RBCs is modulated by the spleen-
specific 3D structure of the IES in the red pulp (15).
The spleen is the largest filter of RBCs in the body where the
smallest openings for RBC passage are located (1). Splenic pa-
renchyma is made of white pulp nodules and sheaths—that contain
mainly T and B lymphocytes—interspersed into the red pulp, a
spongy tissue that accounts for 75% of the splenic volume. The red
pulp comprises splenic sinusoids, which are blood vessels juxta-
posed with the connective tissue of splenic cords. About 10% of
blood entering the spleen is directed into so-called open circulation,
where RBCs are forced to go from the cords into venous sinuses
(Fig. 1A). The sinuses consist of a lining of endothelial cells that are
positioned in parallel and connected by stress fibers to annular fi-
bers, which are made up of extracellular matrix components. Fig.
1B illustrates the squeezing of healthy RBCs through the narrow
slits when crossing the sinus wall through the cords to the sinus
lumen. The splenic IES is narrower and shorter than capillaries and
forces RBCs to adopt a dumbbell shape as they pass through (20).
This peculiar, dynamic 3D process has been observed in vivo only in
rodents (21), the spleen of which can be transilluminated, unlike
the human spleen. Detailed studies of the mechanisms involved in
healthy and diseased RBC clearance by the human spleen have
been hampered by two factors (16). (i) The human spleen displays
anatomical and physiological features not observed in murine
models. (ii) Because of the risk of potentially life-threatening in-
traperitoneal bleeding following any invasive exploration, the hu-
man spleen is not readily amenable to in vivo investigation by
recourse to such techniques as spleen biopsy or needle aspiration.
As a result, there is a critical need for studies that explore the
biomechanical filtering unit of the human spleen through detailed
computational simulations and modeling. Simulations using a
boundary integral method have been carried out recently to
study how RBCs pass through spleen-like slits and the effects of
RBC flow rate and cytosol viscosity (22). However, our current
knowledge of the biomechanics of the spleen is far from complete.
Studies of blood samples collected from healthy human sub-
jects demonstrated (23) that the volume and the surface area of
healthy RBCs have a linear relationship to each other. To ra-
tionalize this observation using simple geometric considerations,
it has been proposed (23) that for an RBC to squeeze through an
infinitely long tube of the smallest constant diameter (an ideal-
ized representation of a capillary in microcirculation), it should
assume an optimal “cigar” shape. This postulate leads to the
requirement that the surface area and volume are mutually de-
pendent parameters. Based on this theory, the smallest diameter
of the capillary that 95% of healthy human RBCs can traverse
was estimated to be about 3.7 μm (23). For a small number of HS
patients who had undergone splenectomy, the minimum capil-
lary diameter for RBC traversal shifted significantly to greater
values (23), and many RBCs that could not pass through the
restriction of a cylindrical tube of 3.7 μm in diameter were pre-
sent in blood samples. This finding [albeit considered in-
conclusive by the authors of that study (23) because of the
limited number of reliable data points] led to the inference that
the spleen might play a significant role in defining the distribu-
tions of the size and shapes of healthy RBCs in circulation. No
physical mechanisms have been proposed to date to rationalize
this hypothesis. As a result, the specific role of the spleen in
defining the size and shape distributions of RBCs in circulation
has also remained an open topic for the past several decades.
Basic research into the biophysical function of the human spleen
as well as into the mechanics of how cells undergo splenic
clearance in health and disease inevitably calls for a better un-
derstanding of the answers to the following questions. How do
variations in mechanical and physical properties due to age,
disease, or genetic mutation affect the ability of an RBC to pass
the “physical fitness test” in the human spleen? What pressure
differences exist across the sinus slit in the human spleen, and how
does this pressure gradient influence the clearance of healthy and
diseased RBCs? Does the spleen play a role in defining and de-
termining the distributions in size and shape of RBCs? If so, what
are the quantitative descriptions of critical conditions for this ef-
fect? By applying the latest computational simulation tools,
what new insights could be gained about the ability of an RBC to
navigate through the IES as a function of different geometrical
parameters as well as those altered by different disease states?
We have developed computational models that benefit from
ex vivo experiments of passage and trapping of healthy RBCs and
P. falciparum-invaded iRBCs in the human spleen (16) as well as
from similar experiments performed on a synthetic spleen (20). In
addition, ultrastructural characterization of the human spleen in
the transmission electron microscope (TEM) in the latter study has
provided high-resolution information of the spleen geometry, which
is helpful in framing our theoretical analyses and spleen simulations.
We use the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) computational
simulation technique (24) to consider a wide range of fluid–
structure interactions as RBCs pass through the IES in human spleen,
by including detailed molecular-level models of RBC membranes
in splenic passage (25). In addition, we also develop an analytical

central arterioles and their branches and then through the perifollicular
zone (PFZ), PFZ-to-sinus bypasses, sinus lumens, and post-sinus venules that
converge in the splenic vein, which consists of 80–90% of the splenic blood
flow. The open and slow circulation through the red pulp involves (i) a mi-
crocirculatory structure without endothelial cells where cord macrophages
(MPs) and reticular cells screen the slowly traversing blood cells and
(ii) narrow and short IES in the sinus wall that RBCs must cross to go back to
the general circulation. Less deformable RBCs retained mechanically by the
IES and abnormal RBCs identified can be removed through phagocytosis by
macrophages (MPs) or dendritic cells (DCs). (B) Computational model ge-

Results and Discussion
Computational Framework. We use the DPD-based RBC model (25,
26) for simulations. The details can be found in Methods and SI Text.
Fig. 1A is a schematic illustration of a venous sinus located in the
cords in the red pulp of the human spleen. The sinuses comprise
aligned endothelial cells that are connected by stress fibers to annular
fibers. From such geometrical considerations and from detailed
structural studies of the sinus wall in the TEM (20), we constructed
the computational model for RBC traversal through the IES (Fig.
1B). The average height of the slits, Hs ∼ 0.65 μm with a range from
0.25 to 1.2 μm and an SD of 0.5 μm, and average length (the thickness
of the slit wall) Ls ∼ 1.89 μm with a range from 0.9 to 3.2 μm and an
SD of 0.9 μm. The width of the slit Ws ∼ 2–3 μm and the stress fiber
width Wf ∼ 1 μm (27). Unless otherwise noted, we use the following
reference geometry of the IES for all simulations in this study: height
Hs = 1.2 μm, width Ws = 4.0 μm, and length Ls = 1.89 μm. The stress
fiber width is Wf = 1 μm. These geometrical parameters were chosen
from the upper bound value for slit height from TEM ultrastructural
characterization experiments (20) for two reasons. First, because of
the observation angle, the IES dimensions measured experimentally
might have been underestimated. Second, the actual IES opening
shape is not a rectangle with sharp corners. The opening is likely
closer to an elongated ellipse, and the cross-section observed in the
experiment might not exceed the maximum dimension in the height
direction. Note that the effective stiffness of endothelial cells is ∼100
times higher than that of RBCs (28); the slit walls were thus modeled
as rigid side walls of circular cylinders, comprising endothelial cells,
and thin slabs, representing annular stress fibers (Fig. 1B).
Analytical Framework. A simplified axisymmetric model amenable
to theoretical analysis is first considered here (Fig. 2) to elucidate the
effects of geometric constraints on RBC–IES interactions, which are
further taken up for much more detailed investigation in our com-
putational simulations that relax many of these geometric constraints.
We assume that the slit cross-section in the y-z plane is circular
(Fig. 2) instead of rectangular (Fig. 1B), but with the same cross-
sectional area such that

The 3D slit geometry (Fig. 1B) is therefore approximated by the
surface of a torus (Fig. 2). The deformed RBC at the critical
condition consists of three parts: two spherical balls connected by
a central connecting part (torus). The area and volume of the

Comparison with Experiments. The bounds predicted by the fore-
going analysis can be compared with experimental observations
in the literature (23) as well as with our computational simulations.
These comparisons benefit from further insights gained through ex
vivo experiments performed on isolated perfused human spleen
(16) as well as on a synthetic spleen comprising a microsphere fil-
tration system (20). The latter work suggests that the geometric
characteristics obtained from spleen experiments could be re-
capitulated using micrometer-sized metal spheres. The microsphere
filtration device was designed based on the observed slit shape and
dimensions, with a 5-mm-thick layer of mixture of spheres, 5 to
15 μm in diameter. The pressure difference in the experiments
where the RBC suspension was pushed through the device was held
at 63.2 cm H2O, giving an average pressure gradient of 1 Pa/μm
inside the filter (20). These experiments reveal that RBCs with

 abnormal properties were selectively retained by the microsphere
filter with retention rates similar to those observed ex vivo in the
isolated perfused human spleen (16). The experiments also guide
the choice of critical pressure gradient required for the RBC to pass
splenic slits.
These experimental results (16, 20) directly verify the mechanical
sensing of RBCs by the human spleen. The results further suggest
that the microsphere filter provides a mechanically equivalent sys-
tem to the human spleen, by recourse to which controlled experi-
ments could be performed to quantify the mechanics of the spleen
in a manner that is not possible in the human spleen. Such exper-
iments reveal that retention of abnormal RBCs is based mainly on
their mechanical properties even without any ligand–receptor in-
teractions between RBCs and splenic structures (20).
Volume–Area Relationship of Healthy RBC Population for IES Clearance.
The size distribution of RBCs present in healthy human subjects is
quite broad, with cell surface area varying from 80 to 180 μm2 and
volume varying from 60 to 160 μm3, as shown in Fig. 3. A pressure
gradient of 1.0 Pa/μm has been estimated from microsphere exper-
iments and companion isolated perfused human spleen studies
(6, 13, 20) to be sufficient for RBCs of all sizes found in blood to pass
through the IES. To compare our analysis with the experimental
data, we performed DPD simulations of the passage of healthy
RBCs of different size through the IES at a fixed pressure gradient
of 1.0 Pa/μm. For each RBC surface area, we found the critical RBC
volume below which cells can fully clear the IES, whereas the IES
crossing of cells with larger volume is obstructed.
The simulation results are summarized by the solid line shown
in Fig. 3, indicating the maximum RBC volume as a function of
RBC surface area. Here, RBCs with surface area and volume
located on the plot to the right of this solid line would fail to pass
through the interendothelial slits, and therefore these RBCs
would not be present in blood circulation. The predictions of our
analytical model, Eq. 8, are also indicated in Fig. 3 by the dashed
line. The critical conditions predicted by the analysis for the
RBC volume–area relationship for IES clearance match com-
putational simulations. The results also confirm that all RBCs
present in the blood of healthy subjects are able to pass through
the human spleen. The theoretical and simulation results shown
by the solid and dashed lines also bound the experimental data
points for the healthy RBC volume versus surface area (23). The
simulation results are also consistent with more recent data (29)
obtained with a high-throughput device consisting of thousands
of parallel microchannels to measure the RBC surface area and
volume. These findings suggest that the spleen plays an impor-
tant role in defining the size of the RBCs in human circulation.
Less than 3% RBCs measured in ref. 23 are found slightly below
our predicted limit (the solid or dashed line). These RBCs are
relatively small in volume and surface area; they are likely to be
older and stiffer cells (30). These outlier RBCs could be pushed
through the IES because of local pressure variation (higher
pressure) or IES size variation (larger IES size) in the spleen.
Alternatively, these senescent cells may reflect a small compo-
nent that just reached the physical limits triggering retention but
has not yet been directed to the filtering beds of the spleen.
Splenic Slit Clearance of RBCs Parasitized by P. falciparum. We first
simulate the crossing of the IES in human spleen of ring-stage
iRBCs, which we model with average properties of ring-stage
populations, with a cell volume of 94 μm3 and a surface area of
122 μm2 (13). The membrane shear modulus of 15.5 pN/μm was
chosen from three independent experiments involving membrane
flickering and microfluidics (31–33). We applied a fixed pressure
gradient in each simulation to force the iRBC to cross the slit
opening. By decreasing the pressure gradient in successive simu-
lations, the critical condition for obstruction of ring-stage iRBCs in
the IES was identified. The RBC model used in our DPD simu-
lations has been extensively calibrated with systematic experiments
on parasitized iRBCs in microfluidic devices (32, 33).
We begin with a DPD simulation of an iRBC with a fixed surface
area of 122 μm2. In order for this iRBC to completely squeeze
through the IES, the critical pressure gradient required was
1.42 Pa/μm. We then allowed for up to a 7% increase of the
RBC surface area during IES crossing to account for the fact that the
surface area of the RBC membrane changes during large de-
formation of the cell. With this increased surface area, the critical
pressure gradient required for traversing the IES was reduced to
0.64 Pa/μm. Typical values of membrane area increase reported in
the literature are about 2–4% (34), depending on the type of de-
formation and stress state. Precise values of area change during the
RBC traversal through the spleen are not known, and hence the two
cases considered here represent, to some degree, extreme conditions.
Fig. 4 comprises a sequence of six images showing a ring-stage
iRBC as it clears a splenic slit under a critical pressure gradient
0.64 Pa/μm (also see Movie S1). The color contours show the
fractional local surface area change of the composite layer com-
prising the membrane and the spectrin network cytoskeleton. Movie S1
also reveals that there can be considerable time delay for the
iRBC to traverse the slit upon application of critical pressure gra-
dient. If the pressure gradient is increased, the RBC traversal time is
reduced. If we assume that the increase in typical membrane area

DPD simulation of a sequence of six steps (A–F) as an iRBC parasitized
by P. falciparum passes through a slit in the human spleen at a constant pres-
sure gradient of 0.64 Pa/μm. During this large deformation process, the iRBC is
allowed to have a change up to 7% in total surface area from its undeformed
value of 122 μm2. Only one-half of the RBC is shown for clarity and visualization.
The color contours show local values of the ratio of the deformed to un-
deformed surface area of the RBC membrane. Here, area expansion occurs for
values >1.0, whereas compression occurs for values <1.0.

 for the cell of about 2–4%, the critical pressure gradient in the
spleen would be predicted, from our DPD simulations, to be be-
tween 1.42 and 0.64 Pa/μm. This value is close to 1.0 Pa/μm, derived
from the microsphere filtration experiments, which were also com-
pared with those from isolated perfused spleen experiments (13,
20). Under this pressure gradient of 1.0 Pa/μm, the retention rate
in the spleen of ring-stage iRBCs was about 50%, which implies
that this pressure gradient was the critical value for an average
ring-stage iRBC to pass through the splenic slit.
Effects of Cell Surface Area and Stiffness. We now consider healthy,
ring-, and trophozoite-stage RBCs invaded by P. falciparum
merozoites; the surface area of the RBCs in these three cases,
respectively, was taken to be 135, 122.04, and 115.83 μm2 (13),
and the respective values of the membrane shear modulus were
5.5, 15.5, and 28.9 pN/μm (31). The cell volume was taken to be
94 μm3 for all three cases. For ring and trophozoite cells, with
intracellular parasite maturation over 6–24 and 24–36 h, re-
spectively, we performed three simulations: (i) only stiffness
change was considered, (ii) only surface area change was con-
sidered, and (iii) both stiffness change and surface area change
were considered. By changing the magnitude of the pressure
gradient, we identified the critical, minimum pressure gradient
necessary for the cells to pass through the slit, as shown in Fig. 5.
The simulation results show that the surface area loss arising
from RBC parasitization plays a much more important role than
the ensuing stiffness increase. There is a significant increase in
the critical pressure gradient from the ring to trophozoite stage.
For trophozoite, no RBC passed the IES opening even for very
high values of applied pressure gradient, if an area loss of 14.2%
is considered. Therefore, we used area loss of 11.9% for tro-
phozoite, which is the midpoint between the ring and trophozoite
stages and can be considered as young trophozoite (35).
The blue vertical dashed line in Fig. 5 shows the theoretical
prediction, Eq. 8, of the maximum area loss allowed for RBCs (at
the fixed cell volume) to pass the circular opening with the same
surface area as that considered in the DPD simulations. In phys-
ical terms, our theory indicates that cells with larger surface area
loss than this critical value (at a fixed volume) will require an
infinitely large pressure gradient for RBC passage; this prediction
is consistent with the results of the computational simulations.
Effects of Cell Volume. Finally, we investigate how the cell volume
influences the critical pressure gradient for RBCs to pass through the
splenic slit. For these studies, we focus on the ring-stage iRBCs with
a surface area of 122 μm2 and a membrane shear modulus of
15.5 pN/μm. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the cell volume, for a fixed cell
surface area, on the critical minimum pressure gradient for passage
through the IES. The critical pressure gradient steeply increases as
the change in the RBC volume approaches 20%. Cells with larger
volumes were not able to clear the slit in our DPD simulations.
The blue dashed vertical line in Fig. 6 shows the maximum
volume increase predicted by our theory for the RBC to clear the
circular opening, with the same cell surface area as that con-
sidered in the DPD simulations. The theory predicts a maximum
value of 19% volume increase (113 μm3) for a standard healthy
cell (95 μm3), beyond which the minimum pressure gradient nec-
essary to clear the slit becomes too large. The simulation results
(red solid line) are seen to be in agreement with this axisymmetric
theory. Hence, the analytical theory could serve as a rough guide
for defining the critical RBC geometry in the limiting case.
Conclusions
We have developed computational simulations, coupled with a
theoretical analysis, of the mechanics of RBC clearance by the
spleen. We have generated a unique quantitative framework for
RBCs crossing a narrow slit in the spleen, a process that cannot
be dynamically observed in humans. Shape deformation during
this most stringent biomechanical challenge on RBCs in circu-
lation (20) appeared very different from the bullet-shaped de-
formation of RBCs in narrow capillaries (36). Our analyses and
simulations provide limiting conditions of surface area and vol-
ume beyond which healthy RBCs can cross the spleen; these pre-
dictions are in agreement with the distributions of size and
shape of healthy RBCs observed in circulation (Fig. 3). These
results are also consistent with independent experimental re-
sults obtained by challenging human spleens with human
RBCs modified either artificially (6) or by infection with the
intraerythrocytic parasite P. falciparum (13). The present com-
putations do not fully account for the interactions between the
lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton, which will inevitably require
a more computationally expensive, two-component model. The
computations also do not consider the effects of intrinsic stiffness
of the membrane–cytoskeleton complex and viscosity of the cy-
toplasm on RBC passage through the splenic slits. However, as
previously observed experimentally (6) and predicted here (Fig. 3),
the surface to volume ratio is by far the most important parameter
of RBC deformability.

 Taken together, these results provide a robustly validated
quantitative framework on how the human spleen plays its bio-
mechanical filtering role that contributes to the quality assurance of
circulating RBCs. This framework opens unique pathways for the
use of quantitative morphological features of circulating RBC—
now rapidly obtained by imaging flow cytometry (6, 37)—as markers
of hyposplenism in patients with suspected inherited or acquired
splenic dysfunction, a condition associated with severe infectious,
circulatory, and proliferative complications (38). In addition to
splenectomized patients (38), hyposplenism affects a majority of
children with sickle-cell disease (39) and patients suffering from an
array of acute or chronic medical conditions (40), such as celiac
disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, cirrhosis, and viral or bacte-
rial infections. More precise estimates of splenic function would
guide patient management for an optimal adaptation of antimicro-
bial prophylaxis (41) and prevention of thrombotic events (42).
Several conditions, such as malaria, thalassemia, or severe hema-
tological diseases (leukemia and lymphomas), induce enlargement
of the spleen with subsequent propensity to filter not only abnormal
cells but also healthy RBCs (43), thus causing anemia. Our approach
forms the first step of a potential systematic reconstruction of the
navigation of RBCs in the human spleen across narrow slits but also
upstream and downstream from this unique circulatory bottleneck.
Methods
RBC Model. The details of the DPD based RBC model can be found in SI Text,
RBC Model.
Ex Vivo and Synthetic Spleen Studies and Structural Characterization. Clinical
interventions associated with left splenopancreatectomy for benign tumors
of the pancreas (16) have led to ex vivo experiments in isolated human spleen
perfused with healthy RBCs, iRBCs invaded by P. falciparum, as well as chemically
treated RBCs with controlled surface area loss (6, 13, 16, 20). Geometric char-
acteristics of RBC interactions and trapping from ex vivo human spleen have also
been replicated using a “synthetic spleen” made of metal spheres (20). These
studies showed that the retention of abnormal RBCs was influenced pre-
dominantly by their mechanical properties and that these effects could occur in
the absence of ligand–receptor interactions between RBCs and the relevant
splenic structures. Additional discussions are included in SI Text, Ex Vivo and
Synthetic Spleen Studies and Structural Characterization.
DPD Method. The DPD method invokes a coarse-grained molecular dynamics
approach, further details of which are described in SI Text, DPD Model and
Scaling of Physical Units.
