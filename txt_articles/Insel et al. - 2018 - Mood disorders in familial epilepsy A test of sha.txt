SUMMARY
Objective—Mood disorders are the most common comorbid conditions in epilepsy but the cause 
remains unclear. One possible explanation is a shared genetic susceptibility to epilepsy and mood 
disorders. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in 
relatives with and without epilepsy in families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy, and 
comparing the findings with rates from a general population sample.
Methods—The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was administered to 192 
individuals from 60 families, including 110 participants with epilepsy of unknown cause (50 focal 
epilepsy [FE], 42 generalized epilepsy [GE], 6 FE and GE, 12 unclassifiable) and 82 relatives 
without epilepsy (RWOE).
Odds ratios (ORs) for lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in participants with vs. without 
epilepsy were computed through logistic regression, using generalized estimation equations to 
account for familial clustering. Standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs) were used to compare 
prevalence in family members with general population rates.
Results—Compared with RWOE, ORs for mood disorders were significantly increased in 
participants with FE (OR = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 5.2) but not in those with GE 
(OR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.4, 2.2). In addition, prevalence of mood disorders was increased in 
individuals with epilepsy who had ≥1 relative with FE. Compared with general population rates,

 mood disorders were significantly increased in individuals with FE but not in those with GE. Rates 
were also increased in RWOE, but not significantly so (SPR 1.4, p=0.14).
Significance—These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of shared genetic susceptibility 
to epilepsy and mood disorders, but suggest (1) the effect may be restricted to FE, and (2) the 
shared genetic effect on risk of mood disorders and epilepsy may be restricted to individuals with 
epilepsy, i.e., to those in which the genetic risk for epilepsy is “penetrant.”

INTRODUCTION
Mood disorders, including depression, are the most common comorbid conditions in 
epilepsy,1; 2 and impose substantial burdens including reduced quality of life, increased 
disability and healthcare utilization3 and heightened risk for suicidal ideation and attempts.4 
Moreover, individuals with comorbid mood disorders tend to have a worse seizure outcome 
than those without comorbid mood disorders.5
Although the comorbidity of epilepsy and mood disorders has been extensively studied, the 
cause of the comorbidity needs further clarification. One possible explanation is the chronic 
psychosocial impact of epilepsy, including social stigma,6 learned helplessness, and lack of 
control.7 Moreover, epilepsy can lead to an acute state of depressed mood due to side effects 
of antiepileptic drugs8 or seizure manifestations.9 Finally, the comorbidity may be due to an 
underlying shared neurobiologic pathogenesis, possibly involving the limbic system10; 11 or 
neurotransmitter function.12 Demonstration of the “bidirectionality” of the association (i.e., 
an increased risk of mood disorders in persons with epilepsy both before and after onset of 
epilepsy) supports the concept of shared pathogenic mechanisms.13
We took advantage of an ongoing study of familial epilepsy14 to investigate the hypothesis 
that the comorbidity between epilepsy and mood disorders is due, in part, to a shared genetic 
susceptibility. Few studies have investigated this hypothesis. In our previous study of 
families with autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF) with mutations 
in leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 gene (LGI1),15 rates of current depressive symptoms 
were increased among mutation carriers with epilepsy, but not among mutation carriers 
without epilepsy. In another study, a family history of epilepsy was associated with affective 
disorders among individuals with childhood onset epilepsy.16 However, neither study used a 
full diagnostic instrument nor assessed lifetime history of mood disorders, which is most 
important for assessing shared genetic risk.
In the current study, we used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)17 to 
assess the lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in a set of families enriched for genetic 
influences on epilepsy because they contained multiple affected individuals. To evaluate 
evidence for a shared genetic susceptibility to epilepsy and mood disorders, we assessed the 
lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in relatives without epilepsy in these families, and 
compared it with lifetime prevalence in a general population sample. We also compared the

 lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in individuals with vs. without epilepsy in these 
families (overall and by broadly defined epilepsy types), and assessed the relationship of 
lifetime prevalence of mood disorders to the type of epilepsy in the family.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Participants
The participants were members of families containing either two living siblings or three or 
more living individuals with epilepsy of unknown cause, ascertained from ongoing genetic 
studies in the Epilepsy Family Study of Columbia University.14 Potentially eligible families 
were identified from patients seen at the Columbia University Medical Center, referrals from 
neurologists at other institutions, and self-referrals in response to a study web site or 
advertisement, primarily through the Epilepsy Foundation.14 Families with known LGI1 
mutations or with clinical features consistent with autosomal dominant epilepsy with 
auditory features (ADEAF)18 were excluded. Clinical information for all family members 
was collected using a set of validated semi-structured interviews, usually administered by 
telephone. Medical records were obtained from the patients’ treating physicians and 
reviewed for seizure descriptions, histories of etiologic factors, and EEG and neuroimaging 
data. Some patients were also given a brief neurologic examination and a study EEG. The 
final diagnosis of each subject was based on consensus review of all available information 
by two experienced epileptologists. To prevent bias, the epileptologists were blinded to 
information about other family members when they reviewed each subject’s information.
For the present study, 84 eligible families were identified, each containing two or more 
living individuals with epilepsy of unknown cause. Potential participants included people 
with epilepsy of unknown cause (either focal epilepsy [FE], idiopathic generalized epilepsy 
[GE], both generalized and focal epilepsy, or unclassifiable epilepsy), and their first-degree 
relatives without epilepsy (RWOE). Families were excluded if no individual with epilepsy of 
unknown cause participated. A total of 548 individuals in 84 families containing an average 
of 2.8 individuals per family with epilepsy of unknown cause met initial inclusion criteria 
(234 individuals with epilepsy of unknown cause and 314 with RWOE). To assess the degree 
to which lifetime history of mood disorders was increased in individuals with epilepsy 
within families containing multiple affected individuals, we used the RWOE as an internal 
comparison group. To determine whether the lifetime prevalence of mood disorders was 
increased compared with the general population, we also included an external comparison 
group (see below).
Individuals meeting initial inclusion criteria were contacted by telephone and invited to 
participate. We attempted to reach each individual at least five times, at different times 
during the day and on weekends. For many subjects, a long time period (up to 20 years) had 
elapsed since last contact for the genetic study; hence whenever necessary, we searched 
telephone and internet databases for new addresses and phone numbers. Consenting 
individuals were scheduled for a subsequent telephone interview. An experienced 
interviewer, blind to the individual’s position in the pedigree and epilepsy history, 
administered the computerized lifetime version of the CIDI17 via telephone. The CIDI is a 
comprehensive, fully standardized diagnostic interview aimed at detecting a lifetime history

 of various DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses, created jointly by the World Health Organization 
and the former United States Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, 
which has been used in large epidemiological studies. Our primary and secondary outcomes 
were lifetime prevalence of any mood disorder (defined as any major depressive disorder, 
dysthymia, or bipolar disorder) and major depressive disorder specifically. For diagnosis of 
these outcomes, we used both the depression and mania modules of the CIDI. The mood 
disorders section includes questions assessing for major depressive disorder (single and 
recurrent), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia. The mania module was used to rule out history 
of bipolar disorders (manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes).
The study was approved by the Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review 
Board; all subjects gave informed consent.
General Population Sample
For the external comparison sample, we used data from the National Comorbidity Survey 
Replication (NCS-R).19 The NCS-R is a nationally representative face-to-face household 
survey of 9,090 respondents aged 18 years and older. The target population of the NCS-R 
was the civilian non-institutionalized population residing in the 48 contiguous states. 
Consenting subjects were administered the DSM-IV version of the CIDI as in the current 
study.
Statistical Analyses
Data analyses were carried out using SAS software, Version 9.3 for Windows. Copyright © 
[2011] SAS Institute Inc. SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc. product or service names are 
registered trademarks or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. We used logistic 
regression to compute odds ratios (ORs) for lifetime prevalence of any mood disorder in 
people with epilepsy (any epilepsy of unknown cause, GE, FE) using RWOE as the 
reference group. By design, the study participants were not independent since multiple 
individuals were sampled within each family. To account for this familial clustering in our 
analyses, we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) with exchangeable correlation 
structure, implemented in the SAS GENMOD procedure. We also repeated the analyses 
restricting the outcome to lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder, excluding 
participants diagnosed with a mood disorder other than major depression (n=4).
Variables considered for inclusion in the analyses as potential confounders were gender, 
marital status, education, age at CIDI interview and total number of family members with 
epilepsy. For RWOE, we assessed whether the relationship of the unaffected participants to 
their first-degree relative(s) with epilepsy (parent, offspring, sibling, or multiple first-degree 
relatives with epilepsy) was associated with mood disorders. All associations were expressed 
as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence Intervals (CI).
We also generated unadjusted Kaplan-Meier failure curves to illustrate the cumulative 
incidence of mood disorders among participants; for these analyses, comparisons of 
incidence rates among subjects with FE or GE vs. RWOE, were made using the log-rank 
test. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate differences between 
participants with epilepsy and RWOE in the risk of developing a mood disorder, using robust

 sandwich covariance matrix estimates to account for clustering. Follow-up time was defined 
by the time from birth until the self-reported age at incidence of mood disorders (for those 
who had a mood disorder) or age at interview (for those who did not have a mood disorder).
For comparisons with the general population sample, we computed standardized prevalence 
morbidity ratios (SPRs) applying the SAS PROC STDRATE procedure, using the NCS-R as 
the standard population. For this analysis, observed number of cases of mood disorders in 
each of the various subgroups of interest in our study (numerator) was divided by the 
number expected (denominator) based on gender- and age-specific (ages 18–29, 30–44, 45–
59, ≥60) prevalence of mood disorders from the NCS-R.20
We also examined whether the likelihood of a lifetime history of mood disorders varied 
according to the type of epilepsy in the family. For these analyses, we computed ORs for 
mood disorders in participants with vs. without ≥1 relative with FE, and with vs. without ≥1 
relative with GE.
RESULTS
Of the 548 individuals who met initial criteria for inclusion, 145 (26.5%) were excluded 
before attempting contact because they had died (22.1%), were unable to participate due to 
illness (1.4%), or had no participating relative with epilepsy of unknown cause (76.6%). We 
attempted to contact the remaining 403 individuals (222 epilepsy of unknown cause and 181 
RWOEs). Of these, 271 (67.2%) were successfully contacted, and 192 (70.8% of those 
contacted) participated (110 epilepsy of unknown cause and 82 RWOEs). Individuals from 
60 distinct families were interviewed; the number of interviewed relatives per family ranged 
from 1 to 18 with a mean of 3.2 (with epilepsy 1.8, range 1 to 5; RWOE 1.4, range 0 to 13). 
Among individuals with epilepsy of unknown cause, 42 (38%) had GE, 50 (45%) FE, six 
(5%) both, and 12 (11%) were unclassifiable. For analyses of specific epilepsy types, 
individuals with both GE and FE or unclassifiable epilepsy were excluded.
Seventy (36%) participants met criteria for lifetime history of mood disorders, which 
included major depressive disorder (MDD) only (n=62), MDD plus dysthymic disorder 
(n=4), dysthymic disorder only (n=1) and bipolar disorder (n=3). Women were more likely 
to meet criteria for mood disorders than men (p=0.04). Lifetime prevalence of mood 
disorders declined with advancing age, but the linear trend was not significant (p=0.06). 
Prevalence of mood disorders was not associated with either marital status or educational 
attainment.
We examined sociodemographic variables by epilepsy history (Table 1). Compared with 
RWOEs, individuals with epilepsy were more likely to be women (65% vs. 54%, p=0.09), 
and were younger (though not significantly so: mean age 48.5 vs. 52.9 years, p= 0.37), and 
less likely to be married (48% vs. 66%, p=0.06). Education was comparable in participants 
with and without epilepsy. Based on these findings and since women are twice as likely as 
men to be diagnosed with major depression across a variety of settings, 21 we considered 
gender, but not age, education, or marital status, to be a potentially confounding variable and 
included it in our regression analyses.

 Cumulative incidence of mood disorders was significantly higher in participants with 
epilepsy than in RWOEs among all participants (p=0.01 by log-rank test), and among 
women (p=0.006), but not men (p=0.47) (Figure 1). Cumulative risk of mood disorders was 
higher for participants with FE than for either those with GE or RWOE, both in the total 
sample and women only, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, no significant 
differences were observed in the men.
Controlling for gender, ORs for lifetime prevalence of mood disorders were significantly 
increased in participants with FE versus RWOE (OR = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.1, 5.2) and in FE vs. GE (OR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.1, 6.5) (Table 2a). In contrast, the odds of 
mood disorders did not differ significantly between participants with GE and RWOE (OR = 
0.9; 95% CI 0.4, 2.2). The ORs for major depressive disorder followed a similar pattern as 
for any mood disorder, but were slightly lower (Table 2b). Hazard ratios computed by Cox 
proportional hazards regression were similar to the ORs computed by logistic regression 
(data not shown). Among the 45 individuals with epilepsy who met criteria for lifetime 
history of mood disorders, 40 reported age of onset of mood disorders, of whom four had 
onset of mood disorders before onset of epilepsy (three with FE and one with unclassified 
epilepsy).
We used the external comparison group to assess whether the lifetime prevalence of mood 
disorders in the familial epilepsy cohort (both individuals with epilepsy and RWOE) was 
increased, compared with the general population, as reflected by prevalence in the National 
Comorbidity Survey (NCS-R) (Table 3).19 The SPRs were adjusted for gender and age 
separately since the NCS-R did not report rates stratified simultaneously by age and gender. 
Lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in the familial epilepsy sample was higher than the 
corresponding NCS-R rates, as indicated by SPRs greater than 1. The total SPR for RWOE 
was 1.4 (p=0.14) and the gender- and age-adjusted SPRs were similar. While the SPRs for 
GE were approximately 1.4, none was significant. In contrast, the age and gender-adjusted 
SPRs for FE were significant (total SPR=24, p=0.002).
We also examined whether the type of epilepsy in affected family members (≥1 relative with 
FE or ≥1 relative with GE) was associated with the likelihood of mood disorders (Table 4). 
Among RWOE, prevalence of mood disorders was not associated with having ≥1 relative 
with either GE or FE specifically. Among participants with epilepsy, however, prevalence of 
mood disorders was significantly associated with having ≥1 relative with FE (OR=2.4, Table 
4). Although not significant, this pattern also appeared to be present among participants with 
either GE (OR=1.9) or FE (OR=1.3). The number of relatives with FE and the number of 
relatives with GE within each family were negatively correlated (r = −0.74, p <0.0001), 
reflecting the tendency for families to be “concordant” for epilepsy type.22 Consistent with 
this relationship, prevalence of mood disorders was inversely associated with having ≥1 
relative with GE among all relatives with epilepsy (OR=0.4) and among those with GE 
specifically (OR=0.2) (Table 4).
We also examined whether the lifetime prevalence of mood disorders among RWOE was 
related to the total number of individuals with epilepsy within the family. Such an 
association, if observed, could reflect either an effect of increasing genetic heritability or

 psychosocial factors related to family burden. Among RWOE, prevalence of mood disorders 
was not associated with either total number of family members with epilepsy of any type, or 
number of family members with GE or FE specifically (data not shown). We also found no 
significant differences in prevalence of mood disorders among RWOE according to their 
relationship to a family member with epilepsy (unaffected parent, child, or sibling of an 
individual with epilepsy, or unaffected individual with multiple relatives with epilepsy).
DISCUSSION
In this study of families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy, the lifetime 
prevalence of mood disorders was significantly increased in individuals with FE, compared 
with either individuals with GE or RWOE. Similarly, compared with rates from the National 
Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), which represent rates in the general US 
population, the rate of any mood disorder was increased in individuals with FE, but not in 
individuals with GE. Moreover, lifetime prevalence of mood disorders was increased among 
participants with epilepsy who had ≥1 relative with FE, but not among those who had had ≥1 
relative with GE. Lastly, among RWOE, we found suggestive evidence for increased 
prevalence of any mood disorder, compared with rates in the general population based on the 
NCS-R, (SPR=1.4; Table 3).
How do these results clarify the various explanations for the comorbidity of epilepsy and 
mood disorders? The specificity of our findings to individuals with FE but not GE argues 
against a psychosocial effect of having a disabling, stigmatized disorder. This explanation 
would imply a greater psychosocial burden in FE than in GE, possibly resulting from greater 
illness severity in FE. However, in our sample, illness severity does not appear to be greater 
in FE than GE. Approximately half of those in the current study also participated in another 
recent study and were asked about their lifetime number of seizures and time since last 
seizure.23–26 In this subsample, individuals with FE and GE did not differ in either of these 
epilepsy severity measures (Supplementary Table 1).
Our finding of marginally increased prevalence of mood disorders in RWOE than in the 
general population is consistent with either a shared genetic susceptibility to mood disorders 
and epilepsy or a psychological burden of having multiple relatives with epilepsy. A recent 
literature review provides evidence that several negative consequences of epilepsy are likely 
to extend to family caregivers of patients with epilepsy.27 Having a relative with epilepsy is 
associated with considerable emotional distress and imposes economic liability on other 
members of the family, especially on family caregivers.28 However, our findings appear to 
be inconsistent with psychological burden as an explanation for the increased prevalence of 
mood disorders among RWOE. If psychological burden was the explanation, we would have 
expected prevalence of mood disorders in RWOE to be related to number of relatives with 
epilepsy and biological relationship to a person with epilepsy (sibling, parent, or child), 
which we did not observe. However, a limitation of these analyses is that we do not have 
information on the caregiving status of the family members without epilepsy or the family 
environment that might ameliorate or exacerbate the burden of illness.29

 Our study was limited by its cross-sectional design, in which diagnoses of mood disorders 
were obtained from retrospective recall. While individuals with epilepsy may be more likely 
than those without epilepsy to recall a past mood disorder, we have no reason to believe that 
recall would be differential by epilepsy type. Another constraint was the limited data on 
clinical seizure features. As cited above, we had severity and frequency data on 
approximately 50% of the individuals, but we did not have information on treatments for 
epilepsy (e.g., medications, surgery, vagal nerve stimulation) and their side effects. These 
findings may not be generalizable to other individuals with epilepsy, since the participants 
came from families with familial epilepsy. However, study of these families is particularly 
advantageous for investigating our hypotheses. We ascertained lifetime prevalence of mood 
disorders using the CIDI, a comprehensive, structured diagnostic interview. Finally, we had a 
relatively large sample size that enabled us to compare prevalence of mood disorders among 
individuals with focal and generalized epilepsy.
Although the present study does not include families with LGI1 mutations or with suspected 
ADEAF, our findings are compatible with the results from our previous study of ADEAF 
due to mutations in LGI1.15 In the previous study, current depressive symptoms (as opposed 
to lifetime prevalence reported here) were increased in mutation carriers with FE but not in 
mutation carriers without epilepsy, compared with family members who did not have a risk-
raising mutation. Similarly, in the present study of familial epilepsy families, lifetime 
prevalence of mood disorders was increased, compared with general population rates, in 
individuals with FE but not in RWOE. Moreover, in a recent study that included 
approximately 50% of subjects from this dataset, prevalence of current depressive symptoms 
was lower in married-in individuals (3.9%) than in biologic relatives without epilepsy, but 
the difference was not significant (age-adjusted PR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.19–2.56, p = 0.50).26
In summary, our results are generally consistent with the hypothesis of shared genetic 
susceptibility to mood disorders and FE (but not GE). Among participants with FE, the 
prevalence of mood disorders was significantly increased compared with either individuals 
with GE or RWOE, and the rate of any mood disorder was increased compared with rates in 
a general population sample. Among individuals with epilepsy, prevalence of mood 
disorders was significantly associated with having one or more relatives with FE. These 
results are unlikely to be explained fully by side effects of antiepileptic medications,8 
epilepsy-related felt stigma,30 or impaired quality of life and psychosocial functioning,31; 32 
because individuals with generalized epilepsy probably experience similar complications 
and difficulties related to living with epilepsy. They provide support for the concept that 
comorbidity results from shared pathogenic mechanisms between mood disorders and focal 
epilepsy, possibly mediated by changes in neurotransmitters or structural abnormalities of 
the limbic circuit.10; 11
On the other hand, our findings in RWOE appear to be inconsistent with the hypothesis of 
shared genetic susceptibility to FE and mood disorders. RWOE who have ≥1 relative with 
FE are expected to have an increased frequency of genetic variants that raises the risk for 
FE, and if these variants also increase the risk for mood disorders, it would be expected that 
RWOE would have an increased risk of mood disorders. However, since these relatives do 
not have epilepsy, they must be “non-penetrant” for the FE-related genetic variants. Hence,

 under a hypothesis of shared genetic susceptibility, one possible explanation for the lack of 
increased risk of mood disorders in these RWOE is that the same (genetic or environmental) 
factors that protected them from developing epilepsy also protected them from developing 
mood disorders.
Many tools are now available to screen for mood disorders in patients with epilepsy.33 Mood 
disorders in people with epilepsy are associated with poorer seizure control, and several 
antidepressants, particularly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have anticonvulsant 
properties.34 Despite the substantial morbidity associated with mood disorders and the 
availability of appropriate screening tools and therapeutic treatments, mood disorders remain 
underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with epilepsy.35 Clinicians treating patients 
with epilepsy should evaluate their patients, particularly those with focal epilepsy, for mood 
disorders and initiate appropriate treatment.

 Key Points
•
In multiplex epilepsy families, lifetime prevalence of mood disorders was 
significantly increased in people with focal epilepsy (FE).
•
Lifetime prevalence of mood disorders was not increased in people with 
generalized epilepsy (GE).
•
Lifetime prevalence of mood disorders was higher in people with epilepsy 
with vs. without relatives with FE but not in those with vs. without relatives 
with GE.
•
Lifetime prevalence of mood disorders was modestly (but not significantly) 
increased in relatives without epilepsy.
•
Results support the hypothesis of shared genetic risk for epilepsy and mood 
disorders that is specific for FE.
