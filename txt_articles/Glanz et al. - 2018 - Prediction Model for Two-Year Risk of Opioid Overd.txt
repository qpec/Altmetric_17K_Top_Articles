BACKGROUND: Naloxone is a life-saving opioid antago-
nist. Chronic pain guidelines recommend that physicians
co-prescribe naloxone to patients at high risk for opioid
overdose. However, clinical tools to efficiently identify pa-
tients who could benefit from naloxone are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an overdose predic-
tive model which could be used in primary care settings to
assess the need for naloxone.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: Derivation site was an integrated health sys-
tem in Colorado; validation site was a safety-net health
system in Colorado.
PARTICIPANTS: We developed a predictive model in a
cohort of 42,828 patients taking chronic opioid therapy
and externally validated the model in 10,708 patients.
MAIN MEASURES: Potential predictors and outcomes
(nonfatal pharmaceutical and heroin overdoses) were
extracted from electronic health records. Fatal overdose
outcomes were identified from state vital records. To
match the approximate shelf-life of naloxone, we used
Cox proportional hazards regression to model the 2-
year risk of overdose. Calibration and discrimination
were assessed.
KEY RESULTS: A five-variable predictive model showed
good calibration and discrimination (bootstrap-corrected
c-statistic = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.78)
in the derivation site, with sensitivity of 66.1% and spec-
ificity of 66.6%. In the validation site, the model showed
good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.75, 95% CI 0.70–0.80)
and less than ideal calibration, with sensitivity and spec-
ificity of 82.2% and 49.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients on chronic opioid ther-
apy, the predictive model identified 66–82% of all subse-
quent opioid overdoses. This model is an efficient screen-
ing tool to identify patients who could benefit from nalox-
one to prevent overdose deaths. Population differences
across the two sites limited calibration in the validation
site.

INTRODUCTION
Overdoses from pharmaceutical opioids and heroin are a sig-
nificant public health concern.1,2 Fatalities due to pharmaceu-
tical opioids increased nearly fourfold from 2000 to 2014, and
recent data show that heroin overdose rates are rising.1 Since
opioids are prescribed in an estimated one in five ambulatory
visits for pain, targeted overdose-prevention interventions are
needed.3
Naloxone is an effective medication used by medical per-
sonnel to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. In the
1990s, community-based organizations began distributing nal-
oxone to people using heroin for lay bystander administra-
tion.4 The Food and Drug Administration recently approved
new delivery devices for bystander naloxone administration,
and national efforts have sought to expand access to nalox-
one.5–7 In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) issued guidelines encouraging providers to co-
prescribe naloxone to patients receiving chronic opioid thera-
py at high risk for overdose.6 Many states have also passed
laws to permit naloxone standing orders, allowing people to
acquire naloxone from pharmacies without a prescription.7
Despite these efforts, naloxone uptake appears to be
low.8–10 Cost is one significant barrier to expanded access.
The Narcan nasal spray is $150 for a two-dose package,
while the cost of two doses of the Evzio auto-injector in-
creased from $690 in 2014 to $4500 in 2016.8 In addition to
cost barriers, patients receiving chronic opioid therapy may
not actively seek naloxone, because they underestimate their
risk for overdose, are unaware of the benefits of naloxone, or
fear that requesting naloxone will erode trust with their
provider.11 Although clinicians can offer and prescribe nal-
oxone to patients, they do not have the tools to efficiently

 identify patients at highest risk for overdose who would
benefit from naloxone.12
Numerous studies have examined risk factors for opioid
overdose using complex statistical models designed to es-
tablish causation.13–19 In contrast, a prognostic model20 to
guide clinical decision-making should be based on a limited
set of common diagnoses and characteristics that can be
easily collected while a provider is seeing the patient. This
implies that the model cannot rely on excessively detailed
clinical information, nor can it include future changes
impacting risk, such as new diagnoses, discontinuation of
opioids, or dose changes.
The objective of this study was to build and validate a
prognostic statistical model that could be used by primary care
providers and health systems to objectively and efficiently
identify patients who are appropriate candidates for naloxone
prescriptions at the point of care. We developed the model to
accurately predict the risk of fatal and nonfatal opioid or heroin
overdose within 2 years, the approximate shelf-life of nalox-
one.21 To maximize generalizability, we aimed to externally
validate the model in a health system serving a different
patient population.
METHODS
Study Design, Study Sites, and Sources of Data
We developed and internally validated a prognostic model20 in
a cohort of patients taking chronic opioid therapy enrolled in
the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) health plan. KPCO
is a group model integrated health system that provides
healthcare to approximately 670,000 members. KPCO
operates its own pharmacies, and most opioid prescriptions
are dispensed to members in these pharmacies.
The model was externally validated in a separate cohort
receiving care at the Denver Health and Hospital Authority
(DH). DH is a safety-net system serving more than 139,000
ethnically diverse patients. Every DH primary care facility has
its own pharmacy.
Demographic and clinical data on patients in both cohorts
were extracted from electronic health records (EHR) and
pharmacy databases. These data included diagnoses (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 codes) in outpatient,
emergency department, and inpatient settings, and prescrip-
tions dispensed in outpatient pharmacies.
Death data (death date and all recorded causes of deaths
using ICD-10 codes) were obtained through linkage with state
vital records. Social security number, name (including partial
names), and birth date were used to identify and confirm
matches.
The study was approved by the KPCO Institutional Review
Board and the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board.
Study data are protected by a federal Certificate of
Confidentiality.
Study Cohorts
In both sites, we identified patients receiving chronic opioid
therapy. First, we identified individuals who received one or more
opioid prescriptions between January 1, 2006, and December 31,
2014. Among these patients, we identified those with opioid
prescriptions dispensed on at least three different dates within
90 days, irrespective of the number of different opioid prescrip-
tions on a given day. These represented cohorts of patients with
incident chronic opioid therapy during the 8-year observation
period. Among the first three dispensing dates in the 90-day
period, the third dispensing date represented the index date for
each patient. Opioids were identified using National Drug Codes
and prescription dispensing dates from automated pharmacy files.
Long-acting and extended-release (LA/ER, including methadone
for pain) and short-acting opioids were included, but methadone
dispensed from addiction clinics and all buprenorphine-
containing products were excluded, as these are largely pre-
scribed for addiction treatment. Patients prescribed chronic opioid
therapy who also received methadone or buprenorphine for
addiction treatment during follow-up were not excluded. Since
many patients are exposed to opioids intermittently prior to
starting chronic opioid therapy, patients who had been exposed
to opioids prior to the index date were not excluded.
Patients were excluded if they had a cancer diagnosis or a
do-not-resuscitate order in the year prior to the index date, or if
they were younger than 18 on the index date. In KPCO,
patients were also excluded if they were not continuously
enrolled 365 days prior to the index date or if they did not
have pharmacy coverage. Since DH does not have enrollment,
we excluded patients who did not meet the definition of
empanelment used in prior studies: at least one primary care
visit in the 18 months prior to the index date.22,23
Patients were followed up to 2 years after the index date;
follow-up was censored at the time of the opioid overdose,
death from any cause, disenrollment from the health plan
(KPCO) or more than 18 months since the last healthcare visit
(DH), or September 30, 2015.
Opioid Exposure and Other Predictor Variables
We considered several known or suspected correlates of opioid
overdose13–19 as potential predictors, including demographics;
medications dispensed—including opioid medications and
their formulations (LA/ER)—tobacco use; and substance
abuse/dependence, mental health, and chronic disease diagno-
ses (Table 1). Demographic variables were extracted from the
EHR, and included age on index date, gender, race/ethnicity,
and Medicaid coverage. Using automated pharmacy files,
medication exposures included opioids, psychotropics, anti-
convulsants, stimulants and muscle relaxants. For opioid ex-
posures, we calculated the average daily morphine milligram
equivalents (MME) for all opioid prescriptions on the index
date or prior prescriptions whose days’ supply covered the
index date.24 Dose and formulation variables were based on
active prescriptions covering the index date (e.g., a person with
1647
Glanz et al.: Predicting Overdose with Chronic Opioid Therapy
JGIM
 a long-acting opioid prescribed 6 days before the index date in
a 30-day quantity was classified as being on an LA/ER formu-
lation). These variables were not included in the model as time-
varying covariates, because clinicians would not be privy to
information about future changes in dose and formulation
when employing a prognostic model. History of opioids dis-
pensed prior to meeting the definition of chronic opioid therapy
was examined in the model.
Tobacco use was based on social history or a tobacco abuse/
dependence diagnosis. Diagnoses such as hepatitis C infection
were based on ICD–9 codes collected in routine clinical care
based on patient history, laboratory results, and diagnostic pro-
cedures. Other than age and opioid dose and formulation, all
variables were assessed in the 365 days prior to the index date.
Outcome: Opioid Overdose
Between January 1, 2006, and September 30, 2015, we identi-
fied fatal and nonfatal pharmaceutical opioid and heroin over-
doses in emergency department and inpatient settings. We
included unintentional, undetermined and suicidal overdoses,
as all opioid-induced respiratory depression can be reversed
with naloxone. Consistent with codes used or validated in prior
overdose studies and injury surveillance guidelines, we used
ICD-9 codes 965.0–965.02, 965.09, and E850.0–E850.2 for
nonfatal overdoses; for fatal overdoses, we used ICD-10 under-
lying cause of death codes for drug poisoning (X40–X44, X60–
X64, X85, Y10–Y14) and a contributing cause of death code
indicating opioid involvement (T40.0–T40.4, T40.6).13,17,25–28
Overdoses were captured within 2 years of the index date, as the
shelf-life of naloxone is approximately 2 years.21
Predictive Model Development and Internal
Validity
In the derivation (KPCO) cohort, we used Cox proportional
hazards regression to examine associations between baseline
predictor variables and incident opioid overdose. Prior to
building the model, we examined frequencies and distribu-
tions for potential predictor variables to identify missing
values, sparse categories, and extreme values. If cause of death
was unknown, the patient was excluded from the analysis,
since some of these deaths may have been opioid-related.
To avoid overfitting the model, we restricted the number of
potential predictors and required at least ten overdoses per
degree of freedom. We first grouped medications and diagno-
ses into broad, clinically meaningful categories so that the
model could be used in a typical primary care visit. We then
examined the bivariable associations between potential pre-
dictors and overdose risk. Guided by statistical and clinical
significance, we chose nine predictors for the multivariable
model. With backward elimination, we sequentially removed
variables with a P value >0.05 from the model. Backward
elimination is the preferred choice for variable selection in
predictive modeling.20 Continuous variables were tested using
simple parametric forms (a single linear term, low-order poly-
nomials, logarithmic) and restricted cubic splines; categorical
variables were modeled using indicator variables. We evalu-
ated proportional hazards assumptions using Schoenfeld re-
sidual plots and a global goodness-of-fit test.
We evaluated the final model’s internal validity at the der-
ivation site by examining discrimination and calibration.29
Using the Harrell bootstrap resampling,30 we calculated the
bootstrap-corrected concordance statistic (c-statistic) to assess
discrimination (the extent to which patients who were predict-
ed to be at higher risk exhibit higher overdose rates relative to
those predicted to be at lower risk). Calibration (the extent to
which the predicted overdose risk agrees with the observed
risk) was evaluated with the Greenwood-D’Agostino-Nam
test.31 Discrimination and calibration were assessed graphical-
ly by dividing the cohort into tertiles based on the predicted
risk, and then plotting the mean predicted cumulative risk with
the Kaplan-Meier observed cumulative risk for each tertile.32
Widely separated Kaplan-Meier cumulative risk curves indi-
cate better discrimination; agreement between predicted and
observed risk over the follow-up indicate better calibration.33
In addition, we calculated the D-statistic to further assess
discrimination and the R2 statistic on the basis of the D-
statistic to quantify explained variation.33, 34, 35

 To improve the model’s clinical utility, the regression coef-
ficients were translated into a point-based risk score, with
more points indicating higher overdose risk.36
External Validation
The external validity of the model was tested in an indepen-
dent cohort of DH patients (validation cohort) by examining
discrimination and calibration.33 We first calculated the 2-year
predicted overdose risk for patients in the validation cohort
using coefficients for the linear predictor and baseline survival
from the derivation model. We then calculated the c-statistic to
assess discrimination. The validation cohort was divided into
tertiles based on the predicted risk from the derivation model,
and discrimination and calibration were assessed graphically.
Calibration was further assessed with the Greenwood-
D’Agostino-Nam test.31 The D-statistic and R2 statistic were
also calculated.33, 34, 35
All analyses were conducted using R statistical software (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Derivation and Internal Validation of Risk Model
At the derivation site, we identified 58,162 adult patients who
received chronic opioid therapy and who met enrollment and
pharmacy coverage criteria between January 1, 2006, and
December 31, 2014. Of these, 15,270 (26.3%) were excluded
because they had a diagnosis of cancer or a do-not-resuscitate
order. Another 64 (0.1%) patients were excluded because they
died of unknown causes, some of which may have been
opioid-related. In the cohort of 42,828 patients, there were
110 incident nonfatal opioid overdoses, of which five were
from heroin, and 11 fatal opioid overdoses. Among the 42,828
patients, 36 (0.08%) had a prior overdose in the year before the
index date. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier overdose risk was 0.33%
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28–0.40). Baseline character-
istics and opioid prescription types covering the index date are
displayed in Table 2 and eTable 1 (online), respectively. Over-
all, the average number of opioid prescriptions over the
follow-up was 7.88 (standard deviation [SD] = 9.97). In the
year prior to the index date, 40.6% the of cohort had received
prior intermittent opioid prescriptions. Among those who re-
ceived prior prescriptions, the mean number of prescriptions
was 2.28 (SD = 1.78).
The following nine variables were selected as potential
overdose predictors: age; daily opioid dose; LA/ER opioid
prescription; psychotropic prescription; history of opioid pre-
scription; tobacco use; and mental health, substance abuse/
dependence, and hepatitis C diagnoses (Table 3). Age showed
a U-shaped relationship with overdose risk, with the lowest
risk among individuals 55–65 years of age. Thus, a quadratic
term for age was included to improve model fit. The final
model included five of these variables (age; age-squared; LA/

 ER formulation; tobacco use; and mental health and substance
abuse/dependence diagnoses, Table 3). Schoenfeld residual
plots and the global goodness-of-fit test (P = 0.46) indicated
that the proportional hazards assumption was met.
The model effectively discriminated between high- and low-
risk patients (Table 4), with an uncorrected c-statistic of 0.75
(95% CI 0.70–0.79) and a bootstrap-corrected c-statistic of
0.73 (95% CI 0.69–0.78). The D-statistic was 1.56 (95% CI
1.28–1.85), and the R2 was 36.8% (95% CI 28.04–44.85%).
Patients were divided into tertiles according to their predicted
overdose risk, and observed and predicted risks were graphed
over 2 years (Fig. 1, derivation cohort). The graph demon-
strates good discrimination, with the curve for the highest risk
tertile well separated from the two lower risk tertiles. The graph
also demonstrates effective calibration, since observed and
predicted risks show good agreement over time. The Green-
wood-D’Agostino-Nam test (P = 0.22) indicated that the mod-
el was well-calibrated. When risk was dichotomized into high
(third tertile) versus lower (first and second tertiles) risk, the
model had sensitivity of 66.1% and specificity of 66.6%. The
positive predictive value for the model was 0.56%.
External Validation of Risk Model
At the validation site, we identified a cohort of 12,876 adult
patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who met
empanelment criteria between January 1, 2006, and December
31, 2014. Of these, 2168 (16.8%) were excluded because they
had a diagnosis of cancer or a do-not-resuscitate order. In the
cohort of 10,708 patients, there were 65 incident nonfatal
overdoses, 15 of which were from heroin, and 53 fatal over-
doses, nine of which were from heroin. Among 10,708
patients, 23 (0.2%) had an overdose in the year prior to the
index date. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier overdose risk was 1.2%
(95% CI 0.97–1.4). The derivation and validation cohorts
differed significantly by most baseline characteristics
(Table 2). Opioid prescriptions are shown in eTable 1 (online).
Utilization rates over the follow-up were similar between sites
(eTable 2, online).
When the derivation model was used to predict overdose at
the validation site, the c-statistic was 0.75 (95% CI 0.70–0.80),
indicating good discrimination. Model calibration, in contrast,
was relatively poor. The Greenwood-D’Agostino-Nam test
was statistically significant (P < 0.001); Figure 1 (validation
cohort) demonstrates that the model under-predicted overdose.
When the third tertile was considered high-risk (vs. lower-
risk), the model’s sensitivity and specificity were 82.2% and
49.5%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 1.8%.
The D-statistic was 1.53 (95% CI 1.24–1.82), and the R2 was
35.8% (95% CI 26.83–44.09%).
The prognostic index was converted to a points-based scale
(Table 5) to allow providers to classify patients as low- (≤ 85),
medium- (86–103), or high-risk (≥ 104) by summing the
points based on patient characteristics. The cut points are
based on risk tertiles. As an example, a 50-year-old (84 points
for age) with a diagnosis of a substance use disorder (22
points) in the last year would have a score of 106, indicating
high 2-year opioid overdose risk.
DISCUSSION
We developed a prognostic model to identify patients on
chronic opioid therapy at high risk for overdose. The model

 comprised five variables that were readily available from the
EHR in two diverse health systems. Although calibration was
less than ideal in the validation cohort, the model demonstrat-
ed good internal validity and discriminated between patients
with and without overdose in both health systems. At the point
of care, providers could use the model to risk-stratify patients
for naloxone prescribing.
Since naloxone is a safe and effective medication that prevents
overdose death, universal prescribing to all patients on chronic
opioid therapy could have a significant public health impact. At
present, however, evidence supporting the effectiveness of such
practice is limited. In addition, due to rising costs,8 universal
prescribing may not be feasible in many health systems. Further,
clinicians must inform patients of their risk, describe how to
recognize an overdose, explain how to use naloxone, and write
theprescription.Priorstudiessuggest these steps may bea barrier to
universal naloxone prescribing given brief primary care visits and
competing preventive and chronic care needs,12 such as developing
alternative pain management strategies and reducing exposure to
opioids.
Our results corroborate the findings of prior overdose risk
studies among patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy.13,15
The annual overdose incidence rate in our derivation cohort
was approximately 167.4/100,000 person-years, and patients
taking LA/ER formulations had a significantly higher overdose
risk than patients taking short-acting opioids. Moreover, only
3% of patients were initiated on treatment with LA/ER formu-
lations, reflecting CDC prescribing guidelines recommending
that physicians start with short-acting opioids.6
Current national policies and guidelines for opioid prescrib-
ing practices highlight dose as an important indicator of opioid
overdose risk.6,13 In our study, however, opioid dose did not
remain in the final model. Dose is likely most predictive of
overdose events shortly after a prescription.13 Since our model
was designed to predict overdose events for up to 2 years after

 a prescription, dose may have fluctuated significantly over the
follow-up, rendering certain stable variables more predictive
of longer-term overdoses. In our model, mental health diag-
noses, substance use disorders, LA/ER opioid formulations,
and tobacco use were stronger overdose predictors. These
results suggest that focusing primarily on dose may not be
the best approach for targeting preventive clinical interven-
tions which confer benefit over longer periods.
Prescription or illicit opioid use may lead to overdose for a
range of reasons, including prescribing error, suicide, addic-
tion, or risk behavior. While separate models could be devel-
oped and tested for each of these pathways to overdose, it is
not practical to employ multiple overdose risk models in
primary care. Since naloxone is effective regardless of the
cause or intent of the opioid poisoning, we employed a broad
overdose outcome definition.
In contrast to prior risk models,37,38 we built a parsimonious
model based on information readily available in the EHR and
externally validated the model. While discrimination was
good at the external site, the model’s calibration was less than
ideal. This limitation can be attributed to the significant case
mix differences between the two cohorts (Table 2). The base-
line overdose rate was significantly lower in the derivation
cohort, and may in part explain why the model under-
predicted overdose risk in the validation cohort. In addition,
the ratio of nonfatal to fatal overdose was considerably higher
in the derivation cohort than in the validation cohort, suggest-
ing that nonfatal overdoses may have been under-ascertained
in the validation cohort. While these factors may have nega-
tively affected the model’s overall performance, the model was
also associated with sensitivity of greater than 80% in the
validation cohort. This latter result suggests that a large ma-
jority of the DH patients at risk for overdose would have been
targeted for naloxone prescription, which is appropriate given
its favorable risk–benefit profile.39
As described above, the intent of the model was to risk-
stratify patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy into groups
that would be indicated for naloxone. In addition to guiding
providers, the model could be used by health systems to target
wide-scale naloxone interventions. However, it may not be
advisable to use the model for applications with substantially
different risk–benefit profiles. For instance, due to its
miscalibration, the model should not be used directly by
patients to determine their individual overdose risk. In addi-
tion, because of the low positive predictive value of the model,
most patients indicated for naloxone will not experience an
overdose. Therefore, physicians should not use our model to,
for example, decide whom to taper off opioid therapy, which
may have unintended adverse effects. For such decisions,
physicians should consider other factors that may affect the
risk–benefit ratio of tapering, including pain, risk of withdraw-
al, and risk of transitioning to heroin use.40–45
Amidst the current opioid epidemic, we developed a five-
variable model using readily available EHR data to identify
high-risk patients who would benefit from naloxone to prevent
deaths. While the model needs further evaluation, it was able
to predict 66–82% of opioid overdoses in two disparate patient
populations.
