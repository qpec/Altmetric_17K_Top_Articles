Abstract
Microfracture, a common procedure for treatment of cartilage injury, induces fibrocartilage
repair by recruiting bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to the site of carti-
lage injury. However, fibrocartilage is inferior biomechanically to hyaline cartilage. SRY-type
high-mobility group box-9 (SOX9) is a master regulator of chondrogenesis by promoting pro-
liferation and differentiation of MSC into chondrocytes. In this study we aimed to test the
therapeutic potential of cell penetrating recombinant SOX9 protein in regeneration of hyaline
cartilage in situ at the site of cartilage injury. We generated a recombinant SOX9 protein
which was fused with super positively charged green fluorescence protein (GFP) (scSOX9)
to facilitate cell penetration. scSOX9 was able to induce chondrogenesis of bone marrow
derived MSC in vitro. In a rabbit cartilage injury model, scSOX9 in combination with micro-
fracture significantly improved quality of repaired cartilage as shown by macroscopic
appearance. Histological analysis revealed that the reparative tissue induced by microfrac-
ture with scSOX9 had features of hyaline cartilage; and collagen type II to type I ratio was
similar to that in normal cartilage. This short term in vivo study demonstrated that when
administered at the site of microfracture, scSOX9 was able to induce reparative tissue with
features of hyaline cartilage.
Introduction
Articular cartilage defect is extremely common and carries a remarkably higher risk to prog-
ress to osteoarthritis (OA) [1–3]. Repair of defective articular cartilage remains a challenge.
Mature joint cartilage is free of blood vessels and enervation. This makes articular cartilage
a tissue with an almost absent intrinsic repair capacity in most in vivo situations. The com-
monly practiced surgical procedure, microfracture induces migration of bone marrow mesen-
chymal stem cells (MSC) to the site of cartilage defect. By drilling small holes deep into the

 subchondral bone marrow space, microfracture induces bleeding of bone marrow and form
clot at the surface of cartilage defect. It is thought that the MSC contained in the bone marrow
clot proliferate and differentiate into chondrocytes [4]. Clinical studies indicate that microfrac-
ture provides effective short-term improvement of joint function but with shortcomings of
poor long-term improvement and possible functional deterioration after 24 months [4]. This
is mainly because of fibrocartilage or fibrohyaline hybrid tissue rather than hyaline cartilage
was generated by this procedure. Fibrocartilage contains less proteoglycan and more type I col-
lagen with inferior biomechanical property [4, 5]. Therefore, it is an unmet need for develop-
ment of a method to induce hyaline cartilage in situ.
SOX9 is a member of the family of SOX (SRY-type high-mobility group (HMG) box) genes
and has been shown to be expressed predominantly in mesenchymal condensations and carti-
lage [6, 7]. SOX9 acts with different partners to orchestrate activation and repression of tran-
scription in the chondrogenic differentiation pathway. Thus SOX9 plays an essential role as
a transactivator of many genes preferentially expressed in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes
such as Col2a1 and aggrecan gene promoter/enhancer [8, 9]. Concomitantly, SOX9 directly
represses expression of Col10a1 at a stage prior to the onset of hypertrophy [10]. In humans,
haploinsufficiency of SOX9 results in campomelic dysplasia [6]. In mice, no cartilage devel-
oped in tetratomas derived from SOX9 knocked out embryonic stem cells [6]. Transgenic
over-expression of SOX9 in hypertrophic chondrocytes causes down-regulation of collagen
type X [10]. All these data indicate that SOX9 is a master regulator of the chondrocyte pheno-
type. Most importantly, while promoting chondrogenesis, SOX9 can concomitantly repress
chondrocyte hypertrophy. In addition, SOX9 also inhibits osteogenesis by suppressing colla-
gen type I and osteocalcin [11, 12]. SOX5 and SOX6 co-operate with SOX9 in promoting
chondrogenesis of MSC. Since MSC normally express both SOX5 and SOX6 and SOX9 further
upregulates SOX5 and SOX6 expression [13], promotion of SOX9 expression alone is suffi-
cient to direct MSC differentiation into chondrocytes. This has been confirmed by in vitro cul-
tures where lipofection mediated SOX9 gene transfection alone in bone marrow derived MSC
successfully differentiate into chondrocytes with no additional growth factors added [14].
Moreover, adenovirus mediated SOX9 gene transfer enables articular cartilage regeneration in
situ in a rabbit model of cartilage defect repair [11], but viral vectors suffer from inherited dis-
advantage of being potentially causing infection by the vector virus and hence it is not suitable
for clinical use [11].
To overcome problems with gene therapy involving viral vectors, we took a novel strategy
to provide SOX9 protein to MSC for promotion of chondrogenesis in vivo with a simple one
stage method. Proteins are large molecules which are unable to enter cells spontaneously. This
has limited the use of intracellular proteins as therapeutics. However, recent advancement in
protein engineering has shown that functional proteins can be delivered into mammalian cells
in vitro and in vivo using supercharged proteins [15–19]. We have produced a bioactive super-
charged SOX9 (scSOX9) which has the capability of entering cells and inducing MSC to differ-
entiate into chondrocytes in vitro. Here we report that it was technically feasible to administer
this scSOX9 at the site of microfracture and scSOX9 significantly improved quality of repaired
hyaline cartilage.

 Reagents
All the media, buffers, supplements, and reagents for cell culture were obtained from GIBCO
BRL-Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY) or Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Super pos-
itively charged green fluorescence protein (scGFP) and scSOX9, scSOX9-A76E and scMyoD
were kindly provided by VivoScript, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA).
Gene construction and protein production of recombinant scSOX9
A novel approach was designed to produce a bioactive SOX9 protein with the property of cell
penetration. This was achieved by molecular engineering, i.e., fusion of SOX9 with scGFP and
addition of a polyarginine tag (11R) [20]. The fusion protein is referred as super-charged
SOX9 (scSOX9). When GFP was modified to be super positively charged, it can penetrate
mammalian cells. The internalization depends on nonspecific electrostatic interactions with
sulfated proteoglycans present on the surface of most mammalian cells [17]. When fused to
super positively charged GFP, proteins rapidly enter mammalian cells with potency up to 100
folds greater than that of corresponding fusions with known protein transduction domains
including Tat, oligoarginine and penetratin [16]. The super positively charged GFP moiety of
the fusion protein serves two functions: transmembrane cell penetration and direct visualiza-
tion of the fusion protein intracellularly.
Cell culture and penetration of scSOX9 protein
Human skin fibroblast cell line, HFF or human bone marrow derived MSC at passage 5 were
grown in monolayer in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS
and low glucose (1.5 g/l). The cells cultured in 96 well flat-bottomed plates were incubated
with 10 μg/ml of scGFP or scSOX9 at 37˚C for 1 hour. Cells were washed with PBS containing
20U/ml heparin (pH7.4) to remove cell membrane bound scSOX9 and directly viewed under
fluorescent microscope to visualize transmembrane cell penetration.
Human MSC treated with or without 10 μg/ml of scSOX9 were washed, trypsinized and ana-
lyzed in flow cytometry to further confirm scSOX9 cell penetration by mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI). MSC treated with or without scSOX9 were washed with PBS containing heparin and per-
meabilized, followed by incubation with streptavidin-Cy3 (red) (streptavidin binds to positively
charged) and viewed under a confocal microscope. The nucleus was stained blue with DAPI.
scSOX9 induced proliferation and chondrogenesis of MSC
MSC were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and low glucose (1.5 g/l) only or with addi-
tion of scGFP or scSOX9 or a cocktail of growth factors (GF) (containing 10% of ITS Premix
Tissue Culture Supplement (Becton Dickson), 10−7 M dexamethasone and 10 ng/ml of trans-
forming growth factor-ß1) for 48 h [21]. The proliferation of MSC was evaluated by cell count-
ing. Human bone marrow MSC were cultured in DMEM Medium with high glucose (4.5g/l)
(DMEM-HG) in a 96 well flat-bottomed plate. The cells were treated with or without 10 μg/ml
scSOX9 or a cocktail of growth factors in high glucose DMEM containing 1% FBS. After 24
hours, culture medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS and high glucose with no
additional scSOX9 was added. Culture was maintained for 21 days. MSC were stained with
Toluidine blue on plate for aggrecan at 7 day, 14 days, and 21 days.
scSOX9 delivery into MSC by a bilayer collagen membrane
We next tested the bioactivity of scSOX9 in vivo in a rabbit cartilage injury model. A commer-
cial bilayer collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland) was proposed

 to serve as a carrier for scSox9 to be administered at the site of microfracture. We first tested
the collagen membrane for adhesion and release of scSox9. A collagen membrane at 4 mm in
diameter was soaked in 25 μl of 100 μg/ml of scSOX9 solution for one hour. Green fluores-
cence was grossly visible on the collagen membrane. The membrane was taken out and
scSOX9 protein remained in the solution was measured with a spectrophotometer at 497 nm;
scSOX9 bound to the membrane was calculated. Collagen membrane bound scSOX9 was
rinsed with PBS containing 20 units/ml of heparin (pH7.4) for 1 hour. The amount of scSOX9
released from the membrane was calculated by measuring scSOX9 in the solution.
The efficiency of scSOX9 delivery into MSC in vivo was assessed. A cylindrical osteochon-
dral defect (also referred as cartilage defect in the literature) of 4 mm in diameter and 3 mm in
depth was created in patellar groove of the femur as described [11, 22, 23]. Microfracture was
created using 0.9 mm Kirschner wire (see details below) and bleeding of bone marrow was
allowed to fully fill the defect. A collagen membrane harboring scSOX9 was secured to cover
the defect. One hour later, the bone marrow clot from the defect was harvested, minced and
digested with streptokinase as described [24]. An average, 30 μl of bone marrow clot was
recovered from each defect (the calculated volume of each defect was 37.68 μl). The digested
bone marrow cell suspension was washed with PBS containing 20 units/ml of heparin to elimi-
nate cell membrane bound scSOX9, and stained with antibodies against CD90-APC, CD11b-
PE, CD79a-PE and MHC-DR-PE (Ad Serotec) for 30 minutes. After red blood cells were lysed
the cells were analyzed on flow cytometry for delivery of scSOX9 into MSC. MSC was defined
as CD90+/CD11b-/CD79a-/DR-. GFP positive cells indicated that scSOX9 entered MSC.
Real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry
Human bone marrow MSC were cultured with DMEM containing 1% FBS and high glucose
(4.5g/l) with addition of 10 μg/ml of scGFP or 10 μg/ml of scSOX9 or a cocktail of growth factors
(GF) for indicated time points. RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was performed with TaqMan
probe based analysis assay for collagen (Col) type I, II and X mRNA expression. Briefly, total
RNA is extracted and contaminating DNA is removed. A two-step RT-PCR reaction employed
200 ng total RNA per 10 μl reaction with a mix of random and oligo-dT primers, using Super-
Script III Reverse Transcriptase. RT-PCR is performed and primers for gene expression is pur-
chased pre-designed from Life Technology (collagen type I COL1A1 Hs00164004_m1, COL2A1
Hs00264051_m1, COL10A1 Hs00166657_m1, SOX9 Hs01001343_g1, SOX5 Hs01425825_cn
and SOX6 Hs00264525_m1). The efficiency of amplification is determined for each primer set
from serial dilutions. mRNA expression was relative to GAPDH; scSOX9 and GF treated were
compared to scGFP treated. Data are presented as fold change relative to control samples.
mRNA expression is normalized to GAPDH [25]. At day 14, aggregates were harvested and
snap-frozen. Matrix collagen content expression at protein level in cells was analyzed by immu-
nohistochemistry. Cryostat sections were blocked with PBS containing 2% normal goat serum
for 1 hour, then incubated with a mouse anti-human collage II monoclonal antibody for 16
hours at 4˚C. This was followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxi-
dase. Staining was developed with peroxidase substrate AEC.
Osteochondral defect creation and microfracture
Rabbit model is commonly used in experimental cartilage injury and repair studies [11, 22, 23,
25, 26]. Mature female New Zealand white rabbits with body weight of 3.5–4.0 kg are used in
the study. Under intravenous anesthesia with 25 mg/kg pentobarbital, a medial para-patellar
skin incision is made to the right knee, and the knee joint is exposed via lateral dislocation of
the patella. A cylindrical osteochondral defect of 4 mm in diameter and 3 mm in depth is

 made at the patella groove of femur using a dermal biopsy stainless steel punch and manual
debridement as described [25, 26]. Microfracture is performed using a 0.9 mm Kirschner wire
tapped into the subchondral bone to a depth of approximately 3 mm until bleeding from the
hole is apparent [25, 26]. Three microfracture holes are created within each full thickness
chondral defect in a triangular configuration. The defect of cartilage was either left with no
treatment, treated with microfracture or microfracture with scSOX9 bound collagen mem-
brane (S2 Fig). A supercharged recombinant scSOX9 mutant, scSOX9-A76E, or scMyoD
(myogenic differentiation factor) bound collagen membrane, or collagen membrane only was
used as controls. Rabbits were set for free in movement and observed for 8 weeks without
restriction of movement.
Gross morphology assessment
Rabbits were euthanized by intravenous overdose of pentobarbital 8 weeks after surgery. The
entire knee was dissected and distal part of the femur was then extirpated. The samples from
each group were examined and photographed for evaluation in a blinded manner according to
the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic assessment scale for cartilage
repair (S1 Table) [27]. Percentage of the defect surface area covered with repaired tissue is cal-
culated as follows:
ðoriginal defect areaÞ � ðdefect area at sacrificeÞ=ðoriginal defect areaÞ � 100
Histological assessment
After gross examination, specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 48 hours, decalci-
fied in Calci-Clear (National Diagnostics) and then embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of
5 μm were cut horizontally along the maximum diameter of the repaired sites. Sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin O and fast green using standard protocols.
Histological analysis of cartilage repair was scored as described. Each of the categories was
reported separately according to the ICRS recommendation (S2 Table) [28, 29]. Safranin O
staining was assessed as described [30]. Histological analysis and safranin O staining were
scored in a blinded manner. The stained sections were coded for their in vivo treatment by an
independent laboratory technician (LL) and the coded sections were scored by two investiga-
tors (XZ and CQC).
Quantification of collagen contents in reparative tissue
To quantify the collagen contents, full thickness of cartilage was harvested using a curette from
each repaired defect of rabbit distal femurs. About 2 mg of cartilage was collected from each
area of cartilage repair. The cartilage was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground. This was
followed by treatment with guanidine hydrochloride to remove proteoglycan, then by diges-
tion with pepsin and elastase to solubilize collagen. Collagen type II and type I in the reparative
tissue were determined by ELISA Collagen Detection kits (Chondrex, Redmond, WA), accord-
ing to manufacturer instructions and as described [31]. All incubation procedures were per-
formed at 4˚C.
Statistics
Gross and histological scores were graded in a blinded manner and analyzed with one-way
ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis with Newman–Keuls Multiple Comparison Test.

 Student t test was applied for analysis of real-time PCR data. Differences of p<0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant. Analyses for gross morphology, histological assessment includ-
ing matrix content, and collagen type for the regenerated tissue at the sites of cartilage defect
were directly compared with normal articular cartilage adjacent to the defect sites.
Results and discussion
Penetration of scSOX9 Protein into HFF and MSC and promoted gene
expression
A bioactive SOX9 protein with the property of cell penetration was achieved by molecular
engineering. As shown in Fig A-D in S1 Fig, scSOX9 readily entered human foreskin fibroblast
(HFF) cells and bone marrow derived MSC. After one hour incubation with scSOX9, both
HFF cells and MSC showed intracellular expression of green fluorescence indicating entry of
scSOX9 into these cells. scSOX9 sustained in intracellular compartment of MSC for up to 7
days (Fig E and F in S1 Fig). Most of the full-length proteins are trapped in endosomes for
days. Some are cleaved and the SOX9 moiety escaped from endosomes and translocated into
the nuclei [16]. The green fluorescence may indicate the pool of full-length scSOX9 in the cyto-
plasm. On average scSOX9 was readily delivered into 96 ± 3% of MSC after 1 hour incubation
(Fig G in S1 Fig). Upon internalization, the GFP moiety was cleaved off and retained in endo-
some. The 11 arginine (11R) facilitates scSOX9 transduction into subcellular compartments
and nucleus. As shown in Fig H in S1 Fig, scSOX9 entered nucleus of MSC after GFP was off.
Functional property of scSOX9 has been further verified by in vitro cell culture of human bone
marrow derived MSC for their differentiation into chondrocytes. Possibly owing to its two
intrinsic nuclear-localization signals (NLS) and 11R tag, scSXO9 readily enters nucleus.
scSOX9 upregulated proliferation and chondrogenesis of MSC
scSOX9 was able to induce MSC proliferation and differentiation with no requirement of addi-
tional growth factors. The number of scSOX9-treated MSC was increased two folds after 48
hours in culture compared with that scGFP only treated MSC. scSOX9 alone without addition
of other growth factors was capable of inducing MSC chondrogenesis, similar to that induced
by the cocktail of growth factors in the standard protocol. As early as 48 hours, scSOX9-treated
MSC started to change morphology into chondrocyte like cells and this morphology main-
tained for 21 days in culture of the duration of experiment. Furthermore, while inducing MSC
morphology change, scSOX9 also induced increased expression of SOX5 and SOX9 and colla-
gen type II, but downregulated collagen type I and type X production (Fig 1 and Fig 2). This
composition of matrix collagen types is typical characteristics of articular chondrocytes.
scSOX9 delivery by a bilayer collagen membrane in vitro and in vivo
We next further tested the bioactivity of scSOX9 in vivo in a rabbit cartilage injury model. A
commercial bilayer collagen membrane (Bio-Gide), was used as a carrier for scSox9 to be
administered at the site of microfracture. We first tested the collagen membrane for adhesion
and release of scSox9 in vitro. A collagen membrane was soaked in scSOX9 solution. Green
fluorescence was grossly visible on the collagen membrane. By measuring scSOX9 remained in
the solution, it was calculated that collagen membrane bound 40–60% of the total scSOX9.
Release of scSOX9 from collagen membrane was tested by rinsing the membrane with PBS
containing heparin. Over 95% of scSOX9 bound on collagen membrane was released and re-
dissolved in solution.

 We then tested scSOX9 function in the cartilage defect repair model in New Zealand female
rabbits as described [11]. The efficiency of scSOX9 delivery into MSC in vivo was assessed first.
A cylindrical osteochondral defect was created in patellar groove of the femur as described [11,
22, 23]. Microfracture was created and bleeding of bone marrow was allowed to fully fill the
defect. A collagen membrane harboring scSOX9 was secured to cover the defect (S2 Fig). One
hour later, the bone marrow clot from the defect was harvested, minced and digested with
streptokinase as described [24]. On average, 30 μl of bone marrow clot was recovered from
each defect (the calculated volume of each defect was 37.68 μl). The digested bone marrow cell
suspension was washed with PBS containing heparin to eliminate cell membrane bound
scSOX9, and stained with fluorochrome labeled monoclonal antibodies to identify MSC:
CD90-APC, CD11b-PE, CD79a-PE and MHC-DR-PE (BIO-RAD). The cells were analyzed on
flow cytometry for delivery of scSOX9 into MSC. As shown in S3 Fig, MSC were defined as
Fig 1. scSOX9 induced increased expression of SOX5, SOX9 and collagen II but decreased
expression of collagen I and X. Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were cultured
with DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum and high glucose (4.5g/l) with addition of 10 μg/ml of scGFP or
10 μg/ml of scSOX9 or a cocktail of growth factors (GF) (see Material and Methods). RNA was extracted and
RT-PCR was performed with TaqMan probe based analysis assay for mRNA expression of SOX5, SOX6 and
SOX9 (A); and collagen (Col) type I, II and X (B). mRNA expression of collagen type I, II, X, SOX5, SOX6 and
SOX9 was relative to GAPDH; scSOX9 and GF treated were compared to scGFP treated. 1A: * p <0.05; **

 CD90+/CD11b-/CD79a-/DR- [32, 33] and comprised of about 0.015% of the total nucleated
bone marrow cells. The frequency of MSC in our bone marrow cell preparation was consistent
with previously estimated [34]. About 60% of MSC in the bone marrow clot were showing
GFP positive (S3 Fig) indicating that scSOX9 entered these cells. The efficiency of scSOX9
transfection is comparable to transgene expression mediated by rAVV in MSC [35].
Gross morphology assessment of cartilage repair
Gross appearance of regenerated tissue is shown in Fig 3 to demonstrate the gross morphology
assessment. DNA-dependent dimerization of SOX9 is required for SOX9 to mediate chondro-
genesis. A mutation of the dimerization domain, A76E results in loss of the chondrogenic
property of SOX9 which causes campomelic dysplasia in human [36, 37]. In order to ensure
that scSOX9 actively induce chondrognesis in vivo, we produced a scSOX9 with this mutation,
named scSOX9-A76E as a negative control.
The defect of cartilage was either left with no treatment, treated with microfracture, micro-
fracture with collagen membrane only, scSOX9-A76E bound collagen membrane, scMyoD
bound collagen membrane, or scSOX9 bound collagen membrane. In non-treated animals, a
large defect existed and the original defect area was uncovered (Fig 3A, a). In those treated
with microfracture only, the defect was largely filled with white soft tissue and the boundary
between normal cartilage and regenerated tissue was distinct (Fig 3A, b). Defect in microfrac-
ture with collagen membrane only treated had better coverage (Fig 3A, c). In microfracture
plus scMyoD treated, vacant position still existed and a part of the defect was covered by
uneven, a thin layer of fibrous tissue. Fissures existed on the surface of newly formed tissue in
the defect (Fig 3A, d). Similarly, in microfracture plus scSOX9-A76E showed poor coverage of
the defect (Fig 3A, e). In contrast, in microfracture plus scSOX9 treated, the entire original
defect was filled with glossy semitransparent repaired tissue that appeared to be smooth and
well-integrated with the surrounding tissues. The color and thickness of regenerated tissue
more resembled the adjacent normal cartilage (Fig 3A, f). The degree of cartilage repair was
assessed by ICRS macroscopic assessment scale for cartilage repair. This composite score
system consists of assessment of degree of defect repair, integration to border zone and

cells (MSC) was cultured with 10 μg/ml of scGFP (A and D) or scSOX9 (B and E) or a cock tail of growth
factor (GF) (C and F) in monolayer (A, B and C) or aggregate (D, E and F) for chondrogenesis. At day 14,
aggregates were harvested and snap-frozen. Cryostat sections were stained with a mouse anti-human
collage II monoclonal antibody. (Immunoperoxidase staining. Note the poorly formed aggregate by MSC

were seen in microfracture plus scSOX9 treated group than any other groups (Fig 3B) indicat-
ing that microfracture combined with scSOX9 significantly improved cartilage regeneration.
The percentage of regenerated tissue in the defect area was shown in Fig 3B, e.
Histological assessment of cartilage repair
After gross examination, all specimens were processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin O and fast green (Fig 4A and 4B) using stan-
dard protocols. Histological analysis showed that the quality of the regenerated tissues differed
depending on the treatment. As shown in Fig 4A, a, the joint surface of the defects in non-
treated group was still concave. A large area defect existed and was covered with little tissue. In
microfracture treated only (Fig 4A, b), the defect was filled with a larger amount of cartilage-
like tissue with cells arranged disorderly and the gap between the normal cartilage and regen-
erated tissue was apparent. The surface was irregular and concave areas could be observed. Saf-
ranin O staining was less positive. In collagen membrane treated, tissue appeared to be fibrous
like tissue with little or no Safranin O stating (Fig 4A, c; Fig 4B, c). In microfracture plus
scMyoD treated, the defect was filled with a mixture of fibrous tissue and cartilage-like tissue
as shown by hematoxylin and eosin and safranin O staining. The surface of the defects was still
concave, irregular or empty in the middle. Safranin O was partially and slightly positive or neg-
ative (Fig 4A, d; Fig 4B, d). In scSOX9-A76E treated group, some of the samples had partial
coverage (Fig 4A, e), histologically, these appeared cartilage like tissue and mixed with fibrous
tissue (Fig 4A, e; Fig 4B, e). In non-treated, microfracture only and microfracture plus scMyoD
or scSXO9-A76E treated, the boundary between normal cartilage and regenerated tissue was
distinct. Whereas, in microfracture plus scSOX9 treated (Fig 4A, f; Fig 4B, f), the defects were
mostly filled with hyaline-like cartilage with a regular surface that was well-integrated with the
native cartilage. The regenerated tissue thickness was similar to the surrounding normal tissue.
Hyaline-like cartilage regenerated tissue filled the entire defect. However, the tide mark is not
continuous compared to that in normal cartilage suggesting that repairing of the cartilage and
subchondral bone is incomplete or tissue remodeling is still ongoing. The junction gap was
not distinct. An abundance of cartilage matrix could be identified by Safranin O staining (Fig
4A, f; Fig 4B, f). Subchondral bone bridged over the defect in scSOX9 group.
The histological appearance of the repaired tissue in the scSOX9 group was significantly
improved compared to that of the other groups. For further identification of regenerated carti-
lage in different groups, high magnification observation and normal femur section stained
with hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin O were used for comparison (Fig 4B). The repaired
tissues in microfracture group were predominantly fibrocartilage (Fig 4B, b), as they were
slightly stained with Safranin O (Fig 4B, b). In contrast, the scSOX9 group contained defects
filled with hyaline-like cartilage that was stained with Safranin O and chondrocytes and
margin. Normal cartilage surface of the distal femur was used as reference (g). (B) Macroscopic assessment of

 cartilage lacuna existed (Fig 4B, f). The chondrocyte cell morphology, structural integrity, and
thickness of the positively stained tissue in the scSOX9 group more closely resembled normal
articular cartilage (Fig 4B, f, Fig 4B, g). Nonetheless, subtle difference between normal cartilage
and scSOX9 induced reparative tissue existed. The cellular density in scSOX9 induced repara-
tive tissue was higher than that in normal cartilage.
The overall tissue regeneration was quantified according to the ICRS Visual Histological
Assessment Scale as described [28, 29]. It is required that scores in each of the category is
reported separately and should not be summed [28]. Scores of the ICRS visual histological
scale of reparative cartilage were shown in Fig 5. The microfracture plus scSOX9 treated group
led to highest ICRS scores than any other group in the key components (Fig 5B, 5C and 5G).
Despite that microfracture and microfracture plus collagen membrane only achieved high
scores in Category “Surface”, which were comparable to that treated with microfracture plus
scSOX9, the reparative tissue in scSOX9 treated group had substantial higher scores in matrix
and cell distribution (Fig 5B and 5C). Categories “Matrix” and “Cell distribution” assess
whether the reparative tissue was resembling hyaline cartilage (S2 Table). “Cell population via-
bility” assesses reparative tissue cell viability. There was no difference found between treatment
groups (Fig 5D). “Subchondral bone” assesses subchondral bone remodeling. There was no
difference noted between treatment groups, but statistical difference was found between nor-
mal cartilage and the microfracture plus scSOX9 treated group (Fig 5E). This reflected effect of
microfracture which induces subchondral bone remodeling process during cartilage repair.
Cartilage mineralization within cartilage is a pathological phenomenon. Cartilage mineraliza-
tion was only noted in treatment groups of MyoD and scSOX9-A76E (Fig 5F). Cartilage matrix
contents of reparative tissue were assessed by Safranin O staining and quantification of colla-
gen types. The intensity of Safranin O staining directly reflects the amount of proteoglycan.
Microfracture plus scSOX9 treated achieved highest score compared with that in other treat-
ment groups, but the score was statistically significantly lower than that of normal cartilage
(Fig 5G). This suggests that reparative cartilage by microfracture plus scSOX9 treatment con-
tained a lower amount of proteoglycan than normal cartilage although the difference was
small. We next quantified content of collagen type I and type II in reparative tissue. As shown
in Fig 5H, the reparative tissue treated with microfracture combined with scSOX9 had highest
content of collagen type II and the ratio of type II and type I was similar to that in normal carti-
lage. All these results indicated that microfracture combined with scSOX9 induced a type of
reparative tissue most closely resembled hyaline cartilage.
Using MSC has been an attractive approach to articular cartilage repair [5] which is com-
monly conducted via gene transfer. Studies of gene transfer are typically of cell based and in
combination with tissue engineering. MSC are harvested from bone marrow, adipose tissue or
synovium of the joint and expanded and transfected in vitro with one of the chrondrogenic
growth factors. Then the modified MSC are transferred to the site of cartilage defect. Several
preclinical studies with animal models of cartilage injury have reported successful growth of
hyaline cartilage-like reparative tissue. But drawbacks have been associated with gene therapy
for cartilage repair. Gene therapy procedures are rather complex with in vitro culture and
transfection of MSC with vectors carrying candidate genes. Currently most effective gene
transfer is achieved with viral vectors, such as adenovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus and recombi-
nant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) [35]. Adenovirus is highly efficient for gene transfer but is
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphological evaluation (A, low magnification (x 40) and B, high
magnification (H&E stating x 200; Safranin O staining x 100). Safranin O and fast green staining was used to
assess matrix proteoglycan distribution (A and B). Note that non-treated cartilage injury did not grow
cartilage-like tissue to the surface of cartilage (B, a) (n = 4–11 in each group).

 toxic and immunogenic. Retrovirus and lentivirus are also highly efficient and can provide with
long term transgene expression, but have risk of insertional mutagenesis. Therefore, adenovirus,
retrovirus and lentivirus are not candidates for moving forward to use in humans. rAAV vectors
offer very high efficiency and long-term transgene expression with low immunogenicity. More-
over, rAAV vectors are capable of modifying the cells in situ in the extracellular matrix environ-
ment. Recently, Cucchiarini and Madry reported use of rAAV vector mediated direct gene
transfer for over expression of human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to improve early
repair of articular cartilage defects in vivo [38]. Thus, rAAV has become a promising vector for
clinical applications. But rAAV vectors are difficult to produce with limitation of gene size to be
transferred and potential serotype-restricted cell specificity [38]. On the other hand, non-viral
gene transfer combined with tissue engineering has been investigated for effects of overexpres-
sion of potential therapeutic genes in MSC. The major issues with non-viral gene transfer have
been low efficiency and complicated in vitro procedure [39, 40].

 Here we report a novel strategy for articular cartilage repair using cutting-edge molecular tech-
nology in combination with a procedure commonly performed in clinical practice. Bone marrow
derived MSC have the potential to form a variety of mesenchymal tissues including bone, tendon,
ligament, muscle and fat depending on the presence of cytokines or growth factors [41]. In vitro
studies have demonstrated that many growth factors are capable of promoting chondrogenic
differentiation of MSC. These include IGF-1, fibroblast growth factor-2, bone morphogenetic pro-
teins, transforming growth factor-ß (reviewed in [5]). Interestingly, all these growth factors induce
chondrogenesis of MSC via stimulation of SOX9 expression. SOX9 is transported actively into the
nucleus through the two distinct NLS and interact with a number of genes that are involved in
chondrogenesis. The cell penetrating protein, scSOX9 efficiently entered MSC and induced chon-
drogenesis. SOX9 nudges MSC towards chondrocytes. Maintenance of chondrocytes requires the
continuous expression of endogenous SOX9 and other transcription factors such as SOX5 and/or
SOX6 which co-operate with SOX9 in chondrogenesis [13]. Our results are in consistence with
this notion. Thus, scSOX9 could induce endogenous SOX9 and SOX5 gene expression in MSC in
vitro culture, but did not significantly induce SOX6 expression at 24 and 48 hours. In a recent
study, Liu and Lefebvre [42] analyzed cooperation between SOX9 and SOX5/SOX6 at genome-
wide level during chondrogenesis and revealed great overlap between SOX9 and SOX6 in binding
to super-enhancers associated with cartilage specific genes. SOX5 and SOX6 have largely redun-
dant functions in chondrogenesis. SOX9, with either SOX5 or SOX6 is sufficient to induce chon-
drogenesis. In our study, scSOX9 preferentially induces SOX5 instead of SOX6. This interesting
observation deserves further study, in particular in in vivo studies.
The ultimate hyaline-like cartilage induction by scSOX9 in vivo suggests that the same
mechanism was in operation during cartilage repair. However, this remains to be confirmed.
Chondrogenesis from MSC in vitro indicate that SOX9 is the master transcription factor and
this was confirmed by our study with scSOX9. It remains unknown whether scSOX9 is able to
turn on chondrogenesis of other cell types in vivo. Indeed, scSOX9 was able to enter other cell
types in the bone marrow other than MSC, but may not be able to induce chondrogenesis
since scSOX9 failed to induce chondrogenesis from fibroblasts. Nevertheless, it is likely that
scSOX9 administered at the site of cartilage injury may be able to enter adjacent chondrocytes
and chondrocyte progenitors at the superficial layer of cartilage. These progenitors have poten-
tial to generate chondrocytes de novo [43]. It is possible that scSOX9 also induce these chon-
drocyte progenitors to differentiate into chondrocytes and participate in cartilage repair. Our
knowledge about kinetics of SOX9 expression and its regulation of other genes in cartilage
repair is mostly extrapolated from cartilage development and in vitro cell culture studies [6–8,
14, 42]. It is largely unknown in vivo at what time point during MSC differentiation into chon-
drocytes SOX9 gene expression will be turned down. Our in vitro data demonstrated that
scSOX9 maintained in the MSC for up to 7 days (Fig F in S1 Fig) However, it is not clear
whether this will truly reflect the status of scSOX9 in vivo. Our on-going effort is to address
this issue in vivo in our rabbit model of cartilage injury and repair by assessing persistence of
exogenous scSOX9 and endogenous SOX9 expression by microarray analysis of gene expres-
sion by MSC and regenerated chondrocytes at different time points after administration of
scSOX9. Our in vivo model would allow further analysis of the kinetics of SOX9 and SOX5/
SOX6 expression induced by scSOX9 during cartilage repair and elucidation of interactions
between scSOX9, and endogenous SOX9, SOX5 and SOX6.
Conclusions
Regeneration of hyaline cartilage has been an attractive approach to cartilage repair. However,
current cartilage transplants and MSC based methods have significant drawbacks. Our

 approach took advantage of non-vial delivery of chondrogenesis master transcription factor
into bone marrow-derived MSC which are recruited to the site by microfracture. Microfracture
is an easy, simple, single stage procedure with low morbidity and low cost. By local application
of cell penetrating SOX9, we were able to significantly improve the quality of microfracture
induced cartilage repair. By morphological assessment, it is likely that scSOX9 had enhanced
the quality of microfracture by promoting MSC contained in bone marrow clot into chondro-
cytes in situ. Quantitative measurement of collagen type I and II contents indicate the reparative
cartilage tissue was consistent with hyaline cartilage. From the morphology analysis, the repara-
tive cartilage induced by scSOX9 is not completely matching the normal articular cartilage. The
non-continuous tide mark and relatively higher chondrocyte density suggest continuous tissue
remodeling. Nonetheless, our approach has substantially improved the short-term efficacy of
microfracture in generating genuine hyaline-like cartilage in situ although long-term observa-
tion is required to confirm the cartilage generated in this method is durable.
