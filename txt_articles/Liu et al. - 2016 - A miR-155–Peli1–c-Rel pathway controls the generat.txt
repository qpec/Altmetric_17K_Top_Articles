Germinal center (GC) response is one of the defining features 
of adaptive immunity. T and B cells interact in specialized 
structures called GCs that form within secondary lymphoid 
organs after encountering pathogens or vaccination. GC B 
cells undergo class switch recombination, somatic hypermu-
tation, affinity maturation, and differentiation into plasma 
cells and memory B cells. A distinct CD4+ effector 
T cell sub-
set, T follicular helper cells (Tfh cells), provides critical help 
to B cells in the GC response (Crotty, 2011). Recent studies 
suggest that Tfh cell differentiation and function are essential 
in the control of chronic virus infections (Fahey et al., 2011; 
Harker et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2013), whereas Tfh cell ex-
pansion has been observed in a subset of patients with auto-
immune diseases and several mouse models of autoimmunity 
and was shown to play a causative role in disease pathogen-
esis in some models (Linterman et al., 2009; Simpson et al., 
2010; Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, elucidating the cellular 
and molecular mechanisms underlying 
Tfh cell differentiation 
and function is of fundamental importance for the design of 
better vaccines and therapies aimed to boost antibody pro-
duction in infectious settings or to mute autoantibody pro-
duction in autoimmune diseases.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded 
small RNAs that regulate the expression of protein-coding 
genes by pairing with their target mRNAs and promoting 
their degradation or translational repression (Bartel, 2009). 
Hundreds of miRNAs are expressed in the immune system 
(Kuchen et al., 2010). Genetic studies have demonstrated that 
miRNAs are critical regulators of the GC response (Baum-
johann and Ansel, 2014). Thus, T cell–specific ablation of 
DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (Dgcr8), a crit-
ical subunit of the microprocessor complex that mediates 
the biogenesis of pre-miRNAs from the primary miRNA 
transcripts, results in severe defects in Tfh cell differentia-
tion (Baumjohann et al., 2013). Antigen-specific Dgcr8-de-
ficient CD4+ T cells exhibited impaired proliferation, failed 
MicroRNA (miRNA) deficiency impairs the generation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, but the contribution of individual miR-
NAs to this phenotype remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed deep sequencing analysis of miRNAs expressed 
in Tfh cells and identified a five-miRNA signature. Analyses of mutant mice deficient of these miRNAs revealed that miR-22 
and miR-183/96/182 are dispensable, but miR-155 is essential for the generation and function of Tfh cells. miR-155 defi-
ciency led to decreased proliferation specifically at the late stage of Tfh cell differentiation and reduced CD40 ligand (CD40L) 
expression on antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Mechanistically, miR-155 repressed the expression of Peli1, a ubiquitin ligase that 
promotes the degradation of the NF-κB family transcription factor c-Rel, which controls cellular proliferation and CD40L 
expression. Therefore, our study identifies a novel miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel pathway that specifically regulates Tfh cell generation 
and function.

to up-regulate Bcl6 and CXCR5, and were unable to enter 
B cell follicles during immune responses (Baumjohann et 
al., 2013). Recent studies of individual miRNA genes that 
regulate Tfh cell differentiation have been focused on the 
miR-17∼92 family miRNAs, which control the expression 
of Bcl6 and CXCR5 in antigen-specific CD4+ 
T cells, as well 
as their migration into B cell follicles. However, miR-17∼92 
family miRNA-deficient antigen-specific CD4+ T cells ex-
hibited normal in vivo proliferation, suggesting that other 
miRNA genes are responsible for controlling cellular pro-
liferation during Tfh cell differentiation (Baumjohann et al., 
2013; Kang et al., 2013).
In this study, we performed deep sequencing analysis of 
miRNAs expressed in Tfh cells and identified a five-miRNA 
signature that is highly induced upon Tfh cell differentia-
tion. Functional analyses of mutant mice deficient of these 
Tfh-specific miRNAs revealed that miR-155 promotes the 
generation and function of Tfh cells. Further mechanistic 
studies identified a miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel pathway that spe-
cifically controls the late stage proliferation of and CD40 li-
gand (CD40L) expression on Tfh cells.

Deep sequencing identifies a miRNA signature of Tfh cells
We hypothesized that, in addition to the miR-17∼92 family 
miRNAs, there are other miRNAs that play important roles in 
regulating the generation and function of 
Tfh cells. 
T
o identify 
these miRNAs, we performed small RNA deep sequencing 
analysis of pre-Tfh and 
Tfh cells sorted from mice immunized 
with OVA precipitated in alum together with LPS (OVA/
alum/LPS; Fig. 1 A and Table S1). Clustering of the top 60 
most variable miRNAs revealed that pre-Tfh and Tfh cells 
exhibited similar miRNA expression profiles, which are dis-
tinct from that of naive CD4+ T (CD4+CD44−CXCR5−PD-
1−) cells sorted from the same immunized mice (Fig. 1 B). 
Five miRNAs were found highly induced in pre-Tfh and 
Tfh 
cells, including miR-22, miR-148a, miR-182, miR-146a, 
and miR-155. T
o validate the small RNA deep sequencing 
results, we prepared naive CD4+ T cells, various T helper cell 
subsets, and regulatory T cells (T reg cells) in independent 
experiments and examined the expression of these five miR-
NAs, as well as signature transcription factors for these cell 
subsets, by quantitative RT
-PCR (Fig. 1, C and D). Indeed, 
all of these five miRNAs were highly induced upon differ-
entiation into pre-Tfh cells, and their expression levels were 
further increased in Tfh cells. We termed these five miRNAs 
the miRNA signature of Tfh cells.
miR-22 and miR-183/96/182 are dispensable for Tfh cell 
generation and function
Among the five miRNAs, KO mice were previously gener-
ated and reported for miR-22, miR-146a, miR-155, and the 
miR-183/96/182 miRNA cluster, which encodes for miR-
183, miR-96, and miR-182 (Rodriguez et al., 2007; Thai et 
al., 2007; Boldin et al., 2011; Gurha et al., 2012; Lumayag et 
al., 2013). miR-148a–deficient mice are currently not avail-
able. Recent studies of miR-146a–deficient mice showed that 
miR-146a played a negative role in the generation and ac-
cumulation of Tfh cells and GC B cells and that miR-146a 
repressed several Tfh cell–expressed genes (Hu et al., 2014; 
Pratama et al., 2015). T
o examine the functions of other Tfh 
cell signature miRNAs, we immunized mice deficient of 
miR-22 or the miR-183/96/182 cluster. It was previously 
reported that miR-182 is induced by IL-2 and plays a po-
tent role in promoting clonal expansion of activated helper 
T cells (Stittrich et al., 2010), suggesting that it may have an 
important function in Tfh cell generation. Surprisingly, the 
generation of Tfh cells was normal in both miR-22– and 
miR-183/96/182–deficient mice (Fig. 2, A and D). In ad-
dition, GC B cell formation and antigen-specific antibody 
production were not affected by the loss of miR-22 or miR-
183/96/182 (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). Therefore, miR-22 and 
the miR-183/96/182 cluster are dispensable for Tfh cell 
generation and function.
miR-155 deficiency in T cells leads to impaired 
generation of Tfh cells
Previous studies showed that miR-155 plays a critical role 
in controlling GC responses and Tfh cell generation, but the 
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly 
understood (Rodriguez et al., 2007; 
Thai et al., 2007; 
Vigorito 
et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2014). 
T
o investigate the 
T cell–intrinsic 
role of miR-155 in Tfh cell generation, we generated mixed 
BM chimeras with T cell–specific loss of miR-155, which 
were created by reconstituting sublethally irradiated Rag1−/− 
mice with 80% of Tcrb−/−Tcrd−/− (TCD) plus 20% of 
WT or 
miR-155−/− (KO) BM cells (Fig. 3 A). The Tcrb−/−Tcrd−/− 
mutation prevents the generation of T cells; therefore, T cells 
in the animals receiving miR-155−/− BM will be miR-155 
deficient (KO + TCD), whereas the recipients of WT BM 
will have WT T cells (WT + TCD). The 80:20 ratio favors 
reconstitution of all the other hematopoietic lineages from 
WT precursors. Both groups of chimeras have similar per-
centages and numbers of B and T cells (unpublished data). 
We immunized these mice with OVA/alum/LPS or 4-hy-
droxy-3-nitrophenyl (NP) linked to OVA precipitated in 
alum (NP-OVA/alum) to study the effect of T cell–specific 
miR-155 deficiency on GC reaction and antibody responses 
(Fig. 3 A). The KO + TCD chimeras showed severe defects 
in the generation of GC B and Tfh cells and produced de-
creased amounts of total and high-affinity NP-specific IgG1 
antibody (Fig. 3, B–D). The KO + TCD chimeras also had a 
defective secondary antibody response after reimmunization 
(Fig. 3 E), suggesting that miR-155 expression in T cells is 
required not only for the initial generation and function of 
Tfh cells, but also for the establishment of long-lived pro-
tective CD4+ T cell–dependent B cell responses. These mice 
produced NP-specific IgM antibody in amounts compara-
ble with that produced by WT + TCD chimeras (Fig. 3 D), 
suggesting that general B cell activation and plasma cell dif-

ferentiation were not affected by the absence of miR-155 ex-
pression in 
T cells. 
These results demonstrate a 
T cell–intrinsic 
requirement of miR-155 for the generation of Tfh cells and 
GC B cells, as well as the production of high-affinity and 
class-switched antibodies.
miR-155 is specifically required for the late stage of 
proliferation during Tfh cell differentiation
We introduced the transgene encoding the OVA-specific 
OT
-II 
TCR into miR-155−/− mice to study the effect of miR-
155 on antigen-specific CD4+ T cells during Tfh cell differ-
entiation (Barnden et al., 1998). We labeled naive CD45.2+ 
WT or miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ T cells with the cytosolic 
dye CFSE and adoptively transferred them into CD45.1+ 
WT 
recipients, immunized the recipients with OVA/alum, and an-
alyzed the transferred OT
-II CD4+ T cells in draining lymph 
nodes at various time points. The percentage of adoptively 
transferred miR-155−/− OT
-II cells among total CD4+ 
T cells 
was comparable with that of their WT counterparts on days 
2.5 and 3.5 after immunization but was drastically decreased 
by day 6.5, when both the percentage and absolute number of 
miR-155−/− OT
-II and CXCR5hiBcl6+ Tfh cells were three-
fold less than that of 
WT OT
-II cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Among 
miR-155−/− OT
-II cells, the frequency of CXCR5hiBcl6+ 
Tfh cells was comparable with that among WT OT
-II cells 
(Fig. 4 C). These data suggest that much fewer Tfh cells were 
generated from miR-155−/− OT
-II cells than from 
WT OT
-II 
cells because of the lower numbers of miR-155−/− OT
-II cells 
by day 6.5 (Fig. 4 B). 
The expression of 
Tfh cell markers, such 
as CXCR5, PD-1, and Bcl6, and activation markers, such as 
CD44 and inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), was mar-
ginally affected by miR-155 deficiency (unpublished data). 
The reduction in miR-155−/− OT
-II cells on day 6.5 could 
be caused by a decrease of cell proliferation, an increase of

cell death, or both. Examination of CFSE dilution showed 
that miR-155−/− OT
-II cells proliferated less than WT OT
-II 
cells between days 3.5 and 6.5 (Fig. 4, D and E), whereas cell 
death was not significantly affected by miR-155 deficiency 
(Fig. 4 E, bottom). These results prompted us to examine the 
de novo expansion of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells at differ-
ent stages of 
Tfh cell differentiation. In the same experimental 
setting as in Fig. 4 (A–D), BrdU was injected into immunized 
recipient mice 1 d before analysis to label cells undergoing 
proliferation, and OT
-II cells were analyzed on day 3 or 4.5 
for BrdU incorporation. Consistent with the CFSE dilution 
results (Fig. 4 D), miR-155−/− OT
-II cells exhibited impaired 
proliferation between days 3.5 and 4.5 but not between days 
2 and 3 after immunization (Fig. 4 F). We also examined the 
location of miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ cells in draining lymph 
nodes during immune responses. Consistent with their re-
duced frequency, the density of miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ 
cells (identified by CD45.2 staining) in draining lymph nodes 
was much lower than that of WT OT
-II CD4+ cells (Fig. 4, 
G and H). The reduction in miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ cell 
density was found in both B and T cell zones, suggesting that 
the migration of CD4+ cells from the T cell zone into B cell 
follicles is not affected by miR-155 deficiency (Fig. 4, G and 
H). Together, these results reveal a critical role of miR-155 in 
controlling the proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, 
specifically at the late stage of Tfh cell differentiation, but not 
their survival or migration.
miR-155 controls c-Rel and CD40L 
expression by targeting Peli1
Previous studies showed that the strength of TCR binding 
plays an important role in the Tfh cell differentiation pro-
gram, suggesting the functional importance of initial T cell 
activation in the generation of Tfh cells (Fazilleau et al., 2009; 
Tubo et al., 2013). T
o elucidate the molecular mechanisms 
through which miR-155 controls the generation of Tfh cells, 
we first investigated whether miR-155 deficiency affects T 
cell activation by determining IL-2 production and expres-
sion of activation markers. TCR- and CD28-mediated IL-2 
production by miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells was largely nor-
mal (unpublished data). The expression of activation markers 
such as CD25, CD44, CD69, and ICOS was comparable be-
tween miR-155−/− and WT CD4+ T cells (unpublished data). 
Surface expression of CD71 (transferrin receptor) on miR-
155−/− CD4+ 
T cells showed a slight reduction, which did not 
reach statistical significance (unpublished data). In contrast, 
surface expression of CD40L, which is essential for T cell–B 
cell interaction during GC response (Crotty, 2011), on miR-
155−/− CD4+ T cells was reduced to 64.5% (16 h) and 50% 
(40 h) of WT levels (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, miR-155 specif-
ically regulates CD40L expression during T cell activation.
It was previously reported that NF-κB binds to the 
distal end of the CD40L promoter and up-regulates CD40L 
transcription (Srahna et al., 2001; Schubert et al., 2002; Pham 
et al., 2005). miR-155 may control CD40L expression by 
regulating the activity of NF-κB transcription factors. T
o test 
this hypothesis, we examined nuclear accumulation of NF-κB 
family members during T cell activation. The nuclear pro-
tein levels of RelA (p65) and RelB were normal in activated 
miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells, whereas nuclear accumulation of 
c-Rel was much lower in these cells than in WT cells (Fig. 5, 
B and C). As c-Rel also regulates T cell proliferation in a 
dosage-dependent manner (Köntgen et al., 1995), it is very 
likely that miR-155 controls both CD40L expression and the 
proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells by regulating 
nuclear accumulation of c-Rel.
T
o gain insights into the molecular pathway through 
which miR-155 controls c-Rel and CD40L expression, we 
analyzed the list of miR-155 target genes experimentally 
identified by using differential high-throughput sequencing 
of RNA isolated by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation 
(CLIP) of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) in activated CD4+ T cells 
(Loeb et al., 2012). We looked for potential miR-155 target 
genes implicated in the regulation of NF-κB activation in 
T cells. Peli1 was selected because it acts as an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase of c-Rel and negatively regulates nuclear accumulation 
of c-Rel by promoting its degradation (Chang et al., 2011). 
There is one evolutionarily conserved miR-155 binding site 
in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the Peli1 mRNA. 
Ago2 binding to this site was significantly reduced in miR-
155−/− CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that it is a bona 
fide miR-155 target site. T
o demonstrate direct regulation of 
Peli1 by miR-155, we performed a dual-luciferase reporter 
assay. A Peli1 3′UTR fragment containing the miR-155 
binding site was cloned into the expression vector psiCHE 
CK2, which encodes the Renilla luciferase controlled by the 
cloned 3′UTR. The resulting construct was cotransfected in 
HEK293 cells with an expression vector encoding miR-155, 
and regulation of protein expression by miR-155 was mea-
sured by luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 5 E, miR-155 
significantly reduced protein expression through the Peli1 
3′UTR. When the miR-155 binding site was mutated, the

reduction in protein expression was abolished, indicating that 
miR-155 suppresses the expression of Peli1 through its cog-
nate binding site in the Peli1 3′UTR.
Consistent with miR-155 suppression of Peli1 expres-
sion and the promotion of c-Rel degradation by Peli1, in vitro 
activated miR-155−/− CD4+ 
T cells expressed more Peli1 and 
less c-Rel proteins than their WT counterparts (Fig. 5, F 
and G). We also examined the protein levels of a small num-
ber of other miR-155 target genes identified by differential 
high-throughput sequencing of CLIP (Loeb et al., 2012) and 
implicated in various aspects of T cell biology. The protein 
levels of Fbxo11 and SHIP1 were not affected by miR-155 
deficiency (unpublished data). Therefore, Peli1 represents an 
authentic target gene of miR-155 in this cellular context.
T
o further test the hypothesis that miR-155 regulates 
c-Rel and CD40L expression by suppressing the expres-
sion of Peli1, we used retrovirus (R
V)-encoded shRNA to 
knock down the expression of Peli1 and R
V-encoded c-Rel 
to overexpress c-Rel in miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells. R
V-Peli1 
shRNA restored Peli1 and c-Rel expression close to 
WT lev-
els (Fig. 5 H), whereas R
V–c-Rel increased c-Rel expression 
to a level that was slightly higher than the WT level (Fig. 5 I). 
Both Peli1 knockdown and c-Rel reexpression substantially 
restored CD40L expression in miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells 
(Fig. 5 J). Collectively, these results demonstrate that miR-
155 controls c-Rel and CD40L expression by suppressing the 
expression of its target gene, Peli1.
Restoration of Tfh cell generation and function by reducing 
Peli1 in miR-155−/− T cells
c-Rel and CD40L are critical regulators of the GC response 
(Crotty, 2011; Gilmore and Gerondakis, 2011). We next asked 
whether correcting Peli1 expression in miR-155−/− CD4+ T 
cells would rescue the GC response defects caused by miR-
155 deficiency in T cells. miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ T cells 
were transduced with R
V-Peli1 shRNA and transferred into 
TCD recipient mice, which were subsequently immunized 
with OVA/alum. Although WT OT
-II CD4+ T cells support 
the GC response in TCD mice, miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ T 
cells exhibited a severe reduction in cell numbers and an in-
ability to provide help to B cells (Fig. 6 A). Strikingly, knock-
ing down Peli1 expression rescued the B cell help ability of 
miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ T cells by ∼60–70%, as indicated 
by increased formation of GC B and Tfh cells, as well as by 
elevated miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ T and Tfh cell numbers 
(Fig. 6, 
A–C). 
Accordingly, the production of total and high-af-
finity NP-specific antibodies was largely restored (Fig. 6 D).
We next used a genetic approach to modulate Peli1 ex-
pression in miR-155−/− mice. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), 
miR-155−/−;Peli1+/− mice exhibited largely restored gener-
ation of Tfh and GC B cells on day 8 after OVA/alum/LPS 
immunization. T
o determine whether the effect of genetic 
rescue on Tfh generation is T cell intrinsic, we generated 
mixed BM chimera mice with mixed BM cells (TCD BM 
+ WT, miR-155−/−, or miR-155;Peli1+/− BM) in a Rag1−/− 
background and immunized the chimera mice with NP-
OVA/alum/LPS (Fig. 7 C). Heterozygous deletion of Peli1 
in miR-155−/− T cells substantially rescued the impaired Tfh 
cell generation caused by miR-155 deficiency (Fig. 7 D). 
Peli1 heterozygosity also restored Tfh function, as indicated 
by close to WT levels of GC B cell numbers (Fig. 7 E) and 
class-switched and affinity-matured antigen-specific antibod-
ies (Fig. 7 F). These results demonstrate that Peli1 is a major 
mediator of miR-155 function in CD4+ T cells to control 
Tfh cell generation, GC response, and antibody production.
Reexpression of c-Rel restores Tfh cell generation and 
function of miR-155–deficient T cells
It was previously reported that germline deletion of the Rel 
gene (encoding c-Rel) caused severely compromised B and 
T cell proliferation and antibody production and that condi-
tional deletion of c-Rel in activated B cells led to impaired 
production of high-affinity antibodies because of the collapse 
of established GCs (Köntgen et al., 1995; Heise et al., 2014). 
However, the function of c-Rel in the generation and func-
tion of Tfh cells remains unclear. As we found that the c-Rel 
protein levels in CD4+ T cells is controlled by miR-155 via 
Peli1 and that c-Rel modulates CD4+ T cell expression of 
CD40L, which is critical for the function of Tfh cells during 
the GC response, we speculated that the c-Rel protein level 
in CD4+ T cells is critical for Tfh cell generation and func-
tion.

WT, Rel+/−, and Rel−/− mice with NP-OVA/
alum/LPS. As shown in Fig. 8 (A and B), Rel−/− mice ex-
hibited drastically reduced numbers of Tfh and GC B cells, 
whereas Rel+/− mice had similar but milder phenotypes. 
These results suggest that c-Rel controls Tfh cell generation 
and function in a dose-dependent manner.

We hypothesized that impaired Tfh cell generation and 
function in miR-155−/− mice is mainly caused by reduced 
c-Rel protein levels in CD4+ T cells. T
o test this hypothesis, 
we attempted to rescue the 
Tfh cell defects by restoring c-Rel 
protein levels in miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells. We transduced 
miR-155−/− OT
-II CD4+ 
T cells with a c-Rel–expressing R
V
, 
adoptively transferred them into TCD mice, and immunized 
the recipient mice with NP-OVA/alum. Strikingly, retroviral 
expression of c-Rel completely restored the generation and 
function of Tfh cells from miR-155−/− OT
-II cells (Fig. 8, 
C–E), as well as the production of class-switched and affini-
ty-matured antigen-specific antibodies (Fig. 8 F). Collectively, 
these results demonstrated that the miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel 
pathway plays a critical role in controlling the generation 
and function of Tfh cells.
The miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel pathway is dispensable for the 
generation of cytotoxic CD8, Th1, and Th17 cells
Previous studies showed that miR-155 plays critical roles in 
other immune cells, such as cytotoxic CD8+ 
T cells, 
Th1 cells, 
and Th17 cells (O’Connell et al., 2010; Dudda et al., 2013; 
Gracias et al., 2013; Escobar et al., 2014). 
T
o examine whether 
Peli1 functions as a key miR-155 target gene in these cell 
contexts, WT, miR-155−/−, and miR155−/−;Peli1+/− mice 
were challenged with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 
(LCMV) 
Armstrong, whose clearance requires intact cytotoxic 
CD8+ T cell function. As shown in Fig. 9 (A and B), miR-
155−/− mice showed compromised generation of IFN-γ–pro-
ducing effector CD8+ T cells, but this defect was not rescued 
in miR-155−/−;Peli1+/− mice. 
These mice were also examined 
in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 
model to study whether the miR-155–Peli1 axis functions 
in the generation of 
Th1 and 
Th17 cells. Consistent with pre-
vious studies, miR-155−/− mice were defective in the gen-
eration of both Th1 and Th17 cells (O’Connell et al., 2010; 
Escobar et al., 2014). Heterozygous deletion of Peli1 cannot 
rescue these defects (Fig. 9, C and D). Collectively, these re-
sults showed that miR-155 regulation of Peli1 is dispensable 
for the generation of cytotoxic CD8+ T, Th1, and Th17 cells, 
thereby highlighting the functional specificity of the miR-
155–Peli1 pathway in regulating the generation of Tfh cells.

A previous study has shown that miRNAs control several fac-
ets of Tfh cell differentiation, including cellular proliferation, 
up-regulation of CXCR5 and Bcl6, and migration of CD4+ 
T cells into B cell follicles (Baumjohann et al., 2013). Recent 
studies from us and other investigators found that the miR-
17∼92 family miRNAs regulate the expression of CXCR5 
and Bcl6, as well as CD4+ T cell migration into B cell folli-
cles, but not proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells 
(Baumjohann et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2013), suggesting that 
additional miRNAs regulate the generation and function of 
Tfh cells. In the present study, we performed the first deep 
sequencing analysis of miRNA expression profiles of pre-Tfh 
and Tfh cells and identified five miRNAs that are highly in-
duced upon Tfh cell differentiation. They include miR-22, 
miR-148a, miR-182, miR-146a, and miR-155.
By analyzing Tfh cell generation, GC B cell forma-
tion, and production of class-switched antibodies in mutant 
mice deficient of these individual miRNA genes, we found 
that miR-22 and miR-183/96/182 are dispensable, whereas 
miR-155 is essential for Tfh cell generation and function. 
This result is surprising because miR-182 was previously re-
ported to play a potent role in promoting clonal expansion 
of activated Th cells (Stittrich et al., 2010), an integral com-
ponent of the Tfh cell differentiation program. As miRNAs 
encoded by this cluster are highly induced in several Th cell 
subsets (Fig. 1 C; Kuchen et al., 2010), it is possible that they 
play critical roles in some of these cellular contexts. Indeed, 
results from our collaborators showed that miR-183/96/182 
regulates pathogenic cytokine expression during Th17 cell 
development (Ichiyama et al., 2016). Studies from other in-
vestigators showed that miR-146a plays a negative role in 
Tfh 
cell generation and accumulation, likely through suppressing 
several Tfh cell–expressing genes (Hu et al., 2014; Pratama et 
al., 2015). The potential role of miR-148a, another Tfh-spe-
cific miRNA, in Tfh cell generation and function remains to 
be explored. This awaits the creation and analysis of mutant 
mice deficient of this gene.
This study identified the miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel axis as 
a novel pathway that plays critical roles in CD4+ T cells to 
control the generation and function of Tfh cells by regulating 
their proliferation specifically at the late stage of Tfh cell dif-
ferentiation and CD40L expression on these cells. The nexus 
point of this pathway is the control of c-Rel protein levels 
by miR-155 and Peli1. Unlike other NF-κB family mem-
bers that are broadly expressed, high levels of c-Rel are found 
primarily in B and T cells (Gilmore and Gerondakis, 2011). 
c-Rel is not essential for normal hematopoiesis and lymph-
opoiesis. Instead, it is required for several functions in mature 
T and B cells. c-Rel–deficient T and B cells are severely im-
miR-155–binding site. (F and G) Immunoblot analysis of Peli1, c-Rel, and β-actin expression in naive CD4+ T cells stimulated with 5 µg/ml anti-CD3 and 2 µg/

paired in cellular proliferation in response to various stimuli 
(Köntgen et al., 1995), whereas c-Rel−/− mice exhibit defec-
tive GC response and production of class-switched antibodies 
(Chen et al., 2010). The functions of c-Rel are very sensitive 
to its gene dosage. c-Rel heterozygosity leads to defects at the 
cellular and animal levels that are similar to, but milder than, 
that caused by a complete loss of c-Rel (Köntgen et al., 1995). 
The critical functions of c-Rel in lymphocytes and its haplo-
insufficiency make it an ideal target for miR-155 and Peli1. 
miR-155, Peli1, and c-Rel are all strongly induced upon T 
cell activation by the engagement of 
TCR and co-stimulation 
molecules (Haasch et al., 2002; Thai et al., 2007; Chang et al., 
2011). The results presented in this study show that miR-
155 sets the Peli1 expression level in a proper range to allow 
the optimal induction of c-Rel, whose expression must be 
tightly controlled. Inadequate expression of c-Rel results in 
impaired B and 
T cell activation, as well as diminished GC re-
sponse and antibody production (Köntgen et al., 1995; Chen 
et al., 2010), whereas exaggerated c-Rel expression is asso-
ciated with autoimmune diseases and lymphomas (Gilmore 
and Gerondakis, 2011). In the present study, we showed that 
c-Rel is a dose-dependent regulator of Tfh cell generation 
and function. c-Rel controls two critical aspects of the Tfh 
cell program: proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells 
and expression of CD40L on these cells. In the absence of 
miR-155, CD4+ T cells express increased amounts of Peli1,

which leads to reduced nuclear accumulation of c-Rel and, 
therefore, impaired proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T 
cells at the late stage of Tfh cell differentiation and compro-
mised expression of CD40L on these cells.
The CD40L–CD40 interaction is essential for CD4+ T 
cells to provide critical help to B cells during the GC response 
(Crotty, 2011). Although CD40 is constitutively expressed on 
B cells and other antigen-presenting cells, CD40L is tran-
siently expressed on CD4+ T cells upon activation (Crow and 
Kirou, 2001). Engagement of CD40 leads to B cell clonal 
expansion, GC formation, isotype switching, affinity matu-
ration, and generation of long-lived plasma cells (Quezada 
et al., 2004). CD40L expression is a limiting factor in the 
GC response (Pérez-Melgosa et al., 1999). Both the magni-
tude and duration of CD40L expression are subjected to tight 
regulation (Crow and Kirou, 2001). CD40L-deficient mice 
exhibit impaired 
T cell–dependent immune response and GC 
formation (Grewal et al., 1995; van Essen et al., 1995). CD40L 
deficiency in humans results in immunodeficiency associated 
with a severe defect in humoral immune response and a Tfh 
cell defect. In the absence of CD40L, T cells differentiate 
poorly into 
Tfh cells, and B cell–T cell interactions in the GC 
are impaired (Durandy et al., 2013). Conversely, in human 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient and mouse lupus 
models, CD40L expression on the 
T cell surface is much pro-
longed after activation. In addition, high levels of the soluble 
form of CD40L are found in SLE patient sera. Both the sur-
face and soluble forms of CD40L can activate autoimmune 
B cells and initiate autoantibody production in SLE (Crow 
and Kirou, 2001). Our study found that miR-155 specifically 
controls CD40L expression on CD4+ T cells. In the absence 
of miR-155, activated CD4+ T cells express ∼50–65% of WT 
levels of CD40L. A previous study showed that CD40Ltg+ 
mice exhibited a 1.1–2-fold increase in CD40L expression 
on activated T cells, and this led to a twofold increase in the 
production of antigen-specific high-affinity IgG1 antibody 
(Pérez-Melgosa et al., 1999). Conversely, mutant mice with 
T cell–specific transgenic expression of a dominant-negative 
TFE3 protein exhibited reduced CD40L expression on acti-
vated CD4+ T cells, which resulted in impaired GC forma-
tion and a drastic decrease in the production of class-switched 
antibodies (Huan et al., 2006). Considering the high sensi-
tivity of GC response to CD40L expression levels on CD4+ 
T cells, it is likely that the reduction in CD40L expression 
on miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells contributes to impaired GC 
response in miR-155−/− mice.
Our results demonstrate that Peli1 is a key functional 
target gene of miR-155 in CD4+ T cells to regulate Tfh 
cell generation and function. A previous study has shown 
that deletion of Peli1 causes hyperactivation of T cells, and 
Peli1−/− mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diseases 
characterized by multiorgan inflammation and autoantibody 
production (Chang et al., 2011). Peli1 exerts its functions in 
T cells mainly through promoting the degradation of c-Rel 
protein and thereby preventing exaggerated accumulation of 
c-Rel in the nucleus. miR-155−/− CD4+ T cells express in-
creased amounts of Peli1 protein, and correcting Peli1 ex-
pression to WT levels by shRNA knockdown substantially 
rescued GC B cell formation and antibody responses. Fur-
thermore, genetic ablation of one copy of the Peli1 gene in 
miR-155−/− mice substantially restored the generation and 
function of Tfh cells. These data demonstrate that miR-155 
regulation of Peli1 plays a major role in mediating miR-155 
control of Tfh cell generation and function.
miR-155 is highly induced upon the activation of 
T and 
B cells and plays critical roles in the immune system (Vigorito 
et al., 2013). Importantly, miR-155 does not control the gen-
eral lymphocyte activation and proliferation program. It affects 
immune responses in a cell type– and context-specific manner, 
likely through regulating different downstream target genes 
and pathways in different cell subsets and biological processes 
(Lu et al., 2015). Thus, miR-155 promotes the differentiation 
and accumulation of Th17 cells in EAE through regulating 
Jarid2 and Socs1 (O’Connell et al., 2010; Escobar et al., 2014; 
Lu et al., 2015), inhibits 
Th2 cell differentiation through c-Maf 
(Rodriguez et al., 2007; 
Thai et al., 2007), controls the compet-
itive fitness of 
T reg cells through Socs1 (Lu et al., 2009, 2015), 
and regulates B cell differentiation into plasma cells through 
PU.1 (Vigorito et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2014). In this study, we 
found that miR-155 is highly expressed in pre-Tfh and Tfh 
cells and plays an essential role in the generation and function 
of Tfh cells. Mechanistically, it controls cellular proliferation 
at a late stage of Tfh cell differentiation, as well as CD40L 
expression, through a novel miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel pathway. 
Importantly, this pathway is dispensable for the generation of 
cytotoxic CD8+ T, Th1, and Th17 cells, highlighting its spec-
ificity in regulating the generation and function of Tfh cells.
In summary, our study identified a five-miRNA signa-
ture of Tfh cells, found that miR-22 and miR-183/96/182 
are dispensable in Tfh cells, and established the miR-155–
Peli1–c-Rel axis as an important pathway that regulates the 
generation and function of 
Tfh cells. In the long run, manipu-
lating this pathway may help us to design better ways to boost 
immune responses to fight pathogen infections and to atten-
uate autoantibody production to treat autoimmune diseases.

 A miR-155–Peli1–c-Rel pathway controls Tfh cells | Liu et al.
1916
(CD4+CD44−CXCR5−PD1−), pre-Tfh (CD4+CXCR5intP-
D1lo), and 
Tfh (CD4+CXCR5hiPD1hi) cells were FACS sorted 
from splenocytes. T
otal RNA was extracted using TRIzol re-
agent and subjected to standard small RNA deep sequencing 
analysis. In brief, small RNA in the range of 18–35 nucle-
otides was isolated by denaturing PAGE. 5′ and 3′ adapters 
were added to the small RNAs sequentially, followed by RT 
and PCR amplification. The amplified cDNA was gel puri-
fied and loaded on the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina) for 
deep sequencing according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The miRDeep software package was used to identify known 
miRNAs, predict novel miRNAs, and establish a miRNA 
expression profile for each sample (Friedländer et al., 2008).
T
o identify differentially expressed miRNAs, variances 
and SD among samples were first calculated using the row-
Vars function from the gene filter library in R. Then, the 
miRNA expression levels of the selected most differentially 
regulated 60 miRNAs were subjected to heat map analysis. 
In the heat map, these miRNAs are ordered and clustered 
together when the expression patterns are similar based on 
row dendrogram. The small RNA deep sequencing data have 
been deposited on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus da-
tabase (accession no. GSE72975).
Generation of Th cell subsets
CD62L+CD25− naive CD4+ 
T cells in the spleen were sorted 
by flow cytometers (FAC 
SAria; BD) from Foxp3-GFP (for 
Th0, Th1, and induced T reg [iT reg] cells; Fontenot et al., 
2005), IL-4–GFP (for Th2 cells; Mohrs et al., 2001), and IL-
17A–GFP mice (for Th17 cells; Jax stock 018472) and were 
stimulated for 4 d with 1 µg/ml anti-CD3 and mitomycin 
C (Sigma-Aldrich)–treated congenic allophycocyanin (APC) 
and 50 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 under Th0-, Th1-, 
iT reg–, Th2-, or Th17-polarizing conditions. Th cell polar-
ization mediums were supplemented as follows: for Th0 cell 
differentiation, 10 µg/ml anti–IL-4, 10 µg/ml anti–IL-12, and 
10 µg/ml anti–IFN-γ; for Th1 cell differentiation, 2 U/ml 
IL-12 and 10 µg/ml anti–IL-4; for Th2 cell differentiation, 
20 ng/ml IL-4, 10 µg/ml anti–IL-12, and 10 µg/ml anti–
IFN-γ; for iT reg cell differentiation, 1 ng/ml human 
TGF-β; 
and for 
Th17 cell differentiation, 2 ng/ml human 
TGF-β and 
20 ng/ml IL-6. Th cells were sorted by the expression of 
CD45 congenic marker and GFP reporter. Natural 
T reg cells 
were sorted directly from Foxp3-IRES (internal ribosomal 
entry site)-Thy1.1 mice (Liston et al., 2008). All antibodies 
were purchased from Bio X Cell, and recombinant cyto-
kines were from PeproTech.
Flow cytometry and intracellular staining
Single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleen or drain-
ing lymph nodes. Antibodies for cell surface markers were 
added, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4°C. For 
staining of CXCR5, single cells were stained with puri-
fied antibody to mouse CXCR5 (2G8; BD), followed by 
biotin-conjugated antibody to rat IgG2a (MRG2a-83; Bi-
oLegend) and streptavidin-APC. For staining of IL-2, cell 
surface markers were stained, and then cells were fixed for 
30 min at 4°C with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized 
with FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) containing 0.1% sa-
ponin (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated for 30 min at 4°C 
with APC-conjugated anti–IL-2. A Foxp3 staining kit was 
used to stain Bcl-6 according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions (eBioscience). Cells on which surface markers 
had been stained were fixed for 1 h at 4°C with fixation/
permeabilization buffer, washed with 1× permeabilization 
buffer, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 
anti–Bcl-6 in 1× permeabilization buffer. Apoptotic cells 
were assessed by using a CaspGLO 
WFluorescein Active 
Caspase-3 Staining kit according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions (eBioscience).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Mouse lymph nodes were washed with PBS and placed in 
optimal cutting temperature compound and snap frozen 
in dry ice. Cryosections of 6 µm in thickness were fixed 
with acetone and then stained with anti–mouse IgD (Bio-
Legend), anti–rat Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific), anti-CD45.2–APC (BioLegend), and Hoechst 33342 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired using a 
confocal microscope (780; Leica Biosystems) and analyzed 
with Imaris software (Bitplane).

retroviral vector provided by A. Rao (La Jolla Institute for Al-
lergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA; plasmid 17442; 
Addgene). 
S-Eco packaging cells were transfected by Fu-GENE HD re-
agent (Promega), and retroviral supernatants were collected 
48 h after transfection. Naive CD4+ (CD25−CD44−CD69−) 
T cells were purified as previously described (Kang et al., 
2013), stimulated with 5 µg/ml plated-bound anti-CD3 
(2C11; BioLegend) and 2 µg/ml anti-CD28 (37.51; BioLeg-
end) for 1 d, and then transduced by spin infection for 1 h at 
1,800 rpm with retroviral supernatants in the presence of 6 
µg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich).
Adoptive transfer of OT-II CD4+ T cells
106 naive WT or miR-155−/− CD4+CD45.2+ OT
-II CD4+ T 
cells were transferred into CD45.1+ C57BL/6 recipient mice 
by tail vein injection, followed by subcutaneous immuniza-
tion with 25 µg OVA/alum into the flank 1 d after cell trans-
fer. For the transfer of R
V-infected 
WT or miR-155−/− OT
-II 
CD4+ T cells, 106 Thy-1.1+ cells were purified by magnetic 
cell separation and transferred into Tcrb−/−Tcrd−/− mice. 1 d 
after cell transfer, recipient mice were immunized with 25 µg 
OVA/alum or NP-OVA/alum i.p.

Microtiter plates were coated with NP30-BSA or NP5-
BSA (10 µg/ml in PBS; LGC Biosearch Technologies) for 
measurement of total or high-affinity NP-specific anti-
body, respectively. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 
0.5% BSA in PBS. Serum samples were serially diluted in 
0.5% BSA in PBS and were incubated in blocked plates 
at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were incubated for 
2 h with biotin-conjugated anti-IgM (1020-08) or an-
ti-IgG1 (1070-08; SouthernBiotech) for 1 h with strepta-
vidin–alkaline phosphatase (Roche) and then with alkaline 
phosphatase substrate solution containing 4-nitro-phenyl 
phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) for color development, fol-
lowed by quantification on a microplate reader (VER 
SAmax; Molecular Devices).
Immunoblot analysis
Naive and stimulated CD4+ T cells were washed with PBS 
twice and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer 
(140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% 
Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) 
supplemented with Halt Protease & Phosphatase Inhibitor 
Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell lysates were re-
solved on SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% 
(wt/vol) BSA or nonfat milk in 1× 
Tris-buffered saline buffer 
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) followed by 
incubation overnight at 4°C.
Preparation of nuclear extracts
10 × 106 naive CD4+ cells before or after stimulation were 
harvested and resuspended in 100 µl of 0.1% NP-40 lysis buf-
fer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 
and 0.1% NP-40) and allowed to swell at 4°C for 5 min. The 
homogenates were centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, and the 
supernatant was stored at −80°C as cytoplasmic extracts. The 
nuclear pellet was washed twice with washing buffer (10 mM 
Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2) and re-
suspended in 20 µl radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer 
for Western blot analysis. After incubation at 4°C for 30 min 
with occasional vigorous vortex mixing, the nuclear extracts 
were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the su-
pernatant was frozen in aliquots at −80°C.
Luciferase reporter assay
Reporter constructs for the assay were prepared by cloning 
of a fragment of the Peli1 3′UTR (nucleotide position 1541–
2033) containing the putative miR-155 binding site into psi-
Check2 (Promega). 11 nucleotides of the miR-155 binding 
site spanning the miR-155 seed sequence (5′-ATT 
TGC 
ATT 
AA-3′) were removed to generate the mutated reporter con-
struct. 
The reporter constructs were cotransfected with empty 
or miR-155 expression plasmid into HEK293 cells. 24 h after 
transfection, luciferase activity was analyzed by using the Du-
al-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) according to 
the manufacturer’s guide.
EAE
Mice were injected subcutaneously with 100 µl of an emul-
sion containing 100 µg MOG35–55 peptide (MEV 
GWY 
RSP 
FSR
 
VVH 
LYR 
NGK) in complete Freund adjuvant. Mice 
were also injected i.p. with 200 ng pertussis toxin in 200 µl 
PBS on days 0 and 2 (Li et al., 2014).
Intracellular cytokine staining
For LCMV Armstrong–infected mice, splenocytes were 
harvested on day 8 after infection and stimulated for 5 h 
with 2 µg/ml MHC class I–restricted peptides of LCMV 
glycoprotein amino acids 33–41 (>99% pure; American 
Peptide and The Scripps Research Institute) in the pres-
ence of 4 µg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were 
fixed, permeabilized with 2% saponin, and stained intracel-
lularly with anti–IFN-γ (XMG1.2; BioLegend), anti-TNF 
(MP6-XT22), and anti–IL-2 (JES6-5H4; BioLegend). For 
EAE mice, draining lymph node cells were stimulated for 
5 h with 50 ng/ml PMA (eBioscience) and ionomycin 
(eBioscience) in the presence of brefeldin A and monensin 
(eBioscience). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 2% 
saponin and stained with anti–IFN-γ (XMG1.2) for Th1 
cell differentiation or IL-17A (TC11-18H10.1; BioLegend) 
for Th17 cell differentiation.
Statistics
P-values were determined by using two-tailed Student’s t 
tests. Statistical significance is displayed as *, P < 0.05; **, P < 
0.01; and ***, P < 0.001.
