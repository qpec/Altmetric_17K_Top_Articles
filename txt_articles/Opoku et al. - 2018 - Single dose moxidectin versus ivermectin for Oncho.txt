Summary
Background The morbidity and socioeconomic effects of onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease that is primarily endemic 
in sub-Saharan Africa, have motivated large morbidity and transmission control programmes. Annual community-
directed ivermectin treatment has substantially reduced prevalence. Elimination requires intensified efforts, including 
more efficacious treatments. We compared parasitological efficacy and safety of moxidectin and ivermectin.
Methods This double-blind, parallel group, superiority trial was done in four sites in Ghana, Liberia, and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. We enrolled participants (aged ≥12 years) with at least 10 Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae per 
mg skin who were not co-infected with Loa loa or lymphatic filariasis microfilaraemic. Participants were randomly 
allocated, stratified by sex and level of infection, to receive a single oral dose of 8 mg moxidectin or 150 µg/kg ivermectin 
as overencapsulated oral tablets. The primary efficacy outcome was skin microfilariae density 12 months post treatment. 
We used a mixed-effects model to test the hypothesis that the primary efficacy outcome in the moxidectin group was 
50% or less than that in the ivermectin group. The primary efficacy analysis population were all participants who 
received the study drug and completed 12-month follow-up (modified intention to treat). This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00790998.
Findings Between April 22, 2009, and Jan 23, 2011, we enrolled and allocated 998 participants to moxidectin and 
501 participants to ivermectin. 978 received moxidectin and 494 ivermectin, of which 947 and 480 were included in 
primary efficacy outcome analyses. At 12 months, skin microfilarial density (microfilariae per mg of skin) was lower 
in the moxidectin group (adjusted geometric mean 0·6 [95% CI 0·3–1·0]) than in the ivermectin group (4·5 [3·5–5·9]; 
difference 3·9 [3·2–4·9], p<0·0001; treatment difference 86%). Mazzotti (ie, efficacy-related) reactions occurred in 
967 (99%) of 978 moxidectin-treated participants and in 478 (97%) of 494 ivermectin-treated participants, including 
ocular reactions (moxidectin 113 [12%] participants and ivermectin 47 [10%] participants), laboratory reactions 
(788 [81%] and 415 [84%]), and clinical reactions (944 [97%] and 446 [90%]). No serious adverse events were considered 
to be related to treatment.
Interpretation Skin microfilarial loads (ie, parasite transmission reservoir) are lower after moxidectin treatment than 
after ivermectin treatment. Moxidectin would therefore be expected to reduce parasite transmission between 
treatment rounds more than ivermectin could, thus accelerating progress towards elimination.

Introduction
Onchocerciasis, which is an infectious disease caused by 
the helminth Onchocerca volvulus, affects some of the 
world’s most disadvantaged communities, 99% of which 
are in remote, rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa. Infective 
larvae, transmitted by the bite of Simulium spp, develop 
into macrofilariae that reside in subcutaneous and 
deep tissue nodules, and produce millions of micro-
filariae during their reproductive lifespan (9–11 years). 
Microfilariae live for 1–2 years primarily in the skin, from 
where they are taken up by the vectors, thus fuelling 
transmission. The host inflammatory reactions to dead 
microfilariae cause the dermatological, lymphatic, and 
ocular symptoms of onchocerciasis, including blindness

due to microfilariae invading the eyes. The morbidity and 
socioeconomic effects of onchocerciasis have motivated 
large control programmes based now on community-
directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) donated by 
Merck & Co (NJ, USA).1 At a dose of 150 µg/kg, 
ivermectin’s so-called microfilaricidal effect substantially 
reduces skin and ocular microfilarial densities within 
days to weeks. Ivermectin’s so-called embryostatic effect 
temporarily inhibits release of new microfilariae from the 
macro 
filariae, resulting in skin microfilarial densities 
1 year post treatment that are, on average, less than 40% of 
pretreatment values. This decrease reduces morbidity 
and parasite transmission.1,2
In 11 of 13 foci in South and Central America (population 
about 0·56 million), 17–25 twice yearly mass admin-
istrations of ivermectin (with several years of quarterly 
treatments in hyperendemic communities) have or are 
likely to have eliminated onchocerciasis.3,4 In 11 African 
countries, vector control, complemented later by mass 
administration of ivermectin, eliminated onchocerciasis as 
a public health problem. In the 20 other African countries 
where oncho 
cerciasis is endemic, elimination as a public 
health problem has been achieved in regions where annual 
CDTI was implemented with high participation of the 
population for many years.1 In some areas (population 
about 25·4 million), elimination of transmission might 
have been achieved or is achievable within a few years.5 
Where feasible, the target is to eliminate onchocerciasis in 
Africa by 2025.6
Questions remain about whether annual CDTI can 
eliminate onchocerciasis in areas with particularly high 
barriers to elimination, such as very high endemicity, 
loiasis co-endemicity that limits CDTI because of severe 
reactions in people with very high Loa loa microfilaraemia, 
and so-called suboptimal response to ivermectin. The 
WHO African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control 
(1995–2015) emphasised the need for alternative 
treatment strategies, including more efficacious drugs.6,7
Moxidectin is a milbemycin macrocyclic lactone that 
is not registered for human use. Like ivermectin (an 
avermectin macrocyclic lactone), moxidectin is widely 
used by veterinarians.8 Moxidectin is minimally metab-
olised, has low affinity to p-glycoprotein transporters,8 
and has a plasma half-life of 20–43 days in human 
beings,9–13 compared with less than 1 day for ivermectin.8 
In a phase 2 study14 in people infected with O volvulus, 
moxidectin 
reduced 
and 
maintained 
low 
skin 
microfilarial density (SmfD; microfilariae per mg skin) 
in more participants, faster, to lower levels, and for much 
longer than did ivermectin. Our phase 3 study was 
designed to determine whether, 1 year after one 
moxidectin dose, SmfD was 50% or less than the SmfD 
was after one dose of ivermectin (ie, a superiority margin 
of ≥50%), and to collect additional safety data.
Methods
Study design and participants
Between April, 2009, and May, 2012, we did a randomised, 
double-blind, single oral dose, ivermectin-controlled 
study of moxidectin for superiority in onchocerciasis 
endemic areas in Ghana (Nkwanta district), Liberia 
(Lofa county), and the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (Nord Ituri and Nord Kivu) without loiasis or 
previous CDTI.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evaluation of moxidectin for onchocerciasis control and 
elimination started with non-clinical pharmacology studies 
funded by TDR. At that time, elimination of onchocerciasis 
through mass administration of ivermectin was considered 
feasible in the small American foci, but not across Africa, which 
is where 99% of the at-risk population live. After external review 
of the non-clinical pharmacology and safety data, clinical 
evaluation of moxidectin began. The protocol for this study was 
based on one published and one unpublished healthy volunteer 
pharmacokinetic study and blinded safety data from the 
ongoing phase 2 study in people infected with Onchocerca 
volvulus in Ghana (now complete). No adverse events had 
occurred that would preclude administration in a larger study.
Added value of this study
This study confirmed the conclusions from the phase 2 study 
and five studies in healthy volunteers. Skin microfilarial densities 
were significantly lower after moxidectin than after ivermectin; 
the percentage of participants with undetectable microfilariae in 
skin was significantly higher after moxidectin than after 
ivermectin treatment to 18 months post treatment (final 
follow-up); and the safety profiles suggest moxidectin is 
suitable for mass treatment. Responses to ivermectin classified 
in areas with long-term ivermectin mass treatment as 
‘suboptimal’ occurred in each of the four study areas without 
previous community-directed ivermectin treatment. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Modelling and field studies done since the start of this study 
suggest that annual mass administration of ivermectin could 
eliminate onchocerciasis in many African foci, while other areas 
need alternative strategies, including more efficacious drugs. 
Furthermore, there are concerns about diminishing 
susceptibility of O volvulus to ivermectin’s embryostatic effect 
in areas of long-term use. The suboptimal responses to 
ivermectin we observed show that data on changes in the 
frequency of such responses with duration of community-
directed treatment with ivermectin are needed for conclusions 
about reduced O volvulus susceptibility or emerging resistance 
to ivermectin. Our data suggest that moxidectin could 
accelerate progress towards the elimination of onchocerciasis 
in Africa, including in areas with suboptimal responses 
to ivermectin.

We enrolled male and female volunteers aged 12 years 
or older, weighing 30 kg or more, who had 10 or more 
microfilariae per mg of skin. Participants with loiasis or 
lymphatic filariasis with an intensity of infection greater 
than 100 microfilariae per mL were to be excluded. Full 
eligibility criteria are shown in the appendix. 
Volunteers gave consent or assent (with parental 
consent) through signature or thumbprint in the presence 
of a literate witness. SmfD was measured in the villages or 
nearby health clinics by study staff. Volunteers who 
qualified for further screening were brought to one of the 
research centres (Hohoe, Ghana; Bolahun, Liberia; Rethy, 
Nord Ituri and Butembo, Nord Kivu, Democratic Republic 
of the Congo) for 3 days of screening. Those who were 
eligible stayed another 5 days for treatment and initial 
follow-up, and were brought to the centre for 1–2 days for 
each follow-up visit.
This study was approved by the Ghana Food and 
Drugs Authority; Ghana Health Service Ethics Review 
Committee; Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare; 
Ethics Committee of the Liberia Institute for Biomedical 
Research; Ministère de la Santé Publique of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ethics Committee of 
the Ecole de la Santé Publique Université de Kinshasa 
Democratic Republic of the Congo; and the WHO Ethics 
Review Committee. Study compliance with International 
Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines was monitored.7
Randomisation and masking
At each centre, a pharmacist randomised participants 
using sponsor-provided computer-generated random-
isation lists (block size 6) in a 2:1 ratio to 8 mg moxidectin 
or 150 µg/kg ivermectin, stratified by sex and level of 
infection (<20 vs ≥20 microfilariae per mg skin). 
Wyeth Research (NJ, USA) manufactured and provided 
2 mg moxidectin tablets, purchased 3 mg ivermectin 
tablets from Merck & Co, overencapsulated both 
tablet types, and prov 
ided matching placebo. For each 
partici 
pant, the pharma 
cists prepared a sealed envelope, 
labelled with participant identifiers, that contained either 
four moxidectin-containing capsules or two, three, or 
four ivermectin-containing capsules plus two, one, or 
zero placebo capsules (as required by participant weight).
Procedures
Each participant took the four capsules under obser-
vation. Clinical, ophthalmological, and laboratory exami-
nations were done pretreatment, during the first 5 days, 
and 0·5, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post treatment 
(appendix). Given that the primary efficacy outcome was 
assessed at 12 months (chosen because moxidectin 
would likely be used annually), a protocol amendment 
removed follow-up at 18 months because of resource 
limitations after TDR became the sole sponsor in 
July, 2011. This change affected 256 participants (ie, those 
with 18-month follow-up due after ethics committee 
approval of the protocol amendment).
To quantify SmfD, we took four skin snips (one 
from each iliac crest and calf) at screening and at 
months 1, 6, 12, and 18 using a Holth corneoscleral 
punch. We weighed each snip before incubation for 8 h 
or more in isotonic saline. We then counted the 
microfilariae using a microscope and calculated SmfD 
as the arithmetic mean of microfilariae per mg skin 
across all snips.
An ophthalmologist did ocular examinations (visual 
acuity, visual fields, colour vision, intraocular pressure, 
fundus examination, slit lamp examination of anterior 
segment, and counting of live microfilariae in anterior 
chambers, living and dead microfilariae in cornea, and 
punctate opacities) before treatment, on day 3 or 4 after 
treatment, and at months 1, 6, 12, and 18.
We did physical examinations and vital sign measure-
ments before treatment and at each follow up visit, 
and did serum biochemical, haematological, and urine 
analyses before treatment, on day 5 post treatment, and 
at months 0·5, 1, 3, and 6. We did an immunochromato-
graphic card test for lymphatic filariasis during screening 
and tested for microfilaraemia in those who were positive. 
 
Since none of the participants were microfilaraemic, post-
treatment tests were not conducted. We did one single-
sample Kato-Katz test for intestinal helminths before 
treatment and, in those who were positive, at month 1. 
Details on testing for Loa loa infection in the sites in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and requirements for 
Loa loa testing in Liberia where potential participants 
might have lived in a loiasis endemic area during the 
preceding civil conflicts are provided in the appendix.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was SmfD at 12 months. 
Secondary efficacy measures were SmfD at months 
1, 6, and 18, and the number of live microfilariae in anterior 
chambers at months 1, 6, 12, and 18 in participants with 
more than 10 live microfilariae in the anterior chambers 
across both eyes before treatment. Infection with intestinal 
helminths at month 1 was an exploratory outcome.
We assessed safety in terms of incidence of adverse 
events, including post-treatment changes in vital signs, 
symptoms, or laboratory values found through exam-
inations, questions to participants, or spontaneous re-
porting. International Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use criteria7 were used to determine whether adverse 
events were serious. We used the Onchocerciasis Chemo-
therapy Research Centre criteria (OCRC; appendix) to 
grade the severity of adverse events; these criteria were 
developed to grade symptoms of host inflammatory 
reactions to dead microfilariae. Such reactions present as 
symptoms of O volvulus infection and as adverse events 
after treatment with microfilaricidal drugs because of 
accelerated microfilariae death (ie, Mazzotti reactions).14–16

OCRC criteria for Mazzotti reactions differ substantially 
from National Cancer Institute criteria for grading 
similar events; OCRC criteria generally reflect much 
less severe symptoms grade for grade. National 
Cancer Institute criteria include need for medical inter-
vention for grade 2 sometimes, grade 3 frequently, and 
grade 4 nearly always, whereas most OCRC criteria 
grade 4 Mazzotti reactions require no intervention. For 
symptoms not included in OCRC criteria, we used 
National Cancer Institute criteria (version 2.0) or provided 
our own method-specific criteria (appendix). Adverse 
events were characterised as Mazzotti reactions, non-
Mazzotti adverse drug reactions, or adverse events not 
related to drugs on the basis of the temporal relationship 
to drug administration, participant general health, and 
known reactions to microfilaricidal or concomitant drugs. 
The characterisation of adverse events presented here is 
based on blinded, central review of all such data by the 
first author.14,17,18
Statistical analysis
SmfD post-ivermectin depends on pretreatment SmfD 
determined by factors unknown during study planning 
(eg, local endemicity, control history, and participant 
lifetime risk of infection and treatment history). Therefore, 
we used post-ivermectin SmfD at month 12 from two 
previ 
ous studies (32·49 [SD 2·35] microfilariae per snip; 
4·01 [2·41] microfilariae per mg) to calculate sample sizes 
to detect a difference of 50% or more in SmfD at 
month 12 with a two-sided Student’s t-test (α=0·05 and 
90% power with loge [SmfD + 1] transformation), assuming 
SmfD post moxidectin is 0·5 SmfD post ivermectin, and 
2:1 moxidectin:ivermectin random 
isation (appendix). Even 
adjusting the larger resulting sample size (184:92) for 
35% loss to follow-up was judged to give insufficient safety 
data. In consideration of the need for safety data, we 
planned for about 1000 participants in the moxidectin 
group and 500 in the ivermectin group to ensure that there 
was a high probability (moxidectin 0·99, ivermectin 0·92) 
for the detection of at least one adverse event with a true 
incidence of five in 1000,14 on the basis of the assumption 
that incidence follows a Poisson distribution.
We log transformed (y=loge [SmfD + 1]) SmfD before 
analysis. In all mixed-effects models, the site was the 
random effect. The percentage treatment difference was 
calculated as the difference in adjusted geometric means 
(GM) as a percentage of post-ivermectin adjusted GM.
For the primary efficacy endpoint of SmfD at 12 months, 
we used a mixed-effects model for comparisons. Baseline 
SmfD, treatment, sex, level of infection, treatment × sex, 
and treatment × level of infection interactions were fixed 
effects. Sensitivity analyses included a non-parametric 
model (included in the protocol) and, following peer 
review, a fixed-effects model and a linear mixed-effects 
model of percentage change from baseline (appendix).
For the longitudinal analysis of SmfD at months 
1, 6, 12, and 18, we used a mixed-effects model for 
rep 
eated measures with participant as the statistical 
unit, baseline SmfD, treatment, sex, level of infection, 
time, treatment × sex, treatment × level of infection, and 
treatment × time interaction as fixed effects, and time as a 
repeated effect for the four SmfD measurements. We 
compared the number of participants with undetectable 
SmfD by use of a mixed-effects logistic model with 
treatment, sex, and level of infection as fixed effects. We 
calculated adjusted odds ratios. We used a mixed-effects 
model to compare the percentage reduction from baseline 
of live microfilariae in the anterior chambers of the eyes 
at month 12 with sex, level of infection, treatment, 
treatment × sex, and treatment × level of infection as 
fixed effects.
We used the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Agencies 
(version 13.1) to code unrelated adverse events and adverse 
drug reactions. We used a specific dictionary (appendix) to

code Mazzotti reactions because the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Agencies distributes the same Mazzotti 
reactions (eg, pruritus) over several system organ classes 
or preferred terms, which compromises comparisons. To 
compare the overall number of participants with unrelated 
adverse events, adverse drug reactions, or Mazzotti 
reactions during the first 6 months post treatment, we 
used a two-tailed χ² test. We compared by system organ 
classes and preferred terms or by Mazzotti reactions 
cluster, group, and sign or symptom, maximum grade, 
and seriousness across all ages and by age group 
(adolescents [12–17 years] vs adults [≥18 years]). Since the 
frequency and severity of Mazzotti reactions can depend 
on pretreatment SmfD,19 we also analysed these reactions 
by pretreatment SmfD (<20, 20 to <50, 50 to <80, and 
≥80 microfilariae per mg). p values of 0·01 or lower were 
regarded as indicative of potential treatment differences, 
despite thousands of comparisons.
The primary population analysed was the modified 
intention-to-treat population (all participants who re 
ceived 
study drug). Descriptive statistics included only those with 
applicable data. Analysis of reductions in live microfilariae 
in anterior chambers included only those with more than 
ten live microfilariae in the anterior chambers across both 
eyes before treatment who had both eyes evaluated at 
month 12 (moxidectin group 131, ivermectin group 74).
We used SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) 
for statistical analyses. A data monitoring committee 
reviewed safety data during recruitment, including serious 
adverse events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.

Role of the funding source
The UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Pro-
gramme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases 
(TDR) funded this study. TDR staff partici 
pated in study 
design, data management, analysis plan, interpretation, 
and manuscript writing. The corres 
ponding author had 
full access to all data and made the final decision to submit 
for publication.
Because TDR was the sole sponsor of this study from 
July, 2011, resource limitations delayed availability of 
all results and dissemination at meetings to 2013–14. 
In 2014, the non-profit organisation Medicines Develop-
ment for Global Health assumed sponsorship. To ensure 
publication and regulatory submissions using the same 
database, publication preparation was delayed until after 
Medicines Development for Global Health had completed 
its blinded database review in 2016. The manuscript was 
finalised without Medicines Development for Global 
Health involvement.
Results
We recruited participants between April 22, 2009, and 
Jan 23, 2011. Of 4526 people screened, 1472 (33%) were 
treated (figure 1). Participants’ demographic character-
istics and pretreatment characteristics related to O volvulus 
are shown in table 1. We have included other pretreatment 
characteristics, descriptive statistics and analysis outputs 
for all efficacy endpoints, including sensitivity analyses, 
results for intestinal helminths, and detailed safety data 
analyses in the appendix.

Month 12 SmfD was lower in the moxidectin group 
(adjusted GM 0·6 microfilariae per mg [95% CI 0·3–1·0]) 
than in the ivermectin group (4·5 microfilariae per mg 
[3·5–5·9]; adjusted GM difference 3·9 microfilariae per 
mg [3·2–4·9], p<0·0001; treatment difference 86%). The 
difference in SmfD at month 12 was independent of 
sex (men 82%, women 91%), but differed between 
pretreatment level of infection (76% for <20 microfilariae 
per mg, 93% for ≥20 microfilariae per mg; p<0·0001; 
appendix).
SmfD was also lower at month 1 (by 86%), month 6 
(by 97%), and month 18 (by 76%) after treatment with 
moxidectin than with ivermectin (figure 2A).
The proportion of participants with undetectable SmfD 
was higher in the moxidectin group than in the ivermectin 
group (p<0·0001; figure 2B; appendix). The number of 
participants with undetectable SmfD from month 1 to 
month 12 was 360 (38%) of 938 in the moxidectin group 
and seven (2%) of 478 in the ivermectin group.
In each study area, the spread of post-treatment SmfD 
was greater among people treated with ivermectin 
compared with moxidectin (figure 3). For ivermectin, 
minimum SmfD from month 1 to month 12 was 1% or less 
of pretreatment SmfD in 64% of people and more 
than 10% of pretreatment SmfD in 11% of people. 
Maximum SmfD from month 1 to month 12 was 1% or 
less of pretreatment SmfD in 4% of people, more than 
20% in 44% of people, and more than 40% in 20% of 
people. For moxidectin, minimum SmfD from month 1 to 
month 12 was 1% or less of pretreatment SmfD in 100% of 
people. Maximum SmfD from month 1 to month 12 was 
1% or less of pretreatment SmfD in 58%, more than 
20% in 3% of people, and more than 40% in 1% of 
people (appendix).
In participants with more than 10 live microfilariae 
across the anterior chambers of both eyes before treatment, 
the number of these microfilariae decreased slowly from 
pretreatment to month 6. At month 12 in the moxidectin 
group, the number of partici 
pants without detectable 
microfilariae was 126 (96%) of 131; at month 18, this value 
was 113 (98%) of 115. In the ivermectin group, 62 (84%) of 
74 participants did not have detectable microfilariae at 
month 12; this value was 55 (90%) of 61 at month 18. The 
percentage reduction in live microfilariae in the anterior 
chambers from pretreatment to month 12 did not differ 
between the two treatments (p=0·13; appendix).
Both drugs were well tolerated. Table 2 shows 
participants with at least one adverse event during

the 6 months following treatment. None of the serious 
adverse events were related to the drugs given. In 
each treatment group, two participants died within 
6 months of the treatment for reasons unrelated to the 
study (appendix). 
The profiles of Mazzotti reactions after both treatments 
were similar when analysed by severity across all 
pretreatment SmfD (table 2) and by pretreatment SmfD to 
take into account that such reactions reflect host response 
to the microfilaricidal effect and their frequency and 
severity can increase with pretreatment SmfD (appendix).19 
Grade 4 clinical Mazzotti reactions (OCRC criteria) were 
more frequent among people treated with moxidectin 
than with ivermectin because severe symptomatic postural 
hypotension was more common in the moxidectin group 
(45 [5%] of 978 vs seven [1%] of 494). Severe sympto-
matic postural hypotension is diagnosed when a person, 
after 5 or more min in the supine position, is unable to 
stand up and be still for 2 min because of dizziness or 
weakness linked to a decrease in blood pressure. Such 
hypotension does not require intervention and resolves 
quickly after the individual lies down. People in the 
moxidectin group had severe symptomatic postural 
hypotension from treatment day to 2 days post treatment, 
compared with from 1–3 days post treatment in those 
treated with ivermectin.
The most frequent ocular Mazzotti reactions were 
pruritus (moxidectin 43 [4%] of 978 participants, 
ivermectin 12 [2%] of 494 participants), conjunctivitis 
(moxidectin 40 [4%] participants, ivermectin 15 [3%] 
participants), and eye pain (moxidectin 29 [3%] 
participants, ivermectin 8 [2%] participants). Fewer than 
1% of participants had eyelid swelling, ocular discomfort, 
tearing or watery eyes, blurred vision, and photophobia. 
Ocular Mazzotti reactions exceeding grade 1 occurred in 
1% or fewer participants in both treatment groups, the 
most frequent being eye pruritus (1%).
Discussion
Moxidectin was well tolerated without substantial adverse 
drug reactions, confirming data from the previous study in 
people infected with O volvulus14 and five studies in healthy 
volunteers.9–13 Severe symptomatic postural hypotension—
which resolves quickly without treatment—was the only 
efficacy-related OCRC criteria grade 4 reaction that was 
more common in the moxidectin than in the ivermectin 
group. Such hypotension was reported in up to 22% of

Data are n (%). The numbers of participants at a given grade within each category 
or subcategory of events do not sum up to the total number for that category or 
subcategory because some participants had different types of events with 
different grades within the same category or subcategory. For participants with 
more than one episode of the same type of event at different levels of severity, we 
recorded the most severe grade. Adverse events were classified as serious or 
non-serious and as non-Mazzotti adverse drug reactions (ie, treatment-related), 
Mazzotti reactions (ie, adverse events related to accelerated microfilarial death 
after treatment with microfilarial drugs), or unrelated adverse events as explained 
in the Methods. *Changes in laboratory values considered Mazzotti reactions are 
most frequently haematological (eosinopenia followed by eosinophilia, 
lymphocyte decrease followed by lymphocytosis) but might also affect serum 
biochemistry (most frequently aspartate and alanine aminotransferase; 
appendix). †p=0·010.

ivermectin-treated participants in clinical studies,17 but 
rarely in large-scale ivermectin treatment.19 Our data 
suggest that moxidectin is as compatible with mass drug 
administration as ivermectin is, which was given to more 
than 110 million people in 2014.20
The significantly lower SmfD (ie, parasite transmission 
reservoir) from month 1 to month 18 after moxidectin 
than after ivermectin—with 86% treatment difference 
at month 12—confirms our efficacy-related study 
hypothesis and is consistent with previous data.14 Reduced 
SmfD would lead to decreased parasite transmission and 
thus shorter time to onchocerciasis elimination with 
annual mass admin 
istration of moxidectin compared 
with ivermectin. Modelling of the phase 2 study data14 
estimated the number of years to preliminary operational 
thresholds for interrupting treatment (as defined by the 
African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control) to be 
30–40% lower with annual mass administration of 
moxidectin than with ivermectin and comparable with 
those modelled for twice yearly mass administration 
of ivermectin.21
Moxidectin would be particularly useful to accelerate the 
elimination of onchocerciasis in situations where there are 
operational barriers to mass drug administration (such as 
community accessibility, conflict or civil war, or health 
services support for communities), where precontrol 
endemicity was so high that infection prevalence is still 
high despite long-term CDTI, and where transmission 
seasons are long or have two peaks.21 Interventions can 
only be discontinued when the whole transmission zone 
(an area sharing a parasite population) meets the 
discontinuation criteria. Therefore, moxidectin could also 
be useful in situations where one area within a 
transmission zone needs to accelerate progress towards 
elimination to meet CDTI discontinuation criteria at the 
same time as other areas that have benefitted from earlier 
or better implemented CDTI (achieved, for example, 
through better advocacy, community ownership, self-
monitoring and participation, or fewer systematic non-
compliers6) or had lower pretreatment endemicity. In areas 
where onchocerciasis and loiasis are coendemic, 
moxidectin could advance the elimination of onchocerciasis 
within a test-not-treat strategy that excludes people with 
Loa loa microfilaraemia that puts them at risk of serious 
adverse events from microfilaricidal drugs.22 A safety-
focused study needs to be done to establish the appropriate 
risk threshold.
Persistent onchocerciasis prevalence and suboptimal 
responses to ivermectin’s embryostatic effect after 
long-term CDTI in Ghana and Cameroon have raised 
concerns about decreasing O volvulus susceptibility to 
ivermectin.23–27 Suboptimal responses are characterised by 
an earlier and higher SmfD increase than is considered 
normal based on prior experience or meta-analysis 
(appendix); such responses are seen even during biannual 
CDTI.2,23–28 With suboptimal responder progeny in the 
skin earlier and for longer between CDTI rounds, such 
parasites could be preferentially transmitted, leading to 
an increase in their prevalence and a gradual decrease in 
the effect of CDTI on transmission. The high rate of 
optimal responses to moxidectin (undetectable SmfD at 
months 1, 6, and 12) suggests that moxidectin could 
accelerate progress towards elimination in areas with 
high prevalence of suboptimal responses to ivermectin.
In each of the four CDTI-naive study areas, some 
participants met the criteria for suboptimal response to 
ivermectin’s embryostatic effect or for suboptimal 
response to ivermectin’s microfilaricidal effect.14 This 
finding raises the question of whether suboptimal 
responses in Ghana and Cameroon are now more 
common than they were at CDTI initiation and suggests 
that data on the variability of interindividual responses and 
relative frequencies of different response levels are 
required to detect changes in O volvulus susceptibility to 
ivermectin over time.
The biological mechanism(s) through which moxi 
dectin 
leads to lower long-term SmfD than does ivermectin are 
unknown.14 They probably include a combination of 
microfilaricidal, embryo 
static, embryotoxic, and macro-
filaricidal effects, or a reproductive life-span shortening 
effect.2,8,14 Our study did not include an evaluation of 
macrofilariae, which might have added new data. 
Moxidectin’s superiority is probably related to its long half-
life of 20–43 days,9–13 compared with ivermectin (<1 day).8
This study and the phase 2 study14 were single-dose 
studies. Given the sustained effect (6–12 months) of a 
single moxidectin dose on SmfD, administration of 
another dose of moxidectin before the effect of the previous 
dose has fully waned could have cumulative effects. A 
large study comparing multiple annual and biannual 
moxidectin and ivermectin treatments could provide 
sufficient macrofilariae from palpable nodules to identify 
cumulative effects on the reproductive capacity and 
viability of macrofilariae and the relative contribution of 
effects on microfilariae and macrofilariae on moxidectin’s 
superior effect on SmfD;14 provide a better basis for 
modelling the relative benefits and costs of these regimens 
to reduce time to onchocerciasis elimination;21 provide a 
better estimate of the relative frequency of rare Mazzotti 
reactions; provide more data on the relative efficacy against 
intestinal helminths; and provide more data to inform 
community mobilisation strategies and materials for 
information, education, and communication.
Our study did not include a paediatric population. 
A pharmacokinetic study to determine a safe dose in 
children is required.
For countries to consider the use of moxidectin for the 
control of onchocerciasis, moxidectin needs to be 
registered and manufactured. In 2014, WHO licensed all 
moxidectin-related data at its disposal to Medicines 
Development for Global Health. The US Food and 
Drug Administration assigned the new drug appli-
cation submitted by Medicines Development for Global 
Health to priority review. Medicines Development for
