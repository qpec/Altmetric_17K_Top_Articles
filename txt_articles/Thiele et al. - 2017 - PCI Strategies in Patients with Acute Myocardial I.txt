BACKGROUND
In patients who have acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, early revascular-
ization of the culprit artery by means of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves 
outcomes. However, the majority of patients with cardiogenic shock have multivessel dis-
ease, and whether PCI should be performed immediately for stenoses in nonculprit arteries 
is controversial.
METHODS
In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 706 patients who had multivessel disease, 
acute myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock to one of two initial revascularization 
strategies: either PCI of the culprit lesion only, with the option of staged revascularization 
of nonculprit lesions, or immediate multivessel PCI. The primary end point was a compos-
ite of death or severe renal failure leading to renal-replacement therapy within 30 days after 
randomization. Safety end points included bleeding and stroke.
RESULTS
At 30 days, the composite primary end point of death or renal-replacement therapy had 
occurred in 158 of the 344 patients (45.9%) in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group and in 189 
of the 341 patients (55.4%) in the multivessel PCI group (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.01). The relative risk of death in the culprit-lesion-only PCI 
group as compared with the multivessel PCI group was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.03), 
and the relative risk of renal-replacement therapy was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.03; P 
= 
0.07). 
The time to hemodynamic stabilization, the risk of catecholamine therapy and the duration 
of such therapy, the levels of troponin T and creatine kinase, and the rates of bleeding and 
stroke did not differ significantly between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients who had multivessel coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarc-
tion with cardiogenic shock, the 30-day risk of a composite of death or severe renal failure 
leading to renal-replacement therapy was lower among those who initially underwent PCI 
of the culprit lesion only than among those who underwent immediate multivessel PCI.

T
he mortality associated with car-
diogenic shock in acute myocardial infarc-
tion can be reduced with the use of early 
revascularization, predominantly percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI), to restore blood flow 
to the culprit coronary artery.1-3 Up to 80% of pa-
tients who have cardiogenic shock present with 
multivessel coronary artery disease,4 and mortal-
ity is higher with multivessel disease than with 
single-vessel disease.5-7 The value of performing 
immediate PCI for clinically important stenoses 
of major nonculprit coronary arteries is contro-
versial, and to our knowledge, randomized trials 
that have addressed this issue have not included 
patients with cardiogenic shock.8-11
Several theoretical arguments support imme-
diate revascularization of all coronary arteries with 
clinically important stenoses or chronic total oc-
clusions in addition to the culprit lesion, particu-
larly in patients with cardiogenic shock. The most 
notable argument is the potential to improve 
overall myocardial perfusion and function. How-
ever, immediate multivessel PCI might pose ad-
ditional risks, such as induction of further is 
che-
mia, volume overload, and renal impairment due 
to the use of an increased dose of contrast mate-
rial. Current evidence from nonrandomized stud-
ies involving patients with cardiogenic shock 
suggests that mortality at short-term follow-up 
is higher after immediate multivessel PCI than 
after PCI of the culprit lesion only.12 Guideline 
recommendations differentiate between stable and 
unstable hemodynamic status.13,14 European guide-
lines recommend the consideration of immediate 
PCI of nonculprit lesions in patients with cardio-
genic shock. U.S. guidelines give no specific rec-
ommendation. However, recent U.S. appropriate-
use criteria indicate that it is appropriate to 
perform immediate revascularization of a non-
culprit artery if cardiogenic shock persists after 
revascularization of the culprit artery.13-15 The 
Culprit Lesion Only PCI versus Multivessel PCI in 
Cardiogenic Shock (CULPRIT-SHOCK) trial was 
designed to test the hypothesis that PCI of the 
culprit lesion only, with the option of staged re-
vascularization of nonculprit lesions, would result 
in better clinical outcomes than immediate multi-
vessel PCI among patients who have multivessel 
coronary artery disease and acute myocardial in-
farction with cardiogenic shock.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The trial design has been published previously.4 
This investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, 
European multicenter trial involved patients who 
had acute ST-segment elevation or non–ST-seg-
ment elevation myocardial infarction that was 
complicated by cardiogenic shock, with planned 
early revascularization by means of PCI and an 
identifiable culprit lesion. The protocol (available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) was 
designed by the principal investigator and was 
modified and approved by the steering committee4; 
it was also approved by all relevant ethics commit-
tees. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
4 months after enrollment of the first patient, as 
discussed in the Supplementary Appendix (avail-
able at NEJM.org).
The institutions that funded the trial had no 
involvement in the conduct of the trial. A coordi-
nating research organization, Institut für Herzin-
farktforschung (Institute for Myocardial Infarc-
tion Research), maintained the data and performed 
independent statistical analysis. The steering com-
mittee vouches for the integrity and completeness 
of the data, and the statistician vouches for the 
accuracy of the data analysis and the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol.
Patients
Patients were eligible for the trial if they had acute 
myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. 
Additional eligibility criteria were planned early 
revascularization by means of PCI, multivessel 
coronary artery disease (defined as at least two 
major vessels [≥2 mm in diameter] with >70% 
stenosis of the diameter), and an identifiable 
culprit lesion. Criteria for cardiogenic shock in-
cluded a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 
mm Hg for longer than 30 minutes or the use of 
catecholamine therapy to maintain a systolic pres-
sure of at least 90 mm Hg, clinical signs of pul-
monary congestion, and signs of impaired organ 
perfusion with at least one of the following mani-
festations: altered mental status, cold and clammy 
skin and limbs, oliguria with a urine output of less 
than 30 ml per hour, or an arterial lactate level of 
more than 2.0 mmol per liter.
Exclusion criteria were resuscitation for longer

PCI Strategies in Patients with Cardiogenic Shock
than 30 minutes, no intrinsic heart action, an as-
sumed severe deficit in cerebral function with fixed 
dilated pupils, an indication for primary urgent 
coronary-artery bypass grafting, single-vessel cor-
onary artery disease, a mechanical cause of car-
diogenic shock, the onset of shock more than 12 
hours before randomization, an age of more than 
90 years, shock with a noncardiogenic cause, mas-
sive pulmonary embolism, known severe renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance, <30 ml per 
minute), and other severe concomitant disease 
associated with a life expectancy of less than 
 
6 months. For all eligible patients, written in-
formed consent was obtained with the use of a 
prespecified process that varied slightly accord-
ing to country (see the Supplementary Appen-
dix).4 Patients with cardiogenic shock who were 
not eligible for randomization were entered into 
the prospective CULPRIT-SHOCK registry.
Randomization and Treatment
Patients underwent randomization immediately 
after diagnostic angiography. Randomization was 
performed centrally with the use of an Internet-
based program with randomly changing blocks of 
four or six and stratification according to center.
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to one of two initial revascularization strategies: 
either PCI of the culprit lesion only, with the op-
tion of staged revascularization of nonculprit le-
sions, or immediate multivessel PCI. In all the 
patients, PCI of the culprit lesion was performed 
first, with the use of standard interventional tech-
niques. In patients in the culprit-lesion-only PCI 
group, all other lesions were to be left untreated 
at the time of the initial procedure. Staged revas-
cularization procedures were encouraged on the 
basis of the presence of residual ischemic lesions 
(evaluated by means of noninvasive testing or 
with the use of fractional flow reserve [FFR]), 
symptoms, and clinical and neurologic status. In 
patients in the multivessel PCI group, PCI of all 
major coronary arteries with more than 70% ste-
nosis of the diameter was to be performed. This 
included efforts to recanalize chronic total occlu-
sions during the acute phase; the recommended 
maximum dose of contrast material was 300 ml.
All other interventional therapeutic measures 
were allowed, independent of the assigned treat-
ment strategy. In particular, the use of mechan-
ical circulatory support was left to the discretion 
of the operator. Further therapy was provided in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) in accordance with 
generally accepted intensive care guidelines. If 
renal-replacement therapy was deemed to be nec-
essary, the method, duration, and reason for ini-
tiation (in accordance with predefined criteria) 
were documented.
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary end point was a composite of death 
from any cause or severe renal failure leading to 
renal-replacement therapy within 30 days after 
randomization. Renal-replacement therapy (di-
alysis, hemofiltration, or hemodiafiltration) was 
considered for otherwise untreatable volume over-
load, hyperkalemia (potassium level, >6.0 mmol 
per liter), severe uremia (blood urea level, >50 mg 
per deciliter), or persistent severe metabolic aci-
dosis (pH, <7.2).4
Clinical secondary end points included the 
individual components of the primary end point, 
recurrent myocardial infarction, rehospitalization 
for congestive heart failure, and repeat revascular-
ization. Other secondary end points included time 
to hemodynamic stabilization, the use of catechol-
amine therapy and the duration of such therapy, 
the duration of the ICU stay, the Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II (SAPS-II), and the use of me-
chanical ventilation and the duration of such 
therapy. For the assessment of renal and myocar-
dial injury, serial measurements of estimated cre-
atinine clearance and creatine kinase and troponin 
levels were obtained. Procedural success was 
included as a secondary end point but was not 
clearly prespecified, and therefore the results are 
not reported.
Safety end points included bleeding, which 
was defined as type 2, 3, or 5 on the Bleeding 
Academic Research Consortium (BARC) scale 
(with type 2 indicating any overt, actionable sign 
of bleeding; type 3 bleeding with a decrease in 
the hemoglobin level of >3 g per deciliter, any 
transfusion, cardiac tamponade, or intracranial 
or ocular involvement; and type 5 fatal bleed-
ing), as well as occurrence of stroke.4,16 Detailed 
definitions of the outcome measures and spe-
cific information regarding the reporting of in-
dividual prespecified end points are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.

PCI Strategies in Patients with Cardiogenic Shock
Statistical Analysis
To calculate the sample size, we estimated an 
event rate of the composite primary end point of 
death or renal-replacement therapy of 38% in the 
culprit-lesion-only PCI group and 50% in the mul-
tivessel PCI group.4 A sequential statistical design 
was chosen; one interim analysis was performed 
after 50% of all the patients who could be evalu-
ated had completed 30 days of follow-up. The 
global type I error level was 0.05. We calculated 
that a sample of 684 patients would give the trial 
80% power to rule out the null hypothesis of no 
difference between the two treatment groups in 
the event rate for the primary end point (at a two-
sided alpha level of 0.048 for the final analysis). 
To allow for a withdrawal rate of 3%, 706 patients 
were recruited. The software used for sample-
size calculation was nQuery Advisor, version 7.0 
(Statistical Solutions).
All data were analyzed according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle. In addition, sensitivity anal-
yses were performed in the per-protocol and 
as-treated populations (defined in Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) to evaluate data robust-
ness. For the primary end point, chi-square test-
ing was performed to compare event rates. Bi-
nary secondary end points were assessed by means 
of Fisher’s exact tests or chi-square tests, and 
quantitative secondary end points were assessed by 
means of Mann–Whitney U tests. No correction 
for multiple testing was performed. Analyses were 
performed in subgroups that were defined accord-

Results
Patients
From April 2013 through April 2017, a total of 
1075 patients with cardiogenic shock were screened 
at 83 European centers, and 706 of those patients 
(65.6%) were randomly assigned to the culprit-
lesion-only PCI group (351 patients) or the mul-
tivessel PCI group (355 patients). Data could be 
evaluated for 344 patients in the culprit-lesion-
only PCI group and for 342 patients in the multi-
vessel PCI group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Baseline characteristics were well bal-
anced between the two treatment groups (Table 1).
Treatment
Procedural characteristics are shown in Table 2. 
Crossover from the culprit-lesion-only PCI group 
to the multivessel PCI group was reported in 43 
patients (12.5%); reasons for crossover are shown 
in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. Staged 
revascularization was performed in 61 of the 344 
patients (17.7%) in the culprit-lesion-only PCI 
group. Crossover from the multivessel PCI group 
to the culprit-lesion-only PCI group was reported 
in 32 patients (9.4%); reasons for crossover are 
shown in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 
(TIMI) grades for blood flow obtained before 
and after PCI of the culprit artery did not differ 
significantly between the two groups. More pa-
tients underwent aspiration thrombectomy in 
the culprit-lesion-only group than in the multi-
vessel PCI group. The overall dose of contrast 
material was significantly higher and the dura-
tion of fluoroscopy was significantly longer in the 
multivessel PCI group than in the culprit-lesion-
only group. There was no significant difference 
between the two groups with respect to the use 
of adjunctive medications or devices for mechani-
cal circulatory support. Most patients were treat-
ed with multiple antiplatelet and anticoagulant 
drugs, including aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, glyco-
protein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and unfractionated 
heparin.
Primary and Secondary End Points
One patient in the multivessel PCI group was 
lost to follow-up before 30 days. Therefore, 344 
patients in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group and 
341 patients in the multivessel PCI group were 
included in the analysis of the primary and 
secondary end points (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
At 30 days, the rate of the composite primary 
end point of death or renal-replacement therapy 
was significantly lower in the culprit-lesion-only 
PCI group than in the multivessel PCI group 
(45.9% vs. 55.4%; relative risk, 0.83; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.01) (Ta-
ble 3 and Fig. 1A). Only minor variation in the 
relative risk was observed when the analysis was 
performed in the per-protocol population (44.8% 
in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group vs. 55.1% in 
the multivessel PCI group; relative risk, 0.81; 
95% CI, 0.69 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.01) or the as-treated 
population (46.0% in the culprit-lesion-only PCI 
group vs. 55.1% in the multivessel PCI group; 
relative risk, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02). 
Prespecified subgroup analyses revealed consis-
tent results across all the subgroups (Fig. 2).
The rate of death from any cause was signifi-
cantly lower in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group 
than in the multivessel PCI group (43.3% vs. 
51.6%; relative risk, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.98; 
P 
= 
0.03) (Table 3 and Fig. 1B). The causes of death 
are shown in Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. The rate of renal-replacement therapy did 
not differ significantly between the culprit-lesion-
only PCI group and the multivessel PCI group 
(11.6% and 16.4%, respectively; relative risk, 0.71; 
95% CI, 0.49 to 1.03; P 
= 
0.07) (Table 3 and 
Fig. 1C). The rates of recurrent myocardial in-
farction, rehospitalization for congestive heart 
failure, bleeding, and stroke did not differ sig-
nificantly between the two groups (Table 3). Event 
rates for the primary end point and its components 
among patients in the CULPRIT-SHOCK registry 
are shown in Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
The time to hemodynamic stabilization, the 
use of catecholamine therapy and the duration 
of such therapy, the duration of the ICU stay, and 
the use of mechanical ventilation and the dura-
tion of such therapy did not differ significantly 
between the two groups (Table 2). There was also 
no significant difference between the two groups 
in the SAPS-II score. The creatinine clearance and 
levels of arterial lactate, troponin, and creatine 
kinase were similar in the two treatment groups.

PCI Strategies in Patients with Cardiogenic Shock
Discussion
In this randomized, multicenter trial involving 
patients with multivessel coronary artery disease 
and acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic 
shock, PCI of the culprit lesion only (with the op-
tion of staged revascularization of nonculprit le-
sions) was superior to immediate multivessel PCI 
with respect to a composite end point of death 
or renal-replacement therapy at 30 days. The dif-
ference was driven mainly by significantly lower 
mortality in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group.
Multivessel coronary artery disease is present 
in the vast majority of patients who have acute 
myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock and 
is associated with higher mortality than single-
vessel disease.5 Thus, mortality at 30 days was 
higher in this trial than in other randomized trials 
involving patients with cardiogenic shock, despite 
similar inclusion criteria regarding cardiogenic 
shock.2,17-19 Although PCI of the culprit lesion is 
the established standard of care, the management 
of nonculprit lesions is the subject of intense de-
bate. Complete revascularization has been thought

PCI Strategies in Patients with Cardiogenic Shock
to be beneficial in improving ventricular func-
tion and hemodynamic status.13 However, the re-
sults of this trial and of nonrandomized studies 
have shown lower mortality with PCI of the cul-
prit lesion only than with multivessel PCI.12
The lack of benefit of immediate multivessel 
PCI in this trial might be related to the signifi-
cantly higher dose of contrast material that was 
used in the multivessel PCI group than in the 
culprit-lesion-only PCI group and a consequent 
decline in renal function. However, the incidence 
of severe renal failure leading to renal-replacement 
therapy did not differ significantly between the 
two groups. The higher dose of contrast material 
that was used in the multivessel PCI group than in 
the culprit-lesion-only PCI group may have also led 
to acute left ventricular volume overload and a 
subsequent negative effect on myocardial function 
and recovery. In addition, the prolonged duration 
of the multivessel PCI procedure may be hazard-
ous at a time when the patient is hemodynami-
cally compromised.
The findings of this trial are in contrast with 
the results of trials involving hemodynamically 
stable patients with myocardial infarction, which 
have shown a lower rate of major adverse cardiac 
events with either angiographically guided or FFR-
guided early multivessel PCI than with PCI of the 
culprit lesion only.8-11,20 However, these findings 
were driven mainly by the difference in the rate of 
repeat revascularization, which was counted as 
part of a composite end point, because repeat 
revascularization was usually performed during 
follow-up as staged revascularization procedures 
in patients who initially underwent PCI of the 
culprit lesion only. In our trial, staged revascu-
larization was encouraged and not counted as a 
disadvantage of the culprit-lesion-only PCI strat-
egy. In previous trials involving hemodynamically 
stable patients with myocardial infarction, there 
were no significant differences between the two 
treatment strategies in mortality or the rate of 
recurrent infarction. Among patients with cardio-
genic shock, the acute hazards of a prolonged 
procedure time (including the increased dose of 
contrast material) seem to outweigh any poten-
tial negative aspects of repeat revascularization.
In contrast with previous trials involving high-
ly selected patients with stable infarction, this trial 
did not specify the presence of a chronic total oc-
clusion as an exclusion criterion.8-11 This allowed 
for inclusion of a real-world cohort of patients 
with multivessel disease and cardiogenic shock. 
Chronic total occlusion is frequently present in 
patients with cardiogenic shock and is associated 
with adverse clinical outcomes.21,22 Exclusion of 
patients with a chronic total occlusion would have 
led to a major selection bias and a lower-risk co-
hort. Therefore, in the multivessel PCI group, im-
mediate recanalization of a chronic total occlusion 
was recommended. However, it was also advised to 
pursue recanalization attempts cautiously and to 
limit the total dose of contrast material to 300 ml. 
Complete revascularization was achieved in 81% 
of the patients in the multivessel PCI group. A 
previous trial involving patients with stable in-
farction showed no benefit of recanalization for 
chronic total occlusion of nonculprit lesions.23
This trial has several limitations. First, blind-
ing was not possible because of the nature of the 
intervention. Management of cardiogenic shock 
involves a complex series of clinical decisions, 
and it is not possible to fully eliminate some 
bias during the actual course of treatment. Sec-
ond, some patients could not be evaluated be-
cause of difficulties in obtaining final informed 
consent. The withdrawal rate was at the exact 
anticipated level of 3%. Third, 75 patients crossed 
over from their assigned treatment to the other 
treatment. Of these patients, 14 in the culprit-
lesion-only PCI group underwent immediate 
multivessel PCI for multiple reasons, including 
lack of hemodynamic improvement, plaque shifts, 
and the presence of newly detected lesions after 
treatment of the culprit lesion; these reasons sug-
gest that the treatment strategy may require adap-
tation to the specific clinical circumstances.
In conclusion, this randomized, multicenter 
trial showed that, among patients who had multi-
