T
he media play a central role in the 
dissemination of information on health 
and medical issues. More people obtain 
information about new developments through 
the media than from health professionals in 
Australia and elsewhere.1,2 Media coverage 
of health news has been shown to influence 
how people perceive medical issues and to 
affect health behaviours in both positive and 
negative ways.3,4
Health advice has been provided by 
magazines for many decades and while 
publication sales in all areas of the media 
are falling, magazines remain a popular 
way to seek health information.5 Magazine 
proprietors widely promote their publications 
as having a substantial impact on readers. 
There is evidence that shows media coverage 
can affect health behaviour, such as the rise in 
the number of mammogram appointments 
after Kylie Minogue was diagnosed with 
breast cancer3. It is reasonable to assume 
that lifestyle magazines, especially those with 
the word ‘health’ in their title, would have an 
impact on health literacy and behaviour.
Lifestyle magazines target specific age and 
gender readerships and are very popular in 
Australia. The top six magazines in Australia 
have a combined annual circulation of over 
1.7 million with a readership of nearly five 
times that figure (Table 1). Around 60% of 
Australians over 15 years of age read at least 
one magazine every week and in the year 
to June 2013, Australians spent $789 million 
buying 150 million magazines.6,7
The impact of the media on health literacy 
along with evidence of poor quality health 
reporting presents a strong rationale 
for implementing measures to improve 
media coverage.2,8 Most Australian lifestyle 
magazines dedicate significant space to 
health advice including ‘question and answer’ 
sections, columns, stories, product promotion 
and short ‘break-outs’ on health information. 
Advice includes prevention and/or treatment, 
and is written by medical doctors, dietitians, 
herbalists, psychologists or lay journalists. 
There is strong evidence around the poor 
quality of health reporting in the media.8-10 
However, while one study comparing health 
information presented in two magazines 
found less than optimal reporting, there has 
been no quantitative evaluation of the quality 
of this health advice.11
This study aimed to examine the way health 
advice is provided in popular magazines and 
assess the quality of that advice. This is an 
area of the health media with a substantial 
ongoing audience and the potential to 
negatively affect health behaviour. Our 
findings provide insight into the quality 
of this medium and an initial step towards 
raising this quality and awareness around it. 
Methods
The study was a prospective quantitative 
analysis of the quality of health advice 
provided in Australian lifestyle magazines. 
Magazine articles specifically providing 
health advice, as opposed to health news 
or information, were collected from lifestyle 
magazines over the six months July to 
December 2011. Hard copies of each 
magazine were purchased at the time of 
publication (via subscriptions) and manually

Abstract
Objective: To examine how health advice is provided in popular magazines and the quality of 
that advice.
Methods: A prospective quantitative analysis of the quality of health advice provided in 
Australian magazines between July and December 2011 was conducted. A rating instrument 
was adapted from the Media Doctor Australia rating tool used to assess quality of health news 
reporting. Criteria included: recommends seeing a doctor; advice based on reliable evidence; 
advice clear and easily applied; benefits presented meaningfully; potential harms mentioned; 
evidence of disease mongering; availability and cost of treatments; obvious advertising; vested 
interest, and anecdotal evidence.
Results: 163 health advice articles were rated showing a wide variation in the quality of advice 
presented between magazines. Magazines with ‘health’ in the title, rated most poorly with only 
36% (26/73) of these articles presenting clear and meaningful advice and 52% (38/73) giving 
advice based on reliable evidence.
Conclusions: Australian magazines, especially those with health in the title, generally 
presented poor quality, unreliable health advice. Teen magazine Dolly provided the highest 
quality advice.
Implications: Consumers need to be aware of this when making health choices.

searched-for articles. Articles were eligible 
for inclusion if they explicitly recommended 
interventions to treat, manage or prevent 
diseases or health issues and were not 
obviously advertisements. The articles 
included dedicated health advice columns, 
long articles on specific problems and short 
break-out articles on how to improve health 
or deal with health issues. Ten Australian 
magazines were included in the study (Table 
1). The magazines were selected on the 
basis of their popularity (circulation rates) 
and target readership (gender, interest and 
age range). Every issue of each magazine 
published from 1 July to 31 December 2011 
was included in the study. 
The rating instrument used in this study was 
adapted from the Media Doctor Australia 
rating instrument used to assess the quality 
of health reporting in the Australian news 
media.12 The 10 criteria are shown in Box 1. 
For each article, a search was conducted to 
locate any relevant journal articles, author 
qualifications or other supporting literature 
that might assist the reviewers in making their 
assessments of the quality of the information 
reported. A coding manual was developed 
to guide the assessments and interpretation 
of the criteria. For each article, the 10 criteria 
were assessed as ‘satisfactory’
, ‘not satisfactory’ 
or ‘not applicable’
. Agreement was achieved 
between raters as to how the evaluation 
criteria would be interpreted. All differences 
between raters in the scores assigned for 
individual criteria were resolved by consensus 
during regular face-to-face meetings. Ethics 
approval was not sought given that the data 
are in the public domain.
A total of 163 articles providing health advice 
were collected over the six months by an 
experienced researcher (RP). Two of three 
experienced Media Doctor Australia raters (AW, 
DS, RP) independently assessed each article. 
A descriptive analysis was conducted and 
consensus scores calculated on each of the 
10 rating criteria. The results are presented as 
the number and percentage of items within 
each magazine that were considered to be 
satisfactory for each criterion and across all 
criteria. Only one article was included from 
the magazine Girlfriend and while it rated 
satisfactory on all items, it has not been 
included in the overall results.
Results
The range of different health topics covered 
by the articles reviewed is presented in Table 
2. The most frequently discussed topics 
related to gynaecological and urinary tract 
matters (22.6%) and the use of vitamin and 
mineral supplements (14%). Of the 984 
criteria assessed from 163 articles, only 570 
(58%) were assessed ‘satisfactory’
. However, 
there was a wide range of quality between 
publications (see Table 3) with Dolly at 100%, 
and Women’s Health at 26%. 
The magazine Dolly scored well on all items. 
Most of the articles from Dolly took the form 
of reader questions with answers provided 
by a practising medical doctor. The topics 
covered were typically those important to 
adolescents, such as skin problems, body 
image and emerging sexuality, however, 
concerns including depression, severe anxiety 
and suicidal tendencies were also raised.
From a clinical perspective of quality of 
content, the two most important rating 
criteria were advice is based on accepted 
medical practice or reliable evidence and 
benefits of advice are presented in a meaningful 
way. There were 160 articles where both of 
these criteria could be assessed (Table 4). 
These results demonstrate a wide variation 
in the quality of advice presented between 
magazines. Magazines with the word ‘health’ 
in the title, rated most poorly with only 36% 
(26/73) of these articles presenting advice 
that was clear and meaningful and 52% 
(38/73) of the articles presenting advice 
based on reliable evidence or reflected 
current practice. 
Conclusions
The findings from this study show that overall, 
the quality of advice presented in magazines 
was low, although there was a wide variation 
between magazines. Magazines with the 
word ‘health’ in the title, such as Women’s 
Health, presented the lowest quality advice, 
while the teen magazine Dolly rated as the 
highest quality.
The media shape the public’s perceptions 
of both health and disease and influence 
health behaviour and use of health care 
interventions.1,2 The Press Council of 
Australia’s Advisory Guidelines states: 
“The Press Council views with concern 
inadequately researched reports on health 
and medical matters appearing in the press 
and in the media as whole. The dangers of 
exciting unreasonable fears or hopes are far 
too great for anything but the most careful 
treatment”

Quality of health advice in Australian magazines

Australian lifestyle magazines, especially 
those with the word health in their title, are 
not meeting these standards. The findings 
presented in this study only represent a 
relatively brief snapshot of a specific and 
diminishing section of the media landscape. 
However, magazine readers should be 
informed that the health advice provided by 
these magazines is often poorly presented 
and unreliable. 
Specifically titled health magazines 
rated poorly on all measures. However, 
the magazines marketed to adolescent 
girls performed well overall. In Dolly, all 
reader questions were responded to in 
an accessible, non-judgmental manner 
with encouragement to seek help from 
appropriate health professionals. This 
magazine provided excellent examples of 
ethical ways to deliver health advice and also 
highlighted the need for this type of advice to 
be provided for this particular age group. 
The overall range of health advice topics 
was very limited and did not include any 
important contemporary health issues such 
as smoking, obesity and immunization. The 
two most commonly discussed topics were 
genitourinary issues and the use of vitamins 
and minerals. While not presented in this 
paper, we collected data on advertisements 
in close proximity to the advice rated, and 
the most common advertisements were 
for female genitourinary products and 
vitamins and minerals, suggesting a possible 
financial conflict of interest. Advertising is 
by its nature, manipulative and strategic.14 A 
strong correlation between advertisement 
placement and article content is an effective 
marketing strategy that has been shown to 
exist even in medical journals.15 
Implications
The findings from this study raise questions 
around the social responsibility of the 
media. Most journalists and public health 
providers believe that health is a special 
commodity that gives rise to particular social 
responsibilities.16,13 If the public has a right 
to know it also has a right to be provided 
with information that is accurate and 
complete17. Many studies have looked at the 
influence and quality of health news stories, 
but few, if any, have looked at the quality 
of health advice given in magazines. The 
findings present here are important because 
magazines are not generally subjected to 
the same rigours of news journalism and 
the content is likely to be influenced by 
companies advertising ‘health’ products and 
interventions. This type of soft journalism 
appears in many different forms on the 
internet where health advice is presented as 
evidence based and current. We have shown 
that the quality of health advice provided in 
magazines is generally poor. This message 
is important in order to raise the awareness 
and promote critical thinking among health 
consumers.
