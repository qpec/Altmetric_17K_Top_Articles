The recently discovered colistin resistance-encoding 
element, mcr-1, adds to the list of mobile resistance 
genes whose products rapidly erode the antimicrobial 
efficacy of not only the commonly used antibiotics, but 
also the last line agents of carbapenems and colistin. 
The relative prevalence of mcr-1-bearing strains in var-
ious ecological niches including 1,371 food samples, 
480 animal faecal samples, 150 human faecal samples 
and 34 water samples was surveyed using a novel in-
house method. Bacteria bearing mcr-1 were commonly 
detected in water (71% of samples), animal faeces (51%), 
food products (36%), and exhibited stable carriage in 
28% of human subjects surveyed. Such strains, which 
exhibited variable antibiotic susceptibility profiles, 
belonged to various Enterobacteriaceae species, 
with Escherichia coli being the most dominant in each 
specimen type. The mcr-1 gene was detectable in the 
chromosome as well as plasmids of various sizes. 
Among these, two conjugative plasmids of sizes ca 33 
and ca 60 kb were found to be the key vectors that 
mediated mcr-1 transmission in organisms residing in 
various ecological niches. The high mcr-1 carriage rate 
in humans found in this study highlights the importance 
of continued vigilance, careful antibiotic stewardship, 
and the development of new antimicrobials.
Introduction 
The effectiveness of antibiotics to combat bacterial 
infections has diminished rapidly in the past decade due 
to incessant emergence of bacterial strains that exhibit 
novel and transmissible resistance mechanisms, such 
as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) 
strains that commonly cause untreatable and hard-to-
treat infections among hospitalised patients. CRE are 
now considered an urgent public health threat accord-
ing to reports by the European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the United States 
(US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
[1,2].
Colistin is currently considered a last-resort antibi-
otic that can be used to treat clinical CRE infections. 
Bacterial resistance to colistin was previously thought 
to be rare, and mainly attributed to chromosomal 
mutations leading to modification of lipid A or loss 
of lipopolysaccharide [3,4]. Recently, a new plasmid-
encoded colistin resistance mechanism, mediated 
by the MCR-1 protein, a phosphoethanolamine trans-
ferase that modifies the phosphoethanolamine moiety 
of lipid A, has been reported [5]. Since its discovery 
in November 2015, the mcr-1genehas been associated 
with a wide range of mobile elements in different bac-
terial species, suggesting that this resistance element 
is highly transmissible, thereby posing a huge chal-
lenge to the use of colistin as a reserved drug for treat-
ment of CRE infections [6]. Currently there is a lack of 
studies comprehensively screening for mcr-1 positive 
bacteria in the environment, and the most frequent 
sources investigated for such bacteria consist of 
human clinical samples and veterinary specimens. 
Hence, information on the prevalence of mcr-1 gene 
in various ecological niches is not available to assess 
of the degree of mcr-1 contamination, which can 
potentially impact the clinical use of colistin. This is 
due to a lack of methods for specific isolation of mcr-
1-positive bacteria, since many species of bacteria are 
intrinsically resistant to colistin, interfering with the 
isolation of mcr-1-positive organisms. In this study, we 
have developed a novel method that facilitates specific 
detection of mcr-1-positive bacteria. Using this method, 
we checked various environmental sources in China for 
the presence of mcr-1 positive bacteria. These included 
animal and human faecal samples, as well as sewage 
water, seawater and fresh water samples. Foods locally 
produced or imported from overseas were also tested.

Methods
Specific isolation of mcr-1-bearing bacteria
PCR screening for mcr-1-bearing organisms in food 
specimens
A PCR-based method was first developed to screen for 
the presence of mcr-1-bearing organisms in food prod-
ucts. A total of 25 g of each food sample was mixed with 
75 mL alkaline peptone water and stomached for 30 s; 
50 mL of the suspension (without sediment) were then 
incubated in a tube overnight at 37 °C without shaking. 
After incubation, the tube was inverted several times 
and left standing for 10 min for settlement of the food 
particles. To collect the bacteria, 1 mL of the suspen-
sion was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, and the pellet 
was subsequently washed twice with phosphate buff-
ered saline (PBS). The final pellet was resuspended in 
100 µL of saline water and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min to 
release bacterial DNA. The sample was then subjected 
to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The super-
natant was then used as DNA template for PCR with the 
primers targeting mcr-1 as reported previously [5]. The 
genetic identity of all amplification products was con-
firmed by nt sequencing.
Isolation of Enterobacteriaceae containing mrc-1 in food
The samples that were positive for the mcr-1 gene 
were 
subjected 
to 
isolation 
of 
mcr-1-positive 
Enterobacteriaceae strains using the following proce-
dure. Briefly, overnight-incubated food sample sus-
pension as mentioned above was inverted several

accession number): pSD11(KM212169) carrying cfr was isolated from an animal E. coli strain in China; pSH146_32(JX258655), which was 
known to contain a backbone highly similar to pECJS-B65–33 but without any antimicrobial resistance gene, was isolated from a Salmonella 
Heidelberg strain in the United States; pJIE143(JN194214) carrying blaCTX-M-15 was recovered from a clinical E. coli ST131 strain isolated 
in Sydney, Australia. The gene labels follow that of the original annotations in GenBank. Gene alignment was performed by EasyFigure 2.1 
[22]. (B) Genetic comparison of pECJS-61–63 with pHNSHP45(KP347127), the first mcr-1-bearing IncI2 plasmid reported in the literature. The

times to resuspend the bacteria, and then left stand-
ing for 10 min to facilitate settlement of large parti-
cles. 500 µL enrichment broth at the top of the tube 
were then removed and added into 5 mL Mossel 
Enterobacteria enrichment broth (MEE broth, Sigma-
Aldrich) supplemented with 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 
64 µg/mL colistin E, followed by incubation at 37 °C 
overnight. A standard loop of overnight MEE culture 
was inoculated onto MacConkey agar plate and incu-
bated at 37 °C overnight. Twenty colonies with differ-
ent morphologies were selected for further purification 
and confirmation of the presence of mcr-1 by PCR as 
previously described [5]. The optimal concentration 
of colistin used in MEE broth, which could specifically 
select for mcr-1-bearing organisms, was determined. 
The mcr-1 negative samples as defined by the PCR 
assay were also subjected to isolation of mcr-1-bearing 
bacteria as described above.
Limit of PCR detection and isolation of mcr-1-bearing 
organisms in food samples
To determine the limit of detection and isolation 
of mcr-1-bearing bacteria for the above methods, 
three mcr-1negative samples were selected for the fol-
lowing assays. 9.9 mL of pork suspension prepared 
as described above was inoculated with 10°, 101, 102, 
103, 104 and 105 CFU of mcr-1-positive Escherichia 
coli isolates in 100 µL volume. Two E. coli isolates, 
SZM584, carrying a plasmid-borne mcr-1 gene, and 
SZM485, carrying the mcr-1 gene in the chromosome, 
were used. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, PCR 
template was prepared and subjected to PCR detection 
as described above. Similarly, pork suspensions inoc-
ulated with various amounts of mcr-1-positive E. coli, 
were subjected to isolation of mcr-1-bearing bacteria 
as described above, using an optimal concentration of 
colistin as determined above.
Figure 3
Potential transmission route of mcr-1 in the ecosystem
The mcr-1 gene may undergo evolutionary changes in the animal GI tract upon prolonged usage of colistin as growth promoter. The gene is 
then transmitted to human through the food chain or direct human contact with animals, as well as through contamination of the fresh and 
seawater system, which in turn cause contamination of vegetables and seafood. The persistence of mcr-1 in the human GI tract microflora can 
cause further contamination of the water systems through disposal of waste water containing human faeces. Fresh water systems outside 
these transmission routes remain clear of mcr-1 contamination.

Isolation of mcr-1-bearing organisms from water and 
sewage
For isolation of mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae 
strains from water and sewage, samples were collected 
at each site and filtered by vacuum filtration using a 
filter membrane (< 0.2 μm). Bacteria on the membrane 
was then suspended in 10 mL sterile 0.45% saline solu-
tion. 200 μL of the suspension were inoculated into 
10 mL alkaline peptone water and incubated at 37 °C 
overnight. Subsequently, 500 µL of the later mixture 
were added to 5 mL MEE broth containing 2 µg/mL 
colistin E and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial 
isolation was then performed as described above.
Isolation of mcr-1-bearing organisms from faecal 
samples
For faecal samples, 5 g each were suspended in 15 mL 
alkaline peptone water and stomached for 30 s; 10 mL 
of the suspension were incubated overnight at 37 °C 
without shaking. After incubation, the enrichment broth 
was mixed and allowed to settle for 10 min. 500 µL of 
enrichment broth containing a positive sample was 
added into 5 mL MEE broth containing 2 µg/mL colistin 
E and incubated at 37 °C. The isolation procedure was 
the same as described above.
Surveillance of mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae 
recovered from various niches in the ecosystem
Food samples including meat products (chicken, duck, 
pork, beef and mutton), seafood (shrimp, fish and shell 
fish), dairy products (yogurt, milk cheese and butter), 
fresh produce (lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower 
etc.) and other food products (tofu etc.) were pur-
chased from supermarkets and wet markets located in 
different districts of Shenzhen, mainland China (each 
of four different supermarkets and wet markets) and 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (each of 
three different supermarkets and wet markets). Meat 
and seafood products of overseas origin including 
Asian countries, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, 
New Zealand, Norway, and the US were collected from 
various stores of the three biggest chain supermarkets 
located in three districts of Hong Kong. The different 
districts chosen for this sampling in both Shenzhen

and Hong Kong were all highly and densely populated 
residential areas. Water and sewage samples were col-
lected from different bay areas, waste water treatment 
plants and a fresh water reservoir in Shenzhen. Human 
faecal samples were obtained from in- and outpatients 
in four different hospitals located in Shenzhen city and 
adjacent areas. Pet faecal samples were collected from 
three animal hospitals located in various geographical 
sites in Shenzhen city. Chicken and pig faecal samples 
were collected from farms located in the Chinese prov-
inces of Fujian, Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangshu, 
Shandong, Shanxi and Zhejiang. All samples were col-
lected during the period of December 2015 to May 2016. 
All samples were subjected to mcr-1-positive bacteria 
isolation using methods described above.
Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and detection of beta-
lactamase genes
All Enterobacteriaceae isolates were subjected to anti-
microbial susceptibility tests according to the stand-
ard agar dilution method described by the Clinical 
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [7,8]. 
Sixteen antimicrobials were tested (as presented in 
the table shown in the result section). E. coli strain 
ATCC 25922 was used as a control. Beta-lactamase 
genes in cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates were 
determined by PCR as previously described [9].
Conjugation, S1-pulsed-field electrophoresis and 
Southern hybridisation
Conjugation experiments were carried out using the 
mixed broth method as previously described [10]. 
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), S1-PFGE and 
Southern hybridisation were performed as previously 
described [11]. The chi-squared test was used to com-
pare the conjugation rate among E. coli strains isolated 
from different sources.
Complete plasmid sequencing
One each of representative plasmids containing mcr-1, 
one of ca 33 kb and the other ca 60 kb in size, was recov-
ered from transconjugants for sequencing. Plasmid 
sequencing was performed as previously described 
using the Illumina and PacBio RS II platforms [6]. All 
plasmid sequences were submitted to Rapid Annotation 
using Subsystem Technology (RAST) tool for annota-
tions and modified manually by Basic Local Alignment 
Search Tool (BLAST) [12]. BLAST Ring Image Generator 
(BRIG) software was used to compare plasmids [13]. 
The nt sequences of the ca 33 kb plasmid (pECJS-
B65–33) and the ca 60 kb plasmid (pECJS-61–63) were

Results
Method development
The PCR assay was able to detect the mcr-1 gene 
directly from various food samples. For isolation 
of mcr-1-positive bacteria from mcr-1 positive samples, 
10 colonies with pink to red colour (suspicious for E. 
coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were picked from 
MacConkey plates spread with MEE broth supple-
mented with 2 µg/mL of colistin; all the 10 colonies 
were confirmed to be mcr-1 positive. Consistently, 
10 colourless to yellow colonies (indicative of non-E. 
coli strains) collected from these plates were found 
to be mcr-1 negative. Eight of the 10 red colonies from 
MacConkey plates spread with MEE broth supplemented 
with 4 µg/mL of colistin were mcr-1 positive and all 10 
yellow colonies were negative for mcr-1. However, MEE 
broth supplemented with 0, 1, 8, 16 and 32 µg/mL of 
colistin failed to isolate any mcr-1-bearing bacteria. All 
red or yellow colonies collected from MacConkey plates 
spread with these MEE broth were all negative for mcr-
1. These data suggested that MEE broth supplemented 
with 2 µg/mL was optimal for specific isolation of mcr-
1-bearing bacteria from food products. Using this 
method, the mcr-1 gene could be successfully detected 
by PCR in 9.9 mL of pork suspension inoculated with 
103 CFU or more of mcr-1-positive E. colistrains, SZ584 
or SZ485, which was equivalent to 104 CFU mcr-1-posi-
tive E. coli per 25 g of pork. For isolation of mcr-1-bear-
ing organisms, E. coli strains SZ584 or SZ485 could be 
successfully isolated from 9.9 mL of pork suspension 
inoculated with 1×10° CFU or more of SZ584 or SZ485, 
which was equivalent to 101 CFU mcr-1-positive E. 
coli per 25 g of pork. Our data suggested that the 
isolation method was more sensitive than the PCR 
detection method. Therefore, the isolation method was 
used in subsequent surveillance experiments.
Prevalence of mcr-1-bearing bacteria in various 
food and environmental samples
Food samples
A total of 1,371 food samples obtained in Shenzhen and 
in Hong Kong, including 234 samples from overseas-
imported foods, were subjected to screening of mcr-
1-bearing organisms; 498 (36%) positive samples were 
identified.
Among 
the 
620 
food 
samples 
surveyed 
in 
Shenzhen, mcr-1-bearing bacteria isolates were iso-
lated in 150 of 230 (65%) meat samples and 27 of 390 
(7%) other food samples (Table 1). Among the 230 
meat samples, the mcr-1 isolation rate was 107/142 
(75%), 29/43, 2/4, 2/6 and 10/35 for pork, chicken, 
duck, mutton and beef, respectively. The isolation rate 
in meat products purchased from supermarket (61/103, 
59%) was slightly lower than that of meat purchased 
from wet market (89/127, 70%). In addition, seafood 
and vegetable products were also contaminated 
with mcr-1-bearing bacteria, with a rate of 9/63 (14%) 
and 18/271 (7%) respectively. All dairy products and 
other food such as tofu were negative for mcr-1-bearing 
bacteria.
The origin of food products surveyed in Hong Kong were 
categorised as either ‘Hong Kong’ or ‘overseas’. Among 
the 517 food samples tested in Hong Kong, which had 
not been imported from overseas, mcr-1-bearing bac-
teria isolates were isolated in 196 of 376 (52%) meat 
samples and 19 of 141 (13%) other food samples (Table 
1). The mcr-1-bearing bacteria isolation rate in different 
types of food samples was similar to that of Shenzhen 
except that vegetable products exhibited a higher con-
taminated rate (12/77, 15%) of mcr-1-bearing bacteria

than those from Shenzhen. Food of overseas origin 
mainly included meat products and seafood (a total of 
234 samples), in which the mcr-1-bearing bacteria isola-
tion rate was 104 of 222 (47%) meat samples and 2 of 12 
seafood samples respectively (Table 1). The mcr-1-bear-
ing bacteria isolation rates varied slightly between dif-
ferent countries in different regions of the world, with 
rates of 4/12, 37/69 (54%), 28/51 (55%), 27/72 (38%) 
and 11/18 recorded in food products originating from 
Asia, US/Canada, Brazil, Australia/New Zealand and 
Denmark/Norway respectively. Our data also indicated 
that meat products showed the highest contamina-
tion rate of mcr-1-bearing bacteria among all types of 
food products. Among the mcr-1 positive food samples 
recovered in both Shenzhen and Hong Kong, a total of 
737 bacterial strains containing the mcr-1 element were 
isolated from the food samples tested, the majority of 
which (n = 730) being E. coli, followed by Aeromonas 
veronii (n = 4) and K. pneumoniae (n = 3) (Table 1).
Animal faecal samples
The mcr-1-bearing bacteria isolates were detected 
in 51% (124 of 245) and 63% (113 of 180) of pig and 
chicken faecal samples, respectively (Table 1). The 
contamination rate of faecal samples collected from 
farms located in different provinces of China was 63% 
(25/40), 14% (8/58), 55% (30/55), 83% (75/90), 56% 
(28/50), 100% (42/42), 70% (28/40) and 50% (25/50), in 
Fujian, Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangshu, Shandong, 
Shanxi and Zhejiang respectively. In contrast, only six 
of 55 (11%) pet faecal samples (10 cats and 45 dogs) 
collected from three pet hospitals in Shenzhen were 
found to contain mcr-1 (Table 1). A total of 590 strains 
containing the mcr-1 element were isolated from animal 
faecal samples, with the majority being E. coli (n = 576), 
followed by K. pneumoniae (n = 10) and Enterobacter 
cloacae(n = 4) (Table 1).
Human faecal samples
Among the 150 human faecal samples tested, 85 were 
collected from inpatients and 65 were collected from 
healthy individuals who were admitted for physical 
examination. Twenty-two of the 85 faecal samples 
(26%) from inpatients and 20 of 65 samples (31%) 
from healthy individuals were found to contain strains 
that harboured the mcr-1 gene. The majority of the mcr-
1-bearing bacterial strains were confirmed to be E. 
coli (n = 84) (Table 1).
Water samples
Among the 24 sewage samples tested, six samples 
collected from the primary sedimentation tanks were 
negative, but all other 18 samples collected from 
other stages of water treatment were positive for mcr-
1-bearing bacteria including water to be released 
to the sea after treatment (Table 1). The mcr-1 gene 
was also detected in all six seawater samples 
collected from different locations in Shenzhen, but 
not in the four fresh water samples collected from 
the Meilin fresh water reservoir, a major source of 
fresh water in Shenzhen (Table 1). Among the water 
samples, mcr-1-bearing E. coli was the only bacterial 
species isolated from seawater; in contrast, bacterial 
species such as K. pneumoniae and K. variicola were 
isolated from sewage, although E. coli remained the 
dominant species (Table 1).
Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of mcr-1-
bearing Enterobacteriaceae strains recovered 
from various sources
Randomly selected mcr-1-positive bacterial strains col-
lected from various sources, as shown in Table 2, were 
subjected to assessment of their susceptibility to 16 
antibiotics. Almost all of these strains exhibited a MIC 
of ≥ 4 µg/mL for colistin. Yet these colistin resistant 
strains were found to exhibit a diverse range of antibi-
otic susceptibility profiles, with co-resistance to antibi-
otics being a common phenomenon.
For example, up to 68% of colistin-resistant E. 
coli strains isolated from human faecal samples 
exhibited co-resistance to ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, 
organisms recovered from different sources also 
exhibited differential resistance profiles. In particular, E. 
coli strains recovered from food and animal faecal 
samples exhibited a higher rate of resistance to cepha-
losporins than those obtained from other sources (Table 
2). A total of 257 cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates 
were obtained, from which 100 isolates were randomly 
selected and subjected to screening for the presence 
of different beta-lactamases. Ninety-three of the 100 
isolates carried different types of blaCTX-M genes, 
among which 75 belonged to blaCTX-M-1 group genes 
and the 18 remaining belonged to blaCTX-M-9 group 
genes (data not shown). For non-E. coli isolates, they 
were mainly K. pneumoniae isolates and showed a 
high resistance rate to cephalosporins and fosfomy-
cin. Our data also showed that resistance to merope-
nem, amikacin and tigecycline remained extremely rare 
among mcr-1-positive strains, including those isolated 
from animals. Nevertheless, it should be noted that 
two mcr-1 positive E. coli strains that exhibited cross-
resistance to meropenem and colistin, as well as most 
other tested antimicrobial drugs, had been recovered 
from animal faecal products (data not shown).
Genetic features of mcr-1
To investigate the genetic features of the mcr-1 gene 
harboured by strains of different bacterial species, 
randomly selected E. coli strains (maximum one from 
each sample) isolated from various sources, as shown 
in Table 3, were subjected to assessment of their abil-
ity to undergo conjugative transfer of the mcr-1 gene 
to E. coli J53.
The transfer rate among E. coli strains isolated 
from different sources was significantly different 
(p = 0.0002) with E. coli strains obtained from human 
faeces and animals being the highest (Table 3). 
S1-PFGE characterisation and Southern hybridisation 
were then performed on transconjugants as well as 
on their parental E. coli strains, using mcr-1-specific 
 9
www.eurosurveillance.org
probes, to determine the range of transmissible and 
non-transmissible mcr-1-positive elements harboured 
by the test strains. Two major conjugative plasmids 
which contained the mcr-1 gene, with a size of ca 33 kb 
or 60 kb respectively, were detectable in most of the E. 
coli strains recovered from various sources and their 
corresponding transconjugants. On the other hand, 
the size of non-conjugative mcr-1-bearing plasmids 
in E. coli isolated from various sources varied (ca 78 kb 
− ca 480 kb). Interestingly, some E. coli strains, 
mostly in animal products, were found to harbour a 
chromosomal mcr-1 gene (Figure 1, Table 3). Apart 
from E. coli, 21 of 34 non-E. coli strains were found to 
successfully transfer their colistin resistance pheno-
types to the recipient strains through the ca 33 kb or 
60 kb plasmids, whereas the sizes of non-conjugative 
plasmids ranged from ca 78 kb − ca 250 kb (Figure 
1, Table 3). 
Genetic features of the most common transmissible mcr-
1-positive plasmids
One representative ca 33 kb conjugative plasmid 
(pECJS-B65–33) was sequenced and shown to belong 
to the IncX4 type, with a size of 33,298 bp and 41.85% 
GC content (Figure 2). Several similar plasmids have 
been reported from various parts of the world. One rep-
resentative ca 60 kb plasmid (pECJS-61–63) was also 
sequenced and shown to belong to the IncI2 type, with 
a size of 63,656 bp and 42.64% GC content. It shares 
99% similarity and 88% coverage with the pHNSHP45 
plasmid except that ISApI1 is missing in the upstream 
region of in mcr-1 (Figure 2) [5]. 
Discussion 
Just a few months after the discovery of the plasmid-
mediated colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, a flood of 
information regarding this gene was reported in the 
literature [5,14-17]. However, these studies failed to 
provide comprehensive understanding on the distribu-
tion of mcr-1-like elements in various ecological niches 
in order to assess the potential impact of dissemina-
tion of this novel colistin resistance element on current 
antimicrobial treatment protocols, especially the use of 
colistin to treat infections due to CRE.
In this study, we developed a sensitive and spe-
cific method for the isolation of mcr-1-bearing bac-
teria from various sources and used it to investigate 
the prevalence of mcr-1 in various sample types 
collected from different settings. It should be noted 
that the traditional selective isolation method using 
colistin-containing agar plates is not suited for isola-
tion of mcr-1-positive bacteria due to the prevalence 
of organisms that are intrinsically resistant to colisin, 
such as the Proteus, Morganella, Neisseria, Providenci
a and Serratia spp., some of which are normal flora 
of animals and human, rendering measurement of the 
true mcr-1 positive rate among Enterobacteriaceae 
species challenging. In this work, we tried to focus 
on isolation of Enterobacteriaceae strains harbouring 
the mcr-1 gene. To eliminate non-Enterobacteriaceae 
strains before plating, we added another selective step 
by diluting peptone water enrichment broth in MEE 
broth (selective for Enterobacteriaceae) supplemented 
with 2 µg/mL colistin, which was proven to be optimal 
in selecting strains harbouring mcr-1. Using this in-
house method, we were able to isolate different species 
of mcr-1-positive bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae 
and other species exhibiting intrinsic resistance to 
colistin. During the course of this study, two new vari-
ant of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene, 
namely mcr-2 and mcr-3 were also discovered [18,19]. 
We screened all isolates that were positive for mcr-1 for 
the presence of these two variants, but none of these 
isolates contained any of these two variants (data not 
shown).
It became difficult to determine the origin of mcr-1 since 
it has been disseminated to various species of bacteria. 
However, comprehensive data generated by this study 
suggested that the mcr-1 gene may originate from E. 
coli in animal gastrointestinal (GI) tract due to prolonged 
usage of colistin in livestock. Pet animals which are 
rarely exposed to colistin exhibited a much lower level 
of prevalence of mcr-1-positive organisms than pigs and 
chickens. Additional evidence supporting this hypoth-
esis includes findings that E. coli is the predominant 
species 
among 
mcr-1-bearing 
Enterobacteriaceae 
strains and that mcr-1 was detectable in E. coli isolated 
from animals during the 1980s [20], a date much earlier 
than that of the first detection of this gene in human 
(2008) in a retrospective study [14]. Enterobacteriaceae 
strains carrying mcr-1 in the animal GI tract can 
cause contamination of their meat products and the 
environment as evidenced by the highly prevalent mcr-
1- positive Enterobacteriaceae strains in food, waste 
water and seawater, but not in a fresh water reser-
voir that is not contaminated by faeces. Findings of 
this work also confirmed that mcr-1 is an extremely 
common mobile element detectable worldwide, and 
commonly recoverable from food products originating 
from different parts of the world, including Australia, 
the most geographically isolated continent.
One limitation in investigating food samples from over-
seas in our study was however the uncertainty in the 
sources of contamination. The food products could 
have been contaminated in the country of origin or dur-
ing the re-packaging process after they were imported 
into Hong Kong. Another limitation of the current study 
is that it involved non-probability sampling. Hence, 
while many samples were investigated, and new infor-
mation on mcr-1-bearing Enterobacteriaceae in various 
ecological niches was provided, the extent of data rep-
resentativeness of the areas under study is difficult to 
derive.
Based on the molecular epidemiology data in this 
study, we propose a potential mcr-1 transmission 
route. The mcr-1gene may have evolved from animal 
GI tract with the prolonged use of colistin as a growth 
promoter in livestock. The mcr-1 gene might have 
 10
www.eurosurveillance.org
then been transmitted to humans through the food 
chain or direct contact between animals and humans, 
as well as through contamination of the fresh and 
seawater system, which in turn lead to contamination 
of vegetables and seafood. The persistence of mcr-1 in 
the human GI tract microflora can cause further con-
tamination of our water systems through improper 
disposal of waste water. A fresh water reservoir that 
is outside these transmission routes maintained clear 
of mcr-1 contamination (Figure 3).
Genetic characterisation of mcr-1-bearing plasmids 
revealed that the gene may reside in both chromo-
some and plasmids, but most commonly on two con-
jugative elements of ca 33 and 60 kb in size. A much 
higher proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains in 
the human GI tract and clinical specimens was found 
to carry these two conjugative plasmids when com-
pared with Enterobacteriaceae strains recovered 
from other sources, suggesting that the prevalence 
of mcr-1 among human Enterobacteriaceae strains is 
mainly due to the transmission of mcr-1-bearing conju-
gative plasmids to the human GI tract microflora. The 
fact that mcr-1-bearing organisms recoverable from 
human faecal samples and clinical specimens exhibit 
highly different antibiotic susceptibility and PFGE pro-
files (data not shown) from those of other sources also 
supports the idea that plasmids may play an important 
role in mcr-1transmission to humans. Sequence analy-
sis revealed the presence of mcr-1-negative plasmids 
with a backbone similar to that of the 33 and 60 kb ele-
ments in Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from ani-
mals, thus further supporting the theory that these two 
conjugative plasmids originated from animals [16]. The 
finding that these two plasmids are highly conjugative 
(conjugation efficiency at 10 − 1 level) [21] and stably 
inherited in Enterobacteriaceae strains in the human 
GI tract without colistin selective pressure suggests 
that they may severely compromise efforts to control 
dissemination of the mcr-1 among bacterial pathogens. 
It is apparently too late to eradicate organisms 
harbouring mcr-1. Upon approval of clinical use of colis-
tin in China and other regions of the world this year or 
in the near future, the two colistin resistance-encoding 
plasmids described in our study may potentially spread 
in the hospital environment within a short period. The 
use of colistin to treat CRE infections may result in 
rapid selection of organisms that exhibit resistance 
to both carbapenems and colistin. This highlights the 
importance of vigilance and antimicrobial stewardship. 
Development of effective inhibitors for MCR-1 or inter-
vention measures to disrupt the transmission of these 
two plasmids may be an effective strategy to prolong 
the use of colistin as a last-line antibiotic to treat life-
threatening bacterial infections.
