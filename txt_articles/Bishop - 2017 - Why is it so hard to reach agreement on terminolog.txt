of developmental language disorder (DLD)

Abstract
A recent project entitled CATALISE used the Delphi method to reach a consensus on terminology for unexplained
language problems in children. ‘Developmental language disorder’ (DLD) was the term agreed by a panel of
57 experts. Here I reflect on points of difficulty that arose when attempting to reach a consensus, using qualitative
information from comments made by panel members to illustrate the kinds of argument used. One issue of debate
was the use of labels, in particular the term ‘disorder’, which was seen as having both pros and cons. The potential
for labels to stigmatize or create low expectations was a particular concern. However, labels could also ensure
language problems were not trivialized and could help avoid stigma by providing an explanation for behaviours
that might otherwise meet with disapproval. Further debate surrounded issues of how best to identify cases of
disorder. Although it was agreed there should be a focus on cases with a poor prognosis, it was recognized that
our knowledge of factors related to prognosis was still incomplete. Furthermore, there was a tension between
use of standardized tests, which allow for a relatively objective and reliable assessment of language, and more
qualitative observations, which can capture functional aspects of communication that are not always picked up on
formal assessment. Debate also surrounded the issue of the relationship between DLD and other conditions. Some
favoured drawing a distinction between DLD and language disorders associated with other conditions, and others
regarded such distinctions as unnecessary. We concluded that it was misleading to assume co-occurring conditions
were causes of language disorder, but it was helpful to distinguish DLD from cases of language disorder associated
with ‘differentiating conditions’ that had a known or likely biomedical origin, including brain injury, sensorineural
hearing loss, genetic syndromes, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, DLD could
co-occur with milder neurodevelopmental disorders that did not have a clear biomedical aetiology. Normal-range
non-verbal IQ has traditionally been incorporated in the diagnosis of DLD, but this was rejected as unsupported
by evidence. DLD is a category that has utility in identifying children who would benefit from speech–language
therapy services, but it should not be thought of as a well-defined condition. DLD has a multifactorial aetiology, is
heterogeneous in terms of language features and overlaps with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Our notions
of DLD are likely to be refined by further research into aetiology, associated characteristics and intervention
effectiveness.

What this paper adds
What is already known on the subject
Children’s language disorders have received far less recognition than other neurodevelopmental conditions such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder and developmental dyslexia. In part this
is a result of inconsistent terminology and definitions of language disorder. As a consequence, there is disagreement
as to which children should receive intervention.

What this paper adds to existing knowledge
In 2016–17, two linked projects were carried out using the Delphi method to work towards a consensus in the
criteria and terminology used for children’s language disorders. In this paper I use qualitative comments from the
evaluation panel to explore the reasons for debate in this area. Although some disagreements reflect an inadequate
research base, other issues involve fundamental questions about the impact and validity of diagnostic labels, and the
criteria for deciding who receives intervention.
What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?
Clinicians who wish to adopt the new terminology from the CATALISE study may find these reflections helpful
in clarifying the clinical and theoretical reasons behind the consensus statements. The paper also emphasizes that
the category of ‘developmental language disorder’ (DLD) is a useful shorthand rather than a specific syndrome—a
hypothesis to be refined in the light of new discoveries.
In 2015–16, an international group of experts, the
CATALISE panel, came together with the aim of achiev-
ing consensus on diagnostic terminology for children’s
language disorders. Ebbels (2014) documented the his-
tory of this development, with the need for consensus
being emphasized by several converging forces. First,
there was mounting evidence that children’s language
disorders received scant research funding in relation
to their frequency and severity (Bishop 2010). Then
in 2012, a live debate entitled ‘What IS Specific Lan-
guage Impairment’ took place at Moor House School,
a specialist school for children and young people with
speech and language difficulties. This failed to reach
agreement about how to diagnose or define specific lan-
guage impairment (SLI). In addition, a group that had
started a campaign for Raising Awareness of Language
Learning Impairments (RALLI) (Bishop et al. 2012)
was confronted with the difficulty of raising awareness
of a condition that was ill-defined, and where termi-
nology was inconsistent. In 2013, Sheena Reilly, in the
IJLCD Winter Lecture raised numerous questions about
the usefulness and validity of the term ‘SLI’, using data
from an Australian epidemiological study to argue that
the ‘specific’ part of the label was counterproductive and
misleading—views that were subsequently articulated in
this journal (Reilly et al. 2014b). To complement that
paper, I wrote a review outlining the major issues where
consensus was lacking, and suggesting various solutions
(Bishop 2014). Both papers appeared in a special issue
of this journal (Ebbels 2014), accompanied by com-
mentaries from experts covering a range of professional
groups and interests. The authors of the original focus
papers then collaborated to highlight the main points of
agreement and disagreement in the debate (Reilly et al.
2014a).
Starting in 2015, a two-stage project, CATALISE
(Criteria and Terminology Applied to Language Im-
pairments: Synthesising the Evidence), was developed
with the aim of yielding consensus statements about
children’s language disorders (Bishop et al. 2016, 2017).
The method adopted was the Delphi Survey Technique
(Hasson et al. 2000). This involves working with a panel
of experts who are provided with a set of statements
that they both rate and comment on. Panel members
were encouraged to cite research evidence to justify their
viewpoints. The process is iterative, with a new set of
statements being formulated on the basis of the previ-
ous round. This exercise, when conducted online, has
several advantages over in-person discussion. For a start,
panel members have time to think about the issues and
to complete their ratings at a time that is convenient.
This makes it possible for people to take part from
all over the world.1 Furthermore, each person’s ratings
and comments are fed back anonymously to the whole
panel. Anonymity avoids the discussion being domi-
nated or derailed by a few forceful individuals. If the
feedback indicates that one’s point of view is unpopu-
lar, it is possible to present arguments and evidence to
try to persuade others, or to revise one’s ratings. Two
moderators (Dorothy Bishop and Maggie Snowling),
who were not part of the panel, integrated the infor-
mation from each round, using the comments accom-
panying the ratings to identify the reasons for disagree-
ment and to revise statements to address these. The first
Delphi exercise focused on criteria and the second on
terminology.
One outcome of this exercise was the recommenda-
tion that the term ‘specific language impairment’ (SLI)
be abandoned in favour of ‘developmental language dis-
order’ (DLD). Rather than recapitulating the conclu-
sions of the two Delphi exercises, which are covered in
depth in two papers (Bishop et al. 2016, 2017), my aim
here is to use the comments offered by panel members
during these projects to reflect on the factors leading to
change and in particular to note reasons for controversy
in this area.
However, it is worth first emphasizing issues on
which there was good agreement from the outset. All
panel members recognized that some children have dif-
ficulties mastering their native language, and that these
 Terminology and the case of DLD
673
can be severe enough to impair their ability to function
well in educational and social contexts. In many cases
there is no obvious cause. A second point was that it was
important to reach agreement, because lack of consensus
had been damaging to the field, and did a disservice to
affected children and their families.
It was also agreed that language disorders in children
can take many forms. The classic ‘textbook’ case is of
a child whose language level is well below that of their
peers—for instance, a 4-year-old who talks more like a
typical 2-year-old, with simplified grammar and limited
vocabulary. Where the problems are as striking as this,
language difficulties are not hard to recognize, but what
of the child who has more subtle problems, or where
the difficulties involve the use rather than the form of
language? A core notion is that language is out of keeping
with the child’s general developmental level, but any
attempt to turn this idea into more specific criteria is
fraught with difficulties, not least because language is a
complex, multidimensional skill, which changes rapidly
with age.
We had expected that where there were disagree-
ments about definitions and terminology these might
divide along professional or national lines, but, as far as
our analysis could establish, this was not the case. Rather,
it seemed that where differences of opinion existed, it
was because of lack of evidence, or else because all so-
lutions that were discussed had disadvantages as well as
advantages. In effect, there was no gold standard against
which to evaluate terminology, and no ideal solution.
This creates an unstable situation because whatever so-
lution is adopted, problems will be noted, and there will
therefore be pressure for further change.
It may seem counterproductive to highlight points
of disagreement concerning the consensus statements
that we arrived at. If we want people to endorse the new
terminology, would it not be better to draw a veil over
the more contentious aspects? In my opinion, this would
reduce the credibility of the exercise by suggesting diffi-
cult issues were not grappled with. Furthermore, only by
being aware of both pros and cons can we mitigate any
negative consequences of new criteria and terminology,
while promoting the benefits.
Why do we need categorical labels?
Before we address the question of which labels to use, a
more primary question is whether it makes sense to use
labels at all. Most panel members took the need for an
agreed label as a given:
I think this is one of the reasons that children’s language
difficulties are not taken as seriously or recognized in
the same way as other conditions such as dyslexia or
ASD [autism spectrum disorder]. There are too many
different terms, that are being used in too many differ-
ent ways, so people are just not really paying attention
any more.
This is important across the board—for epidemiolog-
ical purposes, for clarity in individual research studies,
and for policy makers and service providers.
Given the lack of awareness of language disorder in both
professional and public fields, it is really important that
we as professionals with knowledge of this area can
reach a consensus on the terminology so that we can
move forward with providing services and recognition
for these children and their families.
However, labels influence how we think about con-
structs, with words dividing the world into distinct enti-
ties such as cats, dogs, desks and tables. Yet, in practice,
some of these entities are not clearly demarcated: the
boundary between desk and table, for instance, is not
sharp. Diagnostic terms can create an insidious problem
whereby the label is taken to mean that the child has
a clear-cut disorder with distinctive ‘symptoms’, which
can be distinguished from both typical development and
other developmental disorders. In fact, there is no sup-
port for a sharp dividing line between language disorder
and normality. Children develop language at different
rates, and some will have problems severe enough to
cause lifelong problems. But the differences between
children appear to be quantitative rather than qual-
itative, and can take many different forms (Leonard
1991, Dollaghan 2011). Much research literature has
focused on limitations of expressive syntax in children
with DLD, but as our assessments become more fine-
grained, it is evident that problems often affect under-
standing as well as production of complex language, and
can involve phonology, semantics and pragmatics as well
as grammatical structure.
It is all too easy for a label to become a master rather
than a servant, if we over-interpret its significance, rather
than regarding it as a useful shorthand. It is therefore im-
portant that if we use labels, we do so with full awareness
of their limitations, and recognizing that our terms are
socially constructed and historically specific. The term
we agreed on, ‘DLD’, is defined in terms of behaviours
that are complex, multifactorial and which vary on a
continuum. It is an umbrella term that includes a wide
range of problems, and the boundaries between DLD
and typical development are fuzzy. One panel mem-
ber noted that in the field of educational psychology
some people were turning away from the label ‘devel-
opmental dyslexia’ for children with reading problems
precisely because of arguments such as these (Elliott and
Grigorenko 2014).
Another panel member noted a further problem
caused by labels: their potential to stigmatize children:
 674
Dorothy V. M. Bishop
I am increasingly concerned that the exercise risks gen-
erating labels/categories for children that will be oper-
ationalized to allocate resources and will discriminate
against positive expectations for more than is scientifi-
cally justified.
Given these risks of misinterpretation, we need to con-
sider whether we could do away with labels altogether.
It was concluded, however, that this would create more
problems than it solved. As I have discussed previously
(Bishop 2014), diagnostic labels have utility in clinical
as well as research contexts. Labels allow us to commu-
nicate efficiently in a common language: without labels,
it would be difficult to plan services and to decide how
to allocate them. This issue is not specific to DLD: it
pervades all of psychiatry, including child psychiatry.
As Sonuga-Barke (1998: 117) noted, categorization is a
practical necessity in clinical practice:
To the extent that clinical economy depends on getting
the right treatment to the right people, clinicians are,
no matter what their philosophical bent or political
point of view, categorisers. At a purely practical level
this depends on a judgement being made that such and
such a child belongs to the category of those who ‘need
help’, whereas another child belongs to a (usually) larger
category who do not.
Nonetheless, at the same time as we strive to get better
resources to help those with DLD overcome their prob-
lems, we need to consider how best to create conditions
to combat stigma. A first point to note is that research on
children with DLD suggests that stigmatization is often
a reaction to the child’s communication difficulties
(Macharey and von Suchodoletz 2008). And experience
with other conditions suggests that labels can actually
help reduce stigma by improving understanding. In
the field of autism, for instance, a recent study found
that university students were more accepting of socially
atypical behaviour when they were told that the person
had a clinical diagnosis (of Asperger syndrome, autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) or schizophrenia) (Brosnan
and Mills 2016). One study found that while a general
label of ‘special educational needs’ was associated with
low self-esteem, a more specific label (in the case of this
study, ‘dyslexia’) was not (Taylor et al. 2010). In the
field of mental health, there is some evidence that
self-identifying with a stigmatized group can buffer the
individual against some of the negative effects (Crabtree
et al. 2010). Such research suggests that in raising
awareness of terminology, we should aim to provide
information in a way that will lead to better acceptance
and willingness of others to make adjustments to take
into account language limitations, and to facilitate indi-
viduals with DLD coming together for mutual support.
Second, we need to communicate diagnosis to affected
individuals and their families in a way that emphasizes
that DLD does not preclude achieving well in non-
linguistic domains and being a well-integrated member
of society. We need to celebrate the achievements
of those who have succeeded despite their language
difficulties. It is worth noting that I have searched the
internet for examples of positive role models of people
with DLD and not been able to find any—in sharp
contrast to dyslexia and ASD, where such role models
are numerous.
Use of the term ‘disorder’
Most of the panel welcomed the move towards a single
agreed term to refer to children with persistent language
problems, but there was much debate about the use of
the term ‘disorder’. As discussed by Bishop (2014), in
the field of education other terms such as ‘difficulties’
and ‘needs’ have been used. Other options are ‘im-
pairment’ and ‘disability’. These are sometimes used
interchangeably, and sometimes with subtly different
meanings. ‘Disorder’ was preferred by the CATALISE
panel for two reasons. First, it is the term used in
DSM5 and ICD-11, both for language problems and
for other neurodevelopmental conditions, especially
ASD, attention deficit disorder, and developmental
coordination disorder. It was deemed counterproduc-
tive to use terminology that was at odds with those
widely used systems. Second, as one panel member
said:
I feel it communicates the seriousness of the issue more
effectively than ‘impairment’.
A handful of panel members felt ‘disorder’ did not go far
enough, and that a more medical-sounding label would
be more effective:
We need a label with some authority. Once again, I
really do have to go back to the suggestion of dysphasia,
on analogy with dyslexia and dyspraxia. Terms like this
have the advantage of sounding like real conditions
(which is why parents will fight so hard for a ‘diagnosis’
of dyslexia). People sit up and take notice of it.
However, among commentators in the special issue, the
label ‘dysphasia’ had been one of the most unpopular
options. This illustrates a dilemma for the field: the la-
bels that sound most ‘medical’ are seen as misleading by
professionals, yet they are the terms that are most likely
to attract sympathy and attention. The parallel with
dyslexia is very moot here: although dyslexia is not a co-
herent syndrome (Elliott and Grigorenko 2014), moves
to drop the term from DSM5 were strongly resisted,
with the International Dyslexia Association mounting
a petition for its reinstatement, citing concerns that
diagnosis and intervention would be delayed if the more
generic and neutral term ‘specific learning disorder’
 Terminology and the case of DLD
675
were used instead (International Dyslexia Association
2012).
At the other extreme, there were concerns again
about reification of the term DLD, and stigmatization
and negative connotations.
The use of ‘disorder’ will be perceived as denoting a state
of being essentially, categorically, different and distinct
from those on the ‘normal’ distribution.
Although I agree with the term and the explanation
given, the use of the word ‘disorder’ has very negative
connotations for teachers and those within educational
policy. . . . There is no useful term that gets around
this issue, however.
The different viewpoints illustrated by these quotes em-
phasize the difficulty of finding an ideal solution. If we
use a term that reflects the fact that children have serious
problems and need support, this comes across as nega-
tive and could create a self-fulfilling prophecy; however,
if we use milder language that is not deemed stigmatiz-
ing, then we run the risk that children’s problems may
be trivialized, with consequent delays in identification
and intervention.
Traditional distinction between ‘disorder’ and ‘delay’
A quite different objection to the term DLD is that, at
least in the UK and some parts of the Irish Republic, ‘dis-
order’ has been interpreted contrastively as a condition
different from ‘language delay’. Indeed, we learned that
many speech–language therapists (SLTs) in the UK had
been trained to make this distinction. It embodies the
idea that there is a particular profile of language difficul-
ties, where there is a large mismatch between non-verbal
ability and language skills, and also an uneven profile of
ability within the language domain. This profile is seen
as the hallmark of ‘disorder’, whereas ‘delay’ is thought
to be characterized by an even pattern of impairment,
so that both verbal and non-verbal skills are like that of
a younger child. This distinction has assumed consid-
erable importance in some regions, where SLT services
are allocated only to children with ‘disorder’, and not to
those with ‘delay’—presumably because ‘delay’ is inter-
preted literally as indicating that the child will catch up
after a slow start.
It is hard to trace the origins of this distinction, but
it is clear that, despite its superficial plausibility, it does
not have empirical support. Thirty years ago, Bishop and
Edmundson (1987) used longitudinal data to test the
idea that an even pattern of language impairment had a
better prognosis than a more ‘spikey’ profile, with selec-
tive weakness in some domains. Their results were op-
posite to prediction: those with more selective problems
had the best outcomes, whereas those with more general
across-the-board impairments had the worse prognosis.
Thus, providers who restrict SLT services from those
who have ‘delayed’ profiles are denying help to those
children who are most in need. Nor is there any evi-
dence that speech–language therapy is only effective for
children with a large mismatch between language and
non-verbal skills (Cole et al. 1990), which is why the
American Speech–Language–Hearing Association does
not support ‘cognitive referencing’, i.e., using the dis-
crepancy between non-verbal IQ and language as a ba-
sis for allocating services (American Speech–Language–
Hearing Association 2016). Given the widespread use of
the delay/disorder distinction, it is vital that those using
DLD are clear that, as used by the CATALISE panel,
the term ‘disorder’ does not entail any discrepancies,
either between verbal and non-verbal development, or
between different language functions.
Criteria for language disorder: focus on poor
prognosis
The definition of DLD agreed by the panel applies
specifically to children with poor prognosis. This averted
a concern that children with mild and transient difficul-
ties might be labelled as ‘disordered’. However, a fo-
cus on poor prognosis does raise concerns that children
might be written off, or that parents will be discouraged
if they are told that their child’s problems are unlikely
to resolve with time. Most panel members agreed that
this criterion made sense, and indeed could lead to fairer
allocation of resources, but it is clear that it needs to be
applied cautiously:
I think the focus on prognosis is important. It also
makes clear that the children who require intervention
are the children with a poor prognosis. Currently in
many areas of the UK children with poor prognosis are
not receiving services because they clog up the system
and can’t be discharged easily! The focus on the tier 3
children who won’t make progress without help may
help to counter this shift in service delivery.2
There were, however, two concerns: first, did we
know enough about prognostic factors to be able to
judge this appropriately?; and second, would this mean
denying services to children who would benefit from
intervention?
we need to look further into the research and agree
more solid indicators of long-term language learning
difficulties.
There was variable awareness among CATALISE mem-
bers of existing research on predictors of outcome. Our
panel included several experts who had been involved in
running longitudinal studies and were in general sup-
portive of using prognosis as a criterion, but others had
concerns about the feasibility of identifying children
 676

who were likely to have longstanding problems. Between
these extremes were those who thought that even if we
have good predictors from research, they may apply only
to the specific population that was studied, and predic-
tion may also not be precise enough to make accurate
judgements about individual children. Over and above
this concern, was the question of whether children with
good prognosis should be excluded from specialist help.
I think it is important not to exclude children who may
have, for example, very poor expressive language, which
is causing them considerable difficulties, but might re-
spond very well to specialist input. . . . Even if they do
catch up reasonably quickly in relative terms, the chil-
dren might still have lost ground and had a miserable
couple of years, which might itself have long lasting
effects.
This latter point emphasized that the criteria adopted
could change the balance of which children would
gain access to resources. Throughout the process,
comments were made which indicated how seriously
panel members took this: many thought that current
allocation of SLT services was not fair, but others
worried that a move to a different set of criteria might
leave children who might benefit from SLT intervention
without any help. The impression was that, for those
with clinical caseloads, views were strongly influenced
by personal experience: it was clear that most panel
members were concerned that large numbers of children
were unfairly excluded from access to services, but
while some maintained that those with the most severe
problems were denied help, others took the opposite
view and noted that it was children with milder and
more selective language difficulties who risked being
excluded from intervention.
This debate emphasized the lack of a good evidence
base for making rational decisions in this area. Of course,
we do not want to expend scarce resources on children
who will either improve without help, or who are un-
likely to benefit from intervention. But in the absence of
a strong evidence base, it seemed that subjective impres-
sions were often used to distinguish these groups. One
point where the evidence was clear concerned the diffi-
culty of predicting outcomes in late-talking toddlers: a
diagnosis of DLD would be difficult to justify in a child
under 3 years of age unless there were notable com-
prehension difficulties. In cases where the prognosis is
hard to judge, which would include many pre-school
children, the more generic term ‘speech, language and
communication needs’ (SLCN), already in widespread
use in the UK, would seem more appropriate for flag-
ging up problems than the more clinical diagnosis of
DLD.
As reviewed by Bishop et al. (2017), we do have
better prognostic indicators for children from around
5 years of age when it becomes reasonable to identify
children whose problems are unlikely to resolve with-
out help. Nevertheless, it is frustrating that even when
we have evidence from longitudinal studies, the clinical
application of the findings is often limited because of
an emphasis on demonstrating that a predictor is sta-
tistically significant, rather than on its effectiveness in
predicting individual outcomes.
Also, there can be difficult decisions even when evi-
dence is available: should resources go to those who can
easily be treated effectively, or to those with the most
severe functional impairments? These are unlikely to be
the same children.
In addition, this raises the question of what the goals
of intervention should be. It might seem obvious that a
successful intervention is one that improves the child’s
language skills so that they are at the level of the peer
group. Yet for some children, more modest goals—of
providing strategies to cope with language difficulties,
and modifying the environment to make the language
impairments less detrimental—may be more realistic.
If evaluation studies focus solely on language tests as
outcome measures, then this may underestimate the
benefits of intervention. To get a more realistic impres-
sion of outcomes, measures of quality of life, family
functioning, social integration and self-esteem should be
included.
Overall, it became clear that a discussion that was
on the surface about diagnostic criteria was heavily in-
fluenced by beliefs about which groups should be given
priority when intervention resources were scarce.
Criteria for language disorder: How objective and
standardized should we be?
Further tensions were revealed between those who felt
it was important to use objective measures with strong
psychometric credentials and to avoid reliance on sub-
jective judgements, and those who thought that formal
language assessments failed to capture key features of
children’s language problems and might both over- and
under-diagnose problems.
The first quotation illustrates the former concern,
the second the latter:
I have concerns about relying on parents/teacher iden-
tification. Parents may not have enough information
about typical language development and/or may miss
comprehension difficulties. Also, there are equity issues.
Children whose caregivers are least able to identify lan-
guage issues may be children particularly in need of
support.
I agree that testing is important, however I feel that
in order to establish severity, functional assessment
 Terminology and the case of DLD
677
(informal observation for example) must be included
as well as standardized testing.
Concerns were also expressed about poor sensitivity and
specificity of standardized language assessment batteries,
and their inability to detect some important aspects of
impairment, such as pragmatic difficulties:
single tests measuring single components of the lan-
guage system often do not possess the most robust psy-
chometric properties.
we need to discuss the tools that are used to identify
these problems as they have many flaws and it is likely
that a multiple of assessment types, different for each
age and skill level will be needed.
The consensus of the CATALISE panel was that test
scores provided useful information but should not be
used as the sole criterion for identifying language disor-
der. It was key that there should be evidence of functional
impairment, i.e., the language problem impacted on the
child’s social interaction and/or educational progress.
Nevertheless, it was noted that we lack good assess-
ments for many aspects of language, and that reliance
on subjective judgements created scope for biased and
inequitable decisions.
Differentiating conditions rather than
exclusionary criteria
Exclusionary criteria have traditionally been a key part
of the diagnosis of SLI, but this part of the defini-
tion has been roundly criticized, notably by Reilly et al.
(2014b). The CATALISE panel had many deliberations
over whether we should differentiate between children
whose language difficulties had no obvious cause and
those whose difficulties occurred in the context of a spe-
cific aetiology, such as brain damage, hearing loss or a
genetic syndrome. We concluded that where there is a
differentiating condition ‘X’, the term ‘language disor-
der with X’ would be used rather than DLD. This dis-
tinction is important in many research contexts, where
it may be desirable to focus on a relatively homogeneous
group.
The discussion revealed several different factors that
led to tension. Implicit in the debate are three issues.
First, can we regard a co-existing condition as the cause
of the language disorder? Second, does the presence of a
specific aetiology mean that no intervention should be
offered for language disorder? Third, if intervention is
offered, should it be of a different kind than for children
with no obvious aetiology? In addition, the answers to
all these questions will depend on exactly what we regard
as a co-existing condition.
The first issue may be illustrated with the case of
hearing loss. A severe or profound congenital hearing
loss is a major risk factor for poor development of
oral language. However, if the child has exposure to
signed language, good language skills are usually demon-
strated.Similarly,manychildren can make good progress
in oral language if given a cochlear implant. Never-
theless, there are hearing-impaired children who have
problems learning sign language, and others who have
disproportionate difficulties with oral language acquisi-
tion after a cochlear implant (Hawker et al. 2008). And
this should not surprise us: we should expect to see a
proportion of children with hearing loss who also have
genetic risk factors for language disorder. While this ex-
ample illustrates the dangers of explaining away a child’s
language disorder in terms of an associated condition,
it is not an argument for simply ignoring the associ-
ated condition when identifying language disorder. It is
rather an argument for documenting carefully the range
as well as the nature of language problems associated
with a specific aetiology.
The discussion about causality was pervaded by con-
cerns that if a child’s language disorder was thought to
be ‘explained’ by an associated condition, then no inter-
vention would be offered. Although this has sometimes
been used as a justification for denying services to chil-
dren, it is not a logically coherent stance. If extended
to medicine as a whole, it would mean that we would
only offer treatment for conditions of unknown aetiol-
ogy! The panel agreed that it is not appropriate to deny
intervention to a child because they has a co-existing
condition, provided the child meets criteria for language
disorder (in terms of severity and prognosis).
[The term ‘language disorder associated with X’] is a
great idea not only because it explicitly describes the
association, but also because it sends the important
message that problems in one area do not ‘protect’ chil-
dren from having other difficulties. Parents of children
with associated difficulties (e.g. Down syndrome) are
sometimes frustrated by the lack of recognition of their
child having a language disorder on top of the language
difficulties associated with Down syndrome. And of
course there is the important work on ASD with and
without language disorder.
On the third issue, many felt that a different approach
to intervention might be required if the child’s language
problems occurred in the context of a known aetiology.
To continue with the example of hearing loss, inter-
vention might include giving the child a hearing aid
or cochlear implant, and/or introducing sign language,
or having an SLT focus on presenting information via
the visual modality. It was noted that there were many
disorders where it helped to make this distinction:
I do agree that there are children who have disordered
language for various reasons who would not best fit into
the traditional ‘SLI’ care pathways.

There was, however, a contrasting view that children
with differentiating conditions might not be offered in-
terventions which could be useful—just because it was
assumed they would not work:
some children with ASD appear to have a primary
grammatical language impairment which would not
be typical of ASD, yet they are not offered the same
intervention that other children showing these patterns
of language learning would be offered.
it is important to note that they may NOT indicate a
different treatment pathway. For example, milieu com-
munication training has been shown to efficacious for
children with language disorders associated both with
ID and ASD.
I think our intervention research has been mostly di-
rected to fairly narrowly defined categories, with some
exceptions. So the presumed different intervention
pathways might turn out to have more in common than
we think—for example, similar approaches might affect
significant change in the morpho-syntactic difficulties
of a child with Down syndrome and morpho-syntactic
difficulties in SLI.
The discussions of these issues made it clear that, once
again, one reason for disagreements was lack of a good
evidence base: very little was known about efficacy
of language interventions for children with co-existing
biomedical conditions. The need for more research ex-
plicitly comparing different conditions was highlighted
by our study. The best way to counteract concerns that
budget-holders would deny services to children with ad-
ditional conditions would be to provide evidence that
intervention is effective with these groups.
These arguments, together with the need for re-
searchers to study relatively homogeneous groups, led to
general agreement that we should distinguish between
language disorder associated with a ‘differentiating
condition’ and DLD, while recommending that in both
cases the language disorder merited assessment and
intervention.
The question, then, was what to include in
‘differentiating conditions’. We settled on a definition
that included biomedical conditions such as a genetic
syndrome, a sensorineural hearing loss or neurological
disease. The conditions of ASD and intellectual disabil-
ity led to some debate, but it was decided to include
these as differentiating conditions, because, on the one
hand, impairments of communication are a reliable fea-
ture of these conditions and, on the other, accelerating
genetic advances mean that a biomedical aetiology is
becoming evident for a high proportion of affected chil-
dren (McRae et al. 2017). In practice, a differentiating
condition would typically be the main diagnosis, with
language disorder seen as a component of the condition.
DLD in relation to other neurodevelopmental
disorders
The notion of ‘differentiating condition’ does not
encompass milder neurodevelopmental disorders of un-
known origin, such as ADHD or developmental coordi-
nation disorder. These do not have a clear-cut aetiology,
and their association with language disorder is weaker
than for the differentiating conditions noted above.
One reason for rejecting the previous term ‘SLI’ was
because ‘specific’ could be taken to imply that the child
had no difficulties except with language. In contrast,
our definition of DLD emphasizes that these idiopathic
neurodevelopmental disorders can co-occur with DLD.
Because different professional groups are concerned with
different conditions—educators with dyslexia, SLTs
with DLD, paediatricians and psychiatrists with ADHD
and ASD–children often receive a rather one-sided
assessment, depending on the professional they see. We
emphasized that the fact that a child may have ADHD
or dyslexia does not preclude a diagnosis of DLD and
does not mean that the SLT should not be involved. The
ways in which children’s problems manifest does not
neatly divide up according to professional specialities.
This view of overlap between neurodevelopmental
disorders is supported by research on aetiology, which
has shown that the causes of these conditions are often
complex and multifactorial, resulting from the com-
bined impact of many small genetic and environmental
influences: the precise profile of problems that is seen
in a child may depend on the particular constellation
of aetiological factors, so we do not see sharp bound-
aries between conditions, but rather different permuta-
tions and combinations of impairments. Furthermore,
although different disorders co-occur at above chance
levels, they can be dissociated, suggesting that they may
be separate consequences of common risk factors.
Comments from panel members made it clear that
the question of how to handle co-occurring disorders
was easier if one avoided attempting to specify causal
relationships, e.g., if a child has both attentional prob-
lems and language problems, it is useful to be aware of
this, but it may be impossible to disentangle whether
attentional problems cause language problems or vice
versa:
co-occurring disorders could be defined as impairments
in other cognitive or behavioural domains that can co-
occur with language disorder and may affect prognosis,
but which do not include impairments of communi-
cation as core symptoms. I would avoid discussion of
cause.
The role of non-verbal IQ in diagnosis
As discussed by Bishop (2014) and Reilly et al. (2014),
traditionally, the diagnosis of SLI has required a
 Terminology and the case of DLD
679
non-verbal IQ within normal limits. In some diagnostic
systems, an even more stringent requirement of a large
mismatch between verbal and non-verbal ability is
required. The CATALISE panel considered the evidence
for this and concluded this criterion was not valid.
Many panel members were supportive of dropping it.
I agree in so far as I do not want any discrimination
on the basis of (non-verbal or any other concept of
cognitive) ability.
This is an important equity issue.
Again, the argument was that the focus should be on
the child’s language needs, rather than on putative aeti-
ology. Others, however, noted this would be a major de-
parture from current practice and expressed reservations
about expanding the category of DLD, thereby placing
pressure on services. Concern was expressed that a less
restrictive definition of language disorder could lead to
a watering down of the concept that would ultimately
lead to a reduction in services:
If we lose the conceptualisation of language impair-
ment as being a weakness in language skills relative
to the child’s average non-verbal ability, then service
providers might take the view that if there is no distinc-
tion between children of low ability across the board
(who do not usually access a high level of therapy) and
children with (specific) language difficulties, then it is
not necessary to provide enhanced levels of SLT to any
of them.
There also was evidence of local differences in how inter-
vention resources were allocated. As noted above, practi-
tioners from the UK and Republic of Ireland noted that
a selective language problem (with normal non-verbal
ability) was usually required in order for the child to be
offered SLT services, but in other places quite the oppo-
site was described, and there was concern that children
with more selective problems might lose out:
I regularly encounter situations where services have
been denied to families because their children only pre-
sented with language impairments. The risk of under-
treatment in these cases is also what our epidemiological
data have been telling us.
Overall, the view of the panel was that resources should
not dictate diagnostic criteria. Discrepancy between ver-
bal and non-verbal ability is not indicative of underly-
ing aetiology—for example, Bishop (1994) found that
identical twins with language problems often had very
similar language profiles, yet could vary in non-verbal
ability, with one meeting traditional discrepancy crite-
ria for SLI, and the other not. Furthermore, for a child
without a biomedical syndrome, the level of non-verbal
IQ does not appear to determine responsiveness to ther-
apy. There does not, therefore, appear to be any justi-
fication for using a verbal–non-verbal discrepancy as a
diagnostic criterion; the overall view of the panel was
that if this change led to more children being identified
with DLD, then the case should be made for adequate
resources to offer services to all of them.
Note that this does not mean that intellectual level
is totally disregarded. As noted above, where the child
meets criteria for intellectual disability, then we would
treat that as the primary diagnosis and talk of ‘lan-
guage disorder with intellectual disability’. The current
DSM-5 definition of intellectual disability requires that
the child shows both ‘intellectual deficits and adaptive
deficits that fail to meet the standards for personal inde-
pendence’ (Harris 2013, 261).
Our definition of DLD would, however, include a
case where a child with language problems has a level of
non-verbal ability that is neither impaired enough to jus-
tify a diagnosis of intellectual disability nor good enough
to be discrepant with overall language level. These chil-
dren have historically ‘fallen through the cracks’ of di-
agnostic systems, and hence been deemed ineligible for
speech and language therapy services.
Conclusions
Many of the issues raised by this analysis apply not just
to language disorders but to neurodevelopmental dis-
orders more broadly. Indeed, questions about diagno-
sis and terminology pervade all of psychiatry (Sonuga-
Barke 1998).
As we proceeded through the Delphi studies, we
were confronted by a key question: How would we know
when we had a good solution? In practice, in a Delphi
exercise the goal is to achieve a reasonable agreement
between experts, and we were satisfied to accept a solu-
tion where we had a set of statements that at least 75%
agreed with. But, as is all too apparent in many walks of
life, the fact that a lot of people agree with something
does not make it true. Ideally we would like to be able
to show that our solution worked better than what had
gone before. But what does ‘work better’ mean?
The ideal would be to find a solution that ‘carves
nature at its joints’, such that DLD would identify
a group of children with a distinct aetiology, corre-
lated features and response to intervention. However,
as Sonuga-Barke noted, this may be an unrealistic ambi-
tion if the reality is more dimensional than categorical.
In the case of DLD, we have heterogeneity of language
problems, and overlap between disorders affecting lan-
guage and other domains. Despite this heterogeneity we
have made some progress: our knowledge of aetiology,
characteristics and effective intervention in this area has
advanced over the years. Nevertheless, to improve our
classification we need more research that carefully doc-
uments the nature of children’s language difficulties in
relation to prognosis, associated factors and response to

intervention. The validity of the term ‘DLD’ will de-
pend on whether it helps us move forward to a better
understanding of what is clearly a heterogeneous cate-
gory, bearing in mind that, as Sonuga-Barke noted, the
category is a hypothesis to be tested and refined. Mean-
while, it is to be hoped that a clearer specification of
DLD and agreement about use of this term will lead to
a more equitable and effective allocation of services to
children who experience severe and persistent language
problems.
Notes
1. In CATALISE, we restricted the panel to participants from
English-speaking countries; it is clearly important to extend to
other languages, but we were aware that the debate would be
complex enough without having to take onboard further lin-
guistic and cultural differences that might affect how language
disorders manifest and are treated.
2. In a Response to Intervention framework, three tiers of interven-
tion/prevention are identified, with tier 3 referring to the level
of individualized intervention needed for children with the most
severe problems.
