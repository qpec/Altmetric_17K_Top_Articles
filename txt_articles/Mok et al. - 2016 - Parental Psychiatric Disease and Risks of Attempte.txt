IMPORTANCE Self-directed and interpersonal violence share some common risk factors such
as a parental history of mental illness. However, relationships between the full spectrum of
parental psychiatric disease and these 2 related outcomes are unclear.
OBJECTIVE To examine associations between the full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease
and risks of attempted suicide and violent offending among offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study of all persons born in
Denmark 1967 through 1997, followed up from their 15th birthday until occurrence of adverse
outcome or December 31, 2012, whichever came first.
EXPOSURES Array of parental psychiatric disorders and parental suicide attempt, delineated
from records of secondary care treatments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Using survival analyses techniques, incidence rate ratios
were estimated for offspring suicide attempt and violent offending.
RESULTS We examined 1 743 525 cohort members (48.7% female; total follow-up, 27.2 million
person-years). Risks for offspring suicide attempt and violent offending were elevated across
virtually the full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease. Incidence rate ratios were the most
elevated for parental diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (suicide attempt, 3.96; 95%
CI, 3.72-4.21; violent offending, 3.62; 95% CI, 3.41-3.84) and cannabis misuse (suicide
attempt, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.25-3.92; violent offending, 4.05; 95% CI, 3.72-4.39), and for parental
suicide attempt (suicide attempt, 3.42; 95% CI, 3.29-3.55; violent offending, 3.31; 95% CI,
3.19-3.44). Parental mood disorders (and bipolar disorder in particular) conferred more
modest risk increases. A history of mental illness or suicide attempt in both parents was
associated with double the risks compared with having just 1 affected parent. Associations
between parental psychiatric disease and offspring violent offending were stronger for
female than for male offspring, whereas little sex difference in risk was found for offspring
suicide attempt.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The similarities in risk patterns observed between the 2
outcomes may evidence a shared etiology. Early interventions to tackle parental mental
disorders may be beneficial to both parents and children.

V
iolence, both interpersonal and self-directed, pre-
sents a serious public health concern constituting a sig-
nificant cause of premature death, disability, and ill
health.1,2 Studies from both psychiatric and forensic popula-
tions suggest that these 2 behaviors are associated, with
elevated risks for aggression being found among those who
engage in self-harm and vice versa.3,4 For example, elevated
suicide risk was reported among violent offenders, par-
ticularly in those convicted for homicide or attempted
homicide.5 The 2 behaviors are thought to share common
determinants such as emotional dysregulation, lack of
impulse control, poor problem-solving skills, substance use,
and mental illnesses.3,4 It has been well established that sui-
cidal and violent behaviors aggregate within families, via
possible interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and social
and environmental influences.6-8 Elevated risks for the 2
behaviors in offspring have also been linked with a parental
history of mental illnesses.9-13 However, to our knowledge,
no studies have investigated the full spectrum of parental
psychiatric disease and both offspring suicide attempts and
violent offending jointly in the same population. Previous
studies examining broadly defined parental mental disorders
(such as “personality disorders”) may also mask important
heterogeneity according to diagnostic subcategories.10-12 For
example, borderline personality disorder is often linked
with elevated risks for attempted suicide14,15 whereas in-
terpersonal violence is related to antisocial personality
disorder.16,17 However, it remains unclear how a parental
diagnosis of these disorders is associated with risks of sui-
cidal and violent behaviors in offspring, and how these risks
compare between the 2 outcomes and in relation to other
parental diagnoses.
For the study reported herein, we examined the associa-
tions between the full spectrum of parental psychiatric dis-
ease and attempted suicide and violent offending among
offspring. To enable like-for-like comparison, relative risks for
both adverse outcomes were estimated in the same cohort at
risk. The full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease inves-
tigated was delineated as follows:
1. Any mental disorders
2. Any organic mental disorders; specifically, dementia in Alz-
heimer disease and vascular dementia
3. Anysubstanceusedisorders;specifically,alcoholmisuseand
cannabis misuse
4. Schizophrenia and related disorders (hereafter “broad
schizophrenia”);specifically,schizophrenia(hereafter“nar-
row schizophrenia”) and schizoaffective disorder
5. Any mood disorders; specifically, bipolar disorder, recur-
rent depressive disorder, and single and recurrent depres-
sive disorders
6. Any anxiety and somatoform disorders; specifically, obses-
sive compulsive disorder
7. Any personality disorders; specifically, borderline person-
ality disorder and antisocial personality disorder
8. Suicide attempt.
We also examined associations by offspring sex, and by
exposure to psychiatric disease in the mother only, father only,
and in both parents.
Methods
Study Population
ThestudywasapprovedbytheDanishDataProtectionAgency.
Since 1968, all persons living in Denmark have been regis-
tered in the Danish Civil Registration System, which captures
information such as date of birth, parents’identities, and con-
tinuously updated information on vital status.18 The unique
personalidentificationnumberenablesaccuratelinkageacross
all national registers. The study cohort included all persons
born in Denmark to Danish-born parents during 1967 through
1997 who resided in the country on their 15th birthday
(N = 1 743 525, 48.7% female). Because this project was based
exclusivelyonregistrydata,accordingtotheDanishActonPro-
cessing of Personal Data, Section 10, informed consent from
persons in the study population was not required.
Parental Mental Disorders
Historiesofmentalillnessforcohortmembers’parentswereob-

contains data on all admissions to psychiatric inpatient facili-
ties from 1969 onward. Information on all contacts with out-

was included from 1995 onward. The International Classifica-
tionofDiseasescodes(TenthRevisionandEighthRevision)used
to delineate the parental mental disorders examined are pre-
sented in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Onset of each parental
mental disorder of interest was defined as the date of first
contact (inpatient, outpatient, or psychiatric emergency care).

applied previously20 using information from the Psychiatric
Central Research Register19 and National Patient Register.21

Key Points
Question How are risks of attempted suicide and violent
offending in offspring related to the full spectrum of parental
psychiatric disease?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 1 743 525
persons, risks for offspring suicide attempt and violent offending
were significantly elevated across virtually the full spectrum of
parental psychiatric disease. For both adverse outcomes in
offspring, the greatest elevations in risk were linked with parental
diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder, cannabis misuse, and
prior suicide attempt.
Meaning The similarities in relative risk patterns observed may
evidence a shared etiology between self-directed and
interpersonal violent behaviors.

Socioeconomic Status
Parental socioeconomic status (SES), assessed in the year of
cohort members’15th birthdays, was measured via paternal
andmaternalincome,highesteducationalattainment,andem-
ployment status.23 To examine effects of interactions be-
tween parental SES and parental mental disorder, SES was
stratified as lower, middle, and higher. These classifications
were applied as described previously.24
Study Design and Statistical Analyses
Cohortmemberswerefollowedupfromtheir15thbirthdayun-
til date of adverse outcome of interest, death, emigration from
Denmark,orDecember31,2012,whichevercamefirst.The2ad-
verse outcomes were analyzed separately. The cohort was fol-
lowed up for a total of 27.2 million person-years. Persons with
a first suicide attempt before follow-up at age 15 years were ex-
cludedfromthesuicideattemptanalyses.Log-linearPoissonre-
gressionmodels,implementedinR,version3.1.2,werefittedto
estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs). All models were adjusted
foroffspringage,sex,calendaryear,andtheirinteractions.Inad-
dition, the potential confounding and modifying effects of pa-
rental SES were also assessed. Offspring age, calendar year, and

the median age of onset for the 2 outcomes being 21.6 and 20.6
years, respectively. Males represented 46.7% of those who had
attempted suicide and 90.0% of those with a violent offense
conviction. Of the 91 800 persons who had at least 1 adverse
outcome during the follow-up period, 39.6% attempted sui-
cide only, 51.6% were only convicted of a first violent of-
fense, and 8.8% had both outcomes. Table 1 gives the num-
ber of incident cases and incidence rates in relation to the full
spectrum of parental psychiatric disease, with at least 1 par-
ent being affected. The highest incidence rates, for both ad-
verse outcomes, were linked with parental cannabis misuse
and attempted suicide.
Incidence rate ratios for the 2 outcomes by types of paren-
tal disorder, adjusted for age, sex, and calendar year, are pre-
sentedinTable2.Foreachparentalexposureexamined,theref-
erence group for IRR estimation was the group with neither
parent affected by the particular disorder of interest. Risks for
offspring suicide attempt and violent offending were elevated
across the full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease, except
for Alzheimer disease, for which no significant link with off-
spring violent offending was found. For both offspring out-
comes,theassociationswereparticularlystrongforparentalan-
tisocial personality disorder, cannabis misuse, and parental
suicide attempt. Conversely, parental mood disorders, in par-
ticular bipolar disorder, conferred some of the lowest risk el-
evations, especially in relation to offspring violent offending.
We next investigated separately (1) those exposed to the
parental disorder of interest only vs (2) those exposed to the
disorder of interest in addition to other parental disorders.
These results are presented in Tables 3 and 4. The reference
group for IRR estimation was the group with neither a history
of parental mental illness nor parental suicide attempt. Expo-
sure to more than 1 parental disorder was common. Offspring
of parents with cannabis misuse or antisocial personality dis-
order in addition to other disorders, or those with a parental
history of both mental illness and suicide attempt, were at par-
ticularly high risks for both adverse outcomes. However, risks
remained elevated for most of the parental diagnoses even
when exposures to multiple parental disorders had been ac-
counted for. Again, risks for both adverse outcomes were par-
ticularly high among those who were exposed only to paren-
tal antisocial personality disorder, or among those with a
parental history of suicide attempt without mental disorder.
Exposure to parental cannabis misuse only was also strongly
linked with elevated risk for offspring violent offending. How-
ever, no significant associations between parental cannabis
misuse and offspring suicide attempt were found after expo-
sure to multiple disorders was accounted for.
Results adjusted for parental SES are given in eTable 2 in
the Supplement. Comparison with Table 1 shows that be-
tween 20% and 50% of the elevated risks for offspring sui-
cideattemptandviolentoffendingwereaccountedforbythose
confounding influences. However, even after making this ad-
ditional adjustment, risk of violent offending was still particu-
larly elevated among those with a parental history of suicide
attempt, or with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder
or cannabis misuse, while attempted suicide risk remained el-
evated particularly for those exposed to parental suicide at-
tempt or antisocial personality disorder. There were also sig-
nificant interactions between parental mental disorder and
parentalSESfortheriskofbothadverseoutcomes(χ2
22 = 120.8,
P < .001 for suicide attempt; χ2
22 = 170.4, P < .001 for violent
offending). Further details can be found in eResults 1 and
eTable 3 in the Supplement.
The Figure shows the IRRs for the 2 offspring outcomes
in relation to whether the mother only, father only, or both par-
ents had a history of any psychiatric diagnosis or suicide at-
tempt, stratified by offspring sex. Compared with having only
1 affected parent, a history of psychiatric disease in both par-
ents was associated with doubled risks of both adverse out-
comes in offspring. The associations between parental psy-
chiatric disease and offspring violent offending were stronger
for female than for male offspring (P < .001), particularly when
both parents were affected. Conversely, there was little hetero-
geneityinIRRestimatesforattemptedsuicidebyoffspringsex.
Further discussion of these results is reported in eResults 2 in

Discussion
Main Findings
Elevated risks for offspring attempted suicide and violent of-
fending were evident across a broad spectrum of parental psy-
chiatric disease. Risks were particularly elevated for parental
diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder, cannabis mis-
use,andpriorsuicideattempt,whereaslowerelevationsinrisk
were seen in relation to parental mood disorders—bipolar dis-
order in particular. The similarities in relative risk patterns ob-
served for both adverse outcomes indicate that self-directed
and interpersonal violence may have a shared etiology. A his-
tory of mental illnesses or suicide attempt in both parents was
associated with doubled risks vs having only 1 affected par-
ent. Associations between parental psychiatric disease and off-
spring violent offending were stronger for female than for male
offspring, whereas the sex-specific IRRs for offspring suicide
attempt were generally comparable.
Existing Evidence and Interpretations
This is the first study to investigate the full spectrum of paren-
tal psychiatric disease and offspring suicide attempt and vio-
lent offending in the same population. Our findings for suicide
attemptalignwiththosefromaSwedishnationalregistrystudy,
which found that risks were particularly elevated for offspring
exposedtoparentalpersonalitydisorders,suicideattempt,and
substance misuse.10 Similarly, the World Mental Health sur-
veysrevealedthatelevatedriskofoffspringsuicideattemptwas
linked with parental depression, panic or generalized anxiety
disorder, substance misuse, and suicidal behavior.9 However,
neitherparentalpersonalitydisordersnorsubcategorieswithin
substance use were investigated.9 Specific types of personal-
ity disorders were also not examined in the Swedish study.10
Strong associations between parental personality disor-
dersandsubstancemisuseandoffspringviolentoffendinghave
previously been reported from a Danish national registry
study.11Byexaminingsubcategorieswithinthesedisorders,we

additionallyrevealedthatoffspringviolentoffendingriskswere
especially elevated in relation to parental cannabis misuse and
antisocial personality disorder, even after adjustment for other
parental disorders. Among persons with a personality disor-
der diagnosis, attempted suicide is particularly strongly linked
with borderline personality disorder14,15 whereas interper-
sonal violence is closely related to antisocial personality
disorder.16,17 By investigating these 2 adverse behaviors in the
same population, we found that risks for both were more
strongly associated with parental antisocial personality dis-
order than with parental borderline personality disorder.
Shared genetic vulnerability to psychiatric disease may be
1 possible pathway that could explain our findings,25 although
theintergenerationaltransmissionofsuicidalriskshasbeenre-
ported to be independent of familial transmission of mental
disorders.6,9,10,26 In the full spectrum of disorders examined
here, the strongest associations with offspring suicide attempt
and violent offending were found with parental antisocial
personality disorder, substance use disorder, and suicide at-
tempt. These associations remained relatively strong even af-
ter adjustment for parental SES or other parental disorders, ex-
ceptforthelinkbetweenparentalcannabismisuseandoffspring
suicide attempt, which was no longer significant after the ef-
fects of other parental disorders were accounted for. Sub-
stancemisuseandantisocialpersonalitydisorder,aswellassui-
cidalbehaviorandviolenceperpetration,areoftencharacterized
bybehavioraldysregulationandimpulsive-aggressivetraits,4,17
which may also contribute to elevated risks of deaths from ac-
cidents and other causes among those with a history of
self-harm.27 Evidence has supported the heritability of these
traits, which have also been identified as possible intermedi-
ate phenotypes for suicidal behavior.28-30 The intergenera-
tionaltransmissionofsuchtraitsmaythuscontributetothepar-
ticularly high risks for suicidal behavior and violent offending
amongthosewithaparentalhistoryofantisocialpersonalitydis-
order,substancemisuse,andsuicideattempt.Inaddition,higher
levels of impulsivity and aggression in offspring and their par-
ents were more strongly linked with younger than with older
agesuicidalbehaviors.31-33Theearlymedianagesofonsetofoff-
spring adverse outcomes in our cohort may thus lend further
support to the familial transmission of these traits.
Children of parents with a history of psychiatric disease
are at increased risk of being additionally exposed to other ad-
versities such as maladaptive parenting practice, family vio-
lence, abuse, neglect, and financial hardship, and the impact
of these harmful environmental factors on offspring risks of

suicidal behavior and violence perpetration is thought to be
cumulative.34-37 However, even after SES adjustment, many of
thelinksbetweenparentalpsychiatricdiseaseandoffspringsui-
cide attempt and violent offending in our study remained sig-
nificantly elevated. Exposure to adversities during childhood
and sensitive developmental periods may also lead to altera-
tion of gene expression via epigenetic processes, resulting in
altered neurobiological function such as stress-responsive sys-
tems,increasingvulnerabilityforadverseoutcomessuchassui-
cidal and aggressive behaviors in later life.29,38
Our study revealed that having 2 parents affected by psy-
chiatric disease doubled the risks for both adverse outcomes
vs cohort members with only 1 affected parent. Evidence for
assortative mating has been reported in psychiatric pop-
ulations.39 The doubling of risks observed could be attrib-
uted not only to the inheritance of disorders or traits from both
parents but also to disturbed family environments exacer-
bated by having 2 parents affected by mental illnesses. Our
study has also shown that, for most of the parental disorders
examined, associations between parental psychiatric disease
and offspring violent offending were stronger for female than
for male offspring. Because females perpetrate violent crimes
less frequently than males and aggressive behavior in women
is viewed as being less culturally acceptable than in men, it has
been suggested that a higher “risk threshold” for violent crimi-
nality exists for women than for men.40,41 Research on ado-
lescence has also indicated that the cumulative effects of risk
factors for delinquency are stronger among girls than for
boys.40 These aspects may explain the larger female than male
relative risks for violent offending observed in this study, but
further research is needed to explore why for certain parental
diagnoses, for example, bipolar disorder (eTable 5 in the
Supplement), there was no evidence of greater relative risk for
violent offending in male vs female offspring.
Strengths and Limitations
The main strengths of our study include examination of a com-
plete national cohort, providing abundant statistical power to
examine rare exposures and outcomes. Because all exposures
andoutcomeswerecollectedprospectively,recallbiaswaselimi-
nated, an issue that would be pertinent to retrospective self-
reporting of parental psychiatric disease by offspring. The Dan-
ish Psychiatric Central Research Register also enabled us to
investigate the full spectrum of parental mental disorders, in-
cluding more narrowly defined categories. In examining the
same cohort, we were also able to compare risks for the 2 out-
comeswithoutdifferentialintercohortbiases.Themostimpor-
tantlimitationofourstudywasthat,althoughwecontrolledfor
parentalSES,wewerenotabletoadjustforotherpotentialcon-
founders such as parental criminal histories7 or cohort mem-
bers’experiencesofabuse.Dataoncriminaloffendingwereonly
available from 1981 onward, and childhood abuse episodes are
notroutinelyrecordedintheregisters.Inaddition,mildercases
of mental disorders, self-harm, and substance misuse treated
in primary care only are not recorded in the Danish Psychiatric
Central Research Register. Hence, our cases of suicide attempt
and parental mental disorders only included those with a se-
verity that resulted in secondary care treatment.
Conclusions
Elevated risks of both attempted suicide and violent offend-
ing in offspring are evident across a broad spectrum of paren-
tal psychiatric disease, with the links being strongest in rela-
tion to parental antisocial personality disorder, cannabis
misuse, and attempted suicide. Children with 2 affected par-
ents are particularly vulnerable. Psychiatrists and other pro-
fessionals treating adults with mental disorders and suicidal
behaviorshouldconsideralsoevaluatingthementalhealthand
psychosocial needs of their patients’children. Early interven-
tions could benefit not only the parents but also their off-
spring. In particular, interventions that aim to reduce the in-
cidence of and ameliorate the effects of parental substance
misuse may help to reduce their offspring’
s future risks for sui-
cidality and violence.
