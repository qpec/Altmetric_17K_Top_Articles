Abstract
Despite the potential of declared serving size to encourage appropriate portion size consumption, most countries including Australia have not
developed clear reference guidelines for serving size. The present study evaluated variability in manufacturer-declared serving size of
discretionary food and beverage products in Australia, and how declared serving size compared with the 2013 Australian Dietary Guideline
(ADG) standard serve (600kJ). Serving sizes were obtained from the Nutrition Information Panel for 4466 packaged, discretionary products in
2013 at four large supermarkets in Sydney, Australia, and categorised into fifteen categories in line with the 2013 ADG. For unique products that
were sold in multiple package sizes, the percentage difference between the minimum and the maximum serving size across different package
sizes was calculated. A high variation in serving size was found within the majority of food and beverage categories – for example, among 347
non-alcoholic beverages (e.g. soft drinks), the median for serving size was 250 (interquartile range (IQR) 250, 355) ml (range 100–750 ml).
Declared serving size for unique products that are available in multiple package sizes also showed high variation, particularly for chocolate-
based confectionery, with median percentage difference between minimum and maximum serving size of 183 (IQR 150) %. Categories
with a high proportion of products that exceeded the 600 kJ ADG standard serve included cakes and muffins, pastries and desserts (≥74 % for
each). High variability in declared serving size may confound interpretation and understanding of consumers interested in standardising
and controlling their portion selection. Future research is needed to assess if and how standardising declared serving size might affect
consumer behaviour.
Key words: Serving sizes: Nutrition labels: Discretionary foods: Portion sizes
Obesity is a significant public health challenge in both developed
and developing countries(1). Accumulating evidence suggests that
portion sizes – that is, the amount of a food item consumed on a
single eating occasion – have increased over the last several
decades and have contributed to increased population energy
intake and the obesity epidemic(2,3). Expanding portion sizes of
energy-dense, nutrient-poor, highly processed packaged products
such as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and salty snack foods
are particularly concerning(3,4), as there is widespread consensus
among dietary guidelines to limit intake of such ‘discretionary’
foods(5,6). Thus, there is an urgent need to identify effective
approaches that can aid consumers to reduce the portion size of
discretionary foods, as part of an overall public health goal to limit
intake of such foods and shift towards a healthier population
dietary pattern.
Nutrition labelling on packaged foods is a widely promoted
public health strategy aimed at providing an enabling environment
for healthier consumer choices(7). Declared serving size is a
mandatory part of nutrition labels in many different countries,
including Australia(8). However, little research has been carried out
to evaluate the effect of such labels on consumer preferences(9).
Limited evidences from controlled laboratory studies suggest that

 consumers may alter the amount of food they serve for themselves
and others when exposed to various declared serve sizes(10).
However, whether such findings are generalisable to real
consumption settings remain unclear. Previous evidence also
suggests that many consumers have difficulty interpreting and
using declared serving sizes(11). The potential for declared serving
size to provide guidance to consumers on what constitutes an
appropriate portion size therefore remains unclear. Serving size
declarations also directly influence other nutrient information
that is presented on a per serving basis. Recognising the likely
contribution of large portion sizes to over-consumption, policy
makers
and
food
companies
are
increasingly
providing
recommendations for declared serving size on nutrition labels. For
example, in both the USA and Australia, recent government
recommendations have suggested that if a product is packaged in
a size such that it could reasonably be expected to be consumed at
a single sitting (i.e. a single-serve product), then the declared
serving size should be the same as the package size(12,13).
Despite the potential of declared serving size to encourage
appropriate
portion
size
consumption,
many
countries
including
Australia
have
not
developed
clear
reference
guidelines for serving size, which are therefore left at the
discretion of food manufacturers(14). There is some evidence to
suggest that there are substantial inconsistencies in the declared
serving sizes of packaged foods in Australia(15), including for
discretionary products such as SSB(16). This has led to concerns
of causing confusion among consumers due to disparate
serving size declarations for otherwise nutritionally similar
products. Such problems could be further compounded by the
influence of serving size variability on nutrient profiling
schemes (e.g. traffic lights) that use per serving nutrient values
to determine the overall healthiness of products(14). Very few
studies
have
conducted
in-depth
examinations
of
how
manufacturer serving size declarations are implemented in
Australia. To address these important gaps in knowledge, we
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the declared serving
size
within
fifteen
categories
of
commonly
consumed
discretionary foods and beverages in Australia. Our primary
objectives were to describe the variability in serving sizes across
discretionary food categories, assess the degree to which
manufacturer-declared
serving
sizes
are
aligned
with
government recommendations and to provide an empirical
evaluation of how variations in manufacturer-declared serving
size could impact specific nutrient profiling schemes.
Methods
Data collection
Nutritional information (including reported serving size) was
obtained from the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP) for all
packaged food and beverage products available for sale
between July and September 2013 at four large supermarket
stores (Coles, Woolworths, ALDI, IGA) in Sydney, Australia, and
recorded in The George Institute for Global Health’s branded
food
database,
according
to
standardised
methods
and
quality assurance procedures(17–19). The four supermarkets
where packaged foods were sampled are a mix of large
(Woolworths and Coles), discount (ALDI) and independent
(IGA) retail supermarket stores. Woolworths and Coles hold
between them 73 %, ALDI 10·3 % and IGA 9·5 % of all grocery
(inclusive of food and non-food) spent in Australia(20). For each
food product, the product name, brand name, manufacturer,
nutrient information/100 g or 100 ml, ingredients and reported
serving size (as consumed) were recorded. We excluded from
the study variety packs with multiple NIP displayed.
Discretionary food categories
Products were categorised (based on their name) according to
the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG)(6) into fifteen
discretionary food categories: processed meat; chocolate-based
confectionery; sweet biscuits; cakes and muffins; crisps and
snacks; jam, marmalades, honey and syrup; non-alcoholic
beverages;
sugar-based
confectionery;
ice
cream,
frozen
yogurt and edible ices; pastries; dairy desserts; protein and
diet bars; frozen potato products; and cream and butter.
Classification of products was at the minor group level (details
of foods included in each food category are shown in the online
Supplementary Table S1).
Australian Dietary Guidelines, policy initiatives and
nutrient profiling schemes relevant to this evaluation
(1) Although there are no agreed reference serving sizes for
specific discretionary foods in Australia, the 2013 ADG
suggests one ‘standard serve’ of a discretionary food as the
amount that contains about 600 kJ of energy(6). The
standard serve defines the equivalent serving size that
provides similar levels of energy and nutrients for different
foods within the same group, and thereby allows health
agencies to translate dietary guidelines into practical advice
to compose a healthy diet(6). For example, the 600 kJ
standard serve translates to a standard serve size of 75 and
25 g for ice creams and chocolates, respectively. Although
the ADG standard serve for discretionary foods is not
designed to be a reference to define manufacturer-declared
serving size, for the purpose of the present analyses, we
used it as a benchmark to identify declared serving
sizes that could be considered as inappropriately large
(i.e. products with a declared serving size >600 kJ).
(2) A relevant policy initiative identified was the Food and
Health Dialogue (FHD). The FHD was established by the
Australian Government in 2009 with the aim of partnering
with the food industry to improve the nutritional content of
commonly consumed foods through the reformulation of
products, and also provides guidance for declared serving
sizes in similar foods. One of the FHD principles for declared
serving size states that ‘multiple serve items should consist of
appropriate serve sizes in relation to single serve packs’(12).
In addition, the FHD also suggests that if a product is packed
in a way that it can be reasonably expected to be consumed
by the target market in one serving, then the declared serving
size should be the same as the package size.

 (3) Using a case-study approach, we reviewed multiple
nutrient profiling schemes used to classify the healthiness
of foods that are currently in use in Australia(21–23).
We ascertained that each of the schemes reviewed
used a per serve nutrient-based algorithm for multiple
discretionary
food
categories,
and
therefore
could
potentially be influenced by variability in declared serving
size. For illustrative purposes, we chose one of the traffic
light schemes (Fresh Tastes @ School guidelines, FTAS)(21),
in order to assess how variability in serving size may affect
the classification of discretionary foods. The FTAS guideline
was developed by the government of New South Wales
(a state in Australia) to enable school canteens to procure
healthier products, and specifically recommends canteens
to limit the sale of products that are classified as ‘red’ under
the FTAS criteria(21).
Statistical analysis
Summary statistics for declared serving size are presented as
medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) (unless otherwise stated)
as not all categories were normally distributed, using weight (g) for
solid foods or volume (ml) for liquids/beverages. If a product was
available in multiple package sizes, we randomly selected one
product for inclusion in analyses 1, 3 and 4.
Analysis 1. The serving size as declared by the manufacturer on
packaged food labels was compared with the ADG standard
serve for discretionary food by calculating the percentage
difference between energy per serve and the ADG-defined
600 kJ/standard serve(6).
Analysis 2. To assess the variability of declared serving size by
product across different package sizes, we identified products
with three or more different package sizes and assessed the
variability
in
declared
serving
size
(median
percentage
difference between the minimum and maximum serving size
across the package sizes).
Analysis 3. We identified single-serve packs as products with a
total package size equal to or less than the ADG standard serve
(approximately 600 kJ). This was equivalent to 25 g (half a bar)
for chocolate-based confectionery, 40 g (five to six small pieces)
for sugar-based confectionery, 30 g (half-sized packet) for crisps
and snacks and 375 ml (one can of SSB) for non-alcoholic
beverages. For each of these categories, we calculated the
proportion of products with a declared serving size equal to or
less than the package size.
Analysis 4. To illustrate the potential effect of serving size
variation on nutrient profiling schemes, we classified products
into three categories – that is, SSB, ice creams and savoury
snacks – as ‘red’ or ‘non-red’ according to nutrient criteria for
the FTAS system: for SSB, a product is classified as red if it
contains >300 kJ of energy or >100 mg Na per serve; for ice
creams, energy >600 kJ or SFA > 3 g per serve; and for savoury
snacks, energy >600 kJ or SFA > 3 g or Na > 200 mg per serve.
Subsequently, we compared the distribution of energy for red v.
non-red products on a per 100 g or per 100 ml basis.
All analyses were conducted using Stata (release 13.1;
StataCorp LP).
Results
There were 4466 unique products identified across the fifteen
discretionary categories analysed in this study (Table 1). The
largest categories included the following: processed meats
(n 774, 17 %), chocolate-based confectionery (n 556, 12 %) and
sweet biscuits (n 486, 11 %). Conversely, there were relatively
few protein bars, frozen potato products, cream and butter
items (all n ≤ 100 products, ≤2·2 %).

 Variability of serving size within product categories
Substantial variability in the declared serving size was observed for
several discretionary food categories (Table 1; Fig. 1). For example,
among 347 non-alcoholic beverages, the median for serving size
was 250 (IQR 250, 355)ml, and the range observed was between
100
and
750ml.
However,
serving
size
was
much
more
homogeneous for other product categories including butter, with a
median value of 5 (IQR 5, 5)g, and for jam, marmalade, honey and
syrup it was 15 (IQR 15, 20)g. As expected, large variability was
also observed in energy per serve for product categories with a
wide range of serving size – for example, the median energy
per serving size for cakes and muffins was 835 (IQR 606, 1212)kJ.
Comparison with Australian Dietary Guideline
standard serve
Seven out of the fifteen categories analysed in this study had
≥50 % of products with energy per serving above the ADG
discretionary food standard serve of 600 kJ, including cakes and
muffins (76 % of products with energy/serve >600 kJ), pastries
(75 %), desserts (74 %), protein and diet bars (60 %), frozen
potato products (54 %), processed meats (52 %) and ice cream,
frozen yogurt and edible ices (51 %) (Fig. 2).
Multiple package sizes for the same product
Four of the discretionary food categories included unique products
with three or more different package sizes (Table 2). The median
percentage difference between the minimum and the maximum
serving size for products with multiple package sizes ranged from
183 (IQR 150) % for chocolate-based confectionery to 31 (IQR
23)% for sweet biscuits. For example, for Cadbury Cherry Ripe
Chocolate, the largest package size (216 g) had a declared serving
size of 18g, whereas the smallest package size (52g) had a serving
size of 52 g, a difference of 189%. Similarly, in the non-alcoholic
beverages category, Coca-Cola of 2-litre package size had a
declared serving size of 250 ml, whereas a 375ml can had a
serving size of 375 ml, a difference of 50 %.

 less than the ADG standard serve (approximately 600 kJ), and
then evaluated the consistency between declared serving size
and package size for these products. Overall, the majority of
declared serving sizes was equal to the package size in
sixty-two (65 %) of ninety-five identified single-serve products
(Table 3). For the other thirty-three products (35 %), all had
serving size labels smaller than the total package size. Some
heterogeneity was observed between product categories. For
example, the declared serving size was equal to the package
size for nine out of eleven (82 %) single-serve chocolate-based
confectionery products and for only eight out of twenty-six
(31 %) single-serve sugar-based confectionery products. We
found similar results in a sensitivity analysis, where we included
products up to 50 % larger than the ADG standard serve (i.e. for
chocolate-based confectionery, those with a total package size
up to 50 g; results not shown).

 creams and savoury snacks (Table 4). We found that within
each discretionary food type, products with similar nutrient
profiles received different traffic light ratings. For example, for
the fifty SSB products with similar energy content that ranged
between 133 and 180 kJ/100 ml, their energy per serve actually
varied between 149 and 656 kJ/serve due to serving size
variability. Therefore, when these products were classified
according to FTAS cut-off points (>300 kJ/serve receives a red
light), forty-one (82 %) received a red traffic light, while the
other nine (18 %) did not. This can be further illustrated by
comparing individual products – for example, Coles Pineapple
& Mango Mineral Water (194 kJ/100 ml, declared serving size of
250 ml) received a red traffic light rating under FTAS, while
Santa Vittoria Chinotto (195 kJ/100 ml, declared serving size of
100 ml) did not. Similar findings were also observed for ice
creams and savoury snacks.
Discussion
In this cross-sectional analysis of almost 4500 packaged
discretionary
food
and
beverage
items
in
Australia,
we
observed large variability in manufacturer-declared serving
sizes within almost all discretionary categories examined,
including for identical products available in multiple package
sizes. We further found that a substantial proportion of products
had declared serving sizes that exceeded the ADG standard
serve for discretionary foods, and identified discrepancies
between declared serving sizes for single-serve products
and products with multiple package sizes and government
recommendations.
Finally,
these
results
highlighted
the
potentially misleading effects of disparate declared serving sizes
on nutrient profiling systems that are currently used in some
institutions to classify the healthiness of food products.

* According to FTAS, a SSB product is classified as ‘red’ if it contains >300kJ energy/serve or >100mg Na/serve. From the 347 SSB included our data set, we identified a subset of 237
products whose Na content was ≤100mg/serve. For these products, the traffic light rating is therefore solely dependent on their energy per serve. Similar approaches were used to
identify subsets of ice cream and savoury snack products whose FTAS classification is solely dependent on their energy per serve. Products within food categories were then divided into
quintiles according to their energy/100ml or 100g to identify products of similar energy density. Products within energy quintiles were then classified using the FTAS energy criteria.

 Accumulating
experimental
and
observational
evidence
supports a link between excessive portion sizes, particularly for
discretionary foods, and the obesity epidemic(24). Although it
has been suggested that manufacturer-declared serving size
on packaged foods could educate consumers on appropriate
portion size selection, its effect on consumer behaviour remains
little investigated(14). Although limited experimental studies
suggest
drawing
participants’
awareness
to
serving
size
recommendations can change portion selection(10,25), such
findings may not be generalisable to real-world settings where
consumers may not use, or have difficulty interpreting, food
labels. Our results suggest that, in practice, high variability in
declared serving size – for example, with up to 200 % difference
between the smallest and the largest reported serving size for
the same product available in multiple package sizes – may
confound interpretation and understanding even for consumers
interested in using declared serving size to understand and
control portion sizes.
Discretionary products that can reasonably be consumed at a
single eating occasion, such as chocolate confectionery and
potato chips, are popular snack foods(26,27) that are ubiquitous
in the food environment(28,29). In order to clarify for consumers
the energy and nutrient contents of these types of products,
nutrition guidelines (e.g. the FDA Nutrition Facts label and the
Australian FHD) have mandated or recommended that the
declared serving size should equal the entire package size(12,13).
Our findings suggest reasonable compliance of Australian
manufacturers with the Australian guidelines, although for 35 %
of the products their serving size was smaller than the
total package size, that is, multiple servings declared in a
‘single-serve’
package.
Declaring
smaller
serve
sizes
for
single-serve packaged products could cause over-consumption
due to ‘health framing’ – whereby consumers perceive such
products as ‘healthier’ than a similar product with a larger
declared serving size, which may subsequently result in excess
consumption of such items due to the health halo effect(30).
Although in Australia the nutrient values per 100 g or per 100 ml
are available and could be used to compare products, many
consumers prefer the per serving size label format, which is
also the only option available on nutrition labels in some
countries(8,31). Our findings therefore further reinforce the
importance of standardising declared serving size.
Despite national and international dietary guidelines that
consistently advocate for reductions in discretionary food
consumption(5,6) to lower the risk of obesity and chronic
diseases, current levels of intake remain high in many parts of
the world, including Australia. For example, discretionary foods
contributed to approximately 35 % of daily energy intake in
Australia based on the 2011–2012 Australian Health Survey(32).
These high levels of discretionary food intake underscore
the fact that other factors also influence food and drink
consumption, such as the food environment, food prices and
labelling. Our finding that the majority of discretionary products
have declared serving sizes greater than the ADG standard
serve of 600 kJ/serve is concerning, as such declared serving
sizes may encourage over-consumption of discretionary food
portions. These results indicate the disconnect between some
discretionary food labels and prevailing health advice to reduce
intake of these foods, and emphasise the need to adopt policy
efforts to standardise declared serving sizes to encourage
reduced energy intake from discretionary foods.
Nutrient profiling schemes that convert numeric nutrient
information into easy-to-interpret symbols (e.g. traffic lights) are
increasingly endorsed and used by the food industry(14). Such
interpretive schemes have also been adopted by government
agencies to assist with dietary guidance and food procurement
choices; thus, their accuracy will significantly impact on
individual consumer and even community dietary choices. Our
results show that even for products with very similar nutrient
content,
some
discretionary
products
are
interpreted
as
healthier than others, solely due to their declared serving size
on packages, which can be misleading to the consumer.
Nutrient profiling schemes evaluated on a per serving basis are
not only used in Australia but also in other countries such as
South Korea(33,34). Our findings suggest that in order to improve
the accuracy of these nutrient profiling schemes and to allow a
more reliable comparison between products, industry and
government
should
either
standardise
declared
serving
size labels or evaluate nutrients based on per 100 g or 100 ml
as reference.
In the absence of government regulation, it is not clear how
declared serving size values are determined by manufacturers
in Australia. Instead, voluntary food industry targets have been
set for a limited number of discretionary products, including for
chocolate/sugar confectionery (25 g) and beverages (serving
size equals total package size if total package size is ≤600 ml,
and serving size of 250 ml if total package size is >600 ml)(35). In
this analysis, although the declared serving sizes centred
around the voluntary targets, substantial variability was still
observed in these food categories, suggesting incomplete
uptake. Overall, our findings highlight the need for serving size
guidelines across discretionary food and beverage categories,
due to the observed degree of variability, the proportion greater
than the ADG discretionary standard serve and anomalies
observed with nutrition profiling schemes using declared
serving sizes. Such guidelines could potentially be based on
energy content cut-off limits; such an approach would require
the limits to be relevant to the type of discretionary products to
avoid perverse outcomes, that is, serving sizes perceived as
promoting larger portion sizes. Another approach would be to
use household food consumption survey data of typical portion
sizes consumed, which could be determined based on recent
Australian dietary surveys(32), that is, the reference amounts
customarily consumed approach used by the US FDA(36).
Regardless of the approach, caution is required that any
guidelines for declared serving size for discretionary foods are
not perceived by the food industry as a need to increase smaller
single-serve
packages
or
consumers
to
increase
their
smaller portion sizes, but instead considered a cap or upper
limit to avoid excessive portion sizes. Development and
implementation
of
guidelines
will
also
require
robust
monitoring to determine adherence, particularly if a voluntary
implementation model is adapted.
Our study has several strengths. It is the most recent survey of
packaged discretionary foods in Australia and the findings are
consistent with previous studies, showing high variability in

 declared serving sizes(37–39). We also included a much larger
number of products across a wider range of discretionary food
categories than previous studies. We utilised rigorous and
validated sample collection and data entry methods(17,18), and
the large number of products collected from the leading
Australian retailers ensured a high level of market coverage for
commonly
consumed
Australian
packaged
foods.
The
limitations of our study should also be considered. Owing to the
lack of agreed standardised serving size for single-serve food
products in Australia, we used the ADG 600 kJ standard serve
for discretionary foods as an ‘upper limit’ and to identify
single-serve snacks and beverages, and it should be noted that
declared serving sizes <600 kJ, and portion sizes for that matter,
are not considered ‘low’ or expected to be increased to
the 600 kJ standard serve value. Our product survey was only
carried out in Australian supermarkets, and therefore our results
may have limited generalisability to other countries.
To conclude, our data demonstrated that large variability in
declared serving sizes in discretionary food and beverage items in
Australia is the norm in the absence of a strong regulatory
environment, which may reduce the effectiveness of serving
size guidance. The use of standardised serving size based on a
reference serving size could create an enabling environment that
aids consumers to select more appropriate portion sizes to reduce
over-consumption and obesity. Future research is urgently needed
to
assess
the
benefits
and
limitations
of
developing
and
implementing such standards in Australia and globally.
