Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults and Heterosexual
Adults in the United States
Results From the National Health Interview Survey
Gilbert Gonzales, PhD, MHA; Julia Przedworski, BS; Carrie Henning-Smith, PhD, MPH, MSW
IMPORTANCE Previous studies identified disparities in health and health risk factors among
lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults, but prior investigations have been confined to
samples not representative of the US adult population or have been limited in size or
geographic scope. For the first time in its long history, the 2013 and 2014 National Health
Interview Survey included a question on sexual orientation, providing health information on
sexual minorities from one of the nation’
s leading health surveys.
OBJECTIVE To compare health and health risk factors between LGB adults and heterosexual
adults in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from the nationally representative 2013 and 2014
National Health Interview Survey were used to compare health outcomes among lesbian
(n = 525), gay (n = 624), and bisexual (n = 515) adults who were 18 years or older and their
heterosexual peers (n = 67 150) using logistic regression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-rated health, functional status, chronic conditions,
psychological distress, alcohol consumption, and cigarette use.
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 68 814 participants. Their mean (SD) age was 46.8
(11.8) years, and 51.8% (38 063 of 68 814) were female. After controlling for
sociodemographic characteristics, gay men were more likely to report severe psychological
distress (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% CI, 1.55-5.14), heavy drinking (OR, 1.97; 95% CI,
1.08-3.58), and moderate smoking (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.39-2.81) than heterosexual men;
bisexual men were more likely to report severe psychological distress (OR, 4.70; 95% CI,
1.77-12.52), heavy drinking (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.22-8.16), and heavy smoking (OR, 2.10; 95% CI,
1.08-4.10) than heterosexual men; lesbian women were more likely to report moderate
psychological distress (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.76), poor or fair health (OR, 1.91; 95% CI,
1.24-2.95), multiple chronic conditions (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.12-2.22), heavy drinking (OR, 2.63;
95% CI, 1.54-4.50), and heavy smoking (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.36-3.88) than heterosexual
women; and bisexual women were more likely to report multiple chronic conditions (OR,
2.07; 95% CI, 1.34-3.20), severe psychological distress (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 2.19-6.22), heavy
drinking (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.20-3.59), and moderate smoking (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05-2.44)
than heterosexual women.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study supports prior research finding substantial health
disparities for LGB adults in the United States, potentially due to the stressors that LGB
people experience as a result of interpersonal and structural discrimination. In screening for
health issues, clinicians should be sensitive to the needs of sexual minority patients.

A
ttention to the health care needs of the lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has
increased in recent years.1-4 In 2011, the Institute
of Medicine5 identified—and targeted for elimination—
disparities in health and health care for sexual and gender mi-
nority individuals. According to the numerous studies re-
viewed in the Institute of Medicine report, LGBT people
experience worse health outcomes compared with their het-
erosexual and nontransgender peers as a result of “minority
stress,” or the chronic stress associated with being a member
of a marginalized minority group.6-10 Discriminatory environ-
ments and public policies can stigmatize LGBT people and en-
genderfeelingsofrejection,shame,andlowself-esteem,which
can negatively shape their health and health-related
behaviors.11
Unfortunately, data for measuring and monitoring the
health of LGBT populations in the United States have been lim-
ited. In some research, data were gathered from nonrandom
convenience samples of LGBT people in clinical settings12 or
LGBT-specific community organizations.13,14 Population-
based studies on LGBT adults have been constrained to health
surveysofsmallsamples,15-17requiringresearcherstopooldata
over many years18,19 or to collapse all LGBT adults into a single
category.17,20-22 Other health surveys with sexual orientation
data have been confined to individual states,23-28 making it dif-
ficult to generalize to the US population. While these studies
have been instrumental for providing important health infor-
mation on LGBT people, recent federal initiatives have taken
steps toward adding sexual orientation and gender identity
questions to federally funded health surveys.29
This study uses recently collected nationally representa-
tive data to examine health and health risk factors within the
lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adult population in the United
States. We focus on health outcomes and health-related be-
haviors that represent the wide spectrum of health and well-
being in the LGB population. The objectives of our study were
to establish baseline nationally representative estimates of the
physical, functional, and mental health status and health risk
factors for LGB adults compared with non-LGB adults to moni-
tor progress toward eliminating sexual orientation–based
health disparities and avoidable differences in health.30
Methods
Data Source
Allanalyseswerelimitedtopubliclyavailable,deidentifieddata
and did not require institutional review board approval. Ver-
bal informed consent was obtained by the National Center for
Health Statistics. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
isanationallyrepresentativehealthsurveyofthecivilian,non-
institutionalizedpopulationandservesasoneofthemostcom-
prehensiveresourcesonhealthintheUnitedStates.31TheFam-
ily Core questionnaire records basic health and disability
information for each household member, while a single ran-
dom adult in each household is selected for a detailed inter-
view on more specific health information that includes health
conditions, health behaviors, and access to health care. Our
study sample was drawn from the Sample Adult component
(n = 68 814) in the Integrated Health Interview Series,32 a har-
monized version of the 2013 and 2014 NHIS. Approximately
75% of the selected households completed the survey, and ap-
proximately81%ofselectedadultscompletedtheSampleAdult
component.33
Study Sample
Beginning in 2013, a question regarding sexual orientation was
added to the Sample Adult component of the NHIS.34 Respon-
dents 18 years or older were asked which of the following
categories best represents how they thought of themselves:
(1) lesbian or gay; (2) straight, that is, not gay; (3) bisexual;
(4) something else; (5) I don’
t know the answer; or (6) refuse.
We classified respondents as lesbian or gay (n = 1149), bi-
sexual (n = 515), and heterosexual (n = 67 150). All analyses
were stratified separately for men and women, and we ex-
cluded respondents who indicated their sexual orientation as
something else (n = 144), did not know the answer (n = 310),
or refused to answer (n = 448). Initial quality assessments con-
ductedbytheNationalCenterforHealthStatistics35founditem
nonresponse(ie,casesreportingsomethingelse,refusedtoan-
swer, or did not know the answer) was higher among respon-
dents with lower levels of education, respondents residing in
rural areas, and respondents not completing the survey in Eng-
lish. Meanwhile, transgender identity was not separately as-
certained in the 2013 and 2014 NHIS.
Health Status and Health Risk Factor Measures
Weexamined3physicalandfunctionalhealthoutcomes.These
included the following: (1) self-rated health status (poor or fair
health vs excellent, very good, or good health), (2) reporting 1
or multiple (≥2) of 10 chronic conditions (cancer, hyperten-
sion, coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pul-
monarydisease,asthma,diabetes,arthritis,hepatitis,andweak
orfailingkidneys36),and(3)needinghelpwithactivitiesofdaily
living (ADLs) (eg, eating, bathing, dressing, or getting around
inside the home) or instrumental ADLs (IADLs) (eg, house-
hold chores, doing necessary business, or shopping) because
of physical, mental, or emotional problems.
We also examined differences in 3 mental health and
substance use measures available in the NHIS. To examine
Key Points
Question What does one of the nation’
s leading health surveys
teach us about health outcomes and health risk factors in lesbian,
gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults when it first measured sexual
orientation?
Findings In this nationally representative study of approximately
68 000 adults, LGB adults were more likely to report impaired
physical and mental health, heavy alcohol consumption, and
heavy cigarette use, potentially due to the stressors that LGB
people experience as a result of interpersonal and structural
discrimination.
Meaning In screening for health issues, clinicians should be
sensitive to the needs of sexual minority patients.

mental health status, we relied on the Kessler 6-Item Psycho-
logical Distress Scale for an indicator of nonspecific psycho-
logical distress, which asked how often during the previous 30
days the respondent felt nervous, hopeless, worthless, so sad
that nothing could cheer him or her up, restless or fidgety,
and that everything was an effort.37 The Kessler 6-Item
Psychological Distress Scale is a validated and widely used
6-item screening instrument used to assess individuals for
moderate and severe mental illness in epidemiologic studies.
Based on a 24-point range, we classified adults between the
5-point and 12-point threshold as symptomatic of moderate
psychological distress38 and above the 13-point threshold as
symptomatic of severe psychological distress.37 Beyond rep-
resenting an important mental health outcome, nonspecific
psychological distress has been tied to later health outcomes,
including mortality.39
Two substance use measures were also assessed, includ-
ing alcohol consumption and cigarette use (the NHIS does not
ask respondents about marijuana, opioid, or other illicit drug
use). Respondents were classified as having been lifetime ab-
stainersfromalcoholdrinking(<12drinksintheirlifetime),for-
mer alcohol drinkers (≥12 drinks in their lifetime and none in
the past year), and current alcohol drinkers (≥12 drinks in their
lifetime and ≥1 drink in the past year). Infrequent, light, and
moderate current drinkers (1-14 drinks per week for men and
1-7 drinks per week for women) were distinguished from heavy
current drinkers (>14 drinks per week for men and >7 drinks
per week for women). Unfortunately, binge drinking was not
measured consistently across the 2013 and 2014 NHIS.
Cigarette users were classified as nonsmokers (<100 ciga-
rettesintheirlifetime),formersmokers(≥100cigarettesintheir
lifetime but no longer smoke), and current smokers (≥100 ciga-
rettesintheirlifetimeandsmokesomedaysoreveryday).Mod-
erate vs heavy smokers were distinguished by whether they
reported smoking on average less than vs at least 20 ciga-
rettes (or approximately 1 pack of cigarettes) per day.40 Of the
respondents reporting current cigarette use (n = 12 189), 1.7%
(n = 203) were excluded from the analysis of cigarette use be-
cause they were missing information on the number of ciga-
rettes smoked daily.
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study sample
and to estimate the prevalence of impaired physical, func-
tional, and mental health, as well as alcohol consumption and
tobacco use. Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare sociode-
mographic characteristics and health outcomes across sexual
orientation categories. We then estimated binary or multino-
mial logistic regression models for each outcome: multino-
mial logistic regression models were used on outcomes with
3 or more responses (ie, chronic conditions, psychological dis-
tress,alcoholconsumption,andcigaretteuse).Allmodelswere
adjusted for confounding variables and key differences across
sexual orientation samples, including the following: age, race/
ethnicity, relationship status, presence of a minor child in the
household,languageofinterview,familyincomerelativetothe
federal poverty guidelines, educational attainment, employ-
ment status, primary source of health insurance, no office visit
with a physician or health care professional in the past year,
unmet medical care due to cost in the past year, region, and
survey year. Rural residence was not available in the public use
data files. If multiple sources of health insurance were re-
ported for an observation, we assigned the primary source of
coverage in the order of private, public, and uninsured. Re-
sults from the logistic regression models are presented as
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. We conducted all
analyses separately for men and women in a software pro-
gram(Stata,version14;StataCorpLP)usingsurveyweightsand
thesvycommandtoadjuststandarderrorsforthecomplexsur-
vey design of the NHIS and to generate nationally represen-
tative estimates.41 Finally, we included indicators when data
weremissingfordemographicandsocioeconomicvariables(ie,
relationship status, educational attainment, employment sta-
tus, health insurance status, office visits, and unmet medical
care due to cost). As recommended by the National Center for
Health Statistics,42 we used multiple imputations in Stata (via
the mi family of commands) to adjust for missing responses
to family income.
Results
Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics
by Sexual Orientation
Table 1 lists demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
of the US adult population by gender and sexual orientation.
Approximately 2% of the noninstitutionalized, civilian adult
population identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Compared
withheterosexualmen,bothgaymenandbisexualmentended
to be younger, less likely to be married or living with a part-
ner, and less likely to have a minor child in the household. Both
gay men and bisexual men had higher levels of educational at-
tainment than heterosexual men. Bisexual men were most
likely to be uninsured, and both gay men and bisexual men
were more likely to have unmet medical care due to cost com-
pared with heterosexual men. There were no significant dif-
ferences in race/ethnicity, family income, employment sta-
tus,andhavingarecentofficevisitforhealthcareacrosssexual
orientation categories for men.
While there were no statistically significant differences in
race/ethnicity across sexual orientations for women, com-
pared with heterosexual women, lesbian women were less
likelytobemarriedorlivingwithapartnerandweremorelikely
to report higher levels of family income, educational attain-
ment, and full-time employment status. Bisexual women were
less likely to be married or living with a partner and were more
likely to be younger, living in poverty, and unemployed com-
pared with heterosexual women. Both lesbian women and bi-
sexual women were more likely to be uninsured and have un-
met medical care due to cost, while lesbian women were most
likely to not have an office visit for health care in the past year.

Regression Findings
Table 3 compares health outcomes and health risk factors be-
tween LGB adults and their heterosexual peers, while adjust-
ing for potentially confounding variables. After controlling for
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, compared
with heterosexual men, gay men experienced elevated odds
of moderate (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.96) to severe (OR, 2.82;
95% CI, 1.55-5.14) psychological distress, heavy alcohol con-
sumption (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.08-3.58), and moderate ciga-
rette use (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.39-2.81). Bisexual men exhib-
ited greater odds of moderate (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.62-4.18) and
severe (OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 1.77-12.52) psychological distress
comparedwithheterosexualmen,andbisexualmenweremore
likely to be heavy drinkers (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.22-8.16) and
heavy cigarette smokers (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.08-4.10).
Table 3 also lists results from logistic regression analyses
comparing lesbian and bisexual women with heterosexual
women. After controlling for demographic and socioeco-
nomic factors, lesbian women reported elevated odds of poor

Discussion
This study examined differences in physical, functional, and
mentalhealthstatusandhealthriskfactorsbetweenLGBadults
and heterosexual adults using recently available sexual ori-
entationdataintheNHIS,oneoftheprincipalsourcesofhealth
information on the US population. Findings from our study in-
dicate that LGB adults experience significant health dispari-
ties—particularly in mental health and substance use—likely
due to the minority stress that LGB adults experience as a re-
sult of their exposure to both interpersonal and structural
discrimination.6-10Asafirststeptowardeliminatingsexualori-
entation–basedhealthdisparities,itisimportantforhealthcare
professionals to be aware and mindful of the increased risk of
impairedhealth,alcoholconsumption,andtobaccouseamong
their LGB adult patients.
We found the highest prevalence and odds of psychologi-
caldistressamongbisexualadults.Bisexualpeoplearenotonly
marginalized by the larger heterosexual population, but also
somebisexualindividualsmayexperiencestigmafromgayand
lesbian individuals, resulting in lower connections with the
sexual minority community.43-46 Combined with the relative
scarcity of bisexual communities and organizations, this os-
tracizing may lead to social isolation, a risk factor for psycho-
logical distress.46,47 Combining LGB adults into a single cat-
egory would have obscured these important differences
between groups. As additional data are collected each year, al-
lowing for more robust sample sizes among small popula-
tions, researchers should continue to examine the causes and
consequences of impaired health in subgroups within the LGB
population. In addition to bisexual adults, such groups might
include racial/ethnic minorities, older adults, individuals with
disabilities,andlow-incomeindividualswhoidentifyassexual
minorities.
Another finding from our study is that, while gay and les-
bian adults in the NHIS were advantaged in terms of education

and (for lesbian women) income relative to their heterosexual
counterparts,thatadvantagedidnottranslateintobetterhealth
outcomes. Research has long demonstrated a strong link be-
tween socioeconomic status and better health.48 However, the
effect of sexual minority status appears to have an even stron-
ger influence on health and health risk factors. This effect may
beattributabletothechronicminoritystressexperiencedbygay
and lesbian people, or it may also be a reflection of differences
in family structure and the health advantages that partnership
affords.49Accesstolegallyrecognizedmarriagewasanewphe-
nomenon for many of the LGB adults in the study sample and
would not have taken effect for most of the country until after
the NHIS was conducted in 2013 and 2014. Still, future re-
search should elucidate the interactions between sexual orien-
tation,socioeconomicstatus,andfamilystructureandtheiref-
fects on long-term health outcomes, including physical and
mental health status and health risk factors.
There were several limitations to using the NHIS for this
study. All responses to the NHIS were self-reported, which
can lead to response and recall bias when describing health
and health behaviors, but the health outcomes we study rep-
resent standard and clinically meaningful outcomes for
monitoring the population’
s health.31,37,38 In addition, report-
ing sexual orientation may be limited by selection bias. For
example, lesbian women may be more likely than gay men to
register and report their same-sex relationships and sexual
orientation status,50 and adults reporting sexual minority
status are more likely to be highly educated.51 Meanwhile,
ascertaining sexual orientation during in-person interviews
with NHIS surveyors may discourage respondents from
reporting accurate sexual orientations, especially among
rural populations, non–English language speakers, and racial/
ethnic minorities.35,52 Our results may be biased to the extent
that select subgroups did not disclose their sexual orientation
in the NHIS.
Our study would have benefited from additional informa-
tion that was missing in the NHIS. For example, the NHIS does
not measure other dimensions of sexual orientation, includ-
ing sexual behavior or sexual attraction. Therefore, our study
does not consider individuals who are sexually active with or
attracted to people of the same gender but do not identify as
lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Furthermore, data on transgender
identity were not separately ascertained. Transgender indi-
viduals,asmallgroup,areoftennotidentifiedinfederallyspon-
sored health surveys. Given this group’
s high risk of experi-
encing impaired health, substance abuse, discrimination, and
violence,5 the NHIS should continue its work to incorporate
transgender identity status in future surveys,53 even if doing
sorequirespoolingacrossyearsorcombiningcategoriesofgen-
der identity to protect anonymity. Finally, the NHIS is a cross-
sectional survey and cannot definitively establish the causal
directions of the observed associations because cross-
sectional studies are prone to omitted variable bias. Missing
and unmeasured variables—such as exposure to discrimina-
tion or nondisclosure of sexual orientation to family, friends,
and health care professionals—may provide alternative expla-
nations for the association between sexual orientation and
health outcomes. Future research should continue to explore
the underlying causes of impaired health in the LGB popula-
tion and use those findings to identify medical and policy in-
terventions to ameliorate disparities in health and health risk
factors.
Conclusions
Notwithstanding these limitations, our study supports previ-
ous research finding differences in health status and health be-
haviors in the LGB population using recently available data
from a large, nationally representative health survey. This ob-
servationisanimportantsteptowardunderstandingthehealth
and well-being of the LGB population, as prior research has
been limited to convenience samples or population-based
health surveys limited in size or geographic scope. Our find-
ings that LGB adults were more likely to experience impaired
healthandwell-being,combinedwithanelevatedriskofheavy
drinking and smoking patterns, should serve as a call to health
care professionals and public health practitioners to pay par-
ticular attention to the current and future health outcomes of
this small, diverse, and vulnerable population.
